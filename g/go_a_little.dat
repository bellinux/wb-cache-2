25|$|In January 1910 Griffith and Lee Dougherty {{with the}} rest of the Biograph acting company {{traveled}} to Los Angeles. While the purpose of the trip was to shoot Ramona in authentic locations, it was also to determine the suitability of the West Coast as a place for a permanent studio. The group set up a small facility at Washington Street and Grand Avenue (where the Los Angeles Convention Center now stands). After this, Griffith and his players decided to <b>go</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> further north to a small village they had heard about that was friendly and had beautiful floral scenery. They decided to travel there and fell in love with this little place called Hollywood. Biograph then made the first film ever in Hollywood called In Old California, a Latino melodrama about the early days of Mexico-owned California. Griffith and the Biograph troupe filmed other short movies at various locations, then traveled back to New York. After the East Coast film community heard about Hollywood, other companies began to migrate there. Biograph’s little film launched Hollywood as the future movie capital of the world. It opened a studio at Pico and Georgia streets in downtown Los Angeles in 1911, and sent a film crew to work there each year until 1916.|$|E
500|$|The script served its diversionary purpose, and the Coens put it aside: [...] "Barton Fink sort of {{washed out}} our brain {{and we were}} able to go back and finish Miller's Crossing." [...] Once {{production}} of the first movie was finished, the Coens began to recruit staff to film Barton Fink. Turturro looked forward to playing the lead role, and spent a month with the Coens in Los Angeles to coordinate views on the project: [...] "I felt I could bring something more human to Barton. Joel and Ethan allowed me a certain contribution. I tried to <b>go</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> further than they expected." ...|$|E
500|$|The brigade was {{advancing}} in quarter column {{as directed}} by Methuen's orders. [...] The soldiers advanced packed as closely together as possible, with each ordered to grasp his neighbour {{to prevent the}} men losing {{contact with each other}} in the darkness. As first light approached, the storm abated and the Brigade was on course, but the delays put them [...] from the line of hills. Wauchope's guide, Major Benson of the Royal Artillery, suggested to Wauchope that it was no longer safe to continue in closed formation and that the Brigade should deploy. Wauchope replied [...] "... I'm afraid my men will lose direction. I think we will <b>go</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> further." [...] Still in quarter column, the Highlanders advanced further towards the unknown enemy lines, when an advancing British soldier tripped an alarm on the fence in front of the Boer trench.|$|E

500|$|Dylan's contemporaries in 1965 {{were both}} startled and {{challenged}} by the single. Paul McCartney remembered going around to John Lennon's house in Weybridge to hear the song. According to McCartney, [...] "It seemed {{to go on and}} on forever. It was just beautiful... He showed all of us {{that it was possible to}} <b>go</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> further." [...] Frank Zappa had a more extreme reaction: [...] "When I heard 'Like a Rolling Stone', I wanted to quit the music business, because I felt: 'If this wins and it does what it's supposed to do, I don't need to do anything else...' But it didn't do anything. It sold but nobody responded to it in the way that they should have." [...] Nearly forty years later, in 2003, Elvis Costello commented on the innovative quality of the single. [...] "What a shocking thing to live in a world where there was Manfred Mann and the Supremes and Engelbert Humperdinck and here comes 'Like a Rolling Stone'".|$|E
500|$|Principal {{photography}} {{began in}} March 2011, using digital cinematography. Wirkola said, [...] "Hopefully – {{you can see}} what I’m inspired by: Raimi and Jackson. Actually I’m a big fan of [...] Spielberg and the way he shoots action scenes. I think in a lot of modern action movies, it’s hard to see what’s going on. Shaky cam… Hopefully what we strived for was to <b>go</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> retro in how you shoot action scenes." [...] The film was shot in 3-D and its real 3D shots were done by lead stereographer Florian Maier and his team from Stereotec. Wirkola said: [...] "We shot half of it in real 3D and the other half was post converted. Actually the 3D thing wasn’t there in the beginning. It was something the studio suggested later on. We embraced it and I think it actually really helps in getting people into this fairy tale world." [...] The filming process took three months. A 12-minute B-roll footage was later released on the Internet.|$|E
500|$|This {{episode is}} the first to deal with the concept of time travel, the next being [...] "The Constant" [...] in the fourth season. Unlike other {{flashback}} sequences to this point, this is positioned as actual time travel for Desmond. However, in this episode ground rules are established to prevent paradoxes in the story line as a result of time travel. Had these rules not been established, the writers feared that viewers would lose interest because the stakes of the characters would be lessened. In an interview, Henry Ian Cusick, who plays Desmond, said shooting the episode was both [...] "fun" [...] and [...] "tiring". Cusick said that when shooting the episode [...] "you're finishing late and starting early", but he enjoyed working with director Jack Bender because [...] "he pushes you to, to try and <b>go</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> bit further than you think you can". The London scenes were shot in Honolulu. This led to several continuity errors, such as a British Army recruitment poster for a Scottish regiment (which would not recruit in England) featuring the word [...] "Honour" [...] being incorrectly spelled in the American English [...] "Honor" [...] and a photograph of a British soldier using an American M4 carbine and urging people to join the [...] "military" [...] (instead of the [...] "army", as a British poster would say).|$|E

500|$|When conceiving {{ideas for}} The Last of Us, Druckmann used {{a concept that}} he created {{as a student at}} Carnegie Mellon University. His idea was to merge the {{gameplay}} of Ico (2001) in a story set during a zombie apocalypse, like that of Night of the Living Dead (1968), with a lead character similar to John Hartigan from Sin City (1991–2000). The lead character, a police officer, would be tasked with protecting a young girl; however, due to the lead character's heart condition, players would often assume control of the young girl, reversing the roles. He based The Last of Us on this concept, replacing the police officer with Joel, and naming the young girl Ellie. Druckmann wrote The Last of Us with the intention of having the story [...] "rooted firmly within reality", a stark departure from Naughty Dog's previous [...] "light and loose" [...] feeling. [...] "It needed to <b>go</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> darker [...] to explore a sadder theme," [...] he explained. Prior to directing the game, Druckmann took acting classes in order to [...] "talk to [...] in the same language". The game was released on June 14, 2013 to critical acclaim, with particular praise directed towards Druckmann's work on the story. He earned numerous awards for his work on the game, including a BAFTA, a DICE Award, a Game Developers Choice Award, a Golden Joystick Award, and a Writers Guild of America Award.|$|E
500|$|The long-running Hardy Boys Mystery Stories series {{ended in}} 2005 and was {{replaced}} with a reboot series, [...] In these volumes, the Hardys' adventures are narrated in the first person, each brother alternating chapters. This fresh approach to telling the adventures reveals two boys quite foreign to how they have been portrayed before, egotistical and jealous, and longtime readers will find few connections with the boys' previous personalities. The boys' Aunt Gertrude becomes [...] "Trudy", their mother Laura is given {{a career as a}} librarian, and their father is semi-retired. The boys are given their cases by a secret group known as ATAC, an acronym for American Teens Against Crime. In this new series, the Hardy Boys seem [...] "more like regular kids – who have lots of wild adventures – in these books, which also deal with issues that kids today might have thought about. For example, the second book in the series, Running on Fumes, deals with environmentalists who <b>go</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> too far to try to save trees." [...] The Hardys are also featured in a new graphic novel series, begun in 2005 and produced by Papercutz, and a new early chapter book series called The Hardy Boys: Secret Files, begun in 2010 by the publisher Simon & Schuster under their Aladdin imprint. The last Undercover Brothers books were released in January 2012 (main series) and July 2012 (Nancy Drew/Hardy Boys Super Mystery'07 series). [...] At the time of cancellation, there was one book that had been announced, but was ultimately shelved (The Case Of The MyFace Kidnapper); it is unknown whether {{this was going to be}} the final title of this unpublished book, since many bookstore websites and Simon & Schuster's website always had the letters [...] "W.T."

500|$|AM2 {{developed}} what Sega {{hoped would}} be the Dreamcast's killer app, Shenmue, a [...] "revenge epic {{in the tradition of}} Chinese cinema." [...] The action-adventure title involved the quest of protagonist Ryo Hazuki to avenge his father's murder, but its main selling point was its rendition of the Japanese city of Yokosuka, which included a level of detail considered unprecedented for a video game. Incorporating a simulated day/night cycle with variable weather, non-player characters with regular schedules, and the ability to pick up and examine detailed objects (also introducing the Quick-time event in its modern form), Shenmue went over budget and was rumored to have cost Sega over $50 million. Originally planned as the first installment in an 11-part saga, Shenmue was eventually downsized to a trilogy—and only one sequel was ever released.s development |publisher=Polygon |date=March 19, 2014 |accessdate=December 17, 2014 |quote=Yu Suzuki: The biggest challenge we encountered was project management.

It's the ultimate Dreamcast fanboy's pilgrimage, and as I took my first steps down Dobuita Street and recognized locations I'd walked past countless times before—Kurita's Military Store, Mary's Embroidery Store and the parking lot where Ryo honed his fighting skills—I couldn't help but <b>go</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> dewy eyed." [...] According to Moore, Shenmue sold [...] "extremely well", but the game had no chance of making a profit due to the Dreamcast's limited installed base. Shenmue II [...] "was completed for a much more reasonable sum", while Sato defended Shenmue as an [...] "investment [...] will someday be recouped" [...] because [...] "the development advances we learned... can be applied to other games". In addition to the mixed reception for Shenmue, IGN's Travis Fahs stated that [...] "the [...] era wasn't as kind to [...] as earlier years"—citing (among others) F355 Challenge as an [...] "acclaimed" [...] arcade title that [...] "didn't do much at home", and Genki's port of Virtua Fighter 3 as inferior to the arcade version, [...] "which was already a couple years old and never as popular as its predecessors."s view, buyers of modern coin-op conversions have the right to expect more from their investments than unenhanced facsimiles. |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141006102942/http://www.edge-online.com/review/virtua-fighter-3tb-review/ |archivedate=October 6, 2014 }} The Virtua Fighter series would experience a [...] "tremendous comeback" [...] with the universally acclaimed Virtua Fighter 4—which saw a console release exclusively on PS2.|$|E

Gaga's vocals span the nodes of A4 to D6 and it follows a basic sequence of B5–A5–E–B5–A5 as its chord progression. It is a pop rock song, which contains influences of other genres including country, disco, funk, and house. According to Mikael Wood from the Los Angeles Times, classifying the genre of the song is difficult, as it combines [...] "tinny Euro-house synths, slowed-down funk drums and a boot-scooting bass line straight out of Nashville." [...] The track has [...] "tongue-in-cheek" [...] lyrics, referencing cowboy in the opening verse: [...] "I just love a cowboy, I know it's bad, but I'm, like, can I just hang {{off the back of}} your horse and can you <b>go</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> faster?" ...|$|E
2500|$|Kelly {{survived to}} stand trial on 19 October 1880 in Melbourne before the Irish-born judge Justice Sir Redmond Barry.

The trial was adjourned to 28 October, when Kelly was presented on the charge {{of the murder of}} Sergeant Kennedy, Constable Scanlan and Lonigan, the various bank robberies, the murder of Sherritt, resisting arrest at Glenrowan and with a long list of minor charges. He was convicted of the willful murder of Constable Lonigan and was sentenced to death by hanging by Justice Barry. Several unusual exchanges between Kelly and the judge included the judge's customary words [...] "May God have mercy on your soul", to which Kelly replied [...] "I will <b>go</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> further than that, and say I will see you there where I go."

2500|$|Reports of {{the extent}} of the repressions caused an outcry among socialists abroad. Leaders of the Second International sent a {{resolution}} to the League of Nations condemning the Soviet government, but did not achieve any substantial results. Clara Zetkin, a notable German Social Democrat, attempted to counteract the negative publicity, visited Tiflis and then wrote a leaflet on Georgia, in which she claimed that only 320 persons had been shot. Nonetheless the public outcry resulted in unpleasant repercussions for the central government in Moscow, prompting the Politburo to set up a special commission, led by Ordzhonikidze, to investigate the causes of the uprising and the Cheka activities during its elimination. In October 1924, following the issuance of the commission's report, some members of the Georgian Cheka were purged as [...] "unreliable elements" [...] who were presumably offered up as scapegoats for the atrocities. Ordzhonikidze himself admitted before a meeting of the Central Committee in Moscow in October 1924 that [...] "perhaps we did <b>go</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> far, but we couldn't help ourselves.” ...|$|E

2500|$|The Legion of Super Heroes {{animated}} series premiered on Kids' WB! (the Saturday Morning kids' {{block on}} The CW network) in September 2006. The show's {{premise is that}} the Legion travels {{back in time to}} recruit Superman in their fight against crime in the 31st century, but they <b>go</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> too far back and recruit Superman before he has had a chance to fully develop his powers. Superman, the inspiration for the Legion, now has to learn from them how to be a hero. Season 1 focused on a [...] "core" [...] team consisting of Bouncing Boy, Brainiac 5, Lightning Lad, Phantom Girl, Saturn Girl, Superman, and Timber Wolf, while other Legionnaires such as Cosmic Boy, Colossal Boy, Ferro Lad, Matter-Eater Lad, and Triplicate Girl appeared occasionally. Classic Legion villains such as the Fatal Five, Starfinger, and the Sun-Eater were included, and other Legionnaires, including Blok, Dream Girl, Element Lad, Shrinking Violet, Star Boy, Sun Boy, and Tyroc, made cameo appearances. Season 2 takes place two {{years after the end of}} Season 1. New members, such as Chameleon Boy, have joined the Legion. Superman returns, older and wiser, as does Superman X, a clone from the 41st century, to battle Imperiex.|$|E
2500|$|Such sentiments also {{extend to}} members of the real Roman Catholic Church. Real priests and nuns sent their letters in {{alternately}} praising and condemning the series. In July–August 1997, the US Catholic League stated that [...] "it does object to the comic strip characters that appear in the Warrior Nuns comic strip, a product of Antarctic Press." [...] In another example Sister Mary Ann Walsh, a speaker for Washington, D.C.'s United States Conference of Catholic Bishops stated that Areala's costume is [...] "offensive. The habit is something sacred." [...] That is seen in early issues with how the upper half of the muscled, buxom Sister Shannon's ultra-low cut battle habit would show cleavage and/or show perpetually erect nipples through the cloth while the lower half consists of a loin cloth, if that much in other Warrior Nuns. It was a seeming contradiction in terms with how a nun's habit is meant to hide the body in order to discourage lust. In fact, Ben Dunn wrote that the reason he did that was that [...] "nipples sell". Regardless, Dunn stated the loin cloth is [...] "for mobility" [...] and that is the official in-continuity explanation that the modest Sister Shannon herself unapologetically espoused when confronted on her seeming lack of modesty. (This was resolved by having Sister Shannon's superior assign the Warrior Nuns new more modest battle habits that covered their breasts in the second series to replace the previous ones that she felt were [...] "a bit too revealing!") Dunn himself ultimately did say that perhaps [...] "I think I did <b>go</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> overboard" [...] in the earlier issues.|$|E
