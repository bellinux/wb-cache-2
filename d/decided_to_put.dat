5|$|After Marcoux {{had lost}} his vision, his brother Billy Joe (B.J.) Marcoux <b>decided</b> <b>to</b> <b>put</b> his college {{education}} on hold in order to assist him with skiing. Alpine Canada introduced them to {{a new kind of}} skiing called Para-Alpine. They were inspired by the McKeever brothers to do visually impaired para-alpine. Other than the Paralympics, his brother B.J. has been his sighted guide using radio communication ever since then; something they had never used before.|$|E
5|$|General Alexandre de Beauharnais <b>decided</b> <b>to</b> <b>put</b> Tarrare's {{abilities}} to military use, {{and he was}} employed as a courier by the French army, with the intention that he would swallow documents, pass through enemy lines, and recover them from his stool once safely at his destination. Unfortunately for Tarrare, he could not speak German, and on his first mission was captured by Prussian forces, severely beaten and underwent a mock execution before being returned to French lines.|$|E

5|$|The {{advisory}} board for Oregon Shakespeare Festival Portland was reformulated as {{the board of}} directors of the PCS, and Elizabeth Huddle was hired in May 1994 as the producing artistic director. Huddle had previously served on the PCS's search committee for a new artistic director, but <b>decided</b> <b>to</b> <b>put</b> her name in for consideration. In 1994 the PCS had a budget of US$2.2million, and over 11,000 subscribers.|$|E
5|$|Wagner began {{composing}} {{the music}} for Das Rheingold between November 1853 and September 1854, following it immediately with Die Walküre (written between June 1854 and March 1856). He began work on the third Ring opera, which he now called simply Siegfried, probably in September 1856, but by June 1857 he had completed only the first two acts. He <b>decided</b> <b>to</b> <b>put</b> the work aside to concentrate on a new idea: Tristan und Isolde, based on the Arthurian love story Tristan and Iseult.|$|E
5|$|As {{a result}} of battle damage and casualties, Langsdorff <b>decided</b> <b>to</b> <b>put</b> into Montevideo, where repairs could be {{effected}} and the wounded men could be evacuated from the ship. Most of the hits scored by the British cruisers caused only minor structural and superficial damage but the oil purification plant, which was required to prepare the diesel fuel for the engines, was destroyed. Her desalination plant and galley were also destroyed, which would have increased the difficulty {{of a return to}} Germany. A hit in the bow would also have negatively affected her seaworthiness in the heavy seas of the North Atlantic. Admiral Graf Spee had fired much of her ammunition in the engagement with Harwood's cruisers.|$|E

5|$|Collins {{has said}} that the main {{inspiration}} for The Hunger Games trilogy came from the classical account of Theseus and the Minotaur. In Greek mythology, as a punishment for the killing of King Minos's son Androgeos, Athens was forced to sacrifice seven youths and seven maidens to Crete, who were then put in the Labyrinth and killed by the Minotaur. After a while, Theseus, the son of the Athenian king, <b>decided</b> <b>to</b> <b>put</b> an end to the Minotaur and Minos's terror, so he volunteered to join the third group of victims, ultimately killing the Minotaur and leading his companions out of the monster's Labyrinth.|$|E
5|$|Dacey {{became a}} senior party {{figure in the}} late 1890s and began to work on {{political}} strategy to win support in suburban seats and from white-collar voters. He stood in opposition to his party's support for the Premiership of Sir George Reid and instead threatened to resign if the party did not switch its support to William Lyne's Protectionist Party. At a Labor Party conference in 1899, the party executive <b>decided</b> <b>to</b> <b>put</b> forward the protectionism/free trade debate to a referendum of all party members, despite Dacey's campaigning. Dacey's standing in the Labor Party continued to grow: he was the party's treasurer from 1901 to 1910 and on the Party Central Executive in 1912.|$|E
5|$|Early in the race, Trousselier, François Faber and Emile Georget {{were the}} main contenders. Trousselier, winner of the 1905 Tour de France and eager to win again, won the first stage. In the second stage, the Tour passed the French-German border to finish in Metz, which was then part of Germany. The German {{authorities}} allowed the cyclists to finish there, but did not allow the French flag to be flown or the cars of race officials to enter the city. At {{the end of the}} stage, Emile Georget seemingly beat Trousselier with a very small margin. After inquiry, Desgrange, the Tour's organiser, <b>decided</b> <b>to</b> <b>put</b> both cyclists in first place, to keep both sponsors satisfied.|$|E

5|$|Jeffrey Katzenberg had {{frequently}} {{suggested an}} animated {{adaptation of the}} 1956 film The Ten Commandments while working for The Walt Disney Company, and he <b>decided</b> <b>to</b> <b>put</b> the idea into production after founding DreamWorks in 1995. To make this inaugural project, DreamWorks employed artists {{who had worked for}} Walt Disney Feature Animation and the recently disbanded Amblimation, totaling a crew of 350 people from 34 different nations. The film has a blend of traditional animation and computer-generated imagery, created using software from Toon Boom Animation and Silicon Graphics.|$|E
5|$|Since no {{consensus}} could be reached, the committee <b>decided</b> <b>to</b> <b>put</b> these three definitions {{to a wider}} vote at the IAU General Assembly meeting in Prague in August 2006, and on August 24, the IAU put a final draft to a vote, which combined elements from {{two of the three}} proposals. It essentially created a medial classification between planet and rock (or, in the new parlance, small Solar System body), called dwarf planet and placed Pluto in it, along with Ceres and Eris. The vote was passed, with 424 astronomers taking part in the ballot.|$|E
5|$|Some of the {{gameplay}} {{elements were}} directly taken from Far Cry 3. Exotic locations, hunting, {{and the freedom}} for players to complete missions through different approaches were maintained in Far Cry 4. The team hoped that by incorporating and expanding upon on these ideas, while introducing new features, they could make Far Cry 4 an evolution for the series. As a result, {{the size of the}} game's outposts became larger and players were given more options to customize their weapons. The team also realized that players {{spent a lot of time}} interacting with the open world of Far Cry 3, and <b>decided</b> <b>to</b> <b>put</b> more effort and resources into the world's design and add more quests to the game.|$|E

5|$|The Orioles <b>decided</b> <b>to</b> <b>put</b> Davis {{at first}} base {{full-time}} in 2013 and worked on his defense in spring training; later, Oriole coaches and teammates believed this helped Davis succeed at the plate as well. He set a personal home run goal before the season but refused to share it. On April 5, Davis set a new Major League record with 16 RBI {{in the first four}} games of a season. He also became the fourth MLB player in history to hit a home run in the first four games of the season (Nelson Cruz, Mark McGwire, Willie Mays), including a grand slam against Tyler Robertson in the fourth game, a 95 victory over the Minnesota Twins.|$|E
5|$|Every {{night after}} shooting, editor Colin Goudie and his {{assistant}} Justin Hall would download the footage so the memory sticks could be cleared and {{ready for the next}} day. While new footage was being captured, the previously filmed footage was edited at the production team's hotel. After filming concluded, the crew had over 100 hours of footage. The original cut was over four hours long but was trimmed to 94 minutes after eight months of editing. Edwards originally had the ending of the film both at the beginning and the end. He and the film's producers disagreed about the placement, so he <b>decided</b> <b>to</b> <b>put</b> the chronological ending of the film {{at the beginning and end}} the film immediately after Andrew and Samantha kiss.|$|E
5|$|Reginald Brabazon, 12th Earl of Meath, {{founder and}} Chairman of the Metropolitan Public Gardens Association (MPGA), <b>decided</b> <b>to</b> <b>put</b> {{the weight of}} his {{organisation}} behind the campaign, and through a combination of public donations and donations from the London County Council, Corporation of London and Kyrle Society, raised the remaining £7,000 in less than six months. At this point a dispute broke out over who would be responsible for the maintenance of the park. The £5,000 offer from the Treasury was conditional upon the CPF reassigning to the Post Office the £200 annual maintenance grant that it currently gave to St Botolph's Aldersgate; the CPF maintained that it was happy to do so on condition that the Post Office maintain the park in place of St Botolph's Aldersgate, but that the Post Office was unwilling to do so. With all parties unable to agree on responsibility for maintenance, on 19 February 1898 the Treasury withdrew its offer altogether, leaving the appeal £5,000 short.|$|E

5|$|The Australians {{had learned}} about Katagiri's plans {{and as a result}} the 9th Division commander, Wootten, <b>decided</b> <b>to</b> <b>put</b> off his own {{offensive}} plans while the Japanese attack was dealt with. It came {{in the early hours of}} 17 October, and over the course of the following week heavy fighting ensued around Katika and Jivevaneng. Forewarned, the Australians were able to check these attacks with assistance from American support units, and by the time that the Japanese called off their offensive on 25 October, the Japanese 20th Division had suffered 352 men killed and 564 wounded, while the Australians had suffered 228 casualties. It was during the early stages of this fighting that an American soldier, Private Nathan Van Noy, from the 532nd Engineer Boat and Shore Regiment, performed the deeds that resulted in him being posthumously awarded the Medal of Honor.|$|E
5|$|The Crater Glacier (also {{known as}} Tulutson Glacier) is a geologically young glacier that {{is located on}} Mount St. Helens, in the U.S. state of Washington. The glacier formed after the 1980 Eruption and due to its location, the body of ice grew rapidly, unknown {{to the public for}} nearly 20 years. The glacier once {{contained}} ice caves in the smooth ice before the 2004-2008 volcanic activity. The growth of the lava dome and volcanic eruptions from 2004 to 2008 significantly altered the appearance of the glacier. In the same time period, several agencies <b>decided</b> <b>to</b> <b>put</b> an official name on the glacier which, at first, was Tulutson Glacier. A later decision made Crater Glacier the official glacier name. Despite the volcanic activity, the glacier continued to advance and by mid-2008, the glacier completely encircled the lava domes. In addition, new glaciers (rock or ice) have formed around Crater Glacier as well.|$|E
5|$|In August, the Viet Cong {{was back}} in action again; this time the 165th Regiment of the 7th Division {{targeted}} the Tong Le Chon Special Forces Camp, located southeast of the 1st Infantry Division's area of operations. Just after midnight on August 7, the 165th Regiment attacked Tong Le Chon {{and was able to}} penetrate the Special Forces Camp, but was forced to flee after an ammunition bunker exploded. That night the Viet Cong assaulted the base several times more, but on each occasion they were repelled by artillery fire and close air-support. By September, the scale of Viet Cong and North Vietnamese activities in III Corps had perplexed the U.S. commanders of Military Assistance Command, Vietnam. In the meantime, however, Hay <b>decided</b> <b>to</b> <b>put</b> an end to large-scale operations which had proven to be unproductive, until the enemy's real intentions were known. Instead, Hay continued to commit his 2nd Brigade to pacification efforts in southern Bình Dương Province, while the 3rd Brigade provided protection for engineers clearing Highway 13.|$|E
