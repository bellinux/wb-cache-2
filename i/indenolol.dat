We infused <b>indenolol</b> cumulatively (5, 15, and 50 micrograms/ 100 ml tissue per minute for 15 minutes each, preceded by an infusion of saline solution) into the brachial arteries of nine hypertensive patients. Forearm blood flow (venous plethysmography), mean arterial pressure, and heart rate were monitored. During infusion at 5 micrograms/ 100 ml tissue per minute, forearm blood flow did not change, but it did increase dose-dependently at the greater infusion rates. This action {{was determined to be}} mediated by beta-adrenoceptor stimulation because propranolol (10 micrograms/ 100 ml tissue per minute for 15 minutes), given before treatment and then concomitantly with <b>indenolol,</b> abolished it (n = 5). <b>Indenolol</b> vasodilated forearm arterioles and this effect was antagonized by beta-blockade, thus demonstrating vascular intrinsic sympathomimetic activity. This property may contribute to its therapeutic action in human beings...|$|E
40|$|PhDThe {{thesis is}} devoted to {{developing}} optimization of the chiral resolution and quantitation of some pharmaceutical compounds namely pindolol, donepezil, tertatolol, labetalol, nadolol and <b>indenolol,</b> using direct and indirect liquid chromatography. The developed methods were applied for determination of these drugs in rat plasma and in pharmaceutical products. The principles of the proposed procedures {{as well as the}} experimental parameters were studied, discussed, explained and the data obtained were statistically analyzed. The different experimental parameters that affected the development and the stability of the enantiomers were carefully studied. The results were statistically analyzed. The thesis is divided into six main parts: Part I: This part presents a general introduction about chirality and its major role in biological processes, the importance of chiral separations, the development of methods for enantiomers separation. It includes an overview on various chiral separation principles on chiral stationary phases with emphasis on macrocyclic antibiotic and polysaccharide chiral phases. Also chiral additives and indirect separation. Moreover, it involves an overview on the chiral separations of beta-blocker drugs and its significance. Part II: In this part, a sensitive and selective chiral HPLC method for separation and determination of pindolol enantiomers in rat plasma and in pharmaceutical formulations has been developed. The method was based on the resolution of pindolol enantiomers on Chiralpak (IB) chiral stationary phase and mobile phase composed of n-hexane: isopropanol: triethylamine (٥٠: ٥٠: ٠٫٥, v/v/v) with a flow rate of ١٫٠ ml/min and FL detection at ٢٦٦ nm for excitation and ٣٠٨ nm for emission. The method was linear in the range of ٢-٢٠٠ ng/ml in standard solution. The mean RSD of the results of within and intra-day precision and accuracy of the drug were ≤ ٦ %. The method was highly specific, where the coformulated compounds did not interfere. Part III: In this part, an enantioselective stability-indicating HPLC method was developed for the analysis of donepezil, in pharmaceutical formulations. The degradation behavior of donepezil was investigated under different stress conditions recommended by International Conference of Harmonization's (ICH). Resolution of the drug and complete separation from its degradation products are successfully achieved on Chiralcel-OJ-H column, mobile phase composed of ethanol: n-hexane: triethylamine, ٢٠:٨٠ :٠٫٣٠, (v/v/v), a flow rate of ١ ml/min and UV detector set at ٢٦٨ nm. The drug was found to degrade in alkaline, acidic, oxidative conditions and when exposed to heat. The drug was stable to sunlight. The method has also been successfully applied to pharmaceutical formulations. The method was highly specific, where the degradation products did not interfere. Part IV: This part presents a sensitive and a selective chiral HPLC method for separation and determination of tertatolol enantiomers in rat plasma and pharmaceutical products,the resolution of the tertatolol enantiomers was achieved on vancomycin chiral stationary phase and mobile phase composed of methanol: acetic acid:triethylamine (١٠٠: ٠٫٠١٠: ٠٫٠١٥, v/v/v) with a flow rate of ٠٫٨ ml/min and UV detector set at ٢٢٠ nm. The stability of tertatolol enantiomers at different degrees of temperature was studied. The method was linear in the range of ٥-٥٠٠ ng/ml and applide in plasma samples. The method also proved to be accurate, precise, and robust. Part V: This part presents the study of the efficiency of macrocyclic glycopeptidesbased column to separate all stereoisomers of multiple-stereogenic centres of some ßblockers (labetalol, nadolol and <b>indenolol.).</b> The condition affording the best resolution has been investigated by selection and variation of the mobile-phase compositions with a flow rate of ١٫٠ ml/min and UV detector set at ٢٥٠ nm for <b>indenolol</b> and ٢٣٠ nm for labetalol and nadolol. The compounds investigated (labetalol, <b>indenolol</b> and nadolol) showed baseline and/or partial separation on either Chirobiotic T or V, columns. Chirobiotic R column showed the poorest results, as none of the studied compounds could be resolved on it. Part VI: This part describes an optimization of the chiral resolution of tertatolol enantiomers after pre-column derivatization with ٢،٣،٤،٦-Tetra -O-acetyl- β-D glucopyranosyl isothiocyanate (GITC). The effect of concentration of GITC, reaction time, temperature, pH of mobile phase, type and ionic strength of the buffer on derivatization was studied. Also in this part the developed methods were evaluated with respect to precision, accuracy, linearity, LOD and LOQ. In all parts, the results obtained were statistically analyzed.

PART II: In this part, a sensitive and selective chiral HPLC method for separation and determination of propranolol enantiomers in rat serum and pharmaceutical formulations has been developed. The degradation behavior of propranolol was investigated under different stress conditions recommended by International conference of Harmonization's (ICH). Resolution of propranolol enantiomers from its degradation products are successfully achieved on cellulose tris(3, 5 -dimethylphenylcarbamate) CSP known as Chiralpak IB column.

The method was highly specific, where by the coformulated compounds did not interfere. Furthermore, molecular modeling studies including energy minimization, and docking studies were performed. First, to illustrate the mechanism by which the active enantiomer binds to the b-adrenergic receptor, second; to find a suitable interpretation of how both enantiomers are interacting with cellulose tris(3, 5 -dimethylphenyl carbamate) during the process of resolution depending on calculation of both the binding affinities and interaction distances between propranolol enantiomers and chiral selector.

40|$|The {{effects of}} nadolol (Nad), <b>indenolol</b> (Idn), {{metoprolol}} (Met), pindolol (Pid), arotinolol (Art, S- 596), and propranolol (Prp) on the cardiovascular system were studied noninvasively in healthy male volunteers. Exercise testing. with a bicycle ergometer was performed {{both before and}} after single oral administration of these β-blockers, and any changes in the exercise induced increase in heart rate systolic blood pressure product (ΔDP) were studied. Systolic time intervals were measured from the simultaneous recording of carotid pulse, phonocardiogram, and electrocardiogram at rest. Left ventricular dimensions were measured by echocardiography, and ejection fraction (EF), stroke index (SI), and cardiac index (CI) were calculated by the standard techniques. Systemic vascular resistance (SVR) was computed from these data. ΔDP was decreased with all β-blockers. According to the degree of this effect, the relative potency of these drugs was estimated to be as follows: Pid > Art> Idn≒Prp> Nad ≒ Met. The ratio of pre-ejection period to left ventricular ejection time was increased with all β-blockers. EF, SI, and CI were decreased by all β-blockers except Pid, by which SI and CI were kept almost unchanged, and EF was significantly increased. Therefore, Pid was thought to be less cardiosuppressive than the other β-blockers. SVR was significantly decreased by Pid, while it was increased by all the other β-blockers. These results suggest that the acute hemodynamic response to β-blockers is determined primarily by the property of intrinsic sympathomimetic activity. Neither β 1 -selectivity nor membrane stabilizing effect was shown to be a major factor modifying the central or peripheral hemodynamic response to β-blockers. rights ：日本臨床薬理学会rights ：本文データは学協会の許諾に基づきJournal archiveから複製したものであ...|$|E
