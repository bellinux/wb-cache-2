Evidence was obtained of an analytical error due to interaction between RF and antigenic determinants on the Fc {{part of the}} indicator immunoglobulin (Ig) molecules used. This was eliminated by replacing the usual <b>indicator</b> <b>reagent,</b> complete Ig molecules, by conjugated Fab or F(ab') 2 fragments. The findings imply that unless the RF-Fc interaction mentioned is avoided in the assaying technique, false positive results may be obtained for, e. g.

40|$|Summary: We have {{assessed}} {{a compact}} Blood Ammonia Checker System (Ammonia Checker) {{consisting of a}} reflectometer which measures the intensity of colour formed by blood ammonia on a bromocresol green <b>indicator</b> <b>reagent</b> plate. The results show good correlation (r = 0. 95) with our routine chemical method and a regression line y = 0. 835 — 1. 468. The Ammonia Checker has good precision (CV < 10 %) at the critical blood ammonia concentration and accurately measures predetermined ammonia concentrations. Blood sam-pling is improved with a precision pipette. The Ammonia Checker is simple, convenient and reliable and is ideally suited for a laboratory required to perform an urgent blood ammonia measurement.

40|$|A magnetic, {{selectively}} permeable metabolite transfer disk for the cell-free {{transfer of}} metabolites and other molecules produced by microbial colonies is described.

40|$|This work {{describes}} {{the development of}} a sequential injection system for the ammonium determination in transitional and coastal waters with a wide salinity range. Estuarine waters are rather complex matrices as their characteristics change considerably along the salinity gradient, as well as the ammonium levels. The developed system effectively solves these issues by converting ammonium into ammonia and using a gas diffusion unit (GDU) for matrix removal. The ammonium determination in a wide quantification range (0. 1 – 5. 0 mg L− 1) was obtained with small changes in the protocol sequence and was applied, not only to estuarine samples, but also well water samples (low salinity) and coastal waters (higher salinity). Spectrophotometry was the chosen detection system to measure the absorbance change in the bromothymol blue acid base indicator caused by the diffusion of ammonia through the GDU. Additionally, the developed system used a green chemistry approach, as there was no <b>indicator</b> <b>reagent</b> consumption per determination, still maintaining a good precision (relative standard deviation lower than 2 %) and a low detection limit, 27 μg L− 1 (1. 5 μM) ...|$|E
40|$|FOBT {{testing for}} {{colorectal}} cancer (11). He {{stated that the}} concept of occult blood detection is generally cred-ited to Van Deen, who in 1864 used gum guaiac, as an <b>indicator</b> <b>reagent.</b> Boas was the first to demonstrate its value for the detection of bowel malignancy (12) and Greegor was the first to stimulate interest in screening with the guaiac test (13). The guaiac FOBTs (GT) detect the peroxidase activity of heme either as intact hemoglobin or free heme. In the presence of heme and a developer (hydrogen peroxide) guaiac acid is oxidized producing a blue color. In screening for colorectal neoplasms a true positive GT is one which indicates bleeding from a colon cancer or polyp. All other positive results are considered to be false positive. Heme is present in red meat and peroxidase activity is present in fresh fruits and vegetables such as radishes, turnips and broccoli. These foods, therefore, have the potential to produce false-positive results. Some reports suggest that delay-ing development of GT cards for at least three days will decrease the number of false positives due to plant peroxidases and obviate the need for diet restriction o...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. Cowdria ruminantium is the {{etiologic}} agent of heartwater, a tick-transmitted foreign animal disease with considerable potential for {{entrance into the}} USA. A competitive enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (cELISA) was developed to detect serologic responses to C. ruminantium infection. The cELISA utilized a recombinant form of the C. ruminantium major antigenic protein (MAP-l) as the antigen and an anti-MAP- 1 monoclonal antibody as the competing <b>indicator</b> <b>reagent.</b> Experimental antisera to C. ruminantium and {{a wide variety of}} related ehrlichial organisms were used to evaluate cELISA reactivity. Only sera against C. rumin ntium, Ehrlichia canis, E. chaffeensis, and a recently discovered cervine ehrlichia-like organism reacted positively in the cELISA. Specificity of the cELISA was 299. 5 % in a survey of 1, 774 southeastern US and Puerto Rican slaughter cattle sera but was only 85 % in a group of 79 hunter-killed white-tailed deer (Odocoileus virginianus) from the southeastern USA. Reference true-positive and cELISA false-positive sera were further analyzed by end point titrations using the cELISA and by indirect fluorescent antibody (IFA) tests for reactivity with C. ruminantium, E. canis, and E. chaffeensis antigens. True heartwater-positive sera were significantly more reactive using the cELISA and C. ruminantium IFA procedures (P < 0. 05), whereas false-positive sera were significantly more reactive with the antigens used in the E. chaffeensis IFA procedure (P < 0. 05). A group of sera from 210 field-origin ruminants residing on known or potentially heartwater-endemic Caribbean islands revealed a sub...|$|E

40|$|Background: The two {{available}} {{drugs for}} treatment of T. cruzi infection, nifurtimox and benznidazole (BZ), have potential toxic side effects and variable efficacy, contributing to their low rate of use. With scant economic resources available for antiparasitic drug discovery and development, inexpensive, high-throughput and in vivo assays to screen potential new drugs and existing compound libraries are essential. Methods: In this work, we describe the development and validation of improved methods to test anti-T. cruzi compounds in vitro and in vivo using parasite lines expressing the firefly luciferase (luc) or the tandem tomato fluorescent protein (tdTomato). For in vitro assays, the change in fluorescence intensity of tdTomato-expressing lines was measured {{as an indicator of}} parasite replication daily for 4 days and this method was used to identify compounds with IC 50 lower than that of BZ.

40|$|Abstract   This paper {{presents}} a low-cost and disposable paper based microfluidic analysis system for point-of-care diagnostics. Detection {{is achieved by}} using a colorimetric or visual <b>indicator.</b> Immobilized specific <b>reagent</b> or enzymes designed for the parameter under consideration act as capture molecules {{on the surface of}} the detection zone. The sensor is integrated into a microfluidic system made of paper (cellulose). An additional component of the analysis system is a capillary unit which is used to introduce the analyte to the detection zone. For this purpose well- defined, millimeter-sized channel, comprising hydrophobic polymer bounded onto hydrophilic paper was created. Then the detection zone was coated with a sensitive reagent layer as a sensor region. The paper based microfluidics also called lab on paper, has been fabricated using screen printing technology as the basis for low-cost, disposable, portable and technically simple fabrication for mass production. Microfluidics in paper make it feasible to run single, dual or even multiple clinical analyses on one strip of paper while still using only small volumes of a single sample. The capability of lab on paper for detection of importance clinical analyte protein in urine, saliva and blood samples has been demonstrate successfully. Lab on paper as a diagnostic system is small, disposable, and easy to use and requires no external equipment, reagents, or power sources. This kind of diagnostic system is attractive for use in developing countries, in the field, or as a low-cost alternative to more-advanced technologies already used in clinical diagnostics.   Keywords: Lab-on-a-paper, Point-of-care, Visual detection, Clinical diagnostic, Disposable senso...|$|R
