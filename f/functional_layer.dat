50|$|Tube-like uterine glands, lined by ciliated {{columnar}} epithelium, {{are found}} in the <b>functional</b> <b>layer</b> of the uterine endometrium. Their appearance varies during the menstrual cycle. During the proliferative phase, uterine glands appear long due to estrogen secretion by the ovaries. During the secretory phase, the uterine glands become very coiled with wide lumens and produce a glycogen-rich secretion. This change corresponds with an increase in blood flow to spiral arteries due to increased progesterone secretion from the corpus luteum. During the pre-menstrual phase, progesterone secretion decreases as the corpus luteum degenerates, which results in decreased blood flow to the spiral arteries. The <b>functional</b> <b>layer</b> of the uterus containing the glands becomes necrotic, and eventually sloughs off during the menstrual phase of the cycle.|$|E
