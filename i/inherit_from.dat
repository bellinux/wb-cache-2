5|$|Before version 3.0, Python had {{two kinds}} of classes: old-style and new-style. The syntax of both styles is the same, the {{difference}} being whether the class object is inherited from, directly or indirectly (all new-style classes <b>inherit</b> <b>from</b> object and are instances of type). In versions of Python 2 from Python 2.2 onwards, both kinds of classes can be used. Old-style classes were eliminated in Python 3.0.|$|E
5|$|After the 1932 season, University of Chicago {{president}} Dr. Robert Maynard Hutchins {{forced out}} 70-year-old head coach Amos Alonzo Stagg, whom he considered {{too old for}} the position. Stagg {{then moved on to}} coach at the College of the Pacific. Athletic director T. Nelson Metcalf hired Shaughnessy to replace Stagg as head coach in 1933. Shaughnessy inherited a difficult situation at Chicago, and for the most part, lacked good material. He did, however, <b>inherit</b> <b>from</b> Stagg at least one important recruit: inaugural Heisman Trophy winner and future Hall of Fame back Jay Berwanger, whom many Midwest pundits considered the best back of the 1930s.|$|E
5|$|When sons of an epikleros came of age, {{they gained}} the {{ownership}} of the inheritance. In Athens, this age was given in an extant law, and was two years {{past the age of}} puberty of the son. In Solon's laws, it appears that the eldest son of the epikleros was considered the heir of his maternal grandfather, with any further sons being considered part of their father's household. The son's inheritance of his maternal grandfather's property happened whether or not his father and mother were alive, unlike most other inheritances. And the son of an epikleros did not inherit anything from his father, and was named after his grandfather. The heir could further consolidate his position by being posthumously adopted by his maternal grandfather, but this was not required. By the 4th century BCE, legal practices had changed, and the son could also <b>inherit</b> <b>from</b> his father, as well as from his maternal grandfather. And if there was more than one son, they divided the estate passed by the epikleros between themselves. After the heir secured possession of his inheritance, the law specified that he was to support his mother. It is likely that the debts of the grandfather were also inherited along with any property.|$|E
25|$|For human beings, {{the normal}} number of {{chromosomes}} is 46, of which 23 are <b>inherited</b> <b>from</b> each parent. Two chromosomes, the X and Y, determine sex.

25|$|Similar to Java, UnrealScript is {{object-oriented}} without {{multiple inheritance}} (classes all <b>inherit</b> <b>from</b> a common Object class), and classes are defined in individual files {{named for the}} class they define. Unlike Java, UnrealScript does not have object wrappers for primitive types. Interfaces are only supported in Unreal Engine generation 3 and a few Unreal Engine 2 games. UnrealScript supports operator overloading, but not method overloading, except for optional parameters.|$|E

25|$|Cohabitation {{is not a}} {{legal basis}} for inheritance, since {{partners}} {{are not included in}} the legal circle of heirs. Therefore, domestic partners may <b>inherit</b> <b>from</b> one another only when there is a last will and testament. The taxes on such an inheritance are higher than the taxes imposed on inheritances received by a legal spouse. Domestic partners inheriting through a will also have no right to a preserve part of the estate.|$|E
25|$|Some {{languages}} like Perl 6 or C# have {{a unified}} type system. This {{means that all}} C# types including primitive types <b>inherit</b> <b>from</b> a single root object. Every type in C# inherits from the Object class. Java has several primitive types that are not objects. Java provides wrapper object types that exist together with the primitive types so developers can use either the wrapper object types or the simpler non-object primitive types.|$|E

After Mary's death in a riding accident on 27 March 1482 near the Wijnendale Castle, Maximilian's aim was now to secure the inheritance to one of his and Mary's children, Philip the Handsome.|$|E

25|$|Encapsulation is the hiding of {{information}} to ensure that data structures and operators are used as intended {{and to make the}} usage model more obvious to the developer. C++ provides the ability to define classes and functions as its primary encapsulation mechanisms. Within a class, members can be declared as either public, protected, or private to explicitly enforce encapsulation. A public member of the class is accessible to any function. A private member is accessible only to functions that are members of that class and to functions and classes explicitly granted access permission by the class ("friends"). A protected member is accessible to members of classes that <b>inherit</b> <b>from</b> the class in addition to the class itself and any friends.|$|E

500|$|The {{large number}} of men who {{departed}} for the Byzantine Empire is indicated {{by the fact that}} the medieval Scandinavian laws still contained laws concerning voyages to Greece when they were written down after the Viking Age. The older version of the Westrogothic law, which was written down by Eskil Magnusson, the lawspeaker of Västergötland 1219–1225, stated that [...] "no man may receive an inheritance (in Sweden) while he dwells in Greece". The later version, which was written down from 1250 to 1300, adds that [...] "no one may <b>inherit</b> <b>from</b> such a person as was not a living heir when he went away". Also the old Norwegian Gulaþingslög contains a similar law: [...] "but if (a man) goes to Greece, then he who is next in line to inherit shall hold his property".|$|E
500|$|Following a {{recommendation}} {{from the first}} plenary council of Australia and New Zealand in 1885, in May 1887 Pope Leo XIII elevated the Diocese of Adelaide to an Archdiocese and metropolitan see.

[...] Upon his appointment, O'Reilly travelled to Adelaide, where {{he met with the}} Archbishop of Adelaide Christopher Reynolds and the Cardinal of Sydney Patrick Moran to discuss the formation of the new diocese. [...] The poor financial state of the Archdiocese made the discussions contentious, with O'Reilly concerned about the amount of debt Port Augusta would <b>inherit</b> <b>from</b> Adelaide.

Sophia Peacock, a sister of his wife, was closely involved in Russell's up-bringing and Moore developed romantic feelings for her; in 1858, he changed his will to give her his property instead of Russell, but Sophia rejected his marriage proposal and he disinherited her the following year. Despite Moore's [...] "vehement objections", his daughter married George Edward Corrance in 1860. After a year she eloped with Colonel Edward William de Lancy Lowe; they married in 1866, after Corrance divorced her on grounds of adultery. Her father [...] "had always reason to be dissatisfied with her conduct" [...] and, three months before his death, he made a new will and bequeathed all of his property to Peacock. After Moore's death, Russell Lowe and her paternal uncle, Rev. Edward Moore opened a court case to contest the will. In March 1868, the courts found that the will was legal. Sophia Peacock inherited nearly all of Moore's estate.|$|E
500|$|For {{the finale}} of the manga, Kishimoto {{originally}} intended to give Boruto the Byakugan, an eye technique which he would <b>inherit</b> <b>from</b> his mother Hinata Hyuga. However, the author forgot about it and instead gave him an unknown eye technique (it allows him to see chakra, an energy source within ninjas to perform jutsu) which is often shown on Boruto's right eye. During July 2017, one of the animators from [...] revealed Boruto's eye is called [...] and that its powers {{are related to the}} Byakugan and Naruto's ability to sense negative emotions. However, the animator refrained from explaining more about since the Jōgan would be explained later in the series. In the first few pages of the first chapter, Boruto's first encounter against Kawaki was briefly shown. The purpose was to attract more fans so they could look forward to the battle as it has a chaotic state to it. Due to the staff of the Naruto anime referring to Naruto and Sasuke as [...] "legendary characters", anime developers Pierrot aim to carefully portray Boruto and his friends, the [...] "new generation", as the new protagonists. They also seek to have them developed as the previous generation. However, Kishimoto is concerned about how Boruto and his friends could reach Naruto and Sasuke's strength as he finds it repetitive.|$|E
500|$|In Gortyn, epikleroi {{were also}} called patroiokos, {{and they were}} more generously treated than in Athens. The term patroiokos can be {{literally}} translated as [...] "having the father's property", and was {{a description of the}} condition of the heiress. She was considered a patroiouchoi if she had no father or brother by her father living. The relative who had the right to marry her was called a epiballon, and the list of who were eligible for that status was also limited to just her paternal uncles and the sons of those uncles. If there were no candidates fitting those conditions, the patroiouchoi was free to marry as she chose. If she wished, a patroiouchos could free herself from the obligation to marry her nearest relative by paying him part of her inheritance. If her nearest relative did not wish to marry her, she was free to find a spouse in her tribe, or if none was willing, then she could marry whomever she wished. Gortyn may owe the liberality of its heiress laws {{to the fact that it}} was one of the few city-states known to have allowed daughters to inherit even if they had brothers; daughters in Gortyn received half the share of a son. To prevent the abuse of the system, there was a time limit on the right of the closest epiballon to marry her, and if the limit expired, the right passed to the next nearest epiballon until the patroiouchoi was either married or ran out of possible epiballontes. There was a limit, however, that a man could only marry one heiress. Unlike in Athens, the heiress owned her inheritance and her son did not inherit until she died. Her son was also eligible to <b>inherit</b> <b>from</b> his father.|$|E
