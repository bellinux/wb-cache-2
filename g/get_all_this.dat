6000|$|... "Lawsy!" [...] says Mrs. Sampson. [...] "It {{sounds like}} an {{irrigation}} ditch you was describing, Mr. Pratt. How do you <b>get</b> <b>all</b> <b>this</b> knowledge of information?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "'But {{how will}} I <b>get</b> <b>all</b> <b>this</b> mud off my shell?' Mr. Turtle asked, {{speaking}} quite distinctly for {{a fellow who}} had his mouth full of crow's leg.|$|E
50|$|Niall Hayes doesn't {{know how}} to get what he wants in life. His cousin Richard takes {{everything}} Niall desires: a place in his father's firm and the girl he loves. How he <b>gets</b> <b>all</b> <b>this</b> is the crux of his story.|$|R
60|$|<b>Getting</b> <b>all</b> <b>this</b> {{out in one}} breath, my indignation now stifled me. Him of {{the shirt}} said nothing at all. The peasant laughed. I demanded the bill. It was twenty-five francs odd. I picked up every farthing of the change.|$|R
6000|$|... "And I {{hold you}} every time," [...] Smoke panted back. [...] "That's what I'm here for, just to hold you. Where {{do you think}} Shorty's <b>getting</b> to <b>all</b> <b>this</b> time?" ...|$|R
6000|$|Margaret Duffe got {{up slowly}} from her desk. She pushed her chair {{automatically}} back. [...] "Let me <b>get</b> <b>all</b> <b>this</b> straight. You mean the bomb is finished? Ready to go?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "With disapproval. Who {{are those}} Puritans {{you are talking}} about? But wait--how {{did you come to}} know so much about this family? Where did you <b>get</b> <b>all</b> <b>this</b> hearsay evidence?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "You {{had better}} take {{the good things}} that come to you, then; and not grumble. How I have worked to <b>get</b> <b>all</b> <b>this</b> {{arranged}} for you, and now what thanks have I?" ...|$|E
50|$|You know Asian parents, man; they’re gnarly. They {{want you}} to become some lead pianist in an {{orchestra}} or, like every parent, they {{want you to}} become a doctor. I was really into art when I was a young kid, and I won a lot of awards, so my parents thought that’s what I’d pursue. Then I got picked up in skateboarding and started getting free stuff. They were tripping, like, “Where are you <b>getting</b> <b>all</b> <b>this</b> free stuff?” They thought I was stealing money from them.|$|R
6000|$|... "It's angels' food to me," [...] he retorted, as he {{eyed the}} dainty napkins {{and the silver}} spoons and forks. [...] "You don't know what this means {{to a man who}} lives on rice and prunes and kittle bread. I have a guilty feeling; I do, indeed. Seems like I'm <b>getting</b> <b>all</b> <b>this</b> thanksgiving treat under false pretenses. Perhaps you think I'm an English nobleman in disguise. But I'm not--I'm just a plain dub of a forest ranger, ninety dollars a month and board myself." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Name it--name it, at once, for Heaven's sake, Mr. Guert. The dishes must be <b>getting</b> cold, <b>all</b> <b>this</b> time," [...] cried Mr. Worden, {{jumping up}} with alacrity, and looking about him, for {{his hat and}} cloak.|$|R
6000|$|... "If only {{we could}} <b>get</b> <b>all</b> <b>this</b> lot out of Mur," [...] he said, with a sweep of his hand, [...] "we should be the most famous men in Europe {{for at least three}} days, and rich into the bargain." ...|$|E
60|$|It all {{amounts to}} this, that lawyers want clients {{and are not}} {{particular}} {{about the kind of}} clients that they <b>get</b> <b>All</b> <b>this</b> is very ugly work, and a public interest that can not be served without it would better be unserved.|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{never heard}} such {{nonsense}} in my life, Ruth!" [...] he exclaimed. [...] "I have watched Wingrave closely, and I have seen {{no trace of}} anything of the sort. Nonsense! It is worse than nonsense! You must be getting hysterical. You must <b>get</b> <b>all</b> <b>this</b> rubbish out of your head. To tell you the truth--" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Can {{you talk}} faster, sir? [...] <b>Get</b> over <b>all</b> <b>this</b> quicker? fix your eyes [...] On mine, I pray you, and whate'er you see [...] Still go on talking fast, unless I fall, [...] Or bid you stop.|$|R
6000|$|... "I knew {{we should}} <b>get</b> it <b>all</b> by <b>this</b> witness!" [...] exclaimed Cuffe, unable to {{suppress}} the relief he felt at obtaining the required testimony.|$|R
6000|$|... 'I don't {{think at}} all about it,' said Ethel, {{something}} in her father's manner. 'If we are to <b>get</b> through <b>all</b> <b>this,</b> Mary, it must not be by riding out on perhapses. Now let us put Daisy's things together, for she must have as little communication with home as possible.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "No, mother, {{he would}} like to, but he dare not, and I cannot support you as I should wish, as here I have no house or property. You will <b>get</b> <b>all</b> <b>this</b> by taking a walk and holding your tongue. You see this man here, he is Fahni, king of a great tribe, the Ogula. He wants you to carry a message for him, and by and by he will marry you, won't you, Fahni?" ...|$|E
60|$|But, {{so far as}} I {{could gather}} by the best {{information}} that I could <b>get,</b> <b>all</b> <b>this</b> hubbub came through the words that the Recorder said when he told them that, in his judgment, the Prince's answer was a messenger of death. It was this that fired the town, and that began the fright in Mansoul; for Mansoul in former times did use to count that Mr. Recorder was a seer, and that his sentence was equal {{to the best of}} orators; and thus was Mansoul a terror to itself.|$|E
6000|$|... 'Thank you, old friend; it will {{be better}} for her in every way. I am not a good hand at making conversation, and {{it will be}} the thing of all others for Dorothy; she always {{chatters}} away with you more than with anyone else, and I can assure you that I feel your coming a perfect god-send. She scarcely said a word coming down this morning, and though I tried occasionally to talk about our trip, she only answered with an evident effort. I am afraid it will take some time to <b>get</b> <b>all</b> <b>this</b> out of her mind.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "It {{is rather}} a hard case," [...] said Beechnut, [...] "no doubt, {{but never mind}} it, Jemmy. A man may break his leg, and yet live to dance many a hornpipe afterwards. You'll <b>get</b> over <b>all</b> <b>this</b> and laugh about it one day. Come, I'll carry you home in my wagon." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "And now, Sophy," [...] I said, [...] "tell me {{all about}} yourself; {{where have you been}} living, and how have you been <b>getting</b> on <b>all</b> <b>this</b> time, and what are your plans for the future? Your little child, too, Sophy? What has become of it? You have not lost it, have you?" ...|$|R

6000|$|Of {{all these}} {{accounts}} {{the one which}} is most deserving of study is [...] "Raymond." [...] This is so {{because it has been}} compiled from several famous mediums working independently of each other, and has been checked and chronicled by a man who is not only one of the foremost scientists of the world, and probably the leading intellectual force in Europe, but one who has also had a unique experience of the precautions necessary for the observation of psychic phenomena. The bright and sweet nature of the young soldier upon the other side, and his eagerness to tell of his experience is also a factor which will appeal to those who are already satisfied as to the truth of the communications. For all these reasons it is a most important document--indeed it would be no exaggeration {{to say that it is}} one of the most important in recent literature. It is, as I believe, an authentic account of the life in the beyond, and it is often more interesting from its sidelights and reservations than for its actual assertions, though the latter bear the stamp of absolute frankness and sincerity. The compilation is in some ways faulty. Sir Oliver has not always the art of writing so as to be understanded of the people, and his deeper and more weighty thoughts get in the way of the clear utterances of his son. Then again, in his anxiety to be absolutely accurate, Sir Oliver has reproduced the fact that sometimes Raymond is speaking direct, and sometimes the control is reporting what Raymond is saying, so that the same paragraph may turn several times from the first person to the third in a manner which must be utterly unintelligible to those who are not versed in the subject. Sir Oliver will, I am sure, not be offended if I say that, having satisfied his conscience by the present edition, he should now leave it for reference, and put forth a new one which should contain nothing but the words of Raymond and his spirit friends. Such a book, published at a low price, would, I think, have an amazing effect, and <b>get</b> <b>all</b> <b>this</b> new teaching to the spot that God has marked for it--the minds and hearts of the people.|$|E
6000|$|... "Too late! How too late? Anna, {{you must}} {{tell me what}} you mean. I insist upon it that you {{tell me what you}} mean. Why is it too late?" [...] But Lady Anna was not {{prepared}} to tell her meaning. She had certainly not intended to say anything to her mother of her solemn promise to Daniel Thwaite. It had been arranged between him and her that nothing was to be said of it till this law business should be all over. He had sworn to her that to him it made no difference, whether she should be proclaimed to be the Lady Anna, the undoubted owner of thousands a year, or Anna Murray, the illegitimate daughter of the late Earl's mistress, a girl without a penny, and a nobody in the world's esteem. No doubt they must shape their life very differently in this event or in that. How he might demean himself should this fortune be adjudged to the Earl, as he thought would be the case when he first made the girl promise to be his wife, he knew well enough. He would do as his father had done before him, and, he did not doubt,--with better result. What might be his fate should the wealth of the Lovels become the wealth of his intended wife, he did not yet quite foreshadow to himself. How he should face and fight the world when he came to be accused of having plotted to <b>get</b> <b>all</b> <b>this</b> wealth for himself he did not know. He had dreams of distributing the greater part among the Lovels and the Countess, and taking himself and his wife with one-third of it to some new country in which they would not in derision call his wife the Lady Anna, and in which he would be as good a man as any earl. But let all that be as it might, the girl was to keep her secret till the thing should be settled. Now, in these latter days, it had come to be believed by him, as by nearly everybody else, that the thing was well-nigh settled. The Solicitor-General had thrown up the sponge. So said the bystanders. And now there was beginning to be a rumour that everything was to be set right by a family marriage. The Solicitor-General would not have thrown up the sponge,--so said they who knew him best,--without seeing a reason for doing so. Serjeant Bluestone was still indignant, and Mr. Hardy was silent and moody. But the world at large were beginning to observe that in this, as in all difficult cases, the Solicitor-General tempered the innocence of the dove with the wisdom of the serpent. In the meantime Lady Anna by no means intended to allow the secret to pass her lips. Whether she ever could tell her mother, she doubted; but she certainly would not do so an hour too soon. [...] "Why is it too late?" [...] demanded the Countess, repeating her question with stern severity of voice.|$|E

5000|$|Clinton Heylin {{claims that}} Dylan wrote a rough outline of [...] "Ballad in Plain D" [...] {{soon after the}} events. In May 1964, {{he stayed in the}} Greek village of Vernilya, working on songs for his next album; there he drew out the {{material}} to the lengthy ballad he recorded in June 1964. Heylin writes [...] "It took thirteen cathartic verses to <b>get</b> <b>all</b> <b>this</b> out of his system, without Dylan ever transcending his material. 'Plain D' remains an exercise in painful autobiography." ...|$|E
5000|$|The attack {{leveraged}} an SQL injection to gain privileged root {{access to}} VTech servers. Once privileged access was acquired, the attacker exfiltrated the data, including some 190 gigabytes {{of photographs of}} children and adults, detailed chat logs {{between parents and children}} which spanned over the course of years and voice recordings, all unencrypted and stored in plain text. The attacker shared some 3,832 image files with the journalist for verification purposes, and some redacted photographs were published by the journalist. Commenting on the leak, the unnamed attacker expressed their disgust with being able to so easily obtain access to such a large trove of data, saying: [...] "Frankly, it makes me sick that I was able to <b>get</b> <b>all</b> <b>this</b> stuff. VTech should have the book thrown at them” and explained their rationale for going to the press was because they felt VTech would have ignored their reports and concerns.|$|E

[...] "In the first place, they would not {{impoverish}} themselves if they knew that there was no way of building up their fortune again, and in the next place, if they did ruin themselves they would have to either set to work to earn an honest living or blow out their brains, if they have any to blow out. I can assure you that I don't feel at <b>all</b> exultant at <b>getting</b> <b>all</b> <b>this</b> money, and I think that my father was quite right in wishing that I should know nothing about it until I married; but, on the other hand, I am heartily glad, more glad than I can say, Mark, that you have come into your share." ...|$|R
