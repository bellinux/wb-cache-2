40|$|The Sicily is {{the first}} region for orange {{cultivation}} in Italy. This sector, throughout the ages, has been characterized by a decrease of the invested areas and by a reduction of the fresh product’s demand; in the meantime, the competitiveness of the new producer countries is increased for a better commercial organization and for lower production costs. The aim of the paper {{is to improve the}} knowledge of orange cultivation in Ribera area, in the province of Agrigento (Sicily). It is carried out a microeconomic analysis on a sample of 20 farms to determine profitability of orange cultivation by means of various economic indicators (production costs, profits, net incomes). The business survey has regarded 30 plants, distinguished by the two principal variety of the area: Brasiliano and Naveline. The cropping techniques generally adopted in the farm sample are characterized by high manual labour inputs. This doesn’t depend by the variety, but it’s due to a low mechanization degree of the plants and to a different businessman management. Microeconomic analysis has showed similar average values of the production costs among the two variety. The profit average value, whereas, has resulted more elevated in the Naveline plants than Brasiliano ones, because of the high value of the <b>Gross</b> <b>Saleable</b> <b>Product</b> of Naveline oranges. The net incomes values, finally, are resulted higher in the direct management plants. With regard to commercial aspects, the most part of the farm product has been destined to the national market through some commercialization centres located in the Ribera area. ...|$|E
40|$|From 1978 the Global Positioning System, {{needed for}} sensing the {{position}} of military targets (e. g. buildings, machinery), was developed as a pure military system, while in 1983 it was made available also for public use. Therefore, {{at the beginning of}} 80 s precision agriculture, requiring GPS for sensing the position to which any measured field parameter must be geo-referenced, was implemented {{for the first time in}} US. In fact, soil and crop parameters are spatially variable in a field, so that spatially uniform rate crop input applications cause increased environmental impact and crop input waste. In order to reduce the environmental impact and optimise the use of crop inputs, precision agriculture was born: it is the geo-referenced application of crop inputs, whose rates must be those required by the crop. At present a profitable implementation of precision agriculture, depending on the crop <b>Gross</b> <b>Saleable</b> <b>Product,</b> can be achieved only in medium-large farms. As a consequence, precision agriculture is widespread only in large areas of US, Germany, Denmark, Netherlands and United Kingdom. In the future precision agriculture could be implemented on a larger scale if the following requirements will be satisfied: to quantify its environmental and economic benefits; to develop common vehicle bus standards (e. g. CAN-bus) on agricultural machines, sensors for mapping soil and crop parameters and user-friendly software for processing and interpreting the measured data; to use devices compatible among each other and an integrated user-friendly software for all the spatially variable field operations; to develop soil-crop simulation models, in order to identify the causes of within-field spatial variability and, therefore, adjust the crop input rates from the next growing season...|$|E

40|$|Trials were {{performed}} with red beet and white cabbage in 1998 - 2001 {{to assess the}} effects on yields and nutrient utilization of surface mulch (chopped grass and/or red clover). No other nutrients were applied. Nitrogen (N), phosphorus (P) and potassium (K) contents were measured in mulch, <b>saleable</b> <b>products</b> and above-ground plant residues. A single mulch application of about 12 Mg DM ha- 1 increased the yields of both crops significantly.

However, the average apparent recoveries of mulch derived nutrients in above-ground plant parts (calculated by subtraction of uptakes in the control treatment) were only 13 %, 14 % and 18 % of N, P and K, respectively. Some 3 - 10 % of the N supplied in mulch was found as mineral N at 0 - 60 cm soil depth after harvest, and in late autumn {{approximately half of the}} P and all the K supplied was found as P-AL or K-AL (ammonium lactate and acetic acid) plus acid-soluble K in the topsoil.

40|$|Cone crushers {{are used}} in the mineral, mining, and {{aggregate}} industry for fragmentation of rock materials. Control systems for cone crusher settings are widely used for compensating for wear and protecting the machines from high pressure. However, these systems focus on the crusher and not the crushed products. By applying measurement devices on the process the crusher can be run optimally from the <b>saleable</b> <b>products</b> point of view (unlike most existing systems which only protect the machine) in each time. The measurement devices can be mass flow meters, e. g. conveyor belt scales. To analyze data from the process and convert them to a desired CSS value, an algorithm was developed. The developed algorithm is tested and evolved at a real crushing plant for aggregates. The algorithm was loaded into a computer which could communicate with the crusher control system, read data from three mass flow meters, and also interact with the operators. The computer was reachable over the Internet by the researchers at Chalmers and the algorithm was tuned and improved on-line. The result is an algorithm which was capable of providing CSS set-points to the automatic setting regulation system. The amount of <b>saleable</b> <b>product</b> from the crushing stage improved 3. 5 %, when not limited by the hydraulic pressure, compared to when a fixed closed side setting is used. The use of the algorithm automatically compensates for changes in the feed material and it also decreases the need for calibration of the underlying system...|$|R

The rate of a chemical reaction, for instance, may be determined not so much by chemical kinetics as by the mechanical process of mixing the reagents (the reacting components) within the reactor if these are not freely miscible. Fluid and solid mechanics may therefore dominate even the chemical reaction stage (b) of production in some instances...|$|R

50|$|In chemistry, {{fractional}} crystallization {{is a method}} of refining substances based on differences in solubility. It fractionates via differences in crystallization (forming of crystals). If a mixture {{of two or more}} substances in solution are allowed to crystallize, for example by allowing the temperature of the solution to decrease or increase, the precipitate will contain more of the least soluble substance. The proportion of components in the precipitate will depend on their solubility products. If the solubility products are very similar, a cascade process will be needed to effectuate a complete separation. This technique is often used in chemical engineering to obtain very pure substances, or to recover <b>saleable</b> <b>products</b> from waste solutions.|$|R

5|$|Commercially {{available}} iron {{is classified}} based on purity and {{the abundance of}} additives. Pig iron has 3.5–4.5% carbon and contains varying amounts of contaminants such as sulfur, silicon and phosphorus. Pig iron is not a <b>saleable</b> <b>product,</b> but rather an intermediate step {{in the production of}} cast iron and steel. The reduction of contaminants in pig iron that negatively affect material properties, such as sulfur and phosphorus, yields cast iron containing 2–4% carbon, 1–6% silicon, and small amounts of manganese. Pig iron has a melting point in the range of 1420–1470K, which is lower than either of its two main components, and makes it the first product to be melted when carbon and iron are heated together. Its mechanical properties vary greatly and depend on the form the carbon takes in the alloy.|$|R
