5|$|A tidal {{disruption}} {{event of}} this sort is when a star interacts with a supermassive black hole shredding the star, {{and in some cases}} creating a relativistic jet which produces bright emission of gamma ray radiation. The event GRB 110328A (also denoted Swift J1644+57) was initially argued to be produced by the <b>disruption</b> <b>of</b> a main sequence star by a black hole of several million times the mass of the Sun, although it has subsequently been argued that the <b>disruption</b> <b>of</b> a white dwarf by a black hole of mass about 10 thousand times the Sun may be more likely.|$|E

5|$|<b>Disruption</b> <b>of</b> the Commonwealth {{governance}} {{caused by}} the liberum veto was highly significant.

5|$|In skeletally {{immature}} individuals, {{the blood}} supply to the epiphyseal bone is good, supporting both osteogenesis and chondrogenesis. With <b>disruption</b> <b>of</b> the epiphyseal plate vessels, varying degrees and depth of necrosis occur, resulting in a cessation of growth to both osteocytes and chondrocytes. In turn, this pattern leads to disordered ossification of cartilage, resulting in subchondral avascular necrosis and consequently OCD.|$|E
5|$|Since Aberdeen's re-emergence {{as one of}} the {{top teams}} in Scotland, Aberdeen's rivalry with Celtic has {{increased}} both competitively and between supporters.

5|$|Since {{the rings}} of Uranus {{appear to be}} young, they must be {{continuously}} renewed by the collisional fragmentation of larger bodies. The estimates show that the lifetime against collisional <b>disruption</b> <b>of</b> a moon with the size like that of Puck is a few billion years. The lifetime of a smaller satellite is much shorter. Therefore, all current inner moons and rings can be products of <b>disruption</b> <b>of</b> several Puck-sized satellites during the last four and half billion years. Every such disruption would have started a collisional cascade that quickly ground almost all large bodies into much smaller particles, including dust. Eventually the majority of mass was lost, and particles survived only in positions that were stabilized by mutual resonances and shepherding. The end product of such a disruptive evolution would be a system of narrow rings. However, a few moonlets must still be embedded within the rings at present. The maximum size of such moonlets is probably around 10km.|$|E

40|$|It {{is universally}} {{recognized}} that biological rhythms in the frail elderly with {{disorders such as}} dementia are liable to disruptions; however, studies exploring the characteristic features of biological rhytims in the elderly and the factors causing <b>disruptions</b> <b>of</b> the rhytims in the frail elderly, especially those in need of care and residing in nursing homes are still few. We conducted the present study to examine {{the characteristics of the}} biological rhytlms and the factors causing <b>disruptions</b> <b>of</b> the rhythms in 50 residents of special nursing homes for the elderly (9 men and 41 women) using a contmuous portable instrument. The results revealed disrupted 24 -hr rhytims in 22 subjects (44 %), nearly half of the study subjects.

Seventeen residents (34 %) showed considerable decrease in the activities of daily living.

5|$|Vision is {{the main}} sense of {{orientation}} in humans, and the primary function of camouflage is to deceive the human eye. Camouflage works through concealment (whether by countershading, preventing casting shadows, or <b>disruption</b> <b>of</b> outlines), mimicry, or possibly by dazzle. In modern warfare, some forms of camouflage, for example face paints, also offer concealment from infrared sensors, while CADPAT textiles in addition help to provide concealment from radar.|$|E
5|$|All work {{to put the}} I-185 into {{production}} was cancelled afterwards, even with the M-82 engine, as they were all required for the La-5 fighter. Another reason cited was that the La-5 used the fuselage of the Lavochkin-Gorbunov-Goudkov LaGG-3 which was already in production in three plants and would involve less <b>disruption</b> <b>of</b> the production lines. Another factor may have been that the La-5 required less duralumin to build, something in short supply at the time.|$|E
5|$|Because of {{the remote}} {{location}} of the Itcha Range, future eruptions are not a major hazard. Future volcanism is most likely {{in the form of}} basaltic cinder cones, but eruptions of felsic magma can not be ruled out. The most immediate hazard relating to future eruptions is of local concern only and includes the possibility of forest fires by lava flows and the <b>disruption</b> <b>of</b> local air traffic if an eruption column is produced. Volcanic ash reduces visibility and can cause jet engine failure, as well as damage to other aircraft systems.|$|E
