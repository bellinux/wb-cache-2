5|$|If {{the bike}} and rider are {{considered}} to be a single system, the forces that act on that system and its components can be roughly divided into two groups: internal and external. The external <b>forces</b> <b>are</b> due to gravity, inertia, contact with the ground, and contact with the atmosphere. The internal <b>forces</b> <b>are</b> caused by the rider and by interaction between components.|$|E

5000|$|President Ronald Reagan in 1985 said [...] "the <b>Force</b> <b>is</b> with us", {{referring}} to the United States, to create the Strategic Defense Initiative. The Gospel According to Star Wars asserts that {{his use of the}} phrase was actually perverting Star Wars's [...] "self-dispossessing" [...] (or other-focused) ethos. The blessing [...] "May the <b>Force</b> <b>be</b> with you" [...] is the expression of a hope for others ("May the <b>Force</b> <b>be</b> with you"), not for ourselves as with Reagan ("The <b>Force</b> <b>is</b> with us"). Moreover, the Star Wars blessing is precisely a request for hope for others ("May the <b>Force</b> <b>be</b> with you"), whereas Reagan's claim sounds like a possessive assertion ("The <b>Force</b> <b>is</b> with us").|$|R

5|$|For certain {{physical}} scenarios, it {{is impossible}} to model forces as being due to gradient of potentials. This is often due to macrophysical considerations that yield forces as arising from a macroscopic statistical average of microstates. For example, friction is caused by the gradients of numerous electrostatic potentials between the atoms, but manifests as a force model that is independent of any macroscale position vector. Nonconservative forces other than friction include other contact forces, tension, compression, and drag. However, for any sufficiently detailed description, all these <b>forces</b> <b>are</b> the results of conservative ones since each of these macroscopic <b>forces</b> <b>are</b> the net results of the gradients of microscopic potentials.|$|E
5|$|Many of {{the ideas}} in The Satanic Bible are shaped around a secular, {{scientific}} view of the world. However, some of these ideas continue beyond present-day secularism by implying that various occult <b>forces</b> <b>are</b> not supernatural, but rather thus far undiscovered by science.

5|$|Presently, most armed <b>forces</b> <b>are</b> {{composed}} {{of people from}} different ethnic backgrounds.

While there are many examples of polyethnic forces, the most prominent are among the largest armed forces in the world, including those of the United States, the former USSR and China. Polyethnic armed <b>forces</b> <b>are</b> not a new phenomenon; multi-ethnic forces have been in existence since the ancient Roman Empire, Middle Eastern Empires and even the Mongol Khans.

5|$|Since <b>forces</b> <b>are</b> {{perceived}} as pushes or pulls, this {{can provide an}} intuitive understanding for describing forces. As with other physical concepts (e.g. temperature), the intuitive understanding of forces is quantified using precise operational definitions {{that are consistent with}} direct observations and compared to a standard measurement scale. Through experimentation, it is determined that laboratory measurements of <b>forces</b> <b>are</b> fully consistent with the conceptual definition of force offered by Newtonian mechanics.|$|E

50|$|<b>Force</b> <b>is</b> {{the action}} of one body on another. A <b>force</b> <b>is</b> either a push or a pull. A force tends to move a body in the {{direction}} of its action. The action of a <b>force</b> <b>is</b> characterized by its magnitude, by the direction of its action, and by its point of application. Thus, <b>force</b> <b>is</b> a vector quantity, because its effect depends on the direction {{as well as on the}} magnitude of the action.|$|R

5|$|With modern {{insights}} into quantum mechanics and technology that can accelerate particles {{close to the}} speed of light, particle physics has devised a Standard Model to describe forces between particles smaller than atoms. The Standard Model predicts that exchanged particles called gauge bosons are the fundamental means by which <b>forces</b> <b>are</b> emitted and absorbed. Only four main interactions are known: in order of decreasing strength, they are: strong, electromagnetic, weak, and gravitational. High-energy particle physics observations made during the 1970s and 1980s confirmed that the weak and electromagnetic <b>forces</b> <b>are</b> expressions of a more fundamental electroweak interaction.|$|E

5|$|All of {{the forces}} in the {{universe}} are based on four fundamental interactions. The strong and weak <b>forces</b> <b>are</b> nuclear forces that act only at very short distances, and {{are responsible for the}} interactions between subatomic particles, including nucleons and compound nuclei. The electromagnetic force acts between electric charges, and the gravitational force acts between masses. All other forces in nature derive from these four fundamental interactions. For example, friction is a manifestation of the electromagnetic force acting between the atoms of two surfaces, and the Pauli exclusion principle, which does not permit atoms to pass through each other. Similarly, the forces in springs, modeled by Hooke's law, are the result of electromagnetic forces and the Exclusion Principle acting together to return an object to its equilibrium position. Centrifugal <b>forces</b> <b>are</b> acceleration forces that arise simply from the acceleration of rotating frames of reference.|$|E

5|$|Historically, {{forces were}} first quantitatively {{investigated}} in conditions of static equilibrium where several forces canceled each other out. Such experiments demonstrate the crucial properties that <b>forces</b> <b>are</b> additive vector quantities: they have magnitude and direction. When two forces act {{on a point}} particle, the resulting force, the resultant (also called the net force), can be determined by following the parallelogram rule of vector addition: the addition of two vectors represented by sides of a parallelogram, gives an equivalent resultant vector that is equal in magnitude and direction to the transversal of the parallelogram. The magnitude of the resultant varies from the difference of the magnitudes of the two forces to their sum, depending on the angle between their lines of action. However, if the <b>forces</b> <b>are</b> acting on an extended body, their respective lines of application must also be specified in order to account for their effects on {{the motion of the}} body.|$|E

50|$|Therefore, in {{the absence}} of a {{magnetic}} field, the <b>force</b> <b>is</b> in the direction of the electric field, and the magnitude of the <b>force</b> <b>is</b> dependent on the value of the charge and the intensity of the electric field.
