The results of the 4 C code prediction of the quench propagation up to the current dump are presented first, based on simulations performed before the tests.

40|$|For the {{optimisation}} of {{a magnet}} design with cable-in-conduit conductor (CICC) technology {{it is essential}} to comprehend the scaling of the critical current from the separate strand characteristics to the finally assembled cable performance in a coil. Several model coils have been tested in the framework of research for the International Thermonuclear Experimental Reactor (ITER). At present, the scaling of the critical current from the strand to the full cable performance and the apparent decrease of the n-index from strand to cable in the voltage–current curves is not understood. It is important to recognize the mechanisms behind this phenomenon in relation to the cost of the superconducting strand, which is significant in the manufacture of the magnets. Therefore, basic phenomena like the cable conductor self-field, the current unbalance introduced by the non-uniformity of the joints and a possible reversible or irreversible degradation of the voltage current characteristic of a strand during cable manufacture or electromagnetic loading of the magnet have to be considered. The voltage–current characteristic of the strand is extensively explored for the relevant range of magnetic field, temperature and axial strain space. Accordingly a numerical six-element network model is developed to simulate the conditions and behaviour of the last stage cable elements of a full-size ITER conductor. The experimental data, mainly in terms of voltage–current (VI) or -temperature (VT) characteristics, are obtained on the central solenoid insert coil (CSIC) experiment performed in <b>Naka</b> (<b>Japan)</b> in the framework of the research for ITER. The numerical model, which is briefly introduced, is used to study the cable performance by using experimentally obtained cable parameters like inter-strand (and bundle) contact resistance, strand critical current data as a function of magnetic field, temperature and applied axial strain, and external cable self-field measurements by Hall sensors for reconstruction of the current non-uniformity. The effect of a current redistribution due to the cable self-field on the voltage–temperature curve is calculated in correlation with the transverse resistance between the strands and last cabling stage bundles (petals). A realistic unbalanced current distribution is established by introducing non-uniform joints at the extremities of the CS-insert cable. It appears that the cable self-field effect hardly gives any change {{in the shape of the}} VT curve but merely a shift towards lower temperature giving a reduction of the current sharing temperature Tcs (10 μV/m) of < 0. 1 K. For typical CICCs with Cr-coated Nb 3 Sn strands, there is practically no current redistribution due to the cable self-field, because of the high inter-strand contact resistance. An unbalanced current distribution also gives an earlier voltage rise in the VT curve, mainly at low levels of the electric field. At a 10 μV/m criterion practically no reduction of the Tcs (< 0. 1 K) is found by the numerical simulation. However, in the CSIC the experimentally obtained overall reduction in Tcs from strand to cable is 0. 7 K for an operating current of 40 kA at 12. 5 T background field. According to the results of the numerical simulation, the cable self-field effect and the non-uniform current distribution, which is unavoidably caused by the joints, cannot explain the early voltage rise and low n-index in the VT curve of the CS-insert coil. It is very likely that electromagnetic forces play a role in causing reversible degradation in critical current or even irreversible due to strand (filament) damage. Neither can it be excluded that strand deformation during cabling has an impact on the final conductor performance as well. Therefore additional effort is required in detailed 3 D modeling of the possible strand deformations inside a cable and the impact it has on the strand performance by experimental verification on strand level...|$|R
40|$|The {{research}} activity {{done during the}} three years Joint Doctorate in Fusion Science and Engineering was focused on negative ion sources and dedicated to numerical investigations of beam optics, experimental measurements and development of improvements for experimental devices. In particular, I carried out investigations on plasma source behavior and beam extraction under different operational conditions, paying special attention to beam optics improvement and co-extracted electron suppression efficiency, as well as analysing and developing solutions by means of numerical codes such as SLACCAD and OPERA, supported by dedicated post-processing by MATLAB scripts. I investigated the beam properties for three negative ion beam sources: SPIDER and NIO 1 at Consorzio RFX (Padova, Italy) and NITS at National Institute for Quantum and Radiological Science and Technology (QST, <b>Naka,</b> <b>Japan).</b> SPIDER is the full-scale prototype of the negative ion source for ITER negative ion beam injectors (NBIs) {{and is in the}} advanced construction and assembly phase, so no further design improvements could have been done. SPIDER is provided with several peculiar design solutions: I have numerically assessed the efficiency of such solutions related to beam optics with 40 beamlets (half SPIDER beamlet group). I participated in the joint experiments of Consorzio RFX and QST in the NITS facility. The aim of this collaboration was to prove experimentally, for the first time, the effectiveness of a specific magnetic field configuration adopted for ITER NBIs requiring the use of the so-called ADCM magnets to correct the residual magnetic deflection of the beamlets induced by the (CESM) magnets devoted to deflect the co-extracted electrons. In particular my contribution was to design the new extraction grid and the new magnets (both CESM and ADCM) to be installed on the source. I also cooperated to the data analysis. Lastly, for the NIO 1 source, I participated in the experimental sessions since the beginning, and I gave my contribution to the spectroscopic characterization of the source and to beam optics characterization. These experimental observations suggested some upgrades needed for optics improvement. Hence, I moved in this direction designing a new extraction grid and new magnet configurations. Furthermore, the successful experimental evidences at NITS have made us confident to introduce ADCM also in NIO 1. This design work was performed in strict collaboration with Laboratori Nazionali di Legnaro (LNL, Legnaro, Italy). Unfortunately, these upgrades will be not installed on the source before spring 2017 and thus no experimental evidences of beam optics improvements are available yet. Concerning the thesis manuscript, it is constituted by five chapters, followed by an additional summary. Here is a brief summary of the chapter contents. In the first chapter I give an introduction on Fusion and ITER, highlighting the need for the use of NBIs in future fusion devices and the general issues related to MITICA, which is the full size prototype of ITER NBI. In the second chapter there is a general description of the theoretical considerations related to the physics of plasma in the source, beam extraction and optics, and main components constituting the ion sources. The final part of the chapter is dedicated to the presentation of the numerical tools available at Consorzio RFX: SLACCAD, EAMCC, COMSOL and OPERA. Concerning the latter, since it is the most important numerical tool I used during my PhD, I dwell more on the possibilities it can offer and I provide also a sensitivity study in order to increase the calculation precision. While the first two chapters have essentially introductory purposes, the last three present the actual activities I performed on the three ion sources, SPIDER, NITS and NIO 1, as briefly described so far. In particular each of the three chapters is focused on the activity done on just one machine. Lastly, two appendixes supplement this thesis concerning further activities, which are loosely related to the rest. These are the development of an Excel GUI, in Visual Basic language, to simplify the interaction with NIO 1 database (Appendix A) and investigations on the energy recovery system efficiency that NIO 1 will feature in the future, an activity carried out in collaboration with CNR institute of Bari (Appendix B). ...|$|R
