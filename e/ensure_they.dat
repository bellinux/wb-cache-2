Unlike many other primates, male orangutans {{do not seem}} to practice infanticide. This may be because they cannot <b>ensure</b> <b>they</b> will sire a female's next offspring because she does not immediately begin ovulating again after her infant dies.|$|E

5|$|At the Battle of Breitenfeld, in 1631, Adolphus {{proved the}} {{effectiveness}} of the changes made to his army, by defeating Johann Tserclaes, Count of Tilly. Although severely outnumbered, the Swedes were able to fire between three and five times as many volleys of artillery, and their infantry's linear formations helped <b>ensure</b> <b>they</b> didn't lose any ground. Battered by cannon fire, and low on morale, Tilly's men broke ranks and fled.|$|E
5|$|At the University of Texas, {{ticket sales}} {{likewise}} were rapid. On {{the first day}} of sales, Texas' ticket office received 10,500 orders. The demand was so great that some students camped overnight in front of the ticket office to <b>ensure</b> <b>they</b> would receive a ticket. Despite that initial surge in orders, as late as December 27, four days before the game, tickets were still readily available. In terms of chartered flights and the number of fans spending money at New Orleans businesses, Texas also trailed Virginia Tech.|$|E

5|$|The online mode of the game, {{which is}} only {{available}} in the Japanese version, also introduces {{a group called the}} Restrictors, the former leaders of Deepground before Weiss took over. The Restrictors' leader had implanted microchips into the brainstems of all Deepground soldiers so as to <b>ensure</b> <b>they</b> never turn against the group. However, Weiss was able to overcome this control method, and the Tsviets wrenched control from the Restrictors.

5|$|A {{special session}} of the {{legislature}} in 1965 changed the Senate to represent 16 districts and reapportioned the seats, again by county, but did so {{in such a way}} as to make the representation more proportional to population than it had been. Thus, the eastern shore, which had previously elected nine Senators, elected only four after 1965. This was done to preserve the ideal of having whole counties represented by a single Senator, rather than breaking counties up into multiple districts. A constitutional amendment in 1972 expanded the Senate to 47 members, elected from districts proportional to the population. These districts are reapportioned every ten years based on the United States Census to <b>ensure</b> <b>they</b> remain proportional.|$|E
5|$|After {{a failure}} to {{assimilate}} Indigenous children by early missionaries in the 17th century, educational programs were not widely attempted again by religious officials until the 1820s, prior {{to the introduction of}} state-sanctioned operations. Included among them was a school established by John West, an Anglican missionary, at the Red River Colony in what is today Manitoba. Protestant missionaries also opened residential schools in the current Ontario region, spreading Christianity and working to encourage Indigenous peoples to adopt subsistence agriculture as a way to <b>ensure</b> <b>they</b> would not return to their original, nomadic ways of life upon graduation.|$|E
5|$|After riding {{at anchor}} for two weeks, Endeavour was heaved {{out of the}} water on 9 November and laid on her side for repairs. Some damaged timbers were found to be infested with shipworms, which {{required}} careful removal to <b>ensure</b> <b>they</b> did not spread throughout the hull. Broken timbers were replaced and the hull recaulked, scraped of shellfish and marine flora, and repainted. Finally, the rigging and pumps were renewed and fresh stores brought aboard for the return journey to England. Repairs and replenishment were completed by Christmas Day 1770, and the next day Endeavour weighed anchor and set sail westward towards the Indian Ocean.|$|E

The {{first attempt at}} putting Michigan through a trial was conducted at the navy's traditional testing grounds off Rockland, Maine beginning on 9 June 1909. Although the ship completed its standardization run, other tests were disrupted when it ran aground on a sand bar. Although Michigan was pulled off without incident, the navy soon discovered that both propellers required repair, delaying {{the completion of the}} trials until 20–24 June. The battleship was commissioned several months later on 4 January 1910—making the United States the third country to have a dreadnought in commission, behind the United Kingdom and Germany, but just ahead of Brazil's —and its shakedown cruise lasted until 7 June.|$|E
5|$|All ballots, {{absentee}} ballot envelopes, and voting machines were impounded under a court injunction sought by state Republicans. Under the court order, {{absentee ballot}}s were counted in central locations rather than individual precincts. Of the 10,000 absentee ballots {{sent out to}} voters, 6,000 were returned. Absentee ballots mailed within the United States had to be received by April 7 to be counted. The deadline for overseas (including military) ballots was extended to April 13 after the United States Department of Justice sued the state to <b>ensure</b> <b>they</b> would have a reasonable chance of being counted. Counting of the absentee ballots due by April 7 began on April 8 under a New York State Supreme Court ruling sought by Murphy's campaign.|$|E
