He had not yet issued a {{determination}} of cause of death in any of the cases, leaving them classified as [...] "undetermined".The case against Pou and the two nurses appeared more questionable after Minyard announced that he had classified the patient deaths at Memorial as [...] "undetermined," [...] which means that on available evidence he could not classify the deaths as due to homicide or natural causes. Minyard told the media that he had retained some of the nation's leading experts as consultants in the case.The New York Times reported in August 2009 that Minyard privately {{came to the conclusion that}} Pou was responsible for the deaths of four of the nine patients: “I strongly do not believe she planned to kill anybody, but <b>it</b> <b>looks</b> <b>like</b> <b>she</b> did.” ...|$|E
50|$|Meanwhile House sits in Anica's {{room and}} notices a strange odor. After {{sniffing}} Anica's pillow and bra, {{he realizes that}} she has an infection and stops the treatment. There was no fever because the Cushing's suppressed her immune system. Cameron's dosing her with antibiotics to prove her theory also suppressed symptoms that would've shown it earlier. House stops the irradiation, leads the team into the nuclear room and nicks Anica's torso, which gives the blade a fruity smell. The bruises that Cushing's gave her made a home for bacteria (Clostridium perfringens). She's treated for her infection and accepts out-patient treatment for her Münchausen's because her talk with House helped her {{come to terms with}} it, but <b>it</b> <b>looks</b> <b>like</b> <b>she</b> may have relapsed later. Cuddy offers Foreman the job of being head of diagnostics permanently but when he decides to take the offer she refuses because House's actions convinced her that keeping House in the job is the best thing to do, angering Foreman.|$|E

5000|$|... #Caption: The Spinning Dancer is a kinetic, {{bistable}} {{optical illusion}} resembling a pirouetting female dancer. Some observers initially see the figure as spinning clockwise and some anticlockwise. Additionally, some {{may see the}} figure suddenly spin in the opposite direction. The illusion derives from an inherent ambiguity {{from the lack of}} visual cues for depth. There are other optical illusions that originate from the same or similar kind of visual ambiguity, such as the Necker cube. If you focus on one part of her body, such as her foot and the shadow, it is possible to switch back and forth by focusing on the opposite motion that she is currently performing with her foot. When trying to switch from clockwise to counterclockwise wise I have found focusing on the shadow of her foot for a couple seconds allows you to see the opposite direction. And in some cases when able to switch back and forth with ease <b>it</b> <b>looks</b> <b>like</b> <b>she</b> is waving her leg back and forth and has lost the spinning effect entirely[...]|$|E

This is then followed by additional footage where after Jack begs Jill to let him explain, she urges him to do so. Jack pauses for a moment, clearly unsure as to what hes going to say next, indicating that his following story is a complete fabrication. In the extended ending, after Jack finishes speaking, Jill produces a picture of him in their bed while engaged in a threesome with two other women. She asks him to explain that as well to which Jack nonchalantly says, [...] "You know, theres an even better story for that." ...|$|E
