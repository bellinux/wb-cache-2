That's what started it off. We <b>just</b> <b>liked</b> <b>the</b> name [...] "Crusader".

5|$|In general, {{the term}} duality {{refers to a}} {{situation}} where two seemingly different physical systems {{turn out to be}} equivalent in a nontrivial way. If two theories are related by a duality, it means that one theory can be transformed in some way so that it ends up looking <b>just</b> <b>like</b> <b>the</b> other theory. The two theories are then said to be dual to one another under the transformation. Put differently, the two theories are mathematically different descriptions of the same phenomena.|$|E
5|$|<b>Just</b> <b>like</b> <b>the</b> {{evolution}} of Philippine music, dance as well {{has been in}} constant change. Prior to colonial rule, the Philippines has {{a wide array of}} ethnic dances from different tribal groups. This is due mainly to the fact that Philippines is an archipelago thus the different varieties of dance developed. Both Luzon and Visayas, at first, were more akin to tribal movements until the Spanish came. Mindanao represents more of an array of Muslim inspired dances and Spanish influence was minimal in the region of Zamboanga.|$|E

5|$|<b>Just</b> <b>like</b> <b>the</b> many uses of plasma, {{there are}} several means for its generation, however, one {{principle}} is common to all of them: there must be energy input to produce and sustain it.

5|$|The current fifth {{edition of}} the Stanford–Binet scales (SB5) was {{developed}} by Gale H. Roid and published in 2003 by Riverside Publishing.

5|$|The first Caspian raid of the Rus' {{occurred}} {{sometime in}} the reign of Hasan ibn Zaid, ruler of Tabaristan between 864 and 884. The Rus' sailed into the Caspian Sea and unsuccessfully attacked its eastern shore at Abaskun. This raid was probably on a very small scale. The second raid took place in 909 or 910 and was likewise aimed at Abaskun; <b>just</b> <b>like</b> <b>the</b> previous attack, this expedition was a minor one with only sixteen ships participating in it. The third minor raid took place in 911 or 912.|$|E

5|$|The {{mating season}} lasts from May through July, during the cold, rainy season, {{resulting}} in birth and peak lactation {{coinciding with the}} time that fruit is the most plentiful. The gestation period of ruffed lemurs is the shortest of the family Lemuridae, averaging 102 days (with a range of 90 to 106 days). Gestation in the wild last slightly longer than in captivity, averaging 106 days. <b>Just</b> <b>like</b> <b>the</b> mating season, parturition is also seasonal, synchronized {{to the end of}} the cold, dry season and the start of the productive hot, rainy season.|$|E
5|$|Wales next won the Five Nations {{outright}} in 1975, and in 1976, Wales {{won their}} second Grand slam of the decade. <b>Just</b> <b>like</b> <b>the</b> first in 1971, they only used 16 players over their four matches.

5|$|For the Chemical Troops (Nebeltruppen) each {{decontamination}} battery (Entgiftungs-Batterie) {{was authorized}} six Sd.Kfz. 10/1 and six Sd.Kfz. 10/2. Eighteen Sd.Kfz. 10/3 {{were held at}} the battalion level for issue to the batteries in lieu of their Sd.Kfz. 10/2s if needed. If necessary they could be substituted for Sd.Kfz. 11s of the appropriate type. When the decontamination units were authorized to be re-equipped with heavy rocket launchers in November 1941 seven Sd.Kfz. 10/1s were used to tow the 28/32 cm Nebelwerfer 41 launchers and another {{was used by the}} platoon leader to tow an anti-tank gun. Similarly decontamination units usually retained their Sd.Kfz. 10/2s and used them <b>just</b> <b>like</b> <b>the</b> 10/1s after removing their special equipment. However, it seems that the 10/3s were turned in when the unit was reorganized.|$|E
5|$|In Kohala, the {{numerous}} dikes near the summit inhibit groundwater from seeping downslope to the northeast, where it naturally wants to go. Rather, the Kohala dike complex guides it northwest or southeast, down {{the axis of}} the rift zones, <b>just</b> <b>like</b> <b>the</b> surface water. On the other hand, the three smaller valleys between the large ones - Honopue, Honokea, and Honokane Iki - {{as well as the}} many smaller gulches which are not yet valleys, are deprived of groundwater by the orientation of the rift zone and its dikes. Without the large amount of water that is received by the bigger valleys, these valleys grow far more slowly. Due to its topography as essentially a flat crater floor surrounded by cones and fault scarps, the main caldera is affected relatively little by erosion from water.|$|E
5|$|In {{the opening}} scene of the episode, Peter, Joe and Quagmire are shown {{watching}} television at the Drunken Clam, when an infomercial featuring Rat Pack members Frank Sinatra, Sammy Davis, Jr., and Dean Martin is shown, featuring several songs with racially offensive lyrics. Immediately after, the group believes that they see their old friend, Cleveland, who moved to Virginia, across the bar, but are disappointed when it is revealed to be a lamp. Peter {{then goes on to}} express his desire to finally replace Cleveland, stating that their group is <b>just</b> <b>like</b> <b>the</b> Muppets character Statler without Waldorf.
