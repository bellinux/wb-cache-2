Anees ul Mehdi iii Description logics (DLs) provide expressiveness much beyond the expressive-ness of propositional logic while still maintaining decidability of reasoning. This makes DLs a natural choice for formalizing actions. Besides DLs are also used in several application domains. However representing dynamic aspects of such application domains {{is not out of}} question. As a result, temporal ex-tensions of DLs have been investigated in literature. In formalizing actions, sometimes we come across a situation, where we want to be sure of a property to hold at a certain time. Thus a suitable approach is of using temporalize...|$|R

Recently, this tractability boundary has been clarified by identifying DL constructors that causes intractability of subsumption when added to EL and that do not. These results provide us with a characterization of the complexity of subsumption for the EL family of DLs (i. e., EL and its extensions). Besides subsumption, there are other standard reasoning problems studied in DL. Among them, the instance checking problem is the most basic reasoning problem that is concerned with deriving implicit knowledge about individuals in a DL knowledge base...|$|R

Recently, {{it has been suggested}} that the expressive power of DLs with concrete domains can be further extended by adding database-like key constraints.
