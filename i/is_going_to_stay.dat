Andy Bernard (Ed Helms), who is still away in the Caribbean after sailing his family's boat, emails Erin and says that he <b>is</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>stay</b> for a few weeks. Hurt, Erin decides to watch Die Hard with Pete rather than just hear him quote it. While watching the movie, Erin begins to cry and Pete tries to comfort her by placing his arm around her. In the meantime, Toby Flenderson (Paul Lieberstein) tells Nellie Bertram (Catherine Tate) about the Scranton Strangler case he was on. After boring her for what is implied to be several hours, she hushes him, before gently kissing him. Toby then whips off his glasses and kisses her back.|$|E

2500|$|Nikita [...] "Nikki" [...] Singh {{is played}} by Anannya Kolvankar, and is the title {{character}} and the second-youngest Singh child. She is generally portrayed as being happy. It sometimes takes a few tries {{to get her to}} do the right thing. Many of the Singh family's adventures revolve around Nikki. Both her older brothers, Rohan and Sunny, are often seen using Nikki for their own benefit, although Rohan shows that he cares about her deeply. Sunny seems to dislike Nikki the most although, in some episodes, he is seen being quite fond of her. Himani thinks of Nikki as the perfect baby. It was revealed in [...] "Nikki is 1!" [...] that it was Dolly's idea to nickname her Nikki. Nikki speaks more often in later episodes of seasons two and three. Bobby was born on her birthday; she responded to this by [...] "I like this present." [...] In season three, her personality begins to develop, as she is seen as sneaky and mischievous, such as pretending to like a doll Himani bought for her to like Bobby, then throwing it away when she was not looking, and also telling Himani's [...] "friends" [...] what she really thinks of them, causing her to lose them all. Also, she is shown as not liking Bobby as in the episode [...] "The Extravagant Couch", when she asks Avatar if Bobby <b>is</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>stay</b> at the hotel and he says no and Nikki asks if they can talk about it. In Good Luck Charlie, Nikki is the equivalent of Charlie Duncan who {{is played by}} Mia Talerico.|$|E
