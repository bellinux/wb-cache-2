5|$|<b>Front</b> <b>brake</b> failure.|$|E
5|$|In 1981, Yamaha {{introduced}} a new square-four cylinder bike, similar to Suzuki's RG500. Roberts raced to a second-place finish behind Marco Luchinelli at the non-championship Imola 200 race. Roberts' bike had a suspension failure in the Grand Prix season opener at Austria, but he rebounded to win the next two races in Germany and Italy. Roberts' title hopes suffered a setback at the Dutch TT at Assen when his Yamaha's <b>front</b> <b>brake</b> pads were installed incorrectly causing his front wheel to lock up on the starting line, ending his race before it had started. He came back to score a second place behind Lucchinelli in Belgium, but was once again struck by misfortune when {{a bad case of}} food poisoning forced him to miss the San Marino Grand Prix. He then narrowly lost the British Grand Prix to Jack Middelburg by three-tenths of a second before ending his season with a seventh place in Finland and a retirement in Sweden. Suzuki team riders Mamola and Lucchinelli battled to the final race of the season before the Italian claimed the championship with a total of five Grand Prix victories, with Mamola finishing in second and Roberts in third place.|$|E

5000|$|The <b>front</b> <b>brakes</b> are two-piston design, {{while the}} single rear caliper houses four pistons. Both <b>front</b> <b>brakes</b> are {{activated}} {{by the right}} hand lever. The rear brake is activated by the foot pedal on the right.|$|R
50|$|The chassis with MacPherson strut {{front and}} {{multilink}} rear suspension was {{common to all}} S13 and RS13 models. The European 200SX initially had 257mm <b>front</b> <b>brakes</b> and rear disc service brakes with drum parking brakes in the rotor hubs. Later models had larger 280mm <b>front</b> <b>brakes.</b>|$|R
5000|$|The <b>front</b> <b>brakes</b> {{are solid}} disks, and the rears are drum brakes. The AE86 has {{ventilated}} <b>front</b> disk <b>brakes</b> on the GT-Apex, GT-S, GT-V, and GT models, but has solid rear disks. The North American AE86 SR-5 also features solid <b>front</b> disk <b>brakes,</b> with drum type brakes at the rear.|$|R
25|$|It was a {{race car}} version of the Gallardo LP 570-4 for the Lamborghini Blancpain Super Trofeo series, with {{adjustable}} aerodynamic devices, a ten-position rear wing, improved <b>front</b> <b>brake</b> cooling over the 2012 Gallardo via remodeled brake ducts.|$|E
25|$|It is {{customary}} {{to place}} the <b>front</b> <b>brake</b> lever on the left in right-side-driving countries, and vice versa, because the hand on the side nearer {{the centre of the}} road is more commonly used for hand signals, and the rear brake can not pitch the bicyclist forward.|$|E
25|$|The Mustang GT {{features}} a stiffer, better handling {{version of the}} standard suspension, larger 12.4-inch <b>front</b> <b>brake</b> discs (versus the 11.4-inch discs used on V6 Mustangs), standard four-channel ABS with traction control, a two-piece drive shaft, a stainless steel dual exhaust, standard grille-mounted fog lights, and 17-inch wheels with optional 18-inch wheels.|$|E

25|$|A special {{version of}} the 1JZ-GTE {{equipped}} JZA70, the 2.5 Twin Turbo R, had a Torsen differential, Bilstein suspension, larger diameter sway bars, Recaro seats, Momo wheel and gear knob and matching interior trim. The front lip included <b>front</b> <b>brake</b> ducts. The Twin Turbo R introduced the color option Jade Mica Green. This model was the fastest production A70.|$|E
25|$|As {{a general}} rule, fixed-gear {{bicycles}} are single-speed. A derailleur for gear selection would introduce chain slack, which {{would interfere with}} braking. Gear selection can, however, be accomplished {{with the use of}} an internally geared hub. For example, a Sturmey-Archer fixed-gear 3-speed hub is a fixed-gear multi-speed arrangement. Most fixed-gear bicycles only have a <b>front</b> <b>brake,</b> and some have no brakes at all.|$|E
25|$|If the <b>front</b> <b>brake</b> {{is mounted}} behind the fork a {{so-called}} self-assisting effect occurs. The friction force between brake shoe and rim creates a bending moment which presses the shoe even stronger {{on the rim}} thus leading to an amplified brake force. Self-assist reduces the input force needed to apply the brake. A disadvantage might be brake fade - a non-linear relation between actuation force and brake force.|$|E
5000|$|The {{wheelbase}} was {{a relatively}} modest 2300 mm. [...] <b>Front</b> <b>brakes</b> were included.|$|R
50|$|Shock {{absorbers}} were fitted all round. <b>Front</b> <b>braking</b> was now by <b>brakes</b> on the <b>front</b> wheels.|$|R
5000|$|October: Suzuki recalls 210,228 {{motorcycles}} in the U.S. {{because the}} <b>front</b> <b>brakes</b> {{might not work}} properly.|$|R
25|$|Larry is {{credited}} with helping to re-popularize the stripped down, tall handlebar, foot clutched, jockey shifted, no <b>front</b> <b>brake</b> or fender, small gas tank, open piped, kick start only, stock rake choppers that prevailed in the 1960s, before long front ends became popular (Larry explained during his first Biker Build-Off, that he preferred nimbleness in a bike so he could ride at high speeds along the mountain switchbacks).|$|E
25|$|Some teams made {{alterations}} {{to their}} cars {{in preparation for}} the race. Jaguar introduced a revised floor along with new bargeboards, whilst McLaren introduced minor aerodynamic revisions which included new <b>front</b> <b>brake</b> ducts. Sauber had brought new brake ducts and revised their bargeboards and Williams also brought new bargeboards for the race weekend. Prost reverted to an older undertray for Jean Alesi's car who preferred it over a new version débuted for the race.|$|E
25|$|Newly {{available}} for the Mustang GT for 2010 were two performance packages. The 3.73 Axle Package featured higher performance <b>front</b> <b>brake</b> pads, a more aggressive 3.73:1 rear axle, and a recalibrated AdvanceTrac system. The Track Package featured higher performance front and rear brake pads, stabilizer bars and rear lower control arms from the GT500, uniquely tuned shocks and struts, Pirelli summer tires (includes automatic upgrade to 19-inch wheels), a 3.73:1 rear axle with carbon plates in the differential, and a recalibrated AdvanceTrac system.|$|E
2500|$|The <b>front</b> <b>brakes</b> have a {{diameter}} of [...] and the rear brakes have {{a diameter}} of [...]|$|R
50|$|The Perrot-type <b>front</b> <b>brakes</b> are ribbed {{light section}} steel and are larger {{diameter}} than rear; cast iron shoes.|$|R
50|$|The <b>front</b> <b>brakes</b> have a {{diameter}} of 309 mm and the rear brakes have {{a diameter}} of 310 mm.|$|R
25|$|On any {{bike with}} only rear wheel braking, the maximum {{deceleration}} is {{significantly lower than}} on a bike equipped with a <b>front</b> <b>brake.</b> As a vehicle brakes, weight can be transferred towards the front wheel {{and away from the}} rear, decreasing the amount of grip the rear wheel has. Transferring the rider's weight back increases rear wheel braking efficiency, but a front wheel fitted with an ordinary brake might provide 70% or more of the braking power when braking hard.|$|E
25|$|The next {{development}} of the bicycle, the penny-farthings, were similarly braked with a spoon brake or by back pedalling. During its development from 1870 to 1878, there were various designs for brakes, most of them operating on the rear wheel. However, as the rear wheel became smaller and smaller, {{with more of the}} rider's weight over the front wheel, braking on the rear wheel became less effective. The <b>front</b> <b>brake,</b> introduced by John Kean in 1873, had been generally adopted by 1880 because of its greater stopping power.|$|E
25|$|The Boss 302 Laguna Seca edition is {{a further}} {{upgraded}} version of the Boss 302. Additions include Recaro sport seats, a Torsen limited-slip rear differential (both optional on the standard Boss 302), revised suspension tuning with unique spring and damper rates, and a larger rear stabilizer. The Laguna Seca model loses its rear seats, which are replaced by a cross-car X-brace to increase structural rigidity approximately 10%. It rides on 19X9-inch front and 19X10 inch rear light-weight alloy wheels with R-compound ultra high-performance tires. Ford Racing <b>front</b> <b>brake</b> ducts help cool the brakes.|$|E
50|$|Frame:New re-designed twin spar frame, {{extended}} swingarm, lighter <b>front</b> <b>brakes</b> {{to reduce}} un-sprung mass, lighter cast wheels to reduce rotating mass.|$|R
50|$|The brakes would {{probably}} not seem inadequate {{in the world of}} 1914. The foot brake operating on the transmission is exceedingly powerful but gets very hot and needs regular adjustment to maintain effectiveness. The handbrake on the rear wheels can be used for long descents but the drums are too small to provide dramatic stopping power. <b>Front</b> <b>brakes</b> would make a big difference but in 1914 <b>front</b> <b>brakes</b> were still {{the exception rather than the}} rule.|$|R
50|$|The Series II {{launched}} in October 1960 had disc <b>front</b> <b>brakes,</b> servo-assisted. The automatic option {{was no longer}} available on the home market.|$|R
25|$|In 1980, Honda only offered one model, {{designated}} as the Hawk, now simply designated CB400T. The CM400E took {{over the role of}} the cheaper Hawk I. It is similar to the European CB400NA. It has the same European styling and six-speed manual gearbox, although the pegs, footrest and gear lever are in the same position as the earlier Hawk variants. The bike became electric start only. Smaller 30mm Keihin CV carburettors with accelerator pumps were fitted to comply with US emissions controls. The 1981 model is similar to the European CB400NB and has a dual piston <b>front</b> <b>brake</b> caliper, plastic front fender and a different tank shape.|$|E
25|$|Available in coupé or 5-door body styles, it is {{a version}} of Range Rover Evoque with 285PS/400Nm 2.0-litre petrol engine, revised chassis for sharper handling, 350mm <b>front</b> <b>brake</b> discs, Land Rover InControl Apps, forged 20-inch alloy wheels in satin {{technical}} grey, exterior trim components detailed in Santorini black, new design of grille, lower front valance, new foglight surrounds 'Autobiography' illuminated tread plates, ingot badging on the tailgate and front wing vents, darkened headlights, clear tail lamps, Santorini black contrast roof, body-colour side trim visually lowers the vehicle a dynamic plus leather interior with either sports or premium climate seats {{in a range of}} four colours, Autobiography embossed logo at front seats, dashboard with dark brushed aluminium trim, Active driveline, torque vectoring by braking..|$|E
25|$|Sonic Super 4 is a {{race car}} concept that {{demonstrates}} Chevrolet's new small car performance potential, based on Sonic with Ecotec 1.4L turbo engine and six-speed manual transmission. It includes Chevrolet racing graphics, Carbon fiber lower splitter, Carbon fiber rocker panel extensions, Carbon fiber rear diffuser, Tinted headlamps and taillights, Concept Z-Spec high wing rear spoiler, Tow hooks, 18x7.5-inch satin black wheels with street-legal racing tires, SCCA-approved 1¾ -inch chrome moly roll cage, SCCA-approved inner and outer window nets, Z-Spec pedal kit, Racing instrumentation, Racing seat with five-point harness, Fire suppression system, Rearview camera system, Racing steering wheel with quick disconnect, Adjustable coil-over struts and spring kit, four-piston <b>front</b> <b>brake</b> calipers with two-piece drilled rotors, two-piston rear brake calipers with one-piece drilled rotors, Low-restriction air intake and filter, Two-inch cat-back straight-pipe exhaust.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Front</b> <b>brakes</b> are 320 mm {{semi-floating}} front discs and Tokico six-piston calipers. Rear brakes {{feature a}} 230 mm disc with a twin-piston opposed caliper.|$|R
5000|$|<b>Brakes</b> and Suspension: <b>front</b> <b>brakes</b> are {{mechanical}} hydraulic; regenerative rear brakes. Suspension is double A-arm in {{the front}} and swing arm in the rear ...|$|R
50|$|A {{line lock}} is {{a device that}} allows the <b>front</b> <b>brakes</b> to lock {{independently}} of the rear brakes via a switch. The device is an electric solenoid that controls a valve which allows the brakes to be controlled individually, this allows the <b>front</b> <b>brakes</b> to be locked and the rear brakes to be open. This allows the driver to spin the rear wheels without wasting the rear brakes. This method {{is referred to as}} line lock and is popular among enthusiasts who like to do burnouts frequently.|$|R
