Dubois first {{gave them the}} name Anthropopithecus ("man-ape"), as the chimpanzee was sometimes known at the time. He chose this name because a similar tooth found in the Siwalik Hills in India in 1878 <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>named</b> Anthropopithecus, and because Dubois first assessed the cranium to have been about , closer to apes than to humans.|$|E

Jo-Lonn Dunbar, who <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>named</b> to the preseason watch list for the Bronko Nagurski Trophy (awarded to the top defensive player in the country) was expected to fill the gaps and stop both rushing and passing elements of Virginia Tech's offense.|$|E

5|$|Edward Gough Whitlam {{was born}} on 11 July 1916 at the family home 'Ngara', 46 Rowland Street, Kew, a suburb of Melbourne.

His father was a federal public servant who later served as Commonwealth Crown Solicitor, and Whitlam senior's involvement in human rights issues was a powerful influence on his son.

5|$|In 1913, {{paleontologist}} Charles H. Sternberg recovered another tyrannosaurid skeleton {{from the}} slightly older Dinosaur Park Formation in Alberta. Lawrence Lambe named this dinosaur Gorgosaurus libratus in 1914. Other specimens were later found in Alberta and the US state of Montana. Finding, {{largely due to}} a lack of good Albertosaurus skull material, no significant differences to separate the two taxa, Dale Russell declared the name Gorgosaurus a junior synonym of Albertosaurus, which <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>named</b> first, and G. libratus was renamed Albertosaurus libratus in 1970. A species distinction was maintained because of the age difference. This addition extended the temporal range of the genus Albertosaurus backwards by several million years and its geographic range southwards by hundreds of kilometres.|$|E
5|$|In 1957, {{jet engine}} {{engineer}} Stanley Hooker of the Bristol Engine Company informed aeronautics engineer Sydney Camm of Hawker Aircraft that Bristol {{had been working}} a project that combined major elements of their Olympus and Orpheus jet engines to produce a directable fan jet.

The original concept upon which the engine, which <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>named</b> Pegasus, was based came from Michel Wibault, a French aviation consultant. Several adaptions and enhancements were made by Bristol to reduce size and weight over Wibault's original concept.|$|E
