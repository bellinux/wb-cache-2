40|$|Abstract—Electrical {{stimulation}} {{has been}} used for over 25 years to restore breathing to patients with high quadriplegia causing respiratory paralysis and patients with <b>central</b> <b>alveolar</b> <b>hypoventilation.</b> Three groups have developed electrical pacing systems for long-term support of respiration in humans. These systems consist of electrodes implanted on the phrenic nerves, connected by leads to a stimulator implanted under the skin, and powered and controlled from a battery-powered transmitter outside the body. The systems differ principally in the electrode design and stimulation waveform. Approximately 1, 000 people worldwide have received one of the three phrenic pacing devices, most with strongly positive results: reduced risk of tracheal problems and chronic infection, the ability to speak and smell more normally, reduced risk of accidental interruption of respiration, greate...|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT: Sleep has a {{physiological}} influence on respiration, which can have major {{adverse effects on}} gas exchange in patients with respiratory insufficiency. These effects relate largely {{to a reduction in}} various stimulant inputs to the brain-stem respiratory centre. Conditions that may be associated with sleep-related res-piratory insufficiency range from pulmonary disorders (such as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD)), to central respiratory insufficiency (such as <b>central</b> <b>alveolar</b> <b>hypoventilation),</b> neurological and neuromuscular disorders (such as polio and muscular dystrophy), and thoracic cage disorders (such as kyphoscoliosis). All these conditions have in common the finding of hypoxaemia and hypercapnia, which become more pronounced during sleep. The relative hypoventilation, which is common to each condition, is due to varying combinations of an inadequate res-piratory drive and an increase in the work of breathing. Management of respiratory insufficiency during sleep should be directed first at optimizing the underlying disorder, then at correcting hypoxaemia with con-trolled low-flow supplemental oxygen. Pharmacological therapy may be effectiv...|$|R
40|$|Three {{life-threatening}} respiratory complications {{are regularly}} encountered {{in patients who}} survive the initial insult from a diffuse brain stem lesion [...] <b>central</b> <b>alveolar</b> <b>hypoventilation,</b> upper airway obstruction, and aspiration pneumonitis. From treating 13 patients who did survive, a surgical plan for managing the respiratory sequelae of such injuries has evolved and consists of: 1) Diaphragm pacing to correct hypoventilation; 2) tracheostomy for bypass of the upper airway obstruction; 3) gastrostomy for bypass of the impaired structures of swallowing; 4) surgical closure of the larynx to prevent aspiration. All 13 patients manifested central apnea, which was controlled in five by bilateral phrenic nerve stimulation and in eight by unilateral stimulation. All patients required tracheostomy to provide an airway for artificial ventilation and for secretion removal. In ten patients aspiration necessitated gastrostomy. The spontaneous recovery {{of the ability to}} swallow allowed closure of the gastrostoma in three but in others aspiration remained a serious complication. One patient died of massive aspiration after discharge from the hospital. Three patients had surgical closure of the larynx to prevent aspiration. Seven patients are alive; six of them are leading productive lives, though several have severe disability due to paresis or ataxia. Six died after discharge from the hospital.

40|$|In {{patients}} with neuromuscular disorders (NMD) and thoracic wall deformities (TWD) <b>alveolar</b> <b>hypoventilation</b> can occur once the respiratory muscles become insufficient. Non-invasive ventilation can be started to reduce hypercapnia {{and to improve}} symptoms. Previous studies in {{patients with}} NMD and TWD showed an increased survival {{and quality of life}} after initiation of NIV. Although NIV is mostly applied to reduce <b>alveolar</b> <b>hypoventilation</b> during the night, only very few studies have searched for the effect of NIV on {{the quantity and quality of}} sleep. One of the most typical symptoms of <b>alveolar</b> <b>hypoventilation</b> is increased daytime sleepiness, which has a possible negative effect on physical activity. Few small studies (n< 10) have found positive effects of NIV on muscle strength and the 6 minute walking distance, but no research has been done on the effect of NIV on physical activity. In a first part we will search for the effects of NIV on the quantity and quality of sleep in patients with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). A large group of ALS patients is in follow-up at the Neuromuscular Reference Centre of the University Hospitals Leuven. If <b>alveolar</b> <b>hypoventilation</b> occurs, most of these patients are sent on to our sleep lab to initiate NIV. By using polysomnography (objective measurement) and patient reported outcomes (subjective measurement) the effect on quantity and quality of sleep is measured. Further on, research will be performed to investigate the influence of NIV on the sympathicovagal balance and an attempt will be made to create an “ideal” protocol for titration of NIV. A second part will focus on theeffects of NIV on physical activity in patients with NMD and TWD. Physical activity will be objectively measured before and after initiation ofNIV by physical activity devices together with the measurements of physical capacity and the endurance and strength of peripheral and respiratory muscles. nrpages: 182 status: publishe...|$|R
40|$|Electric {{stimulation}} of the diaphragm via the phrenic nerve to induce ventilation has recently been used for the long-term management of chronic ventilatory insufficiency. Since 1973 three patients with inadequate alveolar ventilation have been treated with diaphragm pacing at the Toronto Western Hospital.

40|$|AbstractA young {{overweight}} {{patient with}} Mohr–Claussen Syndrome {{was admitted to}} our department with the clinical diagnosis of pulmonary hypertension complaining about dyspnea at rest and excessive daytime sleepiness. Pulmonary function testing indicated severe airflow limitation and respiratory insufficiency. Pulmonary artery (PA) pressure was markedly increased. Pulmonary embolism, Alpha- 1 -antitrypsin-deficiency, emphysema and anatomical obstructions were excluded. Polysomnography showed recurrent oxygen desaturations compatible with <b>alveolar</b> <b>hypoventilations.</b> Hypercapnic ventilatory response testing (HCVR) indicated a missing increase in minute ventilation when exposed to hypercapnia. After 6 weeks of nocturnal non-invasive ventilation therapy, her clinical condition markedly improved. Furthermore, PA pressure returned to normal values.

40|$|AbstractThis {{study was}} {{undertaken}} to observe whether dialysis-induced <b>alveolar</b> <b>hypoventilation</b> and arterial hypoxaemia occur during bicarbonate haemodialysis in patients receiving partial mechanical support with pressure support ventilation. Nineteen patients {{admitted to the}} medical intensive care unit requiring mechanical ventilation and haemodialysis were enrolled. Arterial blood gas, white blood cell (WBC) count, minute ventilation, respiratory rate, breathing pattern and blood pressure were measured according to the following time schedule: pre-dialysis (time 0), and at 15, 30, 60, 120, 180, 240 min thereafter. Results showed that, {{with the use of}} cuprammonium dialyser, the WBC count dropped immediately and reached the nadir 15 min after haemodialysis. Thereafter, it recovered and overshot the pre-dialysis values until the end of dialysis. The bicarbonate dialysate indeed resulted in rapid and significant metabolic alkalosis. However, no decrease of PaO 2 occurred throughout haemodialysis. The tidal volume, minute ventilation and breathing pattern remained stable during haemodialysis. We conclude that neither dialysis-induced <b>alveolar</b> <b>hypoventilation</b> nor arterial hypoxaemia developed during bicarbonate dialysis in patients mechanically ventilated with the pressure support ventilation...|$|R

Respiratory muscle weakness is associated with increased respiratory workload and reduced or interrupted (central or peripheral) neural stimulation. In healthy individuals (in whom central respiratory drive is normal), the respiratory muscle strength required in order to drive the respiratory system must be greater than the sum of the work imposed by the lungs, rib cage, and airways.

40|$|A {{syndrome}} of <b>alveolar</b> <b>hypoventilation</b> {{has been}} identified {{in a group of}} patients with bilateral diaphragm paralysis. Eight patients were studied in whom diaphragm weakness had been suggested by paradoxical (inward) movement of the abdominal wall on inspiration, of whom seven had evidence of a generalized neuromuscular disorder. Diaphragm function was assessed quantitatively by measurement of the change in transdiaphragmatic pressure during a maximum inspiration (zlPDi). In five patients, JPDi was zero and in the others ranged from 2 - 6 cm H 2 O (normal> 25 cm H 2 O) indicating paralysis and severe weakness in the respective groups. Fluoro-scopy of the diaphragm was found to give misleading results, and the reasons for this are considered. Vital capacity ranged from 65 - 30 per cent of the predicted normal in the upright posture, typically falling by about a half in the supine posture. Alveolar hypoventila-tion was present in five patients when supine and in six when asleep, the deterioration in blood gases associated with sleep generally being much greater in these patients than in normal subjects. Respiratory rate was significantly greater than age-matched controls. The ventilatory response to CO 2 was impaired. The PCO 2 could be brought to normal levels by voluntary hyperventilation, and the unreliability of voluntary respiratory manoeuvres of this kind as indices of ventilatory reserve is emphasized. <b>Alveolar</b> <b>hypoventilation</b> was associated with disturbed sleep, morning headache and day-time fatigue.

40|$|Introduction Domiciliary {{assisted}} ventilation (DAV) may {{be undertaken}} invasively or non-invasively. Non-invasive DAV {{is used for}} patients suffering from <b>alveolar</b> <b>hypoventilation</b> due to restrictive pathology. Invasive DAV is reserved for "indications of necessity" that is when non-invasive ventilation is contraindicated due {{to the absence of}} adequate cough and for <b>alveolar</b> <b>hypoventilation</b> leading to hypercapnoea during spontaneous ventilation. State of the art The main pathophysiological limitation to noninvasive ventilation is the interference of the glottis. In this mode the glottis imposes a variable resistance to the ventilation delivered. Its behaviour is more predictable during volume controlled than during pressure controlled ventilation. The control parameters of a volume controlled ventilator are very different from those used in invasive ventilation during which the respiratory system may be regarded as a single compartment (provided a cuffed tube bypasses the upper airway). In non-invasive DAV: mode VCM, tidal volume 13 mls kg(- 1), rate 20 cycles min(- 1), insp/exp ratio 1 / 1. 2. In invasive DAV: mode VCM, tidal volume 8 - 10 mls kg(- 1), rate 12 cycles min(- 1), insp/exp ratio depending on the pathology 1 / 2. Perspectives As non-invasive DAV is essentially delivered during sleep the parameters for each patient can be optimised during polysomnography because waking, leading to a partial glottic occlusion, interferes with the ventilation delivered. Conclusions Recent understanding of the way the glottis interferes with mechanical ventilation when delivered non-invasively should lead to a revision of earlier practices based on invasive ventilation...|$|R
