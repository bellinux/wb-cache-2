At this time, there was still uncertainty over which group of dinosaur Stegoceras belonged to, with both ceratopsians (horned dinosaurs) and stegosaurs (plated dinosaurs) as contenders. Hatcher doubted whether the Stegoceras specimens belonged to the same species and whether they were dinosaurs at all, and suggested the domes consisted of the frontal, occipital, and parietal bones of the skull. In 1918, Lambe referred another dome (CMN 138) to S. validus, and named a new species, S. brevis, based on specimen CMN 1423 (which he originally included in S. validus).

By this time, he considered these animals as members of Stegosauria (then composed of both families of armoured dinosaurs, Stegosauridae and Ankylosauridae), in a new family he called Psalisauridae (named for the vaulted or dome-shaped skull roof).In 1924, the American palaeontologist Charles W. Gilmore described a complete skull of S. validus with associated postcranial remains (specimen UALVP 2 in the University of Alberta Laboratory for Vertebrate Palaeontology), until then the most complete remains of a dome-headed dinosaur. This find confirmed Hatcher's interpretation of the domes as consisting of the frontoparietal area of the skull. UALVP 2 was found with small, disarticulated bony elements, then thought to be gastralia (abdominal ribs), which are not known in other ornithischian dinosaurs (one of the two main groups of dinosaurs). Gilmore pointed out that the teeth of S. validus were very {{similar to those of the}} species Troodon formosus (named in 1856 and by then only known from isolated teeth), and described a skull dome discovered close to the locality where Troodon was found. Therefore, Gilmore considered Stegoceras an invalid junior synonym of Troodon, thereby renaming S. validus into T. validus, and suggested that even the two species might be the same. Furthermore, he found S. brevis to be identical to S. validus, and therefore a junior synonym of the latter. He also placed these species in the new family Troodontidae (since Lambe had not selected a type genus for his Psalisauridae), which he considered closest to the ornithopod dinosaurs. Because the skull seemed so specialized compared to the rather [...] "primitive"-looking skeleton, Nopcsa doubted whether these parts actually belonged together, and suggested the skull belonged to a nodosaur, the skeleton to an ornithopod, and the supposed gastralia (belly ribs) to a fish. This claim was rebutted by Gilmore and Loris S. Russell in the 1930s.Gilmore's classification was supported by the American palaontologists Barnum Brown and Erich Maren Schlaikjer in their 1943 review of the dome-headed dinosaurs, by then known from 46 skulls. From these specimens, Brown and Schlaikjer named the new species T. sternbergi and T. edmontonensis (both from Alberta), as well as moving the large species T. wyomingensis (which was named in 1931) to the new genus Pachycephalosaurus, along with two other species. They found T. validus distinct from T. formosus, but considered S. brevis the female form of T. validus, and therefore a junior synonym. By this time, the dome-headed dinosaurs were either considered relatives of ornithopods or of ankylosaurs. In 1945, after examining casts of T. formosus and S. validus teeth, the American palaeontologist Charles M. Sternberg demonstrated differences between the two, and instead suggested that Troodon was a theropod dinosaur, and that the dome-headed dinosaurs should be placed in their own family. Though Stegoceras was the first member of this family to be named, Sternberg named the group Pachycephalosauridae after the second genus, as he found that name (meaning [...] "thick head lizard") more descriptive. He also considered T. sternbergi and T. edmontonensis members of Stegoceras, found S. brevis valid, and named a new species, S. lambei, based on a specimen formerly referred to S. validus. The split from Troodon was supported by Russell in 1948, who described a theropod dentary with teeth almost identical to those of T. formosus.|$|E

40|$|During the Middle Pleistocene, the {{subspecies}} {{was widespread}} from Georgia to Portugal, {{though it is}} scantily recorded in local faunal assemblages of Southern Europe. Its occurrence in a few Late Pleistocene sites needs to be confirmed. In Italy, the subspecies is recorded in the late Galerian fauna of Visogliano (MIS 13 - 10) {{as well as in}} the Magliana area, where an incomplete skull was found at the beginning of the last century. Although the precise location where this specimen was found is unknown, on the basis of the results of the geochemical analysis performed on a small amount of sediment, sampled from the filling of the inner cavities of the <b>horn-cores,</b> and considering the stratigraphy of the area, the hypothesis that the skull comes from the deposits of the PG 4 sequence (MIS 14 partim - MIS 13) cannot be ruled out. This hypothetical remark would confirm the occurrence in Italy of the argali in late Galerian faunas. The dimensions of Ovis ammon antiqua from the Magliana area fit well within the range of variability of the larger specimens, likely males, found at La Caune de L’Arago (France) (MIS 14 - 12), from which the Italian specimen differs in having less twisted and more dorso-ventrally curved <b>horn-cores...</b>|$|R

It differs from other genera in its straight, almost conical, horn-cores, which diverge slightly from the sagittal plane, are very close together at their bases and slant strongly backwards (nearly parallel to the glenoid surface of the temporal bone). The very peculiar shape and position of these horn-cores render their phylogenetic relationship with other taxa from the Miocene of Europe and other circum-Mediterranean countries uncertain. Given the global features of the horn-cores {{and the absence of}} any alcelaphine-like tooth in the Monte Tuttavista samples, the hypothesis that Asoletragus belongs to an archaic "Caprinae" cannot be ruled out, despite the presence of quite a large frontal sinus rising through the pedicel and at least one-third of the <b>horn-core</b> proper.

40|$|The plates I—XI contain {{illustrations}} {{of all the}} skulls and horn-cores of Bovidae from the Quaternary of the Netherlands, brought together in the National Museum of Geology at Leyden, Holland. They were all photographed with the occiputs vertical or what {{is thought to be}} vertical. They are described in the same order as figured. On the plates I—V are represented the skulls and horn-cores of the domesticated cows. Four races are distinguished among them: the brachyceros-race (fig. 1 — 25), the frontosus-race (fig. 26), the primigenius-race (fig. 27 — 41) and the trochoceros-race (fig. 42 — 46). The brachyceros-skulls and horn-cores have the following characteristics: a sharp angle (30 °— 50 °) between the plane of curvature of the horn-cores and the horizontal plane, cores that are curved in one plane, a sharp angle (about 70 °) between os frontale and os occipitale, a small breadth of the os frontale (table 1, measurement 2 : 137 — 145 mm), a small index 6 (table 1), small measurements 10, 15 and 16 (table 1), a large breadth to length-index of the os frontale (table 1, measurement 13), a small difference between the length (table 1, measurement 27) and the basal circumference of the horncores (table 1, measurement 26). Examples of typical representatives of brachyceros-cows are given by the figures 3, 6, 8, 9, 12, 13, 21 and 22. The skulls and cores of the figures 2, 4, 7, 15 and 24 show some affinity to the primigenius-race and those of the figures 1, 5, 10, 16, 17, 18 and 23 to the trochoceros-race. The basal parts of the cores of figure 26 are strongly curved backwards and the plane of curvature nearly coincides with the frontal plane. As the points of the horn-cores are missing, the determination is somewhat uncertain. It is, however, not impossible, that this skull belonged to a frontosus-cow. The skulls and horn-cores, which I believe that belong to the primigenius-race, have the following characteristics: the cores are (when the occiput is placed in the vertical plane) directed strongly upwards and are not curved in one plane; the min. breadth of the os frontale (table 3, measurement 2), the length of the forehead (table 3, measurement 10) and the breadth of the occiput (table 3, measurements 15 and 16) are larger than those of the brachy-ceros-cows; there is a large difference between the length of the cores (table 3, measurement 27) and their basal circumference (table 3, measurement 26). Examples of typical representatives of the primigenius-race are given by the figures 27, 28, 31, 33 and 34. The <b>horn-core</b> of figure 29 probably belonged to a young Bos primigenius. The skulls and cores of figures 30, 32 and 35 show some affinity to the brachyceros-race. The skulls and horn-cores of plate V are believed to be representatives of the trochoceros-race. They are characterized by an angle of 10 °— 20 ° between the plane of curvature and the horizontal plane, a curvature of the cores in one plane, a backward curving of the basal parts of the cores, a longer breadth to length-index of the os frontale (table 4, measurement 2), a length of the forehead (table 4, measurement 10) and a breadth of the occiput (table 4, measurement 15 and 16) which are larger than those of the brachyceros-race. On the plates VI—VIII are presented the skulls and horn-cores of Bos primigenius. Comparing the measurements (see table 5) with those of males and females, as given by Adametz, it is clear, that the skulls and cores of figures 47, 48, 49, 50 and 53 belonged to males and that of figure 51 to a female. Skulls and horn-cores of Bison priscus are presented on the plates IX—XI. Among them are distinguished two different races, Bison priscus longicornis Grom. (plate IX, plate X, fig. 62, 65, 66, 67 and plate XI) and Bison priscus deminutus Grom. (fig. 63 — 64). The first is characterized by a large and narrow skull with long and slender cores and with a breadth to length-index of the os frontale (table 6, measurement 13) of 133 — 147. A comparison with the measurements as given by Gromova makes it probable, that only the skulls of figures 60 and 63 are females whereas all the others belonged to males. Bison priscus deminutus (fig. 63 and 64) is characterized by a moderately sized skull with massive cores and with a breadth to lengthindex of the os frontale (table 6, measurement 13) of 124. The min. breadth of the os frontale (table 6, measurement 2) is only 267 — 286 mm. There is, however, some difference between the skull of figure 63 and the skull of figure 64. The first mentioned has a convex forehead with regular transitions in the cores; the cores are only feebly curved. This skull is supposed to have belonged to a female animal. The skull of figure 64 has a flat forehead sharply separated from the cores; the cores are much more curved. This skull probably belonged to a male bison. Table 7 gives a review of the stratigrapbical distribution of the Bovidae, here described. The specimens of Bison priscus from Bokhoven (fig. 61), Brummen (fig. 74) and Drempt (fig. 64) certainly belong to Würm Glacial and the others probably also. The specimens of Bos primigenius may be devided into three groups. Enterbroek (fig. 48) and Ammerozden (fig. 49) belong to the Würm Glacial. Lutterzijl (fig. 47), Nieuwe Merwede (fig. 50) and Terschelling (fig. 51) belong either to the Würm Glacial or to the Holocene. The others are holocene. Of these the specimen from Veghel, 2 m (fig. 54) belongs to the Boreal and those from the Mease-tunnel (fig. 52, 55, 56 and 58) and Dinther (fig. 53) to the Subboreal. The normalisation-works of the river Aa, Northern Brabant, have furnished some important data as to the stratigraphical distribution of Bos taurus. The oldest specimen, Veghel, 2 ½ m — (fig. 23), has been dated by pollen analysis as belonging to {{the upper part of the}} Würm Glacial, the so-called Lateglacial. However, it is not probable, that this <b>horn-core</b> is derived from a domesticated animal. The oldest occurrence of domesticated brachyceros-oxen are contemporaneous with the Kjökkenmöddinger culture (5000 — 4000 b. C.). The <b>horn-core</b> of Veghel, on the other hand, is of the same age as the late palaeolithic culture (before 8000 b. C.). Therefore it is much more probable, that the core belonged to a wild ox, namely Bos (Brachyceros) europaeus Adametz. By several investigators (Adametz, Antonius) this species is considered to be the wild ancestor of the domesticated brachyceros-oxen. The specimen from Veghel renders this theory more probable than the view advocated by Nehring, Duerst and Hilzheimer, who suppose, that all the races of Bos taurus, the brachycerosrace included, descended from Bos primigenius Boj. The first undoubted tame cows from the river-basin of the Aa are dated by pollen analysis as belonging to the transition from Boreal to Atlanticum. This is the beginning of the late mesolithic Kjökkenmödinger culture. The still persisting flint-industry (microliths) is associated with the first pottery. It is the time of beginning agriculture. As demonstrated by the finding of remains of Cervus elaphus L. and Bos primigenius Boj., the deer and the aurochs were formed the chief hunting quarry. In Subboreal time this district was inhabited by the so-called „urnpeople”, by who not only the brachycerosbut also the more robust primigeniusand trochoceros-cows were breeded. The district of the larger rivers is characterized by the absence of Bos taurus brachyceros, the probable presence of Bos taurus frontosus, during the Subboreal, and the presence of Bos taurus primigenius during the Boreal and Subboreal. The absence of the brachyceros-cow is probably imputable to a hiatus in the collections of the Museum at Leyden. Contrary to Bos taurus brachyceros, Bos taurus primigenius is generally considered to be a direct descendant of Bos primigenius. It is however not yet known at what time the first aurochses were domesticated. Without doubt the skull from Wijk-bij-Duurstede (fig. 27) belonged to an animal, that lived at the beginning of domestication. The frontosus-ox is not found among the fauna of the Swiss lake dwellings. However it is described by Degerbøl from the Subboreal of Denmark (Bundsø). Therefore it is probable, that the „urn-people” living along the large rivers had a different origin to the people dwelling in the sandy regions of Brabant...|$|E

P. lachrymans has been regarded as the most primitive species of the genus. iv). Bubalus originated in the Siwalik region. It is absent Europe and Africa. The hitherto referred material from Africa by Duvernoy(1851), Seeley (1891) and Lonnberg (1933) has been transferred t the genus Pelorovis by Gentry (1978) to which I agree. v). Bison originated in Asia probably in the Siwalik region. Bison crassicornis has been regarded as the most primitive species of the genus vi) Antilope originated in the Siwalik region and A. planiscornis is the most primitive species of the genus...|$|E

However, an alternative interpretation of the collection lessens the modern character of the faunal composition. Many of the identifications are revised: there might be a single species of Boselaphini, {{there is no evidence of}} Hippotragini, and Aepyceros is less common than previously thought. Two new genera, Afrotragus and Turkanatragus, are erected; together with an unnamed species and ‘Kobus’ laticornis Harris, 2003, they cannot easily be allocated to any existing tribe. These two new genera share long, slender, spiralled <b>horn-cores,</b> and it is conceivable that they belong to the same group, which might also include the ‘Prostrepsiceros’ from Sahabi, Libya, but does not seem closely related to Eurasian Prostrepsiceros. Along with sparser evidence from elsewhere in Africa, this strongly suggests that by the late Miocene, African Bovidae underwent a wider radiation than reflected in the tribes that survived into the Pliocene, showing that the crown groups very incompletely document the relatively recent past diversity of the family...|$|R
