The past season has been very successful, consequently, the outcome has been good cricket and high scoring. The captain of the Oyster Cove C. C., Miss L. Poulett-Harris, heads the batting list with the remarkably good average of 32.6; her batting throughout the season <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>very</b> <b>good.</b> She has also the honour of having put up the record for Tasmania, making 64 (not out) in an innings (which included five fours), and 78 in a match. Miss K. Denne, North Bruni C. C., comes next {{with an average of}} 18 runs." ...|$|E

6000|$|Danny Meadow Mouse {{had grown}} {{very fond of}} Peter Rabbit, for Peter <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>very,</b> <b>very</b> <b>good</b> to him.

It <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>very</b> <b>good</b> of Peter to offer to share the Old Briar-patch with Danny, because Danny was so far from his own home {{that it would not}} be safe for him to try to get back there. But Peter had done more than that. He had taken care of Danny, such good care, during the first few days after Danny's escape from Hooty the Owl. He had brought good things to eat while Danny was too weak and sore to get things for himself. Oh, Peter <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>very</b> <b>good</b> indeed to him! ...|$|R
