2500|$|John Grant of the Metropolitan Board of Works in 1859 set out {{requirements}} for cement {{to be used}} in the London sewer project. This became a specification for Portland cement. The next development with the manufacture of Portland cement was the introduction of the rotary kiln, patented by German Friedrich Hoffmann, called a <b>Hoffmann</b> <b>kiln</b> for brick making in 1858, and then Frederick Ransome in 1885 (U.K.) and 1886 (U.S.); which allowed a stronger, more homogeneous mixture and a continuous manufacturing process. [...] The Hoffmann 'endless' kiln which gave 'perfect control over combustion' was tested in 1860, and showed the process produced a better grade of cement. This cement was made at the Portland Cementfabrik Stern at Stettin, which was the first to use a <b>Hoffmann</b> <b>kiln.</b> [...] It is thought that the first modern Portland cement was made there. The Association of German Cement Manufacturers issued a standard on Portland cement in 1878.|$|E
50|$|In {{a classic}} <b>Hoffmann</b> <b>kiln,</b> the fire may burn {{continuously}} for years, even decades; in Iran, there are kilns {{that are still}} active and have been working continuously for 35 years. Any fuel {{may be used in}} a <b>Hoffmann</b> <b>kiln,</b> including gasoline, natural gas, heavy petroleum and wood fuel. The dimensions of a typical <b>Hoffmann</b> <b>kiln</b> are completely variable, but in average about 5 m (height) x 15 m (width) x 150 m (length).|$|E

5000|$|The <b>Hoffmann</b> <b>kilns</b> {{were located}} on the {{opposite}} side of the canal to the chosen station site, and if accessed on the level would have required an aqueduct to be built under the canal. Not having the money to achieve this, the O&NR agreed to junction with the local tramways north of its station at [...] "Rock Siding". It hence built a bay platform on the northwest sie of the station, from which line extended to the [...] "Rock Siding". To access the <b>Hoffmann</b> <b>kilns,</b> train would firstly enter the bay, then reverse up the slope to the [...] "Rock Siding", where they would then change direction again by pulling forward over a bridge to the <b>Hoffmann</b> <b>kilns.</b>|$|R
50|$|The {{village is}} {{home to one of}} only three {{remaining}} <b>Hoffmann</b> <b>kilns</b> in the British Isles, and the only one with a chimney. The kiln at Llanymynech was used for lime burning. The area around the kiln is designated as the Llanymynech Heritage Area.|$|R

5000|$|The <b>Hoffmann</b> <b>kiln</b> is {{a series}} of batch process kilns. Hoffmann kilns are the most common kiln used in {{production}} of bricks and some other ceramic products. Patented by German Friedrich Hoffmann for brickmaking in 1858, it was later used for lime-burning, and was known as the Hoffmann continuous kiln.|$|E
50|$|A <b>Hoffmann</b> <b>kiln</b> {{consists}} of a main fire passage surrounded on each side by several small rooms. Each room contains a pallet of bricks. In the main fire passage there is a fire wagon, that holds a fire that burns continuously. Each room is fired for a specific time, until the bricks are vitrified properly, and thereafter the fire wagon is rolled to the next room to be fired.|$|E

5000|$|Junctioned {{from the}} former Oswestry and Newtown Railway's [...] station, the lines access was {{to the north of}} the station to provide {{sufficient}} clearance height before crossing the canal. Unable to justify the expense of an aqueduct to pass under the canal, trains would hence proceed up what was called the [...] "Rock Siding" [...] towards the <b>Hoffmann</b> <b>kilns,</b> before reversing onto the Llanfyllin branch.|$|R
5000|$|Having been {{merged into}} the Cambrian Railways (CR) in 1860, in 1863 {{it had an}} Act of Parliament {{approved}} to build the Llanfyllin Branch, to access limestone quarries along the valley to the regionally important market town of Llanfyllin. However, the same restriction on access was in place, meaning that the LB was access by the same route via the [...] "Rock Siding", and hence passing the <b>Hoffmann</b> <b>kilns.</b>|$|R
50|$|In 1888 the Seterse Heide was {{designated}} as a catchment area and in 1894 the waterworks was built. The railway alongside Dorst was opened in 1867, but Dorst {{did not get a}} station. However, from 1908 to 1930 there was a stopping place for the trains. North of the railway, at De Vliert 20, there was a brickyard. This was established at 1899 by Frans Oomen. The factory possessed a <b>Hoffmann</b> <b>kiln</b> and produced 5 to 6 million stones a year. For some time there also functioned a roof tilesfactory. The stone factory was demolished in 2010 after a time of vacancy.|$|E
5000|$|The <b>Hoffmann</b> <b>Kiln</b> is used {{in almost}} every country. In the British Isles {{there are only a}} few Hoffmann kilns remaining, some of which have been preserved. The only ones with a chimney are at Prestongrange Industrial Heritage Museum and Llanymynech Heritage Area. The site at Llanymynech, close to Oswestry was used for lime-burning and has {{recently}} been partially restored as part of an industrial archaeology conservation project supported by English Heritage and the Heritage Lottery Fund. Two examples in North Yorkshire, the Hoffmann lime-burning kiln at Meal Bank Quarry, Ingleton and that at the former Craven and Murgatroyd lime works, Langcliffe are scheduled ancient monuments.There is an intact but abandoned <b>Hoffmann</b> <b>kiln</b> without a chimney present at Minera Limeworks; the site is abandoned but all entrances to the kiln have been grated-off, preventing access. The kiln is in a very poor state of repair, with trees growing out of the walls and the roof. Minera Quarry Trust hopes one day to develop the area into something of a tourist attraction. The Grade II listed Hoffmann brick kiln in Ilkeston, Derbyshire, is also badly neglected, although the recently installed fencing offers some protection for the building and for visitors. At Prestongrange Museum, outside Prestonpans in East Lothian, the Hoffman kiln is still standing and visitors can listen to more about it via a mobile phone tour. There is also a nearly complete kiln in Horeb, Carmarthenshire.There is a complete kiln in the restored Tsalapatas brick Factory in Volos Greece that has been converted to an industrial museum. At the Brunswick brickworks in Victoria, Australia, there are two surviving kilns converted to residences, and a chimney from a third kiln, another in Box Hill, also in Melbourne and one in Adelaide, South Australia. Also, two in New Zealand.|$|E
50|$|A third {{blast furnace}} was {{constructed}} and began production in 1876. Several negative factors affected the works after the mid-1870s: {{a drop in}} iron prices of 75% in the late 1870s; difficulty in obtaining coal during a strike in the Durham Coalfield around 1879, and industrial problems at the works in 1880. The works closed in 1891, and were offered for sale and the buildings demolished in the early 1890s. As {{a result of its}} closure, the village population dropped to 872 by 1901. The works produced an estimated one million tons of slag. After closure the slag heaps were reprocessed to make road stone, and slag wool; reprocessing continued until at least the early 1930s. The brickworks expanded during {{the first decades of the}} 20th century: its 120 m chimney was built in 1902; and a <b>Hoffmann</b> <b>kiln</b> was constructed in 1923; the brickworks operated until 1957.|$|E
50|$|This is {{a nationally}} {{significant}} industrial heritage area, containing {{one of only}} three remaining <b>Hoffmann</b> <b>kilns</b> in the country.It provides key insights into industrial archaeology, as it was a major centre of the lime industry until the early 20th century. It is not known when the lime industry started here, but it may date back to medieval times or possibly earlier. The first reference to the site is on a map from 1753. Evidence of early settlement locally includes a prehistoric hill fort on Llanmynech HIll, while Offa's Dyke runs close to the site on the western perimeter. The area also {{has a long history of}} industrial activity, including copper and lead mining dating back to at least the Roman period.|$|R
5000|$|Each room is {{connected}} to the next room by a passageway carrying hot gases from the fire. In this way, the hottest gases are directed into the room that is currently being fired. Then the gases pass into the adjacent room that is scheduled to be fired next. There the gases preheat the brick. As the gases pass through the kiln circuit, they gradually cool as they transfer heat to the brick as it is preheated and dried. This is essentially a counter-current heat exchanger, which makes for a very efficient use of heat and fuel. This efficiency is a principal advantage of the <b>Hoffmann</b> <b>kiln,</b> {{and is one of the}} reasons for its original development and continued use throughout history. [...] In addition to the inner opening to the fire passage, each room also has an outside door, through which recently fired brick is removed, and replaced with wet brick to be dried and then fired in the next firing cycle.|$|E
