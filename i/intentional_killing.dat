40|$|ENG) Crimes {{of murder}} and {{manslaughter}} under sections 140 and 141 of the Czech criminal code The main objective of this work {{is to provide a}} comprehensive analysis of the codification of crimes {{of murder and}} manslaughter. The last recodification from the year of 2009 brought some significant changes into the area of <b>intentional</b> <b>killings,</b> the most important of which is an increased differentiation in the typology of these crimes. The Czech criminal code now differentiates between murder, premeditated murder and manslaughter. These changes can be seen {{as part of an effort}} by the Czech legislature to modernize the criminal law along the lines of legal systems typical in Western Europe. On the other hand, it can also be argued that the new Czech codification preserves its unique approach to certain problems. This thesis analyzes individual parts of sections of the Czech criminal code concerned with murder and manslaughter in a systematic manner. The first chapter deals with the historical context of <b>intentional</b> <b>killings</b> as well as providing an analysis of the new arrangement. Chapter two follows by introducing features common along all three types of <b>intentional</b> <b>killings,</b> specifically the actus reus of the crime. The following chapters then describe the different approaches towards intentional [...] ...|$|R
40|$|Resumé This Master's thesis {{concerns}} {{murder and}} manslaughter under ss. 140 and 141 of the Czech Penal Code. It {{is impossible to}} solve this problem globally, because it is a very broad topic. The thesis focuses on s. 140 (3), which covers qualified murders. The author tries to describe qualified elements in such murders on the background of jurisprudence and court decisions; then he considers them. The qualified elements under s. 140 (3) of the Czech Penal Code are divided into seven chapters. The author not only describes the elements in each chapter, he also tries to analyse the possibility of legal qualification of manslaughter in situations, where qualification elements under s. 140 (3) of the Czech Penal Code are formally satisfied. Each of the chapters contains a brief comparison with German law, too. The thesis is composed of ten chapters. Chapter One is the introduction to murders and <b>intentional</b> <b>killings</b> generally. It provides the system of <b>intentional</b> <b>killings</b> under the Czech Penal Code, Czech legal history of such crimes, obligatory elements in murders and it deals with differences between affective and premeditative murders. Chapter Two introduces legal regulation of qualified elements under s. 140 (3) of the Czech Penal Code. The following seven chapters are {{the main part of the}} thesis. Chapter [...] ...|$|R
50|$|Intent to kill is {{normally}} present during a voluntary manslaughter case, {{but it is}} not required. Since most heat of passion and imperfect self-defense killings involve intent to kill, typical voluntary manslaughter involves <b>intentional</b> <b>killings.</b> However, there are occasions when intent to kill is not present, although malice is. One example of this would be when a person responds to oral provocation by engaging in physical altercation. The provocation is sufficient so that their response is justified. Should the response result in the death of the provoker, the crime is either voluntary manslaughter or second degree murder, depending on the jurisdiction.|$|R

Hunter writes that the target {{is a person who}} is allegedly taking part in an armed conflict or terrorism, whether by bearing arms or otherwise, who has allegedly lost the immunity from being targeted that he would otherwise have under the Third Geneva Convention. Hunter distinguishes between [...] "targeted killing" [...] and [...] "targeted violence" [...] as used by specialists who study violence.|$|E

2500|$|The {{prohibition}} on killing precept in Buddhist scriptures {{applies to all}} living beings, states Christopher Gowans, not just human beings. Bhikkhu Bodhi agrees, clarifying that the more accurate rendering of the Pali canon is a {{prohibition on}} [...] "taking life of any sentient being", which includes human beings, animals, birds, insects but excludes plants {{because they are not}} considered sentient beings. Further, adds Bodhi, this precept refers to <b>intentional</b> <b>killing,</b> as well as any form of intentional harming or torturing any sentient being. This moral virtue in early Buddhist texts, both in context of harm or killing of animals and human beings, is similar to ahimsa precepts found in the texts particularly of Jainism as well as of Hinduism, and has been a subject of significant debate in various Buddhist traditions.|$|E

2500|$|Emanuel {{said the}} Hippocratic Oath and the codes of modern medical {{societies}} require doctors to maintain client patient confidentiality, refrain from lying to a patient, keep patients informed and obtain their consent, {{in order to}} protect the patient from manipulation and discrimination. Emanuel said that a doctor’s oath would never allow him to administer a lethal injection for capital punishment as a doctor, although the issue would be different if he were asked to serve on a firing squad not as a doctor but rather as a citizen. [...] He said that in the case of mercy killing there are rare cases where the medical obligation to relieve suffering would be in tension with the obligation to save a life, and that a different argument (an argument that <b>intentional</b> <b>killing</b> [...] "should not be used to achieve the legitimate ends of medicine") would be required instead.|$|E
50|$|In {{the process}} of {{decision}} making, when <b>intentional</b> <b>killings</b> {{should be treated as}} justifiable, lawmakers are balancing multiple interests. On the one hand, states usually allow citizens to protect themselves from harm. In modern times, this reflects a social contract where allegiance is rewarded by the provision of policing and other civil defense systems, and the apparatus of redress is a court system. In the United Nations Universal Declaration of Human Rights, Article 3 states that everyone has the right to life, liberty and security of person, and many nations' policy allows for some degree of leniency for self-defense. In most cases where self-defense is substantiated through the legal system, reduced charges (i.e. felony reduced to misdemeanor), reduced prison sentences, or acquittal are the common rulings.|$|R
40|$|Private defence is {{the civilized}} {{remnant of the}} ancient system of private vengeance as redress for wrong done. The Romans, in {{permitting}} self-help formulated the principle moderatio inculpatae (moderation in self-defence) which the European jurists later relied upon to develop a coherent doctrine of private defence. Certain types of <b>intentional</b> <b>killings</b> were no longer regarded as unlawful and therefore are not punished as murder. South African recognizes that killing is justifiable and therefore not murder. Despite the sound rationale underlying the defence, namely the upholding of justice theory where people acting in private defence perform acts where they assist in upholding the legal order, {{and despite the fact}} that the defence is established in both criminal law legal theory and practice, there are threshold problems with this rationale which has been subject to much academic criticism. Such criticism must be seen in the context of the wider debate surrounding the circumstances in which battered women kill their abusers- normally in circumstances where the threat is not imminent and therefore the need to uphold justice is not necessary...|$|R
40|$|English {{abstract}} Legal and Criminological Aspects of Intentional Homicide JUDr. Jaromír Hořák The study explores selected {{problems on}} the subject of intentional homicide that has key importance in terms of differentiation of these delicts through the introduction of privileged and qualified factums of crime. Until recently, all cases of intentional homicide except of infanticide were considered "murder" under article No. 219 of the former Czechoslovak criminal code of 1961. The new Czech penal code passed in 2009 replaces this uniformed conception by a terminological bipartition of "murder" and a less grave crime of "manslaughter", defined as committed in an excusable state of sudden strong mental agitation or as motivated by previous damnable actions of the victim. Furthermore, the new penal code returns to the traditional distinction between "simple murder" and "murder committed with aforethought or after premeditation". The study endeavors to present a comprehensive commentary on the elements of this new system of homicide law. Therefore it examines the cases of <b>intentional</b> <b>killings</b> committed in a state of a strong non- pathological affect (agitation), further it deals with the issue of provocation of the offender by the victim and eventually it concentrates on the qualifying criteria of premeditation [...] . ...|$|R
2500|$|The third element {{incorporated}} into many definitions {{is that of}} intentionality – the death must be intended, rather than being accidental, and {{the intent of the}} action must be a [...] "merciful death". Michael Wreen argued that [...] "the principal thing that distinguishes euthanasia from <b>intentional</b> <b>killing</b> simpliciter is the agent's motive: it must be a good motive insofar as the good of the person killed is concerned." [...] Similarly, Heather Draper speaks to the importance of motive, arguing that [...] "the motive forms a crucial part of arguments for euthanasia, because it must be {{in the best interests of}} the person on the receiving end." [...] Definitions such as that offered by the House of Lords Select Committee on Medical Ethics take this path, where euthanasia is defined as [...] "a deliberate intervention undertaken with the express intention of ending a life, to relieve intractable suffering." [...] Beauchamp and Davidson also highlight Baruch Brody's [...] "an act of euthanasia is one in which one person... (A) kills another person (B) for the benefit of the second person, who actually does benefit from being killed".|$|E

Subsequently, the thesis applies one's mind to the status of human life in the present.

Right to life is also the subject of many international treaties or declarations, the most important of them are mentioned. One chapter is devoted to question of precise determination the moment of commencement and termination of human life, which is very important for answering the other question, whether the crime of murder or killing, have been committed or not.

50|$|The lead defence {{advocate}} in {{the case}} was Barry Roux. In South African criminal law, murder {{is defined as the}} <b>intentional</b> unlawful <b>killing</b> of another human being. The defence of Pistorius was that, in shooting at what he believed to be an intruder, he mistakenly believed he was acting in self-defence, and as self-defence excludes the unlawfulness requirement of criminal liability, an act in valid self-defence is lawful. Technically his defence amounted to a claim that he did not intend to act unlawfully. If he could raise a reasonable doubt in his favour that he was mistaken, as he claimed, he is entitled, under South African law, to an acquittal on the charge of murder. The court then considered whether this mistake was reasonable - one that a reasonable person, in his circumstances, may have made. If the court concluded that this was an unreasonable mistake, it would convict him of Culpable homicide (all other requirements assumed). Culpable homicide in South African criminal law is defined as the negligent unlawful killing of another human being - roughly the equivalent of the English and US manslaughter.|$|R
40|$|Abstract Background Measuring {{human rights}} {{violations}} is particularly challenging during or after armed conflict. A recent nationwide survey in the Central African Republic produced estimates of rates of grave violations against children and adults affected by armed conflict, using an approach known as the "Neighborhood Method". Methods In June and July, 2009, a random household survey was conducted based on population estimates from the 2003 national census. Clusters were assigned systematically proportional to population size. Respondents in randomly selected households were interviewed regarding incidents of <b>killing,</b> <b>intentional</b> injury, recruitment into armed groups, abduction, sexual abuse and rape between January 1, 2008 and the date of interview, occurring in their homes' and those of their three closest neighbors. Results Sixty of the selected 69 clusters were surveyed. In total, 599 women were interviewed about events in 2, 370 households representing 13, 669 persons. Estimates of annual rates of each violation occurring per 1000 people in each of two strata are provided for {{children between the ages}} of five and 17, adults 18 years of age and older and the entire population five years and older, along with a combined and weighted national rate. The national rates for children age five to 17 were estimated to be 0. 98 / 1000 /year (95 % CI: 0. 18 - 1. 78) for recruitment, 2. 56 / 1000 /year (95 % CI: 1. 50 - 3. 62) for abduction, 1. 13 / 1000 /year (95 % CI: 0. 33 - 1. 93) for intentional injury, 10. 72 / 1000 girls/year (95 % CI: 7. 40 - 14. 04) for rape, and 4. 80 / 1000 girls/year (95 % CI: 2. 61 - 6. 00) for sexual abuse. No reports of any violation against a person under the age of five were recorded and there were no reports of rape or sexual abuse of males. No children were reported to have been killed during the recall period. Rape and abduction were the most frequently reported events. Conclusions The population-based figures greatly augment existing information on {{human rights violations}} in CAR, and represent a step forward in quantifying the protection needs of Central Africans. Government, donors, and international organizations should make use of this data to better inform advocacy, prevention, and response programs, to assist in fundraising, and to develop surveillance activities to monitor child protection concerns. </p...|$|R
