Although he eventually sends her home, she does not remain there. After finding letters addressed to her that reveal he has left on a quest to find her mother (previously believed to be dead), she sets out to find him. As is slowly made clear in the novel, Helen is the narrator's mother. The letters continue the story her father has been telling her. The narrator decides to travel to a monastery where she believes her <b>father</b> <b>might</b> be.|$|E
25|$|In {{all these}} cases, the <b>father</b> <b>might</b> dower her. If he did not, on his death the {{brothers}} were obligated to do so, {{giving her a}} full child's share if a wife, a concubine or a vestal, but one-third of a child's share {{if she were a}} hierodule or a Marduk priestess. The latter had the privilege of exemption from state dues and absolute disposal of her property. All other daughters had only a life interest in their dowry, which reverted to their family if childless or went to their children if they had any. A <b>father</b> <b>might,</b> however, execute a deed granting a daughter power to leave her property to a favorite brother or sister.|$|E

Again, while higher levels of education among <b>fathers</b> <b>might</b> positively affect the speed of transition or the probability of ever finding employment through, for example, valuable labor market contacts or intergenerational persistence in ability and human capital, higher <b>father’s</b> education <b>might</b> also negatively affect durations and the overall probability of employment through an increase in reservation wages.|$|R

25|$|The {{division}} of land is somewhat obscure. One maxim suggests that the youngest son divided the land into equal parts. The eldest chose first, followed by the second and so on until the youngest received the remaining land. The intent was to make {{division of}} land equal. Other laws suggested that the eldest son had automatic claims to the buildings. However, there are some hints that this only happened if a younger son challenged a division. The normal practice was that the eldest son both divided and chose first, but had to divide equally. More rarely, a <b>father</b> <b>might</b> divide the land for his sons in his lifetime.|$|E
25|$|When {{creating}} Himari, author Milan Matra {{opted to}} have her character be easy to draw. He came up with her design easily, but became stuck in regards to her name and her style of speech. Eventually he decided on the name Himari and an old-fashioned speech style. Himari was originally going to have short hair in the final chapter but Matra decided to go with long hair, and use the short haired designs for her evil side, Black Himari, which appears earlier in the series. Himari also has a sister named Hime who was originally {{going to be a}} male character. Matra made the change saying {{that he did not want}} his readers to wrap their hearts around two different male characters which would have also impacted Himari's storyline. When asked at a book fair in Taiwan why he chose a cat to represent the main character, Matra replied that he thinks that cats in general are cute. In the story, Himari states that her mother died while giving birth to her while her <b>father</b> <b>might</b> have been another species of demon cat, or possibly a stray.|$|E

500|$|Dickinson was {{familiar}} {{not only with}} the Bible but also with contemporary popular literature. She was probably influenced by Lydia Maria Child's Letters from New York, another gift from Newton (after reading it, she gushed [...] "This then is a book! And there are more of them!"). Her brother smuggled a copy of Henry Wadsworth Longfellow's Kavanagh into the house for her (because her <b>father</b> <b>might</b> disapprove) and a friend lent her Charlotte Brontë's Jane Eyre in late 1849. Jane Eyres influence cannot be measured, but when Dickinson acquired her first and only dog, a Newfoundland, she named him [...] "Carlo" [...] after the character St. John Rivers' dog. William Shakespeare was also a potent influence in her life. Referring to his plays, she wrote to one friend, [...] "Why clasp any hand but this?" [...] and to another, [...] "Why is any other book needed?" ...|$|E
500|$|The [...] {{are eight}} {{specific}} {{points along the}} chakra circulatory system that limit the overall flow of chakra within a person's body, which prevents the body from expiring too soon. Ninja devised the [...] to surpass their own physical limits {{at the cost of}} various levels of damage to their own bodies. Each additional gate grants the user new levels of strength with additional injuries; by opening all eight gates the user will become invincible in battle, but their body will be so damaged in the process that they will die afterwards. Having learned the release technique from his <b>father,</b> <b>Might</b> Guy taught Rock Lee to open his first five gates during Part I of the series; according to Kakashi Hatake, this is a very remarkable feat as he himself can only open the first gate. Guy goes further by activating {{all the way to the}} eighth gate during Part II, although he states that activating it would kill him. In the [...] movie, the villain Shinnō mentions opening the eight gates when gaining the [...] "perfect body" [...] from his dark chakra transformation.|$|E

50|$|<b>Fathers</b> <b>might</b> claim {{exemption}} (excusatio) {{from public}} charges and from guardianship {{to which they}} were called by law (tutela legitima). The most important application of jus liberorum concerned women. A freeborn woman with three children and a freedwoman with four children (jus trium vel quattuor liberorum) were freed from guardianship to which women were subject (tutela mulierum) and had a right of succession to the inheritance of their children. The women’s jus liberorum was applied even when the children were no longer alive.|$|R
40|$|Paternal {{behaviour}} {{is critical}} {{for the survival of}} offspring in many monogamous species. Common marmoset (Callithrix jacchus) and cotton-top tamarin (Saguinus oedipus) fathers spend as much or more time caring for infants than mothers. Expectant males of both species showed significant increases in weight across the pregnancy whereas control males did not (five consecutive months for marmoset males and six months for cotton-top tamarin males). Expectant <b>fathers</b> <b>might</b> be preparing for the energetic cost of fatherhood by gaining weight during their mate's pregnancy...|$|R

Every couple of years I'd get a postcard from the road – {{a picture of him}} standing next to a giant ice-sculpture of a crab, in Alaska. He was a very mysterious character. But I thought this was the right time to bring him in." [...] "The Next Messiah" [...] was influenced by her father. [...] "When someone isn't around you create what you imagine your <b>father</b> <b>might</b> be – 'a race-car driver, a four-leaf clover'," [...] Lewis explained. Lewis has said that a lot of her inspiration, for both Acid Tongue and previous work, comes from her parents. Lewis also told The Independent, [...] "I just don't know them very well. And I'm still trying to understand what happened [...] and why. It's this blank slate, I can't even remember what happened.

500|$|Different {{kinds of}} homosexuals were {{compared}} {{to see whether they}} had differing developmental histories. The [...] "Identification with Father" [...] variable appeared to be important in the development of homosexuality among effeminate, but not non-effeminate, white homosexual men. Bell et al. noted that failure to identify with the <b>father</b> <b>might</b> serve to encourage effeminacy, but that alternatively boys who were effeminate for other reasons might find it difficult to identify with their fathers. Pre-adult homosexual behavior was more important among men who were not effeminate. Bell et al. suggested that for effeminate males early homosexual feelings were the only important predictor of adult homosexuality, while other males were influenced by a combination of homosexual feelings and other factors. Comparing white bisexual men and white homosexual men, Bell et al. found that for the bisexuals sexual preference was much less strongly connected with pre-adult sexual feelings. Based on this and other findings, they concluded that exclusive homosexuality tends to emerge from a [...] "deep-seated predisposition" [...] but that bisexuality is [...] "more subject to influence by social and sexual learning." [...] Exclusively homosexual white men tended to report that they had not identified with their fathers, but there was no significant tendency for white bisexual men not to identify with their fathers. Only white homosexual men who had undergone psychotherapy had [...] "paternal variables" [...] that were consistent with what clinicians had considered typical of homosexual males.|$|E
500|$|... is {{the leader}} of Team Guy who dedicates most of his time to his pupil Rock Lee, who emulates himself in his sensei's image and ideals, {{including}} his [...] "My Rules" [...] philosophy, which involves setting tough self-imposed penalties for failure in the belief that the punishment will make him stronger. Like Lee, and choosing not to use other ninjutsu skills out of respect for his student, Guy is a specialist in physical attacks and taught Lee many of the techniques that he learned from his <b>father</b> <b>Might</b> Dai, such as the ability to unlock the Eight Gates which safely restrict the flow of chakra through the body. When not teaching Lee new abilities, Guy is usually found competing with his self-proclaimed childhood rival, Kakashi Hatake. Throughout the series, Kakashi has never displayed a particular interest in their rivalry, which only further motivates Guy to defeat Kakashi and his [...] "coolness". Guy is an extremely capable ninja as seen in his fight against Itachi Uchiha and his recurring confrontations with Kisame Hoshigaki, beating him single-handedly on two occasions. During the Fourth Great Ninja War, Guy is forced to use the Eighth Gate in a failed attempt to defeat Madara. Though Naruto uses the power of the Sage of Six Paths to save his life, Guy's right leg was too damaged to be fully healed. Though he is not wavered from his shinobi career, he remains in a paraplegic state by the events of the epilogue.|$|E

2500|$|Willow's {{religion}} and sexuality {{have made her}} {{a role model for}} audiences.

Willow at times reminds the other characters of her religion, wondering what her <b>father</b> <b>might</b> think of the crucifixes she must apply to her bedroom wall to keep out vampires, and commenting that Santa Claus misses her house every Christmas because of the [...] "big honkin' menorah". Buffy essayist Matthew Pateman criticizes the show for presenting Willow's Jewish identity only when it opposes Christian declarations of holidays and other traditions. The New York Times, however, named her as a positive example of a depiction of a Jewish woman, who stood out among portrayals of Jews as harsh, unfeminine, and shallow. Producer Gail Berman states that as a Jew, Willow [...] "handles herself just fine, thank you".|$|E
2500|$|Tennyson and {{his family}} were allowed to stay in the rectory for some time, but later moved to Beech Hill Park, High Beach, deep within Epping Forest, Essex, about 1837. Tennyson’s son recalled: “there was a pond in the park on which in winter my <b>father</b> <b>might</b> be seen skating, sailing about on the ice in his long blue cloak. [...] He liked the {{nearness}} of London, whether he resorted to see his friends, but he could not stay in town even for a night, his mother being in such a nervous state that he did not like to leave her..." [...] Tennyson befriended a Dr Allen, who ran a nearby asylum whose patients then included the poet John Clare. [...] An unwise investment in Dr Allen's ecclesiastical wood-carving enterprise soon led to the loss of much of the family fortune, and led to a bout of serious depression. Tennyson moved to London in 1840 and lived for a time at Chapel House, Twickenham.|$|E
