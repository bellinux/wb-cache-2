25|$|In general, fMRI studies acquire both many {{functional}} {{images with}} fMRI and a structural image with MRI. The structural image is usually {{of a higher}} resolution and depends on a different signal, the T1 magnetic field decay after excitation. To demarcate regions {{of interest in the}} functional image, one needs to align it with the structural one. Even when whole-brain analysis is done, to interpret the final results, that <b>is</b> <b>to</b> <b>figure</b> <b>out</b> which regions the active voxels fall in, one has to align the functional image to the structural one. This is done with a coregistration algorithm that works similar to the motion-correction one, except that here the resolutions are different, and the intensity values cannot be directly compared since the generating signal is different.|$|E

[...] She has tried to institutionalize this change, by making social media a focus for foreign service officers and up to the ambassadorial level. (Other Clinton initiatives were run solely out of her office and were at risk of disappearing after she left office.) By late 2011, the department had 288 Facebook accounts and 192 Twitter feeds.
