5000|$|Capacitance probe, or <b>fringe</b> <b>{{capacitance}}</b> sensor. Capacitance probes use capacitance {{to measure}} the dielectric permittivity of the soil. The volume {{of water in the}} total volume of soil most heavily influences the dielectric permittivity of the soil because the dielectric of water (80) is much greater than the other constituents of the soil (mineral soil: 4, organic matter: 4, air: 1). Thus, when the amount of water changes in the soil, the probe will measure a change in capacitance (from the change in dielectric permittivity) that can be directly correlated with a change in water content. Circuitry inside some commercial probes change the capacitance measurement into a proportional millivolt output. Other configuration are like the neutron probe where an access tube made of PVC is installed in the soil. The probe consists of sensing head at fixed depth. The sensing head consists of an oscillator circuit, the frequency is determined by an annular electrode, fringe-effect capacitor, and the dielectric constant of the soil.|$|E

However, at extremely scaled gate lengths (3 ̆c 20 nm), these devices pose some serious challenges such as increased drain-induced-barrier-lowering (DIBL), exponentially higher leakage, dominating parasitic capacitances and large process variations. We propose device optimization techniques for multiple-gate FETs to reduce power dissipation and improve robustness in logic and memories.

In these bound water materials, the errors in the traditional time-domain-reflectometer, “TDR”, exceed the range of the full span of the material’s permittivity that is being measured. Thus, there is a critical need to re-examine the TDR system and identify where the errors are to direct future research. One promising technique to address the increasing demands for higher accuracy water content measurements is utilization of electrical permittivity characterization of materials. This technique has enjoyed a strong following in the soil-science and geological community through measurements of apparent permittivity via time-domain-reflectometery as well in many process control applications. Recent research however, is indicating a need to increase the accuracy beyond that available from traditional TDR. The most logical pathway then becomes a transition from TDR based measurements to network analyzer measurements of absolute permittivity that will remove the adverse effects that high surface area soils and conductivity impart onto the measurements of apparent permittivity in traditional TDR applications. This research examines the theoretical basis behind the coaxial probe, from which the modern TDR probe originated from, to provide a basis on which to perform absolute permittivity measurements. The research reveals currently utilized formulations in accepted techniques for permittivity measurements which violate the underlying assumptions inherent in the basic models due to the TDR acting as an antenna by radiating energy off the end of the probe, rather than returning it back to the source as is the current assumption. To remove the effects of radiation from the experimental results obtain herein, this research utilized custom designed coaxial probes of various diameters and probe lengths by which to test the coaxial cell measurement technique for accuracy in determination of absolute permittivity. In doing so, the research reveals that the basic models available in the literature all omitted a key correction factor that is hypothesized by this research as being most likely due to <b>fringe</b> <b>capacitance.</b> To test this theory, a Poisson model of a coaxial cell was formulated to calculate the effective extra length provided by the <b>fringe</b> <b>capacitance</b> which is then used to correct the experimental results such that experimental measurements utilizing differing coaxial cell diameters and probe lengths, upon correction with the Poisson model derived correction factor, all produce the same results thereby lending support for the use of an augmented measurement technique, described herein, for {{measurement of}} absolute permittivity, as opposed to the traditional TDR measurement of apparent permittivity...|$|E

The radio frequency (RF) performance of FinFET is affected by gate-controlled parameters such as transconductance, output conductance, and total gate capacitance. In recent years, high-k spacer dielectric materials for manufacturing nanoscale devices are being widely explored because of their better electrostatic control and being less affected by short channel effects (SCEs). In this paper, we aim to explore the potential benefits of using different Dual-k spacers on source and drain, respectively: (AsymD-kk) trigate FinFET structure to improve the analog/RF figure of merit (FOM) for low-power operation at 14 nm gate length. It has been observed from the results that the AsymD-kk FinFET structure improves the coupling of the gate fringe field to the underlap region towards the source and drain side, improving the transconductance (gm) and output conductance (gds) at the cost of an increase in Miller capacitance. Furthermore, to reduce the drain field influence on the channel region, we also studied the effect of asymmetric drain extension length on a Dual-kk FinFET structure. It can be observed that the new asymmetric drain extension structures significantly improve the cutoff frequency (fT) and maximum oscillation frequency (fmax) given the significant reduction of inner <b>fringe</b> <b>capacitance</b> towards drain side due to the shifting of the drain extension’s doping concentration away from the gate edge.

However linear increase in the parasitic <b>fringing</b> <b>capacitance</b> with high-k dielectrics is observed. This leads to increase in the electric field and degrades the performance of DG-FinFETs. This degradation can be controlled by using high k as spacers. Our results prove that DG-FinFET has a scalable structure upto 10 nm and La 2 O 3 /LaAlO 3 (k= 30) as a promising scope of gate material for 22 nm and below gate lengths up to 10 nm...|$|R
40|$|Touch sensing {{has been}} widely {{implemented}} as a main methodology to bridge human and machine interactions. The traditional touch sensing range is two dimensional and therefore limits the user experience. The required physical contact inherent of the technology creates several disadvantages, including unresponsiveness due to wet fingers, and unavoidable fingerprint residue on the screen surface. To overcome these limitations, we propose a novel 3 D contactless touch sensing system called Airtouch System, which improves user experience by remotely detecting single/multi-finger position. A single layer touch panel with triangular electrodes is used to achieve 3 D multi-touch detection capability as well as manufacturing cost reduction. A lumped model of the touch panel is proposed to model the touch panel property and define the system specification. The hardware part of the proposed 3 D touch sensor uses correlated double sampling (CDS) to achieve a high sensing resolution in Z direction and employs bootstrapping circuitry to reduce the mobile screen’s inter-channel-coupling effects. Additionally, to reduce chip area and assembly, the sensing oscillator is implemented with inverter-based active resonators instead of using either on or off chip inductors. The prototyped 3 D touch sensor is fabricated using 65 -nm CMOS process technology and consumes an area of 2 mm 2. To detect the finger position in space, a new algorithm for finger position estimation is created with grouping filter invented to reduce system background noise. The algorithm is proposed to eliminate the <b>fringing</b> <b>capacitance</b> effect and achieve accurate finger position estimation. EM simulation proved that by taking account of <b>fringing</b> <b>capacitance</b> effect, the proposed algorithm reduced the systematic error by 11 dB in the horizontal position detection. Accurate Z direction detection is achieved through using 2 nd order polynomial curve to fit the EM model and compensate the non-linear <b>fringing</b> <b>capacitance</b> effect. The proposed system’s hardware circuit consumes 2. 3 mW and is fully compatible with existing mobile device environments. A prototype is built {{to demonstrate that the}} system can successfully detect finger movement in a vertical direction up to 6 cm and achieve a horizontal resolution up to 0. 6 cm at 1 cm finger-height. As a new interface for human and machine interactions, this system offers great potential in 3 D gesture recognition for small-sized electronics and advanced human interactive games for mobile devices...|$|R
