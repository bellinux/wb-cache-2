50|$|Equine {{infectious}} anemia or equine <b>infectious</b> <b>anaemia</b> (EIA), {{also known}} by horsemen as swamp fever, is a horse disease {{caused by a}} retrovirus and transmitted by bloodsucking insects. The virus (EIAV) is endemic in the Americas, parts of Europe, the Middle and Far East, Russia, and South Africa. The virus is a lentivirus, like human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). Like HIV, EIA can be transmitted through blood, milk, and body secretions.Transmission is primarily through biting flies, such as the horse-fly and deer-fly. The virus survives up to 4 hours in the vector (epidemiology). Contaminated surgical equipment and recycled needles and syringes, and bits can transmit the disease. Mares can transmit the disease to their foals via the placenta.The risk of transmitting the disease is greatest when an infected horse is ill, as the blood levels of the virus are then highest.|$|E

Several QTL have been mapped in the salmon genome, explaining unprecedented levels of phenotypic variation. Owing to the relatively large selection intensity, individual loci may be indirectly selected, leaving molecular footprints of selection, together with increased inbreeding, as its likely relatives will share the selected loci. We used population differentiation and levels of linkage disequilibrium in chromosomes known to be harbouring QTL for body weight, infectious pancreatic necrosis resistance and <b>infectious</b> salmon <b>anaemia</b> resistance to assess the recent selection history at the genomic level in Atlantic salmon. The results clearly suggest that the marker SSA 0343 BSFU on chromosome 3 (body weight QTL) showed strong evidence of directional selection.

Sixteen fish samples obtained in 2007 and 2008 from 4 different farms in Chile were examined. The real-time RT-PCR allowed the detection of ISAV in FFPE samples from 9 of 16 fish, regardless of the organs analyzed, whereas 4 of the real-time RT-PCR negative fish were positive as indicated by histological examination and 3 of the real-time RT-PCR positive fish were negative as indicated by immunohistochemistry evaluation. The presence of ISAV in RT-PCR positive samples was confirmed by amplicon sequencing. This work constitutes the first report on the use of real-time RT-PCR for the detection of ISAV in FFPE sections. The assay is very useful for the examination of archival wax-embedded tissues, and allows for both prospective and retrospective evaluation of tissue samples for the presence of ISAV. However, the method only confirms the presence of the pathogen and should be used in combination with histopathology, which is a more precise tool.

40|$|Atlantic {{salmon is}} the only species in which the disease <b>infectious</b> salmon <b>anaemia</b> (ISA) has been {{observed}} naturally. Initial reports of findings of <b>infectious</b> salmon <b>anaemia</b> virus (ISAV) before 2002, did not distinguish between non virulent HPR 0 and virulent HPRΔ viruses, thus making interpretation of older findings difficult {{in the light of}} current knowledge. Following a request from the European Commission, EFSA was asked to deliver a scientific opinion on the relationship between HPR 0 and HPRΔ, the risk of HPRΔ ISAV emerging from HPR 0 ISAV, and possible risk factors for such an emergence. HPR 0 ISAV does not cause clinical disease in Atlantic salmon; however, it causes a transient subclinical infection and replicates mainly in gills. There is no evidence for HPR 0 ISAV leading to natural infection and replication in fish species other than Atlantic salmon. Virulent ISAV have deletions in the HPR region of the HE gene and they have either an insertion or the Q 266 L mutation in the F gene. The most plausible hypothesis is that virulent ISAV (HPRΔ) is derived from HPR 0 ISAV. This is further supported by the close association between the genetic relatedness and spatio-temporal distances of virus strains in solitary outbreaks. Epidemiological and historical data from solitary disease outbreaks indicates that the risk of HPRΔ ISAV emerging from HPR 0 is low, but not negligible. The risk factors for HPRΔ emergence from HPR 0 are unknown. Nevertheless, any factor that affects virus replication or host susceptibility could possibly influence the risk of emergence. More research is needed on the drivers for transition from HPR 0 to HPRΔ and factors affecting host susceptibility and thereby emergence of clinical disease.

40|$|Abstract Background <b>Infectious</b> Salmon <b>Anaemia</b> (ISA) is a {{viral disease}} {{affecting}} farmed Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar) worldwide. The identification of Quantitative Trait Loci (QTL) affecting {{resistance to the}} disease could improve our understanding of the genetics underlying the trait and provide a means for Marker-Assisted Selection. We previously performed a genome scan on commercial Atlantic salmon families challenge tested for ISA resistance, identifying several putative QTL. In the present study, we set out to validate the strongest of these QTL in a larger family material coming from the same challenge test, and to determine the position of the QTL by interval mapping. We also wanted to explore different ways of performing QTL analysis within a survival analysis framework (i. e. using time-to-event data), and to compare results using survival analysis with results from analysis on the dichotomous trait 'affected/resistant'. Results The QTL, located on Atlantic salmon linkage group 8 (following SALMAP notation), was confirmed in the new data set. Its most likely position was at a marker cluster containing markers BHMS 130, BHMS 170 and BHMS 553. Significant segregation distortion was observed in the same region, but was shown to be unrelated to the QTL. A maximum likelihood procedure for identifying QTL, based on the Cox proportional hazard model, was developed. QTL mapping was also done using the Haley-Knott method (affected/resistant data), and within a variance-component framework (affected/resistant data and time-to-event data). In all cases, analysis using affected/resistant data gave stronger evidence for a QTL than did analysis using time-to-event data. Conclusion A QTL for resistance to <b>Infectious</b> Salmon <b>Anaemia</b> in Atlantic salmon was validated in this study, and its more precise location on linkage group eight was determined. The QTL explained 6 % of the phenotypic variation in resistance to the disease. The linkage group also displayed significant segregation distortion.

The virus offers a significant challenge to fish biologists interested in diagnosis and control of ISA, and to molecular virologists because of its evolutionary relationship with influenza viruses. Being an orthomyxovirus, ISAV is expected to be prone to genetic and antigenic variation. However, while the ISAV genome, like the influenza A virus genome, encodes at least nine structural proteins, the gene order and putative functional identities of the ISAV proteins are significantly different from those of influenza viruses. Although the virulence of influenza A viruses is a polygenic trait, one virulence factor is correlated with the haemagglutinin cleavage site.

40|$|Abstract <b>Infectious</b> salmon <b>anaemia</b> (ISA) virus (ISAV) is a fish orthomyxovirus {{that has}} {{recently}} been assigned to the new genus Isavirus within the family Orthomyxoviridae. It possesses the major functional characteristics of the virus family including haemagglutinating, receptor destroying enzyme (RDE), and fusion activities associated with the virion surface proteins. It is generally accepted that ISAV agglutinates erythrocytes of several fish species and that the ISAV RDE activity dissolves this haemagglutination reaction except for Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar) erythrocytes. We used electron microscopy to examine the physical interaction between ISAV and erythrocytes from Atlantic salmon and rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss) during haemagglutination. We present evidence that ISAV enters into Atlantic salmon erythrocytes. Atlantic salmon erythrocytes incubated with ISAV for 4 hours showed endocytosis of the virus particles, {{which is consistent with}} virus infection. These observations suggest that the lack of dissolution of ISAV-induced haemagglutination of Atlantic salmon erythrocytes favours virus infection of the erythrocytes. Moreover, such a haemagglutination-infection phenotype is fundamentally different from haemagglutination by avian and mammalian orthomyxoviruses, and is indicative of a different pathogenesis for the fish orthomyxovirus. </p...|$|R
