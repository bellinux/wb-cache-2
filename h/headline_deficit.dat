50|$|Structural and {{cyclical}} deficits are {{two components}} of deficit spending. These terms are especially applied to public sector spending which {{contributes to the}} budget balance of the overall economy of a country. The total budget deficit, or <b>headline</b> <b>deficit,</b> {{is equal to the}} sum of the structural deficit and the cyclical deficit (or surplus/es).|$|E
5000|$|Correction {{of deficit}} deviations: If a {{significant}} deviation (more than 0.5% of GDP) from the MTO or the adjustment path towards it, is observed on {{basis of an}} overall assessment with the structural balance as a reference (including analysis of the [...] "expenditure benchmark"), the automatic correction mechanism shall immediately correct the situation through implementation of counter measures being effective after {{a short period of}} time, unless the deviation has been caused by [...] "extraordinary events outside control of the Member State" [...] or the arrival of a [...] "severe economic downturn". In June 2014, the Council endorsed the following cited method to assess whether or not [...] "effective action" [...] {{during the course of the}} past two years had been taken by a state with an open ongoing EDP, which is checked for to figure out if the state managed to follow its required [...] "adjustment path towards respecting its MTO" [...] or should have implemented additional corrective measures through its automatic correction mechanism during the period: The assessment starts by comparing the <b>headline</b> <b>deficit</b> target and the recommended improvement in the structural balance, as notified by the latest Council recommendation to the state, with the <b>headline</b> <b>deficit</b> and the apparent fiscal effort measured by the change in structural budget balance. If not achieved, the Commission will carry out a [...] "careful analysis" [...] based on (1) a top-down assessment of the adjusted change of the structural balance (adjusting for: (i) the impact of revisions in potential GDP growth compared with the growth scenario underpinning the Council recommendation, (ii) the impact of revenue windfalls/shortfalls relative to the ones used in the baseline scenario, and (iii) the negative impact of the changeover to ESA 2010 on the cost of tax credits) and (2) a bottom-up assessment of the consolidation measures undertaken by the authorities for the period in concern (which differs from the adjusted top-down assessment by calculating the structural adjustment effort unaffected by potential changes in public debt interest rates and potential changes of the GDP deflator - compared to the forecast figures utilized by the baseline scenario in the previous 126(7) report calling for [...] "effective action to end an excessive deficit"). In the event that both (1)+(2) return a shortfall for the targeted structural deficit improvements, the state will be deemed not to have implemented the required amount of corrective measures, equal to the launch of a 126(9) report requiring immediate effective action to be taken to make up for the recorded shortfall.|$|E
50|$|An {{example of}} this {{occurred}} in Australia during the later years of the Howard Government. From 2009 Treasury attempted to separate cyclical and structural components of the budget balance, and first started publishing estimates of the structural component. Treasury showed that despite a run of large and often unexpected headline surpluses, the Australian economy was in fact in structural deficit from at least 2006-07, and was deteriorating {{as far back as}} 2002-03. At this time they determined that despite a headline surplus of A$17.2 billion in 2006-07, there was an underlying structural deficit of around $3 billion, or 0.3% of GDP. This structural deficit was caused by a mining boom leading to extremely high revenues and large surpluses for several consecutive years, which the Howard Government then used to fuel spending and tax cuts, rather than saving or investing them to cover future cyclical downturns. With the Global Financial Crisis unexpectedly starting in 2007, revenues quickly and significantly declined and the underlying structural deficit was exposed and exacerbated, which then had to be dealt with by later governments. By 2008-09 when the budget had a <b>headline</b> <b>deficit</b> of $32 billion, the structural deficit was out to around $50 billion. In 2013 it was estimated the structural deficit remained at about $40 billion, or 2.5% of GDP.|$|E
5000|$|The {{truth is}} the {{coalition}} government have {{made a decision that}} they want to expand PFI {{at a time when the}} value for money credentials of the system have never been weaker. The government is very concerned to keep the <b>headline</b> rates of <b>deficit</b> and debt down, so it's looking to use an increasingly expensive form of borrowing through an intermediary knowing the investment costs won't immediately show up on their budgets.|$|R
40|$|As {{information}} becomes {{ever more}} quantitative and as society relies increasingly on {{computers and the}} data they produce, literacy requirements expand beyond natural language to include logical reasoning and quantitative practices. Ever since computers opened the floodgates of the information age, we have been caught in {{a rising tide of}} numbers. The ascendancy of quantitative information has changed profoundly not only the environment in which we live and work, but also the entire framework of civic life. <b>Headlines</b> proclaim <b>deficit</b> projections and unemployment numbers, holiday deaths and political polls. Editorialists debate the impact of unemployment figures on stock market trends, the cost savings of managed health care, and the impact of estrogen supplements on breast cancer rates. Behind the scenes, the mechanisms of everyday life depend increasingly on digital technologyâ€” from cellular phones to ATM machines, from bar codes to the World Wide Web. Like hundreds of other matters small and large that command our daily attention, these constructs of modern civilization depend at their deepest level on quantitative information. Doe...|$|R
40|$|The {{introduction}} of accrual accounting principles for government reporting {{in recent years}} has been complicated by the presence of two alternative financial reporting frameworks, the Government Finance Statistics (GFS) framework and the Australian professional accounting standard rules. This paper presents the findings from a study of the 2004 - 05 and 2005 - 06 annual budgets prepared by the Australian Commonwealth government and the governments of the six Australian States and the two Australian Territories. The study examined the basis for the budget balance numbers (government surplus or <b>deficit)</b> <b>headlined</b> in the budgets of each of the nine governments over the two year period. Findings indicate the adoption of varying measurement bases and a resultant lack of inter-governmental and inter temporal comparability. A number of departures from the measurements prescribed in the reporting frameworks were also observed. <br /...|$|R
40|$|The cyclically-adjusted budget balance (CAB) plays a {{key role}} in the fiscal {{surveillance}} framework of the Economic and Monetary Union. It started off in a supporting role in the shadow of the <b>headline</b> <b>deficit</b> and, before long, turned into the linchpin of the rules and requirements of the Stability and Growth Pact. The steep ascent was driven by high hopes and expectations which, with the passing of time were only partly met. The everyday practice of the EU fiscal surveillance rapidly revealed a number of caveats of the instrument which, at times, hampered the effectiveness of fiscal surveillance. This paper provides a comprehensive review of the changing fortunes of the CAB in the EU fiscal surveillance framework. It portrays its main shortcomings and the way they can be dealt with in practice. As an overall conclusion the paper argues that, although the CAB is not devoid of problems and imperfections, it is superior to the <b>headline</b> <b>deficit</b> in most respects. budget balance, cyclical adjustment, EU fiscal surveillance framework, Larch, Turrini...|$|E
40|$|The {{budgetary}} {{position in the}} euro area and the EU improved significantly in 2007 compared to the previous year. The <b>headline</b> <b>deficit</b> declined to 1. 6 % of GDP in 2006 and 1. 1 % of GDP in 2007, down from 2. 5 % of GDP in 2005. The structural budget deficit diminished from 2 % of GDP in 2005 to 0. 8 % in 2007, reflecting a restrictive fiscal policy in euro area. The fiscal policy became pro-cyclically because the economy of euro area {{is characterized by a}} slightly negative output-gap (estimated at 0. 2 % of potential GDP in 2007) ...|$|E
