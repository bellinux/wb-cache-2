5|$|Cabin <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Cotton</b> (1932) is a Warner Bros. message {{film about}} the evils of capitalism. The film takes place in an {{unspecified}} southern state where workers are given barely enough to survive and taken advantage of by being charged exorbitant interest rates and high prices by unscrupulous landowners. The film is decidedly anti-capitalist; however, its preface claims otherwise: In the end, however, the planters admit their wrongdoing and agree to a more equitable distribution of capital.|$|E
5|$|Construction of the Murrays' second mill, Decker Mill, {{had begun}} by 1801 {{to the east}} of Old Mill. It was the same height as Old Mill and doubled the size of the complex. Decker Mill was {{completed}} in time to exploit the economic boom <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>cotton</b> trade that followed the brief peace in the war with France from 1802–1803. During its construction, the steam engine was replaced a more powerful 40hp Boulton and Watt engine.|$|E
40|$|Transgenic Bt cotton {{developed}} against lepidopteran pests may not {{be compatible}} with parasitoid of secondary pests such as Bemisia tabaci which attack many plants such as <b>cotton.</b> <b>In</b> this study, <b>the</b> effects of Bt <b>cotton</b> on <b>the</b> demographic parameters of Encarsia formosa, parasitoid of B. tabaci were assessed. The data were analysed using the age specific, two-sex life table parameters. The results indicated that pre-adult developmental time, the total preoviposition period (TPOP) and the adult preoviposition period (APOP) <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Bt <b>cotton</b> were significantly longer than <b>in</b> <b>the</b> non-Bt <b>cotton.</b> Also, fecundity and body size in both lines were significantly different. The fecundity was 23. 64 ± 0. 73 and 43. 75 ± 0. 89 eggs/females <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Bt and non-Bt <b>cotton,</b> respectively. All <b>the</b> population parameters were affected by <b>the</b> Bt <b>cotton.</b> <b>The</b> intrinsic rate of increase (r) was 0. 15 day- 1 <b>in</b> <b>the</b> non-Bt <b>cotton</b> but it was 0. 10 day- 1 <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Bt <b>cotton.</b> <b>The</b> finite rate of increase (λ) was 1. 11 day- 1 <b>in</b> <b>the</b> non-Bt <b>cotton</b> whilst it was 1. 08 <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Bt <b>cotton.</b> <b>The</b> net reproductive rate (R 0) <b>in</b> <b>the</b> non-Bt <b>cotton</b> was 36. 75 but <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Bt <b>cotton</b> these parameters showed 19. 62 offspring/individual. Also, the mean generation time (T) <b>in</b> <b>the</b> non-Bt and Bt cotton was 22. 69 and 27. 79 days, respectively. The results illustrated, that although transgenic crops are effective tools for management of the target pests, they can adversely affect, either directly or indirectly, the natural enemies dependent on these plants...|$|R

5|$|From the 1830s onward, Mobile {{expanded}} into {{a city of}} commerce with a primary focus on the cotton and slave trades. Many slaves were transported by ship in the coastwise slave trade from the Upper South. There were many businesses in the city related to the slave trade – people to make clothes, food, and supplies for the slave traders and their wards. The city's booming businesses attracted merchants from the North; by 1850 10% of its population was from New York City, which was deeply involved <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>cotton</b> industry. Mobile was the slave-trading center of the state until the 1850s, when it was surpassed by Montgomery.|$|E

5|$|The high European {{demand for}} the product enabled Zahir to grow wealthy and finance his {{autonomous}} sheikhdom. This control of the cotton market also allowed him to gain unofficial control over all of the Sidon Eyalet, outside the city of Sidon itself. With mixed success, Zahir attempted to have French merchant ships redirected from the ports of Tyre and Sidon to Haifa instead, in order {{to benefit from the}} customs fees he could exact. The city of Acre underwent an economic boom {{as a result of its}} position <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>cotton</b> trade with France, and became the fortified headquarters of Zahir's sheikhdom.|$|E
5|$|To aid the {{performances}} of his team, Sudell recruited several Scottish players, giving them nominal jobs <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>cotton</b> mill he managed. After a dispute arising from payments to players resulted in Preston's withdrawal from the 1884 FA Cup, Sudell became an outspoken proponent of professionalism. His actions resulted in the acceptance of professionalism by the Football Association (FA), and led to Preston becoming the leading team of the early professional era. Under Sudell's leadership, Preston North End became founder members of the Football League, and won a league and cup double, going unbeaten for the entire season.|$|E

5|$|As silk was {{a luxury}} good, {{the market was}} small and easily {{saturated}} by machine produced goods. The next innovation in machine produced textiles came <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>cotton</b> industry which had a much wider market and produced more affordable goods. Spinning cotton was a more complex process than silk production. The water frame for spinning cotton was developed by Richard Arkwright and patented in 1769. The machines could spin yarn continuously and replaced skilled workers with unskilled supervisors {{to make sure the}} machines didn't break. Water frames varied in size from 4 to 96spindles. For these reasons, the water frame became popular and widespread. In 1771, Richard Arkwright took a lease on land in Cromford. By 1774, his first mill was operational, and in 1776 he began construction of a second mill at Cromford. During this time, he developed machines for pre-spinning and in 1775 took out his second patent. With spinning mechanised, the other processes involved in producing cotton could not keep up and also required mechanisation. He produced a machine for carding, the process which laid out the cotton fibres parallel, however not all his inventions were successful and cleaning the cotton was performed by hand until the 1790s when an effective machine was invented.|$|E

In February 2002, the NCAA found Alabama violated multiple rules, and as part of its penalty a two-year bowl ban was imposed to include both the 2002 and 2003 seasons. Eligible again to compete in bowl games, Mike Shula led Alabama to the Music City Bowl and a victory <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Cotton</b> Bowl.
