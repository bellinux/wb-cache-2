40|$|Extensive {{experience}} with the analysis of human prophase chromosomes and studies into the complexity of prophase GTG-banding patterns have suggested {{that at least some}} prophase chromosomal segments can be accurately identified and characterized independently of the morphology of the chromosome as a whole. In this dissertation the feasibility of identifying and analyzing specified prophase chromosome segments was thus investigated as an alternative approach to prophase chromosome analysis based on whole chromosome recognition. Through the use of prophase idiograms at the 850 -band-stage (FRANCKE, 1981) and a comparison system based on the calculation of cross-correlation coefficients between <b>idiogram</b> profiles, we have demonstrated {{that it is possible to}} divide the 24 human prophase idiograms into a set of 94 unique band sequences. Each unique band sequence has a banding pattern that is recognizable and distinct from any other non-homologous chromosome portion. ^ Using chromosomes 11 p and 16 thru 22 to demonstrate unique band sequence integrity at the chromosome level, we found that prophase chromosome banding pattern variation can be compensated for and that a set of unique band sequences very similar to those at the <b>idiogram</b> level can be identified on actual chromosomes. ^ The use of a unique band sequence approach in prophase chromosome analysis is expected to increase efficiency and sensitivity through more effective use of available banding information. The use of a unique band sequence approach to prophase chromosome analysis is discussed both at the routine level by cytogeneticists and at an image processing level with a semi-automated approach to prophase chromosome analysis. ...|$|E

The <b>idiogram</b> of hybrids (Bos grunniens L. S x Bos taurus L. !) represents roughly an average of parental idiograms. Numerous authors have studied the chromosomes of some hybrid animals and their parental species {{for the purpose of}} explaining the infertility of interspecific hybrids (B ASRUR and MooN, 19 67; LA Y and NADr,!R, ig 6 g; MA!NO et al., 19 63). The great differences existing between the karyotypes of certain species constitute probably the causes of the infertility of their hybrids (MnxiNO et al., ig 6 3). In Yak karyotype was described by ZUITIN by means of histological methods, as being made up of 62 (Z UITIN, 1935) and then of 60 chromosomes (Z UI TIN, 193 8).

40|$|Background: Aedes aegypti, {{the yellow}} fever mosquito, is an {{efficient}} vector of arboviruses and a convenient model system for laboratory research. Extensive linkage mapping of morphological and molecular markers localized {{a number of}} quantitative trait loci (QTLs) related to the mosquito’s ability to transmit various pathogens. However, linking the QTLs to Ae. aegypti chromosomes and genomic sequences has been challenging because of the poor quality of polytene chromosomes and the highly fragmented genome assembly for this species. Methodology/Principal Findings: Based on the approach developed in our previous study, we constructed <b>idiograms</b> for mitotic chromosomes of Ae. aegypti based on their banding patterns at early metaphase. These <b>idiograms</b> represent the first cytogenetic map developed for mitotic chromosomes of Ae. aegypti. One hundred bacterial artificial chromosome clones carrying major genetic markers were hybridized to the chromosomes using fluorescent in situ hybridization. As a result, QTLs related to the transmission of the filarioid nematode Brugia malayi, the avian malaria parasite Plasmodium gallinaceum, and the dengue virus, as well as sex determination locus and 183 Mbp of genomic sequences were anchored to the exact positions on Ae. aegypti chromosomes. A linear regression analysis demonstrated a good correlation between positions of the markers on the physical and linkage maps. As {{a result of the}} recombination rate variation along the chromosomes, 12 QTLs on the linkage map were combined into five major clusters of QTLs on the chromosome map...|$|R

The karyotypes presented contain considerably more bands than contemporary karyotypes and provide much greater resolution for linear differentiation. The X chromosome of the sheep is acrocentric, rather than having a minute p arm as recently reported. A side -by-side comparison of high-resolution G-band sheep and goat chromosomes indicates identical equivalence of banding patterns. Of special note is the homology of banding patterns for the six acrocentric autosomes of the goat and the respective three submetacentric autosomes of the sheep, reinforcing the evidence that the goat is representative of the ancestral karyotype. C-bands and NORs of the sheep and goat are also presented. When C-banded, the centromeric regions of the sheep and goat acrocentric autosomes were found to be densely stained. The centromeric regions of the X and Y, however, were not stained differently from the chromosome arms. In the sheep submetacentrics, chromosomes 1 and 3 showed weak C-bands while chromosome 2 showed stronger bands. In the sheep and goat, 10 NORs located terminally on five chromosomes pairs were found. Sheep NORs occurred on the three pairs of submetacentric autosomes and on one large and one small pair of acrocentric autosomes. Goat NORs occurred on four large and one small pair of acrocentric autosomes. Sine the banding patterns obtained when staining for NORs do not permit individual identification of each chromosome, duplicate G-banding and silver staining of elongated chromosomes of both sheep and goat would need to be conducted to identify specific NOR-bearing chromosomes...|$|E
