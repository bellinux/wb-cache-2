Improper application of these factors can limit the body's ability to reach an anabolic status.

40|$|Canola (Brassica napus) {{has become}} a major crop grown in {{rotation}} with spring wheat and lupins in Western Australia (WA) since the mid 1990 s. Most soils in WA are highly weathered with very low levels of phosphorus (P). The WA soils initially contained adequate indigenous soil potassium (K) for cropping but removal of K over time in the harvested grains has gradually resulted in the some soils becoming deficient in K for grain production. The sulphur (S) status of WA soils was maintained when single superphosphate (containing about 11 per cent S) was widely used as P fertiliser. The increased and widespread use of <b>fertilisers</b> <b>containing</b> lower S levels than single superphosphate, such as DAP and MAP is likely to increase S deficiency in canola. Furthermore, S deficiency has more frequently been identified in canola crops (compared with wheat and lupins). Consequently <b>fertilisers</b> <b>containing</b> P, K and S are now applied to most canola crops. Fertiliser costs represent {{a significant part of the}} variable costs of growing crops in WA. Chen et al. (2009) identified the need for improved soil test interpretation for making fertiliser recommendations due to substantial changes in farming systems, fertiliser practices and crop yield potential since earlier calibrations were developed. The aims of this study were (1) to compile experimental data containing the standard soil test measurements and observed canola crop yield responses for both nil and fertilised treatments across different soil types and seasons from published or unpublished sources, and (2) to critically analyse soil test-crop response relationships to derive better critical soil test values in soils and environments suitable for canola grain production in WA...|$|R

2500|$|Phosphorus is an {{essential}} plant nutrient (often the limiting nutrient), and the bulk of all phosphorus production is in concentrated phosphoric acids for agriculture <b>fertilisers,</b> <b>containing</b> as much as 70% to 75% P2O5. Its annual demand is rising nearly {{twice as fast as}} the growth of the human population. That led to large increase in phosphate (PO43−) production {{in the second half of}} the 20th century. Artificial phosphate fertilisation is necessary because phosphorus is essential to all life organisms, natural phosphorus-bearing compounds are mostly insoluble and inaccessible to plants, and the natural cycle of phosphorus is very slow. [...] Fertiliser is often in the form of superphosphate of lime, a mixture of calcium dihydrogen phosphate (Ca(H2PO4)2), and calcium sulfate dihydrate (CaSO4·2H2O) produced reacting sulfuric acid and water with calcium phosphate.|$|R
40|$|Micronutrient disorders, {{especially}} B, Cu, Fe, Mn and Zn, {{have been}} recorded for eucalypts in nearly all the geographical regions where commercial plantations have been established. Whilst micronutrient disorders are often induced by the application of <b>fertilisers</b> <b>containing</b> only macronutrients, instances of primary B deficiency in China and Cu deficiency in Australia have been recently documented. Increasing records of micronutrient disorders in plantation eucalypts suggests that the capacity of micronutrients to limit productivity has not been adequately recognised in the past. Dramatic growth responses can occur with corrective fertilisation particularly where a micronutrient deficiency has been debilitating for growth. However, where deficiencies of elements have resulted in severe crown dieback and loss of form, {{it is very difficult}} to restart growth with good form.

40|$|Manures are an {{inevitable}} consequence of livestock in agriculture. They represent a valuable source of nutrients, including nitrogen (N), phosphorus and potassium. The industrial production of <b>fertilisers</b> <b>containing</b> these elements {{is associated with}} finite resources and this alone justifies a proper recycling of manures. The N fertiliser replacement value (NFRV) of manures is still insufficiently appreciated and exploited. Mineral fertiliser N supplementation is thus unnecessarily large, to the potential detriment of the environment. The present paper reviews methods to correctly assess the NFRV of manures and presents measures to increase the NFRV. When proper attention {{is given to the}} composition of manures and decisions on rates, timing and application methods are made accordingly, the relative NFRV of manures could rise from the present 20 - 50 percent to 80 percent. This could lead to a further reduction of mineral N fertiliser use, N surpluses and pollution. Under these conditions, 'manure', 'precision farming' and 'environment' should no longer be a contradiction in term...|$|R
