5|$|An {{increasingly}} common strategy to preserve bone and reduce treatment times includes {{the placement of}} a dental implant into a recent extraction site. On the one hand, it shortens treatment time and can improve aesthetics because the soft tissue envelope is preserved.

METHODS: Prospective recruitment of 1011 low-risk primigravidas with uterine and umbilical artery Doppler assessment at 22 - 24 weeks and 36 weeks. All mothers and infants were reviewed postnatally with a retrospective analysis of ultrasound and clinical outcome data. RESULTS: Elevated uterine artery indices were associated with increased <b>rates</b> <b>of</b> threatened miscarriage, <b>higher</b> <b>rates</b> <b>of</b> pre-eclampsia (PET) and a higher incidence of fetal birth weight 95 th centile for gestation was associated with statistically <b>higher</b> <b>rates</b> <b>of</b> small-for-gestational age (SGA) infants.
