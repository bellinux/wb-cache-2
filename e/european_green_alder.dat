40|$|About {{a hundred}} epigean insects (most {{of which are}} defoliators) have been studied in some Alnus viridis (Chaix) D. C. stands of {{south-eastern}} Alps. New biological data have been obtained for several species. A few insects feed exclusively on the <b>European</b> <b>green</b> <b>alder.</b> The faunistic affinities to the tundra are scarce. There are some connections with the dwarf shrub vegetation belt. Relationships between <b>European</b> <b>green</b> <b>alder</b> insects and other plants or host plant groups (i. e., other Alnus or Betula or Alnus-Betula or Alnus-Betula-Salix or Alnus-Betula-Salix- Rosaceae gen. pl.) have been considered. In general, the insect community observed on A. viridis shows biocoenotical characteristics of frost-hardly forests and seems to mantain a well-balanced structure in alder stands...|$|E
40|$|Forest {{regrowth}} is {{an ongoing}} process in the European Alps. In the Unteralptal, a valley in central Switzerland, landscape characteristics show considerable change toward the encroachment of <b>green</b> <b>alder</b> (Alnus viridis (Chaix) DC. = Alnus alnobetula (Ehrh.) K. Koch). Initially, <b>green</b> <b>alder</b> was described to grow on moist, north-facing and steep slopes of high geomorphic activity. However, the recent spreading of <b>green</b> <b>alder</b> described in several studies over the alpine arc questions the ecological habitat described in historic literature. Thus, a time series of aerial photographs and a digital elevation model (DEM) with a resolution of 2  m were used to find proxies for <b>green</b> <b>alder</b> encroachment. The cover of “new shrub areas” was analyzed based on relief parameter values and geomorphic landforms. The results show that <b>green</b> <b>alder</b> is spreading on more gentle slopes and well-drained areas, {{as well as on}} areas with lower geomorphic activity than anticipated. Thus, the habitat spectrum of <b>green</b> <b>alder</b> is much wider than assumed and encroachment has potentially greater consequences for landscape ecology than expected...|$|R
40|$|Shrub {{encroachment}} by <b>green</b> <b>alder</b> (Alnus viridis) {{has been}} an ongoing process in European mountain areas after land abandonment. The invasion of this N 2 -fixing and highly productive plant on former subalpine pastures and meadows changes the properties and interactions in the plant-soil system. In the national carbon inventory, {{it is assumed that}} <b>green</b> <b>alder</b> woodlands contain the same amount of SOC (~  69  t C ha −  1) as productive forests {{due to the lack of}} data. To explore the rarely studied change of the soil organic carbon (SOC) pools during the shrub establishment, the study used a chronosequence approach by testing pastures in a pre-encroached status and <b>green</b> <b>alder</b> stands with an age of 15, 25, 40 and 90  years, respectively. Besides the estimation of the SOC stock, the soil samples, taken in four different depth layers, were physically fractionated to characterize the quality of the SOC. While pasture grassland contained a median SOC stock (0 – 30  cm) of 100  t C ha −  1, the SOC stocks decreased to 81  t C ha −  1 for 40  years old shrub stands. The 90  years old <b>green</b> <b>alder</b> bushes showed the significantly highest C stock in the mineral soil with 174  t C ha −  1. <b>Green</b> <b>alder</b> encroachment led to an increase of the particulate organic material (POM) in the mineral soil resulting in a high concentration of unprotected carbon. By contrast, a stabilization of the SOC with the mineral soil phase was not visible during <b>green</b> <b>alder</b> establishment. The study concludes that <b>green</b> <b>alder</b> encroachment causes a significant increase of fresh and unprotected carbon in the soil system compared to subalpine pastures, resulting in a significantly higher total SOC stock (+  74  t C ha −  1) after 90  years and a doubling of the potential to leach dissolved organic carbon. At landscape level, the ingrowth and establishment of <b>green</b> <b>alder</b> on abandoned subalpine pastures can therefore influence the terrestrial and aquatic systems. Secondly, the SOC stocks of shrub forests are insufficiently represented in the current National Inventory Report...|$|R

40|$|We {{examined}} {{the feasibility of}} producing container Alnus crispa (Ait.)

Amans) Qu 9 l. in a commercial nursery setting. Alders are actinorhizal plants that fix atmospheric nitrogen in a symbiotic association with Frankia species and can also form mycorrhizal associations. Frankia inoculation significantly increased seedling biomass, number of nodule lobes, nodule weight, and plant nitrogen content of <b>green</b> <b>alder</b> {{at the end of}} nursery culture compared with control or 2 ̆ 01 cHebeloma only 2 ̆ 01 d treatments. Improved seedling growth, root nodulation, and nitrogen nutrition achieved in this study was attributable to Frankia inoculation, suggesting Frankia inoculation in nursery may be beneficial for the production of superior alder seedlings to use in reclamation work. Actinorhizal plants have the potential to enhance plant establishment on disturbed sites and to improve soil fertility and stability. Seedlings inoculated with Hebeloma only or in combination with Frankia did not show any visible ectomycorrhizal colonization, suggesting H. crustuliniforme may not be compatible with <b>green</b> <b>alder</b> under these experimental conditions.

40|$|Through their diet, herbivores inhabiting {{contaminated}} sites may be chronically {{exposed to}} a variety of aryl hydrocarbons (e. g., dioxins and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons [PAHs]). However, little is known about how differences in morphology and physiology among plant species alter the environmental accumulation of aryl hydrocarbons or their release and subsequent activity in the gastrointestinal tract of herbivores after ingestion. In the present study, the activity of aryl hydrocarbons during digestion was examined using six Arctic plant species growing in impacted and reference sites near Inuvik, Northwest Territories, Canada. The plant species studied were black spruce (Picea mariana), labrador tea (Ledum groenlandicum), bog birch (Betula glandulosa), <b>green</b> <b>alder</b> (Alnus crispa), water sedge (Carex aquatilis), and little-tree willow (Salix arbusculoides). Plants were digested using a simulator of the upper digestive tract, and aryl hydrocarbon release was evaluated using an aryl hydrocarbon-receptor assay. Bioaccessible aryl hydrocarbon activity varied among the plant species tested. The species with the greatest activity was <b>green</b> <b>alder,</b> and the species with the least activity was black spruce. Further investigation revealed that digested plant extracts may antagonize the aryl hydrocarbon receptor and prevent bioactivation of the aryl compound benzo[a]pyrene. Thus, PAH risk from the ingestion of vegetation varies among plant species and may depend on antagonists present in the vegetation...|$|R
