500|$|Because {{of their}} soft, {{gelatinous}} bodies, ctenophores are extremely rare as fossils, and fossils {{that have been}} interpreted as ctenophores have been found only in lagerstätten, places where the environment was exceptionally suited to preservation of soft tissue. Until the mid-1990s only two specimens good enough for analysis were known, both members of the crown group, from the early Devonian (<b>Emsian)</b> period. Three additional putative species were then found in the Burgess Shale and other Canadian rocks of similar age, about [...] in the mid-Cambrian period. All three apparently lacked tentacles but had between 24 and 80 comb rows, {{far more than the}} 8 typical of living species. They also appear to have had internal organ-like structures unlike anything found in living ctenophores. One of the fossil species first reported in 1996 had a large mouth, apparently surrounded by a folded edge that may have been muscular. Evidence from China a year later suggests that such ctenophores were widespread in the Cambrian, but perhaps very different from modern species – for example one fossil's comb-rows were mounted on prominent vanes. The Ediacaran Eoandromeda could putatively represent a comb jelly.|$|E
