40|$|PURPOSES: The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{investigate}} the disintegration mechanism of concrete due to the infiltration of the moisture to the milling overlay pavement and to come up with a method to minimize the disintegration as well as verifying the effectiveness of the edge sealing and Fogseal method. METHODS: This study investigated the distress mechanism due to the infiltrated moisture remaining in the milling overlay pavement through chloride freezing test and verified the effectiveness of the sealing of the milling edge and <b>fog</b> <b>seal</b> methods, which have been devised to minimize the moisture infiltration, through laboratory water permeability test. Additionally, long-term pavement performance was compared for the effectiveness of the proposed method through under loading test, and field water permeability test was carried out to verify the field applicability of the proposed method. RESULTS: The result of the research confirmed that chloride deteriorates the concrete surface through disintegration and lowers its strength and that the laboratory moisture infiltration test verified the effectiveness of the milling edge sealing and <b>fog</b> <b>seal</b> methods in the deterrence of moisture infiltration to the overlay pavement with excellent long-term performance of the pavement treated with the proposed method. Although the field water permeability test revealed some deterrence of moisture infiltration of the milling edge sealing and <b>fog</b> <b>seal</b> methods to a certain extent, the difference was a little. CONCLUSIONS: The milling edge sealing and <b>fog</b> <b>seal</b> methods are limited in their effectiveness for the cases of improvident compactio...|$|E
40|$|An open-graded {{friction}} course (OGFC) is a special-purpose {{surface layer}} of hot-mix asphalt (HMA) pavement {{that is increasingly}} being used around the world. Owing to its numerous benefits, OGFC is being regularly used as a final riding surface on interstate and high-traffic expressways by different highway agencies in the United States. However, some OGFC sections have experienced premature failure due to ravelling only after 6 - 8 years of service life. To maintain an effective, longer service life and enhanced performance of OGFC, preventive maintenance has been considered essential. There are several approaches to maintaining OGFC, {{one of which is}} the application of a <b>fog</b> <b>seal</b> and rejuvenator seal. A <b>fog</b> <b>seal</b> can reduce ravelling and extend the service life of OGFC while a rejuvenator seal can revitalise the existing aged asphalt binder in the top OGFC layer. This research focuses on optimising the fog and rejuvenator seal application rates by evaluating their effectiveness in terms of surface friction and durability. Three types of seal material were evaluated: Pavegaard (PG) and Pavepreserve (PP) asphalt rejuvenators and a cationic slow-setting asphalt emulsion (CSS- 1 H) as a <b>fog</b> <b>seal.</b> Improvement in abrasion resistance of OGFC pavement was observed on application of fog and rejuvenator seals but surface friction was reduced to some extent. Hamburg test clearly shows a trend that the medium application rate of 0. 10 gallon/square yard is better in enhancing resistance to rutting/moisture susceptibility of OGFC...|$|E
40|$|Chip seals {{are used}} {{extensively}} in the US for preventive maintenance. However, damage due to snow plows, wet and cold weather and extensive solar radiation contribute to poorer performance than at lower elevations. Therefore, an experimental program was begun to evaluate these and other factors affecting long term performance of chip <b>seals.</b> <b>Fog</b> <b>seals</b> are often placed on chip seals in the US immediately after chip sealing, but the benefits have not been well documented. Also, chip seals often do not adhere to reflective paint marking after sealing. This paper describes an experimental pavement constructed to evaluate {{the performance of a}} chip seal placed at the top of Poncha Pass, CO (elevation 9012 ft/ 2745 m) and also {{at the bottom of the}} pass (elevation 6825 ft/ 2081 m) to evaluate the benefits of <b>fog</b> <b>sealing</b> and removal of reflective paint markings prior to sealing [...] Twenty test sections were constructed in all to evaluate the performance of the seals with and without <b>fog</b> <b>sealing,</b> with and without paint removal, with controls.

40|$|The {{benefits}} of pavement preservation are only achieved if properly selected, designed, and applied. In some cases {{there is a}} lack of training when conducting one of these steps and the objective of applying pavement preservation techniques gets hampered. Literature on pavement preservation is extensive, but from a training point of view there is no structured approach on how to train people for selecting, designing, and applying pavement preservation techniques. The objective of the research is to develop a training learning management system that addresses pavement preservation treatments (chip <b>seals,</b> <b>fog</b> <b>seals,</b> slurry systems, and crack seals and fills) as they are dealt with during the phases of selection, design, and construction. This thesis will focus on training for chip <b>seals</b> and <b>fog</b> <b>seals.</b> Although Iowa was used as a case study, the findings can be applied in other locations. To begin the study, it was critical to identify the staff divisions to be trained and the treatments to be included. Through several meetings with the agency three staff divisions were identified. The staff divisions are: the maintenance staff (in charge of selection), design staff, and construction staff. Also, the treatments mentioned before were identified as the focus of the study due to their common use. Through means of needs analysis questionnaires and meetings the knowledge gap and needs of the agency were identified. The training presentations developed targets such gap and needs as the primary focus. The concepting (selection) training focuses on providing the tools necessary, such as life cycle cost analysis and asset management, to help make proper selections. The design trainings focus on providing the information necessary on the properties of the materials (mostly binders and aggregates) and how to make proper material selection. Finally, the construction trainings focus on providing equipment calibration procedure, inspection responsibilities, and visual images of poor and best practices. The research showed that it is important to train each division staff (maintenance, design, and construction) separately as each staff division has its own needs and interests. Also, it is preferred if each pavement preservation treatment is approached on its own. The research also determined that it is critical to create a structured plan aimed to develop a structured learning management system. It was also found that the results of this research are applicable in many locations across the nation, not just Iowa. Finally, it is recommended to research for the performance of pavement preservation treatments pre and post-training to compare their results and verify the effectiveness of the learning management system...|$|R
40|$|This {{research}} project strives {{to help the}} Iowa Department of Transportation (DOT) fully achieve the full benefits of pavement preservation through training on proper selection, design, and application of pavement preservation treatments. In some cases, {{there is a lack}} of training when conducting one of these steps and the objective of applying pavement preservation techniques is compromised. Extensive amounts of literature on pavement preservation exist, but a structured approach on how to train staff in selecting, designing, and applying pavement preservation techniques is lacking. The objective of this project was to develop a training-oriented learning management system to address pavement preservation treatments (chip <b>seals,</b> <b>fog</b> <b>seals,</b> slurry systems, and crack seals and fills) as they are dealt with during the phases of selection, design, and construction. Early in the project, it was critical to identify the staff divisions to be trained and the treatments to be included. Through several meetings with the Iowa DOT, three staff divisions were identified: maintenance staff (in charge of selection), design staff, and construction staff. In addition, the treatments listed above were identified as the focus of the study due to their common use. Through needs analysis questionnaires and meetings, the knowledge gap and training needs of the agency were identified. The training modules developed target the gap from the results of the needs analysis. The concepting (selection) training focuses on providing the tools necessary to help make proper treatment selection. The design training focuses on providing the information necessary on the treatment materials (mostly binders and aggregates) and how to make proper material selection. Finally, the construction training focuses on providing equipment calibration procedures, inspection responsibilities, and images of poor and best practices. The research showed that it is important to train each division staff (maintenance, design, and construction) separately, as each staff division has its own needs and interests. It was also preferred that each treatment was covered on an individual basis. As a result of the research, it is recommended to evaluate the performance of pavement preservation treatments pre- and post-training continuously to compare results and verify the effectiveness of the learning management system...|$|R
40|$|<b>Fog</b> <b>seal</b> {{is a type}} of {{treatment}} that uses a diluted asphalt emulsion to seal and protect an existing asphalt surface from a variety of distresses. <b>Fog</b> <b>seal</b> is sprayed on top of an asphalt pavement surface to improve and protect it from further cracking and raveling. Rejuvenator is also a type {{of treatment}} that penetrates into the asphalt pavement and restores its original viscoelastic properties. Similarly, like <b>fog</b> <b>seal,</b> rejuvenators can be sprayed on top of an asphalt pavement surface. The use of rejuvenators has grown rapidly in the past decade. However, {{little is known about the}} actual effectiveness of such treatments or possible drawbacks to their use. This study analyzes three of the most commonly used rejuvenators in the United States and determines the benefits and effects of each one. ^ In this study, the different rejuvenating fog seals were compared regarding improving surface friction, the overall condition of existing asphalt pavements, and the rheological and chemical properties of the binder. The rejuvenating fog seals were Polymer-Modified Rejuvenator (Rejuvenator A), Coal Tar Rejuvenator (Rejuvenator B), and Soybean Rejuvenator (Rejuvenator C). These treatments were applied to thirteen different roads in the southern part of the State of Indiana. Pavement Surface Evaluation and Rating (PASER) and Dynamic Friction Tester (DFT) were used for evaluation of the overall pavement condition and to measure the Coefficient of friction (CF) respectively. The rheological properties of the binders were measured using Dynamic Shear Rheometer (DSR) and the chemical properties (Carbonyl Concentration) of the binders were measured using Fourier Transform Infrared Spectroscopy (FTIR). The samples were then aged in Pressure Aging Vessel (PAV), and the same tests (DSR and FTIR) were conducted again to capture the rate of changes of the rheological and chemical properties. Before and after treatment data for all test methods were collected and analyzed for comparison. ^ The results from surface friction suggest that Rejuvenator C caused the least surface friction reduction compared to Rejuvenator A and Rejuvenator B while the results from the binder testing indicate that Rejuvenator A and Rejuvenator C provide greater benefit to the binder compared with Rejuvenator B. ...|$|E

40|$|The {{implementation}} of a pavement preservation program involves a learning curve with not only a determination to succeed, but also the courage to fail. Also, successful {{implementation of}} pavement preservation program requires knowledge {{of the performance of}} preservation surface treatments over time, which is critical to the select of candidate projects and the development of performance models for pavement management analysis. In addition, preservation surface treatments, such as chip seal, <b>fog</b> <b>seal,</b> microsurfacing, 4. 75 mm thin or ultra-thin overlay, can not only repair certain pavement surface defects, but also change the surface characteristics of pavement and therefore affect pavement surface friction performance. Nevertheless, such information is currently not available but is essential for the Indiana Department of Transportation (INDOT) {{to evaluate the effectiveness of}} pavement preservation surface treatments. As a concentrated effort, this study focused on the long-term friction performance of preservation surface treatments, particularly those have been widely used and those have seen increasing use by INDOT. Based on the selected field pavement test sections, this study aimed to evaluate the surface characteristics, particularly the long-term friction performance for those surface treatments that have been widely used and have seen increasing use by INDOT, including chip seal, fog-chip, <b>fog</b> <b>seal,</b> rejuvenating seal, microsurfacing, ultrathin bonded wearing course (UBWC), 4. 75 -mm hot mix asphalt (HMA) thin overlay, and profile milling (or diamond grinding). The test sections for each type of surface treatment covered a wide range of traffic volume from light to high. The service life for the selected test sections varied from 6 months to 60 months. Friction testing was mainly conducted using ASTM E 274 locked wheel trailer. Surface texture testing was conducted using either the ASTM E 2157 circular track meter (CTM) or a laser scanner. Pavement roughness and noise tests were also conducted to address the smoothness and noise issues, particularly on microsurfacing. Detailed analysis was provided to evaluate the friction performance of 4. 75 -mm HMA overlays. It is believed that the test results and findings drawn from this study not only provides timely information for INDOT to improve its pavement preservation program, but also provides the original information for the potential readers to better utilize preservation surface treatments...|$|E
40|$|As our nation’s {{highway system}} {{continues}} to age, asphalt maintenance and rehabilitation techniques {{have become increasingly}} important. The deterioration of pavement over time is inevitable. Preventive maintenance is a strategy to extend the serviceable life of a pavement by applying cost-effective treatments that slow the deterioration of pavement and extend its usable life. Thin maintenance surfaces (TMSs) are preventive maintenance techniques that can effectively prolong the life of pavement when applied at an opportune time. Common TMSs include bituminous <b>fog</b> <b>seal,</b> bituminous seal coat, slurry seal, cold in-place recycling (CIR), and micro-surfacing. This research project investigated ways to improve Iowa Statewide Urban Design and Specifications (SUDAS) and Iowa Department of Transportation (DOT) documents regarding asphalt roadway maintenance and rehabilitation. Researchers led an effort to review and help ensure that the documents supporting proper selection, design, and construction for asphalt maintenance and rehabilitation techniques reflect the latest research findings on these processes: seal coating, slurry sealing, micro-surfacing, and fog sealing.

40|$|The Indiana Department of Transportation (INDOT) conducts chip seal {{operations}} on state highways {{to prolong the}} life of the road. The chip seal operation is labor, equipment and material intensive. A typical chip seal operation may involve 35 or more INDOT employees including truck drivers, flagmen, and equipment operators (brooms, rollers, aggregate spreader, and distributors). This project was launched to better understand and document variations in how each of the six INDOT districts, approach the planning and execution of their respective chip seal operations. The goal was to identify areas in the operation where there were differences between districts and to determine best practices that could be shared among the districts. Two observers joined the chip seal operations in all six districts. The observers spent a total of 10 days with the chip seal crews (2 days each with the crews from Fort Wayne, La Porte, Greenfield, and Seymour and 1 day each with the crews from Vincennes and Crawfordsville). One additional day was spent in Crawfordsville observing the <b>Fog</b> <b>Seal</b> operation that takes place a few days following chip seal. During the initial phases of this project, many differences were observed regarding various aspects of the operation including the stone and equipment used, truck loading procedures, traffic control, and covering raised pavement markers (RPNs). These observations were shared with key stakeholders on November 4, 2013 and with a second group of stakeholders on January 22, 2014. With the help of stakeholders, best practices were identified from the observations and a list of 14 recommendations was created to be shared across all districts. A series of meetings were then scheduled to share the recommendations with each district and to determine which recommendations they were interested in piloting. The three ideas found during this project that provide the greatest opportunities for improving the overall operational efficiency of the chip seal operation are (1) the importance of closing roads during chip seal whenever possible, (2) the importance of choosing the best locations for stone stockpiles and oil tanker deliveries, and (3) the importance of fully loading dump trucks to their maximum safe and legal limit...|$|E
40|$|All roadway {{agencies}} {{monitor and}} maintain their infrastructure as it deteriorates over time. Agencies allocate {{the money that}} they have for maintenance, rehabilitation and reconstruction operations across their entire network. Regular and timely maintenance and rehabilitation treatments can postpone the need for reconstruction on a roadway. 	The need for infrastructure sustainability has been brought to the forefront of society and has become an important part of any public agency’s decision making processes. To achieve sustainable roadways social, economic and environmental benefits must be achieved while maintaining technically sound solutions. By considering the amount of energy that is consumed and the amount of greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions generated through various roadway treatments, sustainability can be brought into the decision making process. The objective of this research was to develop a probabilistic model that quantifies the amount of energy that is consumed and carbon dioxide equivalents (CO 2 e) generated for typical roadway construction, maintenance, rehabilitation and reconstruction projects in Saskatchewan and Alberta. 	The model constructed within this work was divided into three sub-models: 1) material production, 2) equipment usage and 3) material transport. For every variable that was required to be entered into each sub-model, a low, average or most likely and high value was determined. By using a range of input values the uncertainty of the values entered was incorporated and sensitive parameters were identified. 	A base case study of a one lane-kilometer (lane-km), 3, 700 m 2, section of rural roadway was analyzed. For the initial construction of a lane-km of traditional flexible pavement roadway it was determined that 1, 870 GJ (giga joules) of energy is required. Based on an annual average amount of energy used per home in Saskatchewan, 126 GJ/year, 1, 870 GJ would power approximately 15 homes for one year. Similarly it was determined that 152. 4 tonnes (t) CO 2 e are emitted {{for the construction of a}} lane-km of traditional flexible pavement roadway. Based on an average CO 2 e generation value of 5. 1 t per passenger vehicle per year the GHG emissions generated from the construction of a lane-km of roadway is equivalent to the GHG emissions released by approximately 30 passenger vehicles over one year. It was also determined that the volume of CO 2 e generated for initial construction compared to the volume of material in the roadway was a ratio of 30 to 1. 	The base case study also reviewed various maintenance, rehabilitation and reconstruction treatments for the amount of energy consumed and GHG emissions generated for one lane-km. From the modeled values it was found that the order of energy consumed and CO 2 e generated from least to greatest for maintenance treatments is: <b>fog</b> <b>seal,</b> slurry seal, micro surfacing, single, double and triple chip seal and ultra thin overlay. For rehabilitation and reconstruction treatments the order of energy consumed and CO 2 e generation from least to greatest is: cold in-place recycling, mill and fill, full depth reclamation, remove and replace with recycled materials and remove and replace with virgin materials. 	Through a sensitivity analysis of the input parameters, it was observed that for maintenance treatments the sensitive parameters were the equipment efficiency (EFE) value, the placement rate of the treatment, the aggregate application rate and the amount of asphalt binder included in the treatment. For rehabilitation and reconstruction treatments, the two most sensitive parameters were the asphalt concrete plant energy and the application rate of the Portland cement. 	Further investigation into how each sub-model contributed to the overall amount of energy consumed and CO 2 e generated found the production of materials contributed the greatest to the overall values. When examining the production of each layer in a traditional flexible pavement roadway structure, the asphalt layers contributed the greatest to the energy consumed at 72. 1 percent of all materials produced. The asphalt layers also contributed the greatest to the GHG emissions generated from the production of materials at 42. 7 percent. Further breaking down the production of the asphalt layers, the energy requirements at the hot mix asphalt concrete plant account for 75. 9 percent of the energy consumed and 52. 0 percent of the CO 2 e generated for the production of the materials of the asphalt layers. 	The cost of each treatment was reviewed based on the cost of diesel at $ 1. 21 /litre and the amount of energy consumed. The costs of energy for the maintenance treatments ranged from $ 174 /lane-km for <b>fog</b> <b>seal</b> to $ 5, 488 /lane-km of the ultra thin overlay. The cold in-place recycling and mill and fill rehabilitation treatments had energy costs of $ 13, 545 and $ 21, 440 /lane-km respectively. The costs of the energy consumed for the reconstruction treatments ranged from $ 21, 710 /lane-km for full depth reclamation and $ 71, 164 /lane-km for remove and replace with virgin materials. Based on a review of the City of Saskatoon’s 2012 proposed treatment plan for its roadway network the cost of energy was estimated at $ 1, 232, 000 for work on 93 lane-km of roadway. 	The costs of GHG emissions were also determined based on the amount of CO 2 e generated and the value of one tonne of carbon on the voluntary carbon credit market at $ 6 /tonne. The costs of carbon for the maintenance treatments ranged from $ 3 /lane-km for <b>fog</b> <b>seal</b> to $ 64 /lane-km for the ultra thin overlay. For the rehabilitation treatments the cost of carbon for the cold in-place recycling was $ 224 /lane-km and $ 266 /lane-km for the mill and fill treatment. The reconstruction treatments ranged from $ 524 /lane-km for full depth reclamation and $ 1, 062 for remove and replace with virgin materials. 	Finally four field case studies were reviewed to determine the amount of energy consumed and GHG emissions generated through construction. The first was the reconstruction of Range Road 232, a rural roadway with virgin materials. The second was the reconstruction of Kenderdine Road with recycled materials. The energy consumed and GHG emissions generated for these construction projects are 1, 917 and 1, 146 GJ/lane-km, and 150. 3 and 92. 6 t CO 2 e/lane-km, respectively. The third case study further reviewed the use of warm mix asphalt concrete (WMAC) and the use of recycled asphalt pavement (RAP) in the Kenderdine Road pavement structure. This research determined that with the incorporation of WMAC and 10 percent RAP in the asphalt layers and with the use of recycled materials in the base layers the amount of energy consumed would be reduced by 31. 8 percent and the GHG emissions reduced by 34. 8 percent compared to a traditional virgin pavement structure. The final case study reviewed the City of Saskatoon’s 2012 proposed roadway restoration and reconstruction plan. From the model it was found that 38, 281 GJ of energy was consumed and 2, 617 t CO 2 e was generated. 	This work shows that the probabilistic model developed in this research may be applied to a variety of roadway treatments from maintenance to reconstruction in urban and rural applications. With the use of the model, roadway project managers can make informed decisions for roadway treatments based on energy consumption and GHG emission generation values. By incorporating the amount of energy that is consumed and GHG emissions generated into the decision making process of roadway infrastructure management, more sustainable infrastructure management can be achieved...|$|E
