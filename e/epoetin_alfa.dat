40|$|Background: Erythropoiesis {{stimulating}} agents (ESAs) {{are widely}} used to treat anaemia but concerns exist about their potential to promote pathological angiogenesis in some clinical scenarios. In the current study we have assessed the angiogenic potential of three ESAs; <b>epoetin</b> delta, darbepoetin <b>alfa</b> and <b>epoetin</b> beta using in vitro and in vivo models. Methodology/Principal Findings: The epoetins induced angiogenesis in human microvascular endothelial cells at high doses, although darbepoetin alfa was pro-angiogenic at low-doses (1 – 20 IU/ml). ESA-induced angiogenesis was VEGFmediated. In a mouse model of ischaemia-induced retinopathy, all ESAs induced generation of reticulocytes but only epoetin beta exacerbated pathological (pre-retinal) neovascularisation in comparison to controls (p, 0. 05). Only epoetin delta induced a significant revascularisation response which enhanced normality of the vasculature (p, 0. 05). This was associated with mobilisation of haematopoietic stem cells and their localisation to the retinal vasculature. Darbepoetin alfa also {{increased the number of}} active microglia in the ischaemic retina relative to other ESAs (p, 0. 05). Darbepoetin alfa induced retinal TNFa and VEGF mRNA expression which were up to 4 fold higher than with epoetin delta (p, 0. 001).

50|$|Nutritional iron {{deficiency}} {{is common in}} developing nations. An estimated two-thirds of children and of {{women of childbearing age}} in most developing nations are estimated to suffer from irondeficiency; one-third of them have the more severe form of the disorder, anemia. Iron deficiency from nutritional causes is rare in men and postmenopausal women. The diagnosis of {{iron deficiency}} mandates a search for potential sources of loss, such as gastrointestinal bleeding from ulcers or colon cancer. Mild to moderate iron-deficiency anemia is treated by oral iron supplementation with ferrous sulfate, ferrous fumarate, or ferrous gluconate. When taking iron supplements, stomach upset or darkening of the feces are commonly experienced. The stomach upset can be alleviated by taking the iron with food; however, this decreases the amount of iron absorbed. Vitamin C aids in the body's ability to absorb iron, so taking oral iron supplements with orange juice is of benefit. In anemias of chronic disease, associated with chemotherapy, or associated with renal disease, some clinicians prescribe recombinant erythropoietin or <b>epoetin</b> <b>alfa,</b> to stimulate RBC production, although since there is also concurrent iron deficiency and inflammation present, parenteral iron is advised to be taken concurrently.|$|E
40|$|AbstractRecombinant human {{erythropoietin}} (rHuEPO, <b>epoetin</b> <b>alfa)</b> is a 165 -amino acid glycoprotein {{that has}} been shown to initiate response to hypoxia and is most widely known for its efficacy in the treatment of a variety of anemias. A series of experiments were conducted using rodent models to investigate the ability of systemically administered <b>epoetin</b> <b>alfa</b> to cross the blood-brain barrier (BBB) and affect the outcome of hypoxia and injury in the central nervous system. Results demonstrated that endogenous erythropoietin (EPO) and EPO receptors are expressed around animal brain capillaries and that systemically administered <b>epoetin</b> <b>alfa</b> crossed the BBB. The <b>epoetin</b> <b>alfa</b> group experienced significantly reduced (P < 0. 01) tissue damage in an ischemic stroke model when the study drug was administered 24 h before inducing stroke compared with control animals. Significant protective effects of <b>epoetin</b> <b>alfa</b> persisted when <b>epoetin</b> <b>alfa</b> was administered up to 6 h poststroke (P < 0. 05). Similarly, <b>epoetin</b> <b>alfa</b> reduced trauma-related brain injury when administered 24 h prior to and up to 6 h after blunt trauma when compared with the control group. The volume of tissue necrosis was significantly greater in control animals compared with those that received <b>epoetin</b> <b>alfa</b> (P < 0. 05). In addition, these studies led to the postulate that <b>epoetin</b> <b>alfa</b> may also have an effect on nervous system inflammation. This was confirmed using an experimental auto-immune encephalomyelitis model, where rats were shown to have significantly delayed onset (P < 0. 01) and reduced severity (P < 0. 05) of symptoms after treatment with <b>epoetin</b> <b>alfa.</b> Other studies demonstrated that <b>epoetin</b> <b>alfa</b> had an effect on the latency and severity of seizures and significantly increased (P < 0. 0002) survival versus controls when mice were exposed to the neurotoxin kainate (used to induce seizures). These findings suggest future potential therapeutic uses for <b>epoetin</b> <b>alfa</b> beyond its anemia-related effects...|$|E
30|$|Although {{not well}} established, an {{association}} between <b>epoetin</b> <b>alfa,</b> a human recombinant erythropoietin, and anterior uveitis has been reported previously in the literature, with 13 patients across three medical centers developing anterior uveitis after receiving <b>epoetin</b> <b>alfa</b> during hemodialysis [2].

40|$|Erythropoietin and its {{receptor}} {{function as}} primary mediators {{of the normal}} physiological response to hypoxia. Erythropoietin is recognized for its central role in erythropoiesis, but studies in which recombin-ant human erythropoietin (<b>epoetin</b> <b>alfa)</b> is injected directly into ischaemic rodent brain show that ery-thropoietin also mediates neuroprotection. Abundant expression of the erythropoietin receptor has been observed at brain capillaries, which could provide a route for circulating erythropoietin to enter the brain. In confirmation of this hypothesis, systemic adminis-tration of <b>epoetin</b> <b>alfa</b> before or up to 6 h after focal brain ischaemia reduced injury by 50 – 75 %. <b>Epoetin</b> <b>alfa</b> also limited the extent of concussive brain injury, the immune damage in experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis and excitotoxicity induced by kai-nate. Thus, systemically administered <b>epoetin</b> <b>alfa</b> in animal models has neuroprotective effects, demon-strating its potential use after brain injury, trauma and multiple sclerosis. It is evident that erythropoietin has biological activities in addition to increasing red cell mass. Given the excellent safety profile of <b>epoetin</b> <b>alfa,</b> clinical trials evaluating systemically administered <b>epoetin</b> <b>alfa</b> as a general neuroprotective treatment are warranted...|$|E

40|$|Background. <b>Epoetin</b> <b>alfa,</b> {{administered}} at standard dosages of 10, 000 - 20, 000 IU {{three times}} weekly or 40, 00060, 000 IU once weekly, {{has been shown}} to significantly increase hemoglobin (Hb) levels, decrease transfusion requirements, and improve quality-of-life parameters in patients undergoing chemotherapy. Objective. This open-label, nonrandomized, historically controlled study was conducted to evaluate the efficacy and safety of an induction dose of <b>epoetin</b> <b>alfa</b> in patients with moderate or severe anemia who were receiving chemotherapy. Methods. Nineteen patients with solid tumors and Hb levels < 9. 0 g/dl were enrolled. The patients received single s. c. injections of <b>epoetin</b> <b>alfa,</b> 40, 000 IU, on study days 1, 4, 7, 10, and 13, and were then observed for the following 30 days. Nineteen other cancer patients who had matching characteristics and had received <b>epoetin</b> <b>alfa,</b> 10, 000 IU, three times weekly for the 45 -day study period, served as historical controls. The primary efficacy variable was change in Hb level from baseline to days 15 (similar toweek 2) and 45 (similar toweek 6. 5). Secondary efficacy variables included the percent response (Hb increase A g/dl) and percent major response (Hb increase 2 : 2 g/dl) at days 15 and 45, the durations of response and major response after day 45, the proportion of patients transfused within the 45 study days, the changes in Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status score at days 15 and 45, and the ability to maintain the planned chemotherapy dose (dose intensity) over the 45 -day study. Results. Mean increases in IIb level in the <b>epoetin</b> <b>alfa</b> 40, 000 IU group were significantly greater than those in the historical control group both at day 15 and at day 45. The increase in Hb level in the control group approximated increases reported with standard 3 -times-weekly <b>epoetin</b> <b>alfa</b> at day 15 but was somewhat lower than the increases typically seen by day 45, presumably due to the fact that, in the present study, the <b>epoetin</b> <b>alfa</b> dose was not doubled in initial nonresponders, as is commonly done with standard <b>epoetin</b> <b>alfa</b> treatment. The rates of major response for <b>epoetin</b> <b>alfa</b> 40, 000 IU patients (37 % at day 15 and 84 % at day 45) were higher than those for control patients (16 % and 21 %, respectively). Also, the transfusion rate was lower and performance status scores were better in the <b>epoetin</b> <b>alfa</b> 40, 000 IU patients than in the control patients. In all, 74 % of <b>epoetin</b> <b>alfa</b> 40, 000 IU patients versus 47 % of control patients received 100 % of the planned chemotherapy dose. <b>Epoetin</b> <b>alfa</b> was well tolerated in both treatment groups. Conclusions. Results {{of this study suggest that}} <b>epoetin</b> <b>alfa</b> at a dose of 40, 000 IU administered five times over 2 weeks may confer even higher response rates than those seen with standard dosing regimens.
