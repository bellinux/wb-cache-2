40|$|AbstractThis work aims at {{monitoring}} {{diesel engine}} {{fuel injection system}} by analyzing the cylinder head variations. It focuses on dual-peak phenomenon in combustion stage signal of cylinder head vibration under certain work condition. The first peak of dual-peak is the vibratory response signal of fuel <b>injector</b> <b>needle</b> valve crash which is proved by the time domain analysis between cylinder head vibration and in-cylinder combustion pressure, analysis for cylinder head vibration of misfire and analysis of fuel feeding law change following engine rotational speed. The start time of the fuel <b>injector</b> <b>needle</b> valve crash vibratory response signal can describe the fuel <b>injector</b> <b>needle</b> valve closing timing. The acceleration peak of fuel <b>injector</b> <b>needle</b> valve crash vibratory response signal can describe crash strength. From the results under different work conditions and faulty conditions it is revealed that these characteristics can accurately describe injection information {{and can be used}} for fuel injection system fault diagnosis...|$|R

40|$|Aim: The aim of {{our study}} was to {{investigate}} the diagnostic value of fine needle aspiration biopsy in malignant lesions, compare the results obtained by a Chiba and an injection needle and determine whether or not malignant cells are implanted on the course of the needle. Material and Methods: Fine needle aspiration biopsy was done on the resected material from a total of 70 patients (67 male and 3 female) {{with a mean age of}} 58. 17 years (range: 38 - 75 years) who underwent surgery for prediagnosed malignancy. For each surgically resected material, the cytological and histopathological findings of the internal aspirates from both the Chiba and <b>injector</b> <b>needles</b> as well as the smears from the external surfaces of these needles were compared. Results: Of the 70 biopsy materials obtained by the Chiba needle, malignancy was demonstrated in 58, benign lesions in one, while 11 were non-diagnostic. The results obtained with the <b>injector</b> <b>needle</b> revealed 58 malignancies, and 12, without any diagnosis. With both techniques, no false positive results were&nbsp;observed. The diagnostic sensitivity of the techniques was 84 % and 82 % for the Chiba and <b>injector</b> <b>needles</b> respectively. Examination of the smears obtained from the external surfaces revealed malignant cells in 45 (64. 3 %) of the 70 smears obtained with a Chiba needle and 42 (60 %) of the 70 smears obtained with an <b>injector</b> <b>needle.</b> Conclusions: Fine needle aspiration is a method with high diagnostic value. It can be easily performed in selected cases with malignant pulmonary lesions. There were no significant differences between the two methods in terms of diagnostic yield. Any intervention targeting the tumor tissue, especially in advanced stage cellular and malignant tumors, carries a significant risk for implantation of malignant tumor cells on the course of the needle...|$|R

40|$|Modeling of fuel {{injection}} equipment is a tool that is used increasingly for explaining or predicting the effect of advanced diesel injection strategies on combustion and emissions. This paper reports on the modeling of the high-pressure part of a research type Heavy Duty Common Rail (CR) {{fuel injection}} system. More specifically, it reports on the observed dynamics of the injection system and the capability of the model to capture this. For that reason, the total high-pressure part of the injection system, i. e. the fuel pump, rail and injector, has been modeled using the AMESim code (Imagine S. A., 2004). The reliability of the resulting hydraulic model is tested through a comparison between numerical results and actual injection measurements. This detailed comparison is based on measurements of injected mass flow rate, needle lift and pressure oscillations in the injection duct {{for a series of}} single injection events. It is shown that the hydraulic model is able to accurately simulate the injection rate, needle lift and injection pressure for different rail pressure levels. For accurate numerical results, it is vital that the stiffness of the <b>injector</b> <b>needle</b> assembly and the discharge coefficients of the different flow restrictions in the injector (e. g. nozzle holes) are correctly modeled. Assuming a rigid <b>injector</b> <b>needle</b> results in a too early start of injection. Discharge coefficient values found in literature shows a wide spread. This makes it very difficult to simulate the injected mass flow rate accurately on the basis of literature data.

40|$|Recently, the {{high-pressure}} {{fuel injection}} performance of common-rail direct injection (CRDi) engines {{has become more}} important, due {{to the need to}} improve the multi-injection strategy. A multiple injection strategy provides better emission and fuel economy characteristics than a normal single injection scheme. The CRDi engine performance changes with the type of high-pressure electro-mechanical injector that is used and its injection response in a multi-injection scheme. In this study, a direct needle-driven piezo injector (DPI) was investigated, to optimize its actuation components, including the plate length, number of springs, and the elasticity of the spring between the <b>injector</b> <b>needle</b> and the piezo stack. Three prototype DPIs were proposed by this research. They were classified as Type 1, 2, and 3, depending on whether the <b>injector</b> <b>needle</b> was hydraulic or mechanical.

The sensor consisted of a laser light emitter, a receiver, and a device used for modulating {{the intensity of the}} light reaching the receiver in function of position of the moving element. Thus, two rectangular windows were mounted on the injector body, while a third window was rigidly connected to the needle control piston, and aligned with the fixed ones, to obtain a clearance area which varied linearly with needle position. An optical fibre cable was used to transfer the laser light from the source to one of the fixed window, while a similar cable was connected between the second window and the receiver. Hence, the intensity of the light reaching the receiver was proportional to the position of the <b>injector</b> <b>needle.</b> Light intensity was converted into an equivalent voltage, and this signal was fed to the data acquisition system. The <b>injector</b> <b>needle</b> lift curves were measured and compared with those obtained with a commercial eddy current sensor.

A pilot shot can either be absent or present before the rate-shaped boot injection. The experimental tests have been performed on a partial PCCI Euro 5 diesel engine endowed with direct-acting piezoelectric injectors. Starting from optimized triple pilot-main-after injection strategies, boot injection was implemented by maintaining the direct-acting piezo <b>injector</b> <b>needle</b> open at part lift. The results of two steady state working conditions have been presented in terms of engine-out emissions, combustion noise and brake specific fuel consumption. In addition, in-cylinder analyses of the pressure, heat-release rate, temperature and emissions have been evaluated. Considering the in-cylinder pressure traces and the heat release rate curves, the injection rate shaping proved to influence combustion {{in the absence of}} a pilot injection to a great extent. A pilot shot, added before the boot injection, determined a mitigation of the influence of rate shaping. A simultaneous reduction in NOx and soot can be achieved for small quantities of fuel injected during boot injection, compared to the optimized triple injection strategies. However, a trade-off exists between emissions and combustion noise when boot injection is applied. On the other hand, the variations in bsfc were only minor. The advantages of the application of boot injection are greater for low to medium loads than for medium to high loads.

40|$|A general {{conservative}} {{numerical model}} for simulation of transmission-line unsteady fluid-dynamics {{has been developed}} and applied to high-pressure injection systems. A comprehensive thermodynamic approach for modeling acoustic cavitation, i. e. cavitation induced by wave propagation, was proposed {{on the basis of}} a homogeneous barotropic mixture model of a pure liquid in equilibrium with its vapor and a gas, both dissolved and undissolved. For the pure liquid flow simulation outside the cavitation regions, or in the absence of these, temperature variations due to compressibility effects were taken into account, for the first time in injection system simulation, through a thermodynamic state equation which was derived from energy considerations. Nevertheless, in the cavitation regions, an isothermal flow was retained which is consistent with negligible thermal effects due to vaporization because of the tiny amounts of liquid involved. A novel implicit, conservative, one step, symmetrical and trapezoidal scheme of the second-order accuracy was applied to solve the hyperbolic partial differential equations governing the pipe flows. It can also be enhanced at a high-resolution level. The numerical model was applied to wave propagation and cavitation simulation in a high-pressure injection system of the pump-line-nozzle type for light and medium duty vehicles. The system was of relevance to the model assessment because it presented severely cavitating flow conditions. The predicted pressure time histories at two pipe locations and <b>injector</b> <b>needle</b> lift were compared to experimental results, substantiating the validity and robustness of the developed conservative model in simulating cavitation inception and desinence with great degree of accuracy. Cavitation transients and the flow discontinuities induced by them were numerically analyzed and discusse...|$|R
40|$|Simultaneous laser-induced {{previous}} termincandescence (LII) and laser-induced scattering (LIS) {{were applied}} to investigate soot formation and distribution in a single cylinder rapid compression machine. The fuel used was a low sulfur reference diesel fuel with 0. 04 % volume 2 -ethylhexyl nitrate. LII images were acquired at time intervals of 1 CA throughout the soot formation period, {{for a range of}} injection pressures up to 160 MPa, and in-cylinder pressures (ICP) up to 9 MPa. The data collected shows that although cycle-to-cycle variations in soot production were observed, the LII signal intensities converged to a constant value when sufficient cycles were averaged. The amount of soot produced was not significantly affected by changes in in-cylinder pressure. Soot was observed distributed in definite clusters, which were linked to slugs of fuel caused by oscillations in the <b>injector</b> <b>needle.</b> The highest injection pressure exhibited lower soot productions and more homogeneous soot distributions within the flame. Despite diffusion flames lasting longer with lower injection pressure, it appeared that the extended oxidation time was insufficient to oxidize the excess production of soot. In addition, soot particles were detected closer to the nozzle tip with higher injection pressures. The recording of LII sequences at high temporal resolutions has shown that three distinct phases in soot formation can be observed. First, high soot formation rates are observed before the establishment of the diffusion flame. Second, a reduced soot formation rate is apparent from the start of diffusion flame until the end of injection. Finally, high soot oxidation rates occur after the end of injection and {{for the duration of the}} flame...|$|R

40|$|Demographic {{characteristics}} of participants In 2007, {{one hundred and}} nineteen participants were interviewed in south-east Queensland for the IDRS. Roughly three-quarters of the sample were male, more than three-quarters were unemployed, less than one-fifth had a grade 12 education, 56 % of participants reported a prison history, and close to one-third reported current drug treatment. In 2007, approximately onequarter of the sample identified as Indigenous.
