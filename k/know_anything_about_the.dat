25|$|Lula da Silva claimed on Brazilian public {{television}} {{that he did}} not <b>know</b> <b>anything</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> scandals. He also said that people who did not agree with paying a tax for each check issued and/or financial transaction were people who illegally failed to pay their income tax.|$|E
25|$|Trinny and Susannah Undress... {{starts with}} Woodall and Constantine {{becoming}} {{acquainted with the}} couple who are experiencing difficulties in their relationship and due to receive a makeover. Trinny and Susannah do not <b>know</b> <b>anything</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> couple's situation and problems so they talk with them to establish what is lacking in their relationship and {{to see how it}} has changed from previous years. Woodall and Constantine then evaluate their clothing and ask the couple to put on an outfit in which they feel most confident.|$|E
60|$|Accordingly Ronald, at supper, put the question, {{but none}} of the {{officers}} admitted they <b>knew</b> <b>anything</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> matter.|$|R
60|$|But nobody <b>knew</b> <b>anything</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> matter {{excepting}} George Mason himself, {{and he was}} {{not there}} to give the village any information.|$|R
60|$|Nevertheless all who <b>knew</b> <b>anything</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> Neefits {{said that}} they were very respectable people, and had done very well in the world.|$|R
25|$|Another {{interesting}} {{feature is}} that the carbonaria had noticeably darkened after about a century. This was seen quite clearly when specimens collected about 1880 were compared with specimens collected more recently: clearly the dark morph has been adjusted by the strong selection acting on the gene complex. This might happen if a more extreme allele was available at the same locus; or genes at other loci might act as modifiers. We do not, of course, <b>know</b> <b>anything</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> genetics of the original melanics from the nineteenth century.|$|E
25|$|A {{weighted}} matroid is a matroid {{together with}} a function from its elements to the nonnegative real numbers. The weight of a subset of elements is defined to be {{the sum of the}} weights of the elements in the subset. The greedy algorithm can be used to find a maximum-weight basis of the matroid, by starting from the empty set and repeatedly adding one element at a time, at each step choosing a maximum-weight element among the elements whose addition would preserve the independence of the augmented set. This algorithm does not need to <b>know</b> <b>anything</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> details of the matroid's definition, as long as it has access to the matroid through an independence oracle, a subroutine for testing whether a set is independent.|$|E
25|$|The {{next day}} the Czech {{authorities}} issued an international arrest warrant for Dahlgren, who, as was later revealed, had already passed through the passport control at Vienna International Airport before his name appeared in the international database. Subsequently, at around 1PM the Austrian authorities alerted the crew of Austrian Airlines flight OS93 of the arrest warrant. The flight, carrying Dahlgren, had left Vienna at 10:46AM and was at time flying over the United Kingdom. After contemplating an emergency landing or a return to Vienna, the pilots {{decided it would be}} safer to continue the flight. The cabin crew were instructed to pretend not to <b>know</b> <b>anything</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> suspect on the flight. Immediately after landing at Washington Dulles International Airport, the plane was stormed by U.S Customs and Border Protection Officers, who arrested Dahlgren and turned him over to the FBI.|$|E

500|$|Dorival Caymmi {{died at age}} 94 {{of kidney}} cancer and {{multiple}} organ failure on August 16, 2008, {{at his home in}} Copacabana, Rio de Janeiro. His granddaughter, Stella, who wrote a biography about him in 2001, said, [...] "He did not know that he had cancer, and {{he did not want to}} know. He did not ask much about this. He was first hospitalized in 1999. My grandfather went through with treatment, but he did not want to <b>know</b> <b>anything</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> illness. He acted with serenity every day, and because of that, we respected this wish." ...|$|E
500|$|... but {{to allow}} the player to come as close as {{possible}} to experiencing the critical parts of the film for themselves. Levels were designed with this goal in mind, with just enough plot to give context to the player's actions. Liberties were thus taken with the plot, and critics noted there was little footage which could spoil the film for those who had not seen it. GameSpot's Greg Kasavin said [...] "if you didn't <b>know</b> <b>anything</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> story of The Return of the King, then the story of the game may be hard to follow, though you'll still get the gist of it." [...] However, he also advised, [...] "in case you don't want any aspect of the movie spoiled for you, it'd be wise to hold off on playing The Return of the King until after you've seen the movie." ...|$|E
500|$|Author Brandon Friedman, also {{a combat}} veteran of Iraq and Afghanistan, shared a similar view at VetVoice: [...] "The Hurt Locker is a high-tension, well-made, action movie that will {{certainly}} keep most viewers {{on the edges}} of their seats. But if you <b>know</b> <b>anything</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> Army, or about operations or life in Iraq, you'll be so distracted by the nonsensical sequences and plot twists that it will ruin the movie for you. It certainly did for me." [...] Friedman criticized the inaccuracy of the film's representation of combat, saying [...] "in real life, EOD techs don't conduct dangerous missions as autonomous three-man teams without communications gear ... Another thing you'll rarely hear in combat is an EOD E-7 suggesting to two or three of his guys that they leave the scene of an explosion in an Iraqi city by saying: 'C'mon, let's split up. We can cover more ground that way.|$|E
6000|$|... "Humph!" [...] murmured Dave, {{and there}} the talk came to an end. But Dave was not satisfied. He still {{wondered}} if Link Merwell <b>knew</b> <b>anything</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> taking of the horses.|$|R

500|$|Their final ritual {{took place}} in the Mojave Desert in late February 1946, during which Parsons {{abruptly}} decided that his undertaking was complete. On returning to the Parsonage he discovered that a woman named Marjorie Cameron—an unemployed illustrator and former Navy WAVE—had come to visit. Believing her to be the [...] "elemental" [...] woman and manifestation of Babalon that he had invoked, in early March Parsons began performing sex magic rituals with Cameron, who acted as his [...] "Scarlet Woman", while Hubbard continued to participate as the amanuensis. Unlike the rest of the household, Cameron knew nothing at first of Parsons' magical intentions: [...] "I didn't <b>know</b> <b>anything</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> O.T.O., I didn't know that they had invoked me, I didn't know anything, but the whole house knew it. Everybody was watching {{to see what was going}} on." [...] Despite this ignorance and her skepticism about Parsons' magic, Cameron reported her sighting of a UFO to Parsons, who secretly recorded the sighting as a materialization of Babalon.|$|E
500|$|It {{is later}} {{revealed}} that the Titans were created when Ymir Fritz found the [...] "source of all organic life" [...] and became the Founding Titan where she {{had the ability to}} create and control the Titans. When Ymir Fritz died as a side effect of having the Titan ability for 13 years, her soul was split into the 9 Titans where their abilities can be inherited by anyone once the previous wielder is dead. These Titans consist of the Founding Titan, the Attack Titan, the Colossus Titan, the Armored Titan, the Female Titan, the Beast Titan, the Jaw Titan, the Cart Titan, and the War Hammer Titan. The 145th King that wielded the Founding Titan's power fled to the island of Paradis where he used the countless Colossus Titans to make the walls and erased the memories of the Eldians he brought with him so that they didn't <b>know</b> <b>anything</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> outside world.|$|E
500|$|In October 2017, former New York Times {{reporter}} Sharon Waxman {{wrote on}} TheWrap that, {{when she looked}} into the allegations of sexual misconduct by Harvey Weinstein in 2004, Russell Crowe and Damon made direct phone calls to her to vouch for the head of Miramax Italy, Fabrizio Lombardo, whom she suspected of having [...] "no film experience" [...] and whose [...] "real job was {{to take care of}} Weinstein’s women needs" [...] in Europe. Damon responded in an interview with Deadline, [...] "For the record, I would never, ever, ever try to kill a story like that... It’s not something I would do, for anybody". He said that he had known Lombardo [...] "in a professional capacity" [...] while working on The Talented Mr. Ripley, so he called the reporter and relayed his experience with Lombardo at Weinstein's request. [...] "That was the extent of it....I’m sure I mentioned to her that I didn’t <b>know</b> <b>anything</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> rest of her piece, because I didn’t." [...] Waxman has since endorsed Damon’s statement on Twitter.|$|E
60|$|Clowes {{thought so}} too, but {{admitted}} {{that he did not}} see of what use the suspicion was going to be. Whether Rand-Brown <b>knew</b> <b>anything</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> affair or not, it was quite certain that the bat was not with him.|$|R

But all they knew about Ireland was that Dublin was on the Liffey. So I wondered if they'd ever heard of General Gordon." ...|$|R
2500|$|Osama El-Baz, {{an adviser}} to Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak, said, [...] "This pilot can't <b>know</b> <b>anything</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> plane; the chances that he has any {{information}} [...] are very slim." [...] EgyptAir officials also immediately dismissed Taha's claim. American investigators confirmed key aspects of Taha's information, but decided not to anger the Egyptian government further by issuing any official statement about Al-Batouti's motive. EgyptAir terminated Taha's employment, and his application for British asylum was reportedly declined, though he gave an extensive 2002 newspaper interview in London, and a 2005 documentary credited him as [...] "Exiled Captain".|$|E
2500|$|Questioned {{about the}} image and his campaign's {{connections}} to Hamsher, Lamont responded, [...] "I don't <b>know</b> <b>anything</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> blogs. I'm not responsible for those. I have no comment on them," [...] but a spokesman for Lamont was quoted in The Washington Post as calling the image [...] "offensive and inappropriate." [...] Hamsher removed the image after receiving a request from the Lamont campaign, later posting a statement on Firedoglake [...] "apologiz to anyone who was genuinely offended by the choice of images," [...] and criticizing Lieberman for using the controversy about the image to score political points.|$|E
2500|$|Some {{individual}} Cherokee and Freedmen {{have not}} {{been aware of the}} issue. Dr. Circe Sturm, professor, wrote in her book Blood Politics that many Freedmen descendants had little sense of the historic connection with the Cherokee and are ambivalent about getting recognized. Cherokee members have also been ignorant of the historic issues. Cara Cowan Watts, a tribal council member who opposed membership for Freedmen descendants, said in 2007 that she didn't <b>know</b> <b>anything</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> Freedmen or their history before the court case. Chief Smith said, [...] "A lot of Cherokee don't know who the Freedmen are," [...] and that he was not familiar with them when growing up.|$|E
6000|$|... "But {{none of you}} fellows <b>knew</b> <b>anything</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> business," [...] said Harry. [...] "Kate and I got up the company, and we needn't {{have had}} a Board of Directors at all, if we hadn't wanted to. If any of you boys had <b>known</b> <b>anything</b> <b>about</b> {{telegraphs}} we would have given you an office." ...|$|R
6000|$|There {{was great}} confusion, {{for all the}} ladies talked at once; and it so {{happened}} {{that none of them}} <b>knew</b> <b>anything</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> monkey, therefore they all agreed that Nelly was a foolish child, and had made a fuss about nothing. She cried dismally, and kept saying to her mother,-- ...|$|R
60|$|Marilla went to {{her room}} at {{intervals}} all through the evening and searched for the brooch, without finding it. A bedtime visit to the east gable produced no result. Anne persisted in denying that she <b>knew</b> <b>anything</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> brooch but Marilla was only the more firmly convinced that she did.|$|R
2500|$|Kenny G became {{embroiled in}} {{controversy}} when he posted Twitter images {{of his visit}} {{to the site of the}} 2014 Hong Kong protests, which the PRC government has declared illegal, saying [...] "I wish everyone a peaceful and positive conclusion to this situation". The feed provoked an immediate angry reaction from the Chinese foreign ministry. G issued a clarification: [...] "I don't really <b>know</b> <b>anything</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> situation and my impromptu visit to the site was just part of an innocent walk around Hong Kong ... I only wanted to share my wish for peace for Hong Kong and for all of China as I feel close to and care about China very much." ...|$|E
2500|$|It {{was during}} this time that Wittgenstein began {{addressing}} what he {{considered to be a}} central issue in Notes on Logic, a general decision procedure for determining the truth value of logical propositions which would stem from a single primitive proposition. He became convinced during this time that “ll the propositions of logic are generalizations of tautologies and all generalizations of tautologies are generalizations of logic. There are no other logical propositions.” [...] Based on this, Wittgenstein argued that propositions of logic express their truth or falsehood in the sign itself, and one need not <b>know</b> <b>anything</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> constituent parts of the proposition to determine it true or false. Rather, one simply need identify the statement as a tautology (true), a contradiction (false), or neither.|$|E
2500|$|An {{unauthorized}} remix of the [...] "Candlelight Mix" [...] {{was made}} by KISS FM in Bakersfield, California to commemorate {{the first anniversary of}} the September 11 attacks. This remix features a five-year-old, kindergarten-aged girl talking about her father who presumably died in the attacks, with the original chorus intermittently playing. Although the monologue is based on a real event, the little girl's vocal was actually the daughter of a former KISS FM program director and she did not <b>know</b> <b>anything</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> terrorist attacks at the time. The director wrote and read simple sentences for her and had her repeat them for him, with a little emotional prompting; the director later edited his voice out of the track. This was one of the most requested songs in the station's history, and had all of the local market talking. It even crossed over to Clear Channel's other stations for a wider audience.|$|E
6000|$|... "I don't know," [...] she said, {{shaking her}} head thoughtfully. [...] "Ozma will see him 'bout it, of course, and then she'll punish him. But how, I don't know, 'cause no one ever has been punished in Oz since I <b>knew</b> <b>anything</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> place. Too bad, Shaggy Man, isn't it?" ...|$|R
2500|$|According to the {{obituary}} in The Independent: [...] "If <b>the</b> world now <b>knows</b> <b>anything</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> dark, secretive {{world of the}} Sicilian Mafia in the first turbulent years after the Second World War, it is largely thanks to Danilo Dolci." [...] The man who in his youth studied architecture became an architect of social change.|$|R
60|$|Well, {{he waited}} till the morning, and quite early {{the old woman}} {{appeared}} {{and took out a}} little pipe and blew in it, and in a moment all the crows in the world were flying about her.
