5000|$|Biographers theorise that Christie used an {{incident}} in the real-life of American film star Gene Tierney {{as the basis of}} the plot of The Mirror Crack'd from Side to Side. In June 1943, while pregnant with her first daughter, Tierney contracted German measles during her only appearance at the Hollywood Canteen. Due to Tierney's illness, her daughter was born deaf, partially blind with cataracts, and severely developmentally disabled. Sometime after the tragedy surrounding her daughter's birth, the actress learned from a fan who approached her for an autograph at a tennis party that the woman (who was then a member of the women's branch of the Marine Corps) had sneaked out of quarantine while sick with German measles to meet Tierney at her only Hollywood Canteen appearance.

At times sweetly awkward, at others composed and serene, the actress appears to respond effortlessly and intuitively to the camera, creating a rich sense of what Lucy is about that often is not explicit in the dialogue."

30|$|One of {{the most}} {{interesting}} aspects for teachers is to identify the different strategies students have used for problem solving. In our current study, this has been performed manually, using the video coding scheme and analysis. The outcome of these efforts reveal the identification of several patterns which are as follows: (P 1) active users: Several students were exploring the scene and trying out the touchscreen before starting the video; (P 2) passive users: The students were not interested in touching the screen but <b>just</b> <b>stared</b> <b>at</b> it as a static video; (P 3) single user pattern: One member of the group reads and answers the questions; (P 4) multi-roles pattern: Some members of the group read the questions, another one approved the answer, while other members read the questions by themselves. We have also noticed that in the single user pattern (P 3), students knew each other’s knowledge, thus trusting their skills and knowledge to answer specific questions related to previous experiences. This led to having one leader in the group (probable the one with the best level of knowledge), even though the scenario targets multi-disciplinary nursing specialists, that were reading and answering the questions with less discussions. At the end, this group had several wrong answers to the questions. The video analysis also provided us with some interesting information about the students and their knowledge. Analyzing the discussion, they had while answering the questions, could help their teacher understand why they answered a question wrong. The ACCURACY/CORRECTNESS, RELEVENCE, and TIMELINESS code events (see Additional file 1 : Appendix A) were used several times and allowed the researchers to understand the rationale behind the wrong answer. The latest could be used for future developments, if required, to send students personalized feedback and help them understand the subject better.|$|R

A theorem due to Wiman states that the maximum order of an automor-phism of a curve is 4 g + 2.

I noticed that the representations of Aut(C) for the Wiman curves of type I had all distinct characters (<b>just</b> <b>stare</b> <b>at</b> the usual basis of differentials for a hyperelliptic curve). So I decided to try the calculation in genus 3 first to gain practice using the formula, since in genus 3 the calculation would be fairly small.

For any g ≥ 3 for which p: = 2 g + 1 is prime, let Cg be the Wiman curve of type I in genus g. Then the representation of Aut(Cg) on H 0 (Cg,K) is isomorphic to the following representation...|$|R
