25|$|Having faked her own death, Gavin's wife, Kathy Sullivan (Gillian Taylforth), makes {{plans to}} escape Gavin and asks Phil Mitchell (Steve McFadden) for money on several occasions, saying she {{is willing to}} go to prison so she can {{eventually}} reunite with her family in Walford. Kathy and Phil arrange to meet at St Pancras International, but she cannot meet him because her son, Ian Beale (Adam Woodyatt), is there. As she leaves, Gavin surprises her, revealing he <b>knows</b> <b>what</b> <b>she</b> has planned. After Kathy makes attempts to contact someone at The Queen Victoria pub, Gavin arrives on Albert Square. He texts Phil, pretending to be Kathy, and meets him, revealing that after St Pancras, he and Kathy planned to fly themselves to Spain but Kathy escaped by crashing the car. Phil discovers that Kathy is staying in a guest house in Kent, but Gavin follows Phil there and finds Kathy first. Phil realises they have gone to a local airfield, so he stops them from leaving and convinces Kathy to go back with him, leaving Gavin behind. When Phil meets Kathy at her hotel room, she agrees with him {{that there should be no}} more contact between them. After Phil leaves, it is revealed that Gavin has manipulated her into saying this. Phil goes missing after Gavin and two men confront him at his garage. After Kathy's sons, Ian and Ben Mitchell (Harry Reid), discover she is alive, Gavin finds Kathy in Walford. He tells Kathy to stick to their plan and Phil will stay alive. When Kathy reunites with Ben, Kathy says that she needs all of Phil's money or Gavin will kill him, and Gavin later tells Kathy he will harm Ian and Ben if she does not get the money that night. Kathy decides to go to the police to confess to fraud and to report Phil's kidnapping. When Ian finds out, he calls Gavin, saying he knows what Gavin has done, but Gavin now knows that Kathy has not stuck to their plan. Kathy realises Gavin probably has Phil at his sister's house, but when they get there, Gavin and Phil are gone, but Phil's blood is found. Phil, a recovering alcoholic, gets back home but is covered in cuts and bruises and has broken bones, and reveals to Ben that Gavin deliberately got him drinking alcohol again.|$|E

In contrast, Polish music manager Maja Sablewska stated that Margaret has a [...] "beautiful" [...] timbre and interprets her lyrics indicating that she <b>knows</b> <b>what</b> <b>she</b> is singing about. In the single [...] "Cool Me Down", Margaret's vocal range covers around one-and-a-half octaves from G4 to C6.

[...] In an interview on This Morning, Rihanna said that the song is not necessarily about a specific personal experience, but rather the general feelings of mental anguish, anxiety and confusion. Rihanna further explained {{that she wanted to}} record the song because she felt that listeners would be able to relate to the subject matter. When Good Girl Gone Bad was repackaged, Rihanna approached L.A. Reid, boss of Def Jam, suggesting to release [...] "Disturbia" [...] as a single and follow-up to [...] "Take a Bow".

Heather Phares of AllMusic selected the song {{as one of}} Night Time, My Times stronger tracks, as did Digital Spy's Lewis Corner; the latter elaborated that it [...] "continues the premise that [...] has finally emerged as an artist who <b>knows</b> <b>what</b> <b>she</b> wants". Bryant Kitching from Consequence of Sound deemed it a musical highlight from the album. Comparing the song's guitar-led opening to [...] "Johnny Marr on a sugar rush", he also called it the album's [...] "most rewarding moment". Writing for magazine Spin, Marc Hogan echoed praise for the song—he described it as [...] "impressively catchy and emotionally communicative" [...] and also said it was [...] "the type of track that might inspire a label to green-light—finally—her debut album". musicOMH's Nina Bertok highlighted the song's mixture of genres and catchiness, and also praised the [...] "killer" [...] chorus.

She played Riana Braganza, a carefree young woman, and was particularly drawn to the qualities of her character: [...] "Riana <b>knows</b> <b>what</b> <b>she</b> is doing.

[...] She next appeared in Agent Vinod, an espionage thriller directed by Sriram Raghavan. Kapoor was enthusiastic about the project, but it met with a tepid response and she was described as miscast.

500|$|Soon, Shakira {{began work}} on her next studio album, titled She Wolf, which was, among other places, {{recorded}} at the Compass Point Studios in the Bahamas. In an interview with Rolling Stone, Shakira said that specifically chose the studio after she learned that it had previously been used for recording sessions by artists like Bob Marley, The Cure, and AC/DC, of whom she is a fan. Unlike most of her previous projects, which are predominantly composed of Latin and pop rock styles, She Wolf is an electropop album with world music influences. When asked why the album had electronic influences, Shakira responded, [...] "I felt very curious and intrigued about the electro-pop world and everything it has to offer. I {{wanted to make sure}} that this album was very bassy and that the kicks hit really hard, and I wanted to concentrate on the beat. But my music, to a certain extent, is very complex– because I always try to experiment with sounds from other parts of the world." [...] Explaining the meaning behind the title, Shakira said that [...] "'She Wolf' is the woman of our time. The woman who <b>knows</b> <b>what</b> <b>she</b> wants and is free of prejudice and preconceived notions. She defends her deepest desires with teeth and claws like a wild animal".|$|E

I remember how I used to feel watching TV and seeing Sara Rue on Popular because she was an inspiration to me. It's funny because what I love about Lauren is that she's unapologetic and she's confident and she's making Puck work for it and she's not just looking for a roll in the hay. I think that they are very sweet together, there is this vulnerability when they are both such bad asses and you put them together and I think there is something really special there. What I appreciate about Lauren is that she's like I don't need to give it to you, you're going to work for it, and I think that's a great message to send to young girls. I think that he is smitten and she is probably a little smitten too but I think she has enough self esteem not to give everything up for the charming cute boy that's kind of after her." [...] Kevin Fallon, a writer for The Atlantic, reacted favorably to the casting of Fink: [...] "Glee hit the trifecta this year with its three major cast additions. First there were Darren Criss—who's exploded with popularity—and Chord Overstreet. Now there's Ashley Fink's Lauren. And while the tough-only-on-the-outside Lauren can deliciously out-sass Santana Lopez, it's her straight-talking that really has me sold." ...|$|E

500|$|Although Warner Brothers studio {{had assumed}} that the many costumed films that studios like MGM had earlier {{produced}} would never succeed {{during the years of}} the Great Depression, they nonetheless took a chance by producing Captain Blood in 1935. The film is a swashbuckler action drama based on the popular novel by Rafael Sabatini and directed by Michael Curtiz. It would star a then unknown extra, Errol Flynn, alongside the little-known de Havilland. According to film historian Tony Thomas, both actors had [...] "classic good looks, cultured speaking voices, and a sense of distant aristocracy about them". Filmed between August 5 and October 29, 1935, Captain Blood gave deHavilland the opportunity to appear in her first costumed historical romance and adventure epic, a genre to which she was well suited, given her beauty and elegance. In the film, she played Arabella Bishop, the niece of a Jamaica plantation owner, who purchases at auction an Irish physician wrongly condemned to servitude. The on-screen chemistry between deHavilland and Flynn was evident from their first scenes together, where clashes between her character's spirited hauteur and his character's playful braggadocio did not mask their mutual attraction to each other. Arabella is a feisty young woman who <b>knows</b> <b>what</b> <b>she</b> wants and is willing to fight for it. The bantering tone of their exchanges in the filmthe healthy give-and-take and mutual respectbecame the basis for their on-screen relationship in subsequent films. Captain Blood was released on December 28, 1935, and received good reviews and wide public appeal. DeHavilland's performance was singled out in The New York Times and Variety. The film was nominated for four Academy Awards, including Best Picture. The popular success of the film, as well as the critical response to the on-screen couple, led to seven additional collaborations.|$|E
500|$|A pun, the character's name [...] "Kim Possible" [...] {{alludes to}} the word [...] "impossible". Kim is {{referred}} to by several nicknames by various characters throughout the series, including K.P. (Ron); Kimmy Cub (James); K, Miss Perfect, Tin Teeth (Bonnie); Princess, Pumpkin, Cupcake, Miss Snooty, Miss Priss (Shego); and Kimmie by miscellaneous. Unlike traditional superheroes and secret agents, Kim lacks a secret identity; the character is known simply as [...] "Kim Possible, and everyone who knows her <b>knows</b> <b>what</b> <b>she</b> does." [...] Kadeen Griffiths of Bustle observed that Kim [...] "never put on spandex or acquired a secret identity; instead, {{she had her own}} website where people could book her for jobs with a tagline that promised that she could do anything", a claim reinforced by {{the fact that she is}} capable of fighting crime while continuing to perform well in high school and remaining captain of her school's cheerleading squad. Writing for Women Write About Comics, Jamie Kingston observed that Middleton High School [...] "ignores her as a heroine unless something happens on school grounds where she has to do her thing." [...] Thus, Kim rarely receives attention for her work from her family and peers, although her customers remain grateful. However, while describing Kim as a [...] "power fantasy", Stealing Commas believes that Kim is simply [...] "preventing regime change" [...] and [...] "Preserving the status quo rather than doing any real world saving." [...] According to Metacritic, Kim [...] "is stubborn, strong-willed, and has a fuse shorter than a grenade with a three second delay" [...] but remains [...] "extremely humble, refusing to take credit for her truly amazing actions." [...] Meanwhile, David Horiuchi of Amazon.com wrote that the character is [...] "tough, witty, and refreshingly free of any saucy teen attitude." ...|$|E
500|$|Lorna Bradbury of The Daily Telegraph {{called the}} novel [...] "a psychologically convincing {{picture of a}} man who, even in his many flirtatious moments, is teetering on the edge, and a {{brilliant}} account of the poet’s nervous breakdown." [...] Similarly, Joanna Briscoe of The Guardian said, [...] "by the final quarter, Dawson <b>knows</b> <b>what</b> <b>she</b> is doing with a tricky subject, and the novel comes into its own with explosive force. It is a daring experiment, and one whose mood, setting and eccentricities linger in the mind." [...] Helen Dunmore of The Times called the narrative of the novel [...] "strong, satisfying and memorable". The Daily Mail called the novel [...] "an exceptional book even from the prize-winning Dawson; clever, moving, sexy and with a mesmerising feel for that magical, optimistic, but doomed time just before the Great War." [...] Vanessa Curtis of The Scotsman admired the novel for its much more satisfying portrayal of Brooke than his biographies and called it [...] "a seductive book, evocative and well paced, the tale split between Brooke and Nell, the two narrative voices strong, distinctive and consistent." [...] Alice Ryan called the novel [...] "a gripping and beautifully written book which deals {{not only with the}} history of Brooke and his alleged love child, but also with the wider history of the Fens, its places, people and traditions". The Oxford Times critic Phillipa Logan too gave praise to the novel, saying that Dawson [...] "exploits [...] ambiguities [...] to the full, creating a compelling, thoroughly plausible narrative that explores Brooke’s time as a student in Cambridge." [...] Simon Akam of The New Statesman liked the novel, noting that [...] "in her novel Dawson has [...] pulled off the risky gamble of reimagining history." [...] The New Zealand Listener said, [...] "The Great Lover is proof that its author is one of the finest practitioners of the literary historical novel and that this is her best novel yet." ...|$|E

500|$|The Matrix {{commented that}} after they {{presented}} songs to Spears, she tailored them to suit herself, especially the lyrics. Christy said, [...] "... she really <b>knows</b> <b>what</b> <b>she</b> wants. She knows if she's trying something on that doesn't fit right for her. She's like, 'No, that's not me.' She's {{not one to}} strap {{on some sort of}} fake image." [...] Christy also claimed to be impressed with Spears's vocal ability during the recording of [...] "Shadow". Steve Anderson, Lisa Greene and Stephen Lee wrote [...] "Breathe on Me" [...] at Metrophonic Studios in London, England. Before meeting with the other writers, Anderson thought of two concepts for songs specifically for Spears: one he had worked on [...] "for ages", and [...] "Breathe on Me", which he drafted {{on the morning of the}} sessions. Greene and Lee did not like the first concept, and they wrote [...] "Breathe on Me" [...] with Anderson. The song was produced by Mark Taylor, who kept most of the programming done by Anderson. With Taylor, Spears recorded [...] "Breathe on Me" [...] and [...] "And Then We Kiss", which did not make the album. Before the album was released, Spears's manager Larry Rudolph commented that it was important for Spears to continue moving away from a traditional pop sound, citing [...] "I'm a Slave 4 U" [...] and [...] "Boys" [...] from Britney as departures from her previous music. Barry Weiss, then-president of Jive Label Group, added, [...] "She has achieved what she set out to achieve, which was to make a mature album that didn't sound like something she would have done three years while still making a commercial album that has hit singles. [...] It's the kind of record she should be doing right now, and it came down to her to make it." [...] In the Zone was recorded at Battery Studios and The Dojo in New York City, 3:20 Studios, Decoy Studios, Pacifique Studios, Record Plant in Los Angeles, California, Westlake Recording Studios in West Hollywood, California, The Chocolate Factory, in Chicago, Illinois, Triangle Sound Studios in Atlanta, Georgia, Metrophonic Studios and Olympic Studios in London, England, and Murlyn Studios in Stockholm, Sweden. Throughout the beginning of 2003, Spears started testing tracks by playing them in nightclubs such as Show in New York City.|$|E
500|$|Belle has {{garnered}} widespread acclaim from film critics, {{several of}} whom voiced their {{preference for the}} character over her predecessor, Ariel from The Little Mermaid. Hal Hinson of The Washington Post described Belle as a [...] "compelling" [...] character who is [...] "more mature, more womanly and less blandly asexual" [...] than Ariel, as well as [...] "a more worldly girl", describing her as [...] "a bookworm, with gumption and a mind of her own." [...] Similarly comparing Belle to Ariel, John Hartl of The Seattle Times wrote that, in Beauty and the Beast, [...] "there's rarely a sense of deja vu, perhaps because the heroine is so different from 'Mermaid's' dependent Ariel, and her dilemma is more poignant," [...] while Boxoffice scribed, [...] "Undoubtedly in response to criticism that the cute little 'Mermaid' Ariel {{was nothing more than}} a precocious sexpot, the idea-people behind this beauty—aptly named Belle ... chose to make her an icon of self-reliance and a voracious reader with a curiosity and love for everything around her." [...] Jennie Punter of The Globe and Mail extolled Belle as a [...] "smart, courageous ... 'take-charge kind of gal'," [...] while crowning her the [...] "main attraction of Beauty and the Beast." [...] Emma Cochrane of Empire hailed Belle as [...] "a feminist heroine who [...] more rounded than previous Disney characters", while Paste's Annlee Ellingson similarly enjoyed the character's [...] "feminist kick." [...] Stephen Hunter of The Baltimore Sun wrote that [...] "Belle ... is no passive fairy tale princess, but a real live girl, with a spunky personality and her own private agenda." [...] TV Guide wrote that [...] "The familiar narrative is strengthened by the independent, self-assured character of Belle," [...] concluding, [...] "Unlike Disney heroines from Snow White through Ariel, Belle is smart, <b>knows</b> <b>what</b> <b>she</b> wants, and doesn't spend her time pining away for the love of a handsome prince." [...] Marc Bernardin of Entertainment Weekly praised Belle's heroism, dubbing her [...] "the hero" [...] of Beauty and the Beast, while Entertainment Weekly's Christian Blauvelt opined, [...] "Unlike previous Disney heroines who needed to be rescued by a prince themselves, Belle not only saves the Beast's life, she saves his soul." [...] TLC's Vicki Arkoff received Belle as a [...] "smart" [...] and [...] "sharp-tongued" [...] heroine, crediting the character for [...] "break Disney's passive-princess mold." [...] About.com's David Nusair described Belle as an [...] "admirable" [...] heroine. AllMovie's Don Kaye and Perry Seibert echoed each other's reviews of the character, with Kaye describing both Belle and the Beast as [...] "three-dimensional ... complex individuals who defy stereotyping and change over the course of the story," [...] and Seibert calling Belle a [...] "strong female character" [...] who [...] "sidesteps most of the clichés surrounding Disney heroines."
