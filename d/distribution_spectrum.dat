Their development varied across different geographic territories. In the USA, for example, DMSs typically grew by takingOutage Management Systems to the next level, automating the complete sequences and providing an end to end, integrated view of the entire <b>distribution</b> <b>spectrum.</b> In the UK, by contrast, the much denser and more meshed network topologies, combined with stronger Health & Safety regulation, had led to early centralisation of high-voltage switching operations, initially using paper records and schematic diagrams printed onto large wallboards which were 'dressed' with magnetic symbols to show the current running states. There, DMSs grew initially from SCADA systems as these were expanded to allow these centralised control and safety management procedures to be managed electronically. These DMSs required even more detailed component/connectivity models and schematics than those needed by early OMSs as every possible isolation and earthing point on the networks had to be included. In territories such as the UK, therefore, the network component/connectivity models were usually developed in the DMS first, whereas in the USA these were generally built in the GIS.|$|E

30|$|Another {{compromise}} {{adopted to}} address this problem was suggested by Iguchi et al. (2008; hereafter IG 08). Their approach was based on dynamical downscaling of realistic aerosol fields from large-scale aerosol (and chemical) transport model simulations to small-scale CRM simulations. The basic numerical framework of aerosol downscaling was similar to that of dynamical downscaling for standard prognostic variables such as wind velocity, temperature, and vapor-mixing ratio. Initial and time-variant aerosol boundary conditions were prepared using four-dimensional output from the large-scale simulation. However, aerosol size <b>distribution</b> <b>spectra</b> were incompletely resolved in the large-scale aerosol transport model. This deficiency might be problematic for accurate calculation of the activated CCN number concentration on the basis of Köhler theory on the CRM side. To deal with this problem in a reasonable manner, the authors proposed the use of an additional intermediate module. The intermediate aerosol loading module complemented the information of the aerosol size <b>distribution</b> <b>spectra</b> in the dynamical downscaling framework. The aerosol size <b>distribution</b> <b>spectra</b> and their total number/mass concentrations should be as realistic as possible, such as those observed at times and locations pertaining to the simulations.|$|R

The interpolated bulk number concentrations are converted into aerosol size distribution spectra at each grid point. The conversion employs different built-in size distribution functions, according to aerosol type.

Validation of the models remains a crucial step {{in order to get}} reliable prediction. However, pertinent data for the validation step are lacking. When catchment {{solute transport}} models are applied to shallow groundwater catchments, catchment-scale model validation relies on the validation of the groundwater solute transport model. Here we studied the interests of two approaches for groundwater solute transport model validation: the use of (i) gaseous atmospheric tracers and (ii) of spectral properties of transit time distributions derived from tracer concentration time series of rainfall and stream base-flow. The Kervidy-Naizin catchment, a 5 km 2 catchment in Western France was chosen as case application. Three simulations with a shallow groundwater transport model were performed using three sets of effective porosity, respectively. We then investigated the ability of four gaseous tracers (CFC- 11, CFC- 12, CFC- 113 and SF 6) and transit time distribution spectra to identify the most realistic simulations. The three simulations led to mean transit times that varied over a wide range of values, from 1. 2 to 12. 1 yr. Simulated groundwater mixing ratio differences for the three simulations did not exceed 5 % for CFC- 11, regardless of the groundwater location. The values of the SF 6, CFC- 12 and CFC- 113 mixing ratio differences between the two simulations that contained the two shortest mean transit times were within expected measurement error of the tracer concentrations, regardless of the groundwater location. In contrast, the mixing ratio differences between the two simulations with the shortest mean transit times and the simulation containing the largest one exceeded 28 % at all groundwater locations for SF 6 and 9 % in groundwater discharging into the stream for CFC- 12 and CFC- 113. The spectra of the three simulated transit time distributions do not match the transit time <b>distribution</b> <b>spectrum</b> derived from chloride concentration time series. So these results show that transit time <b>distribution</b> <b>spectrum,</b> and in much less extend SF 6, CFC- 12 and CFC- 113 mixing ratios are sensitive enough to effective porosity values to be used as validation variables in shallow groundwater transport modelling. Transit time <b>distribution</b> <b>spectrum</b> constitutes an integrative variable able to discriminate between shallow groundwater transport simulations leading to very close mean transit times. In the present work, the discrepancy between the simulated spectra and the spectrum derived from the chloride concentration may come from other catchment processes than groundwater transport process, or from a wrong modelling of the groundwater transport process. Globally, deriving reliable transit time <b>distribution</b> <b>spectrum</b> requires high-frequency and extensive time series of a conservative tracer measured in stream water and rainfall, which is not straightforward to collect. The low sensitivity of simulated CFC- 11 tracer mixing ratios to simulated groundwater transit times, and thus to model parameters, constituted a shortcoming {{to use it as a}} validation variable of groundwater solute transport models...|$|E
