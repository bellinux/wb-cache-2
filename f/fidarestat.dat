5000|$|Epalrestat is a {{carboxylic}} acid derivative and a noncompetitive and reversible aldose reductase inhibitor {{used for the}} treatment of diabetic neuropathy, {{which is one of the}} most common long-term complications in patients with diabetes mellitus. It reduces the accumulation of intracellular sorbitol which is believed to be the cause of diabetic neuropathy, retinopathy and nephropathy [...] It is well tolerated, with the most commonly reported adverse effects being gastrointestinal issues such as nausea and vomiting, as well as increases in certain liver enzymes.Chemically, epalrestat is unusual in that it is a drug that contains a rhodanine group.Aldose reductase is the key enzyme in the polyol pathway whose enhanced activity is the basis of diabetic neuropathy. Aldose reductase inhibitors (ARI) target this enzyme. Out of the many ARIs developed, ranirestat and <b>fidarestat</b> are in the trial stage. Others have been discarded due to unacceptable adverse effects or weak efficacy. Epalrestat is the only ARI commercially available. It is easily absorbed into the neural tissue and inhibits the enzyme with minimum side effects.|$|E

Female Wistar rats were pre-treated with either vehicle (N-methyl-D-elucamine) or <b>fidarestat,</b> 32 mg kg(- 1) d(- 1) for both, in the right jugular vein, for 3 consecutive days. A group of vehicle- and fidarestat-treated rats were subjected to 45 -min retinal ischemia followed by 24 -h reperfusion. Ischemia was induced 30 min after the last vehicle or <b>fidarestat</b> administration. Retinal IR resulted in a remarkable increase in retinal cell death. The number of TUNEL-positive nuclei increased 48 -fold in the IR group compared with non-ischemic controls (p< 0. 01), and this increase was partially prevented by <b>fidarestat.</b> AR expression (Western blot analysis) increased by 19 % in the IR group (p< 0. 05), and this increase was prevented by <b>fidarestat.</b> Sorbitol dehydrogenase and nitrated protein expressions were similar among all experimental groups. Retinal sorbitol concentrations tended to increase in the ER group but the difference with non-ischemic controls did not achieve statistical significance (p= 0. 08). Retinal fructose concentrations were 2. 2 -fold greater in the IR group than in the non-ischemic controls (p< 0. 05). <b>Fidarestat</b> pre-treatment of rats subjected to IR reduced retinal sorbitol concentration to the levels in non-ischemic controls. Retinal fructose concentrations were reduced by 41 % in fidarestat-pre-treated IR group vs. untreated ischemic controls (p= 0. 0517), but remained 30 % {{higher than in the}} non-ischemic control group. In conclusion, IR injury to rat retina is associated with a dramatic increase in cell death. elevated AR expression and sorbitol pathway intermediate accumulation. These changes were prevented or alleviated by the AR inhibitor <b>fidarestat.</b> The results identify AR as an important therapeutic target for diseases involving IR injury, and provide the rationale for development of <b>fidarestat</b> and other AR inhibitors...|$|E

Comparison with the hALR 2 -fidarestat complex and the porcine aldehyde reductase (ALR 1) -fidarestat complex {{indicates that the}} hydrogen bond between the Leu 300 amino group of the wild-type and the exocyclic amide group of the inhibitor is the key determinant for the specificity of <b>fidarestat</b> for ALR 2 over ALR 1.

We have investigated how AR inhibitor <b>fidarestat</b> protects high glucose- (HG-) induced cell viability changes by increasing the expression of Nrf 2 and its dependent phase II antioxidant enzymes. <b>Fidarestat</b> pretreatment prevents HG (25 [*]mM) -induced Thp 1 monocyte viability. Further, treatment of Thp 1 monocytes with <b>fidarestat</b> caused a time-dependent increase in the expression {{as well as the}} DNA-binding activity of Nrf 2.

40|$|International audienceStructure {{determination}} of porcine aldehyde reductase holoenzyme in complex with the potent aldose reductase inhibitor <b>fidarestat</b> {{was carried out}} to explain {{the difference in the}} potency of the inhibitor for aldose and aldehyde reductases. The hydrogen bonds between the active-site residues Tyr 50, His 113, and Trp 114 and <b>fidarestat</b> are conserved in the two enzymes. In aldose reductase, Leu 300 forms a hydrogen bond through its main-chain nitrogen atom with the exocyclic amide group of the inhibitor, which when replaced with a Pro in aldehyde reductase, cannot form a hydrogen bond, thus causing a loss in binding energy. Furthermore, in aldehyde reductase, the side chain of Trp 220 occupies a disordered split conformation that is not observed in aldose reductase.

40|$|Abstract Background Childhood {{hospitalization}} {{related to}} asthma remains at historically high levels, and its incidence {{is on the}} rise world-wide. Previously, we have demonstrated that aldose reductase (AR), a regulatory enzyme of polyol pathway, is a major mediator of allergen-induced asthma pathogenesis in mouse models. Here, using AR null (AR -/-) mice we have investigated the effect of AR deficiency on the pathogenesis of ragweed pollen extract (RWE) -induced allergic asthma in mice and also examined the efficacy of enteral administration of highly specific AR inhibitor, <b>fidarestat.</b> Methods The wild type (WT) and AR -/- mice were sensitized and challenged with RWE to induce allergic asthma. AR inhibitor, <b>fidarestat</b> was administered orally. Airway hyper-responsiveness was measured in unrestrained animals using whole body plethysmography. Mucin levels and Th 2 cytokine in broncho-alveolar lavage (BAL) were determined using mouse anti-Muc 5 A/C ELISA kit and multiplex cytokine array, respectively. Eosinophils infiltration and goblet cells were assessed by H&E and periodic acid Schiff (PAS) -staining of formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded lung sections. T regulatory cells were assessed in spleen derived CD 4 + CD 25 + T cells population. Results Deficiency of AR in mice led to significantly decreased PENH, a marker of airway hyper-responsiveness, metaplasia of airway epithelial cells and mucus hyper-secretion following RWE-challenge. This was accompanied by a dramatic decrease in infiltration of eosinophils into sub-epithelium of lung as well as in BAL and release of Th 2 cytokines in response to RWE-challenge of AR -/- mice. Further, enteral administration of <b>fidarestat</b> significantly prevented eosinophils infiltration, airway hyper-responsiveness and also markedly increased population of T regulatory (CD 4 + CD 25 + FoxP 3 +) cells as compared to RWE-sensitized and challenged mice not treated with <b>fidarestat.</b> Conclusion Our results using AR -/- mice strongly suggest the role of AR in allergic asthma pathogenesis and effectiveness of oral administration of AR inhibitor in RWE-induced asthma in mice supports the use of AR inhibitors in the treatment of allergic asthma. </p...|$|E
40|$|BACKGROUND: Goblet cell {{metaplasia}} {{that causes}} mucus hypersecretion and obstruction in the airway lumen could be life threatening in asthma and {{chronic obstructive pulmonary disease}} patients. Inflammatory cytokines such as IL- 13 mediate {{the transformation of}} airway ciliary epithelial cells to mucin-secreting goblet cells in acute as well as chronic airway inflammatory diseases. However, no effective and specific pharmacologic treatment is currently available. Here, we investigated the mechanisms by which aldose reductase (AR) regulates the mucus cell metaplasia in vitro and in vivo. METHODOLOGY/FINDINGS: Metaplasia in primary human small airway epithelial cells (SAEC) was induced by a Th 2 cytokine, IL- 13, without or with AR inhibitor, <b>fidarestat.</b> After 48 h of incubation with IL- 13 a large number of SAEC were transformed into goblet cells as determined by periodic acid-schiff (PAS) -staining and immunohistochemistry using antibodies against Mucin 5 AC. Further, IL- 13 significantly increased the expression of Mucin 5 AC at mRNA and protein levels. These changes were significantly prevented by treatment of the SAEC with AR inhibitor. AR inhibition also decreased IL- 13 -induced expression of Muc 5 AC, Muc 5 B, and SPDEF, and phosphorylation of JAK- 1, ERK 1 / 2 and STAT- 6. In a mouse model of ragweed pollen extract (RWE) -induced allergic asthma treatment with <b>fidarestat</b> prevented the expression of IL- 13, phosphorylation of STAT- 6 and transformation of epithelial cells to goblet cells in the lung. Additionally, while the AR-null mice were resistant, wild-type mice showed goblet cell metaplasia after challenge with RWE. CONCLUSIONS: The results show that exposure of SAEC to IL- 13 caused goblet cell metaplasia, which was significantly prevented by AR inhibition. Administration of <b>fidarestat</b> to mice prevented RWE-induced goblet cell metaplasia and AR null mice were largely resistant to allergen induced changes in the lung. Thus our results indicate that AR inhibitors such as <b>fidarestat</b> could be developed as therapeutic agents to prevent goblet cell metaplasia in asthma and related pathologies...|$|E

Inflammatory cells infiltration in the lungs and goblet cell metaplasia, airway thickening, collagen deposition and airway hyper-responsiveness (AHR) in response to increasing doses of methacholine were assessed. The TGFβ 1 -induced epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) in SAECs and changes in mLFs were examined to investigate AR-mediated molecular mechanism(s) of airway remodeling. In the OVA-exposed mice for 6 wks inflammatory cells infiltration, levels of inflammatory cytokines and chemokines, goblet cell metaplasia, collagen deposition and AHR were significantly decreased by treatment with AR inhibitor, <b>fidarestat.</b> Further, inhibition of AR prevented TGFβ 1 -induced altered expression of E-cadherin, Vimentin, Occludin, and MMP- 2 in SAECs, and alpha-smooth muscle actin and fibronectin in mLFs.

However, the role of AR in mediating hypoxic stress signals is not known. We therefore investigated the molecular mechanisms by which AR inhibition prevents the hypoxia-induced human colon cancer cells growth and invasion. Our results indicate that AR inhibition by the pharmacological inhibitor <b>fidarestat</b> or ablation by AR-specific siRNA prevents hypoxia-induced proliferation of HT 29, SW 480, and Caco- 2 colon cancer cells. Furthermore, hypoxia-induced increase in the level of HIF- 1 α in colon cancer cells was significantly decreased by AR inhibition. During hypoxic conditions, treatment of HT 29 cells with the AR inhibitor <b>fidarestat</b> significantly decreased the expression of vascular endothelial growth factor, a down target of HIF- 1 α, at both mRNA and protein levels and also prevented the activation of PI 3 K/AKT, GSK 3 β, Snail, and lysyl oxidase.

DN develops on a background of hyperglycemia and an entangled metabolic imbalance, mainly oxidative stress. The majority of related pathways like polyol, advanced glycation end products, poly-ADP-ribose polymerase, hexosamine, and protein kinase c all originated from initial oxidative stress. To date, no absolute cure for DN has been defined; although some drugs are conventionally used, much more can be found if all pathophysiological links with oxidative stress would be taken into account.

We investigated the selectivity-determining features by gradually mapping the residues deviating between the binding pockets of ALR 1 and ALR 2 into the ALR 2 binding pocket. The resulting mutational constructs of ALR 2 (eight point mutations and one double mutant) were probed for their influence towards ligand selectivity by X-ray structure analysis of the corresponding complexes and isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC).

Our study revealed induced-fit adaptations within the mutated binding site as an essential prerequisite for ligand accommodation related to the selectivity discrimination of the ligands.

Interestingly, binding site mutations not involved in any direct interaction to the ligands in various cases show significant effects towards their binding thermodynamics. Furthermore, our results suggest the binding site residues deviating between ALR 1 and ALR 2 influence ligand affinity in a complex interplay, presumably involving changes of dynamic properties and differences of the solvation/desolvation balance upon ligand binding...|$|E
40|$|Background: Systemic {{inflammatory}} response syndrome is a fatal disease because of multiple organ failure. Acute kidney injury {{is a serious}} complication of systemic {{inflammatory response}} syndrome and its genesis is still unclear posing a difficulty for an effective treatment. Aldose reductase (AR) inhibitor is recently found to suppress lipopolysaccharide (LPS) -induced cardiac failure and its lethality. We studied the effects of AR inhibitor on LPS-induced acute kidney injury and its mechanism. Methods: Mice were injected with LPS {{and the effects of}} AR inhibitor (<b>Fidarestat</b> 32 mg/kg) before or after LPS injection were examined for the mortality, severity of renal failure and kidney pathology. Serum concentrations of cytokines (interleukin- 1 b, interleukin- 6, monocyte chemotactic protein- 1 and tumor necrosis factor-a) and their mRNA expressions in the lung, liver, spleen and kidney were measured. We also evaluated polyol metabolites in the kidney. Results: Mortality rate within 72 hours was significantly less in LPS-injected mice treated with AR inhibitor both before (29 %) and after LPS injection (40 %) than untreated mice (90 %). LPS-injected mice showed marked increases in blood urea nitrogen, creatinine and cytokines, and AR inhibitor treatment suppressed the changes. LPS-induced acute kidney injury was associated with vacuolar degeneration and apoptosis of renal tubular cells as well as infiltration of neutrophils and macrophages. With improvement of such pathological findings, AR inhibitor treatment suppressed the elevation of cytokine mRNA levels in multiple organs and renal sorbitol accumulation...|$|E
40|$|Retinal {{ischemic injury}} {{is common in}} {{patients}} with diabetes, atherosclerosis, hypertension, transient ischemia attack and amaurosis fugax. Previously, signs of ischemic stress, such as pericyte loss, blood-retinal barrier breakdown and neovascularization, {{which can lead to}} occlusion of retinal vessels, have been prevented in diabetic db/db mice with aldose reductase (AR) null mutation. To determine the role in retinal ischemic injury of AR and sorbitol dehydrogenase (SDH), the first and second enzymes in the polyol pathway, mice with deletion of AR (AR-/-) or SDH-mutation (SDH-/-), or C 57 BL/ 6 N mice treated with AR or SDH inhibitors were subjected to transient retinal artery occlusion (2 h of occlusion and 22 h of reperfusion) by the intraluminal suture method. Neuronal loss and edema observed in wildtype (AR+/+) retinas after transient ischemia were prevented in the retinas of AR-/- mice or C 57 BL/ 6 N mice treated with an AR inhibitor, <b>Fidarestat.</b> Fewer TUNEL-positive cells and smaller accumulations of nitrotyrosine and poly(ADP-ribose) were also observed in the retinas of AR-/- mice. However, SDH-/- mice and C 57 BL/ 6 N mice treated with SDH inhibitor, CP- 470, 711, were not protected against ischemia-induced retinal damage. Taken together, AR contributes to retinal ischemic injury through increased edema and free radical accumulation. Therefore, AR inhibition should be considered for the treatment of retinal ischemic injury often observed in diabetic patients. © 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

40|$|Inflammatory {{reactions}} {{are the most}} critical pathological processes occurring after spinal cord injury (SCI). Activated microglia/macrophages have either detrimental or beneficial effects on neural regeneration based on their functional polarized M 1 /M 2 subsets. However, the mechanism of microglia/macrophage polarization to M 1 /M 2 at the injured spinal cord environment remains unknown. In this study, wild-type (WT) or aldose reductase (AR) -knockout (KO) mice were subjected to SCI by a spinal crush injury model. The expression pattern of AR, behavior tests for locomotor activity, and lesion size were assessed at between 4 h and 28 days after SCI. We found that the expression of AR is upregulated in microglia/macrophages after SCI in WT mice. In AR KO mice, SCI led to smaller injury lesion areas compared to WT. AR deficiency-induced microglia/macrophages induce the M 2 rather than the M 1 response and promote locomotion recovery after SCI in mice. In the in vitro experiments, microglia cell lines (N 9 or BV 2) were treated with the AR inhibitor (ARI) <b>fidarestat.</b> AR inhibition caused 4 -hydroxynonenal (HNE) accumulation, which induced the phosphorylation of the cAMP response element-binding protein (CREB) to promote Arg 1 expression. KG 501, the specific inhibitor of phosphorylated CREB, could cancel the upregulation of Arg 1 by ARI or HNE stimulation. Our results suggest that AR works as a switch which can regulate microglia by polarizing cells to either the M 1 or the M 2 phenotype under M 1 stimulation based on its states of activity. We suggest that inhibiting AR may be a promising therapeutic method for SCI in the future...|$|E
40|$|The {{relationship}} between the structures of protein-ligand complexes existing in the crystal and in solution, essential {{in the case of}} fragment-based screening by X-ray crystallography (FBS-X), has been often an object of controversy. To address this question, simultaneous co-crystallization and soaking of two inhibitors with different ratios, <b>Fidarestat</b> (FID; K(d) = 6. 5 nM) and IDD 594 (594; K(d) = 61 nM), which bind to h-aldose reductase (AR), have been performed. The subatomic resolution of the crystal structures allows the differentiation of both inhibitors, even when the structures are almost superposed. We have determined the occupation ratio in solution by mass spectrometry (MS) Occ(FID) /Occ(594) = 2. 7 and by X-ray crystallography Occ(FID) /Occ(594) = 0. 6. The occupancies in the crystal and in solution differ 4. 6 times, implying that ligand binding potency is influenced by crystal contacts. A structural analysis shows that the Loop A (residues 122 - 130), which is exposed to the solvent, is flexible in solution, and is involved in packing contacts within the crystal. Furthermore, inhibitor 594 contacts the base of Loop A, stabilizing it, while inhibitor FID does not. This is shown by the difference in B-factors of the Loop A between the AR- 594 and AR-FID complexes. A stable loop diminishes the entropic energy barrier to binding, favoring 594 versus FID. Therefore, the effect of the crystal environment should be taken into consideration in the X-ray diffraction analysis of ligand binding to proteins. This conclusion highlights the need for additional methodologies in the case of FBS-X to validate this powerful screening technique, which is widely used...|$|E
40|$|Program / Poster no. 582. 3 / NN 72 Previously, we {{reported}} that over-expression of endothelin- 1 in astrocytes {{leads to more}} severe neurological deficits, increased infarct, and more cerebral edema with more up-regulation of AQP- 4 after transient ischemia. In this transgenic model we also observed increased level of aldose reductase (AR), an osmoregulatory protein whose expression is regulated by osmotic responsive element binding protein (TonEBP/NFAT 5 /OREBP). Actually, AR has already been implicated in generation of osmotic and oxidative stress in diabetic complications, which may be a consequence of ischemic injury. Indeed, our data showed that AR expression was increased after transient middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO). To further understand {{the involvement of the}} polyol pathway, which consists of 2 enzymes, AR that is the rate-limiting enzyme and converts glucose to sorbitol as well as sorbitol dehydrogenase (SD) that converts sorbitol to fructose, in cerebral ischemic injury involving osmotic and oxidative stress, we first challenged AR knockout (AR-/-) mice to MCAO. AR-/- mice were less susceptible to transient focal cerebral ischemic damage, showing less severe neurological deficits and smaller infarct size compared with that observed in AR+/+ mice. Most interestingly, up-regulation of transferrin and transferrin receptor levels observed in AR+/+ brains after MCAO was less in AR-/- brains were decreased. The expression of oxidative stress markers, such as nitrotyrosine and PAR was also significantly less in AR-/- brains. Similar results were obtained with pharmacological inhibition of AR by <b>Fidarestat</b> 1 hr and 45 min after induction of ischemia. Inhibition of SD also reduced infarct size and hemispheric swelling. These results suggest that inhibition of AR and SD is beneficial in cerebral ischemic injury and indicated that blocking AR may alleviate oxidative stress by blocking the involvement of iron-and transferrin-related pathway...|$|E
40|$|The exaggerated flux through polyol pathway during {{diabetes}} {{is thought to}} be a major cause of lesions in the peripheral nerves. Here, we used aldose reductase (AR) -deficient (AR 9 ̆ 6 / 9 ̆ 6) and AR inhibitor (ARI) -treated mice to further understand the in vivo role of polyol pathway in the pathogenesis of diabetic neuropathy. Under normal conditions, there were no obvious differences in the innervation patterns between wild-type AR (AR+/+) and AR 9 ̆ 6 / 9 ̆ 6 mice. Under short-term diabetic conditions, AR 9 ̆ 6 / 9 ̆ 6 mice were protected from the reduction of motor and sensory nerve conduction velocities observed in diabetic AR+/+ mice. Sorbitol levels in the sciatic nerves of diabetic AR+/+ mice were increased significantly, whereas sorbitol levels in the diabetic AR 9 ̆ 6 / 9 ̆ 6 mice were significantly lower than those in diabetic AR+/+ mice. In addition, signs of oxidative stress, such as increased activation of c-Jun NH 2 -terminal kinase (JNK), depletion of reduced glutathione, increase of superoxide formation, and DNA damage, observed in the sciatic nerves of diabetic AR+/+ mice were not observed in the diabetic AR 9 ̆ 6 / 9 ̆ 6 mice, indicating that the diabetic AR 9 ̆ 6 / 9 ̆ 6 mice were protected from oxidative stress in the sciatic nerve. The diabetic AR 9 ̆ 6 / 9 ̆ 6 mice also excreted less 8 -hydroxy- 2 '-deoxyguanosine in urine than diabetic AR+/+ mice. The structural abnormalities observed in the sural nerve of diabetic AR+/+ mice were less severe in the diabetic AR 9 ̆ 6 / 9 ̆ 6 mice, although it was only mildly protected by AR deficiency under short-term diabetic conditions. Signs of oxidative stress and functional and structural abnormalities were also inhibited by the ARI <b>fidarestat</b> in diabetic AR+/+ nerves, similar to those in diabetic AR 9 ̆ 6 / 9 ̆ 6 mice. Taken together, increased polyol pathway flux through AR is a major contributing factor in the early signs of diabetic neuropathy, possibly through depletion of glutathione, increased superoxide accumulation, increased JNK activation, and DNA damage...|$|E
40|$|The TIM-barrel folded enzyme Aldose reductase (ALR 2) is a {{valuable}} model system to study structural and thermodynamic features of inhibitor binding and, furthermore, represents an excellent drug target. To prevent diabetic complications derived from enhanced glucose flux via the polyol pathway the development of aldose reductase inhibitors (ARIs) has been established as a promising therapeutic concept. Its attraction as a test system consists furthermore in the high mobility and adaptivity properties of its active site residues, giving rise to various distinct binding pocket conformers and pronounced induced-fit adaptations upon ligand binding. In chapter 2, we combine a structural characterization of the experimental binding modes observed for two virtual screening hits with isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC) measurements providing insights into the driving forces of inhibitor binding. The nitro group binds {{to the bottom of}} the specificity pocket and provokes remarkable induced-fit adaptations. Identically constituted ligands, lacking this nitro group, exhibit an affinity drop of one order of magnitude. In addition, thermodynamic data suggest a strongly favourable contribution to binding enthalpy in case the inhibitor is equipped with a nitro group at the corresponding position. As these data suggest, the nitro group provokes the enthalpic contribution, in addition to the H-bond mentioned above, by accepting two “non-classical” H-bonds donated by the aromatic tyrosine side chain. In chapter 3, we report on the crystal structures of a novel sulfonyl-pyridazinone inhibitor in complex with aldose reductase. The inhibitor occupies with its pyridazinone head group the catalytic site whereas the chloro-benzofurane moiety penetrates into the opened specificity pocket. The high resolution structure provides some evidence that the pyridazinone group binds in a negatively charged deprotonated state whereas the neighboring His 110 residue most likely adopts a neutral uncharged state. In chapter 4, we probed the ALR 2 binding site with a novel structural class of inhibitors in order to identify putative pocket adaptations. We elucidated two ALR 2 crystal structures, each complexed with a member of the recently described naphtho[1, 2 -d]isothiazole acetic acid series. In contrast to the original design hypothesis based on the binding mode of tolrestat, both inhibitors leave the specificity pocket in closed state. Unexpectedly, the more potent ligand extends the catalytic pocket by opening of a novel subpocket. The second studied inhibitor differs from the first only by an extended glycolic ester functionality added to one of its carboxylic groups. However, despite this slight structural modification, its binding mode differs dramatically from that of the first inhibitor. The two ligand complexes represent an impressive example, how the slight change of a chemically extended side chain at a given ligand scaffold can result in a dramatically altered binding mode. In addition, our study emphasizes the importance of crystal structure analysis for the translation of affinity data into structure-activity relationships. In chapter 5, we study the binding process of inhibitors to ALR 2 with respect to changes of the protonation inventory upon complex formation. As the protonation event will strongly contribute to the enthalpic signal recorded during ITC experiments, knowledge about the proton-accepting and -releasing functional groups of the system is of utmost importance. Here, we present pKa calculations complemented by mutagenesis and thermodynamic measurements suggesting a tyrosine residue located in the catalytic site (Tyr 48) as likely candidate to act as proton acceptor upon inhibitor binding, as it occurs deprotonated to remarkable extent if only the cofactor NADP+ is bound. Binding thermodynamics of IDD 388, IDD 393, tolrestat, sorbinil, and <b>fidarestat</b> are discussed in the context of substituent effects. In chapter 6, the ALR 2 binding site is probed for selectivity determining features, which make binding of certain ligands to ALR 2 more attractive than to the concurrent isoform aldehyde reductase (ALR 1). The resulting mutational constructs of ALR 2 are probed for their influence towards ligand selectivity by X-ray structure analysis of the corresponding complexes and ITC. Accurate crystal structure-determination of protein-ligand complexes is the starting point for further design hypotheses to predict novel leads with improved properties. This widely accepted practise relies on the assumption that the crystal structure of a given protein-ligand complex is unique and independent of the protocol applied to produce the crystals. In chapter 7, we present two examples indicating that this assumption is not generally given...|$|E
