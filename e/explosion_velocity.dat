40|$|In late 2008 we {{recorded}} a continuous multi-parameter data set including Doppler radar, infrared and infrasound data at Yasur volcano, Vanuatu. Our recordings cover a transition in explosive style from ash-rich to ash-free explosions followed again by {{a phase of}} high ash discharge. To assess the present paradigm of Strombolian behavior {{in this study we}} investigate the geophysical signature of these different explosive episodes and compare our results to observations at Stromboli volcano, Italy. To this end we characterize Yasur's surface activity in terms of material movement, temperature and excess pressure. The joint temporal trend in these data reveals smooth variations of surface activity and regime-like persistence of individual explosion forms over days. Analysis of all data types shows ash-free and ash-rich explosive styles similar to those found at Stromboli volcano. During ash-free activity low echo powers, high explosion velocities and high temperatures result from the movement of isolated hot ballistic clasts. In contrast, ash-rich episodes exhibit high echo powers, low explosion velocities and low temperatures linked to the presence of colder ash-rich plumes. Furthermore ash-free explosions cause high excess pressure signals exhibiting high frequencies opposed to low-amplitude, low-frequency signals accompanying ash-rich activity. To corroborate these findings we compare fifteen representative explosions of each explosive episode. Explosion onset velocities derived from Doppler radar and infrared camera data are in excellent agreement and consistent with overall observations in each regime. Examination of infrasound recordings likewise confirms our observations, although a weak coupling between <b>explosion</b> <b>velocity</b> and excess pressure indicates changes in wave propagation. The overall trend in <b>explosion</b> <b>velocity</b> and excess pressure however demonstrates a general correlation between explosive style and explosion intensity, and points to stability of the uppermost conduit on timescales shorter than at Stromboli volcano...|$|E

We simulate synthetic photometry in several realistic observing scenarios and, assuming the models describe the typical explosions well, find that ultraviolet observations can constrain the progenitor's radius to a statistical uncertainty of ± 10 - 15 %, with a systematic uncertainty of ± 20 %.

30|$|One of {{the main}} {{concerns}} in solid transport is pipeline plugging. Plugging {{is not only a}} safety threat but also a financial one. Plugging can lead to frequent shutdowns, equipment damage and even <b>explosions.</b> Deposition <b>velocity</b> determination is one of the design philosophies that can be employed to evaluate plugging potential. Deposition velocity is the velocity below which particles begin to deposit forming moving or stationary beds {{at the bottom of the}} pipe (Poloski et al. 2009 a, b; Yokuda et al. 2009; Turian et al. 1987; Peysson 2004; Doron and Barnea 1996; Ibarra et al. 2014). This causes the flow to become unstable, and the pipe will eventually clog. Partial pipeline blockages may lead to erosion, corrosion and local velocity increase (Najmi et al. 2015). Plugging results from transporting slurries at velocities lower than the deposition velocity (Ibarra et al. 2014; Najmi et al. 2015; Salama 2000; King et al. 2001; McLaury et al. 2011; Al-lababidi et al. 2012). Most deposition models and experimental investigation in open literature focus on Newtonian carrier fluids. The goal of this work is to extend deposition velocity modeling to non-Newtonian fluids. Since deposition velocity is associated with flow regime changes, a flow regime map will be developed in this work. Finally, a predictive method is developed for the deposition velocity and flow regimes.|$|R

However, for a fixed bead layer height the explosion propagation was strongly influenced by the gap height. The combustion products vented from the bead layer behind the flame propagating in the gap affects the structure of the shock-flame front in the gap and the maximum flame velocity achieved. The coupling between the vented products and the flame velocity in the gap was strongly influenced by the gap height.

In earlier studies, models for events at both Pahute Mesa and Amchitka were developed using ground motion recordings from the 5 to 20 km distance range. The models consisted of a source time junction and a source strength, ψ∞ for a point source in a layered elastic crust. In this study the predictions of the models were evaluated at ranges from 0 to 5 km. Surprisingly, the elastic models predict the observed peak vertical velocity very accurately even in the spall zone. They also predict the rise times of the velocity pulses into surface zero. The elastic synthetic seismograms match the observed velocities up until the time when the spalled material begins to decelerate. The observed radial motions are much more poorly modeled. Nevertheless, the results suggest that only low-order corrections to elastic theory may be required to explain some of the phenomena within the inelastic region of contained nuclear <b>explosions.</b> Vertical <b>velocity</b> waveforms within the spall zones of Amchitka and Pahute Mesa events are well modeled by linear elastic theory during the compressive pulse prior to spall.

40|$|We {{suggest that}} the {{energetic}} radiation from core-collapse super-energetic supernovae (SESNe) {{is due to a}} long lasting accretion process onto the newly born neutron star (NS), resulting from an inefficient operation of the jet-feedback mechanism. The jets that are launched by the accreting NS or black hole (BH) maintain their axis due to a rapidly rotating pre-collapse core, and do not manage to eject core material from near the equatorial plane. The jets are able to eject material from the core along the polar directions, and reduce the gravity near the equatorial plane. The equatorial gas expands, and part of it falls back over a timescale of minutes to days to prolong the jets-launching episode. According to the model for SESNe proposed in the present paper, the principal parameter that distinguishes between the different cases of CCSN explosions, such as between normal CCSNe and SESNe, is the efficiency of the jet-feedback mechanism. This efficiency in turn depends on the pre-collapse core mass, envelope mass, core convection, and most of all on the angular momentum profile in the core. One prediction of the inefficient jet-feedback mechanism for SESNe is the formation of a slow equatorial outflow in the <b>explosion.</b> Typical <b>velocity</b> and mass of this outflow are estimated to be approximately 1000 km/s and greater than about 1 solar mass, respectively, though quantitative values will have to be checked in future hydrodynamic simulations.

The H. E. S. S. experiment is able to observe such sources at very-high-energies (> 100 GeV) with the best possible sensitivity to date. As a first part of this work, a simulation of the theoretically expected population of supernova remnants at these energies was performed, followed by an analysis of the very-high-energy gamma-ray emis- sion from the source ensemble known at other wave lengths. Assuming cur- rently accepted standard parameters, the simulation is able to reproduce the observed numbers of supernova remnants in the radio as well as the very-high- energy range, but only if these objects amplify their own magnetic field. It should be mentioned, however, {{that a large number of}} parameters is required in the simulation, many of which are attributed with large uncertainties.

40|$|The {{classification}} of stripped-envelope supernovae (SE-SNe) is revisited using modern data-sets. Spectra are analysed using an empirical method to "blindly" categorise SNe according to spectral feature strength and appearance. This method makes {{a clear distinction}} between SNe that are He-rich (IIb/Ib) and He-poor (Ic) and further analysis is performed on each subgroup. For He-rich SNe the presence of H becomes the focus. The strength, velocity, and ratio between absorption and emission of Hα is measured, along with additional analysis of He I lines, in order to categorise the SNe. The He-poor SNe are ordered according to the number of absorption features N present in the spectra, which {{is a measure of the}} degree of line blending. The kinetic energy per unit mass E_k/M_ej is strongly affected by mass at high velocity and such situations principally occur when the outer density profile of the ejecta is shallow, leading to the blending of lines. Using the results, the existing SE-SN taxonomic scheme is adapted. He-rich SNe are split into four groups, IIb, IIb(I), Ib(II), and Ib, which represent H-rich to H-poor SNe. The SNe Ic category of broad-lined Ic (Ic-BL) is abandoned in favour of quantifying the line blending via before peak.

40|$|Stress-based nonlocal model, Damage, Rate dependency, Dynamic crack-branching Abstract. In {{concrete}} often complex fracture and fragmentation patterns develop when {{subjected to}} high straining loads. The proper simulation {{of the dynamic}} cracking process in concrete is crucial for good predictions of the residual bearing capacity of structures {{in the risk of}} being exposed to extraordinary events like <b>explosions,</b> high <b>velocity</b> impacts or earthquakes. As it is well known, concrete is a highly rate dependent material. Experimental and numerical studies indicate that the evolution of damage is governed by complex phenomena taking place simultaneously at different material scales, i. e. micro, meso and macro-scales. Therefore, the constitutive law, and its rate dependency, must be adjusted to the level of representation. For a proper phenomenological (macroscopic) representation of the reality, the constitutive law has to explicitly describe all phenomena taking place at the lower material scales. Macro-scale inertia effects are implicitly simulated by the equation of motion. In the current paper, dynamic crack propagation and branching is studied with a new rate-dependent stress-based nonlocal damage model. The definition of rate in the constitutive law is changed to account for the inherent meso-scale structural inertia effects. This is accomplished by a new concept of effective rate which governs the dynamic delayed response of the material to variations of the deformation (strain) rate, usually described as micro-inertia effects. The proposed model realistically simulates dynamic crack propagation and crack branching phenomena in concrete. Structural Mechanic...|$|R

Gegenüber dem konventionellen Verfahren wurde die Temperatur auf 180 - 250 °C und der Druck auf 20 - 80 bar angehoben. Auf diese Weise konnte eine Steigerung der Raum-Zeit-Ausbeute um etwa den Faktor 200 (von 25 kg/m³*h auf ca. 6000 kg/m³*h) erreicht werden. Die Umsätze sind dabei denen der industriellen Anlage vergleichbar. Die Selektivität der partiellen Oxidation zu den Wertprodukten cyclohexanol, Cyclohexanon und Cyclohexylhydroperoxid liegt im Kapillarrohrreaktor mit 80 - 90 % etwas unter den in der industriellen Anlage erreichbaren Selektivität von ca. 90 - 95 %. Die Reaktion im Kapillarrohrreaktor wurde auch aus sicherheitstechnischer Perspektive untersucht. Cyclohexan ist in die Explosionsgruppe IIA eingeordnet. Um das System in konservativer Weise zu betrachten, wurde als Stoffsystem Ethen (Referenzgas der Explosionsgruppe IIB) im Gemisch mit Sauerstoff bzw. Lachgas ausgewählt. Es wurde ein Versuchsaufbau konstruiert, mit dem ex möglich war stabile Detonationen zu erzeugen, diese in die Mikrostruktur einzuleiten und deren Ausbreitung und ggf.

Im Versuchsprogramm wurde der Anfangsdruck im Bereich von 0, 1 bis 10 bar und der Rohrdruchmesser der eingesetzten Kapillarrohr im Bereich von 0, 13 - 1 mm variiert. Es zeigt sich, dass sich stabile Detonationen von stöchiometrischen Ethen/Sauerstoff-Gemischen bei einem Anfangsdruck von 1 bar abs gerade noch durch eine Kapillare mit einem Innendurchmesser von 0, 13 mm ausbreiten können.

In {{this thesis}} a process is described for the uncatalyzed selective oxidation of cyclohexane with air at high-p, T-conditions in a micro capillary reactor. At 533 K a spacetime-yield of about 6000 kg/(m 3 ? h) is reached, which {{corresponds to a}} size of 2 m x 2 m x 2 m(8 m 3) of the microstructured reactor assuming a capacity of 100000 t/a compared to 500 m 3 total reactor volume realized with a cascade of bubble columns of each about 100 m 3. Unfortunately, selectivity drops at this temperature below 80 % which is {{significantly lower than the}} selectivity in the conventional process. With the help of the Hatta number, mass transfer limitations can be excluded for the micro capillary reactor, whereas the bubble column reactor is weakly limited by the gas/liquid mass transfer of the molecular oxygen. Thus, process intensification by enhancing mass transfer using a microstructured reactor for cyclohexane oxidation with air is quite low. Furthermore a method and its corresponding results are presented for the determination of maximum safe capillary diameters, which may be used to describe the extended range of safe operation conditions for gas phase oxidation reactions in microstructured reactor devices. Sections of stainless steel micro capillaries of different inner diameters are mounted between a primary and a secondary chamber. An explosion is ignited in the primary chamber, where also a deflagration to detonation transition occurs. The propagation of the detonation through the stainless steel micro capillaries is monitored by pressure transducers located between the sections of the micro capillaries.

40|$|Structural {{catastrophic failure}} of naval vessels due to extreme loads such as {{underwater}} or air <b>explosion,</b> high <b>velocity</b> impact (torpedoes), or hydrodynamic loads (high speed vessels) is primarily caused by fracture. Traditionally, naval structures {{have been designed}} to resist yielding, buckling and fatigue, but not fracture. Consequently, adequate methods and procedures to design ships against fracture have not been developed. The rapidly increasing application of lightweight materials, such as aluminum alloys, in the shipbuilding industry requires fundamental understanding of mechanisms and mechanics of fracture that govern naval stiffened panels. Therefore, a comprehensive tool consisting of application of advanced fracture models, material calibration, and validation through component testing is provided that will increase the survivability envelope and speed up the development process of new vessels. Cracking is a major cause of structural degradation, which is a primary source of costly repair work on metal structures. This thesis studies the structural response of various stiffened plates and compares them with unstiffened plates represented by compact tension (CT) specimens. (cont.) An extensive experimental program is presented that includes coupon testing and small and intermediate scale tests on naval aluminum structures including a variety of monolithic T-type extruded and flatbar welded specimens. Representative naval designs are selected and subjected to quasi-static loading and a number of key parameters, such as geometry, loading rate and structural configuration are evaluated with respect to fracture. Numerical modeling and analyses of ductile fracture initiation and propagation on a pre-cracked geometry using a commercial finite element code (ABAQUS), taking into account the behavior of simple uncracked material, has been performed showing a very good agreement with small and intermediate scale tests. Two major contributions of this thesis are the mapping of crack patterns in stiffened plates {{and the development of a}} methodology which enables ship designers to evaluate critical areas within a structure with respect to crack initiation, propagation, optimum material usage, and computational cost. by Konstantinos P.

40|$|Most of the {{congested}} gas explosions {{studies have}} focused on quantifying global flame acceleration and maximum overpressure through obstacle groupings rather than detailed analysis of the flame propagation through the individual elements of the congested region. Fundamental data of the turbulent flow and combustion parameters would aid better understanding of gas explosion phenomena and mechanisms in the presence of obstacles in addition to the traditional flame speeds and overpressures that are usually reported. In this work we report near stoichiometric methane/air explosion tests in an elongated vented cylindrical vessel 162 mm internal diameter with an overall length-to-diameter, L/D of 27. 7. Single and double obstacles (both hole and flat-bar types) of 20 - 40 % blockage ratios, BR with variable obstacle scale were used. The spacing between the obstacles was systematically varied from 0. 5 m to 2. 75 m. Turbulence parameters were estimated from pressure differential measurements and geometrical obstacle dimensions. This enabled the calculation of the <b>explosions</b> induced gas <b>velocities,</b> rms turbulent velocity, turbulent Reynolds number and Karlovitz number. This allowed the current data to be plotted on a premixed turbulent combustion regimes diagram. The bulk of the data fell in the thickened-wrinkled flames regime. The influence of the calculated Karlovitz number on the measured overpressures was analysed and was related to obstacle separation distance and obstacle scale characteristics...|$|R
40|$|Prior to the {{explosive}} burning {{of a white}} dwarf (WD) that makes a Type Ia supernova (SN Ia), the star "simmers" for 10 ^ 3 yr in a convecting, carbon-burning region. I estimate the excitation of g-modes by convection during this phase and explore their possible effect on the WD. As these modes propagate from {{the core of the}} WD toward its surface, their amplitudes grow with decreasing density. Once the modes reach nonlinear amplitudes, they break and deposit their energy into a shell of mass 10 ^(– 4) M_⊙. This raises the surface temperature by ≈ 4 × 10 ^ 8 K, which is sufficient to ignite a layer of helium, as is expected to exist for some SN Ia scenarios. This predominantly synthesizes ^(40) Ca, but some amount of ^(28) Si, ^(32) S, and ^(44) Ti may also be present. These ashes are expanded out with the subsequent <b>explosion</b> up to <b>velocities</b> of 20, 000 km s^(– 1), which may explain the high velocity features (HVFs) seen in many SNe Ia. The appearance of HVFs would therefore be a useful discriminant for determining between progenitors, since a flammable helium-rich layer will not be present for accretion from a C/O WD as in a merger scenario. I also discuss the implications of ^(44) Ti production. ...|$|R
40|$|We {{solve the}} general-relativistic {{steady-state}} eigenvalue problem of neutrino-driven protoneutron star winds, which immediately follow core-collapse supernova <b>explosions.</b> We provide <b>velocity,</b> density, temperature, and composition profiles {{and explore the}} systematics and structures generic to such a wind {{for a variety of}} protoneutron star characteristics. Furthermore, we derive the entropy, dynamical timescale, and neutron-to-seed ratio in the general relativistic framework essential in assessing this site as a candidate for r-process nucleosynthesis. Generally, we find that for a given mass outflow rate (˙M), the dynamical timescale of the wind is significantly shorter than previously thought. We argue against the existence or viability of a high entropy (� 300 per kB per baryon), long dynamical timescale r-process epoch. In support of this conclusion, we model the protoneutron star cooling phase, calculate nucleosynthetic yields in our steady-state profiles, and estimate the integrated mass loss. We find that transonic winds enter a high entropy phase only with very low ˙M (� 1 × 10 − 9 M ⊙ s − 1) and extremely long dynamical timescale (τρ � 0. 2 seconds). Our results support the possible existence of an early r-process epoch at modest entropy (∼ 150) and very short dynamical timescale, consistent in our calculations with a very massive or very compact protoneutron star that contracts rapidly after the preceding supernova. We explore possible modification...|$|R
40|$|We {{study the}} physics of core-collapse supernovae and the neutron stars they create. We study the microphysics of {{neutrino}} interactions and demonstrate the importance of two processes previously ignored in full supernova simulations: inelastic neutrino-nucleon scattering and nucleon-nucleon bremsstrahlung. We show that these processes dominate neutrino-electron scattering and electron-positron annihilation as thermalization and production mechanisms, respectively, for mu- and tau-neutrinos in regimes vital to emergent spectrum formation. In addition, we solve the general-relativistic steady-state eigenvalue problem of neutrino-driven protoneutron star winds, which immediately follow core-collapse supernova <b>explosions.</b> We provide <b>velocity,</b> density, temperature, and composition profiles and explore the systematics and structures generic to such a wind {{for a variety of}} protoneutron star characteristics. Furthermore, we derive the entropy, dynamical timescale, and compositions essential in assessing this site as a candidate for r-process nucleosynthesis. Finally, we construct dynamical models of core-collapse supernovae. We employ a full solution to the transport equation for each neutrino species, a realistic high-density nuclear equation of state, and explicit hydrodynamics. We present results from a set of different supernova progenitors. We vary the microphysics and nuclear equation of state and compare our results to those of other groups. We examine the electron-neutrino breakout phenomenon and address the importance of nucleon-nucleon bremsstrahlung and inelastic neutrino-electron scattering in mu and tau neutrino spectrum formation. We convolve the emergent spectra obtained in these models with terrestrial neutrino detectors and find that the electron-neutrino breakout burst can likely be observed and identified uniquely...|$|R
40|$|Some supernovae (SNe) show {{evidence}} for mass-loss events taking place {{prior to their}} explosions. Measuring their pre-outburst mass-loss rates provide essential information regarding the mechanisms {{that are responsible for}} these events. Here we present XMM-Newton and Swift X-ray observations taken after the latest, and presumably the final, outburst of SN 2009 ip. We use these observations as well as new near infra-red and visible light spectra, and published radio and visible light observations to put six independent order-of-magnitude constrains on the mass-loss rate of the SN progenitor prior to the explosion. Our methods utilize: the X-ray luminosity, the bound-free absorption, the H alpha luminosity, the SN rise-time, free-free absorption, and the bolometric luminosity of the outburst detected prior to the explosion. Assuming spherical mass-loss with a wind density profile, we estimate that the effective mass-loss rate from the progenitor was between 10 ^- 3 to 10 ^- 2 solar masses per year, over a few years prior to the <b>explosion,</b> with a <b>velocity</b> of ~ 1000 km/s. This mass-loss rate corresponds to a total circum stellar matter mass of ~ 0. 04 solar masses, within 6 x 10 ^ 15 cm of the SN. We note that the mass-loss rate estimate based on the H alpha luminosity is higher by an order of magnitude. This can be explained if the narrow line H alpha component is generated at radii larger than the shock radius, or if the CSM has an aspherical geometry. We discuss simple geometries which are consistent with our results. Comment: 8 pages, accepted to Ap...|$|R
40|$|Twenty {{low-energy}} (0. 0077 0. 625 kgs- 1) explosions {{from the}} Northeast Crater of Stromboli Volcano, recorded by a thermal camera, were studied in detail {{to better understand}} their dynamics. Each single burst consists of three different jets of different material which come one after another: at first, cold vapour flashes above the crater, expands and then disappears within 0. 6 s after {{the onset of the}} <b>explosion,</b> at a <b>velocity</b> of 40 - 113 ms- 1. This air shock wave is immediately followed by the expansion of a jet of hot magmatic gas, at a velocity of 35 - 75 ms- 1. Colder coarse tephra (bombs and scoriae) appear about 1. 6 - 2 s after the onset of explosion, moving at a reduced velocity (28 - 60 ms- 1). Further on, some of these data were utilized to calibrate a set of flow simulation in a 220 - 260 -m-long conduit, which validates the model of slug flow for these kinds of eruptions. Finally, coupling all the collected data with the stratigraphy of the volcano, we hypothesized that a physical barrier might be responsible for the formation of slugs of gas and their ascent toward the surface at regular intervals. This barrier acts as a siphon and seems to be generated by the displacement of the upper conduit due to summit instability. This model justifies the ~constant interval between explosions, the insensitivity of this behavior to the occurrence of effusive episodes and highly explosive events, as well as the generation of fairly constant petrochemical characteristics of the magma which is commonly erupted, with time...|$|R
