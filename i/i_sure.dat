Who knows what fortune will do for us? Great things have been {{effected}} by a few men well conducted. Perhaps we may be fortunate. We have this consolation, that our cause is just, and that our country will be grateful and not condemn our conduct in case we fall through. If we fail, the Illinois as well as Kentucky, I believe, is lost.|$|E
500|$|Continuing their travels, the two {{come across}} a {{universe}} where singer and performer Frank Sinatra was never born, resulting {{in the loss of}} the 1960 presidential election by President John F. Kennedy to then-Vice President Richard Nixon, which causes World War III. Brian questions whether Lee Harvey Oswald shot Kennedy, and Stewie responds that he shot Mayor McCheese instead. A sequence similar to the Zapruder film, which shows the assassination of Kennedy, is shown, with Jacqueline Kennedy also appearing. Brian and Stewie next discover a universe completely depicted as a political cartoon. The next reference occurs in the dog universe when Stewie says, [...] "Take your stinking paws off me you damn, dirty dog!" [...] which is a reference to the famous quote [...] "Take your stinking paws off me you damn, dirty ape!" [...] from the first Planet of the Apes movie. The final reference of the episode also occurs in the dog universe when Stewie mentions, [...] "Gosh, Brian, <b>I</b> <b>sure</b> hope this next leap, will be the leap home," [...] a nod to the opening narration of the time travel series Quantum Leap.|$|E
500|$|Several players thought having over 150 players wearing number 42 on Jackie Robinson Day {{was far too}} many. [...] "This is {{supposed}} to be an honor", Minnesota Twins outfielder Torii Hunter told USA Today, [...] "and just a handful of guys wearing the number. Now you've got entire teams doing it. I think we're killing the meaning. It should be special wearing Jackie's number, not just because it looks cool." [...] Cleveland Indians pitcher CC Sabathia, who decried the lack of African-American players in the game in March 2007, told USA Today that [...] "It kind of waters it down. I could see the Dodgers since that was his team, but not everyone else." [...] "I didn't know so many guys planned to wear the number. <b>I</b> <b>sure</b> wasn't expecting whole teams to wear it", Griffey told the USA Today. [...] "But I'm not going to {{look at it as a}} negative. This is a tribute for what the man has done, a day to celebrate." [...] Garret Anderson, Los Angeles Angels left fielder, told the USA Today that he won't wear number 42 because [...] "I just don't feel I'm worthy of it." ...|$|E

500|$|After this loss, McGovern {{remained}} in the Senate. He was scarred by the enormous defeat, and his wife Eleanor took it even worse; {{during the winter of}} 1972–73, the couple seriously considered moving to England. His allies were replaced in positions of power within the Democratic Party leadership, and the McGoverns did not get publicly introduced at party affairs they attended. On January 20, 1973, a few hours after Richard Nixon was re-inaugurated, McGovern gave a speech at the Oxford Union that talked about the abuses of Nixon's presidency; it brought criticism, including from some Democrats, for being ill-mannered. In order to get past the [...] "bitterness and self-pity" [...] he felt, McGovern forced himself to deal with the defeat humorously before audiences; starting at the March 1973 Gridiron Dinner, he frequently related his campaign misadventures in a self-deprecating fashion, such as saying, [...] "For many years, I wanted to run for the Presidency in the worst possible way – and last year <b>I</b> <b>sure</b> did." [...] Nevertheless, emotions surrounding the loss would remain with McGovern for decades, as it did with some other defeated presidential nominees. Nixon resigned in August 1974 due to the Watergate scandal. McGovern said President Gerald R. Ford's subsequent September 1974 pardon of Nixon was difficult to understand given that Nixon's subordinates were going to prison.|$|E
500|$|The show {{opened with}} Beastie Boys {{performing}} six of their songs for 30 minutes. They {{were accompanied by}} their DJ, Rick Rubin, who scratched the music, with The Beastie Boys prancing around the stage, making lewd gestures towards the audience. As they finished their performance, the backdrops started displaying Madonna's images from her music videos. The band—consisting of guitarists, bassists, a drummer and three synthesizer players—came into focus, and the music started. Madonna's voice was heard, saying: [...] "Don't be afraid... it's gonna be alright." [...] Then, Madonna's silhouette appeared behind a white screen {{on top of the}} stairs as the first beats kicked in. The white screen lifted and she is finally seen, wearing a psychedelic housecoat, a blue see-through crop-top and her characteristic black bra. She also had lacy leggings and crucifixes around her ear and her neck. She posed on the stairs before reaching the microphone to sing [...] "Dress You Up". After dancing to the last note of the music, Madonna and the two male back-up dancers went {{to the back of the}} stage, as the music of [...] "Holiday" [...] began. Taking a moment to ask the audience how they are feeling, Madonna declared, [...] "I was never elected homecoming queen, but <b>I</b> <b>sure</b> feel like one now", and started the performance of [...] "Into the Groove", playing a tambourine. A boombox was present on the stage during the performance, Madonna sitting and playing with it, and addressing it as her [...] "box". She continued with [...] "Everybody", while asking the audience to clap along with her. As she finished the vigorous performance of [...] "Everybody", the lights were dimmed and the introduction music of [...] "Angel" [...] started. Rotating lights fell on the stage. Madonna appeared sitting on top of the stairs and gradually descended. During the intermediate bridge, she and her dancers moved energetically around the whole stage, as white balloons fell on them from above. Madonna continued singing as the lights were dimmed again. She finished the performance and disappeared behind the wings for a costume change.|$|E

When asked what was the best advice she was given, Scott replied, [...] "I don't know, but <b>I</b> <b>sure</b> didn't take it." [...] Her mother told her to subdue her {{emotions}} and [...] "be a lady", but despite a strict Catholic upbringing, Scott described herself as having been [...] "rebellious and outspoken" [...] as a young girl. However, Scott mentioned adolescent favorites such as Ralph Waldo Emerson's Essays as having the greatest influence on her.|$|E
2500|$|Although he {{continued}} to work with William Shatner in the Star Trek films, Doohan did not get along well with him and was once quoted as saying, [...] "I like Captain Kirk, but <b>I</b> <b>sure</b> don't like Bill." [...] He was the only former Star Trek co-star to decline {{to be interviewed by}} Shatner for Shatner's first Star Trek: Memories book about the show, nor did he consent to do so for Shatner's follow-up book, Star Trek: Movie Memories, though Shatner mentioned in the latter that the icy relationship between the two started to thaw when both men were working on Star Trek Generations in 1993-94. At Doohan's final August 2004 convention appearance, Doohan and Shatner appeared to have mended their relationship.|$|E

He said, [...] "It would be nice not to have to loan or contribute to your own campaign... If other people are making sacrifices, <b>I</b> <b>sure</b> have to as well. It’s not a dream come true.

2500|$|In overview, {{the works}} for the double album in this period were {{intended}} to be packaged in a plain brown wrapper, with a [...] "strictly personal" [...] over-stamp and addressed {{in a manner that}} could have connotations of drug content, pornographic or illicit material; As per the small ads of the time: [...] "It comes to you in a plain brown wrapper." [...] Given that Krasnow had effectively poached the band from Buddah there were limitations on what material could be released. Strictly Personal was the result, contained in its enigmatically-addressed parcel sleeve. The raft of material left behind eventually emerged, firstly on CD as I May Be Hungry, But <b>I</b> <b>Sure</b> Ain't Weird and later on vinyl, implemented by John French, as It Comes To You in a Plain Brown Wrapper (which has two tracks that are missing from the former release). Both Blue Thumb and the stamps on the cover of Strictly Personal have LSD connotations, as does the track Ah Feel Like Ahcid, although Beefheart himself refuted this (claiming that this is a rendering of [...] "I feel like I said").|$|E

I guess it worked {{for a lot of}} people who heard it, but I have no idea how you'd begin to take that one literally." [...] In another interview he elaborated further, stating, [...] "It's funny because hits are usually sort of congruent, sort of an identifiable lyric idea, and that song pretty much had none. The chorus lyric is kind of beautiful and easy to remember. Other than that, <b>I</b> <b>sure</b> didn't have an understanding of it after I wrote it. I was just sucked in by the music and I was painting a picture with the lyrics. There was no real idea to get across." [...] Commenting upon how the song was misinterpreted as being positive, Cornell said, [...] "No one seems to get this, but 'Black Hole Sun' is sad. But because the melody is really pretty, everyone thinks it's almost chipper, which is ridiculous." [...] When asked about the line, [...] "Times are gone for honest men", Cornell said: ...|$|E
2500|$|Clarke's line {{played against}} {{the line of}} the Soviets' top player, Valeri Kharlamov, during the entire series. After being on the {{receiving}} end of some stick work from Kharlamov while going for the puck, Clarke caught up with Kharlamov and laid a two-handed slash across his ankle, breaking it in the process. Though Kharlamov finished the game, he missed the seventh game and was largely ineffective in the eighth. When asked about the slash years later, Clarke said, [...] "If I hadn't learned to lay on a two-hander once in a while, I'd never have left Flin Flon." [...] 30 years after the series, Henderson criticized Clarke, calling the slash, [...] "the low point of the series." [...] Clarke responded saying that he thought it was [...] "improper to criticize a teammate thirty years later," [...] and that he did not [...] "understand why he would bring it up now." [...] Henderson has since retracted his criticism. Kharlamov, prior to his death in 1981, said he thought Clarke was tasked with [...] "taking me out of the game." [...] John Ferguson, Sr., an assistant coach with Team Canada in 1972, said, [...] "I called Clarke over to the bench, looked over at Kharlamov and said, 'I think he needs a tap on the ankle.' I didn't think twice about it. It was Us versus Them. And Kharlamov was killing us. I mean, somebody had to do it. And <b>I</b> <b>sure</b> wasn't going to ask Henderson."

2500|$|In June 2015, while {{promoting}} his second solo album Cauterize, Mark Tremonti claimed {{in an interview}} with Kerrang that he [...] " [...] been a close friend of Scott's in 9 years". He said that Stapp believed that the other members would end Alter Bridge and perform solely with him in Creed, which they didn't wish to do, as they had established a unique foundation in that band. The other members did not speak to Stapp throughout the South American Tour in 2012 and plans for their fifth studio album were shelved, and they continued to work with Myles Kennedy in Alter Bridge. [...] In August 2015, Tremonti reiterated that there were no plans for Creed {{for at least the next}} few years, but he didn't rule out the possibility. [...] In September 2015, Stapp appeared on the Dr. Oz Show and recounted his history with depression and drug use, and how they contributed to mental health scare in November. [...] When asked about a Creed reunion, Stapp replied: [...] "I can tell you what, <b>I</b> <b>sure</b> hope so. I love the guys with all my heart and if they’re watching, 'Come on guys, let’s make a record.'" [...] He later doubled down on the statements by stating that Creed would [...] "definitely" [...] reunite and that he expected new material from the band within [...] "the next two years." [...] When asked about Stapp's statements, Tremonti clarified that he was still busy {{promoting his}} solo albums and that Alter Bridge would record and tour in 2016, making it unlikely for him to return to Creed within Stapp's proposed timeline.|$|E
