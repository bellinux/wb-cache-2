Nominal and {{worst case scenario}} behavior of systems can be modelled sufficiently, however, still lacking the ability of simulating the behavior of technical systems as a whole, combining single-domain subsystems. Therefore, unpredictable failure can occur, which displays the demand for computer-aided system analysis. To counteract the foresaid, a concept has been proposed, which enables sufficient designing and implementing a highly flexible model landscape. It serves the process from comprehending a technical system's specifications and functions towards an executable model structure, using the Modelica-based modelling software SimulationX.

40|$|Determining {{cost-effective}} vehicle scheduling is {{an important}} optimization issue in mass transportation networks. An interesting question {{in this context is}} whether allowing certain flexibility in the departure times of scheduled routes may reduce the number of vehicles needed. We formulate this question as the <b>FLEXIBLE</b> <b>TRAIN</b> ROSTERING 1 problem. We consider two cases that are of practical interest: - Unlimited flexibility: only the durations of routes are given and we are free to determine the most appropriate departure time for each route. - Limited flexibility: initial departure times are given, together with a delay threshold ε; we are asked to determine the most appropriate delay ≤ ε for each route. We also consider variants where we are allowed to use empty rides, (i. e., routes without passengers). We present a variety of results for these problems: polynomial-time algorithms that optimally solve some of them, script N℘P- and script A℘script X-hardness proofs for others, as well as approximation algorithms for most of the hard problems. © Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg 2003...|$|E
40|$|A load {{moving on}} a center-fixed ring and the {{reciprocal}} problem, namely a rotating ring {{subjected to a}} moving load {{have been used in}} several works to study the tire dynamics. In contrast, very few papers exist in which the ring model has been used in order to study the dynamics of a train wheel. In this paper, a thin ring model is introduced to model a <b>flexible</b> <b>train</b> wheel with distributed springs acting in the radial, circumferential and rotational directions to study the wheel dynamic response. A so-called “method of images” is applied to solve the governing equations. The idea of this method is that the response of the rotating ring to a stationary load is equivalent to the response of an axially moving, infinitely long beam subjected to a set of loads located equidistantly on the beam. Taking advantage of linearity of the problem, the response is obtained as a superposition of the responses to the individual loads. The method of images combined with the contour integration technique, allows to obtain an exact analytical solution to the problem that includes neither infinite series nor integrals. The exact maximum bending moment in the ring obtained using the method of images is compared to that resulting from a series representation of the solution based on the modal expansion. The results show that many terms in the modal expansion are necessary in order to accurately approximate the exact solution. This means that the method of images is significantly more efficient than the modal expansion method. Structural EngineeringCivil Engineering and Geoscience...|$|E
40|$|AbstractIn most European {{congested}} {{urban areas}} the rail tracks of the 19 th and 20 th century serving locations {{of industry and}} goods stations were removed, transformed for public passenger transport, closed down or used for other purposes. The main reasons might be the de-industrialisation of the inner cities and the centralisation of the supply-sector (wholesale markets, shopping centres). Simultaneous the urban areas got an excellent road network {{on the surface and}} an efficient public transport system in the underground or on dedicated tracks. Nevertheless the amount of goods delivered to urban areas increased due to material prosperity. In this context “METRO. FREIGHT. 2020 ” analysed the possibilities of a reinforced utilisation of railway infrastructure for freight transport on the first and the last miles within the urban regions in Austria as exemplified in case studies for the metropolitan Region of Vienna, the agglomerations of Graz and Linz and for the urbanised Rhine-Valley in Vorarlberg. In this context the focus point of consideration was the interface of transport and urban development, to a lesser extent the theoretical approach behind. As a fundamental milestone a cadastre of existing or recoverable sidings or other rail shipping points has been surveyed. They were evaluated in respect of serviceability concerning tracking freight trains in the rail network and extensibility in the service area which was complemented with propositions for further developing. The recommendations focus measures intending technically and economically operable access points to rail net on one hand and potentially appropriate access points for the future. But, to reach this goal more strengthened integration of commercial location policy and of shippers’ transport demands with a coordinated land use planning and an infrastructure development policy is required. Finally the methodical approach elaborated comprises following components to push more rail freight shipping:•Traffic zoning is a hierarchical spatial approach subdividing an urban region in sectors, zones and ‘agglomerates’ as spheres of activity for political and private actors involved in freight traffic generation and infrastructure affaires. •Surveying a multimodal topology of infrastructure network which integrates all transport modes in its layout of freight infrastructure propped up on a public platform of a multimodal network graph in future. •Characterizing an ‘agglomerate’ typology of shipping sites with affinity to rail which describes the typical initial position and development trends of the freight transport inducing traffic zones. •Shaping spatial structures which consist of super structures of shipping industrial sites as traffic generators, the infrastructure with its capacity for freight movements and the ‘metastructure’ as external affected settlements and land uses are prime targets and intervention objects, the coordinated measures have to be allocated to. The railway operators are called on to offer more <b>flexible</b> <b>train</b> and operation forms tailored to the logistics of shippers if the rail infrastructure within the serving area from the consolidation node to the sidings enables it. In the end three scenarios have been identified, namely a scenario of ultimate displacement of rail freight service in towns, a retarding scenario which brakes the retreat of rail connected with a change of paradigm in transport and traffic planning leading into an offensive scenario of ‘clean freight mobility’ to revitalize and extend rail freight operations into areas of high consumption...|$|E

40|$|BACKGROUND <b>Flexible</b> <b>training</b> {{options are}} sought by an {{increasing}} number of Australasian surgical trainees. Reasons include increased participation of women in the surgical workforce, postgraduate training and changing attitudes to family responsibilities. Despite endorsement of <b>flexible</b> <b>training</b> by the Royal Australasian College of Surgeons and Board in General Surgery, part-time (PT) training in General Surgery in Australia and New Zealand is not well established. A permanent ‘stand-alone’ PT training position was established at the Royal Adelaide Hospital in 2007 under the Surgical Education and Training Program. This position offered 12 months of General Surgical training on a 0. 5 full-time (FT) equivalent basis with pro rata emergency and on-call commitments and was accredited for 6 months of General Surgical training. This paper reviews the PT training experience in South Australia. METHODS De-identified logbook data were obtained from the South Australian Regional Subcommittee of the Board in General Surgery with consent of each of the trainees. Totals of operative cases were compared against matched FT trainees working on the same unit. RESULTS Overall, PT trainees achieved comparable operative caseloads compared with their FT colleagues. All trainees included in this review have subsequently passed the Royal Australasian College of Surgeons Fellowship Examination in General Surgery and returned to FT workforce positions. CONCLUSION This paper presents two validated models of PT training. Training, resource and regulatory requirements and individual and institutional barriers to <b>flexible</b> <b>training</b> are substantial. Successful PT models offer positive and beneficial training alternatives for General Surgical trainees and contribute to workforce flexibility.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this report is to succinctly review the history, evolution, and {{accreditation}} process of postgraduate surgical training programs in the United States, with emphasis on recent dramatic changes in vascular surgery training. Vascular surgery became a distinct specialty of surgery on March 17, 2005, when the American Board of Surgery (ABS) received approval from the American Board of Medical Specialties (ABMS) to offer a Primary Certificate in Vascular Surgery. The traditional requirement for 5 years of training and certification in general surgery was eliminated. Effective July 1, 2006, the ABS converted its certificate in vascular surgery from a subspecialty certificate to a specialty (primary) certificate. These landmark changes allowed the simultaneous development of new <b>training</b> paradigms. Multiple <b>flexible</b> <b>training</b> pathways leading to either dual certification (Traditional 5 - 2; Early Specialization Program 4 - 2) or vascular surgery certification alone (Integrated 0 - 5; Independent 3 - 3) now exist. New pathways require a minimum of 2 years of core surgery training and 3 years of advanced vascular training. There are currently 96 accredited traditional 5 - 2 programs, five 4 - 2 programs, and 11 0 - 5 integrated programs, with multiple additional institutions {{in the process of}} submitting 0 - 5 applications. The main obstacle preventing more rapid transition to the new pathways seems to be difficulty in obtaining funding for additional resident positions.

40|$|OBJECTIVES: To {{report on}} the views of doctors about {{flexible}} and part-time working in medicine. DESIGN: As part of ongoing studies of doctors' careers, postal questionnaires were sent in 1995 and 1996 to all doctors who qualified from UK medical schools in 1977, 1988 and 1993. Structured questions about recipients' careers were accompanied by a form which invited free-text comment. Comments about flexible and part-time working were extracted for analysis. SUBJECTS: All respondents who commented on flexible and part-time working. RESULTS: Most doctors who commented believed there were insufficient opportunities to meet demand. They also commonly commented {{that there was not}} enough information about <b>flexible</b> <b>training</b> opportunities. Some men, as well as women, expressed a wish to work part-time. The most frequently cited reasons for part-time working were to balance career with family responsibilities, and to reduce work-related stress. Cited disadvantages of part-time working were mainly financial and included the problems of paying for childcare and professional subscriptions when on a reduced income. Some respondents perceived negative attitudes towards doctors in part-time jobs. DISCUSSION: It is well-recognised that more flexible medical career structures are needed so that doctors can vary their time commitment according to their needs at particular stages in their lives. Until recently, needs have not been adequately met. Changes in arrangements for <b>flexible</b> <b>training</b> accompanying the implementation of the specialist registrar grade may have begun to alleviate some of the problems, but others, such as negative attitudes towards part-time work, may take time to change...|$|R
