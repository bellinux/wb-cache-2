In 2015 the government abrogated a 15-year ceasefire with the Khaplang <b>faction</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> NSCM (NSCM-K). The NSCM-K responded {{with a series of}} attacks, which killed 18 people. The Modi government carried out a raid across the border with Myanmar as a result, and labelled the NSCM-K a terrorist organisation.|$|E

On 26 February 1990, {{following}} the withdrawal of Vietnamese troops, the Third Jakarta Informal Meeting was held, at which the Supreme National Council was established to safeguard Cambodian sovereignty. Initially, the Supreme National Council was to have 12 members, with three seats allocated to each <b>faction</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> CGDK, and three to the pro-Vietnam Kampuchean People’s Revolutionary Party. However, Hun Sen objected to the proposed arrangement, calling instead for each <b>faction</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> CGDK to be given two seats {{for a total of}} six, and the Kampuchean People’s Revolutionary Party to have six seats. In 1991 the Supreme National Council began representing Cambodia at the UN General Assembly. Then, in a bold move, Hun Sen renamed the Kampuchean People's Revolutionary Party to the Cambodian People's Party in an effort to portray his party as a democratic institution and renounce its revolutionary struggle.|$|E

5|$|In August 1960, Clements {{met with}} Combs {{and told him}} he wanted to resign to work for the vice-presidential {{campaign}} of Lyndon Johnson. Combs called a press conference and announced that Clements' resignation would be effective September 1 and that he would be replaced by Henry Ward. The resignation {{was the end of the}} Clements <b>faction</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> state Democratic party. His split with Combs was so severe that he allied with his longtime foe, Happy Chandler, against the new Combs <b>faction</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> party. In the 1962 senatorial race, Clements opposed Wilson Wyatt's challenge to Senator Thruston Morton. Morton won re-election, ending Wyatt's political career. Chandler again sought the Democratic gubernatorial nomination in 1963. Clements appeared on stage with Chandler at a rally where Chandler claimed that Combs had arranged the truck deal to discredit Clements. Chandler hoped to damage Combs' reputation and, by extension, that of his hand-picked successor Edward T. Breathitt. His strategy was unsuccessful; Breathitt carried the primary and went on to win the general election. Clements' waning influence was evidenced by the fact that Breathitt carried Union County by a vote of 2,528 to 1,913.|$|E
