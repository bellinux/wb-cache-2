5|$|Audience {{etiquette}} {{is generally}} similar to formal western theatre—the audience quietly watches. Surtitles are not used, but some audience members <b>follow</b> <b>along</b> in the libretto. Because {{there are no}} curtains on the stage, the performance begins with the actors entering the stage and ends with their leaving the stage. The house lights are usually kept on during the performances, creating an intimate feel that provides a shared experience between the performers and the audience.|$|E

5|$|M-31 {{started at}} M-21 in Port Huron and ran northward along the Lake Huron shoreline. Along the way, it intersected the western {{terminus}} of M-46 before reaching Harbor Beach. In town, the original M-27 merged {{in from the}} north, and M-27/M-31 ran concurrently westward, turning inland. The two highways separated north of Ruth as M-27 turned southward. M-31 continued across The Thumb through Bad Axe, where it ran concurrently with M-19 in town. The highway carried on westward through Elkton and Pigeon to Bay Port. Once there, the trunkline turned southwesterly to <b>follow</b> <b>along</b> part of the Saginaw Bay. The road passed through Sebewaing to Unionville before turning back inland. Running southward to Akron, the highway turned alternately westward and southward to Fairgrove. M-31 next ran west along Bradleyville Road to a connection with M-81; the two highways ran concurrently south through Gilford before M-31 separated and turned back westward through Reese to Saginaw. The northern terminus in downtown Saginaw was at an intersection with what was then M-10.|$|E

5|$|Prompt Payment and Stealing a Ride are two 1911 American silent short comedy films {{produced}} by the Thanhouser Company. Prompt Payment focuses on a lawyer who evades his creditors, dons a disguise and plays against them {{in a game of}} poker. After winning a large sum of money from them, he excuses himself and returns to pay them with their own money. Stealing a Ride is listed as a comedy, but has a clear dramatic element. Susie and Johnnie are out sledding when Susie's parents are about to go out for a sleigh drive. The children ask to come along, but are refused. The children hitch their sleds {{to the back of the}} sleigh and <b>follow</b> <b>along,</b> only to fall off and get lost in the woods. The parents later track them down and bring them home. Both films were released together on a single reel on January 27, 1911 and were met with praise by critics. Both films are presumed lost.|$|E
5|$|The elite, hand-selected {{audience}} members favored with admission to performances by the concerto delle donne demanded diversions and entertainment beyond {{the pleasures of}} beautiful music alone. During the concerts, members of the concertos audience would sometimes play cards. Orazio Urbani, ambassador of the Grand Duke of Tuscany, having waited several years to see the concerto, complained that he was forced not only to play cards, distracting him from the performance, but also simultaneously admire and praise the women's music to their patron Alfonso. After at least one concert, to continue the entertainment, a dwarf couple danced. Alfonso was not as interested in these peripheral entertainments, and in one instance excused himself from the party to go sit under a tree {{to listen to the}} ladies, and <b>follow</b> <b>along</b> with the madrigal texts and musical scores, including embellishments, which were made available to listeners.|$|E

25|$|The Trio {{was dealt}} a severe blow by Stanislaus Zbyszko, when he beat the rookie Wayne Munn for their world heavyweight championship, against the {{original}} booking. Munn, {{who had been}} recruited to wrestling and pushed {{to the level of}} champion in only a few months, was the Trio's new star and main attraction. Zbyszko was supposed to lose to Munn, but refused to <b>follow</b> <b>along,</b> beating Munn so decisively and thoroughly that the referee awarded him the title to prevent a riot. In addition, Zbyszko quickly dropped the title to Joe Stecher, a rival of Ed Lewis, making the situation worse for the Trio.|$|E
25|$|Ebola {{virus disease}} (EVD), {{also known as}} Ebola hemorrhagic fever (EHF) or simply Ebola, is a viral hemorrhagic fever of humans and other {{primates}} caused by ebolaviruses. Signs and symptoms typically start between two days and three weeks after contracting the virus with a fever, sore throat, muscular pain, and headaches. Then, vomiting, diarrhea and rash usually <b>follow,</b> <b>along</b> with decreased function of the liver and kidneys. At this time, some people begin to bleed both internally and externally. The disease has {{a high risk of}} death, killing between 25 and 90 percent of those infected, with an average of about 50 percent. This is often due to low blood pressure from fluid loss, and typically follows six to sixteen days after symptoms appear.|$|E

25|$|In {{the first}} round, with a voter turnout of 46%, {{the results were}} split between five major candidates: Mohamed Morsi (25%), Ahmed Shafik (24%), Hamdeen Sabahi (21%), Abdel Moneim Aboul Fotouh (17%), and Amr Moussa (11%), while the {{remaining}} 2% were split between several smaller candidates. The elections {{set the stage for}} the divisions that were to <b>follow,</b> <b>along</b> Islamist and secular lines, and those opposed to and those supporting the former political elite. Islamist candidates Morsi and Fotouh won roughly 42% of the vote, while the remaining secular candidates won 56% of the vote. Candidates Shafik and Moussa held positions under the Mubarak regime and won 35% of the vote, while Sabahi was a prominent dissident during the Sadat and Mubarak regimes.|$|E
25|$|In the UK, {{supporters}} of fox hunting {{regard it as}} a distinctive part of British culture generally, the basis of traditional crafts and {{a key part of}} social life in rural areas, an activity and spectacle enjoyed not only by the riders but also by others such as the unmounted pack which may <b>follow</b> <b>along</b> on foot, bicycle or 4x4. They see the social aspects of hunting as reflecting the demographics of the area; the Home Counties packs, for example, are very different from those in North Wales and Cumbria, where the hunts are very much the activity of farmers and the working class. The Banwen Miners Hunt is such a working class club founded in a small Welsh mining village, although its membership now is by no means limited to miners, with a cosmopolitan make up.|$|E
25|$|On March 17, 1865, {{less than}} one month {{before the end of}} the war, he participated in a mission to attack Confederate forces in Mattox Creek, a {{tributary}} of the Potomac in Virginia.

Anderson and a number of other black landsmen worked the oars on the boat, while Boatswain's Mate Patrick Mullen manned the howitzer and Ensign Summers acted as commander. As the boat and the accompanying foot soldiers made their way up the creek's right fork, the foot soldiers came under sporadic fire from snipers. Upon finding four small boats which had been abandoned by the Confederates, the soldiers on the river bank set about destroying them.|$|E

25|$|Patient {{focus in}} the {{curriculum}} begins on day one, {{in the introduction to}} being a physician course. Students interview patients about their experience of illness and experiences with their physicians, and they visit community settings to develop an understanding of their roles as medical professionals. Medical interviewing and physical examination courses <b>follow,</b> <b>along</b> with exercises examining the many facets of physician life—in society, ethical settings, and at the patient bedside. Throughout the first two years, students apply their new skills in local practices and hospitals one afternoon per week. The basic science block runs through three-fourths of the first year and provides language and concepts that underlie the scientific basis of medical practice. Organ system block courses integrate physiology, pathophysiology, pharmacology, and patient with concurrent courses in the patient care and patient, physician and society blocks. Weekly discussions, patient interviews, and examination of hospitalized patients reinforce essential clinical skills.|$|E
25|$|In {{electron}} beam lithography (EBL), an electron-sensitive resist is exposed to a beam of high-energy electrons. There is {{the choice of a}} positive or negative type resist; however, lower feature resolution can be obtained with negative resists. Patterns are created by programming the beam of electrons for the exact path to <b>follow</b> <b>along</b> the surface of the material. Resolution is affected by other factors such as electron scattering in the resist and backscattering from the substrate. EBL can create single surface features on the order of 3–5nm. If multiple features are required over a large surface area, {{as is the case in}} tissue engineering, the resolution drops and features can only be created as small as 30–40nm, and the resist development begins to weigh more heavily on pattern formation. To prevent dissolution of the resist, ultrasonic agitation can be used to overcome intermolecular forces. In addition, isopropyl alcohol (IPA) helps develop high-density arrays. EBL can become a quicker and less costly process by replicating nanometer patters in polymeric materials; the replication process has been demonstrated with polycaprolactone (PCL) using hot embossing and solvent casting. In a study conducted by Gomez et al. (2007), microchannels 1 and 2µm wide and 400 and 800nm deep created by EBL on PDMS were shown to enhance axon formation of hippocampal cells in culture more so than immobilized chemical cues.|$|E
25|$|The WSC has {{a unique}} {{structure}} as it flows poleward off the western coast of Spitsbergen. It is easiest to discuss horizontal movements and vertical movements of the WSC, separately. The WSC begins its movement in the Norwegian Sea where it branches off the Norwegian Atlantic Current and arrives at Spitsbergen's western coast, where it is guided by the bathymetric profile of the ocean floor surrounding Svalbard. Specifically, it tends to <b>follow</b> <b>along</b> steep continental shelves. The current is quite narrow and strong, having a width of roughly 100 kilometers and a maximum speed of 35cm/s. At about 80° North latitude the WSC splits into two different sections, the Svalbard branch and the Yermak Branch. The Svalbard Branch continues to follow the continental shelf northeastward, and eventually sinks to an intermediate depth and is cyclonically recirculated throughout the Arctic, eventually being pushed out through the East Greenland Current. The Yermak Branch moves northwesterly till about 81°N, and then it moves directly westward and eventually equatorward in the Return Atlantic Current. The Return Atlantic Current is directly east of the East Greenland Current. The high salinity and warm temperatures of the Return Atlantic Current compared to the cold temperatures and low salinities of the EGC contribute {{to the existence of}} the East Greenland Polar Front a result of the strong gradient in both salinity and temperature. There is a current that splits off from the Yermak Branch and flows towards the Northeast at a higher latitude. This current is not well understood in the literature, and thus more information is needed. It is believed this current loops back into the Svalbard Branch further along in its track eastward.|$|E
