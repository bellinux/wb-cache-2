25|$|Chemical buffer stabilizes the pH {{value to}} the desired value within the gel itself and in the {{electrophoresis}} buffer. The choice of buffer also affects the electrophoretic mobility of the buffer counterions and thereby {{the resolution of the}} gel. The buffer should also be unreactive and not modify or react with most proteins. Different buffers may be used as cathode and anode buffers, respectively, depending on the application. Multiple pH values may be used within a single gel, for example in DISC electrophoresis. Common buffers <b>in</b> <b>PAGE</b> include Tris, Bis-Tris, or imidazole.|$|E

Wilder shot and stabbed Bonaventura to death around March 31 near the Kanab River in Utah, but her body was not found until May 3. Wilder also killed 17-year-old Michelle Korfman, an aspiring model, who disappeared from a Seventeen magazine cover model competition at the Meadows Mall in Las Vegas on April 1. A photograph was taken of Wilder stalking her at the competition. Her body remained undiscovered near a southern California roadside rest stop until May 11, and was not identified until mid-June via dental X-rays.|$|E

500|$|With around 1600 {{pages in}} {{manuscript}} length, A Dance with Dragons was eventually published in July 2011 {{after six years}} of writing, longer <b>in</b> <b>page</b> count and writing time than any of the preceding four novels. The story of A Dance with Dragons catches up and goes beyond A Feast for Crows around two-thirds into the book, but nevertheless covers less story than Martin had intended, omitting at least one planned large battle sequence and leaving several character threads ending in cliff-hangers. Martin attributed the delay mainly to his untangling [...] "the Meereenese knot", which the interviewer understood as [...] "making the chronology and characters mesh up as various threads converged on [...] ". Martin also acknowledged spending too much time on rewriting and perfecting the story, but soundly rejected the theories of some of his critics that he had lost interest in the series or would bide his time to make more money.|$|E
500|$|The {{incident}} of the unwelcome band playing outside Marlinspike Hall, called the [...] "Marlinspike Prize Band" [...] (Harmonie de Moulinsart {{in the original}} French version), {{was based on a}} similar experience of Hergé's who was also obliged to serve a band with drinks. To add insult to injury, they gave a toast to [...] "Spirou", the cartoon character created by Robert Velter. Another influence for the band was a cutting of [...] "L'Orpheon France" [...] band. Whenever Castafiore fears her jewels her stolen, her expressions, which involve placing her hands on her face, were influenced by a photograph of her model in real life, Maria Callas, taken by Cecil Beaton in 1957. <b>In</b> <b>page</b> 43 of the book, Tintin is shown reading Robert Louis Stevenson's novel Treasure Island (1883), which was also one of Hergé's favourite books. The depiction of the Romani wagons and clothing was closely modelled on photographs of Romani communities that Hergé had consulted, and he depicted members of the group engaged in basket weaving and fortune telling after reading that the Romani engaged in such activities in the Oxford English Dictionary.|$|E

[...] Pornographic film director Mike Metropolis made three films based on whale tails — Whale Tail (2005), Whale Tail I (2005) and Whale Tail II (2006) — with Mark Ashley in the lead. Another movie titled Whale Tail: Thong Dreams was released in 2005 featuring Sunny Lane and Kirsten Price. In 2003, web content developer Gavin Hamilton created the site whale-tail.com with content featuring whale tail display. Since then the domain has commanded a fair fetching price. The website has been quoted by ABC Radio, NY Times, FHM (UK) and Fuel Magazine (Australia), and has been nominated as a Best Adult Web Site by Australian Adult Industry Awards in 2008.|$|E
