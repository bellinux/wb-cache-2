5|$|When Chuck returns, he and Ellie {{tell each}} other the truth, with Ellie {{revealing}} that she is still investigating her father's research, and Chuck revealing that {{he is still a}} CIA agent. Chuck then brings Ellie to Castle and demonstrates martial arts skills from the <b>Intersect.</b> When Chuck claims to be Agent X, the first human <b>Intersect,</b> Ellie informs him that, according to the laptop, someone had originally uploaded the <b>Intersect</b> to their brain before Chuck's birth. After Chuck repairs the computer, they find a redacted file on British scientist Hartley Winterbottom.|$|E
5|$|Any initial two {{disjoint}} given circles can {{be rendered}} concentric as follows. The radical {{axis of the}} two given circles is constructed; choosing two arbitrary points P and Q on this radical axis, two circles can be constructed that are centered on P and Q and that <b>intersect</b> the two given circles orthogonally. These two constructed circles <b>intersect</b> each other in two points. Inversion in one such intersection point F renders the constructed circles into straight lines emanating from F and the two given circles into concentric circles, with the third given circle becoming another circle (in general). This follows because the system of circles is equivalent {{to a set of}} Apollonian circles, forming a bipolar coordinate system.|$|E

5|$|During the Ohio Constitutional Convention in 1802, {{the delegates}} {{allegedly}} received reports from a fur trapper that Lake Michigan extended significantly farther south than {{had previously been}} believed (or mapped). Thus, {{it was possible that}} an eastâ€“west line extending east from Lake Michigan's southern tip might <b>intersect</b> Lake Erie somewhere east of Maumee Bay, or worse, might not <b>intersect</b> the lake at all; the farther south that Lake Michigan actually extended, the more land Ohio would lose, perhaps even the entire Lake Erie shoreline west of Pennsylvania.|$|E
5|$|Paralleling Cazenovia Creek, NY16, NY78 and CR572 <b>intersect</b> {{with the}} {{southern}} terminus of CR95 (Pound Road). The route remains a two-lane residential road for a distance, soon bending further northwestward {{into the town}} of West Seneca. In West Seneca, the three routes <b>intersect</b> with US20 (Transit Road). At this intersection, NY78 turns north onto a concurrency with US20 while NY16 proceeds northwest along CR215. This junction serves as the northern terminus of CR572. Now concurrent with US20, NY78 runs north along Transit Road as a four-lane commercial boulevard, quickly entering a cloverleaf interchange with NY400 (the Aurora Expressway) once again.|$|E

40|$|Detecting <b>intersecting</b> {{surfaces}} and computing their intersection curves {{is one of}} the fundamental problems in solid modeling algebra. This paper introduces a new strategy to classify surfaces against their intersection status, where exact geometric entities are replaced by fuzzy geometric ones. <b>Intersecting</b> surfaces are thus replaced by fuzzy <b>intersecting</b> faces and a fuzzy intersection algorithm provides a three-state classification of surfaces couples: certainly <b>intersecting,</b> certainly non <b>intersecting</b> and potentially <b>intersecting.</b> In case of certainly <b>intersecting</b> surface couples the fuzzy intersection algorithm provides also starting points to march along the intersection curve, which turns most of the potentially <b>intersecting</b> couples in certainly <b>intersecting</b> ones. The remaining potential intersections are then subdivided to refine their status. Statistic shows the efficiency of this global strategy. 1 Introduction The use of free form surfaces in solids modeling changes the way [...] ...|$|R

Stephen Bartowski created the original <b>Intersect</b> prototype and first used it on Hartley, which was updated with the personality, knowledge and identity of Volkoff, a manufactured identity. However, the <b>Intersect</b> was so unstable that it plagued Hartley's mind and deleting his personality as Hartley Winterbottom, instead he started {{to believe that he}} was Alexei Volkoff, an international arms dealer, and as such he established the Volkoff Industries and became an international terrorist and gun manufacturer.|$|E

At this point, it is revealed that Ned is far more competent than the hostages were led to believe, having intentionally shot Casey in the foot and separated Chuck from his handlers. Mauser threatens to shoot the hostages if Chuck does not reveal where Bryce Larkin and the government database the <b>Intersect</b> are. Chuck reveals to Mauser that the <b>Intersect</b> has been uploaded to his brain.|$|E

From the downtown area to DeWitt, NY5 is divided. At the Syracuseâ€“DeWitt boundary, NY5 intersects NY635 and eastward, it curves to a southeast course.
