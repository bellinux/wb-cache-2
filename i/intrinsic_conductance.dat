40|$|Neurons often receive massive {{concurrent}} {{bombardment of}} synaptic inhibition and excitation during functional network activity. This increases membrane conductance and causes fluctuations in membrane potential (Vm) and spike timing. The conductance increase is commonly attributed to synaptic conductance, but {{also includes the}} intrinsic conductances recruited during network activity. These two sources of conductance have contrasting dynamic properties at subthreshold membrane potentials. Synaptic transmitter gated conductance changes abruptly and briefly with each presynaptic action potential. If the spikes arrive at random times the changes in synaptic conductance are therefore stochastic and rapid during intense network activity. In comparison, subthreshold intrinsic conductances vary smoothly in time. In the present study this discrepancy is investigated using two conductance-based models: a 1 -compartment model and a 2 -compartment with realistic slow intrinsic conductances. We {{examine the effects of}} varying the relative contributions of non-fluctuating <b>intrinsic</b> <b>conductance</b> with fluctuating concurrent inhibitory and excitatory synaptic conductance. For given levels of correlation in the synaptic input we find that the magnitude of the membrane fluctuations uniquely determines the relative contribution of synaptic and <b>intrinsic</b> <b>conductance.</b> We also quantify how Vm-fluctuations vary with synaptic correlations for fixed ratios of synaptic and <b>intrinsic</b> <b>conductance.</b> Interestingly, the levels of Vm-fluctuations and conductance observed experimentally during functional network activity leave little room for <b>intrinsic</b> <b>conductance</b> to contribute. Even without intrinsic conductances the variance in Vm-fluctuations can only be explained by a high degree of correlated firing among presynaptic neurons...|$|E

40|$|Intrinsic {{electrophysiological}} properties {{arising from}} specific combinations of voltage-gated channels are fundamental {{for the performance}} of small neural networks in invertebrates, but their role in large-scale vertebrate circuits remains controversial. Although spinal neurons have complex intrinsic properties, some tasks produce high-conductance states that override <b>intrinsic</b> <b>conductances,</b> minimizing their contribution to network function. Because the detection and coding of somato-sensory information at early stages probably involves {{a relatively small number of}} neurons, we speculated that intrinsic electrophysiological properties are likely involved in the processing of sensory inputs by dorsal horn neurons (DHN). To test this idea, we took advantage of an integrated spinal cord–hindlimbs preparation from turtles allowing the combination of patch-clamp recordings of DHN embedded in an intact network, with accurate control of the extracellular milieu. We found that plateau potentials and low threshold spikes (LTS) -mediated by L- and T-type Ca 2 + channels, respectively- generated complex dynamics by interacting with naturally evoked synaptic potentials. Inhibitory receptive fields could be changed in sign by activation of the LTS. On the other hand, the plateau potential transformed sensory signals in the time domain by generating persistent activity triggered on and off by brief sensory inputs and windup of the response to repetitive sensory stimulation. Our findings suggest that intrinsic properties dynamically shape sensory inputs and thus represent a major building block for sensory processing by DHN. <b>Intrinsic</b> <b>conductances</b> in DHN appear to provide a mechanism for plastic phenomena such as dynamic receptive fields and sensitization to pain...|$|R

Murakami et al. recently showed that a model {{based on the work of}} Traub et al. provides a quantitatively accurate account of the basic features of three types of empirical data (magnetic fields outside the slice, extracellular field potentials within the slice and intracellular potentials within the pyramidal neurons) elicited by stimulations of the soma and apical dendrites. This model was used in the present study to compute the net current dipole moment (Q) due to each of the different voltage- and ligand-gated channels in the cells in the presence of fast GABAA inhibition. These values of Q are proportional to the magnetic field and electrical potential far away from the slice. The <b>intrinsic</b> <b>conductances</b> were found to be more important than the synaptic conductances in determining the shape and magnitude of Q. Among the <b>intrinsic</b> <b>conductances,</b> the sodium (gNa) and delayed-rectifier potassium (gK(DR)) channels were found to produce sharp spikes. The high-threshold calcium channel (gCa) and C-type potassium channel (gK(C)) primarily determined the overall current waveforms. The roles of gCa and gK(C) were independent of small perturbations in these channel densities in the apical and basal dendrites.

Here, we study the transient conductance of such a wire: a finite voltage bias is suddenly applied across the wire and we measure the current before it has enough time to reach its stationary value. These calculations allow us to extract the Sharvin (contact) resistance of Luttinger and Fermi liquids. In particular, we find that a perfect junction between a Fermi liquid electrode and a Luttinger liquid electrode is characterized by a contact resistance that consists of half the quantum of conductance in series with half the intrinsic resistance of an infinite Luttinger liquid. These results were obtained using two different methods: a dynamical Hartree-Fock approach and a self-consistent Boltzmann approach.

We first demonstrated superior low- and high-field transport in heterostructures of chemical vapor deposited graphene and hexagonal boron nitride, presenting a scalable methodology for high-quality graphene device integration. To investigate IC-relevance, we introduced a set of novel patterning techniques used to fabricate freestanding GNR devices to widths as small as 0. 7 nm, concurrent with simultaneous high-resolution imaging and electrical transport characterization, all conducted within an aberration-corrected transmission electron microscope. We found that sub- 10 nm GNRs were inherently disordered and semi-amorphous immediately after patterning. Current-induced Joule heat motivated the structural recrystallization process, resulting in faceted, highly crystalline GNRs with atomically sharp edges. <b>Intrinsic</b> <b>conductance</b> doubled to roughly 2. 7 e 2 /h after the recrystallization process, where e is the electron charge and h is Plank 2 ̆ 7 s constant, despite an almost three times reduction in device width, attributed in part to the enhanced carrier transport from the higher structural crystallinity.

40|$|In {{order to}} {{identify}} and understand mechanistically the cortical circuitry of sensory information processing estimates are needed of synaptic input fields that drive neurons. From intracellular in vivo recordings one would like to estimate net synaptic conductance time courses for excitation and inhibition, gE(t) and gI(t), during time-varying stimulus presentations. However, the <b>intrinsic</b> <b>conductance</b> transients associated with neuronal spiking can confound such estimates, and thereby jeopardize functional interpretations. Here, using a conductance-based pyramidal neuron model we illustrate errors in estimates when the influence of spike generating conductances are not reduced or avoided. A typical estimation procedure involves approximating the current-voltage relation {{at each time point}} during repeated stimuli. The repeated presentations are done in a few sets, each with a different steady bias current. From the trial-averaged smoothed membrane potential one estimates total membrane conductance and then dissects out estimates for gE(t) and gI(t).

Other weak acids (acetic, lactic, oxalic) produce a similar, but smaller increase. Formic acid (and other weak acids) also blocks the K+ conductance at pH 3. 75, {{but not at}} pH 6. 0 when the anion form predominates. This increased H+ conductance and K+ block {{can be explained by}} formic acid (HF) binding to the mouth of the gramicidin channel (Km = 1 M) and providing a source of H+ ions. A kinetic model is derived, based on the equilibrium binding of formic acid to the channel mouth, that quantitatively predicts the conductance for different mixtures of H+, K+, and formic acid. The binding of the neutral formic acid to the mouth of the gramicidin channel is directly supported by the observation that a neutral molecule with a similar structure, formamide (and malonamide and acrylamide), blocks the K+ conductance at pH 6. 0. The H+ conductance in the presence of formic acid provides a lower bound for the <b>intrinsic</b> <b>conductance</b> of the gramicidin channel when there is no diffusion limitation at the channel mouth. The 12 -fold increase in conductance produced by formic acid suggests that greater than 90 % of the total resistance to H+ results from diffusion limitation in the bulk solution...|$|E

One <b>intrinsic</b> <b>conductance</b> implicated in the genesis of thalamic oscillations is the H-current — a cationic current activated by membrane hyperpolarization. Activation of H-current promotes rebound excitation of thalamic relay neurons and can thus enhance recurrent network activity. We {{examined the effects of}} H-current modulation on bicuculline-enhanced network oscillations (2 – 4 Hz) in rat thalamic slices. The adrenergic agonist norepinephrine, a known regulator of H-current, caused an alteration of the internal structure of the oscillations — they were enhanced and accelerated as the interval between bursts was shortened. The acceleration was blocked by the -adrenergic antagonist propranolol. The -agonist isoproterenol mimicked the effect of norepinephrine on oscillation frequency and truncated the responses suggesting that a -adrenergic up-regulation of H-current modifies the internal structure (frequency) of thalamic oscillations. Consistent with this, we found that H-channel blockade by Cs+ or ZD 7288 could decelerate the oscillations and produce more robust (longer lasting) responses. High concentrations of either Cs+ or ZD 7288 blocked the oscillations. These results indicate that a critical amount of H-current is necessary for optimal intrathalamic oscillations in the delta frequency range. Up- or down-regulation of H-current alter not only the oscillation frequency but also retard or promote the development of thalamic synchronous oscillations. This conclusion has important implications regarding the development of epilepsy in thalamocortical circuits...|$|E

Our experimental device measured the conical conductance by a dynamic method. In order to do this, it was necessary to determine the surface pressure distribution. The extension of the Oatley method, with the addition of several components of various transmission probabilities, permits one to establish this distribution for a vacuum system and thus to give the pressure measured by a gauge situated along the wall of the duct.

As such, the overall regulation of the intrinsic excitability of a neuron directly determines the output of that neuron at a given point in time, giving the cell a unique “functional identity. ” To maintain this distinct functional output, neurons must adapt to changing patterns of synaptic excitation. These adaptations are essential to prevent neurons from either falling silent as synaptic excitation falls or becoming saturated as excitation increases. In the absence of stabilizing mechanisms, activity-dependent plasticity could drive neural activity to saturation or quiescence.

Especially, a notable sign {{changes can be}} achieved by adjusting the characteristic length of the Rashba coupling and hole density at moderate magnetic fields. This sign issue may be easily realized in experiments. The oscillations of the <b>intrinsic</b> spin Hall <b>conductance</b> as a function of 1 /$B$ is nothing else but Shubnikov-de Haas oscillations, and the additional beatings can be quantitatively related to the value of the spin-orbit coupling parameter. The Zeeman splitting is too small to introduce effective degeneracy between different Landau levels in a two-dimensional hole gas, and the resonant <b>intrinsic</b> spin Hall <b>conductance</b> appears in high hole density and strong magnetic field due to the transition between mostly spin-$-{ 1 / 2 }$ holes and spin- 3 / 2 holes is confirmed. Two likely ways to establish intrinsic spin Hall effect in experiments and a possible application are suggested.

40|$|We {{report on}} <b>intrinsic</b> {{time-dependent}} <b>conductance</b> fluctuations observed in mesoscopic AuFe spin glass wires. These dynamical fluctuations have a 1 /f-like spectrum and appear below the measured spin glass freezing temperature of our samples. The {{dependence of the}} fluctuation amplitude on temperature, magnetic field, voltage and Fe concentration allows a consistent interpretation in terms of quantum interference effects which {{are sensitive to the}} slowly fluctuating spin configuration.
