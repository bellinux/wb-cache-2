5|$|George Pickingill (c. 1816 – 10 April 1909) was an English farm {{labourer}} who {{lived and worked}} in the village of Canewdon in the eastern English county of Essex. Widely considered to be a cunning man, or vocational folk magician, he reportedly employed magical means to offer cures for ailments and to locate lost property, although was also alleged to <b>have</b> <b>threatened</b> to place curses on people.|$|E
5|$|Among its {{weaknesses}} {{were the}} positioning of its gatehouse, {{on the wrong}} side of the castle, facing away from the road, and the huge windows in the hall, reaching down to the ground and making access relatively easy to any intruder. Indeed, this vulnerability may have been intentional - its builder Laurence was a newly moneyed member of the upper class, and he may not have wanted to erect a fortification that would <b>have</b> <b>threatened</b> the established Marcher Lords in the region.|$|E
5|$|Since {{birds are}} highly visible and common animals, humans {{have had a}} {{relationship}} with them since the dawn of man. Sometimes, these relationships are mutualistic, like the cooperative honey-gathering among honeyguides and African peoples such as the Borana. Other times, they may be commensal, as when species such as the house sparrow have benefited from human activities. Several bird species have become commercially significant agricultural pests, and some pose an aviation hazard. Human activities can also be detrimental, and <b>have</b> <b>threatened</b> numerous bird species with extinction (hunting, avian lead poisoning, pesticides, roadkill, wind turbine kills and predation by pet cats and dogs are common sources of death for birds).|$|E

5|$|The close {{relations}} with Byzantium, however, {{did not help}} Prince Vladimir. Samuel attacked Duklja in 1009 or 1010, {{as part of his}} campaign aimed at breaking up that pro-Byzantine bloc, which could <b>have</b> <b>threatened</b> him. Vladimir retreated with his army and many of his people to his fortress on a hill named Oblik, close to the southeastern tip of Lake Skadar. According to the Chronicle of the Priest of Duklja, he performed a miracle there: the hill was infested with venomous snakes, but when he offered up a prayer to the Lord, their bites became harmless.|$|E
5|$|For the Brazilian Empire, expansionist {{plans on}} the part of powerful, republican Argentina {{represented}} an existential threat. It also signified a threat to Brazilian hegemony across its southern borders. A successful Argentine bid to incorporate Paraguay and Uruguay into a reconstituted Viceroyalty of the Río de la Plata (and control of the Platine river network consequently passing into entirely hostile hands) would <b>have</b> <b>threatened</b> to cut communication between the Brazilian province of Mato Grosso and Rio de Janeiro. With river transportation denied, the alternative land routes would require months of travel instead of days. Nor was Brazil keen to share a direct border with Argentina, fearing an increased vulnerability to an invasion by Rosas.|$|E
5|$|He {{launched}} three subsequent attacks—Operations , Easy and Bison—to {{capture the}} Naushera, Jhangar, Poonch, Zoji La, Dras, and Kargil areas. Plans were laid {{to drive out}} the Pakistani forces from Kashmir completely, but they were stopped by {{the intervention of the}} United States. On 6 July 1948, the Army HQ issued strict instructions against conducting any major operations without its permission. Cariappa protested against this, stating that this policy would threaten Leh, Kargil, and ultimately the Kashmir Valley, which would put the country's security at stake. Though Cariappa asked for two brigades to continue offensive strikes, he was provided only one and permitted to advance to Kargil. He disobeyed orders and launched strikes in the Ladakh area allowing India to assert control over the region. Cariappa continued several operations and offensive strikes against the Pakistanis which involved high risk. Failure of any of them might <b>have</b> <b>threatened</b> the Indian forces. He was subsequently appointed to the supreme post of commander-in-chief.|$|E

5|$|In 1843 Hogg {{became the}} target of a {{blackmail}} attempt by John Edward Johnson, Jane's husband. Johnson provided journalist Barnard Gregory with the details of Jane's marital status. Gregory soon published a report on her in The Satirist, but made a crucial mistake. Gregory claimed that the wife of James Hogg, a Member of Parliament for Beverly, was legally married to another man, prompting James Hogg to initiate a libel suit against Gregory. Johnson quickly disappeared after he learned of the error. Gregory was convicted of libel and served a brief prison sentence. Following his release he prepared a correction that he intended for publication, which could <b>have</b> <b>threatened</b> Hogg's legal position. Hogg appealed to Leigh Hunt, who convinced Gregory not to publish. John Edward Johnson died in 1840, ensuring that Jane would never be blackmailed because of her marital status. Although Hogg and Jane were now free to marry they chose not to, to avoid revealing their situation.|$|E
5|$|The {{first of}} two {{hurricane}} landfalls, Hurricane Valerie, struck northwestern Mexico in June. The other, Hurricane Doreen, hit further {{to the north of}} Valerie in October. The most impacting storm of the season was Tropical Storm Claudia, after its remnants dropped heavy rainfall in portions of Arizona. The rainfall left damaging flooding across rivers and towns. No people were killed, but damage totaled to $11 million (1962 USD). Moreover, Tropical Storm Bernie also made landfall along the Baja California peninsula, later providing rain to Arizona. An unusually high number of storms threatened the Palmyra Atoll, where only 1% of known Pacific tropical cyclones <b>have</b> <b>threatened.</b> In all, a total of 16 storms were observed, which was above average though only two (Valerie and Doreen) reached hurricane intensity.|$|E
5|$|Treviño Morales {{reportedly}} coordinated several violent attacks throughout Mexico, {{including the}} murder of 72 migrants in 2010 and the massacre of 193 people a year later in San Fernando, Tamaulipas. He is also believed to <b>have</b> <b>threatened</b> to shoot down {{the plane of the}} former President Felipe Calderón in August 2012 while on a trip to the state of Tamaulipas. Although it {{was not the first time}} Calderón received death threats from organized crime, the authorities deemed the drug lord's threat as credible, and urged the President to cancel his trip (though he ultimately went anyway). Under Treviño Morales' leadership, Los Zetas were considered by the Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) to be highly sophisticated, advanced, and one of the most dangerous criminal organizations operating in Mexico and the hemisphere. He was widely regarded as one of the most violent drug lords operating in Mexico.|$|E

5|$|While the {{domestic}} horse and donkey (along with their feral descendants) exist worldwide, wild equine populations {{are limited to}} Africa and Asia. Wild equine social systems come in two forms; a harem system with tight-knit groups consisting of one adult male or stallion, several females or mares and their young or foals; and a territorial system where males establish territories with resources that attract females, which associate very fluidly. In both systems, females {{take care of their}} offspring but males may play a role as well. Equines communicate with each other both visually and vocally. Human activities <b>have</b> <b>threatened</b> wild equine populations and out of the seven living species, only the plains zebra remains widespread and abundant.|$|E
5|$|After King Inge's {{death in}} 1217, a dispute erupted over {{who was to}} become his successor. In {{addition}} to Haakon who gained {{the support of the}} majority of the birkebeiners including the veterans who had served under his father and grandfather, candidates included Inge's illegitimate son Guttorm (who dropped out very soon), Inge's half-brother Earl Skule Bårdsson who had been appointed leader of the king's hird at Inge's deathbed and was supported by the Archbishop of Nidaros as well as part of the birkebeiners, and Haakon the Crazy's son Knut Haakonsson. With his widespread popular support in Trøndelag and in Western Norway, Haakon was proclaimed king at Øyrating in June 1217. He was later the same year hailed as king at Gulating in Bergen, and at Haugating, Borgarting and local things east of Elven (Göta Älv). While Skule's supporters initially had attempted to cast doubt about Haakon's royal ancestry, they eventually suspended open resistance to his candidacy. As the dispute could <b>have</b> <b>threatened</b> to split the birkebeiners in two, Skule settled on becoming regent for Haakon during his minority.|$|E
5|$|As Gladys {{strengthened}} in the Atlantic Ocean, forecasters at the United State Weather Bureau {{predicted that}} the storm would bring high surf to areas {{as far north as}} North Carolina. Additionally, it was suggested that Gladys could <b>have</b> <b>threatened</b> northern Florida, as the storm was on a similar path as Hurricane Dora. As a result, residents along the coast of the Southeastern United States were advised to remain alert and small craft advisories were issued. On September20, small craft advisories were issued for The Bahamas. After Gladys turned northwestward on September21, forecasters at the United State Weather Bureau issued hurricane watches for North Carolina, Virginia, and some Mid-Atlantic states. Gale warnings and small craft advisories were issued on September23 from Massachusetts to Rhode Island. In Rhode Island, ships of the United States Navy were diverted to Narragansett Bay as a precaution. At 0400UTC on September24, the gale warnings for New England were lowered as Gladys turned northeastward away from the coast however, small water craft were advised to remain in port until the seas subsided.|$|E

5|$|Despite Kỳ and Đức's media event, it {{appeared}} that Phát and Ton were remaining defiant after returning to the latter's 7th Division's headquarters in Mỹ Tho. Ton was apparently still maintaining a hostile political stance, and threatening {{to break away from}} the Saigon regime by overseeing the area around Mỹ Tho as a virtual independent state. Ton was reported to <b>have</b> <b>threatened</b> to cut the main highway from Saigon into Mỹ Tho and further south into the rest of the Mekong Delta, although it was thought he had no intention or means of assaulting Saigon militarily. Kỳ said a helicopter had been sent to arrest Ton but that a stand-off had developed. However, on September 16 Khánh had the plotters taken into custody. Đức, the rebel tank commander Nghia, Ton, and Lam were all arrested, followed by Phát, who returned to Saigon to turn himself in. A trial was then scheduled. Khánh removed three of the four corps commanders and six of the nine division commanders for failing to move against Phát and Đức.|$|E
