40|$|This paper {{derives from}} our joint {{interest}} in understanding how scientific mobility affects developing countries. Many authors {{have addressed the}} topic previously, both from an economic and from a sociological perspective. However, recent literature evinces dissatisfaction with both analytical frameworks and the framing of public policies addressing the brain drain problematic. This paper is a {{contribution to understanding the}} historical and theoretical foundations of the >brain drain> debate. We aim to improve conceptual clarity regarding the itinerancy of human beings and the mobilization of human capital. We <b>develop</b> <b>a</b> <b>critical</b> <b>review</b> of the economics of the brain drain, highlighting the work of some key early thinkers and pointing out the way in which subsequent work has taken up selected aspects of their approaches leaving other challenges aside. We then consider the diaspora networks literature, which is characterized as taking a >connectionist> approach to the brain drain. We identify two fundamental problems: the sidelining of complementarity and context dependency as basic properties of human capital; and a failure to adequately disentangle the concepts of human resources for science and technology (HRST) and human capital in academic and policy discourse about the brain drain. The authors were grateful recipients of funding from the International Science Linkages Program of the Academy of the Social Sciences in Australia and the Australian Department of Industry, Science and Research, which directly sup- ported this work.

40|$|International audienceA {{central issue}} of human-animal {{interactions}} has been, and continues, to be mainly {{focused on the}} emotional and positive aspects that fixe the imagination of both public and researchers. It is particularly highlighted {{in the use of}} animals in therapeutic situations that involved ‘weaker’ people. After a historical report and a clarification of the term ‘animal assisted therapy’, we propose to <b>develop</b> <b>a</b> <b>critical</b> <b>review</b> of these particular therapies using horses as well as other species (i. e. dog, dolphin). It is firstly required to establish why animals are widely considered as potential therapists. We examine the theoretical framework included the relaxing effect and the social substitute status that animals can have, as well as the simple non verbal interactions between human and animal developed. We secondly describe several empirical researches to illustrate the heterogeneity (e. g. people, animal used) as well as the weakness of these studies (e. g. methodological devices, subjectivity, case studies) with a focused on autistic disorders. Thus, clear scientific evidence is still lacking and a need arises to better understand the relations between people and animals especially in a reproducible therapeutic ways. A project is currently led by different scientific teams to explore finely the relations between children, both with typical and autistic development- and animals, according to different contexts. We here present some results that reveal, on the one hand, the importance of owning a pet in the development of children with autism. On the other hand, the practice of horse riding is explored both in a typical practice in an equestrian club and in a therapeutic way. The results show an impact on children behaviors with unfamiliar animals. Other results are also discussed in the light of animal assisted therapies, providing us some ways of thinking about methodology and studies in research and the applications of animals in assisted therapies...|$|E
40|$|The {{value of}} {{multiple}} informant methodology {{for improving the}} validity in determining organizational properties has been increasingly recognized. However, the majority of empirical research still relies on single (key) informants. This {{is partly due to}} the lack of comprehensive methodological narratives and precise recommendations on the application of this impor-tant methodology. Therefore, the authors have <b>developed</b> <b>a</b> <b>critical</b> <b>review</b> and derived clear recommendations for the key challenges that researchers face in using multiple informants: (1) Which and how many informants should be considered? (2) How should the consensus among the informants be judged? (3) How are multiple responses combined into a single, organi-zational response to conduct further data analyses...|$|R
40|$|Although economies, {{business}} practices, {{and living}} standards have converged since WWII, corporate structures continue to differ among the advanced {{economies of the}} world. Looking at the diversity of corporate structures of large-sized firms around the world (and over time) would fascinate Charles Darwin. This work <b>develops</b> <b>a</b> <b>critical</b> <b>review</b> {{of the literature on}} political determinants of corporate governance through the Darwinian theory (including some Lamarckian aspects). As Darwin, in his work "On the Origin of Species", explicates the diversity of species of tortoises, finches, and iguanas of the Galapagos Islands, so Darwinism may contribute in understanding the origin and the persistence of corporate diversity. In particular, this article takes into account politics-driven variations, their inheritances, and the subsequent selection of advantageous "corporate" attributes...|$|R
40|$|Over {{the past}} 15 years, MRI lesion {{activity}} {{has become the}} accepted surrogate primary outcome measure in proof-of-concept placebo-controlled clinical trials of new immunomodulating therapies in relapse-onset multiple sclerosis (MS). In parallel, {{the number of patients}} that are available for the placebo arm of trials has declined, and more-aggressive drugs are being <b>developed.</b> <b>A</b> <b>critical</b> <b>review</b> is warranted to ensure efficient MRI - and patient - resource utilization. Recently, an international panel reviewed the methodology for efficient use of MRI-monitored trials in relapse-onset MS. In this article, we provide up-to-date recommendations for scan acquisition, image analysis, outcome-measure definition and standards of reporting. Factors to consider for optimizing trial design, such as outcome measure selection and the unique requirements of phase II and phase III trials, including active-comparator studies, are outlined. Finally, we address safety considerations in the use of MRI in MS trials, and the safety-related responsibilities of the various parties involved in conducting such trials. © 2011 Macmillan Publishers Limited.

40|$|An {{injector}} is {{a particular}} type of jet pump which uses condensable vapor to entrain a liquid and discharge against a pressure higher than either motive or suction pressures. The injector has no moving parts and requires no external power supply nor any complex control system. Thus, the injector is particularly suited for emergency core cooling operations. A detailed survey has indicated that various injector designs are available for operating pressures below 250 psig. However, the design of these injectors from the viewpoint of a basic understanding of heat and mass transfer processes has not been well <b>developed.</b> <b>A</b> <b>critical</b> <b>review</b> of the models showed serious discrepancies between the analytical models and the experimental observations. The discrepancies evolved from the neglect of non-equilibrium aspects of the flow. The origin of the non-equilibrium aspects {{can be traced to the}} extremely small time scales governing the flow in the injector. Thus, time scales of the order of 10 {sup {minus} 2 } seconds are involved in the injector, accompanied by mass, momentum, and heat transfer rates of orders of magnitude higher than that observed in conventional two-phase flows. The present study focuses on the phenomenological and mathematical modeling of the processes in the injector from the viewpoint of its non-equilibrium nature...|$|R
40|$|This article <b>develops</b> <b>a</b> <b>critical</b> <b>review</b> of the hyperspectral {{splitting}} of {{the solar}} reflected radiation acquired by hyperspectral imaging sensors. The bandwidth used {{in the range from}} 2. 0 micrometer to 2. 5 micrometer by many hyperspectral sensors sometimes is too narrow for land cover classification. In fact, hyperspectral imagers often suffer from low signal-to-noise in the shortwave infrared region of the e. m. spectrum, resulting in noisy image collection. This paper presents a new methodological approach to the splitting {{of the solar}} reflected radiation, called “Superspectral approach”. It is based on the principle of increasing the channel bandwidth by increasing the number of wavelengths, to build synthetic spectral bands with higher SNR. The methodology has been applied to the MIVIS (Multispectral Infrared and Visible Imaging Spectrometer) sensor, an airborne hyperspectral scanner used for environmental remote sensing applications in Italy. Interesting results have been achieved in crop classification, processing the Cordenons survey carried out in August 2001 in the north-eastern part of Italy. The Spectral Angle Mapper (SAM) algorithm was used for classification because insensitive to shadows. For accuracy assessment, the overall accuracy (OA) and kappa coefficient (k) were calculated and used in the comparison. Using the Superspectral approach, an increment in the overall accuracy of about 42 % and an increment in the kappa coefficient of about 51 % were obtained in comparison to the classification accuracy of unprocessed original MIVIS data (OA= 41. 21, k= 0. 35). A second case study is presented using the NASA’s experimental hyperspectral imager HYPERION. Data acquired over the lake of Garda (Italy) in October 2002 was processed with the Superspectral approach. Comparing the simulated HYPERION superspectral bands with the original data, SNR improvements are achieved in the SWIR region (from 0. 7 to 54. 2 for 2. 012 micrometer wavelength and from 0. 7 to 64. 5 for 2. 365 micrometer wavelength). The methodology proposed is sensor independent and can be applied to any of the hyperspectral sensors currently available...|$|R
40|$|Abstract Background Novel {{approaches}} are increasingly employed {{to address the}} social determinants of health of children world-wide. Such approaches have included complex social programs involving multiple stakeholders from different sectors jointly working together (hereafter Child Health Partnerships). Previous reviews have questioned whether these programs have led to significant improvements in child health and related outcomes. We aim to provide definitive answers to this question as well as identifying the characteristics of successful partnerships. Methods A comprehensive literature search identified 11 major Child Health Partnerships in four comparable <b>developed</b> countries. <b>A</b> <b>critical</b> <b>review</b> is focused on various aspects of these including their target groups, program mechanics and outcomes. Results and Conclusions There was evidence of success in several major areas from the formation of effective joint operations of partners in different partnership models to improvement in both child wellbeing and parenting. There is emerging evidence that Child Health Partnerships are cost-effective. Population characteristics and local contexts {{need to be taken}} into account in the introduction and implementation of these programs. </p...|$|R
40|$|In Europe, food {{consumption}} {{is responsible for}} approximately 30 % of total greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. There has been huge interest in estimating the carbon footprint (CF) of food products, i. e. {{the total amount of}} GHG emitted during the life cycle of the product, and communicating these to consumers to enable them to make informed choices. This thesis provides additional knowledge of several related issues regarding calculating and acting on the CF of food products in order to facilitate the design of effective consumer communication strategies. The uncertainty in the CF of Swedish potatoes and pasta was established to investigate the detail to which food CF can be determined. For a well-defined geographical area the uncertainty was in the range ± 10 - 30 %, indicating that the CF uncertainty for more complex foods or foods with a more unspecific origin is considerably higher. Emissions of N₂O from soils dominated the emissions and uncertainties, and yield was an influential parameter for all crops. Possible risks of pollution swapping when acting on CF were investigated in the case of meat production. For meat from monogastric animals, in most cases the CF functions as an indicator for land, energy and pesticide use, and for acidification and eutrophication potential, but for ruminant meat there are possible conflicts with biodiversity, energy and pesticide use. In <b>an</b> attempt to <b>develop</b> <b>a</b> tool that communicates the CF of meat in an efficient way, while highlighting important trade-offs, a criteria-based meat guide based on the knowledge gained was <b>developed.</b> <b>A</b> <b>critical</b> <b>review</b> of CF labelling from a consumer perspective showed that obstacles known to prevent purchase of organic foods, e. g. perceived high price and strong habits, apply equally or more so to the purchase of CF labelled foods. Hence, CF labelling of food in a retail setting is of limited effectiveness, but CF values are important in business-to-business communication, in policy development and for developing efficient and scientifically justified consumer communication messages. Quantification of the reduction potential from a commonly recommended option, 'eating seasonal', showed that consuming tomatoes and carrots seasonally in Sweden could reduce the CF by 30 - 60 %. This is a substantial reduction for these products, but a small reduction in view of the total GHG emissions from the complete average diet. This illustrates the importance of calculating CF values of food and setting the results in perspective...|$|R
40|$|IntroductionIn 2014, {{vaccination}} {{was included}} {{within the scope}} of practice for Australian pharmacists. A number of Australian pharmacy schools have either commenced or are planning to incorporate vaccination training into pharmacy curricula. The primary objective {{of this article is to}} articulate the process undertaken to <b>develop</b> <b>an</b> Australian vaccination training program with nested injection skills training for pharmacy students. Material and methodsA set of learning outcomes, assessable knowledge, and assessable skills were <b>developed</b> following <b>a</b> <b>critical</b> <b>review</b> of relevant literature, guided by the Australian Pharmacy Council Standards for the Accreditation of Programs to Support Pharmacist Administration of Vaccines. This ensures that the modules will enable students to demonstrate competency required for vaccination, similar to that of current Australian vaccinators: doctors, nurses, and pharmacists. ResultsA vaccination training program with nested injection skills training was developed and validated. The new teaching and learning concepts will be integrated and delivered via spiral curriculum. Knowledge and skills should progressively improve as students advance through the pharmacy course. Core skills will be assessed on a number of occasions. Integrated modules are embedded into the first year, third year, and fourth year of the pharmacy program.

40|$|Background Happiness is {{a lasting}} state and is {{associated}} with the absence of negative emotions, the presence of positive emotions, life satisfaction, social engagement and objectives in life. Researchers have demonstrated the benefits of happiness in many aspects of life, but few studies have been conducted within psychiatry. Objectives To <b>develop</b> <b>a</b> <b>critical</b> literature <b>review</b> of studies on happiness and health in order to bring some further and useful information to psychiatry updating the article &# 8220;Happiness: a review&# 8221; published in 2007 in Revista de Psiquiatria Clínica. Methods Computational searching was undertaken of digital data basis (PubMed and SciELO) using the keywords &# 8220;happiness&# 8221; and &# 8220;health&# 8221;. One hundred twenty-seven papers published between 2004 and 2014 were found, but only 76 had the keywords in the title or abstract and with this were selected. Results Personality traits, such as self-direction; being married; being involved in physical and leisure activities; higher educational backgrounds and intelligence quotient; religiosity, volunteering and altruism; good physical and mental health; were positively related to happiness. Discussion Analysis of the concept of happiness and its associated emotions may be more complex than describing the symptoms of psychiatric disorders.

40|$|Purpose – This paper aims {{to examine}} the {{institutional}} and social determinants, and consequences of social entrepreneurship with respect to China 2 ̆ 7 s rural enterprises. It also attempts to provide a conceptual framework concerning how rural Chinese enterprises act as social entrepreneurial institutions and contribute to both business development and social welfare of local communities. Design/methodology/approach – The conceptual framework is <b>developed</b> through <b>a</b> <b>critical</b> <b>review</b> of literature and an integration of multiple disciplinary studies, {{with a focus on}} the perspectives of institutional governance, managerial networks, and market orientation. Findings – The study identifies three framework layers for the development of China 2 ̆ 7 s rural enterprises, which are fundamentally driven by market preserving authoritarianism, local state corporatism, community culture, social entrepreneurship and market orientation. Practical implications – The proposed framework can help contribute to the theoretical development of strategic issues of social entrepreneurship in transitional economies. It may also provide insights about local state governance, ownership structures and market competition in China. Originality/value – As China 2 ̆ 7 s rural enterprises are widely regarded as a phenomenon related to the core nature of a “socialist market economy”, an ideology embraced since the beginning of Chinese social‐economic reforms, a study of institutional and entrepreneurial nature of this kind serves as a stepping stone for understanding the emerging phenomenon of the country 2 ̆ 7 s social entrepreneurship, which is characterized by open market mechanisms and socialist legacies...|$|R
40|$|This {{research}} describes {{efforts to}} <b>develop</b> and validate <b>a</b> multidimensional {{measure of the}} learning organization. An instrument was <b>developed</b> based on <b>a</b> <b>critical</b> <b>review</b> of both the conceptualization and practice of this construct. Supporting validity evidence for the instrument was obtained from several sources, including best model-data fit among alternative measurement models, nomological network among dimensions of the learning organization, and organizational performance outcomes. Acceptable reliability estimates were obtained for the seven proposed dimensions. Consequently, the instrument, Dimensions of the Learning Organization Questionnaire, was recommended for use in organizational studies. The concept of the learning organization has received increasing attention {{in the field of}} organizational studies, yet little is known about how to measure it. Despite growing attention to the learning organization, the lack of a theo-retically derived measure of the construct has deterred substantive research in this area. Tsang (1997) observes that most writings in this area tend to be prescriptive and lack systematic and solid empirical research. Learning organization theorists argue that there has been considerable conceptual con-fusion about the nature of learning at the organizational level (Argyris &...|$|R
40|$|Positioning and {{attachment}} of {{an infant}} at the breast for effective feeding prevents common breastfeeding problems such as nipple pain and breast engorgement. Existing tools to assess breastfeeding remain controversial. This paper reports on an observation study of 91 mother-baby dyads who were breastfeeding while in hospital. The 'Postnatal Breastfeeding Observation Tool' (PBOT) records maternal independence to breastfeed effectively prior to discharge from hospital. PBOT items relate to maternal nurturing, positioning, attachment, effective feeding and assistance received. Items were <b>developed</b> from <b>a</b> <b>critical</b> <b>review</b> of the literature, best available evidence, and reviewed by an expert panel of clinical midwives and International Board Certified Lactation Consultants. Validity was established in a pilot study with three midwives who observed seven mothers breastfeed. Intraclass correlation of scores between the three midwives who all observed seven individual mothers breastfeed were high 0. 895 (p < 0. 001). Results confirmed associations between mothers' positioning their baby for attachment to the breast (r = 0. 635, p< 0. 001) and effective breastfeeding (r = 0. 474, p< 0. 001) and between attachment and effective breastfeeding (r = 0. 427, p< 0. 001). The policy and practice implications of the PBOT will be addressed {{in terms of its}} utility (1) as a research tool to enhance best practice; (2) as a practice checklist used by clinicians to support and affirm principles of positioning and attachment while they observe an entire breastfeed; and (3) as a teaching strategy to improve consistency of practice supporting mothers to initiate and maintain breastfeeding.

40|$|Many {{pregnant}} women and women of child-bearing age do not engage in the recommended levels of physical activity despite the well known benefits. Pregnancy and the postpartum period can {{be a time when}} inactivity actually increases. Women who experience gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) during their pregnancy are often advised to become more active in order to ameliorate their increased risk of developing type 2 diabetes. Health professionals have an influential role in promoting physical activity, which would be enhanced with an understanding of the factors that positively and negatively influencewomen’s participation in physical activity during pregnancy and in the postpartum period. This research sought to explore these factors with pregnant and postpartum women including those who had experienced GDM and the attention given to physical activity during pregnancy. Asurvey was <b>developed</b> after <b>a</b> <b>critical</b> <b>review</b> of factors identified from previous studies. Women were recruited from the antenatal clinic, community health centres and the local media. Results from 72 women are reported from a predominately well educated, Caucasian population. Overall, the results were confirmatory of factors previously identified. Lack of child care, time constraints, no time and feeling unwell during pregnancy hindered activity and factors that facilitated activity included family support, enjoyment of activity and to prevent later health problems. It was also found that non-GDM women are given minimal advice about exercise during pregnancy. A checklist has been developed for health professionals, in partnership with women, to direct attention to the factors that enable and hinder participation in physical activity during and after pregnancy...|$|R
40|$|AbstractCorporate Social Responsibility (CSR) {{has become}} an {{important}} strategic policy for organisations. A considerable amount of {{attention has been paid}} to the definition of CSR and yet research on the development of CSR definition has remained limited.

40|$|Extract] To {{evaluate}} {{the quality of}} research {{is one of the}} most challenging steps in review processes, either as part of systematic reviews or peer review. Throughout the last decades, a number of criteria have been discussed and various instruments have been proposed. The critical appraisal tool (CAT) newly developed by Crowe and Sheppard (2011) contributes to this increasing methodological inventory. It was <b>developed</b> based on <b>a</b> <b>critical</b> <b>review</b> of more than 40 CATs and reporting guidelines for different study designs of primary and secondary research (Crowe and Sheppard, 2011 a). Its structure follows that of reporting guidelines. The tool contains eight sections following the study outline, e. g. introduction, design, sample, or findings. Each section is divided into sub-sections containing different descriptors, which focus either on reporting issues or aspects of research conduct and aim to guide the reviewer through the appraisal process. Based on the judgements made for each applicable descriptor, the reviewer has to assign a score between 0 and 5 to each section of the study report. Although the CAT was developed and validated systematically, there are limitations which, in my view, require further discussion...|$|R
40|$|A passive {{investment}} management model was <b>developed</b> via <b>a</b> <b>critical</b> literature <b>review</b> of portfolio methodologies. This model was developed {{based on the}} fundamental models originated by both Markowitz and Sharpe. The passive model was automated via {{the development of a}} computer programme {{that can be used to}} generate the required outputs as suggested by Markowitz and Sharpe. For this computer programme MATLAB is chosen and the model’s logic is designed and validated. The demonstration of the designed programme using securities traded is performed on Johannesburg Securities Exchange. The selected portfolio has been sub-categorised into six components with a total of twenty- seven shares. The shares were grouped into different components due to the investors’ preferences and investment time horizon. The results demonstrate that a test portfolio outperforms a risk- free money market instrument (the government R 194 bond), but not the All Share Index for the period under consideration. This design concludes the reason for this is due in part to the use of the error term from Sharpe’s single index model. An investor following the framework proposed by this design may use this to determine the risk- return relationship for selected portfolios, and hopefully, a real return...|$|R
40|$|The {{level of}} bike-rail {{integration}} (combining cycling with rail) in the UK presents an unrealised sustainable mobility potential: two per cent of rail passengers access the rail network by bicycle, contrasting with 40 per cent in the Netherlands. Cycling {{on its own}} has distance limitations but in combination with rail it can substitute for longer car journeys and is one means of reducing car dependence. The overall objective of this PhD research project was to understand existing bike-rail integration behaviour in the UK, using as the research location two stations in the South West of England (Bristol Temple Meads and Bristol Parkway), to inform the design, {{development and implementation of}} initiatives to increase its incidence. It therefore had two distinct research phases: an exploratory phase and an action research phase. The exploratory phase demonstrated that bike-rail integrators were mainly motivated by saving time or money and taking exercise. The majority were male, in their thirties, in full-time employment and cycled on average 3. 7 km to the station. These data in conjunction with a conceptual „ecological‟ model <b>developed</b> from <b>a</b> <b>critical</b> <b>review</b> of behaviour change theory were used to inform the design and implementation of a pay-as-you-go self-hire cycle network (Hourbike) and an intervention to attract car drivers to switch to rail with either walking or cycling access. In the first year of Hourbike, seven per cent of users had never really cycled before and one per cent of car drivers responded to the opportunity to try rail with walking or cycling access rendering rich qualitative data from non-users about the attractors and barriers to bike-rail integration. The process of incorporating theory into practice is described providing useful insights for future interventions which are discussed in the light of theory. Opportunities are identified {{in the context of the}} national policy to implement station travel plans which emerged in the latter phases of the research.

40|$|Purpose – This paper aims to {{describe}} the roles and values of personal knowledge management (PKM). It seeks to investigate the roles of PKM in the KM process cycle and assess the values for improving the competences of both individuals and organizations. Design/methodology/approach – A research model was <b>developed</b> based on <b>a</b> <b>critical</b> <b>review</b> of KM and the PKM literature, followed by {{a survey of the}} KM participants in KM associations/interest groups/societies. The results and conclusions were made based on the quantitative analysis approach. Findings – The results indicate that PKM is playing important roles in the KM process and both individuals and organizations are benefitting by PKM in improving their competences. The roles of PKM are positively correlated to the values of PKM for individuals and organizations. It is also found that the values of PKM for individuals are correlated to the values of PKM for the organization. Research limitations/implications – This study is intended {{as a starting point for}} exploring the roles and values of PKM. It aims to provide a generalized model of PKM, with further research required for specific contexts. Originality/value – The conceptual model of PKM 2. 0 was developed based on the research findings which provide a better understanding in the area of PKM. This model also sets the foundation for future research and draws the attention of both academics and business executives in this under-explored area. Up to now, there is no PKM framework or model that leverages on the Web 2. 0 concepts. This paper provides the first examination of such aspects.

40|$|Resumo: Este projeto de pesquisa teve como objetivo elaborar uma revisÃ£o crÃ­tica de parte da histÃ³ria das atividades espaciais no Brasil, entre 1940 e 1980, com foco no programa tecnolÃ³gico elaborado no final da dÃ©cada de 70, que tinha como missÃ£o o desenvolvimento de um veÃ­culo lanÃ§ador de satÃ©lites, satÃ©lites e uma base de lanÃ§amento. Com uma abordagem no terreno da CiÃªncia PolÃ­tica, procurou-se apresentar a instituiÃ§Ã£o militar como ator {{principal}} na origem e no desenvolvimento das atividades espaciais, aplicando-se dois conceitos: de autonomia militar, de EliÃ©zer Rizzo de Oliveira, e insulamento burocrÃ¡tico, de Ã‰dson Nunes. O estudo estabeleceu uma relaÃ§Ã£o com o segmento civil das atividades espaciais, bem como uma articulaÃ§Ã£o com a polÃ­tica de Ã¢mbito nacional e internacional, tendo em vista as implicaÃ§Ãµes da tecnologia espacial, de uso dual, com a seguranÃ§a internacional. Apesar de a revisÃ£o histÃ³rica nÃ£o incluir o perÃ­odo de transiÃ§Ã£o para o regime democrÃ¡tico, a dissertaÃ§Ã£o procurou avanÃ§ar um pouco mais, chegando atÃ© o governo Fernando Henrique Cardoso. Esta extrapolaÃ§Ã£o teve como sentido elaborar um contraponto com o intuito de reforÃ§ar alguns aspectos relacionados Ã  perspectiva militar dentro do programa tecnolÃ³gico espacial, e, ao mesmo tempo, sugerir alguns traÃ§os de orientaÃ§Ã£o dados Ã s atividades deste setor pelo governo de Fernando Henrique. Baseado em documentos oficiais e entrevistas com autoridades que tiveram participaÃ§Ã£o ativa na histÃ³ria desta Ã¡rea, a dissertaÃ§Ã£o discorre sobre a origem e o processo de institucionalizaÃ§Ã£o das atividades espaciais. Destaca-se neste histÃ³rico o processo que levou os militares do EMFA a assumir o comando polÃ­tico das atividades espaciais, no inÃ­cio da dÃ©cada de 70, e o perÃ­odo de negociaÃ§Ã£o entre brasileiros e franceses, no final da mesma dÃ©cada, para a elaboraÃ§Ã£o de um programa tecnolÃ³gico conjunto, que nÃ£o foi aprovado para a decepÃ§Ã£o dos militares da AeronÃ¡utica. A opÃ§Ã£o foi a MissÃ£o Espacial Completa Brasileira (MECB), um programa predominantemente nacional, apoiado pelos militares nacionalista. Adicionalmente, a revisÃ£o histÃ³rica buscou identificar os problemas que rondam as atividades espaciais, provocando grandes atrasos no cumprimento de metas. O estudo trabalha com a hipÃ³tese de que, alÃ©m do condicionante de ordem econÃ´mica, o desenvolvimento das atividades espaciais contaria tambÃ©m com o condicionante de ordem polÃ­tica, com problemas localizados na concepÃ§Ã£o do programa tecnolÃ³gico e na conduÃ§Ã£o polÃ­tica das atividades, sob a coordenaÃ§Ã£o dos militares, revelando ainda implicaÃ§Ãµes na Ã¡rea de polÃ­tica externa.

Its mission was to <b>develop</b> <b>a</b> satellite launcher vehicle, satellites, and a launching base. From a political science approach, {{an attempt was made}} to present the military institution as the main agent which originated and developed space activities. Two concepts were apllied: one of military autonomy, by EliÃ©zer Rizzo de Oliveira, and the other of bureaucratic insulation, by Edson Nunes. The study established a relationship with the civil segment of space activities, as well as an articulation with both national and international political field, considering the implications of the dual use of space technology, with international security. Although the historical review does not include the transition period to the democratic regime, this dissertation tried to go further, reaching Fernando Henrique Cardoso government. The objective of this extrapolation was {{to come up with a}} counter-point, aiming at emphasizing some aspects related to a military perspective within the space technological program, and at the same time suggest some orientation features provided by Fernando Henrique Cardoso government to the activities of this sector. Base on official documents and interviews with authorities who had an active role in the history of this area, the dissertation discusses the origin, as well as the institutionalization process of space activities. This historical review highlights the process that led the Brazilian Armed Forces (EMFA) to take over political command of space activities in the early 70 Â´s, and the negotiation period between Brazil and France in the 70 Â´s, to create a joint technological program, which was not approved, to the Air Force military disappointment. The alternative was the Complete Brazilian Space Mission (MECB), a predominantly national program, supported by the nationalist military. Moreover, the historical review attempted to identify space activity problems, which greatly delayed the achievement of goals. This study puts forward a hypothesis that besides economical conditioning, the development of space activities, would also count on the political conditioning, on problems related to the technological program concept and on the handling of the political activities under military coordination, carrying foreign policy implications...|$|R
40|$|Restraints {{constitute}} the unique and necessary aids for {{living and working}} in microgravity conditions in which crewmembers need facilities as support to move around and as restraints while they work. In environments with microgravity, disturbance to the vestibular sense, when it occurs together with conflicting visual and perceptive stimuli, can cause disorientation, vertigo and illusions regarding posture and movement. Therefore, the design of restraints is <b>a</b> <b>critical</b> ingredient of success for crewmembers performance in space during both IVA and EVA activities. Standard restraints and mobility aids are provided on ISS such that all installation, operation, and maintenance can be performed: Foot Restraint, Adjustable Length Tether, Handrails, Adjustable Length Tether and Torso Restraint Assembly. Crewmembers use Standard Foot Restraints and Handrails to improve the movement capacities and the postural stability. They use their feet to hold on Foot Restraint but they also very often grab the Handrails with their feet and, when they do, so their feet hurt. Therefore it is a challenging and complex area of architectural design research. This paper presents a review of the development and evolution of the space laboratories restraints showing and analysing in depth how the design issues have been planned and solved inside the methodology applied to evaluate the design solutions for International Space Station. The space laboratories restraints will be to consider different parameters, keeping in mind the user priorities and effects in space environments. The {{purpose of this paper is}} to <b>develop</b> through <b>a</b> <b>critical</b> design <b>review,</b> <b>a</b> plan integration strategy that defines shapes and typologies for space laboratories restraints and suggests new concept designs to enhance or substitute the present ones...|$|R
40|$|Physical {{inventories}} {{constitute a}} considerable proportion of companies’ investments in today’s competitive environment. The trade-off between customer service levels and inventory investments is addressed in practice by formal quantitative inventory management (stock control) solutions. Given the tremendous number of Stock Keeping Units (SKUs) that contemporary organisations deal with, such solutions {{need to be}} fully automated. However, managers very often judgementally adjust the output of statistical software (such as the demand forecasts and/or the replenishment decisions) to reflect qualitative information that they possess. In this research we {{are concerned with the}} value being added (or not) when statistical/quantitative output is judgementally adjusted by managers. Our work aims to investigate the effects of incorporating human judgement into such inventory related decisions and it is the first study to do so empirically. First, a set of relevant research questions is <b>developed</b> based on <b>a</b> <b>critical</b> <b>review</b> of the literature. Then, an extended database of approximately 1, 800 SKUs from an electronics company is analysed for the purpose of addressing the research questions. In addition to empirical exploratory analysis, a simulation experiment is performed in order to evaluate in a dynamic fashion what are the effects of adjustments on the performance of a stock control system. The results on the simulation experiment reveal that judgementally adjusted replenishment orders may improve inventory performance in terms of reduced inventory investments (costs). However, adjustments do not seem to contribute towards the increase of the cycle service level (CSL) and fill rate. Since there have been no studies addressing similar issues to date, this research should be of considerable value in advancing the current state of knowledge in the area of inventory management. From a practitioner’s perspective, the findings of this research may guide managers in adjusting order-up-to levels for the purpose of achieving better inventory performance. Further, the results may also contribute towards the development of better functionality of inventory support systems (ISS) ...|$|R
40|$|This {{research}} {{grew from}} two frustrations. The {{first was the}} personal frustration experienced when attempting to find information on websites; especially government websites. Often the sites were loaded down {{with all sorts of}} information such as corporate organisation charts and press releases but lacked the information which would allow clients to interact effectively with the agency or meet their information needs and move on. The second frustration was that of Edith Cowan University students who battled with a diverse, overlapping and incomplete set of both online and paper based resources as they sought to make decisions about their selections of supporting studies. Both frustrations arose from a lack of user centeredness in the design and construction of the information services provided. A solution would be to establish an effective and efficient method to find out what information users of online information services really needed in order to solve the problems which brought them to the sites in the first place. The sense-making metatheoretic approach of Brenda Dervin with its accompanying timeline interview methodology suggested itself as an in-depth way to elicit the information needs of potential users of online information services. However, timeline interview protocols require long, complex and highly structured interviews. This study, as <b>a</b> result, <b>developed</b> as <b>a</b> <b>critical</b> <b>review</b> of sense-making {{in the context of the}} timeline interview by comparing the insights into information needs obtained from timeline interviews with those of three, more widely used, information gathering methods; survey, semi-structured interview and focus group. Students, mainly from the Edith Cowan University Schools of Communication and Multimedia and Computer and Information Science, were asked about their information needs in relation to choosing supporting studies as required by their course structures. All data collection methods were analysed using the same qualitative content analysis techniques. The outcome showed a high degree of consistency between the information needs elicited by all four data collection methods. In addition, the timeline interviews did not identify any major information needs not found by the alternative methods. Another notable finding was that respondents to all four data collection methods expressed a strong preference for speaking to a real live person as a way of meeting their information needs. This goes against conventional view of the technology preferences of younger people. The time and resources required to carry out and analyse the timeline interviews were also much greater than for any of the other data collection methods. The implications for the designers of online information services are that many people are perfectly capable of explicating their information needs regardless of the way in which those needs are elicited. That being the case, the cheapest and quickest method chosen is likely to provide useful insight into information needs. A final implication is that online services which provide links to real people via technologies such as social networking, voice or video contact are the most likely to give users a feeling of assurance about the information they obtai...|$|R
40|$|Flexible working {{arrangements}} (FWA) {{has become an}} important aspect in Human Resource Management policy for organization {{to attract and retain}} talented employees in the organization. The low female participation in labour workforce has motivated this study to be conducted. It aimed to provide insight to the employers on female employees special needs and their readiness to embrace flexible {{working arrangements}} if the resources were made available to them. “Readiness” to embrace flexible working arrangement was not previously studied in the flexible working arrangements field, hence a considerable amount of {{attention has been paid to}} construct the theoretical framework. An instrument is <b>developed</b> based on <b>a</b> <b>critical</b> <b>review</b> of Person-Environment (PE) fit theory that is able to explain the readiness of female employees depending on the situation surroundings them. Thus, this study postulates into three microsystems that are family (family responsibility, perceived benefits), work (career advancement, company policy), and community (supportive workplace) in PE fit theory that creates demands and resources (readiness on flexible working arrangements). The integrated approach has explained how the independent variables family responsibility, perceived benefits, career advancement, company policy impact on the readiness on flexible working arrangements and the mediating role of supportive workplace. The results shown that hypothesised relationships were partially supported, i. e family responsibility and perceived benefits was positively related to readiness to embrace flexible working arrangements. Besides, supportive workplace mediated the relationship between perceived benefits and company policy in relation to readiness to embrace flexible working arrangements. These findings have also demonstrated that women with different experience have different demands in flexible working arrangements. Findings have shown that 60 percent of the respondents were ready to embrace flexible working arrangements except for part time work options. Besides, this study has found that respondents with no children favored in compressed work schedule as the statistical result recorded at p< 0. 05. The output of this study would be able to benefit policy makers, organizations and practitioners to establish flexible working arrangements in Malaysia. Consequently, corporate companies would be able to attract more female employees in the business, resulting in higher productivity...|$|R
40|$|This {{thesis is}} {{concerned}} with the role of human rights in contemporary liberal democracy and considers this role specifically {{in the context of the}} 'war on terror'. The thesis examines the relationship between human rights and security developed in this context and considers the processes through which this relationship has been formulated as well as the various players involved in development and maintenance of what needs to be understood as a liberty-security regime. The analysis begins from <b>a</b> <b>critical</b> understanding of contemporary liberalism still very much grounded in its classical tradition and seeks to interrogate the liberal character of the current regime. The necessary unraveling of this regime is done in part through a comparative analysis of the relationship between liberty and security as formulated in state strategy in the UK, Australia and the US. However, rather than understanding this regime as developed and sustained solely at the level of state or government action, the crucial role of civil society actors, particularly of certain intellectual strata and of human rights advocacy organisations, in constructing and legitimating such a regime, as well as the interplay between these perspectives, is also at the core of this study. The thesis demonstrates the pivotal role that liberal intellectuals and human rights organisations play in not only legitimating the current regime but also influencing its current form. Fundamentally, the research suggests that this legitimating function exists not in spite of their apparently critical position but because of it. The analysis in turn aims to establish whether the role of human rights in this context is indicative of an inherent political functionality or whether there is the possibility that human rights can be part of an alternative and above all emancipatory politics. To <b>develop</b> this consideration, <b>a</b> <b>critical</b> <b>review</b> is provided of certain thinkers on the left who utilise human rights principles as central to a critique of the current regime and as part of their vision of an alternative, leftist politics. By demonstrating that the effect of a human rights framework on critical interventions is not restricted to those working within the liberal tradition, this thesis suggests that a commitment to human rights principles in this context cannot be part of the development of a substantive critique of both the current regime and the wider liberal-capitalist status quo...|$|R
40|$|Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) {{has become}} an {{important}} strategic policy for organisations despite increasing pressures for its incorporation into business practices. A considerable amount of {{attention has been paid}} to the construct of CSR and yet research on the precise measurement of CSR has remained limited. Measures have been hampered by a lack of clarity in theoretical frameworks and empirical methods for the CSR construct. Given that the empirical study of CSR measurement is in an undeveloped state, this research describes efforts to justify and prove the relationship between measurement items and the construct. An instrument is <b>developed</b> based on <b>a</b> <b>critical</b> <b>review</b> of both the conceptualisation and practice of CSR. Based on a study among Malaysian stakeholders, this research conceptualises CSR as a multidimensional formative construct consisting of eight dimensions: process, policy, values, environment, personal, profit, people and political and offers a more universal framework to enhance developing country adoption and practice of CSR. Moreover the results of the study demonstrate how corporate social responsibility (CSR) multidimensional formative construct impacts on satisfaction and loyalty of stakeholders. The study’s hypothesised relationships were principally supported, i. e. CSR is positively associated with stakeholder loyalty and stakeholder satisfaction mediated the relationships. What has been expressed is a set of ideals that are possible, are likely to be manageable, and that pay due regard to the need for feasibility in regard to CSR measurement. This research should be seen as a response to a problem of the prolonged dilemma that the disciplinary boundaries of the contested concept of CSR often make it difficult to contend with. The analysis led to the development of a practitioner-based model of CSR multidimensional formative construct that in some aspects differs from the existing conceptualisation of CSR. The formative CSR construct and insights gained from stakeholders’ view open up a critique that diverges from a discourse dominated by the technical question of how to perform CSR better or more efficiently. A CSR measurement model, the constraints of the process of the development of CSR measurement are acknowledged and the attempt made to reform it from within is presented in this study. In this regard, it is proposed that the agenda and scope of CSR, as well as the measures used to implement it, are a manifestation of the formative construct that corporations have to operationalise...|$|R
40|$|To realistically {{assess the}} seismic risk {{relating}} to built infrastructures in Hong Kong {{and in the}} neighbouring coastal cities of southern Guangdong province, {{it is necessary to}} predict ground shaking induced by different earthquake scenarios with good accuracy. A companion paper has described the modelling of the spatial and temporal distribution of the diffused seismic activities in the region, based on the newly-developed ‘Expanding Circular Disc’ (ECD) method. Representative Magnitude–Distance (M–R) combinations for both near-field and far-field earthquakes (in relation to Hong Kong) have been derived using the ECD method. The present paper describes the modelling of the response spectrum on rock sites associated with the predicted M–R combinations, using the Component Attenuation Model (CAM) that was also developed recently by the authors, based on stochastic simulations of the seismological model. The significant effects of soil resonance on the response spectrum are described in a separate publication. The accuracy of CAM in modelling ground motion properties on rock sites has been tested here by comparisons with (i) strong motions recorded in Taiwan and South China from the 1999 ‘Chi-Chi’ earthquake in Taiwan (M= 7. 6), (ii) motions recorded in South China from another earthquake occurring in the southern Taiwan Strait in the same year (M= 5. 1), and (iii) historical seismic intensity data obtained within South China. The overall capability of CAM in modelling both near-field and far-field attenuation {{has been shown to be}} unmatched by existing empirical models. Results of the comparison studies confirm the accuracy of CAM, particularly within an epicentral distance of 300 – 400 km. This study shows that the developed serviceability response spectra (i. e. at short return periods) are controlled mainly by the earthquake recurrence behaviour of major distant seismic sources. In contrast, the ultimate response spectra (i. e. at long return periods) relate to events with magnitudes close to the maximum credible earthquake (MCE) limit, the effect of which may also be represented by the Characteristic Response Spectrum (CRS). Both types of earthquake scenario can be significantly affected by the regional crustal properties. The proposed response spectrum envelopes have been compared with previously <b>developed</b> recommendations, and <b>a</b> <b>critical</b> <b>review</b> has been conducted. The intrinsic advantages of the ECD–CAM modelling approach have been highlighted, emphasising its directness and transparency when compared with the more complex process required to implement traditional Probabilistic Seismic Hazard Assessment (PSHA) ...|$|R
40|$|Graduation date: 1972 Presentation date: 1972 - 04 - 28 Purposes of the Study: The {{study had}} several purposes, the major one being to {{identify}} common professional education competencies essential to adequate performance by administrators of vocational {{education at the}} community college level. Other purposes of the study were to: (1) determine if significant differences existed in vocational administration competencies among respondents as categorized by state, institution, position held, and proportion of time devoted to teaching; (2) determine the extent of commonality among individual community college administrators of vocational education according to values given the 98 professional education competencies included in the study; (3) formulate implications to be considered in the development of curriculum content, performance objectives, and teaching strategies for the preparation of community college administrators of vocational education; and (4) identify the method recommended by the respondents for preparing individuals to perform each competency included in the study. Procedures: A 98 -item mail survey questionnaire was <b>developed</b> through <b>a</b> <b>critical</b> <b>review</b> of literature on professional education competencies in areas of community college, vocational education administration. The questionnaire was designed so that deans and department chairmen could respond to the level of proficiency necessary for each competency in relation to their job. Responses were assigned Likert-type scale values of 5 to 1. The questionnaire also included a checklist designed to reflect the best recommended methods (coursework, on-the-job experience, or a combination of coursework and on-the-job experience) for preparing leadership personnel to perform specific competencies. A total of 48 community colleges from Arizona, California, Colorado, and Washington who met predetermined criteria agreed to cooperate in the research. A randomized sample of 175 deans/directors and department chairmen involved in vocational education was selected from community colleges participating in the study. One hundred forty-three usable questionnaires were returned and analyzed by utilizing analysis of variance and factor analysis analytic techniques. Selected Findings Selected findings were: 1. Except for five competencies, no differences existed between four states represented in the study. 2. Except for five competencies, no differences existed between the 48 community colleges. 3. Twenty-eight competencies were rejected when positions of administrators were compared indicating differences exist. 4. Except for four competencies, no differences existed between respondents in regard to the proportion of time allotted to teaching. 5. A five-factor solution extracted 59 competencies that had factor loadings greater than ±. 50. 6. The combination of on-the-job experience and formal coursework was identified as the preferred method of competency preparation. Conclusions and Recommendations: Fifteen conclusions were presented based on the review of current literature, the questionnaire, and the results of statistical analysis. Five selected conclusions are: 1. The five clusters of competencies identified represent meaningful groups that can form the bases for developing curriculum to prepare community college vocational education administrators. 2. The few differences that occurred between states, community colleges, and teaching responsibilities were attributable to chance. 3. The differences that occurred between positions were interpreted as true differences. Seven competencies were identified as unique to the needs of department chairmen and 21 competencies were identified as unique to the needs of deans. 4. A combination of formal coursework and on-the-job experience is the preferred method of vocational administrator preparation for community colleges. 5. A high degree of similarity exists between the 143 respondents. Six recommendations were offered in view of the findings and conclusions derived from the study. Two selected recommendations are: 1. That behavioral objectives and individualized instructional packages be developed from competencies in the present study and used to prepare community college administrators of vocational education. 2. That a composite data analysis be conducted on the concurrent studies by Baltimore (1972) and Martin (1972), and the individual study by Sundstrom (1972) to ascertain similarity of results. If strong similarities exist between populations, it was recommended that the western states cooperate in establishing vocational leadership programs with a common base...|$|R
40|$|This work {{presents}} an advanced modelling procedure, which applies both structural modelling and kinetic modelling {{approaches to the}} trypanothione metabolic network in the bloodstream form of Trypanosoma brucei, the parasite responsible for African Sleeping sickness. Trypanothione has previously been identified as an essential compound for parasitic protozoa, however the underlying metabolic processes are poorly understood. Structural modelling allows {{the study of the}} network metabolism in the absence of sufficient quantitative information of target enzymes. Using this approach we examine the essential features associated with the control and regulation of intracellular trypanothione level. The first detailed kinetic model of the trypanothione metabolic network is <b>developed,</b> based on <b>a</b> <b>critical</b> <b>review</b> of the relevant scientific papers. Kinetic modelling of the network focuses on understanding the effect of anti-trypanosomal drug DFMO and examining other enzymes as potential targets for anti-trypanosomal chemotherapy. We also consider the inverse problem of parameter estimation when the system is defined with non-linear differential equations. The performance of <b>a</b> recently <b>developed</b> population-based PSwarm algorithm that has not yet been widely applied to biological problems is investigated and the problem of parameter estimation under conditions such as experimental noise and lack of information content is illustrated using the ERK signalling pathway. We propose a novel multi-objective optimization algorithm (MoPSwarm) for the validation of perturbation-based models of biological systems, and perform a comparative study to determine the factors crucial to the performance of the algorithm. By simultaneously taking several, possibly conflicting aspects into account, the problem of parameter estimation arising from non-informative experimental measurements can be successfully overcome. The reliability and efficiency of MoPSwarm is also tested using the ERK signalling pathway and demonstrated in model validation of the polyamine biosynthetic pathway of the trypanothione network. It is frequently a problem that models of biological systems are based on a relatively small amount of experimental information and that extensive in vivo observations are rarely available. To address this problem, we propose a new and generic methodological framework guided by the principles of Systems Biology. The proposed methodology integrates concepts from mathematical modelling and system identification to enable physical insights about the system to be accounted for in the modelling procedure. The framework takes advantage of module-based representation and employs PSwarm and our proposed multi-objective optimization algorithm as the core of this framework. The methodological framework is employed {{in the study of the}} trypanothione metabolic network, specifically, the validation of the model of the polyamine biosynthetic pathway. Good agreements with several existing data sets are obtained and new predictions about enzyme kinetics and regulatory mechanisms are generated, which could be tested by in vivo approaches.
