The manner in which <b>Femtos</b> are deployed inside a building environment, with large number of users, can significantly affect the throughput and number of handovers among <b>Femtos.</b> In our system model, we {{take into account the}} following parameters: co-channel interference between FBS and macro BSs, wall attenuation factor and user density in the enterprise building environment. In this work, we formulate two mixed integer linear programming (MILP) optimization models: optimal constant threshold signal to interference plus noise ratio (OptCTSINR) which guarantees a certain minimum SINR and also minimizes the number of <b>Femtos</b> needed for the coverage of enterprise buildings and optimal handover (OptHO) which reduces the number of handovers when the user passes through a certain portion (i. e., within a room or corridor) of the building. We solve these MILP models by utilizing branch and cut framework of CPLEX solver using General Algebraic Modeling System (GAMS) tool. When compared to K-means clustering based placement scheme, for a given number of <b>Femtos,</b> proposed OptCTSINR scheme results in an average SINR improvement of 28 %. Similarly, our proposed OptHO scheme reduces 30 % of the unnecessary handovers when compared to OptCTSINR scheme...|$|R

LTE is {{commonly referred to}} as a type of Fourth Generation (4 G) wireless service. LTE offers superior mobile broadband service using femtocells and picocells, in co-ordination with the core network. A deployment that supports macros, picos, <b>femtos</b> and relays in the same spectrum is called a heterogeneous network. In our paper, we present LTE-femtocell heterogeneous network for IMS access. The choice of the access network is prerogative of the mobile operator, because IMS services are independent of the underlying access network. However, to support rich applications offered by IMS, it is better to chose an access network that would support high bandwidths and low jitter. The speeds offered by todays LTE network clearly do not support bandwidth intensive applications like video conferencing and cloud gaming. Hence, we consider a heterogeneous LTE-femtocell network.|$|R
30|$|Architecture of {{traditional}} cellular networks has been undergoing dramatic changes {{due to the}} intense consumer demand for mobile data. Recently, the heterogeneous networks (HetNets) have emerged as the network architecture to support the growing demand for data services. They have a hierarchical architecture, comprising an overlay of a macrocell network with additional tiers of small cells (picos, <b>femtos,</b> or WiFi access points). This enlarges the pool of available spectrum resources for mobile users, since they are reused across the multiple tiers in the HetNet, harnessing also an additional spectrum in unlicensed bands by integrating WiFi hotspots (femtocells) in the network. The use of WiFi {{in conjunction with the}} Macrocell allows relieving congestion on it. From the above and the cost point of view, WiFi has {{become an integral part of}} the operator’s strategy [1]. However, by reusing resources, potentially destructive interference in the HetNet is generated.|$|R
40|$|The dense {{deployment}} of Femtocells within the Macrocell's coverage {{is expected to}} dominate the future of Long Term Evolution (LTE) networks. While Mobile Femtocells (Mobile-Femtos) could be the solution for vehicular networks {{when there is a}} need to improve the vehicular User Equipment (UE) performance by mitigating the impact of penetration loss and path-loss issues. The deployed Femtocells have operated in a co-channel deployment due to the scarcity of spectrums. This issue causes interference between Femtocells and Macrocells as well it causes extra overhead on the LTE networks because of the co-tire interference between adjacent Femtocells. In this paper two interference scenarios are considered, the interference between Mobile-Femto and Macrocell, and the interference between the Mobile <b>Femtos</b> themselves. Therefore, to avoid the generated interference between Femtocells, the controlled transmission powers as well as the coverage planning techniques have been discussed. While in the worst-case scenarios, a frequency reuse scheme has been proposed to avoid the generated interference effectively and dynamically between the Mobile-Femtos as well as their UEs and between the Macrocell UEs...|$|R

50|$|When <b>Femto</b> Forum (current Small Cell Forum) was {{launched}} in 2007, {{one of the main}} issues in the Femtocell industry was the lack of standardized femtocell architecture, including the standardized O&M framework. In order to avoid the fragmentation in the market, <b>Femto</b> Forum initially focused on these areas. As the Forum reached consensus, the leading companies brought the joint proposal to 3GPP to standardize the HNB architecture. The standardization in the signalling (Control Plane) architecture later resulted in Iu-h interface in 3GPP. It includes the specification of signalling protocol Home Node B Application Part (HNBAP) and RANAP User Adaptation (RUA). The Data Model was subsequently published by Broadband Forum as TR-196 Issue 1 (<b>Femto</b> Access Point Service Data Model). It is based on Broadband Forum's TR-069 CWMP as the signalling protocol.|$|E

50|$|The {{simulations}} {{performed in}} the <b>Femto</b> Forum WG2 and 3GPP RAN4 encompass a wide spectrum ofpossible deployment scenarios including shared channel and dedicated channel deployments. In addition, thestudies looked at the impact in different morphologies, {{as well as in}} closed versus open access. The followingare broad conclusions from the studies::1. When femtocells are used in areas of poor or no coverage, macro/femto interference is unlikely to be a problem.:2. If the <b>femto</b> network is sharing the channel (co-channel) with the macro network, interference can occur. However, if the interference management techniques advocated by the <b>Femto</b> Forum are adopted, the resulting interference can be mitigated in most cases.:3. A femtocell network deployed on an adjacent dedicated channel is unlikely to create interference to a macro network. Additionally, the impact of a macro network on the performance of a femtocell on an adjacent channel is limited to isolated cases. If the interference mitigation techniques advocated by the <b>Femto</b> Forum are used, the impact is further marginalised.:4. Closed access represents the worst-case scenario for creation of interference. Open access reduces the chances of User Equipment (mobile phone handsets, 3G data dongles, etc.) on the macro network interfering with a proximate femtocell.:5. The same conclusions were reached for both the 850 MHz (3GPP Band 17) and 2100 MHz (3GPP Band 1) deployments that were studied.The conclusions are common to the 850 MHz and 2100 MHz bands that were simulated in the studies, and can beextrapolated to other mobile bands. With interference mitigation techniques successfully implemented, simulations showthat femtocell deployments can enable very high capacity networks by providing between a 10 and 100 timesincrease in capacity with minimal deadzone impact and acceptable noise rise.Femtocells can also create a much better user experience by enabling substantially higher data rates than can be obtained with a macro network and net throughputs that will be ultimately limited by backhaul in most cases (over 20 Mbps in 5 MHz).|$|E
