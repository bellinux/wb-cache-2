50|$|The Arroyo {{administration}} in 2001 inherited a poor fiscal position that {{was attributed to}} weakening tax effort (still resulting from the 1997 CTRP) and rising <b>debt</b> <b>servicing</b> <b>costs</b> (due to peso depreciation). Large fiscal deficits and heavy losses for monitored government corporations lingered from 2001-2004 as her caretaker administration struggled to reverse downward trends. Following her election in 2004, the national debt-to-GDP ratio reached a high of 79% in that year, before dropping every year thereafter to 57.5% by 2009, her last full year in office. Lesser roads and bridges and other infrastructure were built during the Arroyo administration compare to the previous three administrations. Educational spending likewise increased from only Ps 9.3 Billion in 2001 to Ps 22.7 Billion by 2009. The cost of medicines was brought down {{by as much as}} 50% {{as a result of the}} Cheaper Medicines Act and the opening of Botikas ng Bayan and Botikas ng Barangay, while the ground-breaking conditional cash transfers (CCT) program was adapted from Latin America to stimulate positive behaviors among the poor. As a result, the Arroyo administration contributed to ever-declining levels in self-rated poverty, from a high of 68% at the start of the Ramons administration, to around 50% at the end of the Arroyo one. Much of the fuel for government activism came from an expanded value-added tax (from 10% to 12%) in 2005 (see final reports of various Cabinet agencies concerned), which with other fiscal reforms paved the way for successive sovereign credit rating upgrades by the time Arroyo stepped down in June 2010. These fiscal reforms complemented conservative liquidity management by the Central Bank, allowing the peso, for the first time ever, to close even stronger at the end of a presidential term than at the start.|$|E
40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{consists of}} three essays on corporate finance. In the first chapter, I investigate how a liquidity cost associated with debt- `debt servicing cost' affects a firm's capital structure policy. In contrast to the standard capital structure theory prediction that builds on a trade-off between interest tax shields and expected bankruptcy costs, public firms use debt quite conservatively. To address this well known debt conservatism puzzle (Graham 2000), I argue that servicing debt drains valuable liquidity for a financially constrained firm and hence endogenously creates `debt servicing costs,' which have received little attention in the literature. To examine the influence of <b>debt</b> <b>servicing</b> <b>costs</b> on capital structure choices, I develop and estimate a dynamic corporate finance model with interest tax shields, liquidity management, investment, external {{debt and equity financing}} costs, and capital adjustment costs. By using the marginal value of liquidity as a natural measure of the <b>debt</b> <b>servicing</b> <b>costs,</b> I find that (1) an increase in financial leverage results in higher <b>debt</b> <b>servicing</b> <b>costs,</b> even with risk-free debt. (2) a smaller firm tends to experience greater <b>debt</b> <b>servicing</b> <b>costs</b> because of its endogenously large investment demands; and (3) in the majority of cases, equity proceeds are used for cash retention as well as capital expenditure, especially when a firm faces large current and future investment needs. In addition, I quantitatively show that large <b>debt</b> <b>servicing</b> <b>costs</b> are closely associated with low leverage and frequent equity financing by analyzing the role of fixed operating costs and convex capital adjustment costs. In the second chapter, I empirically support the theoretical <b>debt</b> <b>servicing</b> <b>costs</b> analysis of the previous chapter. I firstly examine the structural estimation method used for the calibration of my model in the first chapter. The statistical property of the simulated method of moments estimator and detailed identification scheme for the calibration are investigated {{in the first half of}} this chapter. Then I cross-sectionally confirm the validity of <b>debt</b> <b>servicing</b> <b>costs</b> predictions on capital structure choices. I study how each firm's convex capital adjustment costs, operating leverage, profit volatility, and future investment needs influence capital structure policies. Consistent with the <b>debt</b> <b>servicing</b> <b>costs</b> predictions, firms with higher convex capital adjustment costs, higher operating leverage, higher profit volatility and larger future investment demands show lower leverage ratios and more frequent equity financing activities. These findings shed new lights on pervasively conservative debt policy in U. S. public firms. A higher profitability observed in large future investment demands firms also suggests the importance of <b>debt</b> <b>servicing</b> <b>costs</b> consideration in resolving the puzzling negative correlation between profitability and leverage ratios. In the third chapter, I examine how macroeconomic conditions affect the cyclical variations in capital structure policies. As in the financial crisis of 2008, economic contractions affect a firm's profitability, investments and external financing conditions altogether. To address the effects of these simultaneous changes on capital structure dynamics, I develop and estimate a dynamic trade-off model with investment, payouts, and liquidity policies with macroeconomic profitability and financing shocks. Investment dynamics and a higher value of liquidity of economic downturn are pivotal in capital structure dynamics; the former drives the issuance of debt and equity, and the latter leads to active debt retirements and conservative debt issues in upturns. My model yields the following main results: (1) Equity issues are pro-cyclical, and concentrated for small, low profit, and large investment demand firms in earlier stage of economic upturns. (2) Payouts peak in later stages of upturns and co-move positively with equity issues; (3) Debt policies move counter-cyclically, and leverage ratios after debt issuance and retirement are even higher during economic downturns. My comparative static analysis predicts pro-cyclical debt policy for financially constrained firms, and pervasively conservative use of debt for firms expecting financial market shutdowns, a sharp profitability drop, or a longer stay in economic downturns...|$|E
