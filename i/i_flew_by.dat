40|$|Lysozyme {{amyloidosis}} is a {{hereditary disease}} in which mutations in the gene coding for lysozyme leads to misfolding and consequently accumulation of amyloid material. To improve {{understanding of the}} processes involved we expressed human wild type (WT) lysozyme and the disease-associated variant F 57 I in {{the central nervous system}} (CNS) of a Drosophila melanogaster model of lysozyme amyloidosis, with and without co-expression of serum amyloid p component (SAP). SAP is known to be a universal constituent of amyloid deposits and to associate with lysozyme fibrils. There are clear indications that SAP may {{play an important role in}} lysozyme amyloidosis, which requires further elucidation. We found that flies expressing the amyloidogenic variant F 57 I in the CNS have a shorter lifespan than flies expressing WT lysozyme. We also identified apoptotic cells in the brains of F 57 <b>I</b> <b>flies</b> demonstrating that the flies neurological functions are impaired when F 57 I is expressed in the nerve cells. However, co-expression of SAP in the CNS prevented cell death and restored the F 57 <b>I</b> <b>flies</b> lifespan. Thus, SAP has the apparent ability to protect nerve cells from damage caused by F 57 I. Furthermore, it was found that co-expression of SAP prevented accumulation of insoluble forms of lysozyme in both WT- and F 57 I-expressing flies. Our findings suggest that the F 57 I mutation affects the aggregation process of lysozyme resulting in the formation of cytotoxic species and that SAP is able to prevent cell death in the F 57 <b>I</b> <b>flies</b> <b>by</b> preventing accumulation of toxic F 57 I structures.

50|$|On 2 March 1953, {{the first}} {{prototype}} Trident I conducted the type's maiden flight; <b>flown</b> <b>by</b> test pilot Jacques Guignard, the aircraft used {{the entire length}} of the runway to get airborne, being powered only by its turbojet engines. It was initially flown without any rocket engine installed, relying solely upon its turbojet engines instead. According to aviation author Bill Gunston, the early test flights of the SO.9000 were 'hairy' prior to the installation of the rocket motor, which first occurred during September 1954. On 1 September 1953, during the first flight of the second Trident <b>I</b> prototype, <b>flown</b> <b>by</b> Guignard, the aircraft crashed after struggling to gain altitude after takeoff and colliding with an electricity pylon, resulting in its loss and Guignard sustaining severe injuries.|$|R

2500|$|The ANEC I and II, {{designed}} by W.S Shackleton, were amongst the earliest ultralight aircraft; {{they were very}} small, wooden, strut braced high-wing monoplanes. The first ANEC I, registered G-EBHR, first flew at Brooklands on 21 August 1923. It was the first aircraft with an inverted engine, a 696 cc Blackburne Tomtit, to fly in the United Kingdom. [...] The ANEC I was designed {{to the rules of}} the 1923 Lympne light aircraft trials, principally an engine capacity limit of 750cc, and the two aircraft completed that August took part. [...] The main prizes were for fuel economy and the second ANEC <b>I</b> G-EBIL, <b>flown</b> <b>by</b> Jimmy James, shared half of the £1,500 prize with an English Electric Wren for flights of 87.5miles (141km) on one gallon (4.54 L) of petrol. [...] He later reached an altitude of 14,000ft (4,267 m) in it. G-EBIL was evaluated by the Air Ministry in 1924, briefly carrying the RAF serial J7506. Afterwards it was modified with a wingspan greatly reduced [...] from 32ft to 18ft 4 in (9.75 m to 5.59 m) and re-engined with a 1,000 cc Anzani engine for entry in the 1925 Lympne August Bank Holiday Races, designated the ANEC IA.|$|R
40|$|Abstract. We convert, via {{a version}} that uses constraints, a type {{inference}} system for strictness analysis into an algorithm which given an expression finds {{the set of}} possible typings. Although this set in general does not possess a minimal element, it can be represented compactly by means of symbolic expressions in normal form – such expressions have the property that once values for the constraint variables with negative polarity have been supplied it is straight-forward to compute the minimal values for the constraint variables with positive polarity. The normalization process works on the <b>fly,</b> <b>i.</b> e. <b>by</b> a leaf-to-root traversal of the inference tree. ...|$|R
