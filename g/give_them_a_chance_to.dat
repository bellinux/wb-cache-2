500|$|Lopez later {{confirmed}} {{in an interview}} On Air with Ryan Seacrest, that the completed music video would premiere jointly on season ten of American Idol and on Vevo on March 3,2011. Fans could vote between three alternative endings through Idols official website. Lopez said the idea behind giving fans the choice was to <b>give</b> <b>them</b> <b>a</b> <b>chance</b> <b>to</b> see what she experienced. [...] "You get to do what I do,... Like, I go in there with my videos and I start editing and picking all the shots I like {{and the things that}} I like and what I feel the best kind of feeling for the record is. You guys get to do that. We picked two different ones and we weren't sure." [...] The alternative endings included three varying scenes: in the first, the video ends with a close-up of Lopez's face in the silver lace catsuit; the second ends with a shot of dancers defying gravity on the walls and ceiling, while the final ending ends with a shot of Lopez on the dance floor in her harem pants. The first ending was the one used in the final video.|$|E
500|$|Schneider {{began the}} year as the team's {{starting}} goaltender. In his first game against the Anaheim Ducks, Schneider allowed five goals on 14 shots and was pulled midway through the second period. When Luongo entered the game {{he was given a}} standing ovation from the crowd. Luongo gave up another two goals as the Canucks lost 7–3. In the post-game interview, Schneider took the blame for the loss, saying, [...] "It was unacceptable to play that way and to put my team in that situation and not even <b>give</b> <b>them</b> <b>a</b> <b>chance</b> <b>to</b> win." [...] He also stated he would work hard to fix the mistakes. While Luongo said of this ovation that it was [...] "a fun moment." [...] The situation quickly led to a goalie controversy. Luongo made the start the following night against the Edmonton Oilers. According to Vigneault, he had already determined the starting assignments for the opening two games, and Schneider did not factor into Luongo's start. In the game, Luongo allowed two goals after Vancouver had taken a 2–0 lead. The Canucks lost the game 3–2 in a shootout. Luongo failed to stop either of the two shooters he faced, while Vancouver did not score. After losing their first two games, Vancouver added to their forward depth recalling Jordan Schroeder from the AHL and assigning Jim Vandermeer to the Wolves. Schroeder took over the second line duties after Andrew Ebbett went pointless in the first two contests.|$|E

500|$|Matters {{came to a}} head at the Gridiron Dinner [...] on January 27; {{the program}} showed {{cartoons}} of the leading attendees and accompanying verses. [...] Foraker's read [...] "All [...] look alike to me", suggesting his Brownsville stance was to attract the black vote. [...] According to Walters, [...] "the jests had been pointed and the cartoons biting"; Roosevelt was seen to be angry. [...] Nevertheless, when the President rose to speak, all that was expected was a few minutes of humorous comments. [...] Instead, in his speech, Roosevelt attacked Foraker and defended his own conduct in the Brownsville case. [...] Although it was not customary to permit anyone to follow a president's speech, Foraker was allowed to reply. [...] The Washington Post reported that Foraker [...] "gave the President the plainest talk he has probably ever listened to." [...] Foraker stated that [...] Sergeant Sanders had been dishonorably discharged [...] even though [...] "he was as innocent of any offense against the law of any kind whatever as the President himself"—and, he charged, Roosevelt was fully aware the soldiers had been wronged. [...] He denied that he was after votes with his position, [...] "I was seeking to provide for those men an opportunity to be heard in their own defense, to <b>give</b> <b>them</b> <b>a</b> <b>chance</b> <b>to</b> confront their accusers and cross-examine their witnesses, and establish the real facts in the case." [...] Roosevelt spoke in angry rebuttal, but according to his biographer Morris, [...] "Never before, at the Gridiron or anywhere else, had a President been challenged before an audience." ...|$|E
500|$|Shortly before Christmas of 2011, Christopher Nolan invited several {{prominent}} directors, including Edgar Wright, Michael Bay, Bryan Singer, Jon Favreau, Eli Roth, Duncan Jones and Stephen Daldry, to Universal CityWalk's IMAX theatre {{for a private}} screening of the first six minutes of The Dark Knight Rises, which had been shot on IMAX film and edited from the original camera negative. Nolan, feeling {{that the use of}} film stock in cinema is currently being phased out due to the introduction of digital cinematography and projection, used this screening to make a case for the continued use of film, which he asserts still offers superior image quality to any digital format, and warned the filmmakers that unless they continued to assert their choice to use film in their productions, they may eventually lose it as an option. Nolan explained; [...] "I wanted to <b>give</b> <b>them</b> <b>a</b> <b>chance</b> <b>to</b> see the potential, because I think IMAX is the best film format that was ever invented. It's the gold standard and what any other technology has to match up to, but none have, in my opinion. The message I wanted to put out there was that no one is taking anyone's digital cameras away. But if we want film to continue as an option, and someone is working on a big studio movie with the resources and the power to insist [...] film, they should say so. I felt as if I didn't say anything, and then we started to lose that option, it would be a shame. When I look at a digitally acquired and projected image, it looks inferior against an original negative anamorphic print or an IMAX one." ...|$|E

[...] Church officials, according to the Washington Post, mentioned Caterpillar Inc. as a possible target of the selective divestment campaign because the company [...] "manufactures bulldozers used by Israel to demolish Palestinian homes that are built without permits or belong to families of suicide bombers." ...|$|E

2500|$|On February 8, 1949, the Cincinnati Reds signed Michigan State University star catcher Landrith. This angered Spartans coach John Kobs, who {{was quoted}} as saying, [...] "They ought to leave these young players alone and <b>give</b> <b>them</b> <b>a</b> <b>chance</b> <b>to</b> finish college." [...] Reds general manager Warren Giles agreed with the coach's sentiment, but cited {{that he could not}} wait any longer to sign Landrith as eight other major league ball clubs were all {{interested}} in signing him. The Big Ten Conference made a brief effort to stop the [...] "raid" [...] of the conference of their star players, but nonetheless, the 18-year-old catcher out of Detroit agreed to a four-year contract with the Reds.|$|E

60|$|The care of {{the hens}} is one of Farmer Brown's boy's duties. It {{is one of those}} duties which most of the time is a pleasure. He likes the biddies, and he likes to take {{care of the}}m. Every morning {{one of the first things}} he does is to feed them and open the {{henhouse}} so that they can run in the henyard if they want to. Every night he goes out just before dark, collects the eggs and locks the henhouse so that no harm can come to the biddies while they are asleep on their roosts. After the big snowstorm he had shovelled a place in the henyard where the hens could come out and exercise and get a sun-bath when they wanted to, and in the very warmest part of the clay they would do this. Always in the daytime he took the greatest care to see that the henyard gate was fastened, for no one knew better than he how bold Granny and Reddy Fox can be when they are very hungry, and in winter they are very apt to be very hungry most of the time. So he didn't intend to <b>give</b> <b>them</b> <b>a</b> <b>chance</b> <b>to</b> slip into that henyard while the biddies were out, or to give the biddies a chance to stray outside where they might be still more easily caught.|$|E
