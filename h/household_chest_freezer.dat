40|$|In {{a country}} such as India, food grains, fruit, vegetables, meat, poultry and fish, are very {{susceptible}} to microbial contamination and spoilage and require stringent preservation methods. One such method {{is by the}} use of a <b>chest</b> <b>freezer</b> for the storage of frozen food. This investigation considers different loads and design parameters {{for the development of a}} <b>chest</b> <b>freezer</b> using R 134 a as the working fluid. Experimental designs of an evaporator coil, condenser coil and capillary tube are investigated through the development of storage periods in terms of steady state and cyclic performance, by optimising the quantity of refrigerant charge, with strict adherence to the standards and requirement for maintaining an internal temperature of - 23 °C at 43 °C ambient. Cyclic load performance tests optimise the performance of individual components selected for the design of a <b>chest</b> <b>freezer.</b> The system selection has a highly balanced performance with R 134 a and showed 118 kJ/kg cooling capacity with 8. 42 coefficient of performance (COP). By the replacement of R 134 a, temperatures of - 23 °C are maintained inside the freezer cabinet with low power consumption and an increase in the net refrigerating effect, which in turn increases the COP. The system design has optimum efficiency with moderate costs by optimising the length and diameter of the evaporator coil, i. e., 34. 15 m and 7. 94 mm, respectively...|$|R

40|$|An {{analysis}} {{of the performance of}} well <b>freezers,</b> <b>chest</b> <b>freezers,</b> frozen and chilled door cabinets (solid or glass door) and open fronted chilled cabinets under EN 441 test conditions demonstrated that maximum temperatures in cabinets were generally in the most exposed (to ambient) areas and that minimum temperatures were located in the least exposed areas. Detailed positions of maximum and minimum temperature varied between cabinet types. In <b>chest</b> <b>freezers</b> 95 % of the maximum temperature positions were located in the top layer and 95 % of the minimum temperature positions were located in the middle layer of the cabinets. In full door frozen cabinets the maximum temperature position was in the majority of cases on the top shelf (64 %) with most maximum packs being {{at the front of the}} top shelf (53 %). In the chilled full door cabinets 94 % of the maximum temperature packs were situated at the front of the cabinet. In open fronted cabinets the majority of maximum temperature packs (97 %) were located at the front of the cabinet, the largest number (60 %) being at the front of the base of the cabinet. In well cabinets the majority of maximum temperature packs (81 %) were located in the top layer of the cabinet and the majority (91 %) of minimum temperature packs were located in the bottom of the cabinet. Large differences in energy consumed by cabinets of similar size and temperature performance were found indicating that large reductions in energy and CO 2 emissions could be achieved by selection of the most efficient cabinets. © 2006 Elsevier Ltd and IIR...|$|R

50|$|You {{can also}} convert a top opening <b>chest</b> <b>freezer</b> into a beer {{dispenser}} {{with the use}} of a thermostat control unit. This setup is known as a keezer. The advantage of a keezer is that you are assured it will get cold enough to dispense beer at the proper temperature range (32-38 degrees Fahrenheit) and it usually has more interior floor space than a refrigerator, allowing it to store and dispense more kegs. The disadvantage is that it requires the thermostat to be overridden to ensure you don't freeze your kegs and you have to lift the heavy kegs up and over the freezer wall. You can accomplish this conversion with a tower kegerator conversion kit or build an extension on top of the freezer to mount the door and taps onto.|$|R

40|$|International audienceIn this study, {{the melting}} process of nonspherical and spherical ice {{particles}} was investigated. Individual ice particles were suspended in an acoustic levitator {{placed in a}} <b>chest</b> <b>freezer.</b> Melting of the particles was initiated by directing a warm stream of air with controlled temperature, flow rate, and relative humidity toward them. Tests were conducted at 13 different flow conditions. The melting process was recorded by a high-speed video camera. Datasets of 222 individual melting events were collected. From the images, the melting time and the cross-sectional area of the ice particles during melting were measured. Furthermore, a method is presented that allows an approximate calculation of the initial mass of the ice particles based on the postmelting evolutions of the cross-sectional area. Theoretical melting times were calculated based on a model for spherical and nonspherical particles and were compared with the experimental melting times. The model was validated with spherical ice particles, and its predictions of melting times of nonspherical ice particles agreed very well with the experimental data...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{reports the}} results of a {{large-scale}} survey in which 998 cold appliances were monitored in 766 properties in England. No surveys published to date analyse such a large dataset, which includes data on ambient temperature, cold appliance temperature (refrigerator and/or freezer) and electricity consumption of the cold appliance. Simultaneous measurements of the temperature inside and outside of the cold appliances and the electricity consumption were taken over a period of seven days during a nine-month period in 2015. An interview was also conducted with the householders to collect further information about the cold appliances and their usage patterns. The cold appliances monitored in the work included fridge-freezers (52 %), refrigerators with ice-box (6 %), larder fridges (14 %), <b>chest</b> <b>freezers</b> (9 %) and upright freezers (19 %). It was found that for all monitored cold appliances with valid data that: the mean ambient temperature was 18. 5 °C; the mean refrigerator temperature was 5. 3 °C; the mean freezer temperature was - 20. 3 °C; and the mean electricity consumption was 354 kWh per year.

40|$|Refrigerating {{units are}} a major end use of {{electricity}} across the residential sector. Specifically in the United States, many households utilize a second refrigerator or freezer in unconditioned spaces, such as a garage or basement. With efforts to improve efficiency and reduce consumption, {{it is important to}} understand how a unit behaves outside the design conditions. The forecasted annual energy consumption as published on the EnergyGuide sticker is determined by testing the unit at a specified external temperature that simulates the loads of an indoor kitchen and does not accurately reflect the consumption at either thermal extremes. During this project, dorm-size refrigerators, standard-size refrigerators, and <b>chest</b> <b>freezers</b> were tested at various external temperatures ranging from 33 ?F to 110 ?F to determine the trend of the annual energy consumption and related cost. The results of these tests were that, in general, the consumption increases with increasing external temperature. There was interesting behavior at the lower temperatures that requires further research, but the defining trend followed a cubic regression, rather than linear. Housing a unit in a cooler environment will result in a lower energy consumption, but it is recommended that consumers do not store their refrigerators or freezers in areas that will experience temperatures above 90 ?F or below 55 ?F...|$|R

40|$|A {{field study}} was {{conducted}} through interviews on offshore islands in Taiwan to investigate the energy usage of local residents. A comparison of household appliance usage in mainland Taiwan with that on the offshore islands revealed that, overall, {{the most commonly used}} household appliances are steam cookers/rice cookers, water dispensers, and washing machines. For other household appliances, Levels 2 and 3 offshore isles have lower use penetration rates compared with those in mainland Taiwan and on Level 1 offshore isles, particularly for the use of computers. By contrast, the use penetration rate for <b>chest</b> <b>freezers</b> on Levels 2 and 3 offshore isles is high, and each household has one or more freezers on average. This appliance is not a commonly observed household product in mainland Taiwan or on Level 1 offshore isles. Furthermore, because of the government policy, every household on parts of Level 2 offshore isles and on all Level 3 offshore isles has a fixed monthly charge of electricity. The transportation of liquefied petroleum gas is also inconvenient, and the gas price is slightly higher, leading to the tendency of residents to consume excessive amounts of electrical energy, which does not correspond with the aim of the government to conserve energy and reduce carbon emissions; thus, the relevant authorities’ review and improvement on energy consumption on Levels 2 and 3 offshore isles are required...|$|R

40|$|A new, {{small-scale}} {{controlled environment}} plant growth chamber is described, which permits accurately controlled temperatures from ambient (c. 20 °C) down to − 5 °C {{in the day}} or − 15 °C at night. The system also allows controlled injection of pollutant gases. The chamber {{is based on a}} modified commercial <b>chest</b> <b>freezer</b> with temperature control achieved through by-passing the cooling coils in the inner walls of the freezer. This by-pass is controlled by a BBC microcomputer which gives nominal temperature control to 0 · 1 °C over definable diurnal temperature profiles. Photoperiod is also controlled by the microcomputer. The chamber forms a virtually closed system to which pollutant gases are added by injection from low concentration cylinders, regulated using mass flow controllers. The accuracy with which pollutant concentrations are controlled is increased by filtration of the air-stream after passing over the experimental plants: i. e. a ‘single-pass’ system is adopted. In operation air temperatures across the chambers are controlled to within 1 - 1 · 5 °C of the pre-set value over the range 25 to − 10 °C. Leaf temperatures are 2 · 5 - 3 · 0 °C above air temperatures during the day, with a total energy input of c. 180 Wm− 2 from two 400 W metal halide lamps. The lamps provide a photon fluence rate of 270 ± 30 μmol quanta PAR m− 2 s− 1 at plant height. During the dark, leaf temperatures deviate less than 1 · 0 °C from air temperature. Soil temperatures are controlled separately from air temperature and are held above zero at all times. To date, fumigation, with NO 2 and SO 2 has been confined to the daytime. At pre-set concentrations of 20 nl litre− 1 variations during fumigation were less than 2 · 0 – 2 · 5 nl litre− 1 and 0 · 5 nl litre− 1, respectively...|$|R
