The polymer resin is heated to molten state by a combination of heating elements and shear heating from the extrusion screw. [...] The screw, or screws as the case with twin screw extrusion, forces the resin through a die, forming the resin into the desired shape. The <b>extrudate</b> is cooled and solidified as it is pulled through the die or water tank. A [...] "caterpillar haul-off" [...] (called a [...] "puller" [...] in the US) is used to provide tension on the extrusion line which is essential for overall quality of the <b>extrudate.</b> Pelletizers can also create this tension while pulling extruded strands in to be cut. The caterpillar haul-off must provide a consistent pull; otherwise, variation in cut lengths or distorted product will result. [...] In some cases (such as fibre-reinforced tubes) the <b>extrudate</b> is pulled through a very long die, in a process called [...] "pultrusion". The configuration of the interior screws are a driving force dependent on the application. Mixing elements or convey elements are used in various formations. Extrusion is common in the application of adding colorant to molten plastic thus creating specific custom color.|$|E
5000|$|The {{amount of}} {{salt in the}} <b>extrudate</b> may {{determine}} the colour and texture of some extruded products. The expansion ratio and airiness of the product depend on the salt concentration in the <b>extrudate,</b> possibly {{as a result of}} a chemical reaction between the salt and the starches in the <b>extrudate.</b> Colour changes as a result of salt concentration may be caused by [...] "the ability of salt to change the water activity of the <b>extrudate</b> and thus change the rate of browning reactions". Salt is also used to distribute minor ingredients, such as food colours and flavours, after extrusion; these are more evenly distributed over the product's surface after being mixed with salt.|$|E
50|$|In the {{extrusion}} process, {{raw materials}} are first {{ground to the}} correct particle size, usually the consistency of coarse flour. The dry mix is passed through a pre-conditioner, in which other ingredients are added depending on the target product; these may be liquid sugar, fats, dyes, meats or water. Steam is injected to start the cooking process, and the preconditioned mix (<b>extrudate)</b> is then passed through an extruder. The extruder consists of a large, rotating screw tightly fitting within a stationary barrel, {{at the end of}} which is the die. The extruder's rotating screw forces the <b>extrudate</b> toward the die, through which it then passes. The amount of time the <b>extrudate</b> is in the extruder is the residence time.|$|E

Mixtures of semi-defatted sesame cake (SDSC) (0 – 20 %) and corn grits were processed in a single screw extruder at screw speed ranging from 324 to 387 rpm to improve the nutritional value of corn expanded <b>extrudates.</b> Chemical composition of raw and extruded materials, sectional expansion index (SEI), texture properties, color, paste viscosity, microstructure and sensory analysis of the <b>extrudates</b> were performed. The addition of SDSC increased protein, fat and ash content of corn <b>extrudates,</b> whereas carbohydrate content was reduced. The addition of SDSC reduced the sectional expansion of the corn <b>extrudates</b> and increased puncture force. SDSC–corn <b>extrudates</b> were darker than non-SDSC–corn <b>extrudates.</b> Increasing SDSC {{increased the number of}} cells similar to those of commercial corn <b>extrudates</b> with small cells.

40|$|Whole sorghum kernels were {{directly}} processed into whole grain snacks with acceptable texture. <b>Extrudates</b> made from whole sorghum had a harder gritty texture than those made from decorticated materials. Extrusion of whole sorghum provides significant savings in processing: {{there are no}} dry matter losses; no equipment or energy is required for decortication or milling; the extruder consumes less power and processes more material per time unit. In addition, the extruder utilized is a simple adiabiatic, friction extruder of relatively low cost. Grinding whole sorghum and removing fines did not improve product expansion during extrusion but altered the gritty pieces in the <b>extrudates.</b> The best products were obtained when whole sorghum (ground or un-ground) was extruded at 14 % moisture. The whole sorghum <b>extrudates</b> had larger bubbles with thick cell walls, which made <b>extrudates</b> more crunchy. Decortication of sorghum improved extrusion performance and products by allowing adequate formation and retention of air cells. Decortication to remove 20 % of the original sorghum weight was enough to produce <b>extrudates</b> with characteristics comparable to those made from commercial yellow corn meal. Sorghum milled fractions with composition and particle size distribution similar to corn meal produced <b>extrudates</b> with higher expansion, lower bulk density and similar texture. In addition, sorghum <b>extrudates</b> were rated equal to corn meal <b>extrudates</b> by a taste panel for appearance, flavor, texture and overall characteristics. <b>Extrudates</b> made from polished rice were less expanded and whiter than <b>extrudates</b> made from sorghum. When processed under similar conditions, sorghum extrusion required more energy than corn meal extrusion. However, whole sorghum extrusion required less energy than corn meal extrusion. Unground sorghum samples (decorticated or non-decorticated) produced harder <b>extrudates</b> compared to those made from ground raw material. White sorghum is a feasible option for snack extrusion because of its versatility, product characteristics, cost and processing properties...|$|R
40|$|Brown {{flaxseed}} hulls {{were added}} to de-germed corn meal and processed into <b>extrudates</b> with acceptable texture and increased nutritional benefits. The addition of brown flaxseed hulls to a corn based expanded snack increases the dietary fiber, alpha omega 3 fatty acids, and antioxidants levels. The addition of flaxseed hulls to a corn based snack can increase its susceptibility to oxidative rancidity which can limit shelf life. Whole ground tannin sorghum with added brown flaxseed hulls was processed into <b>extrudates</b> and texture, antioxidant activity, and stability were evaluated. Brown flaxseed hulls were mixed with de-germed yellow corn meal in ratios of 0 : 100, 15 : 85, 20 : 80, and 25 : 75 (w/w) and extruded with 12 and 15 % feed moistures using a twin screw extruder to produce direct expanded <b>extrudates.</b> Expansion of <b>extrudates</b> containing brown hulls decreased {{as the amount of}} hulls increased. Dried <b>extrudates</b> had acceptable flavor immediately after processing. Total phenols and antioxidant activity of <b>extrudates</b> containing 20 and 25 % brown flaxseed hulls, extruded at 15 % feed moisture were higher than de-germed corn meal extruded at 16 % feed moisture. Brown flaxseed hulls were added at 20 % to whole ground white and sumac (tannin) sorghums and processed into <b>extrudates.</b> Expansion increased for sorghum <b>extrudates</b> containing brown flaxseed hulls. The addition of brown flaxseed hulls increased antioxidant activity and total phenols of both white and sumac (tannin) <b>extrudates.</b> The sumac (tannin) <b>extrudates</b> had the longest delay in producing off odor (paintlike odor) and had the lowest p-Anisidine values compared to white (ATX 631 x RTX 436) sorghum and corn meal with added flaxseed hulls. Corn meal <b>extrudates</b> with 20 % brown flaxseed hulls produce off odors more rapidly than other <b>extrudates.</b> This suggests that the tannins in sorghum maybe extending shelf life because of their antioxidant activity. The addition of brown flaxseed hulls can be used to increase nutritional value and antioxidant levels in a direct expanded product. Also the use of tannins sorghums in products containing flaxseed may help delay oxidation, thus preventing the occurrence of off odors. Further work {{needs to be done to}} verify results...|$|R
50|$|Moisture is {{the most}} {{important}} of these factors, and affects the mix viscosity, acting to plasticize the <b>extrudate.</b> Increasing moisture will decrease viscosity, torque, and product temperature, and increase bulk density.

The use of oil palm empty fruit bunch (EFB) as fillers in the unplasticised poly (vinyl chloride) (PVC-U) is a new attraction in the polymer composite technology. The objectives of the study is to investigate the effects of EFB fillers, screw speeds and processing temperature on processability and mechanical properties of filled and impact modified PVC-U composite <b>extrudates.</b> To produce the composite <b>extrudates,</b> the PVC resin and the additives were firstly dry blended using high speed mixer before being extruded into sheets using single screw extruder. Test specimens were prepared and shaped using cutter machine after which impact, flexural and tensile properties were determined. The results showed that only EFB-filled PVC-U composite incorporated with 10 phr of filler can be extruded with the smoother surface whereas at 20 phr the <b>extrudates</b> surfaces changed to be rough. The impact strength of acrylic-impact modified and EFB-filled acrylic-impact modified <b>extrudates</b> increased while CPE-impact modified and EFB-filled <b>extrudates</b> decreased as the screw speed increased.

In terms of temperature effects, the maximum impact strength of impact modified occurred at temperature of 180 Â°C while EFB-filled and EFB-filled acrylic-impact modified occurred at 185 Â°C. The flexural modulus slightly increased while the flexural strength slightly decreased with the increase of temperature. The yield stress and yield strain of <b>extrudates</b> were insignificantly affected by screw speeds but slightly increased as temperature increased.

40|$|Whole ground white, high tannin {{and black}} sorghum {{with and without}} {{additional}} high tannin sorghum bran were used in different proportions to develop ready to eat breakfast cereals and snacks. The effect of extrusion on the phenolic compounds and on in vitro starch digestibility of sorghum based cereals and snacks were observed. Gluten free and gluten containing breakfast cereal and snacks were developed with different physical, chemical and sensory characteristic. By increasing the sorghum and bran level in the formulations, the bulk density of <b>extrudates</b> was increased while expansion ratio was decreased. Bowl life of <b>extrudates</b> was increased up to 18 min. when 60 % whole ground white sorghum was used with additional 10 % high tannin sorghum bran. Water soluble index was significantly higher for the <b>extrudates</b> without additional bran and decreased as bran was added. A positive correlation between water soluble index and expansion ratio (R^ 2 = 0. 89) indicated that the more expansion ratio provided a large surface area for water to interact with starch and other soluble components. The retention of total phenols in these <b>extrudates</b> varied from 13 - 41 % and {{it was found that}} <b>extrudates</b> with additional high tannin sorghum bran had more total phenols than <b>extrudates</b> without it. Sorghum <b>extrudates</b> showed a significant reduction in antioxidant activity varied from 21 - 83 %. Similarly, the effect of extrusion on condensed tannins was detrimental, and their retention was ranged from 12 - 28 %. The smaller particle size of ground sorghum increased the surface area of contact between composite flour components and extruder barrel which promoted interactions during extrusion, lowering condensed tannins and antioxidant activity. All sorghum based <b>extrudates</b> had significantly (P< 0. 05) lower starch digestibility than that of corn flour <b>extrudates.</b> All types of sorghum had non-significant difference in starch digestibility from 0. 5 - 2 hrs.

Whole-grain <b>extrudates</b> from white sorghum had similar sensory acceptability to those from white decorticated sorghum.

The more expanded, softer products from whole-grain tannin sorghum were obtained when the grain was cracked and sifted. Decreased expansion was caused by higher levels of fiber and greater particle sizes (as in the extruded intact grain), and by reduced particle sizes (as in the cracked non-sifted grain). Expansion was correlated to smaller air cells with smooth walls. A simple enzymatic method was developed that isolates the 'gritty' particles from whole-grain/high-fiber <b>extrudates,</b> which closely correlated with expansion.

40|$|The {{focus of}} the study was on the effects of PVA ratio (PR), screw speed (SS) and die {{temperature}} (DT) on the physical, mechanical, biodegradable properties and energy absorption behavior of corn grit/PVA cushioning <b>extrudates.</b> The experimental results indicated that PR had a significant effect on the radial expansion ratio, bulk density, compressibility. spring index and biodegradable properties. SS had a significant effect on the radial expansion ratio, compressibility, spring index, biodegradable properties and the radial expansion ratio. DT had a most significant effect on the compressibility and spring index of the <b>extrudates.</b> Corn grit blended with 5 % of PVA had the minimum total energy absorption (TEA) and energy absorption of each cycle (EAEC). All treatments of the <b>extrudates</b> had the maximum energy absorption at the crosshead speed 400 mm/min. The resultant <b>extrudates</b> were suitable for packaging applications especially cushioning materials. (c) 2004 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved...|$|R
40|$|In {{the present}} work, {{preliminary}} results of co-extrusion and spheronization of wet masses are reported. A ram co-extruder, manufactured in-house, was designed with two concentric single dies mounted on two concentric and independent chambers. This equipment {{has allowed the}} production of three types of <b>extrudates.</b> (rod or solid <b>extrudates,</b> tubular or hollow <b>extrudates.</b> and co-extrudates). Different wet mixtures of microcrystalline cellulose, lactose, a non-soluble in water dye and water were produced and used to feed the chambers of the ram co-extruder. Extrusions of the wet masses were carried out at different speeds of the ram (25 - 400 mm/min). The <b>extrudates</b> were evaluated according to surface characteristics (by visual inspection), force of extrusion and duration of steady-state (after recording the force applied to the ram and its displacement). Simultaneously, for each process of extrusion {{it was possible to}} assess the angles of convergence {{to the bottom of the}} chambers for both the external and internal chambers. These angles reflected the high complexity of the extrusion occurring on the external chamber in consequence of its annular geometry, in which the bisecting-line was not parallel to the axis of the extruder, by opposition to the converging angle in the internal chamber, where the bisecting-line was perfectly aligned to the axis of the extruder. Variations in the amount of water in the formulations and the speed of extrusion affected both the production and the quality of the <b>extrudates</b> and their ability to provide pellets. The rod <b>extrudates</b> were the easiest to produce and the relationships between the formulations, the processing conditions and the properties of the <b>extrudates</b> were immediately apparent. On the other hand, co-extrudates were more complex to characterise, although identical relationships between formulations, processing conditions and the properties of the co-extrudates were observed as for the rod <b>extrudates.</b> Different batches of <b>extrudates</b> (rod, tubular and co-extrudates) were spheronized to a maximum spheronization time of 10 min at 1000 rpm. The pellets were characterized with respect to size, size distribution, sphericity and density. Results have shown that for a larger diameter of the co-extrudates, the pellets produced were bigger (approximate to 3. 38 mm) than the pellets produced from rod <b>extrudates</b> (1. 22 mm). For longer times of spheronization, the aspect ratio and the density increased for both pellets produced from rod (0. 95 and 1. 46 g/cm(3)) and co-extrudates (0. 90 and 1. 47 g/cm(3)). The study has shown the potential of this new technology in providing a product with advantages over the traditional spheres produced by extrusion and spheronization. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science B. V.
