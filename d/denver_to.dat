5|$|Stastny {{entered the}} University of <b>Denver</b> <b>to</b> {{play for the}} Pioneers in the Western Collegiate Hockey Association of the National Collegiate Athletic Association in 2004. Despite {{entering}} college hockey younger than the usual USHL player, he scored 45 points in 42 games {{in his first season}} in <b>Denver</b> <b>to</b> help the Pioneers win the MacNaughton Cup and Broadmoor Trophy. He then helped the team win its second NCAA Men's Ice Hockey Championship in a row by scoring two power-play goals in the final game at the 2005 Frozen Four tournament against North Dakota. Stastny won the award for WCHA Rookie of the Year and was part of the WCHA All-Rookie Team and the NCAA Championship All-Tournament Team.|$|E
5|$|Geography {{also allows}} <b>Denver</b> <b>to</b> have a {{considerable}} government presence, with many federal agencies based or having {{offices in the}} Denver area. Along with federal agencies come many companies based on US defense and space projects, and more jobs are brought to the city {{by virtue of its}} being the capital of the state of Colorado. The Denver area is home to the former nuclear weapons plant Rocky Flats, the Denver Federal Center, Byron G. Rogers Federal Building and United States Courthouse, the Denver Mint, and the National Renewable Energy Laboratory.|$|E
5|$|The orchestra, {{conducted}} by Gilbert Levine, performed in <b>Denver</b> <b>to</b> mark Pope John Paul II's visit for World Youth Day in 1993. That same year it had relocated to Breckenridge, Colorado following the town's invitation {{to become part}} of its summer Breckenridge Music Festival. Since that time, the Riverwalk Center, a 750-seat facility on the shores of the Blue River, has been the NRO's main performance base.|$|E

5|$|Although by {{the close}} of the 1860s, Denver {{residents}} could look with pride at their success establishing a vibrant supply and service center, the decision to route the nation's first transcontinental railroad through Cheyenne, rather than Denver, threatened the prosperity of the young town. A daunting 100 miles away, citizens mobilized to build a railroad to connect <b>Denver</b> <b>to</b> the transcontinental railroad. Spearheaded by visionary leaders including Territorial Governor John Evans, David Moffat, and Walter Cheesman, fundraising began. Within three days, $300,000 had been raised, and citizens were optimistic. Fundraising stalled before enough was raised, forcing these visionary leaders {{to take control of the}} debt-ridden railroad. Despite challenges, on June 24, 1870, citizens cheered as the Denver Pacific completed the link to the transcontinental railroad, ushering in a new age of prosperity for Denver.|$|E
5|$|By 1976, both leagues {{were dealing}} with serious {{financial}} problems. The St. Louis Blues {{were on the verge}} of bankruptcy. Talk of a merger between the NHL and the WHA was growing. In 1976, for the first time in four decades, the NHL approved franchise relocations; the Scouts moved after just two years in Kansas City to <b>Denver</b> <b>to</b> become the Colorado Rockies, while the California Golden Seals became the Cleveland Barons. Two years later, after failed overtures about merging the Barons with Washington and Vancouver, the Barons merged with the Minnesota North Stars, reducing the NHL to 17 teams for 1978–79.|$|E
5|$|In 1989, Maggie Roswell {{was hired}} {{for the first}} season of The Simpsons. She played a few minor {{characters}} until she became a regular cast member {{with the introduction of}} Maude Flanders in the second season. In 1994, Roswell and her husband Hal Rayle moved from Los Angeles to <b>Denver</b> <b>to</b> raise their daughter. Together they established the Roswell 'n' Rayle Company, creating and voicing advertisements for companies. Because of her move to Denver, Roswell had to travel to Los Angeles twice a week to tape The Simpsons. This ultimately led to her requesting a pay raise in 1999; however, Fox refused to offer her the amount she wanted so she quit the show. Roswell returned to The Simpsons in 2002 after reaching a deal to record her lines from her Denver home.|$|E

5|$|On {{the morning}} of 20 May, a meeting was held in Southery, Norfolk. The group, {{including}} a Thomas Sindall, marched through <b>Denver</b> <b>to</b> Downham Market {{to meet with the}} magistrates at their weekly meeting at The Crown public house. Sindall was the only person known to have been at both the riots at Downham Market and Littleport. He was killed by troopers at Littleport—see below. The mob of 1,500, mainly men but some women, besieged The Crown until the magistrates agreed to allow a deputation of eight rioters inside to make their pleas: to have work and two-shillings (£) per day. The magistrates acceded to these demands, but they had already called the yeoman cavalry from Upwell, who arrived at 5pm. Backed by the troops, the Riot Act was then read in the market place by Reverend Dering, causing further tussles, which subsided after arrests started to be made.|$|E
5|$|The {{move towards}} a merger {{picked up in}} 1977 when John Ziegler succeeded Clarence Campbell as NHL president. The WHA folded {{following}} the 1978–79 season, while the Edmonton Oilers, Hartford Whalers, Quebec Nordiques and Winnipeg Jets joined the NHL as expansion teams, which brought the league up to 21 teams, a constant until 1991. The merger brought Gordie Howe back to the NHL for one final season in 1979–80, during which he brought his NHL career total to 801 goals and 1,850 points. It was also the last season for the Atlanta Flames. The team averaged only 9,800 fans in attendance and lost over $2million. They were sold for a record $16million, and relocated north to become the Calgary Flames in 1980–81. Two years later, the Rockies were sold for $30million, and left <b>Denver</b> <b>to</b> become the New Jersey Devils for the 1982–83 season.|$|E
5|$|To {{catch the}} public's attention, this train {{was not simply}} rolled out of the factory; it made a dash {{from one end of}} the CB, in <b>Denver,</b> <b>to</b> the other, in Chicago on May 26, 1934. The {{railroad}} spared no expense in planning the operations. All other trains along the Zephyrs route were diverted to sidings and the turnouts were spiked into the proper alignment for the Zephyrs run. Track and maintenance of way workers checked every spike and bolt along the train's route to ensure that there would not be any problems, and temporary speed signs were installed along the route to warn the Zephyrs crew of curves that would be dangerous at high speeds. On the day of the dash, every road grade crossing was manned by a flagman to stop automobile traffic ahead of the train and to ensure that the crossing was clear. Stations along the route were protected by local police officers and members of the American Legion and the Boy Scouts of America.|$|E

5|$|Like {{with many}} large {{cities in the}} United States, Denver’s CBD and the {{adjacent}} neighborhoods were blighted {{with the presence of}} many open parking lots in the 1970s and 80’s. Recent focus to redevelop these open lots and increase density/activity in the city’s core have been hugely successful as many of these lots are today being turned into large residential, retail and commercial developments. This is especially true around the newly redeveloped and highly popular Union Station area in Denver’s LoDo (Lower Downtown) neighborhood. What used to be open land, parking lots, warehouses and rail yards as recently as {{the turn of the century}} is now several city blocks of new residential and commercial buildings as well as a new RTD underground bus terminal, rail platforms/pavilions and a park. There are also improved pedestrian friendly connections to the RiNo (River North), Five Points, Auraria and Highland neighborhoods from the new development. Historic Union Station itself has been fully renovated and turned back into a travel and activity hub. It now includes the Denver Amtrak station, a new boutique hotel and several restaurants, bars & shops all centered on the large Great Hall inside and a public plaza outside along Wynkoop Street. Starting in April 2016 the University of Colorado A-Line commuter train began service directly connecting Union Station and downtown <b>Denver</b> <b>to</b> Denver International Airport and the airport's new 500+ room Westin Hotel & conference center.|$|E

25|$|Although Moffat was {{looked at}} the time as a vain dreamer, he would later be looked at by many as ahead of his time. His legacy would leave Denver and Rio Grande Western Railroad and later Union Pacific with a {{railroad}} that would outlast most other rail lines in Colorado. Other than the Rollins Pass part, all of the railroad is in use today as part of the Central Corridor, and the <b>Denver</b> <b>to</b> Phippsburg part is called Moffat Tunnel Subdivision.|$|E
25|$|Tampa Bay {{took the}} second half kickoff, but was forced to punt. Josh Bidwell pinned the Broncos at their own 4-yard line.

The resulting good field possession allowed <b>Denver</b> <b>to</b> punt, and pin Tampa Bay at their own 11. Brian Griese threw an incompletion, and suffered an injured shoulder on the play. Jeff Garcia took over at quarterback.|$|E
