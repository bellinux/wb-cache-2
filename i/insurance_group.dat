The insurance industry also became important to the local economy as several companies established headquarters in Columbia, including Shelter Insurance, Missouri Employers Mutual, and Columbia <b>Insurance</b> <b>Group.</b> State Farm Insurance has a regional office in Columbia. In addition, the now defunct Silvey Insurance was once a large local employer. Columbia became a transportation crossroads when U.S. Route 63 and U.S. Route 40 (which became present-day Interstate 70) were routed through the city. Soon after, the city opened the Columbia Regional Airport. By 2000, the city's population was nearly 85,000.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{analyses}} {{the degree}} of internationalisation of insurance business. Using a novel data set of 25 large EU <b>insurance</b> <b>groups,</b> {{we find that the}} insurance industry has a strong international orientation. About 55 percent of the business of these large <b>insurance</b> <b>groups</b> is conducted abroad. The cross-border activities are predominantly within Europe (30 - 35 percent) and less so {{in the rest of the}} world (20 - 25 percent). Next, this paper examines the impact of internationalisation on the organisational structure. We find a clear trend towards centralising risk and capital management activities within large <b>insurance</b> <b>groups,</b> though <b>insurance</b> remains at the same time a local business. Applying the hub and spoke model, we identify which functions are executed at the centre (hub) and which functions are performed at the level of the local business units (spokes). © 2008 The International Association for the Study of Insurance Economics...|$|R
5|$|From its inception, the Waldorf Astoria gained {{international}} renown for its lavish {{dinner parties}} and galas, {{often at the}} center of political and business conferences and fundraising schemes involving the rich and famous. Particularly after World War II it {{played a significant role in}} world politics and the Cold War, culminating in the controversial World Peace Conference of March 1949 at the hotel, in which Stalinism was widely denounced. Conrad Hilton acquired management rights to the hotel on October 12, 1949, and the Hilton Hotels Corporation finally bought the hotel outright in 1972. It underwent a $150 million renovation by Lee Jablin in the 1980s and early 1990s, and in October 2014 it was announced that the Anbang <b>Insurance</b> <b>Group</b> of China had purchased the Waldorf Astoria New York for US$1.95 billion, making it the most expensive hotel ever sold. On July 1, 2016, Anbang announced that it would convert some of the Waldorf's hotel rooms into condominiums, closing the hotel for a three-year renovation on March 1, 2017.|$|E
5|$|Portsmouth was {{affected}} by the British Empire's decline {{in the latter half}} of the 20th century. Shipbuilding jobs fell from 46% of workforce in 1951 to 14% in 1966, drastically reducing the manpower in the dockyard. The city council attempted to create new work; an industrial estate was built in Fratton in 1948, and others were built at Paulsgrove and Farlington in the 1950s and 1960s, respectively. Traditional industries such as brewing and corset making disappeared during this time, though electrical engineering became a major employer. Despite the cutbacks made to traditional sectors, Portsmouth still remained an attractive place for industry. In 1968, Zurich <b>Insurance</b> <b>Group</b> moved their UK headquarters to the city, with IBM relocating their European headquarters in 1979. The population of the city had dropped from approximately 200,000 to 177,142 by the end of the 1960s. In the early 1980s, then Defence Secretary John Nott concluded that of the four home dockyards, both Portsmouth and Chatham would be closed. However, Portsmouth City Council won a concession, and rather than face closure, the dockyard was downgraded to a naval base.|$|E

40|$|In {{financial}} conglomerates and <b>insurance</b> <b>groups,</b> enterprise risk management {{is becoming increasingly}} important in controlling and managing the different independent legal entities in the group.

We further examine the impact of the type of dependence structure on results by comparing linear and nonlinear dependencies using different copula concepts under certain distributional assumptions. Our results show that even if financial groups with different dependence structures do have the same risk concentration factor, joint default probabilities of different sets of subsidiaries can vary tremendously...|$|R
