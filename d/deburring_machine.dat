40|$|Volvo Aero has {{recently}} {{invested in a}} new production cell containing ten resources. The production cell is supposed {{to carry out a}} large variety of jobs since ve of the resources are multipurpose machines that are able to process three di erent types of operations. The cell contains, except from the multipurpose machines, three set up and tear down stations, one automatic <b>deburring</b> <b>machine</b> and one manual deburring station. The purpose of the thesis was to study how the jobs will be scheduled with the default priority function that is delivered with the multitask cell, compared to optimal scheduling and see if there is any unused potential. To study this a mathematical model was implemented in AMPL together with numerous heuristics trying to do the scheduling as well as possible, in a reasonable amount of time. The focus of the heuristics has been to minimize the total lateness, a variable that Volvo Aero wants to keep as low as possible. The scheduling problem can be described as a job shop problem with multipurpose machines which is among the hardest combinatorial problems within optimization...|$|E

40|$|AbstractNowadays {{industrial}} robots are an appropriate technology for developing flexible and reconfigurable manufacturing systems which contribute to perform automatically operation such as milling, cutting, drilling, grinding, <b>deburring</b> and polishing. <b>Machining</b> robots symbolize a cost-saving and flexible alternative compared to conventional CNC machines {{which are the}} restricted working area and produced shape limitations. The improvement of individual elements and development of new devices has caused a perception change {{about the use of}} {{industrial robots}} to perform machining operations. The approach to this research was to analyze technical barriers of individual components that it was broken-down as well as full improving the system. This document is intended to provide technical constraints, current technology and future potential researches about robotic machining...|$|R
40|$|Graduation date: 2017 Access {{restricted}} to the Administrator, at author's request, from 2017 - 06 - 26 to 2017 - 12 - 26 <b>Deburring</b> of <b>machined</b> parts is a crucial task in the aerospace and automotive industry. This process is still performed manually {{to a large extent}} due to the unpredictability of burr formation as well as the complex interactions between the human arm and the workpiece. Poor ergonomics, repetitive stress and strain injuries for the human operators, as well as high cost are all reasons to automate this process. In this work, we first study how skilled operators perform deburring, which is a hybrid force and position control task, by using a motion capture system, force sensor and an IMU to record and recreate the process. Next, we explore the interaction dynamics and explain the importance of the dynamic characteristics of a spring-mass system to successfully deburr an edge. We come up with control strategies that allow a backdrivable robot to accomplish the same task using a hybrid controller made up of a sliding mode controller and a proportional controller acting in parallel...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. Remained burrs on {{edges of}} the parts after metal cutting {{operations}} may cause many problems in the production process and {{in the quality of}} products, therefore the burrs must be completely removed. In the paper, the authors give an outline of the elements and the technical and economical influences of the burr formation, and the characteristics of the burrs and the burr formation mechanisms. The authors present some special processes that are suitable for deburring of small pieces (e. g. Magnetic Abrasive Deburring), and a frequently applied mechanical process: power brushing. The authors have carried out many investigations regarding the magnetic abrasive deburring of small, blanked sheet metal parts, furthermore the <b>machine</b> <b>deburring</b> of large-sized metal workpieces by carbide-reinforced cylindrical brushes. The detailed conditions, data, results and conclusions of these deburring experiments are treated in the paper too...|$|R
40|$|Although {{deburring}} {{technology is}} used in precision manufacturing and high-quality <b>machining,</b> <b>deburring</b> is still considered a difficult problem. Precision parts require care to achieve precise dimensions and surface quality and in subsequent finishing operations. Deburring and edge finishing typically receive little attention from designers and manufacturing engineers. Due to deburring difficulties, it can {{account for more than}} 30 % of the total production cost when components are small. Efficient and effective deburring of miniature and/or precision components is very difficult. Therefore, this work applies a highly efficient and fully automatic novel electrochemical system that uses a rotating barrel. The effects of the main factors, such as barrel rotational speed, electrical current density, electrolyte temperature and process time, are investigated. Finally, optimal conditions are identified by applying the design of experiment to the required edge quality. The burrs on brass gears are dissolved and removed properly and the radius of the fillet of the gears after deburring has a small standard deviation of 5. 9 Î¼m within only 5 minutes when using the proposed system of a rotational barrel with electrochemical deburring. This electrochemical system is an effective and efficient system to remove burrs from miniature metal parts...|$|R
