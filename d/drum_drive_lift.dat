50|$|Ari's {{life without}} Dante {{revolves}} around learning to <b>drive,</b> <b>lifting</b> weights, running with Legs, {{trying to find}} information about his brother at the library, arguing with Gina and Susie, trying to run into Ileana at school, reading Dante's letters, having bad dreams, and working a part-time job at a burger joint called The Charcoaler. He writes this list down in his journal.|$|R
50|$|Torque balance was {{provided}} by slightly inclining each rotor axis to generate horizontal thrust components to provide anti-torque moments. The three rotor configuration was foreseen by Belgian helicopter experimenter Nicolas Florine in his patent of 1926 which presented the aforementioned means for balancing the reaction on the fuselage {{of two or more}} torque <b>driven</b> <b>lifting</b> rotors turning in the same direction.|$|R
50|$|In the era {{of sailing}} ships, the {{introduction}} of a worm drive to control the rudder was a significant advance. Prior to its introduction, a rope <b>drum</b> <b>drive</b> controlled the rudder. Rough seas could apply substantial force to the rudder, often requiring several men to steer the vessel—some drives had two large-diameter wheels so up to four crewmen could operate the rudder.|$|R
50|$|The <b>drum</b> <b>driven</b> polyrhythm melody line is {{accompanied}} by chanting, singing, howling and occasional yelling. Another feature is the nostalgic feeling of searching, somehow out of time and place, rarely in response to man's desires. In this music {{the quest for a}} personal truth and realization is revealed and sometimes interpreted as a symbolic journey, a lonely one, intimate, thoroughly lived and passionate.|$|R
2500|$|A {{distinct}} form of traction engine, characterised by {{the provision}} of a large diameter winding <b>drum</b> <b>driven</b> by separate gearing from the steam engine. [...] Onto the drum a long length of wire rope was wound, which was used to haul an implement, such as a plough, across a field, while the engine remained on the headland. This minimized the area of land subject to soil compaction.|$|R

50|$|After {{ascending}} {{the curving}} wheel <b>driven</b> <b>lift</b> hill, the train descends a sharp, twisting left-hand drop (sometimes {{referred to as}} a Traver drop) that climbs up to the first of four stacked block brakes. The train negotiates a second left-hand drop that is immediately followed by two vertical loops. The aforementioned process happens yet again, but the height of the coaster is decreased and the next loop is a single one.|$|R
5000|$|Lightning Bolt - An indoor, space-themed {{roller coaster}} {{designed}} by Intamin. It featured a 35 ft tire <b>drive</b> <b>lift,</b> {{with a top}} speed of 35 mph. The ending was promoted as a [...] "fly-by" [...] of the Las Vegas Strip, which was essentially a large model constructed {{on the floor next to}} the brake run. In 1997, the roller coaster was moved outdoors, and was made to be twice as long.|$|R
5000|$|The album met {{positive}} reviews, with Paste Magazine rating it 7.6/10, adding: [...] "In lesser hands, {{songs of}} this nature could take on the tone of self-help books, maxims of dubious value. But Pug’s honesty and wordplay combine to levitate the songs over those empty, clichéd realms. And the straightforward, balanced arrangements of acoustic and electric guitars and upright bass, with occasional piano, harmonica and <b>drums,</b> <b>drive</b> the focus to Pug’s vocals." ...|$|R
5000|$|The album saw {{the band}} re-introduce {{the use of}} <b>drums,</b> <b>driven</b> in part by Rick Kemp's {{background}} in rock. After the album was released, the band undertook a US tour, opening for Jethro Tull. Because of this, the band decided to add a full-time drummer {{in the person of}} Nigel Pegrum. The drums took the band further in the direction of rock, as demonstrated by [...] "The Wee Wee Man" [...] and [...] "Cam Ye O'er Frae France." ...|$|R

40|$|Haas Automation, Inc. {{is one of}} {{the largest}} CNC machine tool {{builders}} in the world. They produce an assortment of machines that come in many different sizes, however, all machines have in common the central tool that allows them to perform their surfacing and bore functions, the spindle. As with the machines themselves, the spindles can also range in size depending on the type of machine they are going into. These spindles are assembled step by step and as components are added to them, several models become so heavy that it is not feasible to have operators lift them by hand; alternative methods must be used to transport them. Because of potential injuries and part damage risk, Haas has decided that it is not prudent to subject their workers to moving their 40 ‐Taper spindles by hand, which weigh approximately fifty pounds. In working with Haas Automation to develop a solution to this problem, several potential solutions were considered, including a Hydraulic Crane System, Air Pressure <b>driven</b> <b>lifts</b> as well as a simple pedal and gear <b>driven</b> <b>lift.</b> A cost‐benefit analysis and general feasibility of each system shows which works best for Haas and its operators, followed by the design, build and testing of the winning solution...|$|R
50|$|The Dresden Dolls are {{arguably the}} most commercially {{successful}} dark cabaret band, bringing more mainstream attention to the still fairly underground genre. Their piano and <b>drum</b> <b>driven</b> rock music, incorporated into alternative rock song structures with piano replacing the rhythm guitar, has seen them fall into the piano rock genre. In her influences, Palmer named Cyndi Lauper, Laurie Anderson, Kate Bush and Siouxsie Sioux. She was also inspired {{by the likes of}} Bauhaus, The Cure, The Legendary Pink Dots, Robyn Hitchcock and Nick Cave.|$|R

50|$|The Saltaire Volunteer Fire Company, Inc., was {{established}} in 1969 to provide fire suppression services to the village. In 1986, the fire company became the first Fire Island fire department to provide Emergency Medical Services to the village and surrounding communities. The department currently has two (pumper) engines, one utility rescue truck, two fire/EMS first response Mules, one ambulance, one EMS transport vehicle and a Chief's/personnel vehicle. These vehicles are often modified {{for use in the}} unique Fire Island geography with four-wheel <b>drive,</b> <b>lifted</b> suspensions, and large-diameter tires.|$|R
5000|$|... "Born Free" [...] was {{her next}} release {{following}} the track [...] "O...Saya" [...] {{from the film}} Slumdog Millionaire {{and the birth of}} her son in 2009. The song is a guitar and <b>drum</b> <b>driven</b> track that incorporates electronica, alternative hip hop and horrorcore, and is considered more aggressive than the other songs of the album. High Contrast provided an official remix to the song. The song was praised for its lyrics and composition as statement-making and provocatively complimentary to the artist's intentions for the piece, its artwork and accompanying video.|$|R

5000|$|Once the coaster train {{exits the}} station, It makes a left hand, 180 degree turn , and climbs the 24 ft, tire <b>driven</b> <b>lift</b> hill. Once at the top, the train travels {{a few feet}} of {{straight}} track before dropping 22.5 ft at a 45 degree angle. The train then travels up a tight, left banked, 540 degree, upwards helix. The train then enters a hill that crosses over a guest pathway. After that the train travels through a tight, right banked, 360 degree, downwards helix. The train then re-enters the station and is stopped by the magnetic brakes.|$|R
2500|$|He {{wanted to}} be an airpilot, but he couldn't make it because of his daltonism. [...] Unlike his friends, he was never {{attracted}} by soccer and he preferred waterpolo and hockey instead, which he used to practice at River Plate, a few blocks away from his home. He started to practice <b>drums</b> <b>driven</b> by his father Tito Alberti.

40|$|An {{abradable}} buffered {{labyrinth seal}} {{for the control}} of turbine gas path leakage in a tip-turbine <b>driven</b> <b>lift</b> fan was designed, tested, and analyzed. The seal configuration was not designed to operate in any specific location but was sized to be evaluated in an existing test rig. The final sealing diameter selected was 28 inches. Results of testing indicate that the flow equations predicted seal air flows consistent with measured values. Excellent sealing characteristics of the abradable coating on the stator land were demonstrated when a substantial seal penetration of. 030 inch into the land surface was encountered without appreciable wear on the labyrinth knife edges...|$|R

50|$|The {{historic}} lift to Ostrau is a 50 metre high, free-standing iron construction, {{that links}} {{the village of}} Ostrau higher up the hill. The hotelier, Rudolf Sendig, had this electrically <b>driven</b> <b>lift</b> built in 1904 by the firms of Kelle & Hildebrandt (iron framework) and Kühnscherf & Söhne (lift). The lift was officially opened on Easter Sunday 1905 and the rivetted structure, that has been protected since 1954, was refurbished in 1989-1990. Due to its view over Saxon Switzerland around Bad Schandau, especially the rocks of the Schrammsteine, {{but also because of}} the understated art nouveau ornamentation a journey on the technical monument {{has become something of a}} tourist attraction.|$|R
40|$|Abstract: This paper {{develops}} a detailed mathematical {{model of a}} casting <b>drum</b> <b>drive</b> in a web production process. The drive uses a at belt to connect the casting drum itself to a drive and a brake pulley. The model includes mechanical effects, such as creep and slip between the belt and pulleys, and its parameters are obtained {{by a combination of}} calculations and experimental tests. Experimental results from a laboratory-scale model of a commercial casting drum system are used to validate the model under steady-state and transient conditions. A companion paper describes the model’s application in new controller strategies, which signicantly reduce drum speed variations caused by web tension changes...|$|R

50|$|As {{the train}} {{comes out of}} the station, it makes a 90 degree turn to the right, and starts up the tire <b>drive</b> <b>lift</b> hill. As the train exits the lift hill, it is sent on a double helix to the left. From there, the train makes its way under the lift hill and over {{to the top of the}} station, making the riders feel as if they could touch it with their feet. Then it turns right and travels {{alongside}} of the lift hill and then turns right 180 degrees. At this point the train is very close to the ground. Then, it turns 180 degrees to the left into the activating brakes.|$|R
5000|$|The United States Navy {{initiated}} the SES model test program in 1960. By 1963, a 10-ton test craft called the XR-1 {{was designed and}} built to test the surface effect concept. The first version of the XR-1 used fixed plywood seals at the fore and aft ends of the captured air bubble section. A jet engine providing 1700 pounds of thrust was used for main propulsion. A separate [...] gas engine was used to <b>drive</b> <b>lift</b> fans, and also to power out-drive units that were used for off-cushion slow-speed maneuvering.

40|$|This thesis {{describes}} {{the design and}} analysis of an efficient, yet low cost, <b>drum</b> <b>driven</b> window actuation system for an automotive power window. The design uses a novel approach that involves using cables to both actuate and constrain the window. Test units were constructed and cycled well beyond the typical life expectancy of a window actuator, demonstrating that this technology is robust enough to {{be considered as a}} replacement for current mechanisms. Variations on the design that may produce either better longevity or higher efficiency are also presented, along with the tradeoffs that must be considered. by Keith V. Durand. Thesis (S. M.)
