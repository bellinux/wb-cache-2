Dispersive, nonlinear wave propagation in high current beams {{is found to}} be similar to ion-acoustic waves in plasmas with an analogy between Debye screening and beam pipe shielding. Exact longitudinal solitary wave propagation is found for potentials associated with certain transverse distributions which fill the beam pipe. For weak dispersion, the waves satisfy the Korteweg-deVries (KdV) equation, but for strong dispersion they exhibit breaking.

40|$|Background: Given the {{low levels}} of {{financial}} literacy in South Africa, financial education projects have a significant {{role to play in}} reducing some of the demand side barriers to financial inclusion. Measuring the impact of a financial education project is important to assess whether the project achieves its ultimate objectives, for <b>justifying</b> <b>scaling</b> up and for policy design. However, impact evaluations alone are not sufficient in describing {{the success or failure of}} a project. Objectives: This study aims to show that, particularly in a South African context, where investment in financial education interventions is mandated by the Financial Sector Codes, impact should not be the only criterion assessed when evaluating financial education projects. Research method and design: This study was informed by a literature review, a synthesis of team experience on a range of financial education projects in South Africa and the development of case studies. Results: Describing the success or failure of a project needs to go beyond impact and explore factors such as project relevance, design and quality. In order to verify these other factors, different types of evaluations are necessary at the various stages of the project’s life-cycle. Conclusion: Expanding the learning objective beyond the exclusive identification of whether financial behaviour was achieved is particularly important where financial education projects, and the monitoring and evaluation thereof, is mandated. In the African context, where resources are scarce, money for monitoring and evaluation should be selectively channelled into determining project relevance, effectiveness, efficiency and then only impact. </p...|$|R

40|$|To {{elucidate}} microscopic {{details of}} proton cancer therapy (PCT), we apply the simplest-level electron nuclear dynamics (SLEND) method to H+ + (H 2 O) 1 - 6 at ELab = 100 keV. These systems are computationally tractable prototypes to simulate water radiolysis reactions-i. e. the PCT processes that generate the DNA-damaging species against cancerous cells. To capture incipient bulk-water effects, ten (H 2 O) 1 - 6 isomers are considered, ranging from quasi-planar/multiplanar (H 2 O) 1 - 6 to "smallest-drop" prism and cage (H 2 O) 6 structures. SLEND is a time-dependent, variational, non-adiabatic and direct method that adopts a nuclear classical-mechanics description and an electronic single-determinantal wavefunction in the Thouless representation. Short-time SLEND/ 6 - 31 G* (n = 1 - 6) and / 6 - 31 G** (n = 1 - 5) simulations render cluster-to-projectile 1 -electron-transfer (1 -ET) total integral cross sections (ICSs) and 1 -ET probabilities. In absolute quantitative terms, SLEND/ 6 - 31 G* 1 -ET ICS compares satisfactorily with alternative experimental and theoretical results only available for n = 1 and exhibits {{almost the same}} accuracy of the best alternative theoretical result. SLEND/ 6 - 31 G** overestimates 1 -ET ICS for n = 1, but a comparable overestimation is also observed with another theoretical method. An investigation on H+ + H indicates that electron direct ionization (DI) becomes significant with the large virtual-space quasi-continuum in large basis sets; thus, SLEND/ 6 - 31 G** 1 -ET ICS is overestimated by DI contributions. The {{solution to this problem}} is discussed.

We further estimated the contribution of mental health comorbidities to these disparities in health care costs, employment and earnings.

The method we propose for call acceptance and routing does not require models describing the trafflc. Each switch estimates the additional fraction of cells that would be lost if new calls were routed through the switch. The routing algorithm uses these estimates. The estimates are obtained by monitoring the switch operations and extrapo-lating to the situation where more calls are routed through the switch. The extrapolation is <b>justified</b> by a <b>scaling</b> prop-erty. To reduce the variance of the estimates, the switches calculate the cell loss that would occur with virtual buffers.

Decoy raids by Bomber Command on Aunay-sur-Odon and Evrecy, caused 29 casualties, destroyed a Tiger tank and damaged three more. Artillery harassing fire was maintained north and south of the withdrawal route but the Germans did little to intervene. The Germans had lost 700-800 casualties and 8-20 tanks, including several Tigers; British casualties were light and only three tanks were lost. Reynolds called the German casualty figures [...] "exaggerated" [...] and in his report, Hinde wrote [...] "It is questionable whether the expenditure of artillery and small arms ammunition was <b>justified</b> by the <b>scale</b> of the enemy's efforts".|$|R
