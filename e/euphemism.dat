5|$|Freedom fries was a {{political}} <b>euphemism</b> for French fries in the United States. The term came to prominence in 2003 when the then Republican Chairman of the Committee on House Administration, Bob Ney, renamed the menu item in three Congressional cafeterias in response to France's opposition to the proposed invasion of Iraq. Although originally supported with several restaurants changing their menus as well, the term fell out of use due to declining support for the Iraq War. Following Ney's resignation as Chairman in 2006, it was quietly reverted.|$|E
5|$|Humour {{magazine}} Fuddle Duddle, {{named after}} a famous <b>euphemism</b> by then-Prime Minister Pierre Trudeau, was a short lived attempt at a Canadian Mad-style satirical magazine. It was the first comic book of Canadian content to be available on newsstands since 1956. Two of its contributors, Peter Evans and Stanley Berneche, would soon go on to bring superheroes back to Canada {{for the first time}} since the demise of Nelvana in 1947, with Captain Canuck.|$|E
5|$|Sonderbehandlung is a German noun meaning special {{treatment}} in English. While it {{can refer to}} any sort of preferential treatment, it is known primarily as a <b>euphemism</b> for mass murder used by Nazi functionaries and the SS, who commonly used the abbreviation S.B. in documentation. It first came to prominence during Action T4, where SS doctors killed mentally ill and disabled patients between 1939 and 1941, {{and was one of}} a number of nonspecific words the Nazis used to document mass murder and genocide. Another notable example was Sonderbehandlung 14f13.|$|E
40|$|The use of <b>euphemisms</b> is {{a common}} {{linguistic}} phenomenon in all languages. By using <b>euphemisms,</b> people can indirectly and politely express their ideas, without making the listeners feel awkward and unpleasant. As a mirror of culture, the generation and development of <b>euphemisms</b> {{are closely related to}} culture. <b>Euphemisms</b> in English and Chinese are also abundant, but they have both differences and similarities in expressions and cultural connotations. The cross-cultural contrastive study of English and Chinese <b>euphemisms</b> can help people correctly understand the deep meaning in English and Chinese languages and overcome the obstacles in cross-cultural communications.

40|$|Political <b>euphemisms</b> are {{a special}} kind of <b>euphemisms,</b> whose {{inherent}} properties can not be fully clarified only from the linguistic viewpoint. The paper, from the viewpoint of political linguistics, taking political <b>euphemisms</b> as a language means used to manipulate consciousness, probes the semantic features and social functions of political <b>euphemisms</b> and analyses the motives in using them, in order that a fresh viewpoint is tried in studying the social linguistic phenomenon. 政治委婉语是一类特殊的委婉语，纯粹从语言学角度远不能 揭示其本质特征。本文从政治语言学的视角，将政治委婉语视为一种用 于操纵意识的语言手段，探讨其语义特征及其行使的社会功能，分析使 用政治委婉语的动机，以期从崭新的角度解读这一社会语言现象...|$|R

5|$|The Kurdish {{geographical}} name changes were exempt under the Ottoman Empire {{due to the}} Islamic religious orientation of Kurds. During the Republican era and especially after the Dersim massacre, Kurdish {{geographical name}} changes became more common. During the Turkish Republican era, the words Kurdistan and Kurds were banned. The Turkish government had disguised {{the presence of the}} Kurds statistically by categorizing them as Mountain Turks. This classification was changed to the new <b>euphemism</b> of Eastern Turk in 1980.|$|E
5|$|With the SA {{out of the}} way, Heydrich began {{building}} the Gestapo into an instrument of fear. He improved his index-card system, creating categories of offenders with colour-coded cards. The Gestapo {{had the authority to}} arrest citizens on the suspicion that they might commit a crime, and the definition of a crime was at their discretion. The Gestapo Law, passed in 1936, gave police the right to act extra-legally. This led to the sweeping use of Schutzhaft—"protective custody", a <b>euphemism</b> for the power to imprison people without judicial proceedings. The courts were not allowed to investigate or interfere. The Gestapo was considered to be acting legally {{as long as it was}} carrying out the leadership's will. People were arrested arbitrarily, sent to concentration camps, or killed.|$|E
5|$|But Beyoncé is {{far from}} being all sentiment. Because a large part of being Beyoncé in America in 2013 is being a sexual {{creature}} and not only being unafraid of that fact, but reveling— and reveling confidently— in it. The amorphous, shifting Houston-trap-meets-Noah Shebib trunk rattler 'Partition' exemplifies this particular sentiment. On the track, the Queen Bey tells her driver to put the partition up because 'I don’t need you seeing 'Yoncé on her knees'; uses Monica Lewinsky as a <b>euphemism</b> for her man finishing on her clothing; reveals that 'he like to call me Peaches when we get this nasty'; and repeats that it took her '45 minutes to get all dressed up / and we ain’t even gonna make it to this club'. And in maybe the wildest moment in an album full of bold moves, Beyoncé actually slips in the French translation of Julianne Moore's 'Feminists love sex' monologue from The Big Lebowski.|$|E
30|$|<b>Euphemisms</b> are {{believed}} to serve both those who produce them (speakers and writers) and those who receive them (listeners and readers). Linfoot-Ham (2005, p. 228) believes that <b>euphemisms</b> “protect the speaker/writer, hearer/reader, {{or all of the}} above.” Bowers and Pleydell-Pearce (2011, p. 2) believe that <b>euphemisms</b> “allow speakers (and listeners) to think about issues that might otherwise be avoided.” Allan and Burridge (1991, p. 11) believe that <b>euphemisms</b> “avoid possible loss of face: either one’s own face or … that of the audience.” However, laboratory studies demonstrate that <b>euphemisms</b> {{are more likely to be}} produced in service of saving the producer’s face rather than the recipient’s face (McGlone & Batchelor, 2003).|$|R
30|$|<b>Euphemisms</b> for {{disability}} are popular—so {{popular that}} style guides prescribe against using <b>euphemisms</b> for {{persons who have}} disabilities. For example, the American Psychological Association (2010, p. 76) tells writers to “avoid euphemisms” for disability, such as “special, physically challenged, handi-capable” because those <b>euphemisms</b> “are condescending.” Similarly, “bypass condescending euphemisms” is a primary recommendation of the Research and Training Center on Independent Living (2013), who note that “terms such as special, handi-capable, differently abled and challenged reinforce {{the idea that people}} cannot deal honestly with their disabilities.” The American Speech-Language-Hearing Association also prescribes against using <b>euphemisms</b> for disability because <b>euphemisms</b> cannot “hide disability, but they can produce confusion” (Folkins, 1992).|$|R

5|$|Geheime Staatspolizei ("Secret State Police"; Gestapo) was {{the secret}} police force of Nazi Germany and German-occupied Europe. Formed in April 1933 by the {{aviation}} minister Hermann Göring, it was by the following year administrated by the SS and regarded as a sister organization of the SD. The Gestapo relied on members of other agencies, spies and a huge network of informants for information. It was led by Heydrich and Heinrich Müller. Whether trained as police originally or not, Gestapo agents themselves were shaped by their socio-political environment. Historian George C. Browder contends {{that there was a}} four-part process (authorization, bolstering, routinization, and dehumanization) in effect which legitimized the psycho-social atmosphere conditioning members of the Gestapo to radicalized violence. The power of the Gestapo included what was called, Schutzhaft ("protective custody"), a <b>euphemism</b> for the power to arrest and imprison people without judicial proceedings.|$|E
5|$|The wet, or rainy, {{season is}} the time of year, {{covering}} one or more months, when most of the average annual rainfall in a region falls. The term green season is also sometimes used as a <b>euphemism</b> by tourist authorities. Areas with wet seasons are dispersed across portions of the tropics and subtropics. Savanna climates and areas with monsoon regimes have wet summers and dry winters. Tropical rainforests technically do not have dry or wet seasons, since their rainfall is equally distributed through the year. Some areas with pronounced rainy seasons will see a break in rainfall mid-season when the intertropical convergence zone or monsoon trough move poleward of their location {{during the middle of the}} warm season. When the wet season occurs during the warm season, or summer, rain falls mainly during the late afternoon and early evening hours. The wet season is a time when air quality improves, freshwater quality improves, and vegetation grows significantly.|$|E

40|$|There is {{abundant}} research on <b>euphemisms,</b> {{but there are}} hardly any of them devoted to <b>euphemisms</b> in relation with the theory of political correctness based on the material of recognized American and Turkish online periodicals {{of the beginning of}} the 21 st century. The aim of the paper is to study the approaches to the definitions of "euphemism " and "political correctness " offered by Russian and Western linguists, to analyze the classifications and functional peculiarities of <b>euphemisms</b> {{within the framework of the}} theory of political correctness. The key research method is the method of comparative analysis which, based on the theoretical data about <b>euphemisms</b> in the English and Turkish languages, helped us to single out the cases of the use of <b>euphemisms</b> in modern American and Turkish online periodicals and compare the types of politically correct <b>euphemisms</b> in the two languages. The paper indicates the active research of <b>euphemisms</b> in the language of mass media by Russian and foreign (American and Turkish) linguists. The results of the study found that, compared to Turkish online newspapers and magazines, modern American online periodicals are characterized by a wider use of politically correct lexemes. The paper findings may be useful for researches who deal with political discourse, comparative analysis, the use of political lexemes and political <b>euphemisms</b> within the framework of the theory of political correctness...|$|R
40|$|The present {{thesis is}} a corpus-based study of <b>euphemisms</b> from a sociolinguistic perspective. The study {{is an attempt}} to reveal if there are any {{differences}} in the usage of the <b>euphemisms</b> gee, heavens, gosh, flaming, blasted, blooming, crikey, blimey, Oh my goodness, sugar, heck and darn by male and female speakers of English with other variables such as age and social class. According to McEnery s (2006) study on swearwords, women swear just as much as men, but men have a tendency to use stronger swearwords than women. The aim of the thesis is to answer the following research questions: 1. Do women use euphemistic swearing more often than men and are there different <b>euphemisms</b> favored by male and female speakers? 2. Do people from the upper class use euphemistic swearing more than people from the working class? Are certain <b>euphemisms</b> favored by one social class more than the others? 3. Is there a similar pattern for the age groups and are certain <b>euphemisms</b> favored by one group more than the others? The results from the British National Corpus (BNC) show that there are indeed differences between factors such as gender, social class and age. There is no obvious tendency as to which social class use <b>euphemisms</b> more than the others as each group seem to prefer different <b>euphemisms.</b> Findings also prove that women use <b>euphemisms</b> slightly more than men, but there are, however, no signs of women overusing euphemistic counterparts of strong swearwords. The results suggest that there is less of a correlation between the use of swearwords and <b>euphemisms...</b>|$|R
40|$|Keyword : <b>Euphemisms,</b> Type of <b>Euphemisms,</b> Motives {{of using}} <b>Euphemisms</b> The {{political}} issues which become the highlighted issues in media Indonesia {{in recent days}} is the reason of the writer in conducting this study. The writer wants to examine how the euphemistic expression {{is used in the}} newspaper when they publish their article. The writer analyzed the political issues news written in The Jakarta Post online newspaper since the development of technology is running very fast so the news updates rapidly by minutes. The Jakarta Post online newspaper is used as the object in this study because this newspaper {{is one of the most}} popular English newspapers in Indonesia. There are two problems to be solved in this study, they are: (1) what types of <b>euphemisms</b> are found in The Jakarta Post online newspaper; and (2) what are the motives of using <b>euphemisms</b> in the Jakarta Post online newspaper. The writer uses Warren 2 ̆ 7 s (1992) theory in analyzing the type of <b>euphemisms</b> and Ulmann 2 ̆ 7 s (1962) for analyzing the motives. This study is using qualitative method since it needs comprehensible and methodological explanation about the analysis of <b>euphemisms.</b> The data are taken from the online newspaper article containing <b>euphemisms.</b> This study discovers that there are six types of <b>euphemisms</b> found in the data and they are understatement or litotes, metaphor, metonym, implication, reversal or irony, and compounding. The writer also analyzes the motives behind the using of <b>euphemisms.</b> The writer found two motives used in this study; they are delicacy fall and propriety motive. In this study, delicacy fall motive is used to avoid direct utterance about crime action and in this case is closely related to corruption or bribe. Meanwhile, the propriety motive is used to avoid direct talking about sex or certain body parts, swearing, and in making the expression more polite in the communication. The writer suggests other students or future researchers who have the same interest on Sociolinguistics, especially <b>Euphemisms,</b> analyze the same study by using the different object and theory. For example, they may take the data from news on TV with more various issues. In addition, other researchers also may conduct the study of <b>euphemisms</b> by combining theories from other linguistic fields such as Semantics or Discourse Analysis...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{draws on}} Japanese, British and other {{material}} for a comparative analysis of name-calling. Naming {{the other is a}} means of identification, helping to establish definitions of self. Definitional power is socially distributed: the power of the mainstream is orchestrated by expert classifications of marginality that disparage others, often in the form of <b>euphemisms.</b> It is argued that the demand for <b>euphemisms</b> is generated by etiquette, modernist ideology and the power of protest. Cases are examined where <b>euphemisms</b> are dispensable or too troublesome, and where conversely it becomes necessary to coin further cultivated <b>euphemisms</b> in an inflationary manner. <b>Euphemisms</b> are disputed in power struggles of linguistic rectitude, involving accusations of political correctness. In terminological conflict, the power of the other to resist, subvert or escape naming must be recognised, yet unequal definitional resources render celebrations of postmodernism premature: dominant designations can effect the containment and denial of being.

This was effected by distributing a self-administeredquestionnaire in Swedish to fifteen Swedish-speakers and one in English to fifteen English-speakers. Inboth samples, eight individuals were female and seven were male while age and education variedgreatly.

A number of findings were made which distinguished between theusage of <b>euphemisms</b> by speakers in terms of their respective languages, i. e.

The study seeminglyaccorded with the general view that males are more direct and do not tend to utilize <b>euphemisms</b> asmuch as females. A further conclusion was that native English speakers are more comfortablediscussing alcohol, in terms of the drinking-cultures, as compared to native Swedish speakers and apossible explanation for this difference was the state alcohol monopoly in Sweden.
