500|$|Raleigh's {{older brother}} and co-pilot. Klattenhoff joined the project to work with del Toro. Describing his character, Klattentoff stated: [...] "This <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>guy</b> <b>who</b> is looking out for his very eager, younger brother and they were enabled with this gift that gave them the {{opportunity}} to kind of save the world. Or help, at least." [...] Tyler Stevenson plays Yancy as a child.|$|E
500|$|The {{film is a}} shot-for-shot {{adaptation}} of the comic book, similar to the film {{adaptation of}} Sin City. Snyder photocopied panels from the comic book, from which he planned the preceding and succeeding shots. [...] "It was a fun process for me… to have a frame as a goal to get to," [...] he said. Like the comic book, the adaptation also used the character Dilios as a narrator. Snyder used this narrative technique to show the audience that the surreal [...] "Frank Miller world" [...] of 300 was told from a subjective perspective. By using Dilios' gift of storytelling, {{he was able to}} introduce fantasy elements into the film, explaining that [...] "Dilios <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>guy</b> <b>who</b> knows how not to wreck a good story with truth." [...] Snyder also added the subplot in which Queen Gorgo attempts to rally support for her husband.|$|E
500|$|The {{music of}} Megadeth and its {{underground}} metal contemporaries from the 1980s featured harsh vocals, double bass drum patterns, staccato riffing, tremolo picking, and screeching lead guitar work; albums {{from this period}} were produced on low budgets. After forming Megadeth, Mustaine followed the thrash metal style of his previous band, Metallica, with more emphasis on speed and intensity. Megadeth's music is characterized by its neat instrumental performance, featuring fast rhythm sections, complex arrangements, and [...] "snarling" [...] vocals. When asked to describe Megadeth's guitar style, Mustaine answered: [...] "When {{you go to a}} show and see a guitar player who just stands there, that's a guitar player. A thrash guitar player <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>guy</b> <b>who</b> plays like he wants to beat the guitar's guts out." [...] Most of the songs are recorded in standard guitar tuning as Mustaine believes it to provide a superior melody to alternative methods of tuning.|$|E

5000|$|In 2012, UFC owner Lorenzo Fertitta {{described}} the feud; [...] "A {{lot of it}} had to do with their personalities - Ortiz was young, he was brash, he was irreverent.

500|$|The subplot of [...] "The Mansion Family", where Mr. Burns gets {{a medical}} examination, was {{inspired}} by Swartzwelder's own visit to a Mayo Clinic. George Meyer, an executive producer on the series, has said that [...] "John, I don't think <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>guy</b> <b>who</b> goes to the doctor very often. And every 20 or 30 years, he decides {{he needs to get}} a tune up. So he went to the Mayo Clinic, had them give him an entire battery of tests. And as John [...] tells it, they said that his constant smoking had done no harm to him whatsoever. Might even be benefiting him." [...] While writing the parts of the episode that involve international waters, the writers did research and found that the actual laws of international waters are more complex and ambiguous compared to what they had already written in the story, but they decided to ignore that.|$|E
500|$|In {{addition}} to Luna as Reyes and Whitehead as James, guest stars for the episode include Mallory Jansen as Aida, José Zúñiga as Morrow, Kerr Smith as Joseph, Phil Tyler as watchdog #1, Sergio Enrique as guard, Tanner Fontana as Elliot and Lilli Birdsell as Lucy. Luna, Jansen, Whitehead, and Birdsell reprise their roles from {{earlier in the}} series. When asked whether the series still wanted to pursue stories about Inhumans such as James, Whedon said they are [...] "still in our world, so we still have {{some of these people}} in the mix ... but right now we’re on the Ghost Rider kick." [...] On having Johnson and Reyes join up with S.H.I.E.L.D., Whedon called it uneasy [...] "for everyone involved. Daisy has {{made it very clear that}} she doesn’t want to be with our team. There’s all that history and pain there. For Robbie, this <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>guy</b> <b>who</b> has never had a team, and probably doesn’t function well within one. We’ll see pretty quickly that it’s an uneasy alliance and it’s going to cause a lot of drama." ...|$|E
500|$|In 2000, Bartley and ÓBriain {{had been}} promised [...] "exclusive access" [...] to Chávez by the government's Minister of Communications. They arrived in Venezuela in September 2001. While filming the pilot they met the president, after which they reconsidered their approach. Bartley explained, [...] "We had... this notion of {{investigating}} Chávez—was he a demagogue? Was the media persona just that? What makes him tick? My sense had changed as we got closer; what we're seeing here <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>guy</b> <b>who</b> is motivated, driven, not the demagogue with another side, drinking, carousing. I began {{to see him as}} more transparent—what {{you see is what you}} get." [...] Bartley and ÓBriain began by attempting to build a relationship with Chávez that would allow them the access they required. At first, the president's staff treated the filmmakers with suspicion and made filming difficult. After numerous delays, Bartley and ÓBriain finally got through to Chávez. They calculated that they needed to [...] "press the right buttons" [...] to gain his support, so they presented [...] him with an old edition of the memoirs of the general Daniel Florence O'Leary, irish who had fought alongside Simón Bolívar. Inside, they had written a quote from the Irish socialist playwright Seán O'Casey. Slowly, Bartley and ÓBriain gained their subjects' trust, [...] "dissolving any self-consciousness as a result of their cameras".|$|E
5000|$|Alexander Vershbow, {{a former}} U.S. {{ambassador}} to Moscow, first met Mamedov in the 1980s; Vershbow describes Mamedov as [...] "a real problem solver, somebody who's always defended their interests quite aggressively—and volubly—but has <b>been</b> <b>a</b> good partner. Every U.S. ambassador who's dealt with him has found him to <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>guy</b> <b>who</b> could get things done." ...|$|R

5000|$|Guy Pearce as Eric, {{a violent}} and bitter former Australian soldier {{who has lost}} his farm and his family. Michôd said that [...] "I wanted the {{character}} to <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>guy</b> <b>who</b> had seen that world collapse, remembered a time when things were different and <b>was</b> carrying around <b>a</b> jaded resentment that <b>was</b> bubbling in <b>a</b> really murderous and dangerous way." ...|$|R
500|$|In the 2015–16 season, Laich's {{offensive}} production rapidly declined, {{while his}} $4.5 million cap hit stuck out {{as one of}} the only adverse aspects of a league-leading Capitals squad. On February 27, 2016, the Capitals placed Laich on waivers for the purpose of sending him to the Hershey Bears of the AHL. The following day, {{on the eve of the}} trade deadline, Laich, along with Connor Carrick and a second round selection (Carl Grundström) in the 2016 draft, were traded to the Toronto Maple Leafs, his boyhood team, in exchange for Daniel Winnik and a fifth round pick (Beck Malenstyn) in the 2016 draft. The purpose of the trade was to give the Capitals salary cap relief to use toward younger core player contracts that needed re-signing the following off-season. Capitals GM Brian Maclellan called the trade, when asked, the hardest thing he had done as General Manager of the team. [...] Laich had been the longest tenured active professional Washington-area athlete at the time of the trade, concluding his service of 12 years with the franchise. In what easily stands as the most emotional trade in Capitals history since Laich was dealt to Washington in a package for Peter Bondra, one journalist wrote [...] "It's ironic that money is what ultimately forced the Caps to move Laich. This <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>guy</b> <b>who</b> loves the game so much, he'd probably play for free." ...|$|E

The boys don't know that Raveena's secretary Karishma (Karisma Kapoor) is the real Raveena and Raveena's actual name is Karishma. Raveena switched her identity {{because she wanted to}} find a boy who will love her, not her money.|$|R
5000|$|In 1976 {{he joined}} the {{development}} department of the US Chamber of Commerce under its president, Richard Lesher. By 1978, his role included running [...] "a grassroots political apparatus" [...] and [...] "relations with the White House and Congress". “Donohue <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>guy</b> <b>who</b> <b>was</b> there—you could feel him.

2500|$|... {{what struck}} me was his intelligence. His use of angles, length and width of the crease. Also, {{guessing}} what a batsman was likely to do. And the kind of field placing that he is comfortable with. Those are the factors that struck me immediately – that this guy not only loves bowling, {{he also has a}} fair idea of what spin actually is. For somebody who started out at 18 or 19, I thought that was a big thing [...] Here <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>guy</b> <b>who</b> knew what the ball is supposed to do, where this guy is expected to play and what are the plans to keep that guy in check and put pressure on that guy. He was pretty clear at 18 itself.|$|E
2500|$|In {{much the}} same way as Buffy had been both a homage and parody of {{traditional}} horror films, Angel gave the same treatment to the classical film noir. [...] Producer Kelly Manners said [...] "Angel is a dark show about a man looking for redemption... We have an alcoholic metaphor with Angel. [...] Angel <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>guy</b> <b>who</b> is one drink away from going back to his evil roots" [...] He attempts to find redemption through helping the helpless of Los Angeles in a fashion similar to that of noir detectives. [...] The first episode even included a Philip Marlowe-style voiceover. [...] Angel filled the role of the reluctant, streetwise detective who has dealings with a variety of underworld characters. [...] In this case, the [...] "underworld" [...] is a literal underworld of demons and supernatural beings. [...] In one instance, Angel is explicitly compared with fictional noir private-detective Marlowe. [...] Many traditional noir stories and characters were explored in earlier episodes, including the ditzy but attractive secretary, the cagey but well-informed partner, and clashes with crooked lawyers, femme fatales and meddlesome, too-good-for-their-own-good cops. [...] These were usually given a modern or supernatural twist.|$|E
2500|$|Ash {{has changed}} in the 30 years since Army of Darkness. In an {{interview}} with Entertainment Weekly, Campbell stated, [...] "Ash has survivor's guilt. You could have a heyday with his PTSD. He's a war vet. He doesn't want to talk about it, and he'll lie about that stump on his hand to impress the ladies. This <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>guy</b> <b>who's</b> got some issues. He's emotionally stunted. But, he's the guy you want in the foxhole next to you." ...|$|R
5000|$|... "It's a star-studded cast, and I'm {{the only}} one on there who's not famous," [...] the ever-humble Bice joked. [...] "I picked and co-wrote the songs that if I <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>guy</b> <b>who</b> would <b>be</b> {{spending}} my hard-earned money buying an album I would want to hear." [...] That means original back-to-basics Southern rock and country-tinged singer/songwriter tunes co-written with A.J. Croce (son of 1970s singer Jim Croce) and Chris Tompkins (Carrie Underwood's [...] "Before He Cheats").|$|R
5000|$|Goldberg was {{selected}} by the Chicago White Sox in the 10th round of the 2013 MLB draft.

He's going to <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>guy</b> <b>who</b> can flash <b>a</b> breaking ball every now and then. I loved ... the competitiveness."

The hand injury Rhys sustained forces him to cancel an impending trip to Japan. His girlfriend, Vanessa Villante (Alin Sumarwata) persuades him to have his injured hand examined {{and he has to}} undergo minor surgery. Rhys later has some tests performed on his hand and is told that he only has a five per cent chance of a full recovery. Barber revealed [...] "He is devastated - becoming a surgeon {{is the most important thing}} to him and he has no plan B. This <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>guy</b> <b>who</b> manipulated himself into the surgical programme, it means that much to him." [...] The crash also affects on Andrew's future when he is diagnosed with epilepsy. Andrew begins displaying [...] "worrying neurological symptoms" [...] including; dizziness, severe headaches and black outs. Smith told Brygel [...] "To start with Andrew just ignores the symptoms. He blames them on the crash. He doesn't want to delve into things. But there comes a point where he can't ignore the symptoms anymore." [...] Despite being urged to tell his family and friends about the diagnosis, Andrew tries to deal with it by himself. When Ed eventually wakes up, Natasha [...] "wastes no time" [...] in telling him how she really feels about him and they share a kiss.
