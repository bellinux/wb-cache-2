40|$|Evidence {{suggests}} that {{a large majority of}} firms and individuals comply with regulations and tax laws even though the frequency of inspections and audits is often low. Moreover, fines for noncompliance are also typically low when regulatory violations are discovered. These observations are not consistent with static compliance models. Harrington (1988) modified these static models by specifying a dynamic game in which some agents have an incentive to comply even when the cost of compliance each period is greater than the expected penalty. This paper reports a laboratory experiment based on the Harrington model framework, in which subjects move between two <b>inspection</b> <b>groups</b> that differ in the probability of inspection and severity of fine. Subjects decide to comply or not in the presence of low, medium or high compliance costs. Enforcement leverage arises in the Harrington model from movement between the <b>inspection</b> <b>groups</b> based on previous observed compliance and noncompliance. Our results indicate that consistent with the model, violation rates increase when compliance costs become higher and as the probability of switching groups becomes lower. Behavior does not change as sharply as the model predicts, however, since violation rates do not jump from 0 to 1 as parameters vary across critical thresholds. A simple model of bounded rationality explains these deviations from optimal behavior. Regulatory Compliance, Laboratory Experiments, Tax. ...|$|R
40|$|This project {{involves}} innovating {{the way the}} Quality Assurance organization at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL) {{tracks the}} receiving inspection of JPL Critical Items (JCI) procured from suppliers. The Quality Assurance organization uses a Microsoft Access based front-end to enter items into an inspection queue. The current design has grown {{to be much more}} than was expected when the inspection queue system was created in 2007. The goal is to migrate to a web based solution that will allow the handling of more data, multiple input interfaces, and customizable display options. This has been achieved by implementing a divided tables scheme, the use of ColdFusion programming language, and the usage of Web 2. 0 technologies such as AJAX and jQuery. These updates will allow for future expansion as well as the standardization of inspection queues for the Quality Assurance organization. When engineers and scientists order flight hardware, they cannot use it straight away. After a spacecraft or a satellite has been launched, it will be impossible to repair; therefore, the parts used must be inspected {{to make sure they are}} operating correctly and within the required specifications. The task of inspecting these JPL Critical Items (JCI) falls on the Quality Assurance organization. One of the tools the receiving <b>inspection</b> <b>group</b> uses is a database to maintain a queue of inspections that need to be done and of inspections that have been completed. The current Access interface has worked well but increased amounts of data, multiple input interfaces, and changes to how data is handled have made it necessary to seek a new way of organizing items for inspection. In addition, the different <b>inspection</b> <b>groups</b> have recently been merged and each has different ways of keeping track of inspection information. The ultimate goal is for the new group to have one shared inspection queue and website. To achieve this goal, I have been working with Ian Luczon of Procurement Quality Assurance and 3 Myers Hawkins, another intern, to not only create the new queue for receiving inspection but also a central web portal for the newly combined <b>inspection</b> <b>group...</b>|$|R

[...] The 14th National Congress, in 1992, strengthened CCDI and local CDI investigative powers. According to the amended party constitution, local CDIs could initiate preliminary investigations against members of the local party committee at the CDI's level before a formal investigation began. If a full investigation was warranted, the local CDI had to obtain approval from its higher-level CDI and the corresponding party committee. In 1995 its powers were increased further, with each CDI given the responsibility to vet officials before their appointment to a post.

40|$|Purpose: This {{research}} {{sought to}} identify the utility value of chest computed tomography (CT) {{when it comes to}} the diagnosis of lung metastasis in cases of colorectal cancer. Methods: From September 2004 to January 2008, 266 patients who were treated for colorectal cancer at Department of Surgery, Hanyang University College of Medicine, were divided into two groups: one that underwent preoperative and postoperative periodical chest CT (periodical <b>inspection</b> <b>group,</b> PIG; May 2006 to January 2008, 135 patients) and one that did not undergo periodical chest CT (non-periodical <b>inspection</b> <b>group,</b> NPIG; September 2004 to April 2006, 131 patients) for comparison. Results: The overall lung metastasis diagnosis rates did not manifest any significant difference. The times to diagnose lung metastasis patients were 6. 3 months and 15. 7 months for the PIG and the NPIG, respectively (P = 0. 022). The size of the metastatic lung nodule was smaller in the PIG than in the NPIG (< 1 cm in 9 / 9 patients vs. < 1 cm in 6 / 9 patients in the PIG and the NPIG, respectively; P = 0. 02). A solitary lung metastasis was more frequently found in the PIG (5 / 9 patients) than in the NPIG (1 / 11 patients) (P = 0. 024). During the follow-up period, 100 % (2 / 2 patients) and 60 % (3 / 5 patients) of the patients in the PIG and the NPIG, respectively, with stage III cancer underwent a lung metastasectomy (P = 0. 002). Conclusion: Chest CT enables early diagnosis with a smaller size and a lower number of lung metastases in patients with colorectal cancer. Moreover, pulmonary the rate of the pulmonary resection for selected patients may be improved. However, the contribution of chest CT to increasing the survival rate must be investigated in a prospective randomized study...|$|R
