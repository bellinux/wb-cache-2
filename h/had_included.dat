5|$|In 2000, {{there were}} two further fatal crashes, killing a total of 19 marines, and the V-22 was again {{grounded}} while the cause of these crashes was investigated and various parts were redesigned. In June 2005, the V-22 successfully completed its final operational evaluation; this <b>had</b> <b>included</b> long range deployments, high altitude, desert and shipboard operations. The problems identified in various accidents had reportedly been addressed.|$|E

5|$|In 2010, {{the office}} of Texas Attorney General Greg Abbott {{investigated}} Trump University. No lawsuit was brought, but after exchanging communications with investigators that included requests from the investigators for customer lists and internal documents, Trump University closed its operations in the state. These <b>had</b> <b>included</b> newspaper advertising, free presentations, and three-day seminars.|$|E
5|$|It {{became clear}} that Auschwitz was not a normal {{internment}} camp with above-average SS rations, but that it served an additional function. Gröning was informed that money taken from interned Jews was not actually returned to them. When he inquired further, his colleagues confirmed that the Jews were being systematically exterminated and that this <b>had</b> <b>included</b> the transport of prisoners who had arrived the previous night.|$|E
5|$|Marilyn Waring {{described}} how {{the exclusion of}} non-market activities in the national accounting systems relied on the deliberate choice and {{the design of the}} international standard of national accounts that explicitly excluded non-market activities. In some countries, such as Norway, which <b>had</b> <b>included</b> unpaid household work in the GDP {{in the first half of}} the 20th century, it was left out in 1950 for reasons of compatibility with the new international standard.|$|E

5|$|Originally, the weight-reduction phase <b>had</b> <b>included</b> {{removing}} the anchors from the battleship, but Wallin ordered {{one of the}} anchors to be reattached. His reason for doing so was that the anchor would effectively shift Missouris center of gravity forward to a narrower part of the battleship, thereby reducing the friction at her widest point. During this time, the Bureau of Ships offered valuable technical and salvage advice to both the civilian and military participants in the salvage effort.|$|E
5|$|Shackleton {{died of a}} {{heart attack}} on 5 January 1922, while Quest was {{anchored}} at South Georgia. After his death the original programme, which <b>had</b> <b>included</b> an exploration of Enderby Land, was abandoned. Wild led a brief cruise which brought them into sight of Elephant Island. They anchored off Cape Wild, and were able to see the old landmarks, but sea conditions made it impossible for them to land.|$|E
5|$|The Webster Sycamore {{had long}} been a local {{landmark}} on account of its age and size, and was known locally as being the world's largest American sycamore. By 1920, author Edwin Lincoln Mosely <b>had</b> <b>included</b> an image and {{a brief description of}} a similar American sycamore near Webster Springs– probably the Webster Sycamore– in his book Trees, Stars and Birds: A Book of Outdoor Science.|$|E

5|$|Triple-doubles in NCAA tournament history: The NCAA began {{keeping track}} of assists for men's {{basketball}} in 1984, then blocks and steals in 1986, so officially this has occurred eight times. However, many tournaments <b>had</b> <b>included</b> assists, steals and blocks in their official boxscores prior to that time, so unofficially this has occurred sixteen times. Only three pre-1986 triple-doubles are included below.|$|E
5|$|Although {{there were}} {{periodic}} attempts at reconciliation between the Metropolia and the Russian Church {{over the next}} few decades, no serious progress was made. During this time, the ethnic character of the Metropolia began to change. Since many Russian immigrants to America aligned themselves with the vocally anti-Communist ROCOR, the Metropolia experienced its growth increasingly through the addition of English-speaking converts. As a result, the ethnic makeup of the Metropolia began to shift away from a purely Slavic one that <b>had</b> <b>included</b> mainly Russians, Ukrainians, Galicians, and Rusyns.|$|E
50|$|Public {{policy toward}} the {{agricultural}} sector also <b>has</b> <b>included</b> the establishment of subsidized sources of credit. Since 1990 such mechanisms <b>have</b> <b>included</b> the Fund for the Finance of the Agricultural Sector (Finagro). Other policy instruments <b>have</b> <b>included</b> minimum price guarantees, import quotas, subsidized credits and tax exemptions, campaigns to promote consumption, incentives for new investments and for forestry plantations, and more recent exchange-rate or currency-hedging options.|$|R

5|$|An {{earlier version}} of the film that was edited before it was {{publicly}} screened <b>had</b> <b>included</b> a painting class on the lunar base that included Kubrick's daughters, additional scenes {{of life on the}} base, and Floyd buying a bush baby from a department store via videophone for his daughter. A ten-minute black-and-white opening sequence featuring interviews with actual scientists, including Freeman Dyson discussing off-Earth life, was removed after an early screening for MGM executives. The text survives in the book The Making of Kubrick's 2001 by Jerome Agel.|$|E
5|$|At {{the back}} of Why Johnny Can't Read, Flesch <b>had</b> <b>included</b> 72 lists of words that young {{children}} {{should be able to}} read, and Spaulding provided Geisel with a similar list. Geisel later told biographers Judith and Neil Morgan that Spaulding had supplied him with a list of 348 words that every six-year-old should know and insisted that the book's vocabulary be limited to 225 words. However, according to Philip Nel, Geisel gave varying numbers in interviews from 1964 to 1969. He variously claimed that he could use between 200 and 250 words from a list of between 300 and 400; the finished book contains 236 different words.|$|E
5|$|By 1889 Verdi {{had been}} an opera {{composer}} for more than fifty years. He had written 27 operas, of which only one was a comedy, his second work, Un giorno di regno, staged unsuccessfully in 1840. His fellow composer Rossini commented that he admired Verdi greatly, but thought him incapable of writing a comedy. Verdi disagreed {{and said that he}} longed to write another light-hearted opera, but nobody would give him the chance. He <b>had</b> <b>included</b> moments of comedy even in his tragic operas, for example in Un ballo in maschera and La forza del destino.|$|E

5|$|England won the toss {{and elected}} to bat on an ideal batting pitch. Hutton and Washbrook {{put on an}} opening {{partnership}} of 168, the best by England in the series. Washbrook refrained from the hook shot, which had caused him to lose his wicket on earlier occasions in the series. The partnership was ended when Hutton was bowled by Lindwall. Washbrook reached his century and joined by Edrich, the pair batted {{until late in the}} first day, when Washbrook was dismissed by Johnston for 143 in the last over of the day. His innings <b>had</b> <b>included</b> 22 boundaries and ended a second-wicket partnership that yielded exactly 100 runs. Bedser was sent in as the nightwatchman and survived as England closed at 268/2, with Edrich on 41.|$|E

5|$|Gossip {{was also}} a noted writer. His {{treatise}} The Chess-Player's Manual—A Complete Guide to Chess, a 900-page tome published in 1874 {{after several years of}} work, was harshly received by the critics, largely because he <b>had</b> <b>included</b> a number of informal skittles games that he had (atypically) won against stronger players. As a result, Gossip developed a lifelong enmity toward chess critics, whom he often attacked ferociously in his books. However, his 1879 book Theory of the Chess Openings was well received. Wilhelm Steinitz, the first World Chess Champion, wrote that the 1888 edition of The Chess-Player's Manual {{was one of the best}} available books on the game. Thanks in part to a 122-page appendix by S. Lipschütz, it became one of the standard opening works of the time.|$|E
