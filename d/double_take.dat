500|$|After the film's {{release and}} unusually strong box office {{performance}} over {{its first two}} weeks, it was debated as the one film capable of surpassing Titanics worldwide gross, and its continued strength perplexed box office analysts. Other films in recent years had been cited as contenders for surpassing Titanic, such as 2008's The Dark Knight, but Avatar was considered the first film with a genuine chance to do so, and its numbers being aided by higher ticket prices for 3D screenings did not fully explain its success to box office analysts. [...] "Most films {{are considered to be}} healthy if they manage anything less than a 50% drop from their first weekend to their second. Dipping just 11% from the first to the third is unheard of," [...] said Paul Dergarabedian, president of box-office analysis for Hollywood.com. [...] "This is just unprecedented. I had to do a <b>double</b> <b>take.</b> I thought it was a miscalculation." [...] Analysts predicted second place for the film's worldwide gross, but most were uncertain about it surpassing Titanic because [...] "Today's films flame out much faster than they did when Titanic was released." [...] Brandon Gray, president of Box Office Mojo, believed in the film's chances of becoming the highest-grossing film of all time, though he also believed it was too early to surmise because it had only played during the holidays. He said, [...] "While Avatar may beat Titanics record, it will be tough, and the film is unlikely to surpass Titanic in attendance. Ticket prices were about $3 cheaper in the late 1990s." [...] Cameron said he did not think it was realistic to [...] "try to topple Titanic off its perch" [...] because it [...] "just struck some kind of chord" [...] and there had been other good films in recent years. He changed his prediction by mid-January. [...] "It's gonna happen. It's just a matter of time," [...] he said.|$|E

It took sixteen to seventeen centuries to double to about one-half billion. The next <b>doubling</b> <b>took</b> less than two centuries, from the middle of the seventeenth century to around 1800.

2500|$|The band's {{contract}} with Word Records was stumbling to an end.

The album, called <b>Double</b> <b>Take</b> was all but ignored by both Word and the Christian music industry and met with antipathy by the band's fans, who rejected the reimagining of some of Petra's most loved songs. Though it garnered some positive reviews – HM Magazine for one said [...] "these stripped-down rockers sound pretty good" [...] – the album was largely rejected by critics and fans alike, and it sold fewer than 40,000 copies.

2500|$|Perhaps Borda's boldest {{notion is}} to give visiting composers such as [...] Adams and Thomas Adès the same royal {{treatment}} that is extended {{to the likes of}} Yo-Yo Ma and Joshua Bell; Borda talks about [...] "hero composers." [...] A recent performance of Adams's monumental California symphony [...] "Naïve and Sentimental Music" [...] in the orchestra's Casual Fridays series ... drew a nearly full house. Borda's big-guns approach has invigorated the orchestra's long-running new-music series, called Green Umbrella, which Fleischmann established in 1982. In the early days, it drew modest audiences, but in recent years attendance has risen to the point where as many as sixteen hundred people show up for a concert that in other cities might draw thirty or forty. The Australian composer Brett Dean recently walked onstage for a Green Umbrella concert and did a <b>double</b> <b>take,</b> saying that it was the largest new-music audience he'd ever seen.|$|E
2500|$|Chomsky {{argued that}} the notions [...] "grammatical" [...] and [...] "ungrammatical" [...] could be defined in a {{meaningful}} and useful way. In contrast, an extreme behaviorist linguist would argue that language can only be studied through recordings or transcriptions of actual speech, {{the role of the}} linguist being to look for patterns in such observed speech, but not to hypothesize about why such patterns might occur, nor to label particular utterances as either [...] "grammatical" [...] or [...] "ungrammatical". Although few linguists in the 1950s actually took such an extreme position, Chomsky was at an opposite extreme, defining grammaticality in an unusually mentalistic way (for the time). He {{argued that the}} intuition of a native speaker is enough to define the grammaticalness of a sentence; that is, if a particular string of English words elicits a <b>double</b> <b>take,</b> or feeling of wrongness in a native English speaker, and when various extraneous factors affecting intuitions are controlled for, {{it can be said that}} the string of words is ungrammatical. This, according to Chomsky, is entirely distinct from the question of whether a sentence is meaningful, or can be understood. It is possible for a sentence to be both grammatical and meaningless, as in Chomsky's famous example [...] "colorless green ideas sleep furiously". But such sentences manifest a linguistic problem distinct from that posed by meaningful but ungrammatical (non)-sentences such as [...] "man the bit sandwich the," [...] the meaning of which is fairly clear, but no native speaker would accept as well formed.|$|E
