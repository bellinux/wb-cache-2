5|$|The current {{economic}} climate {{in the country}} has affected many Icelandic businesses and citizens. With the creation of NÃ½i Landsbanki, the new organisation which replaces the old Landsbanki, around 300 <b>employees</b> <b>will</b> lose their jobs due to a radical restructuring of the organisation which is intended to minimise the bank's international operations. Similar job losses are expected at Glitnir and Kaupthing The job losses can {{be compared with the}} 2,136 registered unemployed and 495 advertised vacancies in Iceland at the end of August 2008.|$|E
5|$|On September 17, 2013, the {{government}} announced that a four-year tentative agreement had been reached with the Newfoundland and Labrador Association of Public and Private Employees (NAPE), the province's largest public sector union. The deal between the two was reached after 18 months of negotiations, during at which point NAPE released radio and television advertisements criticizing {{the government}} for saying the province's economy was booming while they laid off employees and told unions to expect a modest increase in pay. The tentative deal included a wage freeze {{during the first two}} years of the deal, a two per cent increase in pay during year three and a three per cent wage increase in year four. Full-time <b>employees</b> <b>will</b> also receive a $1,400 signing bonus, while temporary, seasonal and part-time workers will get a pro-rated bonus. As well a new job evaluation system would see significant monetary benefits for some employees. Two weeks after reaching an agreement with NAPE, {{the government announced}} tentative agreements with the Canadian Union of Public Employees (CUPE) and the Association of Allied Health Professionals (AAHP). Both agreements had a similar structure as the one government reached with NAPE.|$|E

It is often manned by a park <b>employee</b> who <b>will</b> remind guests of any important policies. The line may bypass pre-show elements of the attraction; again, this is a trade-off that allows a much shorter wait in line. Typically, the line ends at the loading platform, where another employee is stationed. This <b>employee</b> <b>will</b> sort out the arriving guests from the main line and direct them to the ride vehicles.

500|$|Respondents {{argued that}} finding {{employers}} liable for factual mistakes would place substantial costs upon employers. The Court rejected this argument, saying that an employee would {{still need to}} prove the employer acted out of an improper motive. Referring to Heffernan's case and those like it, the Court said that [...] "the <b>employee</b> <b>will,</b> if anything, find {{it more difficult to}} prove that motive, for the <b>employee</b> <b>will</b> have to point to more than his own conduct to show an employer's intent".|$|R

25|$|Human scoring is {{relatively}} expensive and often variable, {{which is why}} computer scoring is preferred when feasible. For example, some critics say that poorly paid <b>employees</b> <b>will</b> score tests badly. Agreement between scorers can vary between 60 and 85 percent, depending on the test and the scoring session. Sometimes states pay to have two or more scorers read each paper; if their scores do not agree, then the paper is passed to additional scorers.|$|E
25|$|The {{number of}} {{one-on-one}} {{channels of communication}} grows more rapidly {{than the number of}} workers, thus increasing the time and costs of communication. At some point one-on-one communications between all workers becomes impractical; therefore only certain groups of <b>employees</b> <b>will</b> communicate with one another (e.g. within departments or within geographical locations). This reduces, but does not stop, the increase in unit costs; and also the organisation will incur some inefficiencies due to the reduced level of communication.|$|E

25|$|On September 2, 2014, Marshall and Finance Minister Charlene Johnson held a {{news conference}} with {{multiple}} union leaders to announce that they had negotiated a deal to reform pension plans for the majority of public sector employees. The government had spoken of the need to reform pension plans for years. As of March 31, 2014, the pension liabilities and other post-retirement benefits made up 74 percent of Newfoundland and Labrador's $9.8 billion net debt. Reforms to the plan included increased contributions by employers and government beginning January 1, 2015, over five years the retirement age will increase to 58 and <b>employees</b> <b>will</b> need to 10 years of service to qualify for a pension rather than five years. The unions and government will jointly manage the fund with {{the creation of a new}} corporation and it is expected the plans will be fully funded within 30 years.|$|E
25|$|Without a body to {{be kicked}} or a soul to be damned, a {{corporation}} does not itself suffer penalties administered by courts, but those who stand to lose their investments will. A company will, as a separate person, be the first liable entity for any obligations its directors and employees create on its behalf. If a company {{does not have enough}} assets to pay its debts as they fall due, it will be insolvent - bankrupt. Unless an administrator (someone like an auditing firm partner, usually appointed by creditors on a company's insolvency) is able to rescue the business, shareholders will lose their money, <b>employees</b> <b>will</b> lose their jobs and a liquidator will be appointed to sell off any remaining assets to distribute as much as possible to unpaid creditors. Yet if business remains successful, a company can persist forever, even as the natural people who invest in it and carry out its business change or pass away.|$|E
25|$|In 2008, {{the company}} began {{expansion}} into the food service and institutional industries due {{to a decline in}} the home-baking products market. In 2015, this expansion effort was significantly increased, in order to better-enable the company to fulfill the needs of these industries and markets. Expansion plans were in part based upon company projections predicting that many company <b>employees</b> <b>will</b> be retiring between 2006 and 2018. In 2015, 173 of the company's employees are qualified for retirement. Expansion plans include the introduction and implementation of more modern equipment, which requires fewer personnel to operate, and an increased capacity for storage. In 2013, as part of the plans to keep the company moving forward into the future, a new research and development facility was built that cost over $6 million. The company plans for the expansions to conclude by fall 2017. In 2013, Chelsea Milling Company produced 180 million boxes of Jiffy mix during their busy season, which runs from September through January.|$|E

25|$|A {{job where}} there are many workers willing to work {{a large amount of}} time (high supply) {{competing}} for a job that few require (low demand) will result in a low wage for that job. This is because competition between workers drives down the wage. An example of this would be jobs such as dish-washing or customer service. Competition amongst workers tends to drive down wages due to the expendable nature of the worker in relation to his or her particular job. A job {{where there are}} few able or willing workers (low supply), but a large need for the positions (high demand), will result in high wages for that job. This is because competition between employers for <b>employees</b> <b>will</b> drive up the wage. Examples of this would include jobs that require highly developed skills, rare abilities, or a high level of risk. Competition amongst employers tends to drive up wages {{due to the nature of}} the job, since there is a relative shortage of workers for the particular position. Professional and labor organizations may limit the supply of workers which results in higher demand and greater incomes for members. Members may also receive higher wages through collective bargaining, political influence, or corruption.|$|E
25|$|Additional {{problems}} have arisen {{when attempting to}} establish where detours and leave from duty take an employee out of {{the course of his}} employment. One idea which is used in this area is that an employer will only be found liable where an employee is going about his business in a standard way. For example, a minor detour would not take an employee out of the course of his employment, but a 'frolic of his own', which did not at all involve his duties, would. Journeys to and from work, and whether these are regarded as in the course of employment, were considered in Smith v Stages, where Lord Lowry established several factors for determining liability. Ordinarily, <b>employees</b> <b>will</b> not be in the course of employment travelling to and from work, unless their transport is provided by their employer. However, travelling to an alternative place of work or to a workplace, during the employer's time, will be in the course of employment. Where course of employment generally begins with travelling to work has been established in the case of Compton v McClure. Here, an employer was found liable for the negligent driving of an employee, who, in an effort to clock in on time, injured another employee at the place of employment. It was stated that the 'least artificial place' to establish employment began was at the gates of the employer's factory, where they established speed limits, and supervised conduct.|$|E

50|$|Death {{benefits}} can {{be determined}} {{by a number of}} different methods at the discretion of the employee: from a minimum coverage of group term insurance to a permanent benefit up to a pre-determined multiple of the employee's reported W-2 income. The tax consequences and funding commitment to the <b>employee</b> <b>will</b> be impacted by the option they choose within the plan. In the case of an employee making $245,000, if a 10Ã multiple is used, that <b>employee</b> <b>will</b> receive a death benefit equal to $2,450,000 ($245,000 Ã 10). The resulting contribution depends heavily on what product is being used for funding, as well as the employee's age and health.|$|R
