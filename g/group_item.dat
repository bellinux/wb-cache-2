When any <b>group</b> <b>item</b> exceeds its threshold, dynamic detection methods are adopt to further detect anomaly. In dynamic detection phase, PCA, joint Gaussian distribution, and Bayesian classification are combined to achieve low cost and efficient anomaly detection.

We aimed to assist researchers and clinicians in the measurement of cognitive processes and behaviors that are characteristic of the disorder for treatment planning and outcome measurement. We developed the specific phobia of vomiting inventory (SPOVI). A series of measures, including the SPOVI, were given to two groups: a group diagnosed with a specific phobia of vomiting and a community control <b>group.</b> <b>Item</b> characteristics, reliability, and factor structure were analysed. Convergent validity with measures of related constructs was determined. The SPOVI was found to have good reliability and validity in the measurement of a phobia of vomiting. The scale has a two-factor structure, with one factor characterised by avoidance symptoms and a second factor comprised of threat monitoring. It is sensitive to change during treatment.

40|$|In {{multiple}} <b>group</b> <b>item</b> response theory (IRT) modeling, {{the usual}} approach {{to compare the}} mean abilities in different groups is to introduce normal distributions for every group g, which are indexed by their mean µg and their variance σ 2 g. These parameters can be estimated by marginal maximum likelihood (MML, see, for instance, Bock & Aitkin, 1981). Tests of hypotheses concerning group means can {{be based on the}} MML estimates of these means divided by their standard errors. In this study we take this approach one step further. We model the mean proficiency levels as a linear combination of structural parameters δ. That is, we consider a model µ=Aδ for some known matrix A. This model allows us to investigate the main and interaction effects of different factors, e. g. gender, place of residence, etc. In this study, the linear model is applied in the framework of the 2 - and 3 -parameter logistic model. For hypothesis testing, we use the likelihood ratio test, the Wald test, and the Lagrange multiplier test. All these tests are used for testing a special linear model against a more general alternative. A simulation study is conducted to assess the small sample Type I error rat...|$|E

Their prescribing costs were significantly higher for respiratory drugs (median 37 % higher) but lower in other drug categories. For respiratory drugs, costs were significantly higher for inhaled adrenoceptor stimulants, steroid inhalers, large spacers, and peak flow meters, but lower for cough medicines and systemic nasal decongestants: the number of items prescribed showed similar patterns.

For both studies, stimuli from the Minnesota Importance Questionnaire (MIQ) were cast in mul-tiple rank order and paired comparison forms and were administered to subjects on two occasions (test-retest) in a counterbalanced design. For the multiple rank order form, item blocks of three stimuli {{were used in the}} first study (N = 158, retest after one week), and item blocks of five stimuli in the second study (N = 280, retest after two days). Individual and <b>group</b> <b>item</b> responses, preference counts, and Thurstone normal transform scale values obtained by the multiple rank order method were found to be very similar to those obtained by paired comparisons.

40|$|Objective: People with {{schizophrenia}} {{have difficulty}} engaging in specific future-directed thoughts and behaviours, such as generating phenomenological characteristics of future events (a component of episodic foresight), and executing directed preparatory behaviours (a component of prospective memory). However, {{it remains unclear}} whether they also exhibit difficulties using episodic foresight to appropriately guide future-directed behaviours. Method: People with schizophrenia and non-clinical controls were administered a behavioural measure that met strict criteria for assessing episodic foresight. In keeping with our focus on the functional application of foresight, this measure required participants to identify a problem, self-generate a resolution, and execute the appropriate future-directed intention. Results: Relative to controls, people with schizophrenia {{were less likely to}} spontaneously acquire items that would later allow a problem to be solved, and were also less likely to subsequently use these items to solve the problems. There was no interaction between group and task, indicating that these two components of foresight were disrupted to an equivalent degree. In the clinical (but not the control) <b>group,</b> <b>item</b> acquisition and item use were correlated with general cognitive capacity. No significant associations with clinical variables emerged. Conclusion: The capacity to apply episodic foresight in a functionally adaptive way is disrupted in schizophrenia and may at least partially reflect broader cognitive dysfunction.

40|$|Purpose: Ubiquitous {{testing has}} the {{potential}} to affect medical education by enhancing the authenticity of the assessment using multimedia items. This study explored medical students’ experience with ubiquitous testing and its impact on student learning. Methods: A cohort (n= 48) of third-year students at a medical school in South Korea participated in this study. The students were divided into two groups and were given different versions of 10 content-matched items: one in text version (the text group) and the other in multimedia version (the multimedia group). Multimedia items were delivered using tablets. Item response analyses were performed to compare item characteristics between the two versions. Additionally, focus group interviews were held to investigate the students’ experiences of ubiquitous testing. Results: The mean test score was significantly higher in the text <b>group.</b> <b>Item</b> difficulty and discrimination did not differ between text and multimedia items. The participants generally showed positive responses on ubiquitous testing. Still, they felt that the lectures that they had taken in preclinical years did not prepare them enough for this type of assessment and clinical encounters during clerkships were more helpful. To be better prepared, the participants felt that they needed to engage more actively in learning in clinical clerkships and have more access to multimedia learning resources. Conclusion: Ubiquitous testing can positively affect student learning by reinforcing the importance of being able to understand and apply knowledge in clinical contexts, which drives students to engage more actively in learning in clinical settings...|$|E
40|$|Archived {{data was}} {{utilized}} {{for the present}} study which examined knowledge about non-suicidal self-injury, or NSSI, in individuals who engage in various degrees of the behavior {{and those who do not}} self-injure. Knowledge about NSSI was measured in three groups of respondents: those with no history of self-injurious behavior (no NSSI group), those with more limited experience with NSSI who reported 1 - 30 incidences of NSSI (limited NSSI group), and those with an extensive history (extensive NSSI group) who reported over 30 incidences of NSSI. To measure knowledge, participants were asked level of agreement with myths and facts about NSSI using Jeffery and Warm’s (2002) knowledge measure. It was hypothesized that the knowledge base would be higher in individuals with more extensive histories of NSSI. Further, individuals with limited histories of NSSI were predicted to have more knowledge than those who have never self-injured. Additionally, this study also hypothesized that the individual item response will vary; depending on extent of NSSI behavior. Group mean scores on the measure were analyzed for differences using a one-way analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) while controlling for the differing group demographic variables of age, sexual orientation, and education level. Results indicated that individuals who have more extensive histories of NSSI evidenced higher mean scores on the measure when controlling for age, sexual orientation and educational level. Individuals with limited histories of NSSI evidenced lower mean scores, and those with no history of NSSI evidenced the lowest scores. In regard to individual item response, items were correlated with seven levels of NSSI (no NSSI, one incident of NSSI, 2 - 4 incidences, 5 - 10 incidences, 11 - 20 incidences, 21 - 30 incidences and more than 30 incidences). It was found that accuracy was significantly correlated with degree of self-injurious behaviors, with the exception of one item. This item and three additional items also produced weak correlations with other items on the measure. Each item is discussed with regard to <b>group</b> <b>item</b> performance and possible deletions in order to strengthen the measure. Overall, the results of this investigation supported the reliability and validity of the Jeffery and Warm (2002) knowledge measure for use with individuals who self-injure. Results are discussed in relation to the need for accurate knowledge about NSSI, the importance of refining and strengthen the measure for this use, and additional research directions...|$|E

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to examine social isolation, social {{competency}} skills and areas of problem behaviours in non-incarcerated adolescent males who have committed sexual offenses against children and compare them to two groups of non-offending adolescent males. The comparison groups were made up of: (1) Boys in outpatient treatment for a variety of emotional and behavioural difficulties and (2) Boys from two large community churches with no history of outpatient psychological treatment. Adolescent sexual offenders and clinic treatment participants reported a higher incidence of emotional and behavioural difficulties than the community control group. Included in this were reports of academic and behavioural difficulties in school and a large number of special education placements in the two groups. In comparison to the clinic treatment group, sexual offenders were also found to have significantly higher rates of actual or suspected physical and/or sexual victimization. Although overall measures of social isolation and social competency skills did not reveal significant differences between the sexual offenders and the two comparison groups, specific item analyses did indicate some significant signs of isolation and withdrawal in the offender <b>group.</b> <b>Item</b> analyses also provided evidence that problem behaviours are likely underreported by sexual offenders on self-report measures due to apparent defensiveness and denial in these individuals. Overall, the sexual offender and clinic treatment groups scored more similarly on the measures of problem behaviours than either group did with the community group. An additional finding in the study was that of large differences between groups in parental involvement in the study. Thirty-five percent of the parents in the sexual offender group failed to return the questionnaires after agreeing to participate in the study. Two trends were found in families who failed to complete the study: disbelief or denial of the child 2 ̆ 7 s guilt in committing the offense and a history of incestuous relationships in the child 2 ̆ 7 s home. Further investigation of these elements could provide more evidence in regard to the importance of parental commitment and cooperation in treating adolescent sexual offenders and the implications for treatment success.
