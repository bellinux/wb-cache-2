60|$|The earth {{on which}} she was lying {{projected}} like a cape into the river. Quite close to her was a brimming lake of <b>dammed-up</b> <b>water,</b> from which these warm rivulets and torrents were trickling. Wisps of vapour came into circling existence {{a foot or so}} from its mirror-surface. Near at hand and reflected exactly in the water was the upper part of a familiar-looking stone pillar. On the side of her away from the water the heaped ruins rose steeply in a confused slope up to a glaring crest. Above and reflecting this glare towered pillowed masses of steam rolling swiftly upward to the zenith. It was from this crest that the livid glow that lit the world about her proceeded, and slowly her mind connected this mound with the vanished buildings of the War Control.|$|E
50|$|Due to its C4 {{photosynthetic}} system, {{proso millet}} is thermophilic like maize. Therefore, shady {{locations of the}} field should be avoided. It is sensitive to cold temperatures lower than 10 to 13 degrees Celsius. Proso millet is highly drought-resistant, which makes it of interest to regions with low water availability and longer periods without rain.The soil should be light or medium-heavy. Due to its flat root systems, soil compaction must be avoided. Furthermore, proso millet does not tolerate soil wetness caused by <b>dammed-up</b> <b>water.</b>|$|E
50|$|In 1865, William Saffold built a {{home here}} on his {{extensive}} lands {{and became a}} successful businessman, operating a store near this location. He soon established a small mill, which {{was built in the}} style typical of this region, {{during the second half of}} the 19th century. From the second-story porch of his home, he could see the natural dam that he began to improve by adding boulders where possible. That way, <b>dammed-up</b> <b>water</b> rushed through the mill race with a stronger force to power his gristmill.|$|E
50|$|During {{the period}} that {{immediately}} followed {{the end of the}} Wisconsin glaciation, the geographic features that would become North America's Great Lakes significantly changed in shape and size. Glacial melt, catastrophic erosion events as <b>dammed-up</b> <b>waters</b> found new outlets, and the post-glacial rebound of this section of the Earth's crust, caused various freshwater lakes in this area to form, drain away, and re-form.|$|R
60|$|Belding {{explained}} that the luxuriance of this desert place was owing to a few springs and the <b>dammed-up</b> <b>waters</b> of the Rio Forlorn. Before {{he had come to}} the oasis it had been inhabited by a Papago Indian tribe and a few peon families. The oasis lay in an arroyo a mile wide, and sloped southwest for some ten miles or more. The river went dry most of the year; but enough water was stored in flood season to irrigate the gardens and alfalfa fields.|$|R
