500|$|One {{of these}} {{paintings}} was St. Jerome in the Wilderness, which Bortolon associates with a difficult period of Leonardo's life, as evidenced in his diary: [...] "I thought I {{was learning to}} live; I was only learning to die." [...] Although the painting is barely begun, the composition can be seen and is very unusual. Jerome, as a penitent, occupies {{the middle of the}} picture, set on a slight diagonal and viewed somewhat from above. His kneeling form takes on a trapezoid shape, with one arm stretched to {{the outer edge of the}} painting and his gaze looking in the opposite direction. J. Wasserman points out the link between this painting and Leonardo's anatomical studies. Across the foreground sprawls his symbol, a great lion whose body and tail make a <b>double</b> <b>spiral</b> across the base of the picture space. The other remarkable feature is the sketchy landscape of craggy rocks against which the figure is silhouetted.|$|E

2500|$|After Austrians {{occupied}} the northern Serbia in 1717, {{it was obvious}} {{that there is a problem}} of providing water for the city within the fortress. Main sources were two large rivers, Danube and Sava, but as Belgrade was quite often under siege or a battleground, it wasn't practical as the rivers would become unreachable during the sieges so they searched for an alternative. Within the scopes of a massive construction and reconstruction of Belgrade in the Baroque manner, from 1717 to 1731 a present facility was dug and a complex wooden mechanism was installed to lift the water up from the pit of [...] It was designed by Balthasar Neumann. Austrians originally intended to dig a proper water well. They descended to , which is below the water level in the Sava, but found no water and actually hit the impervious rock layer. Then they decided to adapt it into the cistern and to conduct all surface water into it. The mechanism was manually operated, worked on the lever principle and had 12 segments, or pistons, which all worked at the same time when operated. Water was then [...] "climbing", being poured from one vessel into another. Being made of wood, it got rotten and completely disappeared in time, but sometimes it is mentioned as the beginning of the [...] "industrial period" [...] in Belgrade. [...] The copy of the schematics is still being kept in the library of the Matica Srpska in Novi Sad. Neumann also constructed a <b>double</b> <b>spiral</b> staircase which descends [...] down the shaft and based it on the staircase in the Saint Peter Well in Orvieto, Italy. The diameter of the shaft is [...] The staircase has 212 steps and there is a small corridor at the bottom which connects two sections of the staircase, but it is usually flooded. On Austrian maps, it is named the Great Well, but when Serbian rebels liberated Belgrade from the Ottomans in the early 19th century they gradually named it the Roman Well as the common belief at the time was that all old buildings were Roman.|$|E

50|$|The {{vortex sheet}} {{solution}} {{as given by}} the Birkoff-Rott equation cannot go beyond the critical time. The spontaneous loss of analyticity in a vortex sheet {{is a consequence of}} mathematical modeling since a real fluid with viscosity, however small, will never develop singularity. Viscosity acts a smoothing or regularization parameter in a real fluid. There have been extensive studies on a vortex sheet, most of them by discrete or point vortex approximation, with or without desingularization. Using a point vortex approximation and delta-regularization Krasny (1986) obtained a smooth roll-up of a vortex sheet into a <b>double</b> branched <b>spiral.</b> Since point vortices are inherently chaotic, a Fourier filter is necessary to control the growth of round-off errors. Continuous approximation of a vortex sheet by vortex panels with arc wise diffusion of circulation density also shows that the sheet rolls-up into a <b>double</b> branched <b>spiral.</b>|$|R

40|$|The flower {{meristem}} identity genes floricaula (flo) and squamosa (squa) {{promote a}} change in phyllotaxy from spiral to whorled in Antirrhinum. To determine how this might be achieved, we have performed a combination of morphological, genetic, and expression analyses. Comparison of the phenotypes and RNA expression patterns of single and double mutants with the wild type showed that flo and squa act together to promote flower development but that flo is epistatic to squa with respect to early effects on phyllotaxy. We propose that a common process underlies the phyllotaxy of wildtype, flo, and squa meristem development but that the relative timing of primordium initiation or growth is altered. This process depends on two separable events: setting aside zones for potential primordium initiation and partitioning these zones into discrete primordia. Failure of the second event {{can lead to the}} formation of continuous <b>double</b> <b>spirals,</b> which are occasionally seen in flo mutants...|$|R

These structures are defined by Weierstrass representation and satisfy to a zero condition for the instability index of the surface and availability of bifurcation points for these surfaces. The topological stability of such structures corresponds to removing of the configuration degeneracy and to existence of bifurcation points for these surfaces. The considered ordered non-crystalline structures are determined by homogeneous manifolds - algebraic polytopes, corresponding to the definite substructures the 8 -dimensional lattice E 8. The joining of two semi-turns of two spirals into the turn of a single two-spiral (helical) system is effected by the topological operation of a connected sum.
