50|$|<b>Danbo</b> first {{appeared}} in chapter 28 of the manga. It was created {{as a result of}} a challenge during summer vacation for elementary school students Ena Ayase and her friend, Miura Hayasaka. Although the person inside is able to move upon wearing the costume, the young protagonist, Koiwai Yotsuba, found it by chance in the neighboring Ayase home while Miura was wearing the costume. Because Yotsuba believed it was a real robot, the two elementary school students joined forces to improvise a story in order to not destroy Yotsuba's dream.

40|$|Individuals {{have the}} {{tendency}} to discount rewards in the future, known as temporal discounting, and we find that sense of power (the felt capacity to influence the thinking and behavior of others) reduces such tendency. In Studies 1 and 2, we used both an experiment and a survey with organizational employees to demonstrate that power reduced temporal discounting. In Study 3, we replicated study 1 while exploring a unique cultural trait of <b>Danbo,</b> or indifference to fame and wealth, across two ethnic groups (Han and Tibetan groups) in China. While power reduces temporal discounting, {{the relationship between the}} two may be leveraged by individual differences of optimism, frustration, and <b>Danbo.</b> The results imply a more nuanced interpretation of how individual and situational factors can affect intertemporal choice...|$|E

Here, we combined a concept of polymer&ndash;PTX drug conjugate with a concept of polymeric micelle drug delivery to form novel free PTX-loaded poly(L-&gamma;-glutamylglutamine) (PGG) &ndash;PTX conjugate nanoparticles. The significance of this drug formulation emphasizes the simplicity, novelty, and flexibility of the method of forming nanoparticles that contain free PTX and conjugated PTX in the same drug delivery system. The results of effectively inhibiting tumor growth in mouse models demonstrated the feasibility of the nanoparticle formulation. The versatility and potential of this dual PTX drug delivery system can be explored with different drugs for different indications. Novel and simple formulations of PTX-loaded PGG&ndash;PTX nanoparticles could have important implications in translational medicines.

40|$|Isolates of Non-Starter Lactic Acid Bacteria (NSLAB) {{from six}} ripened <b>Danbo</b> cheeses of {{different}} ages and of different brands were examined. Special emphasis was on the genus Lactobacillus {{with the aim of}} investigating their role in cheese maturation. Thirty-three isolates were typed by the PCR-based method, Randomly Amplified Polymorphic DNA (RAPD). Ten RAPD types were found and 70 % of the isolates were of RAPD types found in more than one cheese. The different RAPD types were identified to species level by Temporal Temperature Gradient Gel Electrophoresis (TTGE). Most of the isolates were identified as Lactobacillus paracasei (76 %), but also Lactobacillus curvatus, Lactobacillus plantarum, Lactobacillus rhamnosus and some taxa originating from the starter culture were detected. In one cheese, no lactobacilli were found. One strain of the most frequent Lactobacillus RAPD type from each of the five cheeses with a Lactobacillus flora was used as adjunct cultures in a cheese model system. Four of the five adjuncts were re-isolated during ripening. Two adjunct containing model cheeses received higher flavour scores than the control while two other were associated with off-flavours. The two model cheeses with off-flavour had a similar microflora and both were after 13 weeks of ripening dominated by a strain identified as L. plantarum...|$|E

The {{purpose of the present}} study was to elucidate further the physicochemical properties of PGG-PTX in order to proceed with its clinical development. Methods and results: PGG-PTX was designed by integration of a hydrophobic paclitaxel conjugate through an added hydrophilic glutamic acid onto poly(L-glutamic acid). The addition of a flexible glutamic linker between PGA and paclitaxel resulted in spontaneous self-assembly of a PGG-PTX conjugate into nanoparticles. The PGG-PTX conjugate was stable as a lyophilized solid form. An in vitro viability experiment showed that PGG-PTX was effective after a longer incubation period, the same trend as Taxol. In vitro studies using NCI-H 460 and B 16 F 0 cancer cells demonstrated significantly high cellular uptake after 30 minutes of incubation. The in vivo biocompatibility of PGG-PTX conjugate was evaluated in the NCI-H 460 tumor model, the assessment of tissue seemed to be normal after 21 days of treatment. Conclusion: These results are encouraging for further development of non-block polymeric paclitaxel nanoparticles for treatment of cancer.

40|$|Surface-ripened cheeses of the <b>Danbo</b> type were ana-lyzed for the {{presence}} of yeasts with special emphasis on Debaryomyces hansenii. Samples were taken from pasteurized milk, brine, and inoculation slurries and from cheese surfaces during ripening at a Danish dairy. D. hansenii was found to be the dominant yeast species throughout the ripening period, whereas other yeast species such as Trichosporon spp., Rhodotorula spp., and Candida spp. were found in minor concentrations during early stages of cheese ripening. Mitochondrial DNA RFLP was used to show that several strains of D. hansenii were present from the onset of ripening. Thereafter, a microbial succession among the strains took place during the ripening. After 3 d of ripening, only one strain was found. This particular strain was found to be dominant in 16 additional batches of sur-face-ripened cheeses. We investigated the cause of the observed microbial succession by determining the vari-ation in strains with regard to their ability to grow on lactate and at different pH and NaCl concentrations. The strains were shown to vary in their ability to grow on lactate. In a full factorial design at three levels with factor levels close to the actual levels on the cheese surface, differences in pH and NaCl tolerances were observed. The dominant strain was found to be better adapted than other strains to the environmental condi-tions existing in surface-ripened cheeses during produc-tion [e. g., lactate as the main carbon source, pH 5. 5 to 6. 0 and NaCl concentrations of 7 to 10 % (wt/vol) ].

Methods: DTX was covalently attached to hydrophilic PGG by direct esterification, and the conjugate was characterized by proton nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy, molecular weight gel permeation chromatography, solubility, size distribution and morphology, and hemolysis. Conjugated DTX {{was found to have}} 2000 times improved water solubility compared with free DTX. Dynamic light scattering, transmission electron microscopy, and atomic force microscopy revealed the particle size, distribution and morphology of the PGG&ndash;DTX conjugate. In addition, the conjugate was further tested for in vitro cytotoxicity and in vivo antitumor efficacy on the human non-small cell lung cancer cell line NCI-H 460. Results: Conjugated DTX was found to have 2000 times improved water solubility compared with free DTX. The conjugate formed nanoparticles with an average diameter of 30 nm in spherical shape and unimodal particle size distribution. The conjugate exhibited about 2 % hemolysis at 10 mg/mL, compared with 56 % for Tween 80 &reg; at 0. 4 mg/mL, and 33 % for Cremophor EL&reg; at 10 mg/mL. In addition, the conjugate was further tested for in vitro cytotoxicity and in vivo antitumor efficacy on the human non-small cell lung cancer cell line NCI-H 460. As expected, conjugated DTX exhibited lower cytotoxicity compared to that of free DTX, in concentration-dependent manner. However, PGG&ndash;DTX showed better antitumor activity in NCI-H 460 lung cancer-bearing mice with minimal weight loss compared to that of free DTX. Conclusion: The PGG&ndash;DTX conjugate may be considered as an attractive and promising polymeric DTX conjugate for non-small cell lung cancer treatment.

40|$|The {{microflora}} of Herrgård cheese {{produced at}} three dairies was compared after three {{and six months}} maturation. The microflora of cheeses from two of the dairies was dominated by a spontaneous microflora of Lactobacillus {{after three months of}} ripening, while starter bacteria still dominated in cheese from the third dairy after six months. Isolates were typed by the PCR-based method Randomly Amplified Polymorphic DNA (RAPD). The Lactobacillus flora in cheese from different dairies consisted mainly of diverse RAPD-types, but of the 24 RAPD-types found, three were isolated from cheese made at two different dairies and two other RAPD-types were isolated from cheese from all three dairies. The RAPD-typing indicated a succession between different types of Non-Starter Lactic Acid Bacteria (NSLAB) in cheese from one of the dairies. The NSLAB in <b>Danbo</b> cheese was studied, with special emphasis on Lactobacillus, using six ripened cheeses of different ages and of different brands. The microflora in five cheeses was dominated by Lactobacillus, but the sixth cheese contained no Lactobacillus. Ten RAPD-types were found and 70 % of the isolates were of RAPD-types found in more than one cheese. The different RAPD-types of NSLAB were identified to species level by Temporal Temperature Gradient gel Electrophoresis (TTGE). Most NSLAB isolates were identified as Lactobacillus paracasei (76 %), but Lactobacillus plantarum, Lactobacillus curvatus and Lactobacillus rhamnosus were also found. 37 Lactobacillus casei/paracasei and Lactobacillus rhamnosus strains of mostly human or cheese origin were classified by Restriction Endonuclease Analysis (REA) of the total chromosomal DNA and TTGE of PCR amplified 16 s rDNA fragments. REA-typing singled out three major clusters, two composed of Lactobacillus paracasei and one of Lactobacillus rhamnosus strains. The groups obtained by TTGE corresponded generally with the REA-clusters. All Lactobacillus paracasei strains had one amplified 16 s rDNA fragment incommon, but were separated into five subgroups due to the presence of one or two additional fragments amplified for some strains. The observed heterogeniety in the 16 s rDNA of about half of the tested Lactobacillus paracasei strains might provide an explanation of the diversity within this species. A cheese model system, reproducible and comparable to cheese manufactured in full-scale in terms of moisture, salt content, pH and microbial ecology, was developed. Lactobacillus strains originating from cheese or human mucosa were tested as adjunct cultures in the cheese model system. The test-strains were mainly Lactobacillus paracasei and Lactobacillus rhamnosus strains. Adjuncts of Lactobacillus paracasei were re-isolated more frequently than adjuncts of Lactobacillus rhamnosus, but no correlation was found between re-isolation and the origin of the adjunct. The flavour development was generally strain dependent, but adjuncts of Lactobacillus paracasei were slightly more common in improving cheese flavour. Model cheese with a microflora dominated by an RAPD-type of Lactobacillus plantarum was associated with off-flavour and serine degradation. Two human-derived Lactobacillus paracasei strains were used as adjunct cultures in pilot scale cheese production. These strains improved cheese flavour and survived passage through the human gastro-intestinal tract when delivered in semi-hard cheese. The NSLAB did not share this characteristic...|$|E
