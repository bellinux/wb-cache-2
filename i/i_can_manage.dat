6000|$|... "Thank you for nothing, Thorne: <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>manage</b> {{that matter}} myself. Now leave me; but remember, you have ruined that girl's fortune." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'It would DO,' he said. 'But {{why should}} {{you give me an}} {{expensive}} rug? <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>manage</b> perfectly well with my old Oxford Turkish.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Don't say {{anything}} more about pianos," [...] said Morris, with a strong shudder; [...] "I'm not the man I used to be! This--this other man--let's come to him, if <b>I</b> <b>can</b> only <b>manage</b> to follow. Who is he? Where <b>can</b> <b>I</b> get hold of him?" ...|$|R

6000|$|... "It's a good thing," [...] Laverick remarked, {{thrusting}} {{his hand}} into his pocket. [...] "Here's a five-pound note on account. <b>I</b> daresay you <b>can</b> <b>manage</b> to keep sober to-night, at any rate. That's all, isn't it?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{have found}} myself here [in Leipzig, as elsewhere] {{overwhelmed}} with business, {{and even to}} a degree I had not expected.
