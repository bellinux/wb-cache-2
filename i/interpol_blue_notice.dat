The incident caused significant media backlash within India as many began to {{raise questions about the}} connection between men with criminal reputations like Modi and international law enforcement. Yet Noble, who served as the head of Interpol from 2000 to 2014, denied any knowledge of Modi's criminal activities despite evidence that Modi was on an Interpol watch list for some time.|$|R
50|$|Charters had {{for years}} been researching the history of jazz, but in the 1950s he also began to study the <b>blues.</b> <b>Noticing</b> that his copy of the bluesman Robert Johnson's {{recordings}} were recorded in San Antonio, Charters set out for Texas in 1953 to discover what he could about Robert Johnson and another of his favorite musicians, Blind Willie Johnson. With Charters's search for Robert Johnson began his years of doing field recordings (initially for Folkways Records throughout the United States {{and then in the}} Bahamas in 1958, where he made the first recordings of Joseph Spence). His 1959 recordings of the Texas bluesman Lightnin' Hopkins proved instrumental in Hopkins's rediscovery. Also in 1959, Charters published his influential book The Country Blues, the first history of blues and an absorbing account of his search for the bluesmen themselves, with a companion album of the same title to accompany it.|$|R

40|$|MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are {{approximately}} 22 -nucleotide long non-coding RNAs that regulate (by silencing) gene expression through base pairing with target messenger RNAs (mRNA). MiRNAs begin as transcribed long RNA precursors and are processed in the nucleus by the RNase III enzyme complex that includes Drosha-Pasha/DGCR 8 to generate approximately 70 -base pre-miRNAs. Pre-miRNAs are processed further {{as they are}} incorporated into an Argonaute- containing RNA-induced silencing complex (RISC), where miRNAs pair to their targets through base-pairing with the 3 ’-untranslated region. As a result translation of the mRNA target is repressed primarily through cleavage mechanisms (1, 2). Although miRNA were first described in Caenorhabditis elegans (3), thousands of miRNAs {{have been identified in}} several organisms. Intriguingly, the biological functions of most mammalian miRNAs are still poorly understood but have been found {{to play a role in}} embryogenesis and stem cell maintenance, hematopoietic cell differentiation (1, 4), and brain development (5). Notably, most of these processes, when mis-regulated, lead to cancer (1, 6, 7). It is not a surprise therefore that miRNAs are now emerging as cancer targets. Notably, human miRNAs in particular, are often found in genome regions that are commonly amplified or deleted in human cancer (8). Also, when compared to normal tissues, malignant tumors and tumor cell lines have widespread deregulated miRNA expression (9, 1). Consequently, identifying patterns of miRNA expression in disease states and elucidating the processes dictated by their targets will be key in defining mechanisms of disease progression or classification. Furthermore, the push to use miRNA in cancer diagnostics is supported by the fact that miRNA is more stable than mRNA and can withstand rigorous analysis protocols. Here we use a MetaCore ™ report on the analysis of a miRNA expression profile from primary human breast tumors to identify trends in miRNA expression in cancer subtypes and further elucidate functional processes associated with each.

In our earlier report, the formation of Au@Prussian <b>blue</b> nano-composite was <b>noticed</b> on potential cycling the glassy carbon electrode in a medium containing gold (III) chloride and potassium hexacyanoferrate (III). Hence in this work, the formation of gold hexacyanoferrate was attempted by a simple chemical reaction. The reaction of gold (III) chloride with potassium hexacyanoferrate (II/III) was examined by UV–Vis spectroscopy and found {{that there is no}} redox reaction between gold (III) chloride and potassium hexacyanoferrate (III). However, the redox reaction occurs between gold (III) chloride and potassium hexacyanoferrate (II) leading to the formation of charge transfer band and the conversion of hexacyanoferrate (II) to hexacyanoferrate (III) was evidenced by the emergence of new absorption peaks in UV–Vis spectra. The oxidation state of gold in Au–Fe complex was found to be + 1 from X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy. The stability of the Au–Fe complex was also studied by cyclic voltammetry. Cyclic voltammetric results indicated the presence of high spin iron in Au–Fe complex. Hence ‘as formed’ Au complex may be KFex[Au(CN) 2]y.

40|$|Background: Indigenous {{children}} in Australia {{are more likely}} than non-Indigenous children to be in contact with the child safety system. A large number of Queensland's Indigenous population live in remote and isolated communities in north Queensland where the state government's Alcohol Management Plans (AMPs) are in effect. In these communities it is an offence to have in one's possession more than the regulated amount and type of alcohol. A breach of these restrictions can result in convictions under the Liquor Act 1992. Findings: During an evaluation of AMPs, influential stakeholders and key service providers voiced their belief that a conviction for a breach of the AMP would impact a person's eligibility to hold a Positive <b>Notice</b> <b>Blue</b> Card (PNBC). On its own, however, a breach of the Liquor Act 1992 will not impact a person's eligibility for a PNBC. A PNBC is required for any person volunteering or working with children. Without a PNBC, a person is ineligible to work in child-related employment, volunteer at child-related activities or provide out-of-home care for children. Conclusion: This misconception needs to be addressed in these already-disadvantaged communities to ensure that Indigenous community members have every opportunity to hold a PNBC. Focused strategies with evaluation and research are needed in this important policy area...|$|R
40|$|The Sam Francis’s colors, {{literally}} {{described as}} vivid, saturated, pure, vibrant intense and rich, largely {{contribute to the}} unique character of his work. This idiosyncrasy explains the interest in conducting an extended study on the Francis’ painting materials through analytical techniques. On the other hand, many Francis’ paintings display colored surfaces that exhibit bronzing, fluorescent or opalescent effects. As a consequence, retouching paint losses from Sam Francis works may become a challenging task for the involved conservators, the degree of the color matching required in the imitative technique being particularly difficult to attain, {{in the presence of}} such surfaces. Furthermore, the attained degree of the color match has to be conserved in all conditions of illumination and observation. The use of pigments chemically similar to the original ones is often necessary for matching highly chromatic pigments. Though, many modern synthetic organic pigments (SOPs) possess high color strength. That is why the characterization of the Francis palette would provide helpful information to the conservators, which have to deal with this type of issue. The upcoming Getty publication Sam Francis: The Artist’s Materials, planned for 2016, offered the opportunity for in-depth analyses of hundreds paint samples. Almost three hundreds of paint fragments supplied by the Sam Francis Foundation have been investigated at the GCI laboratory, by using three complementary analytical techniques, Py-GC-MS, Raman and FTIR spectroscopies. The Raman spectroscopy {{is one of the most}} efficient techniques for identifying SOPs in paint systems, while the Py-GC-MS and FTIR methods provide essential information concerning the binding media. The analyzed paint fragments were sampled from twenty-nine canvases and works on paper, made between 1946 and 1992. Although, primary established in Southern California, Sam Francis spent numerous long journeys in different places around the world, including Paris, Bern, Mexico City, New York and Tokyo. However, the material study has outlined the uninterrupted use of` certain classes of SOPs in specific colors. For example, copper phthalocyanine (CuPc) pigments were systematically detected in the blue and green samples, while azo pigments have been identified in most of the yellow areas sampled from post 1940 s works. Regardless of the support and the paint technique, the Francis’ blues primary contain Ultramarine and/or CuPc blue pigments. And, it has been shown that the bronzing <b>blue</b> surfaces <b>noticed</b> for some of the investigated artworks correspond to PB 15 -based paint films. The present study has also underlined the recurrent use of perinone orange and dioxazine violet in fluorescent orange and purple area. Despite the early introduction of SOPs, on the Francis’ palette, the works dating from the 1940 ’s remained mainly composed of traditional inorganic pigments, for instance lead white and red, chrome yellow, viridian and iron oxides. Interestingly, various binding media, i. e. Shellac gum, modified and unmodified oils, PVA, alkyd resins and acrylic copolymers have been identified. Actually, the investigated samples have pointed out the frequent combination of more than three types of binders on a same painting. Through the identification of the various SOPs used by Francis over fifty years, this research provide helpful information for selecting the most appropriate retouching pigments.
