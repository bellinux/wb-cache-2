It is true that plasma concentration is a poor indicator of <b>intracellular</b> <b>depletion</b> [37], which occurs postoperatively and in critical illness [5, 38 – 40].

The role of F 1 -ATPase activity in mtΔΨ hyperpolarization was supported by the <b>intracellular</b> <b>depletion</b> of ATP in FOH-treated cells and its protection with sodium azide.

Potentiation of Pcy-triggered apoptosis by MDL was inhibited when cells were exposed to specific inhibitors of DR 4 /DR 5.

We previously reported rapid rhinovirus induction of intracellular superoxide anion, resulting in NF-kappaB activation and pro-inflammatory molecule production. The mechanisms of rhinovirus superoxide induction are poorly understood.

Rhinovirus infection induced <b>intracellular</b> <b>depletion</b> of reduced glutathione (GSH) that was abolished by pretreatment with either XO inhibitor oxypurinol or serine protease inhibitors. Increasing intracellular GSH with exogenous H 2 S or GSH prevented both rhinovirus-mediated intracellular GSH depletion and rhinovirus-induced superoxide production.

40|$|Overproduction of {{nitric oxide}} (NO) by {{inducible}} NO synthase (iNOS) has {{been implicated in}} the pathogenesis of many diseases. iNOS is active only as a homodimer. Dimerization of iNOS represents a potentially critical target for therapeutic intervention. In this study, we show that intracellular iNOS forms dimers that are ”undisruptable” by boiling, denaturants, or reducing agents. Undisruptable (UD) dimers are clearly distinguishable from the easily dissociated dimers formed by iNOS in vitro. UD dimers do not form in Escherichia coli-expressed iNOS {{and could not be}} assembled in vitro, which suggests that an in vivo cellular process is required for their formation. iNOS UD dimers are not affected by <b>intracellular</b> <b>depletion</b> of H 4 B. However, the mutation of Cys- 115 (critical for zinc binding) greatly affects the formation of UD dimers. This study reveals insight into the mechanisms of in vivo iNOS dimer formation. UD dimers represent a class of iNOS dimers that had not been suspected. This unanticipated finding revises our understanding of the mechanisms of iNOS dimerization and lays the groundwork for future studies aimed at modulating iNOS activity in vivo...|$|E

Butyric acid, -linoleic acid, and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) were supplemented at 200 µM concentration in the medium of cell cultures. Our results showed that all fatty acids inhibited cell growth, whereas only DHA induced cell apoptosis. An oxidative process was implicated in apoptosis induced by DHA because butylated hydroxytoluene and vitamin E prevented lipid peroxidation and reversed apoptosis. Intracellular and extracellular glutathione [reduced glutathione (GSH) and oxidized glutathione (GSSG) ] concentrations were measured follow-ing DHA treatment in the presence or {{in the absence of}} GSH extrusion inhibitors such as cystathionine or methionine. DHA induced <b>intracellular</b> GSH <b>depletion</b> without affecting <b>intracellular</b> GSSG concentration and increased extracellular GSH and GSSG levels. Intracellular GSH de-pletion and extracellular GSH increase were both reversed by cystathionine. Inhibition of active GSH extrusion from the cell by cystathionine or methionine completely reversed lipid peroxidation and apoptosis. These data document the antiproliferative and apoptotic activities of DHA.

PET data were analyzed with the 2 -tissue-compartment model for (18) F-FDG, {{and the results were}} evaluated with Michaelis-Menten saturation kinetics. RESULTS: Glucose clearance from plasma to brain (K 1,glc) and the phosphorylation rate constant increased with decreasing plasma glucose (Gp), in particular at a Gp of less than 2. 5 mmol/L. Estimated cerebral glucose extraction ratios taking into account an increased cerebral blood flow (CBF) at a Gp of less than 2 mmol/L were between 0. 14 and 0. 79. CBF-normalized K 1,glc values were in agreement with saturation kinetics. Phosphorylation rate constants indicated <b>intracellular</b> glucose <b>depletion</b> at a Gp of less than 2 - 3 mmol/L. When brain regions were compared, glucose transport under hypoglycemia was lowest in the hypothalamus.

Intracellular {{adenosine triphosphate}} (ATP) depletion and subsequent induced endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress are proposed {{to be the}} underlying mechanisms of ischemic retinal cell death. Recently, we found that a naphthalene derivative can inhibit ATPase activity of valosin-containing protein, universally expressed within various types of cells, including retinal neural cells, with strong cytoprotective activity. Based on the chemical structure, we developed novel valosin-containing protein modulators, Kyoto University Substances (KUSs), that not only inhibit <b>intracellular</b> ATP <b>depletion,</b> but also ameliorate ER stress. Suppressing ER stress by KUSs is associated with neural cell survival in animal models of several neurodegenerative diseases, such as glaucoma and retinal degeneration. Given that a major pathology of ischemic retinal diseases, other than <b>intracellular</b> ATP <b>depletion,</b> is ER stress-induced cell death, KUSs may provide a novel strategy for cell protection in ischemic conditions. Hence, we investigated the efficacy of KUS 121 in a rat model of retinal ischemic injury.

In search of a new therapeutic approach for pancreatic cancer, we sought to determine whether specific inhibition of the plasma membrane xc− cystine transporter could lead to reduced uptake of cysteine, a key precursor of glutathione, and subsequent glutathione depletion. Sulfasalazine (approximately 0. 2 mmol/L), an anti-inflammatory drug with potent xc−-inhibitory properties, markedly reduced l-[14 C]-cystine uptake, glutathione levels, and growth and viability of human MIA PaCa- 2 and PANC- 1 pancreatic cancer cells in vitro. These effects were shown to result primarily from inhibition of cystine uptake mediated by the xc− cystine transporter and not from inhibition of nuclear factor κB activation, another property of sulfasalazine.

Three pathophysiologically relevant oxidants were chosen to evaluate CF protection against oxidative stress: hydrogen peroxide, peroxyl radicals, and hypochlorous acid. Both biomolecules (GSH and plasmid DNA) and circulating cells (erythrocytes and lymphocytes) were used as targets of oxidation. CF protected, in a dose-dependent manner, both GSH and DNA from oxidation by preserving reduced GSH thiol groups and supercoiled DNA integrity, respectively.

In lymphocytes, CF reduced the intracellular oxidative stress induced by the three oxidants in a dose-dependent manner. The overall in vitro protection of biomolecules and cells against free radical attacks suggests that CF might be a valuable coadjuvant in the prevention and treatment of various physiological and pathological conditions related to oxidative stress, from aging to atherosclerosis, from neurodegeneration to cancer...|$|E

Here, we analyzed endogenous Bst- 2 with respect to its effect on virus release from HeLa cells, T cells, and macrophages. We noted significant cell type-dependent variation in Bst- 2 expression. Vpu caused a reduction in Bst- 2 expression in transfected HeLa cells and long-term infected macrophages. However, Vpu expression {{did not result in}} cell surface down-modulation of Bst- 2 or a reduction in intracellular Bst- 2 expression in CEMx 174 or H 9 cells, yet virus replication in these cells was Vpu-responsive. Surprisingly, Bst- 2 was undetectable in cell-free virions that were recovered from the surface of HeLa cells by physical shearing, suggesting that a tethering model may not explain all of the functional properties of Bst- 2. Taken together we conclude that enhancement of virus release by Vpu does not, at least in CEMx 174 and H 9 cells, require cell surface down-modulation or <b>intracellular</b> <b>depletion</b> of Bst- 2, nor does it entail exclusion of Bst- 2 from viral particles...|$|E

Despite {{the importance of this}} cation/chloride cotransporter (CCC), the mechanisms that underlie its regulation are largely unknown. Here, we show that <b>intracellular</b> chloride <b>depletion</b> in Xenopus laevis oocytes, achieved by either coexpression of the K-Cl cotransporter KCC 2 or low-chloride hypotonic stress, activates NKCC 2 by promoting the phosphorylation of three highly conserved threonines (96, 101, and 111) in the amino terminus. Elimination of these residues renders NKCC 2 unresponsive to reductions of [Cl−]i. The chloride-sensitive activation of NKCC 2 requires the interaction of two serine-threonine kinases, WNK 3 (related to WNK 1 and WNK 4, genes mutated in a Mendelian form of hypertension) and SPAK (a Ste 20 -type kinase known to interact with and phosphorylate other CCCs). WNK 3 is positioned upstream of SPAK and appears to be the chloride-sensitive kinase. Elimination of WNK 3 's unique SPAK-binding motif prevents its activation of NKCC 2, as does the mutation of threonines 96, 101, and 111. A catalytically inactive WNK 3 mutant also completely prevents NKCC 2 activation by <b>intracellular</b> chloride <b>depletion.</b> Together these data reveal a chloride-sensing mechanism that regulates NKCC 2 and provide insight into how increases in the level of intracellular chloride in TAL cells, as seen in certain pathological states, could drastically impair renal salt reabsorption...|$|R

Two families of zinc transporters control zinc homeostasis in organisms, {{but there is little}} information about their specific developmental roles. We show that the ZIP transporter Fear-of-intimacy (Foi) is necessary for the formation of Drosophila muscles. In foi mutants, myoblasts segregate normally, but their specification is affected, leading to the formation of a misshapen muscle pattern and distorted midgut. The observed phenotypes could be ascribed to the inactivation of specific zincfinger transcription factors (ZFTFs), supporting the hypothesis that they are a consequence of <b>intracellular</b> <b>depletion</b> of zinc. Accordingly, foi phenotypes can be rescued by mesodermal expression of other ZIP members with similar subcellular localization. We propose that Foi acts mostly as a transporter to regulate zinc intracellular homeostasis, thereby impacting on the activity of ZFTFs that control specific developmental processes.

Unexpectedly, iNOS cellular half-life was found to be relatively short. In primary bronchial epithelial cells, iNOS half-life was 1. 6 ± 0. 3 h. A similar half-life was found for iNOS in several cell lines. This fast rate of turnover is in sharp contrast to that reported for the constitutive NOS isoforms. iNOS half-life was not affected by <b>intracellular</b> <b>depletion</b> of tetrahydrobiopterin, a critical cofactor required for iNOS activity. Further, iNOS monomers and dimers had a similar half-life. Importantly, we discovered a previously unrecognized cotranslational down-regulation mechanism by which the newly discovered pyrimidineimidazole-based allosteric dimerization inhibitors of iNOS lead to reduced iNOS expression. This study provides insights into the cellular posttranslational mechanisms of iNOS and has important implications for design of selective iNOS inhibitors and their use in therapeutic strategies...|$|E
40|$|Inducible {{nitric oxide}} synthase (iNOS) is an homodimeric enzyme which {{produces}} large amounts of nitric oxide (NO) in response to inflammatory stimuli. Several factors affect the synthesis and catalytic activity of NOS. Particularly, dimerization of NOS monomers is promoted by heme, whereas an <b>intracellular</b> <b>depletion</b> of heme and/or L-arginine considerably decreases NOS resistance to proteolysis. In this study, we found that oxalomalate (OMA, oxalomalic acid, alpha-hydroxy-beta-oxalosuccinic acid), an inhibitor of both aconitase and NADP-dependent isocitrate dehydrogenase, inhibited nitrite production and NOS protein expression in lipopolysaccharide (LPS) -activated J 774 macrophages, without affecting NOS mRNA content. Furthermore, injection of OMA precursors to LPS-stimulated rats also decreased nitrite production and NOS expression in isolated peritoneal macrophages. Interestingly, alpha-ketoglutarate or succinyl-CoA administration reversed OMA effect on NO production, thus correlating NO biosynthesis with the anabolic capacity of Krebs cycle. When protein synthesis was blocked by cycloheximide in LPS-activated J 774 cells treated with OMA, NOS protein levels, evaluated by Western blot analysis and 35 S-metabolic labelling, were decreased, suggesting that OMA reduces NOS biosynthesis and induces {{an increase in the}} degradation rate of NOS protein. Moreover, we showed that OMA inhibits the activity of the NOS from lung of LPS-treated rats by enzymatic assay. Our results, demonstrating that OMA acts regulating synthesis, catalytic activity and degradation of NOS, suggest that this compound might have a potential role in reducing the NO overproduction occurring in some pathological conditions.

When insufficient phosphate and/or oxygen {{are available for}} high energy phosphate synthesis, cell homeostasis cannot be maintained and cell integrity may be impaired. The clinical consequences are recognized as occasional cause of morbidity and mortality. Although phosphate repletion has not been routinely recommended {{in the treatment of}} DKA, physicians should be aware of these clinical conditions and phosphate repletion in such situations should be considered.

40|$|The {{effect of}} {{verapamil}} on ethanol-induced gastric ulceration {{was investigated in}} rats. Orally administered ethanol (0. 5 ml), 10, 20 or 40 % v/v, dose dependently produced glandular lesions, ranging from petechiae to haemorrhagic ulcers. These lesions were worsened by verapamil (2, 4 or 8 mg/kg given intraperitoneally (i. p.) 30 min beforehand) in the 30 min and 2 h ethanol-exposure experiments. However, ethanol ulceration or its aggravation by verapamil was antagonized by calcium gluconate (112 or 224 mg/kg given per os (p. o.) 30 min before ethanol administration) in a dose-related manner. These findings suggest that <b>intracellular</b> calcium <b>depletion</b> in the gastric glandular mucosa may account for ethanol ulceration and the ulcer-aggravating action of verapamil. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|R
40|$|Overactivation {{of certain}} K+ {{channels}} can mediate excessive K+ efflux and <b>intracellular</b> K+ <b>depletion,</b> which are early ionic events in apoptotic cascade. The present investigation examined a possible {{role of the}} KCNQ 2 / 3 channel or M-channel (also named Kv 7. 2 / 7. 3 channels) in the pro-apoptotic process. Whole-cell recordings detected much larger M-currents (212 ± 31 [*]pA or 10. 5 ± 1. 5 [*]pA/pF) in cultured hippocampal neurons than that in cultured cortical neurons (47 ± 21 [*]pA or 2. 4 ± 0. 8 [*]pA/pF). KCNQ 2 / 3 channel openers N-ethylmaleimide (NEM) and flupirtine caused dose-dependent K+ efflux, <b>intracellular</b> K+ <b>depletion,</b> and cell death in hippocampal cultures, whereas little cell death was induced by NEM in cortical cultures. The NEM-induced cell death was antagonized by co-applied KCNQ channel inhibitor XE 991 (10 [*]μM), or by elevated extracellular K+ concentration. Supporting a mediating role of KCNQ 2 / 3 channels in apoptosis, expression of KCNQ 2 or KCNQ 2 / 3 channels in Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells initiated caspase- 3 activation. Consistently, application of NEM (20 [*]μM, 8 [*]h) in hippocampal cultures similarly caused caspase- 3 activation assessed by immunocytochemical staining and western blotting. NEM increased the expression of extracellular signal-regulated protein kinases 1 and 2 (ERK 1 / 2), induced mitochondria membrane depolarization, cytochrome c release, formation of apoptosome complex, and apoptosis-inducing factor (AIF) translocation into nuclear. All these events were attenuated by blocking KCNQ 2 / 3 channels. These findings provide novel evidence that KCNQ 2 / 3 channels could be an important regulator in neuronal apoptosis...|$|R
