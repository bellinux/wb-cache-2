50|$|In {{a strict}} {{accounting}} sense, share capital is the nominal value of issued shares (that is, {{the sum of}} their par values, as indicated on share certificates). If the allocation price of shares is greater than their par value, e.g. as in a rights issue, the shares {{are said to be}} sold at a premium (variously called share premium, additional paid-in capital or paid-in capital in excess of par). Commonly, the share capital is the total of the aforementioned nominal share capital and the premium share capital. Conversely, when shares are <b>issued</b> <b>below</b> <b>par,</b> they are said to be issued at a discount or part-paid.|$|R
50|$|Many common stocks issued {{today do}} not have par values; those that do (usually only in jurisdictions where par values are {{required}} by law) have extremely low par values (often the smallest unit of currency in circulation), for example a penny par value on a stock issued at USD$25/share. Most jurisdictions do not allow a company to <b>issue</b> stock <b>below</b> <b>par</b> value.|$|R
50|$|The {{par value}} of stock has no {{relation}} to market value and, as a concept, is somewhat archaic. The par value of a share is the value stated in the corporate charter below which shares of that class cannot be sold upon initial offering; the issuing company promises not to <b>issue</b> further shares <b>below</b> <b>par</b> value, so investors can be confident {{that no one else}} will receive a more favorable issue price. Thus, par value is the nominal value of a security which is determined by the issuing company to be its minimum price. This was far more important in unregulated equity markets than in the regulated markets that exist today, where a stock issuance prices must usually be published. The par value of stock remains unchanged in a bonus stock issue but it changes in a stock split.|$|R

5000|$|The {{response}} to the first Liberty Bond was unenthusiastic and although the $2 billion issue reportedly sold out, it probably {{had to be done}} <b>below</b> <b>par</b> because the notes traded consistently <b>below</b> <b>par</b> on the street. One reaction to this was to attack bond traders as [...] "unpatriotic" [...] if they sold <b>below</b> <b>par.</b> The Board of Governors of the New York Stock Exchange conducted an investigation of brokerage firms who sold <b>below</b> <b>par</b> to determine if [...] "pro-German influences" [...] were at work. The board forced one such broker to buy the bonds back at par and make a $100,000 donation to the Red Cross. Various explanations were offered for the weakness of the bonds ranging from German sabotage to the rich not buying the bonds because it would give an appearance of tax dodging (the bonds were exempt from some taxes).|$|R
