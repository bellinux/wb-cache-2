40|$|This bachelor’s {{thesis is}} based on the charred archaeobotanical {{material}} from a settlement at Eikebakken, Norway dated to the end of Bronze Age. The study focuses on determining the potential use of weeds and the oil plant flax (Linum usitatissimum). The archaeobotanical samples contained large amounts of charred <b>flax</b> <b>seeds,</b> and to determine whether it was used for oil or textile production a morphometric study of the material was undertaken and compared to other morphometric studies from Northern Europe. An experiment on modern <b>flax</b> <b>seeds,</b> carbonised at different temperatures, was used to expand current knowledge about how <b>flax</b> <b>seeds</b> change through the carbonisation process and why <b>flax</b> <b>seeds</b> are so rarely preserved in prehistoric contexts. The experiment results compared to the carbonized <b>flax</b> <b>seeds</b> from Eikebakken are shown with different diagrams and visualisations. The morphometric analysis together with the experiment provides new knowledge about the <b>flax</b> <b>seeds</b> complications with preservation and that flax in Norway's earliest stages was most likely grown for textile fibres, a contradiction to earlier assumptions...|$|R

40|$|Effects of aqueous {{methanolic}} extract of <b>Flax</b> <b>seeds</b> (Linum usitatissimum) on serum estradiol, progesterone {{and some}} biochemical metabolites in immature female rats were investigated. Thirty six immature female rats {{were divided into}} 3 equal groups. Rats of group A served as controls, while those of groups B and C were given crude extract of <b>Flax</b> <b>seeds</b> orally @ 500 mg/kg and estradiol @ 40 µg/kg body weight, respectively, daily for 14 days. After 7 days, 6 rats from each group were euthanized, while the remaining 6 rats in each group were killed 14 days after treatment. Blood samples were taken for serum biochemical analysis, while ovaries {{were used for the}} determination of ovarian cholesterol contents and histological studies. Body weight of rats given <b>Flax</b> <b>seeds</b> extract was higher (P< 0. 05) compared to control rats and those given estradiol. Serum estradiol, progesterone, total proteins and total cholesterol contents were higher (P< 0. 05) in rats given <b>Flax</b> <b>seeds</b> extract and estradiol compared to controls. The ovarian cholesterol contents were reduced in rats of both treatment groups (P< 0. 05). Serum ALT and AST activities were higher in <b>Flax</b> <b>seeds</b> treated rats compared to control, while it was not so in estradiol treated group. There was no difference in serum urea concentrations among rats of three groups. In conclusion, aqueous methanol extract of <b>Flax</b> <b>seeds</b> increased serum estradiol, progesterone, total proteins, total cholesterol, ALT and AST activity, and decreased ovarian cholesterol levels, while it had no effect on kidney function in immature female rats...|$|R

Concerning fresh meat, supplementing the animal diet with natural omega 3 {{seems to be}} the best way. However, omega 3 are fragile compounds with a high susceptibility to lipid oxidation. In Reunion Island, a study called NUTRIVOL aimed to enrich poultry meat with omega 3 by providing the animals a diet enriched with <b>flax</b> <b>seeds</b> and vitamin E as antioxidant. For 3 different diets, 160 labelled yellow female chickens were raised.

They definitely merit being included on any top-ten top list of {{foods that are}} good for life. Flax {{is not a new}} food. It is actually one of the older and, perhaps, one of the original "health foods, " ds, " treasured because of its healing properties throughout the Roman Empire [...] Flax was one of the original "medicines " used by Hippocrates. Flax could be dubbed the "forgotten oil. " It has fallen out of favor because oil manufacturers have found nutritious oils to be less profitable. Outcome: The very nutrients that give flax its nutritional benefits- essential fatty acids- also give it a short shelf life, making it more expensive to produce, transport, and store. Besides being the best source of omega 3 's, 's, flax oil is a good source of omega 6, or linoleic acid (LA). Sunflower, safflower, and sesame oil are greater sources of omega 6 fatty acids but they don't contain any omega- 3 fatty acids. Flax oil is 45 to 60 percent the omega- 3 fatty acid alphalinolenic nic acid (ALA). In addition to nutritious fats, <b>flax</b> <b>seeds</b> contain other nutrients which make eating the whole seed superior to consuming just the extracted oil...|$|R
