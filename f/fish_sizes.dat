40|$|Historic {{and current}} {{information}} on the grouper fishery from Hong Kong and adjacent waters reveals significant changes in species composition and <b>fish</b> <b>sizes</b> over the past 50 years in this important Asian centre for seafood consumption. Once dominant, large groupers are now rare and small species and sizes prevail in the present-day fishery. Juveniles comprise over 80 % of marketed fish by number among the most commonly retailed groupers, and reproductive-sized fish are absent among larger species. Current fishery practices {{and the lack of}} management in Hong Kong and adjacent waters pose a significant threat to large species with limited geographic distribution such as Epinephelus akaara and Epinephelus bruneus, both now listed as threatened by the IUCN. The heavy reliance on juveniles, not only for groupers, but for an increasing diversity of desired fishes within Asia, potentially reduces stock spawning potential. The 'shrinking baseline' in terms of a progressive reduction in <b>fish</b> <b>sizes</b> being marketed in the region can seriously undermine fishery sustainability and recoverability of depleted fish stocks. Fishing pressure on groupers and other valuable food fishes within the Asia-Pacific is intensifying, the declining long-term trend of grouper landings in Hong Kong and the increasing focus on juveniles for immediate sale or for mariculture 'grow-out' signal a worrying direction for regional fisheries. Moreover, the common appearance of small groupers for sale will influence public perception regarding what are 'normal-sized' fish.

Water temperature strongly influences growth in fish; however, its effect on sturgeon immune responses is unknown. The objective {{of this study was}} to assess how 2 different temperatures affect immune responses in shortnose sturgeon (Acipenser brevirostrum) relevant immune organs such as the meningeal myeloid tissue, spleen, thymus and skin. These responses were studied in 2 different sizes of same age juvenile sturgeon kept at either 11 °C or 20 °C (4 treatment groups), before and after exposure to an ectoparasitic copepod (Dichelesthium oblongum). Based on a differential cell count, temperature was found to strongly influence immune cell production in the meningeal myeloid tissue, regardless of the <b>fish</b> <b>sizes</b> considered. Morphometric analysis of splenic white pulp showed a transient response to temperature. There were no differences between the groups in the morphometric analysis of thymus size. Splenic IRF- 1 and IRF- 2 had similar expression profiles, significantly higher in fish kept at 20 °C for the first 6 weeks of the study but not by 14 weeks. In the skin, IRF- 1 was significantly higher in the fish kept at 11 °C over the first 6 weeks of the study. IRF- 2 had a similar profile but there were no differences between the groups by the end of the trial. In conclusion, higher water temperatures (up to 20 °C) may have beneficial effects in maximizing growth and improving immunological capacity, regardless of the <b>fish</b> <b>sizes</b> considered in this study...|$|E

The excretion rates of ammonia, urea, and fluorescamine-positive substances were also monitored. Neither <b>fish</b> <b>size</b> nor ration had any effect on the factorial aerobic scope of feeding, which suggests that cellular metabolic processes associated with feeding were satiated by relatively small meals. The factorial scope in ammonia excretion was affected by both ration and <b>fish</b> <b>size,</b> indicating that respiration and excretion respond to a meal independently. The duration of the specific dynamic action response (240 - 390 h) increased with <b>fish</b> <b>size</b> but not ration, whereas both the time to reach the peak oxygen consumption and the duration of the ammonia response increased with ration but not <b>fish</b> <b>size.</b> The percentage of the ingested energy that was expended following feeding (the specific dynamic action coefficient) was high at low rations (approximately 56 %) but lower (roughly 10 %) at satiation rations.

The authors test the hypotheses that the swimming endurance of American plaice (Hippoglossoides platessoides) is independent of fish size and water temperature. Using a swimming flume, swimming endurance was examined across a range of <b>fish</b> <b>sizes</b> (14 – 44 cm) and water temperatures (" 0. 2 to 9. 7) C). All trials were conducted at a swimming speed of 0. 30 ms" 1. This is comparable to the swimming speeds required by flatfish during herding by bottom-trawl sweeps. The data were analysed using failure time (survival) analysis, a more robust statistical technique for endurance-type data. The advantage of this technique over traditional regression analyses is that censored observations can be included in the analysis. An important distinction, however, is that the dependent variable being modelled was not endurance per se, but the instantaneous rate of exhaustion, or hazard rate at a given time t. The results showed that both fish length and water temperature had a negative eVect on the endurance hazard rate. This is equivalent to an increase in the probability of American plaice achieving a given endurance with increasing fish length and water temperature. This was suYcient evidence to reject the null hypotheses that the swimming endurance of American plaice is independent of these variables. Probability curves for the distances the fish would be capable of swimming were calculated for diVerent <b>fish</b> <b>sizes</b> and water temperatures. The findings suggest that the herding eYciency of American plaice by bottom-trawl sweeps may be largely size- and temperature-dependent...|$|E

Estimates of length-based reproductive parameters are particularly important for determining potential annual fecundity {{as a function of}} <b>fish</b> <b>size,</b> but they are often difficult to estimate reliably. Here we provide new information on the reproductive dynamics of southern bluefin tuna (SBT) Thunnus maccoyii through the analysis of <b>fish</b> <b>size</b> and ovary histology collected on the spawning ground in 1993 - 1995 and 1999 - 2002. These are used to refine previous parameter estimates of spawning dynamics and investigate size related trends in these parameters. Our results suggest that the small SBT tend to arrive on the spawning ground slightly later and depart earlier in the spawning season relative to large fish. All females were mature and the majority were classed as spawning capable (actively spawning or non-spawning) with a very small proportion classed as regressing. The fraction of females spawning per day decreased with <b>fish</b> <b>size,</b> but once females start a spawning episode, they spawned daily irrespective of size.

Accuracy of cumulative consumption predictions was also tested for one of the models. Model errors for predicting relative growth rate of individual fish were regressed on observed mean daily consumption rate to assess whether consumption-dependent prediction error commonly observed in bioenergetics models for other fish species was exhibited by the two brown trout bioenergetics models. Both models yielded unbiased estimates of brown trout growth that were within 1 - 12 % of observed values across the range of <b>fish</b> <b>sizes,</b> water temperatures, and ration levels tested. Bonferroni joint 95 % confidence intervals for the slopes and intercepts of regressions of predicted final weight on observed final weight included a slope of 1 and a y-intercept of 0 for both models. No significant inter-model differences in percent error for predicting final weight of fish in feeding trials were observed. Predicted cumulative consumption values were within 8 - 15 % of corresponding observed values. Neither model exhibited significant consumption-dependent error for predicting brown trout growth, in contrast to results of several previous laboratory evaluations of bioenergetics models for other fish species. Absence of consumption-dependent error in the two brown trout models may be due to incorporation of feeding rate-dependence of egestion and excretion in these models and that egestion and excretion parameters were not borrowed from other species.

40|$|Although sound {{production}} in teleost fish is {{often associated with}} territorial behaviour, little is known of fish acoustic behaviour in other agonistic contexts such as competitive feeding and how it changes during ontogeny. The grey gurnard, Eutrigla gurnardus, frequently emits knock and grunt sounds during competitive feeding and seems to adopt both contest and scramble tactics under defensible resource conditions. Here we examine, for the first time, the effect of <b>fish</b> <b>size</b> on sound production and agonistic behaviour during competitive feeding. We have made sound (alone) and video (synchronized image and sound) recordings of grey gurnards during competitive feeding interactions. Experimental fish ranged from small juveniles to large adults and were grouped in four size classes: 10 – 15, 15 – 20, 25 – 30 and 30 – 40 cm in total length. We show that, in this species, both sound production and feeding behaviour change with <b>fish</b> <b>size.</b> Sound production rate decreased in larger fish. Sound duration, pulse duration and the number of pulses increased whereas the peak frequency decreased with <b>fish</b> <b>size,</b> in both sound types (knocks and grunts). Interaction rate and the frequency of agonistic behaviour decreased with increasing <b>fish</b> <b>size</b> during competitive feeding sessions. The proportion of feeding interactions accompanied by sound production was similar in all size classes. However, the proportion of interactions accompanied by knocks (less aggressive sounds) and by grunts (more aggressive) increased and decreased with <b>fish</b> <b>size,</b> respectively. Taken together, these results suggest that smaller grey gurnards compete for food by contest tactics whereas larger specimens predominantly scramble for food, probably because body size gives an advantage in locating, capturing and handling prey. We further suggest that sounds emitted during feeding may potentially give information on the motivation and ability of the individual to compete for food resources...|$|R
40|$|This study {{aimed at}} {{determining}} the food particle sizes (diameter) that produce the fastest growth (S-opt) in juvenile Nile tilapia, and modeling the growth penalties for particles departing from S-opt. Three 14 -day experiments were run with 3, 7 and 11 g juveniles, which {{were raised in}} 120 -L flow-through cylindro-conical tanks at 29 +/- 1 degrees C, fed at the optimum feeding level (R-opt) and weighed at weekly intervals. In each experiment, four different sizes of pellets (diameter) were evaluated (0. 5 -mm intervals, 1. 0 - 3. 5 mm; three replications per pellet size). At {{the end of each}} experiment, food intake and gastric evacuation rate were determined by radiographic methods following the use of ballotini labelled feed. The results indicate that i) in all experiments, specific growth rates (SGRs) are significantly depressed for the largest particles; ii) S-opt increases with increasing <b>fish</b> <b>size</b> (1. 4 mm at 3 g, to 2. 5 mm at 20 g); iii) the optimum particle size relative to mouth width (MW) varies only slightly with <b>fish</b> <b>size</b> (28 to 25 % MW from 3 to 20 g); iv) growth heterogeneity is proportional to food particle size; and, v) food intake and gastric evacuation rates are inversely proportional to food particle size. A growth model (SGR) was constructed with a stepwise multiple-regression analysis against <b>fish</b> <b>size,</b> feeding level and food particle size (R- 2 = 0. 853, df = 71). For a particular <b>fish</b> <b>size,</b> the growth-to-particle size relationship is a log-log second order polynomial, which implies that the growth penalty is more severe when fish are fed small than large particles. By contrast, application of food particles slightly smaller than S-opt tends to minimize growth heterogeneity.

40|$|Most {{fisheries}} {{select the}} size of fish to be caught (are size selective), and many factors, including gear, market demands, species distributions, fishery laws, and the behavior of both fishermen and fish, can contribute to that selectivity.

The targeting behavior of fishermen is another key reason commercial and recreational fisheries tend to be size-selective. The more successful fishermen constantly seek areas and methods that yield larger or more profitable sizes of fish. Fishery regulations, especially size limits, produce size-selective harvests.

First, we evaluated the effects of different hooksizes on catch (number of individuals and species composition) and yield (biomass). Results showed how the number of captures was significantly reduced when using large hooks but bigger specimens and more valued species were caught. Moreover, the total yield remained unchanged, and the incidence of under-sized fish was significantly reduced.
