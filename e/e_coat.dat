40|$|In {{the first}} study of this thesis 10 males and 10 females walked on a {{treadmill}} with a ~ 10 km/h wind and an ambient temperature of - 8 °C. The hypotheses tested included: 1) females will have lower skin temperature and surface heat flux while all other physiological responses are similar when compared to male, 2) within each sex, an elasticized (<b>E)</b> <b>coat</b> versus a non-elasticized (NE) coat would give a diminished physiological strain and 3) that within each sex, the <b>E</b> <b>coat</b> versus the NE coat would give a better thermal comfort. Results in this first study showed some differences in physiological responses between the sexes, that males had higher thermal comfort ratings in an E versus a NE coat during exercise (p< 0. 05). In the second study, {{it was hypothesized that}} females would have greater sensitivity to skin temperature changes than males on the hand, back and chest. The results showed females versus males were less sensitive to temperature changes only on the chest (p < 0. 05). In conclusion, in {{the first study}} some physiological responses differed between the sexes, the E compared to the NE coat provided no beneficial physiological responses within each sex and finally the E versus the NE coat provided greater thermal comfort in males.

Virus isolates {{from all these}} trees were serologically typed by DASI-ELISA using four strain-specific monoclonal antibodies (Mabs). One isolate (PPV-BR) was also characterized by RFLP analy-sis of PCR products derived from two genome regions, i. <b>e.</b> <b>coat</b> protein (CP) and P 3 - 6 K 1. PPV-BR {{proved to be a}} recombinant as it typed as PPV-M by strain-specif-ic Mabs and RFLP analysis of the CP gene, but as PPV-D by analysis of the P 3 - 6 K 1 gene. Sequence analysis of the (Cter) NIb-(Nter) CP region of this recombinant showed that the recombination breakpoint was located in the C terminus of the NIb gene, as has been reported for other recognized PPV recombinants.

40|$|The melanocortin {{receptor}} 1 (MC 1 R) plays {{a central}} role in regulation of eumelanin (black/brown) and phaeomelanin (red/yellow) synthesis within the mammalian melanocyte and is encoded by the classical Extension (<b>E)</b> <b>coat</b> color locus. Sequence analysis of MC 1 R from seven porcine breeds revealed a total of four allelic variants corresponding to five different E alleles. The European wild boar possessed a unique MC 1 R allele that we believe is required for the expression of a wild-type coat color. Two different MC 1 R alleles were associated with the dominant black color in pigs. MC 1 R* 2 was found in European Large Black and Chinese Meishan pigs and exhibited two missense mutations compared with the wild-type sequence. Comparative data strongly suggest that one of these, L 99 P, may form a constitutively active receptor. MC 1 R* 3 was associated with the black color in the Hampshire breed and involved a single missense mutation D 121 N. This same MC 1 R variant was also associated with EP, which results in black spots on a white or red background. Two different missense mutations were identified in recessive red (e/e) animals. One of these, A 240 T, occurs at a highly conserved position, making it a strong candidate for disruption of receptor function...|$|E

Silicide coatings have been used with success to protect Mo from oxidation. The oxidation protection of Mo-Re, however, appears to [...] ...|$|R
40|$|Abstract Background In the {{domestic}} rabbit (Oryctolagus cuniculus), classical genetic studies have identified five alleles at the Extension locus: E D (dominant black), E S (steel, weaker version of E D), E (wild type, normal extension of black), e J (Japanese brindling, mosaic distribution {{of black and}} yellow) and e (non-extension of black, yellow/red with white belly). Sequencing almost the complete coding sequence (CDS) of the rabbit MC 1 R gene, we recently identified two in-frame deletions associated with dominant black (c. 280 _ 285 del 6; alleles E D or E S) and recessive red (c. 304 _ 333 del 30; allele <b>e)</b> <b>coat</b> colours. It remained to characterize the e J allele whose phenotypic effect {{is similar to the}} Orange and Sex-linked yellow loci of cat and Syrian hamster. Results We sequenced the whole CDS in 25 rabbits of different coat colours including 10 Japanese and 10 Rhinelander (tricolour) rabbits and identified another 6 bp-in frame deletion flanked by a G > A transition in 5 ' (c. [124 G>A; 125 _ 130 del 6]) that was present in all animals with Japanese brindling coat colour and pattern. These mutations eliminate two amino acids in the first transmembrane domain and, in addition, cause an amino acid substitution at position 44 of the wild type sequence. Genotyping 371 rabbits of 31 breeds with different coat colour this allele (e J) was present in homozygous state in Japanese, Rhinelander and Dutch tricolour rabbits only (except one albino rabbit). Rabbits with e J / e J genotype were non fixed at the non-agouti mutation we previously identified in the ASIP gene. Segregation in F 1 and F 2 families confirmed the order of dominance already determined by classical genetic experiments with a possible dose effect evident comparing e J / e J and e J / e animals. MC 1 R mRNA was expressed in black hair skin regions only. Conclusions The c.

40|$|We {{explored}} {{the relationship between}} phagocytosis and the triggering of oxidative metabolism using resident, lipopolysaccharide (LPS) -elicited, and bacille Calmette-Guerin (BCG) -activated murine peritoneal macrophages. Sheep erythrocytes (<b>E)</b> <b>coated</b> with IgG [E(IgG) ], <b>E</b> <b>coated</b> with IgM and complement [E(IgM) C], and E treated with 1 % glutaraldehyde (GE) were used as stimuli. All three types of macrophages released superoxide anion (O 2 -) during phagocytosis of E(IgG). All macrophage types phagocytosed E(IgM) C and GE but none were stimulated to release O 2 - during phagocytosis of these particles. Vigorous consumption of oxygen was also stimulated by the ingestion of E(IgG) but not by ingestion of E(IgM) C or GE. E(IgM) C did not scavenge the O 2 - released from macrophages during phagocytosis of E(IgG) or during exposure to phorbol myristate acetate, and further addition of IgG anti-E antibody to E(IgM) C or GE permitted optimal stimulation of macrophage O 2 - release by these particles. The capacity of macrophages to ingest E(IgM) C and GE without stimulating the respiratory burst {{raises the possibility that}} clearance of particulate matter not opsonized with specific IgG might be achieved without stimulation of the release of toxic oxygen metabolites, and, therefore, without the risk of oxidative damage to the phagocytic cell or surrounding tissue...|$|R

40|$|In this study, {{an attempt}} was made to improve the packing density of calcium {{phosphate}} (CaP) coating on a magnesium alloy by tailoring the coating solution for enhanced degradation resistance of the alloy for implant applications. An organic solvent, ethanol, was added to the coating solution to decrease the conductivity of the coating solution so that hydrogen bubble formation/bursting reduces during the CaP coating process. Experimental results confirmed that ethanol addition to the coating solution reduces the conductivity of the solution and also decreases the hydrogen evolution/bubble bursting. In vitro electrochemical experiments, that is, electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) and potentiodynamic polarization showed that CaP coating produced in 30 % (v/v) ethanol containing <b>coating</b> solution (3 <b>E)</b> exhibits significantly higher degradation resistance (i. e., ~ 50 % higher polarization resistance and ~ 60 % lower corrosion current) than the aqueous solution coating. Scanning electron microscope (SEM) analysis of the coatings revealed that the packing of 3 <b>E</b> <b>coating</b> was denser than that of aqueous coating, which {{can be attributed to the}} lower hydrogen evolution in the former than in the latter. Further increase in the ethanol content in the coating solution was not beneficial; in fact, the coating produced in 70 % (v/v) ethanol containing solution (7 E) showed degradation resistance much inferior to that of the aqueous coating, which is due to low thickness of 7 <b>E</b> <b>coating...</b>|$|R

40|$|Effect {{of vitamin}} E on lipid {{metabolism}} and atherosclerosis in ESRD patientsBackgroundOxidative stress is enhanced {{in patients with}} end-stage renal disease (ESRD) undergoing hemodialysis (HD). Bioincompatibility represents {{an important source of}} reactive oxygen species. HD patients exhibit altered anti-oxida-tive defences and anti-oxidative vitamins such as vitamin E and C are altered in uremia. Frequently, HD patients also suffer from atherosclerotic cardiac disease. We have previously reported that low density lipoprotein (LDL) of HD patients is rich in malondialdehyde (MDA), an end product of lipid peroxidation. MDA rich LDL is thought to be an atherogenic lipoprotein due to its enhancement of macrophage foam cell formation. MethodsWe conducted a controlled study for two years comparing the effects of a vitamin <b>E</b> <b>coated</b> cellulose membrane dialyzer and an ordinary cellulose membrane dialyzer on lipid metabolism and the progress of atherosclerosis. LDL-MDA and oxidized LDL (ox-LDL) were measured in HD patients using these two types of dialyzers. Plasma vitamin E and lipid concentrations were also evaluated. The aortic calcification index (ACI) was evaluated by CT scan to assess the progress of atherosclerosis before and for every year after treatment. ResultsUse of a vitamin <b>E</b> <b>coated</b> cellulose membrane dia-lyzer for six months, one year and two years resulted in a significant reduction in LDL-MDA and ox-LDL compared to the ordinary cellulose membrane dialyzer. Treatment with a vitamin E-coated dialyzer significantly reduced the percentage increase in ACI after 24 months compared to the control. There were no significant changes in plasma vitamin E and lipid concentrations between the two groups. ConclusionsThese results suggest that the oxidative stress {{could be one of the}} stimulating factors of abnormal lipid metabolism and atherosclerosis in ESRD patients...|$|R

Specificity of these rosettes was shown with chronic lymphocytic leukaemias {{of either the}} kappa or lambda type. T+ cells were enumerated by a new indirect rosette technique in which the lymphocytes were initially treated with rabbit anti-human thymus cell antiserum followed by direct rosetting with human <b>E</b> <b>coated</b> with purified anti-rabbit light chain antibody. For normal individuals, 24 - 32 % Ig+ T- cells and 65 - 71 % Ig- T+ cells were found among the lymphocytes of peripheral blood as well as tonsils with these rosette methods. The Ficoll-Hypaque method was used to obtain purified Ig- T+ and Ig+ T- cells by removing rosetted Ig+ cells or T+ cells, respectively. The purity of the Ig- T+ cells was indicated by greater than 99 % indirect rosetting of cells sensitized with anti-human thymus cell antibody (Ab) and by less than 1 % direct rosetting with anti-kappa Ab-E+ anti-lambda Ab-E. The purity of the Ig+ T- cells obtained was indicated by 92 - 96 % direct rosetting with anti-kappa Ab-E+anti-lambda Ab-E and by less than 1 % indirect rosetting with anti-human thymus cell antibody. A small percentage of Ig- T- 'null' cells could not be identified by either reagent.

This MAb was tested for its reactivity with mouse neutrophil and eosinophil FcR, and for its ability to block the binding of sheep erythrocytes (<b>E)</b> <b>coated</b> with mouse antibodies of different isotypes to granulocytes. The use of E conjugated with fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC) allowed an objective read-out by flow cytometry. The MAb 2. 4. G 2 reacted with both neutrophil and eosinophil FcR, blocking the binding of <b>E</b> <b>coated</b> with mouse IgG 1, IgG 2 a and IgG 2 b in a dose-dependent manner. Blocking was specific, since it did not occur with any of several control MAb of the same rat isotype (IgG 2 b) as 2. 4. G 2. Furthermore, the binding to E through the granulocyte receptor for complement (C) was unaffected. IgG 3 was unable to promote binding of E to either neutrophils or eosinophils, although it induced high levels of binding to macrophages. These results show that: (i) neutrophil, eosinophil and macrophage FcR have antigenic similarities; (ii) neutrophils and eosinophils, in contrast to macrophages, either have a common FcR for IgG 1, IgG 2 a and IgG 2 b, or have different FcR for these isotypes which share the antigenic determinant recognized by 2. 4.

We found that growing MTs in Aspergillus nidulans merge at the center of fast growing tips and discovered that a kinesin motor protein, KipA, related to Tea 2 p of Schizosaccharomyces pombe, is required for this process. In a ΔkipA strain, MT plus ends reach the tip but show continuous lateral movement. Hyphae lose directionality and grow in curves, apparently due to mislocalization of the vesicle supply center (Spitzenkörper) in the apex. Green fluorescent protein (GFP) -KipA accumulates at MT plus ends, whereas a KipA rigor mutant protein, GFP-KipAG 223 <b>E,</b> <b>coated</b> MTs evenly. These findings suggest that KipA requires its intrinsic motor activity to reach the MT plus end. Using KipA as an MT plus-end marker, we found bidirectional organization of MTs and determined the locations of microtubule organizing centers at nuclei, in the cytoplasm, and at septa...|$|R
40|$|Demonstration and {{characterization}} of C 3 receptors on rat glomerular epithelial cells. Receptors for C 3 {{have been demonstrated}} on the glomerular podocyte in humans. There is conflicting evidence regarding the presence of C 3 receptors on rat glomerular cells. Even when shown to be present, the ligand specificity of the receptor has not been determined. Decapsulated rat glomeruli obtained from male Sprague–Dawley rats weighing 50 to 100 g were placed in enriched culture media. On days four to eight, cells of epithelial morphology were observed growing out of glomeruli. Receptors for C 3 were detected by rosette formation of sheep erythrocytes (<b>E)</b> <b>coated</b> with antibody (A) and complement (EAC) around the glomerular epithelial cells in culture. The EACs were prepared by incubating antibody–coated sheep erythrocytes with C 5 -deficient mouse serum or with individual components of complement. Results indicate the presence of two types of C 3 receptors on glomerular epithelial cells—CR 1 for C 3 b and CR 2 for C 3 d. The functional roles of these receptors remain to be elucidated...|$|R
40|$|The {{present study}} characterizes {{the effect of}} two nitric oxide (NO) donors, S-nitrosoglutathione (GSNO) and sodium nitroprusside (SNP), {{on the ability of}} {{neutrophils}} to perform different responses triggered by immune complexes (IC). Pretreatment of neutrophils with either GSNO or SNP exerted a biphasic action on antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC) performed against erythrocytes (<b>E)</b> <b>coated</b> with IgG antibodies (IgG-E), depending on the amount of IgG employed. While with high amounts of antibodies ADCC was markedly inhibited, at low amounts of antibodies it was significantly increased. Both effects were prevented by haemoglobin, a NO scavenger. Moreover, these effects were reproduced by the cell-permeable analogue of cGMP, dibutyryl cGMP (Bt 2 cGMP). Other neutrophil functions triggered by IgG-E were also examined. It was found that NO donors did not affect either the phagocytosis of IgG-E or the emission of chemiluminescence (CL). Finally, neutrophil functions triggered by soluble IC (sIC) and precipitating IC (pIC) were analysed. It was observed that NO donors did not modify either cytotoxicity performed towards non-sensitized target cells or CL emission. The significance of these results is discussed...|$|R
40|$|The {{inhibition}} of Fc receptor (FcR) a function {{that occurs when}} macrophages are plated on surfaces coated with antigen-antibody complexes {{is due to the}} physical removal of these receptors from the nonadherent surface of the cell's plasma membrane (1). In the studies reported here we analyze the mechanism of removal of the trypsinresistant FcRII of mouse macrophages from this segment of the cell's plasma membrane. Our results show that this receptor diffuses rapidly in the plasma membrane and that this leads to the entrapment of FcRII molecules in the portion of the plasma membrane in contact with substrate-adherent immune complexes. Materials and Methods Resident and thioglycoilate broth-elicited macrophages, immunoglobulins, dinitrophenyl (DNP) -poly-L-l~sine(PLL) -coated coverslips, binding and ingestion of IgG-eoated erythrocytes, and binding of 25 I-monoclonal antibodies were obtained and used as described (1). Rabbit IgG against bovine serum albumin (RaBSA IgG), sheep erythrocytes (<b>E)</b> <b>coated</b> with rabbit IgG (Cordis Laboratories, Inc., Miami, FL) or with rabbit IgM (Cordis Laboratories) and mouse complement [E(IgM) C] were prepared as described (2) ...|$|R

40|$|Phagocytic cells (neutrophils, monocytes, and macrophages) possess {{at least}} two {{distinct}} receptors for the third component of complement, C 3. Complement receptor type 1 (CR 1) 1 is specific for C 3 b, while complement receptor type 3 (CR 3) is specific for the C 3 b cleavage product iC 3 b (1). In addition, monocytes may also express a CRy-like receptor that is specific for the d region of iC 3 b, C 3 d,g, and C 3 d (2, 3). CRI and CR 3 on neutrophils and monocytes promote phagocytosis of C 3 -coated particles mainly by promoting adherence of the particle to the phagocyte's surface (4, 5). In contrast, complement receptors (CR) on human and mouse macrophages may promote both binding and phagocytosis of C 3 -coated particles, depending on the in vitro or in vivo conditions from which the macrophages were obtained (6 - 10). The data on CR function has been derived from studies using sheep erythrocytes (<b>E)</b> <b>coated</b> with C 3 using purified complement (C) components, mouse serum, or human serum. However, {{little is known about}} the actual C 3 fragments that might be encountered by phagocytes in vivo...|$|R
5000|$|Fogle {{teamed up}} with Cracknell once again, {{together}} with <b>Ed</b> <b>Coats,</b> a Bristol-based doctor, as Team QinetiQ {{to take part in}} the inaugural [...] "Amundsen Omega 3 South Pole Race". Six teams set out to race across the Antarctic Plateau to commemorate the historic race of 1911 between Roald Amundsen and Robert Falcon Scott. Having led the race for much of the time, the team took 18 days, 5 hours and 10 minutes to complete the 770 km race, coming second overall, 20 hours behind the Norwegian team, who commended them on making it [...] "a fantastic race", and over 2 days ahead of the next placed team. Fogle suffered hypothermia and frostbite to his nose and the team experienced temperatures as low as -40 C. The race was filmed by the BBC for the series On Thin Ice and was aired in Summer 2009. Five episodes of On Thin Ice were broadcast on BBC Two Sunday evenings receiving a peak record of 3.7 million viewers. Macmillan published an account of their journey, Race to The Pole, which became a top-10 best-seller in the UK.|$|R
