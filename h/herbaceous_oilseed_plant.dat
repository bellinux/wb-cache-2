40|$|AbstractThe {{germination}} {{process of}} <b>oilseed</b> <b>plants</b> {{is characterized by}} a mobilization of the storage lipids which constitute the major carbon source for the growing seedling. Despite the physiological importance of the lipid mobilization, the mechanism of this process is not well understood. Recently, it was found that a specific linoleate 13 -lipoxygenase is induced during the stage of lipid mobilization in various <b>oilseed</b> <b>plants</b> and that this enzyme is translocated to the membranes of the lipid storage organelles, the so called lipid bodies. Lipoxygenase expression was paralleled by the occurrence of enantiospecific hydro(pero) xy polyenoic fatty acid derivatives in the storage lipids suggesting the in vivo action of the enzyme. Furthermore, it was reported that oxygenated polyenoic fatty acids, in particular as 13 (S) -hydro(pero) xy- 9 (Z), 11 (E) -octadecanoic acid [13 (S) -H(P) ODE], are cleaved preferentially from the storage lipids when compared with their non-oxygenated linoleate residues. These findings may suggest that 13 (S) -H(P) ODE may constitute the endogenous substrate for β-oxidation during lipid mobilization of <b>oilseed</b> <b>plants...</b>|$|R

There were 8 species found {{at the same time}} at Lwiro and Idjwi Island ecosystems. The trees morphological type is the most abundant in the two stations (Lwiro and Nyamusisi) than in Washiha and more in Nyamusisi. The dominant families are Euphorbiaceae and Fabaceae.

METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: We applied next-generation Illumina sequencing technology to analyze global gene expression profiles of developing physic nut seeds 14, 19, 25, 29, 35, 41, and 45 days after pollination (DAP). The acquired profiles reveal the key genes, and their expression timeframes, involved in major metabolic processes including: carbon flow, starch metabolism, and synthesis of storage lipids and proteins in the developing seeds. The main period of storage reserves synthesis in the seeds appears to be 29 - 41 DAP, and the fatty acid composition of the developing seeds is consistent with relative expression levels of different isoforms of acyl-ACP thioesterase and fatty acid desaturase genes. Several transcription factor genes whose expression coincides with storage reserve deposition correspond to those known to regulate the process in Arabidopsis. CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: The results will facilitate searches for genes that influence de novo lipid synthesis, accumulation and their regulatory networks in developing physic nut seeds, and other oil seeds. Thus, they will be helpful in attempts to modify these plants for efficient biofuel production...|$|R

40|$|The {{harvest of}} the first {{commercial}} crop of a genetically engineered <b>oilseed</b> <b>plant</b> took place last summer, in the south-east of America. The rapeseed plant had been altered by the biotechnology company Calgene of Davis, California, to produce tropical oils similar to those more usually extracted from coconuts and palm kernels. One of the critics of this development is the Rural Advancement Foundation International (RAFI), a group that campaigns on behalf of farmers in poor countries. Hope Shand, research director at RAFI, fears that such developments would {{have a major impact}} tin the countries that depend on sales of 'naturally, produced' coconut and palm oil which, in many cases, comes from small farmers who grow coconut or oil palm alongside other crops. Hope Shand believes that this genetically engineered oilseed rape {{is a perfect example of}} how genetic engineering may impoverish the Third World rather than helping it to develop. In reply, Roger Salameh, a market analyst with Calgene, says that the altered rapeseed poses no threat to the countries which produce tropical oils because their aim is to produce a reliable oil source to buffer the US market from the wildly fluctuating crops of tropical countries. In 1993 the US imported 600, 000 tonnes of lauric oil, while Calgene's goal for the new rapeseed plant is to produce only about 10 % of the lauric oils used in the US.

40|$|We have {{analyzed}} the {{temporal and spatial}} expression of genes encoding the glycoxylate cycle enzymes isocitrate lyase and malate synthase in Brassica napus L. {{to determine whether they}} are coordinately expressed. Both enzymes participate in reactions associated with lipid mobilization in <b>oilseed</b> <b>plant</b> seedlings and are sequestered in a specialized organelle, the glyoxysome. We have identified an isocitrate lyase cDNA clone containing the complete protein coding region.

The mRNAs begin to accumulate during late embryogeny, reach maximal levels in seedling cotyledons, are not detected at significant amounts in leaves, and are distributed similarly in cotyledons and axes of seedlings. Furthermore, transcription studies with isolated nuclei indicate that the genes are controlled primarily although not exclusively at the transcriptional level.

40|$|Background: Insect pollinators play an {{important}} role in crop pollination, but the relative contribution of wild pollinators and honey bees to pollination is currently under debate. There is virtually no information available on the strength of pollination services and the identity of pollination service providers from Asian smallholder farming systems, where fields are small, and variation among fields is high. We established 18 winter oilseed rape (Brassica napus L.) fields along a large geographical gradient in Jiangxi province in China. In each field, <b>oilseed</b> rape <b>plants</b> were grown in closed cages that excluded pollinators and open cages that allowed pollinator access. The pollinator community was sampled by pan traps for the entire oilseed rape blooming period. Results: <b>Oilseed</b> rape <b>plants</b> from which insect pollinators were excluded had on average 38 % lower seed set, 17 % lower fruit set and 12 % lower yield per plant, but the seeds were 17 % heavier, and the caged plants had 28 % more flowers and 18 % higher aboveground vegetative biomass than plants with pollinator access. <b>Oilseed</b> rape <b>plants</b> thus compensate for pollination deficit by producing heavier seeds and more flowers. Regression analysis indicated that local abundance and diversity of wild pollinators were positively associated with seed set and yield/straw ratio, while honey bee abundance was not related to yield parameters. Conclusions: Wild pollinator abundance and diversity contribute to oilseed rape yield by enhancing plant resource allocation to seeds rather than to above-ground biomass. This study highlights the importance of the conservation of wild pollinators to support oilseed rape production in small-holder farming systems in China. </p...|$|R

Here, we describe seedling plastid development 1 (spd 1), an Arabidopsis seedling albino mutant {{capable of producing}} normal green vegetative tissues. Mutant seedlings also display defects in etioplast and amyloplast development. Precocious germination of spd 1 embryos showed that the albino seedling phenotype of spd 1 was dependent on the passage of developing embryos through the degreening and dehydration stages of seed maturation, suggesting that SPD 1 is critical during eoplast development or early stages of eoplast redifferentiation. The SPD 1 gene was found to encode a protein containing a putative chloroplast-targeting sequence in its amino terminus and also domains common to P-loop ATPases. Chloroplast localization of the SPD 1 protein was confirmed by targeting assays in vivo and in vitro.

40|$|Abstract: At {{the present}} time, {{the most widely}} used machine for seed and <b>oilseed</b> <b>planting</b> is a seed drill with a roller-type-metering device. Due to {{nonuniform}} spacing of seeds along the rows and lack of control on planting depth, this machine aggravates the growth related problems and degrades the quality of a sensitive crop such as oilseed rape. To solve the above-mentioned problems, an attempt was made to develop a precision seed drill with a roller-type-metering device and a depth control system. Some of the design parameters affecting the uniformity of seed distribution were studied from the view point of roller and brush geometry.

Experiments to determine the cation specificity of the nucleotide requirement show that the Mg 2 + salt was preferred over other divalent and monovalent cations. The role of a putative protonmotive force across the peroxisomal membrane was also examined. Although low concentrations of ionophores had no effect on protein import, relatively high concentrations of all ionophores tested consistently reduced the level of protein import by approximately 50 %.

Semi-field experiments were conducted to assess {{the relative importance of}} olfaction at different points in host location behaviour by M. aeneus. The results showed that <b>oilseed</b> rape <b>plants</b> treated with lavender odour were less colonised by M. aeneus in comparison with an untreated control, but that the treatment effect was much reduced if the lavender odour was applied after colonisation. The field experiment demonstrated that lavender odour caused a significant {{reduction in the number of}} adultM. aeneus infesting the <b>oilseed</b> rape <b>plants</b> in the treatment plots compared to the control plots. Overall, these findings are very encouraging for the future development of a push-pull pest control system...|$|R
40|$|The aim of {{this thesis}} was to find the current {{occurrence}} of resistant sub-population of pollen beetle (Meligethes aeneus Fabricius, 1775) to the selected species active ingredients and the preparation. Adults of pollen beetles were collected from commonly used fields of <b>oilseed</b> rape <b>plants</b> {{at the time of}} the first process of flowering until the end of the entire flowering process. The sample collection was carried out during years 2012 and 2013 in twenty locations in the Czech Republic. The Levels of resistance were assessed in a laboratory test called Adult-vial- Test according to official methods used by the International Resistance Action Committee (IRAC). The first part of this thesis describes the biology of pollen beetles. It also describes other pests found on the <b>oilseed</b> rape <b>plant.</b> It further explains the basic concepts and summarizes the occurrence of resistant sub-populations of Pollen beetle in the Czech Republic and other European countries. The second part of this thesis constitutes the practical aspect of the research where there is testing of the resistance of sub-populations of pollen beetles on used active ingredients and the preparation of Biscaya 240 OD...|$|R
40|$|The {{impact of}} lead shot on soils and crops was {{examined}} at a clay pigeon shooting site in northern England. Topsoil cores were collected along a 300 m transect from the shooting range, {{and the numbers}} of lead shot pellets per soil core, total and ‘plant-available’(0. 5 m acetic acid extractable) lead concentrations, organic matter content, pH and cation exchange capacity were determined. The number of <b>oilseed</b> rape <b>plants</b> and their stem diameters were recorded in 1 m 2 quadrats placed at the soil sampling locations. Total and ‘plant-available’ lead concentrations in the soil were most but plant numbers per m 2 and mean stem diameters were least {{in the area of}} greatest lead shot deposition. Total lead concentrations in the soil commonly exceeded 5000 mg/kg; these are considerably greater than threshold ‘trigger’ concentrations proposed by the Department of the Environment, above which soils are considered to be contaminated and warrant further investigation. Concentrations of lead in the <b>oilseed</b> rape <b>plants</b> themselves were also largest in the area of most intense lead shot deposition; in root samples the lead concentration exceeded 400 mg/kg. The management and remediation of contaminated soils at the clay pigeon shooting site are discussed...|$|R
40|$|The {{high energy}} and {{petroleum}} based fuels demand {{of the world}} require use of alternative fuels from materials available within each country. Therefore biofuels may be an alternative to mineral diesel. A local pilot production of sunflower oil was implemented {{in order to test}} the possibility to reduce fossil fuels consumption on a local scale. Vegetable oils can be directly obtained from <b>oilseed</b> <b>plants</b> and can be used as energy sources in internal combustion engines. Environmental Impact Indicators were provided by Material Flow Accounting, Embodied Energy Analysis and Emergy Accounting. All three approaches reveal that the agricultural phase is the critical step in the whole production line {{from the point of view}} of environmental impact. The renewability calculated for the sunflower oil is 33. 6 %. A comparative Life Cycle Assessment analysis for the sunflower oil production line from conventional farming with organic farming showed environmental advantages. Furthermore use of vegetable oils instead of diesel oil as energy sources in internal combustion engines reduces carbon dioxide emissions of 59 %. This study represents an opportunity for farms to reduce dependence on petroleum and to explore energy production systems exploiting renewable energy...|$|R
