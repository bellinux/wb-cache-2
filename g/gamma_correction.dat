Illumination is normalized on a per-pose basis. Region-based <b>gamma</b> intensity <b>correction</b> is used to correct for coarse illumination changes, while further refinement is achieved by combining a learnt linear manifold of illumination variation with constraints on face pattern distribution, derived from video.

30|$|Since {{the faces}} are non-rigid {{and have a}} high degree of {{variability}} in location, color and pose, it is difficult to detect face automatically in a complex environment. Occlusion and illumination artifacts can also change the overall appearance of a face. We, therefore, propose detecting facial regions in the input video sequence using a face detector with local illumination compensation for normalization and optimal adaptive correlation [18]. Specifically, each frame of the input video sequence is extracted and regularized using an illumination compensation process, including <b>gamma</b> intensity <b>correction</b> (GIC), difference of Gaussian (DoG), local histogram matching (LHM) and local normal distribution (LND). Face candidate regions are then located by the OAC technique with kernel canonical correlation analysis (KCCA).

With the local normalization based method, the proposed method tends be more robust under different illumination conditions.|$|R

40|$|Automatic face {{recognition}} remains an interesting but challenging computer vision open problem. Poor illumination is {{considered as one}} of the major issue, since illumination changes cause large variation in the facial features. To resolve this, illumination normalization preprocessing techniques are employed in this paper to enhance the {{face recognition}} rate. The methods such as Histogram Equalization (HE), <b>Gamma</b> Intensity <b>Correction</b> (GIC), Normalization chain and Modified Homomorphic Filtering (MHF) are used for preprocessing. Owing to great success, the texture features are commonly used for face recognition. But these features are severely affected by lighting changes. Hence texture based models Local Binary Pattern (LBP), Local Derivative Pattern (LDP), Local Texture Pattern (LTP) and Local Tetra Patterns (LTrPs) are experimented under different lighting conditions. In this paper, illumination invariant face recognition technique is developed based on the fusion of illumination preprocessing with local texture descriptors.

40|$|Illumination {{variation}} {{is one of}} the bottlenecks of face recognition systems. In the past few years, many approaches to coping with illumination variations have been proposed which can be categorized into model-based and preprocessing-based. Although the model-based approaches seem more perfect in theory, they commonly introduce more constraints, which make them not practical enough for the real applications. On the other hand, the preprocessing approaches commonly exploit simple and efficient image processing techniques. The typical approaches based on image processing include histogram equalization (HE), histogram specification (HS), logarithm transform (Log), <b>Gamma</b> intensity <b>correction</b> (GIC), and selfquotient image (SQI). In this paper, we perform extensive experiments to analyze and compare these methods empirically by evaluating them on three large-scale face databases: CMU-PIE database, FERET database and CAS-PEAL database. Our experimental results show that HE, HS and GIC can improve recognition performance for both images with and without illumination variations, while Log and SQI may decrease the recognition rate for face images without much illumination variations though they may facilitate the recognition of face images with illumination variations. 1...|$|R

Thanks to this enormous research effort, the recognition rates achievable with the state-of-the-art face recognition technology are steadily growing, even though some issues still pose major challenges to the technology. Amongst these challenges, coping with illumination induced appearance variations is one of the biggest and still not satisfactorily solved.
