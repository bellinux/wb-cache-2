50|$|The Scotch yoke is {{not used}} in most {{internal}} combustion engines because of the rapid wear of the slot in the yoke caused by sliding friction and high contact pressures. This is mitigated by a sliding block between the crank and the slot in the piston rod. Also, increased heat loss during combustion due to extended dwell at top dead centre offsets any constant volume combustion improvements in real engines. In an engine application, less {{percent of the time}} is spent at bottom dead centre when compared to a conventional piston and crankshaft mechanism, which reduces blowdown time for two-stroke engines.

40|$|The {{detection}} of weak, ground-moving targets {{can be improved}} through effective utilization of additional target signal energy collected over an <b>extended</b> <b>dwell</b> <b>time.</b> The signal model used in conventional radar processing limits integration of signal energy over an extended dwell. Two solutions that consider {{the complexity of the}} extended-dwell signal model and effectively combine signal energy collected over a long dwell are presented. The first solution is a single-channel algorithm that provides an estimate of the optimal detector to maximize output signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio for the <b>extended</b> <b>dwell</b> <b>time</b> signal. Rather than searching for the optimal detector in an intractably large filter bank that contains all combinations of phase components, the single-channel algorithm projects dictionary entries against the data to estimate the signal’s linear and nonlinear phase components sequentially with small, phase-specific dictionaries in a multistage process. When used as the detector, the signal model formed from the estimated phase components yields near optimal performance {{for a wide range of}} target parameters for dwell times up to four seconds. In comparison, conventional radar processing methods are limited to an integration time of approximately 100 milliseconds. The second solution is a multichannel, multistage algorithm based on element-space pre-Doppler space-time-adaptive processing with two modifications that make it suitable for {{detection of}} weak targets whose energy is collected over an <b>extended</b> <b>dwell</b> <b>time.</b> The multichannel solution detects targets with lower radial velocities at significantly lower signal-to-noise ratios (SNRs) than conventional radar processing methods. The decrease in required input SNR for the multichannel solution as compared to conventional methods nearly doubles the detection range for a typical target of interest. Future related research includes extension of these concepts to other radar applications and investigation of algorithm performance for the multiple-target scenario. Ph. D...|$|E

Intraosseous infusion is a well tolerated and reliable but rarely used alternative technique in this setting. RECENT FINDINGS According to recent surveys, severe complications of intraosseous infusion stay a rare event. Minor complications and problems in getting an intraosseous infusion started {{on the other side}} seem to be more common than generally announced. The EZ-IO intraosseous infusion system has received expanded EU CE mark approval for an <b>extended</b> <b>dwell</b> <b>time</b> of up to 72  h and for insertion in pediatric patients in the distal femur. Key values of blood samples for laboratory analysis can be obtained with only 2  ml of blood/marrow waste and do also offer reliable values using an I-Stat point-of-care analyzer. SUMMARY Most problems in using an intraosseous infusion are provider-dependent. In pediatric anesthesia, the perioperative setting should further contribute to reduce these problems. Nevertheless, regular training, thorough anatomical knowledge and prompt availability especially in the pediatric age group are paramount to get a seldom used technique work properly under pressure. More longitudinal data on large cohorts were preferable to further support the safety of the intraosseous infusion technique in pediatric patients...|$|E

30|$|Trains are {{independent}} of congested road traffic conditions and therefore {{have the potential to}} be faster at delivering passengers into city centres. Automation and advances in signalling reduce the impediments to a smooth and timely rail system. The growth in city populations has fuelled increased rail patronage with the consequence that many train networks can struggle to be punctual. The most significant variable in the journey of a train is the time it will take paused at each station. This ‘dwell’ time is at the mercy of how long it takes passengers to board, alight and disperse within the train carriage or across the platform. At peak periods, <b>dwell</b> <b>times</b> can become <b>extended</b> as passengers jostle to board or alight. It is general practice that timetables have built-in ‘recovery’ time and attempt to predict extensions of <b>dwell</b> <b>time</b> during peak periods. However, with increased patronage, the predictability of <b>dwell</b> <b>times</b> becomes more difficult [4]. Delayed trains create a number of implications beyond poor punctuality, including the extension of headways (the time gap between services). This extension is especially onerous if the lines are shared with express services and freight trains. <b>Extended</b> <b>dwell</b> <b>times</b> reduce network capacity leading to less services and more late services, ultimately impacting upon an operator’s revenue and contributing to poor passenger perceptions of the mode.|$|R
40|$|The {{reliability}} and mechanical performance of electronic integrated circuit (IC) package is studied {{based on the}} finite element analysis. The flip chip on board (FCOB) package - {{one of the most}} current plastic encapsulated IC packages - consists of a die, solders, a printed circuit board and underfill resin encapsulated between the die and PCB, which is subjected to a typical thermal cycle experienced during the manufacturing process. The effects of viscoelastic properties of underfill resin on mechanical responses and residual stresses of FCOB packages are specifically studied and the results are compared with those obtained for a thermoelastic underfill resin. The viscoelastic properties of underfill resin are characterized using the time-temperature superposition (TTS) technique. Both the rigid and flexible PCB substrates are considered. It is found that the elastic model underestimates significantly both the thermal stress and the strain level in the solder joints, whereas it overestimates the stress concentrations in the underfill fillet around the die corner than the viscoelastic model. When the package is subjected to an <b>extended</b> <b>dwell</b> <b>time</b> at an elevated temperature, a moderate loss of mechanical coupling between the die and organic substrate is expected due to the relaxation of underfill resin. The implication is that the viscoelastic nature of underfill material should be properly taken into account if the failure of solder joints and the lifetime of the package are to be accurately estimated.

The proposed research will develop “ 3 -D ” carbon nanotube (CNT) based textured photovoltaic (PV) cells. The PV cells developed herein will be small in “footprint ” due to the nanostructured topography and will be very light weight making them extremely beneficial for aerospace and mobile applications where mass and volume can be major cost and acceptance drivers. Concept: In the proposed concept, a 3 -D aligned array of highly conductive CNT towers are grown on lithographically patterned Si wafers. The interconnected CNT array is then coated with suitable photon absorbing bandgap materials to form a p/n-junction. A conductive oxide such as indium tin oxide (ITO) is deposited as the transparent top contact of the PV cell. Benefits: 1. Multiple bounce light trapping – In a traditional (planar) single junction solar cell, a photon of light impinges the p/n-junction at a single instance and may create a single electron-hole pair. Then, despite numerous efforts to the contrary, any unabsorbed photons reflect into the atmosphere or space (Figure 1). For the proposed CNT-based device, multiple impingements (Figure 2) and scattering of the incident photon upon the p/n-junction increase the probability of absorption due to <b>extended</b> <b>dwell</b> <b>time</b> in the photoactive layers.

40|$|This paper {{considers}} the viscoelastic properties of underfill in the numerical stress analysis of FCOB packages. The 'master curve' is obtained {{for a typical}} underfill resin based on the time-temperature superposition (TTS) technique. The finite element method (FEM) was employed for a FCOB package consisting of die, solders, underfill and FR- 4 printed circuit board, which was subjected to a thermal cycle, {{and the evolution of}} residual stresses were examined. The results indicate that in the elastic model the stresses at the solder joints are significantly underestimated. The maximum creep strain accumulated in the solder is two to three times higher in the viscoelastic model than in the elastic model. Significant relaxation takes place in the underfill resin, especially at elevated temperatures and during <b>extended</b> <b>dwell</b> <b>time,</b> which deteriorates significantly the original functions of underfill. The implication is that the viscoelastic nature of underfill material must be properly taken into account if the failure of solder joints and thus the lifetime of the package are to be accurately estimated. The normal and shear stress components at the solder joint near the copper stud were also much higher in the viscoelastic model. This is {{despite the fact that the}} von Mises stresses along the solder-copper stud interface were basically similar between the two models, except at the copper stud corners. However, the stresses generated in the underfill adjacent to the die corner were more than five times higher in the elastic model than in the viscoelastic model. This observation arises from the constantly high elastic modulus of the underfill material assumed in the elastic model...|$|E

Working indoors, the GPS receiver {{is likely to}} experience a situation {{where some of the}} received signals are stronger than others. These strong signals can prevent the acquisition of a desired weak signal or lead to false acquisition, due to high cross correlation between the strong and weak signals. The C/A Gold code used in GPS L 1 signal has an inherent correlation protection of about 24 dB. This becomes inadequate for weak signal acquisition in the presence of multiple strong signals. Various cross correlation mitigation techniques are used to deal with this problem. The impact of cross correlation on weak signal acquisition largely depends on the relative power level and carrier offset of the desired weak signal with reference to the strong interfering signals. This paper first presents an analysis of the L 1 -C/A cross correlation in the presence of multiple strong signals under different conditions of relative Doppler offset and <b>dwell</b> <b>time.</b> Acquisition of weak signals with different SNR levels is then performed under these conditions, using the ¿Tong¿ search algorithm and the results of acquisition are presented.

Rhythmic {{behaviors}} in neural systems often combine features of limit-cycle dynamics (stability and periodicity) with features of near heteroclinic or near homoclinic cycle dynamics (<b>extended</b> <b>dwell</b> <b>times</b> in localized regions of phase space).

For system (ii), we obtain exact expressions for the limit cycle and the iPRC as a function of a parameter, mu> 0, representing the distance from a heteroclinic bifurcation point.

Increases in sample rate from 10 samples per second to 50 samples per second were examined, as were changes in <b>dwell</b> <b>time</b> from one second per data point to two seconds. These changes were examined for a representative aircraft model in a range of tunnel operating conditions defined by angles of attack from 0 deg to 3. 8 degrees, total pressure from 15. 0 psi to 24. 1 psi, and Mach numbers from 0. 52 to 0. 82. No statistically significant effect was associated with the change in sample rate. The change in <b>dwell</b> <b>time</b> from one second to two seconds affected axial force measurements, and to a lesser degree normal force measurements. This dwell effect comprises a "rectification error" caused by incomplete cancellation of the positive and negative elements of certain low frequency dynamic components that are not rejected by the one-Hz low-pass filters of the data system. These low frequency effects may be due to tunnel circuit phenomena and other sources.

40|$|CD 8 + T cells {{recognize}} peptides {{of eight}} to nine amino acid residues {{long in the}} context of MHC class I molecules on the surface of antigen-presenting cells (APCs). This recognition event is highly sensitive, as evidenced by the fact that T cells can be activated by cognate peptide/MHC complex (pMHC) at extremely low densities (1 - 50 molecules). High sensitivity is particularly valuable for detection of antigens at low density, such as those derived from tumor cells and intracellular pathogens, which can down-modulate cognate pMHCs from the surface of APCs to evade recognition by the adaptive immune system. T cell activation is only triggered in response to interactions between the T cell receptor (TCR) and the pMHC ligand that reach a specific half-life threshold. However, interactions with excessively long half-lives result in impaired T cell activation. Thus, efficient T cell activation by pMHC on the surface of APCs requires an optimal <b>dwell</b> <b>time</b> of TCR-pMHC interaction. Here, we show that, although this is a requirement at low cognate pMHC density on the APC surface, at high epitope density there is no impairment of T cell activation by <b>extended</b> TCR-pMHC <b>dwell</b> <b>times.</b> This observation was predicted by mathematical simulations for T cell activation by pMHC at different densities and supported by experiments performed on APCs selected for varied expression of cognate pMHC. According to these results, effective T cell activation depends on a complex interplay between inherent TCR-pMHC binding kinetics and the epitope density on the APC...|$|R

30|$|A first remark {{concerns}} {{the relationship between}} the travel demand (in terms of arrival rate) in a station and the related <b>dwell</b> <b>time.</b> Indeed, although Eq. (1) shows the direct dependence of <b>dwell</b> <b>times</b> on travel demand (i.e. the higher the travel demand, the higher the <b>dwell</b> <b>time),</b> Eq. (3) (or, equivalently, Eq.  4) shows the direct dependence of travel demand on headway which, by means of Eq. (2), in turn depends on <b>dwell</b> <b>times</b> in previous stations. Hence, the <b>dwell</b> <b>time</b> in a station {{is a function of the}} arrival rate in that station, the arrival rates in the previous stations and the framework of the travel demand (in terms of alighting flows). For this reason, in general, it is not possible to state that higher flows (in terms of arrival rates) necessarily imply higher <b>dwell</b> <b>times.</b>|$|R

50|$|<b>Dwell</b> <b>time</b> is the {{duration}} between when a user clicks on {{a search engine}} result, and when the user returns from that result, or is otherwise seen to have left the result.

Short <b>dwell</b> <b>times</b> indicate the user's query intent was not satisfied by viewing the result. Long <b>dwell</b> <b>times</b> indicate the user's query intent was satisfied.

40|$|The {{present study}} {{examined}} the factors that determine the <b>dwell</b> <b>times</b> in a visual search task, that is, the duration the gaze remains fixated on an object. It {{has been suggested that}} an item’s similarity to the search target should be an important determiner of <b>dwell</b> <b>times,</b> because <b>dwell</b> <b>times</b> are taken to reflect the time needed to reject the item as a distractor, and such discriminations are supposed to be harder the more similar an item is to the search target. In line with this similarity view, a previous study shows that, in search for a target ring of thin line-width, <b>dwell</b> <b>times</b> on thin linewidth Landolt C’s distractors were longer than <b>dwell</b> <b>times</b> on Landolt C’s with thick or medium linewidth. However, <b>dwell</b> <b>times</b> may have been longer on thin Landolt C’s because the thin line-width made it harder to detect whether the stimuli had a gap or not. Thus, it is an open question whether <b>dwell</b> <b>times</b> on thin line-width distractors were longer because they were similar to the target or because the perceptual decision was more difficult. The present study de-coupled similarity from perceptual difficulty, by measuring <b>dwell</b> <b>times</b> on thin, medium and thick line-width distractors when the target had thin, medium or thick line-width. The results showed that <b>dwell</b> <b>times</b> were longer on target-similar than target-dissimilar stimuli across all target conditions and regardless of the line-width. It is concluded that prior findings of longer <b>dwell</b> <b>times</b> on thin linewidthdistractors can clearly be attributed to target similarity. As will be discussed towards the end, the finding of similarity effect...|$|R
