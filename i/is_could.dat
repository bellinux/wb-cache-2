An industry that flourished throughout Clarence Plains was fruit growing, and by the 1880s several prosperous orchards were located within the region. A rare attempt at commercial opportunism was the short-lived Bellerive-Sorell Railway (1892 until 1926) which had its terminus on a long jetty extending into the Bay on reclaimed land that now makes up part of the Bellerive Boardwalk. It was hoped that <b>is</b> <b>could</b> eventually be connected to the Tasmanian Main Line at Brighton, thus providing rail access to the south of Clarence Plains, Sorrell and the Tasman Peninsular, but engineering difficulties and economic problems led to its abandonment.|$|E

Saying your occupation is [...] "assassin" [...] or [...] "professional killer" [...] could, and therefore the 5th Amendment could be invoked as to that question; saying you made $635,000 last year does not provide evidence of anything criminal and thus it could not.|$|E

2500|$|The mountain's name {{translates}} {{from the}} Scottish Gaelic language as [...] "Aged Hill/Cairn" [...] with aosda meaning aged or ancient and most guide books carry this meaning.
