5000|$|Rotor, {{alternative}} to blade irons. First patented by industrial designer Ron Rezek in 1991, the one-piece {{die cast rotor}} receives and secures the blades and bolts right to the motor, eliminating most balance problems and minimizing <b>exposed</b> <b>fasteners.</b>|$|E
40|$|An {{improved}} sealing {{method has}} been developed for the <b>exposed</b> metal <b>fastener</b> surfaces of the Solid Rocket Booster vehicle for the Space Shuttle launch system. The method employs properly sized flexible plastic caps filled with catalyzed polysulfide sealant, frozen and stored. At the time of use, the caps and sealant are thawed and positioned on the fasteners. The sealant covers the exposed portion of the fastener and prevents salt water damage. The method is one of high reliability with low installation and inspection costs...|$|R
40|$|Combustion {{tests on}} SiC/SiC CMC (Ceramic Matrix Composite) {{components}} were performed in an aircraft combustion environment using the Rich-burn, Quick-quench, Lean-burn (RQL) sector rig. SiC/SiC fasteners {{were used to}} attach several of these components to the metallic rig structure. The effect of combustion exposure on the fastener material was characterized via microstructural examination. Fasteners were also destructively tested, after combustion exposure, and the failure loads of <b>fasteners</b> <b>exposed</b> in the sector rig were compared to those of as-manufactured fasteners. Combustion exposure reduced the fastener failure load by 50 % relative to the as-manufactured fasteners for exposure times ranging from 50 to 260 hours. The <b>fasteners</b> <b>exposed</b> in the combustion environment demonstrated failure loads that varied with failure mode. Fasteners that had the highest average failure load, failed {{in the same manner}} as the unexposed fasteners...|$|R
50|$|The primary {{function}} of the cladding system {{is to provide a}} weathertight building envelope, suitable for the intended use of the building.Trapezoidal metal roof sheets with through fix fasteners are generally suitable for slopes of 4% or steeper. This limit is critical to the performance of the cladding. For shallower pitches, down to 1.5%, a fix system with no <b>exposed</b> through <b>fasteners,</b> special side laps and preferably no end laps should be used. For low pitch roof, ponding is a potential problem that must be considered at the design stage {{in order to avoid the}} deleterious effects of prolonged soaking and the increased loading, due to the weight of the water.|$|R
40|$|The main {{objective}} of this work is to investigate the ultimate load, behaviour characteristics and failure modes of threaded steel fasteners subjected to various combinations of tension and shear loads at elevated deformation rates. Threaded steel fasteners are often used to assemble members and components in engineering structures, and the behaviour characteristics of each individual fastener can have a significant influence {{on the performance of}} the total structure. Hence, before the response of a structure can be determined based on a given load scenario the behaviour of each of the involved components and joints must be known as well as the material behaviour at the deformation rates representative for the load situation. The work carried out in this thesis is presented in a synopsis, providing the background, the objectives, the strategy and a summary of the project. Then three individual papers/parts follow where two have been published in peer reviewed journals and the third has been submitted for potential journal publication. The first two papers are dealing with the tensile behaviour of threaded steel fasteners at elevated rates of strain. The objective was to investigate the ultimate tensile load, behaviour characteristics and failure modes. In the first paper, results and observation from the experimental study were presented, and the Alexander model was modified to consider the ultimate load and mode of failure at high loading rates. In the second paper, results from a numerical study were presented. The numerical study was based on the experimental results obtained from the first part. An axisymmetric finite element model was used to predict the tension behaviour characteristics and the failure modes of the threaded steel fasteners. Comparison of results between simulations and experiments showed that the axisymmetric finite element model captured the ultimate load and the overall behaviour characteristics with good accuracy. It was observed that the failure modes were influenced by the thread engagement length, the grip length and the strain-rate. The third paper explores the ultimate load and behaviour characteristics of threaded steel <b>fasteners</b> <b>exposed</b> to combined tension and shear load at elevated deformation rates. An experimental and a numerical study were conducted. In the experimental study, the loading angle was 0 °, 45 ° and 90 °, where 0 ° corresponded to loading along the axis of the threaded steel fasteners. The numerical study was carried out using a three-dimensional finite element model. Simulations were performed at the same deformation rates as in the experiments, while the load was applied at different angles varying between 0 º and 90 º with 15 º intervals. Interaction curves were established based on both the experimental and the numerical results. The numerical model was found to capture the ultimate load and the overall behaviour characteristics with reasonable accuracy. PhD i konstruksjonsteknikkPhD in Structural Engineerin...|$|R
