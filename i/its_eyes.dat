5|$|C. longimanus most {{distinguishing}} {{characteristics are}} its long, wing-like pectoral and dorsal fins. The fins are significantly larger {{than most other}} shark species, and are conspicuously rounded. The shark's nose is rounded and <b>its</b> <b>eyes</b> are circular, with nictitating membranes.|$|E
5|$|Monument 65 is a {{badly damaged}} {{depiction}} of a human head in Olmec style, dating to the Middle Preclassic. <b>Its</b> <b>eyes</b> are closed and the mouth and nose are completely destroyed. It is wearing a helmet. It is located {{to the west of}} Structure12.|$|E
5|$|The bat has a {{distinctive}} swollen, pig-like snout with thin, vertical nostrils. Its ears are relatively large, while <b>its</b> <b>eyes</b> {{are small and}} mostly concealed by fur. Its teeth are typical of an insectivorous bat. The dental formula is 1:1:1:3 in the upper jaw and 2:1:2:3 in the lower jaw, with large upper incisors.|$|E

5|$|The extraocular {{muscles of}} the walrus are well-developed. This and its lack of orbital roof allow it to {{protrude}} <b>its</b> <b>eyes</b> and see in both a frontal and dorsal direction. However, vision in this species {{appears to be more}} suited for short-range.|$|E
5|$|The {{face mask}} may help the species {{identify}} potential mates by distinguishing species, and {{may serve as}} an anti-predator strategy by making <b>its</b> <b>eyes</b> appear larger than they really are.|$|E
5|$|When foraging, the blackmouth {{catshark}} swings its {{head from side}} to side to employ its senses more effectively. It likely relies mainly on vision and electroreception to find food, and less on smell. As in most sharks, its visual acuity is greatest along the median horizontal plane. The lens and cone cells of <b>its</b> <b>eyes</b> are large, allowing smaller or farther objects to be discerned from the background. The rod cells of <b>its</b> <b>eyes</b> are most sensitive to the wavelengths emitted by bioluminescence, which is exhibited by most of the organisms it hunts. For electroreception, the {{blackmouth catshark}} has a high number of ampullae of Lorenzini that are evenly arranged, which enhances spatial resolution and is best suited for localizing fast-moving prey.|$|E

5|$|During daytime, the {{angelshark}} usually lies motionless {{on the sea}} floor, {{buried under}} a layer of sediment with only <b>its</b> <b>eyes</b> showing. At night, it becomes more active, and may sometimes be seen swimming above the bottom. Aggregations numbering up to a hundred have been observed off Gran Canaria in the summer. Known parasites of this species include the tapeworms Grillotia smaris-gora, G. angeli, and Christianella minuta, the fluke Pseudocotyle squatinae, the monogenean Leptocotyle minor, and the isopod Aega rosacea.|$|E
5|$|Italian naturalist Camillo Ranzani {{published}} the first scientific {{description of the}} smalltail shark, in an 1839 volume of Novi Commentarii Academiae Scientiarum Instituti Bononiensis. He named the new shark Carcharias porosus from the Greek porus ("pore"), referring to the prominent pores behind <b>its</b> <b>eyes.</b> The type specimen, a -long male from Brazil, has since been lost. This species {{was moved to the}} genus Carcharhinus by later authors. Its Trinidadian name is puppy shark.|$|E
5|$|The black dragonfish (also {{called the}} {{northern}} stoplight loosejaw) Malacosteus niger {{is believed to}} be one of the only fish to produce a red glow. <b>Its</b> <b>eyes,</b> however, are insensitive to this wavelength; it has an additional retinal pigment which fluoresces blue-green when illuminated. This alerts the fish to the presence of its prey. The additional pigment is thought to be assimilated from chlorophyll derivatives found in the copepods which form part of its diet.|$|E
50|$|M. nigrescens {{exhibits}} positive phototaxis; when it senses {{light with}} <b>its</b> <b>eye,</b> it moves toward it. Other eyed nematodes {{have a negative}} phototaxis, moving away from light. The juvenile M. nigrescens also has a weak negative phototaxis before <b>its</b> <b>eye</b> has developed. This behavior may guide the juvenile underground, and lead the adult female to the surface, where it lays its eggs on vegetation.|$|R

5|$|The irises of <b>its</b> <b>eyes</b> are red, {{its feet}} are black, and its beak is flesh-colored. The eye {{has a single}} {{incomplete}} row of eyelashes on the upper lid and two rows on the lower lid. Its beak is thick, rounded, and hooked at the tip. Because of its habit of urohidrosis, the scaly portions of its legs are often streaked white with uric acid.|$|E
5|$|The {{king vulture}} has, {{relative}} to its size, the largest skull and braincase, and strongest bill of the New World vultures. This bill has a hooked tip {{and a sharp}} cutting edge. The bird has broad wings and a short, broad, and square tail. The irises of <b>its</b> <b>eyes</b> are white and bordered by bright red sclera. Unlike some New World vultures, the king vulture lacks eyelashes. It also has gray legs and long, thick claws.|$|E
5|$|As {{the club}} was {{dissatisfied}} with this arrangement, it launched plans to establish its own venues. First it needed to secure a lot, and in the late 1920s lied <b>its</b> <b>eyes</b> on a parcel of land owned by Hamar Jernstøperi. However, the lot was sold to Oplandske Kreditbank in 1930 and the club had to negotiate purchasing the lot from the bank. The club established a new committee {{to look into the}} stadium issue. Hamar IL was invited to become part-owner of the venue, but they chose to remain at Hamar stadion. As Briskebyen was not able to secure a partner to share the costs with, opposition towards the project grew within the club. Yet, the decision to build the venue was taken by Briskebyen FL's annual meeting on 15 April 1934, with construction starting on 26 April.|$|E

5|$|Common {{threshers}} are active, strong swimmers; {{there are}} infrequent reports of them leaping {{completely out of}} the water. Like the fast-swimming sharks of the family Lamnidae, the common thresher has a strip of aerobic red muscle along its flank that is able to contract powerfully and efficiently for long periods of time. In addition, they have slow-oxidative muscles centrally located within their bodies and a blood vessel countercurrent exchange system called the rete mirabile ("wonderful net"), allowing them to generate and retain body heat. The temperature inside the red muscles of a common thresher averages 2°C (3.6°F) above that of the ambient seawater, though there is significant individual variation. Unlike the pelagic and bigeye threshers, the common thresher lacks an orbital rete mirabile to protect <b>its</b> <b>eyes</b> and brain from temperature changes.|$|E
5|$|For {{many years}} only one fossil Nectocaris was known, poorly {{preserved}} {{and without a}} counterpart. This fossil was a puzzle, as its head looked rather like that of an arthropod but its body, with {{what seemed to be}} fins along its back and belly, looked rather like of a chordate's. In 2010 Smith and Caron described another 91 specimens, some very good, and reconstructed it as a cephalopod, and the earliest one as of 2010. Unlike later cephalopods it had only two arms, and <b>its</b> <b>eyes</b> seem mounted on stalks. But it had a soft funnel, similar to the ones used for propulsion by modern cephalopods.|$|E
5|$|Nocturnal and solitary, the marbled {{electric}} ray can often be found lying the sea floor buried except for <b>its</b> <b>eyes</b> and spiracles. This slow-moving predator feeds almost exclusively on small bony fishes, which it ambushes from the bottom and subdues with strong electric bursts. It defends itself by turning towards the threat, swimming in a loop, or curling up with its underside facing outward, while emitting electric shocks to drive off the prospective predator. Its paired electric organs are capable of producing 70–80 volts of electricity. This species is aplacental viviparous, with the developing embryos sustained by yolk and histotroph ("uterine milk") produced by the mother. Mating takes place from November to January, and females bear litters of 3–32 pups every other year after a gestation period of 9–12 months. The newborn ray is immediately capable of using electricity to hunt.|$|E

5|$|The European {{nightjar}} {{feeds on}} a wide variety of flying insects, which it seizes in flight, often fly-catching from a perch. It hunts by sight, silhouetting its prey against the night sky. <b>Its</b> <b>eyes</b> are relatively large, each with a reflective layer, which improves night vision. It appears not to rely on its hearing to find insects and does not echolocate. Drinking and bathing take place during flight. Although it suffers a degree of predation and parasitism, the main threats to the species are habitat loss, disturbance and a reduction of its insect prey through pesticide use. Despite population decreases, its large numbers and huge breeding range mean that it is classified by the International Union for Conservation of Nature as being of Least Concern.|$|E
5|$|The distant {{vision of}} a frog is better than its near vision. Calling frogs will quickly become silent when they see an {{intruder}} or even a moving shadow but the closer an object is, the less well it is seen. When a frog shoots out its tongue to catch an insect it is reacting to a small moving object that it cannot see well and must line it up precisely beforehand because it shuts <b>its</b> <b>eyes</b> as the tongue is extended. Whether a frog sees in colour is debatable {{but it has been}} shown that it responds positively to blue light, perhaps because that colour is associated with bodies of water that can provide refuge when the frog feels threatened.|$|E
5|$|The female {{is similar}} in some ways to the male, but paler and duller. It is sandy grey or brown, with a back {{patterned}} like that of the male, and white or whitish underparts. The head of the females of the subspecies ammodendri and nigricans is dingy grey with darker smudges on the forehead, behind <b>its</b> <b>eyes,</b> and on its throat. The female of the subspecies stoliczkae is buff-brown with a white throat, a conspicuous pale supercilium, darker forehead, and lighter cheeks. The juvenile is similar to the female, differing in its lack of dark tinges on its throat and crown. In adults, moulting begins in July and ends in late August or early September. The post-juvenile moult is complete, and occurs variously from June to August.|$|E
