It is that which the Romans call caena dubia; where there is such plenty, yet withal so much diversity, and so good order, that the choice is difficult betwixt one excellency and another; and yet the conclusion, by a due climax, is evermore the best--that is, as a conclusion ought to be, ever the most proper for its place. See, my lord, whether I have not studied your lordship with some application: and since you are so modest that you will not be judge and party, I appeal to the whole world if I have not drawn your picture to a great degree of likeness, though it is but in miniature, and that some of the best features are yet wanting.

Instead she goes back, and reappears dragging a feather bed after her, which, with great difficulty, she pushes through the window. The bed caught and stretched, the girl is again at the window, a child of three in her arms, which with great care and skill she throws safely upon the mattress. Twice again with still older children she repeats the heroic feat. When her turn comes to jump, suffocated or too exhausted by her efforts, she cannot save herself. She jumps, but too feebly, falls upon the pavement, and is carried insensibly to St. Thomas's Hospital, where she dies. George Frederic Watts ...|$|R

40|$|Connect in-text {{citations}} to bibliographies In-text citations {{signal the}} use of a particular source and so must offer readers identifying information about that source—usually including author or title and a reference to a particular passage or page that also makes a clear link to the bibliography. For an overview of related key topics on working with documentation styles, visit the videos and quizzes in this tutorial. Explore It By documenting your sources carefully—in <b>your</b> text and <b>in</b> <b>your</b> bibliography—you give <b>readers</b> of <b>your</b> research project a map to the sources you use. While reading <b>your</b> paper, <b>readers</b> should be able to identify specific types of information about the sources you use. When your in-text references are accurate and formatted correctly, they will point readers to the complete citation on your bibliography page. All documentation styles call on you to include citations of sources <b>in</b> <b>your</b> text that are connected to entries in the bibliography that accompanies your research project. Though the requirements and styles differ, MLA, APA, and Chicago styles all require basic citations <b>in</b> <b>your</b> text that identify the author and indicate which of your sources is being cited. And when you cite a particular passage <b>in</b> <b>your</b> draft all these documentation styles require you to note, often by giving a page number, where the material appears in the source. The citations in the text of your research paper point readers to a particular entry <b>in</b> <b>your</b> bibliography. Here are several example sentences showing in-text citations of paraphrased material from a source. Each example is accompanied by an entry for citing the source in the works cited (MLA), references (APA), or in a note and on the bibliography page (Chicago). mla Teenagers may experience loneliness, depression, and a decline in “real world ” social activity as a result of overexposure to chat rooms and excessive Web surfing (Johnson) ...|$|R
