5|$|Because of the hilly terrain, {{the station}} was built in a <b>deep</b> <b>cutting</b> {{excavated}} from Highgate Hill adjacent to Archway Road. Tunnels penetrated the hillside {{at each end of}} the station, leading towards East Finchley to the north and Crouch End to the south. When built, the station had two side platforms, with three tracks between them, and a station building on the south side. A footbridge linked the two platforms.|$|E
5|$|By {{the time}} the train reached Eccles, the day's drizzle had been {{replaced}} by a storm. The doctors carried Huskisson, still on his door, off the train into a torrent of hail and thunder and walked the few hundred yards to the vicarage, frequently losing their footing as they climbed the <b>deep</b> <b>cutting.</b> Meanwhile, Stephenson and Wilton restarted the train and went on to Manchester to fetch medical assistance.|$|E
5|$|The wooden Pontnewydd aqueduct, {{which was}} prone to the river flowing over its top, was {{replaced}} by an iron one built on a slightly higher level to provide more room for the river to flow under it. Pinkerton's two locks were rebuilt, and {{the banks of the}} Kymer canal were raised by , to allow the water level to be raised. This had also required the Kidwelly basin walls to be raised. At the southern end, access to Burry Port harbour required a <b>deep</b> <b>cutting</b> to be constructed, and this was completed by March 1835.|$|E
5000|$|... #Caption: Talerddig cutting, how the N&MR {{crossed the}} Cambrian Mountains. 120 ft deep and cut through solid rock, {{it was the}} <b>deepest</b> <b>cutting</b> {{in the world at}} the time of its {{completion}} in 1862.|$|R
50|$|Between Wahroonga and Ourimbah {{the freeway}} passes through rugged {{sandstone}} country, particularly as it descends to and ascends from the Hawkesbury River. This {{section of the}} freeway is characterised by <b>deep</b> <b>cuttings</b> and extensive embankments.|$|R

5|$|In December 1974, the Council bought Bridgwater Dock from British Railways. The {{concrete}} wall across the barge lock was removed, {{but there was}} no intention to restore the ship lock. By 1980, the Council had invested over £50,000 in the restoration, which included Kings and Standards locks, and the bottom gates of Newtown Lock. Some bridges had been raised, but only to , which allowed canoeing, but prevented bigger boats from using the waterway. Work on the <b>deep</b> <b>cutting</b> between West Street and Albert Street started in September 1978, jointly funded by the County Council and Sedgemoor District Council, using direct labour, while a Manpower Services Commission scheme to dredge the canal from the dock to the cutting and to widen the towpath was funded by the District Council in 1981.|$|E
25|$|Mixing of {{new snow}} with older lower snow, using <b>deep</b> <b>cutting</b> {{implements}} allows the snow pack {{to set up}} better.|$|E
25|$|Thongsbridge {{station was}} {{situated}} in a <b>deep</b> <b>cutting</b> spanned by two bridges, one at each end. In the original layout, the platforms were staggered either side of Heys Road bridge with the main buildings on the Huddersfield bound platform. This layout was criticised by the Board of Trade {{after a number of}} accidents involving passengers.|$|E
50|$|A {{significant}} {{civil engineering}} achievement {{on the line}} is the Talerddig cutting through solid rock. With a depth of 120 ft, it was the <b>deepest</b> <b>cutting</b> {{in the world at}} the time of its completion in 1862. For safety reasons, the original near-vertical sides have since been trimmed back.|$|R
50|$|Portrait {{sculpture}} {{during the}} period utilized youthful and classical proportions, evolving later into a mixture of realism and idealism. During the Antonine and Severan periods, more ornate hair and bearding became prevalent, created with <b>deeper</b> <b>cutting</b> and drilling. Advancements were also made in relief sculptures, usually depicting Roman victories.|$|R
50|$|When the SER's line became authorised, the Croydon company reconsidered the matter, as {{its line}} {{would now be}} part of a trunk route, and it was decided to ease the {{gradient}} from New Cross to 1 in 100; this involved a <b>deeper,</b> and longer, <b>cutting,</b> and the line would only reach surface level at the present-day Forest Hill station. The <b>deeper</b> <b>cuttings</b> required more surface area of land; and some curvature improvements further south also required unanticipated land acquisition.|$|R
25|$|The {{western and}} {{northern}} flanks of the fell drain to the River Caldew, which heads north east to Carlisle {{for a meeting}} with the River Eden, and thence to the Solway Firth. Northward across the <b>deep</b> <b>cutting</b> of the Caldew is Carrock Fell, while to the west are Great Calva and Knott. Wainwright remarked that the western slopes of Bowscale Fell are drained by the Caldew which ultimately flows to the east, while the eastern slopes feed the Glenderamackin which soon turns west for Keswick and the River Derwent.|$|E
25|$|The {{committee}} {{called upon}} {{the services of}} the surveyor William Jessop, who had experience with the successful Cromford Canal. A possible route had already been suggested by Lord Middleton, owner of Wollaton Hall and coal mines at Wollaton, but Jessop discounted this, {{on the basis that}} it would involve lengths of <b>deep</b> <b>cutting</b> and some tunnelling. Jessop then became ill, and suggested that the survey could be carried out by James Green, who worked for Lord Middleton at Wollaton. The committee decide to wait for Jessop to recover, but after six months, they relented and asked Green to survey the route in June 1791, as well as a branch from Lenton across Beeston Meadows to join the Trent at Beeston. This would allow traffic on the river to bypass Trent Bridge, where passage was difficult, and to pass the wharves in Nottingham. When the Erewash Canal company learnt of the proposal, they approached Nottingham Corporation about them building a route from Beeston through Nottingham to the Trent, but at this stage the Corporation declined.|$|E
25|$|Hutchings & Co {{were awarded}} the {{contract}} {{and the first}} sod was cut at Bareflathills just outside Elgin near the River Lossie by the wife of James Grant on Saturday, 30 November 1851— a large cheering crowd amid the firing of cannons witnessed the ceremony. This point was chosen because it possessed the three most difficult engineering features to be overcome—the bridge over the River Lossie, the road bridge over the track and the very <b>deep</b> <b>cutting.</b> The contractor switched to two 12-hour shifts and had a work force of around 300 navvies. It was reported at the Board meeting held on 2 April 1852, that although the track was half-finished a strike within the workforce had provoked a serious disturbance. There were two stories in circulation regarding the incident. The first of these was that Irish navvies had come onto the job undercutting the locals’ wages {{and the other was}} that the contractor, who was from England, employed English labour and it was they who objected to the Irish. The outcome was that a riot of some sort had taken place and that four of the instigators were arrested and sentenced to various periods of hard labour—a fifth person was to be sent to the Court of Judiciary for trial after assaulting the Sheriff. The result of all this was that the Morayshire Railway was ordered to pay for ten additional police constables to regulate the workforce.|$|E
5000|$|... #Caption: Talerddig {{cutting through}} the Cambrian Mountains, Wales in 2001. Created {{as part of the}} Newtown and Machynlleth Railway, with a depth of 120 ft, it was the <b>deepest</b> <b>cutting</b> in the world {{at the time of its}} opening in the early 1860s. The {{original}} near-vertical sides have since been trimmed back ...|$|R
5000|$|... #Caption: The Zulu {{deployment}} at Isandhlwana {{shows the}} well-organized tactical {{system of the}} impi. The left horn worked with the chest to pin the British down, drawing {{the bulk of their}} fire. The right horn meanwhile circled around the mountain to attack the English rear. The reserves struck <b>deeper,</b> <b>cutting</b> off and pursuing fugitives, and eventually attacking Rorke's Drift.|$|R
50|$|Cuttings and {{embankments}} {{were built}} {{to keep the}} gradient of the line to a minimum. The <b>deepest</b> <b>cutting</b> was 43 ft, the highest embankment 54 ft. Both embankments and cuttings had stone retaining walls at the base, at an angle of 67.5° to the horizontal, which reduced the overall width of the earthworks. The line was built as a double-track railway.|$|R
500|$|At the Bridgwater end, {{navigation}} {{onto the}} River Parrett was not easy, and the Corporation of Bridgwater had commissioned {{a number of}} surveys to construct a floating harbour. All came to nothing, but in 1836 the Bristol and Exeter Railway Company obtained an Act to construct a railway which would pass through Bridgwater. Subsequently the Canal Company, {{in order to protect}} their trade, sought their own Act to construct a floating harbour to the west of Bridgwater, and to extend the canal to join it. This was obtained on 21 April 1837, and the works were started. The construction work involved a <b>deep</b> <b>cutting</b> from Albert Street to West Street, a short tunnel at West Street. There it entered Bridgwater Docks, which consisted of: ...|$|E
500|$|Next came Burnham Lane siding, {{and then}} a high embankment, pierced by two brick bridges, which were wide enough for double track, {{although}} they only ever carried a single track, followed by another <b>deep</b> <b>cutting.</b> Haxey station had a passing loop and three sidings. It was originally called Haxey Central, and then Haxey Town AJR, and eventually became Haxey Town. The line continued on an embankment, crossed Ferry Drain and Warping Drain by a brick bridge, {{and turned to the}} south-east to reach the terminus at Haxey Junction Station. The adjacent station on the Great Northern and Great Eastern Joint Railway line between Doncaster and Gainsborough, to which it was connected by a line which required two reversals, was called [...]|$|E
500|$|The eastern section {{from the}} Leicestershire border was opened on 1 February 1797, {{with the rest}} of the canal later that year. The canal was built with locks , the same size as those on the Nottingham Canal to allow boats to use both. The branch to Bingham {{authorised}} by the first act was not built. The 18 locks raised the level of the canal by [...] from the Trent to Grantham. Eleven of them were located in the first [...] above the Trent, after which there was a level pound of around [...] before a flight of seven locks at Woolsthorpe, and a much shorter upper pound to Grantham. At Harlaxton, the canal passed through a <b>deep</b> <b>cutting</b> (effectively crossing the watershed between the River Witham and the River Trent), which was only wide enough for a single boat, but this situation was partially rectified in 1801 when the cutting was widened in two places to allow boats travelling on opposite directions to cross. At Cropwell Bishop and Cropwell Butler, the route passed through gypsum beds, which resulted in problems with leakage.|$|E
50|$|The Belgrave line heads {{south-east}} from Ringwood, {{cutting across}} the Dandenong Creek valley and skirting {{the foothills of}} the Dandenong Ranges to Upper Ferntree Gully. This section has <b>deep</b> <b>cuttings</b> at Heathmont, Bayswater and Boronia where the line has been lowered to pass under adjacent intersections. The line now has few level crossings, on minor roads between Ferntree Gully and Upper Gully.|$|R
50|$|From Awre {{the line}} climbed 1.75 mi at 1 in 69 to Blakeney, {{where there was}} a goods shed. At 1 in 60 it crossed the main road, a 10-span viaduct, went through two <b>deep</b> <b>cuttings,</b> crossed the Roman road at Blackpool Bridge and another cutting to Howbeach Colliery. Beyond the line rose at 1 in 103, then 1 in 54 to New Fancy.|$|R
50|$|Twywell Gullet is {{a former}} {{ironstone}} quarry which has <b>deep</b> <b>cuttings</b> with steeply sloping banks. It has species-rich limestone grassland on the slopes and ponds and scrub in the bottoms. There {{are a number of}} uncommon ground nesting bees and wasps, and beetles include the nationally rare ruddy darter. There is a large pond which has a large reedbed and many great crested newts.|$|R
500|$|The four locks at Wootton Rivers {{mark the}} end of the climb from the Avon. Between Wootton Top Lock and Crofton is the summit pound of the canal at [...] above sea level, {{stretching}} for about [...] and including the [...] Bruce Tunnel. The tunnel is named after the local land owner, Thomas Brudenell-Bruce, 1st Earl of Ailesbury (1729–1814), who refused to allow a <b>deep</b> <b>cutting</b> through his property and insisted on a tunnel. The tunnel has red brick portals, capped with Bath stone, each with a decorative plaque of Pennant stone. The tunnel was begun in 1806 and finished in 1809. It is lined with English bond brickwork and has a wide bore to cope with the Newbury barges used on the canal. There is no towpath through the tunnel, so walkers and cyclists must walk {{across the top of the}} hill. When canal boats were pulled by horses the boatmen had to haul their barges through the tunnel by hand, pulling on chains that ran along the inside walls.|$|E
2500|$|On {{the left}} is the beach and seaside amusements; on the right are some camping coaches in the old goods yard. [...] The railway now comes onto the Sea Wall which it shares with a footpath, {{although}} it quickly enters the short and <b>deep</b> <b>cutting</b> at Langstone Rock. Emerging above the beach, views can be had across the sea towards Torbay.|$|E
2500|$|When {{planning}} a canal, the designer {{will attempt to}} build a summit level with a large reservoir, or one supplied by an artificial watercourse from a distant source, or one {{as long as possible}} (to act as its own reservoir) or which cuts across as many springs or rivers as possible (or all of these). [...] Driving the summit level through a <b>deep</b> <b>cutting</b> or tunnel may cut through the water table as well as underground sources of water.|$|E
50|$|In June 1863 an engineer, Charles Bartholomew, {{was asked}} {{to go over the}} line and advise on what should be done to make {{possible}} an early opening. He reported that £7,308 would be required, and he was critical of the engineering of the construction work already carried out. He observed that three difficult and <b>deep</b> <b>cuttings</b> could easily have been avoided altogether, as each is quite close {{to the end of a}} spur round which the line could have been carried.|$|R
5000|$|The first {{director}} was George Wilton Chambers, a coal master. Its secretary was Thomas Pearson, {{a civil engineer}} and also a coal master. The engineers were John Stephenson (not {{known to be a}} relation of George) who introduced scientific methods into earthwork construction and the excavation of <b>deep</b> <b>cuttings,</b> and Isaac Dodds whose [...] "talent for invention was highly respected in his day" [...] Superintending the construction was Frederick Swanwick, a pupil of George Stephenson, who was nominally engineering chief.|$|R
50|$|The Gäu Railway {{was planned}} by railway engineer, Georg Morlok, and was characterised by viaducts and <b>deep</b> rock <b>cuttings</b> that were an {{architectural}} challenge to build.|$|R
2500|$|Taking {{over the}} [...] "Winchester Bypass" [...] the M3 resumes to three lanes each way at Junction 9, {{continues}} directly south and then takes a small curve around {{the east of}} the city running through a <b>deep</b> <b>cutting</b> in Twyford Down and then proceeding south west again, crossing the South West Main Line a second time alongside the River Itchen and through the Eastleigh urban-suburban area before crossing the Eastleigh to Romsey railway line and ending at the Chilworth Roundabout on the edge of Southampton.|$|E
2500|$|Departing Three Bridges {{station on}} a curve, the line passed under the London to Brighton road before {{climbing}} at 1 in 88, passing over a level crossing known as [...] "Compasses Crossing" [...] and, just before arriving at Rowfant station, crossed Wallage Lane on the level. The line then climbed again at 1 in 80 {{passing through a}} [...] <b>deep</b> <b>cutting</b> in J.H. Wilson's land and Grange Road station, travelling through an arable and wooded landscape before arriving at East Grinstead station which was in Swan Mead, off the London Road.|$|E
2500|$|The main {{village of}} Lealholm is {{situated}} {{at the bottom of}} Crunkly Ghyll (sometimes spelled [...] "Crunkley" [...] and [...] "Gill"), a <b>deep</b> <b>cutting</b> where the river emerges into the flat bottom of a glacial U-shaped valley. This was crucial to its development as a settlement, becoming an important crossing point over the River Esk where the valley flattens out, becoming shallow at end of a sharp bend in the river before slowing to a deeper meandering course further downstream. The remains of the fording point are still visible next to the arched bridge used today, which dates back to the 17th century. Three roads lead from the centre of the village, one follows the river up the valley towards Danby; the second heads north past the hamlet of Lealholmside and across the moors towards Whitby; and the third leads south, towards Fryup and Rosedale.|$|E
50|$|From here, {{the highway}} crosses {{the mouth of}} Tai Lam Chung, and starts {{climbing}} the hillsides of Tai Lam through split level terraces (the lower one being the Tuen Mun bound carriageway). The two carriageways join before bypassing the village of Tsing Lung Tau to the north. This section of road is constructed upon various <b>deep</b> <b>cuttings</b> and high embankments. Afterwards, the road crosses over the village of Sham Tseng (situated in a valley) to Sham Tseng Interchange, where it interchanges once again with Castle Peak Road.|$|R
50|$|In the 1820s, Thomas Telford {{constructed}} a new canal {{parallel to the}} old in a <b>deeper</b> <b>cutting,</b> at the 453 ft Birmingham Level, creating the largest man-made earthworks {{in the world at}} the time. It was spanned by the Galton Bridge. The engine was still needed, despite both these developments, and Thomas Telford constructed the Engine Arm Aqueduct carrying the Engine Arm branch canal over his New Main Line so that coal could still be transported along the arm to feed the Smethwick Engine.|$|R
50|$|For Mr. Heathcote of Tiverton, Parkes {{carried out}} a plan for {{draining}} a part of Chat Moss, Lancashire, which he tried to cultivate by using steam power. The steam cultivation was a failure. Parkes, however, observed the <b>deep</b> <b>cuttings</b> on the bog, and found that deep drains began to run after wet weather, not from the water above, but from rising water. Draining the stagnant moisture from about a metre below the surface had a marked effect on the soil. Parkes's views replaced the convention wisdom of the time, of James Smith of Deanston.|$|R
