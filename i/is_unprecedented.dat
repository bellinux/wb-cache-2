The Mérida Initiative provides Mexico and Central American countries with law enforcement training and equipment, as well as technical advice to strengthen the national justice systems. The Mérida Initiative does not include cash or weapons.|$|E
25|$|Five debates {{survive in}} the Persian poetic form of qasida. Although qasida <b>is</b> <b>unprecedented</b> in Arabic or New Persian, {{it is part of}} the Middle Persian (Pahlavi) tradition. The Pahlavic poetic debate Draxt i Asurik {{indicates}} the history of this form of debate. The surviving debates are Arab o 'Ajam (The Arab vs. the Persian), Mogh o Mosalman (The Zoroastian vs. the Muslim), Shab o Ruz (Night vs. Day), Neyza o Kaman (Spear vs. Bow) and Asman o Zamin (Sky vs. Earth). The Persian wins the Persian-versus-Arab debate, while the Muslim defeats the Zoroastrian.|$|E
25|$|Apart from bipedalism, humans {{differ from}} {{chimpanzees}} mostly in smelling, hearing, digesting proteins, brain size, {{and the ability}} of language. Humans' brains are about three times bigger than in chimpanzees. More importantly, the brain to body ratio is much higher in humans than in chimpanzees, and humans have a significantly more developed cerebral cortex, with a larger number of neurons. The mental abilities of humans are remarkable compared to other apes. Humans' ability of speech is unique among primates. Humans are able to create new and complex ideas, and to develop technology, which <b>is</b> <b>unprecedented</b> among other organisms on Earth.|$|E

He then played major roles in several action movies and a brief television career playing the lead role in the television sitcom Kaya ni Mister, Kaya ni Misis.

The film <b>is</b> <b>unprecedented</b> as it portrays Philippine society during Spanish colonization of the Philippines and its relevance {{up to the present}} day. After his first Hollywood movie The Great Raid with Benjamin Bratt, he was cast in another Hollywood movie Another Deep Breath which was never actually shot.|$|E
25|$|The very swift moving tornado {{at times}} {{exhibited}} an unusual appearance due partially to {{its size and}} the probable low cloud base of its parent thunderstorm. The tornado was frequently described by witnesses as an amorphous rolling fog or boiling clouds on the ground, and fooled normally weather-wise farm owners (in addition to people in general) who did not sense the danger until the storm was upon them. The condensation funnel was also reportedly sometimes wrapped in copious dust and debris, making it obscured and less recognizable. The parent supercell apparently transitioned to a high-precipitation (HP) variety {{by the time it}} was striking West Frankfort, meaning that the tornado wasn't readily visible, as it was often shrouded in heavy rain and hail. The rural death toll of 65 in Hamilton and White counties in southeastern Illinois <b>is</b> <b>unprecedented.</b> The tornado killed at least twenty farm owners in southeastern Illinois and southwestern Indiana, more than the combined total of the next four deadliest tornadoes in the history of the U.S.|$|E
25|$|Scholars {{find that}} China has {{attained}} {{a degree of}} openness that <b>is</b> <b>unprecedented</b> among large and populous nations, with competition from foreign goods in almost every sector of the economy. Foreign investment helped to greatly increase quality, knowledge and standards, especially in heavy industry. China's experience supports the assertion that globalization greatly increases wealth for poor countries. Throughout the reform period, the government reduced tariffs and other trade barriers, with the overall tariff rate falling from 56% to 15%. By 2001, less than 40% of imports were subject to tariffs and only 9 percent of import were subject to licensing and import quotas. Even during the early reform era, protectionist policies were often circumvented by smuggling. When China joined the WTO, it agreed to considerably harsher conditions than other developing countries. Trade has increased from under 10% of GDP to 64% of GDP over the same period. China is considered the most open large country; By 2005, China’s average statutory tariff on industrial products was 8.9 percent. For Argentina, Brazil, India, and Indonesia, the respective percentage figures are 30.9, 27.0, 32.4, and 36.9 percent.|$|E

500|$|For instance, The {{scale of}} damage {{resulting}} from the Operation Protective Edge <b>is</b> <b>unprecedented.</b> All governorates in the Gaza Strip witnessed extensive aerial bombardment, naval shelling and artillery fire, resulting in {{a considerable amount of}} rubble.

A tremendous amount of debris remains scattered in Gaza. Serious efforts and a high budget are required to handle this challenge. [...] More importantly, and based on a UNEP study after the 2008 war, the debris is highly likely to be contaminated with PAHs and probably with polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs), dioxins, and furan compounds.|$|E

500|$|Above the pylon, {{separated}} by the cornice, {{are the three}} Virtues—from left to right, Faith, Charity, and Hope—in shell niches, {{separated by}} four Corinthian fluted pilasters. Such a motif <b>is</b> <b>unprecedented</b> in Tuscan funerary sculpture but found at this date in Venice, Padua, and especially Cossa's native Naples. As a result, excursions to Venice have been suggested for both Michelozzo and Donatello. However, Janson suggests that one [...] "need not {{go all the way}} to Venice" [...] to find such motifs. Outside Florence, Virtues were common on tombs, with the cardinal Virtues used for laymen, and the theological virtues reserved for ecclesiastics, including the Brancaccio tomb. However, the Cossa Virtues, from their hair to their sandals, are more thoroughly antique. Donatello also produced two similar bronze Virtues for the Siena Baptistry, whose chronological relationship to the Cossa Virtues is unclear.|$|E
500|$|On July 22, 2005, in {{response}} to bombings in London, the New York City Transit Police introduced a new policy of randomly searching passengers' bags as they approached turnstiles. The NYPD claimed that no form of racial profiling would be conducted when these searches actually took place. The NYPD {{has come under fire}} from some groups that claim purely random searches without any form of threat assessment would be ineffectual. Donna Lieberman, Executive Director of the NYCLU, stated, [...] "This NYPD bag search policy <b>is</b> <b>unprecedented,</b> unlawful and ineffective. It is essential that police be aggressive in maintaining security in public transportation. But our very real concerns about terrorism do not justify the NYPD subjecting millions of innocent people to suspicionless searches {{in a way that does}} not identify any person seeking to engage in terrorist activity and is unlikely to have any meaningful deterrent effect on terrorist activity." [...] The searches were upheld by the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit in MacWade v. Kelly.|$|E
500|$|Yuri on Ice {{was praised}} for {{including}} a same-sex romantic relationship between Yuri K. and Victor. Among moments highlighted by critics are an apparent kiss {{in the seventh}} episode, an exchange of gold rings (indicating a marriage or engagement) in the tenth episode, and Victor's tears when Yuri suggests ending their partnership in the twelfth episode. The kiss won the 2016 The Anime Awards for Most Heartwarming Scene. The exchange of rings between Yuri K. and Victor in the tenth episode is considered the first time such a relationship has been depicted in anime. Gabriella Ekens wrote for Anime News Network, [...] "Yuri on Ice, in depicting a sincere and uncomplicated engagement between two dudes, <b>is</b> <b>unprecedented</b> in anime. There hasn't even been a for real gay marriage in Japan, so this show is depicting something that isn't legally possible in its country of origin". For Anime UK News, Ian Wolf called the exchange of rings [...] "the best scene in the series". According to Wolf, the anime {{is an example of}} the Odagiri effect.|$|E

500|$|Anglin officially {{endorsed}} Donald Trump {{for president}} in 2015. Anglin encouraged the website's readers to [...] "vote {{for the first time}} in our lives for the one man who actually represents our interests". The website also received national and international coverage for its endorsement of Trump's proposal of a temporary moratorium on admitting foreign Muslims into the country; it proclaimed [...] "Heil Donald Trump – The Ultimate Savior". According to the SPLC, white supremacist endorsement of Trump <b>is</b> <b>unprecedented,</b> as the movement is generally skeptical of all politicians. In July 2016, Andrew Anglin and The Daily Stormer were mentioned by Lacy Clay, Democratic Representative from Missouri, as he asked in a congressional hearing whether FBI director James Comey was aware of Trump sharing Twitter posts by white supremacists. [...] Anglin wrote in July 2016 that he believed that Trump was a pragmatic anti-Semite who praised Israel to win votes from evangelical Christians, while dropping subtle hints about purported Jewish domination of rival Hillary Clinton's campaign. The Huffington Post journalist Jessica Schulberg compared how white nationalists like Anglin and former Ku Klux Klan leader David Duke believed Trump to be representative of their ethnic interests, while at the same time several Jews believed him to be representative of theirs.|$|E
