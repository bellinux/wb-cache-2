5|$|The wine gallon was {{abolished}} in Britain in 1826, {{and this}} system {{was replaced by}} a new one based on the newly introduced imperial gallon. Since the imperial gallon is 20% more than the liquid gallon, {{the same is true for}} the imperial pint in relation to the liquid pint. This explains why the number of fluid ounces per gallon had to be adjusted in the new system so that the <b>fluid</b> <b>ounce</b> was not changed too much by the reform. Even so, the modern UK <b>fluid</b> <b>ounce</b> is 4% less than the US <b>fluid</b> <b>ounce,</b> and the same is true for the smaller units. For some years both systems were used concurrently in the UK.|$|E

5|$|The English-speaking {{countries}} {{also used}} {{a system of}} units of fluid measure, or in modern terminology volume units, based on the apothecaries' system.

5|$|The apothecaries' {{system or}} apothecaries' weights and {{measures}} is a historical system of mass and volume units that were used by physicians and apothecaries for medical recipes, and also sometimes by scientists. The English version {{of the system is}} closely related to the English troy system of weights, the pound and grain being exactly the same in both. It divides a pound into 12 ounces, an ounce into 8 drachms, and a drachm into 3 scruples or 60 grains. This exact form of the system was used in the United Kingdom; in some of its former colonies it survived well into the 20th century. The apothecaries' system of measures is a similar system of volume units based on the <b>fluid</b> <b>ounce.</b> For a long time, medical recipes were written in Latin, often using special symbols to denote {{weights and measures}}.|$|E

Coffee carafes used with drip coffee makers, such as Black and Decker models, have markings for both water and brewed coffee, since the carafe is also used for measuring water prior to brewing. [...] A 12-cup carafe, for example, has markings for 4, 6, 8, 10, and 12 cups of water or coffee, which correspond to 20, 30, 40, 50, and 60 <b>fluid</b> <b>ounces</b> of water or 16, 24, 32, 40, and 48 <b>fluid</b> <b>ounces</b> of brewed coffee, respectively, the difference being the volume lost to evaporation during brewing.|$|R

500|$|Sandgrouse have small, pigeon-like {{heads and}} necks and sturdy compact bodies. They {{range in size}} from [...] in length and from [...] in weight. The adults are sexually dimorphic with the males being {{slightly}} larger and more brightly colored than the females. They have eleven strong primary feathers and long pointed wings giving them a fast direct flight. The muscles of the wings are powerful and the birds are capable of rapid take off and sustained flight. In some species, the central feathers in the tail are extended into long points. The legs are short and members of the genus Syrrhaptes have feathers growing on both the legs and toes and no hind toes, while members of the genus Pterocles have legs feathered just at the front, no feathers on the toes and rudimentary hind toes raised off the ground. The plumage is cryptic, generally being in shades of sandy brown, grey and buff, variously mottled and barred, enabling the birds to merge into the dusty landscape. There is a dense layer of under down which helps insulate the bird from extremes of heat and cold. The feathers of the belly are specially adapted for absorbing water and retaining it, allowing adults, particularly males, to carry water to chicks that may be many miles away from watering holes. The amount of water that can be carried in this way is 15 to 20 millilitres (0.5 to 0.7 <b>fluid</b> <b>ounce).</b>|$|E

Sixteen US fluid ounces make a US pint (8 pints equals 1 gallon in both customary and imperial systems).

2500|$|The {{differences}} between Tincture of Opium (Laudanum) and Camphorated Tincture of Opium (Paregoric) {{are important and}} {{should be kept in}} mind when administering either of these drugs. Care and caution should always be taken in administering doses of Tincture of Opium, {{such as the use of}} a dosage syringe or other suitable measurement device, and by pharmacists in preparing Paregoric from Laudanum, and to note that the dosages in this article refer to Apothecaries weight and fluid measure. In particular, [...] "the difference between a minim and a drop should be borne in mind when figuring doses. A minim is always a sixtieth part of a fluidrachm regardless of the character of the substance, while a drop varies from a forty-fifth to a two-hundred-and-fiftieth part, according to the surface tension of the fluid." [...] Tincture of Opium (Laudanum) and Camphorated Tincture of Opium (Paregoric) each have 50.9 drops per gram; 50.0 drops per cc; 185.0 drops per fluid drachm; and 3.10 drops per minim."
