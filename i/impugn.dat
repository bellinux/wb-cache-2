5|$|The Twittys {{and their}} {{supporters}} criticized a perceived lack of progress by Aruban police. The Twittys' own actions in Aruba were also criticized, and the Twittys were accused of actively stifling any evidence that might <b>impugn</b> Holloway's character by asking her fellow students to remain silent about the case and using their access to the media to push {{their own version of}} events.

5|$|In Tan Liang Joo John, Justice Judith Prakash {{stated that}} this was not a closed list, and that the court is {{entitled}} to take into account all the circumstances of the case which in its view go towards showing bad faith. She also noted that English authorities impose another limit on the content of criticism – that the acts or words in question must neither impute improper motives to nor <b>impugn</b> the integrity, propriety and impartiality of judges or the courts. However, she declined to follow these authorities and averred that to impose such a limit would be unnecessary and potentially over-restrictive of legitimate criticism.|$|E
5|$|The {{writing of}} Wheelwright's Brief and Plain Apology may have {{commenced}} {{as early as}} 1644 when Short Story was published, but based on datable events the last part was written after his vindication by the Massachusetts court in 1654. In {{the first half of}} this work, Wheelwright refers to the author of Short Story as a singular person, clearly thinking that Thomas Weld had written the entire piece. Later in his Apology, however, Wheelwright refers to the authors (plural) of Short Story, realizing that Weld was not alone in writing the material. Though Wheelwright mentions no author of Short Story by name other than Thomas Weld, he certainly had come to realize that the other author was John Winthrop, since the 1648 books by both Cotton and Rutherford mentioned this fact as an aside. Winthrop had died in 1649 with a reputation as an effective colonial leader, respected in both England and the colonies, and there was no rational reason for Wheelwright to <b>impugn</b> his good name.|$|E

It is claimed that Currie exaggerated Burns's fondness for drink and that he deliberately misdated some of Burns's letters to Mrs Dunlop. An eighth edition, published in 1820, included an additional section Some Further Particulars of the Author's Life by Gilbert Burns. However, the publishers advised Gilbert not to <b>impugn</b> Currie's accuracy and the legend that Burns was an incurable alcoholic remained unchallenged.|$|E
25|$|John Dean {{testified in}} June 1973 that Nixon was deeply {{involved}} in the Watergate cover-up, and mentioned that he suspected White House conversations were taped. Staff of the United States Senate Watergate Committee thereafter began to routinely ask witnesses appearing before the committee if they knew of any taping system. Senate Watergate Committee staff then asked the White House for a list of dates on which the President had met with Dean. About June 20 or 21, Special White House Counsel for Watergate J. Fred Buzhardt provided the committee's Chief Minority (Republican) Counsel, Fred Thompson, with a document intended to <b>impugn</b> Dean's testimony. Buzhardt's document included almost verbatim quotations from meetings Nixon had with Dean. Thompson initially violated an agreement under which the majority and minority staff would share all information. When committee Majority Investigator Scott Armstrong obtained the document, he realized the document indicated the existence of a taping system.|$|E

500|$|In 1844, Yancey {{was elected}} to the United States House of Representatives to fill a vacancy (winning with a 2,197 to 2,137 vote) and re-elected in 1845 (receiving over 4,000 votes as the Whigs did not even field a candidate). In Congress, his {{political}} ability and unusual oratorical gifts at once gained recognition. [...] Yancey delivered his first speech on January 6, 1845, when he was selected by the Democrats to respond to a speech by Thomas Clingman, a Whig from North Carolina, who had opposed Texas annexation. [...] Clingman was offended by the tone of Yancey’s speech and afterwards Yancey refused to clarify that he had not intended to <b>impugn</b> Clingman’s honor. [...] Clingman challenged Yancey to a duel, and he accepted. [...] The exchange of pistol fire occurred in nearby Beltsville, Maryland; neither combatant was injured.|$|E
500|$|When Barkley {{entered the}} Senate chamber on February 23, word had spread that Roosevelt's veto had angered him. He {{announced}} that he would resign as floor leader and encouraged his legislative colleagues to override the veto. [...] He stated that Roosevelt's characterization of the bill as [...] "providing relief not for the needy, but for the greedy" [...] was [...] "a calculated and deliberate assault upon the legislative integrity of every member of the Congress of the United States". Roosevelt sent a letter to Barkley insisting he had not intended to <b>impugn</b> Congress' integrity and urging him not to resign. The next morning, Barkley resigned and left the Democratic Conference Room; minutes later, the caucus unanimously re-elected him. Many members who had seen Barkley as Roosevelt's advocate in Congress now looked upon him as Congress' advocate with Roosevelt. Subsequently, Congress overwhelmingly overrode the veto.|$|E
500|$|In Smith v. East Elloe Rural District Council (1956), the House of Lords {{concluded}} by {{a majority}} {{that they could not}} <b>impugn</b> a partial ouster clause because, according to Viscount Simonds, [...] "plain words must be given their plain meaning", even though fraud {{on the part of the}} public authority had been alleged. In contrast, Lord Reid gave a dissenting opinion in which he doubted whether an order that had been obtained by corrupt or fraudulent means could be protected from being questioned in court. Despite the subsequent ruling in Anisminic, in R. v. Secretary of State for the Environment, ex parte Ostler (1976) the Court of Appeal of England and Wales applied Smith and upheld the validity of a partial ouster clause that gave the applicants six weeks to challenge a decision. Lord Denning, the Master of the Rolls, explained that upholding partial ouster clauses promoted the certainty of the executive's actions. It would not be in the public interest if applicants could challenge decisions after the time limit for doing so had expired, as this would delay actions taken by the executive.

500|$|Four of {{the accused}} men were tried in Westminster on 12 May 1536. Weston, Brereton, and Norris {{publicly}} maintained their innocence and only the tortured Smeaton supported the Crown by pleading guilty. Three days later, Anne and George Boleyn were tried separately in the Tower of London, before a jury of 27 peers. She was accused of adultery, incest, and high treason. By the Treason Act of Edward III, adultery {{on the part of}} a queen was a form of treason (because of the implications for the succession to the throne) for which the penalty was hanging, drawing and quartering for a man and burning alive for a woman, but the accusations, and especially that of incestuous adultery, were also designed to <b>impugn</b> her moral character. The other form of treason alleged against her was that of plotting the king's death, with her [...] "lovers", so that she might later marry Henry Norris. Henry Percy, 6th Earl of Northumberland, sat on the jury that unanimously found Anne guilty. When the verdict was announced, he collapsed and had to be carried from the courtroom. He died childless eight months later and was succeeded by his nephew. According to a 1980 legal review by Schauer and Schauer, [...] "there is little if any evidence, apart from Smeaton's possible torture, that the rules of the time were in any way bent in order to assure Anne Boleyn's conviction".|$|E
500|$|In June 1858 Wilson made a Senate {{speech in}} which he {{suggested}} corruption {{in the government of}} California and inferred complicity on the part of Senator William M. Gwin, a pro-slavery Democrat who had served as a member of Congress from Mississippi before moving to California. Gwin was backed by a powerful Southern coalition of pro-slavery Democrats called the Chivs, who had a monopoly on federal patronage in California. [...] Gwin accused Wilson of demagoguery, and Wilson responded by saying he'd rather be thought a demagogue than a thief. [...] Gwin then challenged Wilson to a duel; Wilson declined in the same terms he used to decline a duel with Preston Brooks. [...] In fact neither Gwin nor Wilson wanted to follow through, and commentary about the dispute broke down along partisan lines. [...] One pro-Gwin editorial called the insinuation that Gwin was corrupt [...] "a most malignant falsehood", while a pro-Wilson editorial called his reluctance {{to take part in a}} duel evidence that he was [...] "honest" [...] and [...] "conscientious", and had [...] "more respect for the laws of this country than his adversary". [...] After several attempts to find a face-saving compromise, Gwin and Wilson agreed to refer their dispute to three senators who would serve as mediators. William H. Seward, John J. Crittenden and Jefferson Davis were chosen, and produced an acceptable solution. [...] At their instigation, Wilson stated to the Senate that he had not meant to <b>impugn</b> Gwin's honor, and Gwin replied by saying that he had not meant to question Wilson's motives. [...] In addition, the mediators caused to be removed from the Senate record both Gwin's remarks about demagoguery and Wilson's suggestion that Gwin was a thief.|$|E
