5|$|On Nothing, Meshuggah {{abandons}} {{the fast}} tempos of Chaosphere and concentrates on slow, tuned down tempos and grooves. The album {{was intended to}} be recorded using custom-made Nevborn eight-string guitars, but the prototypes were faulty so Thordendal and Hagström used <b>detuned</b> Ibanez seven-string guitars instead. This technique, which involved keeping the instruments untuned during the sessions, created additional problems. When Ibanez provided Meshuggah with special eight-string guitars with two extra-low strings that worked properly after the initial release, the band re-recorded the guitar parts for Nothing and re-released it in 2006. Hagström notes that this allowed the band to go lower sonically and to attain bass sounds on guitars.|$|E
5|$|For {{the most}} part Cage avoids using lower {{registers}} of the piano, {{and much of the}} music's melodic foreground lies in the soprano range. Of the forty-five prepared notes, only three belong to the three lowest octaves below F#3: D3, D2 and D1. Furthermore, D2 is prepared {{in such a way that}} the resulting sound has the frequency of a D4 (resulting in two variants of D4 available, one more prepared than the other). The portion of the keyboard above F#3 is divided into roughly three registers: low, middle, and high. The low register has the heaviest preparation, and the high register the lightest. Different methods are used: certain notes produce sounds that retain the original frequency and a pianistic character; others become drum-like sounds, <b>detuned</b> versions of the original notes, or metallic, rattling sounds that have no sense of the fundamental frequency at all. The use of the soft pedal, which makes the hammers strike only two of the three strings of each note (or one, for notes with only two strings), complicates the matter further. For example, the note C5 is a metallic sound with no fundamental discernible when the soft pedal is depressed, but it sounds fairly normal if the pedal is released. It appears that Cage was fully aware of the implications of this: certain sonatas feature interplay between two versions of one note, others place special emphasis on particular notes, and still others are very dependent on particular note combinations.|$|E

25|$|In August 1969, {{after being}} {{confused}} with another group named Earth (who had minor success in England), the group renamed themselves Black Sabbath. His factory accident affected the Black Sabbath sound; by 1970 Iommi had <b>detuned</b> his guitar from E to E♭ (a minor second down), and from 1971's Master of Reality album, had <b>detuned</b> it further to D♭ (a minor third down), {{to ease the}} tension on his fingers. Black Sabbath bassist Geezer Butler did the same to match Iommi. Sabbath {{was among the first}} bands to detune, and the technique became a mainstay of heavy metal music. Iommi combined blues-like guitar solos and dark, minor-key riffing with a revolutionary high-gain, heavily distorted tone with his use of power chords, a modified treble-boosting effect-pedal and a Gibson SG.|$|E

40|$|Rephasing and non-rephasing {{two-dimensional}} coherent spectra map the anti-crossing {{associated with}} normal-mode splitting in a semiconductor microcavity. For a 12 -meV <b>detuning</b> range near zero <b>detuning,</b> {{it is observed}} that there are two diagonal features related to the intra-action of exciton-polariton branches and two off-diagonal features related to coherent interaction between the polaritons. At negative <b>detuning,</b> the lineshape properties of the diagonal intra-action features are distinguishable and can be associated with cavity-like and exciton-like modes. A biexcitonic companion feature is observed, shifted from the exciton feature by the biexciton binding energy. Closer to zero <b>detuning,</b> all features are enhanced and the diagonal intra-action features become nearly equal in amplitude and linewidth. At positive <b>detuning</b> the exciton- and cavity-like characteristics return to the diagonal intra-action features.

25|$|Since then, death metal has diversified, {{spawning}} several subgenres. Melodic death metal combines death metal elements {{with those}} of the new wave of British heavy metal. Technical death metal is a complex style, with uncommon time signatures, atypical rhythms and unusual harmonies and melodies.

40|$|An {{experimental}} {{investigation of}} the modal selection induced by optical injection in 1550 nm multitransverse-mode VCSELs is performed. The free-running VCSEL emits in two transverse modes that are linearly polarized in a direction referred as parallel. We consider {{the situation in which}} parallel polarized laser light is injected in the VCSEL in order to select its fundamental transverse mode. We analyze the dependence of the modal selection process on the wavelength <b>detuning</b> between the externally injected signal and the fundamental mode. The injected power needed to select the fundamental mode {{as a function of the}} wavelength <b>detuning</b> is measured for several values of the bias current. This injected power exhibits a minimum at a positive wavelength <b>detuning.</b> The curves obtained for different bias currents are very close for positive and large wavelength <b>detuning,</b> while they are very separated for smaller <b>detuning.</b> The selection of the fundamental mode can be obtained with a value of the injected power that changes only slightly with the bias current when the wavelength <b>detuning</b> is large and positive. These results indicate that operation at large and positive wavelength <b>detuning</b> is of interest in the long-distance single-mode fiber transmission of multimode injection-locked VCSELs because the selection of the fundamental mode is obtained with an injected power that is almost independent on the VCSEL bias current. Both, the minimum injected power and the wavelength <b>detuning</b> at which it appears increase with the VCSEL bias current. We describe the relation between transverse mode selection and injection locking by comparing the dependence of both phenomena on the wavelength <b>detuning.</b> Modal selection is accompanied by injection locking only for large and positive values of the wavelength <b>detuning.</b> For small <b>detuning</b> values, with the VCSEL biased with a low (high) current, the injected power required for modal selection is lower (higher) than that needed for injection locking. © 2011 Copyright SPIE - The International Society for Optical Engineering...|$|R
25|$|Hanel did {{not stay}} {{long in the}} group, {{and by the time}} of their {{recording}} debut she had been replaced by Bob Pezzola. This lineup of the group also featured saxophonist Daniel Galli-Duani, who had previously played with Kane as the avant-garde duo Transmission. The debut EP, Swans, released on Labor, is markedly different from anything they would do later. The plodding tempos and distorted, <b>detuned</b> guitar work is reminiscent of such post-punk outfits as Joy Division. However, the minimal chord structures owe more to blues, while the jazz instrumentation and awkward time signatures are evidence of Swans' roots in the no wave scene of the late 1970s, which had more or less collapsed by the release of 1984's Cop.|$|E

25|$|Perfect fifths may be justly tuned or tempered. Two notes whose {{frequencies}} {{differ by}} {{a ratio of}} 3:2 make the interval known as a justly tuned perfect fifth. Cascading twelve such fifths does {{not return to the}} original pitch class after going round the circle, so the 3:2 ratio may be slightly <b>detuned,</b> or tempered. Temperament allows perfect fifths to cycle, and allows pieces to be transposed, or played in any key on a piano or other fixed-pitch instrument without distorting their harmony. The primary tuning system used for Western (especially keyboard and fretted) instruments today, twelve-tone equal temperament, uses an irrational multiplier, 21/12, to calculate the frequency difference of a semitone. An equal-tempered fifth, at a frequency ratio of 27/12:1 (or about 1.498307077:1) is approximately two cents narrower than a justly tuned fifth at a ratio of 3:2.|$|E
25|$|The new McLaren-Honda package {{started out}} to be {{unreliable}} and problematic after a 29 January launch.

This continued into Malaysia where Button had to retire from the race. In China, Button collided with Lotus racer Pastor Maldonado in the latter stages of the Grand Prix. Button received a five-second time penalty dropping him one spot to 14th and two penalty points to his super licence which was previously clean for which the points will last twelve months. Button described the crash as 'just a misjudgement'.

At his home Grand Prix in Great Britain, Button retired on the first lap after contact with his teammate Alonso. At the Hungarian Grand Prix, Button finished in ninth place.
