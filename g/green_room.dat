25|$|In 1961, First Lady Jacqueline Kennedy began a major {{refurbishment}} of the White House {{that included the}} <b>Green</b> <b>Room.</b> Her renovation was technically overseen by an advisory Committee on Fine Arts made up of museum professionals as well as wealthy individuals interested in antiques.
