The present study addresses machining of free-form surfaces on a 3 -axis NC machine tool. There have recently been {{a large number of}} studies devoted to planning tool paths on free-form surfaces with various strategies being adopted. These strategies are intended to increase efficiency by reducing the overall length of machining. Often, the choice of the cutter is arbitrary and the work focuses on planning. In order to boost productivity, the present work offers assistance in choosing the cutting tool, the machining direction and cutting by surface zones, adopting a milling strategy by parallel planes. To do so, a comparison is made between milling using a spherical end milling cutter and a torus end milling cutter with the same outer radius.

These four diatoms are characterized by distinct size, shape and colony forming ability and are important components of the autumnal bloom co-occurring with the seasonal peak of T. stylifera abundance in Mediterranean coastal waters. High-speed video recordings showed that T. stylifera acquired cells in a suspension feeding mode while creating feeding currents.

As a key {{component}} of heavy five-axis linkage CNC machine tools, the existing mechanical biaxial rotary milling heads are usually driven by worm gear, timing belt, or multi-stage gears. Worm gear is inefficiency to transmit motion, hard to maintain the accuracy and difficult to eliminate all clearance; Timing belt can be seriously worn and cannot maintain good accuracy; and multi-stage gears transmission has defects such as long chain, low transmission stiffness. This paper aims at designing a biaxial rotary milling head with large output torque of 3000 Nm, high precision and high rigidity.

40|$|Milling is {{a process}} of {{producing}} flat and complex shapes with the use of multi-tooth cutting tool, which is called a milling cutter and the cutting edges are called teeth. The axis of rotation of the cutting tool is perpendicular to the <b>direction</b> <b>of</b> <b>feed,</b> either parallel or perpendicular to the machined surface. The machine tool that traditionally performs this operation is a milling machine. Milling is an interrupted cutting operation: the teeth of the milling cutter enter and exit the work during each revolution. This interrupted cutting action subjects the teeth to a cycle of impact force and thermal shock on every rotation. The tool material and cutter geometry must be designed to withstand these conditions. Cutting fluids are essential for most milling operations. In this Paper the design aspects of milling cutter is analyzed. The objective considered is the design and modeling of milling cutter and to analyse various stress components acting on it.

The laser beam was scanned in a sinusoidal mode {{perpendicular to the}} <b>direction</b> <b>of</b> <b>feed</b> {{and the influence of}} the oscillation parameters frequency and amplitude on the weld geometry was investigated. Scanning frequencies up to 1 kHz and oscillation amplitudes in the range from 0. 25 mm to 1 mm were examined. Throughout the experiments the laser power and the feed rate were kept constant. A decrease of welding depth with amplitude and frequency is found. The scanning amplitude had a strong influence and allowed coarse setting of the welding depth into the lower material, while the frequency allowed fine tuning in the order of 10 % of the obtained depth. The oscillation parameters were found to act differently on the aluminum sheet compared to copper sheet regarding the amount of fused material. It is possible to influence the geometry of the fused zones separately for both sheets. Therefore the average composition in the weld can be set with high precision via the oscillation parameters.
