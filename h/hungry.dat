5|$|<b>Hungry</b> Jack's {{currently}} {{owns and}} operates or sub-licenses all of the <b>Hungry</b> Jack's restaurants in Australia. As the master franchise for the continent, the company is responsible for licensing new operators, opening its own stores and performing standards oversight of franchised locations in Australia. As the end of Burger King's 2012 fiscal year, <b>Hungry</b> Jack's is the largest Asian/Pacific franchisee of the chain with 347 restaurants either directly owned by parent company <b>Hungry</b> Jack's Pty or through third party licensees.|$|E
5|$|After Burger King Corporation {{lost the}} case, {{it decided to}} {{terminate}} its operations in the country, and in July 2002, the company transferred its assets to its New Zealand franchise group, Trans-Pacific Foods (TPF). The terms of the sale had TPF assume oversight of the Burger King franchises {{in the region as}} the Burger King brand's master franchisee. Trans-Pacific Foods administered the chain's 81 locations until September 2003 when the new management team of Burger King Corporation reached an agreement with <b>Hungry</b> Jack's Pty Ltd to re-brand the existing Burger King locations to <b>Hungry</b> Jack's and make HJP the sole master franchisee of both brands. An additional part of the agreement required Burger King Corporation to provide administrative and advertising support as to insure a common marketing scheme for the company and its products. Trans-Pacific Foods transferred its control of the Burger King franchises to <b>Hungry</b> Jack's Pty Ltd, which subsequently renamed the remaining Burger King locations as <b>Hungry</b> Jack's.|$|E
5|$|After the {{expiration}} of the trademark {{in the late}} 1990s, Burger King unsuccessfully tried to introduce the brand to the continent. After losing a lawsuit filed against it by <b>Hungry</b> Jack's ownership, the company ceded the territory to its franchisee. <b>Hungry</b> Jack's is now the only Burger King brand in Australia; Cowin's company <b>Hungry</b> Jack's PTY is the master franchise and thus is now responsible for oversight of the operations that country with Burger King only providing administrative and advertising support to ensure a common marketing scheme for {{the company and its}} products.|$|E

5|$|In 1990, <b>Hungry</b> Jack's renewed its {{franchise}} agreement with then BK parent Burger King Corporation, which allowed <b>Hungry</b> Jack's to license third party franchisee. One {{of the terms}} and conditions of the renewed agreement required <b>Hungry</b> Jack's to open a minimum number of new locations each year {{for the duration of}} the contract. Shortly after the Australian trademark on the Burger King name lapsed in 1996, Burger King requested that Cowin rebrand the <b>Hungry</b> Jack's locations to Burger King, which Cowin declined. Burger King Corporation accused <b>Hungry</b> Jack's of violating the conditions of the renewed {{franchise agreement}} by failing to expand the chain at the rate defined and sought to terminate the agreement. Under the aegis of this claim, Burger King Corporation, in partnership with Royal Dutch Shell's Australian division Shell Company of Australia Ltd., began to open its own stores in 1997 beginning in Sydney and extending throughout the regions of New South Wales, Australian Capital Territory and Victoria. In addition, BK sought to limit HJ's ability to open new locations in the country, whether they were corporate locations or third-party licensees.|$|E

5|$|The {{reason for}} sexual {{cannibalism}} has been debated; experiments show that females on low quality diets {{have a higher}} chance to engage in sexual cannibalism compared to females on high quality diets. Some consider that submissive males gain a selective advantage by producing offspring. This theory {{is supported by a}} quantifiable increase in the duration of copulation among males which are cannibalized, in some cases doubling both the duration and the chance of fertilization. This is contrasted by a study where males were seen to approach <b>hungry</b> females with more caution, and were shown to remain mounted on <b>hungry</b> females for a longer time, indicating that males that actively avoid cannibalism may mate with multiple females. The same study also found that <b>hungry</b> females generally attracted fewer males than those that were well fed. The act of dismounting after copulation is dangerous for males, for at this time, females most frequently cannibalize their mates. An increase in mounting duration appears to indicate that males wait for an opportune time to dismount a <b>hungry</b> female, who would be likely to cannibalize her mate.|$|E

5|$|Sir John Tenniel drew {{a famous}} {{illustration}} of Alice meeting a caterpillar for Lewis Carroll's Alice in Wonderland, c. 1865. The caterpillar is {{seated on a}} toadstool and is smoking a hookah; the image {{can be read as}} showing either the forelegs of the larva, or as suggesting a face with protruding nose and chin. Eric Carle's children's book The Very <b>Hungry</b> Caterpillar portrays the larva as an extraordinarily <b>hungry</b> animal, while also teaching children how to count (to five) and the days of the week.|$|E
5|$|As {{a result}} of Burger King's actions, <b>Hungry</b> Jack's owner Jack Cowin and his private holding company Competitive Foods Australia began legal {{proceedings}} in 2001 against Burger King's parent Burger King Corporation with a counter-claim {{that the company had}} violated the conditions of the master franchising agreement and was in breach of the contract. In a decision handed down by the Supreme Court of New South Wales that affirmed Cowin's claims, Burger King was determined to have violated the terms of the contract and as a result was required to pay Cowin and <b>Hungry</b> Jack's a $46.9million (Aus, $41.6million USD 2001) award. The court's decision {{was one of the first}} major cases in Australia that implied that the American legal concept of good faith negotiations existed with the framework of the Australian legal system, which until that verdict, had rarely been seen in the country's courts. In its decision, the Court stated that Burger King had failed to act in good faith during contract negotiations by seeking to include standards and clauses that would engineer a default of the franchise agreement, allowing the company to limit the number of new <b>Hungry</b> Jack’s branded restaurants and ultimately claim the Australian market as its own, a purpose that was extraneous to the agreement.|$|E

Parks asks Melanie {{to shoot him}} before the infection cycle finishes so he does not turn into a hungry; she agrees to do so. She asks him to shoot the mass of spores with a flamethrower, deducing correctly that the environmental trigger to open the spores is fire. Before Melanie complies with Parks' request to kill him, she explains {{that as long as}} there are healthy humans, the war between them and the <b>hungries</b> will continue. For second-generation <b>hungries</b> to be born and rebuild the world, every human must first be infected.|$|R
50|$|As the van is now broken down, {{the group}} proceed to London on foot {{where there is}} greater {{likelihood}} of food and supplies and where they can better communicate with Beacon, a larger military base. They discover London (which is overgrown with wild, unkempt vegetation) populated with multitudes of dormant, unstimulated <b>hungries.</b> By using a gel that blocks their scent and moving quietly, they manage to sneak past the <b>hungries,</b> shooting several in the head along the way, eventually finding shelter in an abandoned hospital. When they try to leave the next day, they realize the hospital has been surrounded by a greater horde of <b>hungries,</b> possibly from their gunfire the day before. Melanie offers to lead the <b>hungries</b> away - as she alone cannot be attacked, essentially by being one - and the group agrees. She wanders around the area, exploring houses and experiencing childish wonder at the domestic and everyday objects she has never before encountered. She chases and devours a cat, then captures a small dog to use as bait to distract and lure the <b>hungries</b> away from the hospital so the group can escape. After leaving the hospital, Melanie sees a poster of a cat, and stares at it while Helen asks her if {{she would like to}} have a cat. Melanie quips that she already had one.|$|R

50|$|The {{authorities}} in Beacon {{set up a}} remote military base {{for the study of}} a specific group of child <b>hungries.</b> They, unlike others, are able to retain their mental powers and only lose control when they get too close to human scent. Soldiers, led by Sergeant Eddie Parks, find such child <b>hungries</b> and bring them to the base, where they are educated by teachers and tested by the head scientist, Dr. Caroline Caldwell. This often means she vivisects the children, which Helen Justineau, a behavioural psychologist and teacher at the base, dislikes. Justineau sees the child <b>hungries</b> as people, and is especially fond of Melanie, a 10-year-old with a genius-level IQ. Melanie loves Justineau as a surrogate mother. Like the other children, Melanie does not understand that she is different from the adults.|$|R
