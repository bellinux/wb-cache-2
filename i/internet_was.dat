5|$|The <b>Internet</b> <b>was</b> {{a growing}} {{phenomenon}} at the time, and numerous websites that tracked the comet's progress and provided daily images {{from around the}} world became extremely popular.

5|$|In 2006, when US <b>Internet</b> <b>was</b> {{selected}} {{to construct the}} network, plans existed for the wireless service {{to be available to}} residents for a subscription of $19.95 per month, for speeds of one to three megabits per second, which were comparable to the speeds being offered by other internet service providers in the area at the time but at half the cost. USI Wireless has been marketing the service since then, including with billboards featuring local personality Fancy Ray.|$|E
5|$|Advertising on the <b>Internet</b> <b>was</b> liberalized by the Government in {{time for}} the 2011 general elections. Two forms of {{political}} advertising on the Internet are permitted during parliamentary elections. First, during the election period – that is, the period between the day the writ of election is issued and the start of polling day – political parties, candidates or election agents may use the Internet to further candidates' campaigns, including using websites, chat rooms or discussion forums, video and photograph sharing or hosting websites, e-mail, micro-blog posts (such as Twitter), SMS and MMS messages, digital audio and video files, electronic media applications, and blogs and social networking services (such as Facebook). Election advertising sent by e-mail, micro-blog post, SMS or MMS must contain a functioning e-mail address or mobile phone number to enable recipients to indicate that they do not wish to receive further messages from the sender.|$|E

5|$|Between November 2006 and April 2007, four Singaporean JI {{members were}} {{detained}} under the ISA while {{one had a}} restriction order issued against him. In addition, lawyer and lecturer Abdul Basheer s/o Abdul Kader, who radicalized himself by reading extremist propaganda on the <b>Internet,</b> <b>was</b> detained in February 2007 for preparing to engage in militant activities in Afghanistan. He was released on 21 February 2010, but rearrested in September 2012 and detained under the ISA the following month for planning to resume jihadist terrorism against foreign military operations abroad, including leaving Singapore– illegally, if necessary– to do so.|$|E
5|$|In 2003, the Free Expression Policy Project {{assisted}} 33 academics {{specializing in}} journalism, with filing a friend-of-the-court brief challenging a law which restricted {{the sale of}} violent video games to youths. In 2004 the organization operated at the National Coalition Against Censorship. In 2005 the organization {{was part of the}} Brennan Center for Justice at New York University Law School. Within the Brennan Center for Justice, the FEPP operated through the Democracy Program at the law school. In 2006 the organization, in collaboration with the Brennan Center for Justice, released a report on the inefficiency of Internet filtering. The 87-page report concluded that academic-based censorship of material on the <b>Internet</b> <b>was</b> far too broad and harmed free expression of ideas. The FEPP became independent from both the National Coalition Against Censorship and the Brennan Center for Justice in 2007.|$|E
5|$|Just {{as there}} is a need for tax shifting, there is also a need for subsidy shifting. Subsidies are not an {{inherently}} bad thing as many technologies and industries emerged through government subsidy schemes. The Stern Review explains that of 20 key innovations from the past 30years, only one of the 14 was funded entirely by the private sector and nine were totally publicly funded. In terms of specific examples, the <b>Internet</b> <b>was</b> the result of publicly funded links among computers in government laboratories and research institutes. And the combination of the federal tax deduction and a robust state tax deduction in California helped to create the modern wind power industry.|$|E

5000|$|Another {{example from}} that period is IBM's TCP/IP Tutorial and Technical Overview (...) from 1989, which stated that:The words {{internetwork}} and <b>internet</b> <b>is</b> [...] simply a contraction {{of the phrase}} interconnected network.

Hence, the <b>Internet</b> <b>is</b> an <b>internet,</b> but the reverse does not apply. The <b>Internet</b> <b>is</b> sometimes called the connected internet.|$|R
5|$|On {{the other}} hand, Internet and {{international}} telephone service in Ürümqi remained limited {{for nearly a}} year after the riots. As late as November, most of the <b>Internet</b> <b>was</b> still inaccessible to residents and international phone calls were impossible; as late as December, most web content hosted outside the autonomous region remained off-limits to all but a few journalists, and residents had to travel to Dunhuang 14 hours away to access the Internet normally. Within the city, only about 100 local sites, such as banks and regional government websites, could be accessed. Both incoming and outgoing international phone calls were disallowed, so Ürümqi residents could only communicate by calling intermediaries in other cities in China who would then place the international calls. The communications blackout generated controversy even within China: Yu Xiaofeng of Zhejiang University criticised the move, and many Ürümqi locals said it hurt businesses and delayed recovery, whereas David Gosset of the Euro-China forum argued that the government had the right to shut down communications for the sake of social stability; some locals believed that getting away from the Internet even improved their quality of life.|$|E

40|$|Research {{has shown}} that the <b>internet</b> <b>is</b> an {{important}} agent of mobilization that spurs young people into political action. We examine the effect of following the news online and watching television news on political participation. We hypothesize that the <b>internet</b> <b>is</b> more effective in stimulating young people to engage, and that the <b>internet</b> <b>is</b> most likely to affect the higher educated. We test our hypothesis using a two-wave panel survey among young people. The results show that the <b>internet</b> <b>is</b> by no means more effective than television. Furthermore, the <b>internet</b> <b>is</b> not more likely to spur higher educated into political activism than lower educated. Finally, analyses on the panel data show that young people become more politically active through their prior engagement and current level of attentiveness to the news, not through their past media use habits. status: publishe...|$|R
