5|$|Uncomplicated infections can be {{diagnosed}} and treated based on symptoms alone. Antibiotics taken by mouth such as trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole (TMP/SMX), nitrofurantoin, or <b>fosfomycin</b> are typically first line. Cephalosporins, amoxicillin/clavulanic acid, or a fluoroquinolone {{may also be}} used. However, resistance to fluoroquinolones among the bacterial that cause urinary infections has been increasing. The FDA recommends {{against the use of}} fluoroquinolones when other options are available due to higher risks of serious side effects. These medications substantially shorten the time to recovery with all being equally effective. A three-day treatment with trimethoprim, TMP/SMX, or a fluoroquinolone is usually sufficient, whereas nitrofurantoin requires 5–7days. <b>Fosfomycin</b> may be used as a single dose but has been associated with lower rates of efficacy.|$|E
2500|$|While ESBL-producing organisms were {{previously}} associated with hospitals and institutional care, these organisms are now increasingly {{found in the}} community. [...] CTX-M-15-positive E. coli are a cause of community-acquired urinary infections in the UK, and tend to be resistant to all oral β-lactam antibiotics, as well as quinolones and sulfonamides. [...] Treatment options may include nitrofurantoin, <b>fosfomycin,</b> mecillinam and chloramphenicol. [...] In desperation, once-daily ertapenem or gentamicin injections may also be used.|$|E
50|$|The {{complete}} <b>fosfomycin</b> biosynthetic {{gene cluster}} from Streptomyces fradiae has been cloned and sequenced and the heterologous production of <b>fosfomycin</b> in S. lividans {{has been achieved}} by Ryan Woodyer of the Huimin Zhao and Wilfred van der Donk research groups.|$|E
50|$|Synthesis is {{inhibited}} by <b>fosfomycin.</b>|$|E
50|$|Several {{antimicrobial}} {{drugs have}} been tested for the effective treatment of CRE. <b>Fosfomycin</b> is an antimicrobial agent that acts to inhibit UDP-N-acetylglucosamine enolpyruvyl transferase (MurA) which catalyzes {{one of the early}} steps of bacterial cell wall synthesis, and is effective against Gram-negative and -positive aerobic bacteria, such as CRE. A meta-analysis of 17 studies investigating the clinical effectiveness of <b>fosfomycin</b> in four multidrug-resistant strains of Enterobacteriaceae found 11 which reported that over 90% of bacterial isolates were susceptible to <b>fosfomycin.</b>|$|E

50|$|<b>Fosfomycin</b> {{enters the}} {{bacterial}} cell through the glycerophosphate transporter.|$|E
50|$|The {{elevated}} {{level of}} antimicrobial activity by <b>fosfomycin</b> {{can be attributed}} to the fact that resistance to this antibiotic in Enterobacteriaceae is chromosomally encoded and not plasmid-mediated. This causes a decreased capacity for survival in the bacteria. Bacteria that are naturally resistant to <b>fosfomycin</b> are less robust and less pathogenic.|$|E
50|$|Mutations that {{inactivate}} the nonessential glycerophosphate transporter render bacteria {{resistant to}} <b>fosfomycin.</b>|$|E
50|$|Fosfomycin/tobramycin is a {{formulation}} of <b>fosfomycin</b> and tobramycin. <b>Fosfomycin</b> is a phosphonic acid antibiotic active against gram-positive, gram-negative, and anaerobic bacteria. Tobramycin is an aminoglycoside with gram-negative activity. It is an inhaled medication targeting those with cystic fibrosis {{and is currently}} being studied by Gilead Sciences the United States Food and Drug Administration and the NIH General Clinical Research Center.|$|E
50|$|The enzyme is {{inhibited}} by {{the antibiotic}} <b>fosfomycin,</b> which covalently modifies an active site cysteine residue.|$|E
50|$|Enzymes conferring {{resistance}} to <b>fosfomycin</b> {{have also been}} identified and are encoded both chromosomally and on plasmids.|$|E
50|$|The <b>fosfomycin</b> {{molecule}} has an epoxide or oxirane ring, {{which is}} highly strained and thus very reactive.|$|E
50|$|Alternatives to <b>fosfomycin</b> include nitrofurantoin, pivmecillinam, and co-amoxiclav in oral {{treatment}} of urinary-tract infections associated with extended-spectrum beta-lactamase.|$|E
50|$|As {{a single}} dose, <b>fosfomycin</b> is more {{convenient}} than a multiple-dose therapy norfloxacin, {{for the same}} antibacterial efficacy.|$|E
50|$|FosC uses ATP {{and adds}} a {{phosphate}} group to <b>fosfomycin,</b> thus altering its properties {{and making the}} drug ineffective.|$|E
50|$|Streptomyces fradiae is {{a species}} of Actinobacteria. Different strains of S. fradiae are known to produce the {{antibiotics}} neomycin, tylosin, and <b>fosfomycin.</b>|$|E
50|$|<b>Fosfomycin</b> (originally {{known as}} phosphonomycin) was {{discovered}} in a joint effort of Merck and Co. and Spain's Compañía Española de Penicilina y Antibióticos (CEPA). It was first isolated by screening broth cultures of Streptomyces fradiae isolated from soil samples for the ability to cause formation of spheroplasts by growing bacteria. The discovery was described {{in a series of}} papers published in 1969. CEPA began producing <b>fosfomycin</b> on an industrial scale in 1971 at its Aranjuez facility.|$|E
50|$|<b>Fosfomycin</b> is {{bactericidal}} and inhibits {{bacterial cell}} wall biogenesis by inactivating the enzyme UDP-N-acetylglucosamine-3-enolpyruvyltransferase, also known as MurA. This enzyme catalyzes the committed step in peptidoglycan biosynthesis, namely the ligation of phosphoenolpyruvate (PEP) to the 3'-hydroxyl group of UDP-N-acetylglucosamine. This pyruvate moiety provides the linker that bridges the glycan and peptide portion of peptidoglycan. <b>Fosfomycin</b> is a PEP analog that inhibits MurA by alkylating an active site cysteine residue (Cys 115 in the Escherichia coli enzyme).|$|E
50|$|Three related <b>fosfomycin</b> {{resistance}} enzymes (named FosA, FosB, and FosX) {{are members}} of the glyoxalase superfamily. These enzymes function by nucleophilic attack on carbon 1 of <b>fosfomycin,</b> which opens the epoxide ring and renders the drug ineffective. The enzymes differ by the identity of the nucleophile used in the reaction: glutathione for FosA, bacillithiol for FosB, and water for FosX. In general, FosA and FosX enzymes are produced by Gram-negative bacteria, whereas FosB is produced by Gram-positive bacteria.|$|E
50|$|<b>Fosfomycin</b> (also {{known as}} phosphomycin or phosphonomycin {{and the trade}} names Monurol and Monuril) is a broad-spectrum {{antibiotic}} produced by certain Streptomyces species, although it can now be made by chemical synthesis.|$|E
50|$|Bacillithiol (BSH or Cys-GlcN-mal) is a thiol {{compound}} {{found in}} Bacillus species. It is likely involved in maintaining cellular redox balance and {{plays a role}} in microbial resistance to the antibiotic <b>fosfomycin.</b>|$|E
50|$|Bacillithiol {{appears to}} {{participate}} in the sensing of peroxides by Bacillus, but may also substitute for glutathione, which is the most common intracellular thiol in eukaryotes and some bacteria. Some of the genes involved in the biosynthesis of bacillithiol were identified and characterized in 2010. Bacteria engineered to be deficient in bacillithiol demonstrated increased sensitivity to various electrophilic xenobiotic compounds, including the antibiotic <b>fosfomycin,</b> suggesting that in these organisms the mechanism of <b>fosfomycin</b> resistance relies on the presence of bacillithiol. Furthermore, in vitro kinetic studies have established that bacillithiol is a preferred thiol substrate for the antibiotic resistance enzyme FosB.|$|E
50|$|Streptomyces wedmorensis is a {{bacterium}} species from the genus of Streptomyces {{which has been}} isolated from soil in Pennsylvania in the United States. Streptomyces wedmorensis produces (S)-2-hydroxypropylphosphonic acid epoxidase, <b>fosfomycin</b> and phosphonomycin B.|$|E

In aqueous solution, phosphonic acids ionize to give the corresponding organophosphonates.|$|E
50|$|<b>Fosfomycin</b> is {{indicated}} {{in the treatment of}} urinary tract infections (UTIs), where it is usually administered as a single oral megadose. Its use in combination with tobramycin to treat lung infections in patients with cystic fibrosis was also explored.|$|E
50|$|However, some M. morganii strains are {{resistant}} to penicillin, ampicillin/sublactam, oxacillin, first-generation and second-generation cephalosporins, macrolides, lincosamides, <b>fosfomycin,</b> colistin, and polymyxin B. The emergence of highly resistant strains of M. morganii {{have been associated with}} use of third-generation cephalosporins.|$|E

50|$|A {{number of}} natural product {{phosphonate}} substances with antibiotic properties have been identified. Phosphonate natural product antibiotics include <b>fosfomycin</b> which is FDA-approved {{for the treatment}} of non-complicated urinary tract infection as well as several pre-clinically investigated substances such as Fosmidomycin (inhibitor isoprenyl synthase), SF-2312 (inhibitor of the glycolytic enzyme Enolase, and substances of unknown mode of actions such as Alahopcin. Although phosphonates are profoundly cell impermeable, natural product phosphonate antibiotics are effective against a number of organisms, because many bacterial species express Glycerol-3-phosphate and Glucose-6-phosphate importers, which can be hijaked by phosphonate antibiotics. <b>Fosfomycin</b> resistant bacterial strains frequently have mutations that inactivate these transporters; however, such mutations are not maintained in the absence of antibiotic because of the fitness cost they impose.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Fosfomycin</b> has broad {{antibacterial}} activity against both Gram-positive and Gram-negative pathogens, with useful activity against E. faecalis, E. coli, and various Gram-negatives such as [...] Citrobacter and Proteus. Given a greater activity in a low-pH milieu, and predominant excretion in active form into the urine, <b>fosfomycin</b> has found {{use for the}} prophylaxis and treatment of UTIs caused by these uropathogens. Of note, activity against S. saprophyticus, Klebsiella, and Enterobacter is variable and should be confirmed by minimum inhibitory concentration testing. Activity against extended-spectrum β-lactamase-producing pathogens, notably ESBL-producing E. coli, is good to excellent, because the drug is not affected by cross-resistance issues.Existing clinical data support use in uncomplicated UTIs, caused by susceptible organisms. However, susceptibility break-points of 64 mg/l should not be applied for systemic infections.|$|E
50|$|The drug is well tolerated {{and has a}} low {{incidence}} of harmful side effects. However, development of bacterial resistance under therapy is a frequent occurrence and makes <b>fosfomycin</b> unsuitable for sustained therapy of severe infections. It is not recommended for children and those over 75 years old.|$|E
50|$|S. haemolyticus has {{the highest}} level of {{antibiotic}} resistance among the CoNS. Various strains are resistant to {{one or more of these}} antibiotics: penicillins, cephalosporins, macrolides, quinolones, tetracyclines, aminoglycosides, glycopeptides, and <b>fosfomycin</b> (see table in Genome structure), and multidrug resistance is common. As indicated above, even glycopeptide-resistant (vancomycin and teicoplanin) strains have begun to emerge.Meropenem would be suitable for treatment.|$|E
50|$|Trans-encoded small RNA RalA has 16 {{nucleotides}} complimentary to {{coding region}} of toxin RalR mRNA. RalA functions as an antitoxin by preventing translation of RalR (a non-specific endonuclease that cleaves methylated and unmethylated DNA). Its activity requires RNA chaperone Hfq. RalR and RalA form a type I toxin-antitoxin (TA) system. RalR/RaLA TA locus {{is responsible for}} resistance to the antibiotic <b>fosfomycin</b> in E.coli.|$|E
50|$|From the 1960s {{into the}} 1990s Merck and Co. used a {{spheroplast}} screen {{as a primary}} method for discovery of antibiotics that inhibit cell wall biosynthesis. In this screen devised by Eugene Dulaney, growing bacteria were exposed to test substances under hypertonic conditions. Inhibitors of cell wall synthesis caused growing bacteria to form spheroplasts. This screen enabled the discovery of <b>fosfomycin,</b> cephamycin C, thienamycin and several carbapenems.|$|E
