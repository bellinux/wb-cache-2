The MSMS is designed for remote operation on board unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV) for navigation and rapid collection of 3 D spatial data. Pose estimation of the camera sensors is based on single frequency RTK-GPS, loosely coupled in a Kalman filter with MEMS-based IMU. The attitude and heading reference system (AHRS) calculates orientation from the gyro data, aided by accelerometer and magnetometer data to compensate for gyro drift. Two low-cost consumer digital cameras are calibrated and time-synchronized with the GPS/IMU to provide <b>direct</b> <b>georeferenced</b> stereo vision, while a video camera is used for navigation.

Here, we present an approach that, for the first time, specifically accounts for the spatially variable precision inherent to photo-based surveys, and enables confidence-bounded quantification of 3 -D topographic change. The method uses novel 3 -D precision maps that describe the 3 -D photogrammetric and georeferencing uncertainty, and determines change through an adapted state-of-the-art fully 3 -D point-cloud comparison (M 3 C 2; Lague, et al., 2013), which is particularly valuable for complex topography. We introduce this method by: (1) using simulated UAV surveys, processed in photogrammetric software, to illustrate the spatial variability of precision and the relative influences of photogrammetric (e. g. image network geometry, tie point quality) and georeferencing (e. g. control measurement) considerations; (2) we then present a new Monte Carlo procedure for deriving this information using standard SfM software and integrate it into confidence-bounded change detection; before (3) demonstrating geomorphological application in which we use benchmark TLS data for validation and then estimate sediment budgets through differencing annual SfM surveys of an eroding badland.

This paper will present results from the imaging data flown at 6 different flight days over a test site in Germany during a 10 week time window starting in July till mid-September 2008. The two sensors were flown at two different flying heights, resulting in blocks with the same ground sampling distance (GSD); namely GSD = 8 cm. The results of <b>Direct</b> <b>Georeferencing</b> from real trials using a traditional Zeiss RMK TOP 15 film frame camera and Z/I Imaging large format digital camera DMC will be presented. These cameras are fitted with an Applanix POS AV 510, GPS, IMU integrated system. In this paper, the quality of <b>Direct</b> <b>Georeferencing</b> for digital cameras and film cameras is assessed through the coordinates of independent measurement of check points. A traditional triangulation (AT) with ground control points will be performed to be used as a ‘benchmark result ’ against which other results from direc...|$|E
40|$|The Position and Orientation System for <b>Direct</b> <b>Georeferencing</b> (POS/DG) is an {{off-the-shelf}} integrated GPS/inertial {{system designed}} specifically for airborne applications. It performs high quality measurements of position and orientation of an airborne sensor. Using an Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU) as the primary sensor, POS/DG achieves measurement accuracies of about 10 to 20 cm (RMS) in position and 20 to 30 arc seconds (RMS) in attitude. POS/DG is used with airborne sensors requiring high-accuracy attitude measurements such as aerial cameras, multispectral scanners, laser scanners and digital cameras. For aerial cameras, POS/DG's performance enables the <b>direct</b> <b>georeferencing</b> of aerial photos to about 20 microns without aerial triangulation and ground control. The elimination of the aerotriangulation process translates to large savings in post-processing, data turn-around and flying time. The application of POS/DG to airborne photogrammetry is discussed and flight test results are [...] ...|$|E
40|$|Within {{the last}} five years {{extensive}} research was done using integrated GPS/inertial systems for the <b>direct</b> <b>georeferencing</b> of airborne sensors for high-end applications. Pushed by the development and practical use of digital sensor systems, originally started with laser scanner systems and followed by imaging multi-line pushbroom scanners, <b>direct</b> <b>georeferencing</b> offers the only way for an efficient sensor orientation process. Nonetheless, even for standard frame based camera systems, digital or analogue, the use of direct orientation measurements is useful in especially in – from a photogrammetric point of view – unfavourable applications like corridor surveys or single model orientation. In the ideal case using direct exterior orientation elements with sufficient accuracy image orientation without any ground control is possible. Within this paper the basic principles of GPS/inertial systems and integration are summed up and the use of integrated systems in airborne environments is discussed, where the main emphasis is laid on the combination with standard analogue frame cameras. The empirical results of different well controlled test flights are used to illustrate the today's performance of <b>direct</b> <b>georeferencing</b> based on high-end integrated systems. Additionally, a combined GPS/inertial-AT or integrated sensor orientation approach is presented which allows the in-situ calibration of certain system parameters even without ground control and therefore provides highest flexibility to overcome the most limiting factor of direct georeferencing: uncorrected errors in the overall system calibration. Finally, the use of directly measured exterior orientations in model orientation and DEM generation is investigated. 1...|$|E

40|$|In this paper, the Digital Sensor System (DSS) {{test results}} and {{analysis}} are presented. The DSS is a fully integrated fully digital ruggedized system for airborne image acquisition, georeferencing, and map production. The DSS {{consists of a}} 4 K x 4 K digital camera, a GPS-aided INS <b>direct</b> <b>georeferencing</b> system, and a flight management system. The DSS software suite interfaces seamlessly with commercial off-the-shelf photogrammetric software to allow for fast topographic and ortho map production. The DSS currently uses a CCD chip with a 9 µm pixel size which allows digital image acquisition with a Ground Sample Distance that ranges from 0. 05 m to 1. 0 m using its 35 mm and 55 mm lenses. The embedded POS AV <b>direct</b> <b>georeferencing</b> system provides the exterior orientation parameters in both real-time and post-mission modes.

40|$|Unlike mobile survey systems, {{stationary}} survey {{systems are}} given very little <b>direct</b> <b>georeferencing</b> attention. <b>Direct</b> <b>Georeferencing</b> {{is currently being}} used in several mobile applications, especially in terrestrial and airborne LiDAR systems. Georeferencing of stationary terrestrial LiDAR scanning data, however, is currently performed indirectly through using control points in the scanning site. The indirect georeferencing procedure is often troublesome; the availability of control stations within the scanning range is not always possible. Also, field procedure can be laborious and involve extra equipment and target setups. In addition, the conventional method allows for possible human error due to target information bookkeeping. Additionally, the accuracy of this procedure varies according {{to the quality of}} the control used. By adding a dual GPS antenna apparatus to the scanner setup, thereby supplanting the use of multiple ground control points scattered throughout the scanning site, we mitigate not only the problems associated with indirect georeferencing but also induce a more efficient set up procedure while maintaining sufficient precision. In this paper, we describe a new method for determining the 3 D absolute orientation of LiDAR point cloud using GPS measurements from two antennae firmly mounted on the optical head of a stationary LiDAR system. In this paper, the general case is derived where the orientation angles are not small; this case completes the theory of stationary LiDAR <b>direct</b> <b>georeferencing.</b> Simulation and real world field experimentation of the prototype implementation suggest a precision of about 0. 05 degrees (~ 1 milli-radian) for the three orientation angles...|$|E
