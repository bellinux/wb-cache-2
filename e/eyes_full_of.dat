500|$|McCain {{spent six}} weeks in the hospital, {{receiving}} marginal care in a dirty, wet environment. [...] A prolonged attempt to set the fractures on his right arm, done without anesthetic, was unsuccessful; he received an operation on his broken leg but no treatment for his broken left arm. [...] He was temporarily taken to a clean room and interviewed by a French journalist, François Chalais, whose report was carried on the French television program Panorama in January 1968 {{and later in the}} U.S. on the CBS Evening News. [...] The film footage of McCain lying in the bed, in a cast, smoking cigarettes and speaking haltingly, would {{become one of the most}} widely distributed images of McCain's imprisonment. [...] McCain was observed by a variety of North Vietnamese, including renowned Vietnamese writer Nguyễn Tuân and Defense Minister and Army commander-in-chief General Võ Nguyên Giáp. [...] Many of the North Vietnamese observers assumed that McCain must be part of America's political-military-economic elite. [...] Now having lost fifty pounds (twenty-three kilograms), in a chest cast, covered in grime and <b>eyes</b> <b>full</b> <b>of</b> fever, and with his hair turned white, in early December 1967 McCain was sent to a prisoner-of-war camp on the outskirts of Hanoi nicknamed [...] "the Plantation". He was placed in a cell with George [...] "Bud" [...] Day, a badly injured and tortured Air Force pilot (later awarded the Medal of Honor) and Norris Overly, another Air Force pilot; they did not expect McCain to live another week. Overly, and subsequently Day, nursed McCain and kept him alive; Day later recalled that McCain had [...] "a fantastic will to live".|$|E

2500|$|Haussmann's {{renovation}} of Paris had many critics during his own time. [...] Some were simply {{tired of the}} continuous construction. [...] The French historian Léon Halévy wrote in 1867, [...] "the work of Monsieur Haussmann is incomparable. [...] Everyone agrees. Paris is a marvel, and M. Haussmann has done in fifteen years what a century could not have done. But that's enough for the moment. There will be a 20th century. Let's leave something for them to do." [...] Others regretted that he had destroyed a historic part of the city. The brothers Goncourt condemned the avenues that cut at right angles {{through the center of}} the old city, [...] where [...] "one could no longer feel in the world of Balzac." [...] Jules Ferry, the most vocal critic of Haussmann in the French parliament, wrote: [...] "We weep with our <b>eyes</b> <b>full</b> <b>of</b> tears for the old Paris, the Paris of Voltaire, of Desmoulins, the Paris of 1830 and 1848, [...] when we see the grand and intolerable new buildings, the costly confusion, the triumphant vulgarity, the awful materialism, that we are going to pass on to our descendants." ...|$|E
