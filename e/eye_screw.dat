50|$|A cabin hook is a {{hooked bar}} that engages into a staple. The bar is usually {{attached}} permanently to a ring or staple that is fixed with screws or nails to woodwork or a {{wall at the}} same level as the <b>eye</b> <b>screw.</b> The <b>eye</b> <b>screw</b> is usually screwed into the adjacent wall or onto the door itself. Used to hold a cupboard, door or gate open or shut.|$|E
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{determine}} the rebound characteristics of wooden baseball bats and aluminum baseball bats. Prior to testing, the point of percussion was determined. The bat being tested was suspended by a string that was attached to a small <b>eye</b> <b>screw</b> placed into the end of the knob of the bat. The string attached to the end of the bat was then secured to a point above an open doorway. The bat was placed into a side-by-side swinging motion from a fixed position. Ten completed swings (from the fixed position back to the fixed position) were timed with a stop watch. This swinging and timing process was repeated inch wooden,. 98 kilograms; 33 inch aluminum,. 90 kilograms; 34 inch wooden,. 95 kilograms; and 34 inch aluminum,. 89 kilograms) was tested by dropping baseballs from a distance of approximately 170 centimeters above the bat onto the point of percussion. The baseballs were placed in a clamping devise that was located over a circular hole in a piece of wood. The handle of the clamping devise was pulled and the baseball was released. Three baseballs were dropped on each bat, and the rebound distance was measured by a Locam camera. The velocity of the ball before and after contact was measured. An accelerometer was also used to determine the vibration effects of a baseball hitting a bat from a low elevation (an accelerometer is very delicate). The accelerometer was placed under the barrel of the bat. Three baseballs were dropped (using the same clamping devise) on each bat from a distance of approximately nine centimeters above the bat. The vibration effects were measured electronically. An analysis of variance was computed between the velocities of the baseballs as they approached and then rebounded off the baseball bats. The data revealed there were no significant differences between the drop velocities. However, there were significant differences between the up velocities (velocity of the ball after it rebounded off of the bat). There were significant differences between the velocities of the: aluminum 34 vs wooden 34, aluminum 34 vs aluminum 33, and aluminum 34 vs wooden 33. School of Physical EducationThesis (M. A. ...|$|E

Then I saw him turn a sickly leaden hue. He stared at the officer a moment and then at Giuliana. But I do not think that he saw either of them.

5000|$|Espalier {{plants on}} solid walls are usually {{installed}} six to twelve {{inches from the}} base of that wall, to allow space below ground for roots to grow in all directions as well as space above ground for good air circulation and pest control. [...] Supports for wire guides, which are generally necessary to train an espalier into a design, are installed first, directly into a wall constructed of suitable material. [...] Masonry walls are ideal for placing U-bolts, eye bolts, or <b>eye</b> <b>screws,</b> anchored with either plastic plugs or expandable lead shields, directly into the mortar joints. [...] Wooden walls may be better fitted with galvanized nipples, using turnbuckles for adjustment of the wire tautness.|$|R
60|$|Something {{seemed to}} affect his imagination, for {{he put his}} fingers to his ears and shut his <b>eyes,</b> <b>screwing</b> them up tightly just as a small boy does when his face is being soaped. There was {{something}} pathetic in it that touched me. It also gave me a lesson, for it seemed that before me was a child, only a child, though the features were worn, and the stubble on the jaws was white. It was evident that he was undergoing some process of mental disturbance, and knowing how his past moods had interpreted things seemingly foreign to himself, I thought I would enter into his mind as well as I could and go with him.|$|R

Ginger and Peter was both fast asleep, with their <b>eyes</b> <b>screwed</b> up and their mouths wide open, and 'e sat on the bed and looked at the locket until he was a'most dazzled.|$|R

6000|$|They {{made their}} camp {{for two nights}} with these {{friendly}} people. They are as dull and stupid in most {{things as they are}} artful at fishing. But they are, beyond even the Munza-mulgars, mischievous mimics. Even the little ones would come mincing and peeping with wisps of moss and grass stuck on their faces for eyebrows and whiskers, their long tails cocked over their shoulders, their <b>eyes</b> <b>screwed</b> up, in imitation of the Men of the Mountains. Lank old Thimble laughed himself hoarse at these children. At night they beat little wood drums of different notes round their fires, making a sort of wearisome harmony. They also play at many sports--"Fish in the Ring," [...] "A tail, a tail, a tail!" [...] and [...] "Here sups Sullilulli." [...] But I will not describe them, for they are just such games as are played all the world over by Oomgar and Mulgar alike. They are all, however, young and old, hale and paralysed, incorrigible thieves and gluttons, and rarely comb themselves.|$|R
60|$|But we {{get past}} even this, {{and come to}} the road itself, which is a series of {{alternate}} swamps and gravel-pits. A tremendous place is close before us, the black driver rolls his <b>eyes,</b> <b>screws</b> his mouth up very round, and looks straight between the two leaders, as if he were saying to himself, 'We have done this often before, but NOW I think we shall have a crash.' He takes a rein in each hand; jerks and pulls at both; and dances on the splashboard with both feet (keeping his seat, of course) like the late lamented Ducrow on two of his fiery coursers. We come to the spot, sink down in the mire nearly to the coach windows, tilt on one side at an angle of forty- five degrees, and stick there. The insides scream dismally; the coach stops; the horses flounder; all the other six coaches stop; and their four-and-twenty horses flounder likewise: but merely for company, and in sympathy with ours. Then the following circumstances occur.|$|R

50|$|Gord became {{involved}} in the film industry in Toronto, Ontario in the early 1970s. He produced the ultra-low budget Dream On The Run in 1973 and was production manager on another no-budget Canadian feature Point of No Return. In 1977, he produced the low-budget sci-fi film Starship Invasions, which was distributed by Warner Bros. and in 1979, The High Country for Crown International. He continued to production manage and/or line produce other low-budget films and television shows. Some examples include Deadly <b>Eyes,</b> Loose <b>Screws,</b> Recruits, Busted Up, Mr. Nice Guy, The Housekeeper, The Edison Twins and The Brain, through the 1980s.|$|R
60|$|From {{the upper}} balcony there was hanging head {{downwards}} a man clad {{in the bright}} blue coat and white breeches {{of one of the}} king's dragoons. His hat and wig had dropped off, and his close-cropped head swung slowly backwards and forwards a good fifty feet above the pavement. His face was turned towards the street, and was of a deadly whiteness, while his <b>eyes</b> were <b>screwed</b> up as though he dared not open them upon the horror which faced them. His voice, however, resounded over the whole place until the air was filled with his screams for mercy.|$|R
