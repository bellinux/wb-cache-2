5000|$|Studies {{that show}} more direct {{positive}} associations between religious practice {{and health and}} longevity are more controversial. Harold G. Koenig and Harvey J. Cohen summarized and assessed the results of 100 evidence-based studies that systematically {{examined the relationship between}} religion and human well-being, finding that 79% showed a positive influence. These studies are popular in the media, as seen in a recent NPR program including University of Miami Professor Gail Ironson's findings that belief in God and a strong sense of spirituality were good predictors of a lower viral load and improved immune cell levels in HIV patients. However, Dr. Richard P. Sloan of Columbia University was quoted in the New York Times as saying that [...] "...there is no really good compelling evidence that there is a relationship between religious involvement and health." [...] There is still debate over the validity of these findings, and they do not necessarily prove a direct cause-and-effect relationship between religion and <b>health.</b> <b>Mark</b> Stibich claims there is a clear correlation but the reason for it is unclear. A criticism of such placebo effects, as well as the advantage of religion giving a sense of meaning, is that it seems likely that less complex mechanisms than religious behavior could achieve such goals.|$|E

40|$|Measuring the {{behavior}} of dairy calves canpossiblylead to better understandings of the welfare, nutrition, {{and management of the}} calves. Behavioral monitoring systems based on accelerometer technology and proprietary algorithms for behavior categorization are commercially available for dairy cows. During this work, 12 calves (6 at a time) were fitted with an ear tag based behavior and temperature monitor (Cow Manager, Agis Automatisering, Netherlands) to evaluate behavior and ear temperature changes from birth through 90 days of age. To our knowledge, this is the first study to use this technology in calves. The study is still undergoing with data to be subsequently analyzed and interpreted. This paper shows a representative behavior graph of one calf as well as associated health and movement events during that calf’searly lifetime. The ear tag was very useful in monitoring animal movement and behavior over time, and reflected changes were seen during health, or normal large movement events (weaning, pen moves). Since the tag’s algorithms, behavioral activities, and alerts are based on adult cows and animals, some issues were seen which would need to be modified with new algorithms and behaviors to reflect calf behavior. Calf bottle feeding was categorized as rumination. The accelerometer movements are similar but categorization of {{the behavior}} associated with that movement is different in calves (nursing on bottles vs. rumination). Also, calves consistently showed up on the health alerts screens as their limited eating and high inactivity as young calves (normal activity) was seen and categorized as potentially sick animals. New algorithms and <b>health</b> <b>mark</b> benchmarks and parameters must be established based on calf behaviors...|$|E
40|$|The aim of {{the thesis}} was to give a {{comprehensive}} review of literature dealing with legislative measures, milk production in terms of sales of milk and its storage. We used the most current Czech and European legislation. These sources have been supplemented thematically compliant scientific and professional publications. Milk is a primary since the Middle Ages and sought food which people consume every day. Along with dairy milk a deserved popularity mainly due to its rich composition and nutritional and health properties. The main components of milk include water, lactose, fat, protein and minerals. Milk however can also include foreign substances of organic and inorganic origin and unwanted microflora. Microorganisms are particularly dangerous to humans and are considered a major source of foodborne illnesses. To eliminate unwanted microflora, extending shelf life and maintain public safety is used heat treatment, including pasteurization and treatment of very high temperature (UHT). This treatment must be carried out according to established requirements and specifications. If a consumer buys a dairy product in the Czech Republic retains its quality as well. All animal products, including products imported to the Czech market, are compulsorily fitted with oval <b>health</b> <b>mark,</b> which ensures wholesomeness. The quality of the milk is influenced by many factors, most of which are closely linked, and therefore not always easy to identify the specific cause possible reduction in quality standards. Already during the production process, emphasis is put on prevention in the field of quality and safety. Security is guaranteed by a system of determining critical control points HACCP, which is in the Czech Republic and the EU compulsory by law. Among the optional systems include ISO. Most enterprises with good reputation has introduced both these systems. Simultaneous application of HACCP and ISO standards provides a guarantee for the security of the overall quality and safety of products. This connection is known as TQM system. The main indicators of quality of raw milk are total number of mesophilic microorganisms, somatic cell count, fat content, crude protein residues of inhibiting substances, the average herd size and the number of bred cows. The milk must not contain any preservatives or stabilizers. Meeting the requirements and quality criteria will be checked on the appropriate number of samples that are collected in enterprises producing milk, random checks. The basic quality criteria of raw milk, food business operators must ensure that: The content of microorganisms in 1 mL at 30 ° C must be < 100 000. It is found average values for two months for the collection of at least two samples per month. Somatic cells in 1 ml at 30 ° C must be < 400 000. It is obtained by moving the geometric mean for the three months, every month, evaluates at least one sample. Immediately before treating the milk must contain 1 ml 100, 000 at 30 ° C...|$|E
