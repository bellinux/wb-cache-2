5|$|The second {{conviction}} left Knight {{even worse}} off than before. The company {{he was working for}} before his second trial refused to re-employ him. <b>Jobless,</b> he engaged himself in community work in his church, Covenant Community Methodist Church, and often visited a pub in Boat Quay of which his wife was a partner. He faded quietly from public life.|$|E
5|$|Chambers' American {{football}} {{career was}} brought to a standstill when a stress fracture injury on his right foot ruled him out for the season. The situation worsened further when the NFL closed the European league on 29 June 2007 leaving Chambers <b>jobless.</b> He returned as a TV personality on reality television show Cirque de Celebrité in October but was unpopular with the public and subsequently voted off.|$|E
5|$|The {{economic}} {{growth has been}} driven by the expansion of services that have been growing consistently faster than other sectors. It is argued that the pattern of Indian development has been a specific one and that the country may be able to skip the intermediate industrialisation-led phase in the transformation of its economic structure. Serious concerns have been raised about the <b>jobless</b> nature of the {{economic growth}}.|$|E
5|$|The {{effects of}} the {{recession}} which began in 1893, and which continued through 1896, ruined many Americans. Contemporary estimates were an unemployment rate as high as 25%. The task of relieving the <b>jobless</b> fell to churches and other charities, {{as well as to}} labor unions. Farmers went bankrupt; their farms were sold to pay their debts. Some of the impoverished died of disease or starvation; others killed themselves.|$|E
5|$|Unemployment, {{especially}} among the young, and the depletion of both oil and underground water resources are major long-term economic problems. In 2008, the <b>jobless</b> figure was at 4%, with women over represented at 85% of the total. In 2007 Bahrain became the first Arab country to institute unemployment benefits {{as part of a}} series of labour reforms instigated under Minister of Labour, Dr. Majeed Al Alawi.|$|E
5|$|Blérancourt's {{traditional}} {{power structure}} was reshaped {{by the events}} of 1789. The notary Gellé, previously an undisputed town leader, was challenged by a group of reformists who were led by several of Saint-Just's friends, including the husband of his sister Louise. Their attempts were not successful until 1790 when Blérancourt held its first open municipal elections. Mandated by the National Constituent Assembly, the new electoral structure allowed Saint-Just's friends to assume authority in the village as mayor, secretary, and, in the case of his brother-in-law, head of the local National Guard. The <b>jobless</b> Saint-Just, despite not meeting the legal age and tax qualifications, was allowed to join the Guard.|$|E
5|$|Christy {{could have}} {{graduated}} in 1940, {{but could not}} then be a teaching assistant, and this would have left him <b>jobless</b> and without income. In 1941, Oppenheimer found him a post at the physics department at Illinois Institute of Technology (IIT). In May 1941, he married Dagmar von Lieven. They had two sons: Thomas Edward (Ted), born in 1944, and Peter Robert, born in 1946. IIT paid Christy $200 per month to teach 27 hours per week for 11 months per annum. To keep abreast of developments in physics, he attended seminars at the University of Chicago. This {{brought him to the}} attention of Eugene Wigner, who hired him for the same money that IIT was paying him as a full-time research assistant, commencing in January 1942.|$|E
5|$|Macdonald's {{more than}} 15 years as premier brought {{fundamental}} changes. Under his leadership, the Nova Scotia government {{spent more than}} $100million paving roads, building bridges, extending electrical transmission lines and improving public education. Macdonald dealt with the mass unemployment of the Great Depression by putting the <b>jobless</b> to work on highway projects. He felt direct government relief payments would weaken moral character, undermine self-respect and discourage personal initiative. However, he also faced the reality that the financially strapped Nova Scotia government {{could not afford to}} participate fully in federal relief programs that required matching contributions from the provinces.|$|E
5|$|As {{leader of}} the Moderate Party, Reinfeldt tended to be less {{forceful}} in his criticism of the Swedish welfare state than his predecessors. He instead proposed reforms to Sweden's welfare state, which included cutting taxes for the lowest income earners and reducing unemployment benefits, {{in order to encourage}} the <b>jobless</b> to return to work. He toned down calls within the party for dismantling large portions of the Swedish welfare state, stating that change must come gradually from the bottom up and not be dictated from the top down. His goal was said to be to fine-tune the welfare state, by focusing on getting people off welfare benefits and into employment. He worked to shift the conservatives toward the middle ground by convincing voters that he would fix rather than dismantle the public welfare system.|$|E
5|$|From {{early in}} his career, Wałęsa was {{interested}} in workers' concerns; in 1968 he encouraged shipyard colleagues to boycott official rallies that condemned recent student strikes. He was a charismatic leader, who helped organize the illegal 1970 protests at the Gdańsk Shipyard when workers protested the government's decree raising food prices and he was considered for the position of chairman of the strike committee. The strikes' outcome, which involved the deaths of over 30 workers, galvanized Wałęsa's views {{on the need for}} change. In June 1976, Wałęsa lost his job at the Gdańsk Shipyard because of his continued involvement in illegal unions, strikes, and a campaign to commemorate the victims of the 1970 protests. Afterwards he worked as an electrician for several other companies but his activism led to him continually being laid off and he was <b>jobless</b> for long periods. Wałęsa and his family were under constant surveillance by the Polish secret police; his home and workplace were always bugged. Over the next few years, he was arrested several times for participating in dissident activities.|$|E
5|$|In 1901 Muller {{travelled}} to the United States {{himself to}} mobilise support from President Theodore Roosevelt, especially {{on behalf of}} the women and children in the British concentration camps. He also held public lectures all around the country. While visiting Mexico, news reached Muller about the Peace of Vereeniging, making him <b>jobless.</b> Muller took the opportunity to turn his American journey into an expedition. On his return to the Netherlands in 1903 he published a book about it. In the {{years after the end of}} the South African War Muller maintained his interest in South Africa and the Afrikaners, both personally and professionally. In 1904 he supported the Steyn family when they were in Europe for the President's recovery of a debilitating illness. Until his death Muller was active for the Algemeen Nederlandsch Verbond and the Nederlandsche Zuid-Afrikaansche Vereeniging.|$|E
5|$|Orr {{has been}} known to be {{fiercely}} loyal to former Bruin personnel and teammates. When Derek Sanderson had alcohol and prescription drug-abuse problems and wound up penniless, Orr spent his own money to ensure that Sanderson successfully completed rehab. Decades later, Orr and Sanderson went into business together managing finances for hockey players. Orr also helped out Bruins trainer John (Frosty) Forristall, his roommate during his first years with the Bruins, who had just been fired from the Tampa Bay Lightning for alcoholism in 1994. Forristall's drinking put him on bad terms with his brother John, so he returned to Boston <b>jobless</b> and soon afterwards was diagnosed with brain cancer. Orr took Forristall into his home for a year until he {{died at the age of}} 51. Orr was a pallbearer at his funeral.|$|E
5|$|At {{eighteen}} he left grammar school, and {{was awarded}} a place at Trinity College, Carmarthen, with ambitions of becoming a teacher. He studied physical education, junior science and horticulture. He left Trinity {{in the summer of}} 1967, and took up a post as a physical education teacher at Monkton House School in Cardiff, a private school for boys between the ages of eight and sixteen. John moved to Cardiff and shared a house with several other rugby players, including former Llanelli team mate Gerald Davies. John quit his position at Monkton House when he toured South Africa in 1968 and never taught again. On his return from Africa, John moved back to his family home at Cefneithin. He spent six weeks unemployed and during this period he considered turning to professional rugby league, almost signing for St Helens R.F.C.. Following an interview with David Coleman for the BBC programme, Sportsnight, in which his <b>jobless</b> situation was discussed, John was offered a job working for Forward Trust, a finance company in Cardiff. When John quit playing rugby in 1972 he also left his job as a finance representative, signing a contract to write a weekly column and cover important matches for the Daily Express. He was also signed to take part in sport programmes presented by HTV, the Wales and West of England commercial television company.|$|E
5|$|During {{his first}} term in parliament, Playford also gained {{attention}} for his unconvincing command of the English language; he developed a reputation for pronouncing common words incorrectly, bad syntax and speaking in a monotone. He continued to attack his ministers, and complaints {{from the likes of}} Public Works Minister Herbert Hudd only encouraged Playford to further mock him. Playford also consistently opposed the liberalisation of liquor trading, having been unimpressed by the drunken behaviour he had witnessed while in the military. He continued to stridently support economic rationalism, something he would later renege on as premier. He opposed government investment in capital works as a means of generating employment and stimulating the economy during the Depression, and called for a decrease in dairy production within the state on the basis that it was more efficient to import from interstate, where rainfall was higher and grazing was more effective. Playford further criticised government subsidies to work farms designed to alleviate unemployment among Indigenous Australians, claiming that the cost exceeded that of the standard <b>jobless</b> payment. He also endorsed the privatisation of unprofitable state railways and denounced tariff protection as rewarding inefficiency and non-innovation. In 1936, Playford defied his party by voting against the formation of the South Australian Housing Trust. Nevertheless, despite his refusal to toe the party line, Playford was well regarded for his studious attitude to research and his preparation of his speeches.|$|E
5|$|Harvey {{returned}} to politics after the 1929 {{stock market crash}} {{and the beginning of}} the Great Depression. He decided to run for the presidency. He formed the Liberty Party and held their national convention at Monte Ne. It was the only presidential convention ever held in Arkansas. Harvey prepared with railroad excursion rates, media facilities, upgraded roads, and food concessions, anticipating 10,000 delegates. He tented the amphitheater, set up seating, and installed an amplifier system to reach the thousands to be seated outside. Delegates were only eligible to attend if they certified they had read and agreed with the principles of Harvey's newest book The Book, which dealt with the harmful effects of usury by the government. In the end only 786 delegates attended, and Harvey was the only candidate the delegates could agree on. They nominated Andrae Nordskog of Los Angeles for vice president. The Liberty Party ended up merging with the <b>Jobless</b> Party, and Harvey ran for president as an independent; however, he is usually incorrectly credited as being their candidate in that election. Regardless, Franklin Delano Roosevelt won the 1932 presidential election, and Harvey only drew 800 votes.|$|E
25|$|Under Brennan, the Nixon {{administration}} {{supported and}} Congress passed legislation which protected worker pensions, expanded the workplace {{rights of the}} disabled, improved enforcement of {{occupational safety and health}} laws, and improved benefits for workers left <b>jobless</b> by changes in international trade.|$|E
25|$|The chronic {{decline in}} the {{fisheries}} gained new urgency {{with the onset of}} the Great Depression. Mines closed and thousands of miners were thrown out of work. Out-migration slowed, but for all the wrong reasons. Many <b>jobless</b> emigrants returned home.|$|E
25|$|As of April 2012, {{unemployment}} in the Burbank area stood at 8.4%, representing a decline from March levels and below the state's <b>jobless</b> rate of 10.9%, according to the California Employment Development Department. Back in January 2011, the unemployment rate in Burbank had reached 10.7%, according to EDD.|$|E
25|$|More than 40 {{business}} premises, 300 residential properties, the City Hall and Carnegie Library {{were destroyed}} by the fire. Over £3million worth of damage (equivalent to €172million today) was wrought. 2,000 were left <b>jobless</b> and many more became homeless. Two unarmed IRA volunteers were shot dead {{in the north of}} the city.|$|E
25|$|A dozen {{companies}} were already providing felt for Albany's paper mills {{in the early}} 1890s when one of them, the Albany Huyck felt mill, burned down in 1894. This left its talented superintendent, Duncan Fuller, who had patented a new weaving method, <b>jobless.</b> He was soon re-employed by the three founding partners of the newly formed Albany Felt Company.|$|E
25|$|In 2009 The Local and Der Spiegel {{reported}} that a new study reveals Turks in Germany lag behind other migrant groups {{when it comes to}} education and jobs. Immigrants of Turkish origin were also found to be the least successful in the labour market: 30 percent did not finish school, many were often <b>jobless,</b> the percentage of housewives was high and many were dependent on welfare.|$|E
25|$|In October 2001 {{residents}} of the Zandspruit informal settlement gave Zimbabweans 10 days to leave the area. When the foreigners failed to leave voluntarily they were forcefully evicted and their shacks were burned down and looted. Community members said they were angry that Zimbabweans were employed while locals remained <b>jobless</b> and blamed the foreigners {{for a number of}} crimes. No injuries were reported among the Zimbabweans.|$|E
25|$|Egypt's high {{fertility}} rate {{gives rise to}} significant socioeconomic burdens - economic development is delayed and there is reduced access to jobs and education. Fertility rates have declined since the 1960s but are still high and Egypt's population grew from 44 million in 1981 to more than 92 million today. Egypt's youth experience massive unemployment, with an estimated 7.7 million youths (aged 15–24) <b>jobless</b> in 2010.|$|E

Unemployment reached an all-time high of 15% in 2010, second in the nation only to Detroit among metropolitan areas with populations over 1 million.|$|E
25|$|In 2009 through 2013, {{following}} the Great Recession, the emerging problem of <b>jobless</b> recoveries resulted in record levels of long-term unemployment with over 6 million workers {{looking for work}} longer than 6 months as of January 2010. This particularly affected older workers. In the year {{following the}} recession's end in June 2009 in the United States, immigrants gained 656,000 jobs, while U.S.-born workers lost {{more than a million}} jobs.|$|E
25|$|Reginald Marsh (March 14, 1898July 3, 1954) was an American painter, born in Paris, {{most notable}} for his depictions {{of life in}} New York City in the 1920s and 1930s. Crowded Coney Island beach scenes, popular {{entertainments}} such as vaudeville and burlesque, women, and <b>jobless</b> men on the Bowery are subjects that reappear throughout his work. He painted in egg tempera and in oils, and produced many watercolors, ink and ink wash drawings, and prints.|$|E
25|$|The {{issue of}} a subway {{remained}} present in the newspapers but World War I and the following recession hitting Montreal prevented any execution. The gradual return of the financial health during the 1920s brought the MTC project back and attracted support from the Premier of Quebec. The Great Depression, indebting Montreal again and atrophying its streetcars attendance, overcame this new attempt and the next devised by Mayor Camillien Houde in 1939 {{as a way to}} provide work for the <b>jobless</b> masses.|$|E
25|$|In April 2010, the {{official}} unemployment rate was 9.9%, but the government's broader U-6 unemployment rate was 17.1%. In {{the period between}} February 2008 and February 2010, {{the number of people}} working part-time for economic reasons has increased by 4 million to 8.8million, an 83% increase in part-time workers during the two-year period. By 2013, although the unemployment rate had fallen below 8%, the record proportion of long term unemployed and continued decreasing household income remained indicative of a <b>jobless</b> recovery.|$|E
25|$|At {{the end of}} the 2nd century BC, Gaius Marius {{reformed}} {{the previously}} ephemeral legions as a professional force drawing from the poorest classes, enabling Rome to field larger armies and providing employment for <b>jobless</b> citizens of the city of Rome. However, this put the loyalty of the soldiers in the hands of their general rather than the State of Rome itself. This development ultimately enabled Julius Caesar to cross the Rubicon with an army loyal to him personally and effectively end the Republic.|$|E
25|$|Carmel {{is first}} seen in Walford in June 1986 {{when she is}} {{assigned}} as Michelle Fowler's (Susan Tully) health visitor. West Indian by origin, British by education, Carmel is unmistakable with her long dreadlocks and colourful clothing. Carmel is kept extremely busy in Walford as she has all the difficult cases - Mary Smith (Linda Davidson), a prostitute, whose baby, Annie, has been removed; Sue Osman (Sandy Ratcliff), a mentally unstable mother who is obsessed with her baby, Ali's, welfare; Donna Ludlow (Matilda Ziegler), a self-destructing heroin addict, and <b>jobless</b> Arthur Fowler (Bill Treacher), among others.|$|E
25|$|One {{effect of}} the {{financial}} crisis is an increase in support for independence in Catalonia. The Statute of Autonomy included a package of laws that gave more power to the region and would have recognized Catalonia as a nation, although one still within Spain. As with the rest of Spain, Catalonia has had high levels of unemployment. As many as 22% of the economically active population, which is still lower than Spain's national <b>jobless</b> rate, yet higher than Madrid. In 2010, Spain's Constitutional Court weakened the Statute of Autonomy for Catalonia, which further irritated Catalan secessionist organization.|$|E
25|$|The rapid {{resurgence}} {{of growth and}} the improvement {{in the balance of}} payments were insufficient to overcome unemployment and inflation, which remained serious problems. The official <b>jobless</b> rate fell from 15 percent in 1979 to 11 percent in 1980, but, partly because of the rapid growth of the labor force, unemployment rose again, to 13 percent in 1985. Inflation fell to about 25 percent in the 1981–82 period, but it climbed again, to more than 30 percent in 1983 and more than 40 percent in 1984. Although inflation eased somewhat in 1985 and 1986, it remained one of the primary problems facing economic policy makers.|$|E
25|$|John Berryman {{was born}} John Allyn Smith, Jr. in Oklahoma {{where he was}} raised {{until the age of}} ten, when his father, John Smith, a banker, and his mother, Martha (also known as Peggy), a schoolteacher, moved to Tampa, Florida. In 1926, in Florida, when the poet was eleven years old, his father shot and killed himself. Smith was <b>jobless</b> at the time, and he and Martha were both filing for divorce.
