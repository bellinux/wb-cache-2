2500|$|.....God... {{called you}} to weep and mourn. <b>He</b> <b>told</b> <b>you</b> to shave your heads in sorrow for your sins- ...|$|E
6000|$|... "If <b>he</b> <b>told</b> <b>you</b> that I was {{any thing}} {{but a single}} woman--if <b>he</b> <b>told</b> <b>you</b> that Arnold Brinkworth was married to any body but Miss Lundie of Windygates--I say again he lied!" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Your expectation, be it ever so ominous, {{shall be}} fully satisfied. That Bulmer, when <b>he</b> <b>told</b> <b>you</b> that a secret {{marriage}} {{was necessary to}} Miss Mowbray's honour, {{thought that he was}} imposing on you.--But <b>he</b> <b>told</b> <b>you</b> a fatal truth, so far as concerned Clara. She had indeed fallen, but Bulmer was not her seducer--knew nothing of the truth of what he so strongly asseverated." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "If <b>he</b> has <b>told</b> <b>you</b> that, <b>he</b> has <b>told</b> <b>you</b> {{more than}} the truth! I am a patriot. The rest my modesty compels me to disavow." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Sir Thomas knows {{very well}} what I've come about," [...] he began, slowly; [...] "and if <b>he's</b> <b>told</b> <b>you,</b> why you know too; {{and in that}} case--." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Make your fortune going {{round the}} suburbs," [...] assured him Jarman. [...] "Pity you weren't 'ere last night," [...] he continued; [...] "might 'ave saved our young friend 'ere a deal of trouble. Has <b>'e</b> <b>told</b> <b>you</b> the news?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Precisely! I believe <b>he</b> <b>told</b> <b>you</b> {{in plain}} words that whoever possessed his model might, if they chose, {{dominate}} the world." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "But <b>he</b> <b>told</b> <b>you</b> {{that they}} would not pass," [...] said Rilla, seriously. She never laughed at Gertrude's dreams as the doctor did.|$|E
6000|$|Bill's brows lowered savagely as he muttered, [...] "Ay, he said {{truth when}} <b>he</b> <b>told</b> <b>you</b> {{he was a}} sandal-wood trader, but he lied when--" ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'True,' {{said the}} old man, faintly. 'Yes. But tell me again, Nell. My head fails me. What was it that <b>he</b> <b>told</b> <b>thee?</b> Nothing more than that he would see me to-morrow or next day? That was in the note.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "And <b>he</b> <b>told</b> <b>thee</b> that thou couldst {{make what}} {{promises}} thou wouldst {{to me as}} to the girl's life, but that afterwards when thou hadst called me here to claim it, thou mightest kill her or keep her as a wife, as it pleased thee." ...|$|R
6000|$|NICHOLLS (as an afterthought). And, honestly, Mr. Carmody, I don't {{see how you}} can object for a second--after <b>he's</b> <b>told</b> <b>you</b> it's {{absolutely}} necessary for Eileen to go away. (Seeing Carmody's shaken condition, he finishes boldly.) You've some feeling for your own daughter, haven't you? You'd be a fine father if you hadn't! ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Then I expect <b>he</b> <b>told</b> <b>you</b> {{where he}} went. It's {{possible}} that {{a study of the}} letters would give an experienced prospector a useful hint." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Has <b>he</b> <b>told</b> <b>you</b> his reason, Marian?" [...] asked Selina, {{as soon as}} the two {{ladies and}} their trains were safely {{disposed}} of, in the carriage.|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{thought it}} was Drummond," [...] said Sheen blankly. [...] "You {{remember}} meeting me outside his study the day after? I thought <b>he</b> <b>told</b> <b>you</b> then." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Perhaps you don't,' {{said the}} visitor, hesitating--'perhaps you don't know my story? Perhaps <b>he</b> never <b>told</b> <b>you</b> my story?' ...|$|R
60|$|FANNY. <b>He</b> never <b>told</b> <b>you</b> ANYTHING--for {{the matter}} of that. I {{understood}} you had found out everything for yourself.|$|R
60|$|BRASSBOUND. Has <b>he</b> never <b>told</b> <b>you</b> {{about my}} mother? this fellow who puts on ermine and scarlet and calls himself Justice.|$|R
6000|$|... "Jupiter, I {{should like}} to {{understand}} what it is you are talking about. You say your master is sick. Hasn't <b>he</b> <b>told</b> <b>you</b> what ails him?" ...|$|E
6000|$|MISS SPAULDING: [...] "But, Ethel, {{you don't}} mean {{to make him}} take money for the lessons he gave you after <b>he</b> <b>told</b> <b>you</b> you couldn't learn anything?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes. How did {{you know}} that?" [...] he asked quickly. [...] "Ah, I beg your pardon; <b>he</b> <b>told</b> <b>you,</b> of course. You will find him a {{faithful}} servant." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Well, <b>he</b> hasn't <b>told</b> <b>you</b> many lies. It's {{really a}} creditably clear and {{consistent}} {{account of what}} happened, with everything of importance left out." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'If <b>he</b> has <b>told</b> <b>you</b> that, Lady Jedburgh, I shall {{certainly}} {{take him}} away. Come over at once, Mr. Podgers, and read Lord Arthur's hand.' ...|$|R
50|$|Silver's {{latest project}} (co-authored with Martin O'Connor) is a {{relationship}} book titled Everything <b>He</b> Hasn't <b>Told</b> <b>You</b> Yet: A New Way to Get Men talking About Stuff That Matters. The book uses the Scenario Method which works by putting {{a man at the}} centre of hypothetical situations thus allowing him to share what he really thinks and feels. Everything <b>He</b> Hasn't <b>Told</b> <b>You</b> Yet was released in the United States in October 2007. The book received a starred review in the Library Journal (US).|$|R
6000|$|... "That story <b>he</b> <b>told</b> <b>you</b> of his {{childhood}} and of how he became a priest; didn't it strike you at the time like rather a made-up, melodramatic history?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Nonsense! His attentions {{are nothing}} but {{distress}} to her! Sensible grown-up young women are not apt to be flattered by importunity from silly boys. Has <b>he</b> <b>told</b> <b>you</b> otherwise?' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "He {{told you}} to!" [...] she cried. [...] "It is no sense denying it, you said {{yourself}} {{that there was}} nothing farther from your thoughts. <b>He</b> <b>told</b> <b>you</b> to." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Coward?" [...] he echoed, in genuine surprise. [...] "'Twill be some {{lie that}} <b>he</b> has <b>told</b> <b>you</b> with the others. In what, pray, was I ever a coward?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "So, O Hes, already <b>he</b> has <b>told</b> <b>thee</b> all our secrets, {{though they}} be such as most men hide within their breasts;" [...] {{and she looked}} contemptuously at Leo.|$|R
6000|$|Violet Wayne nodded gravely. “Still, Godfrey Palliser {{sent you}} {{to school with}} Tony. You were always good friends, though I think <b>he</b> <b>told</b> me <b>you</b> were born abroad?” ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Well, I'll {{be glad to}} see {{him when}} he comes." [...] Her voice grew graver. [...] "I feel {{grateful}} to him already for what <b>he</b> <b>told</b> <b>you</b> about George." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Can't you see? They wouldn't {{have had}} his {{photograph}} unless {{he had been}} a friend of the family or a relative. I wonder whether <b>he</b> <b>told</b> <b>you</b> his real name?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "If {{only you}} had been ready at the time, as <b>he</b> <b>told</b> <b>you</b> to be, {{there would have been}} no delays, and you would have got away before any of this happened." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "He is safe," [...] {{answered}} Edgar; [...] "I {{found him}} exhausted in the hut which <b>he</b> <b>told</b> me <b>you</b> had occupied, {{and had him}} conveyed on board the gun-boat." ...|$|R
6000|$|As soon as {{he could}} be heard through the laughter, Harney raised his voice. [...] "It's true, as McCarthy tells, but <b>he's</b> only <b>told</b> <b>you</b> the half. Can't you guess the rest, Matt?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "With your permission, general, I will {{supplement}} the story a little. Mr. Brooke {{has told me}} somewhat more than <b>he</b> has <b>told</b> <b>you,</b> but I gained the whole facts from his guide's own lips." ...|$|R
