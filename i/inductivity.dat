40|$|Traditional {{protection}} concepts against electromagnetic interferences are {{combinations of}} nonlinear elements like spark gaps, varistors or suppressor diodes. Due to parasitic capacitances and <b>inductivities</b> {{and the general}} behavior of the elements, a trade off {{has to be made}} between the frequency bandwidth and the energy absorption capability of the protection circuit. For high frequency applications with signal frequencies above about 500 MHz a sufficient protection can not be given without changing the transmitted signals itself. Additionally this kind of protection concept is designed and optimized against transient interferences with rise times down to some nanoseconds, for example the LEMP, the NEMP or the ESD. Current researches focus on transient interferences with rise times in the picosecond range and pulse widths of a few nanoseconds, the so called ultra wideband (UWB) pulses, combined with a significant voltage amplitude of some kilovolts.

This problem finds many applications {{in the design of}} modern high power electronic devices. The construction of a subtle layout of the devices requires to avoid significant losses in the power transmission due to parasitic <b>inductivities.</b> We consider a minimization problem with an objective function related to the energy dissipation given by the Joule-Lenz law. Our purpose is to find the optimal material distribution in the conductive medium with a prescribed fluxes through the ports. The structural boundary of the design domain changes during the optimization process. A level-set method is proposed for an implicit representation of this boundary. The description includes the evolution of the scalar level-set function and thus, the optimal propagation of the design boundary by solving the Hamilton-Jacobi equation. Another approach to find the optimal material design is to consider the electromagnetic potentials as state variables and the conductivity as a design variable. This formulation gives rise to a nonlinear minimization problem which we solve by the primaldual approach. Some numerical experiments by using the second approach applied to a two-dimensional isotropic electromagnetic model are presented...|$|R

While the ℓ-modular local γ-factor we associate to such a pair turns out to always coincide with the reduction modulo ℓ of the ℓ-adic γ-factor of any Whittaker lifts of this pair, the local L-factor exhibits a more interesting behaviour; always dividing the reduction modulo-ℓ of the ℓ-adic L-factor of any Whittaker lifts, but {{with the possibility of}} a strict division occurring.
