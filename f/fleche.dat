5|$|La Fleche’s best runner was John O’Gaunt, who {{finished}} second in the Derby and sired Swynford. Her daughter Baroness La <b>Fleche</b> produced the 1000 Guineas winner Cinna, who produced the successful stallion Beau Pere. La <b>Fleche</b> was retired from breeding in 1911, and she died at Sledmere in late April 1916 at the age of twenty-seven.|$|E
5|$|On 7 September La <b>Fleche</b> {{ran in the}} St Leger on a wet day at Doncaster. Orme, who had {{returned}} from his problems to win the Eclipse Stakes started favourite, with La <b>Fleche,</b> ridden on this occasion by John Watts, strongly supported at 7/2. Watts settled the filly {{in the early stages}} as Orme set off in front. Just after the turn into the straight, La <b>Fleche,</b> travelling strongly, moved alongside her stable companion and then pulled clear. She won easily by two lengths from the fast-finishing Sir Hugo, with Orme fading into fifth. On 24 September, La <b>Fleche</b> ran against older and younger horses in the £10,000 Lancashire Plate over one mile at Manchester Racecourse. Ridden by Barrett, she tracked the leaders until the straight, where she accelerated impressively to win by three lengths from Orvieto, with Sir Hugo unplaced.|$|E
5|$|Before {{the start}} of the 1894 season, La <b>Fleche</b> was covered by the Gold Cup winner Morion, and raced in foal (pregnant) {{for the rest of the}} year.|$|E
5|$|In Autumn La <b>Fleche</b> {{attempted}} {{to win a}} second Manchester Plate, but finished third to the three-year-colts Raeburn, and Isinglass. The race had been expected to lie between La <b>Fleche</b> and Isinglass, and their respective jockeys focused their attentions on each other, allowing Raeburn to emerge almost unseen to take the race in the closing stages. For this race, La <b>Fleche</b> carried a weight of 154 pounds. On 25 October she found a weight of 133 pound too much when finishing unplaced in the Cambridgeshire. She won the Lowther Stakes at Newmarket in October. On 10 November she ran in the Liverpool Autumn Cup, carrying a weight of 132 pounds and won in impressive style by one and a quarter lengths from The Prisoner. Later in November, she was beaten under 137 pounds in the Manchester November Handicap.|$|E
5|$|Orme and La <b>Fleche</b> {{met again}} in the Gordon Stakes at Goodwood with two other opponents, Watercress and Royal Harry. Starting favourite, Orme had La <b>Fleche</b> in trouble {{with more than a}} quarter of a mile still to run. He seemed to have the race won, but then veered left forcing Morny Cannon to pull him back and {{allowing}} La <b>Fleche</b> to draw level. However Orme pulled away again and won by a neck, with Watercress a further six lengths back in third. Orme's final race came in the Limekiln Stakes where he had to carry 10 stone. He finished second to Childwick, who was receiving 33 pounds. During the autumn Orme's legs had started to give him trouble and during the Limekiln a suspensory ligament gave way. This injury brought an end to his racing career, and he was retired to stud. Throughout his racing career he won a total of £32,528 in prize money.|$|E
5|$|The {{team also}} sent squads to the Grand Prix d'Ouverture La Marseillaise, the Gran Premio della Costa Etruschi, the Trofeo Laigueglia, Omloop Het Nieuwsblad, Les Boucles du Sud Ardèche, Cholet-Pays de Loire, Dwars door Vlaanderen, the Route Adélie de Vitré, the inaugural <b>Flèche</b> d'Emeraude, the Scheldeprijs, the Grand Prix de Denain the Tour du Finistère, the Amstel Gold Race, La <b>Flèche</b> Wallonne, the Eschborn-Frankfurt City Loop, the Grand Prix of Aargau Canton, the Grand Prix de Plumelec-Morbihan, and Boucles de l'Aulne, but placed {{no higher than}} 12th {{in any of these}} races.|$|E
5|$|As noted above, La <b>Fleche</b> {{was already}} in foal when racing in 1894 and {{produced}} her first foal, a filly called La Veine in 1895. In 1896 Maurice de Hirsch died and all his bloodstock, including La <b>Fleche</b> and La Veine were put up for auction. She was sold for £12,600 to Marcus Beresford, acting on this occasion on behalf the Sykes family and was sent to their Sledmere Stud in Yorkshire. Sir Tatton Sykes, who was reportedly horrified by the price, initially refused to acknowledge the mare’s arrival, and left her in a railway box for two weeks before he was persuaded to accept the deal.|$|E
5|$|As was {{customary}} Collier {{received a}} promotion, to master and commander on 3 September 1799, and a command, the 18-gun sloop , on 21 October. Collier commanded the Victor {{for the next}} couple of years, escorting convoys and on one occasion a convoy of troop transports to the Red Sea, bringing troops to defeat the French forces in Egypt. He stopped briefly at Diego Garcia to take on supplies, whereupon he fell in with the 22-gun French corvette <b>Flèche.</b> The two ships fought a brief engagement on 1 September 1801, during which the <b>Flèche</b> damaged the Victors rigging and managed to escape. After repairing the damage, Collier searched the surrounding area before coming across his opponent on 5 September, sheltering in Mahé Roads. The channel was very narrow, and the wind unfavourable, but Collier managed to warp the Victor into the harbour, and with the aid of her staysails, closed on the French ship. After enduring raking fire for sometime, he was finally able to haul his ship around and the two vessels exchanged broadsides for over two hours. By then the <b>Flèche</b> was observed to be in a sinking condition, and her captain ran her aground. A party of men were sent over from the Victor, but having boarded the French vessel, found her crew had set her on fire and then abandoned ship. The men were temporarily evacuated while further assistance was sent across, after which they re-boarded and managed to extinguish the fire. Just as this had been achieved, the <b>Flèche</b> slipped off the reef into deeper water and sank.|$|E
5|$|Going {{into the}} 1892 season Orme {{was a strong}} {{favourite}} for the Epsom Derby, with odds as short as 2/1 in December. In March he was still favourite, but had drifted out slightly to 5/2 due to the support for stablemate La <b>Fleche.</b>|$|E
5|$|La <b>Fleche</b> {{was trained}} {{for her first}} two seasons by John Porter at Kingsclere. At {{the end of her}} three-year-old season she was moved to the Egerton House stable of Richard Marsh at Newmarket, Suffolk.|$|E
5|$|La Fleche's stable companion, Orme, was {{regarded}} as {{the best of the}} year's two-year-old colts, and there was speculation as to which of the two was the better. It was also generally believed that La <b>Fleche</b> would have the Derby as her principal target for the following year.|$|E
5|$|Two {{days after}} her defeat in the Derby, La <b>Fleche</b> ran against fillies in the Oaks. Although some {{regarded}} her as a certainty, her odds drifted from 2/5 to 8/11 before the start. In the race she tracked the leader Broad Corrie before taking {{the lead in the}} straight apparently poised for an easy victory. In the final furlong however, she was closely pressed by The Smew, a filly she had dealt with easily in the 1000 Guineas, and Barrett had to ride a vigorous finish to win the race by a short head. On 29 July at Goodwood, La <b>Fleche</b> won the Nassau Stakes in which, despite looking less than fully fit, she quickened impressively to bear Broad Corrie by a length and a half.|$|E
5|$|In late April {{there were}} reports that Orme had a sore throat. This caused Orme to drift in the betting for the Derby, and La <b>Fleche</b> became the favourite. Orme was {{withdrawn}} from the 2000 Guineas, but returned to doing gentle exercise and it was hoped that he would still {{be able to make the}} Derby. The Duke of Westminster hinted that he had been poisoned. In early May, Orme had still not improved, and connections stated that he had been poisoned with mercury. It was suspected that the culprit may have been a well-known backer of Derby rival La <b>Fleche,</b> with the poison being administered in a lozenge that Orme chewed, blistering his tongue. However, a dentist that removed part of a decayed tooth from Orme suggested that the illness was not due to poisoning, but to the decayed tooth.|$|E
5|$|La <b>Fleche</b> {{remained}} in {{training for a}} further two seasons, winning important races such as the 1893 Liverpool Autumn Cup, the 1894 Ascot Gold Cup, and the Champion Stakes on her final appearance. In all, she won sixteen times in twenty-four racecourse appearances. After her retirement from racing she became a successful and influential broodmare.|$|E
5|$|The {{team also}} sent squads to Omloop Het Nieuwsblad, Dwars door Vlaanderen, E3 Prijs Vlaanderen – Harelbeke, Gent–Wevelgem, the Route Adélie de Vitré, the Tour of Flanders, the <b>Flèche</b> d'Emeraude, the Scheldeprijs, Paris–Roubaix, Paris–Camembert, the Brabantse Pijl, the Grand Prix de Denain, and the Grand Prix de Plumelec-Morbihan, but {{finished}} {{no higher than}} 11th {{in any of these}} races.|$|E
5|$|The {{team also}} sent squads to the Omloop Het Nieuwsblad, Kuurne–Brussels–Kuurne, Le Samyn, the Nokere Koerse, the Handzame Classic, Milan – San Remo, the Cholet-Pays de Loire, E3 Prijs Vlaanderen – Harelbeke, Gent–Wevelgem, the Scheldeprijs, Paris–Roubaix, the Tro-Bro Léon, La <b>Flèche</b> Wallonne, the GP Herning, the Rund um Köln, the ProRace Berlin, and the Gullegem Koerse, but placed {{no higher than}} 12th {{in any of these}} races.|$|E
5|$|Although ancient Lapita potteries {{date back}} to 1500 BC, {{and the people of}} the island have long been {{involved}} in the arts, since the establishment of the ADCK, Kanak arts and crafts have become more popular in New Caledonia. Wooden carvings in the shape of hawks, ancient gods, serpents and turtles are popular as is <b>flèche</b> faîtière, a carving which resembles a small totem pole with symbolic shapes. Music, dance and singing are part of many a Kanak ceremonial function and dances are performed during the traditional Kanak gatherings with the objective of cementing relationships within the clan and with ancestors.|$|E
5|$|Despite not testing {{positive}} {{during the race}} or season, the Gewiss-Ballan team has since been speculated to have executed a systematic doping program that utilized EPO throughout the 1994 season. The team achieved several victories in stage races and one-day races during the year, including a sweep of the podium at La <b>Flèche</b> Wallonne weeks {{before the start of}} the Giro. Team doctor Michele Ferrari was banned for life from sports in 2012 by United States Anti-Doping Agency for distribution of performance-enhancing drugs to several of his clients.|$|E
5|$|He {{finished}} his two-year-old {{season with a}} record of five wins and a second place from six starts. At the end of the season, some even believed that he was better than his sire Ormonde, the 'horse of the century'. One writer rated him ten pounds superior to the next best two-year-old La <b>Fleche,</b> with her being one pound superior to Flyaway. Some were more cautious, however, suggesting that Orme had not beaten any top horses.|$|E
5|$|Her sire, St. Simon was an unbeaten racehorse who was {{beginning}} to prove himself as an outstanding sire. By the time La <b>Fleche</b> was sold in 1890 {{he was on the}} way to the first of his nine sires’ championships, having sired the first two of his ten Classic winners. Her dam, Quiver produced La Fleche’s full-sister Memoir, who won the Epsom Oaks and the St Leger as well as the influential broodmares Maid Marian and Satchel.|$|E
5|$|La <b>Fleche</b> (18891916) was a British Thoroughbred racehorse and broodmare. After {{being sold}} {{for a world}} record price as a {{yearling}} in 1890, she was undefeated as a two-year-old in 1891, winning races against her own sex and defeating some of the year's leading colts. She {{went on to become}} the dominant British three-year-old of 1892, claiming the Fillies’ Triple Crown by winning the 1000 Guineas at Newmarket, the Oaks at Epsom and the St Leger at Doncaster. Her only defeat of the year came when she was beaten when starting favourite for The Derby.|$|E
5|$|Lemoine {{was born}} in Quimper, Finistère, on 22 November 1840, {{the son of a}} retired {{military}} captain who had participated in the campaigns of the First French Empire occurring after 1807. As a child, he attended the military Prytanée of La <b>Flèche</b> on a scholarship granted because his father had helped found the school. During this early period, he published a journal article in Nouvelles annales de mathématiques, discussing properties of the triangle.|$|E
5|$|Recent {{editions of}} the race have been decided with attacks on the Mur de Huy. The {{addition}} of the Côte de Cherave, however, added an unknown factor into the race: it was considered {{much more likely than}} in previous years that a group of riders could break away from the peloton on the penultimate climb and hold an advantage to the finish line. No breakaway had won La <b>Flèche</b> Wallonne since 2003.|$|E
5|$|The {{team also}} sent squads to the Grand Prix d'Ouverture La Marseillaise, Omloop Het Nieuwsblad, Kuurne–Brussels–Kuurne, Le Samyn, De Vlaamse Pijl, the Handzame Classic, Dwars door Vlaanderen, E3 Prijs Vlaanderen – Harelbeke, Gent–Wevelgem, Hel van het Mergelland, Brabantse Pijl, the Grand Prix de Denain, the Tour du Finistère, the Amstel Gold Race, the Tro-Bro Léon, La <b>Flèche</b> Wallonne, Liège–Bastogne–Liège, the Eschborn-Frankfurt City Loop, Halle–Ingooigem, and the Internationale Wielertrofee Jong Maar Moedig, but placed {{outside of the}} top 10 {{in all of these}} races.|$|E
5|$|The {{team was}} not {{especially}} competitive at the spring season's monument classics, coming in 37th at Milan - San Remo, 19th at the Tour of Flanders, 29th at Paris–Roubaix, and 57th at Liège–Bastogne–Liège. The team also sent squads to the Trofeo Laigueglia, Omloop Het Nieuwsblad, Gran Premio di Lugano, Les Boucles du Sud Ardèche, Dwars door Vlaanderen, E3 Prijs Vlaanderen – Harelbeke, Gent-Wevelgem, Scheldeprijs, Paris–Camembert, the Grand Prix de Denain, the Amstel Gold Race, Tro-Bro Léon, La <b>Flèche</b> Wallonne, the Eschborn-Frankfurt City Loop, and the Tallinn-Tartu GP, but finished {{no higher than}} 12th {{in any of these}} races.|$|E
5|$|The team's {{two leaders}} Vinokourov and Kreuziger rode {{strongly}} at the Ardennes classics. Vinokourov took fourth in La <b>Flèche</b> Wallonne, six seconds back of winner Philippe Gilbert. Kreuziger was also fourth, {{at the fourth}} monument Liège–Bastogne–Liège, and also back of Gilbert as race winner. The team also sent squads to the E3 Prijs Vlaanderen – Harelbeke, Gent-Wevelgem, and the Amstel Gold Race, but finished distantly in each, 16th, 66th, and 17th respectively.|$|E
5|$|After four {{rounds of}} the 2015 UCI Women's Road World Cup, there had been four {{different}} winners; Jolien D'Hoore at the Ronde van Drenthe, Lizzie Armitstead at the Trofeo Alfredo Binda-Comune di Cittiglio, Elisa Longo Borghini at the Tour of Flanders, and Anna van der Breggen at the La <b>Flèche</b> Wallonne Féminine. Anna van der Breggen led the World Cup standings as the racing moved to China for the Tour of Chongming Island, with 290 points, but her Rabo-Liv team were not invited {{to take part in}} the event. Kirsten Wild won both the stage race and the World Cup event in 2014, and repeated her success in the 2015 stage race. She was the pre-race favourite to win the 2015 World Cup race on a course that favoured sprinters.|$|E
5|$|At {{the end of}} 1891 he was {{considered}} by many to be the top two-year-old. During the 1892 season he earned £13,023, the second highest of any horse and only bettered by La <b>Fleche.</b> By the time he retired at the end of the 1893 season, he had earned £32,528 throughout his racing career. This was the third highest of any horse in history, behind only Donovan and Ayrshire. When Orme was at his best, John Porter rated him 7 to 10 pounds inferior to Ormonde, whom Porter also trained. Porter also believed that Orme was a better racehorse at age four than he had been at two and three.|$|E
5|$|Riders who {{finished}} in the top ten in La <b>Flèche</b> Wallonne were awarded points in the UCI World Tour rankings. Valverde, as the race winner, won 80 points; Kelderman won 2 points for his tenth-place finish. Valverde moved from eighth to second place in the rankings; his 238 points left him 65 points behind Richie Porte, the leader of the ranking. Joaquim Rodríguez also moved up in the rankings from sixteenth to ninth place. Spain remained in second place in the nations' rankings, one point behind Australia, with Colombia moving ahead of the Netherlands into third place and France returning to the top 10. Etixx-Quick Step retained their lead in the teams' rankings.|$|E
5|$|The 2015 Amstel Gold Race was the 50th {{edition of}} the Amstel Gold Race one-day race. It took place on 19 April and was the {{eleventh}} race of the 2015 UCI World Tour. The Amstel Gold Race {{is part of the}} Ardennes classics season, although it takes place in the Limburg region of the Netherlands rather than in the Belgian Ardennes. It takes place in the week before La <b>Flèche</b> Wallonne and Liège–Bastogne–Liège, the other principal Ardennes classics. The defending champion in the 2015 {{edition of the}} race was Philippe Gilbert, who had won the race three times and had also won the 2012 world championships on a very similar course.|$|E
5|$|The team {{picked up}} their first single-day win {{the same day}} as the more prestigious Tour of Flanders, in which they participated but were not {{especially}} competitive, with Duque in 19th their best finisher. The race they won was the inaugural <b>Flèche</b> d'Emeraude, a new race in the UCI Europe Tour and the French Road Cycling Cup. Gallopin came first {{at the head of a}} field sprint in Saint-Malo. Zingle figured into a winning breakaway at the Brabantse Pijl, the precursor to the Ardennes classics. He took seventh place, a minute and a half back of the winner Philippe Gilbert. Vogondy was sixth at the Tour du Finistère, finishing with a big main group behind two leaders.|$|E
5|$|Wooden carvings in {{the shape}} of hawks, ancient gods, serpents and turtles are also popular. The Grand Huts, also known as grande case (chef's hut), are {{decorated}} with the filial of <b>fleche</b> faitiere representing the ancestral spirits, symbolic of transition between the world of the dead and the world of the living. The wood carving is shaped like the spear-like carving that adorns the top of the grande case. It comprises three parts; the flat crowned face representing the ancestor with a long, the rounded pole run through by conch shells mounted on it that represents the ancestor’s voice, and a base with the pole fixed to it to symbolise the link between the clan and the chief. The central piece is also flanked by wooden pieces with sharp points (facing downwards) that are intended to prevent bad spirits enveloping the ancestor in the central part. As it represented the power of the chiefs over their subjects, it was adopted as flag of the Kanaks by the organization leading the independent movement in New Caledonia. The arrow or the spear normally has a needle at the end to insert threaded shells from bottom to top. After the death of a Kanak chief, the <b>fleche</b> faitière is removed and his family takes it to their home. Though it was allowed to be used again as a sign of respect it is normally kept at burial grounds of noted citizens or at the mounds of abandoned grand houses.|$|E
5|$|By {{their own}} admission, Astana does not {{aim for the}} classics. The team first participated in Omloop Het Volk on March 1, with Dmitriy Muravyev in 31st their best-placed rider. Sergei Ivanov's 7th in the Amstel Gold Race proved {{to be one of}} the team's best results all season, as in the other spring races in which they competed, Kuurne–Brussels–Kuurne, the Tour of Flanders, and Gent–Wevelgem, they did not have a rider place higher than 13th. Due in part to the ban imposed by the Amaury Sport Organisation from {{participating}} in races they organized, the team did not compete in Milan–San Remo, Paris–Roubaix, La <b>Flèche</b> Wallonne, Liège–Bastogne–Liège, or other races in which a team of their caliber would normally take part. In March, Tomas Vaitkus earned the team's lone one-day victory of the spring season, winning a sprint finish to the Ronde van het Groene Hart.|$|E
5|$|Cavendish was runner-up in the 2010 Tour's points {{classification}} and had won 15 {{stages in}} the three previous Tours; he had won a stage at the Tour of Oman, the one-day race Scheldeprijs and two stages at the Giro during the 2011 season prior to the Tour. Gilbert had amassed a total of eleven wins (not including the national championships) for the season before the Tour, including three spring classics: Liège–Bastogne–Liège, Amstel Gold Race and La <b>Flèche</b> Wallonne. Farrar's form in the lead-up to the Tour included a stage win in both Tirreno–Adriatico and the Ster ZLM Toer. Hushovd, the world road race champion, only had one win in the season before the Tour, a stage of the Tour de Suisse. Petacchi's best results prior the Tour were a trio of {{stages in the}} Giro, the Volta a Catalunya and the Tour of Turkey. The major victory of Boonen's season up to the Tour was the Gent–Wevelgem one-day race.|$|E
5|$|Defending {{champion}} and runner-up in the 2012 Tour, Froome, had shown his form {{so far in}} the 2014 season by winning the general classification of two stage races, the Tour of Oman and the Tour de Romandie. Contador, winner of the 2007 and 2009 Tours, also won two stage races, the Tirreno–Adriatico and the Tour of the Basque Country in the lead-up to the Tour, placing second overall in the Volta ao Algarve, Volta a Catalunya and Critérium du Dauphiné. Nibali had missed the 2013 Tour as he had focused on the 2013 Giro, which he won. His highest Tour result was third in 2012. His best results {{so far in the}} 2014 season were fifth in the Tour de Romandie and seventh in the Dauphiné. Valverde, who placed eighth in the 2013 Tour and won of the 2009 Vuelta a España, had a number of wins in the 2014 season prior to the Tour, most notably, the Vuelta a Andalucía stage race and the La <b>Flèche</b> Wallonne one-day race.|$|E
5|$|The Second World War {{meant that}} {{construction}} {{work on the}} main college buildings could not begin until 21April 1949, when the foundation stone was laid; work on the warden's residence had begun in October 1948. Before the buildings were erected, the college operated from rented houses elsewhere in Oxford, on Banbury Road and Woodstock Road. There were further changes to Harrison's second design, as not only had inflation between 1937 and 1949 reduced the value of Nuffield's original donation, but additional savings {{had to be made}} in the difficult post-war economic situation. A scale model, created in 1949 as work started, showed the alterations: a shortened tower, a plainer main entrance, and no arcades within the quadrangles. Further changes were made once work was under way, including the indefinite postponement of construction of the institute opposite the college. The plans of the tower were altered so that it would hold a library, instead of being purely ornamental, windows were added at regular intervals, and it was topped by a copper <b>flèche,</b> or small spire.|$|E
