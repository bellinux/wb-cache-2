500|$|Franken {{signed a}} one-year {{contract}} in early 2004 to host a talk show for Air America Radio's flagship program with co-host Katherine Lanpher, who remained with the show until October 2005. The network was launched March 31, 2004. Originally named The O'Franken Factor but renamed The Al Franken Show on July 12, 2004, the show aired three hours a day, {{five days a week}} for three years. The stated goal of the show was to provide the public airwaves with more progressive views to counter what Franken perceived was the dominance of conservative syndicated commentary on the radio: [...] "I'm doing this because <b>I</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>use</b> my energies to get Bush unelected," [...] he told a New York Times reporter in 2004. Franken's last radio show on Air America Radio was on February 14, 2007, {{at the end of which}} he announced his candidacy for the United States Senate.|$|E

2500|$|Florence and the Machine {{played at}} Australia's Splendour in the Grass music festival in July 2010. The group drew {{one of the}} biggest crowds of the three-day festival. They {{performed}} in the natural open-air amphitheatre, which had to be closed off by security due to safety concerns as an unprecedented number of festival-goers rushed to see the performance. It is estimated that 28,000 people of the 33,000 people who attended the festival crammed in to see Florence and the Machine. The amphitheatre was reopened shortly after the start, once the safety concerns were allayed. In October 2009, the band's equipment and instruments were caught in a trailer fire during their European tour, forcing the band to use rented instruments to complete their remaining shows. Welch stated, [...] "You could hear the harp's strings ping in the fire. Strange sound. We recorded it and <b>I</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>use</b> it in a song." ...|$|E

5000|$|Steinman {{also wanted}} a choir {{in this section}} of the song, but Rundgren vetoed it. Steinman says that he <b>wanted</b> it <b>to</b> sound [...] "just like in the film 2001: A Space Odyssey, they used a choir {{sounding}} like it was singing whole clusters of notes. <b>I</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>use</b> an entire orchestra, and <b>I</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>use</b> them viciously." ...|$|R

2500|$|In the Plame affair, Scooter Libby, convicted {{chief of}} staff for Vice President Dick Cheney, told special {{prosecutor}} Patrick Fitzgerald that Russert told him of the identity of Central Intelligence Agency officer Valerie Plame (who is married to former ambassador Joseph C. Wilson). Russert testified previously, and again in United States v. I. Lewis Libby, that he would neither testify whether he spoke with Libby nor would he describe the conversation. Russert did say, however, that Plame's identity as a CIA operative was not leaked to him. Russert testified again in the trial on February 7, 2007. According to the Washington Post, Russert testified that [...] "when any senior government official calls him, they are presumptively off the record," [...] saying: [...] "when I talk to senior government officials on the phone, it's my own policy our conversations are confidential. If <b>I</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>use</b> anything from that conversation, then I will ask permission." ...|$|E

50|$|My {{idea was}} to turn over a new leaf, to free myself so to speak from the 20th century. <b>I</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>use</b> all the {{expressive}} densities that that century conceded to me, and {{for me it was}} a kind of synthesis of the musical experiences that had struck me most.|$|R
6000|$|... "Oh, yes indeed; all the 'patter,' {{and some}} of the guile. For instance, when <b>I</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>use</b> 'those who have passed on' I do so, and when I don't I invent means to deceive them." ...|$|E

5000|$|Clark said, [...] "I {{particularly}} <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> {{show what}} a defense attorney's job {{is in this}} age of social media, as well as the ability of a lawyer to access public opinion through Twitter and Facebook. <b>I</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>use</b> all of today's tools to show what it's like to be a defense attorney in this world." ...|$|R
5000|$|Some {{executives}} <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> develop Tonéx's {{career in}} a secular direction, {{but he turned}} them down and kept to religious themes.

6000|$|... "What has {{the actual}} lapse of time {{got to do}} with it? It is only shallow people who require years to get rid of an emotion. A man who is master of himself can end a sorrow as easily as he can invent a pleasure. I don't want to be at the mercy of my emotions. <b>I</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>use</b> them, to enjoy them, and to {{dominate}} them." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I wonder {{now what}} O-t-a-r-d is?" [...] soliloquised Israel, slowly {{spelling}} the word. [...] "I {{have a good}} mind {{to step in and}} ask Dr. Franklin. He knows everything. Let me smell it. No, it's sealed; smell is locked in. Those are pretty flowers. Let's smell them: no smell again. Ah, I see--sort of flowers in women's bonnets--sort of calico flowers. Beautiful soap. This smells anyhow--regular soap-roses--a white rose and a red one. That long-necked bottle there looks like a crane. I wonder what's in that? Hallo! E-a-u--d-e--C-o-l-o-g-n-e. I wonder if Dr. Franklin understands that? It looks like his white wine. This is nice sugar. Let's taste. Yes, this is very nice sugar, sweet as--yes, it's sweet as sugar; better than maple sugar, such as they make at home. But I'm crunching it too loud, the Doctor will hear me. But here's a teaspoon. What's this for? There's no tea, nor tea-cup; but here's a tumbler, and here's drinking water. Let me see. Seems to me, putting this and that and the other thing together, it's a sort of alphabet that spells something. Spoon, tumbler, water, sugar,--brandy--that's it. O-t-a-r-d is brandy. Who put these things here? What does it all mean? Don't put sugar here for show, don't put a spoon here for ornament, nor a jug of water. There is only one meaning to it, and that is a very polite invitation from some invisible person to help myself, if I like, to a glass of brandy and sugar, and if I don't like, let it alone. That's my reading. I have a good mind to ask Doctor Franklin about it, though, for there's just a chance I may be mistaken, and these things here be some other person's private property, not at all meant for me to help myself from. Cologne, what's that--never mind. Soap: soap's to wash with. <b>I</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>use</b> soap, anyway. Let me see--no, there's no soap on the wash-stand. I see, soap is not given gratis here in Paris, to boarders. But if you want it, take it from the marble, and it will be charged in the bill. If you don't want it let it alone, and no charge. Well, that's fair, anyway. But then to a man who could not afford to use soap, such beautiful cakes as these lying before his eyes all the time, would be a strong temptation. And now that I think of it, the O-t-a-r-d looks rather tempting too. But if I don't like it now, I can let it alone. I've a good mind to try it. But it's sealed. I wonder now if I am right in my understanding of this alphabet? Who knows? I'll venture one little sip, anyhow. Come, cork. Hark!" ...|$|E

5000|$|Promises Kept is an {{unreleased}} album by The Supremes, recorded {{during the}} latter half of 1971 with multiple producers. Ultimately, the project was shelved by Motown in favor of a different set, Floy Joy, produced entirely by Smokey Robinson the following year.

5000|$|... "The {{challenge}} as I {{saw it was}} to have the primary medium of expression something unique to games. So it couldn’t be a story for example, because stories can be told by other mediums. It couldn’t be a poem or sounds because they also have other counterparts. In other words <b>I</b> didn’t <b>want</b> <b>to</b> limit games to being a hybrid art form. ... <b>I</b> <b>wanted</b> something that was not easily representable by other media. <b>I</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>use</b> game rules <b>to</b> explain something invisible but real." ...|$|R
50|$|Guitarist Mike McCready on the song:I {{remember}} thinking {{that this was a}} really beautiful song when I heard it. Chris Cornell (Soundgarden) showed me the riff. I had a '62 reissue Strat and <b>I</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>use</b> the fourth-position tone setting—between the bridge and middle pickups—for the beginning of the song because I like that softer sound.

5000|$|Interviewed by SFX Magazine in January 2011, Firrell stated, [...] "I am {{interested}} {{in the power of}} popular culture to disseminate sound ideas about how to live productive, intriguing and valuable lives. It struck me that popular culture is often looked down on by 'serious' critics or commentators. <b>I</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>use</b> my privileged position as an artist to counter this by taking a very long, deep and critical view of the ideas in science fiction and their potential value when applied to our daily lives.|$|R
