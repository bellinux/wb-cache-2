40|$|Eight {{synthetic}} food colorants (Amaranth, Brilliant Blue, Indigo Carmine, New Red, Ponceau 4 R, Sunset Yellow, Tartrazine, Allura Red) {{were determined}} by high-performance ion chromatography on an anion-exchange <b>analytical</b> <b>column</b> with very low hydrophobicity and visible absorbance detection. Gradient elution with hydrochloric acid-acetonitrile effected both the chromatographic separation of these colorants and the on-line clean-up of the <b>analytical</b> <b>column,</b> which was very advantageous for routine analysis. High-performance ion chromatography may be {{a solution to the}} chromatographic analysis for some water-soluble, organic analytes with strong hydrophobicity. The method has been applied to the determination of colorants in drinks and in instant drink powder. No time-consuming pretreatment, as used in conventional liquid chromatography, was needed.

40|$|This is a fully {{automated}} system for determining six common antiepileptic drugs and two principal metabolites of carba-mazepine in serum. {{it is based}} on “high-performance ” liquid chromatography (HPLC), with column switching. TSKpreco-lumn BSA-ODS and TSKgel 005 - 1 20 A (both from Toyo Soda) were used as the precolumn and <b>analytical</b> <b>column,</b> respectively. The former contains octadecylsilyl resins treat-ed with bovine serum albumin (BSA), and does not adsorb macromolecules such as serum proteins but retains small lipophilic molecules such as antiepileptic drugs. Serum sam-ples are directly injected onto the precolumn. After washing out the serum proteins from the precoiumn with sodium phosphate buffer, we switch the column connections to introduce the retained substances onto the <b>analytical</b> <b>column</b> and elute with a step-gradient of acetonitrile/sodium phos...|$|R

40|$|A simple method, {{based on}} the {{technique}} of capillary column switching-back flushing, has been developed for the detailed analysis of aromatic compounds in gasoline. The sample was first separated on a 30 -m long OV- 2330 polar precolumn and then backflushed onto a nonpolar <b>analytical</b> <b>column.</b> The early eluting components from the precolumn and the components of interest (aromatic compounds plus heavier compounds) eluting from the <b>analytical</b> <b>column</b> are all directed to the same flame ionization detection system through a T piece, which permits the quantitative analysis of aromatic hydrocarbons in gasoline by a normalization method using correcting factors. The switching time window of the method is +/- 5 s, resulting in easier operation and higher reliability. The reproducibility of the quantitative analysis was {{less than or equal}} to 3 % RSD for real gasoline samples. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science B. V. All rights reserved...|$|R
40|$|Cryptolepine is an indoloquinoline {{compound}} identified {{to have an}} antimalarial {{activity and}} found in the root of Cryptolepis Sanguinolenta. The literature survey revealed {{that there is no}} well developed and validated a <b>HPLC</b> <b>analytical</b> method for cryptolepine. Moreover, the amount of the isolated cryptolepine from the root powder of the plant has not been determined. The present study aimed at development and validation of a <b>HPLC</b> <b>analytical</b> method for cryptolepine and quantification of its content in the roots of Cryptolepis Sanguinolenta. Cryptolepine was soxhlet-extracted from the root powder of plant with methanol, followed by isolation using a combination of chromatography and liquid-liquid extraction. A HPLC method was developed and validated in accordance with the International Conference on Harmonisation (ICH) guidelines. The HPLC method was used to estimate the cryptolepine content in the root powder of the plant. The yield from the isolation procedure was almost 1 %w/w. The method showed a good linearity (r 2 > 0. 9983), high degree of precision (%R. S. D D and LQ were found to be 0. 9259 ± 0. 0045 and 3. 1971 ± 0. 0156 respectively. The cryptolepine content in the root powder was 1. 25 %w/w. These results indicated that an accurate HPLC method for quantification of cryptolepine hydrochloride has been developed and validated. The content determination confirmed cryptolepine as a major alkaloid in the root of Cryptolepis sanguinolenta...|$|R
