40|$|Students’ <b>epistemologies</b> {{affect how}} {{and what they}} learn: do they believe physics {{is a list of}} equations, or a {{coherent}} and sensible description of the physical world? In order to study these <b>epistemologies</b> as part of curricular assessment, we adopt the resources framework, which posits that students have many productive epistemological resources that can be brought to bear as they learn physics. In previous studies, these <b>epistemologies</b> have been either inferred from behavior in learning contexts or probed through surveys or interviews outside of the learning context. We argue that stimulated recall interviews provide a contextually and interpretively valid method to access students’ <b>epistemologies</b> that complement existing methods. We develop a stimulated recall interview methodology to assess a curricular intervention and find evidence that epistemological resources aptly describe student <b>epistemologies...</b>|$|R
40|$|We {{have already}} argued {{not only that}} essentialism is {{detrimental}} for <b>epistemologies</b> and philosophies of sciences, as well as sciences themselves, but also that feminist standpoint <b>epistemologies</b> of sciences inevitably yield essentialism, or at least its undesirable consequences (Amoretti and Vassallo 2010 a, 2011, forthcoming). Although abandoning feminist standpoint <b>epistemologies</b> seems to represent the straightforward solution, matters are more complicated. Some of the tenets of these <b>epistemologies,</b> in fact, can hardly be disregarded, such as those underlying the situatedness and intersubjectivity of scientific knowledge. Thus, the specific aim {{of this paper is}} showing that it is still possible to retain the above characteristics – namely situatedness and intersubjectivity – even while rejecting the very notion of standpoint...|$|R

5|$|Feminist {{economics}} {{is the critical}} study of economics including its methodology, <b>epistemology,</b> history and empirical research, attempting to overcome androcentric (male and patriarchal) biases. It focuses on topics of particular relevance to women, such as care work or occupational segregation (exclusion of women and minorities from certain fields); deficiencies of economic models, such as disregarding intra-household bargaining; new forms of data collection and measurement such as the Gender Empowerment Measure (GEM), and more gender-aware theories such as the capabilities approach. Feminist economics ultimately seeks to produce a more gender inclusive economics.|$|E
40|$|This paper {{presents}} developmental, {{cognitive and}} psychometric tradition in research of personal <b>epistemologies.</b> Instead of a 'neutral' approach, we offer {{the analysis of}} research metaphors underlying the studying of personal <b>epistemologies.</b> Metaphor 'pilgrim's progress' assumes understanding epistemological development as a 'temptation' leading towards 'enlightenment' and abandoning faith in Absolute truth. Metaphor 'regulatory software' narrows down researcher's subject of interest to epistemic cognition in the specific problem situation, whereby evaluation of functioning of 'regulatory software' and its improvement are observed {{as the most important}} tasks. Finally, within the metaphor 'decent outfit' the starting assumption is that epistemological beliefs are relatively fixed and that personal <b>epistemologies</b> which are 'balanced' and 'decent' are privileged. By analyzing research metaphors, light was shed on basic assumptions and implications of research of personal <b>epistemologies.</b> The following questions were explored: which ways of 'seeing' were pledged in the approaches to research of personal <b>epistemologies,</b> which methodological choices arise from those ways of 'seeing', as well as which are the functions or effects of different ways of 'seeing'. In this way, a new perspective was offered for the assessment of multiple conceptualizations in research of personal <b>epistemologies...</b>|$|R

5|$|Clement {{begins the}} fourth {{book with a}} belated {{explanation}} of the disorganized nature of the work, and gives {{a brief description of}} his aims for the remaining three or four books. The fourth book focuses on martyrdom. While all good Christians should be unafraid of death, Clement condemns those who actively seek out a martyr's death, arguing {{that they do not have}} sufficient respect for God's gift of life. He is ambivalent whether any believing Christian can become a martyr by virtue of the manner of their death, or whether martyrdom is reserved for those who have lived exceptional lives. Marcionites cannot become martyrs, because they do not believe in the divinity of God the Father – their sufferings are in vain. There is then a digression to the subject of theological <b>epistemology.</b> According to Clement, there is no way of empirically testing the existence of God the Father, because the Logos has revelatory, not analysable meaning, although Christ was an object of the senses. God had no beginning, and is the universal first principle.|$|E

40|$|This paper elaborates {{the concept}} of {{personal}} <b>epistemologies</b> in learning through and for work. It does this by drawing on explanatory propositions from psychology, sociology and philosophy to advance an account of these <b>epistemologies.</b> The aim here is to go beyond conceptions of epistemological beliefs and to position personal <b>epistemologies</b> as being active, intentional, derived in personally-particular ways through socially-derived experiences that comprise individuals' life histories or ontogenies. In this way, they are held to be more encompassing as a conception and are constructed through social experiences, albeit in person-specific ways. Given their active and constructive character, these <b>epistemologies</b> are placed centre stage in the dual processes of learning and remaking culturally-derived practices, such as with paid work. These propositions are discussed and elaborated {{through a consideration of}} engagement and learning in forms of work that provide, respectively, relatively weak and rich forms of direct social support, and which require the enactment in different ways of individuals' personal <b>epistemologies</b> in the conduct of and learning through paid work.

Advaita Vedanta scholars considered six means of valid knowledge and to truths: Pratyakṣa (perception), Anumāṇa (inference), Upamāṇa (comparison and analogy), Arthāpatti (postulation), Anupalabdhi (non-perception, cognitive proof) and Śabda (word, testimony of past or present reliable experts). While Charvaka school accepted just one, the valid means of <b>epistemology</b> in other schools of Hinduism ranged between 2 and 6.|$|E

40|$|This {{paper is}} an attempt to {{understand}} the multiple versions of Mahābhārata narratives in Kannada as pluralistic <b>epistemologies.</b> As pluralistic <b>epistemologies</b> they coexist side by side, cater to the sectarian needs of the community and also lead to certain degree of syncretism by mutually absorbing from each other’s traditions. Scripto-centric versions of the Mahābhārata narratives from Jaina and Brahminical traditions, phono-centric version from a Tāntric tradition and a body-centric version from a version in sculpture and painting have been discussed to demonstrate various aspects of pluralistic <b>epistemologies</b> of the Mahābhārata tradition in Kannada. It has been further suggested that a complex interrelationship between textual tradition, medieval kāvya recitation tradition (gamaka-vācana) and the folk performing tradition (yaksagāna) created an intextuality of narrative traditions in medieval Karnataka that has been responsible for coexistence of multiple traditions as pluralistic <b>epistemologies.</b> 1...|$|R
