5|$|Landscape {{painting}} in Scotland includes {{all forms of}} painting of landscapes in Scotland since its origins <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>sixteenth</b> <b>century</b> to the present day. The earliest examples of Scottish landscape painting are {{in the tradition of}} Scottish house decoration that arose <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>sixteenth</b> <b>century.</b> Often said to be the earliest surviving painted landscape created in Scotland is a depiction by the Flemish artist Alexander Keirincx undertaken for Charles I.|$|E

5|$|Cashews (Anacardium occidentale) grow as a drupe that is {{attached}} to the cashew apple, the fruit of the cashew tree.

5|$|Camus was the {{supposed}} {{leader of a}} Norse expeditionary force defeated by the armies of King Malcolm II at the Battle of Barry.

The battle, and its main protagonists, including Camus, are now known to be historically inauthentic.|$|E
5|$|The Jain {{philosophy}} and literature have contributed immensely {{to the religious}} and cultural landscape of Karnataka. Islam, which had an early presence {{on the west coast}} of India as early as the tenth century, gained a foothold in Karnataka with the rise of the Bahamani and Bijapur sultanates that ruled parts of Karnataka.

5|$|The {{river is}} known to have been used for {{shipping}} in Roman times, when it was navigable to Bodiam and possibly further upstream. There are records of small boats reaching Etchingham during Saxon and Norman periods. Stone for building Bodiam Castle was transported along the river in the fourteenth century, and iron was shipped from Newenden or Udiam <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>sixteenth</b> <b>century.</b> A century later, an iron store was erected at Udiam. Maytham Wharf served Rolvenden, while Tenterden was served by Small Hythe.|$|E
5|$|Greyfriars, in Bristol, England, was a Franciscan friary. The name Greyfriars {{derived from}} the grey robes worn by the friars. It was founded at some time before 1234, within the town walls and then moved to Lewin's Mead in 1250. The site {{included}} extensive gardens surrounded by a stone wall. Following the Dissolution of the Monasteries <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>sixteenth</b> <b>century,</b> the premises were leased to the town council in 1541, who desired to use the stone to make repairs to the town walls, and the harbour facilities. In succeeding centuries many different uses have {{been made of the}} site, which is currently occupied by an office block and part of Bristol Dental School.|$|E
5|$|In {{the late}} Middle Ages the {{problems}} of schism in the Catholic Church allowed the Scottish Crown to gain greater influence over senior appointments and two archbishoprics had been established {{by the end of}} the fifteenth century. Historians have discerned a decline in traditional monastic life in the late Middle Ages, but the mendicant orders of friars grew, particularly in the expanding burghs, emphasised preaching and ministering to the population. New saints and cults of devotion also proliferated. Despite problems over the number and quality of clergy after the Black Death in the fourteenth century, and evidence of heresy in the fifteenth century, the Church in Scotland remained stable before the Reformation <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>sixteenth</b> <b>century.</b>|$|E

5|$|<b>In</b> <b>the</b> <b>sixteenth</b> <b>century,</b> {{the court}} was central to the {{patronage}} and dissemination of Renaissance works and ideas. Lavish court display was often tied up with ideas of chivalry, which was evolving in this period from into an ornamental and honorific cult. Tournaments provided one focus of display and were also pursued enthusiastically by James V, proud of his membership of international orders of knighthood. During her brief personal rule, Mary, Queen of Scots brought many of the elaborate court activities that {{she had grown up}} with at the French court, with balls, masques and celebrations, designed to illustrate the resurgence of the monarchy and to facilitate national unity. Under James VI, the court returned to being a centre of culture and learning and he cultivated the image of a philosopher king.|$|E
5|$|Scholars have {{increasingly}} {{recognized the importance}} of figures other than John Calvin and Huldrych Zwingli in the early formation of the Reformed tradition. Richard Muller, a chief authority on the development of this movement, has argued that Vermigli, Wolfgang Musculus, and Heinrich Bullinger were as influential if not more influential than Calvin on the development of Reformed theology <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>sixteenth</b> <b>century.</b> Vermigli was a transitional figure between the Reformation period and the period known as Reformed orthodoxy. In the Reformed orthodox period, the theology first articulated by Reformation figures was codified and systematized. Theologians increasingly resorted to the methods of scholastic theology and the tradition of Aristotelianism. Vermigli {{was the first of the}} Reformed scholastic theologians, and he influenced later scholastics Theodore Beza and Girolamo Zanchi.|$|E
5|$|The {{geometric}} {{designs in}} Islamic art are often built on combinations of repeated squares and circles, {{which may be}} overlapped and interlaced, as can arabesques (with which they are often combined), to form intricate and complex patterns, including {{a wide variety of}} tessellations. These may constitute the entire decoration, may form a framework for floral or calligraphic embellishments, or may retreat into the background around other motifs. The complexity and variety of patterns used evolved from simple stars and lozenges in the ninth century, through a variety of 6- to 13-point patterns by the 13thcentury, and finally to include also 14- and 16-point stars <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>sixteenth</b> <b>century.</b>|$|E

5|$|The {{lower portion}} of the river, from the sea to Ford, was navigable in the {{eleventh}} century {{at the time of}} the Norman conquest. <b>In</b> <b>the</b> <b>sixteenth</b> <b>century,</b> Henry FitzAlan, 19th Earl of Arundel built wharves at Ford, and improved the river channel below there, so that the town became a port. Over the 30 years from 1544, he also improved the river as far upstream as Pallingham Quay. Although the work involved a number of flash locks, which were not very successful, no tolls were charged for its use, and vessels of around 15 tons were used to carry timber. Attempts to make the river navigable up to Newbridge in the early sixteenth century were not successful.|$|E
5|$|Willy Vandersteen created {{one last}} new series in 1985: De Geuzen, a historical, humoristic comic set in Flanders <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>sixteenth</b> <b>century.</b> Similar in theme to the thirty years older Tijl Uilenspiegel, the comic {{combined}} many of Vandersteen's passions, including {{the art of}} Pieter Brueghel the Elder. It contained his most mature, developed characters, compared to the often one-dimensional characters of his earlier series, and reached a graphical level that approached his work for Kuifje. The comics were not prepublished and were mostly created by Vandersteen alone, which ensured the quality but also decreased the publication rhythm. Only ten albums appeared, and the series ended {{with the death of}} Vandersteen.|$|E
5|$|From a low base at the {{beginning}} of the sixteenth century, trade expanded in the 1530s, but suffered from the English invasions of the Rough Wooing in the 1540s. From the mid-sixteenth century, Scotland experienced a decline in demand for exports of cloth and wool to the continent. Scots responded by selling larger quantities of traditional goods, increasing the output of salt, herring and coal. The fortunes of Scottish burghs in the export trade changed across the century. Haddington, which had been one of the major centres of trade in the late Medieval period, saw its share of foreign exports collapse <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>sixteenth</b> <b>century.</b> Aberdeen's share of trade remained stable for most of the century, but slumped in the last decade. The small Fife ports grew in significance and Edinburgh took an increasing share of trade through its port of Leith. This forced smaller ports to diversify into other commodities and to undertake more coastal trading. Overall there was an increase in foreign trade from the 1570s, of which Edinburgh received the major share.|$|E
