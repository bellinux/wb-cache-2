500|$|The four {{officers}} were {{taken aback by}} Taylor's searing words and felt they had been humiliated. A decade after the incident, Kỳ described Taylor as [...] "the sort of man who addressed people rather than talked to them", referencing the confrontation. Karnow said [...] "For the sake of their own pride, they [...] resented being treated in ways that reminded them of their almost total dependence on an alien power. <b>How</b> <b>could</b> <b>they</b> preserve a sense of sovereignty when Taylor, striving to push them into 'getting things done', behaved like a viceroy?" [...] However, Thi also took a perverse pleasure in riling Taylor. He was seen by a CIA officer soon after, grinning. When asked why he was happy, Thi said [...] "Because {{this is one of}} the happiest days of my life...Today I told the American ambassador that he could not dictate to us." [...] Nevertheless, Taylor's conduct had rankled the officers, stirring their latent sense of nationalism and anti-Americanism; Khánh would exploit this to strengthen his fragile position in the junta.|$|E
500|$|Rikky Rooksby, {{author of}} The Complete Guide to the Music of Madonna, {{noted that the}} lyrics of [...] "Bedtime Story" [...] are an hymn to the joys of {{unconsciousness}} and {{a rejection of the}} supposed constraints of reason and language, hence the line [...] "Words are useless, especially sentences, They don't stand for anything, <b>How</b> <b>could</b> <b>they</b> explain how I feel?" [...] Lyrically, despite being a song about a trip to the unconscious, scholars have noticed subtexts within the song's meaning. Vicente noted that postmodernism and new age themes are prevalent within the lyrics, especially with regards to their incapability of articulating the concept of the truth, as well as the song's theme of meditation and relax. Islamic mystic and sexual themes have also been noted within the song's lyrics. Vicente further found that the cliché references to [...] "honey", [...] "longing and yearning", and the sexual connotations of being [...] "wet on the inside" [...] does not relate to [...] "secular" [...] love, but to [...] "ecstatic" [...] Sufi poetry. The lyrics allude to concepts of movement which are [...] "central" [...] to Sufi philosophy: [...] "It indicates achieving fana through sema (getting 'lost' and 'leaving logic and reason to the arms of unconsciousness')".|$|E
500|$|... "Forbidden Love", {{the seventh}} track on the album, finds Madonna {{comparing}} rejection to an aphrodisiac and dismissing any relationship untouched by taboo. Composed {{in a minor}} key with whispering voices in the background (one of them being of Babyface's), the song features a string section in the middle eight. The instrumentation is kept at minimum to emphasize the vocals, and the song ends with fading out. Track eight, [...] "Love Tried to Welcome Me", is a ballad which {{was inspired by a}} stripper Madonna met in a club, and has a fetish about rejection. The first 42 seconds consist of a string section, following which the verses start. The song projects a sombre and melancholy mood with Madonna lyrically asserting that she is [...] "drawn to sadness" [...] and [...] "loneliness has never been a stranger" [...] on the song. The next song on Bedtime Stories is [...] "Sanctuary" [...] where Madonna quotes Walt Whitman's poem Vocalism in the lyrics, and aligns love and death. Musically it has a [...] "techno pull" [...] and has an atmospheric introduction with an assortment of odd noises, electric guitar and some strings. The song is linked {{to the beginning of the}} next album track, [...] "Bedtime Story", which starts with its chords. It is an electronic song where Madonna wonders [...] "Words are useless, especially sentences, They don't stand for anything, <b>How</b> <b>could</b> <b>they</b> explain how I feel?" [...] The last song on the album [...] "Take a Bow" [...] is a midtempo pop ballad with a [...] "Sukiyaki"-like Japanese touch. The chorus expresses the theme of saying goodbye to a lover who had taken her for granted. The title plays upon the verse in the song [...] "all the world is a stage and everyone has their part", a reference to the line by William Shakespeare in his play As You Like It, [...] "All the world's a stage, and all the men and women mere players".|$|E

2500|$|In {{order to}} {{alleviate}} Cebes' {{worry that the}} soul might perish at death, Socrates introduces his first argument for the immortality of the soul. This argument is often called the Cyclical Argument. It supposes that the soul must be immortal since the living come from the dead. Socrates says: [...] "Now if it be true that the living come from the dead, then our souls must exist in the other world, for if not, <b>how</b> <b>could</b> <b>they</b> have been born again?". He goes on to show, using examples of relationships, such as asleep-awake and hot-cold, that things that have opposites come to be from their opposite. One falls asleep after having been awake. And after being asleep, he awakens. Things that are hot can become cold and vice versa. Socrates then gets Cebes {{to conclude that the}} dead are generated from the living, through death, and that the living are generated from the dead, through birth. The souls of the dead must exist in some place for {{them to be able to}} return to life.|$|E

2500|$|Taylor {{met with}} John Battle, then the Member of Parliament for Leeds West, in 1987 {{to present his}} findings, and Battle raised the matter in a House of Commons debate. Along with Leeds City Council, {{he called for a}} public inquiry into the deaths at Armley, but the {{incumbent}} Conservative government under Margaret Thatcher rejected the request, {{on the grounds that it}} [...] "would cause needless concern, that it was impossible to discover what had happened at Roberts, and that no one could then have imagined that the dust could have harmed residents." [...] Battle submitted to the House: [...] "I cannot believe that those who owned and ran Roberts can have gone in and out without seeing the dust everywhere on the surrounding streets and pavements. If they knew that their workers within had to be protected from the asbestos dust, <b>how</b> <b>could</b> <b>they</b> have ignored the position of their neighbours who lived with that dust outside?

2500|$|The {{arrest of}} Jiang Qing {{and the other}} members of the Gang of Four in 1976, and {{especially}} the reforms initiated at the Third Plenum of the Eleventh National Party Congress Central Committee in December 1978, led writers to take up their pens again. Much of the literature in what would be called the [...] "new era" [...] (新时期) discussed the serious abuses of power that had taken place at both the national and the local levels during the Cultural Revolution. The writers decried the waste of time and talent during that decade and bemoaned abuses that had held China back. This literature, often called [...] "scar literature," [...] or [...] "the literature of the wounded," [...] discussed the experiences of sent-down youth with great though not complete frankness and conveyed disquieting views of the party and the political system. Intensely patriotic, these authors wrote cynically of the political leadership that gave rise to the extreme chaos and disorder of the Cultural Revolution. Many of these themes and attitudes were also found in Fifth Generation films of directors trained after 1978, many of which were based on published novels and short stories. Some of this fiction and cinema extended the blame to the entire generation of leaders and to the political system itself. The political authorities were faced with a serious problem: <b>how</b> <b>could</b> <b>they</b> encourage writers to criticize and discredit the abuses of the Cultural Revolution without allowing that criticism to go beyond what they considered tolerable limits? ...|$|E
