500|$|Despite the tone, Etty {{was pleased}} to be noticed by a {{newspaper}} as influential as The Times, and much later confessed how delighted he was that the [...] "Times noticed me. <b>I</b> <b>felt</b> <b>my</b> chariot wheels were on the right road to fame and honour, and I now drove on like another Jehu!" [...] Possibly {{as a result of}} the criticism in The Times, Freeling asked Etty to overpaint the figures in the foreground of Cleopatra. In 1829, after Etty had become a respected artist, Freeling allowed the restoration of the figures to their original condition.|$|E
2500|$|In {{the return}} series in Australia Trott made 19 {{runs in the}} first Test at Brisbane, before {{returning}} home due to a stress related illness. In his autobiography, he cites his increasing struggles facing the short ball as a principal cause of his problems: [...] "I felt I was being questioned as a man. <b>I</b> <b>felt</b> <b>my</b> dignity was being stripped away with every short ball I ducked or parried. It was degrading." ...|$|E
2500|$|On the {{evolution}} of technique in his illustration, Grossman has said, [...] "I {{was impressed by the}} way David Levine and the Push Pin artists were using line to develop a bulgy three-dimensional feeling in their work. I found an old airbrush in my dad's shop and discovered a jiffy way to outbulge them all. For a while I diligently pursued outline-less-ness as the secret to a real stereoscopic three-dimensional look. <b>I</b> <b>felt</b> <b>my</b> line work belonged to a different world {{that had nothing to do}} with the airbrush and went its separate way. Lately I find a strong line reasserting itself in my pictures." ...|$|E

2500|$|In 1906, Rischbieth {{and others}} founded the Children's Protection Society in Western Australia {{and joined the}} Women's Service Guilds of Western Australia in 1909. The Rischbieths {{travelled}} throughout Japan and India, and stayed in London during either 1908 or 1913. Women's suffrage was a dominant topic in Britain at this time; a mass rally, subsequent public debate and prosecutions of activists were occurring. The pacifist response to the Cat and Mouse Act in particular, fired {{a passion for the}} equality movement. After hearing Emily Pankhurst speak for the Women's Social and Political Union, she wrote to her sister, [...] "... as I listened, <b>I</b> <b>felt</b> <b>my</b> backbone growing longer, as though you gained courage and freedom from her".|$|E
2500|$|Elizabeth Tall Chief's {{paternal}} great-grandfather, Peter Bigheart, {{had helped}} negotiate for the Osages concerning oil revenues that enriched the Osage Nation. Her father grew up rich as a result, never working [...] "a {{day in his}} life." [...] In her autobiography, Tall Chief explained [...] "As a young girl growing up on the Osage reservation in Fairfax, Oklahoma, <b>I</b> <b>felt</b> <b>my</b> father owned the town. He had property everywhere. The local movie theater on Main Street, and the pool hall opposite, belonged to him. Our 10-room, terracotta-brick house stood high on a hill overlooking the reservation." [...] The family spent summers in Colorado Springs to escape the Oklahoma heat. Life was far from perfect, though, as {{her father was a}} binge drinker and her parents often fought about money.|$|E
2500|$|Clarke {{related the}} {{experience}} of Donna Tagliaferri, who described [...] "a terrifying incident after meeting Cosby in the mid-1970s through tennis" [...] {{when she was in}} her early 20s. After playing tennis with Cosby a number of times, he invited her on a dinner date and then invited her up to his hotel room. Tagliaferri had a girlfriend accompany them. After showing them around the penthouse, [...] "things changed dramatically and quickly. He made it clear to me in a very aggressive way what his intentions were. He chillingly said to me, 'I will have you.' Those words are imprinted on my brain along with the evil <b>I</b> <b>felt.</b> <b>My</b> first thought was, 'No you will not.' Then shock took over, and when words wouldn't come a paralyzing feeling did." [...] At this point her girlfriend started talking and got them out of the situation: [...] "I {{have no way of knowing}} what would have happened if Wendy had not been there. What I do know is his words were an assault to me never to be forgotten. And the betrayal of a friendship was staggering." ...|$|E
60|$|I did so, without hesitation, looking him full in {{the face}} with {{heightened}} colour, but speaking with all the determination which <b>I</b> <b>felt</b> in <b>my</b> heart.|$|R
6000|$|... "What?" [...] I was all aghast, and <b>I</b> <b>felt</b> that <b>my</b> chagrin was {{expressed}} {{in the tone of}} horrified surprise in my voice. She went on quickly: ...|$|R

2500|$|According to Amy Lee, {{the song}} has several meanings, the first being an {{incident}} at a restaurant. During an interview from a tour stop in Tulsa she told The Boston Phoenix: [...] "I {{was inspired to}} write it when someone said something to me— I didn’t know him, and I {{thought he might be}} clairvoyant. I was in a relationship and I was completely unhappy. But I was hiding it. I was being completely abused and I was trying to cover it up; I wouldn’t even admit it to myself. So then I had spoken maybe 10 or 15 words to this guy, who was a friend of a friend. We were waiting for everyone else to show up, and we went into a restaurant and got a table. And {{he looked at me and}} said, ‘Are you happy?’ And <b>I</b> <b>felt</b> <b>my</b> heart leap, and I was like, he totally knows what I’m thinking. And I lied, I said I was fine. Anyway, he's not really clairvoyant. But he is a sociology major." [...] Lee said in a VH1 interview: [...] "Open-mindedness. It's about waking up to all the things you've been missing for so long. One day someone said something that made my heart race for a second and I realized that for months I'd been numb, just going through the motions of life." [...] During an interview with Blender, Lee claimed that she wrote [...] "Bring Me to Life" [...] about her longtime friend, Josh Hartzler, whom she married in 2007.|$|E

6000|$|... "Sholto, you hit us {{all very}} hard that Monday before Christmas. I know what <b>I</b> <b>felt</b> about <b>my</b> daughter. But I {{can only imagine}} what your mother must have felt about her son." ...|$|R
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>felt</b> <b>my</b> blood run {{cold for}} a moment. I {{did not dare}} to look at Mabane.|$|E
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>felt</b> <b>my</b> arm seized {{above the}} elbow, and next instant found myself swung {{so as to}} face Mr. Razumov.|$|E
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>felt</b> <b>my</b> face {{reddening}} {{at these}} ill words, so I stooped, {{as if to}} clear my spur of mire.|$|E
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>felt</b> <b>I</b> uttered <b>my</b> {{explanations}} awkwardly; {{the master}} frowned. 'It is nothing, is it, Ellen Dean?' he said sternly. 'You shall account more clearly for keeping me ignorant of this!' And {{he took his}} wife in his arms, {{and looked at her}} with anguish.|$|R
60|$|<b>I</b> heard, and <b>felt</b> <b>my</b> passion rise within me, for I could ill bear this fair girl's scorn.|$|R
6000|$|... 'I wish to {{goodness}} you'd stop talking!' he snapped, and {{sat down}} on a chair. Stalky's hand on my shoulder quietly signalled me out of action, but <b>I</b> <b>felt</b> that <b>my</b> fire had not been misdirected.|$|R
60|$|He had {{uttered the}} word. <b>I</b> <b>felt</b> <b>my</b> {{character}} had not a leg left to stand upon before a British jury.|$|E

50|$|Over {{the next}} few years as I tried the ‘lose-weight-without-any-change’ method, as I wore ever tighter clothes, and weighed myself to depression, <b>I</b> <b>felt</b> doomed. <b>My</b> lowest point was the day I weighed myself after a haircut.|$|R
60|$|A presentiment arose within me, that in {{this still}} and solitary hour would occur my decisive, my final {{struggle}} with myself. <b>I</b> <b>felt</b> that <b>my</b> heart's life or death was set on the hazard of the night.|$|R
60|$|So he left me, stiff, formal, having {{satisfied}} his conscience, though <b>I</b> <b>felt</b> in <b>my</b> {{heart that}} {{his opinion of}} me, once formed, was {{not likely to be}} changed. Directly I was alone I opened my uncle's letter.|$|R

60|$|Elsie drew back, all abashed. In {{a moment}} her cheek grew still redder, <b>I</b> <b>felt</b> sure, than <b>my</b> own.|$|R
60|$|I shook open {{an evening}} paper and heard no more. The girl's leavetaking, however, {{a few minutes}} later, was both {{reluctant}} and impressive. <b>I</b> <b>felt</b> it <b>my</b> duty to allude to the matter {{as soon as we}} were alone.|$|R
