The study itself was published in January 2009.|$|E

5|$|<b>In</b> <b>the</b> <b>treatment</b> <b>of</b> {{diabetic}} foot infections, linezolid {{appears to}} be cheaper and more effective than vancomycin. In a 2004 open-label study, it was as effective as ampicillin/sulbactam and Amoxicillin/clavulanic acid, and far superior in patients with foot ulcers and no osteomyelitis, but with significantly higher rates of adverse effects. A 2008 meta-analysis of 18 randomized controlled trials, however, found that linezolid treatment failed as often as other antibiotics, regardless of whether patients had osteomyelitis.|$|E
