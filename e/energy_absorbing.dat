5|$|The {{production}} model utilised the same Alcan bonded honeycomb aluminium structure vehicle technology (ASVT) as the concept {{car for the}} chassis. The chassis design featured two box section rails which acted as the suspension mounting points and would provide an <b>energy</b> <b>absorbing</b> structure {{in the event of}} a frontal impact, these were successfully tested at speeds up to , an integral roll cage formed part of the chassis and monocoque, providing additional structural rigidity for the car and allowing the XJ220 to easily pass stringent crash testing.|$|E
5|$|Holden's {{standardisation}} of six airbags in March 2008 for MY09 {{made the}} VE {{eligible for the}} ANCAP side pole test, yielding additional scoring points. The second stage of the VE's safety rollout in October 2008 for MY09.5 included {{the addition of a}}n <b>energy</b> <b>absorbing</b> steering column shroud and redesigned rear door latches across the VE range. The inclusion of a seat belt reminder on the Omega sedan yielded another point, thus allowing the Omega sedan to score five-stars, or a score of 33.45 when tested the following December. The Omega Sportwagon was the next model to be awarded the full five stars the following February, following the addition of a seat belt reminder in Sportwagon production. The remaining VE models, including the Ute and WM Statesman/Caprice, which had already received most of the safety upgrades, received the seat belt reminder as standard fitment as of MY10 production from August 2009. As a result, all VE sedan and Sportwagon variants along with the extended length WM models received the five-star rating. The VE Ute officially received the rating on 19 October 2009, making the entire line-up of Australian-made Holdens five-star ANCAP rated.|$|E
25|$|The design employs {{extensive}} <b>energy</b> <b>absorbing</b> {{techniques to}} enable survivability and immediate access for emergency vehicles following a Maximum Creditable Earthquake (MCE), estimated at 8.5 moment magnitude in a 1500-year time span. Rather than designing for rigidity, it is instead a flexible structure, with resonant motion {{absorbed by the}} plastic shear of sacrificial, replaceable components. Smaller earthquakes will impose mostly elastic stresses on components, with {{a higher proportion of}} plastic (and thus <b>energy</b> <b>absorbing)</b> stresses in larger earthquakes. This design philosophy extends to other metal components of the bridge, including the sacrificial tubular end keys that align the self-anchored suspension with its approach structures at each end.|$|E

25|$|The first {{implementation}} of the ET-2000 in the United States caused market prices to soar.

25|$|In 2011, Sicking {{turned his}} {{attention}} to impact energy management in sports. Serious neck injuries in hockey are relatively infrequent but can be catastrophic. Impacts with the rigid walls can produce decelerations of over 100 G’s, causing severe concussions and even quadriplegia. Sicking led the creation of <b>energy</b> <b>absorbing</b> walls that have been shown to successfully reduce head decelerations by 50% under severe impact conditions. These walls are designed to flex and extend during impacts, reducing peak G’s on the player’s head by absorbing the energy of the impact. Sicking is now applying this same concept to develop both improved helmet impact performance standards and a helmet that is more flexible and can decouple head rotation from helmet rotation, thus reducing peak G’s on the head.|$|E
25|$|Sicking {{has devoted}} {{his career to}} {{designing}} impact energy management systems, specifically focusing on crashworthy safety systems. Sicking has developed numerous “next generation” designs that have significantly reduced the risk of injury and fatality to motorists, from highway drivers to NASCAR racers. His first global success was the ET-2000, the first <b>energy</b> <b>absorbing</b> guardrail terminal – a device that sits over {{the end of a}} guardrail, flattening the guardrail when it is hit by a vehicle. The first study of the device showed that out of 400 crashes, there were three injuries and no fatalities—reducing the risk by a factor of 10. But even with detailed research data and real-world results showing the product a success, Sicking says he gets the most satisfaction from a personal testimonial.|$|E

The full-sized Ambassador was discontinued as AMC's flagship line after the 1974 model year.

The effect of fruit firmness, drop height and fruit mass on the impact force parameters (coefficient of restitution, percentage of <b>energy</b> <b>absorbed,</b> and coefficient of force-time) was evaluated.

2500|$|The {{down side}} to this {{performance}} is recoil. The amount of recoil the cartridge generates is a step up from the non-magnum [...]30 caliber (7.62mm) cartridges. Its recoil is about 30% {{greater than that of}} the [...]30-06 Springfield, which is known as a 'stout' cartridge. This would put the [...]300 Winchester Magnum at the upper limit of what most shooters can shoot comfortably for extended shooting sessions. As a rough comparison, the recoil of the [...]300 Winchester Magnum is roughly comparable to a 12 gauge shotgun shooting 1 oz. slugs. This greater recoil can make the [...]300 Winchester Magnum, despite its inherent accuracy advantages, a harder cartridge to shoot accurately, when compared to non-magnum [...]30 caliber cartridges such as the [...]30-06 Springfield or the [...]308 Winchester. On the other hand, recoil is subjective (some are more sensitive to it than others) and one can get used to it with practice. Also, many rifles available today now have effective recoil attenuating features built into them, such as muzzle compensators and <b>energy</b> <b>absorbing</b> stocks and butt-pads, that can significantly lessen recoil as it is felt by the shooter.|$|E

This was the first year that a rear sway bar was offered in the Torino and was only available with competition and police suspension options. Front disc brakes became standard on all Torinos, which no other American intermediate (other than its sister car the Mercury Montego) offered in 1972, however, power brakes remained an option.

2500|$|Roger Ebert of the Chicago Sun-Times {{gave the}} film {{three and a}} half stars out of four, the same rating he gave the first film, writing: [...] "In every way the equal of del Toro's {{original}} Hellboy, although perhaps a little noisier, it's another celebration of his love for bizarre fantasy and diabolical machines." [...] Michael Rechtshaffen writing in The Hollywood Reporter said Hellboy II was an uncompromised vision of del Toro's imagination. He said that with the director given free rein, the film came across as an amalgam of the best moments from his previous films, only with better visual effects. John Anderson of Variety wrote of a rococo precision to the visuals that exceeded that of the first film. He cited del Toro's [...] "clockmaker's preoccupation with detail" [...] and ability to blend state-of-the-art technology with more classical visuals as the reasons for the film's success. Owen Gleiberman of Entertainment Weekly said that the plot did not often deviate from its comic-book traditions, but that del Toro staged the action [...] "brilliantly". He said that while the visual effects deserved recognition, what made the film so exciting was the personality they were imbued with. Chuck Wilson of The Village Voice said that del Toro was on autopilot, but that he and his Pan's Labyrinth crew, cinematographer Guillermo Navarro in particular, staged the steady stream of action set-pieces expertly. Mike Goodridge of Screen International wrote that del Toro had retained the B movie tone of the first film, saying the film managed to avoid the self-importance of The Incredible Hulk and the Batman film series and that del Toro was simply a [...] "great storyteller" [...] providing a [...] "good time". Stuart Levine in Premiere praised the visuals and [...] "beautiful" [...] set-pieces, but said del Toro's script fell a little short of his direction. Alonso Duralde writing for msnbc.com said it represented a backwards step for del Toro, saying that despite several creepy sequences, the film was a return to the muddled storytelling and pretty visuals of his pre-Pan's Labyrinth films. He said del Toro's screenplay lacked energy or momentum. However, Peter Bradshaw, of The Guardian said almost the opposite was the case, as he thinks [...] "it is a crackingly enjoyable and exciting sequel, with something that the memory of Pan's Labyrinth might have entirely erased: a sense of humour."
