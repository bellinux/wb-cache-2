5|$|The {{damaging}} {{effects of}} ionising radiation were not {{known at the}} time of her work, which had been carried out without the safety measures later developed. She had carried test tubes containing radioactive isotopes in her pocket, and she stored them in her <b>desk</b> <b>drawer,</b> remarking on the faint light that the substances gave off in the dark. Curie was also exposed to X-rays from unshielded equipment while serving as a radiologist in field hospitals during the war. Although her many decades of exposure to radiation caused chronic illnesses (including near-blindness due to cataracts) and ultimately her death, she never really acknowledged the health risks of radiation exposure.|$|E
5|$|Sarah (Hana Hayes) is Joel's twelve-year-old daughter, whom he {{had when}} he was in his late teens, and the game's first playable character. The posters and photos on her wall suggest that she was a keen soccer player. At the start of the game, she gives her father a new watch for his birthday. In the early hours of the next day, she is awoken by a commotion and the sound of Tommy phoning Joel. Later, Joel bursts into his office, pulls a {{revolver}} out of his <b>desk</b> <b>drawer</b> and shoots their neighbor. Sarah leaves with Tommy and Joel, but her leg is hurt in a crash, forcing Joel to carry her. On the outskirts of their hometown, they come across a soldier, who follows his orders and shoots at them. Sarah is fatally wounded by bullets and dies in Joel's arms.|$|E
5|$|Tammi Peyton enters AAA-1 Surekill Exterminators {{and plays}} her message machine, which {{contains}} the victim's {{phone call from}} the previous night. She attempts to get into her right <b>desk</b> <b>drawer,</b> when Dwight walks in, and begins harassing her about a message on the machine. She mentions the murder to Dwight, and he responds by asking her to try to get Randall on the phone. Dwight then confronts Randall in the alley; Dwight tells him that he doesn't mind what he does, as long as he asks first. Later, Scully and Doggett investigate the Chase residence and find a bullet casing on the floor. Doggett notes that {{it would be difficult to}} miss a target in a confined space, but Scully notes it would have if the gunman was shooting from outside. Eventually, Scully proposes that the killer can perceive wave lengths of light not visible with an ordinary human eye, allowing him to virtually see through walls.|$|E

While the creatures try to escape, Henry discovers Grandpa and Dinky, not knowing who—or what—they are. Augustus also sees them, but mistaking them for toys, grabs them from Henry and locks them in the <b>desk</b> <b>drawer</b> in his study. Here, Dinky and Grandpa discover that Augustus forged the documents {{in order to become}} Henry's legal guardian, as well as to steal and redevelop the Biggs' property.|$|E

[...] When Kyla discovered a small supply in his <b>desk</b> <b>drawer,</b> she assumed he was HIV positive, and after failing to extract a confession from Abra, terminated their relationship.

Good luck" [...] exchange. Nina is shown drinking from the poisoned cup one of two times she admiringly calls Squires [...] "devious" [...] (a hint at her true feelings about him) and once again when she emphasises the word [...] "plan". While Squires is telling the story of the Sphinx and she seems to be gazing at the statue of it, she's actually looking at the photograph of her brother on display directly below.|$|E
500|$|Mayhew {{alludes to}} [...] "the story of Solomon's mammy", a {{reference}} to Bathsheba, who gave birth to Solomon after her lover David had her husband Uriah killed. Although Audrey cuts Mayhew off by praising his book (which Audrey herself may have written), the reference foreshadows the love triangle which evolves among the three characters of Barton Fink. Rowell points out that Mayhew is murdered (presumably by Charlie) soon after Barton and Audrey have sex. Another Biblical reference comes when Barton flips {{to the front of}} the Bible in his <b>desk</b> <b>drawer</b> and sees his own words transposed into the Book of Genesis. This is seen as a representation of his hubris as self-conceived omnipotent master of creation, or alternatively, as a playful juxtaposition demonstrating Barton's hallucinatory state of mind.|$|E

50|$|Since Mancusi had {{not gone}} into great detail about how DeForte had a {{reasonable}} expectation of privacy in a shared workspace, cases in lower courts resolved those issues. Personal, individual and secured spaces, such as a police officer's locker or school guidance counselor's <b>desk</b> <b>drawers,</b> were held during the 1970s to be protected by the Fourth Amendment. It was more difficult to resolve cases where those factors were not present.|$|R

500|$|After the fiasco at the bar, Mulder and Scully meet. She sadly tells Mulder {{that she}} does not think he and Fletcher can be {{returned}} to their own bodies. However, soon after that, the warp caused by the alien craft begins to snap back and repair the natural order of the universe. Grodin, realizing that everything will be fixed naturally, gathers up Lana Chee and the pilot. Scully and Fletcher arrive at Fletcher’s home, and see Mulder standing by the moving truck. Joanne Fletcher berates Mulder about Scully but he insists that he and Fletcher have swapped bodies. Fletcher goes to help Joanne move a chair and confesses that Mulder is telling the truth. He tells her enough of their past to convince her he is Morris Fletcher. Jeff Smoodge and a group of troops appear at Fletcher's home and detain Mulder, Fletcher, Scully and the flight data recorder in their car. Grodin explains that he is restoring everything and that he reversed the body-swap between the pilot and the old Hopi woman. The warp passes over them and the past few days are rewritten. Mulder and Fletcher are restored to their own bodies and returned to the moment when Fletcher’s troops pulled them over on the highway. This time no ship passes overhead and Mulder and Scully leave uneventfully. After Mulder and Scully leave the highway near area 51, Scully calls from FBI headquarters to tell Mulder that they have escaped reprimand from Director Kersh for going to Nevada. Scully opens her <b>desk</b> <b>drawer</b> to place a file inside and finds the penny and dime that were fused together from the event at the gas station in her <b>desk</b> <b>drawer</b> indicating that while some things have reversed themselves, not everything has. [...] Mulder enters his apartment and finds that Morris Fletcher has completely reorganized and cleaned his apartment and both Mulder and Scully are left to puzzle over their recollection of events.|$|E

Meanwhile, at the salvage yard, Odell is shredding documents when Ray appears. Harry feigns friendliness while he gets the shotgun out of his <b>desk</b> <b>drawer.</b> He blasts Ray through a sliding glass door. Ray’s detached arm begins to rebuild itself with metal. Harry is transfixed by this sight as Ray kills him. The next morning, Doggett checks out the new murder scene and finds an interesting shredded document. Doggett goes to Chamber Technologies and learns about [...] "smart metals"—metals that rebuild their original forms but are still a metallurgist’s pipe dream at the moment. On the phone, Doggett mentions the [...] "smart metals" [...] and Scully tells Doggett about how Ray Pearce’s medical records show his whole cellular structure was changing due to exposure to an unknown substance. Meanwhile, Larina sees Ray’s obituary in the paper and is watching the television news story about the murder at the salvage yard. She decides to call Ray’s widow.|$|E
500|$|Due to Harrison's {{extensive}} {{knowledge of}} the X-Files, the episode contains several references to previous episodes. While looking through her <b>desk</b> <b>drawer,</b> Scully finds the merged coin from the sixth season entry [...] "Dreamland"; the Apollo 11 space flight medallion, which was given to her by Mulder in the fourth season episode [...] "Tempus Fugit"; and her dog Queequeg's name tag, which she was given in the third season episode [...] "Clyde Bruckman's Final Repose". While investigating, Harrison mentions a liver-eating mutant that produced bile and died under an escalator, a reference to Eugene Victor Tooms, who appeared in the first season episodes [...] "Squeeze" [...] and [...] "Tooms"; aliens that shed their skin and leave behind a residue similar to mucus, {{a reference to the}} alien from [...] "The Beginning"; and subterranean men in Florida who took people underground, as featured in [...] "Detour". While searching through Stites' house, Doggett finds a book entitled The Sixth Extinction, a potential reference to the seventh season episode of the same name. In the episode's final scene, Harrison asks Mulder how he and Scully managed to return to America after escaping from a spaceship in Antarctica, a reference to an event that took place {{at the end of the}} 1998 X-Files feature film.|$|E

Forty-eight of the desks date back to 1819, when the Senate chamber was reconstructed after the original contents were destroyed in the 1812 Burning of Washington. Further desks of similar design were added as new states entered the Union. It is a tradition that each senator who uses a desk inscribes their name {{on the inside of the}} <b>desk's</b> <b>drawer.</b>|$|R
50|$|It {{was pure}} chance that first drew Grierson's {{attention}} to numismatics. A {{visit to the}} family home at Christmas 1944 or shortly thereafter produced a bronze Byzantine coin {{from one of his}} father's <b>desk</b> <b>drawers.</b> It was later identified as an issue {{in the name of the}} emperor Phocas, and inspired Grierson to visit Spink's in London. There, he expressed no intention of ever becoming a serious collector, and wished only to purchase £5 of coins to serve as illustrative material in his lectures.|$|R
500|$|The Danville Political Club, a debating {{society which}} existed between 1786 and 1790, {{frequently}} held its {{meetings at the}} tavern. Many members of this society {{went on to become}} prominent political leaders at the state and national levels. Eleven of the Club's thirty members would participate in {{at least one of the}} ten constitutional conventions that helped separate Kentucky from Virginia. Among the members were Kentucky's first Secretary of State (and future U.S. Senator from Louisiana), James Brown; its third governor, Christopher Greenup; chief justice of the Kentucky Court of Appeals, George Muter; federal judges Harry Innes, William McClung, and Samuel McDowell; Congressmen Willis Green, Stephen Ormsby, Thomas Speed, David Walker, and Matthew Walton; U.S. Senator John Brown; and Thomas Todd, a justice of the Supreme Court of the United States. The existence of the club was lost to history until Speed's grandson, Thomas Speed II, discovered extensive minutes of its meetings that his grandfather, the club secretary, had taken and stored in a <b>desk</b> <b>drawer.</b> The younger Speed later published these minutes with his own commentary about the club, in which he opined that [...] "Full and complete biographies of some of the members would present a history of Kentucky from the beginning of its settlement past the first quarter of the ensuing century." [...] One of the few extant references to the Club outside Speed's meeting minutes is an entry in the journal of a U.S. Army paymaster named Major Beatty; while staying overnight at Grayson's Tavern, Beatty recorded that he and his companions were [...] "very much disturbed by a Political Club which met in the next house where we slept and kept us awake till 12 or 1 o'clock." ...|$|E
