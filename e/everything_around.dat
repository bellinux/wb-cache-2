5|$|Before season 20, {{little was}} shown {{concerning}} Cartman's romantic interests, {{as for the}} most part, his attitude towards females had been sexist. However, at least in one episode ("Chef Goes Nanners"), Cartman develops an attraction to Wendy, which is apparent {{from the end of}} episode when Wendy describes her temporary infatuation towards Cartman as 'sexual tension' and even though Cartman agrees in front of Wendy, he sighs with sorrow at being alone again. During a period when he was physically unable to control his speech and he repeatedly blurted hidden feelings, he expressed a romantic interest in classmate Patty Nelson, a side character who has not been seen before or since. In Season 20, after Cartman is wrongfully accused of being a persistent and highly aggressive internet troll (actually Gerald Broflovski) leaving foul posts primarily targeting women and girls on South Park Elementary's school message boards, the other boys destroy most of Cartman's electronics, and by extension, his social media presence, causing him to become despondent to <b>everything</b> <b>around</b> him. That is until Heidi Turner, who had quit social media in response to the trolling, offers to show him life outside of social media. The two quickly become friends, and later, an official and shockingly very happy couple.|$|E
5|$|In The Simpsons twentieth {{episode of}} the twentieth season, Four Great Women and a Manicure is loosely based on Macbeth. In the third act of the episode, Marge embodies Lady Macbeth, an ambitious wife who is {{frustrated}} by <b>everything</b> <b>around</b> her. She not only has to clean the costumes worn by other actors, but is also frustrated {{over the fact that}} Homer doesn't have any interest in auditioning for lead roles and would rather play a tree. She convinces him to kill Sideshow Mel and he does to assume the lead role of Macbeth. When Marge learns that no one cares for Homer's lack of acting skills over Hibbert's and those with no lines, she forces him to kill off everyone else until he's the only actor left. The angry spirits visit her that night and she tries to pin the blame on Homer. They refuse to believe Marge by pointing out that they knew he was a victim in her devious plans and get their revenge on her by killing her in a fright induced heart attack. Even though Homer gives Marge's ghost a promising performance, he eventually frustrates her more by killing himself so he doesn't have to audition for more Shakespearean plays. This forces Marge to learn her lesson the hard way when she must spend eternity with a lazy and happy Homer.|$|E

5|$|Izumi {{suggests}} {{that in the first}} six days, Makoto had been deceived by her and Okuhiko, but rather than believing in premonitions had believed he had traveled back in time. When Izumi died on April 6, and Makoto had desired to travel back in time, Curé Syndrome manifested. She {{suggests that}} while he had thought that he was traveling back in time, he had only imagined a different past where events played out differently, as part of a delusion, and that he had given himself partial memories in the form of premonitions in each loop; in the last loop, he would have given himself all his memories, other than the knowledge that he is experiencing a delusion. She says that once Makoto succeeds in saving her, he will break out of the delusion, and the six days in his delusion will become reality. Makoto refuses to believe her, claiming that <b>everything</b> <b>around</b> him is reality, but starts to doubt throughout the week. Depending on the player's choices, the route branches into two endings. In one, the delusions appear to be changing reality, but are revealed to be a chain of coincidences. In the other, the delusions do change reality, and Makoto wakes up {{at the bottom of the}} cliff he fell down at the end of the last loop, badly wounded from having protected Izumi during the fall. It is left ambiguous as to what is real and what is a delusion, and whether Makoto has escaped to reality or still is trapped in his delusion.|$|E

He pointed out that nature is full of {{theatrical}} conventions: desert flowers mimicking the stones; mouse feigning death in order to escape a cat's claws; complicated dances of birds, etc. He viewed theatre as a universal symbol of existence.|$|E

25|$|Semiotics {{of culture}} is a {{research}} field within semiotics that attempts to define culture from semiotic perspective and {{as a type of}} human symbolic activity, creation of signs and a way of giving meaning to <b>everything</b> <b>around.</b> Therefore, here culture is understood as a system of symbols or meaningful signs. Because the main sign system is the linguistic system, the field is usually referred to as semiotics of culture and language. Under this field of study symbols are analyzed and categorized in certain class within the hierarchal system. With postmodernity, metanarratives are no longer as pervasive and thus categorizing these symbols in this postmodern age is more difficult and rather critical.|$|E
25|$|When the Doctor {{activates}} the Time Destructor—a {{device that}} accelerates time—as {{part of his}} plan to stop the Daleks, he orders his companions back to the TARDIS for their protection. However, Sara follows him, not knowing {{the nature of his}} plan but concerned it might fail. As a result, she and the Doctor are both caught in the field of the Time Destructor as it rapidly ages <b>everything</b> <b>around</b> it. While the Doctor, being a Time Lord, can withstand the worst of the effects—merely becoming an even older man—Sara, being human, cannot. As Steven watches helplessly, Sara ages (being portrayed as an old woman by May Warden) and dies, her remains aging to dust. Steven attempts to rescue his friends; he, too, is briefly affected and ages, before he reverses the Time Destructor. This rejuvenates himself and the Doctor back to their previous ages, but does not save Sara.|$|E

25|$|If the Standard Model is correct, the {{particles}} and forces we observe in our universe exist {{as they do}} because of underlying quantum fields. Quantum fields can have states of differing stability, including 'stable', 'unstable', or 'metastable' (meaning very long-lived but not completely stable). If a more stable vacuum state were able to arise, then existing particles and forces would no longer arise {{as they do in}} the universe's present state. Different particles or forces would arise from (and be shaped by) whatever new quantum states arose. The world we know depends upon these particles and forces, so if this happened, <b>everything</b> <b>around</b> us, from subatomic particles to galaxies, and all fundamental forces, would be reconstituted into new fundamental particles and forces and structures. The universe would lose all of its present structures and become inhabited by new ones (depending upon the exact states involved) based upon the same quantum fields.|$|E

Arsenal's assistant coach Emma Hayes described Chapman as [...] "a rock that makes <b>everything</b> <b>around</b> her better.

500|$|Numerous {{layers of}} metaphors are present {{throughout}} The Downward Spiral, leaving it open to wide interpretation. The album relays nihilism and {{is defined by}} a prominent theme of self-abuse and self-control. It is a semi-autobiographical concept album, in which the overarching plot follows the protagonist's descent into madness in his own inner solipsistic world through a metaphorical [...] "downward spiral", dealing with religion, dehumanization, violence, disease, society, drugs, sex, and finally, suicide. Reznor described the concept as consisting of [...] "someone who sheds <b>everything</b> <b>around</b> them to a potential nothingness, but through career, religion, relationship, belief and so on." [...] Media journalists like The New York Times writer Jon Pareles noted the album's theme of angst had already been used by grunge bands like Nirvana, and that Nine Inch Nails' depiction was more generalized.|$|E
500|$|The two {{visual effects}} {{companies}} {{for the film}} were Industrial Light & Magic (ILM) and Image Engine, with overall supervision by Jesper Kjölsrud and Grady Cofer. In total, the film has over 400 visual effects shots. ILM was responsible only for creating a helicopter crash sequence in the film. Berg requested that the sequence be done by ILM, who had also worked on his previous film Battleship. Image Engine's effects work consisted mainly of set extensions and location enhancements; scenes were supplemented with computer-generated mountains, buildings and backgrounds, as well as muzzle flashes for firearms. Film editor Colby Parker Jr. explained, [...] "The sets of the villages were {{only one or two}} huts and then Image Engine built <b>everything</b> <b>around</b> those. Same for the SEAL base. There were only a few real buildings and from that they built out a larger base." ...|$|E
500|$|Hidden {{behind his}} wall, Pink becomes {{severely}} depressed. In {{order to get}} him to perform, a doctor medicates him. This results in a hallucinatory on-stage performance where he believes that he is a fascist dictator performing at concerts similar to Neo-Nazi rallies, at which he sets brownshirts-like men on fans he considers unworthy. [...] Upon realizing the horror of what he has done, Pink becomes overwhelmed and wishes for <b>everything</b> <b>around</b> him to cease. Showing human emotion, he is tormented with guilt and places himself on trial, his inner judge ordering him to [...] "tear down the wall", opening Pink to the outside world. The album turns full circle with its closing words [...] "Isn't this where ...", the first words of the phrase that begins the album, [...] "... we came in?", with a continuation of the melody of the last song hinting at the cyclical nature of Waters' theme.|$|E

500|$|Observers {{commented that}} California Chrome {{appears to be}} a very {{intelligent}} horse, as he expresses curiosity about <b>everything</b> <b>around</b> him. His idiosyncrasies, included a fondness for one specific brand of horse cookies. [...] His tendency to perform a flehmen response for no obvious reason, particularly when being bathed, prompted the press to claim that he is [...] "smiling". He will deliberately stop and put his ears forward to [...] "pose" [...] for cameras when he hears them clicking. As Alan Sherman explained, [...] "He's a ham"; and exercise rider Willie Delgado gave him an additional nickname, [...] "Vogue". As a younger horse, notably in 2014, he would not walk forward out of horse vans designed for a forward exit; he would only back out, a quirk discovered by the press when he was first unloaded off of an airplane. At the Sherman stables, he had a green tetherball in his stall to play with, but his worst bad habit is that he sometimes bites.|$|E

She flees and meets Jem (Tuppence Middleton) and Damien (Ian Bonar). Jem and the woman escape the masked man, who kills Damien.

500|$|Ruth Glancy, a {{professor}} of English literature, states that the largest impact of A Christmas Carol was the influence felt by individual readers. In the spring of 1844 The Gentleman's Magazine attributed a rise of charitable giving in Britain to Dickens's novella; in 1874, Robert Louis Stevenson, after reading Dickens's Christmas books, vowed to give generously to those in need; and Thomas Carlyle expressed a generous hospitality by hosting two Christmas dinners after reading the book. In 1867 one American businessman was so moved after attending a reading, that he closed his factory on Christmas Day and sent every employee a turkey, while {{in the early years}} of the 20th century the Queen of Norway sent gifts to London's crippled children signed [...] "With Tiny Tim's Love". On the novella, the author G. K.
