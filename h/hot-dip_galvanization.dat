The imperial grades are made to the same strength specifications as ASTM A354 grade BD. The metric grades are made to the same strength specifications as ASTM F568M property class 10.9. Also, unlike their weaker counterparts they cannot be coated by <b>hot-dip</b> <b>galvanization,</b> mechanical deposition, or electroplating.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Hot-dip</b> <b>galvanization</b> {{is a form}} of galvanization. It is {{the process}} of coating iron and steel with zinc, which alloys with the surface of the base metal when {{immersing}} the metal in a bath of molten zinc at a temperature of around 840 F. When exposed to the atmosphere, the pure zinc (Zn) reacts with oxygen (O2) to form zinc oxide (ZnO), which further reacts with carbon dioxide (CO2) to form zinc carbonate (ZnCO3), a usually dull grey, fairly strong material that protects the steel underneath from further corrosion in many circumstances. Galvanized steel is widely used in applications where corrosion resistance is needed without the cost of stainless steel, and is considered superior in terms of cost and life-cycle. It can be identified by the crystallization patterning on the surface (often called a [...] "spangle").|$|E
40|$|Processes of the <b>hot-dip</b> <b>galvanization,</b> refraining from {{application}} of dangerous chemical substances {{together with the}} necessity of ensuring the high temperatures, both pose a special threat to the environment. Therefore, the subject of analysis was environmental impact of the <b>hot-dip</b> <b>galvanization</b> process. Here has been done the identification and {{the assessment of the}} environmental aspects as well as has been pointed at the key-aspects requiring the special supervision. The developed assessment methodology can be applied by each of the organization wanting to master the processes by minimizing their environmental influence...|$|E
40|$|This {{study shows}} that {{vegetable}} oil like linseed oil {{can be used as}} flux in <b>hot-dip</b> <b>galvanization.</b> The natural fatty acids contained in them {{seem to be able to}} play similar role of chloride flux usually used. Moreover, it is also possible to use a mineral oil with an added acid function. “Pure” mineral oil well protects the steel from corrosion but leads to a very bad result in galvanization. When an acid function is added to this mineral oil, for example by an addition of hydrochloric acid, the result in galvanization is very good. The coat thickness and the inter-metallic composition depend not on the nature of the flux...|$|E
40|$|The {{topic of}} this thesis is the {{interaction}} between gas jet flow and a liquid film dragged by a solid substrate. This method, known as jet-wiping, is used in several industrial processes. <b>Hot-dip</b> <b>galvanization</b> of steel strips is an important application, where jet wiping is used to control {{the thickness of the}} liquid zinc that is applied on a continuous steel substrate. Unsteady phenomena in the process lead to the creation of waves on the liquid film, which is known as undulation. This unwanted phenomenon deteriorates the quality of the final product. The aim of the current study is to identify the causes of the undulation and propose possible solutions to tackle the problem. This is achieved through studying the hydrodynamic interaction between the gas jet flow and the liquid film. Experiments on a laboratory test facility and numerical simulations with 3 different Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) codes are employed for that purpose.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{part of a}} study {{aimed at}} ﬁnding a suitable, yet cost-effective, surface ﬁnish for a steel structure subject to the car washing environment and corrosive chemicals. The initial, life cycle and average equivalent annual (AEAC) costs for surface ﬁnishing methods were calculated for a steel structure using the LCCC algorithm developed by American Galvanizers Association (AGA). The cost study consisted of 45 common surface ﬁnish systems including: <b>hot-dip</b> <b>galvanization</b> (HDG), metallization, acrylic, alkyd and epoxy as well as duplex coatings such as epoxy zinc and inorganic zinc (IOZ). The results show that initial, life cycle and AEAC costs for hot dip galvanization are the lowest among all the other methods, followed by coal tar epoxy painting. The annual average cost of HDG for this structure was estimated about € 0. 22 /m 2, while the other cost-effective alternatives were: IOZ, polyurea, epoxy waterborne and IOZ/epoxy duplex coating.

40|$|In this paper, an {{efficient}} and inexpensive absorber-plate for flat-plate collectors, produced in Turkey, is presented. The study gives {{the analysis and}} the optimization of the spacing of the pipes, thickness of the plates, and diameters of pipes for one type of material; galvanized iron. In the analysis, both material price and manufacturing processes are considered. The useful energy collection from the flat-plate collector per price of the absorber-plate is taken into account during the optimization process. The new absorber-plate is manufactured using <b>hot-dip</b> <b>galvanization</b> of iron and point welding. The absorber plate’s efficiency and price are determined together with those of three commercially available collectors manufactured in Turkey, absorber-plates of which {{are made up of}} aluminum and copper (ISTEK Aluminum and Copper, DAGSAN-Copper). For ISTEK’s aluminum collector, the intercept of the efficiency curve is 0. 90, for ISTEK’s copper collector, it is 0. 66. For DAGSAN’s copper the intercept is 0. 81, and for the collector that has galvanized iron absorber-plate it is 0. 82, which is increased to 0. 83 after new optimization. The price of the manufactured absorber-plate is $ 23. After new optimization the price is increased to $ 25. The cost of ISTEK’s aluminum collector it is $ 53, for ISTEK’s copper collector is $ 32, and for DAGSAN’s copper collector is $ 53. Time constants of the tested collectors ar...|$|E
40|$|<b>Hot-dip</b> <b>galvanization</b> {{is one of}} {{the oldest}} and {{reliable}} commercial methods for protection of steel against corrosion. To achieve a homogeneous surface reaction, and hence a uniform zinc alloy coating, the surface of the work must be chemically prepared by a series of treatments before dipping in zinc. These usually include degreasing, to remove oil or grease from the surface of the work, acid pickling to remove iron oxides such as rust or scale, and fluxing to activate the surface and promote reaction with zinc. With a past reputation as a “dirty industry ’ galvanizers have abated environmental impact and currently recycle the majority of solid waste zinc products. However, by far the greatest quantity of waste produced by galvanizers is the sludge resulted from the neutralization of the spent acid. Pickling is carried out in hydrochloric acid. Spent pickling acid is a solution containing various concentrations of HCl, FeCl 2 and ZnCl 2. The residual acid is neutralized with lime, so the residual waters can be discharged to the sewerage and the solid precipitates are sent in the most of the cases to landfill. This treatment process results in all potentially valuable iron and zinc being lost. In this paper we tried to put in good use the valuable metals from the sludge by recovering the iron ions under iron red pigment form, which can be used at the construction materials obtaining. The zinc ions from the sludge were removed by extraction in ammonium solution and the residual sludge was incinerated and the resulted iron oxide was submit to thermogravimetric and X-ray diffraction analysis to establish if this can be used as iron red pigment...|$|E
