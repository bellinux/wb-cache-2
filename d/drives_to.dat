5|$|In some countries, {{the need}} for more land for housing is {{threatening}} small airfields.

5|$|The {{pre-production}} Griffon I {{shared the}} R engine's bore and stroke, but was otherwise {{a completely new}} design that first ran in the Experimental Department in November 1939. Although this single engine was never flown, the production version, the Griffon II, first flew in 1941 installed in the Fairey Firefly. A {{significant difference between the}} R and the production Griffon was the re-location of the camshaft and supercharger <b>drives</b> <b>to</b> the front of the engine to reduce overall length. Another length-reducing measure was the use of a single magneto (the R had two, mounted at the rear), this again was moved {{to the front of the}} engine.|$|E

A specialized type of RAM called flash RAM is used in USB flash drives and more recently, solid-state <b>drives</b> <b>to</b> replace mechanically rotating magnetic disc hard disk drives. Solid state devices became prevalent in the 1950s and the 1960s, during the transition from vacuum tubes to semiconductor diodes, transistors, integrated circuit (IC) and the light-emitting diode (LED).|$|E
