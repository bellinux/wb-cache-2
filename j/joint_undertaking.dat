25|$|Coal mining in India has a {{long history}} of {{commercial}} exploitation starting in 1774 with John Sumner and Suetonius Grant Heatly of the East India Company in the Raniganj Coalfield along the Western bank of Damodar River. Demand for coal remained low until the introduction of steam locomotives in 1853. After this, production rose to an annual average of 1 Mt and India produced 6.12 Mt per year by 1900 and 18 Mt per year by 1920, following increased demand in the First World War, but went through a slump in the early thirties. The production reached a level of 29 Mt by 1942 and 30 Mt by 1946. After independence, the country embarked upon five-year development plans. At the beginning of the 1st Plan, annual production went up to 33 Mt. During the 1st Plan period, the need for increasing coal production efficiently by systematic and scientific development of the coal industry was being felt. Setting up the National Coal Development Corporation (NCDC), a Government of India undertaking, in 1956 with the collieries owned by the railways as its nucleus was the first major step towards planned development of Indian Coal Industry. Along with the Singareni Collieries Company Ltd. (SCCL) which was already in operation since 1945 and which became a government company under the control of Government of Andhra Pradesh in 1956, India thus had two Government coal companies in the fifties. SCCL is now a <b>joint</b> <b>undertaking</b> of Government of Telangana and Government of India.|$|E

[...] During the next eight years, the LPO appeared nearly a hundred times at the Queen's Hall for the Royal Philharmonic Society alone, played for Beecham's opera seasons at Covent Garden, and made more than 300 gramophone records. Berta Geissmar, his secretary from 1936, wrote, [...] "The relations between the Orchestra and Sir Thomas were always easy and cordial.

2500|$|In 1903, a {{reconstruction}} project began to remove grade crossings {{along the line}} {{as part of the}} [...] "Brighton Beach Improvement," [...] which also rebuilt stations of the Brooklyn, Flatbush and Coney Island Railroad and electrified the line due to increased ridership on the line. When on the surface, the station was a division point at which short turned elevated trains of the Fulton Street El terminated. After grade crossings on the line were fully eliminated in 1908, the station became a through stop for all services; at this time it was given the name Newkirk Avenue. On {{the eastern side of the}} station entrance building there is a plaque, which reads: [...] "The Depression and Elevation of this railroad to abolish grade crossings was authorized by the Legislature May 9th, 1903. A <b>joint</b> <b>undertaking</b> between the City Of New York and the Brooklyn Heights R.R. Co. under the direction of the Brooklyn Grade Crossing Commission. .....

2500|$|During {{the time}} of Colnett's first voyage two other British ships, owned by John Meares and his partners, were trading on the North West coast. Meares had chosen not to pay for {{licenses}} from the East India Company and South Sea Company, instead striving to conceal the ship's illegal conduct by using the Portuguese flag. During the winter of 1788-89 the owners of all four vessels decided to form a joint venture {{under the protection of}} the licenses, although the South Sea Company license applied only to the Prince of Wales and Princess Royal. The joint venture had no firm name; Meares called it variously [...] "The Associated Merchants of London and India" [...] or [...] "The United Company of British Merchants Trading to the North West Coast of America". Colnett called it [...] "The South Sea Company of London". It was loosely referred to as [...] "this united Company". In early 1789 Colnett was given command of the <b>joint</b> <b>undertaking</b> as a whole. He was made captain of the Argonaut and given command over its tender, the Princess Royal, under Thomas Hudson. The goal of the joint venture was not just to send vessels to the North West coast but also to set up a permanent trading post at Nootka Sound, to be named Fort Pitt. Meares claimed he had purchased land there from Chief Maquinna of the Nuu-chah-nulth (Nootka) people. The post could be built on Meares's land. Later, the question of whether Meares had actually acquired land from Maquinna become an issue of contention. Even if he had there were unresolvable questions about the amount of land purchased and its location. In time Chief Maquinna denied that any such purchase had been made, saying instead that the Spanish had the only rightful claim to land at Nootka Sound. Meares, one of the primary forces behind the venture, hoped that a permanent post at Nootka Sound would establish his own dominance in the lucrative marine fur trade. However, before the British ships arrived Spanish forces had already occupied the harbour and established their own fort. By the time Colnett's Argonaut arrived at Nootka Sound, {{the first phase of the}} crisis had already begun. The Spanish had taken control of the port and seized Captain Douglas and his ship.|$|E
60|$|It may be {{imagined}} that the squire would have less scruple in addressing the doctor on this matter than his wife would feel; and that his part of their present <b>joint</b> <b>undertaking</b> was less difficult than hers.

Perhaps she felt that to do so would be {{to put an end to}} their scheme, since then by argument, blandishments, threats, force, or appeal to their sense of loyalty, it mattered not which, he would bring about its abandonment. But she wanted to fulfil that scheme, to be free of Bambatse, its immemorial ruins, its graveyard cave, and the ghoul, Jacob Meyer, who could delve among dead bones and in living hearts with equal skill and insight, and yet was unable to find the treasure that lay beneath either of them.|$|E

60|$|I {{translated}} {{this speech}} to Lord Ragnall. It made him laugh, at which I was glad for up till then I {{had not seen}} him even smile. I should add {{that in addition to}} these sporting weapons there were no fewer than fifty military rifles of the best make, they were large-bore Sniders that had just then been put upon the market, and with them, packed in tin cases, a great quantity of ammunition. Although the regulations were not so strict then as they are now, I met {{with a great deal of}} difficulty in getting all this armament through the Customs. Lord Ragnall however had letters from the Colonial Office to such authorities as ruled in Natal, and on our giving a <b>joint</b> <b>undertaking</b> that they were for defensive purposes only in unexplored territory and not for sale, they were allowed through. Fortunate did it prove for us in after days that this matter was arranged.|$|E
60|$|It is {{proposed}} {{in this book}} to present in as orderly an arrangement as the necessarily diffused nature of the subject admits, certain speculations about the trend of present forces, speculations which, taken all together, will build up an imperfect and very hypothetical, but sincerely intended forecast of the way things will probably go in this new century.[1] Necessarily diffidence {{will be one of}} the graces of the performance. Hitherto such forecasts have been presented almost invariably in the form of fiction, and commonly the provocation of the satirical opportunity has been too much for the writer;[2] the narrative form becomes more and more of a nuisance as the speculative inductions become sincerer, and here it will be abandoned altogether in favour of a texture of frank inquiries and arranged considerations. Our utmost aim is a rough sketch of the coming time, a prospectus, as it were, of the <b>joint</b> <b>undertaking</b> of mankind in facing these impending years. The reader is a prospective shareholder--he and his heirs--though whether he will find this anticipatory balance-sheet to his belief or liking is another matter.|$|E
