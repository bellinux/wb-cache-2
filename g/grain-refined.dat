In the presence of a notch there was evidence of an increase in transition temperature of 10 35 C in the semi-killed steel but no increase in the aluminium <b>grain-refined</b> steel.

40|$|Steels {{with higher}} {{strength}} and better formability are increasingly {{required by the}} automotive industry because they can provide higher safety, reduce energy consumption and thus lead to a better environmental protection. To meet these requirements, it is a sustainable effort for steel industry to develop high strength formable steels. One of the commonly used methods for such a development is micro-alloying, that is, the addition of micro-alloying elements such as niobium, vanadium and titanium {{at a level of}} only a few hundredths of a weight percent results in a very pronounced strength-enhancing effect on the steels, provided that an appropriate heat treatment is applied. It is understood that the strength-enhancing effect primarily arises from a strong reduction in the average grain size of the ferrite, originating from the <b>grain-refining</b> effect during the austenisation treatment. The reason for the <b>grain-refining</b> effect is that the micro-alloying elements have a very strong affinity for the interstitial elements such as carbon and nitrogen, leading to the precipitation of extremely fine and widely distributed precipitates. The existence of the precipitates prevents the growth of austenite grains by means of Zener pinning. Therefore it is an essential issue for steel industry to have an accurate control of the nucleation and growth of the precipitates during thermomechanical processing of the steels. In this thesis we focus on several models describing the nucleation and growth of precipitates. This PhD research focusses on this subject.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} a study concerning the toughness anisotropic behavior of two {{high-strength low-alloy steel}} sheets having ferrite-martensite (dual-phase) and ferrite-perlite <b>grain-refined</b> structures. The anisotropic behavior quantification was possible through tension and Charpy impact tests. It has been concluded that mechanical resistance has higher values in the longitudinal direction for both steels, and the inverse occurs for ductility. This could be explained with the microstructure preferential orientation with rolling direction. The higher tensile strength found in dual-phase steel {{is related to the}} presence of martensite islands, and the higher yield strength found in ferrite-perlite <b>grain-refined</b> steel is related to the fine structure observed. The higher toughness is a ferrite-perlite <b>grain-refined</b> steel characteristic, and this could be explained with the presence of only globular-oxide type inclusions, which reduces fracture nucleation sites, and does not promote fracture easy-propagation. Sulfide type inclusions found in dual-phase steel, associated with globular-oxide ones, give to this material a more brittle behavior. Toughness anisotropy is clearly noted, and in both cases the highest values are found in the longitudinal direction, related to the preferential inclusion alignment achieved in rolling. The low ductile-to-brittle transition temperature found in both steels, however, could be related to the very fine structures found...|$|E

40|$|<b>Grain-refined</b> Pd-Cu-Ga dental alloys solidify with a {{lamellar}} {{microstructural constituent}} that affects {{a variety of}} clinically relevant properties. While formation of this constituent {{has been attributed to}} eutectic solidification, an alternative mechanism of discontinuous precipitation has been proposed. Using a representative <b>grain-refined</b> Pd-Cu-Ga dental alloy, casting procedures involving two different rates of solidification were used: (a) A standard thin-walled coping configuration for a metal-ceramic restoration was cast into a room temperature mold, followed by rapid quenching into an ice-water mixture. (b) A thin plate specimen was cast into a standard elevated-temperature mold, with the same subsequent rapid quenching procedure. Neither casting was subjected to the standard air-abrasion procedure following devesting that is used in dental laboratories. An outer surface layer, approximately one grain thick, containing only the palladium solid solution, was observed in the microstructures of the two different castings, and the eutectic constituent was present at greater depths. This observation is consistent with physical metallurgy principles for the freezing of an alloy containing a eutectic constituent, and the alternate hypothesis that the lamellar constituents might represent discontinuous precipitates has been discarded...|$|E

Precipitation of chromium nitride occurring at these lower temperatures has been argued to be the factor reducing the stability. To prove this argument, a fine-grained, very stable austenitic structure was created at 900 °C in 1 s, and subsequently annealed at lower temperatures between 850 and 750 °C, up to 1000 s. It {{was found that the}} subsequent annealing at 750 and 800 °C resulted in prominent gradual decrease of the mechanical stability under tensile straining, detectable after 10 s annealing duration and continued until 1000 s. Only minimal grain growth occurred, which decreased the stability very marginally. The degree of the stability drop followed the predicted kinetics of the Cr 2 N precipitation with regards as its dependence on annealing duration and temperature. Further, the tensile yield strength of the fine-grained structure increased slightly due to the annealing. The presence of nano-sized Cr 2 N particles was verified after 1000 s holding at 750 °C.
