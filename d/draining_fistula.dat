A phase III, multicentre, randomised, double-blind, placebo controlled study with an open-label extension was conducted in 92 sites. A subgroup of adults with moderate to severely active CD (CD activity index 220 - 450) for >or= 4 months who had <b>draining</b> <b>fistulas</b> at baseline. All patients received initial open-label adalimumab induction therapy (80 mg/ 40 mg at weeks 0 / 2). At week 4, all patients {{were randomly assigned to}} receive double-blind placebo or adalimumab 40 mg every other week or weekly to week 56 (irrespective of fistula status). Patients completing week 56 of therapy were then eligible to enroll in an open-label extension. Complete fistula healing/closure (assessed at every visit) was defined as no drainage, either spontaneous or with gentle compression. Of 854 patients enrolled, 117 had <b>draining</b> <b>fistulas</b> at both screening and baseline (70 randomly assigned to adalimumab and 47 to placebo).

40|$|Purpose: Because of the {{controversial}} biologic tolerance and management, retained intraorbital metallic foreign body (RIMFb) poses a formidable challenge to surgeons. Besides location of the foreign body, indications for surgical management include neurologic injury, mechanical restriction of the eye movement, and development of local infection or <b>draining</b> <b>fistula.</b> The authors describe an unusual case of spontaneous migration of a RIMFb. Methods: A 26 -year-old man had a gunshot injury on the left orbit. The patient was initially managed conservatively because of the posterior position of the bullet fragment. Thereafter, because of the clinical impairments and anterior migration of projectile, surgical treatment was considered. Results: Spontaneous anterior migration has led to mechanical disturbances and inflammatory complications that comprise explicit surgical indications for removal. The patient underwent surgery with complete relief of symptoms. We suppose that extrinsic ocular muscles might {{play a role in}} shifting large RIMFb over time, leading to change in the management strategies. Conclusions: Spontaneous migration of RIMFb is a rare clinical situation that can lead to pain, local deformity, as well as changes in the management strategies of the affected patients even in the late phase of follow-up...|$|E
40|$|OBJECTIVES: This multicenter {{registry}} {{followed up}} patients with early-stage breast cancer treated with breast-conserving surgery and electronic brachytherapy (EBT). This report provides 1 - and 2 -year updates {{to the initial}} publication. METHODS: Patients were of age 50 years or more with invasive carcinoma or ductal carcinoma in situ, tumor size RESULTS: Of the 69 patients enrolled, 62 were evaluated at 1 year and 20 patients at 2 years after treatment. At 1 year, 28 (45. 2 %) patients reported adverse events that were possibly, probably, or definitely related to treatment. Most (90 %) were grade 1 : manageable and typical of radiation therapy. Four events were grade 2 : induration/firmness (2), field contracture (1), and seroma (1). One event was grade 3 : a <b>draining</b> <b>fistula</b> at the lumpectomy site due to residual effects of a breast infection at 1 month. No recurrences have been reported. Cosmetic ratings were excellent or good in 93. 4 % of patients at 1 year. Most patients (69 %) were energetic {{most or all of}} the time. Most patients (69 % to 98 %) were not affected by individual symptoms of breast disease at 1 year. Generally patients who had an adverse event did not report the corresponding symptom on the quality-of-life questionnaire.

40|$|The {{thinnest}} {{areas of}} the capillaries of the choroid plexus and ciliary processes {{in the eye of}} the rabbit are characterized by the presence of fenestrae. When various colloidal particles opaque to the electron beam (thorotrast, gold sol, and saccharated iron oxide) were injected into the blood stream, none were found in fenestrae or in areas that might suggest their having passed through fenestrae. The passage of marker particles from the lumen to the surrounding connective tissue does take place on occasion in the areas of thicker walls in the capillaries and venules rather than in the attenuated and fenestrated endothelial walls. The pathway taken by these markers may be either through the cytoplasm of the endothelial cells via membrane-bounded vesicles and vacuoles or through the intercellular spaces of the vessels. An altered aqueous humor (cloudy and plasmoid) was produced by endotoxin injection or by making a <b>draining</b> <b>fistula</b> in rabbit cornea. Both methods gave rise to the same changes in the blood vessels of the ciliary processes. Under such conditions of inflammation the passage of colloidal particles through the thicker walls of the capillaries and venules was greatly increased and occurred primarily as an intercellular passage between the endothelial cells. The attenuated and fenestrated {{areas of the}} endothelium of the small capillaries remained unchanged with no particles passing through them. These results on the altered vessels of the ciliary processes parallel those of Majno and Palade (26) on the rat cremaster muscle...|$|E

Methods: Patients with <b>draining</b> <b>fistulas</b> at baseline from PRECiSE 2 (n = 108) received open-label induction with CZP 400 mg at weeks 0 (baseline), 2 and 4. Response {{was defined as}} ≥ 100 -point decrease from baseline in the Crohn's Disease Activity Index. Nonresponders (50 / 108) were excluded. At week 6, responders with <b>draining</b> <b>fistulas</b> (N = 58) were randomized to CZP 400 mg (n = 28) or placebo (n = 30) every 4 weeks across weeks 8 - 24.

AIM: To assess appropriate use of therapy for fistulizing CD patients enrolled in the Swiss Inflammatory Bowel Disease Cohort using criteria developed by the European Panel on the Appropriateness of Crohn's disease Therapy. METHODS: Specific questionnaires were used to gather information on disease and its management. We assessed appropriateness of therapy at enrolment for adult CD patients with one or several fistulae. RESULTS: Two hundred and eighty-eight CD patients had fistulizing disease, of which 80 % had complex fistulae and 32 % currently had active <b>draining</b> <b>fistulae.</b> Mean age (s. d.) at diagnosis was 27 years (11), 51 % males. Of the patients, 78 % were judged as having globally an appropriate therapy, which was more often given for complex fistulae (87 %) than for simple fistulae (67 %). Antibiotics, azathioprine/MP, methotrexate and conservative surgery were almost always appropriate. Anti-tumor necrosis factor alpha was considered globally appropriate (91 %), although most often with an uncertain indication. The 5 ASA compounds, steroids and aggressive surgery were most often inappropriate (84 %, 58 % and 86 % respectively).

The dilated coronary artery was visualized in 7 of the 16 {{patients with}} a fistula, as compared {{with none of the}} 40 control subjects. These 7 patients included 5 of 6 patients with a <b>fistula</b> <b>draining</b> into the right atrium or right ventricle and only 2 of 10 patients with a <b>fistula</b> <b>draining</b> into the pulmonary artery. Abnormal flow signals in the dilated coronary artery were visualized with Doppler color flow mapping in five of these seven patients. Color flow imaging visualized abnormal flow signals with mosaic appearance in the pulmonary artery in eight patients, the right atrium in four and the right ventricle in two. The chamber in which abnormal signals were detected corresponded with the entry site of the fistula by angiography. Intraoperative imaging during surgical repair was needed in two cases to confirm ligation of all arteries feeding into the fistula network. In conclusion, Doppler color flow imaging is diagnostically useful to visualize shunt flows originating from the opening or exit of a coronary artery fistula.

40|$|Abstract- This {{study was}} {{performed}} to evaluate the results of 14 years of application of Ilizarov method in treatment of infected non-unions of tibia and femur in patients with severe trauma and battlefield wounds. Seventeen patients with long bone nonunion (14 were with infected nonunion of tibia out of whom two were associated with tibial bone defects and 3 with infected non-union of femur) were admitted for the study. After preliminary debridement (in infected cases with <b>draining</b> <b>fistulae)</b> and preparation for external fixation, ring fixator was introduced and compression alone or compression and distraction (in atrophic non-unions) were enforced on fragments to induce union. Bone transfer was used in cases with bone defects. All cases resulted in complete union and had infection controlled. The mean time of union was 8 months in tibial infected non-unions and 10 months in infected femoral non-unions. In cases with bone defects, the mean union time was 12 months. In selected cases of infected tibial and femoral non-union, Ilizarov is an efficient method of treatment, especially with bone transfer in cases with bone defects. The application of this method in battle-field wounds has resulted in noticeable outcomes.

40|$|OBJECTIVE: The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{describe}} the clinical experience with the anti-tumor necrosis factor chimeric monoclonal antibody, infliximab, in pediatric patients with Crohn disease in The Netherlands. DESIGN: Descriptive. METHODS: Clinical response and adverse effects of infliximab were recorded for pediatric patients with Crohn disease treated from October 1992 to January 2003. RESULTS: Thirty patients (aged 7 - 18 years) with refractory Crohn disease (with or without severe fistulas) were treated with infliximab. Patients were treated with up to 30 infusions. Mean follow-up was 25. 3 months. A total of 212 infusions were administered. Thirteen patients had refractory Crohn disease without fistulas. Six patients showed good long-term response to infliximab treatment (defined as clinical index < or = 10 points). Sixteen patients had refractory Crohn disease with <b>draining</b> <b>fistulas.</b> Nine showed good long-term response (closure or nonproductiveness of fistulas). One patient with metastatic Crohn disease in the skin had a good long-term response. Six patients developed an allergic reaction during infusion.

40|$|Abstract Background Osteopetrosis is a rare, inherited, bone disorder, {{characterized}} by osteosclerosis, obliteration of the medullary cavity and calcified cartilage. The autosomal dominant form {{is compatible with}} a normal life span, although fractures often result from minimal trauma, due to the pathologic nature of bone. Osteomyelitis is common in patients with osteopetrosis because of a reduced resistance to infection, attributed {{to the lack of}} marrow vascularity and impairment of white cell function. Only one case of osteomyelitis of the proximal third of the femur has been previously reported, treated with several repeated debridements and finally with femoral head resection. Here we present {{for the first time a}} case of a staged implant of a cementless total hip prosthesis for the treatment of a septic hip in femoral neck nonunion in osteopetrosis. Case presentation A 36 -years-old woman, affected by autosomal dominant osteopetrosis was referred to our department because of a septic hip arthritis associated with femoral neck septic non-union, with <b>draining</b> <b>fistulas.</b> The infection occurred early after a plate osteosynthesis for a closed perthrocanteric fracture of the femur and persisted in spite of osteosynthesis removal, surgical debridement and external fixation. In our hospital the patient underwent accurate debridement, femoral head and greater trochanter resection, preparation of the diaphyseal intramedullary canal and implant of an antibiotic-loaded cement spacer. The spacer was exchanged after one month, due to infection recurrence and four months later, a cementless total hip arthroplasty was implanted, with no clinical and laboratory signs of infection recurrence at two years follow-up. Conclusions In case of hip septic arthritis and proximal femur septic non-union, femoral head resection may not be the only option available and staged total hip arthroplasty can be considered. </p...|$|R
