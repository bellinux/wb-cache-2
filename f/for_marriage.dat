50|$|In South Africa, {{the report}} of the Women's Legal Disabilities Commission in 1949 led to the {{enacting}} of the Matrimonial Affairs Act in 1953, which restricted but did not abolish the marital power. The Matrimonial Property Act of 1984 abolished it prospectively (i.e. <b>for</b> <b>marriages</b> contracted after the act came into force) but not <b>for</b> <b>marriages</b> between black people. An amendment in 1988 abolished it prospectively <b>for</b> <b>marriages</b> of black people under the civil law, but not <b>for</b> <b>marriages</b> contracted under customary law. A further amendment in 1993 repealed the marital power <b>for</b> all civil <b>marriages,</b> whenever they were contracted. The marital power persisted, however, in the Transkei (which was nominally independent from 1976 to 1994) but it was held to be unconstitutional <b>for</b> civil <b>marriages</b> by the High Court in 1999. In 2000 the Recognition of Customary Marriages Act abolished the marital power <b>for</b> all <b>marriages</b> under customary law throughout South Africa.|$|R

5|$|Despite {{the declining}} {{prevalence}} of marriage, {{more than three-quarters}} of Americans will marry at least once in their lifetime. The average age <b>for</b> <b>marriage</b> for a male was 26.8 and 25.1 for a female. Americans are also likely to remarry after their first divorce. In 1990, 40% of all marriages were remarriages. All together one can conclude that while there is no prevalent average household arrangement, most Americans (the average Joe) will get married and divorced once with a considerable number of Americans remarrying at least once.|$|E
5|$|In West African cultures, {{women with}} long hair were highly valued. Long, thick hair {{was seen as a}} sign of health, strength, and {{capability}} to bear many children.

This tradition, however, did not extend to every West African culture, as several valued shorter hair.|$|E

5|$|Only {{the words}} {{exchanged}} by {{the bride and}} groom (including the speaking of the name of Eru Ilúvatar) and the consummation are required <b>for</b> <b>marriage.</b> More formally, the couple's families celebrate the marriage with a feast.

The bride’s mother gives the groom a jewel to wear (Galadriel's gift of the Elfstone to Aragorn reflects this tradition; she is grandmother to his betrothed, Arwen, Arwen's mother Celebrían having left Middle-earth for Valinor after grievous psychological injury after her capture by Orcs and liberation by her sons).|$|E

40|$|Marriage {{registration}} {{is a state}} 2 ̆ 7 s administration which is done by state official (Registrar <b>for</b> <b>Marriages)</b> in a marriage. Marriage registration in the Religious Affairs Office is needed {{for a person to}} have a legal document as authentic evidence before the Court. A registered marriage is intended to get legal certainty and order and to protect the status and sanctity of a marriage, particularly to protect women and children in wedlock when there is a dispute in a married life. Marriage registration by Registrar <b>for</b> <b>Marriages</b> is regulated in Law No. 1 / 1974 on Marriage, the Government Regulation No. 9 / 1975 on the Implementation of Law No. 1 / 1974 on Marriage, and KHI (Compilation of the Islamic Laws). Registrars <b>for</b> the <b>Marriages</b> as government officials appointed by the Minister of Religious Affairs in each subdistrict in their duties to examine the requirements, supervision, and marriage registration, have not done their duties correctly: they receive inadequate administrative requirements and have not control marriage contracts. In the procedure of the issuance of marriage books outside of the place where a marriage occurs, a Registrar <b>for</b> <b>Marriages</b> outside of the place where a marriage occurs should make request to the Registrar <b>for</b> <b>Marriages</b> where the marriage occurs so that a marriage book can be issued. Administrative sanction will be imposed on any Registrar <b>for</b> <b>Marriages</b> who violate this regulation...|$|R

5|$|A {{composite}} of Perrault's male heroes, however, indicates {{the opposite of}} his heroines: his male characters are not particularly handsome, but they are active, brave, ambitious, and deft, and they use their wit, intelligence, and great civility {{to work their way}} up the social ladder and to achieve their goals. In this case of course, it is the cat who displays the characteristics and the man benefits from his trickery and skills. Unlike the tales dealing with submissive heroines waiting <b>for</b> <b>marriage,</b> the male-centered tales suggest social status and achievement are more important than marriage for men. The virtues of Perrault's heroes reflect upon the bourgeoisie of the court of Louis XIV and upon the nature of Perrault, who was a successful civil servant in France during the seventeenth century.|$|E
5|$|Although {{the ideal}} ages <b>for</b> <b>marriage</b> were thirty {{for a man}} and twenty for a woman, it was common for a male to marry at age sixteen and a female at age fourteen. To {{encourage}} families to marry off their daughters, a law was introduced in 189 BCE that increased the poll tax rate fivefold for unmarried {{women between the ages}} of fifteen and thirty. People of the Han practiced a strict form of exogamy where one could not marry a person who had the same surname, even if both partners could not be traced back to a common ancestor (however, this excluded the royal family, who sometimes married distant relatives for political reasons). Officials often married into families with officials of equal status and sometimes married royal princesses or had their daughters marry kings and even the emperor.|$|E
5|$|As Feodora grew older, various suitors were {{considered}} <b>for</b> <b>marriage.</b> The exiled Prince Peter Karađorđević, thirty-six years her senior, unsuccessfully requested {{her hand in}} marriage. Another potential candidate was her cousin Alfred, Hereditary Prince of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha. In late 1897, Feodora became engaged to Prince Henry XXX of Reuss, and they married the following year, on 24 September 1898 in a Lutheran ceremony at Breslau. The groom was fifteen years older than his bride and a captain in a Brunswick regiment, but not wealthy or particularly high-ranked. Many in the family were shocked at the marriage, but the Dowager Empress was at least pleased that her granddaughter seemed happy with the match.|$|E
