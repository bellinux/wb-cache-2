It was thought that the 213th could reach an area in between Chéhéry and Bulson in one hour fifty minutes and the 7th Tank Battalion in two hours.

50|$|It is {{understood}} that rearrangement occurs between specific {{sites on the}} DNA called recombination signal sequences (RSSs). The signal sequences are composed of a conserved palindromic heptamer and a conserved AT- rich nonamer. These signal sequences are separated by non-conserved spacers of 12 or 23 base pairs called one-turn and two-turn respectively. They are within the lambda chain, k-chain and The processes of rearrangement in these regions are catalyzed by two recombination-activating genes: RAG-1 and RAG-2 and other enzymes and proteins. The segments joined due to signals generated RSSs that flank each V, D, and J segments. Only genes <b>flank</b> <b>by</b> 12 -bp that join to the genes <b>flank</b> <b>by</b> 23-bp spacer during the rearrangements and combinations to maintain VL-JL and VH-DH-JH joining.|$|R
