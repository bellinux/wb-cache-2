5|$|Even as {{the initial}} 400 gliders were being produced, several {{problems}} with the Hotspur's design were uncovered, the primary one being that the glider did not carry sufficient troops. Although it had been designed to transport eight airborne troops and a cargo of , this {{was found to be}} inadequate. Tactically it was believed that airborne troops should be landed in groups far larger than eight, and the number of aircraft therefore required to tow the gliders needed to land larger groups would be unfeasible; there were also concerns that the gliders would have to be towed in tandem if used operationally, which would be extremely difficult during nighttime and through cloud formations. Its disappointing <b>glide</b> <b>ratio</b> was also a contributing factor to reevaluate the assault glider concept.|$|E
25|$|The SparrowHawk {{achieves}} a best <b>glide</b> <b>ratio</b> of 36:1 and a minimum sink rate of 119ft/min (0.60m/s).|$|E
25|$|Modified Pioneer II with swept {{vertical}} tail and a modified wing leading edge, giving a <b>glide</b> <b>ratio</b> of 35:1.|$|E
50|$|Minimising drag is of {{particular}} interest in the design and operation of high performance glider (sailplane)s, the largest of which can have <b>glide</b> <b>ratios</b> approaching 60 to 1, though many others have a lower performance; 25:1 being considered adequate for training use.|$|R
50|$|The type {{consolidated}} Rolladen-Schneider's {{reputation for}} well rounded, easy to fly gliders that {{do well in}} any conditions, being known for its superb handling, tolerance of piloting technique and environment (turbulence, rain, contamination by insects) {{as well as for}} good <b>glide</b> <b>ratios</b> over a wide speed range.|$|R

25|$|The 1-23E has 52.8 foot wings {{equipped}} with balanced dive brakes. It has a <b>glide</b> <b>ratio</b> of 31:1 at 46 mph and a minimum sink speed of 1.95 {{feet per second}} at 40 mph.|$|E
25|$|The {{aircraft}} {{achieves a}} 26:1 <b>glide</b> <b>ratio</b> with 13 m wings and 30:1 with 15 m wings fitted. Aside from its {{use as a}} motorglider, the Lambada has also been successfully employed as a glider tug.|$|E
25|$|The {{nose wheel}} of the DA20 is not linked to the rudder pedals and turns while taxiing are made with {{differential}} braking, with rudder steering becoming more effective as airspeed increases. The Katana possesses a higher <b>glide</b> <b>ratio</b> than many of its competitors; its <b>glide</b> <b>ratio</b> is 11:1 and the DA20-A1 is 14:1. The aircraft does not feature any instances of vortex generators, wing fences or many other aerodynamic devices, aside from the integral winglets, which positively contribute to roll stability, drag-reduction, and enhanced aileron effectiveness. The Katana's T-tail configuration has also been claimed to reduce {{the negative effects of}} propeller-generated slipstream on the aircraft's pitch control as well as increase low-speed pitch authority.|$|E
50|$|The {{aircraft}} structure {{is made from}} carbon-fiber-reinforced polymer. The wing uses minimal cable bracing and incorporates both flaps and spoilers for roll control. The aspect ratio for most models is {{in the range of}} 11:1 or 12:1. Achieved <b>glide</b> <b>ratios</b> run as high as 20:1. Later models incorporate a horizontal tailplane for improved stability.|$|R
50|$|Unmodified origami paper {{aircraft}} {{have very}} poor <b>glide</b> <b>ratios,</b> often not better than 7.5:1 depending on construction and materials. Modification of origami paper gliders {{can lead to}} marked improvements in flight performance, {{at the cost of}} weight and often with the inclusion of aerodynamic and/or structural compromises. Often, increases in wing loading can encourage breakdown of laminar flow over a wing with a hybrid of origami and glued and taped construction.|$|R
50|$|With {{an extreme}} 33:1 aspect ratio and a {{relatively}} low empty weight, the HP-15 was expected to generate less induced drag and therefore higher performance. The type achieved excellent <b>glide</b> <b>ratios</b> in fast flight, but had disappointing climbing ability, due to extensive flow separation on the upper wing surfaces during slow flight and Schreder and the HP-15 finished in 65th place. After the Championships Schreder re-winged the fuselage to produce his next design, the HP-16.|$|R
25|$|The Hütter {{brothers}} {{designed the}} Hü 17 in Salzburg, Austria, the designation indicating the aircraft's <b>glide</b> <b>ratio.</b> The design was made available as plans for amateur construction and several hundred were completed. The brothers then joined the Schempp-Hirth company which constructed about {{five of the}} aircraft under the designation Göppingen Gö 5.|$|E
25|$|Performance of the Ka-2b was {{improved}} in weak thermals {{due to a}} lower minimum sink speed, allowing tighter thermalling. Cross-country performance was also improved by a higher <b>glide</b> <b>ratio,</b> increasing the chance of reaching the next thermal. The standard competition handicap for the Ka–2 is 74 and the Ka-2b handicap is 78.|$|E
25|$|The HP-8 is an {{all-metal}} {{design with}} a very high aspect ratio wing of 24:1, that incorporates a NACA 65 (3)-618 airfoil. The wing is of only 110 square feet (10 m2) in area and this gives a high wing loading of 7.53lbs/sq ft (36.8kg/m²), allowing a high <b>glide</b> <b>ratio</b> at a high speed.|$|E
500|$|The two {{air sports}} {{that are most}} closely related to gliding are hang gliding and paragliding. Although all three sports rely on rising air, there are {{significant}} differences which are listed in detail in [...] The main difference is that both hang gliders and paragliders are simpler, less sophisticated and cheaper aircraft that use the pilot's feet as the undercarriage. All paragliders and most hang gliders have no protective structure around the pilot. However, the dividing line between basic gliders and sophisticated hang-gliders is becoming less distinct. For example, hang gliders typically use fabric wings, shaped over a framework, but hang gliders with rigid wings and three-axis controls are also available. The lower air speeds and lower <b>glide</b> <b>ratios</b> of typical hang gliders means that shorter cross-country distances are flown than in modern gliders. Paragliders are more basic craft. They are also foot-launched, but their wings usually have no frames and their shape is created by the flow and pressure of air. The airspeeds and <b>glide</b> <b>ratios</b> of paragliders are generally lower still than the typical hang gliders, and so their cross-country flights are even shorter. Radio-controlled gliding uses scale-models of gliders mainly for ridge soaring; however thermic aeromodelling craft are also used.|$|R

25|$|The HM {{was built}} by using a stock 1-23H {{fuselage}} and tail assembly. Starr built {{a new set of}} 54 foot (16.6 m) span wings with an aspect ratio of 23.5:1. The wings took 1500 hours to construct, but the resulting aircraft has a <b>glide</b> <b>ratio</b> of 33.2:1 which is a 7% improvement over the stock 1-23H. The HM later had retractable landing gear added.|$|E
25|$|Most {{efficient}} glider. This can {{be taken}} as the animal that moves most horizontal distance per metre fallen. Flying squirrels are known to glide up to , but have measured <b>glide</b> <b>ratio</b> of about 2. Flying fish have been observed to glide for hundreds of metres on the drafts {{on the edge of}} waves with only their initial leap from the water to provide height, but may be obtaining additional lift from wave motion. On the other hand, albatrosses have measured lift/drag ratios of 20, and thus fall just 1 meter (foot) for every 20 in still air.|$|E
25|$|Use of the {{laminar flow}} NACA 63 (3)-618 {{aerofoil}} section imbued the Mü22 {{with a good}} <b>glide</b> <b>ratio</b> at a high speed which was ideal for competition cross-country flight, {{in contrast to the}} low speed Mü Scheibe section used for previous sailplanes at Akaflieg München. To maintain strength with reduced weight and to eliminate turbulence from gaps and protuberances the Mü22 was built without airbrakes, relying {{on the use of the}} 70 degree trailing edge split flaps and the skill of the pilot in side-slipping for approach control. The high performance of the design was demonstrated during flight testing after the first flight on 29 November 1954 at Riem, as well as by placing second in the German National Gliding Championships in 1959. The Mü22 was also flown extensively to investigate mountain flying during which the Mü22 suffered a serious accident late in 1959 and was damaged beyond repair.|$|E
5000|$|Aspect {{ratio is}} another way to measure ram-air parachutes. Aspect ratios of parachutes are {{measured}} the same way as aircraft wings, by comparing span with chord. Low aspect ratio parachutes, i.e., span 1.8 times the chord, are now limited to precision landing competitions. Popular precision landing parachutes include Jalbert (now NAA) Para-Foils and John Eiff's series of Challenger Classics. While low aspect ratio parachutes tend to be extremely stable, with gentle stall characteristics, they suffer from steep <b>glide</b> <b>ratios</b> and a small tolerance, or [...] "sweet spot", for timing the landing flare.|$|R
50|$|The orbiter's maximum <b>glide</b> ratio/lift-to-drag <b>ratio</b> varied {{considerably}} with speed, {{ranging from}} 1:1 at hypersonic speeds, 2:1 at supersonic speeds, and reaching 4.5:1 at subsonic speeds during approach and landing.|$|R
5000|$|Independently, Edmond Hui {{invented a}} Stealth Bomber-like paper plane called the Paperang in 1977, based on hang glider aerodynamics. Uniquely, it has {{properly}} controlled airfoil sections, high-aspect-ratio wings, and a construction method {{designed to allow}} the builder to vary every aspect of its shape. It {{was the subject of}} a book, [...] "Amazing Paper Airplanes" [...] in 1987, and a number of newspaper articles in 1992. It is ineligible for most paper plane competitions due to the use of a staple, but it has extremely high gliding performance exceeding <b>glide</b> <b>ratios</b> of 12 to 1 with good stability.|$|R
500|$|One of the {{measures}} of a glider's performance is the distance that it can fly for each meter it descends, known as its <b>glide</b> <b>ratio.</b> <b>Glide</b> <b>ratio</b> is dependent on an aircraft's class, and can typically range from 44:1 (for modern designs in the Standard Class) up to 70:1 (for the largest aircraft). A good gliding performance combined with regular sources of rising air enables modern gliders to fly long distances at high speeds. The weather {{is a major factor}} in determining cross-country speeds. The record average speed for [...] is [...] required unusually good conditions, but even in places with less favorable conditions (such as Northern Europe) a skilled pilot could expect to complete flights over [...] every year.|$|E

2500|$|A {{paraglider}} is a free-flying, foot-launched aircraft. The pilot sits in {{a harness}} suspended below a fabric wing. Unlike a hang glider whose wings have frames, {{the form of a}} paraglider wing is formed by the pressure of air entering vents or cells {{in the front of the}} wing. [...] This is known as a ram-air wing (similar to the smaller parachute design). [...] The paraglider's light and simple design allows them to be packed and carried in large backpack, and make them one of simplest and economical modes of flight. Competition level wings can achieve <b>glide</b> <b>ratios</b> up to 1:10 and fly around speeds of [...]|$|R
50|$|Flaps: Flaps are movable {{surfaces}} on {{the trailing}} {{edge of the}} wing. The primary purpose of flaps is to change the camber of the wing and so change the lift-to-drag ratio of the wing. This reduces the stall speed and so allows reduced landing speeds. It was possible to lower the flaps on some older gliders by up to 90 degrees to increase drag significantly as well as increasing lift coefficient when landing. Another feature that flapped gliders possess are negative flaps that are also able to deflect the trailing edge upward. This feature is included on some competition sailplanes {{in order to reduce the}} pitching moment on the wing and allowing better <b>glide</b> <b>ratios</b> at higher speeds (a particularly desirable characteristic for racing sailplanes).|$|R
40|$|The flight {{performance}} of modern lightweight gyroplanes is investigated in this paper. The final {{goal is to}} explore the possibilities increasing the airspeed of gyroplanes. The gyroplane flight physics are examined briefly particularly the autorotation during vertical descent and forward flight. The early research work, such as the gliding tests with a PCA- 2 gyroplane conducted by Wheatley in the thirties are considered as basis {{for the analysis of}} modern gyroplanes. The validated simulation model of a new generation gyroplane of type MTOsport is used in order to investigate relevant {{flight performance}} parameters. The <b>glide</b> <b>ratios</b> of the rotor alone and of the total aircraft are determined and the results are discussed in comparison with the PCA- 2 data. Finally the potential of gyroplane perfomance improvement by means of drag reduction is discussed by comparison with a light airplane...|$|R

40|$|The {{aerodynamic}} {{forces on}} bodies of arbitrary shape were investigated under conditions {{such that the}} mean free path of the air molecule {{is greater than the}} dimensions of the body. Air pressures and friction forces were calculated from gas kinetic theory for surfaces facing both toward and away from the air stream at any angle. Air forces for an atmosphere of definite composition (molecular hydrogen) were calculated {{as a function of the}} flight velocity. The results indicate that the friction stresses between the air and the body surface are of the same magnitude as the dynamic pressure and as the air pressures normal to the surface. The application of the general method to the specific cases such as thin airfoils and projectiles leads to high drag coefficients and poor <b>glide</b> <b>ratios</b> even for the theoretically best wing sections...|$|R
500|$|The wingspans of {{the largest}} great {{albatrosses}} (genus Diomedea) are the largest of any bird, exceeding , although the other species' wingspans are considerably smaller at no more than [...] The wings are stiff and cambered, with thickened streamlined leading edges. Albatrosses travel huge distances with two techniques used by many long-winged seabirds: dynamic soaring and slope soaring. Dynamic soaring involves repeatedly rising into wind and descending downwind, thus gaining energy from the vertical wind gradient. The only effort expended is in the turns {{at the top and}} bottom of every such loop. This maneuver allows the bird to cover almost a thousand kilometres a day without flapping its wings. Slope soaring uses the rising air on the windward side of large waves. Albatross have high <b>glide</b> <b>ratios,</b> around 22:1 to 23:1, meaning that for every metre they drop, they can travel forward 22metres. They are aided in soaring by a shoulder-lock, a sheet of tendon that locks the wing when fully extended, allowing the wing to be kept outstretched without any muscle expenditure, a morphological adaptation they share with the giant petrels.|$|R
40|$|Theaddition of {{glide slope}} control to guided airdrop systemshas the {{potential}} to provide dramatic improvements in landing accuracy. Dynamic rigging incidence control has been demonstrated in flight tests and shown to provide effective glide slope control. The current work presents flight-test results exploring the range of glide slope control {{that can be achieved}} with high-performance parafoil canopies of two different aspect ratios. The low- and medium-aspect-ratio canopies have peak <b>glide</b> <b>ratios</b> of 4. 4 and 4. 9, respectively. By varying the incidence angle in flight, the glide slope can be reduced from these peak values to a glide slope near two for both canopies. Flight tests investigating the relationship between symmetric brake and incidence control demonstrate that symmetric braking produces effective airspeed control with little effect on glide slope, the incidence angle produces significant effects on both glide slope and airspeed, the rapid variation of the incidence angle in flight can lead to significant long period oscillations in both glide slope and airspeed, and the coupled effect of the control mechanisms of incidence angle and symmetric brake can produce dramatic changes in glide slope in any wind condition.
