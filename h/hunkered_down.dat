5|$|On {{the morning}} of 10 July, former Prime Minister Chaudhry Shujaat Hussain and Federal Religious Affairs Minister Muhammad Ijaz-ul-Haq {{declared}} that peace negotiations via loudspeaker and mobile phone had failed. Within minutes, the Special Service Group were issued orders to storm the mosque. Pakistan Army spokesman Waheed Arshad said troops began by attacking and breaching the mosque {{from the south and}} assaulted it from three directions at 4:00am (23:00 GMT). The forces immediately came under gunfire from heavily armed militants <b>hunkered</b> <b>down</b> behind sandbagged positions on the roof and from holes in the walls of the mosque. The SSG quickly cleared the mosque's ground floor, amid explosions coming from the mosque. About 30 women and children ran toward the advancing SSG operators and managed to escape unharmed.|$|E

40|$|AbstractIn {{this article}} Putnam's claim, that {{persons in the}} US living in areas with high {{concentrations}} of ethnic minorities <b>hunker</b> <b>down,</b> is investigated in the Netherlands. <b>Hunkering</b> <b>down</b> is conceptualized and operationalized as: avoiding public spaces, refraining from social contacts and evaluating the neighbourhood unfavourably. Using multi-level modelling based on {{a representative sample of}} almost 60, 000 persons, individual and contextual characteristics on three levels are linked to three dimensions of (lack of) community cohesion. We found more significant effects of contextual characteristics at the level of neighbourhoods than at the level of municipalities. We found that the concentration of ethnic minorities in the neighbourhood contributes to the explanation of these three dimensions of community cohesion, however, these effects are relatively minor. Moreover, we found that indicators of economic poverty in the neighbourhood similarly determine these dimensions of <b>hunkering</b> <b>down...</b>|$|R

At this point, Kahalani's companies were scattered across seventeen kilometres between Hermonit and Bunker 109. One Syrian tank was discovered only after Kahalani ordered {{one of the companies}} to turn off their lights. A Syrian anti-tank unit tried to advance down the Bnot Yaakov Road, in front of Bunker 107, not knowing it was occupied. The Israelis opened fire and after a brief battle the Syrians retreated.

25|$|Ava {{would come}} to rue the missed opportunity. Swa kept Swe from the next {{invasion}} in the following dry season. Swe was assigned to guard the capital while Swa and Tarabya invaded the southern country again. The second invasion fared no better. Razadarit committed no more errors, and <b>hunkered</b> <b>down.</b> Ava troops could not break through Pegu's defenses and had to retreat before the rainy season arrived. Swe was to get his chance again {{to go to the}} front in the 1390–91 campaign. But this time, he commanded just a regiment, and was directly under the command of Tarabya. At any rate, their army could not break through the Pegu defenses at Pankyaw although the campaign ended in a truce.|$|E
25|$|The {{retreat of}} Aguinaldo from Bayambang, Pangasinan, through the mountainous terrain began on November 13, 1899, {{after he had}} disbanded the regular Filipino army into guerrilla units. On November 23, Aguinaldo's party reached the pass, which {{provided}} a strategic bottleneck. It was to be protected by a rear guard under General Gregorio del Pilar, who noticed the advantageous terrain of Tirad Pass (Pasong Tirad as it was locally called), and <b>hunkered</b> <b>down</b> to defend it while Aguinaldo escaped through the mountains. The hand-picked force of Filipinos, which was the remaining contingent of the late Antonio Luna's army, constructed several sets of trenches and stone barricades on both shoulders of the pass, {{as well as on}} top of its 4,500-foot height. Meanwhile, during early November, Major March had been given the task of pursuing Aguinaldo. By November 30, March and his men, in haste to catch the Philippine president, marched through Candon, Santo Tomas, La Union and Salcedo, Ilocos Sur. He and his men found out that Aguinaldo had passed through Salcedo five days previously, and that fueled the Americans' march to Concepcion (now named Gregorio del Pilar), a town overlooked by the steep pass, which they reached by December 1. March had no clear idea of the size of Aguinaldo's rear guard, but he had calculated it to be no more than 150 men.|$|E

25|$|In {{northern}} Iraq {{in early}} March, a small reconnaissance team from M Squadron of the British Special Boat Service mounted on Honda ATVs inserted into Iraq from Jordan, its first {{mission was to}} conduct reconnaissance of an Iraqi air base at al-Sahara. The team was compromised by an anti-special forces Fedayeen unit and barely escaped thanks to a U.S. F-15E that flew air cover for the team and the bravery of an RAF Chinook that extracted the team under the Fedayeen's 'noses'. A second larger SBS operation was launched by M Squadron in full strength in a mix of land rovers and ATVs into northern Iraq from H-2 airbase, the objective was to locate, make contact and take the surrender of the Iraqi 5th Army Corps somewhere past Tikrit and to survey and mark viable temporary landing zones for follow-on forces. However the Squadron was compromised by a goat herder; the SBS drove for several days whilst unknown to them anti-special forces Fedayeen units followed them. At an overnight position near Mosul, the Fedayeen ambushed the Squadron with DShK heavy machine guns and RPGs, the SBS returned fire and began taking fire from a T-72, the Squadron scattered and escaped the well-constructed trap. A number of Land Rovers became bogged down in a nearby wadi, so they mined the vehicles and abandoned them - though several did not detonate and were captured and exhibited on Iraqi television. The SBS was now in three distinct groups: one with several operational Land Rovers was being pursued by the Iraqi hunter force, a second mainly equipped with ATVs was <b>hunkered</b> <b>down</b> and trying to arrange extraction, the third with just 2 operators on an ATV raced for the Syrian border. The first group tried to call in coalition strike aircraft but the aircraft couldn't identify friendly forces because the SBS were not equipped with infra-red strobes - although their vehicles did have Blue Force Tracker units, they eventually made it to an emergency rendezvous point and were extracted by a RAF Chinook. The second group was also extracted by an RAF Chinook and the third group made it to Syria and was held there until their release was negotiated, there were no SBS casualties.|$|E

The standoff continued, as heavily armed militants had retreated into the basement using women and children as human shields, according to the Pakistan Army spokesman. The militants in the basement resisted with machine guns, shoulder-fired rockets, and Molotov cocktails. In a last interview with Geo TV during the operation, Abdul Rashid Ghazi, who was <b>hunkered</b> <b>down</b> in the basement, claimed {{that his mother had}} been wounded by gunfire and was quoted as saying, [...] "The government is using full force.

Other strikes, particularly against heavily defended US targets used a barrage of covering fires to keep defenders penned in their positions, heads down, while the assault groups moved stealthily into position.
