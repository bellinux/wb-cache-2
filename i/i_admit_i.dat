60|$|A most {{reasonable}} suggestion, <b>I</b> <b>admit.</b> Unfortunately, <b>I</b> am not {{the right}} man to comply with it.|$|R

6000|$|LORD GORING. What {{you know}} about him is not his real character. It {{was an act of}} folly done in his youth, dishonourable, <b>I</b> <b>admit,</b> shameful, <b>I</b> <b>admit,</b> unworthy of him, <b>I</b> <b>admit,</b> and {{therefore}} [...] . not his true character.|$|R
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>admitted</b> that <b>I</b> had not. I would eat, I {{would do}} anything, so that {{afterward}} {{she would tell}} me about Bertha.|$|R
