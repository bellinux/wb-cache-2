5|$|Because amateur botany {{was popular}} in Britain {{during the second}} half of the eighteenth century, The Botanic Garden, despite its initial high cost, was a bestseller. In 1799 it was in a fourth edition as The Botanic Garden; A Poem in Two Parts at a smaller and more {{affordable}} octavo size, and this was another best-seller. There were three early Irish editions, and a second American edition had appeared by 1807. Despite the huge demand in 1799 and into the early 1800s, and cheaper pirated American and Irish imports, there was room in the market <b>for</b> <b>another</b> <b>edition</b> in Britain 1824 with a reprinting in 1825.|$|E
60|$|I {{was indeed}} so much {{surprised}} at your silence that I wrote to Henry James and {{begged him to}} inquire if you had received it; his reply was an (if possible) higher power of the same silence; whereupon I bowed my head and acquiesced. But {{there is no doubt}} the letter was written and sent; and I am sorry it was lost, for it contained, among other things, an irrecoverable criticism of your father's LIFE, with a number of suggestions <b>for</b> <b>another</b> <b>edition,</b> which struck me at the time as excellent.|$|E
6000|$|In {{the morning}} he changed his mind, led partly by some dim foreshadowing of {{the result of his}} {{literary}} adventure; for the little book took all Scotland by storm. Not only scholars and literary men, but [...] "even plowboys and maid servants," [...] says a contemporary, eagerly spent their hard-earned shillings for the new book. Instead of going to Jamaica, the young poet hurried to Edinburgh to arrange <b>for</b> <b>another</b> <b>edition</b> of his work. His journey was a constant ovation, and in the capital he was welcomed and feasted by the best of Scottish society. This inexpected triumph lasted only one winter. Burns's fondness for taverns and riotous living shocked his cultured entertainers, and when he returned to Edinburgh next winter, after a pleasure jaunt through the Highlands, he received scant attention. He left the city in anger and disappointment, {{and went back to the}} soil where he was more at home.|$|E

Burton and Letchford had met several years before when the latter was 18 and in Florence beginning his art education. They discussed the possibility of illustrating the Nights. Burton's suggestion of illustrating the Nights had appealed greatly to Letchford on account of the unlimited scope such a subject would give to an artist who loved the East and had a boundless imagination. Letchford commenced study of Eastern images for his paintings, though only one of the illustrations was painted in Burton's lifetime.|$|E
