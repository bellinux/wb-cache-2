5|$|As a {{literary}} theorist, Chivers believed in divine inspiration. He encouraged {{the development of}} a distinctive American style of literature and especially promoted young writers. His poems were known for religious overtones with an emphasis on death and reunions with lost loved ones in the afterlife. Though he built up a mild reputation <b>in</b> <b>his</b> <b>day,</b> he was soon forgotten after his death.|$|E
5|$|One of {{the more}} notable uses of this meaning is found in The Wonderful Wizard of Oz. The Emerald City in this story {{is a place where}} {{everyone}} wears tinted glasses that make everything appear green. According to the populist interpretation of the story, the city’s color is used by the author, L. Frank Baum, to illustrate the financial system of America <b>in</b> <b>his</b> <b>day,</b> as he lived in a time when America was debating the use of paper money versus gold.|$|E

During the Commonwealth period it became accommodation {{for one of the}} park's deputy keepers, Lodowick Carlell (or Carlile), who was also a renowned playwright <b>in</b> <b>his</b> <b>day,</b> and his wife, Joan Carlile, one of the very first women to practise painting professionally.|$|E

5|$|Aleister Crowley {{wrote in}} The Antecedents of Thelema, (1926), an {{incomplete}} work not published <b>in</b> <b>his</b> <b>day,</b> that Rabelais not only set forth {{the law of}} Thelema in a way similar to how Crowley understood it, but predicted and described in code Crowley's life and the holy text that {{he claimed to have}} received, The Book of the Law. Crowley said the work he had received was deeper, showing in more detail the technique people should practice, and revealing scientific mysteries. He said that Rabelais confines himself to portraying an ideal, rather than addressing questions of political economy and similar subjects, which must be solved in order to realize the Law.|$|E
5|$|Counsel for the {{petitioner}} {{discussed at}} great length from a sociological point of view, of the age-old problem of the gambling instinct in the human being. According to his analysis, gambling pervades our entire economic system; thus insurance contracts are a gamble, stock and grain exchange transactions are gambles, and the farmer's dependence on weather is a gamble. Counsel's attempt to apply this analysis to the present case left us cold and unimpressed. He even reminded us that our great idol, Mr. Chief Justice John Marshall, <b>in</b> <b>his</b> <b>day</b> attended the horse races and wagered with his clergyman. In fact, they ran a book. As indicating how times have changed and how even our coarse nature has yielded to the protecting care of governmental policy, we confess we do not even know a bookmaker, clerical or otherwise, and our passes to the beautiful race tracks around Chicago lie in our desk unused.|$|E
5|$|For {{many of his}} eleven seasons, Hutson {{was also}} the Packers' kicker. He added 172 extra points on 183 {{attempts}} and seven field goals on 15 attempts for another league record 823 points. He {{led the league in}} extra points made and attempted in 1941, 1942 and 1945 and in field goals made in 1943. As did almost all players <b>in</b> <b>his</b> <b>day,</b> Hutson played both offense and defense. On defense, he played safety and intercepted 30 passes over the final six years of his career. His highest season total was in 1943, when he intercepted eight passes in ten games. In 1940, he led the NFL with six interceptions.|$|E

5|$|In many {{accounts}} {{of the development of}} evolutionary theory, Wallace is mentioned only in passing as simply being the stimulus to the publication of Darwin's own theory. In reality, Wallace developed his own distinct evolutionary views which diverged from Darwin's, and was considered by many (especially Darwin) to be a leading thinker on evolution <b>in</b> <b>his</b> <b>day,</b> whose ideas could not be ignored. One historian of science has pointed out that, through both private correspondence and published works, Darwin and Wallace exchanged knowledge and stimulated each other's ideas and theories over an extended period. Wallace is the most-cited naturalist in Darwin's Descent of Man, occasionally in strong disagreement.|$|E
5|$|In {{the realm}} of modern research, the late British {{biochemist}} and historian of Chinese science Joseph Needham (1900–1995) (known as Li Yuese in China) did extensive research and analysis of Su Song's texts and various achievements in his Science and Civilization in China book series. Joseph Needham also related many detailed passages from Su's contemporary medieval Chinese sources {{on the life of}} Su and his achievements known <b>in</b> <b>his</b> <b>day.</b> In 1956, John Christiansen reconstructed a model of Su Song's clocktower in a famous drawing, which garnered attention in the West towards 11th-century Chinese engineering. A miniature model of Su Song's clock was reconstructed by John Cambridge and is now on display at the National Science Museum at South Kensington, London. In China, the clocktower was reconstructed to one-fifth its actual scale by Wang Zhenduo, who worked for the Chinese Historical Museum in Beijing in the 1950s.|$|E
5|$|Laurence succeeded Augustine to the see of Canterbury {{in about}} 604, and ruled {{until his death}} on 2February 619. To secure the succession, Augustine had consecrated Laurence before he died, even though that was {{prohibited}} by canon law. Augustine was afraid though that if someone did not step into the office immediately, it would damage the missionary efforts in Britain. However, Laurence never received a pallium from Rome, so {{he may have been}} considered uncanonical by the papacy. Bede makes a point of comparing Augustine's action in consecrating Laurence to Saint Peter's action of consecrating Clement as Bishop of Rome during Peter's lifetime, which the theologian J. Robert Wright believes may be Bede's way of criticising the practices of the church <b>in</b> <b>his</b> <b>day.</b>|$|E

5|$|Refined cuisine {{could be}} moralized {{as a sign}} of either civilized {{progress}} or decadent decline. The early Imperial historian Tacitus contrasted the indulgent luxuries of the Roman table <b>in</b> <b>his</b> <b>day</b> with the simplicity of the Germanic diet of fresh wild meat, foraged fruit, and cheese, unadulterated by imported seasonings and elaborate sauces. Most often, because of the importance of landowning in Roman culture, produce—cereals, legumes, vegetables, and fruit—was considered a more civilized form of food than meat. The Mediterranean staples of bread, wine, and oil were sacralized by Roman Christianity, while Germanic meat consumption became a mark of paganism, as it might be the product of animal sacrifice.|$|E
5|$|Taft is now better {{remembered for}} his books, such as The History of American Sculpture (1903), {{regarded}} as the first comprehensive work on the subject. However, <b>in</b> <b>his</b> <b>day</b> he was well known for portraits and allegorical public sculpture, of which Fountain of Time is a prime example. It was produced in the period following his assignment to design sculptures for William Le Baron Jenney's 1893 Horticultural Building for the World's Columbian Exposition. During this period he designed several large-scale public works, including Fountain of the Great Lakes. Taft resided in Illinois {{for most of his}} life and worked in the Midway Studios starting in 1906.|$|E
5|$|Wilfrid's {{network of}} monasteries {{extended}} across {{at least three}} of the kingdoms of England <b>in</b> <b>his</b> <b>day.</b> They included Hexham, Ripon, Selsey, and Oundle, as well as possibly Peterborough, Brixworth, Evesham, Wing, and Withington. At his monasteries and dioceses he built churches in a style akin to that of the continent and Rome, travelling between them with a large entourage of up to 120followers. He made many contacts and friends, not only in Northumbria and the other English kingdoms, but also in Gaul, Frisia, and Italy. Nobles sent their sons to him for fostering, and Wilfrid was known to help his protégés, no matter if they became clerics or not. The historian Peter Brown speculated that one reason for Wilfrid's exile in 678 was that he was overshadowing the king as a patron. His contacts extended to the Lombard kingdom in Italy, where they included King Perctarit and his son Cunipert.|$|E

5|$|William Harrison Ainsworth, a Victorian novelist {{considered}} <b>in</b> <b>his</b> <b>day</b> {{the equal}} of Dickens, wrote a romanticised account of the Pendle witches published in 1849. The Lancashire Witches {{is the only one}} of his 40 novels never to have been out of print. The British writer Robert Neill dramatised the events of 1612 in his novel Mist over Pendle, first published in 1951. The writer and poet Blake Morrison treated the subject in his suite of poems Pendle Witches, published in 1996, and in 2011 poet Simon Armitage narrated a documentary on BBC Four, The Pendle Witch Child.|$|E
5|$|Bede {{sometimes}} {{included in}} his theological books an {{acknowledgement of the}} predecessors on whose works he drew. In two cases he left instructions that his marginal notes, which gave {{the details of his}} sources, should be preserved by the copyist, and he may have originally added marginal comments about his sources to others of his works. Where he does not specify, it is still possible to identify books to which he must have had access by quotations that he uses. A full catalogue of the library available to Bede in the monastery cannot be reconstructed, but it is possible to tell, for example, that Bede was very familiar with the works of Virgil. There is little evidence that he had access to any other of the pagan Latin writers—he quotes many of these writers but the quotes are almost all {{to be found in the}} Latin grammars that were common <b>in</b> <b>his</b> <b>day,</b> one or more of which would certainly have been at the monastery. Another difficulty is that manuscripts of early writers were often incomplete: it is apparent that Bede had access to Pliny's Encyclopedia, for example, but it seems that the version he had was missing book xviii, as he would almost certainly have quoted from it in his De temporum ratione.|$|E
5|$|In {{her account}} of the affair, Margaret Macaulay explores 18th-century attitudes to women in general as a {{significant}} factor and notes that although numerous documents {{from the hands of}} Lord Grange's friends and supporters are still extant, not a single contemporary female view of the affair has survived, save that of Lady Grange herself. Divorces were complex and divorced mothers were rarely given custody of children. Furthermore, Lord Grange's powerful friends in both the church and the legal profession might have made this a risky endeavour. Something of James Erskine's attitude to these matters may perhaps be gleaned from the fact that for his first speech in the House of Commons he chose to oppose the repeal of various laws relating to witchcraft. Even <b>in</b> <b>his</b> <b>day</b> this appeared unduly conservative and his perorations were met with laughter, which effectively ended his political career before it had begun. Writing in the mid-19th century the Sobieski Stuarts told the tale {{from the perspective of the}} descendants of the Highland aristocrats who had been responsible for Chiesley's kidnap and imprisonment. They emphasise Lady Grange's personal shortcomings, although to modern sensibilities these hardly seem good reasons for a judge and Member of Parliament and his wealthy friends to organise an illegal kidnapping and life sentence.|$|E

5|$|Villani {{states that}} the whole {{population}} of Florence—men, women, and children—in reference to the years 1336 to 1338, {{was estimated to be}} 90,000 due to the amount of bread needed daily. Villani recorded an exact figure of 94,000 residents (which he says was very reliable data that included even the poor) in April 1347, a year before the Black Death. A black bean was deposited for every male child baptized and a white bean deposited for every female child baptized in the Florence Baptistry—from these baptisms the average annual birth rate was figured at 5,500 to 6,000. Villani pointed out that the newborn males often outnumbered the newborn females by 300 to 500 on each count. He noted that <b>in</b> <b>his</b> <b>day</b> the adult, male citizen population of the city was about 25,000 (those between the age of fifteen and seventy who could bear arms); 1,500 of these were noble and upper class citizens. Giovanni Villani stated that at all times there were about 1,500 foreigners, transients, and soldiers in the city.|$|E

He also refuted the argument, advanced by Swedish scholars <b>in</b> <b>his</b> <b>day,</b> that a form of proto-Swedish was the ancestor of the Germanic languages. He puzzled over {{the origins of the}} Slavic languages, was aware of the existence of Sanskrit, and was fascinated by classical Chinese.|$|E
