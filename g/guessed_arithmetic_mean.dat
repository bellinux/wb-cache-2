When individuals are untagged, the <b>arithmetic</b> <b>mean</b> of G for a group of animals must be calculated from weight geometric <b>means,</b> not from <b>arithmetic</b> <b>means.</b> The type of weight mean used in articles to calculate the <b>arithmetic</b> <b>mean</b> of G is usually not reported, and an extended use of weight <b>arithmetic</b> <b>means</b> is common. The <b>arithmetic</b> <b>mean</b> of G so calculated is biased according to the increment in the squared coefficient of variation of body weights. Another potential bias in the calculation of the <b>arithmetic</b> <b>mean</b> of G is size-dependent mortality; this bias cannot be avoided when individuals are untagged, but maximal and minimal values can be obtained.

The problems emphasized either the fair-share or center-of-balance conceptualization, or mathematical concepts related to the <b>arithmetic</b> <b>mean.</b> The participants were divided into three groups: those that received fair-share instruction, those that received center-of-balance instruction, and a control group. The data was analyzed using statistical methods, including contingency tables and ANCOVA, to investigate the effects fair-share and center-of-balance instruction had on knowledge of fair-share, center-of-balance, and mathematical concepts regarding the <b>arithmetic</b> <b>mean.</b> A qualitative analysis of the verbal protocols helped explain any statistically significant connection between the fair-share and center-of-balance conceptualizations, or between either conceptualization and mathematical concepts related to the <b>arithmetic</b> <b>mean.</b> Analysis of the data indicated participants increased their knowledge of the fair-share conceptualization after receiving instruction that was focused on center-of-balance. Similarly, participants increased their knowledge of the center-of-balance conceptualization after receiving instruction that was focused on fair-share.
