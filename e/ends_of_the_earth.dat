He also urges the youth {{and members of the}} church to join him in spreading their doctrine to the <b>ends</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>earth.</b>|$|E
5|$|Amundsen did not {{publicise}} {{his change}} of plan. As Scott's biographer David Crane points out, the expedition's {{public and private}} funding was earmarked for scientific work in the Arctic; there was {{no guarantee that the}} backers would understand or agree to the proposed volte-face. Furthermore, the altered objective might cause Nansen to revoke the use of Fram, or parliament to halt the expedition for fear of undermining Scott and offending the British. Amundsen concealed his intentions from everyone except his brother Leon and his second-in-command, Nilsen. This secrecy led to awkwardness; Scott had sent Amundsen instruments to enable their two expeditions, at opposite <b>ends</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>earth,</b> to make comparative readings. When Scott, in Norway to test his motor sledges, telephoned Amundsen's home to discuss cooperation, the Norwegian would not take the call.|$|E

5|$|In a {{biological}} symbiosis one organism typically shores up some weakness or deficiency of the other(s). As {{in such a}} symbiosis, Odin the father of all humans and gods, though in human form was imperfect by himself. As a separate entity he lacked depth perception (being one-eyed) and he was apparently also uninformed and forgetful. But his weaknesses were compensated by his ravens, Hugin (mind) and Munin (memory) {{who were part of}} him. They perched on his shoulders and reconnoitered to the <b>ends</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>earth</b> each day to return in the evening and tell him the news. He also had two wolves at his side, and the man/god-raven-wolf association was like one single organism in which the ravens were the eyes, mind, and memory, and the wolves the providers of meat and nourishment. As god, Odin was the ethereal part—he only drank wine and spoke only in poetry. I wondered if the Odin myth was a metaphor that playfully and poetically encapsulates ancient knowledge of our prehistoric past as hunters in association with two allies to produce a powerful hunting alliance. It would reflect a past that we have long forgotten and whose meaning has been obscured and badly frayed as we abandoned our hunting cultures to become herders and agriculturists, to whom ravens act as competitors.|$|E

500|$|Originally to {{be called}} The <b>Ends</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Earth,</b> each episode would have ended with the planet Earth meeting its demise in a {{different}} way. While writing the first episode, Adams realised that he needed a character who {{knew what was going}} to happen to Earth before the other characters. He made this character an alien and, remembering an idea he supposedly had had while lying drunk in a field in Innsbruck, Austria in 1971, decided that this character would be a [...] "roving reporter" [...] for The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy, a pan-galactic encyclopedia and travel guide. Recollections by his friends at the time indicate that Adams first spoke of the idea of [...] "hitchhiking around the galaxy" [...] while on holiday in Greece in 1973.|$|E
500|$|Phineus {{was even}} better-traveled than his sister Europa, and his {{biography}} in the Catalogue was [...] apparently a [...] "pièce de résistance" [...] meant to conclude the geographically diverse Inachid stemma with an appropriate flourish. He ruled in Thrace, but was kidnapped by the Harpies. Zetes and Calais, the Boreads, pursued the tormentors and tormented to the <b>ends</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>earth.</b> The poet catalogued many far-flung and remarkable races encountered during the chase, including: the Katoudaioi ("Subterranean Men"), Pygmies, Melanes ("Black Men"), Aethiopians, Libyans, [...] "horse-milking" [...] Scythians, Hemikynes ("Half-Dogs") and the Makrokephaloi, {{as well as}} griffins. Ephorus called the episode the Gês Períodos ( [...] , [...] "Journey Around the World"), and it was once thought that this title referred to an independent work, one erroneously attributed to Hesiod. This view was disproved conclusively in 1911 {{with the publication of}} an extensive papyrus fragment (pictured) of the episode which derived from the same bookroll that contained the myth of Europa described above.|$|E

500|$|Despite its {{deviations}} from Bizet's original format, and some critical reservations, the 1875 Vienna production {{was a great}} success with the city's public, and won praise from both Wagner and Brahms. The latter reportedly saw the opera 20 times, {{and said that he}} would have [...] "gone to the <b>ends</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>earth</b> to embrace Bizet". The Viennese triumph began the opera's rapid ascent towards worldwide fame. In February 1876 it began a run in Brussels at La Monnaie; it returned there the following year, with Galli-Marié in the title role, and thereafter became a permanent fixture in the Brussels repertory. On 17 June 1878 Carmen was produced in London, at Her Majesty's Theatre, where Minnie Hauk began her long association with the part of Carmen. A parallel London production at Covent Garden, with Adelina Patti, was cancelled when Patti withdrew. The successful Her Majesty's production, sung in Italian, had an equally enthusiastic reception in Dublin. On 23 October 1878 the opera received its American premiere, at the New York Academy of Music, and in the same year was introduced to Saint Petersburg.|$|E
500|$|Sheen {{played the}} title role in Peer Gynt in 1994. The Yukio Ninagawa {{production}} was staged in Oslo, Tokyo and at the Barbican Centre, London. The Times praised Sheen's [...] "astonishing vitality" [...] while The Independent found him [...] "sensationally good" [...] and noted that [...] "the Norwegian press were grudgingly captivated by the mercurial Welsh boyo". In other 1994 work, Sheen appeared in Le Livre de Spencer at the Odéon-Théâtre de l'Europe, Paris and starred in the cross-dressing farce Charley's Aunt at the Royal Exchange. In 1995, he appeared opposite Kate Beckinsale in a production of The Seagull at the Theatre Royal, Bath and, with the encouragement of Thelma Holt, directed and starred in The Dresser at the Theatre Royal, Plymouth. In addition, Sheen made his film debut that year, appearing opposite Kenneth Branagh in Othello. 1996 saw Sheen at the National Theatre for The <b>Ends</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Earth,</b> an original play by David Lan. A minor role in [...] Mary Reilly marked {{the first of three}} film collaborations with director Stephen Frears. Sheen's most significant appearance of 1997 was {{the title role}} in Henry V, staged by the Royal Shakespeare Company (RSC) at their Stratford-upon-Avon theatre, which earned him a second Ian Charleson Award nomination. The Times praised [...] "a blisteringly intelligent performance". Also in 1997, he appeared in a revival of Harold Pinter's The Homecoming at the National Theatre, directed by Roger Michell, and directed Badfinger, starring Rhys Ifans, at the Donmar Warehouse. The latter was staged by the Thin Language Theatre Company, which Sheen had co-founded in 1991, aiming to further Welsh theatre. He then appeared in the biographical film Wilde, playing Robbie Ross to Stephen Fry's Oscar Wilde. In early 1998 Sheen formed a production company, The Foundry, with Helen McCrory and Robert Delamere to promote the work of emerging playwrights, and produced A Little World of Our Own at the Donmar Warehouse, which gave Colin Farrell his West End debut.|$|E
500|$|In April 2011, Mercy faces {{deportation}} to Nigeria, and Fatboy {{plans to}} save her by proposing. Norwood revealed that Mercy is shocked by the proposal, adding [...] "Mercy thinks he's lost his marbles, but soon comes round to the idea. Fatboy reckons that this isn't about his feelings, it's all about keeping her in the UK. Of course, he's also hoping that if she stays, maybe she'll end up liking him {{in the way he}} likes her. [...] You can get into a lot of trouble for , ut all Fatboy can think is, 'How can I save Mercy?' She's the girl he loves." [...] Although Fatboy is in love with Mercy, he does not believe that Mercy sees him as more than a friend and may call off the wedding if he tells her. He does not think of the consequences, such as imprisonment. Norwood revealed that Fatboy has known Mercy since they were nine years old and he had feelings for her when EastEnders: E20 started, as he was upset when she got pregnant by someone else. He said that Fatboy would be heartbroken when Mercy leaves. Norwood told Inside Soap that the wedding creates more problems for the characters, rather than solving all their problems. The fact that they try so hard to prove they are genuine makes it [...] "very hard for them to be friends." [...] The wedding episode sees Fatboy have a dream come true, {{but at the same time}} it is a nightmare for him. Knowing the wedding is a sham he is [...] "waiting for that monster to appear". Ashley turns up and is annoyed that Fatboy has kept the wedding a secret, and of this, Norwood stated: [...] "When [...] finds out what has happened he is pretty shocked. He tries to make Fatboy see the consequences of his actions, but Fatboy doesn't want to hear it—his dad has already betrayed him when it comes to Mercy." [...] Mercy is shocked to learn that Fatboy did not tell her that Ashley reported her. Although Norwood concluded that Fatboy [...] "will go to the <b>ends</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>earth</b> to make this marriage work".|$|E
