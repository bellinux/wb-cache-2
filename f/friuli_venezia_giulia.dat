25|$|In Italy {{the species}} {{is found in the}} wild in <b>Friuli</b> <b>Venezia</b> <b>Giulia,</b> Veneto and Trentino-Alto Adige/Südtirol. In the High Adriatic Hinterland, its {{distribution}} has been recently updated by Lapini et al. (2009). In 1984 Canis aureus had reached the Province of Belluno, in 1985 a pack reproduced near Udine (this group was eliminated in 1987), a road-killed jackal was collected in Veneto in 1992, and their presence was then confirmed in the Province of Gorizia and in the hinterland of the Gulf of Trieste. In these cases, the specimens were usually roaming male subadults, though a family-group was discovered in Agordino in 1994. A young dead female was discovered on 10 December 2009 in Carnia, indicating that the species' range has continued to expand. Moreover, in the late summer of 2009, the species was also signalled in Trentino-Alto Adige/Südtirol, where it has likely reached the Puster Valley. The Italian branch of WWF estimates that jackal numbers in Italy may be underestimated. The golden jackal is a protected animal in Italy.|$|E

2500|$|Saint Lucy's Day, {{also called}} the Feast of Saint Lucy, is a Christian feast day celebrated on 13 December in Advent, commemorating Saint Lucy, a 3rd-century martyr under the Diocletianic Persecution, who {{according}} to legend brought [...] "food and aid to Christians hiding in the catacombs" [...] using a candle-lit wreath to [...] "light her way and leave her hands free to carry as much food as possible". In Norway, Sweden and Swedish-speaking regions of Finland, as songs are sung, girls dressed as Saint Lucy carry cookies and saffron buns in procession, which [...] "symbolizes bringing the light of Christianity throughout world darkness." [...] In both Protestant and Catholic churches, boys participate in the procession as well, playing different roles associated with Christmas, {{such as that of}} Saint Stephen. It is said that to vividly celebrate Saint Lucy's Day will help one live the long winter days with enough light. A special devotion to Saint Lucy is practiced in the Italian regions of Lombardy, Emilia-Romagna, Veneto, <b>Friuli</b> <b>Venezia</b> <b>Giulia,</b> Trentino-Alto Adige, in the north of the country, and Sicily, in the south, as well as in Croatian coastal region of Dalmatia.
