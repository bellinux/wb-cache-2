These methods capture whether a region’s clusters are evolving and, if so, how they are changing. Built on the foundation of tra-ditional quantitative cluster analysis techniques, these additional screening methods can capture entrepreneurial and innovative activity within the industry cluster context at an earlier stage than traditional methods can. This approach can provide industry sector clues as to what may drive future cluster development, both positive and negative, and it can offer early-stage opportuni-ties to assess job quality and productivity to help determine the sustainability of new cluster developments...|$|R

In line with an increasing globalization, the Danish government is pressured from an experience economic, financial market development, {{which results in}} an experience economy initial plan in 2007. Subsequently the experience economy has {{become an integral part}} of corporate strategy developments, which further have resulted in a <b>value-based</b> <b>development</b> of society, thus affecting the consumer. In 2012, the Danish population's cultural habits can be characterized as active or very active, with stringent requirements for unique experiences additionally becoming part of the personal identity. This creates major development requirements for museums, which are pressured into following the experience economic market development, that result in the institution now compromising its actual functions as cultural mediators, and thus loses authenticity and authority which creates some ethical issues; in that value attribution of things’ authenticity disappears...|$|R
40|$|The thesis {{presents}} an innovative approach to development and proposal of solutions {{based on their}} value added to buildings. The approach is inspired by the ongoing DIGIBUILD project, which promotes the idea to reveal a performance gap by integrating and continuously comparing the actual and the intended performances of facilities. Such approach requires a shift towards a performance-focused business model. Consequently, <b>value-based</b> <b>development</b> of products and services enables cumulative improvement of a building ecosystem and enhances sustainability aspects. The purpose of this thesis {{is to develop a}} roadmap of the performance gap revealing process, that is, to describe tasks, outcome, challenges and implementation practices. The study discusses such processes as performance monitoring and modeling, performance evaluation and benchmarking, as well as concerns critical drivers towards a performance-focused business model including procurement, value-based sales and performance-based contracting. Generally, the study is conducted as an exploratory research, namely a design science approach. The literature and the analysis of three EU projects (PERFECTION, LinkedDesign, and TOPAs) contribute to the findings of research. While the literature facilitates the initial understanding on the performance gap-revealing problem, EU projects present the implementation cases and enable the evaluation against the DIGIBUILD concepts...|$|R
40|$|Thesis (M. Sc.) -Unversity of KwaZulu-Natal, Durban, 2009. The {{dissertation}} explores {{and explains}} {{the design and}} development of the researcher's Real Value© methodology, through participative action research. The action research (participative exploratory research) was undertaken in the form of professional pilot projects as real world commercial research, for the formulation and emergence of the <b>value-based</b> business <b>development</b> leadership metrics system: The Real Value© Methodology. The outcomes of the action research are captured in select strategic knowledge reports (i. e. client pilot project research reports) which demonstrate the emergence of the Real Value© methodology, in the client and commercial context, through the entire action research process. The clients were contracted on a professional basis and the fees generated from the commercial projects were utilised to fund the resources required to do the knowledge investigations of the client organisations. The methodology was intended as a strategic management system, and subsequently developed, through the action research and pilot projects, into a <b>value-based</b> business <b>development</b> leadership metrics system. The Real Value© methodology aims to create, develop and measure the real value of intangible assets (vs. physical assets) in a continuous and discontinuous process of business development: value that is created and sustained through the highest and best application and utilisation of intangible assets in the knowledge (and industrial) economic context. (Intangible assets herein classified as brand, intellectual property, technology, and human and customer capital). The participative action research was originally inspired by the first Module of the MSc programme 'Managing Complexity' facilitated by Professor Steen Martiny (Copenhagen Business School) during the comparative exercise on 'Extraordinary and Ordinary Management', and specifically during the reading of the first precept of Stacey's (2000) 'Extraordinary Management Theory': "Detect and attract attention to important external and internal issues, ordinarily not noticed. " The above precept captures the essence and intrinsic motivation of the researcher for undertaking and performing the participative action research of the dissertation. The dissertation explains the real world professional pilot projects and participative exploratory action research that was undertaken by the researcher in the design {{and development of the}} Real Value© methodology...|$|R

The VBS systems deal with financial streams and this thing make them different from the conventional systems. The success of a VBS system is associated with a valuable set of requirements. The valuable requirements can only be gathered from success critical stakeholders. To select a set of success critical stakeholders, different stakeholders identification and quantification (SIQ) approaches are presented by the researchers. The current approaches cannot be adopted as a standard as different methods and processes are adopted in different approaches. In this study, the aim is to find out the reported evidence based attributes or characteristics of the stakeholders and their usage context in terms of their application in different domains, stakeholders' quantification metrics, the reported stakeholder types and the reported issues of VBS development. The standard systematic literature review guidelines are used as given by Barbara Kitchenham. The literature evidence shows {{that there is a need}} to explore all the possible stakeholders' attributes. The stakeholders' metrics can be derived by using the stakeholders' attributes and a new SIQ framework can be proposed for the VBS systems...|$|R

(2) What are the similarities and differences between men 2 ̆ 7 s and women 2 ̆ 7 s patterns of ethical leadership development? (3) What differences and similarities exist between women 2 ̆ 7 s and men 2 ̆ 7 s ethical leadership practice? (4) What are the implications and recommendations for leadership development programs?;Those questions led to the following observations: (1) Male and female leaders in this study share several major influences that shape their ethical perspectives; they are family influences, critical incidents, mentors and role-models. (2) The ability to subscribe to a transcendent view (state) was essential to these male and female leaders. (3) The women in this study relied more on relationships than did men for their perspectives on the world and in the solving of problems.

40|$|Purpose: The {{growing concern}} for social {{responsibility}} and/or business ethics must {{be reflected in}} the control systems of organizations. Therefore we are concerned to analyze whether the ethical codes have been introduced as a management tool of social responsibility to build sustainable <b>value-based</b> organizations. Design/methodology/approach: <b>Development</b> of a survey based on the literature review of code types and motivations. We performed a descriptive analysis of the information obtained from companies based in Andalusia under study. Furthermore, it has been implemented a test of mean difference and an analysis of variance to contrast the hypotheses. Findings: The study supports a tendency to use the ethical codes by Andalusian companies analyzed, influenced by firm size. Similarly, the incidence of immediate environment is confirmed. Research limitations/implications: The study is exploratory in the Andalusian area due to restrictions databases and sample size. Practical implications: The results allow an approach to the Andalusian business reality and to the management systems related with social responsibility and business ethics. Social implications: It has highlighted the need for training in this area and that measures to promote ethics and corporate social responsibility are taken from the public sector, distinguishing between needs that may have micro and small enterprises from medium or large companies. Originality/value: This study contributes to knowledge about the importance of integrating instruments that promote responsible and sustainable management based on values in management control systems and about what were the motivations that are influencing both, for and against, in this action. Motivations that should be taken into account by decision-makers and influential in business development agencies. Peer Reviewe...|$|R
40|$|In the article, {{the authors}} propose the {{conceptual}} fundamentals of the “code approach” {{to the regional}} neo-industrial development. The purpose of the research is to reveal {{the essence of the}} transition to a new type of industrial and economic relations through a prism of “genetic codes” of the region. We consider these codes as a system of the “racial memory” of a territory, which determines the specificity and features of neo-industrialization realization. We substantiated the hypothesis about the influence of the “genetic codes” of the region on the effectiveness of the neo-industrialization. We have defined the participants, or else the carriers of the codes in the transformation of regional inheritance for the stimulation of the neoindustrial development of region’s economy. The subject matter of the research is the distinctive features of the functioning of the determinative region’s codes. Their content determines the socio-economic specificity of the region and the features of innovative, informational, <b>value-based</b> and competence-based <b>development</b> of the territory. The determinative codes generate the dynamic codes of the region, which are understood as their derivatives. They have a high probability of occurrence, higher speed of development and distribution, internal forces that make possible the self-development of the region. The scientific contribution is the substantiation of the basic code of the regional neo-industrial development. It represents the evolutionary accumulation of the rapid changes of its innovative, informational, value-based and competence-based codes stimulating the generation and implementation of new ideas regarding to economic entities adapted to the historical and cultural conditions. The article presents the code model of neo-industrial development of the region described by formulas. We applied the system analysis methods, historical and civilization approaches, evolutionary and institutional theory, economic and mathematical methods. Moreover, in the article, the authors presented the findings for the period 2011 – 2016 reflecting the empirical estimation of the importance of informational, institutional, innovative, value-based and competence-based codes. We made this estimation through the survey of population, representatives of business and authorities, students, as well as the professors of the leading universities of the Ural Federal District. The focus of the recommendations for the region is the acceleration of the transition to the new type of industrial development. The research results can be used when developing the programmes and projects of neo- and reindustrialization at both federal and regional levels...|$|R
40|$|Since the 1980 s {{there has}} been a search for {{alternative}} approaches to development that encompasses different variables of the social systems. The most recent evolution of development thought has been characterized by a multidimensional approach to development, also referred to as the human development approach. In this approach attention is drawn towards the significance of ethics and values in development. The recognition of <b>development</b> as a <b>value-based</b> process opens up to address {{the role of religion in}} development processes. In this thesis I have explored the role of religion within a <b>value-based</b> conception of <b>development.</b> The geographical area of focus for this research is Ethiopia and the Norwegian Church Aid (NCA) presence in this country. During my fieldwork I have, through interviews and observation, gained understanding of how NCA understands the role of religion in development in Ethiopia. The thesis shows that in some areas of NCA’s development practice collaboration with religious leaders and faith-based organizations (FBO) is especially emphasized and regarded as essential to achieve certain development objectives. NCA have involved religious leaders at both local and national level into their development practice. Religious leaders influential mandated position and credibility, in local communities and national institutions, is recognized as both potentially constructive and obstructive to the process of development. Examined cases, conducted interviews and observations in this thesis reveal an instrumental approach to religion in NCA’s development practice. However, this does not provide the full picture. NCA also appears to facilitate for a more informed understanding of development that takes place at a conceptual level. Religious leaders and FBO’s are encouraged and challenged into conceptualising processes where religious norms and values are explored and examined in relation to development. The outcome of these processes seems to pave the way for the emergence of new values that better incorporates and acknowledges the existence and interest of both religion and development. The role of religion in NCA’s development practice appears as a dynamic dialogue between the sacred and the profane where religion is regarded as a natural and almost an inevitably part of development. NCA’s objective seems to be focused on finding common ground between religion and development in fighting poverty. The analysis and discussion in this thesis shows that the role of religion in development is not merely about how religion can inform the concept of development, but also about how development can inform the concept of religion...|$|R
