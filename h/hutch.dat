5|$|The {{award is}} {{presented}} annually at the <b>Hutch</b> Award Luncheon {{hosted by the}} Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center in Seattle, Washington, at Safeco Field. The award was originally {{presented at the annual}} Dapper Dan Banquet in Pittsburgh. Each winner receives a copy of the original trophy, designed by Dale Chihuly. The permanent display of the <b>Hutch</b> Award is at the National Baseball Hall of Fame in Cooperstown, New York, where it has been since 1979.|$|E
5|$|Meanwhile, Hazel and Pipkin, the {{smallest}} {{member of the}} group, scout the nearby Nuthanger Farm, where they find two pairs of <b>hutch</b> rabbits. Despite their uncertainty about living wild, the <b>hutch</b> rabbits are willing to come to Watership. Hazel leads a raid on the farm the next day, during which he rescues both does but {{only one of the}} bucks. When the emissary returns soon after, Hazel and his rabbits learn that Efrafa is a police state led by the despotic General Woundwort. Holly and the other rabbits dispatched there have managed to return with little more than their lives intact.|$|E

5|$|Among {{the nine}} {{underground}} tests, which were carried between 1962 and 1969 and codenamed Anacostia (5.2 kilotons, 1962), Kennebec (<5 kilotons, 1963), Par (38, kilotons, 1964), Barbel (<20 kilotons, 1964), Tweed (<20 kilotons, 1965), Cyclamen (13 kilotons, 1966), Kankakee (20-200 kilotons, 1966), Vulcan (25 kilotons, 1966) and <b>Hutch</b> (20-200 kilotons, 1969), {{the last one}} was most powerful and had the highest yield of transuranium elements. In the dependence on the atomic mass number, the yield showed a saw-tooth behavior with the lower values for odd isotopes, due to their higher fission rates. The major practical problem of the entire proposal was however collecting the radioactive debris dispersed by the powerful blast. Aircraft filters adsorbed only about 4 of the total amount and collection of tons of corals at Enewetak Atoll increased this fraction by only two orders of magnitude. Extraction of about 500 kilograms of underground rocks 60 days after the <b>Hutch</b> explosion recovered only about 10−7 of the total charge. The amount of transuranium elements in this 500-kg batch was only 30 times higher than in a 0.4 kg rock picked up 7 days after the test. This observation demonstrated the highly nonlinear dependence of the transuranium elements yield {{on the amount of}} retrieved radioactive rock. In order to accelerate sample collection after explosion, shafts were drilled at the site not after but before the test, so that explosion would expel radioactive material from the epicenter, through the shafts, to collecting volumes near the surface. This method was tried in the Anacostia and Kennebec tests and instantly provided hundreds kilograms of material, but with actinide concentration 3 times lower than in samples obtained after drilling; whereas such method could have been efficient in scientific studies of short-lived isotopes, it could not improve the overall collection efficiency of the produced actinides.|$|E
5|$|Shortly thereafter, {{however, the}} Owsla of Efrafa, led by Woundwort himself arrives {{to attack the}} newly formed warren at Watership Down. Through Bigwig's bravery and loyalty, and Hazel's ingenuity, the Watership Down rabbits seal {{the fate of the}} Efrafan general by unleashing the Nuthanger Farm watchdog. As the Efrafans flee in terror, Woundwort, a {{formidable}} fighter by rabbit standards, fearlessly stands his ground as he and the dog simultaneously lunge at each other. Woundwort's body is never found, and at least one of his former followers continues to believe in his survival. Hazel is nearly killed by a cat, but he is saved by the farm girl Lucy, the owner of the escaped <b>hutch</b> rabbits.|$|E
5|$|Two Angels first-round picks, outfielder Darin Erstad (1995) {{and third}} basemen Troy Glaus (1997), {{played with the}} 2002 World Series {{championship}} team. Outfielder Mike Trout, who was chosen in 2009 and has spent his entire MLB career to date with the Angels, was named American League Rookie of the Year in 2012, and has finished no worse than second in voting for American League Most Valuable Player {{in each of his}} first five full seasons with the Angels, winning that award in 2014 and 2016. Pitcher Jim Abbott (1988), born without a right hand, won the 1987 Golden Spikes Award while playing at the University of Michigan, and the 1992 Tony Conigliaro Award and the 1995 <b>Hutch</b> Award while with the Angels. Danny Goodwin (1975), who was picked first overall in 1971 by the Chicago White Sox but opted for four years of college, is the only player to be selected first in the draft on two separate occasions.|$|E

Milligrams of einsteinium that would normally take a year of irradiation in a high-power reactor, were produced within a microsecond. However, the major practical problem of the entire proposal was collecting the radioactive debris dispersed by the powerful blast.

25|$|Though {{all this}} it still {{remained}} {{the larger of}} the two major bodies. The ABA has demonstrated over the years the desire to become even larger. In a plan to diversify and not rely on its BMX income totally for its survival, the ABA purchased the National Off Road Bicycle Association (NORBA) in the summer of 1986 (The ABA later sold NORBA to the United States Cycling Federation (USCF) in 1989). It also acquired from <b>Hutch</b> Hi-Performance Products, a respected BMX bicycle manufacturer, the National Freestyle Association (NFA) a BMX Freestyle sanctioning body. <b>Hutch</b> had recently reacquired the body back from the USBA which it had sold it to a few months prior. <b>Hutch,</b> which had started the NFA in the first place, sold it to the USBA because competing manufactures were reluctant to send their freestyle teams to a sanctioning body run by a competitor, therefore helping him financially. The USBA suffering its own financial dire straits sold it back to <b>Hutch</b> who in turn sold it to the ABA.|$|E

A two-mirror system will be used in order to reduce background radiation in near and far experimental <b>hutches.</b> This paper describes the layout of the two-mirror system and also reports on the shielding requirements for the experimental <b>hutches.</b> Two beam loss scenarios for radiation sources are discussed: losses from the high energy electron beam hitting beam components and x-rays produced in the 130 m long undulator and scattered on x-ray mirrors. The FLUKA Monte-Carlo particle transport code was used for the shielding design and for the determination of the radiation levels around the experimental <b>hutches...</b>|$|R
25|$|Before 1856 the Victoria Pit and Barcraig Pit, {{respectively}} {{west and}} east of the little harbour of West Wemyss, were connected to it by short tramways.

25|$|With 22 {{poles and}} 14 wins between 1964 and 1968, <b>Hutch</b> retired from full-schedule racing to {{concentrate}} on his chassis-building business in Charlotte. After four years of top-level racing he became crew chief for his friend and fellow driver David Pearson in 1968. The combination won the championship in 1968 and 1969. In 1968 he also appeared in the Elvis Presley stock car racing movie Speedway.|$|E
40|$|Companion rabbits can be {{housed in}} a wide variety of {{accommodations}} including <b>hutches</b> of smaller dimensions as compared with those that are legally required for laboratory and farmed rabbits. Small rabbit enclosures may restrict behavior patterns including hopping, stretching, and rearing and may compromise rabbit welfare especially when these activities are important to the rabbits. To investigate this possibility, 19 rabbits of different sizes and breeds were housed in small pens equivalent to floor areas of <b>hutches</b> (0. 88 m 2), medium pens approximately twice the floor area of conventional <b>hutches</b> (1. 68 m 2), and large pens approximately 4 times the floor area of conventional <b>hutches</b> (3. 35 m 2). Through scan sampling, 24 -hour time budgets of the rabbits were determined and their response to a change in enclosure size was assessed by continuously sampling their behavior for 2 hours after their transfer into different-sized pens. Mixed model analysis using rabbit as the repeated measure found that rabbits were generally more active and interacted more with environmental resources in larger pens compared with smaller pens (P < 0. 05). Also, rabbits exhibited a rebound effect in activity and rearing when moved from a smaller sized pen to a larger sized pen (P < 0. 05). These findings show that larger pens provide behavioral opportunities that are restricted in smaller pens, and suggest that smaller <b>hutches</b> can jeopardize rabbit welfare.

50|$|Because of {{the thin}} coal seams, a special type of mining was practised at Arigna. A main tunnel was driven from which {{branched}} {{a series of}} secondary tunnels every 5-6 meters, where the coal was mined. The secondary tunnels followed the seams and were rather low. The miners typically worked lying on their back to cut the coal. These 'Cutters' or 'Brushers' also prepared the mine for the next days work, and extended the roads using explosives. 'Drawers' filled <b>hutches</b> (tubs) and pushed {{them out to the}} main underground mine road. Here the <b>hutches</b> were linked up to an endless-rope haulage system and were pulled to the outside. Sometimes small diesel locomotives were used to pull <b>hutches</b> out of the pit. 'Proppers' used timber pillars to prop up the mine roof.|$|R
