While Richards {{was in charge of}} the radioisotope production at the <b>Hot</b> <b>Lab</b> Division of the Brookhaven National Laboratory, Walter Tucker and Margaret Greene were working on how to improve the separation process purity of the short-lived eluted daughter product iodine-132 from tellurium-132, its 3.2-days parent, produced in the Brookhaven Graphite Research Reactor. They detected a trace contaminant which proved to be Tc-99m, which was coming from Mo-99 and was following tellurium in the chemistry of the separation process for other fission products. Based on the similarities between the chemistry of the tellurium-iodine parent-daughter pair, Tucker and Greene developed the first technetium-99m generator in 1958 (see photo of this generator at the beginning of the article). It was not until 1960 that Richards became the first to suggest the idea of using technetium as a medical tracer.|$|E

Isotope ratios of materials routinely range over 4 – 8 orders of magnitude in a single experiment, dosing solutions contain thousands of DPM and gels used to separate proteins possess 14 C ratios of 1 amol 14 C/mg C. Radiocarbon contamination is a legacy of earlier tracer work in most biological laboratories, {{even if they were}} never <b>hot</b> <b>labs.</b> Removable surface contamination can be found and monitored using swipes. Contamination can be found on any surface routinely touched: door knobs, light switches, drawer handles, water faucets. In general, all surfaces routinely touched need to be covered with paper, foil or plastic that can be changed frequently. Shared air supplies can also present problems by distributing hot aerosols throughout a building. Aerosols can be monitored for 14 C content using graphitized coal or fullerene soot mixed with metal powder as an absorber. The monitors can be set out in work spaces for 1 – 2 weeks and measured by AMS with regular samples. Frequent air changes help minimize aerosol contamination in many cases. Cross-contamination of samples can be minimized by using disposable plastic or glassware in the prep lab, isolating samples from the air when possible and using positive displacement pipettors...|$|R

The <b>Hot</b> Spot <b>Lab</b> is configured to fly anywhere in the world and is staffed by expert scientists and technicians from Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory who perform similar functions in their routine jobs. The Hot Spot Team carries sample control kits to provide responding field teams with the procedures, tools, and equipment for sample collection and field measurements. High-hazard samples brought back from the field are prepared for analysis in HEPA-filtered gloveboxes staffed by technicians from LLNL's Plutonium Facility. The samples are passed on to the Mobile Laboratory which carries a variety of radiological and chemical analytical equipment in portable configuration for use in the field. Equipment and personnel can also deploy special assets to local hospitals or the field for detection of plutonium in a lung or wound. Quick assessment of personnel contamination is essential for time-critical medical intervention.

40|$|The {{key to the}} {{understanding}} of the mechanical behavior of dual phase (DP) steels is to a large extent to be found in the microstructure. The microstructure is in its turn a result of the chemical composition and the process parameters during its production. In this thesis the connection between microstructure and mechanical properties is studied, with focus on the microstructure development during annealing in a continuous annealing line. In-line trials as well as the lab simulations have been carried out in order to investigate the impact of alloying elements and process parameters on the microstructure. Further, a dislocation model has been developed in order to analyze the work hardening behavior of DP steels during plastic deformation. From the in-line trials it was concluded that there is an inheritance from the hot rolling process both on the microstructure and properties of the cold rolled and annealed product. Despite large cold rolling reductions, recrystallization and phase transformations, the final dual phase steel is still effected by process parameters far back in the production chain, such as the coiling temperature following the <b>hot</b> rolling. <b>Lab</b> simulations showed that the microstructure and consequently the mechanical properties are impacted not only by the chemical composition of the steel but also by a large number of process parameters such as soaking temperature, cooling rate prior to quenching, quench and temper annealing temperature.  QC 2010100...|$|R
40|$|The Airborne Infrared Disaster Assessment System (AIRDAS) is a {{four-channel}} scanner {{designed and}} built at NASA-Ames for the specific task of supporting research and applications on fire impacts on terrestrial and atmospheric processes and also of serving as a vital instrument {{in the assessment of}} natural and man-induced disasters. The system has been flown on numerous airframes including the Navajo, King-Air, C 0130, and Lear Jet 310 and a 206. The system includes a configuration composed of a 386 PC computer workstation, a non-linear detector amplifier, a sixteen-bit digitizer, dichroic filters, and Exabyte 8500 5 Gb Tape output, VHS tape output, a Rockwell GPS and a 2 -axis gyro. The AIRDAS system collects digital data in four wavelength regions, which can be filtered: band 1 (0. 61 - 0. 68 microns), band 2 (1. 57 - 1. 7 microns), band 3 (3. 6 - 5. 5 microns), and band 4 (5. 5 - 13. 0 microns), an FOV of 108 degrees, an IFOV of 2. 62 mrads, and a digitized swath width of 720 pixels. The inclusion of the non-linear detector amplifier allows for the accurate measurement of emitted temperature from fires and <b>hot</b> spots. <b>Lab</b> testing of the scanner has indicated temperature assessments of 800 C without detector saturation. This has advantages over previous systems which were designed for thermal measurement of earth background temperatures, and were ill-equipped for accurate determination of high intensity conditions.

40|$|The archaeobotanical {{record from}} the Takarkori rockshelter (Fezzan, {{south-western}} Libya) was systematically {{collected in the}} 2003 - 2006 excavation seasons. The archaeological excavation was carried out over a surface of ca. 120 square metres and brought to light occupation layers radiocarbon dated between ca. 4500 and 8900 uncal. years bp. The rockshelter hosts a 1. 6 m thick archaeological deposit including structures, fireplaces and burials {{of women and children}} interred near the shelter wall. An impressive amount of mainly desiccated and well preserved plant macroremains was brought to light from Late Acacus and Pastoral layers. Known amount of sediment (3 or 6 l) were dry sieved. Charcoals and seeds/fruits concentrations visible to naked eye were also collected. Pollen was sampled from on-site trenches including different amount of organic matter: the best results were obtained from a sequence of thirty samples. The main pollen zones were in agreement with main cultural changes in the archaeological record. Moreover, the exceptionally well-preserved fruits of Poaceae encouraged analyses on aDNA (done in the Centre for Ancient DNA Research of the University of Copenhagen). The extraction of ancient DNA was carried out on records from three samples of Poaceae fruits accumulation (spot n° 8136, 1423 and A 2908). Two of the spot samples are dated to ca. 8000 uncal. years bp; one is dated to ca. 6000 - 5500 uncal. years bp.

40|$|Modern PET/CT clinics {{consist of}} a scanner room housing the double gantry PET/CT unit and a control area, two or more quiet rooms where {{patients}} rest prior to scanning, and a <b>hot</b> <b>lab</b> where doses are prepared. Of these areas, the scanner room, quiet rooms, and frequently the <b>hot</b> <b>lab</b> require structural shielding to protect staff and personnel in surrounding areas. The 511 keV photons from the PET positron emitting isotopes are the source term for the quiet rooms and the <b>hot</b> <b>lab,</b> while both the 511 keV photons and the polyenergtic spectrum of x-rays from the CT unit must be considered for the scanner room. We have developed a three dimensional model of the PET quiet rooms and the PET/CT scanner room for the Monte Carlo code MCNP Ver 5, and for the Mercurad shielding code. The quiet room 18 model consists of a MIRD phantom in a reclining position with 555 MBq (15 mCi) of F distributed {{in the brain and}} bladder. All room structures to include the layered floor and ceiling shields are modeled. For the scanner room, the double gantry of the PET/CT unit is modeled as two rings with dimensions and attenuation based on a current PET/CT unit.

The study includes hazards of ionizing radiations, classification, radioactive waste management (pretreatment, treatment, conditioning storage, transportation and disposal) and radioisotopes used in NCRNM and exist in the interim storage. During the study, the practice of disposal of radioactive waste was observed during generation and before disposal, the procedures utilized at both sites were interviews, site visits, hard practical work (measurements) and photography. The objectives of the study is the assessment of current treatment disposal and temporary storage of radioactive waste advising on the appropriate way of management of radioactive waste in the country (Sudan) and to evaluate the radioactive waste management system and its compliance with national and international regulations. In present work doses were measured at different locations in the department of nuclear medicine at (NCRNM) and around interim storage at Suba. At NCRNM the locations were selected around the radioactive liquid and solid waste disposal positions. It was found that the dose equivalent value per year from radioactive wastes obtained through this work using the survey meter RDS – 120 at these locations are: In the hot laboratories, equivalent dose per year for the workers was found to be (6. 0 mSv/year), in the <b>hot</b> <b>lab</b> of Technetium- 99 m, and (6. 27 mSv/year) in the <b>hot</b> <b>lab</b> of iodine waste, which is not exceeding the nationally and internationally set action level (20 mSv/year). This clearly indicates that, currently, the disposal and handling practices are appropriate, however, in the <b>hot</b> <b>lab</b> of iodine the waste is not regularly collected and disposed of. In other locations in (NCRNM), effective doses were below recommended dose limits for the public which is (1 mSv/year). According to the results mentioned above; we can 7 say that the management of low level radioactive waste in (NCRNM) so far is good and going on improving. At the interim storage, the values of the effective doses measured, around the storage were around natural background radiation so, if it is supported with a well fence, this will be safer and indicate good management of the radioactive waste exist there. The last step of low-intermediate level radioactive waste management in sudan is storage, either for decay or return back to the supplier, for short lived waste, release to the sanitary system after storage for decay (for liquid waste), and exemption after storage for decay for solid waste.
