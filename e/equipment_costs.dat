5|$|As an {{industrial}} process, {{the cost of}} welding {{plays a crucial role}} in manufacturing decisions. Many different variables affect the total cost, including equipment cost, labor cost, material cost, and energy cost. Depending on the process, equipment cost can vary, from inexpensive for methods like shielded metal arc welding and oxyfuel welding, to extremely expensive for methods like laser beam welding and electron beam welding. Because of their high cost, they are only used in high production operations. Similarly, because automation and robots increase <b>equipment</b> <b>costs,</b> they are only implemented when high production is necessary. Labor cost depends on the deposition rate (the rate of welding), the hourly wage, and the total operation time, including time spent fitting, welding, and handling the part. The cost of materials includes the cost of the base and filler material, and the cost of shielding gases. Finally, energy cost depends on arc time and welding power demand.|$|E
5|$|Energy {{beam welding}} methods, namely {{laser beam welding}} and {{electron}} beam welding, are relatively new processes that have become quite popular in high production applications. The two processes are quite similar, differing most notably in their source of power. Laser beam welding employs a highly focused laser beam, while electron beam welding is done in a vacuum and uses an electron beam. Both {{have a very high}} energy density, making deep weld penetration possible and minimizing the size of the weld area. Both processes are extremely fast, and are easily automated, making them highly productive. The primary disadvantages are their very high <b>equipment</b> <b>costs</b> (though these are decreasing) and a susceptibility to thermal cracking. Developments in this area include laser-hybrid welding, which uses principles from both laser beam welding and arc welding for even better weld properties, laser cladding, and x-ray welding.|$|E
5|$|Sleeping Dogs is an action-adventure game set {{in an open}} world {{environment}} and played from a third-person perspective. The player controls Wei Shen, a Chinese-American police officer who goes undercover and infiltrates the Sun On Yee Triad organization. The first missions of the game are a linear tutorial for controlling the character. After these missions, the player is allowed to explore the game's world and take part in side missions and other activities. Shen navigates the world by running, jumping, climbing over obstacles, swimming, and driving cars, boats and motorcycles. The heads-up display (HUD) interface features a mini-map that indicates targets, key locations (safe houses and contact points) and Shen's current position. The mini-map incorporates two meters: one shows Shen's health and the other his face. When the face meter fills, upgrades are unlocked such as health regeneration, improved combat abilities and reduced <b>equipment</b> <b>costs.</b> The HUD also displays the weapon carried and its ammunition count.|$|E

An energy park with multiple such reservoirs would bring the storage cost to around a few eurocents per kWh with construction and <b>equipment</b> <b>costs</b> in the range €1,200-€1,400 per kW. To avoid excessive transmission cost and loss, the reservoirs should be placed off deep water coasts of densely populated areas, such as Norway, Spain, USA and Japan.

25|$|Partly due to low {{awareness}} {{among the}} general population and prohibitive <b>equipment</b> <b>costs,</b> the number of licensed amateur radio operators did not increase significantly {{over the next two}} decades, numbering fewer than a thousand by 1970. CW (Morse code) and AM were the predominant modes at that time. The electronic equipment was mostly valve-based, obtained from Indian army surpluses. During the mid-1960s, the modes of operation saw a change from Amplitude Modulation to Single Side Band (SSB) as the preferred communication mode. By 1980, the number of amateur radio operators had risen to 1,500. In 1984, then Indian Prime Minister, Rajiv Gandhi, waived the import duty for wireless equipment. After this, the number of operators rose steadily, and by 2000 there were 10,000 licensed ham operators. As of 2007, there are more than 17,000 licensed users in India.|$|E
50|$|The {{economics}} of plastics processing {{is determined by}} the type of process. Plastics can be processed with the following methods: machining, compression molding, transfer molding, injection molding, extrusion, rotational molding, blow molding, thermoforming, casting, forging, and foam molding. Processing methods are selected based on <b>equipment</b> <b>cost,</b> production rate, tooling cost, and build volume. High <b>equipment</b> and tooling <b>cost</b> methods are typically used for large production volumes whereas low - medium <b>equipment</b> <b>cost</b> and tooling cost methods are used for low production volumes.

Whether TLD measurements can be performed cheaper with an automatic reader (with a higher <b>equipment</b> <b>cost,</b> but lower workload) or with a semi-automatic reader (lower <b>equipment</b> <b>cost,</b> but higher workload), depends on the number of checks in the department. LSP-systems (with a very high <b>equipment</b> <b>cost)</b> as well as on-line imaging systems will be cheaper portal imaging techniques than conventional port films (with high material costs) for large departments, or for smaller departments that perform frequent volume checks. status: publishe...|$|R

2500|$|The Denver & Rio Grande Railway (D) was {{incorporated}} on October 27, 1870 by General William Jackson Palmer and {{a board of}} four directors.
