5|$|To save money, many sets, {{particularly}} interiors, were redresses {{of existing}} sets. The Enterprise bridge was reconfigured {{to stand in}} for the Grissom, with the chairs reupholstered and the central computer consoles moved to modify the floor plan. An Earth bar and the Klingon medical bay were redresses of the Enterprise sickbay. The Klingon bridge was a set that Nimoy appropriated from another production. Many blinking consoles were rented from a props company rather than being fabricated. The Enterprise bridge itself remained largely unchanged from its appearance in the previous films, though the floor was repainted from black to grey to make it photograph better. The most drastic change was made to Spock's quarters. Nimoy <b>had</b> <b>felt</b> <b>the</b> previous grey color scheme did not express a Vulcan style, and had it brightened with yellows and oranges.|$|E
5|$|Although {{no longer}} a Rangers employee, Smythe was invited to the Rangers' opening game in Madison Square Garden by Tex Rickard, an {{invitation}} he nearly turned down because he <b>had</b> <b>felt</b> <b>the</b> Rangers had short-changed him. Hammond paid Smythe $7,500 to settle his contract, and Smythe felt he was owed $10,000. At the insistence of his wife Irene, they traveled to New York and attended the opener in Rickard's private box. When the Rangers won the game, surprising the Montreal Maroons, Rickard offered Smythe a vice-presidency with the club. Smythe turned the Rangers down, {{partly because of the}} disputed $2,500, although Rickard ordered Hammond to pay off the rest. On the return trip to Toronto, Conn and Irene visited Montreal, where Smythe bet the $2,500 on a football game between Toronto and McGill. He then bet the $5,000 he won on the Rangers to defeat the St. Pats in Toronto, winning again, turning the $2,500 into $10,000 in three days. The Rangers won the Stanley Cup in 1928, their second year of existence, largely with the players Smythe had brought to the team.|$|E
25|$|Initial {{development}} of the game began with creating the first Hero character, Tracer, who {{was based on a}} character from Titan with similar time-manipulation abilities. They used Tracer and a single map based on the Temple of Anubis, to test how well the core mechanics played, according to assistant game director Aaron Keller. They added three more HeroesWidowmaker, Reaper, and Pharah, all whom had been developed from Crossroads classesto start polishing the gameplay mechanics, which even at this stage Keller stated that it compared very closely with what the released game would present. They had even considered releasing Overwatch with a limited set of heroes at this point, as they <b>had</b> <b>felt</b> <b>the</b> game already had a finished feel to it.|$|E

25|$|In {{the wake}} of the battle the Australians were left to {{speculate}} on the reason it occurred. One hypothesis was that the Viet Cong had intended to attack and overwhelm Nui Dat, with the initial plan to mortar the base to draw a response force into an ambush after which the base would be attacked and captured, but that they had been prevented from doing so after clashing with D Company. A second possibility was that they may have had the more limited aim of drawing D Company into an ambush to destroy it and secure a small victory over an isolated force. Finally, it was possible no ambush was planned at all, and that the Viet Cong had been moving on Nui Dat in regimental strength when they unexpectedly ran into D Company, resulting in an encounter battle. The evidence suggested they intended an attack on Nui Dat in some form, while the lack of prepared positions from which to mount an ambush made this unlikely. Brigadier David Jackson—Commander 1 ATF—believed the Viet Cong had been on their way to attack Nui Dat on the night of 18/19 August when D Company intercepted them and this was supported by information from a prisoner captured afterwards. They were carrying large quantities of ammunition and may have had sufficient strength to seriously damage the base, even if its defences were likely strong enough to withstand such an attack. Yet, from the earliest Jackson <b>had</b> <b>felt</b> <b>the</b> Viet Cong would have to engage 1 ATF in a major battle if they wished to retain control of Phuoc Tuy, and this interpretation fitted his previous thinking. In dispatching patrols east of Nui Dat following the mortar attack on 16/17 August Jackson seemingly reacted to his opponent's first move, and he may have allowed himself to be shaped into responding as the Viet Cong had intended.|$|E
25|$|From the 1880s onwards {{there had}} been no central body to {{co-ordinate}} the Inter-Colonial Tournaments and matches, select composite West Indian XIs for tours and against touring sides and to organise the West Indian tours of England, Canada and the United States. Such organisation as there was, was done by an informal coalition of the major clubs in the region. West Indian cricketers however <b>had</b> <b>felt</b> <b>the</b> need for the establishment of such an organisation although geography and culture were to make such a task difficult. However, with the help of one influential Marylebone Cricket Club member, R. H. Mallet (the manager of the 1906 and 1923 West Indian tours and future manager of the 1930–31 West Indian tour to Australia), representatives of the various territories finally got together and ultimately formed the West Indies Cricket Board of Control. The preliminary meeting was in Bridgetown, Barbados, from which the informal West Indies Cricket Conference was founded in 1926. The West Indies Cricket Conference held its first official meeting on 22 January 1927 at the Bridgetown Club in Barbados attended by Mallett and representatives from the Windward Islands, Trinidad & Tobago, Barbados and Demerara (British Guiana). Delegates from Jamaica and the Leeward Islands were invited by unfortunately were unable to attend. At this January meeting the delegates present decided to form the West Indies Cricket Board of Control (WICBC) which would be composed of a president, a secretary and two delegates each from Barbados, Demerara, Jamaica and Trinidad & Tobago and one delegate each from the Leeward Islands and Windward Islands. The WICBC's first meeting was held on 17 and 18 June 1927 in Port-of-Spain, Trinidad with Harold Austin (the former captain of the 1906 and 1923 West Indian tours of England) serving as the first president. The Board as constituted was enlarged in 1982 when the Leeward and Windward Islands were given the same representation as the other full Members. The President was appointed by the Board at an Ordinary General Meeting and had to be a person resident in the West Indies who had shown a keen and active interest in West Indies cricket. His term of office was for two years (and eligible for re-election) or until his successor was appointed. Board members were also thenceforce to be appointed by their Cricket Associations although in British Guiana the Georgetown Cricket Club held this responsibility until 1943, and in Trinidad the Queens Park Oval Club until 1981 when their respective Cricket Associations were given recognition. There was a provision for Associate Members who would be entitled to attend Meetings but not to move resolutions or vote. Bermuda and Belize had been the only members in this category prior to their cessation as Associate Members. According to Ram Hiralal, former President of the Suriname Cricket Association, up until 2002 when Suriname applied for and gained affiliate membership of the ICC, it was also an associate member of the West Indies Cricket Board.|$|E

500|$|The author recounted how he {{initially}} <b>had</b> <b>felt</b> <b>the</b> 2016 Donald Trump presidential campaign would be looked back on in retrospect as a brief humorous period of hysteria {{on the part}} of the American populace.

500|$|According to author Peter Doggett, McCartney <b>had</b> <b>felt</b> <b>the</b> need to {{accommodate}} his bandmates when accepting Spector's version of Let It Be; but, following his {{announcement of the}} Beatles' break-up in a written press release accompanying promotional copies of his solo album, McCartney, on 9 April, he repeatedly listened again to [...] "The Long and Winding Road" [...] and came to resent Spector's additions. On 14 April, with manufacturing underway for Let It Be, he sent a terse letter to Klein, demanding that the harp {{be removed from the}} song and that the other added instrumentation and voices be reduced. McCartney concluded the letter with the words: [...] "Don't ever do it again." [...] Klein attempted to phone McCartney but he had changed his number without informing Apple; Klein then sent a telegram asking McCartney to contact him or Spector about his concerns. According to Klein, [...] "The following day, a message was relayed to me [...] that the letter spoke for itself." [...] With Let It Be scheduled for release in advance of the similarly titled documentary film, Klein allowed the production process to continue with Spector's version of [...] "The Long and Winding Road" [...] intact.|$|E
500|$|Marjorie Baumgarten of Austin Chronicle {{referred}} to the film as being [...] "neither a true concert film nor a strict behind-the-scenes documentary, This Is It is, like Jackson himself, a real hybrid" [...] and felt that while the film's [...] "made up of lots of grainy footage, which Ortega has edited together seamlessly" [...] it will also [...] "provide a fitting farewell." [...] Baumgarten noted that [...] "the finished film is a fairly complete concert run-through with each song edited" [...] and that while the film will easily show that it was made for a profit, that, the audience will see a [...] "film to be a fitting elegy." [...] Joe Morgenstern, of The Wall Street Journal, felt the film was [...] "expertly packaged—brilliantly packaged," [...] and noted that the film [...] "quite convincingly" [...] had emphasized that Jackson had enough energy to perform, even with his [...] "wraith-thin body". Ann Powers, of Los Angeles Times {{said that while the}} film offers only a few such [...] "insights into Jackson's artistic process, though enough surface to make this a useful document, as well as a beautiful one" [...] that the film is [...] "a piece with Jackson's body of work: dazzling and strange, blurring the line between fantasy and reality." [...] She described Ortega's editing to make the film feel like a real concert film as being [...] "almost too good to believe." [...] Powers praised the film for showing [...] "intimate views" [...] of Jackson, like his [...] "vulnerable moments" [...] during performances and felt the film was made [...] "to honor not just the memory of Jackson but the hard work of a big cast and crew that never made it to opening night," [...] which she felt mostly is a tribute to the [...] "power of Jackson's body and voice." [...] Powers stated she <b>had</b> <b>felt</b> <b>the</b> film was such [...] "a tragic teaser for the shows that might have been, 'This Is It' hurts. If Jackson had been able to perform as he frequently does during these scenes, he would have accomplished the comeback for which he was so hungry." [...] She noted that Jackson's [...] "total lack of engagement with the cameras adds to the unreal mood" [...] because he was always performing — [...] "but for the imagined masses, not for the filmgoer" [...] and that the film does not [...] "entirely acknowledge that reality, and that's a little odd." ...|$|E

2500|$|A {{pioneering}} {{experiment in}} this field was conducted by Benjamin Libet in the 1980s, in which he asked each subject to choose a random moment to flick their wrist while he measured the associated activity in their brain (in particular, the build-up of electrical signal called the Bereitschaftspotential (BP), which was discovered by Kornhuber & Deecke in 1965). Although it was well known that the Bereitschaftspotential (sometimes also termed [...] "readiness potential") preceded the physical action, Libet asked how the Bereitschaftspotential corresponded to the felt intention to move. To determine when the subjects felt the intention to move, he asked them to watch the second hand of a clock and report its position when they felt that they <b>had</b> <b>felt</b> <b>the</b> conscious will to move.|$|E
2500|$|With {{the press}} noting {{parallels}} between the current series and England's win at the Oval in 1926, the deciding Test began amid great interest from the public. Hutton lost his fifth successive toss in the series but England had their most balanced attack of the series with the recall of Trueman, whom Hutton used in short bursts to take four wickets in Australia's first innings of 275. Surviving an early scare when a bouncer from Lindwall nearly knocked his cap onto his wickets, Hutton scored 82, but England only managed a narrow first innings lead. In their reply, Australia collapsed before the England spinners, for which Wisden gave the credit to Hutton, both for realising that the pitch favoured spin and barely using his pace bowlers, and for some of his tactical decisions in the innings. Although Hutton was run out early in England's pursuit of 132 to win the Ashes, the remaining batsmen took England to their first series win against Australia since 193233 and their first home series win since 1926. Hutton was widely acclaimed after the series, particularly for the good spirit which he and Hassett maintained. Norman Preston wrote in Wisden, [...] "To my mind not sufficient credit was given to Hutton last summer {{for his part in}} lifting England out of the long period of depression ... led his men conscientiously against Australia and, in addition, he shouldered the main responsibility of the batting. He scored nearly 100 runs more than any other player on either side ... His 145 [...] was easily the finest innings of the whole series. Moreover, Hutton then showed the enterprise we expected..." [...] In the series, he scored 443 runs at an average of 55.37. Hutton ended the summer with another century against the Australians at the Scarborough Festival. However, he <b>had</b> <b>felt</b> <b>the</b> strain of leading England that summer, with some at Yorkshire feeling that he relaxed too much to improve discipline at the county, despite his batting successes.|$|E
