50|$|In 1979, Malaysia {{produced}} almost 63,000 tons of tin, {{accounting for}} 31% of world's output. Tin deposit spreads across western Peninsular Malaysia, particularly the Kinta Valley in Perak. In 1883, Malaysia {{was the largest}} tin producer in the world.

The first trunk road in Peninsular Malaysia was constructed passing through major mining towns in Perak, Selangor and Negeri Sembilan {{in which it was}} mostly used to transport tin from mines to ports. In the 1920s, dredging machines were introduced to boost the production of tin.

40|$|AlliedSignal's Hopewell plant {{produces}} caprolactam, the {{raw material}} for Nylon- 6. Hopewell supplies caprolactam to many <b>downstream</b> <b>businesses.</b> However, {{over the past five}} years, the plant {{has not been able to}} meet the demands of these internal customers. Caprolactam shortfalls have caused yearly business plans to go unmet, negatively impacting profitability by millions of dollars. More realistic business plans have not been developed in part because the production capacity and variability of Hopewell are not well understood. The demands on Hopewell will only increase over time as the Polymers division pursues aggressive growth targets. However, significant increases in caprolactam production will require excessive amounts of capital, most likely beyond what will be made available to the plant. Hopewell thus needs to allocate its resources wisely so that it can reliably support the demands of the AlliedSignal nylon system.
