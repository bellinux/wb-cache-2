40|$|With the {{progress}} of semiconductor fabrication processes, the device size is getting smaller and circuit layout becomes more complicated. Nevertheless, the current channel of MOSFET is shortened with the shrinking of device size, which {{will lead to the}} problem of so-called short channel effect (SCE). In order to suppress the SCE, the ultra-shallow junction (USJ) structure of semiconductor device is introduced and the low energy ion implantation {{is an important factor in}} this technique. In this study, the ion implanter was applied to fabricate USJ using Boron ion in n-type (100) Si substrate. The implantation doseage and annealing temperature are 6 × 1015 ions/cm 2 and 950 C, respectively. The drift, process chamber <b>decel</b> and double <b>decel</b> modes of ion implanter controlled conditions were optimized for USJ fabrication. The different <b>decel</b> ratios (1. 5 %, 2 % and 3 %) and implant energies (2. 5 keV, 3 keV and 3. 5 keV) were used to investigate the implant concentration, thermal wave and sheet resistance. The uniformity of sheet resistance is 0. 87 % with the <b>decel</b> ration of 1. 57 %. The thermal wave unit is 1350 TWU with 3. 5 keV implant energy. Finally, the measurement of secondary ion mass spectroscopy was adopted to confirm the implant depth. 隨著半導體製程技術的演進，積體電路的電路佈局也愈來愈複雜，元件尺寸也越來越小；當閘極長度也因此變短時，元件電流通道也會跟著被縮短，但是通道的尺寸是不可能無限制地縮小下去的，否則隨之而來的短通道效應(short channel effect, SCE) 問題將更嚴重。為了改善短通道效應的現象，超淺型接面(ultra-shallow junction, USJ) 之低能量佈植技術將變得相當重要。 本論文以離子植入機作為實驗設備，植入氣體為硼離子，佈植於n 型的(001) 矽基材上，離子植入劑量為 6. 00 × 1015 ions/cm 2 ，植入後使用回火溫度為 950 ℃持溫 10 秒；使用三種離子植入機台的製程條件控制模式，分別為能量模式漂移(drift) 模式、製程腔體減速(process chamber <b>decel,</b> PCD) 模式及雙重減速(double <b>decel,</b> DD) 模式；並使用不同減速定量值(1. 5 %, 2 %, 3 %) ，以及不同能量差異(2. 5 keV, 3 keV, 3. 5 keV) ，觀察植入後基板的片電阻、熱波形、離子植入濃度以及均勻度等特性；當減速定量值為 1. 57 %時，片電阻均勻度為 0. 87 %；離子能量為 3. 5 keV時，熱波形量測結果為 1350 TWU；最後使用二次離子質譜儀(secondary ion mass spectroscopy, SIMS) 驗證離子植入之深度。致謝															i 摘要															ii 英文摘要														iii 目錄															iv 圖目錄															vii 表目錄															x 第一章 前言													 1 1. 1 研究背景 												 1 1. 2 研究動機 												 2 1. 3 論文結構 												 2 第二章 文獻回顧 												 3 2. 1 元件尺寸微縮所造成的影響 								 3 2. 2 影響離子植入深度的因素									 4 	 2. 2. 1 投影離子射程										 5 	 2. 2. 2 通道效應											 6 2. 3 低能量離子佈植的發展演進	 8 2. 4 相關文獻比較												 10 第三章 實驗方法與設備之介紹									 13 3. 1 實驗試片和步驟流程				 13 		 3. 1. 1 能量產生模式流程圖							 13 		 3. 1. 2 減速定量值流程圖								 14 		 3. 1. 3 能量差流程圖									 15 	 3. 2 離子佈植系統											 16 	 3. 3 離子源生產機制										 17 	 3. 4 萃取電極 												 19 	 3. 5 質量分析器											 21 3. 6 電子中和系統 											 25 	 3. 7 離子電流量測系統 									 26 	 3. 8 真空系統												 27 3. 9 四點探針量測系統										 31 	 3. 10 二次離子質譜儀 										 31 3. 11 能量產生模式											 34 	 3. 12 熱波形系統量測原理									 36 第四章 結果與討論 											 39 4. 1 能量產生模式差異對於片電阻之影響					 39 4. 2 減速定量值對於片電阻之影響							 42 4. 3 能量差異對於片電阻變化之比較結果					 46 4. 4 能量差異對於熱波形變化之比較結果					 49 4. 5 能量差異對於SIMS 緃深分佈之比較					 51 第五章 結論													 54 參考文獻														 5...|$|E

40|$|In recent {{experiments}} in the inlet of an UHBR Fan Rig {{for the very first}} time an array of wall-flush mounted sensors was applied to carry out a complete acoustic radial mode decomposition at high frequencies. In this case, Radial Mode Analysis (RMA) is in particular challenging due to the – compared to ducts of larger hub-to-tip ratios – large radial mode content. In this paper it will be shown that with the help of a regularization technique RMA results of high accuracy can be achieved with a minimized number of measurement positions. Further, the acquired test data will be used to verify that a partial RMA is feasible, which delivers the amplitudes of the dominant radial modes using the input of only a few seconds sound pressure measurements at a small number of sensor positions. In that way, i. e. the partial RMA enables an online-monitoring of the rotor-stator interaction modes. An application of the partial RMA technique is of high interest to monitor the active control of individual radial modes and respectively the assessment of the tonal sound power e. g. during fan rig accels or <b>decels.</b> I...|$|R
40|$|Daily {{nutrition}} varies considerably among individuals. Today, {{there are}} two main groups, in Germany, with little or no animal products in their diets. One aspect that can be observed is the continuously growing number of vegetarians that are motivated by ethical, environmental, religious or other reasons. At the same time, there is still concern about their nutritional status regarding micronutrient deficiencies. Apart from that, however, infants up to six month generally live on breastmilk alone. Among the essential trace elements, selenium (Se) is of prime importance as {{it is part of the}} active site in selenoproteins. European soil and plants are relatively poor sources of Se, while farm animals are generally supplemented with Se in order to improve their health and avoid deficiency syndromes. We, therefore, wondered whether German vegetarians display a measurable Se deficiency and how the Se-status of human milk looks like. Accordingly, we compared young vegetarians (n 54) with omnivores (n 53). We assessed their Se status by measuring extracellular glutathione peroxidase (GPX 3) activity, and concentrations of total serum Se and circulating Se-transport protein selenoprotein P (SEPP). The groups' GPX 3 activities did not exhibit differences, whereas both the vegetarians' total Se and their SEPP concentrations were reduced to 79, 5 and 71, 2 % when compared to the omnivores'. When splitting the group of vegetarians into vegans (n 26) and vegetarians consuming egg and milk products (n 28), analyses of the Se-dependent biomarkers did not reveal significant differences. We concluded that low serum Se is mirrored by circulating SEPP concentrations, but not by GPX 3 activities in marginally supplied individuals. The specific diet-related Se sources, the divergent metabolic routes of selenomethionine versus selenocysteine and the different saturation kinetics of GPX 3 and SEPP emphasize our contradictory findings. Whether German vegetarians and vegans need to be considered a Se-deficient group depends on the biomarker chosen. Furthermore, we were able to show for the first time that SePP is expressed in human milk. Breastmilk was analysed in three different fractions: Whole milk, <b>decelled</b> milk and skimmed milk. For all fractions, conditions could be defined and reproducible results for GPX 3 and SEPP are now made possible and optimised. In contrast to the serum, SePP seems to be a lot more fragile and unstable in breast milk. Further studies will be necessary to examine whether this has physiological reasons and is therefore helpful for the infant’s digestive utilisation or not...|$|R

Results obtained when the sheath shape and position are established and then held constant as operating conditions are changed are compared to corresponding results obtained with a conventional plasma sheath that moves. These comparisons show the shaped surface: 1) yields beamlets that remain focused over wider beamlet current ranges, 2) enables operation without a crossover limit, and 3) enables operation at lower net-to-total accelerating voltage ratios and, therefore, at lower specific impulses. It is also shown that even greater beamlet currents can be extracted before the perveance limit is encountered if the propellant utilization efficiency approaches 100 % {{and it is no}} longer necessary to have a small accel hole diameter to limit neutral propellant loss. Such a propellant utilization efficiency is expected for the Emissive Membrane Ion Thruster because its membrane is able to pass only ionized propellant. d = diameter (ds – screen, da – accel, dd- <b>decel)</b> E = electric field strength J = current (Jb – beamlet, Ji – impingement) r = radius (rs – screen, ra – accel) lg = grid spacing u = Bezier function independent variable V = voltage (Va – accel, Vd – <b>decel,</b> VN – net, VT – total) z = axial position I...|$|E

The measurements {{have been made}} as a function of thrust ion current, propellant utilization efficiency, bombardment discharge voltage, screen and accelerator grid potential (accel-decel ratio) and neutralizer keeper potential. The shape of the Group IV (charge exchange) ion plume has remained essentially fixed within the range of variation of the engine operation parameters. The magnitude of the charge exchange ion flux scales with thrust ion current, for good propellant utilization conditions. For fixed thrust ion current, charge exchange ion flux increases for diminishing propellant utilization efficiency. Facility effects influence experimental accuracies within the range of propellant utilization efficiency used in the experiments.

Since only two of four recording tracks are used, the others are available for other in put. The replayed data appear in a format iden tical to the gamma camera signal; hence, any data manipulation performable on the original signal {{can be carried out}} on the replay. The system has advantages over other gamma cam era recording systems: matrix artifact is elimi nated; replay time may be accelerated or <b>decel</b> erated depending upon study objectives; when data are digitized for computer manipulation, data losses caused by deadtime are limited to those intrinsic to the gamma camera itself. An ideal data storage system for the Anger camera would reproduce an image indistinguishable from the original in spatial resolution, data density, and data format. The formidable difficulties facing the designer of such a system are related primarily to the random nature and short duration of the events to be recorded. Most available systems rely upon conversion of the camera position signals to digital binary numbers after which the data are stored directly on tape or events are accumulated in a memory matrix for a period before the entire â€œframeâ€ is recorded on tape.

This paper {{presents}} SIRENA, a CAD {{environment for}} the simulation and modelling of mixed-signal VLSI parallel processing chips based on cellular neural networks. SIRENA includes capabilities for: (a) the description of nominal and non-ideal operation of CNN analogue circuitry at the behavioural level; (b) performing realistic simulations of the transient evolution of physical CNNs including deviations due to second-order effects of the hardware; and, (c) evaluating sensitivity figures, and realize noise and Monte Carlo simulations in the time domain. These capabilities portray SIRENA as better suited for CNN chip development than algorithmic simulation packages (such as OpenSimulator, Sesame) or conventional neural networks simulators (RCS, GENESIS, SFINX), which are not oriented to the evaluation of hardware non-idealities. As compared to conventional electrical simulators (such as HSPICE or ELDO-FAS), SIRENA provides easier modelling of the hardware parasitics, {{a significant reduction in}} computation time, and similar accuracy levels. Consequently, iteration during the design procedure becomes possible, supporting decision making regarding design strategies and dimensioning. SIRENA has been developed using object-oriented programming techniques in C, and currently runs under the UNIX operating system and X-Windows framework. It employs a dedicated high-level hardware description language: <b>DECEL,</b> fitted to the description of non-idealities arising in CNN hardware. This language has been developed aiming generality, in the sense of making no restrictions on the network models that can be implemented. SIRENA is highly modular and composed of independent tools.

40|$|Climatological winds {{over the}} {{equatorial}} Indian Ocean (EqlO) are westerly {{most of the}} year. Twice a year, in April-May ("spring") and October-December ("fall"), strong, sustained westerly winds generate eastward equatorial jets in the ocean. There are several unresolved {{issues related to the}} equatorial jets. They accelerate rapidly to speeds over lms" 1 when westerly wind stress increases to about 0. 7 dyne cm" 2 in spring and fall, but decelerate while the wind stress continues to be westerly; each jet is followed by westward flow in the upper ocean lasting a month or longer. In addition to the semi-annual cycle, the equatorial winds and currents have strong in-traseasonal fluctuations. Observations show strong 30 - 60 day variability of zonal flow, and suggest that there might be variability with periods shorter than 20 days in the central EqlO. Observations from moored current meter arrays along 80. 5 °E south of Sri Lanka showed a distinct 15 day oscillation of equatorial meridional velocity (v) and off-equatorial zonal velocity (u). Recent observations from current meter moorings at the equator in the eastern EqlO show continuous 10 - 20 day, or biweekly, oscillations of v. The main motivation for the present study is to understand the dynamics of intraseasonal variability in the Indian Ocean that has been documented in the observational literature. What physical processes are responsible for the peculiar behavior of the equatorial jets? What are the relative roles of wind stress and large scale ocean dynamics? Does intraseasonal variability of wind stress force intraseasonal jets? What is the structure and origin of the biweekly variability? The intraseasonal and longer timescale variability of the equatorial Indian Ocean circulation is studied using an ocean general circulation model (OGCM) and recent in Abstract	ii situ observations. The OGCM simulations are validated against other available observations. In this thesis, we document the space-time structure of the variability of equatorial Indian Ocean circulation, and attempt to find answers to some of the questions raised above. The main results are based on OGCM simulations forced by high frequency reanalysis and satellite scatterometer (QuikSCAT) winds. Several model experiments with idealized winds are used to interpret the results of the simulations. In addition to the OGCM simulations, the origin of observed intraseasonal anomalies of sea surface temperature (SST) in the eastern EqlO and Bay of Bengal, and related air-sea interaction, are investigated using validated satellite data. The main findings of the thesis can be summarized as: •	High frequency accurate winds are required for accurate simulation of equatorial Indian Ocean currents, which have strong variability on intraseasonal to interannual time scales. •	The variability in the equatorial waveguide is mainly driven by variability of the winds; there is some intraseasonal variability near the western boundary and in the equatorial waveguide due to dynamic instability of seasonal "mean" flows. •	The fall equatorial jet is generally stronger and longer lived than the spring jet; the fall jet is modulated on intraseasonal time scales. Westerly wind bursts can drive strong intraseasonal equatorial jets in the eastern EqlO during the summer monsoon. •	Eastward equatorial jets create a westward zonal pressure gradient force by raising sea level, and deepening the thermocline, in the east relative to the west. The zonal pressure force relaxes via Rossby wave radiation from the eastern boundary. •	The zonal pressure force exerts strong control on the evolution of zonal flow; the <b>decel</b> eration of the eastward jets, and the subsequent westward flow in the upper ocean in the presence of westerly wind stress, is due to the zonal pressure force. •	Neither westward currents in the upper ocean nor subsurface eastward flow (the ob served spring and summer "undercurrent") requires easterly winds; they can be gener ated by equatorial adjustment due to Kelvin (Rossby) waves generated at the western (eastern) boundary. •	The biweekly variability in the EqlO is associated with forced mixed Rossby-gravity (MRG) waves generated by intraseasonal variability of winds. The biweekly MRG wave in has westward and upward phase propagation, zonal wavelength of 3000 - 4500 km and phase speed of 4 m s" 1; it is associated with deep off equatorial upwelling/downwelling. Intraseasonal SST anomalies are forced mainly by net heat flux anomalies in the central and eastern EqlO; the large northward propagating SST anomalies in summer in the Bay of Bengal are due to net heat flux anomalies associated with the monsoon active-break cycle. Coherent variability in the atmosphere and ocean suggests air-sea interaction...|$|E
