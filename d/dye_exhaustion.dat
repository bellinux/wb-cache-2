40|$|Freshwater is an {{increasingly}} scare resource that is extensively used in textile wet-processing. In seeking to identify alternative low freshwater usage coloration technology {{this study examined}} the potential use of seawater (SEAW) as the dyeing medium for wool coloration using a range of reactive dyes. Initially the dyeing behaviour of the wool fabric in simulated seawater (SSW) was compared against conventional dyeing from distilled water (W) using alpha-bromoacrylamide-based Lanasol dyes and sulphatoethylsulphone-based Remazol dyes. These preliminary studies demonstrated that comparable coloration performance could be acheived in the SSW medium based on the assessment of the <b>dye</b> <b>exhaustion,</b> dye fixation, colour yiel and levelness. Subsequent 'real' seawater dyeing studies of wool, using Mauritian seawater, with the lanasol and Remazol reactive dyes again confirmed that comparable coloration performance, based on the <b>dye</b> <b>exhaustion,</b> dye fixation, colour yield and levelness, could be achieved, highlighting again the potential for substituting freshwater with much more plentiful seawater as the dyeing medium...|$|E

For this, disperse red 60 (DR 60), disperse blue 56 (DB 56), and disperse yellow 54 (DY 54) were used and dyed on PLA fabrics dependent of dyeing temperature and time.

40|$|In this paper, {{the effects}} of low {{temperature}} plasma (LTP) treatment on the dyeing properties of wool were studied. Wool fibres were treated with oxygen plasma and three types of dyeing systems that are commonly used for wool dyeing, namely: (i) acid dye, (ii) chrome dye and (iii) reactive dye; {{were used in the}} dyeing process. For acid dyeing, the dyeing rate of LTP-treated wool fibre was greatly increased, but the final dyeinq exhaustion equilibrium did not show any significant change. For chrome dyeing, the dyeing rate of LTP-treated wool fibre was increased, but the final <b>dyeing</b> <b>exhaustion</b> equilibrium was increased only to a small extent. In addition, the rate of the afterchroming process was similar to the chrome dyeing process. In the case of reactive dyeing, the dyeing rate of LTP-treated wool fibre was greatly increased and also the final <b>dyeing</b> <b>exhaustion</b> equilibrium was increased significantly. As a result, it may be concluded that the LTP treatment could improve the dyeing behaviour of wool fibre under different dyeing systems. Institute of Textiles and Clothin...|$|R

40|$|To {{understand}} {{the effect of}} alkali pre-treatment on the dyeing of lyocell fabrics, samples are pre-treated with 0. 0 – 7. 0 mol dm− 3 NaOH using a pad-batch process and then dyed with different types of reactive <b>dyes.</b> <b>Exhaustion,</b> fixation, and visual colour strength (K/S values) are measured. It is observed that sodium hydroxide pre-treatment significantly improves the colour yield, exhaustion, and fixation for all dyes used. Highest K/S values are obtained when the fabrics are pre-treated with 2. 0 – 2. 5 mol dm− 3 NaOH. Cross-sectional analysis shows that below this optimum concentration the core fibres in the yarn are not dyed; at optimum concentration all fibres in yarn cross-section are homogeneously dyed. Cross-sectional analysis shows that as the pre-treatment concentration of NaOH increases above 2. 5 mol dm− 3, the fibres change progressively from a circular to angular cross-section, forming a solid unit. The decrease in K/S above the treatment concentration of 2. 5 mol dm− 3, though the %E and %F remains almost constant, is attributed to the distribution of dye over a larger surface area of the outer fibres in the yarn cross section, forcing the K/S at λmax to decrease...|$|R

30|$|Wool fiber {{strength}} and handle is damaged by holding for prolonged periods at normal dyeing temperatures (98  °C). Lower dyeing temperatures {{can be employed}} to color wool whilst reducing damage caused to the fiber. However, these lower temperature dyeing processes often have a long dyeing time and/or require the addition of chemicals to achieve adequate <b>dye</b> <b>exhaustion</b> and migration. The use of ultrasonic irradiation was used to reduce dyeing times and temperatures whilst increasing dye migration and fastness. It has used 30  kHz frequency level, effective power of 120 and 350  W heating power in ultrasonic machine. In this work, wool dyeing was carried out on single jersey knitted fabric using an acid dye with and without ultrasonic irradiation at 60, 70, and 80  °C. <b>Dye</b> <b>exhaustion</b> was measured using UV/visible absorbance of the dye bath {{before and during the}} dyeing cycle. For the measurement of nodal/anti-nodal point of energy, at 60, 70, and 80  °C dyeing was done in open bath of ultrasonic machine with and without sonication at high liquor ratio. To compare the dye uptake (%) at high/conventional process, sample was dyed at 95  °C. Optical and scanning electron microscopy were used to measure the diameter and surface changes of the fiber, respectively. Wash and rub fastness was measured on the dyed fabrics after rinsing and drying. Ultrasonic irradiation during the dyeing of wool caused an increase in the <b>dye</b> <b>exhaustion</b> rate for acid dye. This change in rate {{is believed to have been}} caused by a reduction in the viscous boundary layer of liquor surrounding the fiber present in an ultrasonic irradiated environment. An increased dye migration due to cuticle cracking and fiber swelling was not deemed to have occurred as wet fiber diameter was not changed by submersion in the dye liquor in the presence of ultrasound and no surface cracking was evident in scanning electron microscopy images. Some cuticle structure changes occurred with turning up or ripping off of the cuticle tips evident. Both wash and rub fastness were improved for ultrasonically dyed fiber with dyeing temperatures of 70 and 80  °C being suitable for the low-temperature dyeing of wool.|$|E
