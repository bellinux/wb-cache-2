In particular, in a Tullock (short-run) model, those <b>expenditures</b> <b>actually</b> decrease. In the Corcoran (long-run) model, those expenditures decrease and do not totally dissipate the economic rents at stake. With nonidentical players there is a finite upper limit to the total of such expenditures. Consumer; Rent Seeking...|$|R

A special tax deduction is allowed only for <b>expenditure</b> <b>actually</b> incurred, yet the accounting standard provides a different calculative practice for the representation of the same event. With this example we demonstrate inconsistencies that exist between accounting and tax and although the accounting for income taxes standard accounts for the differences, we argue this merely legitimatises them. We challenge this false consciousness that assumes these inconsistencies are merely incidental and point out that these two systems, of tax and accounting, implicitly sustain and reinforce each other. These institutional practices perpetuate the privileges, powers and impact of the mining industry, whilst claiming to serve the community as a whole...|$|R
