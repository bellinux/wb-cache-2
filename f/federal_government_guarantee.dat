40|$|Healthcare is {{a crucial}} aspect of our quality of life. However, {{healthcare}} costs have increased significantly {{in the past few}} years, and many Americans cannot afford adequate healthcare insurance. Is our healthcare system in crisis? Should all Californians be required to have health insurance? Should the <b>federal</b> <b>government</b> <b>guarantee</b> healthcare for all citizens, even if it means raising taxes? According to the 2007 Sacramento State Annual Survey of the Region, an overwhelming majority of area residents (81 %) are deeply concerned about the state of healthcare in the United States. Nearly 30 percent (28 %) think the American healthcare system is in crisis, and over half (53 %) believe it has major problems. In sharp contrast, only two percent say it does not have any problems, and 15 percent claim it has minor issues. Therefore, {{it is not surprising that}} a majority of area residents (58 %) support the proposal made by President Bush to improve healthcare coverage in the United States. Sixty percent (60 %) favor Governor Schwarzenegger’s healthcare plan to require all Californians to have health insurance. Endorsement is also strong (59 %) for the U.

40|$|The CWB has {{the stated}} {{objective}} of increasing producer returns through maximizing sales revenue and minimizing operating costs. To maximize producer returns the CWB derives value from single-desk selling, price pooling {{and the initial}} price guarantee. The initial price allows the CWB to offer a price floor to producers which is guaranteed by the Federal government. This guarantee has come under review in recent World Trade Organization (WTO) negotiations with opponents stating that the Federal government is unfairly subsidizing producers. Therefore developing methods to hedge the initial payment and remove the CWB dependency on the <b>Federal</b> <b>government</b> <b>guarantee</b> has taken on considerable importance. Hedging the initial price has two components, the first is commodity risk, {{and the second is}} currency risk. Commodity risk basically consists of the risk that wheat prices decrease significantly from the announcement of the initial payment resulting in a wheat pool account deficit. Currency risk relates to the risk of the Canadian dollar (CAD) increasing vis-à-vis the United States dollar (USD) resulting in lower wheat prices. This {{is due to the fact}} most sales are made in USD, necessitating the conversion of USD for CAD in order to pay Canadian producers. Given recent increases in exchange rate volatility this later risk is important. The goal of this study is to evaluate the currency risk present in the initial payment and to examine alternate means of mitigating this risk. A number of call option strategies will be evaluated to determine its ability to reduce the probability of a wheat pool account deficit by offsetting the effect of a rising CAD. The policy variables analyzed in the thesis are the initial payment as a percentage of the Pool Return Outlook for wheat and the strike price of the call options purchased. Therefore the study will examine the effect of inputting varying initial payment levels and different strike prices for the call options in the model. This will allow for quantifiable insight into cost versus risk reduction comparisons. These comparisons will be useful in determining the most efficient mode of action for the CWB...|$|E

40|$|Loan {{guarantees}} {{are used}} by the <b>federal</b> <b>government</b> to promote key areas of industry and encourage commercial development.

50|$|By far {{the largest}} {{government}} health program is Medicare, which is actually ten provincial programs, such as OHIP in Ontario, that are required to meet the general guidelines {{laid out in the}} federal Canada Health Act. Almost all government health spending goes through Medicare, but there are several smaller programs. The <b>federal</b> <b>government</b> directly administers health to groups such as the military, and inmates of federal prisons. They also provide some care to the Royal Canadian Mounted Police and veterans, but these groups mostly use the public system. Prior to 1966, Veterans Affairs Canada had a large healthcare network, but this was merged into the general system with the creation of Medicare. The largest group the <b>federal</b> <b>government</b> is directly responsible for is First Nations. Native peoples are a federal responsibility and the <b>federal</b> <b>government</b> <b>guarantees</b> complete coverage of their health needs. For the last twenty years and despite health care being a guaranteed right for First Nations due to the many treaties the government of Canada signed for access to First Nations lands and resources, the amount of coverage provided by the <b>Federal</b> <b>government's</b> Non-Insured Health Benefits program has diminished drastically for optometry, dentistry, and medicines. Status First Nations individuals qualify for a set amount of visits to the optometrist and dentist, with a limited amount of coverage for glasses, eye exams, fillings, root canals, etc. For the most part First Nations people use the normal hospitals and the <b>federal</b> <b>government</b> then fully compensates the provincial government for the expense. The <b>federal</b> <b>government</b> also covers any user fees the province charges. The <b>federal</b> <b>government</b> maintains a network of clinics and health centres on Native Reserves. At the provincial level, there are also several much smaller health programs alongside Medicare. The largest of these is the health care costs paid by the worker's compensation system. Regardless of federal efforts, healthcare for First Nations has generally not been considered effective.|$|R
40|$|A {{letter report}} {{issued by the}} General Accounting Office with an {{abstract}} that begins "The Department of Education runs two major federal student loan programs, the William D.

Under FDLP, students or their parents borrow money directly from the <b>federal</b> <b>government</b> through the schools the students attend. Under FFELP, money is borrowed from private lenders, and the <b>federal</b> <b>government</b> <b>guarantees</b> repayment if the borrowers default.

GAO found that developing a reasonable estimate of subsidy cost for loan programs is complex. Many assumptions {{must be taken into account}} and projections must be made for the life of the loans. Because FDLP's subsidy costs are determined largely by interest rates and interest rate fluctuations cannot be predicted with any certainty, it is unclear whether the current trend in negative subsidy costs for FDLP will continue. In addition, other factors, such as origination fees paid by borrowers, defaults, subsequent collections on defaulted loans and timing of loan repayments, affect the subsidy cost of FDLP. Although Education is able to estimate origination fees close to the actual amounts in the financial system, other key cash flows varied significantly. Also, Education's current model for estimating FDLP subsidy costs does not directly take into account key factors, such as prepayments and consolidations. ...|$|R
40|$|In the {{aftermath}} of the financial crisis, major reforms of the U. S. housing finance system are likely. One of the key issues facing policy makers in this area is whether and to what extent the <b>federal</b> <b>government</b> should maintain its current role in the residential mortgage markets. Since the New Deal, the <b>federal</b> <b>government</b> has <b>guaranteed</b> the primary sources of housing finance in the United States — bank and thrift deposits, and the obligations of the mortgage securitization conduits Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac, and Ginnie Mae. The prevailing view of <b>government</b> <b>guarantees</b> is that they increase financial instability because they encourage excessive risk-taking and reduce market discipline. But this perspective fails to explain why such guarantees have been closely correlated with stability in the housing finance system through our nation’s history. Incorporating historical and economic analyses, this Article challenges the conventional wisdom around <b>government</b> <b>guarantees</b> in U. S. housing finance, and argues that these guarantees actually help to promote stability in several important ways: they prevent banking panics, they limit the formation of credit bubbles, and they promote the origination of consumer-friendly loans that are less likely to default. The Article concludes with the new and counterintuitive proposition that the positive stabilizing effects of U.
