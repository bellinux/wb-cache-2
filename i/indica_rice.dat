25|$|Rice: Iran's total rice {{production}} {{stands at}} 2.2 million {{tons per annum}} whereas annual consumption is about three million tons (2008). Iran has imported about 630,000 tons of rice from UAE, Pakistan and Uruguay worth $271 million in 2008 and 1.4 million tons of rice, worth $800 million in 2009. Iran's rice imports drop by 40% in 2010. Iran’s rice production in 2011 was 2.4 million tons, which increased from a total of 2.3 million tons in the previous year. Iran has 3,800 rice milling units (2009). The average per capita consumption of rice in Iran is 45.5kg, which makes Iranians the 13th biggest rice consumers. Rice is mostly produced in northern Iran.

Six weeks old, scutellum derived calluses ofindica rice viz., ASD 16, White Ponni, Pusa Basmati, Pusa Sugandh 4, Pusa Sugandh 5 were cocultivated with A. tumifaciensstrain EHA 105, harbouring the binary vector pCAMBIA 1305. 1 with the β-glucouronidase (GUS) and hygromycin phosphotransferase genes in the T-DNA region. Addition of Acetosyringone (AS) to the pre induction medium and cocultivation mediuminduced higher levels of transient GUS expression than that obtained {{with the addition of}} AS to either of the stages.

40|$|There are two {{cultivated}} and twenty-one {{wild species}} of genus Oryza. O. sativa, the Asian cultivated rice is grown {{all over the}} world. The African cultivated rice, O. glaberrima is grown {{on a small scale}} in West Africa. The genus Oryza probably originated about 130 million years ago in Gondwanaland and different species got distributed into different continents with the breakup of Gondwanaland. The cultivated species originated from a common ancestor with AA genome. Perennial and annual ancestors of O. sativa are O. rufipogon and O. nivara and those of O. glaberrima are O. longistaminata, O. breviligulata and O. glaberrima probably domesticated in Niger river delta. Varieties of O. sativa are classified into six groups on the basis of genetic affinity. Widely known <b>indica</b> <b>rices</b> correspond to group I and japonicas to group VI. The so called javanica rices also belong to group VI and are designated as tropical japonicas in contrast to temperate japonicas grown in temperate climate. <b>Indica</b> and japonica <b>rices</b> had a polyphyletic origin. Indicas were probably domesticated in the foothills of Himalayas in Eastern India and japonicas somewhere in South China. The <b>indica</b> <b>rices</b> dispersed throughout the tropics and subtropics from India. The japonica rices moved northward from South China and became the temperate ecotype.

40|$|The {{resilience}} of seed quality in rice (Oryza sativa L.) to flooding was investigated. Pot-grown plants of the japonica cv. Gleva, the indica cv. IR 64, and the introgressed line IR 64 -Sub 1 were submerged in water, to simulate flooding, for 3 - 5 days {{at different stages}} of seed development and maturation. Mean seed weight, pre-harvest sprouting, ability to germinate, and subsequent longevity in air-dry storage were assessed. Whereas seed quality in both IR 64 and IR 64 -Sub 1 was resilient to submergence, in Gleva the longer the duration of submergence and the later in development when plants were submerged the greater the pre-harvest sprouting. Thousand seed dry weight was reduced more by submergence in Gleva than IR 64 or IR 64 -Sub 1. At harvest maturity, few pre-harvest sprouted seeds were able to germinate upon rehydration after desiccation to 11 - 12 % moisture content. Seed longevity of the non-sprouted seed fraction in air-dry hermetic storage (40 °C, 15 % moisture content) was not affected greatly by submergence, but longevity of the japonica rice was less than that of the <b>indica</b> <b>rices</b> due to the former’s steeper seed survival curves. Longevity of the two <b>indica</b> <b>rices</b> was predicted well by the seed viability equation and previously-published estimates of viability constants for rice. The greater dormancy of IR 64 and IR 64 -Sub 1, compared to Gleva, enhanced resilience to pre-harvest sprouting and reduced thousand seed dry weight from plant submergence. There was little or no effect of plant submergence on subsequent air-dry storage longevity of non-sprouted seeds in any genotype...|$|R

40|$|Indica and japonica are {{two main}} {{subspecies}} of Asian cultivated rice (Oryza sativa L.) that differ clearly in morphological and agronomic traits, in physiological and biochemical characteristics and in their genomic structure. However, the proteins and genes responsible for these differences remain poorly characterized. In this study, proteomic tools, including two-dimensional electrophoresis and mass spectrometry, were used to globally identify proteins that differed between two sequenced rice varieties (93 - 11 and Nipponbare). In all, 47 proteins that differed significantly between 93 - 11 and Nipponbare were identified using mass spectrometry and database searches. Interestingly, seven proteins were expressed only in Nipponbare and one protein was expressed specifically in 93 - 11; these differences were confirmed by quantitative real-time PCR and proteomic analysis of other <b>indica</b> and japonica <b>rice</b> varieties.

During the last few years, we have collected over 20, 000 putative full-length cDNAs and over 40, 000 ESTs isolated from various cDNA libraries of two indica varieties Guangluai 4 and Minghui 63. A database of the <b>rice</b> <b>indica</b> cDNAs was therefore built to provide a comprehensive web data source for searching and retrieving the indica cDNA clones. Results <b>Rice</b> <b>Indica</b> cDNA Database (RICD) is an online MySQL-PHP driven database with a user-friendly web interface. It allows investigators to query the cDNA clones by keyword, genome position, nucleotide or protein sequence, and putative function.
