50|$|<b>Flexible,</b> <b>flat</b> <b>cables</b> {{are used}} in place of round cables for easy cable management, {{especially}} in high-flex applications. They usually take up less space than round cables, often offering better EMI/RFI suppression and eliminating wire-coupling issues. In addition, because the wires are protected individually and not wrapped many times over by different materials as round cables are, they are lighter in weight and offer greater flexibility.|$|R

50|$|ZIF wire-to-board {{connectors}} {{are used}} for attaching wires to printed circuit boards inside electronic equipment. An example would be the cable between the LCD screen and motherboard in laptops. The wires, often formed into a ribbon cable, are pre-stripped and the bare ends placed inside the connector. The two sliding parts of the connector are then pushed together, causing it to grip the wires. The most important advantage of this system {{is that it does}} not require a mating half to be fitted to the wire ends, therefore saving space and cost inside miniaturised equipment.

In this study, we use neural stimulation systems to wirelessly navigate cockroaches to follow lines to enable terrestrial insect biobots.

40|$|Abstract — A {{class of}} implantable, regeneration-type neural {{interfaces}} (NI’s) for mammalian peripheral nerve recording and stimulation were developed using different fabrication processes and integrating purposely designed components. A typical NI comprises three main components: 1) a microfabricated silicon die incorporating a microelectrode array on multiple throughholes, 2) a polymer guidance channel housing the die, and 3) a <b>flexible</b> <b>flat</b> <b>cable</b> connecting the die to an external electronic circuitry. The design and fabrication of the NI’s {{were aimed at}} achieving long term, reliable implants by taking into careful account the biological, electrical, and mechanical requirements of the specific implant site. Different versions of the NI were fabricated and implanted between the severed ends of the sciatic nerve in a mammalian animal model (rabbit). Morphological and histological evidence showed that nerves regenerated through the NI’s and electrophysiological results demonstrated the recovery of electrical functionality. Moreover, the NI’s allowed stimulation of the regenerated nerve producing a visible leg/foot contraction. The NI’s {{presented in this paper}} are being further improved in the authors ’ laboratories with the ultimate goal of allowing the control of nerve motor and sensory functions in future prosthetic devices.

40|$|Current cabling {{systems in}} cars {{are about to}} be, {{completely}} or partially, replaced by a <b>cabling</b> technology called <b>flexible</b> <b>flat</b> <b>cables,</b> FFCs. This new technology requires tools that can assist engineers in the design process of the cable layouts. The aim of this thesis {{is to develop a}} software demonstrator of a concept tool for this purpose. The task is divided into three problem areas. Topology modeling, optimization and visualization. An editor is to be implemented which handles creation and modification of topologies which represents FFC harnesses. The optimization is performed using global and local routing. The global routing handles optimization on topology level, defining net paths in the topology. Local routing handles the exact net placement on each bus cable. Finally, the local routing solutions should be graphically presented to the user. The topology modeling requirement was implemented as a graph layouteditor. Global routing is performed using graph search techniques and local routing is based on VLSI channel routing methods. Visualization is implemented for the local routing solutions using the SVG format. The developed application handles most of the requirements. The editor has support for an XML netlist which is used for specifying connectors and nets used in the topology. Global routing and local routing can be performed on the topology. Prerouting of nets can be performed on both global and local level. Support for assigning specific cables, from a library, to bus cables is possible...|$|R

40|$|The Flex wiring {{technology}} {{is used for}} the substitution of conventional wire harnesses. The big advantage is the potential to safe weight and space in our days products. FFC, <b>flexible</b> <b>flat</b> <b>cable</b> are laminated between a career foil and a lidding foil and are characterised by parallel conductors. FPC, flexible printed circuits have defined conductive patterns, which are isolated with an isolating foil or covering varnish. Typical examples of applications are found in the field of the automotive industry, the computer, telecommunications as well as consumer goods. As these different applications demand different properties concerning the isolation and the conductive material is it important to choose the right material for the discussed application. The mayor problem in the field of Flex wiring is the contact technology. The most chosen technologies are crimping and piercing different welding and soldering technologies as well as conductive adhesives for low current applications. To prepare the FFC or FPC for the contacting process it is necessary to strip the isolation of the FFC or the FPC. For this scraping, gringing, milling or laser technologies are used. The IPA engineers offer a wide spread service range in the field of Flex wiring starting with concepts for the replacement of conventional cables by Flex wiring offering the development of automation systems for handling, assembly and contacting the Flex wiring solutions up to workshops seminars and moderation as well as testing in the IPA laboratory...|$|E
40|$|A fast {{increase}} of applications with flex wiring is expected according to space and weight problems. The limited automation in joining technologies leads {{into a wide}} range of contact features, like tensile strength, conductivity and heat impact. Therefore the development of an automated joining station considering variable input parameters is necessary. The aim of this thesis is a systematic work out of results for an automated high current joining technology for <b>flexible</b> <b>flat</b> <b>cables</b> with the highest possible tensile strength. The analysis has shown that the resistance spot welding reaches the highest capability in high tensile strength and will therefore be implemented in the prototypical joining station. To implement a surface investigation, a comparison of different processes was required. This contact surface investigation is realised between the electrodes of the welding machine by measuring resistance. Based on the results of these pre-tests, a software model for a process calculation was developed. The boundary condition to develop an economic tool demands simple and inexpensive software. This requires a tool with a manual input of only material and geometric properties. Creating a software-model has to be done by the software itself. The welding process is influenced by thermal, mechanical and physical effects. Based on this information a tool has been developed to calculate the optimised process parameters for getting the highest possible tensile strength of the joining. To solve this problem a numerical calculation with several sub models is necessary. This software tool was implemented in a prototypical realisation of a joining station. The conclusion of this technology shows a high correlation with the pre-tests. The developed software tool and the prototypical joining station show a high correlation of pre-tests and calculation. Therefore a joining of contaminated contact surfaces with the high tensile strength is possible...|$|R
