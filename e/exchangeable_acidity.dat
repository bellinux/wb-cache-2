Considering the interaction effects of land uses by soil depths, the highest <b>exchangeable</b> <b>acidity</b> value (2.76  cmol(+) kg− 1) was recorded in the surface layer of the cultivated land and the lowest (1.10 cmol(+) kg− 1) <b>exchangeable</b> <b>acidity</b> was recorded in the subsurface layer of forest land (Table  8).

The dissolution of GPR in the slightly acidic soils was limited by increase in Ca saturation and that of HPR was constrained by limited supply in protons. Generally, the dissolution of GPR was higher than that of HPR for each soil. The kinetics of dissolution of PR in the soils was best described by the power function equation P At B. More efficient use of PR in these soils can be achieved by raising the soil cation exchange capacity, thereby increasing the Ca sink size.

40|$|Summary. In a pot {{experiment}} with maize grown on a copper contaminated acid soil was studied the combined effect of soil acidity neutralization and copper toxicity on yield, copper uptake by organs and cation content in biomass. It was confirmed that maximum production was obtained at a complete neutralization of the <b>exchangeable</b> soil <b>acidity</b> (pH ~ 6. 0) for {{all levels of}} copper pollution. At pH> 6. 0 copper uptake by organs diminished significantly to comparatively constant low values. Soil acidity neutralization decreased the acidity (H +) and increased Ca 2 + ions in maize tissues. This effect was not influenced by the pollution factor. Copper toxicity caused an increase of acidity and basic content (Ca 2 + and K +) in the liquid phase. Cation exchange capacity of the biomass was trace depending on copper pollution. Cation distribution in the biomass depended on neutralization, but not on copper toxicity.

40|$|Increased {{demand for}} forest-derived biomass has {{resulted}} in changes in harvest intensities in Finland. Conventional stem-only harvest (CH) has to some extent been replaced with whole-tree harvest (WTH). The latter involves a greater removal of nutrients from the forest ecosystem, as all the above ground biomass is exported from the site. This has raised concerns that WTH could result in large changes in the nutrient dynamics of a forest stand and could eventually lower its site productivity. Little empirical data exists to support this assumption as {{only a limited number}} of studies have been conducted on the topic. A majority of these discuss the short-term effects, thus the long-term consequences remain unknown. The objective of this study was to compare differences in soil properties after CH and WTH in a fertile Norway spruce (Picea abies (L) Karst.) stand in Southern Finland. The site was clear-felled in August 2000 and spruce seedlings were planted in the following summer. Soil sampling in the form of systematic randomized sampling was carried out in May 2011. Changes in base saturation, cation exchange capacity, elemental pools (total and <b>exchangeable)</b> and <b>acidity</b> were studied in both organic and mineral horizons. The results indicate that WTH lowered effective cation exchange capacity and base saturation particularly in the humus layer. The pools of exchangeable Al and Fe were increased in the humus layer, whereas the amount of exchangeable Ca decreased in both layers. WTH also resulted in lower Ca/Al-ratios across the sampled layers. Treatment did not have a significant effect on pH, total pools of elements or on the C/N-ratio of the soil. The results suggest that although the stand possesses significant pools of nutrients at present, WTH, if continued, could have long-term effects on site productivity...|$|R

Characterization comprised XRD-profiling of the mineral content, determination of the cation exchange capacity and <b>exchangeable</b> cations, <b>acidity,</b> mineral fraction, humidity and swelling volume. The XRD- and mineral fraction data were analysed with principal component analysis and explorative cluster analysis which enabled the identification of three distinct groups: smectite based (n= 19), non-smectite based (n= 5) and organic based detoxifiers (n= 4). In a second experiment, an in vitro zearalenone binding test was conducted using phosphate buffered saline at pH 2. 5, 6. 5 and 8. 0. The zearalenone binding of the smectite based group was related to the physico-chemical properties using a multivariate linear regression model. The binding in the non-smectite based and organic based groups was analysed using a one-way ANOVA. A large variability in binding properties was present, especially in the smectite containing group.

Rhizobial population sizes estimated by the legume species ranged from undetectable numbers to 3. 16 × 104 cells per g of soil depending on the trap host species. Although C. calothyrsus had the highest nodulation rate in the soils used, inoculation tests showed L. leucocephala to be the most promiscuous species while G. sepium had the most effective symbiosis.

It was found that various soil series had different acidity distribution patterns within their profiles. Also, a highly significant linear correlation was observed between exchange <b>acidity</b> and <b>exchangeable</b> aluminum of each soil. Liming acid soils raises pH of the soil extract and improves its fertility status. The rise in pH is due to neutralization of acid groups or acid-producing species present in various forms and on various sites in the soil system. One group of these acid producing species is the exchangeable form of various hydrolyzable cations, especially Al⁺³, H₃O⁺, Mn⁺², also perhaps Fe⁺³, and others.

Without lime application, dry matter increased with increasing P rates but, with lime, dry mattes increased from 0 to 30 [*]kg[*]P[*]ha− 1 but declined from 30 to 100 [*]kg[*]P[*]ha− 1. The highest dry matter yield (13. 8 [*]g[*]pot− 1) was obtained with a combined 2 [*]t[*]ha− 1 of lime with 30 [*]kg[*]P[*]ha− 1 suggesting that lime application at low rates combined with moderate amounts of P would be appropriate in this soil...|$|E
40|$|Abstract Fire {{is common}} in savannas but its effects on soil are poorly understood. We {{analyzed}} long-term effects of fire on surface soil of an open Brazilian savanna (campo sujo) in plots submitted to different fire regimes during 18 years. The five fire regimes were: unburned, quadrennial fires in middle dry season, and biennial fires in early, middle or late dry season. Soil was collected during the wet and the middle dry season of 2008, and analyzed for pH, organic matter, total N, potential <b>acidity,</b> <b>exchangeable</b> cations and available P, S, Mn, Cu, Zn and Fe. We applied multivariate analysis to search for patterns related to fire regimes, and to local climate, fuel, and fire behavior. Spearman {{test was used to}} establish correlations between soil variables and the multivariate analysis gradient structure. Seasonal differences were tested using t-test. We found evidence of long-term fire effects: the unburned plot was segregated mainly by lower soil pH; the quadrennial plot was also segregated by lower soil pH and higher amount of exchangeable cations; the time of burning during the dry season in biennial plots did not significantly affect soil availability of nutrients. Differences in elements amounts due to the season of soil sampling (wet or dry) were higher than due to the effect of fires. Higher availability of nutrients in the soil during the wet season was probably related to higher nutrient inputs via rainfall and higher microbial activity...|$|R
40|$|Forest {{biogeochemistry}} {{is strongly}} {{determined by the}} interaction between the tree community and the topsoil. Functional strategies of tree species are coupled to specific chemical leaf traits, and thus also to litter composition, which affects mineral soil characteristics. The limited understanding on this interaction is mainly based on shorter-term common garden experiments in temperate forest, and needs to be extended to other forest types and climates if we want to understand the universality of this linkage. In particular, for highly diverse tropical forests, our understanding of this interaction remains limited. Using an old experimental plantation within the central Congo basin, we examined the relationship between leaf and litter chemical composition and topsoil properties. Canopy, litter and topsoil characteristics were measured and we determined how the community level leaf and litter chemical composition altered the topsoil carbon, major plant nutrients and <b>exchangeable</b> cation concentration, <b>acidity</b> and pH over the last eight decades. We found that functional composition strongly affected topsoil pH. In turn, topsoil pH strongly determined the soil total carbon and available phosphorus, total nitrogen and exchangeable potassium. Our results indicate that, as observed in temperate common garden experiments, trees alter chemical topsoil properties primarily through soil acidification, differently induced by functional composition of the tree community. The strong link between this communitylevel composition and topsoil characteristics, on a highly representative soil type for the tropics, improves our understanding of tropical forests biogeochemistry...|$|R
40|$|Soils {{with low}} {{activity}} clay {{is one of}} the problem soils in Indonesia. These soils consisted of Ultisols, Oxisols, Alfisols, and some Inceptisols, occupied about 34. 5 % of total Indonesian land, distributed in almost all Indonesian islands, and derived from various parent materials. To evaluate the properties of low activity clay soils, 6 pedons of Oxisols and Inceptisols, derived from clay stone, andesitic rock, ultra mafic rock and lime stone,from South Kalimantan were studied both in the field and in the laboratory. The analyses consisted of texture, organic carbon content, pH (H 2 O and KCl), potential P and K, available P, P retention, <b>exchangeable</b> bases and <b>acidity,</b> cation exchange capacity and mineralogical composition. The results showed that low activity clay dominated by opaque and quartz as primarilyresistant mineral. Clay fraction was dominated by kaolinite, {{and to a lesser extent}} goethite, hematite, and gibbsite were also present. The mineralogical composition of the low activity soils indicated a low natural potential nutrient reserve and an advanced stage of soil weathering. Chemically, the low activity clay soils were acid, low content of bases, low cation exchange capacity, high P retention, and some of them show a high aluminum saturation. A complete fertilizer application is necessary for a sustainable use. Although soil fertility constraints on the low activity clay soils can be corrected by liming and appropriate fertilization, socioeconomic condition of the local farmer is another constraint...|$|R
