At first, the Duke of Opole-Racibórz supported the Hungarians, supporting Bolesław V the Chaste in his attacks over Opawa and Głubczyce. However, in 1255, and for unknown reasons, Władysław changed sides and supported King Ottokar II of Bohemia, and in 1260 the duke personally {{took part in the}} Battle of Kressenbrunn against the Hungarians. This change of alliance soon brought real benefits to Władysław, in the <b>form</b> <b>of</b> <b>regulations</b> in the frontiers between his duchy and the Bohemian Kingdom.

The results show that in choosing the ownership structure, foreign investors, local entrepreneurs, and governments consider the specific, costly-to-market assets that the participants and the country bring to the project. The equilibrium foreign equity share rises with the importance of foreign investor assets and declines with the contribution of local assets towards the amount of surplus generated in the FDI project. Government policy and institutional structure of the host country affect the outcome through the <b>form</b> <b>of</b> <b>regulations</b> that apply to FDI, the environment established for the operation of FDI projects, and the roles created for local entrepreneurs.

40|$|Abstract—Regulatory {{compliance}} management is now {{widely recognized as}} one of the main challenges still to be efficiently dealt with in information systems. In the discipline of business process management in particular, compliance is considered as an important driver of the efficiency, reliability and market value of companies. It consists of ensuring that enterprise systems behave according to some guidance provided in the <b>form</b> <b>of</b> <b>regulations.</b> This paper gives a definition of the research problem of regulatory compliance. We show why we expect a formal policy-based and model-driven approach to provide significant advantages in allowing enterprises to flexibly man-age decision-making related to regulatory compliance. For this purpose, we contribute CoReL, a domain-specific modeling language for representing compliance requirements that has a graphical concrete syntax. Informal semantics of CoReL are introduced and its use is illustrated on an example. CoReL allows to leverage business process compliance modeling and checking, enhancing it with regard to, among other dimensions, user-friendliness, genericity, and traceability...|$|E

Method – The method used in this research is the study of normative juridical approach to legislation and the concept of Islamic economics through literature review. Result – Issuer's business activities related to support for environmentally friendly business activities are part of the implementation of sharia principles despite the provisions of the implementation of Islamic finance through a decision has not been stated. All types of instruments issued by issuers of sharia in Indonesia should be consistent with Islamic economic values, including the commitment to enforcement of environmentally friendly business activities.

It was also estimated that a cumulative amount of 1940 and 892 Â GWh of energy can be saved for 20 and 120 Â kW motors, respectively, in Malaysia relative to BAU over the next 10 years.

There have not been uniform principles of building and exploiting of the mini and micro UAV (Unmanned Aerial Vehicle) in the <b>form</b> <b>of</b> <b>regulations</b> similar to those for manned airplanes. The unmanned vehicles of these classes {{in terms of their}} abilities and attractive price are more frequently exploited using the same air area as manned airplanes performing missions over the inhabited areas. An urgent necessity arises to work out the norms of flight suitability of the mini and micro unmanned aerial vehicles. The work contains the analysis of suitability of the current aviation regulations to determine the requirements for the mini unmanned vehicles. The work concentrates on the phenomenon of determining the symmetrical loads from the maneuvers and the turbulence atmosphere. The result of this analysis is the Limit Maneuver Envelope, Limit Gust Envelope and Limit Combined Envelope for mini UAV. The analyzed flight states allowed selecting the so called design cases which can become a basis for determining the norms of loading of mini unmanned aerial vehicles which can constitute the beginning of the regulations for {{building of the}} unmanned aerial vehicles of this class...|$|E

To test this hypothesis, a survey of people working on the salinity issue in Western Australia was conducted and structural equation modelling was used {{to examine the relationship between}} perceived policy attributes. As expected, fairness had a direct and significant effect on policy preference and also affected farmer resistance and administrative cost. Administrative cost was also positively affected by farmer cost and farmer resistance. Interestingly, other analyses showed there was no direct effect between farmer cost and policy preference or between effectiveness and farmer resistance. Agricultural and Food Policy,...|$|E
40|$|The policy Trilemma (the {{ability to}} {{accomplish}} only two policy objectives out of financial integration, exchange rate stability and monetary autonomy) remains a valid macroeconomic framework. The financial globalization during 1990 s- 2000 s reduced the weighted average of exchange rate stability and monetary autonomy. An unintended consequence of financial globalization {{is the growing}} exposure of developing countries to capital flights, and deleveraging crises. The significant costs associated with these crises added financial stability to the Trilemma policy goals, modifying the Trilemma framework into the policy Quadrilemma. Emerging markets frequently coupled their growing financial integration with sizable hoarding of reserves, as means of self-insuring their growing exposure to financial turbulences. The global financial crisis of 2008 - 9 illustrated both the usefulness and the limitations of hoarding reserves as a selfinsurance mechanism. The massive deleveraging initiated by OECD countries in 2008 may provide the impetus for some emerging markets to impose soft capital controls in the <b>form</b> <b>of</b> <b>regulations</b> that restrain inflows of short terms funds.
