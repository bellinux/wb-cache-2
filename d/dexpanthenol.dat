40|$|AbstractIn the {{development}} of transdermal and topical products {{it is important to}} understand how formulation ingredients interact with the molecular components of the upper layer of the skin, the stratum corneum (SC), and thereby influence its macroscopic barrier properties. The aim here was to investigate the effect of two commonly used excipients, transcutol and <b>dexpanthenol,</b> on the molecular as well as the macroscopic properties of the skin membrane. Polarization transfer solid-state NMR methods were combined with steady-state flux and impedance spectroscopy measurements to investigate how these common excipients influence the molecular components of SC and its barrier function at strictly controlled hydration conditions in vitro with excised porcine skin. The NMR results provide completely new molecular insight into how transcutol and <b>dexpanthenol</b> affect specific molecular segments of both SC lipids and proteins. The presence of transcutol or <b>dexpanthenol</b> in the formulation at fixed water activity results in increased effective skin permeability of the model drug metronidazole. Finally, impedance spectroscopy data show clear changes of the effective skin capacitance after treatment with transcutol or <b>dexpanthenol.</b> Based on the complementary data, we are able to draw direct links between effects on the molecular properties and on the macroscopic barrier function of the skin barrier under treatment with formulations containing transcutol or <b>dexpanthenol...</b>|$|E

We investigated {{the efficacy of}} <b>dexpanthenol</b> in skin protection against irritation in a randomized, prospective, double-blind, placebo-controlled study. 25 healthy volunteers (age 18 - 45 years) were treated for the inner aspect of both forearms with either Bepanthol Handbalsam containing 5 % <b>dexpanthenol</b> or placebo x 2 daily for 26 days. From day 15 - 22, sodium lauryl sulfate (SLS) 2 % was applied to these areas x 2 daily. Documentation comprised sebumetry, corneometry, pH value and clinical appearance (photographs). 21 volunteers completed the study, 3 {{were excluded because of}} non-compliance and 1 experienced a non-study-related, severe, adverse event. Only corneometry yielded a statistically significant difference, with decreased values following SLS challenge at the placebo sites (P < 0. 05). Intraindividual comparisons showed superior results at the dexpanthenol-treated sites in 11 cases and in only 1 case at the placebo site. 6 volunteers experienced an irritant contact dermatitis, with more severe symptoms at the placebo site in 5 cases.

40|$|The {{current study}} {{presents}} the simultaneous quantification of <b>dexpanthenol</b> and resorcinol from marketed hair care formulation. <b>Dexpanthenol</b> is often present {{as an active}} ingredient in personal care products for its beautifying and invigorating properties and restorative and smoothing properties. On the other hand resorcinol is mainly prescribed {{for the treatment of}} seborrheic dermatitis of scalp. The toxic side effects of resorcinol limit its use in dermatological preparations. Therefore an accurate quantification technique for the simultaneous estimation of these two components can be helpful for the formulation industries for the accurate analysis of their product quality. In the current study a high performance liquid chromatographic technique has been developed using a C 18 column and a mobile phase consisting of phosphate buffer of pH = 2. 8 following a gradient elution. The mobile phase flow rate was 0. 6 [*]mL per minute and the detection wavelength was 210 [*]nm for <b>dexpanthenol</b> and 280 [*]nm for resorcinol. The linearity study was carried out using five solutions having concentrations ranging between 10. 34 [*]μg·mL− 1 and 82. 69 [*]μg·mL− 1 (r 2 = 0. 999) for resorcinol and 10. 44 [*]μg·mL− 1 and 83. 50 [*]μg·mL− 1 (r 2 = 0. 998) for <b>dexpanthenol.</b> The method has been validated as per ICH Q 2 (R 1) guidelines.

40|$|Despite {{efforts to}} prevent {{postoperative}} discomfort, {{there are still many}} immediate side effects associated with the surgical extraction of impacted lower third molars. Cicatrization is a physiological process through which the loss of integrity of oral mucosa is recovered and damaged tissues are repaired. Bexident Post (ISDIN, Spain) is a topical gel that contains chitosan, 0. 2 % chlorhexidine, allantoin and <b>dexpanthenol.</b> While this gel has many clinical indications, there are no published clinical trials evaluating its use in impacted mandibular third molar surgery. This study aims to clinically evaluate the efficacy of a gel containing chitosan, 0. 2 % chlorhexidine, allantoin and <b>dexpanthenol</b> on wound healing and reduction of postoperative side effects and complications after extraction of an impacted mandibular third molar. A split-mouth design study was carried out on a total of 50 bilaterally and symmetrically impacted third molar extractions, which were randomly placed into either a control group (CG= 25) or an experimental group (EG= 25). Patients were all informed of {{the purpose of the study}} and provided written consent. All procedures were carried out by the same dental practitioner, in accordance with standard surgical protocol. A different dental practitioner, unaware of which treatment had been applied, provided follow-up care.

Test strains included (ATCC 10541) and (ATCC 10231) in accordance with the standard methods of the German Hygiene and Microbiology Society with the following three organic challenges: i) cell culture medium MEM with Earle’s salts, L-glutamine and 10 % foetal calf serum (CCM); ii) 10 % sheep’s blood; iii) or a mixture of 4. 5 % albumin, 4. 5 % sheep’s blood and 1 % mucin. For methodological reasons, the wound cream was tested as a 55 % dilution, prepared with 1 % Tween 80 (equivalent to a content of 0. 275 % CHX instead of 0. 5 % as in the original preparation). CHX 0. 275 % was tested as control in an aqueous solution and in 1 % Tween 80. Additionally, 1 % Tween 80 was tested in order to rule out an interfering effect of the dilution medium. A combn of 3 % Tween 80, 3 % saponin, 0. 1 % histidine, 0. 3 % lecithin, 0. 5 % Na-thiosulphate and 1 % ether sulphate was identified as the most appropriate neutraliser during the experiments. Results: Exposed to CCM or 10 % sheep’s blood, the tested wound cream fulfilled the requirements for a wound antiseptic against both test species with ≥ 3 log reduction at 10 minutes. Even at the the worst-case challenge test with 4. 5 % albumin, 4. 5 % sheep’s blood and 1 % mucin, the requirement for a ≥ 3 log reduction was met after 24 hours of exposure. Interestingly, the aqueous solution of 0. 275 % CHX tested as control did not achieve the antimicrobial efficacy of the combination of CHX and 5 % <b>dexpanthenol.</b> 1 % Tween 80 was ineffective against both test species. Conclusion: Bepanthen Antiseptic Wound Cream achieves the bactericidal and fungicidal efficacy required for a wound antiseptic under three different challenges, despite dilution to 55 % of the original preparation. So far, the addition of <b>dexpanthenol</b> was intended to support wound healing. However, our results indicate that the antiseptic efficacy of CHX is synergistically increased by adding 5 % <b>dexpanthenol.</b> Acknowledging the antimicrobial and residual efficacy of CHX, and bearing in the mind the contraindications to CHX (allergy and anaphylaxis), the tested wound cream should be regarded as better suitable to be used as wound antiseptic than preparations on basis of CHX alone...|$|E

40|$|Silicone-based {{formulations}} are extensively {{used for}} the management of hypertrophic scars. Although the exact mechanism of action is still unknown, it has been postulated that some occlusion and hydration of the stratum corneum with subsequent cytokine-mediated signaling from keratinocytes to dermal fibroblasts is involved in its antiscarring effects. In this study, the effectiveness of silicone-based gels containing allantoin, <b>dexpanthenol,</b> and heparin was evaluated for improving the healing of hypertrophic scars. It was found that silicone-based gels showed remarkable improvements in hypertrophic scar healing and low amounts of skin pigmentation in the rabbit ear model compared with the nontreated control or base alone. Furthermore, the histopathological and histomorphometrical profiles of three different formulations containing 1 %, 5 %, and 20 % silicone contents exhibited marked or significant decreases in the scar elevation index, anterior skin and epithelial thicknesses, inflammatory cells, vessels, collagen disorganization, and fibroblasts compared with nontreated control hypertrophic scars.

The {{purpose of the present study}} was to compare the effectiveness of <b>dexpanthenol</b> and zinc oxide ointment with ointment base in the treatment of irritant diaper dermatitis from acute diarrhea in children by measuring transepidermal water loss (TEWL). Material and Method: Forty-six children with diarrhea were prospectively, block randomized, investigator-blinded to receive <b>dexpanthenol</b> and zinc oxide ointment on one side and ointment base on the other side. TEWL was measured before and on days 1, 3, and 7 of treatment together with the assessment of severity score. The efficacy of treatment was defined by complete clearance of the lesion. Results: TEWL in the treated and control side was not different before the application of the topical medica-tion. In the present study, the efficacy of 5 % <b>dexpanthenol</b> and zinc oxide ointment on D 3 was 39 % (18 from 46 patients) compared to 32 % in the ointment base side.

40|$|Abstract Background Guidelines for hand hygiene {{recommend}} {{the use of}} alcohol-based hand rubs containing humectants {{in order to improve}} dermal tolerance. However, the bactericidal efficacy of pre-surgical hand rubs is negatively affected by the WHO-recommended humectant glycerol, especially the 3 -h efficacy. The aim {{of this study was to}} investigate whether replacing glycerol as humectant increases the bactericidal efficacy of surgical hand rubs based on isopropanol (75 %, wt/wt). Material and methods The efficacy of 3 and 5  min applications of a modified WHO II-formulation (containing lower glycerol concentrations) and the TPH 5766 hand rub which contains a new humectant (containing ethylhexylglycerin, <b>dexpanthenol</b> and a fatty alcohol) were compared to the European Norm 12, 791 reference (n-propanol, 60 %, vol/vol) immediately following and 3  h after application. Results Immediately after application both isopropanol-based surgical rubs approximated the performance of the reference. The 3 -h effect of the modified WHO II-formulation was found to be less efficacious than the EN 12791, showing a 30 % decrease in log 10 reduction values. The 3 -h post application effect for the TPH 5766 hand rub was found to not be different from EN 12791. Conclusion Based on our data, the bactericidal efficacy of isopropanol-based surgical hand rubs can best be obtained if glycerol is not used in the formulation. Unlike glycerol, a humectant comprised of ethylhexylglycerin, <b>dexpanthenol</b> and a fatty alcohol was found not to decrease hand rub effectiveness.

40|$|Water-filtered infrared-A (wIRA) as {{a special}} form of heat {{radiation}} with a high tissue penetration and with a low thermal load to the skin surface acts both by thermal and thermic {{as well as by}} non-thermal and non-thermic effects. wIRA produces a therapeutically usable field of heat in the tissue and increases tissue temperature, tissue oxygen partial pressure, and tissue perfusion. These three factors are decisive for a sufficient tissue supply with energy and oxygen and consequently as well for wound healing and infection defense. wIRA can considerably alleviate the pain (with remarkably less need for analgesics) and diminish an elevated wound exudation and inflammation and can show positive immunomodulatory effects. wIRA can advance wound healing or improve an impaired wound healing both in acute and in chronic wounds including infected wounds. Even the normal wound healing process can be improved. A prospective, randomized, controlled, double-blind study with 111 patients after major abdominal surgery at the University Hospital Heidelberg, Germany, showed with 20 minutes irradiation twice a day (starting on the second postoperative day) in the group with wIRA and visible light VIS (wIRA(+VIS), approximately 75 % wIRA, 25 % VIS) compared to a control group with only VIS a significant and relevant pain reduction combined with a markedly decreased required dose of analgesics: during 230 single irradiations with wIRA(+VIS) the pain decreased without any exception (median of decrease of pain on postoperative days 2 - 6 was 13. 4 on a 100 mm visual analog scale VAS 0 - 100), while pain remained unchanged in the control group (p< 0. 001). The required dose of analgesics was 57 - 70 % lower in the subgroups with wIRA(+VIS) compared to the control subgroups with only VIS (median 598 versus 1398 ml ropivacaine, p< 0. 001, for peridural catheter analgesia; 31 versus 102 mg piritramide, p= 0. 001, for patient-controlled analgesia; 3. 4 versus 10. 2 g metamizole, p= 0. 005, for intravenous and oral analgesia). During irradiation with wIRA(+VIS) the subcutaneous oxygen partial pressure rose markedly by approximately 30 % and the subcutaneous temperature by approximately 2. 7 °C (both in a tissue depth of 2 cm), whereas both remained unchanged in the control group: after irradiation the median of the subcutaneous oxygen partial pressure was 41. 6 (with wIRA) versus 30. 2 mm Hg in the control group (p< 0. 001), the median of the subcutaneous temperature was 38. 9 versus 36. 4 °C (p< 0. 001). The overall evaluation of the effect of irradiation, including wound healing, pain and cosmesis, assessed on a VAS (0 - 100 with 50 as indifferent point of no effect) by the surgeon (median 79. 0 versus 46. 8, p< 0. 001) or the patient (79. 0 versus 50. 2, p< 0. 001) was markedly better in the group with wIRA compared to the control group. This was also true for single aspects: Wound healing assessed on a VAS by the surgeon (median 88. 6 versus 78. 5, p< 0. 001) or the patient (median 85. 8 versus 81. 0, p= 0. 040, trend) and cosmetic result assessed on a VAS by the surgeon (median 84. 5 versus 76. 5, p< 0. 001) or the patient (median 86. 7 versus 73. 6, p= 0. 001). In addition there was a trend in favor of the wIRA group to a lower rate of total wound infections (3 of 46, approximately 7 %, versus 7 of 48, approximately 15 %, p= 0. 208) including late infections after discharge, caused by the different rate of late infections after discharge: 0 of 46 in the wIRA group and 4 of 48 in the control group. And there was a trend towards a shorter postoperative hospital stay: 9 days in the wIRA group versus 11 days in the control group (p= 0. 037). The principal finding of this study was that postoperative irradiation with wIRA can improve even a normal wound healing process. A prospective, randomized, controlled, double-blind study with 45 severely burned children at the Children’s Hospital Park Schönfeld, Kassel, Germany, showed with 30 minutes irradiation once a day (starting on the first day, day of burn as day 1) in the group with wIRA and visible light VIS (wIRA(+VIS), approximately 75 % wIRA, 25 % VIS) compared to a control group with only VIS a markedly faster reduction of wound size. On the fifth day (after 4 days with irradiation) decision was taken, whether surgical debridement of necrotic tissue was necessary because of deeper (second degree, type b) burns (11 of 21 in the group with wIRA, 14 of 24 in the control group) or non-surgical treatment was possible (second degree, type a, burns). The patients treated conservatively were kept within the study and irradiated till complete reepithelialization. The patients in the group with wIRA showed a markedly faster reduction of wound area: a median reduction of wound size of 50 % was reached already after 7 days compared to 9 days in the control group, a median reduction of wound size of 90 % was already achieved after 9 days compared to 13 days in the control group. In addition the group with wIRA showed superior results till 3 months after the burn in terms of the overall surgical assessment of the wound, cosmesis, and assessment of effects of irradiation compared to the control group. In a prospective, randomized, controlled study with 12 volunteers at the University Medical Center Charité, Berlin, Germany, within each volunteer 4 experimental superficial wounds (5 mm diameter) as an acute wound model were generated by suction cup technique, removing the roof of the blister with a scalpel and a sterile forceps (day 1). 4 different treatments were used and investigated during 10 days: no therapy, only wIRA(+VIS) (approximately 75 % wIRA, 25 % VIS; 30 minutes irradiation once a day), only <b>dexpanthenol</b> (= D-panthenol) cream once a day, wIRA(+VIS) and <b>dexpanthenol</b> cream once a day. Healing of the small experimental wounds was from a clinical point of view excellent with all 4 treatments. Therefore there were only small differences between the treatments with slight advantages of the combination wIRA(+VIS) and <b>dexpanthenol</b> cream and of <b>dexpanthenol</b> cream alone concerning relative change of wound size and assessment of feeling of the wound area. However laser scanning microscopy with a scoring system revealed differences between the 4 treatments concerning the formation of the stratum corneum (from first layer of corneocytes to full formation) especially on the days 5 - 7 : fastest formation of the stratum corneum was seen in wounds treated with wIRA(+VIS) and <b>dexpanthenol</b> cream, second was wIRA(+VIS) alone, third <b>dexpanthenol</b> cream alone and last were untreated wounds. Bacterial counts of the wounds (taken every 2 days) showed, that wIRA(+VIS) and the combination of wIRA(+VIS) with <b>dexpanthenol</b> cream were able to inhibit the colonisation with physiological skin flora up to day 5 when compared with the two other groups (untreated group and group with <b>dexpanthenol</b> cream alone). At any investigated time, the amount of colonisation under therapy with wIRA(+VIS) alone was lower (interpreted as more suppressed) compared with the group with wIRA(+VIS) and <b>dexpanthenol</b> cream. During rehabilitation after hip and knee endoprosthetic operations the resorption of wound seromas and wound hematomas was both clinically and sonographically faster and pain was reduced by irradiation with wIRA(+VIS). wIRA can be used successfully for persistent postoperative pain e. g. after thoracotomy. As perspectives for wIRA it seems clinically prudent to use wIRA both pre- and postoperatively, e. g. in abdominal and thoracic operations. wIRA can be used preoperatively (e. g. during 1 - 2 weeks) to precondition donor and recipient sites of skin flaps, transplants or partial-thickness skin grafts, and postoperatively to improve wound healing and to decrease pain, inflammation and infections at all mentioned sites. wIRA can be used to support routine pre- or intraoperative antibiotic administration or it might even be discussed to replace this under certain conditions by wIRA...|$|E
30|$|Numerous {{studies have}} shown that Ag NPs {{toxicity}} to algae was mainly driven by Ag ions dissolved in the exposure medium rather than Ag NPs and also depended on Ag NPs coatings and sizes [80, 84 – 89]. Our study revealed high toxicity of Ag NPs thus suitable for algicidal applications. The ionic Ag and/or Ag NPs (5  nm) could directly enter algal cells [90], causing damage to the cell membranes and other cellular compartments by ROS formation. Moreover, Ag NPs could damage algal cells by direct interaction between NPs and algal cells [72] or the type of NPs coating could play a significant role. For example, <b>dexpanthenol,</b> polyethylene glycol and polyvinyl polypyrrolidone coatings caused a similar effect as AgNO 3 on C. reinhardtii, while carbonate, chitosan, and citrate decreased the Ag effect on photosynthesis [87]. Our Ag NPs showed strong effect toward C. reinhardtii regardless GK coating.|$|E

30|$|Inhalation {{anesthesia}} with isoflurane {{was used}} and {{the eyes of the}} animals were protected with <b>dexpanthenol</b> eye ointment. Anesthesia was initiated 15  min ahead of experiments by placing the animal in a cage ventilated with oxygen (3.5  L/min) containing 3 % isoflurane. Throughout the experiments, anesthesia was maintained by adjusting the isoflurane content (0.6 % to 2 %) to ensure a respiratory rate in the range 80 to 100 /min. For i.v. injection, we inserted a tailored catheter into the lateral tail vein. Simultaneously with a slow bolus injection of 50 to 200  μL of tracer solution, we started the PET with scan duration of 45  min in 3 D list mode on a Siemens Inveon system (axial field-of-view of 12.7  cm with a bore diameter of 12  cm, approximately 1.4  mm full-width-at-half-maximum spatial resolution; Siemens Healthcare, Erlangen, Germany). After tracer injection, we flushed the catheter with 50 to 100  μL of isotonic sodium chloride solution. During the scan, a heating pad prevented hypothermia. The radioactivity in the syringe was measured immediately before and after injection with a Capintec CRC® 15 R (Capintec Inc, 6 Arrow Road Ramsey, NJ, USA) dose calibrator.|$|E

This prospective, controlled, parallel-group {{observational}} {{study investigated the}} efficacy of a spray containing hyaluronic acid and <b>dexpanthenol</b> to optimise regular treatment after nasal cavity surgery in 49 patients with chronic rhinosinusitis. Methods. The control group received standard therapy. Mucosal regeneration was determined using rhinoscopy sum score (RSS). Pre- and postoperative nasal patency was tested using anterior rhinomanometry. The participants were questioned about their symptoms. Results. Regarding all RSS parameters (dryness, dried nasal mucus, fibrin deposition, and obstruction), mucosal regeneration achieved good final results in both groups, tending to a better improvement through the spray application, without statistically significant differences during the whole assessment period, the mean values being 7. 04, 5. 00, 3. 66, and 3. 00 (intervention group) and 7. 09, 5. 14, 4. 36, and 3. 33 (control group).

Methods: Wistar rats (50) were anesthetized (Thionembutal - Sodic = 50 mg/Kg), 1 cm 2 of dorsal region skin was removed, and the animals were divided into five groups: control (C), gel (G), US (3 MHz, 0. 1 W/cm 2, 1 minute, continuous), d-P (10 %) and US+d-P. After daily treatment for 7 and 14 days, 6 μm thick sections of lesioned areas were stained in picrosirius and measurements of the collagen birefringent area (μm 2) were obtained using polarized light microscopy (Zeiss Axiolab-ZEISS- Germany) with histological image analysis software (KS 400 2. 0 - Kontrol Eletronics, Munique, Germany). The means were compared by ANOVA followed by the Tukey test (p< 0. 05). Results: The US+d-P group showed a significantly greater (p≥ 0. 001) birefringent area (1586. 43 ± 162. 14) than the other experimental groups: C (139. 36 ± 35. 35), US (317. 55 ± 129. 9) and d-P (192. 41 ± 3657) by the 7 th day of treatment, indicating acceleration of the wound healing process.

40|$|Although {{previous}} studies have reported the use of metabolomics for Mycobacterium species differentiation, {{little is known about}} the potential of extracellular metabolites of Mycobacterium tuberculosis (MTB) as specific biomarkers. Using an optimized ultrahigh performance liquid chromatography-electrospray ionization-quadruple time of flight-mass spectrometry (UHPLC-ESI-Q-TOF-MS) platform, we characterized the extracellular metabolomes of culture supernatant of nine MTB strains and nine non-tuberculous Mycobacterium (NTM) strains (four M. avium complex, one M. bovis Bacillus Calmette-Guérin (BCG), one M. chelonae, one M. fortuitum and two M. kansasii). Principal component analysis readily distinguished the metabolomes between MTB and NTM. Using multivariate and univariate analysis, 24 metabolites with significantly higher levels in MTB were identified. While seven metabolites were identified by tandem mass spectrometry (MS/MS), the other 17 metabolites were unidentified by MS/MS against database matching, suggesting that they may be potentially novel compounds. One metabolite was identified as <b>dexpanthenol,</b> the alcohol analog of pantothenic acid (vitamin B 5), which was not known to be produced by bacteria previously. Four metabolites were identified as 1 -tuberculosinyladenosine (1 -TbAd), a product of the virulence-associated enzyme Rv 3378 c, and three previously undescribed derivatives of 1 -TbAd. Two derivatives differ from 1 -TbAd by the ribose group of the nucleoside while the other likely differs by the base. The remaining two metabolites were identified as a tetrapeptide, Val-His-Glu-His, and a monoacylglycerophosphoglycerol, phosphatidylglycerol (PG) (16 : 0 / 0 : 0), respectively. Further studies on the chemical structure and biosynthetic pathway of these MTB-specific metabolites would help understand their biological functions.

40|$|<b>Dexpanthenol</b> (DXP) is an {{alcoholic}} analogue of pantothenic acid with reported ant-inflammatory and regenerative properties. Topical DXP {{acts like a}} moisturizer, improving stratum corneum hydration, reducing trans epidermal water loss and maintaining skin softness and elasticity. However, DXP lacks the ability to penetrate into deeper layers of the skin, which reduces its potential applications. Studies over the last decades showed possible application of lipid vesicles {{as a tool to}} improve drug topical delivery. The aim {{of this study was to}} prepare an optimized lipid nanoparticle formulation (LNF) containing 1 % of DXP for dermal delivery. Soy phosphatidylcholine (PC) (> 95 % purity, Lipoid GmbH, Switzerland), cholesterol (CHOL) (Sigma Aldrich, Germany), Tween 80 (T) (Sigma Aldrich, Germany) and deionized water were selected as main components forming the LNF. Optimization plan was prepared using experimental design software Design Expert® 7 (Stat-Ease). It was based on LNFs responses of particle size, polydispersity index (PDI), ζ-potential, pH, entrapment efficiency (EE) and in vitro release. The optimization factor was the amount of PC, while the selected amounts of CHOL and T were 3 % and 8 % of PC mass, respectively. The preparation procedure of LNs was the following: the components were stirred for 2 hours and left for “swelling of lipids” overnight followed by direct sonication as homogenization method. The LNs were analyzed 24 hours after preparation. The response optimization of experiments was the liposome formulation containing 797, 0 mg of PC per 10 mL of preparation. The experimental results of characterization of optimal liposome formulation were in good agreement with those predicted by the optimization software. The characteristics of obtained optimal formulation were: particle size 62, 75 ± 0. 97 nm, polydispersity index was 0, 224 ± 0. 006, pH 7, 2 ± 0. 08, EE 51. 41 ± 5. 09 %. ζ-potential observed with lipid preparations showed that the negativ...|$|E
40|$|Various {{factors have}} been invoked to explain the {{toxicity}} of silver nanoparticles (AgNP) to microorganisms including particle size {{and the nature of}} stabilizing coatings as well as the amount of dissolved silver occurring in AgNP suspensions. In this study we have assessed the effects of nine differently coated AgNP (chitosan, lactate, polyvinylpyrrolidone, polyethelene glycol, gelatin, sodium dodecylbenzenesulfonate, citrate, <b>dexpanthenol,</b> and carbonate) and AgNO 3 on the photosynthesis of the freshwater algae Chlamydomonas reinhardtii. We have thus examined how AgNP effects on algae relate to particle size, measured dissolved silver (Agd), and bioavailable silver (Agbioav). Agbioav was indirectly estimated in toxicity experiments by cysteine–silver complexation at the EC 50. The EC 50 calculated as a function of measured Agd concentrations showed for some coatings values similar to that of dissolved Ag, whereas other coated AgNP displayed lower EC 50 values. In all cases, excess cysteine completely prevented effects on photosynthetic yield, confirming the role of Agd as a cause of the observed effect on the photosynthesis. Toxicity was related neither to particle size nor to the coatings. For all differently coated AgNP suspensions, the EC 50 values calculated as a function of Agbioav were comparable to the value of AgNO 3. Depending on the coatings Agbioav was comparable to or higher than measured Agd [...] © 2015 American Chemical Society.

Activate tissue regeneration shown previously for riboflavin, and сheleretrin / sanguirythrine. The combination of the alkaloids and riboflavin pharmacologically fully justified. The research aim was to check the mechanism action of the Diavenol gel - through stimulation of the pluripotent cells growth and determination the effectiveness of the gel for wound healing at experimental model in rats. Materials and methods. In a study 128 rats were used, of which 38 - in the pharmacological experiment with a stencil wound healing, and 90 in the experiment to study the influence of gel on CD 34 cells amount in the blood in rats with chemically induced immunodeficiency. High immunodeficiency caused a five-fold administration of cyclophosphamide, prednisone and rubomycin. CD 34 expression level was determined using flow cytometry FACS Calibur. Results and discussion. Topical skin application the Diavenol gel samples in rats helped to accelerate the regeneration process is about 2 times, as evidenced by the excess of blood parameters in experimental group animals to the 30 th day, more than 2 times, while the indicators in the control group animals came to normal values only on the 60 th day. Increasing the number of pluripotent cells as well as acceleration of wound regeneration indicates preferential stimulation of stem cell growth in the periphery, rather than an enhancement of bone marrow function. The maximum effect of the Diavenol observed on the 60 th day and the restoration of the pluripotent cells physiological level have been observed on the 10 th day after the start of Diavenol application. Due to the fact, that the gel was applied to intact skin, we can say that Diavenol had resorptive properties. Treatment of wounds in rats Diavenol gel resulted in a more rapid removal of inflammation and significant acceleration of stencil wound healing. In terms of the granulation appearance and wounds epithelialization the Diavenol gel has some advantage in relation to the <b>dexpanthenol</b> ointment...|$|E
