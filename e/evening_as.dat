5|$|As Danielle tracked westward {{into the}} open Atlantic early on August14, the storm {{encountered}} warmer water southwest of Cape Verde and began to gradually intensify, becoming a moderate tropical storm with 50mph (85km/h) winds that morning. At that point, a bout of rapid intensification began to take place, and the storm was upgraded to Hurricane Danielle that <b>evening</b> <b>as</b> an eye began to form. Over a 24‑hour period ending {{in the morning of}} August15, the pressure fell from 1004 to 978mbar and the winds increased to 90mph (145km/h), making it a high-end Category1 hurricane on the Saffir-Simpson hurricane scale.|$|E
5|$|Because of the immigrants’ {{loneliness}} {{for their}} homeland, Addams started hosting ethnic evenings at Hull House. This would include ethnic food, dancing, music, {{and maybe a}} short lecture on a topic of interest. Some of the themed evenings were Italian, Greek, German, Polish, etc. Ellen Gates Starr described one Italian <b>evening</b> <b>as</b> having the room packed full with people. One of the ladies who attended “recited a patriotic poem with great spirit” and everyone was moved by it.|$|E

5|$|Saturday (2005) is a {{novel by}} Ian McEwan set in Fitzrovia, London, on Saturday, 15 February 2003, as a large {{demonstration}} is taking place against the United States' 2003 invasion of Iraq. The protagonist, Henry Perowne, a 48-year-old neurosurgeon, has planned a series of chores and pleasures culminating in a family dinner in the <b>evening.</b> <b>As</b> he goes about his day, he ponders {{the meaning of the}} protest and the problems that inspired it; however, the day is disrupted by an encounter with a violent, troubled man.|$|E
5|$|The {{adrenal gland}} secretes a basal level of {{cortisol}} {{but can also}} produce bursts of the hormone in response to adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) from the anterior pituitary. Cortisol is not evenly released during the day – its concentrations in the blood are highest {{in the early morning}} and lowest in the <b>evening</b> <b>as</b> a result of the circadian rhythm of ACTH secretion. Cortisone is an inactive product of the action of the enzyme 11β-HSD on cortisol. The reaction catalyzed by 11β-HSD is reversible, which means that it can turn administered cortisone into cortisol, the biologically active hormone.|$|E

5|$|Advancing northward over land, the once-powerful {{hurricane}} weakened, with {{somewhat higher}} atmospheric pressures and winds of less severity reported at Charleston, South Carolina. Paralleling the coast while situated inland, it hastened quickly toward the north, swiftly passing through North Carolina and {{arriving in the}} Chesapeake Bay region by 13October. Southeasterly gusts persisted as the storm continued its northerly progression inland along {{the course of the}} East Coast of the United States. After reaching Washington, D.C., in the early morning, it arrived near New York City by sunrise, and transited across Boston during the afternoon of 13October. The storm likely underwent an extratropical transition by the time it arrived in New York state, elongating linearly east-to-west. The gale's winds swept toward the southeast with a brief hiatus in the early <b>evening.</b> <b>As</b> it neared New England, it produced little precipitation yet intense gusts, which peaked at force9-strength in the vicinity of New Bedford, Massachusetts. The cyclone's diameter over New England, at its largest point, reached , accompanied by Category2-force winds. The system was last sighted on the morning of 14October, rapidly weakening as it meandered into the Canadian Maritimes.|$|E
5|$|Five {{minutes into}} the match, D.C. United first-year player Chris Pontius had the first chance of the <b>evening</b> <b>as</b> he pushed past Sounders FC defender Leonardo González to receive a {{diagonal}} pass from Clyde Simms. However, due to the difficult shooting angle, Pontius' shot was wide of the far post. In the 10th minute, Sounders FC forward Fredy Montero had a close range shot on goal, but D.C. goalkeeper Josh Wicks parried the shot away. Seven minutes later, Christian Gomez had a goal scoring opportunity with a direct free kick from , but his low kick curled just wide of the target. In the 18th minute, Seattle midfielder Sebastian Le Toux played a ball in to teammate Freddie Ljungberg, whose shot on goal was barely saved by Wicks, who kicked out a foot to block the shot. Just before halftime, Le Toux crossed to an unmarked Montero, whose direct header on goal was just in reach of Wicks, who again made the save to keep the score level, 0–0. Seattle outshot D.C. 9–6 in the first half.|$|E

5|$|Grey reef {{sharks are}} fast-swimming, agile predators that feed {{primarily}} on free-swimming bony fishes and cephalopods. Their aggressive demeanor {{enables them to}} dominate many other shark species on the reef, despite their moderate size. Many grey reef sharks have a home range on a specific area of the reef, to which they continually return. However, they are social rather than territorial. During the day, these sharks often form groups of five to 20 individuals near coral reef drop-offs, splitting up in the <b>evening</b> <b>as</b> the sharks begin to hunt. Adult females also form groups in very shallow water, where the higher water temperature may accelerate their growth or that of their unborn young. Like other members of its family, the grey reef shark is viviparous, meaning the mother nourishes her embryos through a placental connection. Litters of one to six pups are born every other year.|$|E
5|$|In January 1995, Qubilah Shabazz {{was charged}} with trying to hire an assassin to kill Farrakhan in {{retaliation}} for the murder of her father. Farrakhan surprised the Shabazz family when he defended Qubilah, saying he did not think she was guilty and that he hoped she would not be convicted. That May, Betty Shabazz and Farrakhan shook hands on the stage of the Apollo Theater during a public event intended to raise money for Qubilah's legal defense. Some heralded the <b>evening</b> <b>as</b> a reconciliation between the two, but others thought Shabazz was doing whatever she had to in order to protect her daughter. Regardless, nearly $250,000 was raised that evening. In the aftermath, Shabazz maintained a cool relationship with Farrakhan, although she agreed to speak at his Million Man March that October.|$|E
5|$|Intrepid steamed from Ulithi {{back to the}} Philippines {{with orders}} to strike Nichols and Nielsen airfields, destroy {{shipping}} in Manila Bay and to attack concentrations of enemy aircraft encountered between Manila and Batangas. This effort began on November 19. The first strike of the day ran into token resistance {{from a handful of}} Zeros, but the enemies did not press home attacks on the bomber squadrons. Instead, VF-18 fighters initiated combat, chasing down and destroying two enemy aircraft. A solitary Zero flying at higher altitude was spotted by Harris, who led his division in pursuit. Harris put holes in the enemy fighter's starboard wing root firing from long range. The Japanese pilot bailed out, but his plane continued flying for four or five minutes with curious Hellcats following in its wake. They eventually shot down the unmanned aircraft. Intrepid went to general quarters a number of times throughout the day's strikes and into the <b>evening</b> <b>as</b> enemy planes tested the perimeter of the task group.|$|E

The unit entered Kupres in the late afternoon, {{followed}} by two battalions of the 13th Partisan Brigade. A battalion of the 11th Motorised Brigade performed mopping up operations in the Zlosela area. A part of the Bosnian Croat TO force was retreating in disarray, while a portion of the force was trapped in Kupres and Zlosela, trying to break out.

5|$|The episodes have aired since October 5, 2004, on TV Tokyo in Japan. Viz Media {{obtained}} the foreign television, home video, and merchandising {{rights to the}} Bleach anime from TV Tokyo Corporation and Shueisha on March 15, 2006. Subsequently, Viz Media contracted Studiopolis to create the English adaptation of the anime, and has licensed its individual Bleach merchandising rights to several different companies. The English adaptation of the Bleach anime premiered on Canada's YTV channel in the Bionix programming block on September 8, 2006. Cartoon Network began airing Bleach the following <b>evening</b> <b>as</b> part of Adult Swim. Adult Swim stopped broadcasting new episodes of the English adaptation on October 20, 2007, after airing the first 52 episodes of the series. It was replaced with another Viz Media series, Death Note, to provide Studiopolis more time to dub additional episodes of the series. The series returned from hiatus on March 2, 2008, and had returned to hiatus {{for almost a year}} after airing episode 167 on November 21, 2009. The hiatus ended on August 28, 2010, with the airing of episode 168 and the show has been regularly airing with new episodes since.|$|E
5|$|The {{formation}} of Hurricane Rafael {{is attributed to}} a low-latitude tropical wave that emerged off the western coast of Africa on October5. The wave remained disorganized until roughly midway between the Cape Verde Islands and Lesser Antilles, at which time a broad {{area of low pressure}} developed and convection began to consolidate around it. As a result, the disturbance was introduced into the National Hurricane Center (NHC)'s 48-hour Tropical Weather Outlook with a low chance of tropical development. These chances were subsequently raised as further development occurred, with the system receiving a medium chance of development early on October10, and a high chance of development as it approached the southern Leeward Islands late the following <b>evening.</b> <b>As</b> the wave crossed into the eastern Caribbean Sea and slowed down, the previously broad and open surface low consolidated and became stacked with the mid-level center. The disturbance was already producing tropical storm-force winds, and as a result, skipped tropical depression status to become Tropical Storm Rafael at 1800UTC on October12. At this time, the cyclone was located roughly 200mi (320km) south-southeast of St. Croix.|$|E

5|$|A North Indian shopkeeper {{was killed}} in Bhandup, Mumbai after he refused to shut down his shop when MNS activists protesting Raj's arrest forced him to do so. Four persons were killed and another seriously injured in a village near Kalyan. Deputy {{commissioner}} of police (rural) Sanjay Shintre said two North Indians, {{a member of the}} Agri community and an MNS worker were killed in a clash between the two communities in Pisavali, 10km from Kalyan. Earlier, curfew had been imposed in the entire Kalyan area. The situation in Kalyan worsened in the <b>evening</b> <b>as</b> Raj was driven there to a police station lock-up where he was to spend the night before being presented in a court on 22 October. Five outdoor broadcast vans belonging to media houses were damaged by MNS supporters. A cameraman from ETV was injured and had to be admitted to a private hospital. One Kalyan-Dombivli municipal transport bus was set on fire while five bikes were reduced to ashes. Transport services across Kalyan were paralysed. A jewellery shop was also ransacked by MNS supporters. In all one hundred and twenty-five cases of arson, rioting and stonepelting were registered across the state, including in Pune and Marathwada, by early evening, and 2,085 people were arrested, state director general of police A N Roy said.|$|E
5|$|A slow {{weakening}} trend began {{early on}} September 27 {{due to the}} increased shear while remaining on a west-northwest track. At the same time, the center of circulation became exposed at times due to the southwesterly wind shear. As a result, an unusual wind field was observed in that the strongest winds were recorded well {{to the east and}} to the northwest of the center. The weakening trend remained fairly slow that <b>evening</b> <b>as</b> the storm continued to produce persistent deep convection. The weakening trend accelerated on September 28 as the convection weakened and the circulation became more disorganized in the high-shear environment. By that morning, Karen weakened to a minimal tropical storm with 40mph (65km/h) winds. Karen also turned abruptly to the north for a short while, as convection interacted with the low-level center and southerly winds increased in the low-level environment. The weakening trend slowed that afternoon as deep convection returned to the disorganized storm. Early on September 29, the high wind shear continued and Karen weakened to a tropical depression with a very poorly defined center. That afternoon, the circulation dissipated while east of the Lesser Antilles. Remnant squalls continued across the area east of the Lesser Antilles for a few days after dissipation.|$|E

Michael arrives in his tow truck, and Emma explains that he at least has to see his children, as she could not leave Henry after seeing the life he had. Seeing Ava and Nicholas face to face changes his mind, and Michael accepts them into his life. Later, Emma shares Henry's theory with Mary Margaret (Ginnifer Goodwin), that she is Snow White's daughter and Mary Margaret is Snow White. Mary finds this laughable, but seeing Emma's blanket triggers some sort of reaction from her. After a minute, however, she is quick to dismiss it as nothing.|$|E
