5|$|From Liverpool's {{point of}} view, the {{situation}} was that Shankly had retired and the club <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>move</b> on. Shankly did not understand that by turning up for training at Melwood, he was effectively undermining Bob Paisley, who had succeeded him as manager, {{even to the point}} of actually taking over the training. Tommy Smith recalled that Shankly as manager never ran training and would only speak to Paisley, Fagan and Bennett about what needed to be done. But, as a visitor at Melwood he began to intervene and Paisley's initial pleasure on seeing him soon turned to polite embarrassment. Eventually, Paisley had to point out to Shankly that he didn't work there any more, that it was now Paisley's team and that he had things which he wanted to do with the team.|$|E
5|$|George III {{reversed}} {{this trend}} {{when he came}} to the throne in 1760. George disliked Hampton Court, and was attracted by the park at Windsor Castle. George wanted to move into the Ranger's House by the castle, but his brother, Henry was already living in it and refused to move out. Instead, George <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>move</b> into the Upper Lodge, later called the Queen's Lodge, and started the long process of renovating the castle and the surrounding parks. Initially the atmosphere at the castle remained very informal, with local children playing games inside the Upper and Lower Wards, and the royal family frequently seen as they walked around the grounds. As time went by, however, access for visitors became more limited.|$|E

5|$|Himmler {{joined the}} Nazi Party (NSDAP) in August 1923; his Party number was 14,303. As {{a member of}} Röhm's {{paramilitary}} unit, Himmler {{was involved in the}} Beer Hall Putsch—an unsuccessful attempt by Hitler and the NSDAP to seize power in Munich. This event would set Himmler on a life of politics. He was questioned by the police about his role in the putsch, but was not charged because of insufficient evidence. However, he lost his job, was unable to find employment as an agronomist, and <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>move</b> in with his parents in Munich. Frustrated by these failures, he became ever more irritable, aggressive, and opinionated, alienating both friends and family members.|$|E
5|$|Hornish {{returned}} to the Sprint Cup Series for one race in Penske's No. 12: the STP 400 at Kansas Speedway. Starting in 10th place, he led for seven laps and finished 19th (one lap behind). Midway through the season, Hornish replaced A. J. Allmendinger in Penske's No. 22 car after Allmendinger was suspended by NASCAR for failing a drug test. Allmendinger qualified in eighth place, but due to the driver change Hornish <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>move</b> {{to the rear of}} the field. He finished 33rd, after a mid-race crash required ten laps of repair time. Hornish drove the car in the remaining races, with a season-best fifth place at Watkins Glen. Aside from that race, his best finishes were a trio of eleventh places at Atlanta, Richmond and Chicagoland. Hornish's best start of the season was fourth at Dover, where he finished 25th (seven laps behind).|$|E
5|$|In 1998 Salon {{reported}} that Scientologists were now blocked from viewing sites critical of Scientology including Operation Clambake and alt.religion.scientology, {{through the use}} of a content-control software program referred to by critics as Scieno Sitter. The Church of Scientology was unable to shut down Operation Clambake's internet service provider in Norway. The organization succeeded in shutting down the upstream connection to the site's internet service provider, Netherlands-based Xtended Internet. In November 2002, Xtended Internet's upstream provider, Cignal Global Communications received a letter from Church of Scientology counsel alleging copyright and trademark infringement involved with Xenu.net. This letter led to Cignal Global Communications, a United States-based company, terminating its service with Xtended Internet, which <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>move</b> their company to a new backbone provider.|$|E
