25|$|He {{also created}} the <b>hollow</b> <b>steel</b> bow (particularly {{appreciated}} by Charles de BÃ©riot, among others), and the 'self-rehairing' bow. For the latter, the hair purchased in prepared hanks could be inserted by the {{player in the}} time it takes to change a string, and was tightened or loosened by a simple mechanism inside the frog. The frog itself was fixed to the stick, and the balance of the bow thus remained constant when the hair stretched with use.|$|E
25|$|Set {{off from}} the main {{building}} by approximately 13 metres to the north-west and south-east are two wide butterfly-roofed, steel-framed shelters with built-in seating that faces both tracks. Four steel T-shaped components support steel perforated purlins, which inturn support the corrugated metal roof sheeting. The former divide the seating lengths. Set about {{four and a half}} metres apart, they are made with two cantilevered, tapering I-beams bolted to a rectangular <b>hollow</b> <b>steel</b> column (made with two C-sections welded together) which is founded in a concrete upstand. A perpendicular upstand runs the length of the shelter along the midline. Welded to the steel columns and beams are lighter steel frames. The infill panels of glass have been removed, as have some of the steel ones, while others are corroded. The seating is made with painted timber slats supported on timber studs and some steel framing. The downpipes taking water from the box gutter continue the rhythm of the columns, piercing the timber caps that join the two sides of seating at the centre of each gap.|$|E

He instantly called Bryce, and his heart leaped with joy when he heard the familiar voice in his ear. Now he talked steadily on for more than an hour. He had his gardener called, and he told him all that he wanted done in the flower-beds. He gave many directions in regard to the various operations of the Works. Things had been put back a great deal of late. He hoped soon to have everything going on in the ordinary way.

40|$|A {{torsion test}} {{recently}} implemented for solid oxide fuel cell sealant materials is analyzed {{as a method}} for measuring the shear strength of sealant for solid oxide fuel cells. The finite element method is used to simulate the stress distribution in the hourglass-shaped steel specimens with intermediate sealant layer with different specimen's dimensions and configurations. Also, it is analyzed how stress concentration changes if the sealant does not completely fill the gap or is squeezed out of gap. The reduction of seal thickness to outer radius ratio results {{in an increase in}} stress concentration at the outer edge of sealant. The developed specimens with a <b>hollow</b> halve <b>steel</b> plate as well as the ones with two <b>hollow</b> halve <b>steel</b> plates appear to be suitable choices for torsional shear strength test, reducing the torque for fracture and stress concentrations. Effects of lack of filling and squeezing out of gap onto the stress distribution are negligible compared to the effect of pre-existing discontinuities...|$|R

40|$|AbstractThe {{importance}} of economical construction of infrastructures has recently increased. The application of spiral steel pipes to bridge piers is {{considered as one}} of the effective methods. Spiral steel pipes have been seldom used for bridge piers. Currently, spiral steel pipes have been mainly used as the foundations of buildings or bridges and are relatively economical because they are produced in large quantities in factories. However, roll forming processes of spiral steel pipes are different from those of bending roll pipes which have been generally used as bridge piers, so that seismic performance of spiral steel pipes may be different from that of bending roll pipes. Therefore, {{it is very important to}} grasp the ultimate strength and the ductility of spiral steel pipes. In this study, the finite element analysis was conducted for grasping the elasto-plastic behavior of <b>hollow</b> spiral <b>steel</b> pipes. Based on the analysis results, the seismic performance of <b>hollow</b> spiral <b>steel</b> pipes under compressive axial force and bending moment was examined and the influences of the structural parameters on the seismic performances of the spiral steel pipes are discussed...|$|R
