5|$|The photon is the <b>gauge</b> <b>boson</b> for electromagnetism, and {{therefore}} all other quantum {{numbers of the}} photon (such as lepton number, baryon number, and flavour quantum numbers) are zero. Also, the photon does not obey the Pauli exclusion principle.|$|E
5|$|The {{utility of}} Feynman {{diagrams}} {{is that other}} types of physical phenomena {{that are part of}} the general picture of fundamental interactions but are conceptually separate from forces can also be described using the same rules. For example, a Feynman diagram can describe in succinct detail how a neutron decays into an electron, proton, and neutrino, an interaction mediated by the same <b>gauge</b> <b>boson</b> that is responsible for the weak nuclear force.|$|E
5|$|Since the Maxwell {{theory of}} light allows for all {{possible}} energies of electromagnetic radiation, most physicists assumed initially {{that the energy}} quantization resulted from some unknown constraint on the matter that absorbs or emits the radiation. In 1905, Einstein {{was the first to}} propose that energy quantization was a property of electromagnetic radiation itself. Although he accepted the validity of Maxwell's theory, Einstein pointed out that many anomalous experiments could be explained if the energy of a Maxwellian light wave were localized into point-like quanta that move independently of one another, even if the wave itself is spread continuously over space. In 1909 and 1916, Einstein showed that, if Planck's law of black-body radiation is accepted, the energy quanta must also carry momentum , making them full-fledged particles. This photon momentum was observed experimentally by Arthur Compton, for which he received the Nobel Prize in 1927. The pivotal question was then: how to unify Maxwell's wave theory of light with its experimentally observed particle nature? The answer to this question occupied Albert Einstein {{for the rest of his}} life, and was solved in quantum electrodynamics and its successor, the Standard Model (see Second quantization and The photon as a <b>gauge</b> <b>boson,</b> below).|$|E

50|$|A similar problem arises with Yang-Mills theory (also {{known as}} non-abelian gauge theory), which predicts massless spin-1 <b>gauge</b> <b>bosons.</b> Massless weakly {{interacting}} <b>gauge</b> <b>bosons</b> lead to long-range forces, which are only observed for electromagnetism {{and the corresponding}} massless photon.

In addition we show that there is a generalisation, which expresses tree-level single trace Einstein-Yang-Mills amplitudes with $r$ gravitons and $(n-r) $ <b>gauge</b> <b>bosons</b> as a linear combination of pure Yang-Mills tree amplitudes with $n$ <b>gauge</b> <b>bosons.</b> We present a general formula for this case.

5|$|Photons, {{like all}} quantum objects, exhibit wave-like and particle-like properties. Their dual wave–particle nature can be {{difficult}} to visualize. The photon displays clearly wave-like phenomena such as diffraction and interference on the length scale of its wavelength. For example, a single photon passing through a double-slit experiment exhibits interference phenomena but only if no measure was made at the slit. A single photon passing through a double-slit experiment lands on the screen with a probability distribution given by its interference pattern determined by Maxwell's equations. However, experiments confirm that the photon is not a short pulse of electromagnetic radiation; it does not spread out as it propagates, nor does it divide when it encounters a beam splitter. Rather, the photon seems to be a point-like particle since it is absorbed or emitted as a whole by arbitrarily small systems, systems much smaller than its wavelength, such as an atomic nucleus (≈10−15 m across) or even the point-like electron. Nevertheless, the photon is not a point-like particle whose trajectory is shaped probabilistically by the electromagnetic field, as conceived by Einstein and others; that hypothesis was also refuted by the photon-correlation experiments cited above. According to our present understanding, the electromagnetic field itself is produced by photons, which in turn result from a local gauge symmetry and the laws of quantum field theory (see the Second quantization and <b>Gauge</b> <b>boson</b> sections below).|$|E
25|$|Although the {{discovery}} of the quarks led to reinterpretation of the rho meson as a vector bound state of a quark and an antiquark, it is sometimes still useful {{to think of it as}} the <b>gauge</b> <b>boson</b> of a hidden local symmetry.|$|E
25|$|The weak {{interaction}} {{is described by}} SU(2), so that instantons {{can be expected to}} play a role there as well. If so, they would induce baryon number violation. Due to the Higgs mechanism, instantons are not exact solutions anymore, but approximations can be used instead. One of the conclusions is that the presence of a <b>gauge</b> <b>boson</b> mass suppresses large instantons, so that the instanton gas approximation is consistent.|$|E

5|$|In the {{prevailing}} Standard Model of physics, the photon {{is one of}} four <b>gauge</b> <b>bosons</b> in the electroweak interaction; the other three are denoted W+, W− and Z0 and are responsible for the weak interaction. Unlike the photon, these <b>gauge</b> <b>bosons</b> have mass, owing to a mechanism that breaks their SU(2) gauge symmetry. The unification of the photon with W and Z <b>gauge</b> <b>bosons</b> in the electroweak interaction was accomplished by Sheldon Glashow, Abdus Salam and Steven Weinberg, for which they were awarded the 1979 Nobel Prize in physics. Physicists continue to hypothesize grand unified theories that connect these four <b>gauge</b> <b>bosons</b> with the eight gluon <b>gauge</b> <b>bosons</b> of quantum chromodynamics; however, key predictions of these theories, such as proton decay, have not been observed experimentally.|$|R
5000|$|In {{theoretical}} particle physics, maximally helicity violating amplitudes are amplitudes with n external <b>gauge</b> <b>bosons,</b> where n-2 <b>gauge</b> <b>bosons</b> have {{a particular}} helicity {{and the other two}} have the opposite helicity. These amplitudes are called MHV amplitudes, because at tree level, they violate helicity conservation to the maximum extent possible. The tree amplitudes in which all <b>gauge</b> <b>bosons</b> have the same helicity or all but one have the same helicity vanish.|$|R
25|$|Since gluons carry color charge, two gluons {{can also}} interact. A typical {{interaction}} vertex (called the three gluon vertex) for gluons involves g+g→g. This is shown here, {{along with its}} color-line representation. The color-line diagrams can be restated in terms of conservation laws of color; however, as noted before, {{this is not a}} gauge invariant language. Note that in a typical non-abelian gauge theory the <b>gauge</b> <b>boson</b> carries the charge of the theory, and hence has interactions of this kind; for example, the Wboson in the electroweak theory. In the electroweak theory, the W also carries electric charge, and hence interacts with a photon.|$|E
500|$|According to the electroweak theory, at {{very high}} energies, the {{universe}} has four massless <b>gauge</b> <b>boson</b> fields [...] each similar to the photon [...] and a complex scalar Higgs field doublet. However, at low energies, this gauge symmetry is spontaneously broken down to the U(1) symmetry of electromagnetism, since one of the Higgs fields acquires a vacuum expectation value. This symmetry-breaking would produce three massless bosons, but they become integrated by the three photon-like fields and acquire mass through the Higgs mechanism. These three fields become the , [...] and [...] bosons of the weak interaction. The fourth gauge field is the photon of electromagnetism, and remains massless.|$|E
2500|$|A gluon [...] is an {{elementary}} particle {{that acts as}} the exchange particle (or <b>gauge</b> <b>boson)</b> for the strong force between quarks.

50|$|The {{approximate}} flavor symmetries do have associated <b>gauge</b> <b>bosons,</b> observed particles {{like the}} rho and the omega, but these particles are {{nothing like the}} gluons {{and they are not}} massless.

2500|$|Notice the {{addition}} of fermion mass terms into the electroweak lagrangian is forbidden, since terms of the form [...] do not respect U(1)×SU(2)L gauge invariance. Neither {{is it possible to}} add explicit mass terms for the U(1) and SU(2) gauge fields. The Higgs mechanism is responsible for the generation of the <b>gauge</b> <b>boson</b> masses, and the fermion masses result from yukawa-type interactions with the Higgs field.|$|E
2500|$|Field {{theories}} {{had been}} used with great success in understanding the electromagnetic field and the strong force, but by around 1960 all attempts to create a gauge invariant theory for the weak force (and its combination with fundamental force electromagnetism, the electroweak interaction) had consistently failed, with gauge theories thereby starting to fall into disrepute as a result. The {{problem was that the}} symmetry requirements in gauge theory predicted that both electromagnetism's <b>gauge</b> <b>boson</b> (the photon) and the weak force's gauge bosons (W and Z) should have zero mass. Although the photon is indeed massless, experiments show that the weak force's bosons have mass. This meant that either gauge invariance was an incorrect approach, or something else [...] unknown [...] was giving these particles their mass, but all attempts to suggest a theory able to solve this problem just seemed to create new theoretical issues.|$|E
