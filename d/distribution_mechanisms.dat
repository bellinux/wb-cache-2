For the purpose of accurately evaluating the performance of the decentralized patch <b>distribution</b> <b>mechanism</b> and based on the exact SIPS model that accurately captures the average dynamics of the interaction between viruses and patches, a new virus-patch interacting model, which is known as the generic SIPS model, is proposed.

In particular, a set of criteria for the final extinction or/and long-term survival of viruses or/and patches are presented. Some conditions for the linear SIPS model to accurately capture the average dynamics of the virus-patch interaction are empirically found. As a consequence, the linear SIPS model can be adopted as a standard model for assessing the performance of the distributed patch <b>distribution</b> <b>mechanism,</b> provided the proper conditions are satisfied...|$|R

40|$|Annual minimum rate {{of return}} {{guarantees}} are analyzed together with rules for distribution of positive excess return, i. e. investment returns {{in excess of the}} guaranteed minimum return. Together with the level of the annual minimum {{rate of return}} guarantee both the customer's and the insurer's fractions of the positive excess return are determined so that the market value of the insurer's capital inflow (determined by the fraction of the positive excess return) equals the market value of the insurer's capital outflow (determined by the minimum rate of return guarantee) at the inception of the contract. The analysis is undertaken both with and without a surplus <b>distribution</b> <b>mechanism.</b> The surplus <b>distribution</b> <b>mechanism</b> works through a bonus account that serves as a buffer in the following sense: in ("bad") years when the investment returns are lower than the minimum rate of return guarantee, funds are transferred from the bonus account to the customer's account. In ("good") years when the investment returns are above the minimum rate of return guarantee, a part of the positive excess return is credited to the bonus account. In addition to characterizations of fair combinations of the level of the annual minimum rate of return guarantee and the sharing rules of the positive excess return, our analysis indicates that the presence of a surplus <b>distribution</b> <b>mechanism</b> allows the insurer to offer a much wider menu of contracts to the customer than without a surplus <b>distribution</b> <b>mechanism...</b>|$|R

In response, many countries have adopted policies which either force or encourage their citizens to have fewer children, and others have limited immigration. Considerable debate exists over what the ultimate carrying capacity of the planet may be; whether or not population growth containment policies are necessary; to what degree growth can safely occur thanks to increased economic and ecological efficiency; and how <b>distribution</b> <b>mechanisms</b> should accommodate demographic shifts. Evidence suggests that developed countries (such as Japan) suffer population implosion, and the population debate is strongly tied with discussions about the distribution of wealth.|$|E

50|$|The first axiom (FP1) Service is the {{fundamental}} basis of exchange {{is based on the}} previously introduced definition of service as the application of operant resources (primarily knowledge and skill) for the benefit of another actor. S-D logic argues that it is always fundamentally service, rather than goods, per se, that actors exchange as they strive to become better off. It is important to emphasize that this 'service' (singular), a process, {{should not be confused with}} 'services', (usually plural), usually intended to denote a unit of (intangible) output, which is associated with goods dominant (G-D) logic. The first axiom is at the heart of S-D logic, and thus foundational to the other FPs. For example, it implies that (1) goods are <b>distribution</b> <b>mechanisms</b> for service provision (FP3) and (2) all economies are service economies (FP5). It also follows that money, when it is involved in exchanges, represents rights to future service. In other words, money can be viewed as a placeholder for future service and can be understood as a form of indirect service exchange that often masks {{the fundamental}} basis of exchange (FP2).|$|E
