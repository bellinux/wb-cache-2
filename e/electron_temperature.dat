5|$|Plasma {{temperature}} is commonly measured in kelvins or electronvolts and is, informally, {{a measure of}} the thermal kinetic energy per particle. High temperatures are usually needed to sustain ionization, which is a defining feature of a plasma. The degree of plasma ionization is determined by the <b>electron</b> <b>temperature</b> relative to the ionization energy (and more weakly by the density), in a relationship called the Saha equation. At low temperatures, ions and electrons tend to recombine into bound states—atoms—and the plasma will eventually become a gas.|$|E
5|$|In {{most cases}} the {{electrons}} are close enough to thermal equilibrium that their temperature is relatively well-defined, even {{when there is a}} significant deviation from a Maxwellian energy distribution function, for example, due to UV radiation, energetic particles, or strong electric fields. Because of the large difference in mass, the electrons come to thermodynamic equilibrium amongst themselves much faster than they come into equilibrium with the ions or neutral atoms. For this reason, the ion temperature may be very different from (usually lower than) the <b>electron</b> <b>temperature.</b> This is especially common in weakly ionised technological plasmas, where the ions are often near the ambient temperature.|$|E
25|$|The Z-machine at Sandia National Laboratory, a z-pinch device, {{can produce}} ion {{energies}} {{of interest to}} hydrogen–boron reactions, up to 300 keV. Non-equilibrium plasmas usually have an <b>electron</b> <b>temperature</b> higher than their ion temperature, but the plasma in the Z machine has a special, reverted non-equilibrium state, in which the ion temperature is 100 times higher than <b>electron</b> <b>temperature.</b> These data represent a new research field, and indicate that Bremsstrahlung losses could be in fact lower than previously expected in such a design.|$|E

40|$|Presuming {{the total}} {{life-time}} for recombination of molecular ions with electrons remains constant at each altitude under different solar flare conditions, one can estimate the mean dissociative recombination coefficient and the <b>electron</b> <b>temperatures,</b> with {{a knowledge of}} the quiet time recombination coefficient and the production rate profiles under these conditions. To estimate the <b>electron</b> <b>temperatures,</b> the temperature dependence of the form (300 /T(e)) 1 / 2 for the electron loss coefficient has been assumed.

40|$|The <b>electron</b> <b>temperatures</b> of high-metallicity (12 +log(O/H) > 8. 2) HII regions {{have been}} studied. The {{empirical}} ff relations which express the nebular-to- auroral [OIII] line ratio Q_ 3,O (as {{well as the}} nebular-to-auroral [OII] line ratio Q_ 2,O, and the nebular-to-auroral [NII] line ratio Q_ 2,N) {{in terms of the}} nebular R_ 3 and R_ 2 line fluxes in spectra of high-metallicity HII regions are derived, and the <b>electron</b> <b>temperatures</b> t_ 3,O, t_ 2,O, and t_ 2,N in a number of extragalactic HII regions are also determined. Furthermore, the t_ 2 - t_ 3 diagram is discussed. It is found that there is a one-to-one correspondence between t_ 2 and t_ 3 <b>electron</b> <b>temperatures</b> for HII regions with a weak nebular R_ 3 lines (logR_ 0. 5) do not follow this relation. A discrepancy between t_ 2,N and t_ 2,O temperatures is found, being the t_ 2,N temperatures systematically lower than t_ 2,O ones. The differences are small at low <b>electron</b> <b>temperatures</b> and increases with increasing <b>electron</b> <b>temperatures</b> up to 10 % at t= 1. The uncertainties in the atomic data may be the cause of this discrepancy. Comment: 14 pages, 19 figures, accepted for publication in MNRA...|$|R
25|$|He {{introduced}} {{the concept of}} <b>electron</b> <b>temperature</b> and in 1924 invented the diagnostic method for measuring both temperature and density with an electrostatic probe, now called a Langmuir probe and commonly used in plasma physics. The current of a biased probe tip is measured {{as a function of}} bias voltage to determine the local plasma temperature and density. He also discovered atomic hydrogen, which he put to use by inventing the atomic hydrogen welding process; the first plasma weld ever made. Plasma welding has since been developed into gas tungsten arc welding.|$|E
25|$|The {{most common}} {{assumption}} {{is to compare}} power densities at the same pressure, choosing the ion temperature for each reaction to maximize power density, and with the <b>electron</b> <b>temperature</b> equal to the ion temperature. Although confinement schemes can be and sometimes are limited by other factors, most well-investigated schemes {{have some kind of}} pressure limit. Under these assumptions, the power density for p–11B is about 2,100 times smaller than that for D-T. Using cold electrons lowers the ratio to about 700. These numbers are another indication that aneutronic fusion power is not possible with mainline confinement concepts.|$|E
25|$|It is, however, not trivial {{to compare}} the power density {{produced}} by different fusion fuel cycles. The case most favorable to p–11B relative to D-T fuel is a (hypothetical) confinement device that only works well at ion temperatures above about 400 keV, in which the reaction rate parameter v> is equal for the two fuels, and that runs with low <b>electron</b> <b>temperature.</b> p–11B does not require as long a confinement time because the energy of its charged products is {{two and a half}} times higher than that for D-T. However, relaxing these assumptions, for example by considering hot electrons, by allowing the D-T reaction to run at a lower temperature or by including the energy of the neutrons in the calculation shifts the power density advantage to D-T.|$|E

500|$|A plasma is {{sometimes}} referred to as being [...] "hot" [...] if it is nearly fully ionised, or [...] "cold" [...] if only a small fraction (for example 1%) of the gas molecules are ionised, but other definitions of the terms [...] "hot plasma" [...] and [...] "cold plasma" [...] are common.

2500|$|However, {{since the}} mid 1990s {{a number of papers}} {{focusing}} on the formation of [...] highly functionalized plasma polymers have postulated a more significant role for cations, particularly where the plasma sheath is collosionless.

Multiple solutions are obtained for various combinations of base altitude ion <b>temperatures</b> and <b>electron</b> <b>temperatures,</b> such that the densities fit the Persoon et al.

40|$|A {{method is}} {{presented}} to derive <b>electron</b> <b>temperatures</b> and densities of planetary nebulae (PNe) simultaneously, using the observed hydrogen recombination spectrum, which includes continuum and line emission. By matching theoretical spectra to observed spectra around the Balmer jump at about 3646 A, we determine <b>electron</b> <b>temperatures</b> and densities for 48 Galactic PNe. The <b>electron</b> <b>temperatures</b> based on this method {{are found to be}} systematically lower than those derived from [O III] 4959 / 4363 and [O III] (88 μ+ 52 μ) / 4959 ratios.

These results suggest that temperature and density fluctuations are generally present within nebulae. In addition, He/H abundances of PNe are found to be positively correlated with the difference between T_e([O III]) and T_e(Bal), suggesting that He/H abundances might have been overestimated generally because of the possible existence of H-deficient knots.
