40|$|Although {{the growth}} in the scale and {{complexity}} is the response of High Performance Computing (HPC) systems like computational grids to the ever-increasing demand for high processing capacity, it also makes these systems considerable energy consumers. In fact, high energy consumption is the new challenge in front of performance improvement of HPC systems and thus power management is now a necessity for them. One of the major components that can have a great role in the power-saving process is the scheduler. In this paper, a new power-aware scheduling algorithm is proposed by incorporating the characteristics of both job and resource into the job mapping and ordering, and <b>frequency-setting</b> decision steps. In addition to the analytical study, the proposed scheduler has been evaluated based on results obtained from experiments in different resources heterogeneity levels and workload conditions. The results show the greater capability of the proposed scheduling algorithm in comparison with other related approaches...|$|E
40|$|A hybrid {{enhanced}} artificial {{bee colony}} algorithm (HEABC) is proposed for {{solving the problem}} of bus network design. The algorithm is intended to reduce the weighted sum {{of the number of}} transfers and the total travel time of the users through restructured bus routes and new frequencies without increased fleet sizes. The HEABC relies mainly on the enhanced artificial bee colony algorithm to determine the route structure, and the frequency is determined by the <b>frequency-setting</b> heuristic during the fitness evaluation. For an illustration of its performance, the HEABC was compared with a hybrid generic algorithm and a variant of the HEABC. The results indicated that the HEABC could produce better solutions than the other two algorithms could. Moreover, the HEABC could produce a design that was better than the existing design for maximum intermediate stops, total travel time, number of transfers, maximum headway, and total fuel cost. The design should be acceptable to the public and to bus operators...|$|E
40|$|Since {{transportation}} infrastructure projects have {{a lifetime of}} many decades, project developers must consider not only the current demand for the project but also the future demand. Future demand is of course uncertain and {{should be treated as}} such during project design. Previous research for Southwest Region University Transportation Center (Report 167556) explored the impact of uncertainty on roadway improvements and found neglecting uncertainty to lead to suboptimal network design decisions. This research is extended in the current work by considering not only motor vehicle traffic, but other modes as well. The first half of this report examines the problem of network flexibility in the face of uncertainty when constructing a potentially revenue-generating toll road project. Demand uncertainty and network design are considered by way of a bilevel stochastic recourse model. The results from a test network, for which a closed form solution is possible, indicate that the value of network flexibility directly depends on initial network conditions, variance in future travel demand, and toll pricing decisions. The second half of this report integrates Environmental Justice into the transit <b>frequency-setting</b> problem while considering uncertainty in travel demand from protected populations. The overarching purpose is to improve access via transit to basic amenities to: 1) reduce the disproportionate burden transit dependent populations’ experience; and 2...|$|E
40|$|There {{is little}} {{question}} that the commercial success of smartphones has substantially increased the volume of products utilizing Micro Electro Mechanical Systems (MEMS) technology, especially accelerometers, gyroscopes, bandpass filters, and microphones. The Internet of Things (IoT), a more recent driver for small, low power microsystems, seems poised to provide an even bigger market for these and other potential products based on MEMS. Given that the IoT will likely depend heavily on massive sensor networks using nodes for which battery replacement might not be practical, cost and power consumption become even more important. As already known for existing sensor networks, sleep/wake cycles will likely be instrumental to maintaining low sensor node power consumption in the IoT, and if so, then the clocks that must continuously run to synchronize sleep/wake events often become the bottlenecks to ultimate power consumption. On the communications side, narrowband RF channel-selecting front-end filters stand to greatly reduce receive power consumption by relaxing transistor circuit dynamic ranges. Both {{the accuracy of the}} clocks and ability of filters to achieve bandwidths small enough to select individual channels depend heavily on the accuracy and precision to which the <b>frequency-setting</b> devices they rely on are constructed. Inevitably, fabrication tolerances are finite, which means the ability to attain the highest performance relies on trimming or tuning. This dissertation focuses on methods by which voltage-controlled frequency tuning of capacitively-transduced micromechanical resonators make possible 1) an ultra-compact, low-power 32. 768 -kHz micromechanical clock oscillator; and 2) a high-order, small percent bandwidth coupled-resonator filter with minimal passband distortion. Currently, quartz crystal-based oscillators at 32. 768 kHz dominate the market because they offer the best combination of cost and performance. However, the physical dimensions of these oscillators are presently too large for future small form-factor electronic applications, such as ones that fit within credit cards. While there have been attempts to shrink quartz resonating elements, the increasingly difficult fabrication steps required to produce such devices raises manufacturing costs, thereby preventing widespread adoption (so far). In addition, quartz crystal motional resistance values typically increase as resonator dimensions shrink, which in many oscillator configurations raises power consumption. Unlike common quartz resonators, properly designed MEMS resonators benefit greatly from scaling in that reductions in lateral dimensions lead to a rapid decrease in motional resistance by a square law. The work described herein harnesses these scaling advantages to realize an oscillator much smaller than quartz-based oscillators with potential for much less power consumption. Specifically, this work uses aggressive lithography to achieve a capacitive-comb transduced micromechanical resonator occupying only 0. 0154 mm 2 of die area. Wire bonding this resonator to a custom sustaining amplifier and a supply voltage of only 1. 65 V then realizes a 32. 768 -kHz real-time clock oscillator more than 100 × smaller by area than miniaturized quartz crystal implementations and at least 4 × smaller than other MEMS-based approaches. The use of voltage-controlled tuning Oscillations sustains with only 2. 1 μW of power consumption. On the filter front, whether realized using quartz, FBAR, or capacitive-gap transduced MEMS resonator, mechanical filter responses are only as flat as the accuracy of their constituent resonator center frequencies. While narrowband micromechanical filters comprised of up to three mechanically coupled resonators have been demonstrated in the past, there exists a demand for bandpass filters with even sharper roll-offs and larger stopband rejections, and this requires higher order filters utilizing more than three coupled resonators. The work herein demonstrates filters comprised of four coupled resonators with bandwidths narrow enough to select individual channels. Before correction, filter passbands fresh out of the fab look nothing like their intended responses. Application of the automated passband correction protocol of this work, based on voltage-controlled frequency tuning, permits measurement of a 4 -resonator micromechanical filter with a 0. 1 % bandwidth commensurate with the needs of channel-selection (albeit at a low frequency) and an impressive 20 -dB shape factor of 1. 59, all with less than 3 dB of additional passband ripple (beyond the design ripple) ...|$|E
