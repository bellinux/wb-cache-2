Selcal (selective calling) controller, as <b>intermediate</b> <b>equipment</b> between selcal {{and radio}} station, is {{designed}} to achieve the software automation and remote control in aviation. The whole system adopts msp- 430 microcontroller as hardware core and C language as the method of software realization. This paper focuses on hardware connection and design to introduce the electrical design and software flow of selcal controller.. OBJECTIVE AND SIGNIFICANCE Selcal, also know as ground-air selective calling device, {{has been used by}} land station for selective calling of aircraft. Each aircraft has a unique selective calling code, when the selective calling device calls an aircraft, the selective call code, which consists of two connected audio pulse, shall be entered firstly. Two single tones that transmitted simultaneously are contained in each pulse. Selcal code will be transmitted by the shortwave radio station when the CALL push-button is pressed. When this code is received by the appropriate aircraft, the communication between radio station and aircraft is established. Therefore voice transmission connection between the ground and the aircraft can be achieved by using a handle. Fig. 1 Conventional model of selective calling syste...|$|E

40|$|A {{conceptual}} study {{is made to}} explore the feasibility of applying magnetized target fusion (MTF) to space propulsion for omniplanetary travel. Plasma-jet driven MTF not only is highly amenable to space propulsion, but also {{has a number of}} very attractive features for this application: 1) The pulsed fusion scheme provides in situ a very dense hydrogenous liner capable of moderating the neutrons, converting more than 97 % of the neutron energy into charged particle energy of the fusion plasma available for propulsion. 2) The fusion yield per pulse can be maintained at an attractively low level (< 1 GJ) despite a respectable gain in excess of 70. A compact, low-weight engine is the result. An engine with a jet power of 25 GW, a thrust of 66 kN, and a specific impulse of 77, 000 s, can be achieved with an overall engine mass of about 41 metric tons, with a specific power density of 605 kW/kg, and a specific thrust density of 1. 6 N/kg. The engine is rep-rated at 40 Hz to provide this power and thrust level. At a practical rep-rate limit of 200 Hz, the engine can deliver 128 GW jet power and 340 kN of thrust, at specific power and thrust density of 1, 141 kW/kg and 3 N/kg respectively. 3) It is possible to operate the magnetic nozzle as a magnetic flux compression generator in this scheme, while attaining a high nozzle efficiency of 80 % in converting the spherically radial momentum of the fusion plasma to an axial impulse. 4) A small fraction of the electrical energy generated from the flux compression is used directly to recharge the capacitor bank and other energy storage equipment, without the use of a highvoltage DC power supply. A separate electrical generator is not necessary. 5) Due to the simplicity of the electrical circuit and the components, involving mainly inductors, capacitors, and plasma guns, which are connected directly to each other without any <b>intermediate</b> <b>equipment,</b> a high rep-rate (with a maximum of 200 Hz) appears practicable. 6) All fusion related components are within {{the current state of the}} art for pulsed power technology. Experimental facilities with the required pulsed power capabilities already exist. 7) The scheme does not require prefabricated fuel target and liner hardware in any esoteric form or state. All necessary fuel and liner material are introduced into the engine in the form of ordinary matter in gaseous state at room temperature, greatly simplifying their handling on board. They are delivered into the fusion reaction chamber in a completely standoff manner...|$|E
40|$|The {{electric}} utility industry {{is in the}} midst of enormous changes in its market structure. Mile the generation sector moves towards a truly competitive market, the utilities' transmission and distribution functions are undergoing a transition to unbundled services and prices. These changes will affect the competition between distributed and central-station generation technology. Although the ultimate market potential for distributed generation may be significant, the market will be fragmented and heterogeneous. Distributed generation will likely succeed in some small and only a few medium-sized market segments, each narrowly defined by the segment's unique operating requirements. The largest potential market segment is for distributed generation technology with operational and economical characteristics suitable for peak shaving. Unbundling of utility costs and prices will make base-load and <b>intermediate</b> load <b>equipment,</b> such as fuel cells, significantly less attractive in the largest market segments unless capital costs fall substantially below $ 1, 000 per kilowatt. ...|$|R

Using a sample of 23 manufacturing sectors regrouped into three big industries in 29 Chinese provinces during 1988 - 94, it provides estimates of total factor productivity (TFP) growth by manufacturing sector and relates them to FDI inflows. The results show significant differences in TFP growth between manufacturing sectors dominated by foreign direct investment and those dominated by domestic investment in the consumer goods industry, confirming the usual literature findings on the positive impact of FDI on economic growth, while such clear-cut conclusion {{can not be made}} for the sectors in the <b>intermediate</b> and <b>equipment</b> industries.

Although its origins {{coincide}} with the earliest scientific inquiry, modern optics is an enabling technology that is applied to a variety of <b>intermediate</b> markets-telecommunication <b>equipment,</b> medical devices, scientific instruments, semiconductors, imaging and reproduction, defense and security, and retail logistics. One difficulty in studying emerging technology is the limitation of current industrial categories and patent classes. This article examines the geography of optical science inventions using a new methodology that can be applied to study other emerging industries. We rely on companies that self-identify as working on optics on the basis of their voluntary membership in the Optics Society of America. We investigate the inventive activity of these companies from 2004 to 2007 and identify a set of International Patent Classes that defines the emergent technology space in optical science. Using this definition, we then analyze all the organizations that are inventing in optical science. We find that inventive activity is geographically concentrated: patenting takes place in 240 urban areas, although 84 percent of the patents were invented in 30 metropolitan areas and almost 50 percent were attributed to 11 metropolitan areas. The article considers the organizations that are shaping the emerging technology and the consequences for geographic clusters. Our results reveal that the geographic distribution of inventive activity does not reflect the location of self-designated regional optics clusters in the United States but suggests a more nuanced understanding of the emergence of industries. We conclude by considering lessons about the development of clusters in emerging industries. Copyright (c) 2010 Clark University. ...|$|R

In contrast to studies that presume that international spillovers are incorporated in imports of <b>intermediate</b> and/or capital <b>equipment</b> goods, the present paper assumes that the principal channel of transmission of new technology is foreign direct investment. Three original proxies for international spillovers use information on patenting, the size and the origin of foreign ownership in the host country and the R&D expenditures in the country of origin. The results suggest that the nexus between industry's own R&D expenditures and the TFP growth is significant and positive, especially for the process-related R&D. Domestic interindustry spillovers of new technology have a larger effect on TFP than industry's own R&D expenditures.

To fabricate different fluidic devices just particular design is to be done by appropriate masks and etching protocols. All different fluidic devices will be fabricated with the same front end and back end process on the same equipment, no special steps or equipment are necessary. The front end device fabrication for the different fluidic products is based on a 4 " wafer process integrated in a 100 class cleanroom and yet organised in a platform conception. The main process modules are oxide, nitride, doubled sided lithography, dry etching, wafer bond technologies, KOH deep etching and sputtering.

In addition, as China moves up the value chain, both its imports and exports have become more sophisticated than in the past.

But given that level of recognition, relatively little has been done, that I am aware of, to encourage these two exploration communities to collaborate in a significant way. [Slide 4] I will return to NASA s plans and the parallels with Antarctic traverses in a moment, but I want to spend a moment to explain the objective of this workshop and the anticipated products. We have two full days set aside for this workshop. This first day will be taken up with a series of presentations prepared by individuals with experience that extends back as far as the late 1940 s and includes contemporary experience. The people presenting bring a variety of points of view, including not only U. S. but international, although most, if not all, have collaborated on international teams. The second day will consist of a series of small focused group interactions centered on those elements likely to be needed for traverse missions, such as mobility, habitation, and extravehicular activity (EVA, aka space suits). Our invited participants will be talking with people that specialize in these elements so that we can foster more direct interaction and exchange of experiences between these two exploration communities. After the workshop we will be preparing a report documenting these presentations and the essence of the focused interactions...|$|R
