40|$|The {{separation}} of North Sulawesi and Gorontalo into two provinces in 2001 complicated {{the issue of}} making regional autonomy work for northern Sulawesi, a region far removed from Indonesia's centre of power. Although the region had come through the economic crisis relatively well, the over-reliance on coconuts {{and the lack of}} a focus for dynamic development remained a challenge. Tourism, mining and services were the most dynamic sectors but, for different reasons, none of these sectors can be relied on for steady long-term growth. With the selection of the corridor from Manado to Bitung as one of Indonesia's 13 <b>integrated</b> economic <b>development</b> <b>zones</b> (Kapet), and given the new North Sulawesi province's potential role as a 'gateway' to Northeast Asia, the longer-term prospects for this province are brighter than those of Gorontalo. Nevertheless, capitalising on North Sulawesi's potential remains a formidable challenge. ...|$|R
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to analyze the {{regional}} typology, the leading sectors and the potential of fish resources in Biak Kapet (<b>Integrated</b> Economic <b>Development</b> <b>Zone).</b> The tools of analysis used were Klassen Typology, LQ/SSA/Overlay methods and Maximum Sustainable Yield (MSY). Results of this study show that Biak Kapet can be classified as a less developed region on the aspect of economic growth and income per capita. However, with regard to human development index (HDI) and economic growth, it occurs to be fast growing except Waropen Regency (Kabupaten). Waropen and Supiori Regencies have agriculture, industry, construction, and services as the leading sectors while Nabire, Yapen and Biak Numfor Islands have competitive and comparative sectors. Regional development of the Kapet should be based on the local potential of each subregion. So, every regency in the Kapet should develop its local potential supported by the land carrying capacity. The highest level of land carrying capacity for agriculture sector is in Nabire Regency, and the lowest is in Supiori. In addition to resources that have been being utilized by every regency in Biak Kapet, there are also common pool resources (CPRs) not yet developed integratively. It is the sea, which has the potential of fish resources although with fluctuating levels of maximum sustainable yield. Nevertheless, the potential can be relied upon to improve economic growth and income per capita of every subregion in Biak Kapet...|$|R
40|$|The thesis {{which appears}} here {{is excerpted from}} the book <b>Integrated</b> Coastal <b>Zone</b> <b>Development</b> via Building with Nature® (Waterman 2008 a, 2008 b). Although this {{approach}} was first applied in the Netherlands, it has gradually been recognized worldwide as a harmonious means of creating land areas for living, working, tourism & recreation, and infrastructure, whilst ensuring the preservation or expansion of valuable environmental resources, nature and landscape. In addition, climate change resulting in sea-level rise, more frequent and intense storm-surges are taken in to account, as well as land subsidence and salt water intrusion. The most extensive applications {{are found in the}} Netherlands, but remarkable examples also exist or are in progress bordering densely populated coastal and delta areas elsewhere in Europe, Africa, the Middle East, Far East, the Americas, Australia, as well as numerous waterfront developments on lakes, rivers and canals. With approximately 80 percent of the largest population centres in the world situated on coasts and deltas, the need for sound, <b>integrated</b> coastal <b>zone</b> <b>development</b> via building with nature” is urgent and appropriate. The flexible integration of land-in-water and of water-in-land, using materials and forces & interactions present in nature is an environmentally friendly and economically advantageous system which is gaining more and more acceptance worldwide. In implementing this method a new flexible dynamic equilibrium coastline is created using sand from the sea, consisting of a new primary range of dunes with a new beach in front and with a minimum of solid sea-wall elements. The emphasis is no longer on inflexible solid bulwarks against the sea, like dams & dykes, but instead on flexible soft structures in harmony with the sea, like dunes & beaches.

40|$|The {{practice}} of <b>development</b> <b>zones</b> has expanded worldwide, yet scholarship persistently disagrees {{on the role}} that <b>development</b> <b>zones</b> play in local economic development. With its focus on China, this study contributes to the discussion by exploring the effects of <b>development</b> <b>zones</b> on the economic development of host regions, using both macro-level (all national-level <b>development</b> <b>zones)</b> and meso-level (county- and district-level <b>development</b> <b>zones</b> in Guangdong Province) analyses. Our data analyses of the macro-level reveal that <b>development</b> <b>zones,</b> even though positive in developed regions, do not contribute to economic growth in proportion to their share of land in host cities on the whole. The result is confirmed by the meso-level data analysis that indicates that county- and district-level <b>development</b> <b>zones</b> in Guangdong Province, a developed region in southern China, imposed positive effects on local economies.

40|$|<b>Development</b> <b>zones,</b> born in {{the course}} of China’s {{economic}} transition, are the carriers of both the favorable institutions and the foreign advanced technology. They are now at the stage of transferring from the concentration of firms to being industrial clusters. Based on data of firms in <b>development</b> <b>zones</b> along the Yangtze River obtained through micro-level investigation, this paper studies the effects of local factors special to <b>development</b> <b>zones</b> as well as the influence of technology promotion on the economic performance of those firms “locating” in <b>development</b> <b>zones,</b> and thus discloses the nature of firms concentrating into <b>development</b> <b>zones</b> and their trend of transferring into industrial clusters. The empirical study suggests that firms locating on <b>development</b> <b>zones</b> mainly aim at obtaining “policy rents”, which results in that firms concentrating in <b>development</b> <b>zones</b> do not possess the industrial cluster effect in the general sense: the benefits of closing to the supply or demand market. However, although firms in a develop zone do not necessarily concentrate with related firms in space, their technology and market activities are inevitably to produce relations with factors such as local governments and related industrial elements and thus affect the economic performance of firms and nurture the clustering effects of <b>development</b> <b>zones.</b> Therefore, as “policy rents” fade away due to industry transfer and adjustment of favorable economic policies, the key to keep <b>development</b> <b>zones</b> sustainable is to enhance their clustering effects. ...|$|R

40|$|Rapid {{economic}} globalization presents major {{challenges to}} the sustainable development of ‘development zones' in many countries. <b>Development</b> <b>zones</b> in China evolved from the concept of Export Processing Zones (EPZs) in the western world.

With the changing global and national circumstances, spatial, economic and social transformations are taking place in these <b>development</b> <b>zones.</b> Given the vast number of <b>development</b> <b>zones</b> in China, the successful integration of these <b>development</b> <b>zones</b> into the regional and urban contexts will have great implications on {{the economic and social}} development of China.
