The mission plan for the second attack was nearly identical to that of the Hiroshima mission, with two B-29s flying an hour ahead as weather scouts and two additional B-29s in Sweeney's flight for instrumentation and photographic support of the mission. Sweeney took off with his weapon already armed but with the <b>electrical</b> <b>safety</b> plugs still engaged.|$|E

5|$|On {{the morning}} of 9 August 1945, a second B-29 (Bockscar), piloted by the 393d Bombardment Squadron's commander, Major Charles W. Sweeney, lifted off with Fat Man on board. This time, Ashworth served as weaponeer and Kokura was the primary target. Sweeney took off with the weapon already armed but with the <b>electrical</b> <b>safety</b> plugs still engaged. When they reached Kokura, they found cloud cover had {{obscured}} the city, prohibiting the visual attack required by orders. After three runs over the city, and with fuel running low, they headed for the secondary target, Nagasaki. Ashworth decided that a radar approach would be used if the target was obscured, but a last-minute break in the clouds over Nagasaki allowed a visual approach as ordered. The Fat Man was dropped over the city's industrial valley midway between the Mitsubishi Steel and Arms Works {{in the south and}} the Mitsubishi-Urakami Ordnance Works in the north. The resulting explosion had a blast yield equivalent to 21 kilotons of TNT, roughly the same as the Trinity blast, but was confined to the Urakami Valley, and a major portion of the city was protected by the intervening hills, resulting in the destruction of about 44% of the city. The bombing also crippled the city's industrial production extensively and killed 23,200–28,200 Japanese industrial workers and 150 Japanese soldiers. Overall, an estimated 35,000–40,000 people were killed and 60,000 injured.|$|E

25|$|In 1906, the Factory and Workshop Act 1901 was {{amended to}} include laundries, {{and under the}} Labour Exchanges Act 1909 labour exchanges were set up {{in order to help}} {{unemployed}} people find work, by providing centres where a large number of employers and the unemployed could post jobs and apply for them respectively. By February 1910, eighty-three labour exchanges were open, and proved to be invaluable in helping people find employment. In 1913 these labour exchanges were putting around 3000 people into a job each day. Another measure taken was the 1909 Development Fund, which was an attempt to provide work in times of Depression. This fund was devoted to increasing employment opportunities through measures such as afforestation and the provision of smallholdings in the countryside. In addition, the government encouraged the adoption of Fair Wages contracts by local authorities. In 1908, special regulations were made for <b>electrical</b> <b>safety.</b>|$|E

The weapon was already armed, but with the green <b>electrical</b> <b>safety</b> plugs still engaged.

This fuel would still have to be carried all the way to Japan and back, consuming still more fuel. Replacing the pump would take hours; moving the Fat Man to another aircraft might take just as long and was dangerous as well, as the bomb was live. 509th Composite Group Commander Colonel Paul Tibbets and Sweeney therefore elected to have Bockscar continue the mission.|$|E

2500|$|In New York City, a {{woman named}} Jodie S.

Lane incident had caused stray voltage to be a term that is well recognized by the public. At that point, the regulator used stray voltage for any “"voltage conditions on electric facilities that should not ordinarily exist. These conditions may be due to one or more factors, including, but not limited to, damaged cables, deteriorated, frayed or missing insulation, improper maintenance, or improper installation."

2500|$|Plugs {{which do}} not meet BS 1363 often {{find their way into}} the UK. Some of these are legal in the country they are {{manufactured}} in, but do not meet BS 1363 - these can be brought into the UK by unsuspecting travellers, or people purchasing electrical goods online. They can also be purchased through many UK electrical component distributors. There are also counterfeit plugs which appear to meet the standards (and are marked as such) but do not in fact comply. Legislation was introduced, with the last revision in 1994, to require plugs sold to meet the technical standard. [...] Counterfeit products are regularly seized when found, to enforce the safety standards and to protect the approval marks and trademarks of imitated manufacturers. [...] The pressure group PlugSafe reported in March 2014 that since August 2011 [...] "thousands" [...] of listings of products including illegal plugs had been removed from the UK websites ebay.co.uk and amazon.co.uk.

2500|$|Safety {{regulations}} {{should have}} prevented the Zuni rocket from firing. A triple ejector rack (TER) <b>electrical</b> <b>safety</b> pin prevented any electrical signal from reaching the rockets, but it was known that high winds could sometimes catch the attached tags and blow them free. The backup was the [...] "pigtail" [...] connection of the electrical wiring to the rockets pod. Regulations required they be connected only when the aircraft {{was attached to the}} catapult and ready to launch. The Navy investigation found that four weeks before the fire, Forrestals Weapons Coordination Board had a meeting to discuss the possible problem of a faulty pigtail delaying a mission while the aircraft was removed from the launcher. The board ruled that, in the future, the crew could ignore protocol and connect the pigtails while the aircraft were still queued. Though never made official, the crew immediately acted on the ruling. The inquiry found that the TER pin was likely blown free while the pigtail was connected, and that the missile fired due to a power surge when the pilot transferred his systems from external to internal power. This incident also led the U.S. Navy to implement safety reviews for weapons systems going on board ships (whether for use or for shipping). Today, this evaluation still exists as the Weapon System Explosives Safety Review Board.|$|E
