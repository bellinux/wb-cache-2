6000|$|When our born solitary, wearied of Paris {{and half}} {{afraid of the}} too {{friendly}} importunity of Geneva, at length determined to accept Madame d'Epinay's offer of the Hermitage on conditions which left him an entire sentiment of independence of movement and freedom from all sense of pecuniary obligation, he was immediately exposed to a very copious torrent of pleasantry and remonstrance from the highly social circle who met round D'Holbach's dinner-table. They deemed it sheer midsummer madness, or even a sign of secret depravity, to quit their cheerful world for the dismal solitude of woods and fields. [...] "Only the bad man is alone," [...] wrote Diderot in words which Rousseau kept resentfully in his memory {{as long as he}} lived. The {{men and women of the}} eighteenth century had no comprehension of solitude, the strength which it may impart to the vigorous, the poetic graces which it may shed about the life of those who are less than vigorous; and what they did not comprehend, they dreaded and abhorred, and thought monstrous in the one man who did comprehend it. They were all of the mind of Socrates when he said to Phædrus, [...] "Knowledge is what I love, and the men who dwell in the town are my teachers, not trees and landscape."[252] Sarcasms fell on him like hail, and the prophecies usual in cases where a stray soul does not share the common tastes of the herd. He would never be able to live without the incense and the amusements of the town; he would be back in a fortnight; he would throw up the whole enterprise within three months.[253] Amid a shower of such words, springing from men's perverse blindness to the binding propriety of keeping all propositions as to what is the best way of living in respect of place, hours, companionship, strictly relative to each individual case, Rousseau stubbornly shook the dust of the city from off his feet, and sought new life away from the stridulous hum of men. Perhaps we are better pleased to think of the unwearied Diderot spending laborious days in factories and quarries and workshops and forges, while friendly toilers patiently explained to him the structure of stocking looms and velvet looms, the processes of metal-casting and wire-drawing and slate-cutting, and all the other countless arts and ingenuities of fabrication, which he afterwards reproduced to a wondering age in his spacious and magnificent repertory of human thought, knowledge, and practical achievement. And it is yet more elevating to us to think of the true stoic, the great high-souled Turgot, setting forth a little later to discharge beneficent duty in the <b>hard</b> <b>field</b> of his distant Limousin commissionership, enduring many things and toiling late and early for long years, that the burden of others might be lighter, and the welfare of the land more assured. But there are many paths for many men, and if only magnanimous self-denial has the power of inspiration, and can move us with the deep thrill of the heroic, yet every truthful protest, even of excessive personality, against the gregarious trifling of life in the social groove, has a side which it is not ill for us to consider, and perhaps for some men and women in every generation to seek to imitate.|$|E

5000|$|In 1838 {{with the}} {{abolition}} of slavery at its onset, the British {{were in the process of}} transporting a million Indians out of India and into the Caribbean to take the place of the African slaves in indenture-ship. For women specifically, looking for what they believed to be a better life in the colonies, were sought after and recruited at a much higher rate than men due to the high population of men already in the colonies. However women were required to prove their status as a single and eligible to emigrate, as married women could not leave without their husbands. Many women seeking escape from abusive relationships were willing to take that chance. The Indian Immigration Act of 1883 was passed to prevent women from attempting to exit India as widowed or single in order to escape. [...] Arrival in the colonies brought unexpected conditions of poverty, homelessness, and little to no food as the high numbers of emigrants overwhelmed the small villages and flooded the labor market. Many were forced into signing labor contracts that exposed them to the <b>hard</b> <b>field</b> labor on the plantation. Additionally, on arrival to the plantation, single women were 'assigned' a man as they were not allowed to live alone.  The subtle difference between slavery and indenture-ship is best seen here as women were still subjected to the control of the plantation owners as well as their newly assigned 'partner'.  Their status was closer to chattel property than human being.|$|E

In {{order to determine the}} varying topography of the karstifiable bedrock we carried out multielectrode measurements. Due to the <b>hard</b> <b>field</b> conditions, the bedrock depth could not be detected. The resistivity anomalies in some places had a seasonal variation (low-resistivity in springtime, high-resistivity in the end of summer); therefore we interpreted the springtime resistivity lows as indicators of locations with high water content, that is as high porosity, saturated with water. At the same time, when pushing the current- and potential electrodes into the ground, we discovered a regularity in the areal distribution of the soil's rock debris content. Therefore we carried out a systematic electrode-pricking experiment, and categorized the soil's "toughness" corresponding to soft penetration, scratching or blockage within the upper 30 cm. We have found a close relationship between the locations of resistivity- and the soil's toughness extremes. From some epikarstic features we think that high "pricking probe" values indicate smaller depths of the bedrock. The corresponding (springtime) resistivity minima may indirectly indicate more or less collapsed horsts of the carbonate rock...|$|E

40|$|Od 1892. do 1954. više od 12 milijuna imigranata 1 ušlo je u Sjedinjene Američke Države kroz poznata američka vrata, otok Ellis. Siromaštvo, glad, težak rad na polju i političke opresije natjerali su mnogo Hrvata da potraže bolji život u Americi. Većinom su bili vrlo mladi, prosjek godina tih prvih imigranata nije bio veći od 22. Uglavnom su bili muškarci samci, i zajedno su, sa svim ostalim putnicima iz potpalublja, prolazili brze medicinske preglede, tzv. "preglede u šest sekundi", za kojih su provjeravani simptomi zaraznih bolesti, mogućih psiholoških poremećaja, "ludila", "slaboumnosti" ili nekih fizičkih nedostataka. Ovaj članak pokušava propitati kako su takvi segregacijski postupci koji su odmah na ulasku u novi svijet definirali Hrvate kao potencijalno nezdrave, lude ili nesposobne, utjecali na stvaranje i razvoj hrvatske dijaspore u sjevernoj Americi i pridonijeli njihovu statusu dijasporske zajednice koja je sačuvala svoj kulturni identitet. From 1892 to 1954 {{more than}} 12 million {{immigrants}} entered the United States through its famous gateway, Ellis Island. They were processed through immigration procedure and majority of them, from that period, {{were allowed to}} enter the US and become the citizens of their choice. Poverty, scarcity and <b>hard</b> <b>field</b> labour forced many Croats to seek better life in America. Almost four millions of them went through the Ellis Island in the period from 1880 to 1930. Very young, of average age not more than 22, most of them single males, together with all other steerage passengers, underwent the quick medical examinations, "six seconds physicals" through which they were checked for signs of infectious diseases, insanity, "feeblemindedness" of physical defects. To avoid the trap of being too easily critical 100 years after Ellis Island happenings, {{it has to be}} said that they were a practical solution to immigration admission. The number of people entering the US through Ellis Island could reach 5000 up to 11000 people per day during America 2 ̆ 7 s peak immigration years from 1890 - 1924. However, Ellis Island practices legitimatized and deepened the division between the ethnically desirable (North and Western Europe immigrants) and less desirable (South-Eastern Europe and Asia). Furthermore, they provided a mass demonstration of power and political practices, which used health as an instrument of separation between those who were eligible to become the members of a politically stable, healthy labour force, and those who were not. This paper tries to examine in what way did such "segregatory" practices, which already {{at the entrance to the}} New World, defined Croats and other immigrants as possibly unhealthy, insane or inapt, influence the formation of Croatian Diaspora in North America as a culturally distinct ethnic group. It also raises the question as to how will the newly emerging medical borders affect notions of ethnicity and the ways in which dispersed/displaced peoples construct their identities in the time of "global ethnoscapes" (Appadurai) The fact that this first "legalized" segregation on the basis of a six-second medical examination was going on under the shadow of the Statue of Liberty, shows to what extent it was assumed as "scientifically" reasonable and politically correct, and explains the existence of its current practices of creating medical borders.

40|$|In this work, the {{suitability}} of amorphous semiconductors as <b>hard</b> <b>field</b> optical sensors for application in optical process tomography (OPT) has been established. Two amorphous semiconductors were selected for the study, these being amorphous arsenic triselenide (a-As 2 Se 3) and hydrogenated amorphous silicon (a-Si:H). The a-As 2 Se 3 device was a single layered structure of 60 |Um thickness fabricated upon a 2 mm thick cylindrical aluminium substrate. The a-Si:H device was a multi-layered structure of 27. 1 fim overall thickness fabricated upon a 4 mm thick cylindrical aluminium substrate. 20 mm 2 samples were cut from the cylinders, their surface being left free for a xerographic investigation. For a tomographic investigation, semitransparent gold (Au) contacts were sputtered {{onto the surface of}} the devices to produce single contacts or contact arrays. The study comprised of the two fields of xerography and tomography. The xerographic study comprised of the measurement of such parameters as charge acceptance, dark decay, residual potential, and photoinduced discharge. The research project has concurred with other workers in that the dark discharge mechanism in a-As 2 Se 3 proceeds via a xerographic depletion discharge process, and a Poole-Frenkel type emission in a-Si:H. The tomographic investigation involved the study of such parameters as detectivity, responsivity, steady state photocurrent, and photoinduced fatigue. Detectivity has found to be dependant upon the magnitude of applied electric field and level of incident irradiance. Irradiance in the order of 3. 45 mW/cm 2 to 9. 57 mW/cm 2 for a- fj f As 2 Se 3 and 5. 31 mW/cm to 28. 32 mW/cm for a-Si:H was required in order to produce a clean and repeatable photogenerated current pulse over the range of electric fields specified (0. 66 xl 05 V/cm to 1. 66 xl 05 V/cm). The production of steady state current has found to be dependant upon the magnitude of electric field, the level of irradiance, and the illumination period. Irradiance of 319 mW/cm 2 to 1. 46 W/cm 2 with an illumination period of 520 ns was required to produce steady state photocurrent in a-As 2 Se 3, and 693 mW/cm 2 to 2. 62 W/cm 2 with an illumination period of 880 ns for a-Si:H. A linear relationship between electric field and responsivity has been observed in both materials over a range of irradiance of 3. 45 mW/cm 2 to 9. 57 mW/cm 2. Responsivity in the order of 87. 86 |LiAAV to 145. 19 |iA/W for a-As 2 Se 3 and 14. 19 (iAAV to 103. 81) J,AAV for a-Si:H has been demonstrated. An investigation as to the effects of photoinduced fatigue in both a-As 2 Se 3 and a-Si:H has been carried out by the application of pulsed visible light of various flash repetition rate (FRR) under a constant high electric field over a 30 minute illumination period. It has been shown that the rate of fatigue is dependant upon the material, time, electric field, light intensity, and FRR. A maximum operating speed of 20 Hz has been determined for a-As 2 Se 3 and lOOHz for a-Si:H. The maximum operating speed of 20 Hz for a-As 2 Se 3 was deemed unsuitable for OPT application and the a-As 2 Se 3 material was eliminated from further tomographic investigation.
