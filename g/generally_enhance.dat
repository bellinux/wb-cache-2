50|$|This {{aspect of}} Raman {{spectroscopy}} becomes especially useful for large biomolecules with chromophores embedded in their structure. In such chromophores, the charge-transfer (CT) transitions {{of the metal}} complex <b>generally</b> <b>enhance</b> metal-ligand stretching modes, {{as well as some}} of modes associated with the ligands alone. Hence, in a biomolecule such as haemoglobin, tuning the laser to near the charge-transfer electronic transition of the iron center results in a spectrum reflecting only the stretching and bending modes associated with the tetrapyrrole-iron group. Consequently, in a molecule with thousands of vibrational modes, RR spectroscopy allows us to look at relatively few vibrational modes at a time. This reduces the complexity of the spectrum and allows for easier identification of an unknown protein. Also, if a protein has more than one chromophore, different chromophores can be studied individually if their CT bands differ in energy. In addition to identifying compounds, RR spectroscopy can also supply structural identification about chromophores in some cases.|$|E
5000|$|However, in [...] "The Green National Product," [...] Clifford Cobb and John Cobb {{argue that}} the Measure of Economic Welfare failed to {{encompass}} the depletion of natural capital. [...] In 1989, Herman Daly, John Cobb, and Clifford Cobb created {{what is known as}} the Index of Sustainable Economic Welfare (ISEW). This new measurement of welfare was created in the hopes that it would replace the flawed GNP. Herman Daly stated that the key flaw of the traditional GNP was that it ignored core accounting principles of business where all revenues and expenses are allocated to income. [...] ISEW called for ecological and economic sustainability to coincide since the economy is ultimately dependent on the natural resources that the earth provides. [...] Rather than the original GNP, ISEW takes into account costs that are naturally unsustainable. By creating ISEW, they wanted to expand the current national product so that individuals, businesses, and governments could take actions that will <b>generally</b> <b>enhance</b> welfare, rather than merely enhancing the traditional GNP.|$|E

40|$|This study {{explores the}} tenability {{of the idea}} that a general {{tendency}} to confirm rather than to falsify personal beliefs (i. e., belief bias) is responsible for the general refractoriness of dysfunctional convictions that play a role in psychopathology. Therefore, we investigated the relationship between a <b>generally</b> <b>enhanced</b> belief bias and the severity of self-reported psychopathological symptoms in a non-clinical sample. Participants (N = 200) solved a series of linear syllogisms concerning neutral themes. They were asked to judge the syllogisms' logical validity, without taking the believability of the syllogisms into account. Participants performed relatively poor (i. e., they made more errors and displayed longer response latencies) when there was a mismatch between the logical validity and believability of the syllogisms (i. e., a general belief bias). However, there was no linear association between the severity of the general belief bias and the severity of psychopathological complaints. Thus, the present study lends no support to the idea that a <b>generally</b> <b>enhanced</b> tendency to confirm rather than to falsify prior beliefs is a diathesis for the development of psychopathology...|$|R

5000|$|By {{virtue of}} {{employing}} random selection, citizens’ assemblies allow for increased cognitive diversity, otherwise {{understood as a}} diversity of problem-solving methods or ways of seeing and interpreting the world. The random selection of citizens’ assemblies allows for extensive and statistically representative cognitive diversity unlike elected representatives, who are typically characterized by uniform problem-solving methods. In a cognitively diverse setting, the people present are not the best-performing or most skilled agents, which citizens’ assemblies are often criticized for. Despite this concern, studies have been published, which contend that cognitively diverse groups produce better results than cognitively homogenous groups. A study conducted by Lu Hong and Scott Page posits that cognitive diversity is {{an important element of}} effective problem solving. They find in their research that when they selected two problem-solving teams from a diverse population of intelligent agents, the team of randomly selected agents outperformed the team of the [...] "best-performing" [...] agents. Deliberation amongst a diverse group can produce better results since unique perspectives and interpretations <b>generally</b> <b>enhance</b> analysis of an issue. These results demonstrate that when selecting problem-solving groups, it may be more important to maximize cognitive diversity over individual competence. For example, scholar Helene Landemore argues that the random selection of representatives rather than election results in increased efficacy, diversity and inclusivity. In fact, John Stuart Mill famously argued that governing assemblies should be a “fair sample of every grade of intellect among the people” over “a selection of the greatest political minds.” ...|$|E
