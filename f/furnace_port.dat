40|$|Three {{examples}} of plant landscape shaping, {{carried out by}} Iron Age populations living in different geographical areas, are presented. The examples differ in population type (Garamantes, Etruscans, and Romans), archaeological context (settlement, necropolis, <b>furnace,</b> <b>port),</b> and area of plant exploitation (respectively, Fezzan – Libyan Sahara and Tuscany, Latium – central Italy). The leitmotiv of the three parallel investigations highlighted that humans induced clear changes in plant cover modifying the quantitative ratio among native elements and spreading the plants of economic interest even outside of their natural habitats. Micro- and macroremain analyses once more enhanced that landscape reconstruction depends on both wild and cultivated plants, and that the cultural plant landscape is composed of a complex mixture of indigenous and exotic elements. Archaeobotany results in great help in reviewing ancient prejudices, rewriting history in a modern ecological view, also discovering a different role in the landscape evolution of past civilizations. In this light, the Garamantes deeply transformed the oases in agrarian producer sites, and the Etruscans, {{in the area of}} the Gulf of Follonica, modified the previous forest vegetation, probably enhancing the xeric features. The Romans, believed as the main creators of the environmental changes in the Mediterranean basin, surprisingly did not produce consistent plant changes {{in the area of the}} Tiber delta, in the surroundings of the imperial port of Rome, during the first century AD...|$|E
40|$|Online Realtime Dynamic Analysis of the Blast Furnace Process {{has been}} {{investigated}} to include the concurrent application of Aerodynamics, Thermodynamics and Metallurgical fundamentals applied to the Iron Formation Processes. The {{aim of this study}} is to establish a Process Control System to control the Instantaneous Iron Production Rate for the Blast Furnace. The system depends upon the ability to continuously monitor, control, and locate the various Iron forming reactions throughout the Process. Three methods for control are outlined beginning with the simple Isotherm based version through to the more refined method with five classes of identification of the Zone Volume Interface boundaries based on streamline Gas and Particulate knowledge. Experiments using Instrumented Mt. Newman Iron Ore Particles subjected to heating patterns which simulate Burden descent Streamline flow paths, provide a method of classification of the various Blast Furnace Zone Volumes and Iron Production Rates in terms of the Iron forming reactions that occur in the various Zone types. Specially designed equipment to provide a controlled environment to simulate Blast Furnace conditions also allowed Visual observations and Video recordings of Instrumented Iron Ore Particles to be made as they were reduced to Liquid Iron. These Visual observations added a new dimension to the Aerodynamic and Metallurgical Knowledge of the Process, namely the suddenness with which the Liquidus mechanisms occur in only a few seconds, and secondly the accompaning Volumetric change effects that also occur. The importance of these Process mechanisms were not previously appreciated or even evident using Instrumented recording methods. Using a combination of Visual observations, Isotherm recordings and Quenched sample Ore Metalography, a number of Aerodynamic, Thermodynamic, and Metallurgical concept were developed and then used to more accurately designate the various Zone Volume Boundaries. The concept of a Flame Front Reduction Characteristic (Ffrench Zone) was the first Visualised Reaction mechanism developed in line with the Aerodynamic viewpoint of the reaction observations applied to a uniformly distributed packed bed, as for example in a Sintering bed. This Ffrench zone concept was further refined by applying concurrently Aerodynamic and Thermodynamic Knowledge to the Ore Layers of the Burden. This introduced the concept of the Ore Layer Stratification effects where reactions occur on individual particles in and around the Iron Liquidus Isotherms (where liquid Iron first forms) as particles are affected by the characteristic flow streamline contours resulting from the preferential gaseous flow pathways through the alternate burden layers of Coke and Ore. Additionally, Individual particle Stratification effects also apply within the proximity of each particle where the Iron Liquidus Isotherm condition exists. The Rate of available Heat also determines the Metallurgical nature of the reactions that occur. A further gaseous flow induced effect results from the interparticle Gas jetting impingement (Gas Lithology) onto the successive particles and produces localised forced reactions on the particle surface from the concentrated Heat in the jet stream. These combined effects provide key dynamic components for a more accurate location of Zone interface boundaries and Iron formation mechanisms, and all of which contribute to providing more accurate knowledge for Online Realtime Process Control and Process Simulation Systems. Instantaneous Iron Production Rate for the Blast Furnace Process trialed at No. 5 Blast <b>Furnace</b> <b>Port</b> Kembla was visualised initially in relation to zone volumes classified by 2 ̆ 2 S 2 ̆ 2 Curve direct reduction zone profiles based on the Ffrench Zone concept. Various other Blast Furnace Process Control Systems were also developed to take advantage of the technological advancement that occurred during the period of this study including Online Operator Visualisation and programming concepts. Inherent technological shortcomings of these systems led to the development of the Knowledge based Visualisation concept design which is considered necessary to concurrently utilise the voluminous Streamline based Process knowledge for Online Realtime Process Control use. Future Process control systems providing Online Realtime Process Control are envisaged as using streamline based analogue Instrumentation sensors,with neural data array processing of gas and Particulate streamline flow concepts to provide the desired operation of the Blast Furnace Process, thus yielding the quality and quantity of saleable product required. A theoretical internal fluid motion physical property designated Harmonology was developed as a fundamental Process Unit Dynamic mechanism responsible for 2 ̆ 2 creating 2 ̆ 2 matter motion of fluids at the atomic level, and subsequently are manifested as Visible flow patterns. This concept evolved as a result of concurrently reconciling the matter migration at high temperature as observed in Metalography studies of Iron Ore reduced samples when internal voids are formed (Newman Effervescent Voids). In future systems, Process Visualisation in terms of 2 ̆ 2 Aurora 2 ̆ 2 displays modelled on human visual and Knowledge concepts (Humanoids) are envisaged to provide 2 ̆ 2 multi-personality 2 ̆ 2 dynamic insights of the 2 ̆ 2 moods 2 ̆ 2 of the Process to meet the challenge of providing concurrent knowledge Visualisation for the indispensable human operator comprehension and mood 2 ̆ 2 matching 2 ̆ 2 for Online Process Control purposes. The Humanoid Visualisation incorporates complementary mood and comprehension 2 ̆ 2 matching 2 ̆ 2 personality traits designed to maintain Human involvement and motivation with the dynamic behaviour of the Visualisation Aurora Imagery. In an overall sense theoretical Process considerations suggest that Particulate matter can inherently be more accurately blended and flow rate controlled as a single continuous flow stream of Powder. Subsequently this powder is Transformed to Liquid Product in a Blended Powder Direct Reduction Transformer. The single most important outcome of this thesis was the reinforcement of the concept that concurrency of knowledge and knowledge crosspollination is needed in a dynamic reasoning and visualised fashion. This approach is considered necessary to both understand, and online predictively control the quantity and quality of the Process and its Production Products in terms of the raw materials from which they are produced...|$|E

This technology, known as oxygen-enriched air staging (OEAS), has been demonstrated, and is now being commercialized, for endport container glass furnaces. A 17 -month development program has been established with specific objectives to: (1) acquire baseline operating data on the host sideport furnace in Vernon, California, (2) evaluate secondary oxidant injection strategies based on earlier endport furnace results and through modeling of a single port pair, (3) retrofit and test one port pair (the test <b>furnace</b> has six <b>port</b> pairs) with a flexible OEAS system, and select the optimal system configuration, (4) use the results from tests with one port pair to design, retrofit, and test OEAS on the entire <b>furnace</b> (six <b>port</b> pairs), and (5) analyze test results, prepare report, and finalize the business plan to commercialize OEAS for sideport furnaces.

40|$|Laser-ultrasonics is a {{technique}} to remotely generate and detect acoustic waves using lasers. Being a truly remote technique, it is especially well suited for ultrasonic measurements at high temperatures, where conventional ultrasonic methods are impractical. Shear and longitudinal acoustic wave velocities were simultaneously measured in SiC reinforced alumina samples of varying porosity in the temperature range of 200 C to 18000 C. The temporal evolution of the velocities was also measured. Knowing the mass density and thermal expansion behavior of the samples, the measured velocities {{can be related to}} the average bulk elastic moduli. At room temperature, the elastic moduli vary linearly by one order or magnitude with mass density (porosity). At temperatures of up to 13000 C, the elastic moduli decrease linearly and independently of mass density (porosity). Above 13000 C, the elastic moduli may either increase or decrease depending on the sample mass density. Some time-dependence measurements at high temperatures were obtained. However, the samples sublimated and the condensate eventually blocked the <b>furnace's</b> optical <b>ports,</b> thus eliminating the time window to a few hours.

40|$|The modem, highly {{competitive}} business of producing low cost, premium quality iron via the blast furnace route requires precise process control and {{a thorough understanding}} of the key operational variables. Much of the understanding of the factors influencing the process can only be obtained from measuring and testing on each individual furnace. This is particularly the case with regard to the raw materials charging system, as local factors including raw material specification and specific equipment design greatly influence the process. When BHP Steel Flat Products Division embarked on the massive project of adding a new blast <b>furnace</b> to the <b>Port</b> Kembla Steelworks a decision was made to ensure the plant would begin operations only after it was thoroughly understood. In keeping with this approach, a significant program of testing was undertaken on the new No. 6 Blast Furnace charging system. This thesis details the work done, the results gained and the application of the information on the now operating plant. As the ultimate purpose of the blast furnace charging system is to enable the raw materials to be placed inside the furnace accurately and consistently in a predictable and controlled way, the aim of the test work undertaken on the charging system was to build the understanding necessary to allow the plant to be set up to achieve the desired burden distribution on the stockline. The testing covered the raw materials handling system from the point where the material is first diverted to No. 6 Blast Furnace {{all the way to the}} inside of the furnace on the burden surface. The information was used to characterise individual pieces of equipment and the systems which together are the charging system. The furnace operation since the original blow-in in June 1996 has been remarkably smooth, with the furnace reaching the uprating targets comfortably. The excellent progress made during the uprating and the consequent stable operation is significantly attributable to the extensive work done as part of the charging system design and commissioning to understand and control raw material size segregation...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{investigates the}} problem of the rate of release of alkalis from coal/coal blends as they are burnt in Utility Boilers with the aim of {{evolving}} better models of the effect of given fuel blends on slagging and fouling in real boiler situations. Although numerous slagging and fouling indices have been evolved over many years to describe the behaviour of coals in given boiler situations they often fail to give the required results and prove to be of little use when co-firing blends of coal with biomass materials. In this work we have constructed a natural gas flat flame burner with associated <b>furnace</b> and viewing <b>ports</b> so we can use a PLIF system to look at the evolution of sodium from burning coal/coal blend particles and relate this to the condition of the ash in the burning coal particle as the ash particle reaches the region of the superheater tubes in a boiler. By appropriate adjustment of the air fuel ratio we can produce temperature/residence time distributions downstream of the flat flame burner and in the furnace section which closely parallel those found in Utility Boilers. Pulverised coal particles as produced for boiler firing are sieved into two fractions, those in the size range 67 to 37 microns and above 67 microns (virtually no residue was found below 37 microns). This was to ensure that the finer fraction had a narrow size distribution, which devolatilised and burnt in a time frame commensurate with that of our system Particle velocities could be readily measured by streak velocity using the available PLIF camera via their radiation signal produced from their combustion process. The camera was aligned such that the initial devolatilisation process was not observed as the associated radiation could mask the PLIF image; this proved to be satisfactory as significant sodium evolution did not occur until {{after the end of the}} devolatilisation process. PLIF images of the sodium evolution were generated via excitation of the D₂ line at 16960. 95 cm⁻¹ with collection via a gated intensified CCD camera (Princeton Instruments ICCD- 576). Four groups of images (500 images per set) were generated and collected at each setting to ensure accuracy of results, with a polarisation filter to minimize interference from Mie scattering with the sodium fluorescence. Novel results have thus been produced which will allow the evolution of better models for predicting slagging and fouling, especially when the work is extended to other volatile species in coal ash.
