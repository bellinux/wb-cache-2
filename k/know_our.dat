25|$|We <b>know</b> <b>our</b> {{human bodies}} have {{boundaries}} and occupy space, {{the same way}} other objects known only through our named senses do. Though we seldom think of our body as a physical object, we know even before reflection that it shares some of an object's properties. We understand that a watermelon cannot successfully occupy the same space as an oncoming truck; we know that if we tried to repeat the experiment with our own body, we would obtain similar results—we know this {{even if we do}} not understand the physics involved.|$|E
25|$|In {{contrast}} to Picasso and Braque, Gleizes' intent {{was not to}} analyze and describe visual reality. Gleizes had argued that we cannot know the external world, we can only <b>know</b> <b>our</b> sensations. Objects from daily life⎯guitar, pipe or bowl of fruit⎯ did not satisfy his complex idealistic concepts of the physical world. His subjects were of vast scale and of provocative social and cultural meaning. Gleizes' iconography (as of Delaunay, Le Fauconnier and Léger) helps to explain why there is no period in his work corresponding to analytic Cubism, {{and how it was}} possible for Gleizes to become an abstract painter, more theoretically in tune with Kandinsky and Mondrian than Picasso and Braque, who remained associated with visual reality.|$|E

25|$|According to {{the further}} {{explanations}} of Xiong's student Mou Zongsan, Heaven {{is not merely}} sky, and just like the God of the Judaic and Hellenistic-Christian tradition {{is not one of}} the beings in the world. However, unlike the God of these religions, the God of Confucianism is not outside the world either, but is within humans, which is the primary concern of Confucianism, and other beings in the world. Tian is the ontological substance of reality, is immanent in every human being as the human nature (ren), but the human being on the phenomenal level is not identical with its metaphysical essence. Mencius stated that «the one who can fully realize one's heart/mind can understand one's nature, and the one who can understand one's own nature can know Tian»; Tian is within us, but before we fulfill our heart/mind and <b>know</b> <b>our</b> nature, Heaven still appears transcendent to us. Mou cites Max Muller that «a human being itself is potentially a God, a God one presently ought to become» to reflect th idea of the relationship of God and humanity in Confucianism and other Eastern religions. What is crucial is to transcend the phenomenon to reach Tian.|$|E

500|$|To be {{eligible}} for award consideration, the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences requires that a film be shown in a theater in Los Angeles County, California, for at least seven consecutive days during which it is advertised in print media. Studios hoping to position a film for some nominations usually satisfy that minimum requirement, then ease them into wide release from then until the nominations and/or awards ceremony. The flexibility this marketing strategy requires means that screens be available, and studios limit their releases of new films during this time to that end. As critic Ty Burr explained in a 2013 New York Times Magazine article on the mediocrity of new releases {{in the first month}} of the year: [...] "he studios ... <b>know</b> <b>our</b> attention is elsewhere." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{next two}} singles from Steers & Stripes both made number 1 as well: [...] "Only in America" [...] and [...] "The Long Goodbye", {{the latter of}} which was written by Irish pop singers Ronan Keating and Paul Brady. After it, the duo charted at number 5 with [...] "My Heart Is Lost to You" [...] and number 12 with a cover of Kim Richey's [...] "Every River", {{featuring}} a backing vocal from Richey. All of these other singles also made the pop charts. [...] "Only in America" [...] was later used by George W. Bush in his 2004 re-election campaign, and again in 2008 by Barack Obama in his campaign. Noting that the song was used by both a Republican and a Democrat candidate, Brooks (who wrote the song with Cook and Ronnie Rogers) {{said that it was}} [...] "very flattering to <b>know</b> <b>our</b> song crossed parties and potentially inspires all Americans." ...|$|E

500|$|In September 2011, set {{photos of}} Robert Downey Jr. driving {{a new model}} Acura were {{published}} online. An Acura spokesperson later released a statement confirming the company's involvement with the film, [...] "As you may know, Acura {{has been in the}} Marvel Comics Universe films as the official car of their fictional law enforcement agency called S.H.I.E.L.D. That relationship continues for The Avengers. The open-top sports car that was photographed yesterday is a one-off, fictional car that was made just for the movie and will not be produced. That said, as you may also <b>know,</b> <b>our</b> CEO has said publicly that we are studying {{the development of a new}} sportscar, but we can't say any more about it at this time." [...] In December 2011, Acura announced that a new NSX styled along the lines of the concept built for The Avengers would be unveiled at the 2012 North American International Auto Show. A series of 10 S.H.I.E.L.D. SUVs, based on the Acura MDX with modifications by Cinema Vehicle Services, were also made for the film.|$|E
500|$|After she {{accepted}} the role, Richard {{was told by}} Julia Smith {{that she would have}} to change her appearance, to make it more in keeping with Pauline's unglamorous lifestyle. This included having her hair cut. Richard has commented, [...] "I was very proud of my long hair, which had taken me years to grow. I hadn't had it cut short for nineteen years but reluctantly, I agreed... I cried my eyes out for the rest of the day after that traumatic hair cut." [...] From September 1984, Richard was involved in pre-production of the series, covering every angle, from hair, costume design and make-up to organising the set interior of her character's screen house. Richard has said that Pauline had been given extensive biographical detail, including minute specifics, such as her fictional time of her birth: [...] "It was vital that we should get to <b>know</b> <b>our</b> own characters intimately and so the cast initially sat together in family groups to learn our lines and bond with our 'relations'... it was essential to develop the rapport that families, who'd been together for years, would naturally have." [...] Richard's casting was considered to be [...] "a giant leap of faith" [...] by co-creators Holland and Smith, but one that ultimately [...] "landed on its feet", because Pauline went on to be one of the longest running characters in EastEnders history, remaining with the show for nearly twenty-two years.|$|E
500|$|In another {{interview}} with Soap Opera Digest, the actor spoke thoroughly of his departure, saying: [...] "It's {{not that one}} hadn't agreed to a reduction, but they hit you with a sledgehammer. It's done in such an insulting fashion. It could have been dealt with in a far more gracious way. It is cold and hard-nosed... The whole thing was so calculated it was unbelievable... It's not even about the money." [...] Despite this, during contract negotiations, Braeden refused {{to say that he}} had departed fully, but did not know when a return would occur. However, within weeks, news broke that the actor and the series had managed a new contract. In a statement issued by CBS Daytime, they said: [...] "We're very happy that Eric will be remaining with The Young and the Restless. Victor Newman has been {{an important part of the}} Genoa City canvas for nearly 30 years, and we <b>know</b> <b>our</b> audience will be tuning in to see what his plans are next." [...] Onscreen, Braeden exited November 2, 2009, and made his return on January 15, 2010. That same year, the actor celebrated thirty years on the soap opera. In 2012, Braeden experienced further contract negotiations and speculation arose again that he would be leaving. Published reports said that Victor would be absent from the canvas for two weeks and that his contract expired that November. Two months later, it was announced that the actor had signed a new contract with The Young and the Restless, furthering his portrayal of Victor for an unspecified period of time. Braeden stated that he was [...] "very glad we got the negotiations successfully behind us".|$|E

He also felt that Rhys becoming aware of Torchwood [...] "adds a new and interesting dynamic to the show." [...] Stephen Frank, writing for the gay and bisexual male entertainment site AfterElton indicated that he was [...] "all in favour" [...] of getting [...] "to <b>know</b> <b>our</b> favorite Cardiff cuckold [...] a little bit better". Though critical of Gwen's characterisation in previous episodes, he praised her defense of Rhys' memories {{at the end of the}} episode as her [...] "finest moment on this show" [...] and stated that it [...] "helps rehabilitate her". He stated overall that [...] "Meat" [...] had [...] "performed something of a minor miracle in the way it’s made me reassess my views of both Gwen and Rhys and their relationship." [...] Alasdair Stewart of Firefox News felt that Tregenna had written some of the strongest episodes of the series in the past and stated the episode [...] "should be one of the highlights of the series" [...] but [...] "instead, it's a mess". He criticised the plausibility of the villains, the poor special effects of the alien and the incompetency of the Torchwood team, describing the episode as containing a [...] "total lack of consistency" [...] and [...] "a total lack of basic understanding of what Torchwood are supposed to be capable of". He felt Kai Owen provided [...] "a bright spot in the episode" [...] describing him as [...] "clearly a powerhouse of an actor" [...] and opining that [...] "the scenes where he uncorks on first Eve Myles and then John Barrowman" [...] also brought out [...] "the best in both actors". Conversely, io9's Charlie Jane Anders felt the alien half of the episode to be [...] "one of the best examples of a humans-are-the-real-monsters story ever" [...] but felt that [...] "the other half of the episode was Torchwood at its rock-bottom worst". She criticised the argument scenes stating: [...] "I was having psychic chunks carved off me by a man in a yellow helmet, every time Gwen screamed at Rhys or Jack" [...] and felt overall that the episode contained [...] "too much screaming". She enjoyed the innuendos made by Jack, but criticised the scene where Gwen stared [...] "psycho-killerishly" [...] at him whilst kissing Rhys.|$|E
