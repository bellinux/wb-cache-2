Ucha <b>has</b> <b>similar</b> {{abilities}} to Masha, but speaks in complete sentences and complains a lot. It also has a different appearance, resembling a strawberry with bunny ears, and can transform into Berry's staff weapon.|$|E
5|$|Germanium is {{normally}} absent in diamond, {{but it can}} be introduced during the growth or by subsequent ion implantation. Germanium in diamond can be detected optically via the germanium-vacancy center, which <b>has</b> <b>similar</b> properties to those of the Si-vacancy center.|$|E
5|$|Improvements on the {{diagnosis}} of cerebral venous sinus thrombosis in life were made {{with the introduction of}} venography in 1951, which also aided in the distinction from idiopathic intracranial hypertension, which <b>has</b> <b>similar</b> presenting signs and symptoms in many cases.|$|E

5|$|Metroid Prime Pinball: Metroid Prime Pinball is a pinball {{version of}} Metroid Prime, {{following}} the same storyline and <b>has</b> <b>similar</b> gameplay elements; however, it is just presented through pinball format {{rather than as a}} first-person adventure.|$|E
5|$|One crustacean-specific and two insect-specific {{neurotoxins}} {{have been}} recovered from the Mediterranean black widow (L. tredecimguttatus), as have small peptides that inhibit angiotensin-1-converting enzyme; the venom of the redback, although little-studied, likely <b>has</b> <b>similar</b> agents.|$|E
5|$|The Isenberg Honors RAP <b>has</b> <b>similar</b> {{features}} and {{benefits to the}} Fellows RAP, but is specifically geared toward students who are both {{a member of the}} Isenberg School of Management and also the Commonwealth Honors College. Students will live together {{with other members of the}} RAP and also take a year-long seminar led by the Isenberg School of Management Undergraduate Dean.|$|E
30|$|In addition, upon heading samples 1 – 10 to 1000  °С (Table 1), the {{formation}} of complex iron and manganese oxide occurs via similar mechanism. The formed compounds <b>have</b> <b>similar</b> peaks regardless of the initial composition. This is related to rhombohedral structure, in which all cations are trivalent. Since hematite and hausmannite <b>have</b> <b>similar</b> structure, all XRD patterns <b>have</b> <b>similar</b> character.|$|R
50|$|A further {{issue is}} {{that in many cases}} there is little that differentiates the BPO {{providers}} other than size. They often provide <b>similar</b> services, <b>have</b> <b>similar</b> geographic footprints, leverage similar technology stacks, and <b>have</b> <b>similar</b> Quality Improvement approaches.|$|R
50|$|Other states <b>have</b> <b>similar</b> rules.|$|R
5|$|The {{tabulated}} IUCN {{ratings for}} the state reptiles all reflect species-level assessments; for most state reptiles, the IUCN does not discuss the subspecies situations. With the Arizona ridge-backed rattlesnake, the IUCN notes the subspecies <b>has</b> <b>similar</b> safety to the overall species, but does not formally rate the subspecies.|$|E
5|$|The water bull, {{also known}} as tarbh uisge in Scottish Gaelic, is a mythological Scottish {{creature}} similar to the Manx tarroo ushtey. Generally regarded as a nocturnal resident of moorland lochs, it is usually more amiable than its equine counterpart the water horse, but <b>has</b> <b>similar</b> amphibious and shapeshifting abilities.|$|E
5|$|Actinium is a soft, silvery-white, radioactive, {{metallic}} element. Its estimated {{shear modulus}} {{is similar to}} that of lead. Owing to its strong radioactivity, actinium glows in the dark with a pale blue light, which originates from the surrounding air ionized by the emitted energetic particles. Actinium <b>has</b> <b>similar</b> chemical properties to lanthanum and other lanthanides, and therefore these elements are difficult to separate when extracting from uranium ores. Solvent extraction and ion chromatography are commonly used for the separation.|$|E
25|$|Occurrence: Proteins that <b>have</b> a <b>similar</b> {{function}} or an {{occurrence in}} the same metabolic pathway, must be expressed together and <b>have</b> <b>similar</b> phylogenetic profile.|$|R

5|$|Bismuth {{is used to}} make {{free-machining}} steels and free-machining {{aluminium alloys}} for precision machining properties. It <b>has</b> <b>similar</b> effect to lead and improves the chip breaking during machining. The shrinking on solidification in lead {{and the expansion of}} bismuth compensate each other and therefore lead and bismuth are often used in similar quantities. Similarly, alloys containing comparable parts of bismuth and lead exhibit a very small change (on the order 0.01%) upon melting, solidification or aging. Such alloys are used in high-precision casting, e.g. in dentistry, to create models and molds. Bismuth is also used as an alloying agent in production of malleable irons and as a thermocouple material.|$|E
5|$|ESF is an {{autonomous}} institution, administratively separate from SU, while resources, facilities, and some infrastructure are shared. The two schools {{share a common}} Schedule of Classes; students at both institutions may take courses at the other, and degrees from ESF bear the Syracuse University seal along with the State University of New York. A number of concurrent degree programs and certificates are offered between the schools, as well. The college receives an annual appropriation {{as part of the}} SUNY budget and the state builds and maintains all of the college's educational facilities. The state <b>has</b> <b>similar</b> relationships with five statutory colleges that are at Alfred University and Cornell University.|$|E
5|$|Each {{city and}} county in the Metro service area <b>has</b> <b>similar</b> {{ordinances}} that regulate or prohibit vending on Metro-owned property, and which prohibit riders from eating, drinking, or smoking in Metro trains, buses, and stations; the Transit Police {{have a reputation for}} enforcing these laws rigorously. One widely publicized incident occurred in October 2000 when police arrested 12-year-old Ansche Hedgepeth for eating french fries in the Tenleytown-AU station. In a 2004 opinion by John Roberts, now Chief Justice of the United States, the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals upheld Hedgepeth's arrest. By then WMATA had answered negative publicity by adopting a policy of first issuing warnings to juveniles, and arresting them only after three violations within a year.|$|E

50|$|Finland and Sweden <b>have</b> <b>similar</b> early voting systems.|$|R
5|$|Frequently used topical retinoids include adapalene, isotretinoin, retinol, tazarotene, and tretinoin. They often {{cause an}} initial {{flare-up}} of acne and facial flushing, {{and can cause}} significant skin irritation. Generally speaking, retinoids increase the skin's sensitivity to sunlight and are therefore recommended for use at night. Tretinoin is the least expensive of the topical retinoids and is the most irritating to the skin, whereas adapalene is the least irritating to the skin but costs significantly more. Tazarotene {{is the most effective}} and expensive topical retinoid, but is not as well-tolerated. Retinol is a form of vitamin A that <b>has</b> <b>similar</b> but milder effects, and is used in many over-the-counter moisturizers and other topical products.|$|E
5|$|Geastrum welwitschii also <b>has</b> <b>similar</b> {{morphological}} {{characters to}} G.minimum in having small fruit bodies, whitish spore sacs, and fibrillose peristomes. However G.welwitschii is differentiated from G.minimum by its fornicate, mostly 3–6, {{rays of the}} exoperidia, and the mycelial layer that easily loosens from the fibrous layer to form a mycelial cup. G.welwitschii is distinguished from G.entomophilum by its dark and sessile endoperidium, and smaller spores (2.8–3.5μm).|$|E
5|$|Lord Howe Island {{is known}} for its geology, birds, plants, and marine life. Popular tourist {{activities}} include scuba diving, birdwatching, snorkelling, surfing, kayaking, and fishing. To relieve pressure on the small island environment only 400 tourists are permitted at any one time. The island is reached by plane from Sydney Airport or Brisbane Airport in less than two hours. The Permanent Park Preserve declared in 1981 <b>has</b> <b>similar</b> management guidelines to a National Park.|$|E

5|$|The Lockheed/Boeing/General Dynamics YF-22 was an American single-seat, {{twin-engine}} fighter aircraft {{technology demonstrator}} {{designed for the}} United States Air Force (USAF). The design was a finalist in the USAF's Advanced Tactical Fighter competition, and two prototypes were built for the demonstration/validation phase of the competition. The YF-22 won the contest against the Northrop YF-23, and entered production as the Lockheed Martin F-22 Raptor. The YF-22 <b>has</b> <b>similar</b> aerodynamic layout and configuration as the F-22, but with differences in the position and design of the cockpit, tail fins and wings, and in internal structural layout.|$|E
5|$|The {{diagnosis}} {{should be}} considered in anyone who develops a fever within two weeks of being in the tropics or subtropics. It can be difficult to distinguish dengue fever and chikungunya, a similar viral infection that shares many symptoms and occurs in similar parts of the world to dengue. Often, investigations are performed to exclude other conditions that cause similar symptoms, such as malaria, leptospirosis, viral hemorrhagic fever, typhoid fever, meningococcal disease, measles, and influenza. Zika fever also <b>has</b> <b>similar</b> symptoms as dengue.|$|E
5|$|The game is {{a remake}} of the {{original}} NES Mega Man title and <b>has</b> <b>similar</b> gameplay and level designs. The game moves on a 2D plane and players are given control of the game's eponymous hero Mega Man. Unlike the original's 8-bit graphics, the game uses 3D character models with super deformed designs. Mega Man's primary abilities include jumping and shooting and he is given both a health meter and a life meter. Mega Man can lose health by touching enemies or their projectiles, while lives will be lost when Lives will be consumed if Mega Man touches certain spikes, or falls into a pit. Lives and health can be found either dropped by enemies or in fixed locations.|$|E
