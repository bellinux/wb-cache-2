It {{was used as a}} fuel <b>distribution</b> <b>station</b> when the shortage of fuel began in June 1944. On August 6, 1945, when the bomb exploded, the roof was crushed, the interior destroyed, and everything consumable burned except in the basement. Eventually, 36 people in the building died of the bombing; 47-year-old Eizo Nomura survived in the basement, which had a concrete roof through which radiation had a more difficult time penetrating. He survived into his 80s.|$|E
25|$|Cullinan {{was born}} to John Francis and Mary (Considine) Cullinan on December 31, 1860, in Pulaski Township, Lawrence County, Pennsylvania, not far from Sharon, Pennsylvania. His first {{experience}} {{in the oil industry}} was when he was 14, working as a hand in the Pennsylvania oilfields. He was responsible for various oil-related duties including an oil <b>distribution</b> <b>station</b> in Oleopolis, Pennsylvania. This familiarity with all the aspects of the industry would later on be beneficial for his wisdom and sound judgment in the oil business. On April 14, 1891, he married Lucy Halm. Together, they would later have 5 children. When he was 22, he began to work for an affiliate of Standard Oil and for the next thirteen years, he performed various managerial duties. In 1895, he decided to venture into the business of manufacturing steel storage tanks and started his own company under the name Petroleum Iron Works located in New Castle, Pennsylvania.|$|E

40|$|The article {{deals with}} the urgency of {{adapting}} computational turbo-expander unit parameters techniques to the conditions of their application at gas <b>distribution</b> <b>stations.</b> Existing computational methods based {{on the use of}} air as the working medium yield incorrect data to determine the actual design parameters for operating conditions where the working medium is natural gas. A modernized algorithm of thermogasdynamic calculation of turbo-expanders in order to form the correct initial data for design calculations has been proposed. The objective of calculating turbo-expanders is to identify thermogasdynamic parameters and dimensions of the flow channel, rotational speed, and shaft power. Procedure of thermogasdynamic calculations is shown on the example of a turbo-expander running on natural gas. The result will simplify the process of selecting or designing turbo-expander units for gas <b>distribution</b> <b>stations...</b>|$|R
