50|$|The <b>separators</b> (<b>File,</b> Group, Record, and Unit: FS, GS, RS and US) {{were made}} to {{structure}} data, usually on a tape, in order to simulate punched cards.End of medium (EM) warns that the tape (or other recording medium) is ending.While many systems use CR/LF and TAB for structuring data, {{it is possible to}} encounter the <b>separator</b> control <b>characters</b> in data that needs to be structured. The <b>separator</b> control <b>characters</b> are not overloaded; there is no general use of them except to separate data into structured groupings. Their numeric values are contiguous with the space character, which can be considered a member of the group, as a word separator.|$|R

50|$|The {{directory}} <b>separator</b> <b>character</b> {{also appears}} on Korean versions of Microsoft Windows as ₩, because ₩ occupies {{the same position}} (0x5C) on code page 949 that backslash occupies in ASCII.|$|R
5000|$|Adjacent fields must be {{separated}} by a single comma. However, [...] "CSV" [...] formats vary greatly in this choice of <b>separator</b> <b>character.</b> In particular, in locales where the comma {{is used as a}} decimal separator, semicolon, TAB, or other characters are used instead.|$|R
50|$|ASCII {{includes}} several control characters that {{are intended to}} be used as delimiters. They are: 28 for <b>File</b> <b>Separator,</b> 29 for Group Separator, 30 for Record Separator, and 31 for Unit Separator. Use of these characters has not achieved widespread adoption; some systems have replaced their control properties with more accepted controls such as CR/LF and TAB.|$|R
50|$|Postal {{codes in}} Slovenia (poštna številka) are {{numerical}} strings which {{form part of}} a postal address in Slovenia. The codes consist of four digits written without <b>separator</b> <b>characters,</b> the first digit represents {{the region and the}} last three digits represent the individual post office.|$|R
50|$|The Enhanced Graphic Module {{introduced}} two point plotting modes. Entering {{the normal}} point plot mode with the ACSII <b>File</b> <b>Separator</b> (FS), instead of RS for graph mode, plotted only the {{points at the}} coordinates being sent, not the vectors between them. Special point plot, entered with , added an intensity character to the coordinate that defocussed the beam and allowed the points to have various brightnesses.|$|R
40|$|A fiat file is the {{simplest}} possible database. It {{consists of a}} single. unformatted text file in which each line corresponds to a record. k-l occurrences of a <b>separator</b> <b>character</b> divide each record into k variable length fields; the <b>separator</b> <b>character</b> does not otherwise appear in the file. Unlike most database systems, the fiat file system is not a single. large program. Instead, it con-sists {{of a set of}} small, independent programs. called primitives. that each perform one basic operation. The user composes a sub-set of the primitives by directing the output of one to the input of the next in order to perform complex retrieval or update opera-tions. Because they arc independent, primitives are easily modified or replaced, and one can add programs to the set of prim-itives. Both the selection of primltives as well as their implementa-tion are discussed. CSD-TR- 379 - 2...|$|R

50|$|Record {{separator}} delimited JSON streaming allows JSON text sequences to be delimited {{without the}} requirement that the JSON formatter exclude whitespace. Since JSON text sequences cannot contain control <b>characters,</b> a record <b>separator</b> <b>character</b> {{can be used to}} delimit the sequences. In addition, it is suggested that each JSON text sequence be followed by a line feed character to allow proper handling of top-level JSON objects that are not self delimiting (numbers, true, false, and null).|$|R
5000|$|In the Japanese-language locales of Microsoft {{operating}} systems, the yen sign in {{code page}} 932 character encoding {{has the same}} byte value as the backslash in ASCII. It is also used wherever a backslash is used, such as the directory <b>separator</b> <b>character</b> (for example, in [...] ) and as the general escape character (...) , essentially making it a backslash {{with the appearance of}} a yen sign, a peculiarity that stems from JIS X 0201.|$|R
2500|$|In a tripcode system, {{a secret}} {{password}} {{is added to}} the user's name following a <b>separator</b> <b>character</b> (often a number sign). This password, or tripcode, is hashed into a special key, or trip, distinguishable from the name by HTML styles. Tripcodes cannot be faked but on some types of forum software they are insecure and can be guessed. [...] On other types, they can be brute forced with software designed to search for tripcodes such as Tripcode Explorer.|$|R

The field name starts in the first character {{of the line and}} ends before the <b>separator</b> <b>character</b> [...] ":". The separator is then followed by the field value (the [...] "body" [...] of the field). The value is continued onto subsequent lines if those lines have a space or tab as their first character.

50|$|To {{determine}} the SMS gateway domain, e.g., , may require research, as mobile telephone users typically {{do not know}} this information when they provide their telephone number and due to number portability the number {{may no longer be}} associated with the carrier that originally issued it. Observe that the telephone number in this example is expressed as ten (10) digits, without the country code (1) and without dashes or other <b>separator</b> <b>characters</b> when composing the email address. The country code is not needed, as the 10-digit telephone number, together with the email domain, are sufficient to send the email from any location in the world.|$|R
5000|$|As {{there is}} {{currently}} no agreement on what <b>character</b> this alternative <b>separator</b> should be, there can be interoperability difficulties between different Maildir-supporting programs on these systems. However, not all Maildir-related software needs {{to know what the}} <b>separator</b> <b>character</b> is, because not all Maildir-related software {{needs to be able to}} read or modify the flags of a message ("read", [...] "replied to" [...] etc.); software that merely delivers to a Maildir, or archives old messages from it based only on date, should work no matter what separator is in use. If only the MUA needs to read or modify message flags, and only one is used, then non-standard alternative separators may be used without interoperability problems.|$|R
50|$|Most modern file systems allow filenames {{to contain}} {{a wide range of}} {{characters}} from the Unicode character set. However, they may have restrictions on the use of certain special characters, disallowing them within filenames; those characters might be used to indicate a device, device type, directory prefix, <b>file</b> path <b>separator,</b> or <b>file</b> type.|$|R
5000|$|Intelligent code {{completion}} works {{using an}} automatically generated in-memory database of classes, variable names, and other constructs that the application being edited defines or references. The [...] "classic" [...] implementation of IntelliSense works by detecting marker characters such as periods, or other <b>separator</b> <b>characters,</b> {{depending on the}} language. When the user types one of these characters immediately after {{the name of an}} entity having one or more accessible members (such as contained variables or functions), IntelliSense suggests matches in a pop-up window. The user can either accept the suggestion by typing a statement completion character ( [...] or [...] )—or a language-specific marker (such as the semicolon for C++), or continue typing the name. Over time, IntelliSense determines which variable or function the user most likely wants.|$|R
5000|$|Incremental plot, entered {{with the}} ASCII Record <b>Separator</b> (RS) <b>character,</b> {{replaced}} the normal coordinates with single-character directions.

40|$|Abstract {{copyright}} UK Data Service {{and data}} collection copyright owner. This project aimed to develop a model of health care use, using the most appropriate econometric techniques. The {{first step was to}} model health care demand in the Solihull Primary Care Trust (PCT) (now Solihull NHS Care Trust) area as defined by GP visits, inpatient visits and outpatient visits. The next step was to make forecasts of demand based on a range of scenarios. The aim was to provide the Trust with a model that they could use to run their own bespoke demographic and lifestyle scenarios to calculate future changes demand for health services. Main Topics : The data files comprise anonymised accident and emergency, general practitioner, inpatient and outpatient data from the Solihull PCT/NHS Care Trust from 2005 - 2011. The files are CSV outputs from a database. Users should note that many of the files are in. txt format and rather than commas, the <b>separator</b> <b>characters</b> may be '|' or '^'. The large size of the data files may mean that they are not suitable for analysis in Excel or standard text editors. <br...|$|R
