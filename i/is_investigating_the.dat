5|$|Generally {{seen as a}} {{pioneering}} work of zoology, Aristotle frames his text by explaining that he <b>is</b> <b>investigating</b> <b>the</b> what (the existing facts about animals) prior to establishing the why (the causes of these characteristics). The book is thus an attempt to apply philosophy to {{part of the natural}} world. Throughout the work, Aristotle seeks to identify differences, both between individuals and between groups. A group is established when it is seen that all members have the same set of distinguishing features; for example, that all birds have feathers, wings, and beaks. This relationship between the birds and their features is recognized as a universal.|$|E
