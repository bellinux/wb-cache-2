40|$|ABSTRACT The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to evaluate the effects of polymer coated slow-release urea (SRU) in high-forage diets of beef steers on nutrient intake and digestibility, ruminal fermentation, microbial protein synthesis, and energy balance. Eight 24 -mo-old rumen-fistulated castrated Nellore steers (average body weight = 418. 0 ± 40. 0 kg) were used in a replicated 4 × 4 Latin square design. Animals were randomly distributed to receive one of the following diets: no urea inclusion; 1. 0 % inclusion of <b>feed</b> <b>grade</b> <b>urea</b> in the diet (dry matter [DM] basis); 1. 0 % inclusion of slow-release urea 1 in the diet (DM basis); and 1. 0 % inclusion of slow-release urea 2 in the diet (DM basis). Slow-release urea 2 had a similar composition to that of slow-release urea 1 and differed in that it contained 2. 95 % sulfur. A high-forage diet was provided (75 % of total DM) and corn silage was used as the forage source. Diets with urea had increased crude protein (CP) intake, and CP and total digestible nutrients total tract digestion. Urea sources increased ruminal concentrations of ammonia nitrogen and acetate, and decreased butyrate concentrations. The polymer coated urea did not alter ruminal fermentation when compared with <b>feed</b> <b>grade</b> <b>urea.</b> Diets did not affect the energy balance of steers. <b>Feed</b> <b>grade</b> <b>urea</b> presented greater microbial protein synthesis than polymer coated slow-release urea. The partial replacement of soybean meal by 1 % slow-release urea in a diet with 75 % forage does not improve ruminal fermentation and microbial protein synthesis, and shows similar results as feeding <b>feed</b> <b>grade</b> <b>urea</b> to beef steers...|$|E
40|$|The {{experiment}} was planned {{to verify the}} effects of increasing blood urea levels resulting from increasing urea in the diet on cytogenetic parameters of Santa Ines Brazilian breed rams (Ovis aries), aged 13 to 18 months. Eighteen animals were divided into three experimental treatments consisted of: diet A ration with nitrogen levels, according to NRC (1985); diet B - ration with a 133 % higher level of nitrogen than diet A; and C- ration with a 166 % higher level of nitrogen than diet A. The increase in nitrogen level was obtained by adding 20, 40 g of <b>feed</b> <b>grade</b> <b>urea</b> in treatments B and C, respectively. Blood was collected {{on a weekly basis}} to determine urea concentration. Blood was also collected from each animal, 60 days after desired diet urea levels were reached, to obtain a lymphocyte culture in order to count chromosome number and determine mitotic index. Increases in plasma urea level were observed (p < 0. 0001), but did not affect the observed traits...|$|E
40|$|Objective Two {{experiments}} {{were performed to}} evaluate the effects of coated slow-release urea on nutrient digestion, ruminal fermentation, nitrogen utilization, blood glucose and urea concentration (Exp 1), and average daily gain (ADG; Exp 2) of steers. Methods Exp 1 : Eight ruminally fistulated steers [503 ± 28. 5 kg body weight (BW) ] were distributed into a d 4 × 4 Latin square design and assigned to treatments: control (CON), <b>feed</b> <b>grade</b> <b>urea</b> (U 2), polymer-coated slow-release urea A (SRA 2), and polymer-coated slow-release urea B (SRB 2). Dietary urea sources were set at 20 g/kg DM. Exp 2 : 84 steers (350. 5 ± 26. 5 kg initial BW) were distributed to treatments: CON, FGU at 10 or 20 g/kg diet DM (U 1 and U 2, respectively), coated SRA 2 at 10 or 20 g/kg diet DM (SRA 1 and SRA 2, respectively), and coated SRB at 10 or 20 g/kg diet DM (SRB 1 and SRB 2, respectively). Results Exp 1 : Urea treatments (U 2 +SRA 2 +SRB 2) decreased (7. 4 %, p = 0. 03) the DM intake and increased (11. 4 %, p< 0. 01) crude protein digestibility. Coated slow-release urea (SRA 2 +SRB 2) showed similar nutrient digestibility compwared to <b>feed</b> <b>grade</b> <b>urea</b> (FGU). However, steers fed SRB 2 had higher (p = 0. 02) DM digestibility compared to those fed SRA 2. Urea sources did not affect ruminal fermentation when compared to CON. Although, coated slow-release urea showed lower (p = 0. 01) concentration of NH 3 -N (− 10. 4 %) and acetate to propionate ratio than U 2. Coated slow-release urea showed lower (p = 0. 02) urinary N and blood urea concentration compared to FGU. Exp 2 : Urea sources decreased (p = 0. 01) the ADG in relation to CON. Animals fed urea sources at 10 g/kg DM showed higher (12. 33 %, p = 0. 01) ADG compared to those fed urea at 20 g/kg DM. Conclusion Feeding urea decreased the nutrient intake without largely affected the nutrient digestibility. In addition, polymer-coated slow-release urea sources decreased ruminal ammonia concentration and increased ruminal propionate production. Urea at 20 g/kg DM, regardless of source, decreased ADG compared both to CON and diets with urea at 10 g/kg DM...|$|E

40|$|Two winter {{trials were}} {{conducted}} with 304 lactating range cows on dry grass to evaluate non-protein-nitrogen (NPN) in 30 % protein supplements containing biuret (pure and <b>feed</b> <b>grade),</b> <b>urea</b> and extruded grain-urea. The NPN sources contributed one-half of the supplemental nitrogen with natural 15 and 30 % protein supplements serving as negative and positive controls. Winter weight loss of cows was greater (P~. 02) on the negative than on the positive control in both trials. The apparent utilization of all NPN sources was low and the utilization of urea and extruded grain-urea was less than pure or feed grade biuret. Rumen biuretolytic activity was apparent within 6 days and reached and maintained {{a high level of}} activity 20 days after the initiation of feeding biuret, even with intermittent supplementation. Apparent value of NPN supplements was slightly improved with 40 % dehydrated alfalfa but not with methionine- hydroxy-analogue (MHA). Palatability of supplements was lowered by urea and especially by MHA and extruded grain-urea. In a third trial with yearling heifers fed prairie hay, gains were similar on natural protein and supplements containing urea or extruded grain-urea to provide one-half of the nitrogen.

40|$|The {{objectives}} of the project were {{to determine the effects}} of dietary crude protein intake, on blood concentrations of ammonia and urea and on fertility, and on the possible biological mechanisms involved. Heifers were used in all experiments in order to avoid any confounding effects of lactation and, or, negative energy balance. The results are summarised as follows. • • • • 5 Blood urea and ammonia increased linearly with increases in dietary urea. Fermentable carbohydrate, in the form of molassed sugar beet pulp (MSBP), was more effective than barley in reducing blood urea concentration. Plasma ammonia concentrations were more variable but MSBP was again more effective than barley in reducing these. Embryo survival rate was not affected by either dietary crude protein (CP) or fermentable energy intake irrespective of whether animals were fed a silage diet supplemented with <b>feed</b> <b>grade</b> <b>urea</b> or were grazing pasture with a high crude protein content. Despite generating systemic urea concentrations of up to 25 mmol/L and systemic ammonia concentrations of up to 242 μmol/L no significant relationship between these parameters and embryo survival rate was established. Consistent with these results on embryo survival, elevated blood urea or ammonia had little effect on the biochemical composition of oviduct fluid, the environment of the early developing embryo. It can be concluded that elevations in systemic concentrations of ammonia or urea per se, particularly of the magnitude observed under normal feeding conditions, are unlikely to impair embryo survival in cattle as a consequence of disruptions to the oviductal environment.

40|$|In total, 20 {{multiparous}} Holstein-Friesian {{dairy cows}} received {{one of four}} diets in each of four periods of 28 -day duration in a Latin square design {{to test the hypothesis}} that the inclusion of lucerne in the ration of high-yielding dairy cows would improve animal performance and milk fatty acid (FA) composition. All dietary treatments contained 0. 55 : 0. 45 forage to concentrates (dry matter (DM) basis), and within the forage component the proportion of lucerne (Medicago sativa), grass (Lolium perenne) and maize silage (Zea mays) was varied (DM basis) : control (C) = 0. 4 : 0. 6 grass : maize silage; L 20 = 0. 2 : 0. 2 : 0. 6 lucerne : grass : maize silage; L 40 = 0. 4 : 0. 6 lucerne : maize silage; and L 60 = 0. 6 : 0. 4 lucerne : maize silage. Diets were formulated to contain a similar CP and metabolisable protein content, with the reduction of soya bean meal and <b>feed</b> <b>grade</b> <b>urea</b> with increasing content of lucerne.

50|$|Grade-recovery curves {{are useful}} tools in {{weighing}} the trade-off {{of producing a}} high grade of concentrate while maintaining as low of a recovery rate as possible, two important aspects of froth flotation.

40|$|As {{a result}} of the cost of grains, the {{replacement}} of grains by co-products (i. e. DDGS) in feedlot diets is a common practice. This change produces diets that contain a lower amount of starch and greater amount of fibre. Hypothetically, combining <b>feed</b> <b>grade</b> <b>urea</b> (U) with slow release urea (Optigen) in this type of diet should elicit a better synchrony between starch (high-rate of digestion) and fibre (low-rate of digestion) promoting a better microbial protein synthesis and ruminal digestion with increasing the digestible energy of the diet. Four cannulated Holstein steers (213 ± 4 kg) were used in a 4 × 4 Latin square design to examine the combination of Optigen and U in a finishing diet containing different starch:acid detergent fibre ratios (S:F) on the characteristics of digestive function. Three S:F ratios (3. 0, 4. 5, and 6. 0) were tested using a combination of U (0. 80 %) and Optigen (1. 0 %). Additionally, a treatment of 4. 5 S:F ratio with urea (0. 80 % in ration) as the sole source of non-protein nitrogen was used to compare the effect of urea combination at same S:F ratio. The S:F ratio of the diet was manipulated by replacing the corn grain by dried distillers grain with solubles and roughage. Urea combination did not affect ruminal pH. The S:F ratio did not affect ruminal pH at 0 and 2 h post-feeding but, at 4 and 6 h, the ruminal pH decreased as the S:F ratio increased (linear, p< 0. 05). Ruminal digestion of OM, starch and feed N were not affected by urea combination or S:F ratio. The urea combination did not affect ADF ruminal digestion. ADF ruminal digestion decreased linearly (p = 0. 02) as the S:F ratio increased. Compared to the urea treatment (p< 0. 05) and within the urea combination treatment (quadratic, p< 0. 01), the flow of microbial nitrogen (MN) to the small intestine and ruminal microbial efficiency were greater for the urea combination at a S:F ratio of 4. 5. Irrespective of the S:F ratio, the urea combination improved (2. 8 %, p = 0. 02) postruminal N digestion. As S:F ratio increased, OM digestion increased, but ADF total tract digestion decreased. The combination of urea at 4. 5 S:F improved (2 %, p = 0. 04) the digestible energy (DE) more than expected. Combining urea and Optigen resulted in positive effects on the MN flow and DE of the diet, but apparently these advantages are observed only when there is a certain proportion of starch:ADF in the diet...|$|E
40|$|Protein is a {{fundamental}} part of nutrition in all animals but ruminants {{have the ability to}} metabolise and utilise non-protein nitrogen for this use. This allows for an economical alternative source of protein that does not compete with human resources. Previous evidence suggests that feeding high levels of protein to support increased demands for growth and production may {{have a negative impact on}} reproduction, since protein is rapidly converted to ammonia and further metabolised to urea which are both toxic to the reproductive system. Investigations within the South African climate indicated that the Nguni cow maintained higher blood urea nitrogen (BUN) levels during periods of drought than other cattle breeds. The Nguni breed is well adapted to extreme situations but as its popularity grows and the breed is promoted for emerging farmers it becomes essential to know if it possesses adaptations which could predispose it to reproductive failure if supplemented in the same manner as other commercial breeds. In this prospective experimental study, 22 multiparous cows of two breeds, the Hereford and the Nguni, were block randomised into a cross over design whereby all animals were fed a total mixed ration (TMR). The test group was provided with an increasing rumen degradable protein content in the form of <b>feed</b> <b>grade</b> <b>urea.</b> The control group was maintained on a urea free TMR. In the test group, the urea inclusion rate was increased weekly by 50 g to allow for rumen microflora adaptation and prevent acute urea toxicity. They reached a maximum inclusion rate of 200 g urea per cow per day. All animals had serum collected and oocytes aspirated by transvaginal ultrasound guided oocyte pick up (OPU) were counted and graded twice weekly. Following this, all usable oocytes were pooled per breed and treatment, and were subject to in vitro maturation, fertilisation and culture in order to assess the effect of elevated protein on oocyte competence and viability. Oocyte quality was defined as the number of oocytes with cumulus cells (Grade 1 3 oocytes) harvested per OPU, and oocyte viability was defined as the number of oocytes that cleaved by day 2 or that reached at least the morula stage by day 7 in the in vitro embryo system. Multivariable analyses were performed on BUN, antral follicle count (AFC) and number of grade 1 3 oocytes harvested per OPU session, and on the oocyte viability outcomes in the vitro embryo system. Nguni cows receiving 150 g dietary urea per day had lower mean BUN levels than Herefords (17. 5 and 19. 3 mg/dL respectively, P = 0. 02). However dietary urea inclusion level, serum albumin level and sampling day were the only independent predictors of serum BUN. Nguni cows had lower mean antral follicle count (AFC) and number of oocytes harvested than Herefords (9. 1 and 3. 1, and 11. 7 and 4. 3 respectively, P 20 mg/dL were independently associated with the number of grade 1 - 3 oocytes after adjusting for AFC and the random effect of the individual animal. Increasing weighted mean serum albumin and decreasing weighted mean beta-hydroxybutyric acid (BHBA) were independently associated with the number of oocytes that cleaved (day 2) or that reached the morula stage (day 7) (P = 0. 01 and P = 0. 08 respectively). It was concluded that increasing dietary urea, low BCS and increasing serum albumin, but not breed, were associated with increasing BUN levels in cows. It was further concluded that BUN > 20 mg/dL adversely affected the occurrence of cumulus cells around oocytes and that serum albumin and BHBA were, but neither dietary urea level nor breed was independently associated with viability of bovine oocytes in this study. Although the data were inconclusive about breed differences in protein metabolism, this study suggests that serum albumin has the potential to be used as predictor of the interaction between protein and energy metabolism and its effect on oocyte development.

40|$|PUTF ProjectAfter {{studying}} the direction work in mineral liberation has taken {{for the past}} twenty years, {{and in particular the}} more recent five to ten years, it has become apparent to me that at least for the magnetic taconite process, the use of the Davis tube ideal magnetic separator on individual size fractions of process feed can provide useful data on liberation. A study made by the writer 1 of process feed samples to twelve magnetite concentrators indicated a reasonable conformity between Davis tube concentrate magnetite grade and size fraction mean particle size relationships and what was predicted using the idealized "random liberation model" formulation 2 with appropriate specific gravities for magnetite and waste minerals. This then suggests that the magnetic taconite liberation behavior can be characterized by three parameters (given the two specific gravities) : (1) magnetite ore feed grade; (2) an average mineral grain size; and (3) an average size fraction particle size. Of the twelve sample sets noted above, only two indicated significant deviations from the shape of the concentrate grade-particle size relationships displayed by the "random model. " A BASIC computer program (LIBFIT. BAS) has therefore been written to obtain the best fit of the two parameters: magnetite <b>feed</b> <b>grade</b> of the ore and average mineral grain size for the "random model," to Davis tube data on size fractions of ground taconite. The program is relatively simple in concept, in that it first seeks a value of average mineral grain size, which minimizes the sum of squares of differences in the measured and calculated Davis tube concentrate grades for an estimated magnetite <b>feed</b> <b>grade</b> of the ore. It then holds the optimum average mineral grain size constant and searches for the optimum magnetite <b>feed</b> <b>grade</b> for that mineral grain size. It continues to switch back and forth, looking at first mineral grain size and then magnetite ore <b>feed</b> <b>grade</b> for some 18 iterations, which then provides a best fit estimate of the two parameters.

40|$|M. Tech. Maize (Zea may) is {{the third}} most {{important}} cereal in the world serving various purpose of economic importance especially as staple diet to the Africans and as {{a major component of}} animal feed. Unfortunately, this commodity serves as a suitable substrate for pest and fungi development which may result in the production of mycotoxins. Mycotoxins are secondary metabolites of varying chemical structures produced by filamentous fungi, which may contaminate agricultural commodities either in the field or at storage. Mycotoxins have been implicated to cause several diseases in humans and animals ranging from acute to chronic. This study was designed to determine and quantify the occurrence and levels of mycotoxins in South African <b>feed</b> <b>grade</b> commercial maize. A total of 40 commercial <b>feed</b> <b>grade</b> maize samples were randomly sampled from two factory sites (Factory A and Factory B) of a commercial feed company source from known South African maize producers. The samples were screened for fungi using the conventional method while the mycotoxin screening and quantification was done by thin layer chromatography (TLC) and high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC). In addition to TLC and HPLC, VICAM/HPLC, VICAM/fluorometer, enzyme linked immuno-sorbent assay (ELISA) and lateral flow method were used for determination and quantification of fumonisins. The mycological investigation revealed the occurrence of several fungal species of Fusarium, Aspergillus and Penicillium with Fusarium being the most prevalent (100 %). Among the Fusarium spp. were F. verticillioides, F. proliferatum, F. oxysporum and F. graminearum, F. subglutinans, F. chlamydosporum, F. solani, F. poae and F. dimerum. Fusarium verticillioides and F. proliferatum had the highest incidence rate of 89 % and 73 %, respectively, followed by F. oxysporum (65 %) and F. graminearum (48 %). The rate of occurrence of A. fumigatus, A. flavus and Penicillium spp. were 45 %, 43 % and 38 %, respectively. Further analysis on the isolated fungal strains proved that over 50 % of the fungal spp. were toxigenic. Mycotoxicological study on the samples revealed that the samples were contaminated with fumonisins (FB), aflatoxins B (AFB), ochratoxin A (OTA) and zearalenone (ZEA) on TLC. Mycotoxins levels in the samples were confirmed on HPLC, with the levels ranging from 0. 064 - 1. 035 ppm for FB, 0 - 0. 762 ppm for iii AFB, 0 - 0. 194 ppm for OTA and 0 - 0. 135 ppm for ZEA. There was no significance difference on mycotoxin concentration in the <b>feed</b> <b>grade</b> sample between the two factory sites. Results obtained from the VICAM methods, ELISA and lateral flow method for FB determination showed 100 % incidence rate of the <b>feed</b> <b>grade</b> maize samples similar to that observed on HPLC. Although ELISA (0. 190 - 2. 450 ppm) and lateral flow method (0. 350 - 2. 700 ppm) showed higher concentration of FB compared to HPLC (0. 064 - 1. 035 ppm), recovery analysis on sample using lateral flow gave high value (85 %) comparable to HPLC. Further analyses were performed to determine the cytotoxic potential of the <b>feed</b> <b>grade</b> maize samples using the fumonisin fraction (FFraction).

40|$|Selective Non-Catalytic Reduction (SNCR) of {{nitric oxide}} was studied {{experimentally}} by injecting different concentrations of aqueous urea solution in a pilot-scale diesel fired tunnel furnace at 3 - 4 % excess oxygen level and with low ppm of baseline NOx ranged from 65 to 75 ppm within the investigated temperature range. The furnace simulated small-scale combustion {{systems such as}} low capacity boilers, hot water heaters, oil heaters, etc., where the operating temperatures are usually {{in the range of}} about 973 to 1323 K and NOx emission level remains below 100 ppm. In order to investigate the influence of additive on reduction characteristics, different concentrations of commercial grade sodium carbonate (Na 2 CO 3) were added to urea solution. The significant aspects of the studies are that it employed commercial <b>grade</b> <b>urea</b> as NOx reducing agent and commercial grade Na 2 CO 3 as additive to urea solution to minimize the cost of the SNCR operation. NOx reductions were studied with the variation of different parameters such as injection temperature, residence time, Normalized Stoichiometric Ratio (NSR) of the reagent, carrier gas pressure, etc. A significant amount of NOx reduction was achieved which was not pronounced by the previous researchers with urea SNCR for this low ppm of NOx. With 5 % plain urea solution, at an NSR of 4 as much as 54 % reduction was achieved at 1128 K, whilst in the additive case the NOx reduction was improved to as much as 69 % at 1093 K. Apart from this improvement, in the additive case, the effective temperature window as well as peak temperature of NOx reduction shifted towards lower temperatures. The ammonia slip measurements showed that in both cases the slip was below 16 ppm at NSR of 3 and optimum temperature of NOx reduction. Finally, the investigations demonstrated that urea based SNCR is quite applicable to small-scale combustion applications and commercial <b>grade</b> <b>urea</b> and sodium carbonate are potential NOx reducing agent and additive respectively...|$|R
40|$|THE {{availability}} of the phosphorus content of <b>feed</b> <b>grade</b> phosphates has been reported by numerous workers. There is little information on the {{availability of}} the calcium content of these mineral sup-plements to chicks. A test was designed to determine if calcium availability values could be be assigned to <b>feed</b> <b>grade</b> phos-phates. EXPERIMENTAL Twelve diets were fed from one day to three weeks of age to commercial strain broiler cockerels. Each diet was fed to replicate groups of 20 chicks each. The birds were maintained in electrically heated battery brooders with raised wire floors. Feed and water were provided ad libitum. The practical type basal diet was one previously used at this station in phos-phorus availability studies (Dilworth and Day, 1964). This diet was primarily com-posed of degerminated corn meal and soy-bean meal (50 % protein). The constant dietary ingredients represented 95 % of the total with the remaining 5 % being the test variables and sucrose. In this manner the basal diet contributed the same amount of phytin phosphorus (0. 37 %) and cal-cium (0. 10 %) to each experimental diet. The vitamin D 3 level was constant in all diets at 2010 I. C. U. per kg. The number of tibia collected from each group and the method of cleaning and ashing were de-scribed by Dilworth and Day (1964). Graded levels of added calcium, 0. 15...|$|R
40|$|Two {{episodes of}} {{accidental}} urea toxicosis {{are described in}} wild silver gulls (Larus novaehollandiae) following spillage of fertilizer <b>grade</b> <b>urea</b> at a commercial shipping facility near Perth, Western Australia. In both cases, urea spillage had been seen to contaminate freshwater wash-down pools on the wharves where ships were being unloaded and gulls were seen to be drinking and washing in the pools nearby the spillages. Affected birds were found moribund or dead. Necropsy and histopathological findings were non-specific and consisted of mild to moderate congestion of visceral organs and brain. Analysis of a water sample collected during Case 1 revealed a very high urea concentration of 4. 124 mol/l (pH 5. 5), and fluid from the proventriculus of two birds had urea concentrations of 382 and 308 mmol/l, respectively.

40|$|The first aim of {{this study}} was to examine the effects of strain and age on phytate {{phosphorus}} (PP) utilization and intestinal phytase activity (IPA) in two strains of laying hens, Hy-line Brown (HB) and Hy-line White W- 36 (HW) at 32, 52 and 72 weeks of age. A digestion trial was conducted using the indicator method and birds were sampled to measure IPA. The second aim was to examine the effect of <b>feed</b> <b>grade</b> exogenous phytase enzyme on total (TP), water soluble (WSP) and phytate phosphorus (PP) excretion in the HW strain fed varying levels of phosphorus. Hens were fed three concentrations of available P (AP) : 0. 2, 0. 3 and 0. 4 %. Each level of P was supplemented with three levels of commercial <b>feed</b> <b>grade</b> exogenous phytase enzyme (0, 300, and 600 FTU/kg) and the amount of TP, WSP and PP in excreta per 100 g of feed consumed was calculated. The HB retained more PP as compared to HW. Intestinal phytase activity showed a significant (P< 0. 01) age effect with the highest activity occurring at 32 weeks. There were significant differences in the amount of TP and SP excreted between birds receiving the 3 levels of phosphorus with 300 units phytase (P< 0. 01). The results of this study showed that layers are capable of utilizing PP, and that utilization is regulated by IPA and varies with age. Exogenous phytase improved PP utilization but it increased the amount of TP and WSP in excreta...|$|R
