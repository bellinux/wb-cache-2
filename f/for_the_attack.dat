50|$|Although nobody claimed {{responsibility}} <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>attacks,</b> {{police said they}} suspected Muslim insurgents were responsible <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>attacks.</b>|$|R
50|$|On {{the day of}} <b>the</b> <b>attacks,</b> U.S. {{intelligence}} agencies also intercepted communications that pointed to Osama bin Laden. It was quickly asserted that Osama bin Laden was responsible <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>attacks,</b> and other suspects were ruled out. Although he denied <b>the</b> <b>attacks</b> at first, Osama bin Laden later admitted full and sole responsibility <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>attacks</b> in a video tape.|$|R

5|$|Haakon {{enters his}} ship, the fleet rows forward <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>attack,</b> and battle ensues. The weather becomes thick in the north, the clouds cover the sky, {{daylight}} becomes sparse, thunder and lightning ring out, and {{it begins to}} rain. The Jomvikings fleet fights facing the storm and cold, and they have trouble standing due to the heavy wind. The Jomsvikings throw weapons, missiles, and stones at Haakon's fleet but the winds turn their projectiles back at them.|$|E

5|$|Most of the German bombers {{had passed}} over {{and had an}} {{altitude}} advantage over French fighters trying to gain height to intercept. Skirmishes were few and far between, but some French units suffered heavy losses. <b>For</b> <b>the</b> <b>attack,</b> the Germans had used the new C-250 Flammbombe (Flame Bomb) which had only been cleared for use 24 hours earlier. The incendiary bomb did some damage to hangars and parked aircraft.|$|E

Hinckley's motivation <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>attack</b> was to impress actress Jodie Foster, over whom he had developed an obsession after seeing her in the 1976 film Taxi Driver.|$|E
5|$|One {{problem with}} {{counting}} attacks on humans {{is that the}} copper shark is so similar to other requiem sharks. Victims and witnesses are unlikely to correctly identify which type of genus Carcharhinus shark is responsible <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>attack.</b> Experts trying to confirm shark attacks by species warn that their statistics undercount the number of attacks by requiem sharks like the copper.|$|E

5|$|Shortly {{after midnight}} on October 8, optimistic field reports expecting an {{imminent}} Egyptian collapse caused Gonen to alter plans <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>attack.</b> Adan would now {{attack in the}} direction of the strongpoints at Firdan and Ismailia. The change was not formulated on precise tactical intelligence, and would come to cause some confusion among Israeli commanders for the rest of the day.|$|E
5|$|Soon {{after the}} war, many Israelis demanded an {{impartial}} inquiry to investigate {{what became known}} as the machdal (the blunder), with a focus on the shortcomings of the government and the army, particularly their lack of preparedness <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>attack</b> and its ramifications. Golda Meir finally agreed to the formation of the Agranat Commission towards the end of November 1973. War veterans and members of the public attacked Meir and Moshe Dayan, while Israeli generals criticised one another's performance.|$|E
5|$|The German and Ottoman {{objective}} {{was not to}} cross the canal, but to capture Romani and establish a strongly entrenched heavy artillery position opposite Kantara, from which to bombard shipping on the canal.
