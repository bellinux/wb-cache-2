25|$|Two {{thousand}} years ago in ancient Central America, a battle was waged between Totec, the Guardian of the Light, and Xolotl, the Keeper of Darkness. Totec's army was defeated when Xolotl used the mirror of smoke to unleash hordes of ghastly creatures that fought on his behalf. Totec survived the battle and {{found a way to}} defeat Xolotl, imprisoning him in the mirror of smoke and becoming its immortal guardian {{in the form of a}} stone statue. In the present day, Lara Croft reads of the legend and attempts to find the mirror. After a long and dangerous journey she is successful. While examining the mirror, she is caught unaware by a band of mercenaries. Led by the local warlord, they had <b>followed</b> <b>her</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> temple. Unknowing or unbelieving of the curse upon the mirror, the warlord takes it from Lara. His reckless handling of the mirror releases Xolotl. The stone statue of Totec comes to life and warns Lara that Xolotl must be stopped before the light of dawn. Depending on the number of players participating, Lara and Totec either join forces or go their separate ways to try to stop Xolotl.|$|E

500|$|Born in Sydney, Thorpe {{grew up in}} {{the suburb}} of Milperra and hailed from a {{sporting}} family. His father Ken was a promising cricketer at junior level, representing Bankstown District Cricket Club in Sydney's district competition. A talented batsman, he once topped the season's batting averages ahead of former Australian captain Bob Simpson. However, paternal pressure detracted from Ken's enjoyment of cricket, and he retired at the age of 26. Thorpe's mother Margaret played A-grade netball, but he did not inherit his parents' ball skills. His elder sister Christina was advised to take up swimming to strengthen a broken wrist, so by chance, the five-year-old Thorpe <b>followed</b> <b>her</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> pool. Due to his unhappy experiences, Ken Thorpe regarded enjoyment as the most critical aspect of his children's participation in sport. A large baby, Thorpe weighed [...] and measured [...] in length at birth.|$|E

2500|$|Kate (1844–1924) was {{the first}} of the Terry {{children}} to make the family name famous on the English stage, beginning her career as a small child. According to the academic Nina Auerbach, Kate may have been the most accomplished actor among her siblings, quickly gaining praise in the plays of Shakespeare, among others. Contemporary critics thought the same: The Manchester Guardian ended its report of her last performance before her retirement: [...] "In our unwilling acceptance of her farewell, we must now rest satisfied with the memory of the peerless beauty of her merry-hearted acting ... like the music of a bewitching melody piercing the stillness of the night, and ending just when the ear longed for the next note." [...] She gave up acting when she married the businessman Arthur James Lewis (1824–1901) in 1867 when she was 23. She made only two later stage appearances, the first in 1898, in a small role supporting her daughter Mabel in a new play in the West End; the second was in 1906 at her sister Ellen's jubilee celebrations at Drury Lane. Of her four children, all daughters, only the youngest, Mabel, <b>followed</b> <b>her</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> theatrical profession. The two middle daughters were Janet and Lucy. Kate's eldest daughter, also named Kate, married Frank Gielgud; their four children included Val and John Gielgud.|$|E
