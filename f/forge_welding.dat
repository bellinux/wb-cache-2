5|$|The Middle Ages brought {{advances}} in <b>forge</b> <b>welding,</b> in which blacksmiths pounded heated metal repeatedly until bonding occurred. In 1540, Vannoccio Biringuccio published De la pirotechnia, which includes {{descriptions of the}} forging operation. Renaissance craftsmen were skilled in the process, and the industry continued to grow during the following centuries.|$|E
5|$|Like {{the first}} welding process, <b>forge</b> <b>welding,</b> some modern welding methods {{do not involve}} the melting of the {{materials}} being joined. One of the most popular, ultrasonic welding, is used to connect thin sheets or wires made of metal or thermoplastic by vibrating them at high frequency and under high pressure. The equipment and methods involved are {{similar to that of}} resistance welding, but instead of electric current, vibration provides energy input. Welding metals with this process does not involve melting the materials; instead, the weld is formed by introducing mechanical vibrations horizontally under pressure. When welding plastics, the materials should have similar melting temperatures, and the vibrations are introduced vertically. Ultrasonic welding is commonly used for making electrical connections out of aluminum or copper, and it is also a very common polymer welding process.|$|E
5|$|Until {{the end of}} the 19th century, {{the only}} welding process was <b>forge</b> <b>welding,</b> which blacksmiths had used for millenia to join iron and steel by heating and hammering. Arc welding and oxyfuel welding were among the first {{processes}} to develop late in the century, and electric resistance welding followed soon after. Welding technology advanced quickly during the early 20th century as the world wars drove the demand for reliable and inexpensive joining methods. Following the wars, several modern welding techniques were developed, including manual methods like SMAW, now {{one of the most popular}} welding methods, as well as semi-automatic and automatic processes such as GMAW, SAW, FCAW and ESW. Developments continued with the invention of laser beam welding, electron beam welding, magnetic pulse welding (MPW), and friction stir welding in the latter half of the century. Today, the science continues to advance. Robot welding is commonplace in industrial settings, and researchers continue to develop new welding methods and gain greater understanding of weld quality.|$|E
50|$|Many metals can be <b>forge</b> <b>welded,</b> {{with the}} most common being both high and {{low-carbon}} steels. Iron and even some hypoeutectic cast-irons can be <b>forge</b> <b>welded.</b> Some aluminum alloys can also be <b>forge</b> <b>welded.</b> Metals such as copper, bronze and brass do not <b>forge</b> <b>weld</b> readily. Although {{it is possible to}} <b>forge</b> <b>weld</b> copper-based alloys, it is often with great difficulty due to copper's tendency to absorb oxygen during the heating. Copper and its alloys are usually better joined with cold welding, explosion welding, or other pressure-welding techniques. With iron or steel, the presence of even small amounts of copper severely reduces the alloy's ability to <b>forge</b> <b>weld.</b>|$|R
5000|$|Titanium alloys are {{commonly}} <b>forge</b> <b>welded.</b> Because of titanium's tendency to absorb oxygen when molten, the solid-state, diffusion bond of a <b>forge</b> <b>weld</b> is often stronger than a fusion weld {{in which the}} metal is liquefied.|$|R
5000|$|Faggoting or faggoting and folding is a {{metalworking}} {{technique used}} in the smelting and forging of wrought iron, blister steel, and other steel. Faggoting is {{a process in which}} rods or bars of iron and/or steel are gathered (like a bundle of sticks or [...] "faggot") and <b>forge</b> <b>welded</b> together. The faggot would then be drawn out lengthwise. The bar might then be broken and the pieces made into a faggot again or folded over, and <b>forge</b> <b>welded</b> again.|$|R
25|$|While {{examples}} of <b>forge</b> <b>welding</b> {{go back to}} the Bronze Age and the Iron Age, arc welding did not come into practice until much later.|$|E
25|$|Mughal cannon making skills {{advanced}} {{during the}} 17th century. One {{of the most}} impressive Mughal cannons is known as the Zafarbaksh, which is a very rare composite cannon, that required skills in both wrought-iron <b>forge</b> <b>welding</b> and bronze-casting technologies and the in-depth knowledge of the qualities of both metals.|$|E
25|$|Oxy-fuel {{is one of}} {{the oldest}} welding processes, besides <b>forge</b> <b>welding.</b> In recent decades it has been obsolesced in almost all {{industrial}} uses due to various arc welding methods offering more consistent mechanical weld properties and faster application. Gas welding is still used for metal-based artwork and in smaller home based shops, as well as situations where accessing electricity (e.g., via an extension cord or portable generator) would present difficulties.|$|E
50|$|Amongst {{its other}} properties, wrought iron becomes soft at red heat, {{and can be}} easily <b>forged</b> and <b>forge</b> <b>welded.</b> It {{can be used to}} form {{temporary}} magnets, but cannot be magnetized permanently, and is ductile, malleable and tough.|$|R
50|$|During {{the last}} few foldings, the steel may be forged into several thin plates, stacked, and <b>forge</b> <b>welded</b> into a brick. The grain of the steel is {{carefully}} positioned between adjacent layers, with the exact configuration dependent {{on the part of}} the blade for which the steel will be used.|$|R
5000|$|The bars {{were then}} shortened, bound, heated and <b>forge</b> <b>welded</b> {{together}} to become shear steel.It {{would be cut}} and re welded multiple times, with each new weld producing a more homogeneous, higher quality steel. This would be done at most 3-4 times, as more is unnecessary and could potentially cause carbon loss from the steel.|$|R
25|$|The {{school is}} named after Albert G. Lane, a former {{principal}} and superintendent. It was founded in 1908 and dedicated on Washington's Birthday in 1909, as the Albert Grannis Lane Manual Training High School. It originally stood at Sedgwick Avenue and Division Street. During {{the early years of}} the school's operation, the school was a manual training school for boys, where students could take advantage of a wide array of technical classes. Freshmen were offered carpentry, cabinet making, and wood turning. Sophomores received training in foundry, <b>forge,</b> <b>welding,</b> coremaking and molding. Juniors could take classes in the machine shop. Seniors were able to take electric shop which was the most advanced shop course.|$|E
2500|$|A {{mixture of}} borax and {{ammonium}} chloride {{is used as}} a flux when welding iron and steel. It lowers the melting point of the unwanted iron oxide (scale), allowing it to run off. Borax is also used mixed with water as a flux when soldering jewelry metals such as gold or silver. It allows the molten solder to flow evenly over the joint in question. Borax is also a good flux for [...] "pre-tinning" [...] tungsten with zinc â€“ making the tungsten soft-solderable. Borax is often used as a flux for <b>forge</b> <b>welding.</b>|$|E
50|$|<b>Forge</b> <b>welding</b> between similar {{materials}} {{is caused by}} solid-state diffusion. This results in a weld that consists of only the welded materials without any fillers or bridging materials. <b>Forge</b> <b>welding</b> between dissimilar {{materials is}} caused by the formation of a lower melting temperature eutectic between the materials. Due to this the weld is often stronger than the individual metals.|$|E
50|$|The dredge suction {{mouth is}} made of one cast piece. Its flange is cast {{together}} with {{the body of the}} dredge suction mouthBy using only one cast piece eliminates many operations, such as machining, <b>forging,</b> <b>welding</b> and allows the most intricate shapes, both external and internal that can be obtained to follow the shape of the flow.|$|R

5000|$|A caulkin (or caulk; US {{spelling}} [...] "calkin" [...] or [...] "calk") {{from the}} Latin calx (the heel) is a blunt projection on a horseshoe {{that is often}} <b>forged,</b> <b>welded</b> or brazed onto the shoe. The term may also refer to traction devices screwed {{into the bottom of}} a horseshoe, also commonly called shoe studs or screw-in calks. These are usually a blunt spiked cleat, usually placed at the sides of the shoe.|$|R
5000|$|When {{mechanical}} hammers were developed, <b>forge</b> <b>welding</b> {{could be}} accomplished by heating the metal, and then placing it between the mechanized hammer and the anvil. Originally powered by waterwheels, modern mechanical-hammers can also be operated by compressed air, electricity, steam, gas engines, and many other ways. Another method is <b>forge</b> <b>welding</b> with a die, whereas the pieces of metal are heated and then forced into a die which both provides the pressure for the weld and keeps the joint at the finished shape. Roll welding is another <b>forge</b> <b>welding</b> process, where the heated metals are overlapped and passed through rollers at high pressures to create the weld.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Forge</b> <b>welding</b> is {{a process}} of joining metals by heating them beyond a certain {{threshold}} and forcing them together with enough pressure to cause deformation of the weld surfaces, creating a metallic bond between the atoms of the metals. The pressure required varies, depending on the temperature, strength, and hardness of the alloy. <b>Forge</b> <b>welding</b> is the oldest welding technique, and has been used since ancient times.|$|E
50|$|Welding {{processes}} can {{generally be}} grouped into two categories: fusion and diffusion welding. Fusion welding involves localized melting of the metals at the weld interfaces, and {{is common in}} electric or gas welding techniques. This requires temperatures {{much higher than the}} melting point of the metal in order to cause localized melting before the heat can thermally conduct away from the weld, and often a filler metal is used to keep the weld from segregating. Diffusion welding consists of joining the metals without melting them, welding the surfaces together while in the solid state. In diffusion welding, the heat source is often lower than the melting point of the metal, allowing more even heat-distribution thus reducing thermal stresses at the weld. In this method a filler metal is typically not used, but the weld occurs directly between the metals at the weld interface. This includes methods such as cold welding, explosion welding, and <b>forge</b> <b>welding.</b> Unlike other diffusion methods, in <b>forge</b> <b>welding</b> the metals are heated to a high temperature before forcing them together, usually resulting in greater plasticity at the weld surfaces. This generally makes <b>forge</b> <b>welding</b> more versatile than cold-diffusion techniques, which are usually performed on soft metals like copper or aluminum. In <b>forge</b> <b>welding,</b> the entire welding areas are heated evenly. <b>Forge</b> <b>welding</b> can be used for a much wider range of harder metals and alloys, like steel and titanium.|$|E
5000|$|Friction {{stud welding}} {{is a solid}} phase welding {{technique}} involving a stud or appurtenance being rotated at high speed while being forced against a substrate, generating heat by friction. The metal surfaces reach a temperature at which they flow plastically under pressure, surface impurities are expelled and a <b>forged</b> <b>weld</b> is formed. [...] This technique is rather more costly than arc stud welding and is therefore used for special applications where arc welding may present problems, such as: ...|$|R
5000|$|Blister steel {{that has}} been faggoted was known as shear steel; if faggoted twice, as double shear steel, if faggoted three times It was known as triple shear steel. Steel that was {{intended}} to be treated this way was carburised, causing little bubbles {{on the surface of the}} material, hence the name [...] "blister steel". It was then <b>forge</b> <b>welded</b> together to refine it and work the carbon throughout the material, instead of just on the surface.|$|R
50|$|Rather {{than being}} able to melt the iron ore into a {{complete}} billet, the furnaces of the period were only able to produce small pieces of iron, which were subsequently <b>forge</b> <b>welded</b> into a single blade. To accomplish this, the pieces would either be beaten into thin sheets that were then hammered together as a laminated blade or placed together as thin rods and then welded together. Additionally, some of these blades were constructed using pattern welding. With this method, the iron was beaten into strips, which were twisted together and then <b>forge</b> <b>welded.</b> The twisting removed much surface slag, which could cause weaknesses in the finished blade. Pattern welding also produced patterns in the finished blade, most commonly a herringbone pattern. Such patterns are often referenced in Anglo-Saxon literatureâ€”they are described using terms such as brogenmÃ¦l ("weaving marks"), wundenmÃ¦l ("winding marks"), grÃ¦gmÃ¦l ("grey mark"), and scirmÃ¦l ("brightly patterned"). Therefore, {{it has been suggested}} that the decoration produced by pattern-welding was important and desired in Anglo-Saxon society. Many blades also had a fuller, which was a shallow groove that ran the length of the blade. The fuller reduced the blade's overall weight while not compromising the thickness. Fullers were produced by hammering into the blade or chiselling out a section.|$|R
50|$|While {{examples}} of <b>forge</b> <b>welding</b> {{go back to}} the Bronze Age and the Iron Age, arc welding did not come into practice until much later.|$|E
50|$|The pillar {{appears to}} have been built using {{horizontal}} <b>forge</b> <b>welding</b> technique. Brahm Prakash theorized that smaller sections, measuring 2 ft to 2 ft in length, were joined together to form the pillar.|$|E
50|$|<b>Forge</b> <b>welding</b> (FOW) is a {{solid-state}} {{welding process}} that joins {{two pieces of}} metal by heating them to a high temperature and then hammering them together. It may also consist of heating and forcing the metals together with presses or other means, creating enough pressure to cause plastic deformation at the weld surfaces. The process {{is one of the}} simplest methods of joining metals and has been used since ancient times. <b>Forge</b> <b>welding</b> is versatile, being able to join a host of similar and dissimilar metals. With the invention of electrical and gas welding methods during the Industrial Revolution, manual forge-welding has been largely replaced, although automated forge-welding is a common manufacturing process.|$|E
50|$|Another {{way is to}} {{assemble}} the different pieces into a block, <b>forge</b> <b>weld</b> it together, and then draw out the steel into a sword so that the correct steel {{ends up in the}} desired place. This method is often used for the complex models, which allow for parrying without fear of damaging the side of the blade. To make honsanmai or shihozume types, pieces of hard steel are added to the outside of the blade in a similar fashion. The shihozume and soshu types are quite rare, but added a rear support.|$|R
50|$|Kolzam {{was part}} of the ZakÅ‚ady Naprawcze Taboru Kolejowego, which was a network of railway {{factories}} in Poland, which was based close by to the RacibÃ³rz railway station in 1858. From 1895 the factory was taken over by the Directory of Railway in Katowice. After the Second World War, the company introduced sheet metal, <b>forging,</b> <b>welding</b> and machinery repair to their products. In 1973 the company introduced machinery for railways and rolling stock, and in 1984 the company had produced mini buses and railcars. The products have been exported across Europe and Asia.|$|R
50|$|In {{traditional}} Japanese sword making, the low-carbon iron {{is folded}} several times by itself, to purify it. This produces the soft metal {{to be used}} for the core of the blade. The high-carbon steel and the higher-carbon cast-iron are then forged in alternating layers. The cast-iron is heated, quenched in water, and then broken into small pieces to help free it from slag. The steel is then forged into a single plate, and the pieces of cast-iron are piled on top, and the whole thing is <b>forge</b> <b>welded</b> into a single billet, which is called the age-kitae process. The billet is then elongated, cut, folded, and <b>forge</b> <b>welded</b> again. The steel can be folded transversely, (from front to back), or longitudinally, (from side to side). Often both folding directions are used to produce the desired grain pattern. This process, called the shita-kitae, is repeated from 8 to as many as 16 times. After 20 foldings, (220, or about a million individual layers), there is too much diffusion in the carbon content. The steel becomes almost homogeneous in this respect, and the act of folding no longer gives any benefit to the steel. Depending on the amount of carbon introduced, this process forms either the very hard steel for the edge (hagane), or the slightly less hardenable spring steel (kawagane) which is often used for the sides and the back.|$|R
50|$|In <b>forge</b> <b>welding,</b> {{the pieces}} to join are heated {{to what is}} {{generally}} referred to as welding heat. For mild steel most smiths judge this temperature by color: the metal glows an intense yellow or white. At this temperature the steel is near molten.|$|E
50|$|Many items made of {{wrought iron}} {{have been found}} by archeologists, that show {{evidence}} of <b>forge</b> <b>welding,</b> which date from before 1000 BC. Because iron was typically made in small amounts, any large object, such as the Delhi Pillar, needed to be forged welded out of smaller billets.|$|E

50|$|The corona of {{the shot}} weld should not exist on the metal, and the {{equipment}} used produces satisfactory welds with a smaller than normal diameter. Sufficient electrode {{force is applied to}} hold the two sheets of metal together and the peak current rapidly creates a <b>forge</b> <b>weld</b> at the interface between the two sheets, producing a small nugget of weld metal, which when cooled results in a shear-resistant metal interface. Good shotwelds have twice the shear strength of a rivet of similar diameter and can be placed 50 percent closer together. Distortion is eliminated, as this is an issue in fusion welding processes.|$|R
