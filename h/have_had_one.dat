5|$|Some bioethicists deem it {{reasonable}} {{for parents to}} select a child who would have the highest well-being. One criticism of this reasoning is that it often values those with disabilities less. Some parents argue that Down syndrome shouldn't be prevented or cured and that eliminating Down syndrome amounts to genocide. The disability rights movement {{does not have a}} position on screening, although some members consider testing and abortion discriminatory. Some in the United States who are pro-life support abortion if the fetus is disabled, while others do not. Of a group of 40 mothers in the United States who <b>have</b> <b>had</b> <b>one</b> child with Down syndrome, half agreed to screening in the next pregnancy.|$|E
5|$|The {{adductor}} muscle of the jaw {{appears to have}} attached to the quadrate instead of the supratemporal fenestra. Both this and the other mastication muscles were likely weak, and Nigersaurus is estimated to <b>have</b> <b>had</b> <b>one</b> of the weakest bites of the sauropods. In addition, the small, nearly parallel nature of the tooth scratches and pits (caused by grit, which would not be obtained as often by high-browsers) indicate that it ate relatively soft, herbaceous plants such as low-growing ferns. Because of the lateral orientation of the teeth, it {{probably would not have}} been able to chew. Nigersaurus wore its tooth crowns down faster than other dinosaurian herbivores, and its tooth replacement rate was the highest of any known dinosaur. Each tooth was replaced once every 14 days; the rate had previously been estimated lower. In contrast to Nigersaurus, sauropods with lower tooth replacement rates and broader tooth crowns are thought to have been canopy browsers.|$|E
5|$|The {{cutaneous}} {{manifestations of}} Birt–Hogg–Dubé were originally described as fibrofolliculomas (abnormal growths of a hair follicle), trichodiscomas (hamartomatous lesions with a hair follicle at the periphery, often {{found on the}} face), and acrochordons (skin tags). Cutaneous manifestations are confirmed by histology. Most individuals (89%) with BHD are found to have multiple cysts in both lungs, and 24% <b>have</b> <b>had</b> <b>one</b> or more episodes of pneumothorax. The cysts can be detected by chest CT scan. Renal tumors can manifest as multiple types of renal cell carcinoma, but certain pathological subtypes (including chromophobe, oncocytoma, and oncocytic hybrid tumors) are more commonly seen. Although the original syndrome was discovered {{on the basis of}} cutaneous findings, it is now recognized that individuals with Birt–Hogg–Dubé may only manifest the pulmonary and/or renal findings, without any skin lesions. Though these signs indicate BHD, it is only confirmed with a genetic test for FLCN mutations.|$|E

25|$|Some {{observers}} were surprised that Apple {{had not made}} a deal with AMD, which had in recent years become a strong competitor to Intel. AMD had recently released its competitive 64-bit Opteron platform, and by moving straight to x86-64 Apple would <b>have</b> <b>had</b> <b>one</b> less architecture transition. Analysts have speculated that AMD's lack of low-power designs at the time were behind the decision to go with Intel. However, in 2011, Apple investigated using AMD’s low power Llano APU for the MacBook Air, but eventually opted for Intel due to AMD's potential inability to supply enough Llano processors to meet demand.|$|E

25|$|The {{skull of}} a Neanderthal woman, {{discovered}} in a quarry in 1848, was only the second Neanderthal skull ever found and the first adult Neanderthal skull to be discovered, eight years before {{the discovery of the}} skull for which the species was named in Neandertal, Germany; had it been recognised as a separate species, it might have been called Calpican (or Gibraltarian) rather than Neanderthal Man. The skull of a Neanderthal child was discovered nearby in 1926. The Neanderthals are known to have occupied ten sites on the Gibraltar peninsula at the southern tip of Iberia, which may <b>have</b> <b>had</b> <b>one</b> of the densest areas of Neanderthal settlement of anywhere in Europe.|$|E
25|$|Their fourth record Meltdown, {{released}} in 2004, was the band's final record with Hatherley {{before returning to}} their original three-piece lineup for their fifth studio album Twilight of the Innocents in 2007.

In 2015, they released a sixth studio album, entitled Kablammo!. They were associated with Britpop, though as that musical movement emphasised Britishness which is a controversial state in Northern Ireland, they were not comfortable with the association.|$|E
25|$|I {{turned a}} face to him of such joy that no-one in that great crowd could <b>have</b> <b>had</b> <b>one</b> moment's doubt. I just said, Oh Tom, & he seized my hand, & said how do you do, in quite a loud voice. He walked {{straight}} on to the platform then & gave a most remarkably clever, well thought out lecture.... I stood the whole time, holding Polly up high in my arms. Polly was very excited & wild. I kept my eyes on Tom's face the whole time, & I kept nodding my head at him, & making encouraging signs. He looked a little older, more mature & smart, much thinner & not well or robust or rumbustious at all. No sign of a woman's care about him. No cosy evenings with dogs and gramophones I should say.|$|E

25|$|Since the team's {{first season}} in 1961, the Vikings <b>have</b> <b>had</b> <b>one</b> {{of the highest}} winning {{percentages}} in the NFL. As of 2014, they have won at least three games in every season except in 1962, and are one of only six NFL teams to win at least 15 games in a regular season. The Vikings have won one NFL Championship, in 1969, before the league's merger with the American Football League (AFL). Since the league merger in 1970, they have qualified for the playoffs 26 times, third-most in the league. The team has played in Super Bowls IV, VIII, IX, and XI, though failing to win any of them. In addition, they have lost in their last five NFC Championship Game appearances since 1978. The team currently has 13 members in the Pro Football Hall of Fame.|$|E
25|$|Virginia Woolf {{is taking}} her walk while {{thinking}} of ideas for her novel. She already believes Clarissa Dalloway will commit suicide, now Virginia plans for Mrs.Dalloway to <b>have</b> <b>had</b> <b>one</b> true love: not her husband, but a girl Clarissa knew during her own girlhood. Her love of another girl will have represented {{a time when}} she was not afraid to go against the destiny laid out for her by society and family. Virginia plans for Clarissa to kill herself in middle-age over something quite trivial, a representation of what her life has become and what has been repressed. As Virginia walks about Richmond she reflects on how Mrs.Dalloway's deterioration in middle-age represents how Virginia feels about being trapped in suburban Richmond when she only feels fully alive in London. She is aware she is more susceptible to mental illness in London, but would rather die 'raving mad' in London than avoid life (and perhaps prolong her years) in Richmond.|$|E

500|$|The rate {{at which}} {{concussion}} occurs is not accurately known, but {{is estimated to be}} more than 6 per 1,000 people. Those who <b>have</b> <b>had</b> <b>one</b> concussion seem more susceptible to another, especially if the new injury occurs before symptoms from the previous concussion have completely resolved. [...] There is also a negative progressive process in which smaller impacts cause the same symptom severity. [...] Repeated concussions may increase the risk in later life for dementia, Parkinson's disease, or depression.|$|E
500|$|Beyond this, the {{relationships}} between Amenhotep I and other possible family members are unclear. Ahhotep II is usually called his wife and sister, despite an alternate theory that she was his grandmother. He is thought to <b>have</b> <b>had</b> <b>one</b> son by Ahhotep II, Amenemhat, who died while still very young. This remains the consensus, although there are arguments against that relationship as well. With no living heirs, Amenhotep was succeeded by Thutmose I, whom he married to his [...] "sister", Aahmes. Since Aahmes is never given the title [...] "King's Daughter" [...] in any inscription, some scholars doubt whether she was a sibling of Amenhotep I.|$|E

The Times put Scaramanga as the fifth best Bond villain in their list, and Ekland was the third in their list of the top 10 most fashionable Bond girls.
