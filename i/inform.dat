30|$|Among <b>informed</b> agents, {{they do not}} convey {{messages}} to each other, they only release the {{messages to}} the uninformed agents who are linked to them. The uninformed agents can only receive messages from the <b>informed</b> agents who are linked to them, {{but they do not}} know whether the <b>informed</b> agents are honest. When they receive messages from <b>informed</b> agents in any period, they have the choice to believe one of the <b>informed</b> agent, which depends on the parameter called confidence in <b>informed</b> agents that is determined by the confidence one uninformed agent has in one <b>informed</b> agent based on the actions both have already taken. If an uninformed agent believes in one <b>informed</b> agent, the uninformed agent has the highest confidence, the uninformed agent will receive a messages from this <b>informed</b> agent and believe that it is true. Under the effect of this competitive atmosphere among <b>informed</b> agents, uninformed agents will preserve all of the messages released to them so they can update their confidence level in the <b>informed</b> agents who are adjacent to them. The <b>informed</b> agents also will be aware of how many uninformed agent accept his message. In each period, the payoff of one <b>informed</b> agents is the superposition of each payoff he gets from the uninformed agents he linked with. From the payoffs, an <b>informed</b> agent could learn whether the uninformed agents he linked with thinks he is honest or not. This is an endogenous and dynamic learning process that the <b>informed</b> adjust strategies through the increased or decreased payoffs.|$|R

40|$|In medical practice, <b>informed</b> consent plays a {{vital role}} in making ethical decisions. In recent years, <b>informed</b> consent also appears to be a key issue in {{biomedical}} discussion. Several definitions of <b>informed</b> consent have already been proposed. However, the socio-economic conditions of different countries are not the same. Many countries differ culturally as well as in literacy rate. Therefore, a unified concept of <b>informed</b> consent might not be justified in every context. This paper discusses the importance of <b>informed</b> consent, different views regarding <b>informed</b> consent and the limitations of applying one single idea of <b>informed</b> consent in every context. It argues that the most plausible concept of <b>informed</b> consent which is achievable for developing countries, like Bangladesh, is based on care ethics.

This article analyzes the <b>informed</b> choice discussion (ICD) between midwives and childbearing women as a form of institutional interaction that accomplishes <b>informing.</b> The ICD institutionally presumes a woman to have information needs that must be met before she can make a decision. Conversation analysis, a method commonly used to study practitioner–client interaction but little used in LIS, is employed to identify the unique “fingerprint” of the ICD. Analysis shows how participants develop a joint sense of the interactional tasks of <b>informing</b> and deciding. As an ideal, <b>informed</b> choice divides the cognitive labor: <b>informing</b> is midwife-led and deciding is client-led. In practice, however, <b>informing</b> and deciding are intertwined to such an extent that their resolution is neither automatic nor straightforward but must be negotiated. To be accepted as adequate, a decision must also be deemed adequately <b>informed.</b> Difficulties in negotiating transitions can result in one speaker treating a decision as resolved while another treats it as still open. Analyzing the fingerprints of institutional <b>informing</b> interactions can provide a starting point for analyzing the interactional accomplishment of <b>informing</b> in other settings...|$|R

40|$|The {{extension}} of <b>informed</b> consent into {{social science research}} has met with considerable opposition. The history and concept of <b>informed</b> consent, however, {{is based on a}} substantive ethical notion of the research relationship as <b>informed</b> and voluntary that is appropriate for social science research relationships. Yet social science research might sometimes be different from health research in ways that justify a different approach to <b>informed</b> consent and research relationships. Social science research tends to have a lower magnitude of risk, usually does not need to disrupt the therapeutic assumption common in health research contexts or when researchers are health professionals, and recruitment is sometimes incremental and reflects a building of trust and development of the research participant's role. These differences may sometimes justify novel approaches to the research relationship and require case-by-case evaluation to determine their relevance to establishing the <b>informed</b> and voluntary nature of the relationship through the use of <b>informed</b> consent procedures. Ultimately, respect for research participants requires social research into practices that can support or replace <b>informed</b> consent. The institutional role of <b>informed</b> consent and the goal of <b>informed</b> and voluntary research participation serve modest but important roles in health and social research. Their proper role in health and social research requires flexibility and experimentation, but does not justify abdication of <b>informed</b> consent or the notion of <b>informed</b> and voluntary participation.
