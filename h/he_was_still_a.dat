5|$|He {{began playing}} for Surrey County Cricket Club's second XI in 1977, but Surrey {{made no move}} to sign him as a player. Leicestershire County Cricket Club did however take note of Agnew's {{impressive}} performances in local club cricket and for Uppingham School, for whom he took 37 wickets at a bowling average of 8 in 1977, and signed him while <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>still</b> <b>a</b> schoolboy in time for the 1978 season.|$|E

He debuted as an amateur actor in 1977, with a school theater performance at the Agnita House of Culture.|$|E
5|$|Greaves won {{his first}} England cap on 17 May 1959 against Peru at the Estadio Nacional, scoring England's only goal in a 4–1 defeat. The tour of the American continents was not {{considered}} a success by the British media, as England also lost to Brazil and Mexico, but Greaves mostly escaped criticism in the press as <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>still</b> <b>a</b> teenager and showed promise with his performances. He scored consecutive hat-tricks on 8 October 1960 and 19 October, in victories at Northern Ireland and Luxembourg. On 15 April 1961, Greaves scored another hat-trick in a 9–3 victory over Scotland at Wembley, and also had a fourth goal disallowed for offside.|$|E

5|$|Harvey {{was also}} notable {{in his time}} for his extravagant lifestyle. The deaths {{of his father and}} elder brother while <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>still</b> <b>a</b> young man {{provided}} Harvey with a considerable fortune, much of which he squandered gambling in London. Harvey's exploits at the gaming tables became legendary, one story claiming that he once bet £100,000 on a single game of chance and lost, only to win most of it back on the following throw. Despite his dissolute lifestyle, Harvey was married and had numerous children; he was survived by six daughters and had three sons who predeceased him.|$|E
5|$|Jeter {{maintains}} {{homes in}} Marlboro Township, New Jersey; Greenwood Lake, New York; and the Davis Islands neighborhood of Tampa, Florida. He previously owned a penthouse apartment in Manhattan's Trump World Tower. Regarding his official residence, Jeter settled a tax {{dispute with the}} New York State Department of Taxation and Finance in 2008. New York State alleged that Jeter should have paid state income tax from 2001 to 2003, as Jeter resided in the Manhattan apartment he bought in 2001; Jeter claimed to have established his residence in Tampa, Florida, in 1994 and that <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>still</b> <b>a</b> resident of Florida at the time. Florida has no state income tax.|$|E
5|$|Noriega {{was born}} in Panama City, into a {{relatively}} poor mestizo, or mixed-race, family with Native American, African, and Spanish heritage. Noriega's mother has been variously described as a cook or a laundress, while his father, Ricaurte Noriega, was an accountant. Neither had a lengthy presence in his life: his mother died of tuberculosis when <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>still</b> <b>a</b> child. Noriega was brought up by a godmother in a one-room apartment in the slum area of Terraplén. Authors and journalists have suggested that Noriega {{was in fact the}} illegitimate son of his father and his father's domestic worker, whose family name was Moreno.|$|E

In 2009, he threw out the ceremonial first pitch at the All-Star Game while wearing a White Sox jacket. He is also primarily a Chicago Bears football fan in the NFL, but in his childhood and adolescence was a fan of the Pittsburgh Steelers, and rooted for them ahead of their victory in Super Bowl XLIII 12 days after he took office as President. In 2011, Obama invited the 1985 Chicago Bears to the White House; the team had not visited the White House after their Super Bowl win in 1986 due to the Space Shuttle Challenger disaster.|$|E

5|$|Sigismund {{adopted the}} title of Prince of Transylvania after Stephen Báthory died on 13 December 1586. <b>He</b> <b>was</b> <b>still</b> <b>a</b> minor, and Ghyczy {{continued}} to rule as regent. Sigismund {{was one of the}} candidates to the throne of the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth. His advisors knew that he had little chance to win, but they wanted to demonstrate that the Báthorys had a valid claim to rule the Commonwealth. Kovacsóczy officially announced Sigismund's application at the Sejm (or general assembly) on 14August 1587. Five days later, the assembly elected Sigismund III Vasa king. During the ensuing war of succession, Transylvanian troops supported SigismundIII against Maximilian of Habsburg, who had also laid claim to Poland and Lithuania.|$|E

5|$|The castle {{continued}} in the ownership of Hamelin Plantagenet's family, passing to his son William de Warenne in 1202. William was probably responsible {{for the construction of}} new stone curtain walls around the inner bailey, destroying the former earthwork defences in the process. The inner bailey was levelled and William built a hall and service buildings inside the castle, again in stone. Conisbrough was inherited by William's young son John de Warenne in 1239, but <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>still</b> <b>a</b> minor and the castle was initially managed by his mother, Maud.|$|E
5|$|The primary {{reasons for}} the Second Settlement were as follows. First, after Augustus relinquished the annual consulship, {{he was no longer}} in an {{official}} position to rule the state, yet his dominant position remained unchanged over his Roman, 'imperial' provinces where <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>still</b> <b>a</b> proconsul. When he annually held the office of consul, he had the power to intervene with the affairs of the other provincial proconsuls appointed by the Senate throughout the empire, when he deemed necessary. When he relinquished his annual consulship, he legally lost this power because his proconsular powers applied only to his imperial provinces. Augustus wanted to keep this power.|$|E
5|$|A {{native of}} Belgrade, he began writing poetry {{at an early}} age and {{published}} a number of literary reviews under a pseudonym while <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>still</b> <b>a</b> teenager. He rose to prominence during the Balkan Wars, writing about his experiences in territories newly retaken from the Ottoman Empire. The outbreak of World War I interrupted Bojić's studies at the University of Belgrade and forced him to postpone marrying his girlfriend, Radmila Todorović. The couple were separated in the chaos of war, and Bojić left Belgrade with his family and relocated to Niš, where he worked as a military censor and wrote articles for a local newspaper to pay his family's bills. In October 1915, the Serbian Army was overwhelmed by a combined Austro-Hungarian, Bulgarian and German invasion and forced to retreat to neutral Greece via Albania. Bojić and his younger brother joined the exodus, marching for several weeks through Kosovo, Montenegro and northern Albania, where they were finally reunited with Bojić's fiancée. Bojić was not allowed to accompany his brother and fiancée on a ship destined for Italy because he was of fighting age, and had to continue marching to Greece without them.|$|E

5|$|After being delisted by the Bombers, Hall was {{pursued by}} {{multiple}} clubs; he had offers from VFL sides Coburg, the Tasmanian Devils, Williamstown and Bendigo, {{as well as}} South Australian National Football League (SANFL) club West Adelaide, before deciding to sign with Devils {{because he wanted to}} come home to family and friends. Hall started the 2004 season playing as a forward and, despite moving into the midfield by mid-season, <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>still</b> <b>a</b> regular goalkicker. In June he was named in the VFL representative squad to play against the West Australian Football League, but he missed out on the match due to a hip flexor injury that sidelined him for a month. Hall finished the home and away season in fifth place in The Mercurys Tasmanian Devils Player of the Year award and in equal third place in the Devils' best and fairest.|$|E
5|$|For {{the next}} 20 years, Berg {{had no real}} job, living off friends and {{relatives}} who put up with {{him because of his}} charisma. When they would ask what he did for a living, he would reply by putting his finger to his lips, giving them the impression that <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>still</b> <b>a</b> spy. A lifelong bachelor, he lived with his brother Samuel for 17 years. According to Samuel, he became moody and snappish after the war and did not seem to care for much in life besides his books. His brother finally grew fed up with the arrangement and asked Moe to leave and even had eviction papers drawn up. After being evicted from his brother's home, Berg moved in with his sister Ethel in Belleville, New Jersey, where he remained {{for the rest of his}} life.|$|E
5|$|From his {{experiences}} on board Belgica and Gjøa, Amundsen {{had learned the}} importance on long voyages of stable and compatible companions, and with these experienced personnel {{he felt he had}} the core of his expedition. He continued to recruit through 1909; the Fram party would eventually total 19. All of these except one were Amundsen's personal choices; the exception was Hjalmar Johansen, who was taken on at the request of Nansen. Since his epic march with Nansen, Johansen had been unable to settle down. Despite the efforts of Nansen and others to help him, his life became a spiral of drink and indebtedness. Nansen wished to give his former comrade a final chance to show that <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>still</b> <b>a</b> capable worker in the field; feeling that he could not refuse Nansen's wishes, Amundsen reluctantly accepted Johansen. The party contained two foreigners: a young Russian oceanographer Alexander Kuchin (or Kutchin), who was a pupil of Bjorn Helland-Hansen, and a Swedish engineer, Knut Sundbeck.|$|E
