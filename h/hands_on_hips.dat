2500|$|Rugby writers Peter Meares and Maxwell Howell gave {{an account}} of Australia's first 1991 World Cup pool match in Wallaby Legends, [...] "The Pumas made a game of {{it for the first}} twenty minutes, rarely {{allowing}} the Wallabies any possession. Whatever scraps came Australia's way were booted downfield by Michael Lynagh... Campese hadn't touched the ball. The body language said it all. He stood, <b>hands</b> <b>on</b> <b>hips,</b> legs crossed, leaning against a goalpost." [...] Campese later recalled that [...] "...I took a breather at one stage by leaning against a goalpost. I remember being asked how I could do such a thing during an important game. It was no big deal. Argentina had already had a few scrums on our line, and they were intent on getting a pushover try." ...|$|E
2500|$|As a {{selector}} Barrington watched some 80 days {{of county}} cricket {{each year to}} check new talent and help choose the team. From 1976 he was the manager or assistant-manager in every England tour. In those days a manager led the social side of the tour with speeches and dinners, which initially caused him some difficulty, relations with the local cricketing authorities, umpires and the TCCB as well as coaching and training the side. His strengths were that he had toured these countries before, had contacts, a natural good humour and was an excellent ambassador for the game he loved. As a coach few were better at fielding practice and helping batsmen with their technique in the nets. While he did not coach bowlers so well he could guide them through the weaknesses of the opposition batsmen and general strategy. Although he often grumbled to his team and off the cuff to the English press he was always diplomatic in his official statements. He was an avuncular figure popular with the England players who held him in great respect and called him 'the Colonel', but could also tease him and [...] "eagerly awaited the traditional Barrington reaction of <b>hands</b> <b>on</b> <b>hips,</b> eyes cast {{in the air and}} a resigned shake of the head".|$|E

60|$|Strangely enough, {{you could}} smell violets, or if violets were {{impossible}} in July, they must grow something very pungent {{on the mainland}} then. The mainland, not so very far off--you could see clefts in the cliffs, white cottages, smoke going up--wore an extraordinary look of calm, of sunny peace, as if wisdom and piety had descended upon the dwellers there. Now a cry sounded, as of a man calling pilchards in a main street. It wore an extraordinary look of piety and peace, as if old men smoked by the door, and girls stood, <b>hands</b> <b>on</b> <b>hips,</b> at the well, and horses stood; as if {{the end of the}} world had come, and cabbage fields and stone walls, and coast-guard stations, and, above all, the white sand bays with the waves breaking unseen by any one, rose to heaven in a kind of ecstasy.|$|E
60|$|There was {{a village}} {{that had been}} stamped flat, till it looked older than Pompeii. There were not three roofs left, nor one whole house. In most places you saw {{straight}} into the cellars. The hops were ripe in the grave-dotted fields round about. They had been brought in and piled in the nearest outline of a dwelling. Women sat on chairs on the pavement, picking the good-smelling bundles. When they had finished one, they reached back and pulled out another through the window-hole behind them, talking and laughing the while. A cart had to be maneuvered out {{of what had been}} a farmyard, to take the hops to market. A thick, broad, fair-haired wench, of the sort that Millet drew, flung all her weight on a spoke and brought the cart forward into the street. Then she shook herself, and, <b>hands</b> <b>on</b> <b>hips,</b> danced a little defiant jig in her sabots as she went back to get the horse. Another girl came across a bridge. She was precisely of the opposite type, slender, creamy-skinned, and delicate-featured. She carried a brand-new broom over her shoulder through that desolation, and bore herself with the pride and grace of Queen Iseult.|$|E

60|$|Followed by Benjy {{with the}} saddle-bags, {{we went down}} the steps set in the levee into this strange, foreign city. It was like unto nothing we had ever seen, nor can I give an {{adequate}} notion of how it affected us,--such a mixture it seemed of dirt and poverty and wealth and romance. The narrow, muddy streets ran with filth, and on each side along the houses was a sun-baked walk held up by the curved sides of broken flatboats, where two men might scarcely pass. The houses, too, had an odd and foreign look, some of wood, some of upright logs and plaster, and newer ones, Spanish in style, of adobe, with curving roofs of red tiles and strong eaves spreading over the banquette (as the sidewalk was called), casting shadows on lemon-colored walls. Since New Orleans was in a swamp, the older houses {{for the most part}} were lifted some seven feet above the ground, and many of these houses had wide galleries on the street side. Here and there a shop was set in the wall; a watchmaker was to be seen poring over his work at a tiny window, a shoemaker cross-legged on the floor. Again, at an open wicket, we caught a glimpse through a cool archway into a flowering court-yard. Stalwart negresses with bright kerchiefs made way for us on the banquette. <b>Hands</b> <b>on</b> <b>hips,</b> they swung along erect, with baskets of cakes and sweetmeats on their heads, musically crying their wares.|$|E

5000|$|BESS. The BESS (Balance Error Scoring System) is a {{commonly}} used way to assess balance. It {{is known as}} a simple and affordable way to get an accurate assessment of balance, although the validity of the BESS protocol has been questioned. The BESS is often used in sports settings to assess the effects of mild to moderate head injury on one’s postural stability. The BESS tests three separate stances (double leg, single leg, tandem) on two different surfaces (firm surface and medium density foam) for a total of six tests. Each test is 20 seconds long, with the entire time of the assessment approximately 5-7 minutes. The first stance is the double leg stance. The participant is instructed to stand on a firm surface with feet side by side with <b>hands</b> <b>on</b> <b>hips</b> and eyes closed. The second stance is the single leg stance. In this stance the participant is instructed to stand on their non-dominant foot on a firm surface with <b>hands</b> <b>on</b> <b>hips</b> and eyes closed. The third stance is the tandem stance. The participant stands heel to toe on a firm surface with <b>hands</b> <b>on</b> <b>hips</b> and eyes closed. The fourth, fifth, and sixth stances repeat in order stances one, two, and three except the participant performs these stances on a medium density foam surface. The BESS is scored by an examiner who looks for deviations from the proper stances. A deviation is noted when any of the following occurs in the participant during testing: opening the eyes, removing hands from the hips, stumbling forward or falling, lifting the forefoot or heel off the testing surface, abduction or flexion of the hip beyond 30 degrees, or remaining out of the proper testing position for more than 5 seconds.|$|E
