5|$|Action Button Entertainment is a {{video game}} {{development}} studio consisting of Tim Rogers, Brent Porter, Michael Kerwin, and Nicholas Wasilewski that has produced five games: Ziggurat (2012), TNNS (2013), Ten by Eight (2013), Tuffy the Corgi (2014), and Videoball (2016). The group convened in 2010 as Rogers worked on Ziggurat based on an idea he had while playing Angry Birds {{that he could not}} complete on his own. Porter joined Action Button after responding to a call for artists Rogers made via Twitter, and Kerwin joined based on a connection <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>with</b> Rogers from producing a mockup of a game concept Rogers outlined in his Kotaku column.|$|E
5|$|Betances was {{the fourth}} of six children; the oldest of which would die shortly after birth; Betances was the only male among the {{surviving}} siblings. The family was described as being of mixed race in records of the day. His mother died in 1837, when he was nine years old, and his father remarried in 1839; the five children <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>with</b> María del Carmen Torres Pagán included Ramón's half-brother Felipe Adolfo, who {{was not involved in}} politics (according to Ramón) but was nevertheless arrested following the Grito de Lares years later.|$|E

5|$|Channel Orange (stylized as channel ORANGE) is the 2012 debut studio album by American R {{singer and}} {{songwriter}} Frank Ocean. After releasing his mixtape Nostalgia, Ultra in 2011, Ocean began writing new songs with Malay, a producer and songwriter who assisted him with recording the album at EastWest Studios in Hollywood. Rather than rely on samples as <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>with</b> his mixtape, Ocean wanted to approach sound and song structure differently on Channel Orange. He titled the album {{as a reference}} to the neurological phenomenon grapheme-color synesthesia and the color he claimed to have perceived during the summer he first fell in love.|$|E
5|$|Construction {{began in}} 1932, {{but due to}} a {{shortage}} of funds, the design was gradually revised and cut back, and only the Senate House and Library were completed in 1937, with the buildings for the Institute of Education and the School of Oriental Studies completed later. The design featured façades of load-bearing brickwork faced with Portland stone. Holden's intention to adorn the building with sculpture was also not fulfilled. As <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>with</b> his earlier buildings, Holden also prepared the designs for the individual elements of the interior design. From its completion until 1957, it was the tallest office building in London.|$|E
5|$|For long afterwards, Grant and Buell quarreled over Grant's {{decision}} not to mount an immediate pursuit with another hour of daylight remaining. Grant cited the exhaustion of his troops, although the Confederates were certainly just as exhausted. Part of Grant's reluctance to act {{could have been the}} unusual command relationship <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>with</b> Buell. Although Grant was the senior officer and technically was in command of both armies, Buell made it quite clear throughout the two days that he was acting independently.|$|E

5|$|George Meyer {{obtained}} {{inspiration for}} the scene toward {{the beginning of the}} episode where Rainier Wolfcastle is taunting the children from an experience <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>with</b> Arnold Schwarzenegger. He was following Schwarzenegger during a hike, and overheard him taunting his children. Schwarzenegger's influence was seen in the same scene, as he was appointed to be the chairman of the President's Council on Physical Fitness and Sports, on which he served from 1990 to 1993.|$|E
5|$|Halperin also {{explores the}} {{pornography}} industry, the Oscars, and the travails of the casting couch phenomenon. Links to YouTube videos by Halperin are given throughout the book, to illustrate encounters <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>with</b> various entertainment personalities. Halperin meets with famous actors and celebrities including Barbra Streisand, George Clooney and Leonardo DiCaprio, and asks {{them to share}} their advice with him about {{the workings of the}} entertainment industry. Halperin eventually lands a talent agent, and a role in the film The Aviator.|$|E
5|$|In {{matters of}} character, Epaminondas was above reproach {{in the eyes}} of the ancient historians who {{recorded}} his deeds. Contemporaries praised him for disdaining material wealth, sharing what <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>with</b> his friends, and refusing bribes. One of the last heirs of the Pythagorean tradition, he appears to have lived a simple and ascetic lifestyle even when his leadership had raised him to a position at the head of all Greece. Cornelius Nepos notes his incorruptibility, describing his rejection of a Persian ambassador who came to him with a bribe. These aspects of his character contributed greatly to his renown after his death.|$|E

5|$|Inscriptions from Aswan {{indicate}} that Neferhotep I {{had at least}} two children named Haankhef and Kemi like his parents, whom <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>with</b> a woman called Senebsen. He also possibly had another son named Wahneferhotep. In spite of this, Neferhotep I named his brother Sihathor as coregent in {{the last months of}} his reign and when both Sihathor and Neferhotep I died around the same time, they were succeeded by another brother, Sobekhotep IV.|$|E
5|$|Some Democrats {{remained}} unsatisfied {{with the}} outcome of the Music Hall Convention. After a period of silence, candidate William Stone publicly detailed the arrangement he believed <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>with</b> Goebel and how Goebel had broken it. Although Goebel's allies attempted to defend him against the charges, Stone's story was soon corroborated by former congressman W. C. Owens. Owens called on Democrats to vote for the Republican candidate, and to do so in such large numbers that no amount of political wrangling by Goebel could give him the governorship.|$|E
5|$|The King {{immediately}} {{proved himself}} a conscientious worker. His first Prime Minister Arthur Wellesley, the Duke of Wellington, {{stated that he}} had done more business with King William in ten minutes than <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>with</b> George IV in as many days. Lord Brougham described him as an excellent man of business, asking enough questions to help him understand the matter—whereas George IV feared to ask questions lest he display his ignorance and George III would ask too many and then not wait for a response.|$|E

5|$|When Wilson {{proposed}} {{establishment of}} a League of Nations, with the League's charter part of the Treaty of Versailles, Taft expressed public support. He was {{out of step with}} his party, whose senators were not inclined to ratify the treaty. Taft's subsequent flip-flop on the issue of whether reservations to the treaty were necessary angered both sides, destroying any remaining influence <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>with</b> the Wilson administration, and causing some Republicans to call him a Wilson supporter and a traitor to his party. The Senate refused to ratify the Versailles pact.|$|E
5|$|Wyatt Cenac had {{a tumultuous}} tenure on the show, {{revealing}} in a July 2015 interview on WTF with Marc Maron, that his departure stemmed {{in part from}} a heated argument <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>with</b> Jon Stewart in June 2011 over a bit about Republican Presidential candidate Herman Cain. However, Cenac did return for Stewart's final episode to bid him farewell and the two exchanged an intentionally awkward conversation.|$|E
5|$|Aiyer sent Ramanujan, {{with letters}} of introduction, to his {{mathematician}} friends in Madras. Some {{of them looked}} at his work and gave him letters of introduction to R. Ramachandra Rao, the district collector for Nellore {{and the secretary of}} the Indian Mathematical Society. Rao was impressed by Ramanujan's research but doubted that it was his own work. Ramanujan mentioned a correspondence <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>with</b> Professor Saldhana, a notable Bombay mathematician, in which Saldhana expressed a lack of understanding of his work but concluded that he was not a phony. Ramanujan's friend C. V. Rajagopalachari tried to quell Rao's doubts about Ramanujan's academic integrity. Rao agreed to give him another chance, and listened as Ramanujan discussed elliptic integrals, hypergeometric series, and his theory of divergent series, which Rao said ultimately converted him to a belief in Ramanujan's brilliance. When Rao asked him what he wanted, Ramanujan replied that he needed work and financial support. Rao consented and sent him to Madras. He continued his research, with Rao's financial aid taking care of his daily needs. With Aiyer's help, Ramanujan had his work published in the Journal of the Indian Mathematical Society.|$|E
60|$|<b>He</b> <b>had</b> {{attributed}} it to {{the unpleasant}} knowledge <b>he</b> <b>had</b> been forced to partially impart to her father and also in some measure to the regrettable interview <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>had</b> <b>with</b> her, but now he knew that these were only contributory causes, that the real reason was that during the months she had occupied his thoughts and in the few meetings <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>had</b> <b>with</b> her there <b>had</b> developed within him, unknown to himself, a sentiment for her that could be described by but one word--love.|$|R
