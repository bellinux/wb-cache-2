50|$|The {{storage level}} of the {{reservoir}} remained the same but the embankment crest was raised by 6.7 m, which meant replacing the B6105 road {{at a higher level}} and on a new course. An impervious clay membrane was laid in the upstream face to provide continuity with the 1877 embankment. This was protected with concrete matting faced in stone. The length of the overflow sill was reduced and a new concrete box section installed to throttle the flow, which was directed into the Etherow Pool. A replacement 1400 mm diameter <b>guard</b> <b>valve</b> was installed.|$|E
40|$|Mechanosensitive Ion {{channels}} {{are essential for}} maintaining cellular homeostasis. It has been proposed that they function as osmotically activated emergency <b>valves,</b> <b>guarding</b> against membrane rupture by opening pores to release excessive turgor pressure. Interfering with their function suggests many novel mechanisms to complement conventional antimicrobials to kill or inhibit growth of bacterial pathogens. Typical of this class of mechanosensitive channel are the large conduction homopentameric bacterial channel, MscL (MW∼ 17 kDa) and the small conduction homoheptameric bacterial channel, MscS (∼ 37 kDa) ...|$|R
40|$|ObjectivesHearts with an absent {{atrioventricular}} {{connection and}} a straddling of the solitary atrioventricular valve are rare but significant lesions. They are suitable only for Fontan-like palliation, in which atrioventricular valvar abnormalities {{play a significant}} role in determining the outcome. We studied the segmental arrangements in such lesions and clarified the valvar morphology, particularly its surgical implications. MethodsWe made a macroscopic review of all specimens with an absent atrioventricular connection and a straddling atrioventricular valve that were held in the collections of 3 institutes. We included only those specimens with the straddling valve supported exclusively by either the right-sided or left-sided atrioventricular junction and excluded those with a common atrioventricular junction. ResultsWe found 11 hearts with an absent right atrioventricular connection and a straddling left atrioventricular valve, and 3 with an absent left atrioventricular connection and a straddling right atrioventricular valve. Most had right-hand ventricular topology and discordant ventriculoarterial connections. We found multiple valvar abnormalities, including dysplastic leaflets, short cords, abnormal attachments, and abnormal papillary muscles. The most consistent features were a line of maximal coaptation between the bridging leaflets always perpendicular to the plane of the ventricular septum and a free-floating bridging anterosuperior leaflet. ConclusionsStraddling of a solitary atrioventricular valve with an absent atrioventricular connection produces a uniatrial but biventricular connection. In this setting, the <b>valve</b> <b>guarding</b> the abnormal solitary atrioventricular junction cannot be classified morphologically as mitral or tricuspid. The markedly variable valvar morphology likely makes these valves prone to insufficiency in the long term...|$|R
40|$|Introduction: The {{right and}} the left atria of the human heart {{communicate}} with the right and left ventricle through the respective orifices. These orifices are <b>guarded</b> by atrioventricular <b>valves.</b> The right atrioventricular valve is called as tricuspid valve because it has three cusps. While the left atrioventricular valve referred to as mitral valve, or bicuspid valve because it has two cusps. Presence of one or multiple accessory leaflets in the valves and absence of one or multiple leaflets in the valves is known. Data regarding shape of cusps or leaflets on cadaveric study in literature is limited. Hence, an attempt is made to study variation in the shape of leaflets of valves and the shape of accessory leaflets when seen. Shape of leaflets {{play a key role in}} designing the prototype of valves for valve replacement. Materials and Methods: A total of 120 cadaveric human hearts were dissected in the Department of Anatomy at Padmashree Dr. D. Y. Patil Medical College, Pimpri, Pune. Data were also collected from Anatomy Departments of other Medical Colleges. Variations in the shape of leaflets of the mitral and tricuspid valves were noted. Presence of accessory leaflets and their shape was also recorded. Results: Leaflets of both the valves were predominantly triangular in shape. The shape of accessory leaflets was also triangular. However, the leaflets did show variations in shape such as rectangular, D shape, semicircular. The incidence and significance of the variations in the shapes are discussed in the study. Conclusion: Atrioventricular valve leaflets show numerous variations in the shapes. Such diversity in the shapes of valves is of immense value in designing prototype of mitral and tricuspid valve prosthesis. However, this is a study done by dissection on static hearts. In life, there may be subtle changes in the shape of valves. The study should be extended further by doing observations on two-dimensional echo and transesophageal echocardiography...|$|R
