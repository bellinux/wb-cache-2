5|$|The ship {{arrived on}} 31 May {{and was taken}} into the Captain Cook Dock at the Garden Island Dockyard for repairs, with the dock's labour force being {{augmented}} with workers from the Cockatoo Island Dockyard. Two of the three armour plates damaged on 4 May were repaired, but the third had {{to be replaced by}} two 1.5-inch <b>high-quality</b> <b>steel</b> plates as there were not any armour plates of the required thickness available in Australia. Repairs were also made to the ship's machinery, boilers and electrical systems. The island was enlarged with an admiral's staff cabin and a radar workshop. Rear-Admiral Sir Philip Vian, commander of the 1st ACS, transferred his flag to Formidable when her repairs were complete.|$|E
25|$|Modern track {{typically}} uses hot-rolled steel with {{a profile}} of an asymmetrical rounded I-beam. Unlike some other uses of iron and steel, railway rails are subject to very high stresses {{and have to be}} made of very <b>high-quality</b> <b>steel</b> alloy. It took many decades {{to improve the quality of}} the materials, including the change from iron to steel. The stronger the rails and the rest of the trackwork, the heavier and faster the trains the track can carry.|$|E
25|$|Throughout the 18th {{and early}} 19th centuries, the English {{steelmakers}} produced blister and crucible steel which required specialized equipment like finery forges and puddling furnaces and cost over £50 per long ton. In the 18th century, innovations like steamboats, railroads, and guns {{increased demand for}} wrought iron and steel. The Mount Savage Iron Works in Maryland was {{the largest in the}} United States in the late 1840s, and the first in the nation to produce heavy rails for the construction of railroads. In the 1850s, American William Kelly and Englishman Henry Bessemer independently discovered that air blown through the molten iron increases its temperature by oxidizing the carbon and separating additional impurities into the slag. The Kelly-Bessemer process, because it reduces the amount of coke needed for blasting and increases the quality of the finished iron, revolutionized the mass production of <b>high-quality</b> <b>steel</b> and facilitated a drastic drop in steel prices and expansion of its availability.|$|E
50|$|Brymbo was nationalised {{with the}} rest of the steel {{industry}} in 1967, becoming a division of British Steel Corporation.

25|$|Obsidian {{can be used}} to make {{extremely}} sharp knives, and obsidian blades are a type {{of glass}} knife made using naturally occurring obsidian instead of manufactured glass. Obsidian is used by some surgeons for scalpel blades, although this is not approved by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for use on humans. Well-crafted obsidian blades, as with any glass knife, can have a cutting edge many times sharper than <b>high-quality</b> <b>steel</b> surgical scalpels, the cutting edge of the blade being only about 3 nanometers thick. Even the sharpest metal knife has a jagged, irregular blade when viewed under a strong enough microscope; when examined even under an electron microscope an obsidian blade is still smooth and even. One study found that obsidian incisions produced fewer inflammatory cells and less granulation tissue at seven days, in a group of rats, although no differences were found after 21 days. Don Crabtree produced obsidian blades for surgery and other purposes, and has written articles on the subject. Obsidian scalpels may currently be purchased for surgical use on research animals.|$|E

50|$|Downcycling, also {{referred}} to as cascading, describes the recycling of waste in cases where the recycled material is of lower quality and functionality than the original material.An important example of downcycling is the accumulation of tramp elements in secondary metals, which may exclude the latter from <b>high-quality</b> applications. <b>Steel</b> scrap from end-of-life vehicles, for example, is often contaminated with copper from wires and tin from coating.This contaminated scrap yields a secondary steel that does not meet the specifications for automotive steel and therefore, it is mostly applied in the construction sector.|$|R

50|$|Andrea Ferrara {{was born}} in Fonzaso in Italy (which {{is located in the}} {{province}} of Belluno-Dolomiti) and was an active and esteemed producer before and after his staying in Scotland (the ruins of his workshop are still in Belluno in the place called Busighel, near the river Ardo).

50|$|In 1899 and 1900, Frederick Winslow Taylor and Maunsel White, {{working with}} a team of assistants at the Bethlehem Steel Company at Bethlehem, Pennsylvania, US, {{performed}} a series of experiments with the heat treating of existing <b>high-quality</b> tool <b>steels,</b> such as Mushet steel, heating them to much higher temperatures than were typically considered desirable in the industry. Their experiments were characterised by a scientific empiricism in that many different combinations were made and tested, with no regard for conventional wisdom or alchemic recipes, and with detailed records kept of each batch. The end result was a heat treatment process that transformed existing alloys into a new kind of steel that could retain its hardness at higher temperatures, allowing much higher speeds and rate of cutting when machining.|$|R
5000|$|After 1890 the Bessemer {{process was}} {{gradually}} supplanted by open-hearth steelmaking {{and by the}} middle of the 20th century was no longer in use. [...] The open-hearth process originated in the 1860s in Germany and France. The usual open-hearth process used pig iron, ore, and scrap, and became known as the Siemens-Martin process. Its process allowed closer control over the composition of the steel; also, a substantial quantity of scrap could be included in the charge. The crucible process remained important for making <b>high-quality</b> alloy <b>steel</b> into the 20th century. By 1900 the electric arc furnace was adapted to steelmaking and by the 1920s, the falling cost of electricity allowed it to largely supplant the crucible process for specialty steels.|$|R
50|$|But {{labour-intensive}} {{heavy industry}} was never revitalized in Britain. Instead many regions including the North East were deindustrialized, {{which suggests that}} the closure was part of a broader political strategy launched by Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher to defeat the unionised working class and invest in heavy industry in low-wage economies abroad to provide higher returns on investments. A major plan to restructure steel making in the UK was created in the mid 1970s. This was based on concentrating steelmaking in the UK in five coastal locations, to allow easy import of raw materials and export of finished goods. BSC Consett was not one of the locations, despite being serviced by a well-established rail network, making <b>high-quality</b> boron <b>steel</b> and being in profit in 1980, the year it was closed.|$|R
