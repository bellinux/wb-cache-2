The space charge {{limitation of the}} submillimeter frequency multiplier devices of the BIN(sup +) type is overcome by a diode structure comprising an n(sup +) doped layer of semiconductor material functioning as a low resistance back contact, a layer of semiconductor material with n-type doping functioning as a drift region grown on the back contact layer, a delta <b>doping</b> <b>sheet</b> forming a positive charge at the interface of the drift region layer with a barrier layer, and a surface metal contact.

By repeating the sequence of the drift region layer and the barrier layer with the delta <b>doping</b> <b>sheet</b> at the interfaces between the drift and barrier layers, a plurality of stacked diodes is formed. The novelty of the invention resides in providing n-type semiconductor material for the drift region in a GaAs/AlGaAs structure, and in stacking a plurality of such BNN(sup +) diodes stacked for greater output power with and connected back-to-back with the n(sup +) GaAs layer as an internal back contact and separate metal contact over an AlGaAs barrier layer on top of each stack...|$|R

40|$|My fall 2015 {{semester}} {{was spent}} at the Lyndon B. Johnson Space Center working in the Integrated Graphics, Operations, and Analysis Laboratory (IGOAL). My first project {{was to create a}} video animation that could tell the story of OMICS. OMICS is a term being used in the field of biomedical science to describe the collective technologies that study biological systems, such as what makes up a cell and how it functions with other systems. In the IGOAL I used a large 23 inch Wacom monitor to draw storyboards, graphics, and line art animations. I used Blender as the 3 D environment to sculpt, shape, cut or modify the several scenes and models for the video. A challenge creating this video was to take a term used in biomedical science and describe {{it in such a way}} that an 8 th grade student can understand. I used a line art style because it would visually set the tone for what we thought was an educational style. In order to get a handle on the perspective and overall feel for the animation without overloading my workspace, I split up the 2 minute animation into several scenes. I used Blender's python scripting capabilities which allowed for the addition of plugins to add or modify tools. The scripts can also directly interact with the objects to create naturalistic patterns or movements. After collecting the rendered scenes, I used Blender's built-in video editing workspace to output the animation. My second project was to write software that emulates a physical system's interface. The interface was to simulate a boat, ROV, and winch system. Simulations are a time and cost effective way to test complicated data and provide training for operators without having to use expensive hardware. We created the virtual controls with 3 -D Blender models and 2 -D graphics, and then add functionality in C# using the Unity game engine. The Unity engine provides several essential behaviors of a simulator, such as the start and update functions. A framework for Unity, which was developed in the lab, provided a way to place the different widgets on the virtual console dock and have them resize correctly based on the window dimensions [...] My task in this project was to create the controls and visualizations for the data coming in from the simulator for the boat portion of the project. I wrote a class for each control window to handle the functionality of that widget. I implemented 11 widgets that make up the ship portion of the simulator. The members of the lab were each masters of their craft and I'm glad I had the opportunity to learn from them. I learned to plan strategically so I could finish this project on time. I allotted time for storyboarding, development, and refinement. In regards to animating I learned to use modifiers like lattice, boolean and build deformers. I also learned how to animate with drivers, how to use the <b>dope</b> <b>sheet,</b> and how to use the graph editor. In coding I learned to limit the chances for bugs by privatizing functions that should be exclusive to their class. I learned how to use the GIT repository to commit, stash and pull the latest build. I learned a bit of everything because I had the chance to see the entire application development process from the artwork, to the implementation...|$|E

40|$|ABSTRACT: Selective {{emitters}} {{have been}} an important research subject for crystalline silicon solar cells for decades. It is being used in production for high efficiency solar cells.

40|$|There {{is great}} {{interest}} in developing promising candidate materials for high-capacity, low cost, environmentally friendly, longer cycle life anodes for lithium ion batteries. Due to better Li adsorption properties than graphene, boron doped graphene has been {{considered to be an}} attractive anode material for Li-ion batteries. Using first principles density functional theory calculations, we investigate the effect of increasing boron concentration on the gravimetric capacity of monolayered boron <b>doped</b> carbon <b>sheets.</b> The calculations are performed for uniformly boron <b>doped</b> carbon <b>sheets,</b> BCx (x = 7, 5, 3, 2 and 1) as well as their non-uniformly doped counterparts, which are found to be energetically preferable for x = 5, 2 and 1. Our results indicate pronounced enhancement in gravimetric capacity with increasing concentration of B, up to x = 2. The storage capacity of the uniformly doped BC 2 {{turns out to be the}} highest ever reported for B <b>doped</b> graphene <b>sheets,</b> which is 1. 9 times (1667 mA h g(- 1)) that of the previously reported value for BC 3 (J. Phys. Chem. Lett., 2013, 4, 1737 - 1742). This dramatic increase in the capacity of uniformly doped BC 2 occurs because of the availability of significantly more empty states above the Fermi level compared to the other BCx sheets. Moreover, the diffusion energy barriers and open circuit voltage are found to be lower in uniformly doped BC 2, leading to better Li kinetics. For x = 1, Li binds very strongly to the uniformly doped BC and higher diffusion energy barriers are found for non-uniformly doped BC, rendering them ineffective as anode materials. Our study reveals that BC 2 is the most promising candidate as an anode material for Li ion batteries owing to its high Li storage capacity combined with low diffusion barrier and low open circuit voltage...|$|R
40|$|We {{evaluate}} the stopping and image forces on a charged particle moving parallel to a <b>doped</b> <b>sheet</b> of graphene {{by using the}} dielectric response formalism for graphene's π-electron bands in the random phase approximation (RPA). The forces are presented as functions of the particle speed and the particle distance for {{a broad range of}} charge-carrier densities in graphene. A detailed comparison with the results from a kinetic equation model reveal the importance of inter-band single-particle excitations in the RPA model for high particle speeds. We also consider the effects of a finite gap between graphene and a supporting substrate, as well as the effects of a finite damping rate that is included through the use of Mermin's procedure. The damping rate is estimated from a tentative comparison of the Mermin loss function with a HREELS experiment. In the limit of low particle speeds, several analytical results are obtained for the friction coefficient that show an intricate relationship between the charge-carrier density, the damping rate, and the particle distance, which may be relevant to surface processes and electrochemistry involving graphene.
