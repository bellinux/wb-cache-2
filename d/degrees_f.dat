25|$|Like {{much of the}} British Isles, Stornoway has an Oceanic climate, with {{relatively}} little variation of temperature and damp conditions throughout the year.. Winters are exceptionally mild for such a northerly location (just over 58 degrees north latitude); average nighttime low temperatures in January and February, the coldest months, are above 35 <b>degrees</b> <b>F</b> (2°C)., while daytime high temperatures average about 44 <b>degrees</b> <b>F</b> (7°C). Summers are cool, due to influence from the cool Atlantic Ocean; average daytime high temperatures in July and August are just over 60 <b>degrees</b> <b>F</b> (16°C). Precipitation falls mostly as rain (though snow occasionally falls in winter), and October through January are the wettest months due to frequent, sometimes intense storms from the North Atlantic Ocean, which can bring heavy rain and high winds. April through July represents a markedly drier season, when storm frequency and intensity diminish markedly. On average, May is the driest month in Stornoway, averaging under 2.3 inches (58 mm) of precipitation, while November is the wettest month, averaging nearly 5.7 inches (145 mm).|$|E

Results at the age of 15 days and 30 days are not satisfactory partly due to experimental error. However, the results at the age of 84 days are very satisfactory.

25|$|The {{rescue work}} was {{hampered}} {{both by the}} level of destruction and by the weather – temperatures were unusually high for the time of year, reaching 104 <b>degrees</b> <b>F</b> (40 deg C) in the shade. Rapid putrefaction {{of the thousands of}} corpses created a foul and unhealthy atmosphere, and adherence to the Ramadan fast caused further strain on rescue workers. Many victims also refused medical treatment, believing that to accept it would constitute breaking their fast. Rescue workers were equipped with gas masks, and quicklime was spread over areas where rescue was considered hopeless, to destroy the rotting corpses – the risk of killing buried survivors as well being accepted. Disinfectant and DDT were sprayed over the ruins from lorries and helicopters to control disease and kill the swarms of flies which were attracted to the scene. The ruins also became infested by rats from the destroyed sewer network and rat poison was spread to kill them; larger animals, such as stray dogs and cats which fed on the human corpses, were shot. Looters were also attracted to the destruction; they were shot on sight and their bodies dumped in mass graves along with those of the victims. These measures were viewed as callous and brutal by those remote from the scene, but given the scale of the destruction and the rapid infestation of the ruins by potential carriers of disease, drastic measures were necessary in order to prevent still further loss of life from epidemic.|$|E
500|$|The {{little brown}} bat lives in three {{different}} roosting sites: day roosts, night roost and hibernation roosts. Bats use day and night roosts during spring, summer, and fall while hibernacula are used in winter. Day roosts are usually in buildings or trees, under rocks or wood piles and sometimes in caves. Nursery roosts are in natural hollows and buildings (or at least close to them). They have been found under the sheet metal roofs of trappers' caches and attics of buildings. Night roosts tend {{to be in the}} same buildings as day roosts, but these roosts tend to be in different spots that are more constrained and the bats pack together for warmth. Bats rest in night roosts after feeding in the evening which may serve to keep their feces away from the day roosts and thus less noticeable to predators. Brown bats typically hibernate in caves and perhaps unused mines. Northern populations of bats enter hibernation in early September and end in mid-May while southern populations enter in November and ends mid-March. Little brown bats are true hibernators. [...] As observed in the Mid-Atlantic States during periods of warming during the winter, typically over 50 <b>degrees</b> (<b>F),</b> little brown bats emerge from their winter torpor and hunt insects that have emerged as well in response to the warmer conditions.|$|E

40|$|Thesis (M. S.) [...] Wichita State University, College of Engineering, Dept. of Aerospace EngineeringDynamic {{mechanical}} analysis (DMA) is {{the most}} preferred thermal analysis technique for determining the glass transition temperature (Tg) of polymer matrix composites {{because it is more}} sensitive to Tg measurements than other thermal analysis techniques. An interlaboratory study was developed and conducted by the American Society for Testing and Materials (ASTM) for its D 7028 - 07 test standard (Tg by DMA). The results of the study indicated that reproducibility was poor between DMA instruments and laboratories. A reproducibility standard deviation of 15. 09 <b>degree</b> <b>F</b> and 14. 72 <b>degree</b> <b>F</b> for dry Tg and wet Tg measurements, respectively, was found. Poor reproducibility of Tg measurements creates uncertainty in cases where Tg measurements are utilized. Service temperature and process control determinations may be difficult to establish if reproducibility of Tg measurements remains poor. The goal of this research was to improve laboratory-to-laboratory and instrument-to-instrument reproducibility. To accomplish this, several potential influencers of Tg measurements, such as, thermocouple positioning, dimensional variation of specimens, and temperature calibration configurations and methods were evaluated. These evaluations were the framework to the development of thermocouple guidelines and temperature calibration procedures to aid test operators in areas where the test and calibration standards are not specific. To assess whether this goal was achieved, a follow-on interlaboratory study was conducted. A reproducibility standard deviation of 7. 86 <b>degree</b> <b>F</b> and 7. 30 <b>degree</b> <b>F</b> for dry Tg and wet Tg measurements, respectively, was determined. When compared with the interlaboratory study conducted by ASTM, the follow-on interlaboratory study indicated a 50 % improvement in the reproducibility of Tg measurements was achieved with the implementation of the developed thermocouple guidelines and temperature calibration procedures...|$|R
