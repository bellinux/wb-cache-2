Nowadays {{the quality of}} telecommunication services is the key parameter in {{the success or failure}} of business enterprises. If there is no SLA between two parties, the customers can not track their rights. With SLA, expectations and responsibilities of parties will be defined. In this manner, the service providers can present different levels of services with different prices. Consequently, the revenue of companies will increase. With creating more competitive market, the performance quality of services will increment and the customers can fine service providers if they fail to deliver as promised. In this work, we design SLA for telecommunication infrastructure company’s services in Iran and the quality of service’s evaluation is provided. For this, all kinds of services, measurement equipments and management resources in telecommunication Infrastructure Company are determined.

40|$|Objectives: The aim of {{this study}} was to assess the {{validity}} of a set of European quality indicators for assessing antimicrobial prescribing in Australian General Practice. Methods: A modified UCLA/RAND appropriateness method was used to assess the validity of 30 antimicrobial prescribing indicators. An expert panel of 12 general practitioners scored the validity of each indicator for measuring quality in Australian general practice. Four quality domains were considered: monitoring antibiotic resistance, benefit to individual patients, value for money and value to policymakers. Panel members were also asked to comment on the relevance to the Australian context and proposed benchmarks for each <b>indicator.</b> <b>Key</b> findings: All panel members were in agreement regarding the validity of each indicator in each of the specified domains with exception of the indicator assessing the use of systemic antibiotics for pneumonia. The majority of the indicators and their associated benchmarks were considered valid for assessing quality in Australian General Practice, however, there were differences regarding the quality domain that each indicator was considered valid for. Monitoring quality considering individual patient benefit was the most problematic domain with respect to validity. Conclusions: This study demonstrates the validity of 30 European indicators for assessing quality of antimicrobial prescribing in general practice in a non-European setting and provides guidance regarding acceptable benchmarks for the indicators. With international concerns regarding misuse of antibiotics and global interest in prescribing quality, valid evidence-based antimicrobial prescribing indicators and associated benchmarks are an essential tool for assessing prescribing quality. 9 page(s...|$|E

In this study, the effective degradability and availability of forages were evaluated on undegraded and degraded grassland using a technique where nylon bags were incubated in sheep rumen. We found that the concentrations of organic matter (OM), neutral detergent fiber (NDF), non-fiber carbohydrates (NFC) and carbohydrates (CHO) of forage were higher (P < 0. 05) and the crude protein (CP) concentration was lower (P < 0. 05) in the degraded grassland than in the undegraded grassland. The effective degradability (ED) of NFC (EDNFC) was higher (P < 0. 05) and EDCHO and EDNDF were lower in the undegraded grassland than in the degraded grassland. The EDOM and EDCP were not affected {{by the type of}} grassland, which may explain why ED is an inadequate parameter for the evaluation of forage availability. According to an analysis of the ratio of effectively degraded N to OM and NFC, plants of the undegraded grassland can provide more digestive nutrients to meet the requirements of grazing animals compared to plants of the degraded grassland. Results suggested that it is inadequate to consider only chemical composition and effective degradability when evaluating forage availability with grassland degradation.

It is included in a group of PSI that have been proposed to compare and monitor standards of hospital care in Australia. To summarize the attributes of this indicator as a measure of quality and safety in healthcare and examine issues regarding the development process, definitions and use of the indicator in practice. A structured literature search was conducted using the Ovid Medline database to identify peer-reviewed published literature which used ‘death in low-mortality DRG’ as a quality/safety <b>indicator.</b> <b>Key</b> quality websites were also searched. The studies were critically appraised using a standardized method. A total of 12 articles was identified which met our search criteria. Most were of low methodological quality because of their retrospective study designs. Only three studies provided evidence that the quality of care gap is higher in ‘deaths in low-mortality DRG’ than in other cases. Most of the studies reviewed show that there are several limitations of the indicator for assessing patient safety and quality of care. The few studies that have assessed associations with other measures of hospital quality have shown only weak and inconsistent associations. Higher quality, prospective, analytic studies are required before ‘death in low-mortality DRG’ is used as an indicator of quality and safety in healthcare.

40|$|AIMS: Extracellular ATP modulates pulsatile {{release of}} insulin, {{glucagon}} and somatostatin by activating P 2 Y(1) receptors. The present study examines if adenosine via A(1) receptors (A(1) R) interferes with pulsatile islet hormone release. MAIN METHODS: Pancreas was perfused in mice expressing or lacking the A(1) receptor and the hormones measured with radioimmunoassay. Cytoplasmic Ca(2 +) {{was recorded in}} isolated beta-cells using the fura- 2 <b>indicator.</b> <b>KEY</b> FINDINGS: Addition of 10 microM adenosine removed the Ca(2 +) transients supposed to coordinate the insulin release pulses. This effect of adenosine was counteracted by 100 nM of the A(1) R antagonist DPCPX. In situ perfusion of the pancreas indicated two phases of islet hormone release when glucose was raised from 3. 3 to 16. 7 mM. The first phase was characterized by a brief dip followed by a peak, which was more pronounced for insulin and somatostatin than for glucagon. The second phase was markedly affected by knock out of A(1) R. The wild-type A(1) R (+/+) mice, usually lacked statistically verified insulin pulses but generated antisynchronous glucagon and somatostatin pulses with half-widths of 4 min. In the A(1) R (-/-) mice time-average release of insulin during the second phase was almost three times {{higher than in the}} controls and 30 % of the hormone was released as distinct pulses with half-widths of 3 min. The absence of the A(1) R receptor resulted in 50 % prolongation of the pulse cycles of glucagon and somatostatin and loss of their antisynchronous relationship. SIGNIFICANCE: The A(1) R receptor is important both for the amplitude (insulin) and duration (glucagon and somatostatin) of islet hormone pulses...|$|E

40|$|Several gamma-ray burst (GRB) {{luminosity}} indicators {{have been}} proposed, {{which can be}} generally written {{in the form of}} ˆ L = c ∏ x ai i, where c is the coefficient, xi is the i-th observable, and ai is its corresponding power-law index. Unlike Type-Ia supernovae, calibration of GRB luminosity indicators using a low-redshift sample is difficult. This is because the GRB rate drops rapidly at low redshifts, and some nearby GRBs may be different from their cosmological brethren. Calibrating the standard candles using GRBs in a narrow redshift range (∆z) near a fiducial redshift has been proposed recently. Here we elaborate such a possibility and propose to calibrate {ai} based on the Bayesian theory and to marginalize the c value over a reasonable range of cosmological parameters. We take our newly discovered multi-variable GRB luminosity indicator, Eiso = cEa 1 p t a 2 b, as an example and test the validity of this approach through simulations. We show that while c strongly depends on the cosmological parameters, neither a 1 nor a 2 does as long as ∆z is small enough. The selection of ∆z for a particular GRB sample could be judged according to the size and the observational uncertainty of the sample. There is no preferable redshift to perform the calibration of the indices {ai}, while a lower redshift is preferable for c-marginalization. The best strategy would be to collect GRBs within a narrow redshift bin around a fiducial intermediate redshift (e. g. zc ∼ 1 or zc ∼ 2), since the observed GRB redshift distribution is found to peak around this range. Our simulation suggests that with the current observational precision of measuring GRB isotropic energy (Eiso), spectral break energy (Ep), and the optical temporal break time (tb), 25 GRBs within a redshift bin of ∆z ∼ 0. 30 would give fine calibration to the Liang-Zhang luminosity <b>indicator.</b> <b>Key</b> words: cosmological parameters — cosmology: observations — gamma-rays: bursts...|$|E
40|$|BACKGROUND: An {{increasing}} number of young women veterans are returning from war and military service and are seeking reproductive health care from the Veterans Health Administration (VHA). Many of these women seek maternity benefits from the VHA, and yet little is known regarding {{the number of women}} veterans utilizing VHA maternity benefits nor the characteristics of pregnant veterans using these benefits. In May 2010, VHA maternity benefits were expanded to include 7 days of infant care, which may serve to entice more women to use VHA maternity benefits. Understanding the changing trends in women veterans seeking maternity benefits will help the VHA {{to improve the quality of}} reproductive care over time. OBJECTIVE: The goal of this study was to examine the trends in delivery claims among women veterans receiving VHA maternity benefits over a 5 -year period and the characteristics of pregnant veterans utilizing VHA benefits. DESIGN: We undertook a retrospective, national cohort study of pregnant veterans enrolled in VHA care with inpatient deliveries between fiscal years (FY) 2008 and 2012. PARTICIPANTS: We included pregnant veterans using VHA maternity benefits for delivery. MAIN MEASURES: Measures included annualized numbers and rates of inpatient deliveries and delivery-related costs, as well as cesarean section rates as a quality <b>indicator.</b> <b>KEY</b> RESULTS: During the 5 -year study period, there was a significant increase in the number of deliveries to women veterans using VHA maternity benefits. The overall delivery rate increased by 44 % over the study period from 12. 4 to 17. 8 deliveries per 1, 000 women veterans. A majority of women using VHA maternity benefits were age 30 or older and had a service-connected disability. From FY 2008 to 2012, the VHA paid more than $ 46 million in delivery claims to community providers for deliveries to women veterans ($ 4, 993 /veteran). CONCLUSIONS: Over a 5 -year period, the volume of women veterans using VHA maternity benefits increased by 44 %. Given this sizeable increase, the VHA must increase its capacity to care for pregnant veterans and ensure care coordination systems are in place to address the needs of pregnant veterans with service-connected disabilities...|$|E
40|$|In New Zealand, {{nitrogen}} (N) {{inputs and}} losses have increased dramatically following establishment (and subsequent intensification) of European style pastoral agriculture from the 1800 s. An indicator that could identify soils which {{are most vulnerable}} to N loss {{would be useful to}} help target management practices aimed at reducing unwanted N losses. The natural abundance of ¹⁵N relative to ¹⁴N (δ¹⁵N) in soils is one potential indicator of N loss, because during most N transformations in soils, ¹⁴N is preferentially processed and lost (e. g. via ammonia volatilisation, denitrification or nitrate leaching). Therefore the overarching hypothesis for this thesis was that pastoral soils under intensive management regimes (with high N inputs, cycling and losses) would become progressively enriched with ¹⁵N relative to soils under less intensive management. This hypothesis was tested by measur ing δ¹⁵N in soils from four forest-to-pasture chronosequences, and in archived soils from six long-term (4 – 57 year) grazed field trials with different fertiliser or irrigation regimes. Three of the forest-to-pasture chronosequences were on pumice soils where pine forests had been converted to dairy pastures. The fourth chronosequence was on a podzol soil in Northland, where native scrub had been converted to sheep grazed pastures. Surface soil δ¹⁵N on the pumice soil increased significantly from pine forests (2 ‰) to long-term pastures (4. 1 ‰). In contrast, there was no clear relationship between pasture age and soil δ¹⁵N for the chronosequence on the podzol soil. The Northland soil displayed extreme podzolization and weathering, and had been previously disturbed by gum diggers, implying results could be relatively unique to this soil. The two longest field trials were at Winchmore on the Canterbury plains, where different rates of superphosphate and irrigation had been applied for ~ 50 years. Soil δ¹⁵N increased more in treatments receiving higher rates of superphosphate or more frequent irrigation, and there were significant positive correlations between the average rate of change in soil δ¹⁵N, and total pasture production, clover production (thus N fixation) and calculated N losses. Soil δ¹⁵N was also measured in archived soils from three long-term (¹⁵– 25 year) superphosphate trials on North Island hill country. In these trials there were no consistent differences in soil δ¹⁵N between treatments. The shorter duration of the hill country trials (compared to the Winchmore trials), combined with smaller differences in pasture production between treatments and higher variability due to complex topography, {{may have contributed to the}} lack of observed differences between treatments. Indeed, slope and aspect did have a significant influence on soil δ¹⁵N with higher values on sheltered east facing slopes, and on easy slopes than steep slopes. The final trial studied was a N fertiliser trial, in which N rates ranging from 0 to 750 kg ha–¹ y–¹ were applied to hill country pastures over a 4 year period. Soil δ¹⁵N increased significantly with time in treatments receiving > 100 kg N ha–¹ y–¹, and the increase was more rapid as N rate increased. There was also a positive correlation between the rate of change in soil δ¹⁵N and nitrate leaching (p 100 kg ha–¹ y–¹). More research will be required to further test the usefulness of this <b>indicator.</b> <b>Key</b> areas for future research include: gaining a better understanding of the effect of topography and soil type on soil δ¹⁵N, and making more direct measurements of the isotopic composition of different N inputs and outputs to more clearly identify mechanisms driving changes in soil δ¹⁵N in pastoral systems...|$|E
