Specimens with different bar diameters and different grouted lengths (i. e., 5 d, 10 d and 15 d, d is the diameter of bars) are prepared for the pull-out tests. For comparison, specimens with plain aluminium alloy bars (AAB) were tested as well. The result shows that the <b>average</b> <b>bond</b> stress between plain aluminium alloy bars and cement is much smaller than that between the deformed GFRP bars and cement; thin GFRP bars tended to have larger <b>average</b> <b>bond</b> stress; the shorter the grouted length, the smaller the maximum <b>average</b> <b>bond</b> stress.

40|$|New {{models of}} {{viscoelastic}} solids at small and finite deformations are proposed that describe material failure by enforcing the energy limiter — the <b>average</b> <b>bond</b> energy. Basically, the bond energy defines {{the energy that}} is necessary to separate two attracting particles. In the case of a solid composed of many particles there exists a magnitude of the <b>average</b> <b>bond</b> energy {{that is necessary to}} separate particles in a small material volume. The <b>average</b> <b>bond</b> energy can be calculated if a statistical distribution of the bond density is known for a particular material. Alternatively, the <b>average</b> <b>bond</b> energy can be determined in macroscopic experiments if the energy limiter is introduced in a material constitutive model. Traditional viscoelastic models of materials do not have energy limiters and, consequently, they allow for unlimited energy accumulation under the strain increase. The latter is unphysical, of course, because no material can sustain large enough deformations without failure. The <b>average</b> <b>bond</b> energy is the energy limiter that controls material softening, which indicates failure. Thus, by limiting the stored energy we include a description of material failure in the constitutive model. Viscoelasticity including energy limiters can be called softening hyperviscoelasticity. We present two softening hyperviscoelasticity models for small and finite deformations. In all cases the elastic and viscoelastic responses are described by potentials with limiters, which control material softening. The models are studied in the case of simple shear and uniaxial tension. The results of the calculations show that softening hyperviscoelasticity can be used for analysis of rate-dependent failure of materials. 1...|$|R

30|$|It {{is widely}} {{acknowledged}} that inter-sheet and intra-sheet hydrogen bonding {{is responsible for}} basic chitin properties such as solubility, crystallinity and strength (Kurita et al. 1994; Kurita et al. 1990; Kurita et al. 1993 b; Kurita et al. 1993 a; Rudall and Kenchington 1973). However, out of the four hydrogen bonds (Liu et al. 2010; Hu et al. 2007; Sikorski et al. 2009; Kameda et al. 2005) identified in chitin, C(3)–OH···O–C(5) and C(6)–OH···OC {{are known to be}} responsible for the stability, solubility and crystallinity (Gbenebor et al. 2016). The <b>average</b> <b>bond</b> energy of these bonds {{is a measure of the}} intra-sheet bond strength. This bond energy can be used as a relative measure of the effect of treatment on chitin structure. Therefore, the best combination of treatment to achieve desired properties can be determined by (1) understanding the development of this bond energy, and (2) correlating the bond strength with DD. Table  2 shows the <b>average</b> intra-sheet <b>bond</b> energy. The <b>average</b> <b>bond</b> energy was found to decrease with increase in alkali concentration. It is also important to note that higher concentration of acid leads to higher hydrogen bond energy. On the other hand, samples with higher DD exhibits relatively lower <b>average</b> <b>bond</b> energy.|$|R

40|$|The {{need for}} rapid {{construction}} or replacement of highway bridge decks {{can be addressed}} by precast concrete elements reinforced with Glass Fiber Reinforced Polymer (GFRP) bars with cast-in-place joints made using Ultra-High Performance Concrete (UHPC). This thesis investigates the bond between GFRP bars and UHPC and splice length optimization to obtain narrow joints and simplified bar geometries. Multiple linear regression analyses of existing bond data indicate that the bar’s Young’s Modulus and embedded length are the most significant parameters that influence the <b>average</b> <b>bond</b> strength of sand-coated GFRP bars in UHPC: increasing either decreases the <b>average</b> <b>bond</b> strength. Linear-elastic uncracked Finite Element analysis of pull-out specimens indicates that reinforcing bars with low Young’s Moduli have highly non-uniform bond distributions along their length and so exhibit high peak bond stresses and low <b>average</b> <b>bond</b> strengths. The higher <b>average</b> <b>bond</b> strengths observed for High Modulus (HM) GFRP bars compared to Low Modulus (LM) GFRP bars is likely because the HM GFRP bars have lower interlaminar shear strength. A methodology for GFRP reinforcement design that synthesizes provisions from the Flexural Design Method in the Canadian Highway Bridge Design Code including an additional new step to determine bar splice lengths in UHPC was developed. Splice lengths and bond resistance factors for HM GFRP bars in UHPC are determined by reliability analysis to resist either bar stresses due to the factored applied moments or the mean ultimate tensile strength of the bar. A significant reduction in splice length can be achieved if splices are designed to resist the bar stresses at factored applied moments. A new resistance factor of 0. 5 for bond of GFRP bars in UHPC is also recommended...|$|R

40|$|An {{experimental}} {{investigation of}} bond strength {{and characteristics of}} Carbon Fibre Reinforced Plastic (CFRP) bars in concrete beams has been conducted at the University of Windsor. A total of twenty-eight concrete T-beams reinforced with CFRP bars was tested statically as simply supported beams. Three types of CFRP bars were used and three different parameters affecting bond characteristics were considered in the test program, namely (1) pressure induced on the bar due to support condition, (2) embedment length and (3) transverse reinforcement. Results indicated that the <b>average</b> <b>bond</b> strength of {{the three types of}} CFRP bars varied from each other and depended primarily on their surface conditions. It was found that the tensile force in the CFRP bars increased when the bond length increased, but the <b>average</b> <b>bond</b> strength decreased when the bond length increased. Confinement provided by transverse reinforcement increased the <b>average</b> <b>bond</b> strength of CFRP bars and the <b>average</b> <b>bond</b> strength varied as fc 2 ̆ 7 when other factors were constant. However, the results gave no satisfactory information about the influences of support conditions on bond strength. It has also been concluded that the expressions for development length and bond strength of conventional steel reinforcing bar provided in the CSA and ACI codes cannot be directly applied for the use of CFRP bars due to their inherent physical and mechanical properties. Preliminary expressions for bond strength of the three types of CFRP bars were developed, as well as expressions for development length depending on the types of CFRP bars.

40|$|The bond in a {{reinforcement}} concrete (RC) {{structure is}} represented by the force transfer between the reinforcing bar and the surrounding concrete. All the RC structures are designed to have a perfect bond between the reinforcing bar and the surrounding concrete. However, corrosion of the reinforcing bar in the RC members {{is one of the main}} reasons that affect the bond efficiency in RC member. The deterioration of bond in RC element leads to decrease the service life of the RC structure and may result in sudden failure. Most of the previous research focuses on repairing the corroded RC member with FRP wrapping without cleaning the corroded reinforcing bar. The present research investigated the bond behaviour of cleaned corroded reinforcing bar repaired with partial depth repair concrete, transverse reinforcement or fiber reinforced polymer (FRP) sheets. Thirty-six beam-end specimens and twenty-four lap splice beams were cast and tested under static loading. The beam-end dimensions were 600 mm in length, 500 mm in height and 250 mm in width and reinforced with 20 M bar. The test variables considered for the beam-end specimens were: four corrosion levels (5 %, 7. 5 %, 10 % and 15 % mass loss level) and compared with non-corroded bar. Also, four bonded lengths were studied (200 mm, 250 mm, 300 mm, and 350 mm). Moreover, four partial depth repair concrete were used (commercial prepackaged self-consolidating concrete (SCC 1), another different commercial prepackaged self-consolidating concrete (SCC 2), self-consolidating concrete that was mixed in place and had similar proportions to the monolithic mixes (SCC 3) and normal concrete (NC) mix design was also cast in place and had exactly the same proportions as the monolithic mixes but was used as a partial depth repair). All of the partial depth repair concretes were compared with monolithic beam-end specimen. The lap splice beams dimensions were 2200 mm in length, 350 mm in height and 250 mm in width and reinforced with two 20 M lap spliced bars in the tension zone of the constant moment region with 300 mm splice length. Also, the lap splice beams were reinforced with two 10 M continuous bars in the compression zone. The test variables considered for the lap splice beams were: commercial prepackaged self-consolidating concrete extended with 50 % of 13 mm coarse aggregate (SCC 50) was used as the main partial depth repair. It should be mentioned that SCC 50 was the same partial depth repair concrete (SCC 2) used for the beam-end specimens. Also, Three lap splice beams repaired with commercial prepackaged self-consolidating concrete without coarse aggregate (SCC 0) were also included to study the effect of coarse aggregate on bond behavior. The lap splice beams repaired with partial depth repair concrete were compared with monolithic lap splice beam. Moreover, two types of confinements were considered in the lap splice beams: transverse reinforcement and carbon fiber reinforced polymer (CFRP) sheets. Six lap spliced beams were confined with transverse reinforcement and six were wrapped with CFRP sheets. This research found that the <b>average</b> <b>bond</b> strength increased as the bar mass loss increased for all bonded lengths. As the bonded length increased, the <b>average</b> <b>bond</b> strength decreased and the corresponding bar slip increased. In the beam-end specimens, the <b>average</b> <b>bond</b> strength of monolithic beam-end specimens was higher than the <b>average</b> <b>bond</b> strength of all types of the partial depth repair regardless the compressive strength of concrete. That was mainly because of internal shear cracks at the interface between the partial depth repair and the substrate concrete. However, since there was not shear at the constant moment region in the lap splice beams, the lap splice beams repaired with partial depth repair concrete with similar properties of monolithic concrete and had higher concrete strength showed higher <b>average</b> <b>bond</b> strength than the monolithic lap splice beams. Although the partial depth repair concrete SCC 0 had higher compressive strength than SCC 50 and the monolithic concrete; it had the lowest <b>average</b> <b>bond</b> strength. That because the absence of the coarse aggregate in SCC 0 led to a decreased splitting strength and reduced fracture energy; and so the <b>average</b> <b>bond</b> strength was decreased. All self-consolidating concrete (SCC) partial depth repairs showed better bonding than the normal concrete (NC) partial depth repair. The bond strength of beams repaired with FRP sheets was higher than that of the beams confined with transverse reinforcement. The transverse reinforcement increased the <b>average</b> <b>bond</b> strength and the corresponding slip by (15 % - 29 %) and (32 % - 62 %) compared to the unwrapped beams, respectively. However, the beams confined with FRP sheets showed an increase in the bond strength and the corresponding slip by (34 - 49 %) and (56 - 260 %) compared to the unconfined beams, respectively. A multiple linear regression analysis was conducted to predict the effect of mass loss level, bonded length and presence repair concrete on the <b>average</b> <b>bond</b> strength of beam-end specimens. Also, a model was calibrated to predict the <b>average</b> <b>bond</b> strength with increasing the mass loss level of the reinforcing bar of lap splice beams.
