40|$|This study {{examines}} the coping mechanisms applied by rural {{households in the}} face of <b>fuel</b> <b>wood</b> scarcity by using survey data from randomly selected rural households in Ethiopia. The determinants of collection of other biomass energy sources were also examined. The results of the empirical analysis show that rural households residing in forest-degraded areas respond to <b>fuel</b> <b>wood</b> shortages by increasing their labour input to <b>fuel</b> <b>wood</b> collection. However, for households in high forest cover regions, forest stock and forest access may be more important factors than scarcity of <b>fuel</b> <b>wood</b> in determining household’s labour input to <b>fuel</b> <b>wood</b> collection. The study also finds that there is limited evidence of substitution between <b>fuel</b> <b>wood</b> and dung or <b>fuel</b> <b>wood</b> and crop residues. Therefore, supply-side strategies alone may not be effective in addressing the problem of forest degradation and biodiversity loss. Any policy on natural resource management, especially related to rural energy, should make a distinction between regions with different levels of forest degradation. <b>Fuel</b> <b>wood,</b> labor allocation, biomass, rural Ethiopia...|$|R
40|$|Abstract- The {{continuous}} dependency of man on <b>fuel</b> <b>wood</b> {{and service}} wood results in serious {{degradation of the}} forest in Kanker forest division. A study on the consumption trends of <b>fuel</b> <b>wood</b> & their impact on forest were carried out in Chivranj & Ichchhapur village of Kanker forest division of Chhattisgarh, and its rural environs. Results show that the villagers of Kanker are highly dependent on <b>fuel</b> <b>wood</b> for cooking purpose. In tribal village <b>fuel</b> <b>wood</b> are sold {{in the form of}} wood lots which contains about 20 - 30 kg <b>fuel</b> <b>wood</b> & averagely pricing about Rs. 110 / lots. Price value of these <b>fuel</b> <b>woods</b> varies from Rs. 20 - 30 according to their traders & <b>fuel</b> <b>wood</b> species. The rural population works under the community forest policy, but illegal harvesting in natural forests is indiscriminate and results in severe environmental degradation. This paper calls for some basic recommendations & guideline on sustainable management of these <b>fuel</b> <b>woods</b> & for reducing pressure on <b>fuel</b> <b>wood</b> consumption.

On the one hand, demand for <b>fuel</b> <b>wood</b> from common and forest causes resource degradation to the extent that collection exceeds sustainable yield. Forest degradation, on the other hand, leads to a mounting global „fuel wood crisis ‟ has been envisaged (Dewees, 1989). In addition, {{there are a number of}} other adverse consequences of forest degradation, including loss of biodiversity, deterioration of watershed management function, release of carbon into the atmosphere, soil erosion, etc. II.

Therefore, this study evaluated the sources and patterns of <b>fuel</b> <b>wood</b> and examined the rate of consumption in the study area. This was with the aim to assess the ecological implications of fuelwood consumption on species degradation. The study utilized both, primary and secondary data. Information was extracted from topographic map {{on the scale of}} 1 : 50, 000 and satellites imageries that cover the study area. Questionnaire administration, field observation and weight measurement of <b>fuel</b> <b>wood</b> were carried out. The results showed that the sources of <b>fuel</b> <b>wood</b> for domestic cooking were forest, nearby bush and abandoned farm while the sources of domestic energy were <b>fuel</b> <b>wood</b> (61. 17 %), charcoal (27 %), kerosene (10 %), electricity (1. 33 %) and gas (0. 5 %). <b>Fuel</b> <b>wood</b> for small scale industries were: forest (49. 23 %), farmland (34. 62) and fallow land (16. 15 %). The trend of <b>fuel</b> <b>wood</b> consumption was on the high side from 1995 to 2011, it was 58 % in 1995, 70 % in 2000, 82 % in 2005 and 92 % in 2010 and 2011 respectively. Many valuable economic tree species such as Triplochiton scleroxylon, Nesogordonia papaverifera, and Cordia spp. are near their extinction. Animals such as antelope, wolf and fox are going into extinction while monkey, grasscutter, hare, rabbit were endemic in the study area.

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to develop prototypes for estimating the optimal storage time and sorting of <b>fuel</b> <b>wood.</b> Drying trials employing the state of the art technology of load cell based metal frames were carried out by University of Natural Resources and Life Sciences (BOKU), METLA and Skogsforsk. A reference trial employing traditional pile sampling was carried out by VTT. Easily applicable drying models for logging residues, whole trees, stem wood and stumps were developed. A large variety of meteorological parameters can be used for model input. Parameters ranged from basic data like relative air humidity and air temperature to more complex parameters like evaporation and equilibrium moisture content of <b>fuel</b> <b>wood.</b> <b>Fuel</b> <b>wood</b> drying models can improve the <b>fuel</b> <b>wood</b> supply chain by helping the supplier find and choose those wood piles that are drier and thus with a higher calorific value for delivery. It enables supplier to deliver <b>fuel</b> <b>wood</b> which better meets the demands of the customers. Transport can be optimized by these models too. The drying models can also be used to formulate recommendations concerning seasoning of residues and optimum storage times for different assortment, species and drying conditions. An outlook on future application and further research needs was provided. Machine vision technology for sorting of <b>fuel</b> <b>wood</b> by quality and particle size, as well as for assessing the volume of a delivered <b>fuel</b> <b>wood</b> load was tested by VTT and JAMK. INFRES partners provided chip samples from all over Europe for testing. RGB images proved to work very well when identifying shapes and sizes of chips. If odd particles have the same colour as woody material, RGB images could not identify them. Measuring wood chip loads with a time‐of‐flight (TOF) camera rendered the most promising results. The average error was about 10 %.

In rural areas, overdependence on <b>fuel</b> <b>wood</b> has commonly been identified as one of the biggest threat to forestry ecosystems.
