40|$|The {{finding of}} studies into {{the factors that}} affects optimal {{performance}} of <b>galvanizing</b> <b>kettle</b> is presented in this paper. The production schedule and history of a failed <b>galvanizing</b> <b>kettle</b> for 3 -consecutively years in a hot-dip galvanizing industry was collated and analyzed. The analysis of the collated data revealed that average galvanizing temperatures for the 3 -year under review were 483. 9 °C (2003), 482. 25 °C (2004) and 482 °C (2005) respectively. The amount of flux, and dross produced in the corresponding years were 169. 15 kg and 31. 6 tons, 56. 31 kg and 10. 5 tons and 101. 14 and 18. 91 tonnes for 2003, 2004 and 2005 respectively. During these years, zinc consumed averaged 647, 334 and 446 tonnes respectively. Stochiometry evaluation of flux, and dross in a hot-dip galvanizing process determined flux required as 60 kg/year and dross produced as 90 slabs / month. The study revealed that the lifespan of <b>galvanizing</b> <b>kettle</b> is greatly reduced by temperature fluctuation, dross formation, excess flux additions and combinations of these factors. It is recommended that improved service integrity of <b>galvanizing</b> <b>kettle</b> is assured at galvanizing temperature of 460 °C, flux consumption of 0. 15 – 0. 20 kg daily and constant removal of dross at 3 - 5 slabs per day. This reduces the formation of skim lines, which leads to pits {{on the walls of}} the kettle...|$|E
40|$|The authors {{demonstrate}} {{that a single}} EMAT send-receive system {{can be used to}} measure the wall thickness of steel <b>galvanizing</b> <b>kettle</b> at their normal operating temperatures, which are in excess of 450 degreesC. The kettles are typically fabricated from 50 mm-thick steel, the steel reacts with the liquid zinc to form an alloy layer which grows slowly resulting in thinning of the vessel wall. The kettles can be safely operated until a reduction of around 40 % in the wall thickness has occurred and this normally takes at least five years. Studies indicate {{that it is possible to}} measure the steel wall thickness to within +/- 0. 5 mm and also to observe changes within the alloy layer...|$|E
40|$|In the hot-dip {{galvanizing}} of steel, process solution arise {{out of the}} preparation of the surface which given {{the current state of the}} art cannot be de-centrally processed. Waste disposal is performed by outside parties, which means that reusable materials which the galvanizing plants could make use of are lost. Membrane procedures have been selected to create integral material cycles, although in the first phase of the project the suitability had to be checked by means of test with technical facilities in the galvanizing of Genthin. It became clear that processing of the acids grease-removal solutions is not possible by means of cross-flow current filtration. The phosphoric acid present in the acidic mixture combines with the free iron ions to stop up the ceramic membranes. The covering of iron phosphate cannot be removed by impulse regeneration. To improve the regeneration capability of the stripper it is planned to modify the grease-removal solution in such a manner that the phosphoric acid does not need to be used. A regeneration of the hydrochloric acid mordant, which has a varying zinc and iron contents, is technically possible with the aid of membrane electrolysis. As a result of the danger of an increase in the level of contaminants as well as economic investment and operating costs, only the zinc should be channeled out. The low-zinc iron mordant can be used in the manufacturing of flocculents in water chemistry. The electrodialysis membrane process has proven to be suitable for channeling water cycles of rising baths. Constant low levels of saline content can be achieved in the baths, which indirectly brings about a reduction of zinc loss in the <b>galvanizing</b> <b>kettle.</b> The separated material can be put in mordant baths as a concentrate. The production-integrated environmental protection achieved thus far can be quantified for a medium-scale works as having a re-circulation of approximately 100 m" 3 /year for hydrochloric acid and 12. 200 kg/year for zinc. The large-scale technical conversion of facility is carried out by the AGUATEC GmbH when it carries out a project. (orig.)
