This technique {{is based on}} a contact molding-demolding process, that can produce number of defects such as incomplete filling, negative patterns, sticking. In this paper, microscopic imaging combined to a specific processing algorithm is used to detect numerically <b>defects</b> <b>in</b> <b>printed</b> patterns. Results obtained for 1 D and 2 D imprinted gratings with different microscopic image magnifications are presented. Results are independent on the device which captures the image (optical, confocal or electron microscope). The use of numerical images allows the possibility to automate the detection and to compute a statistical analysis of defects. This method provides a fast analysis of printed gratings and could be used to monitor the production of such structures. © 2013 Elsevier B. V. All rights reserved...|$|R

Digitization can be the solution to extend their “lives”, and digital techniques {{can be used to}} recover lost information. This task is often difficult and time-consuming, if commercial restoration tools are used for the purpose. A new solution is proposed to help non-expert users in restoring their damaged photos. First, we defined a dual taxonomy for the <b>defects</b> <b>in</b> <b>printed</b> and digitized photos.

A defect feature {{extraction}} algorithm which {{depends on the}} separation and subtraction of color image and mathematical morphology is proposed in this paper, based on the <b>defects</b> <b>in</b> trademark <b>printing</b> processes, such as smudges, pin holes, misprints, misting etc. The difference images of each monochrome are operated with morphology methods and then the defect information of high precision <b>printing</b> processes <b>in</b> colorful trademark, such as shape, boundary contour, quantity, size and location etc, are extracted and recognized with suitable structure elements.

40|$|In {{a highly}} {{competitive}} and demanding microelectronics market, reliable non-destructive methods for quality control and failure analysis of electronic components are highly demanded. Any robust non-destructive method should be capable {{of dealing with the}} complexity of miniaturized assemblies such as chip-scale packages and 3 D IC stacks. Scanning acoustic microscopy (SAM) is indeed one the best non-destructive tools for failure analysis purposes. It is also a useful technique for imaging the morphology, location and size distribution of <b>defects</b> <b>in</b> different microelectronics components. SAM can detect delaminations at sub-micron thicknesses. It {{is also one of the}} only available techniques capable of efficiently evaluating popcorning in PBGA's and is a also useful device to detect sub-micron air gaps. SAM can also be used to measure the thickness of an internal layer of material. Overall, SAM is an efficient tool for evaluating such a wide range of different <b>defects</b> <b>in</b> <b>printed</b> circuit boards, underfills, BGAs, wire bonds, discrete components, and wafers. In SAM a focused sound is directed from a transducer at a small point on a target object, as is schematically shown here. Sound, hitting a defect, inhomogeneity or a boundary inside material, is partly scatted and will be detected. The transducer transforms the reflected sound pulses into electromagnetic pulses which are displayed as pixels with defined gray values thereby creating an image. This article aims at giving an overview of scanning acoustic microscope (SAM) and explaining its operating principles and its limitations. A few examples are also given for further clarification...|$|R

40|$|Due to {{absorption}} of EUV light, EUV reticles {{are not likely}} to have pellicles for particulate contamination protection, thus even nanosize particles on the reticle could result <b>in</b> fatal <b>defects</b> <b>in</b> every <b>printed</b> die. Consequently, measures must be taken to detect and remove particles above a certain critical size that are deposited on the reticle in the course of its use. In this paper we first present the very stringent requirements that a cleaning technique must satisfy in order to be employed for EUV reticle cleaning. The main challenges consist in the capability of removing very small particles (sub- 100 nm), in principle of any type (organic/inorganic) and without damage to the reticle. We then focus on two of the techniques that we are investigating, laser shockwave cleaning (LSC) and high voltage cleaning (HVC). Both of them are dry techniques, which is a necessary requirement in view of their potential integration in the lithography tool. We finally present cleaning and damage tests results, including cleaning of 40 -nm polystyrene-latex (PSL) spheres on large areas. © 2009 Koninklijke Brill NV, Leiden...|$|R
40|$|Banding {{can be a}} major <b>defect</b> <b>in</b> inkjet <b>printing.</b> Knowing {{the visual}} {{sensitivity}} threshold of inkjet banding is therefore useful for understanding and pushing the technological limit of inkjet printing. There are many reports on the measurement of the human contrast sensitivity using self-luminous sinusoidal contrast targets. There are also reports on measuring the contrast sensitivity of sinusoidal banding on hardcopy targets. However, {{there has been no}} report on measuring visual threshold of banding defects that are characteristic of inkjet printing, which is usually not sinusoidal, despite the evidence that the visual threshold of a complex pattern {{may not be able to}} be predicted based on each of its harmonic components. In this paper, we report a study on measuring the human visual threshold of real-life inkjet banding defects. Inkjet banding samples were produced by simulating a type of actual inkjet print banding with a high quality proofing system. We simulated bandings at five different frequencies and various contrast levels and at a gray level corresponding to 25 % pixel coverage. Fifty observers participated in a visibility and objectionability test with no restriction to view distances under normal office lighting condition and under special lighting for critical proofing viewing.

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this research is}} a reduction of an adhesive stain <b>defect</b> <b>in</b> flexible <b>printed</b> circuit board <b>in</b> hot pressing process, the electronic factory. The manufacturing have been processing by sheet type of products with ninety-six pieces of flexible printed circuit boards. Causes of the problem include the before and internal hot pressing process. In process beginning times, the most right row of products between the cooling plate and the hot pressing machine has temperature 71. 2 ◦C that is higher than glass transition temperature (Tg) 60 ◦C. Those products’ temperature lead to evaporate a polyimide adhesive before hot pressing process beginning. The internal hot pressing process include the preheat times and the pressure time. In the preheat time the problem is a gap between lower and upper plate, was under specification (Under 1 mm) and leaded to adhesive polyimide stain. In the actuality this time requires temperature and low pressure that mean a gap within 1 – 2 mm (between lower and upper plate). In pressure times the hot pressing plate surface is not flat and products are pressed by insufficient force that it lead to generate an adhesive stain on flexible printed circuit boards. That force is measured by the pre-scale paper and a result, RGB color, is provided. And then color density (From standard color sample) and RGB color (From pre-scale paper) is found out the relation by Photoshop program and multiple regression theory using. The formula is applied to compare with defect so as to find out the suitable color density (Defects reducing). The solving solutions is provided including the gap reduced adjustment between cooling plate and hot pressing machine before hot pressing process, the plate adjustment within specification in the preheat time and the pressing plate polishing in the pressure time. Results of study and solving are provide defect reduction from 24. 4 percentage to 7. 2 percentage of total study product. ...|$|R

40|$|Complex fluids are {{materials}} that respond to applied stresses {{in a way}} that is intermediate between that of a purely viscous fluid or a fully elastic solid. The characterization of material properties depends upon the ability to both apply variable stresses or strains to the complex fluid and to measure the resulting response. Often the macroscopic response of these materials depends upon the microscale structure. In this dissertation, confocal laser scanning microscopy is used to analyze microscopic changes in complex fluids. We developed methods to apply the stress or strain that matches the application or environment of the material to be characterized. For instance, confocal images of the emulsion structure of fountain solution in ink exposed to oscillatory shear flow on model substrates were acquired. We found that surfactants inhibit aqueous droplet wetting on hydrophobic substrates. Without surfactants, surface coverage of the aqueous fountain solution on the hydrophobic substrate became quite high. This result is relevant to <b>defects</b> <b>in</b> lithographic <b>printing.</b> To characterize the material properties of biofilms a tunable small-scale device was needed. We developed a flexible microfluidic rheometer to apply a compressive force of ~ 200 pL volume. We used confocal microscopy to detect the deformation of a membrane in contact with a test material when compressive stresses were applied. This measurement allowed us to characterize material properties including elastic modulus and relaxation time of soft viscoelastic solids, biofilms in particular. We report evidence of strain hardening in biofilms; a result that could have implications for the understanding of clearance of biofilms in industrial and physiological environments. To understand the source of this phenomenon we applied confocal microscopy to characterize the structure of bacteria aggregated in a polysaccharide matrix. Interestingly, while aggregated bacteria and bacteria in biofilms are held together by ostensibly the same material we find their inter-bacterial distance to be quite different. Once this tool was developed the origin of strain-hardening in biofilms could be addressed. The strain-induced trajectories of individual bacteria found using image processing of confocal micrographs were analyzed to show that strain hardening occurs without an increase in volume fraction...|$|R
