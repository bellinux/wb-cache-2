40|$|Many accelerators of {{electron}} beams {{are susceptible}} to per-sistent beam lifetime disruptions, with correspondingly re-duced performance. One distinguishes between three pre-vailing explanations of these disruptions: (1) trapping of positive atomic ions in the negatively charged beam; (2) trapping of small highly positively ionised micro-objects (“dust”) in the negatively charged beam; (3) disruptions due to stray magnetic objects trapped in the magnetic field of undulators. The lifetime disruption of certain electron storage rings that employ ion-getter pump systems are attributed by most researchers to explanation (2), the <b>trapped</b> <b>dust</b> hypothe-sis.

Vegetation coverage {{is one of the}} key factors influencing wind erosion and aeolian dust accumulation. We conducted a field experiment to investigate the effects of vegetation coverage on airborne dust accumulation and evaluated effects of dust input on the contribution of nutrients to vegetation-mulched fields. Five vegetation coverage treatments (15 %, 35 %, 55 %, 75 % and 95 %) were constructed, with 0 % coverage as a control. Vegetation coverage significantly affected dust accumulation in degenerated semiarid grasslands. The amounts of <b>dust</b> <b>trapped</b> by the increasing coverages were 1. 7, 1. 8, 2. 0, 2. 1 and 2. 1 times of that by the control plot, respectively. The total accumulations reached a maximum of 2. 5 g m(- 2) day(- 1) at 75 % coverage and remained stable with further increasing vegetation coverage. The particles in the <b>dust</b> <b>trapped</b> by treatment without vegetation coverage were significantly coarser than those by treatments with vegetation. In addition, the <b>dust</b> <b>trapped</b> by treatments with vegetation contained more organic carbon, nitrogen and phosphorus content than that by the control plot.

40|$|Transitional disks are {{structures}} {{of dust and}} gas around young stars with large inner cavities in which planet formation may occur. Lopsided dust distributions are observed in the dust continuum emission at millimeter wavelengths. These asymmetrical structures can be explained {{as the result of}} an enhanced gas density vortex where the dust is trapped potentially promoting the rapid growth to the planetesimal scale. AB Aur hosts a transitional disk with a clear horseshoe morphology which strongly suggests the presence of a <b>dust</b> <b>trap.</b> Our goal is to investigate its formation and the possible effects on the gas chemistry. We used the NOEMA interferometer to image the 1 mm continuum dust emission and the 13 CO J= 2 -> 1, C 18 O J= 2 -> 1, SO J= 56 -> 45 and H 2 CO J= 303 -> 202 rotational lines.

We perform J‐band (similar to 1. 2 mu m) polarized intensity imaging of HD 169142 with VLT/SPHERE. We observe polarized scattered light down to 0 `'. 16 (similar to 19 au) and find an inner gap with a significantly reduced scattered‐light flux. We confirm the previously detected double‐ring structure peaking at 0 `'. 18 (similar to 21 au) and 0 `'. 56 (similar to 66 au) and marginally detect a faint third gap at 0 `'. 70 ‐ 0 `'. 73 (similar to 82 ‐ 85 au). We explore dust evolution models in a disk perturbed by two giant planets, as well as models with a parameterized dust size distribution. The dust evolution model is able to reproduce the ring locations and gap widths in polarized intensity but fails to reproduce their depths. However, it gives a good match with the ALMA dust continuum image at 1. 3 mm. Models with a parameterized dust size distribution better reproduce the gap depth in scattered light, suggesting that dust filtration at the outer edges of the gaps is less effective. The pileup of millimeter grains in a <b>dust</b> <b>trap</b> and the continuous distribution of small grains throughout the gap likely require more efficient dust fragmentation and dust diffusion in the <b>dust</b> <b>trap.</b> Alternatively, turbulence or charging effects {{might lead to a}} reservoir of small grains at the surface layer that is not affected by the dust growth and fragmentation cycle dominating the dense disk midplane.

40|$|One serious {{challenge}} for planet formation is the rapid inward drift of pebble-sized dust particles in protoplanetary disks. <b>Dust</b> <b>trapping</b> at local maxima in the disk gas pressure has received much theoretical attention but still lacks observational support. The cold dust emission in the AB Aur disk forms an asymmetric ring at a radius of about 120 au, which is suggestive of <b>dust</b> <b>trapping</b> in a gas vortex. We present high spatial resolution (0 ". 58 x 0 ". 78 ~ 80 x 110 au) NOEMA {{observations of the}} 1. 12 mm and 2. 22 mm dust continuum emission from the AB Aur disk. Significant azimuthal variations of the flux ratio at both wavelengths indicate a size segregation of the large dust particles along the ring. Our continuum images also show that the intensity variations along the ring are smaller at 2. 22 mm than at 1. 12 mm, contrary to what <b>dust</b> <b>trapping</b> models with a gas vortex have predicted. Our two-fluid (gas+dust) hydrodynamical simulations demonstrate that this feature is well explained if the gas vortex has started to decay due to turbulent diffusion, and dust particles are thus losing the azimuthal trapping on different timescales depending on their size. The comparison between our observations and simulations allows us to constrain the size distribution and the total mass of solid particles in the ring, which we find {{to be of the}} order of 30 Earth masses, enough to form future rocky planets.

40|$|We {{investigate}} theoretically {{the motion}} of tiny heavy passive particles transported in a plane inviscid flow consisting of two point vortices, {{in order to understand}} particle dispersion and trapping during vortex interaction. In spite of their large density, particles are not necessarily centrifugated away from vortices. It is observed that they can have various equilibrium positions in the reference frame rotating with the vortices, provided the particle response time and the vortex strength ratio lie in appropriate ranges. A stability analysis reveals that some of these points can be asymptotically stable, and can therefore trap particles released in their basin of attraction. A complete trapping diagram is derived, showing that any vortex pair can potentially become a <b>dust</b> <b>trap,</b> provided the vortex strength ratio is different from 0 (single vortex) and - 1 (translating symmetrical vortices). Trapping exists for both co-rotating or contra-rotating vortex pairs.

40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to apply a {{spectral}} reflectance approach to account for small amounts of sediment dust in occupied homes. We examined the method’s ability to predict the gravimetric weight of sediment dust particles solely from the reflectance data (400 - 2400 nm). Multivariate data analysis based on Partial Least Squares (PLS) regression was run to predict the dust loads solely from reflectance data. For both experiments use of difference index (when the <b>dust</b> <b>trap</b> background spectra was subtracted from the total measured reflectance) in the PLS analyses was found to demonstrate the best pretreatment in PLS modeling. Maps of dust distribution, based both, on the reference gravimetric and spectrally predicted weight values was generated. Reasonable explanation was provided to the calculated distribution that can be further used by decision makers to improve the indoor life quality. We conclude that this methodology (simple and rapid in-situ spectral measurements with appropriate analyses), can be employed to assess dust in both indoor and outdoor environments (in small and high dust content). This information can be used for initial decision making, improving indoor conditions, and tracking dust contamination following environmental change. ...|$|E

The start of the first event was missed but {{came to an end}} in late 2003, and the second began in February 2009, and continues as of November 2016. Since the egress of the current event has not yet been observed, it suggests a period of > 13 years if this event is periodic. Spectroscopic observations suggest the presence of a small inner disk, although the spectral energy distribution shows no infrared excess. We explore the possibility that the dimming events are caused by an orbiting body (e. g. a disk warp or <b>dust</b> <b>trap),</b> enhanced disk winds, hydrodynamical fluctuations of the inner disk, or {{a significant increase in the}} magnetic field flux at the surface of the star.

40|$|A {{pathway to}} the {{formation}} of planetesimals, and eventually giant planets, may occur in concentrations of dust grains trapped in pressure maxima. Dramatic crescent-shaped dust concentrations have been seen in recent radio images at submillimeter wavelengths. These disk asymmetries could represent the initial phases of planet formation in the <b>dust</b> <b>trap</b> scenario, provided that grain sizes are spatially segregated. A testable prediction of azimuthal dust trapping is that progressively larger grains should be more sharply confined and should follow a distribution that is markedly different from the gas. However, gas tracers such as 12 CO and the infrared emission from small grains are both very optically thick where the submillimeter continuum originates, so previous observations have been unable to test the trapping predictions or to identify compact concentrations of larger grains required for planet formation by core accretion. Here we report multifrequency observations of HD 142527, from 34 to 700 GHz, that reveal a compact concentration of grains approaching centimeter sizes, with a few Earth masses, embedded in a large-scale crescent of smaller, submillimeter-sized particles. The emission peaks at wavelengths shorter than ∼ 1 mm are optically thick and trace the temperature structure resulting from shadows cast by the inner regions. Given this temperature structure, we infer that the largest dust grains are concentrated in the 34 GHz clump. We conclude that dust trapping is efficient enough for grains observable at centimeter wavelengths to lead to compact concentrations. Peer reviewe...|$|E
40|$|In protoplanetary disks, the {{differential}} gravity-driven settling of dust grains {{with respect to}} gas and with respect to grains of varying sizes determines the observability of grains, and sets the conditions for grain growth and eventually planet formation. In this work we explore the effect of photophoresis on the settling of large dust grains in the inner regions of actively accreting protoplanetary disks. Photophoretic forces on dust grains result from the collision of gas molecules with differentially heated grains. We undertake one dimensional dust settling calculations to determine the equilibrium vertical distribution of dust grains in each column of the disk. In the process we introduce a new treatment of the photophoresis force which is consistent at all optical depths with {{the representation of the}} radiative intensity field in a two-stream radiative transfer approximation. The levitation of large dust grains creates a photophoretic <b>dust</b> <b>trap</b> several scale heights above the mid-plane in the inner regions of the disk where the dissipation of accretion energy is significant. We find that differential settling of dust grains is radically altered in these regions of the disk, with large dust grains trapped in a layer below the stellar irradiation surface in where the dust to gas mass ratio can be enhanced by a factor of a hundred for the relevant particles. The photophoretic trapping effect has a strong dependence on particle size and porosity. Comment: 15 pages, 5 figures, updated to match published versio...|$|E

40|$|Abridged) Transition disks are {{recognized}} {{by the absence of}} emission of small dust grains inside a radius of up to several 10 s of AUs. Due to the lack of angular resolution and sensitivity, the gas content of such dust holes has not yet been determined, but is of importance to constrain the mechanism leading to the dust holes. Transition disks are thought to currently undergo the process of dispersal, setting an end to the giant planet formation process. We present new high-resolution observations with the Atacama Large Millimeter/ submillimeter Array (ALMA) of gas lines towards the transition disk Oph IRS 48 previously shown to host a large <b>dust</b> <b>trap.</b> ALMA has detected the J= 6 - 5 line of ^ 12 CO and C^ 17 O around 690 GHz (434 μm) at a resolution of ∼ 0. 25 " corresponding to ∼ 30 AU (FWHM). The observed gas lines are used to set constraints on the gas surface density profile. New models of the physical-chemical structure of gas and dust in Oph IRS 48 are developed to reproduce the CO line emission together with the spectral energy distribution (SED) and the VLT-VISIR 18. 7 μm dust continuum images. Integrated intensity cuts and the total spectrum from models having different trial gas surface density profiles are compared to observations. Using the derived surface density profiles, predictions for other CO isotopologues are made, which can be tested by future ALMA observations of the object.

To this end we perform multi-fluid gas and dust simulations of discs containing low mass planets, generating simulated observations at 1. 65 μm, 10 μm and 850 μm. We show that the minimum planet mass that produces a detectable signature is ∼ 15 M_⊕: this value is strongly dependent on disc temperature and changes slightly with wavelength (favouring the submm). We also confirm previous results that there is a minimum planet mass of ∼ 20 M_⊕ that produces a pressure maximum in the disc: only planets above this threshold mass generate a <b>dust</b> <b>trap</b> that can eventually create a hole in the submm dust. Below this mass, planets produce annular enhancements in dust outward of the planet and a reduction {{in the vicinity of the}} planet. These features are in steady state and can be understood in terms of variations in the dust radial velocity, imposed by the perturbed gas pressure radial profile, analogous to a traffic jam. We also show how planet masses can be derived from structure in scattered light and sub-mm images. We emphasise that simulations with dust need to be run over thousands of planetary orbits so as to allow the gas profile to achieve a steady state and caution against the estimation of planet masses using gas only simulations.

Here we report multifrequency observations of HD 142527, from 34 to 700 GHz, that reveal a compact concentration of grains approaching centimeter sizes, with a few Earth masses, embedded in a large-scale crescent of smaller, submillimeter-sized particles. The emission peaks at wavelengths shorter than similar to 1 mm are optically thick and trace the temperature structure resulting from shadows cast by the inner regions. Given this temperature structure, we infer that the largest dust grains are concentrated in the 34 GHz clump. We conclude that dust trapping is efficient enough for grains observable at centimeter wavelengths to lead to compact concentrations.

40|$|The {{study of}} dynamic {{processes}} that drive {{the evolution of}} planet-forming disks is fundamental to understand the origin and diversity of planetary systems. This requires observations at high spatial resolution and sensitivity, which nowadays typically reveal intriguing disk substructures including gaps, rings, spirals, and shadows. This thesis investigates the capability of polarization observations at multiple wavelengths to trace the earliest stages of planet formation. In-depth radiative transfer calculations are carried out in order to link numerical simulations of dust and gas evolution in disks with their observational indicators. This approach demonstrates that measuring polarization is a powerful tool to identify the shaping effects that possible embedded planets have on the density distribution of different dust grain sizes. On the observational part, this work presents several case studies of individual planet-forming disks that were observed with polarimetric imaging by the VLT/SPHERE instrument and subsequently modeled to quantify their structure. A particular focus is the characterization of spiral and ring/gap structures {{in the context of}} dust growth, planet-disk interactions, and dust dynamics near ice lines. Furthermore, a modeling study of marginally gravitationally unstable disks is presented to study the influence of the disk self-gravity on the shape and contrast of planet-induced spiral arms in scattered light images. Additionally, it is demonstrated that polarized emission of disks at millimeter wavelengths can be caused by self-scattered thermal dust emission. It is shown that the latter is a viable method to constrain grain properties and identify dust concentrations of different origin. New ALMA observations are presented that offer the first look at a <b>dust</b> <b>trap</b> in polarized scattered light in the sub-millimeter range...|$|E
40|$|In {{temperate}} regions, eolian {{deposits of}} different natures are often pedogenically-altered and mixed with underlying sediments. The research {{reported in this}} paper identifies {{for the first time}} the presence of eolian deposits in soils of central Tuscany and investigates the characteristics and origin. Five relict, polycyclic paleosol profiles were studied. P 1 was situated in a natural <b>dust</b> <b>trap,</b> a doline on top of an isolated limestone hill; P 2 and P 3 were both situated on a limestone plateau, and P 4 and P 5 on a mid- and foot slope on schist. The profiles were sampled for routine analyses, iron forms, heavy minerals, major and trace elements, and pollen, spores and non-pollen palynomorphs. Undisturbed samples were taken for micromorphological and SEM analyses. Nine soil horizons were sampled for OSL dating. Eolian deposits were dominant or abundant in the first layers of P 1, P 2 and P 3. OSL age determinations of soil horizons deriving from eolian parent material were middle Holocene. Chemical and heavy mineral analyses indicated different possible sources, including bare slopes, alluvial fans and wide channels, coming from the nearby streams that drain the Middle Tuscany ridge and the Mounts of Chianti; marginal contribution of volcanic ashes was only found in P 1. The research demonstrated that wind soil erosion accompanied water erosion and colluvial deposition during the middle Holocene in the Elsa River basin. Pollen spectra, in particular, indicated that soil degradation occurred in an environment showing signs of incipient desertification, resulting from an increase of aridity in a land already strongly influenced by humans. Although central Italy is currently considered to be only marginally affected by wind soil erosion, a climate change, which would imply increased arid conditions, could trigger a new cycle of slope denudation, wind erosion and loess deposition...|$|E
40|$|Artículo de Publicación ISIThe {{formation}} of planetesimals requires that primordial dust grains grow from micron- to kilometer-sized bodies. <b>Dust</b> <b>traps</b> caused by gas pressure maxima {{have been proposed}} as regions where grains can concentrate and grow fast enough to form planetesimals, before radially migrating onto the star. We report new VLA Ka and Ku observations of the protoplanetary disk around the Herbig Ae/Be star MWC 758. The Ka image shows a compact emission region in the outer disk, indicating a strong concentration of big dust grains. Tracing smaller grains, archival ALMA data in band 7 continuum shows extended disk emission with an intensity maximum to the northwest of the central star, which matches the VLA clump position. The compactness of the Ka emission is expected {{in the context of}} <b>dust</b> <b>trapping,</b> as big grains are trapped more easily than smaller grains in gas pressure maxima. We develop a nonaxisymmetric parametric model inspired by a steady-state vortex solution with parameters adequately selected to reproduce the observations, including the spectral energy distribution. Finally, we compare the radio continuum with SPHERE scattered light data. The ALMA continuum spatially coincides with a spiral-like feature seen in scattered light, while the VLA clump is offset from the scattered light maximum. Moreover, the ALMA map shows a decrement that matches a region devoid of scattered polarized emission. Continuum observations at a different wavelength are necessary to conclude whether the VLA-ALMA difference is an opacity or a real dust segregation...|$|R
40|$|<b>Dust</b> <b>trapping</b> accelerates the {{coagulation}} of dust particles, {{and thus}} it represents an initial step toward the formation of planetesimals. We report $H$-band (1. 6 um) linear polarimetric observations and 0. 87 mm interferometric continuum observations toward a transitional disk around LkHa 330. As results, a pair of spiral arms were detected in the $H$-band emission and an asymmetric (potentially arm-like) structure was detected in the 0. 87 mm continuum emission. We discuss {{the origin of the}} spiral arm and the asymmetric structure, and suggest that a massive unseen planet is the most plausible explanation. The possibility of <b>dust</b> <b>trapping</b> and grain growth causing the asymmetric structure was also investigated through the opacity index (beta) by plotting the observed SED slope between 0. 87 mm from our SMA observation and 1. 3 mm from literature. The results imply that grains are indistinguishable from ISM-like dust in the east side ($beta = 2. 0 pm 0. 5 $), but much smaller in the west side $beta = 0. 7 ^{+ 0. 5 }_{- 0. 4 }$, indicating differential dust size distribution between {{the two sides of the}} disk. Combining the results of near-infrared and submillimeter observations, we conjecture that the spiral arms exist at the upper surface and an asymmetric structure resides in the disk interior. Future observations at centimeter wavelengths and differential polarization imaging in other bands (Y to K) with extreme AO imagers are required to understand how large dust grains form and to further explore the dust distribution in the disk.

40|$|The protoplanetary system HD 169142 {{is one of}} the {{few cases}} where a {{potential}} candidate protoplanet has recently been detected by direct imaging in the near-infrared. To study the interaction between the protoplanet and the disk itself, observations of the gas and dust surface density structure are needed. This paper reports new ALMA observations of the dust continuum at 1. 3 mm, 12 CO, 13 CO, and C 18 O J = 2 − 1 emission from the system HD 169142 (which is observed almost face-on) at an angular resolution of ∼ 0. 3 "× 0. 2 ′′ (∼ 35 × 20 au). The dust continuum emission reveals a double-ring structure with an inner ring between 0. 17 "− 0. 28 " (∼ 20 − 35 au) and an outer ring between 0. 48 − 0. 64 (∼ 56 − 83 au). The size and position of the inner ring is in good agreement with previous polarimetric observations in the near-infrared and is consistent with <b>dust</b> <b>trapping</b> by a massive planet. No dust emission is detected inside the inner dust cavity (R μm size). Using the thermo-chemical disk code dali, we modeled the continuum and the CO isotopolog emission to quantitatively measure the gas and dust surface densities. The resulting gas surface density is reduced by a factor of ∼ 30 − 40 inward of the dust gap. The gas and dust distribution indicate that two giant planets shape the disk structure through dynamical clearing (dust cavity and gap) and <b>dust</b> <b>trapping</b> (double-ring <b>dust</b> distribution) ...|$|R
