So-called revisionist historians are not really interested in history as a valid objective inquiry, with certain methods, goals, and lessons. Rather they are committed to a subjective use of history to propagate a particular fixed ideology, prejudice, bias, etc. Their unspoken motto is: Please don t confuse us with the fac ts!

Once the question of a possible self-reflection by the neurologist is systematically excluded, it becomes obvious that the twilight of neurosciences still contains a considerable ideological potential.

In my study, I tried to compare the coronations of Ferdinand III. (1627), of his two sons Ferdinand IV. (1646) and Leopold I. (1656) and of Leopolďs son Charles Vl. (1723). I discussed four spheres, {{in which we can}} see these events. The first one was the political sphere: after the battle on the White Mountain, Bohemia became a hereditary monarchy, so it was never more necessary for Habsburgs to deal with the Bohemian estates, when the son of the King should be coronated. But the vote of the new king was only one limitation of the King's power, another limitations, which originated from the early modem political philosophy, continued further in the baroque period. There was no responsibility to the estates, but King was responsible to the God and to this effect he took an oath during the coronation mass before the unction. When the archbishop of Prague as a consecrator was pouring the holy oil with balsam (chrisma) on the head of the King, he received the <b>Goď</b> <b>s</b> Grace like the jewish kings of the Old Testament (David, Salomon).

40|$|As {{an educated}} gentleman and naval officer, Richard Brothers {{dramatically}} altered eighteenth-century expectations {{and perceptions of}} what prophets were {{and the nature of}} prophecy itself. The messianic messages delivered to Londoners by the self-styled prophet are central to the religious politics and culture of the 1790 s, mockingly referred to by one contemporary critic as the age of prophecy. Brothers s prophetic utterances {{came to the attention of}} the British Government, which culminated in his arrest for treason in March 1795 when he became a cause célèbre, before being confined to an asylum for eleven years. The Paddington Prophet is the first book-length study which probes deep under the skin of Brothers s apparently idiosyncratic writings and religious enthusiasm. A close textual analysis of Brothers s writings show the extent to which his Biblical, prophetic imagination arose out of the same rich theological, political and cultural context that spurred radicals like Tom Paine whilst inspiring poets and artists such as William Blake. Brothers s claim to literally restore the Jews to their homeland and his visionary hopes for a renewed Jerusalem formed part of an effective riposte to the London of William Pitt s administration. This Mosaic vision and Hebraic rhetoric permeates all of his work and was channelled into perfecting an alternative plan of the estate : <b>God</b> <b>s</b> own city, Jerusalem.

40|$|The {{research}} question explored {{in this thesis}} concerns how globalization affects the missional journey of the Wycliffe Global Alliance (WGA) and how this is influenced by paradigm shift theory applied to the missio Dei. Together, these contribute to a theoretical model for a new paradigm for global mission leadership. The research is conducted through a qualitative enquiry of the journey of WGA. Its journey involves 100 + organizations from over 60 nations. These factors influence how WGA is developing leadership with a global mission mindset. Unique factors that inform the research and its methodologies include literature reviews, an analysis of WGA s practices and processes, and case studies from within WGA. These include its missiological consultative processes, {{as well as a}} grounded theory investigation of WGA s leadership team s personal leadership philosophies. Important concepts that enlighten and enrich the study include: missio Dei and missional, globalization, and paradigm theory. Each contributes to understanding the journey of WGA. Furthermore, the journey is influenced by other ideas including the generous funding of <b>God</b> <b>s</b> mission; and the influences of spirituality, friendship, community and polycentrism in global mission leadership. The research draws from broad sources and is presented through missiological and theological perspectives. The findings inform the paradigm, which is described with phrases, concepts and themes derived from the entire research. The paradigm also informs missional movements and organizational structures that can become global in their viewpoint and actions.

40|$|Social {{space is}} {{produced}} by societies according to the spatial practices that exist within the society. The produced space {{is a set of}} relations between objects within the space. The set of economic relations, for example, corresponds to space in which manufacturing and trade can take place while the set of political relations characterizes the space in which governments operate. Theology is also a relation that exists within a societyʼs space, but the space it defines is not well studied and the nature of theological space is not well understood. In some cases, theology is the dominant factor in the production of the space within which a community interacts. The relative importance of theology to its concomitant space is expressed by the architecture, icons, and symbols produced by the society. This research studies the nature of theological space and its production by examining the spatial practices of the religious sect known as the Shakers. This 19 th century millennial sect worked to establish heaven on earth, building 2 communities across the northeastern and Midwestern United States. These early planned communities were built according to the precepts of the Shaker theology. Their theology was centered in their belief that the Shaker villages would be the locus of <b>God</b> <b>s</b> ̓ kingdom on earth. The Shakers produced their space by regulating the appearance of their villages— by conforming the village layout and architecture to the precepts of their theology and by reinforcing the tenets of their theology by restricting contact between the sect s ̓ members and citizens of the world at large—and through the way they drew and used maps and religious art...|$|E

Buscou promover uma relação entre a poesia de Murilo Mendes e mística cristã, focando em uma leitura interpretativa da sua poesia onde se afirmam não apenas a qualidade da sua poesia, mas sua leitura do humano e do divino. A poesia de Murilo Mendes que abundantemente trata de Deus, da Palavra de Deus, da religiosidade, do cristianismo e da Pessoa de Jesus marcou a temática humana a partir da abordagem pelo universo literário. Constatamos a urgência da redescoberta da mística para uma vivência mais comprometida com o Reino de Deus para sair da inércia e mergulhar no mistério, tomar consciência que precisamos da presença amorosa do Cristo no nosso no cotidiano para enfrentar com ternura, porém, com firmeza, os desafios que a modernidade nos impõeThe {{following}} dissertation has as {{an objective}} {{to contribute to}} the theological thinking on the already existing dialogue between Theology and Literature.

Nos seus elementos litúrgicos, estas pessoas se viam como sacerdotes de Deus, membros do seu reino, participantes do seu culto {{celestial}} e com dignidade exa ltada como a dos anjos do céu. Alguns elementos identitários, entretanto, não são compartilhados plenamente entre João e suas comunidades. O autor de Apocalipse possui altas demandas ascéticas e sectárias que o afastam não apenas da sociedade mais ampla, mas de qualquer irmão que tenha uma posição divergente. Ele enxerga o mundo mergulhado num conflito entre o Dragão e o Cordeiro, conflito esse que será vencido com a participação de 144. 000 guerreiros através da prática do martírio. Esta tradição da guerra santa insere no Apocalipse o potencial de isolar sectariamente a audiência da sociedade e de outros grupos religiosos. (AU) The {{analysis of}} Revelation 4. 1 - 5 has disclosed several assertions that portrays {{the identity of}} John and his audience {{as well as the}} way they conceived the world. In their liturgical elements these people saw themselves as <b>God</b> <b>s</b> priests, members of His Kingdom, participants of His celestial worship with the same exalted dignity of the angels in heaven. However, some of these identifying elements are not entirely shared by John and his communities. The writer of Revelation possesses high ascetic and sectarian demands which keep him away, not only from the society at large but from the brethren who do not share the same opinion. John sees the world immersed into a conflict between the Dragon and the Lamb, a conflict which will be conquered with the participation of the 144. 000 warriors through the practice of martyrdom. This ideology of the holy war inserts in the Book of Revelation the potential of isolating, in a sectarian way, the audience of the society and of other religious groups. (AU...|$|E
40|$|In recent decades, growing {{academic}} {{attention has}} been paid to the Christian Zionist movement. Christian Zionism represents the theological position of Christian that support the modern Israeli state and believe that this state will play a central role before the return of Jesus. Most of the research on Christian Zionism, as well as media comments, has focused on its apocalyptic aspects and its influence on foreign policy making in the USA. However, Christian Zionism is a global movement that is highly active also inside of the Israeli state. This thesis argues that more attention should be paid to how organizations, from the Christian Zionist movement, strategically work to settle Jews in Israel. By assisting in Jewish migration, these organizations attempts to restore the Promised Land with the hope of restoring Israel back to its biblical borders. By taking the onset in one Christian Zionist organization, the International Christian Embassy Jerusalem (ICEJ), the aim of this thesis is to explore the strategies used in order to bring Jews to Israel, but also the effects and potential consequences this might have. The ICEJ has been active in assisting Jewish migration from the early 1990 s and has helped more than 115, 000 (2014) Jews move to Israel. The empirical foundation of this thesis is based on position statements, reports and articles published by the ICEJ. This material has proved the organization adapts a pragmatic approach in order to influence the Israeli society. By assisting in Jewish migration to Israel, the ICEJ has actively positioned itself in a central role in <b>God</b> <b>s</b> providential plan. However, the Israeli-Palestinian conflict is understood as a threat to the Jewish character of Israel, by the ICEJ. Therefore, the ICEJ is active in advocating for Israel in the international community. Through advocacy and by assisting Jews to Israel, the ICEJ hopes to preserve the Jewish character. The ICEJ s work, as part of the Christian Zionist movement, has become a forceful actor inside Israel and also on a global scale. The impact the Christian Zionist movement has on the Israeli-Palestinian conflict should not be underestimated...|$|E

40|$|UnrestrictedWe {{examined}} whether {{enhancing the}} standard pre-takeoff announcement with supplemental information {{that explains the}} basics of turbulence and the aircraft s ability to safely withstand it will favorably affect air travelers reactions to a severely turbulent flight. With help of the Articulated Thoughts in Simulated Situations (ATSS) paradigm, participants boarded a plane as passengers, heard either a standard or enhanced pre-flight announcement, experienced either an uneventful or a very turbulent flight, and then landed safely. Compared to the calm, the turbulent flight resulted in greater articulations of anxiety, negative outcome expectancies, pleas for <b>God</b> <b>s</b> help, appeals for explanation, and relief about landing, all regardless of the announcement type, the passengers pre-existing fear of flying (QAF), their state anxiety (STAI-S) {{at the time of}} boarding or the extent of their past air travels.; Land-based transportation and not airplanes was the most preferred means of travel. Additionally, neither the number of previous flights nor the pre-existing fear of flying was instrumental in the passengers' ATSS responses to turbulence. The latter, however, significantly correlated with several variables. While decisions to fly in the future significantly depended on satisfaction with the most recent flight, the latter was exclusively a function of the in-the-moment (ATSS) cognitive reactions to turbulence and not of any questionnaire-based variables. That is, it wasn't just encountering turbulence but the passengers' particular cognitive reactions to it that was a decisive factor. Specifically, greater articulated anxiety and negative outcome expectancies during the turbulent flight led to reduction in satisfaction with it and, consequently, the diminished likelihood of flying again. Therefore, it appears that any efforts to improve the passengers’ experience, particularly if turbulence is forecast, should focus specifically on alleviation of their anxious thoughts and negative outcome expectancies. We conclude that such informational enhancement will likely be most effective if delivered during the actual turbulent encounter and not before the flight. The think-aloud data gathered via the ATSS seemed to be more informative than those of either questionnaires (QAF and STAI-S). We thus encourage continued utilization of the paradigm in this line of research as a reliable and practical alternative to other approaches...|$|E
40|$|The {{presence}} of the small Jewish Community of Hebron in the southern West Bank, counting approximately 500 members amid a city inhabited by some 120, 000 Palestinians, is highly disputed. Based on data collected through interviews {{with members of the}} community, in addition to their publications, this thesis strives towards an understanding of the fundamental incentive for the very {{presence of}} the community. The primary question posed is whether the presence and the consequent actions of the Jewish Community of Hebron is based on an assumption of obligations towards Hebron as a sacred place; is the community a consequence of something as a perceived obligation {{in order to protect the}} sanctity of Hebron? The Jewish Community of Hebron answers to these questions by maintaining that Hebron embraces the roots of the Jewish people and that Hebron additionally is the second holiest city within their interpretation of Jewish theology. These claims are supported with references to elements in the religious scriptures of both the Tanakh and the Zohar. The Jewish Community of Hebron was first attempted founded in 1968 by a group of radical religious Zionists, who were representatives of a religious Zionist movement that came to the fore in the wake of the Six-Day War and advocated active settlement in the West Bank. Since then, the Jewish Community of Hebron has expanded both territorially and demographically. Today, this nationalist, religious Zionist community has ramified into embracing several radical groups, including groups endorsing explicit anti-Arab sentiment, and condoning violence. The religious worldview of the Jewish Community of Hebron is at large within a messianic framework, based on the three fundamental assumptions; firstly, the intrinsic sanctity of the Land of Israel, secondly, the sanctity of the Jewish People, and thirdly, that current times is the Age of Redemption. Within the Age of Redemption, the people and the land must be united. As man plays an active part in <b>God</b> <b>s</b> divine scheme, they are obliged to settle in their divinely given land. The Jewish People is thus acting as part of the divine scheme leading to the ultimate re-establishment of the messianic kingdom on earth. They are obliged to push forward the Age of Redemption.

40|$|The study uses {{transitional}} justice {{to explore the}} role of the Dutch Reformed Church in South Africa during processes of societal change and compares it with the Chilean Catholic Church during processes of societal change in Chile. A descriptive approach to Christian ethics is applied, and {{transitional justice}} is used as a theoretical instrument by means of which the comparison with the Chilean Catholic Church is systematised and focussed. Despite not applying the conventional normative approach to Christian ethics it seeks to contribute to the discipline by investigating the structure of Christian communities engagement in processes of political transition. The study is inductive {{in the sense that it}} uses transitional justice as an instrument by means of which to identify emerging themes. Transitional justice is a useful instrument as it encompasses both judicial and non-judicial elements. The Chilean Cathollic Church was chosen due to a number of reasons. The first is historical proximity: the Chilean totalitarian regime came to an end shortly before the end of apartheid regime of South Africa. The second is key socio-political correspondences, including importantly that Chile instituted a national truth and reconciliation commission from which South Africa drew much inspiration. Both churches utilized their structures in order to serve a struggling community. The difference came when the Dutch Reformed Church chose for the upliftment of a single ethnic group, namely the Afrikaner, and the Chilean Catholic Church kept the whole Chilean society in view. A second differing and defining factor was the Dutch Reformed Church aligning with a political party and a political ideology. In the context of the Dutch Reformed Church the focus on a single ethnic group lead to the development of an ideology based on the idea that the Afrikaner was predestined by God to bring <b>God</b> <b>s</b> light to Africa. The idea of predestination later developed into a pseudo-gospel where the members of this group believed that racial differentiation was a prerequisite for salvation. The pseudo-gospel, in the Dutch Reformed Church later influenced the church s comments on and suggestions regarding legislation such as mixed marriages, border control, geographical settlement and voting rights. The ecclesial reflection of the Chilean Catholic Church, on the other hand, resulted in a church focused on ministering to the needs of a greater society struggling under a dictatorship. The community suffered ubductions, unfair labour practices, poverty, torture and harsh living conditions. The Chilean Catholic Church ministered to these needs by establishing offices around the country rendering free social, welfare and judicial services. The Chilean Catholic Church further endeavoured to bring opposition parties into talks to end the time of the military dictatorship.
