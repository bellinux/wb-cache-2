40|$|Background: Women {{represent}} 15 % {{of practicing}} general surgeons. <b>Gender-based</b> <b>discrimination</b> has been implicated as discouraging women from surgery. We {{sought to determine}} women’s perceptions of <b>gender-based</b> <b>discrimination</b> in the surgical training and working environment. Methods: Following IRB approval, we fielded a pilot survey measuring perceptions and impact of <b>gender-based</b> <b>discrimination</b> in medical school, residency training, and surgical practice. It was sent electronically to 1, 065 individual members of the Association of Women Surgeons. Results: We received 334 responses from medical students, residents, and practicing physicians with {{a response rate of}} 31 %. Eighty-seven percent experienced <b>gender-based</b> <b>discrimination</b> in medical school, 88 % in residency, and 91 % in practice. Perceived sources of <b>gender-based</b> <b>discrimination</b> included superiors, physician peers, clinical support staff, and patients, with 40 % emanating from women and 60 % from men. Conclusions: The majority of responses indicated perceived <b>gender-based</b> <b>discrimination</b> during medical school, residency, and practice. <b>Gender-based</b> <b>discrimination</b> comes from both sexes and has a significant impact on women surgeons...|$|R

OBJECTIVE: To examine the prevalence of <b>gender-based</b> <b>discrimination</b> {{and sexual harassment}} among medical school faculty and the associations of <b>gender-based</b> <b>discrimination</b> with number of publications, career satisfaction, and perceptions of career advancement. DESIGN: A self-administered mailed questionnaire of U. S. medical school faculty that covered a broad range of topics relating to academic life. SETTING: 24 randomly selected medical schools in the contiguous United States. PARTICIPANTS: A random sample of 3332 full-time faculty, stratified by specialty, graduation cohort, and sex. MEASUREMENTS: Prevalence of self-reported experiences of discrimination and harassment, number of peer-reviewed publications, career satisfaction, and perception of career advancement. RESULTS: Female faculty were more than 2. 5 times more likely than male faculty to perceive <b>gender-based</b> <b>discrimination</b> in the academic environment (P 3 ̆c 0. 001).

40|$|PhD (Business Administration), North-West University, Potchefstroom Campus, 2014 Introduction: From a legal {{point of}} view, <b>gender-based</b> <b>discrimination</b> is not condoned in the workplace. However, {{perceptions}} that such discrimination exists persist. Understanding {{the extent and}} nature of the phenomenon may contribute to the management thereof. Aim: The aim of this research was to report on the nature and level of workplace <b>gender-based</b> <b>discrimination</b> from the perspective of managers and employees, as well as by making use of objective measures. Method: Interviews were conducted with 75 managers focusing on the prevalence of <b>gender-based</b> <b>discrimination</b> in specific organisational processes. Furthermore, 145 managers and 1 740 employees completed questionnaires on this topic. Results: Managers reported flaws in all the organisational processes investigated. According to these managers, some processes showed a pro-female bias whilst others displayed a pro-male bias. More female than male employees reported discriminatory incidents at work, but both groups reported <b>gender-based</b> <b>discrimination.</b> <b>Gender-based</b> <b>discrimination</b> was the most prominent form of discrimination reported by women. Some female respondents reported pro-male and others pro-female discrimination. The same pattern applied to men. No statistically significant gender wage gap was found and the salaries of males and females were not differentially affected by qualifications, training, workplace experience or family responsibility. Managers and employees concurred that <b>gender-based</b> <b>discrimination</b> was the primary source of discrimination in the workplace, and they reported similarly on the consequences of this problem. Conclusions and recommendations: Managers are aware of discrimination in organisational processes. This awareness can be used to initiate programmes aimed at minimising discrimination. Both males and females are exposed to <b>gender-based</b> <b>discrimination</b> and they report similar consequences. This suggests that interventions should be directed at both groups. The different, and often opposing, reports provided by the male and female groups support the social identity theory and conceptions of group-serving bias. From the objective data it can be concluded that perceptions of being discriminated against are the result of psycho-social processes and not necessarily the result of justifiable biographical differences.

40|$|Managers are {{key in the}} appointment, {{promotion}} and remuneration of staff, and as such, they are actively involved when discrimination occurs in the workplace. This also applies to <b>gender-based</b> <b>discrimination.</b> The objective of the current research was to identify the points in human resource processes where genderbased discrimination most often occurs, as seen and experienced by managers. Interviews were conducted with 75 managers from 15 organisations. Questions were posed about the prevalence and nature of gender discrimination during different human resource processes. The responses were categorised and the overall inter-observer reliability was. 88. Most cases of <b>gender-based</b> <b>discrimination</b> occur during promotion processes, and this generally involves profemale discrimination. Pro-male discrimination occurs at appointment level and is often due to the inherent requirements of the job. Discrimination at remuneration level seems to favour men, allowing them to receive higher salaries than women at the same organisational level. Discrimination occurs in structured (e. g. job descriptions) as well as less structured (e. g. decision-making after interviews) phases of human resource processes. It can be concluded that <b>gender-based</b> <b>discrimination</b> still occurs and that both genders are affected negatively. It is recommended that managers be vigilant {{in order to avoid}} these discriminatory tendencies. Graduate School of Business Leadership (SBL...|$|R

However, only female génocidaires with minimal education, wealth, and social capital referenced this <b>gender-based</b> <b>discrimination</b> to minimize their crimes and assert claims of victimization.

40|$|Introduction: The {{relationship}} between employees and employers depends, among other things, {{on the level}} of consensus on what is perceived as fair or unfair in the workplace. When these perceptions are similar, a certain harmony results, but when there are appreciable differences, conflict may follow. Objective: To gauge the levels of difference in <b>gender-based</b> <b>discrimination</b> perceived by managers and employees. Method: Information was gathered from 145 managers and 1 740 employees working for 29 organisations, using the Fair Treatment at Work Survey and the Gender- Based Discrimination Questionnaire. This was a cross-sectional quantitative research design. Results: Both managers and employees pointed to genderbased discrimination as the primary source of discrimination in the workplace, more so than race or ethnicity. When presented with a list of the consequences of discrimination, managers and employees provided similar ranking orders. Confronted with the question of whether males or females enjoyed more privileges at the appointment, promotion, training and development levels, or whether remuneration for both gender groups was perceived as fair, managers and employees answered similarly. They agreed that most <b>gender-based</b> <b>discrimination</b> occurs at the appointment and promotion levels, and that less discrimination is experienced at the training, development and fair remuneration levels. They also concurred that discrimination sometimes occurs in favour of males and on certain occasions in favour of females. Conclusions: No real differences were found in the ways in which both managers and employees viewed the levels of discrimination in the workplace. The fact that <b>gender-based</b> <b>discrimination</b> was the most frequently listed type of discrimination suggests that more interventions should be implemented for its elimination.
