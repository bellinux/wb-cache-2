To obtain an accurate representation of the melon fruit transcriptome based on expressed sequence tag (EST) abundance in 454 -pyrosequencing data, we prepared <b>double-stranded</b> <b>complementary</b> <b>DNA</b> (cDNA) of melon without the usual amplification and normalization steps. A purification step was also included to eliminate small fragments. Complementary DNAs were obtained from 14 individual fruit libraries derived from two genotypes, separated into flesh and peel tissues, and sampled throughout fruit development.

Beta thalassemia {{in this area is}} predominantly the beta zero type with low levels of beta-globin mRNA. Translation assay of this messenger RNA in a cell-free system showed beta-globin chain synthesis only with the addition of an amber (UAG) suppressor transfer RNA. <b>Double-stranded</b> <b>complementary</b> <b>DNA</b> prepared from reticulocyte mRNA from a Sardinian patient was cloned in a bacterial plasmid and a beta-globin complementary DNA containing clone was isolated and sequenced. At the position corresponding to amino acid number 39, a single nucleotide mutation converted a glutamine codon (CAG) to an amber termination codon (UAG). We previously reported an amber nonsense mutation at amino acid 17 as a cause of Chinese beta zero thalassemia. Thus, beta zero thalassemia in Sardinia represents the second example of a nonsense mutation, and we predict that other beta zero thalassemias with mutations at various points along the beta-globin chain will be found to form a discrete subgroup of beta zero thalassemia. These experiments further illustrate the heterogeneity of lesions that lead to defective globin chain synthesis in beta thalassemia...|$|E

This synthetic {{structural gene}} {{has previously been}} shown to contain three sites for the restriction endonuclease HindIII, yielding two internal fragments of 1900 and 2500 base pairs respectively. Recombinant molecules were prepared by ligating the HindIII-restricted cDNA to the plasmid pBR 322 which had been linearized by the same enzyme. When Escherichia coli was transformed with this mixture, it yielded two kinds of colonies each harboring recombinant plasmids containing {{one of the two}} cDNA fragments. Both recombinant molecules hybridized specifically to translatable thyroglobulin mRNA. Sequence homology between the two cloned DNAs could not be detected by cross-hybridization experiments; this argues against the existence of internal structural repetition in thyroglobulin subunits.

The second type of A-particle gene was much less abundant with 90 copies representing approximately 10 %. The A-particle RNA in MOPC 104 E and MOPC 315 was found to be colinear with a small portion of this latter type, comprising only 2 % of the endogenous intracisternal A-particle sequences.

Methods: RNA extracted from three paired pulmonary adenocarcinoma tissue and adjacent noncancerous tissue specimens was used to synthesize <b>double-stranded</b> <b>complementary</b> <b>DNA</b> after labeling and hybridization. The complementary DNA was labeled and hybridized to the lncRNA expression microarray, and array data were analyzed for hierarchical clustering. Gene coexpression networks were constructed to identify interactions among genes. To validate the microarray findings, we measured the relative expression levels of four random differentially expressed lncRNAs in the same tissue used for microarray using real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction. The expression level of one lncRNA, AK 124939, in the paired pulmonary adenocarcinoma/adjacent noncancerous tissue of another 30 patients was measured using real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction. The experimental data were further analyzed and compared with clinical features. Results: Of 39, 000 lncRNAs investigated, 704 were differentially expressed in pulmonary adenocarcinoma tissue; 385 were upregulated and 319 were downregulated compared with those in the adjacent noncancerous tissue (fold change â‰¥ 2 and â‰¤â€“ 2, P< 0. 05). AK 124939 expression levels in poorly differentiated adenocarcinoma tissue were lower than those found in well to moderately differentiated adenocarcinoma tissue (P= 0. 05). Conclusion: There are significant differences in the lncRNA expression profiles in Chinese patients with pulmonary adenocarcinoma. LncRNAs such as AK 124939 may be anticancer factors related to the progression of pulmonary adenocarcinoma. Keywords: pulmonary adenocarcinoma, long noncoding RNA, microarra...|$|E

40|$|The {{establishment}} of left-right (LR) asymmetry in animal development remains an unanswered, fundamental question in biology. Many mechanisms of symmetry-breaking {{have been proposed}} and supported, although as yet no universal mechanism has been verified across bilaterian animals. Snails provide an invaluable study organism for understanding LR asymmetry, due to the prevalence of chirally variable species. In the pond snail Lymnaea stagnalis LR asymmetry and resulting shell-coiling direction is a well described genetically tractable trait, inherited through a maternal effect. However, the â€˜chirality geneâ€™ is still unknown. In L. stagnalis, clockwise (dextral) coiling is the dominant genotype, therefore snails with homozygote genotype â€˜DDâ€™ or heterozygote â€˜Ddâ€™ both produce dextral offspring, whereas those with the homozygote recessive genotype â€˜ddâ€™ have anticlockwise (sinistral) coiling offspring. To further the Davison research groupâ€™s ongoing characterisation of the chirality gene in L. stagnalis, this project focussed on gene expression patterns exhibited between chiral genotypes. Differential gene expression was explored via a candidate gene approach, performing quantitative real-time PCR (qPCR) experiments on specific genes of interest, and also a transcriptomic sweep, utilising next generation sequencing. To enable accurate quantification of gene expression by relative qPCR, first, stable endogenous control genes had to be established. In light of general failings of the previously published control genes to meet the criteria for appropriate use of qPCR, five genes were verified for use as stable endogenous controls in L. stagnalis embryo, ovotestis and foot tissue, for the accurate comparison of gene expression between and within chiral genotypes. These endogenous control genes will enable other researchers of L. stagnalis to rapidly identify stable controls for relative qPCR experiments. qPCR experiments were performed to compare gene expression of 13 candidate genes between chiral genotypes in the single-cell embryo, ovotestis and foot tissues. Significant differential expression was observed between chiral genotypes only in the diaphanous related formin gene, Ldia 2, and two actin-related protein genes, Larp 2 / 3 1 a and Larp 2 / 3 3. A frameshift mutation in the sinistral copy of Ldia 2, discovered by the Davison research group, has identified Ldia 2 as the primary candidate for the causal gene in LR asymmetry determination in L. stagnalis. In support of this, Ldia 2 mRNA {{was found to be}} dramatically underrepresented in the sinistral one cell embryo and significantly reduced in the sinistral ovotestis tissue, yet not in the somatic foot tissue. Ldia 2 was also the only gene found to be overrepresented in the embryo tissue relative to the ovotestis and foot tissue, providing further support for the functional importance the gene in early development. The expression level of Ldia 2 in the heterozygote genotype groups was calculated to be halfway between that of the homozygote groups, indicating equal expression dominance of the alleles at the chirality locus. The expression pattern observed in the actin-related proteins was less clear and will require further analysis to infer any true biological meaning. However due to the close interaction of actin-related proteins and formins the differential expression observed in the embryo tissue provides functional support for the role of Ldia 2 in chiral dimorphism. Next generation transcriptome sequencing methods were employed to gain a transcriptome-wide scan of patterns of gene expression in the ovotestis tissue of snails of differing chiral genotype. A comparative analysis was initiated trialling a novel reduced-representation sequencing method, expression RAD sequencing (eRAD) and traditional RNA Seq. eRAD applies the method of restriction-site associated DNA Sequencing (RADSeq) to the transcriptome by utilising <b>double-stranded</b> <b>complementary</b> <b>DNA</b> (cDNA) in place of genomic DNA. Due to delays in sequencing, the RNA Seq data was not received in sufficient time to perform the comparative assessment within this thesis. Consequently, only the eRAD data is presented here. The eRAD data failed to identify reliable differences in gene expression between chiral genotypes, although did provide a transcriptomic resource of de novo assembled contigs, which has been verified through further analyses. Overall the lack of differential expression identified between chiral genotypes in both the qPCR and eRAD analyses has indicated that the sinistral morph of L. stagnalis does not exhibit a large-scale loss of gene function and pleiotropic effects on gene expression. Therefore, the negative consequences of chiral reversal in L. stagnalis, such as the low hatch rate observed in sinistral broods, may all result from the single chirality gene polymorphism...|$|E

Though cDNA microassay assay provides a general picture on in vitro host cell responses in IBDV infection, there are still many information gaps in the pathogenesis pathway to be completed.

Based on an anlysis of the polypeptides produced in the different transformed cells, one <b>complementary</b> <b>DNA</b> apparently respresents sequences coding for Moloney gp 70; one <b>complementary</b> <b>DNA</b> represents a region of the Moloney genome common {{to all of the}} transforming viruses examined, and one <b>complementary</b> <b>DNA</b> represents the sequences for p 30, p 15, p 10, 12. A partial map of the different replication-defective transforming viruses is suggested...|$|R
