5|$|The NHC issued several {{watches and}} {{warnings}} for {{portions of the}} Mexican coastline; {{the first was a}} tropical storm watch for areas between Zihuatanejo and Manzanillo on June22. Several <b>hours</b> <b>later,</b> a portion of the watch was upgraded to a warning as Andres neared the coastline. By 1500UTC, a hurricane watch was declared for areas between Lazaro Cardenas and Cabo Corrientes, Jalisco and the tropical storm watch for Zihuatanejo to Lazaro Cardenas was discontinued. Roughly six <b>hours</b> <b>later,</b> a hurricane warning was raised for Punto San Telmo to Cabo Corrientes and the tropical storm warning and hurricane watch were extended northward to Punto San Telmo. By the following afternoon, the hurricane watch was discontinued and several <b>hours</b> <b>later,</b> areas under a tropical storm warning followed suit. Early on June24, all watches and warnings associated with Andres were discontinued as it rapidly dissipated offshore. Authorities closed ports in Lázaro Cárdenas, Manzanillo and Puerto Vallarta because of rough seas. Schools throughout Colima were closed prior to the storm and Mexican officials raised the awareness level to orange.|$|E

5|$|Typhoon Gerald, one {{of three}} typhoons to form from the monsoon trough in early September1987, {{originated}} from an {{area of low pressure}} that developed to the east of the Philippines over the South China Sea. The Joint Typhoon Warning Center (JTWC) started tracking the low at 06:00UTC on September2, after convection persisted. Two and a half <b>hours</b> <b>later,</b> the agency issued a Tropical Cyclone Formation Alert (TCFA), but almost immediately thereafter, shower and thunderstorm activity rapidly diminished due to decreased poleward outflow and increased wind shear. Despite this, the Japan Meteorological Agency (JMA) started tracking the system at 00:00UTC on September3. Eight <b>hours</b> <b>later,</b> the TCFA was cancelled.|$|E

5|$|Upon first {{becoming}} a tropical cyclone, the depression tracked towards the west-northwest {{due to a}} strong subtropical ridge located {{to the north of}} the system. A few <b>hours</b> <b>later,</b> the system made landfall in Dilasag, Philippines with winds of 55km/h (35mph 1-minute winds). After being over land for most of July31, the depression relocated into the South China Sea and the JTWC determined that it intensified into a tropical storm. At around 06:00 UTC, the JMA designated the storm Tropical Storm Prapiroon about 300km (185mi) northwest of Dagupan City, Philippines, a few <b>hours</b> <b>later,</b> PAGASA issued their final advisory on Tropical Storm Henry (Prapiroon) as it moved out of their area of responsibility. Prapiroon gradually intensified as it moved towards the west-northwest at 24km/h (15mph), and by that afternoon, the system had completely moved into the South China Sea. By the nighttime hours, the JMA upgraded Prapiroon to a severe tropical storm, as they determined that the maximum sustained winds had reached 95km/h (60mph 10-minute winds). By the morning of August2, the JTWC upgraded Prapiroon to a typhoon, and a few <b>hours</b> <b>later,</b> the JMA upgraded Prapiroon to a typhoon.|$|E
5|$|A {{tropical}} depression first developed on September 14 over the Pacific Ocean {{west of the}} Mexican coast. Six <b>hours</b> <b>later,</b> the depression intensified into Tropical Storm Norbert. Gradually strengthening, Norbert meandered in the weak steering currents for several days. The rate of intensification accelerated early on September 16, and shortly thereafter Norbert became a hurricane.|$|E
5|$|A {{tropical}} disturbance left Central America on September 22. Despite some wind shear, the system gradually became better organized and a tropical depression formed September 26, being upgraded to {{a tropical storm}} several <b>hours</b> <b>later.</b> The cyclone immediately moved north. Instead of strengthening into a hurricane before landfall as forecasted, Olaf weakened due to its proximity to land. On September 29, Olaf made landfall near Salina Cruz, Oaxaca.|$|E

5|$|A {{tropical}} wave departed {{the western}} coast of Africa on September26, becoming entangled with an upper-level trough {{to form a}} subtropical depression by 06:00UTC on October6, about 265mi (425km) north-northwest of San Juan, Puerto Rico. The depression recurved sharply northeast and quickly strengthened into Subtropical Storm Otto six hours after formation. On October7, Otto completed transition into a fully tropical cyclone as deep convection formed over its center, despite weakening during the process. The system further intensified into a hurricane by 12:00UTC on October8 and attained peak winds of 85mph (140km/h) twelve <b>hours</b> <b>later.</b> An abrupt increase in wind shear caused Otto to weaken as it accelerated northeast; it fell to tropical storm intensity by 00:00UTC on October10 and transitioned into an extratropical cyclone six <b>hours</b> <b>later</b> while positioned about 1,035mi (1,665km) east-northeast of Bermuda. The extratropical cyclone persisted for several days, eventually becoming a non-convective swirl early on October14 and dissipating by 00:00UTC on October18.|$|E
5|$|A {{tropical}} wave emerged off {{the western}} coast of Africa on May14. After emerging into the eastern Pacific on May25, the system acquired enough organization {{to be considered}} a tropical depression at 1800UTC on May29, about 115mi (185km) south-southeast of Puerto Escondido, Oaxaca. Within an environment of weak steering currents, the storm became better organized as evidenced by an improving satellite appearance, with the formation of a curved band in the southeast quadrant. At 1200UTC on May30, the depression was upgraded to a tropical storm; by 0000UTC on June1, however, increased northerly wind shear caused Barbara to weaken back to a tropical depression. After re-intensifying into a tropical storm for a second time six <b>hours</b> <b>later,</b> Barbara attained its peak intensity with winds of 50mph (85km/h) and a minimum barometric pressure of 1000mb (hPa; 29.53inHg) at 1800UTC. Drifting northeast, the storm maintained this intensity until landfall just northwest of the Mexico-Guatemala border at 1300UTC on June2. Rapid weakening ensued thereafter, with the system weakening to a tropical depression at 1800UTC. The low-level circulation dissipated six <b>hours</b> <b>later,</b> marking the dissipation of Barbara.|$|E
5|$|A {{tropical}} wave generated into Tropical Depression Six-E on July 23. It moved westward {{and reached}} storm strength 12hours after it formed.

5|$|A {{tropical}} wave {{was first}} observed near 50°W on August29. Later that day, reconnaissance aircraft flight reported a wind shirt and above average shower and thunderstorm activity, but no low-level circulation. At 0600UTC on August30, a tropical depression developed {{just east of}} the Lesser Antilles. Six <b>hours</b> <b>later,</b> the depression strengthened into Tropical Storm Ella. The storm moved through the Leeward Islands and entered the Caribbean Sea late on August30. A reconnaissance aircraft into Ella reported sustained winds between 55 and 60mph (95km/h). It was around that time that the Weather Bureau Office in San Juan, Puerto Rico began issuing bulletins and advisories. Ella strengthened into a Category1 hurricane at 1200UTC on August31, six <b>hours</b> <b>later,</b> before becoming a Category2 hurricane. On September1, Ella curved west-northwestward, and by later that day, made landfall on the Tiburon Peninsula of Haiti with winds of 110mph (175km/h). However, the storm was operationally thought to have remained offshore.|$|E
5|$|About 27hours before landfall, Mexican {{officials}} {{issued a}} hurricane watch from Mazatlán to Cabo Corrientes, Jalisco, with {{a tropical storm}} watch issued further south to Manzanillo.
