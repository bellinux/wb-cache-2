5|$|The Dayton region {{gave birth}} to {{aviation}} and {{is known for its}} high concentration of aerospace and aviation technology. In 2009, Governor Ted Strickland designated Dayton as Ohio's aerospace <b>innovation</b> <b>hub,</b> the state's first such technology hub. Two major United States research and development organizations have leveraged Dayton's historical leadership in aviation and maintain their headquarters in the area: The National Air and Space Intelligence Center (NASIC) and the Air Force Research Laboratory (AFRL). NASIC is the U.S. military's primary producer of intelligence on foreign air and space forces, weapons, and systems, while the AFRL provides leading-edge warfighting capabilities. Both have their headquarters at Wright-Patterson Air Force Base. Wright-Patterson Air Force Base is one of the Air Force's largest air base wings. The installation generated a total economic impact in the Dayton area of $4.67billion in fiscal year 2011, a decline from $5.1billion in fiscal year 2009. In addition, state officials are working to make the Dayton region a hub and a leader for UAV research and manufacturing.|$|E

40|$|Part 4 : Social Mechanisms of ICT-Enabled DevelopmentInternational audienceThe rapid {{expansion}} of hundreds of <b>innovation</b> <b>hubs</b> across Africa and Europe raises compelling questions about the relevance of this dynamic sector for development. To address this, our paper presents findings of how {{the social and economic}} context of hubs influences its members’ construction of concepts of community, collaboration and development. The paper argues that what counts as innovation is often constructed in Western discourse and projected onto African realities. Doreen Massey’s theory of space-making is used as a lens to analyse how different hubs produce distinct forms of collaboration and innovation for development. The aim {{of this paper is to}} explore alternative narratives of <b>innovation</b> <b>hubs</b> through a spatial perspective with the aim of revealing a multiplicity of forms for these hubs. It draws on findings from two <b>innovation</b> <b>hubs</b> in London and Lusaka respectively, using the methodology of multiple case studies. This article thus contributes firstly to the so far very limited empirical data on <b>innovation</b> <b>hubs,</b> and second, strengthens the theoretical framings of innovation for development which have so far emanated from a Western- centric empirical evidence base...|$|R
