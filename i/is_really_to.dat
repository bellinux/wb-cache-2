500|$|On February 14, 1992, Scientology leader David Miscavige gave Ted Koppel {{his first}} {{interview}} on Scientology on the ABC News program Nightline. The program noted that Scientology has vocal critics and cited Behar's 1991 article. Behar {{appeared on the}} program and gave his opinion of why individuals join Scientology, stating that the organization's [...] "ulterior motive" [...] <b>is</b> <b>really</b> <b>to</b> get people to take high-priced audit counseling. Behar stated on the program that he had evidence {{that members of the}} Church of Scientology had obtained his personal phone records. Later in the program, Koppel questioned Miscavige on the Church of Scientology's response to the Time magazine article, particularly the $3 million the church spent advertising in USA Today. Miscavige explained that the first three weeks of the advertising campaign was meant to correct falsehoods from the Time article, {{and the rest of the}} twelve-week campaign was dedicated to informing the public about Scientology. Koppel asked Miscavige what specifically had upset him about the Time article, and Miscavige called Behar [...] "a hater". Miscavige noted that Behar had written an article on Scientology and the Internal Revenue Service three years before he began work on the Time piece, and made allegations that Behar had attempted to get two Scientologists kidnapped. When Koppel questioned Miscavige further on this, Miscavige said that individuals had contacted Behar after an earlier article, and Behar had told them to [...] "kidnap Scientologists out". Koppel pressed further, noting that this was a serious charge to make, and asked Miscavige if his allegations were accurate, why he had not pressed charges for attempted kidnapping. Miscavige said Koppel was [...] "missing the issue", and said that his real point was that he thought the article was not an objective piece.|$|E
2500|$|Airbus Group CEO Tom Enders {{stated that}} [...] "The {{only way to}} do it for big {{companies}} <b>is</b> <b>really</b> <b>to</b> create spaces outside of the main business where we allow and where we incentivize experimentation... That is what we have started to do but there is no manual... It {{is a little bit of}} trial and error. We all feel challenged by what the Internet companies are doing." ...|$|E
2500|$|In {{addition}} Diana Fuss (1991) explains, [...] "the {{problem of}} {{course with the}} inside/outside rhetoric...is that such polemics disguise {{the fact that most}} of us are both inside and outside at the same time". Further, [...] "To be out, in common gay parlance, is precisely to be no longer out; to be out is to be finally outside of exteriority and all the exclusions and deprivations such outsiderhood imposes. Or, put another way, to be out <b>is</b> <b>really</b> <b>to</b> be in—inside the realm of the visible, the speakable, the culturally intelligible." [...] In other words, coming out constructs the closet it supposedly destroys and the self it supposedly reveals, [...] "the first appearance of the homosexual as a 'species' rather than a 'temporary aberration' also marks the moment of the homosexual's disappearance—into the closet".|$|E

50|$|The initial {{urbanization}} plan {{is attributed}} to the Jesuit priest Manoel de Leão, whose main occupation <b>was</b> <b>really</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> an administrator of the community.|$|R
2500|$|In {{the game}} itself, the city remains nameless but is {{strongly}} influenced by the environs of Philadelphia. Cage cited his like of M. Night Shyamalan movies, several which are situated in Philadelphia. Working with a scouting agent that assisted on the Philadelphia film, Cage and his team visited the city, taking {{in many of the}} poorer neighborhoods and meeting with the residents there to capture the despair, poverty, and fear they saw. Cage has also stated that [...] "I would like people to play it once…because that's life. Life you can only play once... I would like people to have this experience that way." [...] He went on to say, [...] "I'm fine with , but the right way to enjoy Heavy Rain <b>is</b> <b>really</b> <b>to</b> make one thing because it's going to be your story. It's going to be unique to you. It's really the story you decided to write... I think playing it several times is also a way to kill the magic of it." [...] In the Director's Cut edition of the game (the PS Move compatible edition) within the bonus content, [...] "The Origami's Trail", the narrator states that the game is in fact set in Philadelphia.|$|E
2500|$|Since {{the early}} 1980s, Japan has {{produced}} a significant output of characteristically harsh bands, sometimes referred to under the portmanteau Japanoise, with perhaps the best known being Merzbow (pseudonym for the Japanese noise artist Masami Akita who himself {{was inspired by the}} Dada artist Kurt Schwitters's Merz art project of psychological collage). In the late 1970s and early 1980s, Akita took Metal Machine Music as a point of departure and further abstracted the noise aesthetic by freeing the sound from guitar based feedback alone, a development that is thought to have heralded noise music as a genre. According to Hegarty (2007), [...] "in many ways it only makes sense to talk of noise music since the advent of various types of noise produced in Japanese music, and in terms of quantity this <b>is</b> <b>really</b> <b>to</b> do with the 1990s onwards... with the vast growth of Japanese noise, finally, noise music becomes a genre". Other key Japanese noise artists that contributed to this upsurge of activity include Hijokaidan, Boredoms, C.C.C.C., Incapacitants, KK Null, Yamazaki Maso's Masonna, Solmania, K2, The Gerogerigegege and Hanatarash. Nick Cain of The Wire identifies the [...] "primacy of Japanese Noise artists like Merzbow, Hijokaidan and Incapacitants" [...] as one of the major developments in noise music since 1990.|$|E
2500|$|During this time, European {{settlement}} accelerated, and in 1859 {{the number}} of Pākehā came to equal {{the number of}} Māori, at around 60,000 each. Settlers were keen to obtain land and some Māori were willing to sell, {{but there were also}} strong pressures to retain land - in particular from the Māori King Movement. Grey had to manage the demand for land for the settlers to farm and the commitments in the Treaty of Waitangi that the Māori chiefs retained full [...] "exclusive and undisturbed possession of their Lands and Estates Forests Fisheries and other properties." [...] The treaty also specifies that Māori will sell land only to the Crown. The potential for conflict between the Māori and settlers was exacerbated as the British authorities progressively eased restrictions on land sales after an agreement at the end of 1840 between the company and Colonial Secretary Lord John Russell, which provided for land purchases by the New Zealand Company from the Crown at a discount price, and a charter to buy and sell land under government supervision. Money raised by the government from sales to the company would be spent on assisting migration to New Zealand. The agreement was hailed by the company as [...] "all that we could desire ... our Company <b>is</b> <b>really</b> <b>to</b> be the agent of the state for colonizing NZ." [...] The Government waived its right of pre-emption in the Wellington region, Wanganui and New Plymouth in September 1841.|$|E
