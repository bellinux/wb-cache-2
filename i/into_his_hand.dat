25|$|Back in Edinburgh, Aengus Gibson has {{committed}} suicide. When Rebus reads Aengus's journal, {{it becomes clear}} that he thought {{that he was about to}} be arrested for the murder of Tam Robertson. The journal also reveals that it was Cafferty who forced the gun <b>into</b> <b>his</b> <b>hand,</b> getting Aengus's fingerprints on it. After the shooting, Aengus went berserk, starting the fire to hide the evidence.|$|E
25|$|Drawing {{continues}} {{until everyone}} has drawn 25 cards and {{a pool of}} reserve cards (usually consisting of about eight cards), remains. The dealer then picks up all the cards, integrates them <b>into</b> <b>his</b> <b>hand,</b> and then discards {{the same number of}} cards into a pile in the center, known as the kitty. These cards are kept unopened throughout the duration of that round and {{may or may not be}} turned over thereafter, depending on the result of the last trick in the round.|$|E
25|$|Fiona {{stops by}} the pawn shop to see Gideon, now that Emma has regained her memories, where {{it turns out}} that Fiona had {{reclaimed}} Gideon's heart with Curse. Then, she uses him to recover her own wand, which she uses to decipher the mysterious writings that Henry had scribbled in the page. Fiona then reads the inscriptions, which details the birth of Light and Darkness, their battle throughout the ages waged via their emissaries, the deaths of the previous Saviors and their enemies at each others' hands, and how the Final Battle will begin after the Emma's birth. After Gideon leaves to find Emma, Gold arrives in the shop, but Fiona fails to trick Gold into thinking that she had only come for her watch. When Gold confronts Fiona about her plans, she tells her son that once the Final Battle is over, the Curse will be lifted and they can be a family again. She also tells Gold that after she destroys all Light Magic, she will have so much power that she will be able to break the Laws of Magic at will, and she will even be able to bring back the dead. She tells him that she can bring back his first-born son, Baelfire, for him. She {{goes on to say that}} with her new powers, she will be able to make his family love him as the Dark One, so that he can keep his power. However, Gold knows that is will come with a steep price and tells her that he refuses to pay the price of magic anymore slipping Fiona's wand <b>into</b> <b>his</b> <b>hand.</b> He forces her onto the ground with magic vowing to make her pay for what she did to Belle. Fiona tells Gold that she had deciphered Henry's writing. She learned that Darkness cannot destroy Light since Darkness isn't strong enough. However, Light can destroy Light. She explains she gave Gideon one final command; to kill Emma, and that even if she dies, Gideon will still be forced to carry out her command. Gold decides to test this and kills Fiona with her own wand, breaking the Dark Curse. This causes Snow, David, Regina, Hook, and Zelena to be transported back to Storybrooke from the Enchanted Forest while Emma and the other residents of Storybrooke regain their memories. Soon afterward Belle returns to Gold and comforts him over his actions, while Gideon arrives at the office with his own enchanted sword in hand. As expected, Gideon confronts Emma and is ready to face off against her.|$|E

2500|$|Despite all the preparations, William {{had great}} trouble convincing the Dutch class of city and provincial rulers, the regents, {{that such an}} {{expensive}} expedition was really necessary. Also, he personally feared that the French might attack the Republic through Flanders when its army was tied up in England. One of the [...] "Seven", Lord Danby, suggested postponing the invasion until the following year. By early September, William {{was on the brink}} of cancelling the entire expedition when French policy played <b>into</b> <b>his</b> <b>hand.</b>|$|E

2500|$|There is a subtext of Christian allegory in Blade Runner, {{particularly}} {{in regard to}} the Roy Batty character. Given the replicants' superhuman abilities, their identity as created beings (by Tyrell) and [...] "fall from the heavens" [...] (off-world) makes them analogous to fallen angels. In this context, Roy Batty shares similarities with Lucifer as he prefers to [...] "reign in hell" [...] (Earth) rather than [...] "serve in heaven". [...] This connection is also apparent when Roy deliberately misquotes William Blake, [...] "Fiery the angels fell..." [...] (Blake wrote [...] "Fiery the angels rose..." [...] in America a Prophecy). Nearing the end of his life, Roy creates a stigmata by driving a nail <b>into</b> <b>his</b> <b>hand,</b> and becomes a Christ-like figure by sacrificing himself for Deckard. Upon his death a dove appears to symbolise Roy's soul ascending into the heavens.|$|E
2500|$|In July 2013, Carl's mother Nora White is {{introduced}} {{for a single}} episode, played by Lynn Farleigh, when he and Kirsty visit her in a nursing home. Inside Soap said that Nora is [...] "pure, unbridled evil" [...] and her introduction might show why Carl is a menace, giving viewers a [...] "glimpse into [...] twisted upbringing". They said there is tension between Carl and Nora, and compared her digging her fingernails <b>into</b> <b>his</b> <b>hand</b> to his burning of Ian's hand, asking [...] "has Carl learnt everything he knows from his evil mum?" [...] Jim Shelley thought that Nora's introduction [...] "seemed to {{be the start of}} a campaign trying to garner some sympathy for Carl—henceforth, a nasty, charmless bully". Coonan said that Nora is [...] "dominating and horrible" [...] and shows that Carl has [...] "demons within his own family" [...] and a [...] "troubled background".|$|E
2500|$|The haftarah for the parashah is [...] Both the parashah and the haftarah involve {{diplomatic}} missions about land issues. In the parashah, Moses sent messengers {{and tried}} to negotiate passage over the lands of the Edomites and the Amorites of Sihon. In the haftarah, Jephthah sent messengers to the Ammonites prior to hostilities over their land. In the course of Jephthah's message to the Ammonites, he recounted the embassies described in the parashah. And Jephthah's also recounted the Israelites' victory over the Amorites described in the parashah. Both the parashah and the haftarah involve vows. In the parashah, the Israelites vowed that if God delivered the Canaanites of Arad into their hands, then the Israelites would utterly destroy their cities. In the haftarah, Jephthah vowed that if God would deliver the Ammonites <b>into</b> <b>his</b> <b>hand,</b> then Jephthah would offer as a burnt-offering whatever first came forth {{out of his house}} to meet him when he returned. The haftarah concludes just before the verses that report that Jephthah's daughter was first to greet him, proving his vow to have been improvident.|$|E
