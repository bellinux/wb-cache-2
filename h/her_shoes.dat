5|$|Amy is a 12-year-old, pink-furred {{anthropomorphic}} hedgehog girl {{created by}} Kenji Terada for the Sonic the Hedgehog manga series. She debuted in 1992, wearing a dress {{and with her}} then-orange hair pulled into 2 ponytails. The character was redesigned the next year for the Sega CD game, Sonic CD. Like the Sonic CD introduction Metal Sonic, an early grayscale concept sketch shows her very similar to her appearance in the game (except <b>her</b> <b>shoes,</b> which became larger and flatter). Her coloring was red at first (including her skirt), except for a green shirt. The character had two other names in game previews: Rosy the Rascal and Princess Sally (a character in the Sonic the Hedgehog TV series). Amy received her present design, with a red dress and boots, in Sonic Adventure.|$|E

5|$|Brian {{begins to}} search for a way {{to get back to the}} United States, but Stewie refuses to leave with him and insists they travel to London. Brian and Stewie search for a camel to use as transportation, and they perform a musical number as a {{diversion}} in order to steal one. They begin their journey, but the camel dies in the middle of the desert. They soon find a nearby Comfort Inn, however, in which to stay. They steal a hot air balloon from the hotel premises and make their way to the Vatican City, embarrassing the Pope upon landing, then traveling by train from Switzerland to Munich, and end up in Amsterdam. Upon finally arriving at the BBC Television Centre, Stewie is horrified to learn that the farm is a set, and his beloved characters are merely tired out, disinterested actors. Enraged, Stewie decides to travel back home with Brian to Quahog after getting revenge at the Mother Maggie actress for kicking him by defecating in <b>her</b> <b>shoes.</b> This ordeal also causes Stewie to lose interest in the show.|$|E

5|$|Nick Dalton, an {{attorney}} and key-holder for the Playboy Club, introduces himself to newly hired Bunny Maureen and asks her for cigarettes. Maureen notifies to him that she is out of cigarettes, {{and goes to the}} storeroom to resupply. Bruno Bianchi, who previously tried to dance with her, is at the premises and attempts to seduce her. A terrified Maureen begins to resist his attempts; the two later get into a scuffle. Dalton—checking on his order—witnesses the attack and gets into an altercation with Bianchi. Maureen stabs Bruno Bianchi in the neck with the heel of <b>her</b> <b>shoes,</b> killing him. Nick Dalton later informs her that Bianchi is the head of a local chapter of the Chicago Outfit. They dispose of his body in the Chicago River, and Dalton provides refuge for Maureen at his condominium.|$|E
5|$|The video commences with a {{scene of}} the band {{beginning}} to perform the song in a house's detached garage. When the first verse starts, Stefani's ex-lover (Terry Hall) walks by the house before sitting down on a swing. Stefani changes <b>her</b> <b>shoes</b> as the song's chorus is played; she walks away from the garage and down a street to a grocery store. At the store, she purchases four cans of tomato sauce, and quickly leaves. Meanwhile, Dumont, Kanal, and Young prepare a large dinner for the band as Stefani reenters the home. Stefani slices tomatoes, Dumont cooks some spaghetti noodles, Kanal cuts up a few onions, and Young sets the table. At the song's bridge, Stefani accidentally cuts herself with a knife and Kanal drops a pot of pasta sauce; both of them promptly clean up their messes as dinner is served. Dumont initiates a food fight, and touring members Gabrial McNair and Stephen Bradley join in. The video ends with the ex-lover sitting alone on the swing.|$|E

25|$|The {{birth of}} the modern pointe shoe is often {{attributed}} to the early 20th-century Russian ballerina Anna Pavlova, {{who was one of}} the most famous and influential dancers of her time. Pavlova had particularly high, arched insteps, which left her vulnerable to injury when dancing en pointe. She also had slender, tapered feet, which resulted in excessive pressure on her big toes. To compensate for this, she inserted toughened leather soles into <b>her</b> <b>shoes</b> for extra support and flattened and hardened the toe area to form a box.|$|E
25|$|In the 1990s, Hingis was {{sponsored}} by Sergio Tacchini. She sued the company in 2001, demanding $40 million for making allegedly defective shoes that injured her feet.

She was then sponsored by Adidas from 1999 until 2008.|$|E

25|$|As dance progressed {{into the}} 19th century, the {{emphasis}} on technical skill increased, as did the desire to dance en pointe {{without the aid of}} wires. When Marie Taglioni first danced La Sylphide en pointe, <b>her</b> <b>shoes</b> were nothing more than modified satin slippers; the soles were made of leather and the sides and toes were darned to help the shoes hold their shapes. Because the shoes of this period offered no support, dancers would pad their toes for comfort and rely on the strength of their feet and ankles for support.|$|E
25|$|A local promoter, Roger Allen {{spotted the}} group in 1969 and alerted the head of A at Philips Records, Jack Baverstock.

The band were initially hesitant because of the reputation gained as the 'N Betweens' but eventually agreed to Ambrose Slade, a name inspired by Baverstock's secretary, who had named her handbag Ambrose and <b>her</b> <b>shoes</b> Slade. Baverstock also found the group an agent, John Gunnel, who had previously worked with the entertainment entrepreneur Robert Stigwood.|$|E
