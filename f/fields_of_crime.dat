40|$|Social interactionism {{occurs in}} space-time where the {{phenomenon}} morphs from the thematic activity to the geographical space {{it occurs in}} and the spatial relationships between the actors. The Maltese festa posits a ripe scenario for analysis of such interactionism and the inherent effects on safety and security. Whilst the fundamental festa scope banks on the sacred aspect, the activity moved through a village centre to a wider interactive (entire town) secular reality. This study investigates the occurrence of offending during the festa and the shoulder weeks for potential relationships between the spaces relevant to the activity through a study of expected and observed offences. The CRISOLA model serves {{as the basis for}} this study in the <b>fields</b> <b>of</b> <b>crime,</b> social issues and landuse and their impact on safety and security within the villages hosting the festa. The festa as a cause of crime by the relevant parties and significant others and its impact on social cohesion and operational requirements serves as a basis for proactive measures to be taken by the religious, secular and enforcement entities. peer-reviewe...|$|E
40|$|The {{article is}} {{prompted}} by an apparent paradox. In Germany, working relations between state criminal justice agencies and non-state institutions within a locality are often extremely close, relying upon networks {{of communication and}} a degree of mutual reliance, which in Britain would undoubtedly invoke reference {{to the idea of}} 'community'. In Germany, however, criminal justice professionals rarely describe this in terms of community. Though the emergence of locally based criminal justice ini tiatives has been later and less extensive in Germany than in Britain, there have been significant institutional developments in this direction over the last decade, particu larly in the <b>fields</b> <b>of</b> <b>crime</b> prevention and victim-offender mediation. Yet even those organizations working closely with local people or reliant upon the efforts of indi vidual volunteers or charitable bodies do not appear to perceive their work as com munity-orientated. This is the 'significant absence' of our title. By reflecting on why it is that in Germany the vocabularies in which local or informal criminal justice ini tiatives have been framed rarely make reference to the idea of 'community', we may hope to gain some insight also about the conditions under which the appeal to com munity becomes powerful in societies such as Britain...|$|E
40|$|Abstract: Knowledge, in {{combination}} with pragmatic, cultural, organisational and conceptual factors, determines the performance of practitioners such as police, local government community safety officers and product designers. This paper addresses the serious and widespread obstacles to the transfer and application of knowledge generated by professional criminological research, development and evaluation, to the mainstream of practice in the overlapping <b>fields</b> <b>of</b> <b>crime</b> prevention and problem-oriented policing. The emphasis is on those obstacles inherent in the nature and form of knowledge itself. It therefore relates contentfree concepts of knowledge management to content-rich considerations of the particular qualities of crime prevention knowledge {{and how it is}} applied in practice. It covers key issues of replication, innovation, and anticipation through, for example, foresight activities. It draws on ideas from design, evolutionary epistemology, memetics, more conventional anthropological views of cultural transmission and evolution, and organisational research on diffusion of innovation. The aim is to open up new ways of thinking centring on "genotypic " principles of prevention that apply across contexts and across time — which can provide the foundations for practical suggestions for training, guidance and design of knowledge bases. So many, and diverse, connections emerge to the Crime Prevention Studies, volume 13, pp. 131 - 203.

40|$|The new {{geocoding}} toolkit (matching a {{crime to}} the geographic location where it occurred) has been developed {{in order to improve}} the "hit" rate (rate at which a batch of crimes can be accurately located on a map). The purpose of the toolkit is not to replace commercial address-matching software such as Matchcode or QAS, but to enhance the outcome of the geocoding process by building additional steps and tools around these existing software products. It is a five-stage process. The first stage cleans common errors that arise in the address <b>fields</b> <b>of</b> <b>crime</b> data. In the second stage, the crime data are passed through commercial address-matching software, which attaches geographic coordinates to the crime location based on a street address. All addresses successfully geocoded at this stage are given the validation code "L 1," indicating that the crime has been linked to an individual property address at the highest level of accuracy. The third stage focuses on crimes with nonaddress locations. The majority of these are street junctions and {{can be found in the}} free-text data field that describes the venue of the crime incident. Other nonaddress locations would include railway stations, bus stations, and prominent landmarks. The junctions are text-mined by searching for key words. In the fourth stage, all remaining records with a valid unit postcode (mail delivery point) are geocoded at the postcode level. The final stage of the toolkit geocodes all remaining records according to street name. A test of this system in a British police force raised the "hit" rate for accurate crime location an additional 65 percent to a rate of 91 percent...|$|E
40|$|Since the 1990 s, studies {{within the}} inter-disciplinary <b>fields</b> <b>of</b> <b>crime,</b> {{the media and}} {{children}} have been wide-ranging. In spite of this however, to date, research into the media’s reporting on the missing and murdered child has been a neglected area of study. This thesis redresses this gap by providing the first significant study into the missing and murdered child {{and the way in}} which the media interrogates this phenomenon within the mediated public sphere. Reflecting on historical and contemporary debates and ideas about the public sphere, the thesis draws on current literature and considers the way in which mediated narratives about the missing and the murdered child, reinforce particular ideological and cultural assumptions about the politics of childhood, motherhood, community and privacy. The thesis considers the way in which the media’s coverage of the missing and the murdered child has contributed to the ‘emotionalization’ of the public sphere. The study examines established viewpoints about the nature of an emotionalized public sphere and the extent to which it undermines Western values associated with liberal democracy. A qualitative textual analysis of two case studies was conducted into the media’s coverage of two high-profile incidents of child murder and abduction- the Soham murder investigation in 2002 and the disappearance of Madeleine McCann, 2007. Samples for analysis were drawn from both print and broadcast media including five UK national tabloid newspapers- Daily Mail, Daily Mirror, Sun, Daily Star, Daily Express together with an episode of the BBC’S Crimewatch. Findings from this study reveal that a public sphere shaped by emotion provides a vehicle whereby subaltern counter-publics, the voice of ordinary citizens takes precedence. Moreover, I argue that the distinctiveness of this research is that it highlights the way in which a mediated public sphere informed by emotion appears to promote active citizenship and engagement with matters of public concern, of which the missing and the murdered child are but two examples. Finally, I suggest that it is through participation, and perhaps social and political engagement in response to such incidents, that contributes to the reformulation of a mediated public sphere and thereby sustains the very doctrines that underpin the role of the state and civil society...|$|E
40|$|Chapter 1 : Debates and Developments in the <b>fields</b> <b>of</b> <b>Crime</b> History and Women's History: Frameworks, Methodolozies and Consolidation. This chapter {{falls into}} three sections. The first {{outlines}} some key issues in Crime History. The second examines {{the development of}} women's history and discusses the introduction of gender into Crime History. It is argued that the new issues that have arisen from the joining of these two disciplines have enhanced the development of Crime History. The third section discusses women's history {{and the study of}} crime and gender in the early modem period, the source material used and methodology employed in this thesis. Chapter 2 : Economy and Socie!y in the South West of England: The Female Experience This chapter provides the social and economic background to the study of eighteenth-century female criminality in this region. It argues that the region constituted a pastoral rural economy; and it is within this context that the recorded criminal activities of women should be seen. The discussion develops, using the work of scholars who have examined this area of women's history, into an account of the roles and lifecycles of eighteenth-century women in these communities. Chapter 3 : Female Theft in the South West This chapter falls into two distinct sections. The first is a broad examination of all recorded female property offencesi n the period. The study assessestr ends over -ivtime, using material from the Assizes Gaol Book and the Quarter Sessions Indictments. It discusses relationships between levels of prosecution and food prices and periods of war. It also seeks to identify possible reasons which types of goods were commonly recorded as stolen and discusses any trends for the prosecution of these thefts over time. The second part of the chapter is a detailed examination of the detection and prosecution of theft during the period. An emphasis has been placed on the importance of the sorts of goods stolen, as well as how they were stolen and, consequently, the type of offender most vulnerable of detection and prosecution. The section moves to focus on clothing theft and its relationship to trading networks in the eighteenth century. It places the examination of this networking {{within the context of the}} eighteenth-century clothing trade. Chapter 4 : Offences Against the Person The first section of Chapter 4 concentrates on the record of assault and disorder found in the quarter sessions rolls and the assizes gaol books. It is argued that the increased use of recognizances to prosecute demonstrates the flexibility of the eighteenth-century criminal justice system. Also discussed in the section, are how assaults may be linked to other offences such as theft and how some assaults constituted unofficial punishments by communities. Although avoiding making too broad a statement about assault and disorder, it seeks to demonstrate that some cases could be representative of womenýs interests in both the public and private sphere. The second section of Chapter 4 discusses the record of homicide and infanticide for the western circuit assizes between 1735 and 1785. The section examines homicide, which seemed to predominantly occur within the familial setting. This includes the specific homicide offence of petty treason. The discussion moves on to examine infanticide, by far the most prominent female homicide offence recorded. The circumstances surrounding each case and the consequences of its discovery are examined. It is argued that a stereotyped narrative of the infanticidal woman dictated the prosecution and conviction rates of the offence...|$|E
