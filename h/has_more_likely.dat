40|$|AbstractThe present {{contribution}} {{deals with}} the issue of credit risk and rating, {{which is one of the}} useful tools for measuring to credit risk. Rating and credit risk are closely linked. In general, we can define credit risk as the probability of loss from a debtor's default. While rating is like a meter, by which it should be possible to compare two borrowers and determine, which of them <b>has</b> <b>more</b> <b>likely,</b> that in the end he pays for his obligation. In the rating process are systematic processed information about enterprise's developments from its past and the future outlook. The rating of the enterprise is carried out by taking into account quality criteria (“soft facts”) and quantitative criteria (“hard facts”). Hard facts are calculated from the financial statements of the company through the implementation of financial-economic analysis. So, hard facts provide a reliable statement about of the financial stability of the company and its financial health. The values of indicators which are achieved are combined according to their significance and then they are transferred to the internal rating scale. Then this value is used to express quantitative rating of enterprise. Present contribution is going to deal with calculation of hard facts and quantitative criteria for rating measurement. Rating assignment is going to be carried out on a model example. Hard facts are going to be determined based on the financial statements of the selected company and the rating is going to be assigned according to the rating scale which is going to be established for model example...|$|E

40|$|Bees {{make use}} of plant {{substrates}} {{in more ways than}} any other group of insects, which is probably linked to their diversification and ecological success. The highly diverse Megachilidae use a wide range of plant-derived brood cell-building materials, including plant leaves, mortar made from plant tissue, resin, plant hairs (‘plant wool’), and plant trichome secretions. While certain plant-derived materials are believed to protect nests against microbial decay, this has not been tested, and the factors driving diversification of nesting materials are poorly understood. Here, we investigated the protective effects of plant-derived extrafloral trichome secretions which female European wool-carder bees, Anthidium manicatum, smear on their brood cells. By breeding bees in cages with differential resource supply we generated brood cells with or without trichome secretions. Brood cells with trichome secretions were less attractive to parasitic wasps (Monodontomerus obscurus) in Y-maze olfactometer tests. Also, when exposed at sites where A. manicatum occurs in natural populations, brood cells smeared with trichome secretions were less affected by wasp (Melittobia acasta) parasitism than those without trichome secretions. On the other hand, trichome secretions did not prevent the growth of mold on brood cells, and larval mortality due to microbial decay was almost non-existent even when brood cells were exposed to rainfall. We conclude that the use of plant trichome secretion for brood cell construction <b>has</b> <b>more</b> <b>likely</b> evolved to create enemy-free space in response to chalcidoid wasp parasitism. Parasitoids are likely an underestimated cause of the diversification of cell construction materials and adaptive radiation in megachilid bees...|$|E
40|$|The Granadilla {{eruption}} at 600 [*]ka {{was one of}} {{the largest}} phonolitic explosive eruptions from the Las Cañadas volcano on Tenerife, producing a classical plinian eruptive sequence of a widespread pumice fall deposit overlain by an ignimbrite. The eruption resulted in a major phase of caldera collapse that probably destroyed the shallow-level magma chamber system. Granadilla pumices contain a diverse phenocryst assemblage of alkali feldspar + biotite + sodian diopside to aegirine–augite + titanomagnetite + ilmenite + nosean/haüyne + titanite + apatite; alkali feldspar is the dominant phenocryst and biotite is the main ferromagnesian phase. Kaersutite and partially resorbed plagioclase (oligoclase to sodic andesine) are present in some eruptive units, particularly in pumice erupted during the early plinian phase, and in the Granadilla ignimbrite {{at the top of the}} sequence. Associated with the kaersutite and plagioclase are small clots of microlitic plagioclase and kaersutite interpreted as quenched blebs of tephriphonolitic magma within the phonolite pumice. The Granadilla Member has previously been recognized as an example of reverse-then-normal compositional zonation, where the zonation is primarily expressed in terms of substantial variations in trace element abundances with limited major element variation (cryptic zonation). Evidence for cryptic zonation is also provided by the chemistry of the phenocryst phases, and corresponding changes in intensive parameters (e. g. T, f[*]O 2, f[*] H 2 O). Geothermometry estimates indicate that the main body of phonolite magma had a temperature gradient from 860 [*]°C to ∼ 790 [*]°C, with hotter magma (≥ 900 [*]°C) tapped at the onset and terminal phases of the eruption. The reverse-then-normal chemical and thermal zonation reflects the initial tapping of a partially hybridized magma (mixing of phonolite and tephriphonolite), followed by the more sequential tapping of a zoned and relatively large body of highly evolved phonolite at a new vent and during the main plinian phase. This suggests that the different magma types within the main holding chamber could have been laterally juxtaposed, as well as in a density-stratified arrangement. Correlations between the presence of mixed phenocryst populations (i. e. presence of plagioclase and kaersutite) and coarser pumice fall layers suggest that increased eruption vigour led to the tapping of hybridized and/or less evolved magma probably from greater depths in the chamber. New oxygen isotope data for glass and mineral separates preclude syn-eruptive interaction between the vesiculating magma and hydrothermal fluids as the cause of the Sr isotope disequilibrium identified previously for the deposit. Enrichment in radiogenic Sr in the pumice glass <b>has</b> <b>more</b> <b>likely</b> been due to low-temperature exchange with meteoric water that was enriched in 87 Sr by sea spray, which may be a common process affecting porous and glassy pyroclastic deposits on oceanic islands...|$|E
40|$|Over {{the past}} few decades it has become {{increasingly}} clear that the use of renewable energy sources is indispensable {{in order to reduce the}} excessive use of fossil fuels. One of the focus points of recent investigations has been in the field of organic photovoltaic devices, which converts light directly into a current. Due to their ease of processing and mechanical flexibility these solar cells would be cheap and applicable on almost any substrate. An organic solar cell consists of an active layer sandwiched between two dissimilar electrodes. Upon the illumination of such a device, a so-called exciton (a bound hole-electron pair) is created and in the presence of an electron acceptor this exciton is separated into positive and negative charges. When using electrodes with different work-functions, the charges are then transported towards the electrodes, which causes the flow of a current. The short exciton lifetime and therefore its short diffusion length make organic solar cells extremely sensitive to the active layer morphology. The interface between donor and acceptor moieties needs to be as large as possible and at the same time continuous pathways for both positive and negative charges towards the electrodes have to be assured. To get a better understanding of the processes involved in such organic or polymer solar cells and eventually optimize the performance of devices, it is vital to control the active layer material both on a molecular and on a macroscopic scale. In this thesis the use of block copolymers as self-organizing materials for solar cells was investigated. Block copolymer self-assemble due to the incompatibility of the two blocks, which are chemically linked to each other. The type of nanostructuring, taking place at the lengthscale of the two blocks, depends on this incompatibility (χ), the total length of the polymer (N) and on the volume fraction of the two blocks. A material that is suitable for application in a photovoltaic device, should contain a block with electron donating (D) and another block with electron accepting (A) moieties. For a good phase separation, it is important to control the molecular structure in order to ensure the presence of only well-defined block copolymer. This in itself is not evident, since the synthesis of such block copolymers requires many steps, each of which should give a well controlled structure. The synthesis strategy employed in this thesis can be essentially divided in three steps: (1) the synthesis of a conjugated polymer that acts as light absorbing and electron donating material, (2) the chain extension of this rigid rod-like polymer to give a rod-coil block copolymer and (3) the functionalization of the second block with electron accepting functionalities (e. g. C 60). In this thesis it is attempted to control the first two steps in terms of polymer length and polydispersity (PD), which should be low in order to enhance the self-organizational properties and the last step to avoid crosslinking and to ensure a known amount of electron acceptors that are actually covalently bonded to the polymer chain. The synthesis of a PPV (poly(p-phenylene vinylene)) derivative with branched solubilizing side-chains, poly[(2, 5 -di(2 ’-ethyl) hexyloxy) - 1, 4 -phenylene vinylene] (DEH-PPV), was performed via a Siegrist polycondensation. This polymerization is based on the self-condensation between an aldehyde (activated with aniline) and a methyl group. The influence of several reaction parameters on the degree of polymerization (DPn) and the polydispersity was investigated. An increase in reaction temperature or reaction time gives a slight increase of the molecular weight, which ranges from 4 - 8 kg∙mol- 1. Due to a decrease in reactivity with growing polymer chain length, the PD is already quite low, but it can be reduced even further (to ~ 1. 1) by using low monomer concentration or column chromatography as a method of purification. The Siegrist polycondensation of a PTV (poly(2, 5 -thienylene vinylene)) derivative, which has a better overlap with respect to the solar spectrum, was unsuccessful and only very short oligomers could be obtained. A new method for the synthesis of a PTV derivative with a single functional aldehyde end-group was therefore designed. Good results were obtained when using a Wittig-Horner-Emmons polycondensation, the self-condensation between a phosphonate and aldehyde group. By varying the amount of monofunctional end-capper employed, the polymer length could be controlled perfectly and polymer lengths ranged from 2 to > 20 monomer units. The relatively high polydispersities could be reduced (to ~ 1. 5) by precipitating the polymer. An adaptation of literature procedures permitted the transformation of these polymers into a macroinitiator for nitroxide-mediated radical polymerization (NMRP). NMRP is a controlled radical polymerization technique that should allow for the direct chain extension of the conjugated polymer with a second polymer, such as polystyrene or polyacrylate. The length of the second block can thus be controlled by adapting the polymerization time or the amount of monomer employed. This controlled/”living” polymerization technique also leads to rather low polydispersities. Since only very few copolymerizations using this technique are described in literature, a full investigation of the “living” character of both homo-, co- and block copolymerizations was performed. In this way very well-defined block copolymers with low polydispersity could be obtained for copolymerizations of styrene and methylacrylate. After purification, the final block copolymers showed a monomodal size-exclusion chromatogram, indicating the absence of homopolymers, with low polydispersity (PD = 1. 3). The (co) polymerization of n-butylacrylate gave somewhat less controlled polymerizations and the use of functional acrylic comonomers lead to complete loss of control. As a functional comonomer 4 -chloromethylstyrene (CMS) was used. The covalent incorporation of fullerene[60] (or C 60) in the second block poses some problems, due to the presence of multiple functional groups on the polymer chain and the fact that C 60 can react multiple times, leading to crosslinking. Three grafting methods were investigated and the most promising results were obtained when the chlorine is exchanged for an azide and a condensation reaction with C 60 is performed at relatively low temperatures (60 ºC). The formed triazoline compound is converted into a stable azafulleroid by extrusion of N 2 at high temperature. In this way around 100 % functionalization could be obtained, which is necessary in order to prevent crosslinking and the presence of pristine C 60 in the sample, which is almost impossible to remove. The final products were characterized in many different ways to correlate the physical properties and the self-organization in solution and in thin films to the device performances. PPV-PS based block copolymers show some kind of phase separation on the nanometric scale, although no highly ordered structures could be detected. The large window between the glass transition temperature (Tg) and the liquid-crystalline-to-isotropic transition temperature (TLC-I) for PPV-PBA and PPV-PMA based block copolymers allows for a much better phase separation. This phase separation into elongated structures is enhanced even further upon annealing and features as long as a micron can be obtained for relatively long coil blocks. These structures are most likely lamellae oriented perpendicular to the bottom support surface. This self-organization leads to relatively high hole mobilities, but a correlation study between the conductivity of a thin polystyrene film with varying amounts of C 60 it contained, showed that in all cases the surrounding polystyrene prevents the formation of a good percolation path and therefore electron mobilities were quite low. Device functions are therefore also very poor and an optimization of both the active layer morphology, through annealing or adaptation of the block copolymer, and the electron mobility in the acceptor layer are necessary. A major drawback of organic solar cells is their relative instability towards oxidation by (singlet) oxygen. The presence of singlet oxygen (created by energy transfer from the polymer in the triplet excited state) induces bond-breaking of the vinyl bond in the conjugated polymer. Earlier reports on mixtures of electron donating and accepting compounds in thin films, showed a reduction of the degradation in the presence of a derivative of C 60. It was implied that the presence of C 60 reduces the amount of singlet oxygen through competition of the energy transfer to triplet oxygen with charge transfer from the conjugated polymer to the C 60. Investigation of these processes in solution can only be done when both functionalities are combined in one molecule or polymer, since decay processes are to fast to investigate the energy transfer in dilute solutions of non-covalently bonded compounds. The influence of the presence of C 60 covalently bonded to the conjugated polymer on the creation of singlet oxygen was investigated by laser flash photolysis. In this thesis it was demonstrated that charge transfer to C 60 indeed takes place even in solution, but that, contrary to the previous report, this charge transfer increases the amount of singlet oxygen produced rather than to decreases it. A likely explanation for the beneficial effect of C 60 on the degradation of PPV in thin films, <b>has</b> <b>more</b> <b>likely</b> to do with the slow diffusion of oxygen into films containing many fullerene crystallites. In conclusion, the synthesis of very well-defined block copolymers containing an electron donating and accepting part was fully elaborated and all steps were well controlled. Some (preliminary) morphology and device results were obtained, indicating that the active layer morphology, together with its physical and electronic properties, should be fine-tuned. This new well-defined block copolymer allowed for the investigation of the singlet oxygen formation in solution. ...|$|E
