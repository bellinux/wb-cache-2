50|$|<b>Dogbanes</b> and milkweeds {{produce a}} sticky latex that can impede larval feeding. Early instars avoid the veins by skeletonizing the leaves. Older larvae sever the veins that supply the latex, which reduces latex {{flow to the}} area they feed on (Dussourd and Denno, 1991).|$|E

50|$|In the summer, orioles and prairie warblers can be heard. Butterflies {{are brought}} to the lake by the {{blooming}} of milkweed and <b>dogbanes</b> in the summer. Virginia rails and king rails can be spotted here, especially in the marsh and swampy areas of the lake.|$|E
50|$|The queen larvae feed on Apocynaceae ({{milkweed}}s and <b>dogbanes).</b> It {{can survive}} {{on a number}} of hosts.

The caterpillar has also been observed on Asclepias nivea, Calotropis procea, and Apocynaceae nerium. Other reported host genera include the Apocynum, Gonolobus, Sarcostemma, and Stapelia.|$|E

40|$|The {{effects of}} seedbed tillage and row {{cultivation}} on established hemp <b>dogbane</b> (Apocynum cannabinum) {{and the establishment}} of perennial weed species were studied. Moldboard plow, chisel plow, tandem disk, and no tillage with and without subsequent row cultivations were compared on an established stand of hemp <b>dogbane.</b> Intensive seedbed tillage coupled with 1 - 2 row cultivations did not reduce hemp <b>dogbane</b> populations or root carbohydrate reserves compared to no tillage treatments after 3 years;Hemp <b>dogbane</b> root development and structure below the plow layer were not altered by seedbed tillage. Tillage effects on root development within the plow layer were discussed. Morphological development was affected by seedbed tillage, but these differences lessened and were nonexistent {{at the end of each}} season;Hemp <b>dogbane</b> root carbohydrate levels fluctuated, with seasonal lows occurring during flowering. Starch was the major carbohydrate storage form. Lipid levels did not show any appreciable trends. Hemp <b>dogbane</b> emergence did not appear strictly regulated by soil temperatures.
