25|$|Before {{and after}} the Golden Horde fell, Dobrujan Muslims, like the Crimean Tatars, were {{recipients}} of its cultural influences, and the language in use was Kipchak.

25|$|By 630 the {{situation}} had changed. The Merovingian king Dagobert <b>I</b> <b>brought</b> <b>the</b> Frankish empire under one banner again and conquered the lands south of the Oude Rijn. This time they brought Christianity to the Frisian lands and built a church in Utrecht. After Dagobert died the Franks could not hold their position there, and around 650 the central river area, including Dorestad became Frisian again. The manufacturing of Frankish coins stopped {{and the city of}} Utrecht became the residence of the Frisian kings.|$|E

They were seen also as traitors by the German Empire if they remained loyal to Russia. Their loyalty to the state was questioned and rumors of a German fifth column increased together with the defeats of Imperial army led by Paul von Rennenkampf. All German schools and societies were closed in Estonian Governorate and Germans were ordered to leave the Courland Governorate for inner Russia.|$|E

The return followed the failure by RTÉ 2fm in its attempts to target teenagers. Fanning claimed: In fact I so never moved that instead <b>I</b> <b>brought</b> <b>the</b> four people who were working with me for Radio One and their desks into 2FM!

500|$|Abraham {{created a}} light-control system {{in an attempt}} to keep the {{overhead}} from being unflattering. However, after unsuccessfully attempting to implement the necessary wiring to control each light, the production team established controlling rows of light. Pat O'Mara, the key grip during production, installed several 2x1 and 2x2 blackout panels and frames that were retrofitted with small albeit strong magnets. During a scene when and actor or actresses stood under a fluorescent light, a panel or a frame was placed over the fixture, subsequently diffusing light onto their faces. [...] "If somebody was walking through the office in a wide shot, I just turned the overhead lights on. But if Don was talking to someone at his desk and the office was the backdrop, I turned all the lights on and then selectively removed some; then, <b>I</b> <b>brought</b> <b>the</b> key around with Kino Flo Image 80s through 4-by-8 frames of 250 or 216, or sourced my key with a larger Fresnel through the window." ...|$|E

She was coaxed to lie down again, but {{remained}} agitated. [...] "The child turned to me, and said anxiously, 'Send a telegram to mama.'" [...] Eagar promised it would be done. [...] "She added, 'immediately.' ... We continued to fan the feeble spark of life, but moment by moment it declined. She began to talk to her cousins, and seemed to imagine she was playing with them. She asked for little Anastasie and <b>I</b> <b>brought</b> <b>the</b> wee thing into the room. The dying eyes rested on her for a moment, and Anastasie said, 'Poor cousin Ella! Poor Princess Elizabeth!' I took the baby out of the room." [...] Doctors told Alexandra that the child's mother should be notified, but the telegram did not arrive until the following morning, when Elisabeth had already died. An autopsy following her death confirmed that she had died of virulent typhoid, although it was rumored she had eaten from a poisoned dish intended for the Tsar.|$|E

2500|$|Throughout the Middle Ages, Newcastle was England's {{northern}} fortress. Incorporated {{first by}} Henry II, {{the city had}} a new charter granted by Elizabeth in 1589. A [...] high stone wall was built around the town in the 13th century, to defend it from invaders during the Border war against Scotland. The Scots king William the Lion was imprisoned in Newcastle in 1174, and Edward <b>I</b> <b>brought</b> <b>the</b> Stone of Scone and William Wallace south through the town. Newcastle was successfully defended against the Scots three times during the 14th century, and was created a county corporate with its own sheriff by Henry IV in 1400.|$|E
2500|$|It was {{not until}} 1887 that Franklin began to see {{significant}} growth. Six brothers from the Camp family, with local roots, took possession of a local sawmill. The sawmill was small and had been operating for several years alongside the Blackwater River With the Camp family's acquisition of the mill, it experienced 20 years of rapid growth {{under the leadership of}} Paul Douglas Camp (president), James Leonidas Camp (vice-president) and Robert Judson Camp (secretary-treasurer).

2500|$|He {{said that}} he chose Lennon after seeing him {{on the cover of}} the Beatles' album, Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band. He also {{recalled}} having listened to Lennon's John Lennon/Plastic Ono Band album in the weeks before the murder and has stated: [...] "I would listen to this music and I would get angry at him, for saying that he didn't believe in God... and that he didn't believe in the Beatles. This was another thing that angered me, even though this record had been done at least 10 years previously. I just wanted to scream out loud, 'Who does he think he is, saying these things about God and heaven and the Beatles?' Saying that he doesn't believe in Jesus and things like that. At that point, my mind was going through a total blackness of anger and rage. So <b>I</b> <b>brought</b> <b>the</b> Lennon book home, into this The Catcher in the Rye milieu where my mindset is Holden Caulfield and anti-phoniness." ...|$|E

2500|$|Production of salt did not {{retain its}} lucrative luster for long, however, for {{downward}} price pressures had hit that industry from several angles. For one, {{the completion of}} the Erie Canal in 1830 meant a sharp increase in competition from companies that were mining massive salt deposits in Syracuse, New York. [...] Local competition had increased as well – by 1837, Provincetown had 78 saltworks, and the selling price had fallen from a high of eight dollars per bushel {{at the turn of the}} nineteenth century, down to only one dollar. Around that same time, demand for salt-cured fish began to decline, yielding to a growing consumer preference for ice harvesting and storage. [...] John Atwood Jr., the son of Long Point's founder, boasted that [...] "In 1848 <b>I</b> <b>brought</b> <b>the</b> first mackerel ever received on ice to Boston. It was August. I took them in the sloop smack American Eagle." [...] He later pioneered the use of a jib topsail to shorten his time-to-market, so as to meet the growing appetite for fresh-caught fish.|$|E

Chief of Naval Operations Robert B. Carney was selecting members of an upcoming promotion board and picked Curts for his skill and contacts {{in the fields of}} electronics and communications. However, [...] "Mr. Thomas vetoed [...] when <b>I</b> <b>brought</b> <b>the</b> slate in, and said that he didn't want him around Washington. I couldn't get from him any expression of reason as to this prejudice, but it was perfectly obvious that I couldn't bring [...] back. It was also perfectly obvious that I'd better not nominate him for three stars, which I had planned to do...But about a year later, I was looking for a replacement in the Second Fleet, and I brought in a nomination. Thomas said that he wasn't particularly impressed with the person I was suggesting and said {{it seemed to him that}} I'd do better if I put someone like [...] in." [...] Queried as to his change of heart, Thomas initially denied ever having vetoed Curts, then, when pressed by an incredulous Carney, [...] "finally said he couldn't understand why he had done it, except that somebody must have told him something." [...] Carney immediately nominated Curts for his third star.|$|E
