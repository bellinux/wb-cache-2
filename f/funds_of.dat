5|$|By {{the early}} 1900s, the {{graveyard}} was overshadowed on its northern side by a warehouse {{built on the}} Quay Street site of the Byrom family residence. The area had been residential—Richard Cobden {{was among those who}} lived nearby and attended the church—but changed in character during the 19th century, as many homes once occupied by affluent families became lodging houses and the locale became increasingly a place of business. Those who did live there, or were patients in the nearby hospitals, were poor and unable to contribute significantly to the <b>funds</b> <b>of</b> the church and its schools. Fundraising bazaars were held in the 1890s and 1900s at the Free Trade Hall, in a nearby area that was more salubrious.|$|E
5|$|In 1931 an unexplained fire {{destroyed}} much of {{the interior}} of the house, which had been turned into a cemetery chapel. The local fire brigade managed to stop the fire reaching the wooden stairs {{to the top of the}} tower. Prebendary F. E. Murphy, the rector of Walcot, established an appeal for <b>funds</b> <b>of</b> £300 for the restoration. By 1954 the stairs up the tower had become unsafe and a further appeal for public funds for the restoration was started. In 1970 the Church Commissioners declared the chapel redundant and plans drawn up by the new owners, Dr & Mrs Hilliard, to renovate the tower and create two flats. The Beckford Tower Trust and the museum were established in 1977.|$|E

5|$|With the Canary Islands' {{power grid}} {{substantially}} disrupted, the Unelco-Endesa power company {{was forced to}} use temporary generators to boost power at sub-stations far from the main grid. In La Corujera in Santa Úrsula, these generators were poorly received and over 1,000local residents claimed {{to be affected by}} the noise and pollution. Children, the elderly and people with respiratory problems suffered most acutely. Roughly €25million (US$37.25million) was allocated by the government of the Canary Islands in relief and reconstruction <b>funds.</b> <b>Of</b> this total, €22.5million (US$33.5million) was used to repair infrastructure and utilities; €1.5million (US$2.2million) was used for agricultural relief; and €1million (US$1.5million) was used in home repairs. Due to the severity of crop losses, farmers would be given a grant from the government that would cover 50% of their losses, including infrastructural. A tax break was also given to most residents who suffered damage from Delta.|$|E
5|$|One of the {{youngest}} Concordes (F-BTSD) is on display at Le Bourget Air and Space Museum in Paris. In February 2010, {{it was announced that}} the museum and a group of volunteer Air France technicians intend to restore F-BTSD so it can taxi under its own power. In May 2010, it was reported that the British Save Concorde Group and French Olympus 593 groups had begun inspecting the engines of a Concorde at the French museum; their intent is to restore the airliner to a condition where it can fly in demonstrations. Save Concorde Group hoped to get F-BTSD flying for the 2012 London Olympics, but this never happened.
