40|$|This thesis {{presents}} {{techniques for}} improving building HVAC system performance in existing buildings generated using simulation-based tools and real data. Therefore, {{one of the}} aims has been to research the needs and possibilities to assess and improve building HVAC system performance. In addition, this thesis aims at an advanced utilization of building energy management system (BEMS) {{and the provision of}} useful information to building operators using simulation tools. Buildings are becoming more complex systems with many elements, while BEMS provide many data about the building systems. There are, however, many faults and issues in building performance, but there are legislative and cost-benefit forces induced by energy savings. Therefore, both BEMS and the computer-based tools have to be utilized more efficiently to improve building performance. The thesis consists of four main parts that can be read separately. The first part explains the term commissioning and the commissioning tool work principal based on literature reviews. The second part presents practical experiences and issues introduced through the work on this study. The third part deals with the computer-based tools application in design and operation. This part is divided into two chapters. The first deals with improvement in the design, and the second deals with the improvement in the control strategies. The last part of the thesis gives several rules for fault diagnosis developed using simulation tools. In addition, this part aims at the practical explanation of the faults in the building HVAC systems. The practical background for the thesis was obtained though two surveys. The first survey was carried out with the aim to find the commissioning targets in Norwegian building facilities. In that way, an overview of the most typical buildings, HVAC equipment, and their related problems was obtained. An on-site survey was carried out on an example building, which was beneficial for introducing the building maintenance structure and the real <b>hydronic</b> <b>heating</b> <b>system</b> faults. Coupled simulation and optimization programs (EnergyPlus and GenOpt) were utilized for improving the building performances. These tools were used for improving the design and the control strategies in the HVAC systems. Buildings with a <b>hydronic</b> <b>heating</b> <b>system</b> were analyzed for the purpose of improving the design. Since there are issues in using the optimization tool, GenOpt, a few procedures for different practical problems have been suggested. The optimization results show that the choice of the optimization functions influences significantly the design parameters for the <b>hydronic</b> <b>heating</b> <b>system.</b> Since building construction and equipment characteristics are changing over time, {{there is a need to}} find new control strategies which can meet the actual building demand. This problem has been also elaborated on by using EnergyPlus and GenOpt. The control strategies in two different HVAC systems were analyzed, including the <b>hydronic</b> <b>heating</b> <b>system</b> and the ventilation system with the recovery wheel. The developed approach for the strategy optimization includes: involving the optimization variables and the objective function and developing information flow for handling the optimization process. The real data obtained from BEMS and the additional measurements have been utilized to explain faults in the <b>hydronic</b> <b>heating</b> <b>system.</b> To couple real data and the simple heat balance model, the procedure for the model calibration by use of an optimization algorithm has been developed. Using this model, three operating faults in the <b>hydronic</b> <b>heating</b> <b>system</b> have been elaborated. Using the simulation tools EnergyPlus and TRNSYS, several fault detection and diagnosis (FDD) rules have been generated. The FDD rules were established in three steps: testing different faults, calculating the performance indices (PI), and classifying the observed PIs. These rules have been established for the air cooling system and the <b>hydronic</b> <b>heating</b> <b>system.</b> The rules can diagnose the control and the component faults. Finally, analyzing the causes and the effects of the tested faults, useful information for the building maintenance has been descriptively explained. The most important conclusions are related to a practical connection of the real data and simulation-based tools. For a complete understanding of system faults, it is necessary to provide real-life information. Even though BEMS provides many building data, it was proven that BEMS is not completely utilized. Therefore, the control strategies can always be improved and tuned to the actual building demands using the simulation and optimization tools. It was proven that many different FDD rules for HVAC systems can be generated using the simulation tools. Therefore, these FDD rules can be used as manual instructions for the building operators or as a framework for the automated FDD algorithms...|$|E

40|$|In a <b>hydronic</b> <b>heating</b> <b>system,</b> it is {{important}} to control the zone temperature with a certain degree of accuracy. The system consists of a space heating circuit with the ability to modulate both the fuel mass flow of the burner and the mass flow of hot water. The physical model of the system consists of a heating system, a distribution system and an environmental zone which are simulated by an eleventh order nonlinear system. The objective of the controller is to maintain the zone temperature {{as close as possible to}} a chosen setpoint and, at the same time, to maintain the temperature of the hot water below a maximum temperature which is usually 90 degrees C. However, there are many problems in designing such a controller due to system uncertainties, saturation of the actuators and long system delay. To overcome the above nonlinearities, an adaptive controller has been designed using neural networks and evaluated with software simulations. Comparisons are made between the RMS of the zone temperature and the energy consumption of the system for a time period of two days by several neural networks with different architectures and learning laws.

40|$|Historic {{building}} heating and, in particular, church heating {{represents a}} challenging task because many objectives {{have to be}} reached simultaneously; in facts, adequate thermal comfort levels have to be guaranteed for the occupants while ensuring an optimal internal climate suitable {{for the preservation of}} valuable and often fragile building components and artworks. Moreover, current requirements for sustainability impose to make efforts, where possible, to minimize the amount of energy needed and the consequent environmental impact. For such reasons, the present work addresses in detail the church heating topic, by analysing different feasible strategies and developing subsequently an original technology, able to combine energy efficiency and cultural heritage preservation aspects. The application field of the study is represented by the Basilica di Collemaggio (L'Aquila, Italy), a church of worldwide relevance, currently under restoration. In detail, traditional heating strategies were compared with solutions for the local-comfort, such as the pew-based heating, and a novel hydronic high-efficiency pew-based system was proposed and deeply analyzed.

40|$|The studies {{presented}} in this thesis concern <b>hydronic</b> space <b>heating</b> <b>systems</b> connected via <b>heat</b> exchangers to a district heating network: referred to as an indirect connection. The objective has been to improve the reliability of district heat supplies and to lower the return temperature from consumer substations. Two of the disadvantages of an indirect connection have been addressed: the thermodynamic loss and the local dependency on electricity involved during {{the use of a}} heat exchanger. The results show that the influence of these disadvantages can be reduced by employing several variants of so-called low-flow procedures in <b>hydronic</b> <b>heating</b> <b>systems.</b> Concerning the reliability of district heat supplies, the present work has led to new knowledge regarding the dependence of the district heating technology on electricity. A substantial heat supply can be maintained in numerous buildings in case of an electric power failure since natural circulation can be expected to take place in the <b>heating</b> <b>systems.</b> A turbine-driven circulation pump has the potential to further reduce the dependence on electricity.

40|$|A {{solar thermal}} {{combination}} {{domestic hot water}} (DHW) and space heating system was retrofitted to a residential dwelling (2800 ft 3 (260 m 3)) in southern MN, USA, (latitude 44. 323 ° N). Since the existing household heating system utilized hydronic baseboard emitters, which are not often seen as a viable option for solar thermal integration, the design of this system posed technical challenges. The integration of several design features were intended to balance competing demands of collector efficiency (better at lower delivery temperatures) and <b>hydronic</b> <b>heating</b> <b>system</b> performance (better at higher temperatures). The design included the following features: 1. Evacuated tube collectors for optimum winter performance. 2. Reduction of the hydronic system delivery temperature allowed {{by the fact that}} the dwelling’s hydronic system was oversized for much of the season. 3. Differential temperature control of the the space heating pickup loop in the solar thermal storage. Solar thermal energy is delivered to the space heating system whenever the solar thermal storage temperature is greater than the return from the hydronic loop. During the first 12 months of operation, the system reduced the natural gas consumption for the hot water and space heating by 34 % compared to an average of the previous 4 years of data, but energy use reductions can also be attributed to improved heating system efficiency from improvements made to the heating system during the installation of the solar thermal system.
