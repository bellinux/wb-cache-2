5|$|Art {{historian}} Charles de Tolnay believed that, {{through the}} seductive gaze of Adam, the left panel already shows God's waning influence upon {{the newly created}} earth. This view <b>is</b> <b>reinforced</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> rendering of God in the outer panels as a tiny figure {{in comparison to the}} immensity of the earth. According to Belting, the three inner panels seek to broadly convey the Old Testament notion that, before the Fall, there was no defined boundary between good and evil; humanity in its innocence was unaware of consequence.|$|E
5|$|Luke's face {{is widely}} {{considered}} to be a van der Weyden self-portrait. He may have wanted to associate himself both with a saint and with the founder of painting. This <b>is</b> <b>reinforced</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> fact that Luke is shown drawing in silverpoint on white paper; an extremely difficult medium that demands high concentration, and is normally used only for preparation. The artist is boldly emphasising his ability and skill with preparatory sketches; a single surviving silverpoint drawing attributed to van der Weyden, now in the Louvre, contains a female head very similar to Mary's in the Boston panel.|$|E
5|$|The 260-day tzolk'in {{provided}} the basic cycle of Maya ceremony, and {{the foundations of}} Maya prophecy. No astronomical basis for this count has been proved, {{and it may be}} that the 260-day count is based on the human gestation period. This <b>is</b> <b>reinforced</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> use of the tzolk'in to record dates of birth, and provide corresponding prophecy. The 260-day cycle repeated a series of 20-day-names, with a number from 1 to 13 prefixed to indicated where in the cycle a particular day occurred.|$|E

5|$|One {{argument}} {{in favour of}} the toxin acting as a defence against predators is the apparent Müllerian mimicry {{in some of the}} various unrelated pitohui species, which all have similar plumage. The species known as pitohuis were long thought congeneric, due to their similarities in plumage, but are now spread through three families, the oriole, whistlers and Australo-Papuan bellbirds. The similarity in appearance therefore presumably evolved as a shared aposematic signal to common predators of their distasteful nature. This signal <b>is</b> <b>reinforced</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> species' strong sour odor. There is also evidence that some other birds in New Guinea have evolved Batesian mimicry, where a non-toxic species adopts the appearance of a toxic species. An example of this is the non-toxic juvenile greater melampitta, which has plumage similar to the hooded pitohui.|$|E
5|$|The narrator's tone is {{informal}} and conversational, attempting to conjure {{the picture of}} a dialogue between the reader and the speaker (who is evidently Auden himself, speaking directly in the first person as he does in a large proportion of his work). The informality is established syntactically by enjambment—only 13 of the poem's 93 lines are clearly end-stopped. There are few instances of rhyme, and about half the lines end on unaccented syllables. The lines alternate 13 syllables incorporating five or six accents with 11 syllables and four accents. Auden adapted this syllabic construction from Marianne Moore. The pattern <b>is</b> <b>reinforced</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> line indentation and confirmed by Auden's own reading. This structure mitigates the tendency of normally accented English speech to fall into the rhythm of iambic pentameter. Swift changes in the sophistication of diction also occur in the poem, as in conversation, and lend it an immediate, informal quality.|$|E
5|$|The {{portrait}} {{depicts the}} tensions and manoeuvrings of 16th century court politics. The deep red background and heavy brushstrokes establish an anxious and tense atmosphere, and the uneasy {{relationship between the}} Pope and his suitors. The pope is old, ill and tired and, to some critics' eyes, glares at Ottavio in an accusatory manner. His hat or camauro cloaks his baldness, but there are tell-tale signs of age in his long nose, dark beady eyes, stooped shoulders and long uneven beard. He is noticeably older than in the second Naples portrait of 1543. This fact <b>is</b> <b>reinforced</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> clock placed {{on the table beside}} him, which serves both as a memento mori and a reminder that time is running out. Given this, the presence of his grandsons indicates that the commission was prompted by thoughts of succession.|$|E

5|$|The {{presence}} of the important and influential military aristocracy that formed in Mycenaean society offers an overwhelming impression of a fierce and warlike people. This impression of militarism <b>is</b> <b>reinforced</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> fortifications erected throughout Mycenaean Greece, the large numbers {{and quality of the}} weapons retrieved from the Mycenaean royal graves, artistic representations of war scenes and the textual evidence provided by the Linear B records. The Linear B scripts also offer some detail about the organization of the military personnel, while military production and logistics were supervised by a central authority from the palaces. According to the records in the palace of Pylos, every rural community (the damos) was obliged to supply a certain number of men who had to serve in the army; similar service was also performed by the aristocracy.|$|E
5|$|The {{result was}} a non-hierarchical, organic {{collection}} of low-lying buildings intended to allow views of, and blend in with, the surrounding rugged scenery and symbolise the connection between nature and the Scottish people. As a consequence the building has many features connected to nature and land, such as the leaf shaped motifs of the roof in the Garden Lobby of the building, and the large windows of the debating chamber, committee rooms and the Tower Buildings which face the broad expanse of Holyrood Park, Arthur's Seat and Salisbury Crags. Inside the buildings, the connection to the land <b>is</b> <b>reinforced</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> use of Scottish rock such as gneiss and granite in the flooring and walls, {{and the use of}} oak and sycamore {{in the construction of the}} furniture.|$|E
5|$|The Chaco Low is a semi–permanent low {{pressure}} system situated {{east of the}} Andes that is approximately located between 20oS and 30oS during summer (displaced to the north in winter). It is stronger in the summer than in winter due {{to a combination of}} high insolation, dry surface conditions, and southward displacement of the South Atlantic and South Pacific High (this makes it difficult for cold fronts to enter at lower latitudes). The Chaco Low interacts with the South Atlantic High, generating a pressure gradient that draws moist air from the northeast to coastal and central regions of Argentina. It also forces easterly winds from the Amazon basin to move southward, which <b>is</b> <b>reinforced</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> funneling effect from both the Andes and the Brazilian Plateau. The Chaco Low brings large amounts of moisture that favour the development of convective thunderstorms during summer, reaching as far south as 35oS. This movement of air from the north owing to the interaction between the Chaco Low and the South Atlantic high is the strongest in summer when the Chaco Low is at its strongest. These winds bring hot, humid tropical air from the north. Sustained and intense winds from the north are responsible for severe weather events such as heat waves and severe convection. During winter, the Chaco Low weakens as a result of lower insolation. This is partly responsible for the decrease in winter precipitation over much of Argentina (in addition to northward displacement of westerlies) due to a weaker transport of air masses from the tropics. This excludes areas south of 40oS where it is dominated by westerlies.|$|E

25|$|The {{complete}} {{collapse of}} the German 6th Army and the Romanian 4th Army was more likely caused by {{the inability of the}} numerous horse-drawn infantry divisions to maintain cohesion while retreating and under attack of the Soviet mechanized troops. This claim <b>is</b> <b>reinforced</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> fact that the only Romanian division which retained its cohesion under the Soviet attack was the 1st Armoured Division, which had the mobility and the anti-tank weapons needed to do so.|$|E
25|$|This {{rational}} structure, {{imposed a}} structural geometry to the terrain, {{which is part}} of the Umayyad castle typology. Archaeologist Helena Maria Gomes Catarino, drew parallels between Alcoutim and other castles of the Eastern Algarve, referring to the fortress of Almiserát (Alicante) in particular, constructed in the 10th century, and others with identical characteristics. This attribution <b>is</b> <b>reinforced</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> morphology of its construction: a base of irregular lose stone, with cemented stone and earth, typical of other Umayyad military installations of the time.|$|E
25|$|Afterwards, Desdemona {{begins to}} bid Emilia adieu. This goodbye is {{initially}} accompanied by repeated {{notes on the}} lower woodwinds and strings {{such as those in}} the introduction of the act but in a much more noticeable and dominating manner. This reflects the increasing expectation of Desdemona of her death. Initially, she attempts to keep these feelings to herself, but the orchestra reveals her increasing inner thoughts. These feelings finally reach a point at which they can no longer be contained and Desdemona lets out a loud passionate cry of goodbye to Emilia, one that <b>is</b> <b>reinforced</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> full orchestral accompaniment.|$|E

25|$|Therefore, {{relations}} between the Studite Abbot and the Patriarch {{appear to have been}} initially untroubled, an impression which <b>is</b> <b>reinforced</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> choice (806/807) of Theodore's brother, Joseph, as Archbishop of Thesaloniki. However, soon after this ordination, perhaps in 808, Theodore began to express his unwillingness to associate with the rehabilitated priest Joseph, or for that matter with anyone else who knowingly associated with him, as he held the rehabilitation for uncanonical. As in the first dispute over the priest Joseph, the extension of this refusal beyond Joseph to those who associated with him included implicitly the patriarch and the emperor himself.|$|E
25|$|Although {{the side}} churches are {{arranged}} in perfect symmetry, the cathedral {{as a whole is}} not. The larger central church was deliberately offset to the west from the geometric center of the side churches, to accommodate its larger apse on the eastern side. As a result of this subtle calculated asymmetry, viewing from {{the north and the south}} presents a complex multi-axial shape, while the western facade, facing the Kremlin, appears properly symmetrical and monolithic. The latter perception <b>is</b> <b>reinforced</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> fortress-style machicolation and corbeled cornice of the western Church of Entry into Jerusalem, mirroring the real fortifications of the Kremlin.|$|E
25|$|The picture's {{theatrical}} design {{places the}} most prominent figures in a shallow foreground stage. Immediately behind them are a diverting company of pages, halberdiers, dwarfs, dogs and monkeys, and in the further distance looms an architectural screen, an arched promenade parallel to the picture plane and supporting more spectators. These are pictorial preferences typical of Veronese, with the placement of figures and edifices reinforcing a processional character. The curves of the distant arches echo {{the movement of the}} supplicated foreground figures, while the gesture of Sisygambis corresponds to and <b>is</b> <b>reinforced</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> verticals of the central fountain; the architectural geometry organizes the movement of the figures.|$|E

25|$|The rising {{nature of}} the ziggurat mass of the {{exterior}} of the building <b>is</b> <b>reinforced</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> prismoid (triangular) windows, which extend up and down the height of the building. These windows are of note because they set the Mutual Building apart from some of the buildings that inspired it, for example the Eastern Columbia Building in Los Angeles. They are also functional, because they allow light to enter the building more effectively than would otherwise be the case (using the reflective properties of the inside face of the glass), and by opening and closing blinds on the {{one side or the other}} it is possible on sunny days to manage the heat entering the building as the sun traverses the sky.|$|E
25|$|The land {{is similar}} to the false paradise of Mount Amara in Paradise Lost, {{especially}} the Abyssinian maid's song about Mount Abora that is able to mesmerise the poet. In the manuscript copy, the location was named both Amora and Amara, and the location of both is the same. There are more connections to Paradise Lost, including how Milton associates the Tatar ruler to the Post-Edenic world in Adam's vision of the Tartar kingdom. In post-Milton accounts, the kingdom is linked with the worship of the sun, and his name is seen to be one that reveals the Khan as a priest. This <b>is</b> <b>reinforced</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> connection of the river Alph with the Alpheus, a river that in Greece was connected to the worship of the sun. As followers of the sun, the Tatar are connected to a tradition that describes Cain as founding a city of sun worshippers and that people in Asia would build gardens in remembrance of the lost Eden.|$|E
25|$|Like {{others in}} the world, the border is a culture unto itself, not {{belonging}} 100% to either country. Interaction between the peoples on both sides {{is a part of}} both the culture and the economy. In the 1980s, an international volleyball game was regularly held near Naco, with the chain link border fence serving as the net. Much of Arizona and Sonora share a cuisine based on the wheat, cheese and beef that was introduced to the region by the Spaniards, with wheat tortillas being especially large {{on both sides of the}} border. This diet <b>is</b> <b>reinforced</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> vaquero/cowboy tradition which continues in both states. The six border crossings are essential to the existence and extent of the communities that surround them, as most of them function as ports for the passage of goods between the two countries. People regularly shop and work on the other side, taking advantage of opportunities there. The economic opportunities of the border are not equal on both sides. Most of the population along this border lives on the Sonoran side, many of which have moved here for the opportunities created by the maquiladoras and other businesses. These are lacking on the Arizona side.|$|E
