5|$|Although the {{engagement}} <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>end</b> the First Bulgarian Empire, the Battle of Kleidion reduced {{its ability to}} resist Byzantine advances and can be considered the pivotal encounter of the war with Byzantium. The heirs of Samuel could not subsequently hold off the Byzantine advance, and in 1018 the Bulgarian Empire was finally destroyed by Basil II.|$|E
5|$|In a 2002 article, Bill Simmons {{named the}} worst officiated {{games of the}} prior four years, alleging that the games {{involved}} either extending a series so it <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>end</b> quickly or advancing a large market team for the NBA's benefit. All seven games named had been officiated by Bavetta.|$|E
5|$|Major {{investment}} by the Indonesian government to improve East Timor's infrastructure, {{and health and}} education facilities since 1975, <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>end</b> East Timorese resistance to Indonesian rule. Although by the 1980s Fretilin forces had dropped to a few hundred armed men, Fretilin increased its contacts with young Timorese especially in Dili, and an un-armed civil resistance seeking self-determination took shape.|$|E

5|$|They were {{defeated}} in their Test against Australia {{and in all}} three against the All Blacks. The All Blacks' side was particularly strong and won all its Tests between 1965 and 1970.

5|$|After humans {{migrated}} out {{of their}} ancestral environment of eastern Africa, they were exposed to new climates and challenges. Thus, Wade argues, human evolution <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>end</b> with behavioural modernity, but continued to be shaped by the different environments and lifestyles of each continent. While many adaptations happened in parallel across human populations, Wade believes that genetic isolation – either because of geography or hostile tribalism – also facilitated a degree of independent evolution, leading to genetic and cultural differentiation from the ancestral population and giving rise to different human races and languages.|$|E

5|$|Even {{though the}} miners {{were able to}} reach a {{settlement}} in early 1990, the case of the UMWA vs. Pittston Coal Company <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>end</b> in 1990. The fines, over $60 million, did not come into bargaining until 1994 and Pittston agreed to drop most of the charges. However, since the case was now in the court system, many courts wanted the UMWA to be responsible for all of the fines. The UMWA appealed all fines against them and the case remained undecided for many years.|$|E
5|$|Following President Obama's {{announcement}} that the United States would move towards normalizing relations with Cuba, Pritzker traveled to Cuba. Although Obama's {{change in policy}} <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>end</b> the U.S. trade embargo, since ending the embargo required an act of Congress, Pritzker met with Cuban trade ministers and other officials to discuss the changing {{relationship between the two}} countries and {{to lay the groundwork for}} more economic involvement.|$|E

Albania <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>end</b> its {{state of war}} with Greece, {{left over from the}} Second World War, until as late as 1987 – two years after Hoxha's death – due to suspicions about Greek territorial ambitions in southern Albania (known to Greeks as Northern Epirus) as well as Greece's status as a NATO member state.|$|E
5|$|King's cricketing career <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>end</b> {{with his}} last {{first-class}} match. He {{continued to play}} club matches in Philadelphia and participated in non-first-class fixtures around the continent. King is noted for holding the bowling record against Canada. On a rainy afternoon at Philadelphia in 1906, King bowled into a slight breeze to capture 8 wickets for 17 runs. This record came in a four-year period during which King focused on club cricket in Philadelphia, {{when he won the}} city's batting award three times and the bowling award four times.|$|E
5|$|Pompey's death <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>end</b> {{the civil}} war, as Caesar's many enemies fought on.

Caesar then defeated the combined Pompeian forces at the Battle of Munda.|$|E

5|$|Sestero recalls in {{his book}} The Disaster Artist that Wiseau {{intended}} for the film to contain a subplot in which Johnny was revealed to be a vampire, due to Wiseau's own fascination with the creatures. Sestero recounts how, {{at the outset of}} production, Wiseau tasked members of the crew with figuring out a way to execute a sequence in which Johnny's Mercedes-Benz would lift off from the roof of the townhouse and fly across the San Francisco skyline, revealing Johnny's vampiric nature. However, this scene <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>end</b> up being created for the film.|$|E
5|$|The {{fighting}} in Nanking <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>end</b> {{entirely on the}} night of December 12–13 when the Japanese Army took the remaining gates and entered the city. During their mopping-up operations in the city the Japanese continued for several more days to beat back sporadic resistance from Chinese stragglers. Though Mufushan, just north of Nanking, was taken by Japan's Yamada Detachment without much bloodshed on the morning of December 14, pockets of resistance outside Nanking persisted for several more days.|$|E
5|$|Because the {{pay-per-view}} {{focused on}} the tournament, few major feuds were highlighted. Aside from Owen Hart, the tournament did not figure prominently into the future storylines {{of any of the}} other participants. The qualifying match between the 1–2–3 Kid and Adam Bomb did, however, help advance a storyline. Bomb and Kwang, both managed by Harvey Wippleman, began feuding shortly after King of the Ring when Wippleman and Kwang turned on Bomb. Bomb began wrestling as a face as a result. Their feud <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>end</b> with a major blow off match, however. Instead, it was quietly resolved in a dark match prior to the SummerSlam 1994 broadcast.|$|E

5|$|By {{the late}} 1970s, the school's population, {{academic}} program, and building {{were all in}} decline, in part reflecting the economic problems {{of the city as}} a whole. In 1977, the city school system allocated money to refurbish the school and bolster the college preparatory program. That same year the school system announced its intent to make City College coeducational; however, the all-male tradition <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>end</b> easily. Alumni argued for the uniqueness of a single-sex education system, and a task force studying the issue voted 11–6 in favor of keeping the all-male tradition. In a stunning reversal, the board of school commissioners voted to admit women citing constitutional concerns over equal rights. The following year City College enrolled women for the first time.|$|E
5|$|Curie's {{quest to}} create a new {{laboratory}} <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>end</b> with the University of Paris, however. In her later years, she headed the Radium Institute (Institut du radium, now Curie Institute, Institut Curie), a radioactivity laboratory created for her by the Pasteur Institute and the University of Paris. The initiative for creating the Radium Institute had come in 1909 from Pierre Paul Émile Roux, director of the Pasteur Institute, who had been disappointed that the University of Paris was not giving Curie a proper laboratory and had suggested that she move to the Pasteur Institute. Only then, with the threat of Curie leaving, did the University of Paris relent, and eventually the Curie Pavilion became a joint initiative of the University of Paris and the Pasteur Institute.|$|E
5|$|For Native Americans, Pontiac's War {{demonstrated}} {{the possibilities of}} pan-tribal cooperation in resisting Anglo-American colonial expansion. Although the conflict divided tribes and villages, the war also saw the first extensive multi-tribal resistance to European colonization in North America, {{and was the first}} war between Europeans and Native North Americans that <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>end</b> in complete defeat for the Native Americans. The Proclamation of 1763 ultimately did not prevent British colonists and land speculators from expanding westward, and so Native Americans found it necessary to form new resistance movements. Beginning with conferences hosted by Shawnees in 1767, in the following decades leaders such as Joseph Brant, Alexander McGillivray, Blue Jacket, and Tecumseh would attempt to forge confederacies that would revive the resistance efforts of Pontiac's War.|$|E
