5|$|By May 1942, Conant {{felt that}} the S-1 Committee had become too unwieldy. It had not met since the March meeting. When he needed expert advice in May, he had called upon a smaller group, and he {{recommended}} that this supervise the OSRD work, mainly the technical and contractual aspects of the project, while the Army handled <b>engineering,</b> <b>construction</b> and site selection. Procurement was an OSRD responsibility, but it could turn to the Army for help in case of difficulties. Bush obtained the president's approval for this, and on June 19, 1942, he abolished the S-1 Section {{and replaced it with}} the S-1 Executive Committee. Conant was appointed as its chairman, and Briggs, Compton, Lawrence, Eger Murphree, and Urey as its other members.|$|E
