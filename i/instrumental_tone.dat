50|$|Adrian Belew (born Robert Steven Belew, December 23, 1949) is an American musician, {{songwriter}} {{and record}} producer. A multi-instrumentalist primarily {{known as a}} guitarist and singer, Belew is noted for his unusual, impressionistic approach to guitar playing which, {{rather than relying on}} standard <b>instrumental</b> <b>tones,</b> often resembles sound effects or noises made by animals and machines.|$|R

40|$|<b>Instrumental</b> <b>tones</b> and, in some instances, simple sine-wave tones {{were shown}} to evoke {{stronger}} auditory-evoked responses in musicians compared to nonmusicians. This effect was taken as an example for plasticity in the auditory cortex elicited by training. To date, however, it is unknown whether an enlarged cortical representation for (<b>instrumental)</b> <b>tones</b> or increased neuronal activity provoked by focused attention in musicians accounts for the reported difference. In an attempt to systematically investigate the influence of attention on the processing of simple sine wave and <b>instrumental</b> <b>tones,</b> we compared auditory-evoked potentials recorded from musicians and nonmusicians. During the electroencephalogram recording, the participants were involved in tasks requiring selective attention to specific sound features such as pitch or timbre. Our results demonstrate {{that the effect of}} selective attention on the auditory event-related potential (AEP) has a different time course and shows a different topography than the reproduced effect of music expertise at the N 1 component or the previously demonstrated effect at the P 2 component. N 1 peak potentials were unaffected by attention modulation. These results indicate that the effect of music expertise, which was traced by current density mapping to the auditory cortex, is not primarily caused by selective attention, and it supports the view that increased AEPs on tones in musicians reflect an enlarged neuronal representation for specific sound features of these tones. However, independent from the N 1 -P 2 complex, attention evoked an Nd-like negative component in musicians but not in nonmusicians, which suggests that plasticity also affects top-down processes...|$|R

5000|$|The work {{is fully}} {{representative}} of the composer's later style with its curious, shifting harmonies, the almost Prokofiev-like grotesquerie of the outer movements and the focus on individual <b>instrumental</b> <b>tone</b> colors throughout (highlighted by his use of an alto saxophone in the opening dance). [...] The opening three-note motif, introduced quietly but soon reinforced by heavily staccato chords and responsible {{for much of the}} movement's rhythmic vitality, is reminiscent of the Queen of Shemakha's theme in Rimsky-Korsakov's opera The Golden Cockerel, the only music by another composer that he had taken out of Russia with him in 1917.|$|E
50|$|Aesthetics is a sub-discipline of philosophy. In the 20th century, {{important}} {{contributions to the}} aesthetics of music were made by Peter Kivy, Jerrold Levinson, Roger Scruton, and Stephen Davies. However, many musicians, music critics, and other non-philosophers {{have contributed to the}} aesthetics of music. In the 19th century, a significant debate arose between Eduard Hanslick, a music critic and musicologist, and composer Richard Wagner regarding whether instrumental music could communicate emotions to the listener. Wagner and his disciples argued that instrumental music could communicate emotions and images; composers who held this belief wrote <b>instrumental</b> <b>tone</b> poems, which attempted to tell a story or depict a landscape using instrumental music. Hanslick and his partisans asserted that instrumental music is simply patterns of sound that do not communicate any emotions or images. Harry Partch and some other musicologists, such as Kyle Gann, have studied and tried to popularize microtonal music and the usage of alternate musical scales. Many modern composers like La Monte Young, Rhys Chatham and Glenn Branca paid much attention to a system of tuning called just intonation.|$|E
40|$|Congenital amusia is a neurodevelopmental {{disorder}} that is characterized primarily by {{difficulties in the}} pitch domain. The aim {{of the present study}} was to investigate the perception of musical timbre in a group of individuals with congenital amusia by probing discrimination and short-term memory for real-world timbral stimuli as well as examining the ability of these individuals to sort <b>instrumental</b> <b>tones</b> according to their timbral similarity. Thirteen amusic individuals were matched with thirteen non-amusic controls on a range of background variables. The discrimination task included stimuli of two different durations and pairings of <b>instrumental</b> <b>tones</b> that reflected varying distances in a perceptual timbre space. Performance in the discrimination task was at ceiling for both groups. In contrast, amusic individuals scored lower than controls on the short-term timbral memory task. Amusic individuals also performed worse than controls on the sorting task, suggesting differences in the higher-order representation of musical timbre. These findings add to the emerging picture of amusia as a {{disorder that}} has consequences for the perception and memory of musical timbre, as well as pitch...|$|R
40|$|A {{new method}} for the {{analysis}} of inharmonic <b>instrumental</b> <b>tones</b> is presented. The method exploits an equation derived from the well-know inharmonic series equation, where the inharmonicity coefficient is balanced with the frequencies and numbers of any two partials extracted from a pseudo-harmonic series. A serial search for increasingly deviating spectral peaks is aided with the integrated refinement of increasingly reliable inharmonicity co-efficient and fundamental frequency estimates. This firsthand approach to the problem of evaluating inharmonic spectra brings about an unprecedented level of simplicity, efficiency and accu-racy. 1...|$|R
40|$|Timbre {{is a major}} {{attribute}} of sound perception and a key feature for the identification of sound quality. Here, we present event-related brain potentials (ERPs) obtained from sixteen healthy individuals while they discriminated complex <b>instrumental</b> <b>tones</b> (piano, trumpet, and violin) or simple sine wave tones that lack the principal features of timbre. Data analysis yielded enhanced N 1 and P 2 responses to <b>instrumental</b> <b>tones</b> relative to sine wave tones. Furthermore, we applied an electrical brain imaging approach using low-resolution electromagnetic tomography (LORETA) to estimate the neural sources of N 1 /P 2 responses. Separate significance tests of instrumental vs. sine wave tones for N 1 and P 2 revealed distinct regions as principally governing timbre perception. In an initial stage (N 1), timbre perception recruits left and right (peri-) auditory fields with an activity maximum over the right posterior Sylvian fissure (SF) and the posterior cingulate (PCC) territory. In the subsequent stage (P 2), we uncovered enhanced activity {{in the vicinity of}} the entire cingulate gyrus. The involvement of extra-auditory areas in timbre perception may imply the presence of a highly associative processing level which might be generally related to musical sensations and integrates widespread medial areas of the human cortex. In summary, our results demonstrate spatio-temporally distinct stages in timbre perception which not only involve bilateral parts of the peri-auditory cortex but also medially situated regions of the human brain associated with emotional and auditory imagery functions...|$|R
50|$|The first {{track on}} the album, The Rose Rooms drum beat has a bass-rich sound and synth, with ambient voices and a calming sound. Remembrance is a 7-minute-long {{instrumental}} that has light electric piano sounds and a dreamy synth, with ambient voices calling {{out from the}} background. Following that is The Love Room, which has a sound {{similar to that of}} The Rose Room with its bass rich drum beat, but has a bit of a darker, minor sound compared to the light, major chords ever-present in The Rose Room and Remembrance. The fourth track, Summer Lightning, is aptly named, for its dreamy bongo-esque drum beat and light dreamy instrumental noise about it. La Telecabine has a light sound that escalates to a pounding drum beat with dreamy instrumentals, and calming down as the song ends and transfers to Mr. Gone. Heavy Weather and Subway Freedom share the same vibe of an African-sounding bongo drum and a light <b>instrumental</b> <b>tone</b> that swiftly transitions to a louder, richer, and bass-enhanced sound, then calms down similar to Remembrance and Summer Lightning. Finally, Afterwards @ The Bar has a very calm, instrumental noise that ends the short-lived groups only album like its falling into a deep sleep.|$|E
40|$|Clinical {{assessment}} of orofacial muscle tone {{is of interest}} for differential diagnosis of the dysarthrias, but standardized procedures and normative data are lacking. In this study, perceptual ratings of tone were compared with instrumental measures of tissue stiffness for facial, lingual, and masticatory muscles in 70 individuals with dysarthria. Perceptual and <b>instrumental</b> <b>tone</b> data were discordant and failed to discriminate between five dysarthria types. These results raised concerns {{about the validity of}} Myoton- 3 stiffness measures in the orofacial muscles. Therefore, a second study evaluated contracted and relaxed orofacial muscles in 10 neurotypical adults. Results for the cheek, masseter, and lateral tongue surface followed predictions, with significantly higher tissue stiffness during contraction. In contradiction, stiffness measures from the superior surface of the tongue were lower during contraction. Superior-to-inferior tongue thickness was notably increased during contraction. A third study revealed that tissue thickness up to ~ 10 mm significantly affected Myoton- 3 measures. Altered tissue thickness due to neuromuscular conditions like spasticity and atrophy may have undermined the detection of group differences in the original sample of dysarthric speakers. These experiments underscore the challenges of assessing orofacial muscle tone and identify considerations for quantification of tone-related differences across dysarthria groups in future studies...|$|E
40|$|From {{ancient times}} to the present, music has been {{composed}} for instrumental combinations {{as well as for}} single instruments. The manner in which these combinations were utilized depended upon current compositional practices, especially those regarding form. In the Baroque Period instrumental ensembles were formed according to the composer 2 ̆ 7 s discretion. The tone color embodiment of a particular musical work was set more by the composer 2 ̆ 7 s choice of instruments {{to be included in the}} ensemble than in his use of instruments as independent tone color sources. The Baroque composer 2 ̆ 7 s use of instrumental color was in this way consistent with his use of highly integrated movements, which lacked sharp contrasts, a feeling of periodicity, or antecedent-consequent phrasing. The sustaining of one mood throughout an entire movement was accomplished compositionally through the elaboration of the theme in sequential repetitions of the phrases, and orchestrationally through full ensemble scoring. The Classical Period 2 ̆ 7 s concept of form was similarly reflected in its orchestrational technique. Larger works were organized into contrasting movements. These movements, in turn, were comprised of contrasting sections which themselves contained contrasting elements. A sense of unity Has maintained, in part, through the balancing of the movements within the larger work. This defining of the elements of form through the juxtaposition of contrasting phrases, sections and movements brought with it the juxtaposition of contrasting tone colors. Tone color now changed in phrase lengths. These changes served to highlight the formal elements. In the Romantic Period the regularity of the formal aspects diminished. The desire for contrast, however, remained and received new emphasis. The tone color was changed more freely and came to be considered an element or the composition rather than something which came after, and was therefore dependent upon, the composition. Impressionism placed such importance upon the change of <b>instrumental</b> <b>tone</b> color that it could stand as the dominant element of a composition. More recently, serial composers have sought to control t one color in the same marmer as they control pitch, dynamics range and expression, so that tone color might be made to change with each note. It can be seen, then, that through the course of recent musical history, the element of changing tone color has become more independent of other compositional aspects and that the composers of each historical period increased the rate of tone color change. While this historical precedent does not make further growth in this direction valid, it does indicate that further development in the direction of tone color independence and a further increase in the rate of change of tone color might be sought after at this time...|$|E
50|$|MMN is {{evoked by}} an {{infrequently}} presented stimulus ("deviant"), differing from the frequently-occurring stimuli ("standards") {{in one or}} several physical parameters like duration, intensity, or frequency (Näätänen, 1992). In addition, it is generated by a change in spectrally complex stimuli like phonemes, in synthesised <b>instrumental</b> <b>tones,</b> or in the spectral component of tone timbre. Also the temporal order reversals elicit an MMN when successive sound elements differ either in frequency, intensity, or duration. The MMN is not elicited by stimuli with deviant stimulus parameters when they are presented without the intervening standards. Thus, the MMN has been suggested to reflect change detection when a memory trace representing the constant standard stimulus and the neural code of the stimulus with deviant parameter(s) are discrepant.|$|R
30|$|Data-driven CAM: {{even though}} {{amplitude}} envelopes of musical instruments {{have proven to}} be difficult to model, different harmonics of the same source exhibit similar amplitude envelopes and can be, in many cases, highly correlated. This is known as CAM, and it is an important cue in human auditory perception [39]. Being CAM an observed characteristic in musical instrument spectra, some separation approaches have attempted to include CAM in their processing chains. In [15] for example, CAM is used as a mean to resolve overlapped harmonic components in a least squares estimation framework. In [40], the authors propose a spectro-temporal modeling of harmonic magnitudes and test their method on isolated instrument notes. They also test their estimation algorithm in the separation context by creating random mixes of a maximum of six <b>instrumental</b> <b>tones.</b>|$|R
30|$|The main {{contributions}} {{of this research}} work {{are listed in the}} following categorized as major and minor contributions. Major contributions: (1) an efficient method for pitch-informed solo/accompaniment separation based on spectral estimation of tone objects. The tone-based processing is a musically meaningful segmentation of the audio signal that allows the inclusion of known characteristics of <b>instrumental</b> <b>tones</b> such as the post-processing stage presented in Subsubsection 4.1. 5 and common amplitude modulation presented in Subsection 4.3 and (2) a novel method to include common amplitude modulation (CAM) characteristics in the separation scheme. Minor contributions: (3) a novel listening test setup to evaluate the use of solo/accompaniment separation in music education applications. Results from the listening test give clear directions on how to optimize separation algorithms to meet quality requirement of music education applications, and (4) collection of a new dataset for solo/accompaniment separation where both vocal and instrumental solos from different genres are included. The dataset is publicly available to the research community.|$|R
40|$|Previous work on {{multiple}} wavetable interpolation synthesis {{has focused on}} modeling single <b>instrumental</b> <b>tones,</b> using {{a different set of}} basis spectra for each. However, the amount of space used to store the wavetable banks needed to resynthesize many different tones would be reduced if {{at least some of the}} wavetables were selected for their general-purpose use in synthesizing multiple tones. This paper presents the results of our research on matching and synthesizing 198 tones played at various pitches by a variety of different instruments using common wavetable banks. We introduce two new techniques: the grouping of tones by pitch so that the highest expected partial frequency will be less than the Nyquist frequency, and the construction of shared wavetable banks by applying a clustering algorithm to all the breakpoint spectra of all the tones in a given group and selecting the spectrum nearest the centroid of each class as a basis spectrum. 1...|$|R

40|$|Pulse-resonance {{sounds like}} vowels or <b>instrumental</b> <b>tones</b> contain {{acoustic}} {{information about the}} physical size of the sound source (pulse rate) and body resonators (resonance scale). Previous research has revealed correlates of these variables in humans using functional neuroimaging. Here, we report two experiments that use magnetoencephalography to study the neuromagnetic representations of pulse rate and resonance scale in human auditory cortex. In experiment 1, auditory evoked fields were recorded from nineteen subjects presented with French horn tones, the pulse rate and resonance scale {{of which had been}} manipulated independently using a mucoder. In experiment 2, fifteen subjects listened to French horn tones which differed in resonance scale but which lacked pulse rate cues. The resulting cortical activity was evaluated by spatio-temporal source analysis. Changes in pulse rate elicited a well-defined N 1 m component with cortical generators located at the border between Heschl's gyrus and planum temporale. Changes in resonance scale elicited a second, independent, N 1 m component located in planum temporale. Our results demonstrate that resonance scale can be distinguished in its neuromagnetic representation from cortical activity related to the sound's pulse rate. Moreover, the existence of two separate components in the N 1 m sensitive to register information highlights the importance of this time window for the processing of frequency information in human auditory cortex.

Kumar felt that its utilization of sound could be [...] "the seed {{of a new}} way of using music in games". Casamassina commented, [...] "Few developers would be brave enough to create a title whose main character generates varying musical notes whenever he takes a step, but this is exactly what Chibi does - and it's actually very whimsical and cute." [...] Although many critics appreciated the bright and colorful features of the accompanying aesthetics, they also judged the graphical presentation as dated. Casamassina encountered low-polygon 3D models and a below-average frame rate; Satterfield stated the game operated at [...] "Dreamcast level". Other portions of Chibi-Robo! were assessed as unpolished as well. Several sources noted the game's default camera system to be unwieldy, combersome, or frustrating at times. However, Mueller noted that switching to the top-down or first-person viewpoints and the ability to center the camera behind Chibi-Robo alleviates most of its problems. Satterfield and Casamassina regarded the cutscenes as awkward and repetitive; the former of the two claimed that they [...] "amount to ugly characters recycling the same animation routine over and over while gibberish comes from their gaping maws". Kumar perceived the game's combat to be [...] "messy", [...] "uninteresting", and [...] "entirely unnecessary".|$|R

40|$|The {{assessment}} of the accuracy of Cantonese tone production can be performed by either perceptual judgement or an instrumental measure. The latter method, however, has not been investigated in detail. In particular, the relationship between perceptual judgement and an instrumental measure has not been fully delineated. The present study was undertaken to investigate the relationship between perceptual judgement and <b>instrumental</b> measures of <b>tones.</b> Perceptual and <b>instrumental</b> data from an experimental group of 15 adults (mean age = 33. 5 years, SD = 13. 1) were tested against a set of normative data which was provided by a control group of 56 young adults (mean age = 20. 9 years; SD = 1. 1) who were judged {{to be free from}} speech and tone production errors. The results revealed that six of the 15 adults in the experimental group were found to have tone production errors, mainly in tone 2 /tone 5 confusion.
