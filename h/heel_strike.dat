50|$|Typically, barefoot walking {{features}} heel or midfoot strike, while barefoot running features midfoot or forefoot strike. Barefoot running rarely features <b>heel</b> <b>strike</b> {{because the}} impact can be painful, the human heel pad not absorbing {{much of the}} force of impact. By contrast, 75% of runners wearing modern running shoes <b>heel</b> <b>strike,</b> running shoes being characterized by a padded sole, stiff soles and arch support, and sloping down from a more padded heel to a less padded forefoot.|$|E

40|$|Identifying criminals from CCTV footage {{is often}} a {{difficult}} task for crime investigations. The quality of CCTV is often low and criminals can cover their face and wear gloves (to withhold fingerprints) when committing a crime. Gait is the optimal choice in this circumstance since people can be recognised by their walking style, even at a distance with low resolution imagery. The location of the frame when the <b>heel</b> <b>strikes</b> the floor is essential for some gait analyses. We propose a new method to detect heel strikes: by radial acceleration which can also generalise to crime analysis. The frame and position of the <b>heel</b> <b>strikes</b> can be estimated by the quantity and the circle centres of radial acceleration, derived from the optical flow (using DeepFlow). Experimental results show high detection rate on two different gait databases and good robustness under different kinds of noise. We analysedetection of <b>heel</b> <b>strikes</b> to show robustness then we analyse crime scenes to show generalisation capability since violent crime often involves much acceleration. As such, we provide a new basis to a baseline technique in crime scene analysis...|$|R
5000|$|Sensory ataxia {{presents}} itself with an unsteady [...] "stomping" [...] gait with heavy <b>heel</b> <b>strikes,</b> {{as well as}} a postural instability that is usually worsened when the lack of proprioceptive input cannot be compensated for by visual input, such as in poorly lit environments.|$|R
50|$|The kata {{contains}} many palm <b>heel</b> <b>strikes</b> {{as well as}} evasive footwork. The open hand and crane fist techniques lend credibility to this kata having roots in Chinese kung fu. The techniques can be applied as short-distance strikes and grappling to immobilize and control the opponent.|$|R
50|$|Shortly {{before his}} 41st birthday, Graham earned his Yellow Belt in Tae Kwon Do, after a grueling day of testing. He broke a pine board with a Palm <b>Heel</b> <b>Strike.</b>|$|E
50|$|Observation: {{looking for}} symmetry, {{smoothness}} of movement, normal stride length, pelvic tilt, arm swing, normal <b>heel</b> <b>strike,</b> stance, toe-off, swing through {{and ability to}} turn with ease. Note any antalgic, trendelenburg, hemiplegic or parkinsonian gait features.|$|E
50|$|By {{changing}} the material hardness of the midsole, {{one will be}} able to change the EMG activity in various lower extremity muscles such as rectus femoris, biceps femoris, medial gastrocnemius, and tibialis anterior. Especially when running with the stiffer midsole, the EMG amplitude for tibialis anterior have shown to be significantly greater before the <b>heel</b> <b>strike</b> and lower following the <b>heel</b> <b>strike</b> than compared to the neutral midsole. Furthermore, walking in shoes with stiffer midsole appears to significantly reduce the energy dissipated at the metatarsophalangeal joints and aid in improving jumping performances and running economy. However, the underlying mechanisms that can be attributed to this improvement are still not fully understood.|$|E
5000|$|Tuck was {{expected}} to face Yosdenis Cedeno on June 7, 2014 at UFC Fight Night 42. [...] However, Cedeno {{pulled out of the}} bout in early May citing an injury and was replaced by promotional newcomer Jake Lindsey. He won the fight via submission in the third round due to <b>heel</b> <b>strikes</b> to the body.|$|R
50|$|Scientific {{research}} into the practice of running barefoot has not reached a clear consensus regarding its risks or its benefits. While footwear might provide protection from cuts, bruises, impact and weather, proponents of barefoot running argue that it {{reduces the risk of}} chronic injuries (notably repetitive stress injuries) caused by <b>heel</b> <b>striking</b> in padded running shoes.|$|R
5000|$|Lindsey {{made his}} promotional debut as a short notice {{replacement}} for an injured Yosdenis Cedeno and faced Jon Tuck on June 7, 2014 at UFC Fight Night 42. [...] After a competitive first two rounds, Lindsey {{was defeated by}} submission {{in the third round}} as he tapped to a series of <b>heel</b> <b>strikes</b> to the ribs.|$|R
5000|$|Barefoot runners run very {{differently}} from typical shod runners. Shod runners tend to <b>heel</b> <b>strike</b> {{due to the}} designs of the modern shoes, which have thick heels to reduce the impact force from the ground. When running barefoot, however, some runners tend to shift to a forefoot striking pattern to avoid such impact, which is equivalent to 2-3 times the body weight. [...] The forefoot strike is where the forefoot lands first, followed by the heels coming down. The midfoot strike {{is characterized by the}} heel and the ball of the foot landing at the same time, and <b>heel</b> <b>strike</b> is where the heel lands first followed by the forefoot.|$|E
5000|$|However, when {{comparing}} different populations of habitually barefoot runners, {{not all of}} them favor the forefoot strike. A 2012 study by Hatala et al. focusing on 38 runners of the Daasanach tribe in Kenya found that a majority of runners favored a <b>heel</b> <b>strike</b> instead of a forefoot strike. Presently, Hatala and Lieberman are comparing their data, but Lieberman did note that his study, which focused on the Kalenjin people, also found some barefoot runners favoring a <b>heel</b> <b>strike</b> as well. He also said that the Daasanach people were primarily, [...] "tall, lanky goat-herders who don't run nearly as much as the Kalenjin, who own many of the world's distance running records." ...|$|E
50|$|There {{is great}} {{difficulty}} in preventing the flexion {{of the trunk}} <b>heel</b> <b>strike</b> so the person may use trunk extension before <b>heel</b> <b>strike</b> to maintain balance causing a backwards lurch. The trunk lurches back on the stance phase side hyperextending.The backwards trunk lurch persists throughout the stance to maintain the gravitational force line behind the hip axis locking the hip into extension. There is an apparent forward protrusion of the affected hip due to exaggerated hip motion and the person may also hold the shoulders backward to keep {{the center of gravity}} behind the joint. The hamstring muscles often compensate for the gluteus maximus weakness resulting in a near normal gait pattern but most often theses muscles are affected together.|$|E
5000|$|Roeber {{began his}} running career in 1990, {{and has been}} running barefoot since October 2003. Previously, Roeber ran 18 marathons and {{thousands}} of miles with shoes. Roeber {{describes himself as a}} [...] "challenged" [...] runner when running with shoes, because he would over stride thereby <b>heel</b> <b>striking.</b> Since <b>heel</b> <b>striking</b> is a major cause of knee stress, Roeber continually injured his knees {{to the point where he}} would either need surgery to repair the damage or stop running altogether. After reading about how barefoot running forces proper technique, Roeber began his experiment with barefoot running. He subsidized his [...] "shod" [...] running with barefoot running for the next six months, until April 2004 when he ran the Boston Marathon barefoot. Since April 2004, Roeber has run exclusively barefoot, logging thousands of miles annually. In addition, he has completed dozens of barefoot marathons and one barefoot ultra marathon of 40 mi.|$|R
40|$|I {{conducted}} a study to determine whether ballet dancers {{with a history of}} shin splints make heel contact on ascent and descent from jumps less often than dancers without this history. Sixteen dancers were filmed as they executed a sequence of jumps at two different speeds. Eight of the subjects had a history of shin-splint pain; eight had no such history. The film was viewed on a Super 8 movie projector. Heel contacts on ascent and descent from jumps were counted. Double <b>heel</b> <b>strikes</b> (<b>heel</b> rise between landing and pushing off) were also counted. A nonparametric t test showed no {{differences between the two groups}} in the number of contacts on ascent or descent. The dancers with a history of shin splints, however, demonstrated more double <b>heel</b> <b>strikes</b> (p =. 02) than the other group. Clinically, this finding may represent a lack of control or a tight Achilles tendon or both. Further study is necessary to confirm these theories. For treatment and prevention of shin splints, a clinician must evaluate a dancer's jumping technique and then provide systematic training to develop the skill, strength, flexibility, and coordination that make up control...|$|R

5000|$|Nike {{claims that}} Shox not only absorb impact from <b>heel</b> <b>strike</b> while running, but also claims they [...] "spring back" [...] and add {{more power to}} a runner's stride. Aside from this alleged boost in speed, the Shox is {{supposed}} to provide superior shock absorption with high-tech elastic foam.|$|E
50|$|This rolling inwards {{motion as}} the foot {{progresses}} from heel to toe {{is the way}} that the body naturally absorbs shock. Neutral pronation is the most ideal, efficient type of gait when using a <b>heel</b> <b>strike</b> gait; in a forefoot strike, the body absorbs shock instead via flexation of the foot.|$|E
50|$|Initial contact (IC): The {{point in}} the gait cycle when the foot {{initially}} makes contact with the ground; this represents {{the beginning of the}} stance phase. It is suggested that <b>heel</b> <b>strike</b> not be a term used in clinical gait analysis as in many circumstances initial contact is not made with the heel. Suggestion: Should use foot strike.|$|E
50|$|The {{footprints}} {{themselves were}} an unlikely discovery because they closely resemble modern human footprints, despite being almost 4 million years old. It is {{noted that the}} toe pattern {{is much the same}} as the human foot, which is much different than the feet of chimpanzees and other non-bipedal beings. The footprint impression has been interpreted as the same as the modern human stride, with the <b>heel</b> <b>striking</b> first and then a weight transfer to the ball of the foot before pushing off the toes.|$|R
50|$|Whereas {{in normal}} gait, the <b>heel</b> <b>strikes</b> {{the ground before}} the toes (also called heel-to-toe walking), in Parkinsonian gait, motion is characterised by flat foot strike (where the entire foot {{is placed on the}} ground at the same time) or less often and in the more {{advanced}} stages of the disease by toe-to-heel walking (where the toes touch the ground before the heel). In addition, PD patients have reduced foot lifting during the swing phase of gait, which produces smaller clearance between the toes and the ground.|$|R
5000|$|In barefoot locomotion, {{the impact}} force (impact transient) {{on the ground}} is diminished {{compared}} to shod running. It has been suggested that unshod runners are better {{able to take advantage of}} elastic energy storage in the Achilles tendon and arch of the foot, and can avoid potential injury due to repetitive impact of the heel bone (calcaneus) due to <b>heel</b> <b>striking.</b> [...] However, the long-term and actual health benefits of unshod running are still not well understood and remain an area of active research.|$|R
5000|$|Harper {{recruited}} local {{runners and}} store employees to test out prototype shoes where the heel and forefoot {{were the same}} distance from the ground. The design proved to allow a more natural running experience where footfalls are {{in the mid to}} forefoot area instead of the more typical <b>heel</b> <b>strike.</b> Harper called this design [...] "Zero Drop".|$|E
50|$|A. afarensis is an obligate bipedal hominin {{with the}} {{beginnings}} of sexual dimorphism attributed to its species, and brain size {{very similar to that}} of modern chimpanzees and gorillas. Analysis of the Laetoli footprints indicated the characteristics of obligate bipedalism: pronounced <b>heel</b> <b>strike</b> from deep impressions, lateral transmission of force from the heel {{to the base of the}} lateral metatarsal, a well-developed medial longitudinal arch, adducted big toe, and a deep impression for the big toe commensurate with toe-off.|$|E
50|$|Patients with Parkinson's disease {{have reduced}} impact at <b>heel</b> <b>strike</b> and this {{mechanism}} {{has been found}} to be related to the disease severity with impact decreasing as the disease progresses. Also, Parkinson patients show a trend towards higher relative loads in the forefoot regions combined with a load shift towards medial foot areas. This load shift is believed to help in compensating for postural imbalance. The intra-individual variability in foot strike pattern is found to be surprisingly lower in PD patients compared with normal people.|$|E
5000|$|So called 'traditional' {{running shoes}} are {{designed}} to give more support and cushion the landing to reduce the effects of impact. They allow for more comfortable running on hard surfaces such as asphalt and also protect the foot when stepping on rocks or other potentially sharp objects. However, the cushioning provided in traditional running shoes is thought to encourage a foot strike pattern, where the heel lands first. <b>Heel</b> <b>striking</b> generates a relatively large amount of impact force that can put {{different parts of the}} lower extremities under excessive stress.|$|R
30|$|Walking {{speed was}} {{calculated}} using step length multiplied by cadence. Stride length was measured between consecutive <b>heel</b> <b>strikes</b> {{of the same}} foot. Right step length and left step length were measured as {{the distance between the}} point of initial contact of 1 foot and the point of initial contact of the opposite foot. Step length was calculated as the average of right and left step lengths. Subsequently, the ratios of step length to height and step length to lower-limb length were derived. Cadence was defined as the number of steps taken in a given time, and walk ratio was calculated as the ratio of step length to cadence.|$|R
40|$|<b>Heel</b> <b>strikes</b> {{from walking}} people {{generate}} impulses that propagate as Rayleigh waves {{that can be}} measured by seismic sensors. The time of arrival of these waves dependent upon both {{the location of the}} sensors and the propagation medium, which is usually not known. Hence, associating measured signals to an individual person is difficult. In this paper, we present two approaches for grouping the time of arrival measurements of the impulses and use them to estimate the number of targets using an iFilter implemented as a particle filter. The algorithms are used to process the actual data collected using distributed seismic sensors and their results also presented...|$|R
50|$|Walking barefoot {{results in}} a more natural gait. People {{who are used to}} walking barefoot tend to land less forcefully, {{eliminating}} the hard <b>heel</b> <b>strike</b> and generating much less collision force in the foot and lower leg. A 2006 study found that shoes may increase stress on the knee and ankle, and suggested that adults who walked barefoot may have a lower rate of osteoarthritis, although more study is required to elucidate the factors that distribute loads in shod and barefoot walking. A 2007 study examined 180 modern humans and compared their feet with 2,000-year-old skeletons. They concluded that, before the invention of shoes, humans overall had healthier feet. A 1991 study found that children who wore shoes were {{three times more likely to}} have flat feet than those who did not, and suggested that wearing shoes in early childhood can be detrimental to the longitudinal arch of the foot. Children who habitually go barefoot were found to have stronger feet, with better flexibility and mobility, fewer deformities like flat feet or toes that curve inwards, and fewer complaints. Walking barefoot enables a more natural gait, eliminating the hard <b>heel</b> <b>strike</b> and instead, allowing for a rocking motion of the foot from heel to toe. Similarly, barefoot running usually involves an initial forefoot strike, instead of on the rear of the foot, generating smaller collision forces.|$|E
50|$|At <b>heel</b> <b>strike</b> the {{vertical}} ground reaction force is located posterior to {{the axis of}} rotation of the ankle joint. An external plantar flexion moment is created which must be resisted by an internal dorsiflexion moment. Once the foot is flat and the trunk glides forward over the stance foot, an internal plantar flexion moment is generated to decelerate the forward motion of the body’s center of mass. From mid-stance to toe off, however, this moment continues but {{the function of the}} plantar flexors switches over to accelerating the knee into extension and propelling the center of mass forward.|$|E
5000|$|One common {{arrangement}} is an ISO 559 (26-inch) rear wheel and an ISO 406 or ISO 451 (20-inch) front wheel. The small front wheel and large rear wheel combination {{is used to}} keep the pedals and front wheel clear of each other, avoiding the problem on a short wheelbase recumbent called [...] "heel strike" [...] (where the rider's heels catch the wheel in tight turns). A pivoting-boom front-wheel drive (PBFWD aka Moving Bottom Bracket recumbent) configuration also overcomes <b>heel</b> <b>strike</b> since the pedals and front wheel turn together. PBFWD bikes may have dual 26 in wheels or larger.|$|E
50|$|Stride length {{refers to}} the {{distance}} {{in the direction of}} forward motion that is between <b>heel</b> <b>strikes</b> of successive footfalls or steps. During the gait cycle, amputees have characteristically shorter time spent in the stance phase on the prosthetic limb compared to the intact limb. Stride length is arguably the most visible of the changes in amputee gait because it creates such an asymmetry between the intact and impaired limbs. However, the shorter stance time may help the amputee compensate for the greater margin of error of the prosthetic limb, and several sources suggest the shorter strides are beneficial towards maintaining a straight walking path.|$|R
40|$|Abstract – Human motion {{analysis}} {{has received a}} great attention from researchers {{in the last decade}} due to its potential use in different applications. We propose a new approach to extract human joints (Vertex positions) using a model-based method. The gait pattern is incorporated to aid the extraction process, where model templates are established through analysis of gait motion. People walk normal to the viewing plane, as major gait information is available in a sagittal view. Gait periodicity and other parameters are estimated by finding the <b>heel</b> <b>strikes.</b> The ankle, knee and hip joints are successfully extracted with high accuracy for indoor and outdoor data. In this way, we have established a baseline analysis which can be deployed in recognition, marker-less analysis and other areas...|$|R
40|$|An {{automated}} {{approach is}} proposed which can analyze ground reaction force data from bipedal walking robots and humans. The input of the automated analysis is {{the raw data}} from force sensors mounted in the feet of a robot. The output is detailed information, such as detected single support, double support, and swing phases, their durations, timings of events like <b>heel</b> <b>strikes,</b> properties of the phase transitions and of the robot itself. The proposed approach is generic, parameter-free, model-free, robust, computationally efficient, and applicable for real-time use during walking. It can detect early indications of instability {{that could lead to}} a fall of the robot. Three real-world experiments are presented: with a compliant bipedal robot, with a stiff humanoid robot, and with a human subject. © 2012 IEEE...|$|R
