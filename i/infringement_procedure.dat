50|$|To a {{large degree}} European Union {{environmental}} policy is based on directives which are only minimum requirements and allow for adaptation to the regulatory requirements and systems of the European member states. Thus, the transposition may differ slightly country by country around Europe. Once a given member state had written its national law, it notifies its regulation with the EU Commission. If a member state violates the provisions in its national transcription, the EU Commission is asking the authorities in the given member state {{to make the necessary}} changes.

40|$|Summary - {{document}} has {{no additional}} text]. What happens when member {{states do not}} comply with EU law? To answer this question, {{the role of the}} EU Commission as guardian of the treaties demands particular attention, especially the instruments it may employ, and the enforcement policy it actually pursues, against member states that violate binding EU rules. Our qualitative data on how fifteen member states have transposed a sample of six EU social policy Directives allows us to confront the Commission’s enforcement policy with the "real" amount of domestic transposition failures. We thus challenge the approach taken by much of the existing literature, which looks {{at the tip of the}} iceberg only by restricting itself to the analysis of available data on EU <b>infringement</b> <b>procedures.</b> This allows us to reject or validate some of the most dominant assumptions in this literature about the logics of Commission enforcement policy. We show that enforcement often does not take place at all or does not take place in a consistent manner when compared to the Commission’s own rules. Moreover, we demonstrate that the Commission heavily focuses on non-notification rather than on incorrect transposition. One of the explanations is that <b>infringement</b> <b>procedures</b> are constrained by the length and complexity of the Commision’s internal procedures. Although our data suggest significant diversity in the treatment of different member states, we argue that this is not the result of political favouritism but of the necessity to prioritise some cases over others under the conditions of administrative overload. Our sample shows that these prioritisations often follow different Directives. It seems that the choice is made largely by the responsible unit and depends on its workload, the complexity of the Directive, and the overall importance attached to the respective policy. Furthermore, we show that neither the general level of labour law protection, nor the level of misfit with pre-existing national policies, nor opposition during the negotiations determine the Commission’s enforcement policy – even though the last factor does have some influence. Finally, we discuss kick-start, acceleration and correction as different effects that <b>infringement</b> <b>procedures</b> had in the implementation processes under scrutiny. Overall we conclude that infringement proceedings as they are practised today are a rather inadequate instrument for assuring compliance, even though the situation would be even worse if there were none at all...|$|R

40|$|The European Union’s <b>infringement</b> <b>procedure</b> {{is highly}} legalized. Nevertheless, {{as in other}} {{international}} institutions, non-compliance occurs {{on a regular basis}} and its transformation into compliance varies across EU infringement stages and over time. State of the art compliance literature focuses mainly on country-specific explanations, such as power, capacity, and legitimacy. In particular power-capacity models explain a good part of whether non-compliance occurs and how quickly it can be resolved. Yet, these approaches leave substantial parts of the empirical variation that we observe unexplained. This paper argues that policy and, in particular, rule-specific variables – although often neglected – are important for explaining non-compliance. Based on a quantitative analysis, we show that policy matters not only for the frequency with which EU law is violated, but also the persistence of non-compliance over time and over the different stages of the <b>infringement</b> <b>procedure.</b> European law; Europeanization; Europeanization...|$|E

While it brings great opportunities to European citizens in theory, in practice, delayed and incorrect implementation of single market rules leave EU citizens with a highly fragmented ‘regulatory patchwork’, deterring citizens and businesses from exercising their rights. One way to solve such a problem is to turn to formal proceedings such as to the European Commission and its role as ‘Guardian of the Treaties’ and Treaty articles 258 - 260 TFEU, i. e. the <b>infringement</b> <b>procedure</b> or to a national court.

Based on enforcement and management theories, we predict that conflict in the Council speeds up the transposition process. In addition, we control for the instigation of <b>infringement</b> <b>procedures</b> by the Commission and expect a weaker effect of conflict {{in cases where the}} Commission disagrees with a directive and if directives grant more discretion to member states. These hypotheses are tested using two indicators of conflict: heterogeneity and polarization. Cox regression analysis is applied with timedependent effects and with a shared frailty to control for the multilevel structure of the data. The analyses show that, over time, conflict has an increasing negative effect on delays. ...|$|R
