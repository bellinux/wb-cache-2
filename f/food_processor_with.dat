5000|$|Burmese tofu (တိုဖူး; [...] or [...] ) is a food of Shan origin, {{made from}} water and flour ground from yellow split peas and the Burmese version of {{chickpea}} flour, {{also known as}} besan flour, in a fashion similar to polenta. The flour is mixed with water, turmeric, and a little salt and heated, stirring constantly, until it reaches a creamy consistency. It is then transferred into a tray and allowed to set. It can also be made using dried chickpea instead of processed flour. In this process, dried chickpeas are soaked overnight. Once the peas have been re-hydrated, they are pureed in a <b>food</b> <b>processor</b> <b>with</b> some of the liquid used to soak the peas, then allowed to set {{for a couple of}} hours. Much of the top layer of clear liquid is then skimmed off and the remaining puree is brought to a boil with turmeric and salt and cooked and set {{in the same manner as}} the version using chickpea flour. It is matte yellow in colour, jelly-like but firm in consistency, and does not crumble when cut or sliced. It may be eaten fresh as a salad or deep fried. It may also be sliced and dried to make crackers for deep frying. Despite the name, Burmese tofu is unrelated to Chinese tofu, which is made from soy milk with added coagulants.|$|E

[...] The Boston Globe opined that the [...] "fallout from Star Wars space garbage continues to litter the motion picture screen". The review found the special effects and plot to be poor and that the robots and villains were not as funny or interesting as R2-D2 or Darth Vader respectively. The Washington Star compared the film to the television series Battlestar Galactica (1978) stating {{that it would make}} [...] "an American hold his head up high with pride" [...] in comparison.

40|$|The {{nutritional}} value of barley in supplying a western diet {{with a high}} fibre, low fat and low GI alternative to other less nutritious grains is beginning to be realised. The availability of agronomically viable waxy hulless barley will enable Australian <b>food</b> <b>processors</b> to utilise this valuable food grain. Processing techniques such as pearling, milling and flaking (rolling) enable barley to be utilised {{in a variety of}} food products. The availability of waxy hulless barley will provide food manufacturers with a fast cooking grain (whole or pearled) with excellent pearling and flaking quality with a high content of beta-glucan. This soluble fibre has been shown to lower blood cholesterol in humans thus reducing risk of heart disease. It has also been extracted for numerous end-uses, such as bio-films, wound dressings and nutritional supplements. We have compared the physical grain quality, pearling, cooking, baking and flaking quality of Australian waxy hulless barley with other hulless and covered barleys. The quality attributes of waxy hulless barley will be discussed in the context of potential products and market opportunities. Other end-uses for waxy barley will also be discussed. The South Australian Barley Improvement Program has bred waxy hulless barleys with considerable improvements in agronomy and food quality characteristics compared to older waxy cultivars. New waxy hulless cultivars will provide <b>food</b> <b>processors</b> <b>with</b> an alternative health related ingredient and will benefit farmers by offering a value-added grain to the food market. Waxy hulless barley will also provide a nutritious, versatile food product aimed at improving the Australian diet. Jennifer M. Washington and Amanda J. Box[URL]...|$|R
40|$|Near {{infrared}} (NIR) spectroscopy is a rapid, non-destructive analytical technique {{which has}} been used in the food and agriculture industries for almost 20 years. Ireland {{was one of the first}} countries in the world to adopt this method for national trading purposes and the grain trade has used it for off-farm and in-process analysis since 1981. However, other sectors have been slower to realise its potential and as part of a process of demonstrating the role which it may play in monitoring quality in a range of food industry applications, a programme of research and development has been on-going within Teagasc and its predecessor An Foras Talúntais. NIR spectroscopy provides the <b>food</b> <b>processor</b> <b>with</b> information. This information may describe how much of a given substance is present in a mixture or how the overall quality of the substance compares to a reference material e. g. a previous batch of raw material, finished goods or a competitor’s product. This report provides some examples of precompetitive R&D on representative qualitative and quantitative problems in a range of foods and food ingredients. The use of NIR spectra collected within 24 hours of slaughter to predict beef tenderness 14 days later shows considerable promise. Non-destructive monitoring of flesh composition in farmed salmon has paved the way for the efficient use of expensive feed materials while the content of each species in binary mixtures of minced beef and lamb has been accurate enough to suggest the use of NIR spectroscopy as a rapid screening tool by regulatory agencies, food processors and retailers. Classification of a range of food ingredients (including skim milk powder and flour) into one of a number of functionally-discrete categories has been successfully achieved with levels of accuracy high enough to warrant immediate industry utilisation i. e. greater than 90 % for skim milk powders and 97 % in the case of flour. Species confirmation in a number of raw minced meats (chicken, turkey, pork, beef and lamb) has been achieved with over 90 % accuracy in feasibility studies. Calibrations transferred from one NIR instrument to another lose accuracy because of differences in instrument construction, sample presentation and other factors. A research effort has recently been applied to this problem of transferability and results are available for both scanning and fixed filter instruments. The success achieved opens the way for using NIR results obtained in different companies or countries as an uncontested basis for trade. End of Project Repor...|$|E
40|$|BACKGROUND: Malnutrition {{is common}} among {{long-term}} care (LTC) residents, {{yet there is}} limited research on micronutrient (vitamin and mineral) malnutrition in the LTC setting. Micronutrient deficiencies may exacerbate symptoms of dementia, depression, infections, osteoporosis, and other prevalent conditions in LTC. PURPOSE: This research accomplishes phase 1 of a multi-phase study, with the overall research objective of investigating the potential and extent of micronutrient malnutrition in LTC and identifying and developing food-first strategies to improve micronutrient intake in LTC residents. This was done through four sub-studies (detailed below) : METHODS & FINDINGS: Each method and respective findings/conclusions are described below. Sub-Studies 1 and 2 : Scoping Review Observational (SRO) and Intervention (SRI) [...] Methods: A rigorous scoping review was conducted using selected key terms in four health-related electronic databases. The initial search identified 2248 eligible titles and abstracts for screening with inclusion/exclusion criteria. Results: SRO (n= 50 citations) : Intake for vitamin D, folate, calcium, vitamin E and B 6 were consistently < 50 % of the Recommended Dietary Allowance (RDA) regardless of divergent food intake assessment methods. More than one study found biomarkers to be low for vitamin D, C, folate, and iron in LTC residents. SRI (n= 25 citations) : Vitamin D and calcium were the most common micronutrients {{to be included in}} both pill supplementation and food fortification interventions. Different formulations (e. g. single vs. multi-nutrient) were trialed, making comparisons difficult. Supplementation and fortification demonstrated efficacy but no studies comparing these strategies were identified. Conclusion: Findings suggest that micronutrient intake and biochemical status are suboptimal for key nutrients in LTC. Single nutrient interventions predominated and more work on efficacy of multi-nutrient physiological doses, whether in supplemental or fortification formulations is needed. Limited fortification studies have been completed and {{there is a need to}} determine efficacy for prevention as compared to supplementation. More research on fortification doses and formulations that are acceptable and efficacious is also required. Menu Analysis (MA) and Super-Menus (SM) [...] Methods: Regular, non-therapeutic menus (week 1, all meals) from diverse LTC homes (n= 5) across Canada were analyzed for micronutrient content using <b>Food</b> <b>Processor</b> <b>with</b> the Canadian Nutrient File. EaTracker was used to determine Canada’s Food Guide servings. Site dietitians provided home recipes/portion sizes, and validated menu analyses. SM were designed to meet micronutrient needs without increasing volume and calories, considering the preferences and portion sizes used in LTC. Results: Despite planning to and generally meeting CFG recommendations, menus’ nutrient content varied significantly across homes. Micronutrients of greatest concern across all menus were vitamins D (8. 90 ± 5. 29 µg/d) and E (5. 13 ± 1. 74 mg/d). Folate, magnesium, and potassium were also below recommended values. SM were significantly higher in several nutrients as compared to home menus, but still were unable to meet vitamin D (11. 2 ± 2. 54 µg, mean 56 % RDA), E (12. 6 ± 4. 08, 84 % RDA) and potassium (4018 ± 489 mg, 85 %) recommendations. Conclusion: Evidently, current guidelines for menu planning may be inadequate to address micronutrient needs, and more nutrient-dense strategies need to be explored in LTC. Careful menu planning results in most micronutrients recommendations being met. Acceptability Testing (AT) [...] Prior to implementation, potential interventions should be assessed for their need, feasibility, and acceptability with knowledge users. Methods: Online LTC Staff webinar focus groups, expert Key Informant interviews and in-person focus groups (residents and family) were conducted to develop and determine the acceptability of a micronutrient fortification strategy. Polling and rating questions provided quantitative data to confirm qualitative data. Results: Focus groups and key informant interviews provided insight into potential food vehicles for fortification (e. g. soups, desserts, condiments), production and regulatory issues, and helped to develop the strategy to minimize anticipated barriers and promote uptake. Development of outsourced/pre-made fortified products was the preferred intervention, with mandatory training and clear protocols for preparers to ensure appropriate use. Conclusion: Knowledge users can envision food fortification as a potential intervention if products are easy to access and incorporate into current production systems. All stakeholders desire efficacy research to support use of this strategy in LTC. OVERALL CONCLUSION: Triangulation of methods (SRI, SRO, MA/SM, and AT) and findings offers a multidimensional understanding of potential micronutrient deficiencies in LTC and food-first strategies that can be used to prevent this form of malnutrition. In general, food-first interventions in LTC to prevent or ameliorate micronutrient deficiency are lacking and quality menu planning using the DRI as a guide and food fortification are plausible strategies. Further work is needed to determine the relationship between micronutrient intake and biomarkers of function; does sufficient micronutrient nutrition support the overall health and quality of life of residents. Greater knowledge and awareness of micronutrient qualities of foods and of best practices in food-preparation methods through better training and education of LTC health providers is needed. As a food fortification strategy is further developed, involvement of multi-level stakeholders is needed to ensure uptake. This work provides foundation for a micronutrient food fortification strategy to address malnutrition in LTC. 4 month...|$|E

Consumption of whole grain foods, including whole wheat bread, {{has been linked}} to reduced risk of coronary heart disease, type II diabetes, certain cancers, and all cause mortality, but consumption falls far below recommended levels. Conventional wisdom dictates that refined bread is better liked than whole wheat bread, but support for this contention is scarce.

The {{interest in the}} research of edible film which has many advantages and applications has increased during last decade. There is a particular interest {{in the use of}} antimicrobial biopreservatives in edible films and to increase food safety without application of chemical preservatives. In this study,we have developed antimicrobial or protective edible films by incorporation of antimicrobial enzyme lactoperoxidase or protective cultures (Lactobacillus delbrueckii subsp. lactis and Lactobacillus plantarum) into alginate films, respectively. The main objective of this research was to increase food safety by using lactoperoxidase or lactic acid bacteria incorporated into alginate films. The results obtained in the study showed that in reaction mixtures, the lactoperoxidase system has antimicrobial activity against E. coli, L. innocua, and P. fluorescens. The developed lactoperoxidase incorporated antimicrobial films also reduced the total microbial load of a selected seafood during cold storage. The lactic acid bacteria, used in edible films for the first time, also successfully incorporated into alginate films. The bacteria showed sufficient stability in alginate films and at surface of red meat during cold storage. The results of this study clearly showed the good potential of using lactoperoxidase and lactic acid bacteria incorporated alginate films in food packaging. The developed films can be used in antimicrobial packaging or protective packaging. However, further studies are needed to show the beneficial effects of developed films on different food systems...|$|R
