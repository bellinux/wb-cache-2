For that reason, {{it is no longer}} necessary to provide <b>eitheir</b> for transfer o f the time parameter by radio waves from station to station and from station to vehicle, or for its treatment as an additional unknown in the equations. This situation makes it possible to constitute time frequency navigation systems with many advantages, namely direct access to circulator spheric modes, this possibility giving higher accuracy and reduced sensitivity to geometric parameters...|$|E

This commitment was in direct contradiction with the aspirations of Palestinian Arabs, who, like their "brothers" in Syria and Iraq, wanted to acquire full political sovereignty, <b>eitheir</b> within a unified Arab state (Faysal's Arab Kingdom of 1920) or within Mandate Palestine. Given their contradictory expectations, a struggle between the two communities was inevitable and both tried to enlist outside support: the Zionism relied mainly on the Jewish diaspora and the British imperial power (until 1939), while the Palestinians relied on the Arab and the Islamic world [...] ...|$|E
40|$|The {{agricultural}} {{scientific research}} institutions constitute the vertebral tier {{of the world}} system. <b>Eitheir</b> the research institutions are under the national agricultural form, or they are under the form of agricultural research councils, that act as coordination bodies of the regional or local specialized research institutions, that form the biggest part of the research capacities in each region of the world. In the present study, I chose France because it has an agricultural surface of almost 30 million hectares, that represents {{more than a half}} of the total surface of its territory. The lands situated on one side {{and on the other side}} of 45 North latitude paralel allow a large variety of production. About 61 % of the agricultural surface of the country is occupied with crops, 35 % pastures and 4 % vineyards. The paper makes an analysis of the research in the agricultural sector, in France and it highlights its main positive particularities, that apply also in other European Union countries...|$|E
40|$|A {{two state}} model for opinion forming, which has proven {{heuristic}} power, is reviewed {{with a novel}} emphasis on the existence or absence of a threshold for the dynamics. Monitored by repeated small groups discussions floater agents update their opinion according to a local majority rule. A threshold makes the initial supports to flow towards <b>eitheir</b> one of two opposite attractors with only one single opinion. While odd sizes yield a threshold at fifty percent even sizes, which allow the inclusion of doubt at an opinion tie, produces a threshold shift toward either 0 or 1 giving rise to minority opinion spreading. Considering heterogeneous agents like contrarians and inflexibles turn the dynamics threshold less beyond sone critical values. One unique attractor at fifty-fifty drives then the dynamics. In addition inflexibles can generate asymmetry and if one sided they erase the threshold ensuring the associated opinion to eventually gain the all population support. It may shed a new and counter intuitive light on some social aspect of the global warming phenomenon. Comment: 10 pages, 9 figure...|$|E

40|$|One of {{the main}} tergets of the econoimic reform is {{creating}} conditions for State enterprises to conduct land organize their economic activity independently. In {{order to do that}} intermediate organs of economic administration had to be eliminated (i. e. units superior to enterprises. In the light of the presently binding statutes of September 25, 1981 the enterprise enjoyes a broad range of rights in respect of decisionmaking. To a very limited degree the role of former superior units was adopted by the founding organs. Yet they can still interfere in enterprises' affaires with the use of legal measures of supervision only in cases provised for in the law. The founding organs though have wide rights to supervise and evaluate enterprises and their managing organs. Nevertheless, upon excersising their supervising competence they have no rights to undertake acts of high authority towards the enterprises. Still, the situation is not altogether clear in face of still existing validity of numerous provisions enacted before the impelememtation of the economic reform. The need to respect independence of enterprises calls <b>eitheir</b> for a change in those provisions or for revoking them. That concerns mostly labor law and administrative procedure regulations. Thus there is a series of propositions which ought to be discussed in course of preparing changes in labor code.

40|$|The present chapter aims at {{describing}} the main biological characteristics of two oyster species, both important for their commercial values. Oyster spermatozoa {{belong to the}} "aquasperm" according to ultra-structural data: they possess an acrosome and four mitochondria. The sperm flagellum is devoid of progressive motility <b>eitheir</b> in the gonads or at spawning in sea water. In both cases, flagellar motility (% of moving cells) appears slowly in a time dependent manner in natural sea water (5 to 15 min). This ability to acquire potentiality for motility (maturation process) can be accelerated by sperm incubation with drugs like serotonine, theophilline, caffeine or dibutyryl-cAMP, which rapidly initiate progressive movement of live sperm. All drugs are effective in a time dependent manner and especially caffeine and theophilline are shown {{to act in a}} concentration dependent manner. These drugs allow forwardly directed translation for the majority of sperm cells. Furtheremore, spermatozoa induced to such efficient swimming behavior exhibit fertilizing performances of high levelDuring hatchery practices, oyster sperm are frequently collected by scarification of the male gonad; alternatively, ejaculation can be induced by various methods. According to our results, injection of compounds such as serotonine (1 to 10 mM) in the male gonad leads to release of sperm in sea water. By dilution into regular sea water, live oyster spermatozoa obtained by scarification show initially mostly erratic movements with poor efficiency for forward translation and initiate efficient flagellar motility after several minutes. Motility of black-lip pearl oyster spermatozoa appears gradually when spermatozoa are transferred into alkaline sea water. This motility-activating effect is reversed when pH is shifted back to acidic values; as in normal sea water, activity of sperm (% motile cells) increases gradually after alkaline pH activation and lasts for several minutes. The characteristics of these fully motile spermatozoa are described in details at the level of flagella: the wave amplitude and wave-length range 6 μm and 15 μm respectively, while the flagellar beat frequency is approximately 49 Hz. The velocity of sperm displacement is ranging 230 μm/sec. The swimming tracks are almost circular: the head trajectories describe portions of circles intercalated with small linear segments. Spermatozoa saved in natural sea water at 4 °C retain potent motility for several days and can be subsequently activated by alkaline sea water. In case of the Pacific oyster, motility appears also to be under the control of acidic pH. This would explain how motility activation occurs when inactive sperm in seminal fluid (pH 5. 5) comes in contact with sea water (pH 8. 0) at shedding. Sperm movement is hasting for a long period (Pacific oyster: 20 to 72 h), suggesting spermatozoa could restore their energy stores. Therefore, the cessation of Pacific oyster sperm movement is unlikely caused by an insufficient concentation of ATPThis book chapter intends to describe in both species details of the present knowledge on the characteristics of spermatozoa, including their swimming behaviour in relation with their energetic content (ATP) and their ability to be sustained by mitochondrial respiration, in a comparative way with other marine animals...|$|E
