5|$|Beginning in {{the early}} 1970s, the Bureau of Land Management {{identified}} damaged riparian zones and began projects to restore natural habitat <b>in</b> <b>those</b> <b>areas.</b> Approximately 20,000 willow trees were planted along streams, small dams were put together to create more pools in the streams, and fencing was added to protect riparian zones from grazing. Next, the agency sought to reform land-use plans to change grazing practices, which became a complex and controversial project.|$|E
5|$|Historically, {{the grape}} was {{fermented}} and shipped north to Tuscany and Piedmont, {{where it was}} used as a blending grape to enhance the body of thin red wines produced <b>in</b> <b>those</b> <b>areas.</b> When the link between Primitivo and Zinfandel began to emerge, plantings in the region and production of non-blended varietal increased. Today most Italian Primitivo is made as a rustic, highly alcoholic red wine with up to 16% alcohol by volume (ABV). Some Italian winemakers age the wines in new American oak to imitate American-style Zinfandel.|$|E

M-numbered trunklines are designated along a variety of roads, including eight-lane freeways in urban areas, four-lane rural freeways and expressways, principal arterial highways, and two-lane highways in remote rural areas.
