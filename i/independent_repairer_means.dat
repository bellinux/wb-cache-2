40|$|A {{buyer of}} a new car is often offered a various {{selection}} of warranties. A warranty can e. g. exist {{in the form of}} an extended new car warranty. However, some manufacturers demand that the car has to be serviced by an authorised repairer for the validity of an extended warranty. In the thesis I analyse whether such a contractual term is incompatible with today’s legislation and I argue for when such a term is to be seen as unfair. Contractual terms can, according to Swedish legislation, be forbidden if they are unfair to consumers or to the competitors of the one who states the terms. The term stipulating that a car has to be serviced by an authorised repairer for the continued validity of an extended warranty must also be investigated bearing in mind the block exemption for the car sector, regulation nr 1400 / 2002. Further, some comparison with Swedish and foreign practise within the subject is made. Briefly, my conclusion is that terms stipulating that a car has to be serviced by an authorised repairer for the continued validity of an extended warranty should be forbidden. The term has a negative effect on the competition within the after-sales market since independent repairers are not given the same possibilities to enter into competition. Furthermore, the term is unfair to the consumers since an <b>independent</b> <b>repairer</b> by <b>means</b> of regulation nr 1400 / 2002 has the same possibilities and rights to acquire with an authorised repairer equivalent knowledge of how to service a car. Owing to this, the service must be regarded as being of the same quality if performed by an <b>independent</b> <b>repairer...</b>|$|R

40|$|The <b>independent</b> <b>repair</b> of {{mismatched}} nucleotides {{present in}} heteroduplex DNA {{has been used}} to explain gene conversion and map expansion after general genetic recombination. We have constructed and purified heteroduplex plasmid DNAs that contain heteroallelic 10 -base-pair insertion-deletion mismatches. These DNA substrates are similar in structure to the heteroduplex DNA intermediates that have been proposed to be produced during the genetic recombination of plasmids. These DNA substrates were transformed into wild-type and mutant Escherichia coli strains, and the fate of the heteroduplex DNA was determined by both restriction mapping and genetic tests. <b>Independent</b> <b>repair</b> events that yielded a wild-type Tetr gene were observed at a frequency of approximately 1 % in both wild-type and recB recC sbcB mutant E. coli strains.

40|$|We tested {{four types}} of {{surgical}} repair for load to failure and distraction in a bovine model of Achilles tendon repair. A total of 20 fresh bovine Achilles tendons were divided transversely 4 cm proximal to the calcaneal insertion and randomly repaired using the Dresden technique, a Krackow suture, a triple-strand Dresden technique or a modified oblique Dresden technique, all using a Fiberwire suture. Each tendon was loaded to failure. The force applied when a 5 mm gap was formed, peak load to failure, and mechanism of failure were recorded. The resistance to distraction was significantly greater for the triple technique (mean 246. 1 N (205 to 309) to initial gapping) than for the Dresden (mean 180 N (152 to 208); p = 0. 012) and the Krackow <b>repairs</b> (<b>mean</b> 101 N (78 to 112; p < 0. 001). Peak load to failure was significantly greater for the triple-strand <b>repair</b> (<b>mean</b> 675 N (453 to 749)) than for the Dresden (mean 327. 8 N (238 to 406); p < 0. 001), Krackow (mean 223. 6 N (210 to 252); p < 0. 001) and oblique <b>repairs</b> (<b>mean</b> 437. 2 N (372 to 526); p < 0. 001). Failure of the tendon was the mechanism of failure for all specimens except for the tendons sutured using the Krackow technique, where the failure occurred at the knot.

5000|$|There is {{a subtle}} {{distinction}} between 'repair' and 'regeneration'. <b>Repair</b> <b>means</b> incomplete regeneration. <b>Repair</b> or incomplete regeneration, refers to the physiologic adaptation of an organ after injury {{in an effort to}} re-establish continuity without regards to exact replacement of lost/damaged tissue. True tissue regeneration or complete regeneration, refers to the replacement of lost/damaged tissue with an ‘exact’ copy, such that both morphology and functionality are completely restored. [...] Though after injury mammals can completely regenerate spontaneously, they usually do not completely regenerate. An example of a tissue regenerating completely after an interruption of morphology is the endometrium; the endometrium after the process of breakdown via the menstruation cycle heals with complete regeneration.|$|R
40|$|OBJECTIVE: Optimal {{timing of}} palatal repair is still subject of discussion. Although {{literature}} provides {{some evidence that}} palatal closure prior to 6 months positively influence speech outcome in children with clefts, only few studies verified this hypothesis. The {{purpose of this study}} was to describe and compare articulation and resonance characteristics following early (≤ 6 months) and later (> 6 months) palatal repair, performed using the Sommerlad technique. METHODS: Comparison was made between 12 Ugandan children with isolated cleft (lip and) palate following early palatal <b>repair</b> (<b>mean</b> age: 3. 3 m) and 12 Belgian patients with later palatal <b>repair</b> (<b>mean</b> age: 11. 1 m), matched for cleft type, age and gender. A Ugandan and Belgian age- and gender-matched control group without clefts was included to control for language, culture and other environmental factors. Articulation assessments consisted of consonant inventories and phonetic and phonological analyses that were based on consensus transcriptions. In addition, resonance was evaluated by perceptual consensus ratings and objective mean nasalance values. RESULTS: The Belgian and Ugandan control groups were comparable for the majority of the variables. Comparison of cleft palate groups revealed no clinically relevant significant group differences for consonant inventory or phonological processes. Phonetic analysis showed significantly more distortions in the Belgian cleft palate group due to higher occurrence frequencies for (inter) dental productions of apico-alveolar consonants. Neither perceptual consensus ratings of hypernasality, hyponasality, cul-de-sac resonance and nasal emission/turbulence, nor objective mean nasalance values for oral speech samples revealed significant group differences (p> 0. 05). CONCLUSION: Articulation and resonance characteristics of young children following palatal repair before and after 6 months of age seem to be at least comparable...|$|R
