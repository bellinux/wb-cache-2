Hence the present research paper aims at controlling the process parameters to minimize the drill tool wear, during the machining of Glass Fiber Reinforced Polymer (GFRP) composites. Experiments were carried out to find the tool wear rate and a wear mechanism map of uncoated High Speed Steel (HSS) drill of 10 [*]mm diameter was developed for the drilling of GFRP composite laminates. The surface micrograph images on the drill land surface displayed dominant wear mechanisms induced on HSS drill during machining of GFRP and they {{were found to be}} adhesive wear, adhesive and abrasive wear, abrasive wear, and diffusion and fatigue wear. A “safety wear zone” was identified on the wear mechanism map, where the minimum tool wear of the HSS drill occurs. From the safety zone boundaries, it was inferred that the <b>drill</b> <b>spindle</b> speed should be set between 1200 and 1590 [*]rpm and feed rate must be set within a range of 0. 10 – 0. 16 [*]mm/rev for GFRP work and HSS tool combination to enhance the service life of 10 [*]mm HSS drills and to minimize the tool wear...|$|E
40|$|A {{drill bit}} loader is {{described}} for loading a tapered shank of a drill bit into a similarly tapered recess {{in the end}} of a <b>drill</b> <b>spindle.</b> The spindle has a transverse slot at the inner end of the recess. The end of the tapered shank of the drill bit has a transverse tang adapted to engage in the slot so that the drill bit will be rotated by the spindle. The loader {{is in the form of}} a cylinder adapted to receive the drill bit with the shank projecting out of the outer end of the cylinder. Retainer pins prevent rotation of the drill bit in the cylinder. The spindle is lowered to extend the shank of the drill bit into the recess in the spindle and the spindle is rotated to align the slot in the spindle with the tang on the shank. A spring unit in the cylinder is compressed by the drill bit during its entry into the recess of the spindle and resiliently drives the tang into the slot in the spindle when the tang and slot are aligned. In typical remote drilling operations, whether in hot cells or water pits, drill bits have been held using a collet or end mill type holder with set screws. In either case, to load or change a drill bit required the use master-slave manipulators to position the bits and tighten the collet or set screws. This requirement eliminated many otherwise useful work areas because they were not equipped with slaves, particularly in water pits...|$|E
40|$|High speed {{machining}} using vertical CNC milling centres {{continues to}} be a popular approach in a variety of industries including aerospace,automobile,mould and die casting etc. Chatter oscillations have significant influence in restricting the metal removal rates of the machining process. The cutting process instability or chatter is assessed by prediction of frequency response at the tool tip. Present work aims at evaluating the combined effect of a spindle-housing and tool holder on the dynamics of cutting tool by considering the flexibility of spindle unit supported on bearings. The spindle-tool is analysed by using finite element modeling using Timoshenko beam theory. The dynamic characteristics and tool-tip frequency responses are obtained without considering the cutting forces. The results are compared with receptance coupling approach and using 3 D modeling in ANSYS. Further experimental modal analysis on the machining spindle of same dimensions has revealed the same dynamic modes. Using the validated FE model of the system,the effects of nonlinear bearing contact forces,spindle-tool holder interface stiffness,bearing span and axial preload, tool overhang and diameter on the frequency response and cutting process stability are studied. Optimal spindle-tool system is designed for achieving maximum dynamic stiffness. The analytically stability lobe diagrams are obtained from the real and imaginary terms of these frequency responses at the tool tip. Dynamic stability issues in helical end-milling using the two and three dimensional cutting force models are considered for the analysis. The stability boundaries are experimentally verified using the cutting tests on both CNC milling spindle and modified drilling tool spindle systems while machining Al-alloy work pieces. Vibration and sound pressure levels are also employed to assure the stability of cutting operations,while surface images are used to identify the chatter marks at various combinations of cutting parameters. Dynamic milling model is employed with the flexible spindle-tool system by considering several effects including variable tool pitch, tool run-out,nonlinear feed forces and process damping. Design and stability studies on the modified <b>drill</b> <b>spindle</b> with a custom-designed work table for milling operations allowed in understanding several interesting facts about spindle-tool systems.

40|$|In {{the last}} few decades there has been a large {{increase}} in industrial robots used in the machining industry. Industrial robots replaces manual labor in tedious tasks, and increases the level of precision of the process. There are however tasks that are still done by hand or by the use of CNC machines, where the use of industrial robots is limited. One case where the use of industrial robots is limited is in grinding, deburring and drilling of dense metals where a low level of error in the position is required. In these types of operations it is necessary to experiment with force control to discover behaviours that can be compensated, increasing the level of precision when using industrial robots. The work done in this thesis consists mainly of three different types of experiments, where force control is the main aspect in all of them. All experiments follow a linear path along a metal bar, and forces between 1 - 30 N are applied on it using Machining FC for the IRB 4600. At the end effector a wheel-rod tool is attached, which makes it possible to conduct experiments on the same metal bar without the concern for deformation. The different experiments look at how the behaviour changes when either the velocity or the path is changed. In addition a high precision camera system called the K- 610 Series Optical CMM is used to compare deviation of the end effector position with the robot encoders. Different types of filters for use in post processing of the force signals were also investigated. Conducting force control experiments gave several interesting results regarding the behaviour of the robot during the operation. It was discovered that the impact force increased by large degree when force applied increased. For the first experiment conducted it was discovered a large error offset for force measurements, which was reduced tremendously by experimenting with different approach and withdraw paths of the robot. Investigating the reduction of speed for the robot gave interesting results with how well the force control worked for small forces applied and the reduction of impact force. Oscillations could be seen for all the force measurements produced and reducing the velocity of the robot did little to reduce these oscillations. It was also experimented with a step based velocity method, which proved to be quite dissatisfied. From investigating three different types of filter it was concluded that the Butterworth filter gave the best response in reducing the noise of the measurements. This thesis contributes with result and discussion of the different experiments done in regard to the use of force control. It also provides a thorough review of everything needed to produce additional force control experiments using this setup. In the next step {{it would be interesting to}} experiment with force control when <b>drilling</b> <b>spindle</b> is used, and to create controllers which compensate for undesired behaviour of the robot...|$|R
