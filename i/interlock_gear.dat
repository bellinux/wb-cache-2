5000|$|The last Code-O-Graph was the [...] "Key-O-Matic" [...] unit. Possibly to {{compensate}} for the slippage of the 1948 unit's elements, the cipher alphabet and number scales were placed on <b>interlocking</b> <b>gears,</b> preventing any slippage. Resetting the cipher elements utilized a small key that was inserted into slots over one of the gears, which could be disengaged, using the key and a leaf spring as a simple clutch mechanism.|$|R
5000|$|Further {{developments}} have included a [...] "gear balance" [...] {{in which the}} parallelogram is replaced by any odd number of <b>interlocking</b> <b>gears</b> greater than one, with alternating gears {{of the same size}} and with the central gear fixed to a stand and the outside gears fixed to pans, as well as the [...] "sprocket gear balance" [...] consisting of a bicycle-type chain looped around an odd number of sprockets with the central one fixed and the outermost two free to pivot and attached to a pan.|$|R
50|$|Tenders {{were called}} in September 1897 for the {{construction}} of a residence for a station master for Archer Park. Thomas McWatters won the contract for £520, and the building was completed in sixteen weeks. In July 1898 tenders were called for the erection of a signal cabin at Archer Park, and one tender was received from Watson and McDonald for £168. The system of interlocking signalling and pointworks led to discussions between HC Stanley and Traffic Manager Thallon in 1898. Thallon had suggested to deviate the mainline so as to enter Archer Park railway station, to avoid running <b>interlocking</b> <b>gear</b> and signal wires along Denison Street. However the original plan to enable trains to run along Denison Street without entering Archer Park was retained.|$|R
2500|$|The {{reverse of}} the regular-issue coin, {{designed}} by Bruce Rushin, bears a concentric design symbolically representing technological development from the Iron Age, through the Industrial Revolution and the Electronic Age to the Internet, with the inscription TWO POUNDS above {{the design and}} the date below. An oddity of the design is that it depicts nineteen <b>interlocking</b> <b>gears.</b> Because there is an odd number of them, the mechanism could not actually turn. The coin has the edge inscription STANDING ON THE SHOULDERS OF GIANTS, a quote taken from a letter by Isaac Newton to Robert Hooke, in which he describes how his work {{was built on the}} knowledge of those that had gone before him. [...] "If I have seen further, it is by standing on the shoulders of giants." [...] (Newton was Warden and later Master of the Royal Mint.) ...|$|R
25|$|The {{mechanism}} was {{operated by}} turning a small hand crank (now lost) which was linked via {{a crown gear}} to the largest gear, the four-spoked gear visible {{on the front of}} fragment A, the gear named b1. This moved the date pointer on the front dial, which would be set to the correct Egyptian calendar day. The year is not selectable, so it is necessary to know the year currently set, or by looking up the cycles indicated by the various calendar cycle indicators on the back in the Babylonian ephemeris tables for the day of the year currently set, since most of the calendar cycles are not synchronous with the year. The crank moves the date pointer about 78 days per full rotation, so hitting a particular day on the dial would be easily possible if the mechanism were in good working condition. The action of turning the hand crank would also cause all <b>interlocked</b> <b>gears</b> within the mechanism to rotate, resulting in the simultaneous calculation of the position of the Sun and Moon, the moon phase, eclipse, and calendar cycles, and perhaps the locations of planets.|$|R
40|$|In the National Archaeological Museum in Athens sit {{the remains}} of a {{remarkable}} machine, 1600 years ahead of its time. The Antikythera Mechanism, found on an ancient Greek shipwreck in 1901 is thought to date from the early second century BC. Early examination of the mechanism gave rise to theories that it was an astronomical computer. Later X-ray images revealed meticulous ancient workmanship not seen for another 1600 years – bronze <b>interlocking</b> <b>gears</b> and inscriptions. Last year X-Tek was asked to use its new 450 kV microtomography system, originally developed to inspect aircraft turbine blades, to do a complete 3 D CT inspection of the mechanism, which revealed details that had lain hidden for over 2000 years. The inspection showed hidden text and symbols that confirmed that the Antikythera Mechanism was a complex astronomical calculator, capable of predicting the position of the Sun, the Moon and possibly the planets to a remarkable accuracy, and could not only predict the date, but also the time that solar and lunar eclipses were to occur.

50|$|The gear {{mechanism}} was previously considered exclusively artificial, but in 2013, {{scientists from the}} University of Cambridge announced their discovery that the juvenile form of a common insect Issus (species Issus coleoptratus), found in many European gardens, has a gear-like mechanism in its hind legs. Each leg has joints that form two 180° helix-shaped strips with 12 fully <b>interlocking</b> spur-type <b>gear</b> teeth, including filleted curves {{at the base of}} each tooth {{to reduce the risk of}} shearing. The joint rotates like mechanical gears and synchronizes Issus's legs when it jumps.|$|R
40|$|This is a {{study of}} novice middle-school {{mathematics}} teachers' attention to mathematics identity guided by three primary goals: (a) to understand how they were conceptualizing mathematics identity, (b) to investigate how they attended to mathematics identity in practice, and (c) to glean {{an understanding of the}} forces that they saw as influential in attending to mathematics identity. I explored how these teachers conceptualized mathematics identity and attended to it across four dimensions: ability, importance, motivation, and the nature of mathematical tasks. I used a metaphor of <b>interlocking</b> <b>gears</b> to represent how these four dimensions were interrelated. While each practicing novice teacher (PNT) conceptualized mathematics identity differently, they all viewed it through an ability lens, meaning their attention to mathematics identity was predicated upon how they positioned students as mathematically competent or incompetent. I used qualitative methods to highlight the perspectives and practices of three PNTs novice teachers who participated in an alternative certification program that prepared teachers to teach in a district with a long, documented history of low student achievement. I used Engeström's (1987, 1999, 2001) activity theory to explore how the elements of the teachers' activity systems promoted or impeded their attention to mathematics identity. I highlighted salient themes across all PNTs in a cross-case analysis. The teachers in the study attended to mathematics identity in various ways. I categorized these tools in three ways: (a) attention to mathematics identity via instruction, (b) attention to mathematics identity via planning, and (c) an emergent sociopolitical stance. I used the cases to provide illustrative examples of what attending to mathematics identity in each category looked like in practice. Across all of the PNTs, the rules at multiple levels (classroom, school, and district) that governed their activity systems were similar in nature. Their test-driven (Valli, Croninger, Chambliss, Graeber, & Buese, 2008) contexts shaped instructional decisions. At the classroom level, classroom management also proved to be a force that either supported or impeded the PNTs' attention to mathematics identity in practice. With the findings and analysis in mind, I present implications for teacher education, data collection, and theoretical considerations...|$|R
40|$|Two {{observational}} {{studies were}} conducted to examine driver foot pedal operation characteristics which may influence pedal activation errors. Driver behaviors were observed during controlled closed-course and natural driving situations to document individual pedal operating characteristics. A {{substantial portion of the}} drivers in both studies shifted from park to forward and/or reverse gears without positioning a foot over or on the brake pedal. A small percentage of drivers used both feet for pedal activation. The results of these studies suggest that pedal design and layout should take these behaviors into consideration. Either method would likely be less accurate and potentially more hazardous than when the right foot is directly over the brake pedal, and suggests the efficacy of a mechanical <b>interlock</b> to prevent <b>gear</b> selection from park to either forward or reverse gears until contact with the brake pedal is made...|$|R
5000|$|The {{rhythms of}} Coleman's {{music of the}} 1990s were {{described}} in the literature as [...] "circular and highly complex polymetric patterns which preserve their danceable character of popular funk rhythms despite their internal complexity and asymmetries. … On the scale of things, {{this is a very}} intelligent … music, a music which is hipper than any other music has been in a long time, a music which processes manifold stylistically experiences without abandoning its African American identity." [...] These rhythms are generated by overlapping rhythmic(-tonal) cycles of various, often [...] "odd" [...] (5, 7, 9 ...beats) lengths <b>interlocking</b> like <b>gear</b> wheels in a very complex way. The cycles are so long and their interaction is so complex that they appear unpredictable nevertheless well organized and grooving to the listener. In order to communicate freely and expressively within these textures, the musicians must be able to hear these contrasting rhythms simultaneously and that is challenging. But the multilayered rhythmic-tonal textures heighten the possibilities for improvised interactivity and their [...] "odd" [...] character is effective {{in the sense of the}} following statement of drummer Elvin Jones: [...] "Some parts of Latin music are very rigid, as are some aspects of African rhythms. The flexibility comes from the number of people that are playing the rhythm. It is not always synchronized, so that gives it a certain movement that makes it more fluid. When I applied it, I opted for the fluidity rather than the static portion of the rhythms." [...] Steve Coleman's overlapping cycles of various, often [...] "odd" [...] lengths provide a very fluid (multilayered) basis for improvisation.|$|R
