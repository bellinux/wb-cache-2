5|$|In this episode, Millennium <b>Group</b> <b>member</b> Lara Means (Cloke) teams up with Catherine Black (Megan Gallagher), {{the wife}} of a fellow <b>Group</b> <b>member,</b> to {{investigate}} the possibility that a schoolgirl experiencing visions may be biologically descended from Jesus Christ.|$|E
5|$|Black {{speaks to}} fellow <b>Group</b> <b>member</b> Peter Watts (Terry O'Quinn) about his Butler vision. Watts informs Black that a <b>Group</b> <b>member,</b> Olson, has been tasked with {{monitoring}} Butler since her release. Watts and Black travel to Butler's {{last known address}} and find Olson's long-dead body. They realize Butler had been filing her own surveillance reports in Olson's name. Meanwhile, Bryce attempts to escape, but is subdued and later comforted by Lucy Butler. Black interviews Roe, suspecting her involvement when she continually refers to Bryce in the past tense. He later discovers that in every school she has worked for, students have been kidnapped; all the victims resembled Bryce in being average students who showed signs of promise.|$|E
5|$|Forensic {{profiler}} Frank Black (Lance Henriksen), {{a member}} of the private investigative organisation Millennium Group, joins a fellow <b>Group</b> <b>member</b> to track a killer driven by sexual neuroses and who uses mood-altering drugs to gain control of his victims.|$|E
50|$|<b>Group</b> <b>members</b> tend to {{experience}} similar moods based on several theoretical mechanisms, including {{the selection and}} composition of <b>group</b> <b>members,</b> the socialization of <b>group</b> <b>members,</b> and exposure of <b>group</b> <b>members</b> to the same affective events, such as task demands and outcomes.|$|R
5000|$|Revisability: <b>Group</b> <b>members</b> can {{review their}} own {{messages}} before imparting information to their fellow <b>group</b> <b>members.</b> Using technology like email or instant messaging, <b>group</b> <b>members</b> can revise {{information to make}} it more clear before sending it to their fellow <b>group</b> <b>members.</b>|$|R
5000|$|The mood of {{individual}} <b>group</b> <b>members.</b> <b>Group</b> <b>members</b> with leaders {{in a positive}} mood experience more positive mood than do <b>group</b> <b>members</b> with leaders in a negative mood. The leaders transmit their moods to other <b>group</b> <b>members</b> through the mechanism of emotional contagion. Mood contagion {{may be one of}} the psychological mechanisms by which charismatic leaders influence followers.|$|R
5|$|In the episode, Millennium Group {{profiler}} Frank Black (Lance Henriksen) {{travels to}} Arkansas to investigate allegations {{of child abuse}} in the community, meeting fellow <b>Group</b> <b>member</b> Lara Means (Cloke). They soon discover that the abuse may actually {{be the work of}} another child.|$|E
5|$|In this episode, Millennium Group {{profiler}} Frank Black (Lance Henriksen) must {{track down}} {{the man who has}} kidnapped his wife Catherine (Megan Gallagher). During his hunt, <b>Group</b> <b>member</b> Peter Watts (Terry O'Quinn) reveals that the Group is much more secretive and mysterious than Black had ever known.|$|E
5|$|Later, fellow <b>Group</b> <b>member</b> Peter Watts (Terry O'Quinn) tells Black {{that he has}} {{uncovered}} computer files from the Group, indicating that a virus discovered by bio-weapons scientists in the Soviet Union has been living dormant in bird species {{since the end of}} the Cold War, and may now be making a resurgence in the United States. Watts reveals that a vaccine has been developed by the Group, but only in sufficient quantities for its members; Watts and Black have already been inoculated without having realized at the time. Black tells Watts to locate Lara Means (Kristen Cloke), another <b>Group</b> <b>member,</b> as he hopes to keep them safe in the cabin until the crisis resolves.|$|E
50|$|Consult (Individually): The leader {{approaches}} <b>group</b> <b>members</b> {{individually and}} presents {{them with the}} problem. The leader records the <b>group</b> <b>member’s</b> suggestions and makes a decision, deciding {{whether or not to}} use the information provided by <b>group</b> <b>members.</b>|$|R
5000|$|Conflict. Once <b>group</b> <b>members</b> become {{familiar}} with each other, disputes, little fights and arguments occur. <b>Group</b> <b>members</b> eventually work it out.|$|R
40|$|A {{statistical}} analysis of five group catalogs shows that the B(0) magnitudes of first-ranked <b>group</b> <b>members</b> are consistent with a statistical model in which the luminosities of all <b>group</b> <b>members</b> are drawn from the same distribution. As in the Hickson compact groups, indications are that first-ranked <b>group</b> <b>members</b> are only rarely the products of distinctive evolutionary processes. Distance-dependent selection effects can introduce spurious correlations among group parameters which may appear to support environment-dependent evolution of the first-ranked <b>group</b> <b>members...</b>|$|R
5|$|Meanwhile, Millennium <b>Group</b> <b>member</b> Peter Watts (Terry O'Quinn) {{tries to}} {{convince}} fellow <b>Group</b> <b>member</b> Frank Black (Lance Henriksen) {{to investigate the}} case. Black is experiencing a separation from {{his wife and daughter}} after killing his wife's kidnapper; he initially refuses the case but Watts' insistence sways him. Black arrives in the isolated town of Bucksnort, and visits a local diner. Standing out amongst the residents is Michael Beebe (Randy Stone), who has moved there from Los Angeles. Beebe believes his elderly neighbour may be responsible for the attack and asks Black to investigate.|$|E
5|$|Twelve years later, Millennium <b>Group</b> <b>member</b> Frank Black (Lance Henriksen) is {{visited by}} a retired Federal Bureau of Investigation agent, Richard Gilbert (Glenn Morshower). Gilbert hopes to headhunt Black {{for his new}} private {{security}} firm, The Trust. Their meeting abruptly ends when Black receives word that his father has died. At the funeral, Black explains the notion of death to his young daughter; later that day, he unsuccessfully tries to contact fellow <b>Group</b> <b>member</b> Lara Means (Kristen Cloke), {{with whom he has}} lost contact.|$|E
5|$|A {{few days}} before fellow <b>Group</b> <b>member</b> Peter Watts (Terry O'Quinn) investigates a murder in a {{suburban}} home, in which occult paraphernalia has been {{laid out in a}} disorganized manner. Watts contacts Black for help with the case. However, Black is still recovering from the murder of his friend Bob Bletcher (Bill Smitrovich), who was murdered in Black's home. Watts hangs up when he sees Sammael looking through the house's window, {{but by the time he}} can investigate, Sammael is gone.|$|E

40|$|Extending {{the growing}} {{interest}} {{in the relationship between}} affect and workgroup processes, we propose that groups make better use of their distributed information and therefore make better decisions when <b>group</b> <b>members</b> are higher in negative affectivity. In an experiment, we studied the influence of negative affectivity when information was distributed among <b>group</b> <b>members</b> and when <b>group</b> <b>members</b> had fully shared information. Results indicated that negative affectivity indeed stimulates group information processing and decision quality when information is distributed among <b>group</b> <b>members.</b> © 2009 British Academy of Management...|$|R
5|$|Fellow Millennium <b>Group</b> <b>member</b> Peter Watts (Terry O'Quinn) informs Black that, {{before his}} escape, Fabricant {{had married a}} {{correspondent}} he met through a prison pen-pal service. Watts and Black interview the woman, Lucy Butler (Sarah-Jane Redmond), at her home. Butler is adamant she has not seen or heard from Fabricant since his escape. However, Black finds information on Butler's computer which he believes is linked to his own home address; and photographs of a judge who he recognizes as having been murdered.|$|E
5|$|In Black's home in Seattle, {{his wife}} Catherine (Megan Gallagher) confides in {{policeman}} Bob Bletcher (Bill Smitrovich) her worry about Black's overprotective nature, fearing he may {{quit his job}} if he believes his family to be in danger. Catherine does not yet know that a stalker from their past has resurfaced and has been posting polaroids of the family to Black. Black has meanwhile been persuaded by his fellow <b>Group</b> <b>member</b> Mike Atkins (Robin Gammell) that his family is in no immediate risk.|$|E
5|$|In this episode, Federal Bureau of Investigation agents Frank Black (Lance Henriksen) and Emma Hollis (Klea Scott) {{investigate}} {{the kidnapping of}} the daughter of Millennium <b>Group</b> <b>member</b> Peter Watts (Terry O'Quinn), which may {{be connected to the}} testing of a pathogen during the Gulf War. The episode was well-received critically, with the guest acting seen as particularly strong, and was viewed by approximately 5.6 million households during its initial broadcast.|$|E
50|$|Lastly, {{the nature}} of the {{discussion}} between <b>group</b> <b>members</b> reflects whether biases for shared information will surface. According to Wittenbaum et al., 2004), members are motivated to establish and maintain reputations, to secure tighter bonds, and to compete for success against other <b>group</b> <b>members.</b> As a result, individuals tend to be selective when disclosing information to other <b>group</b> <b>members.</b>|$|R
40|$|Previous {{research}} indicates <b>group</b> <b>members</b> have a highly variable pattern of {{internal and external}} attributions for their performance. The authors propose that part of this variability {{may be explained by}} <b>group</b> <b>members</b> making their attributions from the perspective of both the actor and the observer. Following a pooled-performance task, <b>group</b> <b>members</b> reported inflated internal and external attributions for factors responsible for their performance as compared with attributions individuals made for their own performance. Similarly, <b>group</b> <b>members</b> reported an inflated internal and external attribution pattern of factors responsible for a similar group’s performance compared to attributions individ-uals made for the performance of a similar other. The results demonstrate that unique processes occur in the attributions of <b>group</b> <b>members</b> compared to the attributions of individuals for their performance...|$|R

5|$|Meanwhile, Lara Means (Kristen Cloke), another <b>Group</b> <b>member,</b> sees {{a vision}} of an angel. She begins researching her visions, and is scouted by a Mr. Johnston, who asks her {{to work with the}} Owl faction. Meanwhile, Catherine's husband Frank Black (Lance Henriksen) returns home to find Watts in the house. Watts {{explains}} that Black's modem has been bugged; the two argue heatedly and Black declares he is done with the Group.|$|E
5|$|Millennium <b>Group</b> <b>member</b> Frank Black (Lance Henriksen) is {{contacted}} {{for help}} in finding Zero, and travels to a briefing on the situation. It is explained that Zero is carrying a disease ordinarily confined to the Congo. Meanwhile, Zero and Knox are attempting to have a local newspaper run Zero's story, believing he has been infected in a racially motivated conspiracy akin to the Tuskegee syphilis experiment. Police locate and apprehend Zero, who manages to smear blood on Black's shirt.|$|E
5|$|Millennium <b>Group</b> <b>member</b> Frank Black (Lance Henriksen) joins {{his brother}} Tom (Philip Anglim) and {{sister-in-law}} Helen (Liz Bryson) for their newborn son's christening. After {{the child is}} baptized, Black joins his daughter Jordan (Brittany Tiplady), finding her in hysterics. She claims to have seen a man hurting Helen; when Black and his brother rush outside, they find {{the baby in the}} back of Tom's car, but Helen is gone.|$|E
40|$|Egalitarianism {{is highly}} valued in Canada and yet some groups are profoundly disadvantaged. This can be {{explained}} by sociological and psychological theorizing that claims advantaged <b>group</b> <b>members</b> are motivated to maintain a system of inequality from which they benefit. The challenge is to explain the few advantaged <b>group</b> <b>members</b> who defy self-interest and support disadvantaged groups. My research objectives were to understand what motivates selected advantaged <b>group</b> <b>members</b> to support disadvantaged groups, and to understand how the majority of advantaged <b>group</b> <b>members</b> maintain their belief in egalitarianism in the face of clear social inequality. Results revealed that most advantaged <b>group</b> <b>members</b> value egalitarianism highly, but only those who define egalitarianism in terms of social responsibility unequivocally support the interests of disadvantaged groups. Most advantaged <b>group</b> <b>members</b> conceive egalitarianism in terms of equality of opportunity, rights or treatment, allowing them to legitimize inequality; consequently, they are less willing to sympathize with the demands for fair treatment by disadvantaged group...|$|R
50|$|The size of {{the group}} affects the {{salience}} of group-identities. Minority groups are more distinctive, so group identity should be more salient among minority <b>group</b> <b>members</b> than majority <b>group</b> <b>members.</b>|$|R
40|$|<b>Groups</b> {{often have}} <b>members</b> who hold {{opposing}} opinions on specific issues. The presence of undecided people within a group may promote cooperation among <b>group</b> <b>members</b> who hold opposing views {{on an issue}} under consideration. The study examined the joint effects of group attitude diversity (i. e. mixed attitude diversity vs. polarized attitude diversity) and one’s strength of attitude on the cooperation. In groups considering a controversial issue with no undecided <b>group</b> <b>members</b> (i. e. polarized attitude diversity), people with strong attitudes were less likely than those with weak attitudes to cooperate with <b>group</b> <b>members</b> who held opposing views. However, the above differences became non-significant when participants were placed in groups with some undecided <b>group</b> <b>members</b> (i. e. mixed attitude diversity). The results from the study suggested {{that the presence of}} undecided <b>group</b> <b>members</b> mitigates the negative impact of attitude strength on subsequent cooperation...|$|R
5|$|Millennium <b>Group</b> <b>member</b> Frank Black (Lance Henriksen) {{travels to}} Springdale, Arkansas to {{investigate}} allegations {{of child abuse}} brought against a daycare owner, Penny Plott (Mary Gillis). Before he leaves Seattle, he takes his daughter Jordan (Brittany Tiplady) shopping for shoes, but chastises her when she begins acting out for attention.|$|E
5|$|Millennium <b>Group</b> <b>member</b> Peter Watts (Terry O'Quinn) meets {{several other}} Group members {{to discuss the}} {{competing}} factions within the Group—the Roosters believe that the coming millennium will trigger a theological apocalypse, while the Owls believe {{the end of the}} world will be a secular, material disaster. The discovery and theft of the True Cross threatens to tip the internecine conflict in the favor of the Owls, leaving them in control of the Group; the assembled members are Roosters and wish to stop this.|$|E
5|$|Stymied, Black {{and fellow}} <b>Group</b> <b>member</b> Lara Means (Kristen Cloke) {{investigate}} the ship, finding several bodies {{hidden in a}} crate, all having died of exposure. Black then interviews Law and his crew individually, each time being given a contradicting {{story of how the}} woman came to be on board the ship. However, they all agree that after she boarded, crew were discovered daily, dead of exposure on the ship's bow; Law had the woman chained up in the belief she was responsible.|$|E
50|$|Positive {{interdependence}} exists when <b>group</b> <b>members</b> {{perceive that}} they are linked {{with each other in}} such a way that one cannot succeed unless everyone succeeds. <b>Group</b> <b>members</b> realize, therefore, that each person's efforts benefit not only him- or herself, but all other <b>group</b> <b>members</b> as well. Positive interdependence creates a commitment to other people's success as well as one's own and is the basis of cooperative learning.|$|R
5000|$|Decide : The {{leader of}} the group uses other <b>group</b> <b>members</b> as sources of information, but makes the final {{decision}} independently and does not explain to <b>group</b> <b>members</b> why s/he required that information.|$|R
5000|$|... time pressures: <b>group</b> <b>members</b> {{are more}} {{concerned}} with efficiency and quick results, instead of quality and accuracy. Additionally, time pressures can lead to <b>group</b> <b>members</b> overlooking important information regarding the issue of discussion.|$|R
