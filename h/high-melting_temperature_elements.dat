40|$|The {{synthesis}} of a <b>high-melting</b> <b>temperature</b> semiconductor in a low-temperature fiber drawing process is demonstrated, substantially expanding {{the set of}} materials that {{can be incorporated into}} fibers. Reagents in the solid state are arranged in proximate domains within a fiber preform. The preform is fluidized at elevated temperatures and drawn into fiber, reducing the lateral dimensions and bringing the domains into intimate contact to enable chemical reaction. A polymer preform containing a thin layer of selenium contacted by tin–zinc wires is drawn to yield electrically contacted crystalline ZnSe domains of sub- 100 -nm scales. The in situ synthesized compound semiconductor becomes the basis for an electronic heterostructure diode of arbitrary length in the fiber. The ability to synthesize materials within fibers while precisely controlling their geometry and electrical connectivity at submicron scales presents new opportunities for increasing the complexity and functionality of fiber structures.

40|$|AbstractPhase {{diagrams}} of 3 -component {{lipid bilayer}} mixtures containing cholesterol reveal major {{differences among the}} different types of lipids. Here we report that mixtures of cholesterol together with POPC and a <b>high-melting</b> <b>temperature</b> PC or sphingomyelin show different phase behavior from similar mixtures that contain DOPC or di-phytanoyl-PC instead of POPC. In particular, only one region of macroscopic phase coexistence occurs with POPC, a region of coexisting liquid disordered and solid phases, {Lα+Lβ}. Fluorescence microscopy imaging is useful for these studies, but is subject to artifactual light-induced domain formation, as reported by Ayuyan and Cohen [A. G. Ayuyan, F. S. Cohen, Lipid peroxides promote large rafts: Effects of excitation of probes in fluorescence microscopy and electrochemical reactions during vesicle formation, Biophys. J. 91 (2006) 2172 - 2183. ]. This artifact can be attenuated by decreased illumination and low dye concentration. The use of the free radical scavenger n-propyl gallate can reduce the artifact, but this molecule enters the bilayer and itself perturbs the phase behavior. We suggest that the light-induced domain separation artifact might actually arise from pre-existing lipid clusters that are induced to coalesce, and therefore indicates highly nonrandom mixing of the lipid components...|$|R
40|$|The surface air {{temperature}} {{is a significant}} meteorological element in agricultural studies {{and the demand for}} this data has increased. Thus, satisfactory exactness is required, especially over un-sampled areas. Spatial models of surface air <b>temperature</b> <b>elements</b> were developed for the Peninsular Malaysia region. There were eight environmental variables - elevation, locations (latitude and longitude), and five nearest distances of coastline and four land use types (water bodies, forest, agriculture and built-up) - that are significant to surface air <b>temperature</b> <b>elements,</b> evaluated in this study. A multiple regression model was generated to explain the contributions of these environmental factors for each surface air <b>temperature</b> <b>element.</b> The seasonal and regional roles were also considered in the modelling process. Peninsular Malaysia experiences four seasons; namely, northeast monsoon, spring transition, southwest monsoon and autumn transition. The new regionalization of Peninsular Malaysia was delineated using a multi-step approach by integrating in-situ data for the surface air <b>temperature</b> <b>elements</b> and raster data of Geographical Information System (GIS). The developed climate region divided the area into three regions - West Coast, East Coast and the Main Range. In selecting the most appropriate model, which considered environmental, seasonal and regional factors, four categories of models were developed {{for each of the three}} surface air <b>temperature</b> <b>elements.</b> These categories were ‘all clusters and all seasons’, w_c_s (three models), ‘all clusters and each season’, s (12 models), ‘each cluster and all seasons’, c (nine models) and ‘each cluster and each season’, c_s (36 models). In modelling of surface air <b>temperature</b> <b>elements,</b> analysis of spatial interpolation plays a vital role to produce continuous surface of discrete data, in which all un-sampled values of surface air <b>temperature</b> <b>elements</b> are able to be estimated. In implementing integration of multiple regression models and spatial interpolation technique, the monthly data of T-T’ was generated, in which T was surface {{air temperature}} values and T’ was estimated values of the 60 developed models. Interpolation analyses for 70 % of T-T’ monthly data were carried out by applying the Inverse Distance Weighting (IDW) technique, since this technique has been widely used, tested and evaluated. IDW direct interpolation of monthly data for surface air <b>temperature</b> <b>elements</b> was also carried out to examine the effect of environmental factors. Cross validation analysis was conducted by using 30 % of the monthly data to determine the performance of the models. Although the model category for ‘each cluster and each season’ (c_s model category) produced the lowest errors, the model category for ‘each cluster and all seasons’ (c model category) was recommended as the most appropriate model for each of the three surface air <b>temperature</b> <b>elements.</b> The statistical test to determine the differences between two groups, found that there is no significant difference between the performances of both model categories. Furthermore, the selected model category is simple, practical and user friendly. This research discovered that in addition to the environmental factor, the regional factor plays a significant role in estimating the surface air <b>temperature</b> <b>elements</b> of maximum, minimum and mean in Peninsular Malaysia...|$|R
40|$|We {{performed}} a systematic {{investigation of the}} incorporation of 99 Tc into pyrochlore oxide structures, Ln 2 Tc 2 O 7, where Ln represents trivalent lanthanide Ln 3 + cations, while 99 Tc is atetravalent, Tc 4 +, metal cation. Pyrochlore compounds are <b>high-melting</b> <b>temperature</b> oxides and are recognized for their durability. Our goal in this preliminary study is to characterize and quantify the range of stability of the lanthanum technetium pyrochlore oxide phase. Hereby, powder X-ray diffraction (XRD) and Rietveld analysis {{were used to determine}} and characterize the crystalline phase content with high accuracy, and scanning electron microscopy (SEM) was used to characterize the microstructure and homogeneity of the synthesized Ln-Tc pyrochlore specimens. The pyrochlore phases exhibited good crystallinity and the lattice parameters of the F d 3 m phases could be refined with remarkable accuracies, and low refinement residuals (RBragg) of 1. 1 % to 3. 1 % for the pyrochlore phases were achieved. The refined lattice parameter are ranging from 10. 447156 (83) Å for Pr 2 Tc 2 O 7 to 10. 13777 (22) Å for Lu 2 Tc 2 O 7.

40|$|<b>High-melting</b> <b>temperature</b> oxides, {{carbides}} and nitrides {{are superior}} in hardness and strength to metals, especially in severe conditions. However, the {{extensive use of}} such ceramics in structural engineering applications often encountered critical problems due to their lack of damage tolerance and to the limited mechanical reliability. Several ceramic composites and, in particular, laminated structures have been developed {{in recent years to}} enhance strength, toughness and to improve flaw tolerance. Significant strength increase and improved mechanical reliability, in terms of Weibull modulus or minimum threshold failure stress, can be achieved by the engineering of the critical surface region in the ceramic component. Such effect can be realized by using a laminated composite structure with tailored sub-surface insertion of layers with different composition. Such laminate is able to develop, upon co-sintering, a spatial variation of residual stress with maximum compression at specific depth from the surface due to the differences in thermal expansion coefficient of the constituting layers. In the present work silicon carbide has been selected as second phase to graduate the thermal expansion coefficient of alumina due to its relatively low specific density that could allow the production of lighter components with improved mechanical performance, also for high temperature applications. Ceramic laminates with strong interfaces composed of Al 2 O 3 /SiC composite layers were produced by pressureless sintering or Spark Plasma Sintering (SPS) of green layers stacks prepared by tape casting water-based suspensions.

40|$|As {{the number}} of {{materials}} that are thermally-drawable into fibers is rapidly expending, numerous new multimaterial fiber architectures can be envisioned and fabricated. <b>High-melting</b> <b>temperature</b> metals, compound materials, composite, conductive or ferroelectric polymers: the broad diversity of these materials' nature and properties, combined with various post-fabrication treatments recently developed (poling, annealing, injection, coating, capillary breakup), enable the making of novel in-fiber, stand-alone-fiber and fiber-array devices. In this thesis, we demonstrate {{a wide variety of}} novel multimaterial fiber capabilities at all these levels, focusing specifically on new electronic functions. First, the implementation of conductive polymer as in-fiber current buses is shown to enable distributed light sensing and modulation along a single fiber, by inducing transmission-line effects in d. c. and a. c. operation. Next, the design and operation of a photosensing fiber specially treated to detect explosives is presented, and the sensitivity of this fiber device is shown to meet state-of-the-art industry standards. A novel large-interface-area design for dielectric fibers is then presented, which enables both energy storage in flexible fiber capacitors as well as enhanced acoustic transduction in piezoelectric fibers. The flexibility as well as the assembly into arrays of the latter are shown to enable the shaping of a pressure field in all three dimensions of space. Finally, a novel thermal-gradient capillary breakup process for silica-based fibers is shown, enabling the fabrication of silicon-in-silica micro spheres and rectifying devices. Taken as a whole, these new capabilities greatly expand the breadth of functionality of multimaterial fibers, further paving the way towards highly multifunctional, wholly integrated electronic fiber devices and fabrics that can collect, store and transduce energy in all of its forms. by Guillaume Lestoquoy.
