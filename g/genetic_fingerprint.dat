40|$|<b>Genetic</b> <b>fingerprinting</b> {{is one of}} the DNA-based {{techniques}} that have permeated a wide gamut of biological research, beginning with forensic biology and medicine and now ex-tending to agriculture. The advent of polymerase chain re-action (PCR) ushered a revolutionary approach in producing <b>genetic</b> <b>fingerprints,</b> supplanting hybridization-based techniques. PCR-based methods can be accomplished using either arbitrary markers of un-known location in the genome or those markers that target specific genome sites. Among agricultural crops, rice and maize are the most intensively characterized for DNA markers. At present, genetic finger-printing has also been applied in many aspects of crop biology, such as taxonomy and phylogeny, diversity analysis, hybridity testing, gene mapping, molecular breeding, and somaclonal variation. This paper describes <b>genetic</b> <b>fingerprinting</b> technology and discusses its applica-tions in the major crops of the Philippines, highlighting the progress made by Filipino scientists. Discovery and principle of <b>genetic</b> <b>fingerprinting</b> The past century marked groundbreaking discoveries in the biological sciences particularly in the area of molecular biology. Since the discov-ery of the DNA structure in 1953, researchers have been increasingly empowered to analyze and manipulate genetics using the principles of nucleic acid biochemistry. The beginnings of DNA profiling or <b>genetic</b> <b>fingerprinting</b> can be traced in the work of geneticist Alec J. Jeffreys of the University of Leicester in Great Britain, on the gene for myoglo-bin, a protein that stores oxygen in muscle cells (Jeffreys et al., 1985). He found that the myoglobin gene contains many segments that vary in size and composition from individual to individual and that have no apparent function. Jeffreys called these segments minisatellites be-cause they are small and are located near the gene that actually serves as a genetic blueprint. Minisatellites are tandemly arranged, repetitive DNA elements scattered throughout eukaryote and prokaryote ge-nomes, the short basic units of which are mostly imperfectly reiterated at each locus (Epplen et al., 2005). Minisatellites comprise 10 – 100 nucleotide-long repeat units...|$|R

5000|$|Since actual base-pair {{distances}} {{are generally}} hard or impossible to directly measure, physical maps are actually constructed by first shattering the genome into hierarchically smaller pieces. By characterizing each single piece and assembling back together, the overlapping path or [...] "tiling path" [...] {{of these small}} fragments would allow researchers to infer physical distances between genomic features. The fragmentation of the genome {{can be achieved by}} restriction enzyme cutting or by physically shattering the genome by processes like sonication. Once cut, the DNA fragments are separated by electrophoresis. The resulting pattern of DNA migration (i.e. its <b>genetic</b> <b>fingerprint)</b> is used to identify what stretch of DNA is in the clone. By analyzing the fingerprints, contigs are assembled by automated (FPC) or manual means (pathfinders) into overlapping DNA stretches. Now a good choice of clones can be made to efficiently sequence the clones to determine the DNA sequence of the organism under study.|$|E
5000|$|SNP {{genotyping}} is {{the measurement}} of genetic variations of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) between members of a species. It {{is a form of}} genotyping, which is {{the measurement of}} more general genetic variation. SNPs {{are one of the most}} common types of genetic variation. A SNP is a single base pair mutation at a specific locus, usually consisting of two alleles (where the rare allele frequency is > 1%). SNPs are found to be involved in the etiology of many human diseases and are becoming of particular interest in pharmacogenetics. Because SNPs are conserved during evolution, they have been proposed as markers for use in quantitative trait loci (QTL) analysis and in association studies in place of microsatellites. The use of SNPs is being extended in the HapMap project, which aims to provide the minimal set of SNPs needed to genotype the human genome. SNPs can also provide a <b>genetic</b> <b>fingerprint</b> for use in identity testing. [...] The increase of interest in SNPs has been reflected by the furious development of a diverse range of SNP genotyping methods.|$|E

Methods: We developed a new method to study the electrochemical behavior of dGTP utilizing carbon multiwalled nanotube (MWNT) -modified glassy carbon electrodes (GCEs). RAPD was applied for amplification of DNA samples from healthy controls and patients with pancreatic cancer under the same conditions to determine the different surplus quantity of dGTP in the polymerase chain reaction (PCR), thereby determining the difference/quantity of PCR products or template strands. Using this method we generated a <b>genetic</b> <b>fingerprint</b> map of pancreatic cancer through the combination of electrochemical sensors and gel electrophoresis to screen for genetic alterations. Cloning and sequencing were then performed to verify these gene alterations. Results: dGTP showed favorable electrochemical behavior on the MWNTs/GCE. The {{results indicated that the}} electrical signal and dGTP had a satisfactory linear relationship with the dGTP concentration within the conventional PCR concentration range. The MWNTs/GCE could distinguish between different products of RAPD. This experiment successfully identified a new pancreatic cancer-associated mutant gene fragment, consisting of a cyclin-dependent kinase 4 gene 3 &# 39; terminal mutation.
