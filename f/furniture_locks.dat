2500|$|The {{artisans}} {{and workers}} were {{concentrated in the}} eastern neighborhoods. The faubourg Saint-Antoine included the new glass factory of Reuilly and factories making porcelain, pottery, wallpaper, breweries, and many smaller workshops making <b>furniture,</b> <b>locks,</b> and metalwork. The other major industrial neighborhood was the faubourg Saint-Marcel on the left bank, {{along the banks of}} the Bievre River, where the tanneries and dyeing workshops were located. Many artisans in these neighborhoods had just two rooms; the front room, with a window, served as the workshop, while the entire family lived in the darker back room. The working-class neighborhoods were densely populated; while the Champs-Élysée neighborhoods had 27,5 persons per hectare, in 1801 there were 1500 persons living in a hectare in the Arcis quarter, which included the Place de Grève, Châtelet and Saint-Jacques de la Boucherie, and a density of 1000 to 1500 persons around Les Halles, rue Saint-Denis and rue Saint-Martin. About sixty to seventy percent of the inhabitants of faubourgs Saint-Antoine and Saint-Marcel were born outside of Paris, mostly in the French provinces. Most came from the north, Picardy, Champagne, the Loire Valley, Berri, and Normandy.|$|E
5000|$|The {{action was}} invented by an American, Jacob Snider, and adopted by Britain as a {{conversion}} system for the 1853 Enfield. The conversions proved both more accurate than original muzzle-loading Enfields and much faster firing as well. Converted rifles retained the original iron barrel, <b>furniture,</b> <b>locks</b> and cap-style hammers. The rifles were converted in large numbers, or assembled new with surplus pattern 53 iron barrels and hardware. The Mark III rifles were made from all new parts with steel barrels, flat-nosed hammers and are the version equipped with a latch-locking breech block. The Snider {{was the subject of}} substantial imitation, approved and otherwise, including: Nepalese Sniders, the Dutch Sniders, Danish Naval Sniders, and the [...] "unauthorized" [...] adaptations resulting in the French Tabatiere and Russian Krnka rifles.|$|E

50|$|In trials, the Snider Pattern 1853 {{conversions}} proved {{both more}} accurate than original Pattern 1853s and much faster firing; a trained soldier could fire ten aimed rounds per minute with the breech-loader, compared with only three rounds per minute with the muzzle-loading weapon. From 1866 onwards, the Enfield rifles were converted in large numbers at the Royal Small Arms Factory (RSAF) Enfield beginning with the initial pattern, the Mark I. The converted rifles received a new breechblock/receiver assembly, but retained the original iron barrel, <b>furniture,</b> <b>lock,</b> and hammer.|$|R
5000|$|A chase is a {{heavy steel}} frame used to hold type in a letterpress. Most of the space in the chase not {{occupied}} with type is filled with blocks of wood called furniture. The type and <b>furniture</b> are <b>locked</b> in place by quoins. [...] When a chase is locked up with type, furniture, and quoins, it is called a forme.|$|R
5000|$|The {{composition}} of individual cast metal types into lines with leading and <b>furniture,</b> tightly <b>locked</b> into a chase, was labor-intensive and costly. Cumulative, this full setup for printing a single page {{was called a}} forme. The printer would incur further expense through loss of the type for other uses while held in formes. However, once the flong and stereotype were created, the individual type, furniture, leading and chasing could be disassembled, and used for another project.|$|R
50|$|Initially {{the main}} iron working centers were Puebla and Oaxaca. Oaxacan iron was {{exceptionally}} malleable and light allowing for intricate designs and tools not possible with {{other types of}} iron. Most Oaxacan iron objects date from the 17th and 18th centuries and include <b>locks,</b> <b>furniture</b> and scissors, often with intricate designs etched on them.By the end of the 18th century, there were important iron working centers in Oaxaca, Puebla, Mexico City, Guanajuato and Querétaro, as well as western Mexico such as Guadalajara, Zacatecas and Aguascalientes, which eventually developed its own style. Western Mexican ironwork is distinguished by oriental influence due to trade with Manila as well as the use of iron for decorative purposes on wooden objects.|$|R
50|$|The {{original}} {{planning of}} the house is substantially intact and later additions are clearly articulated. Verandahs on the north and east have been enclosed and the building is entered from a doorway on the north-eastern elevation. Many of the rooms have been lined with hardboard and fibro. Several large, well proportioned rooms with high ceilings have elements of original fabric remaining, these include pressed metal ceilings, leadlight windows, tiled fireplaces and other decorative elements. There are original doors throughout, these are generally four panel doors with Art Nouveau style finger plates and <b>lock</b> <b>furniture.</b> There are a number of styles of windows, including many timber sash windows and a variety of recent styles such as sliding and casement windows.|$|R
5|$|The {{strength}} or durability of heavy metals such as chromium, iron, nickel, copper, zinc, molybdenum, tin, tungsten, and lead, {{as well as}} their alloys, makes them useful for the manufacture of artefacts such as tools, machinery, appliances, utensils, pipes, railroad tracks, buildings and bridges, automobiles, <b>locks,</b> <b>furniture,</b> ships, planes, coinage and jewellery. They are also used as alloying additives for enhancing the properties of other metals. Of the two dozen elements that have been used in the world's monetised coinage only two, carbon and aluminium, are not heavy metals. Gold, silver, and platinum are used in jewellery as are (for example) nickel, copper, indium, and cobalt in coloured gold. Low-cost jewellery and children's toys may be made, to a significant degree, of heavy metals such as chromium, nickel, cadmium, or lead.|$|R
6000|$|... "I was a {{civilian}} and he a sailor," [...] he said, [...] "consequently {{neither of us}} were of any use in drilling Tippoo's battalions, and had been sent up there. Your father was well, then. The governor was a good fellow, and we had nothing much to complain of. Mr. Holland was a favourite of his, for, being a sailor, he was handy at all sorts of things. He could mend a piece of broken <b>furniture,</b> repair the <b>lock</b> of a musket, and make himself generally useful. He left there before I did, as the governor was transferred to some other fort--I never heard where it was--and he took your father with him. I don't know whether he had Tippoo's orders to do so, or whether he took him simply because he liked him.|$|R
