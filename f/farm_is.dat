50|$|Using {{the modern}} road names to {{identify}} the location: Lea House <b>Farm</b> <b>was</b> near Lea House Road; Two Gates <b>Farm</b> <b>was</b> by the junction of Sycamore Road and Willows Road; Barnbrook <b>Farm</b> <b>was</b> by the cross-roads of Linden Road and Bournville Lane; Row Heath <b>Farm</b> <b>was</b> at the junction of Franklin Road and Oak Tree Lane, and Barnbrook Hall Farm later became the recreation ground for female staff at Cadbury’s; Fordhouse <b>Farm</b> <b>was</b> half way up Fordhouse Lane near The Worthings; Bullies <b>Farm</b> <b>was</b> located on Cartland Road, close to the junction with Pineapple Road; Pineapple <b>Farm</b> <b>was</b> {{at the bottom of}} Vicarage Road, just across the railway lines from Hazelwell Hall; Dawberry Farm stood near Dawberry Fields Road and Harton Way.|$|R
50|$|In 1987 about 2.7 million private <b>farms</b> <b>were</b> in operation. About 57 {{percent of}} these were smaller than five hectares. Of the {{remaining}} <b>farms,</b> 25 percent <b>were</b> between five and ten hectares and 11 percent were between ten and fifteen hectares. Only 7 percent of private <b>farms</b> <b>were</b> larger than fifteen hectares. Whereas {{the majority of the}} private <b>farms</b> <b>were</b> below optimum size, the majority of state <b>farms</b> <b>were</b> excessively large. Only 12 percent of the latter <b>farms</b> <b>were</b> below 200 hectares, and 60 percent were larger than 1,000 hectares.|$|R
30|$|From Table  6, {{it may be}} {{observed}} that marginal-small <b>farms</b> <b>are</b> mostly Cluster 3 farms (91.67 %), i.e. smaller farms with higher off-farm income. Medium <b>farms</b> <b>are</b> Cluster 2 (56.52 %) and Cluster 3 (30.43 %) farms i.e. diversified farms and small farms with higher off-farm income. Noticeably, large <b>farms</b> <b>are</b> distributed across all clusters, perhaps due to their higher flexibility in allocation of land resources among different crops/enterprises. Alternatively, Cluster 1 <b>farms</b> <b>are</b> mostly (75.00 %) large farms, Cluster II <b>farms</b> <b>are</b> largely Medium (56.52 %) and Large (41.67 %) farms, Cluster 3 <b>farms</b> <b>are</b> mostly Marginal-small <b>farms</b> (82.86 %) and Cluster 4 <b>farms</b> <b>are</b> Large <b>farms</b> (71.43 %). The distribution of clusters across the farm size differed significantly (Likelihood ratio sig. value[*]=[*]. 00) indicating heterogeneous nature of farm types across farm sizes.|$|R

2500|$|... "Family farm" [...] and [...] "corporate farm" [...] {{are often}} defined as {{mutually}} exclusive terms, {{with the two}} having different interests. This mostly stems from the widespread assumption that family <b>farms</b> <b>are</b> small <b>farms</b> while corporate <b>farms</b> <b>are</b> large-scale operations. While {{it is true that}} the majority of small <b>farms</b> <b>are</b> family owned, many large <b>farms</b> <b>are</b> also family businesses, including some of the largest farms in the US.|$|R
50|$|The Aguçadoura Wave <b>Farm</b> <b>was</b> the world's {{first wave}} <b>farm.</b> It <b>was</b> located 5 km {{offshore}} near Póvoa de Varzim north of Porto in Portugal.

5|$|In the town, Rick and Glenn find Hershel {{alone in}} a tavern, {{drinking}} and lamenting {{the loss of his}} family members. Rick eventually convinces Hershel to return, but as they are about to leave, two men from Philadelphia enter the bar—Dave (Michael Raymond-James) and Tony (Aaron Munoz). They reveal that Rick's goal of Fort Benning may be overridden and try to goad where the group's <b>farm</b> <b>is,</b> looking for safe haven. Rick refuses to disclose the farm's location, and shoots them both before they fire back on him.|$|E
5|$|Induction generators, {{which were}} {{often used for}} wind power {{projects}} in the 1980s and 1990s, require reactive power for excitation so substations used in wind-power collection systems include substantial capacitor banks for power factor correction. Different types of wind turbine generators behave differently during transmission grid disturbances, so extensive modelling of the dynamic electromechanical characteristics of a new wind <b>farm</b> <b>is</b> required by transmission system operators to ensure predictable stable behaviour during system faults. In particular, induction generators cannot support the system voltage during faults, unlike steam or hydro turbine-driven synchronous generators.|$|E
5|$|Manor Farm House is a Grade II listed {{building}} and the farm and its cottages are the main feature in West Worldham. It was owned for some time by the Broce family.

50|$|The Sjønstå <b>farm</b> <b>was</b> royal property, and {{its owners}} were tenants of the state. In 1800 the <b>farm</b> <b>was</b> {{divided into two}} equally sized {{portions}} and sold. The first <b>farm</b> <b>was</b> called Nergård ('lower farm'), and the skipper and landowner Christen Ellingsen from the inner Leivset farm in Fauske obtained the deed in 1801. Neither he nor the subsequent owners ever stayed on the farm, but instead leased it to crofters. This <b>farm</b> <b>was</b> sold to Sulitjelma Mines in 1891. The second <b>farm</b> <b>was</b> called Øvergård ('upper farm'), and it was sold to Sulitjelma Mines {{at the same time}} as Nergård. After the <b>farms</b> had <b>been</b> sold, lease agreements were established with the mining company; farming continued at Nergård until 1956, and the bachelor Andor Karolius Hansen lived at Øvergård until his death in 1973.|$|R
