This {{research}} aims {{to formulate}}  the control guide line  of flood susceptibility  in Banjarbaru, South Kalimantan   Province.  The goal is ac hieved through thest ages of study as follows:   1. Analyzing the characteristics  of Banjarbaru  City consisting of a) {{the use of}} land; b) rain fall; c) physical characteristics  of land (infiltration); and d) on steepness,   2.  Conducting  the zoning level of flood susceptibility  in Banjarbaru  City, and 3. Producing a chart of flood susceptibility for Banjarbaru  City. This research applies descriptive   method that consists of data gathering,  data processing  and data analysis. Determining  the high suspectibility  of flood  is done by weighting  indicators  of flood through  the closing   of land, the rain intensity,  the physical  characteristics   of  land (infiltration),  and the tilt of slope. uper weighting, classification  of flood  susceptibility  is carried out. Thecategory of level is done by multiplying  variable values with the variable weight.    Of <b>fload</b>  susceptibilityis divided  into four  categories: very fragile,,fragile,  somewhat  fragile,  and not fragile. This research results flood  susceptibility  zoning level that aims to identify the areas that are fragile  to flood,  so this region can be analysed to prevent  and handle flood. Based on the result of data collection,data processing  and data analysis, it can be  concluded   that:   1) based  on  the  results   of  the  analysis   toward   the flood susceptibility  variable,  it  can be concluded  that the cause of flood  susceptibility  in Banjarbaru  City is {{the change in the}} landuse because it has great weight beside the topography  of the area. Banjarbaru  City also has the tilt tendency  to beflat (0 - 8 %), so the water from a higher place then will gather in this area. 2) Based on flood susceptibility  zoning level in Banjarbaru  City,it is discovered  that an area of 16, 810 hectares  or 51 % of Banjarbaru  City's  width is located  in the level of somewhat fragile,  then an area of 13, 118 hectares or 40 % is not fragile  and 3, 156 hectares or 9 % is fragile to flood. 3) The chart of <b>fload</b>  susceptibility  in Banjarbaru  City has shown that almost all parts of areas in Banjarbaru  City are zones with high flood  susceptibility level with the criteria of not fragile,somewhat fragile and fragile...|$|E

In many cases even the seeds would not germinate in such seed beds. Experiments have showed that the; lack of normal plant development in these beds {{is the result of}} the increase in soil salinity. This salinity may be due to additions of fertilizers or to salts introduced in the ordinary applications of water. It was found that the soil solution had an osmotic pressure of 13. 5 athmospheres at the wilting point. The tests showed that common bean (Phaseolus vulgaris L.) plants were more susceptible to the soil salinity than were the soybean and the corn plants. <b>Floading</b> of those seed beds several times resulted in the leaching of salts and the restoring of conditions favorable for normal plant growth...|$|R
40|$|This {{thesis is}} {{concerned}} with {{an investigation into the}} effects of food concentration, temperature and turbidity on the life cycle characteristics such as growth, body size, development and reproduction of species of planktonic Cladocera brought to the U. K. from a shallow turbid Lake Jacaretinga, Amazonia. The species studied were Daphnia gessneri, Moina reticulata and Diaphanosoma sarsi. Long term growth experiments were performed using both batch and continuous flow culture under controlled laboratory conditions using various combinations of temperature (22 °, 27 °, and 32 °C),concentration of algal food Scenedesmus acutus (0. 03, 0. 05, 0. 1, 0. 25, 0. 5, and 1. OmgC. 1) and turbidity (10, 20, and 50 NTU). Animals were examined daily throughout their cycle from the newborn (neonate) to 3 rd adult instars. The ecology of planktonic animals in Lake Jacaretinga was studied intensively during a three month period (February, March and April 1986). This period of study included two ecologically/limnologically important periods, namely, before the flooding of the River Amazon and after the river flooding, when the lake became more turbid due to suspended particles. Weekly samples of zooplankton providedinformation on the species composition and numerical density of the cladoceran populations as well as their horizontal distribution in five stations. Information was also obtained on environmental condition in the lake (Temperature, dissolved oxygen concentration, Secchi disc transparency, chlorophyll-a and particulate carbon concentration. Population of Diaphanosoma sarsi, Ceriodaphnia cornuta and Daphniagessneri, decreased during the flood, and populations of Moinareticulata increased and became a dominant species. Life cycle experiments shows that growth and reproduction are greatly influenced by food concentration and turbidity. Consistent differences were found between Daphnia gessneri and Moina reticulata,being Moina reticulata more successful in survival, growth and reproduction. Application of the experimental results on the effects of food, temperature and turbidity on the life cycle characteristics of the planktonic cladocerans are used to interpret the changes in the cladoceran population in Lake Jacaretinga during this period of <b>floading.</b> This is a significant contribution to our knowledge since Lake Jacaretinga is one of the characteristic varzea lakes in Central Amazonia whose limnology is largely determined by the annual flooding of Amazon River. <p...|$|R

40|$|Semarang {{city is a}} city {{which has}} the variety of slope. Besides face some {{problems}} like the <b>fload</b> and rob, Semarang also faces the mass movement problem. One of the region that has the mass movement in Semarang is Gombel Lama Semarang Golf Course. The original soil condition in Gombel Lama Semarang Golf Course dominated by clay {{and supported by the}} hilly topography condition which attract the mass movement. Otherwise, the change of slope geometry from the original condition which is used to make golf course influence the mass movement happened. This research has purpose to know and learn about the slope stability condition in Gombel Lama Semarang Golf Course and recommend the slope strength method which is right to use. 	The research method used is the descriptive and experiment methods. The analysis method that is used for analysis slope stability is the limit equilibrium method with Bishop Method. Analysis with Bishop Method is helped by model from Xstabl program. Based on the result of slope stability analysis, the first model condition of slope in research region is to have value of safety factors about 1. 321. This value are limit equilibrium value where the condition of slope in research region isn’t safe anymore. In that case, it {{can be seen from the}} condition of slope is still have the mass movement. The expedient which have to do for saving the slope in there are with the simulation of parameter change of cohesion and groundwater surface. The simulation of parameter change of cohesion has purpose to strength the slope with grouting method. Otherwise, the simulation of parameter change of groundwater surface has purpose to strength the slope with drainase method. 	Based on the simulation of parameter change of cohesion and groundwater surface which are used to saving the slope, increasing the relative cohesion value is easier to do well, even though increased groundwater surface parameter more difficult to do and can’t fulfill the criteria of safety factors which definite. In that case, it indicated that from the strength slope method which affective to safety slope in this research is grouting method. Based on the result of grouting calculation, therefore to create the safety slope in Gombel Lama Semarang Golf Course is needed Grouting until depth 22 meter with 3 spation stripes which each has radius about 3 meter. ...|$|E
