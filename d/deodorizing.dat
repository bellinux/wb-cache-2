40|$|An {{investigation}} {{was carried out}} {{to evaluate the use}} of High Performance Size-Exclusion Chromatography (HPSEC) of polar compounds of refined, mild <b>deodorized,</b> extra virgin olive oils as well as of their blends, in attempting to reveal significant differences in the amounts of the substance classes constituting polar compounds among these oils. Two sets of blends were prepared by mixing an extra virgin olive oil with both refined and mild <b>deodorized</b> olive oils in increasing amounts. The obtained data highlighted that the triacylglycerol oligopolymers were absent or present in traces in the extra virgin olive oil, while their mean amount was equal to 0. 04 g/ 100 g and 0. 72 g/ 100 g in mild <b>deodorized</b> and refined olive oils, respectively. Oxidized triacylglycerols and diacylglycerols were more abundant in mild <b>deodorized</b> oil and refined oil than in extra virgin olive oil. The Factorial Discriminant Analysis of the data showed that the HPSEC analysis could reveal the presence of refined/mild <b>deodorized</b> oils in extra virgin olive oils. In particular, the classification functions obtained allowed designation of mixtures containing at least 30 g/ 100 g of mild <b>deodorized</b> oil and all those containing refined olive oil as <b>deodorized</b> oil, therefore as oils subjected to at least a mild refining treatment...|$|R

25|$|Titanium dioxide, {{particularly}} in the anatase form, exhibits photocatalytic activity under ultraviolet (UV) irradiation. This photoactivity is reportedly most pronounced at the {001} planes of anatase, although the {101} planes are thermodynamically more stable and thus more prominent in most synthesised and natural anatase, as evident by the often observed tetragonal dipyramidal growth habit. Interfaces between rutile and anatase are further considered to improve photocatalytic activity by facilitating charge carrier separation and as a result, biphasic titanium dioxide is often considered to possess enhanced functionality as a photocatalyst. It {{has been reported that}} titanium dioxide, when doped with nitrogen ions or doped with metal oxide like tungsten trioxide, exhibits excitation also under visible light.

It can also oxidize oxygen or organic materials directly. Hence, in addition to its use as a pigment, titanium dioxide can be added to paints, cements, windows, tiles, or other products for its sterilizing, <b>deodorizing</b> and anti-fouling properties and is used as a hydrolysis catalyst. It is also used in dye-sensitized solar cells, which are a type of chemical solar cell (also known as a Graetzel cell).|$|E

Other features are automatic flushing, automatic air <b>deodorizing,</b> and a germ-resistant surface. Some models specially designed for the elderly may include armrests and devices that help the user to stand back up after use. A soft close feature slows the toilet lid down while closing so the lid does not slam onto the seat, or in some models, the toilet lid will close automatically a certain time after flushing. The most recent introduction is the ozone deodorant system that can quickly eliminate smells. Also, the latest models store the times when the toilet is used and have a power-saving mode that warms the toilet seat only during times when the toilet is likely to be used based on historic usage patterns. Some toilets also glow in the dark or may even have air conditioning below the rim for hot summer days. Another recent innovation is intelligent sensors that detect someone {{standing in front of the}} toilet and initiate an automatic raising of the lid (if the person is facing away from the toilet) or the lid and seat together (if someone is facing the toilet).|$|E

40|$|The compound, 3 -methylnonane- 2, 4 -dione (MND), has {{an intense}} odor when {{evaluated}} at the outlet {{of a gas}} chromatograph. Sensory evaluation of MND in a mineral oil/water emulsion system showed that its flavor intensity increased almost imperceptibly with increased concentration (from 0. 09 to 2. 56 ppm), and just above threshold. Also, the concentrations of MND in soybean oils at various peroxide values were between 0 to 0. 804 ppb, which were far less than concentrations tested in a mineral oil/water emulsion during sensory evaluation.
