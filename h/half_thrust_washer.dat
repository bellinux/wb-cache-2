40|$|The goal of {{this work}} is to {{investigate}} the physical mechanisms that distress <b>thrust</b> <b>washer</b> bearings through physical modeling and numerical techniques. The <b>thrust</b> <b>washer</b> bearing is subjected to non-axisymmetric loads within the planetary gear sets of automatic transmissions in automobiles. In practice the <b>thrust</b> <b>washer</b> bearing often distresses severely and unpredictably, causing transmission breakdown and liability issues. A specially designed <b>thrust</b> <b>washer</b> bearing test rig allows for controlled variation of the operational parameters (speed, load, lubrication flow rate, etc.) governing the tribological behavior of the washer. The test rig also records pertinent real-time data (frictional torque and temperature) from the bearing. In conjunction with the experimental model, a new comprehensive numerical simulation of <b>thrust</b> <b>washer</b> bearings is constructed. The numerical simulation incorporates the effects of macro-scale deformation, micro-scale surface asperity contact, heat generation, boundary and full film lubrication. To model surface asperity contact, the current work performs an extensive finite element study of elasto-plastic spherical contact. The numerical and experimental results show that significant sliding asperity contact can cause high temperatures, high friction, and severe wear. Ph. D.

40|$|Modifications to the <b>thrust</b> <b>washers</b> 2 ̆ 7 {{surfaces}} {{utilize the}} geometric wedge effect to generate {{pressure in the}} lubricant, separating the bearing surfaces and supporting the load. These modifications {{in the form of}} dimples, pockets, grooves or undulations create a hydrodynamic lubrication film that allows relative motion to occur with no surface contact, minimizing both friction and wear. A series of studies were performed to analyze the lubrication mechanisms provided by these surface modifications. Various test rigs were designed, developed and implemented to measure cavitation, pressure, and temperature distributions in the <b>thrust</b> <b>washer</b> contact. Visualizing the lubricant flow allowed the study of gaseous cavitation occurring on the leading edge of a surface pocket. The size and shape of the cavitation air bubble was found to be a function of rotational speed, contact pressure, viscosity, and pocket geometry. Experiments were then designed to map the load bearing pressure generated by the pockets. High resolution, thin-film pressure transducers were installed {{beneath the surface of the}} <b>thrust</b> <b>washer</b> pad and used to study the pressure distributions within the pockets. Interactions between adjacent pockets were shown to have a strong effect on the load carrying capacity and friction of the bearing. Temperature of the lubricant film was measured using a thermochromic sheet that changed color as a function of temperature. Video recorded during operation showed the thermochromic material dynamically adapting to the temperature rise within the bearing. The viscosity of the lubricant correlates directly with the temperature rise and was shown to have a strong effect on friction and film thickness. The gaseous cavitation, pressure and temperature distributions within the contact were also modeled numerically. Initially, ANSYS FLUENT computational fluid dynamics models were developed to corroborate experimental results. These simulations used various cavitation algorithms and pressure solvers to predict lubricant film conditions, but FLUENT was found to lack the adaptability and access necessary for high accuracy modeling. Therefore, a finite volume numerical model was developed using the thermal Reynolds equation coupled with the energy equation. The finite volume formulation was developed in FORTRAN and used to determine pressure and temperature distribution within the <b>thrust</b> <b>washer</b> contact. The experimental results were corroborated with the results obtained from this numerical model, their comparison shows that they are in good agreement. ...|$|R

40|$|In this study, an {{experimental}} investigation {{on the effects}} of grooves on <b>thrust</b> <b>washer</b> bearings is investigated. Eight equally sized grooves are machined about 100 µm deep into one side of a flat-faced steel <b>washer.</b> This <b>thrust</b> <b>washer</b> bearing is lo-cated between a helical gear and its carrier and is tested on a test rig capable of measuring frictional torque and the temperature of the bearing at different speeds. It is found that the grooved washers had lower bearing temperatures and failed at signifi-cantly higher loads than the control washer with no grooves. For a test procedure with varying operating conditions, the co-efficient of friction is also significantly lower for the grooved washers. However, the grooved washers had about the same co-efficient of friction as the control washers at each step when the speeds are very high. The results from various tests sug-gest that the increased amount of lubricant passing through the grooved surface of the washer removes heat from the washer bearing by convection. This decrease in stored heat conducted from friction deters thermoelastic instabilities and the reduction of hydrodynamic stiffness due to the decrease in viscosity. En-hanced hydrodynamic load-carrying capacity is also evident in the grooved washers test results...|$|R

40|$|A radial piston {{hydraulic}} motor has several components involving sliding or rolling interfaces which may encounter tribological problems. Seizure {{is one of}} them and it results in complete stoppage of motion between the relatively moving components and has serious consequences in terms of the operation of a {{hydraulic motor}}. Extreme running conditions, like low viscosity and high pressure and speed can cause the rupture of lubricating films and this may lead to the seizure of hydraulic motors. The occurrence of seizure often leads to undesirable damage to the motor components and unscheduled maintenance and can prove to be highly expensive. The work reported in this thesis has focused on investigating the mechanisms of seizure and developing suitable tribo test methods for simulating the sliding interfaces of the hydraulic motor. Extensive motor tests have been performed at low viscosity, high pressure and high speed. The results of this work enabled in describing the seizure progression, namely break down of lubricant film, particle entrapment and thermal expansion. Further, tests have been carried out in a rotary tribometer by using a <b>thrust</b> <b>washer</b> conformal test configuration.

40|$|Abstract: Little {{has been}} {{published}} on the ef®ciency of plastic gears {{despite the fact that}} plastic gears are used in large quantities in a variety of machines. Among the many applications where plastic gears are used, one is where any form of lubrication must be avoided, such as in of®ce printing and food-processing equipment, but dry running can lead to high friction and associated high temperatures. As more is understood about plastic gears, the trend is towards high-power applications where inef®ciencies become even more important. As high temperatures must be avoided with plastics, knowledge of ef®ciencies and friction is essential in the rating of plastic gears.

40|$|Abstract: Heavily loaded moving machine {{components}} encounter severe tribological problems. Typical examples include piston and cylinder contacts in a hydraulic motor. Piston and cylinder bore contacts invariably operate in boundary lubrication {{regime and the}} risk for seizure of these contacts is high particularly when lubricated with low-viscosity lubricants. The piston assembly in a radial piston hydraulic motor has conformal (area) contact. In this work, these contacts have been simulated in the laboratory by using a <b>thrust</b> <b>washer</b> test configuration. The influence of area ratio, nature of contacting surfaces, and speed on scuffing has been investigated by using a factorial design of experiments approach. The influence of area ratio on wear at lower speed has also been studied. The results have revealed that the surface power, or µpv-value, at scuffing varies by 3 – 4 times when the area ratio was increased from 8 to 72 per cent. The running-in wear tests have shown that running-in of {{the upper and lower}} specimens also varies with the area ratio. During the first 30 s the upper specimen is polished with low area ratio, whereas the lower specimen is polished with high area ratio. The surface temperature was estimated by using finite-element calculation and it was found to be similar prior to scuffing for both 8 and 72 per cent area ratios at 1. 7 m/s sliding speed.

40|$|The work {{described}} in this thesis formed {{part of a larger}} collaborative project between Manchester Metropolitan University, the University of Liverpool, and our industry partner Teer Coatings Ltd., which was entitled "Dual source pulsed plasmas for the production of ultra-high performance coatings. " Closed field unbalanced magnetron sputtering (CFUBMS) has become a mainstay of sputter deposition techniques. However improvements and new approaches are always being sought. This project has focused on the application of one variation, pulsed substrate bias (PSB) deposition, to the reactive sputter deposition of chromium nitride. Cr. N is of great interest to industry, as it offers similar wear and corrosion resistance to the better known TiN, but with greater thermal stability. Pulsed substrate biasing is a relatively recent technology. It potentially allows scope for improvement of coating structure, and hence tribology, through greater ion bombardment of the coating during deposition. The initial aims of this project were: To characterise the pulsed CFUBMS system during reactive deposition of Cr. N; to gain an understanding of the plasma behaviour and processes during deposition; to understand the influence of the pulsed plasma over coating microstructures, and relate relevant changes in these microstructures to changes in coating tribology. With the resultant data the project then turned to identifying {{the strengths and weaknesses of}} PSB deposition, and finding means to enhance coating performance using the technique. Plasma studies were largely undertaken at the University of Liverpool, using optical spectrometry, CCD camera imaging, and Langmuir probe measurements. Based on these finding 5 coatings were deposited at MMU, and subjected to structural and tribological tests such as scratch adhesion testing, nanoindentation, <b>thrust</b> <b>washer</b> wear testing, surface profilometry, and optical microscopy. Selected coatings were deposited onto cutting tools (twist drills) and tested to failure in a simulated industrial environment. Coating microstructure was investigated at MMU by SEM and EDS. Selected coatings were investigated by XRD at the University of Sofia, and by TEM at Oxford University. The pulsed CFUBMS system is shown to be adequately stable to reactively sputter Cr-N. PSB deposition is shown to increase ion bombardment at the substrate. Enhanced ion bombardment is in turn related to the growth of a denser coating, with a more ordered crystallographic structure with greater surface hardness. However the PSB approach is also shown to increase compressive stress within the coating, and potentially damage effective adhesion. As a consequence we have sought to combine the DC bias and PSB methods, as well as changes in coating stoichiometry, in a series of layered coatings. The best performing of these layered coating architectures is significantly harder wearing than standard CrN coatings, and approaches the wear resistance of CrTiAlN coatings in drill tests. Pulsed substrate bias deposition is a potentially powerful addition to the portfolio of sputter coating techniques. Here it has been successfully applied to enhance the microstructure, tribology, and wear resistance of Cr. N coatings. EThOS - Electronic Theses Online ServiceGBUnited Kingdo...|$|R
