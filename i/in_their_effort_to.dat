Only small-scale covert operations in support of the air campaigns had, however, been conducted on the ground inside Laos to halt the flow of men and supplies on the trail.|$|E

5|$|Sihanouk came {{to believe}} that {{communist}} triumph in Southeast Asia was inevitable and that Cambodia's military was incapable of defeating the Democratic Republic of Vietnam (North Vietnam), even with U.S. support. If Cambodia (and his rule) was to survive, he would have to make a bargain with the devil. On 10 April 1965 he broke off diplomatic relations with the U.S. and swung politically to the left. To gain foreign support, both economic and political, Sihanouk turned to the People's Republic of China. One of the terms of the agreement between Sihanouk and Premier Zhou Enlai was that Cambodia would allow the use of its eastern border by the North Vietnamese <b>in</b> <b>their</b> <b>effort</b> <b>to</b> reunify the two Vietnams.|$|E
5|$|Ulysses S. Grant (born Hiram Ulysses Grant, April 27, 1822 – July 23, 1885) was a {{prominent}} United States Army general during the American Civil War and Commanding General {{at the conclusion of}} that war. He was elected as the 18th President of the United States in 1868, serving from 1869 to 1877. As Commanding General, Grant worked closely with President Abraham Lincoln to lead the Union Army to victory over the Confederacy. After Lincoln's assassination, Grant's assignment in implementing Reconstruction often put him at odds with President Andrew Johnson, Lincoln's successor. Twice elected president, Grant led the Republicans <b>in</b> <b>their</b> <b>effort</b> <b>to</b> remove the vestiges of Confederate nationalism and slavery, protect African-American citizenship, and support economic prosperity. Grant's presidency has often been criticized for its scandals and for his failure to alleviate the economic depression following the Panic of 1873, but modern scholarship regards him as a president who performed a difficult job with some merit, and took strong action on civil rights for African Americans.|$|E

25|$|<b>In</b> <b>their</b> <b>effort</b> <b>to</b> attain food security, Southwestern Indians {{cultivated}} the floodplains {{of rivers}} and ephemeral streams. Crops were planted on floodplains and islands {{to take advantage}} of high water when the river or stream overflowed, saturated the land with water and enriched the soil with silt. This method was most effective when floods came at predictable times. Floodplain cultivation was used instead of canal irrigation by the La Junta Indians (often called Jumano) along the Rio Grande in western Texas and was also employed by other peoples.|$|E

Late in 1915 Lane joined Socialist Meyer London in co-sponsoring a resolution criticizing the deepening sense of war-related fear and calling upon Woodrow Wilson to convene a conference of neutral nations {{with a view to}} ending the European conflict. Even after the resumption of unlimited German submarine warfare <b>in</b> <b>their</b> <b>effort</b> <b>to</b> blockade their enemies, Lane refused to support an end to diplomatic relations with the German empire. Lane was an outspoken opponent of Wilson's plan to arm merchant ships, arguing that the conservative Democratic President was thereby attempting to usurp the Congressional prerogative to declare war and to replace it with Executive authority.|$|E
25|$|Alexandria figured {{prominently}} in the military operations of Napoleon's expedition to Egypt in 1798. French troops stormed the city on 2 July 1798, and it remained in their hands until {{the arrival of a}} British expedition in 1801. The British won a considerable victory over the French at the Battle of Alexandria on 21 March 1801, following which they besieged the city, which fell to them on 2 September 1801. Muhammad Ali, the Ottoman governor of Egypt, began rebuilding and redevelopment around 1810, and by 1850, Alexandria had returned to something akin to its former glory. Egypt turned to Europe <b>in</b> <b>their</b> <b>effort</b> <b>to</b> modernize the country. Greeks, followed by other Europeans and others, began moving to the city.

25|$|Muslim leaders <b>in</b> <b>their</b> <b>effort</b> <b>to</b> win {{converts}} encouraged {{attendance at}} Muslim prayer {{with promises of}} money and allowed the Quran to be recited in Persian instead of Arabic {{so that it would}} be intelligible to all. Islam was readily accepted by Zoroastrians who were employed in industrial and artisan positions because, according to Zoroastrian dogma, such occupations that involved defiling fire made them impure. Moreover, Muslim missionaries did not encounter difficulty in explaining Islamic tenets to Zoroastrians, as there were many similarities between the faiths. According to Thomas Walker Arnold, for the Persian, he would meet Ahura Mazda and Ahriman under the names of Allah and Iblis. In Afghanistan, Islam was spread due to Umayyad missionary efforts particularly under the reign of Hisham ibn Abd al-Malik and Umar ibn AbdulAziz.|$|E

25|$|Nitrogen {{is present}} in the {{environment}} {{in a wide variety of}} chemical forms including organic nitrogen, Ammonium (NH), nitrite (NO), nitrate (NO), nitrous oxide (N2O), Nitric oxide (NO) or inorganic nitrogen gas (N2). Organic nitrogen may be in the form of a living organism, humus or in the intermediate products of organic matter decomposition. The processes of the nitrogen cycle transform nitrogen from one form to another. Many of those processes are carried out by microbes, either <b>in</b> <b>their</b> <b>effort</b> <b>to</b> harvest energy or to accumulate nitrogen in a form needed for their growth. For example, the nitrogenous wastes in animal urine are broken down by nitrifying bacteria in the soil to be used as new. The diagram besides shows how these processes fit together to form the nitrogen cycle.|$|E
25|$|In 1996 and 1997, BAYSWAN {{provided}} {{support to}} the workers at the Lusty Lady Theatre, a peep show in San Francisco, <b>in</b> <b>their</b> <b>effort</b> <b>to</b> persuade club management to remove the one-way mirrors in customer booths that allowed customers to clandestinely photograph and videotape dancers, the product of which they feared would begin appearing on the Internet or on bootleg videos without dancer permission or compensation. BAYSWAN provided website support for {{the efforts of the}} Exotic Dancers Alliance, which took part in the Lusty Lady unionization effort; the website in turn helped to garner public support for the workers as well as inquiries from other exotic dancers and sex workers throughout the country. The group ultimately approached Service Employees International Union Local 790, and in April 1997 Lusty Lady employees voted to unionize, forming the Exotic Dancers Union (EDU), the first sex workers organization of its kind. The union was still active at the venue, which became a worker-owned cooperative in 2003, until its closing on September 2, 2013.|$|E

500|$|According to author John Hagen, Toronto's then-mayor, William Dennison, was openly {{antagonistic}} to {{the influx}} of American hippies, draft resisters, and those who supported them who were coming to Canada in large numbers {{during the height of}} the Vietnam War. In his 2001 book, Northern Passage: American Vietnam War Resisters in Canada, Hagen wrote: [...] "The mayors of Canada's largest cities used the (War Measures Act) in a backlash against American war resisters." [...] Dennison stated: [...] "a few hippies and deserters are Toronto's only problem." [...] Mayor Jean Drapeau of Montreal asserted that military resisters were part of a [...] "revolutionary conspiracy." [...] Vancouver's mayor, Tom Campbell, commented: [...] "I don't like draft dodgers and I'll do anything within the law that allows me to get rid of them." [...] While all three men supported use of the War Measures Act to harass war resisters and hippies, Campbell was the most aggressive; he told the Toronto Star: [...] "I believe the law should be used against any revolutionary whether he's a US draft dodger or a hippie."
