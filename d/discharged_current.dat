There is a particular danger if this occurs on an escalator where there is also the risk of fire from major mechanical failure.

The data from our experimental investigations showed that BTEX sorption to SMZ can be described by a linear isotherm model, and competitive effects between compounds were not significant. The SMZ can be readily regenerated using air stripping. We field-tested a prototype SMZ-based water treatment system at produced water treatment facilities and found that the SMZ successfully removes BTEX from produced waters as predicted by laboratory studies. When compared to other existing treatment technologies, the cost of the SMZ system is very competitive. Furthermore, the SMZ system is relatively compact, does not require the storage of potentially hazardous chemicals, and could be readily adapted to an automated system...|$|E

40|$|The work {{reported}} in this thesis {{is based on the}} systematic investigation of x-rays emitted from a Mather type plasma focus by varying charging voltage (capacitor bank energy/ <b>discharged</b> <b>current)</b> to devise x-ray emission scaling laws. A three channel x-ray detector consisting of Quantrad Si PIN-diodes masked with Co, Ni, Cu, Mo, Ti, Ag, and Pb filters is employed for time-resolved measurements. Time-integrated x-ray measurements are performed with a multi-pinhole camera with suitable filters' thickness. First a 9 ÂµF capacitor bank along with a triggertron type sparkgap, charged at 12 kV to 20 kV (0. 6 - 1. 8 kJ), that provides 100 kA to 175 kA peak discharge current is used. In the first experiment titanium K-series line radiation and total x-ray yield is measured with Ti insert at 15 kV charging voltage with hydrogen filling. The second experiment is performed with Cu flat tip anode; argon is used as a working gas and the charging voltage is varied from 12 kV to 20 kV. In the third experiment with Cu flat tip anode and hydrogen filling; charging voltage is varied from 16 kV to 20 kV to study the Cu-Ka line radiation. The ratio of the Cu-Ka to total x-ray emission varies from 0. 20 to 0. 30, whereas the highest value of ratio of Cu-Ka to continuous x-ray emission is about 0. 46. In another experiment, an appropriate cut at the anode tip increases side-on x-ray flux three times as compared to that of a tapered anode. For further experimentation a 12. 5 ÂµF single capacitor along with the field distortion type pressurized spark gap, which is charged at 19 kV to 29 kV (2. 3 - 5. 2 kJ) giving peak discharge current of about 185 kA to 290 kA is employed. In the first experiment, the variation of x-ray emission for Cu flat tip anode is studied for charging voltage varying from 19 kV to 27 kV. The rest of the experiments are conducted with Mo and W anode inserts for Mo K-series and the total x-ray yield. Scaling laws are devised for Cu-KÎ± and Mo K-series as well as for total x-ray emission in these experiments. It is observed that the radiated energy strongly depends upon the filling pressure {{as well as on the}} type of the gas and the insert. There is a significant increase in the characteristic and the total x-ray emission with the increase of charging voltage and stored energy. Observation reveals that with hydrogen filling x-ray emission is decreased as compared to argon filling. The K-series emission may result due to interaction of energetic electron beam emitted from the focus region and the energetic electrons in the current sheath with the anode tip. The hard filters do not transmit the x-rays emitted from the pinch column and this region is not visible.
