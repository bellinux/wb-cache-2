According to the Congressional Research Service, [...] "The U.S. {{government}} holds Hezbollah {{responsible for}} a number of attacks and hostage takings targeting Americans in Lebanon during the 1980s, including the bombing of the U.S. Embassy in Beirut in April 1983 and the bombing of the U.S. Marine barracks in October 1983, which together killed 258 Americans. Hezbollah’s operations outside of Lebanon, including its participation in bombings of Israeli and Jewish targets in Argentina during the 1990s and more recent training and liaison activities with Shiite insurgents <b>in</b> <b>Iraq,</b> <b>have</b> cemented the organization’s reputation among U.S. policy makers as a capable and deadly adversary with potential global reach." ...|$|E
500|$|In 1995, {{one year}} after the start of the Shia-led 1990s {{uprising}} in Bahrain, Khalid bin Ahmed publicly distributed a [...] "politically charged poem" [...] that contained [...] "racist and hateful views" [...] of the Shia. One verse of the poem called for [...] "spill their bloods until they all die", another called for [...] "remov them from every sensitive position". Khalaf said the poem was [...] "part of the tribal-cum-ethnic-cum-political mobilization and counter mobilization". According to Michael Field, Khalid [...] "as reputation for being very hard on the Shias". Freedom House mentioned that the Khawalid brothers [...] "espouse a decidedly anti-Shiite agenda, conceiving of the community as a veritable fifth column to be dealt with in the framework of security, rather than through political bargaining". The sectarian violence and rise of Shia powers <b>in</b> <b>Iraq</b> <b>have</b> only strengthened this belief. This view of Shia as a security problem led the Khawalid brothers to consider any economic and political reforms as invalid. Instead they thought that these reforms would only lead the Shia to demand even more.|$|E

2500|$|Opponents of {{military}} intervention <b>in</b> <b>Iraq</b> <b>have</b> attacked {{the decision to}} invade Iraq along a number of lines, including the human cost of war, calling into question the evidence used to justify the war, arguing for continued diplomacy, challenging the war's legality, suggesting that the U.S. had other more pressing security priorities, (i.e., Afghanistan and North Korea) and predicting that the war would destabilize the Middle East region. [...] In 2010 an independent commission of inquiry {{set up by the}} government of the Netherlands, maintained that UN resolution 1441 [...] "cannot reasonably be interpreted (as the Dutch government did) as authorising individual member states to use military force to compel Iraq to comply with the Security Council's resolutions." [...] Accordingly, the Dutch commission concluded that the 2003 invasion violated international law.|$|E
2500|$|Excavations <b>in</b> <b>Iraq</b> <b>have</b> {{revealed}} {{evidence of}} localized flooding at Shuruppak (modern Tell Fara, Iraq) {{and various other}} Sumerian cities. A layer of riverine sediments, radiocarbon dated to about 2900BC, interrupts the continuity of settlement, extending {{as far north as}} the city of Kish, which took over hegemony after the flood. [...] Polychrome pottery from the Jemdet Nasr period (3000–2900BC) was discovered immediately below the Shuruppak flood stratum. [...] Other sites, such as Ur, Kish, Uruk, Lagash, and Ninevah, all present evidence of flooding. However, this evidence comes from different time periods. Geologically, the Shuruppak flood coincides with the 5.9 kiloyear event {{at the end of the}} Older Peron. [...] It would seem to have been a localised event caused through the damming of the Kurun through the spread of dunes, flooding into the Tigris, and simultaneous heavy rainfall in the Nineveh region, spilling across into the Euphrates. [...] In Israel, there is no such evidence of a widespread flood. [...] Given the similarities in the Mesopotamian flood story and the Biblical account, it would seem that they have a common origin in the memories of the Shuruppak account.|$|E
