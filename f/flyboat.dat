5|$|As {{the fleet}} {{continued}} south from the Cape in early June, Burrough in the Roebuck took a Spanish <b>flyboat</b> {{after a long}} chase that brought him near the Spanish coast. The flyboat's master revealed that a great fleet was prepared at Cadiz and Sanlúcar de Barrameda. Having received intelligence that Raleigh was fitted out with a strong force for the West Indies, Philip II of Spain had provided a large fleet to oppose Raleigh and to escort the rich East India carracks to port. Don Alonso de Bazán, brother to the Marquis of Santa Cruz and Captain General of the Armada, was to pursue and intercept Raleigh's fleet. As Burrough's men were burning the <b>flyboat,</b> part of the Spanish fleet was spotted, and Burrough, having rejoined his own fleet, soon sailed to the Azores.|$|E
25|$|In March 2008, Fisher-Price began distributing {{a line of}} {{official}} Wonder Pets! toys in the United States. Toys include the <b>Flyboat,</b> figurine playsets, and plush animals. These figurine playsets have each Wonder Pet saving a different baby animal. These include Linny saving a baby penguin, Tuck saving a baby bluebird, and Ming-Ming rescuing a kitten. In addition there is a whale playset for the tub. Nickelodeon Universe, a theme park inside Minnesota's Mall of America, also has a children's ride dedicated to the <b>Flyboat.</b>|$|E
25|$|When {{they get}} back to the classroom, they wordlessly return to their cages, and their hats and capes come off. The <b>Flyboat</b> also disassembles by itself. Ming-Ming is always the first one to get back in her cage, Tuck is always the second, and Linny is always the last. A music style having to do with that day's rescue is played, as Linny takes a bite out of the celery in her cage and winks towards the camera as the closing credits begin.|$|E
5000|$|The name [...] "flyboat" [...] is also {{derived from}} Dutch vlieboot, a boat with a shallow enough draught {{to be able}} to {{navigate}} a shallow vlie or river estuary, such as the Vlie. Armed <b>flyboats</b> were used by the naval forces of the Dutch rebels, the Watergeuzen, {{in the beginning of the}} Eighty Years' War. The type resembled a small carrack and had two or at most three masts, a high board and a dozen iron cannons. Small, inexpensive and manoeuvrable, it was ideal for privateering activities in the European coastal waters and soon imitated by privateers or pirates of other nations. The Dutch navy, and their enemies, the Dunkirkers, at first extensively employed <b>flyboats.</b> In 1588 the army of Alexander Farnese was blocked in Dunkirk by a fleet of thirty Dutch <b>flyboats</b> commanded by Lieutenant-Admiral Justin of Nassau, preventing him from joining the Spanish Armada to invade England.|$|R
50|$|In the 1930s, Pan American World Airways had {{scheduled}} {{flights from}} Miami to San Salvador stopping in Havanna, Cozumel, Mérida, Belize and Puerto Barrios, using Sikorsky 40 <b>flyboats.</b>|$|R
50|$|<b>Flyboats</b> {{pulled by}} one or more horses {{continued}} to be used in Britain and Ireland {{for a number of years}} and even in America, but ultimately the railway proved the winner.|$|R
25|$|Meanwhile, {{reports of}} the Armada having sailed began to filter in England but also that a rumour from Ireland that one {{thousand}} five hundred Spanish had landed, with the whole island in revolt. Charles Howard sent out a powerful fleet which included thirteen galleons, to find the dismembered remainders of the armada but found only floating wreckage and bodies. A Spanish <b>flyboat</b> however was captured along with 200 of her crew and from this the knowledge and extent of the armada was then discovered.|$|E
25|$|In {{the thick}} of the battle an English man of war took a hit in her powder {{magazine}} and blew up and sank with most of her crew, and a 30-gun French man of war and a smaller <b>flyboat</b> were destroyed by fireships. The French and the Dutch seeing that they could not get through realized the battle had been lost. The battle then ended with a desultory long-range exchange between both ﬂeets, with the English fleet still holding its line, de La Barre with increasing casualties and his ship severely damaged then decided to withdraw off towards Saint Kitts by 2 p.m. compelling the Dutch under an angry Crijnssen to follow.|$|E
25|$|On the 30th a warship {{under the}} command of Captain Bowden from Howard's fleet had intercepted and {{captured}} a ship from the Spanish fleet off Cape Finisterre. The prize was a <b>flyboat</b> carrying an army captain and 40 soldiers besides sailors, and Bowden had boarded and taken her with a crew of only 28 men and boys. The captain and officers were again interrogated and the same evidence of the Spanish invasion was given, but the news this time was that the captain had only seen one of his consorts, heading some 30 leagues to the coast of Spain. Further evidence of the Spanish retreat was given by Sir George Carew in the Adventure who after a storm had driven his squadron further south, saw and immediately pursued eleven ships bearing the flag of Castile hastening back home to Spain. The Spanish ships were too far ahead to be intercepted however so Carew joined Howard with the main fleet to give the news. These two reports meant that the invasion was effectively over; Howard and Raleigh sent the fleet back to Plymouth to report the news to Parliament and court.|$|E
50|$|In 1925 SCADTA of Colombia made a {{historical}} journey with two Dornier Wal <b>flyboats</b> from Barranquilla to Palm Beach stopping in Panama, Costa Rica, Nicaragua, El Salvador, Puerto San José, Amatitlán, Puerto Barrios, Cozumel, Havana and Miami.|$|R
5|$|Mansell, {{with three}} ships (the 30 gun Hope {{along with the}} 42 gun Victory and the Answer) {{departed}} and patrolled about Dungeness. Mansell's flag captain {{came up with the}} strategy on how to tackle Spinola; he predicted that Spinola would try to sail close to the English coast. Acting on this hunch Mansell set one ship a good distance from another using <b>flyboats</b> so that a good communication system was erected between themselves and the Dutch fleet off the Flemish coast under acting Vice-Admiral Jan Cant. On the 3rd Mansell was soon joined by two Dutch <b>flyboats,</b> Samson, and the Moon to improve communication and now Spinola was effectively sailing into a trap.|$|R
60|$|The loss or {{decay of}} this trade {{accounts}} for the present pretended decay {{of the town of}} Ipswich, of which I shall speak more presently. The ships wore out, the masters died off, the trade took a new turn; Dutch <b>flyboats</b> taken in the war, and made free ships by Act of Parliament, thrust themselves into the coal-trade for the interest of the captors, such as the Yarmouth and London merchants, and others; and the Ipswich men dropped gradually out of it, being discouraged by those Dutch <b>flyboats.</b> These Dutch vessels, which cost nothing but the caption, were bought cheap, carried great burthens, and the Ipswich building fell off for want of price, and so the trade decayed, and the town with it. I believe this will be owned for the true beginning of their decay, if I must allow it to be called a decay.|$|R
25|$|At first, the Adelantado {{tried to}} ride out the storm {{in the hope that}} the weather would relent; but at dawn the next day, the winds only intensified. For three days the storm blew, Spanish ship losses increased, the San Lucas ran aground off the Lizard casting away their horses and mules. The galleon {{carrying}} Don Pedro Guevera - General of artillery, caught fire, blew up in a tremendous explosion and was never seen again. Another large vessel with siege equipment and flammables (for burning English ships in Falmouth) also suffered a catastrophic explosion which took with her a chartered French ship full of soldiers. Only one of the large galleons sank; the San Bartolomé when it was dashed on rocks near the Isles of Scilly. In the San Pedro, Brochero had to drop out of the station to a Biscay port as the ship was so badly damaged, but put to sea again in a <b>flyboat</b> and rejoined the armada. He attempted to rally them in one last effort to make a landing at Milford Haven, Waterford, Cork or Brest. In the night of 25 October seeing that the currents were unrelenting he reluctantly ordered the remaining ships to start to part company and to scatter, each one thinking of their own safety.|$|E
2500|$|The <b>Flyboat</b> is {{the primary}} mode of {{transportation}} in the series. The main base is a red flying disc with 4 blue and yellow wheels, it has 3 lights: 1 green, 1 orange and 1 purple; the <b>Flyboat</b> has a clear plastic bottom where 5 gears, that are possibly part of the engine, are visible. The Flyboat's rocket boosters are 2 felt marker caps that are controlled by a green Popsicle stick that when lifted up makes boosters point down, which allows the <b>Flyboat</b> to hover in the air. Lastly, the boat has a mast made out of blue Erector pieces with a marble on top and a sail (the color, design, and print varies) with the Wonder Pets logo on it. Usually, Linny pilots the <b>Flyboat,</b> but there are episodes where Ming-Ming or Tuck pilot it instead. Most other modes of transportation are {{a variation of the}} <b>Flyboat</b> and primarily use the same components such as the Flysub, which is basically a modified <b>Flyboat</b> capable of traveling underwater or modify it to fit a specific theme tied to the theme of the episode such as The Circusboat in [...] "Join the Circus!". In [...] "Save the Raccoon", the <b>Flyboat</b> breaks down during their rescue of a Baby Raccoon stuck in a Recycling Bin and find that its gears have come loose, forcing them to create a new vehicle called the Flycycle from recyclable materials in order to save the Baby Raccoon. In [...] "Save the Loch Ness Monster", it is shown that the <b>Flyboat</b> can be converted in a sail/motor boat by changing the position of the wheels and the boosters, called the Boat-Boat. In [...] "Three Wonder Pets and a Baby", Linny decides to create Babyboat, using a red Baby carriage as its main base instead of the Flyboat's red disc. The Wonder Pets have trouble building it at first as they are all trying to do everything at the same time so Linny suggests that they build it step-by-step and this solution to build the Babyboat would later inspire them of how to deal with pacifying the crying Baby Piglet. In [...] "Ollie to the Rescue", Ollie creates his own version for his Thunder Pets team, which he calls the Ollieboat. He uses the Flyboats red flying disc as its main base and a carrot for a mast. However, Ollie is a poor flyer and requires the Wonder Pets assistance to fly the Ollieboat out of the classroom.|$|E
2500|$|Once dressed, they {{assemble}} a flying boat called [...] "The Flyboat" [...] from classroom objects: a flying disc for a body, felt marker caps as rocket exhausts, a marble, wheels, the mast, and {{a sheet of}} paper for the sail. In some episodes, the Wonder Pets will instead opt for a different mode of transportation such as sub called the [...] "Flysub", which they will construct using additional objects in the classroom or they will modify the <b>Flyboat</b> in some way either out of necessity (such as replacing one of the pieces of the <b>Flyboat</b> with something else) or some other reason. Usually, the Wonder Pets encounter some sort of obstacle before leaving the classroom. The solution is invariably similar to the action they will need to take to save the animal in trouble.|$|E
50|$|Richard the Lionheart {{developed}} {{a fleet of}} war galleys that {{was referred to as}} <b>flyboats</b> in the twelfth century. They were of Viking longship design made for speed and riverine warfare. They were tested in a port at Les Andelys under the protection of his new castle there. These boats were on the Seine River and from the towns of Portsmouth to Rouen.|$|R

2500|$|Little Bee is a bee {{who appears}} in the series. Little Bee first guest stars in the episode [...] "Save the Bee!" [...] where the pets shrink down to bug size, thanks to their {{shrinking}} machine, to help her collect flower nectar and make honey for the first time.

2500|$|Turtle Tuck (voiced by Teala Dunn in the U.S. and Callum Hanks in the UK) {{is a young}} turtle and {{the second}} oldest of the Wonder Pets. He is {{described}} as sensitive with an emotional connection to living things and {{the heart of the}} group. As a superhero, he wears a white French sailor's cap, blue Aquasocks, and a red cape. Tuck is empathetic, often desiring to give the rescued animals a hug or keeping them company while Linny and Ming-Ming put their rescue plan into action. He seems to enjoy things better when they stay the same (i.e. in [...] "Save the Ants!", Ming-Ming wanted to try red wheels for the <b>Flyboat</b> for a change, but Tuck wanted to stick to the same blue ones). He also has keen observational skills, spotting things from a distance, which often garners him the compliment, [...] "Good eye, Tuck!". Tuck is the only male in the Wonder Pets team. He is also the only Wonder Pet to wear foot covering. In [...] "Tuck & Buck", his cooler older cousin Buck comes to the Wonder Pets Schoolhouse for a visit.|$|E
60|$|On the 12th of November, 1577, {{the fleet}} sailed out of Plymouth Sound amid the salutes {{of the guns}} of the fort there. It {{consisted}} of five ships: the Pelican, of 100 tons, the flagship, commanded by Captain General Francis Drake; the Elizabeth, 80 tons, Captain John Winter; the Marigold, a barque of 30 tons, Captain John Thomas; the Swan, a <b>flyboat</b> of 50 tons, Captain John Chester; and the Christopher, a pinnace of 15 tons, Captain Thomas Moore.|$|E
50|$|This canal—11 miles without locks {{into the}} centre of Glasgow—was an ideal {{situation}} for this venture. It was found that once the boat was planing, the wash that damaged the canal banks largely disappeared and by 1835 flat iron boats of up to 65 feet made 323,290 passenger trips at 10 mph in a year. Services were established on the Forth and Clyde and on the Shropshire Union Canal <b>flyboats</b> with a single horse pulled 22 ton loads at 10 mph as late as 1847. They were also called swift boats or gig boats.|$|R
50|$|When {{the fleet}} sailed {{it was made}} up of six royal galleons, 60 English armed merchantmen, 60 Dutch <b>flyboats</b> and about 20 pinnaces. In {{addition}} to the troops, there were 4,000 sailors and 1,500 officers and gentlemen adventurers. Drake assigned his vessels to five squadrons, led respectively by himself in the Revenge, Sir John Norreys in the Nonpareil, Norreys' brother Edward in the Foresight, Thomas Fenner in the Dreadnought, and Roger Williams in the Swiftsure. Also sailing with them — against the Queen's express orders — was the Earl of Essex.|$|R

50|$|The Battle of Bayona Islands, {{also known}} as the Battle of Bayona Bay, was a naval {{engagement}} that took place in early of 1590, off Bayona Islands (present-day Cíes Islands), near Bayona (or Baiona) and Vigo, Spain, between a small Spanish naval force commanded by Captain Don Pedro de Zubiaur, and an Anglo-Dutch flotilla of 14 ships, during the Eighty Years' War, and {{in the context of the}} Anglo-Spanish War (1585-1604) and the French Wars of Religion. After several hours of hard combat, the Spanish naval force composed by three <b>flyboats,</b> achieved a great success, and the Anglo-Dutch fleet was totally defeated.

50|$|Drake arrived of Newfoundland {{in early}} mid August and landed at St. Johns {{establishing}} England's claimant {{on the place}} again. He thus used the place {{as a base for}} his operations gathering supplies and fresh water. Whilst there he alerted the English fishermen to the danger of heading directly to markets in Spain and Portugal. Instead of heading home many of them joined their ranks and Drake's ships soon increased in number to ten, many of them armed. As the English then established themselves they then intercepted, plundered, captured and even burned many Spanish and Portuguese fishing ships. A few armed <b>flyboats</b> protecting them met the same fate; although small in number, they were no match for the heavily English ships and most either fled or were captured.|$|R
50|$|The {{plan was}} that Parma's troops would cross the channel in barges, {{protected}} by the Armada. The Armada reached the area a year later, but poor communication between Parma and the Armada's commander, Alonso Pérez de Guzmán, 7th Duke of Medina Sidonia, made effective coordination difficult. Parma's troops were also threatened {{by the presence of}} Dutch forces in <b>flyboats,</b> who hoped to destroy the barges and drown Parma's army at sea. The English attack on the Armada in the Battle of Gravelines (1588), followed by an unfavourable change in wind-direction, made link-up impossible. After the Armada's defeat, Farnese broke up his camp in Dunkirk in September and went on to besiege the predominately English garrison at Bergen Op Zoom. After a siege which had lasted six week Parma was defeated and then withdrew to Brussels.|$|R
