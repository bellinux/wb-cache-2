5|$|For a {{detailed}} list {{of information on}} the discovery of each individual <b>darmstadtium</b> isotope, see isotopes of <b>darmstadtium.</b>|$|E
5|$|<b>Darmstadtium</b> has no stable or {{naturally}} occurring isotopes. Several radioactive isotopes have been synthesized in the laboratory, either by fusing two atoms or by observing {{the decay of}} heavier elements. Nine different isotopes of <b>darmstadtium</b> have been reported with atomic masses 267, 269–271, 273, 277, and 279–281, although darmstadtium-267 and darmstadtium-280 are unconfirmed. Two <b>darmstadtium</b> isotopes, darmstadtium-270 and darmstadtium-271, have known metastable states. Most of these decay predominantly through alpha decay, but some undergo spontaneous fission.|$|E
5|$|<b>Darmstadtium</b> is a {{synthetic}} chemical element with symbol Ds and atomic number 110. It {{is an extremely}} radioactive synthetic element. The most stable known isotope, darmstadtium-281, has a half-life of approximately 10seconds. <b>Darmstadtium</b> was first created in 1994 by the GSI Helmholtz Centre for Heavy Ion Research {{near the city of}} Darmstadt, Germany, after which it was named.|$|E
5|$|The name <b>darmstadtium</b> (Ds) was {{suggested}} by the GSI team {{in honor of the}} city of Darmstadt, where the element was discovered. The GSI team originally also considered naming the element wixhausium, after the suburb of Darmstadt known as Wixhausen where the element was discovered, but eventually decided on <b>darmstadtium.</b> The new name was officially recommended by IUPAC on August 16, 2003.|$|E
5|$|The outer {{electron}} configuration of <b>darmstadtium</b> is calculated to be 6d87s2, which obeys the Aufbau principle {{and does not}} follow platinum's outer {{electron configuration}} of 5d96s1. This {{is due to the}} relativistic stabilization of the 7s2 electron pair over the whole seventh period, so that none of the elements from 104 to 112 are expected to have electron configurations violating the Aufbau principle. The atomic radius of <b>darmstadtium</b> is expected to be around 132pm.|$|E
5|$|<b>Darmstadtium</b> is {{expected}} to be a solid under normal conditions and to crystallize in the body-centered cubic structure, unlike its lighter congeners which crystallize in the face-centered cubic structure, because it {{is expected}} to have different electron charge densities from them. It should be a very heavy metal with a density of around 34.8g/cm3. In comparison, the densest known element that has had its density measured, osmium, has a density of only 22.61g/cm3. This results from darmstadtium's high atomic weight, the lanthanide and actinide contractions, and relativistic effects, although production of enough <b>darmstadtium</b> to measure this quantity would be impractical, and the sample would quickly decay.|$|E
5|$|<b>Darmstadtium</b> is {{the eighth}} {{member of the}} 6d series of {{transition}} metals. Since copernicium (element 112) {{has been shown to}} be a transition metal, it is expected that all the elements from 104 to 112 would continue a fourth transition metal series, with <b>darmstadtium</b> as part of the platinum group metals and a noble metal. Calculations on its ionization potentials and atomic and ionic radii are similar to that of its lighter homologue platinum, thus implying that darmstadtium's basic properties will resemble those of the other group 10 elements, nickel, palladium, and platinum.|$|E
5|$|The undiscovered isotope 284Ds {{has been}} {{predicted}} {{to be the}} most stable towards beta decay; however, no known <b>darmstadtium</b> isotope has been observed to undergo beta decay. Theoretical calculation in a quantum tunneling model reproduces the experimental alpha decay half-life data for the known <b>darmstadtium</b> isotopes. It also predicts that the undiscovered isotope 294Ds, which has a magic number of neutrons (184), would have an alpha decay half-life on the order of 311years: exactly the same approach predicts a ~3500-year alpha half-life for the non-magic 293Ds isotope, however.|$|E
5|$|In the {{periodic}} table, it is a d-block transactinide element. It {{is a member}} of the 7th period and is placed in the group 10 elements, although no chemical experiments have yet been carried out to confirm that it behaves as the heavier homologue to platinum in group 10 as the eighth member of the 6d series of transition metals. <b>Darmstadtium</b> is calculated to have similar properties to its lighter homologues, nickel, palladium, and platinum.|$|E
5|$|The proton-rich {{isotopes}} from 258Sg to 261Sg {{were directly}} produced by cold fusion; all heavier isotopes were produced from the repeated alpha decay of the heavier elements hassium, <b>darmstadtium,</b> and flerovium, with the exceptions of the isotopes 263mSg, 264Sg, 265Sg, and 265mSg, which were directly produced by hot fusion through irradiation of actinide targets. The twelve isotopes of seaborgium have half-lives ranging from 92microseconds for 261Sg to 3.1minutes for 269Sg.|$|E
5|$|The more neutron-rich <b>darmstadtium</b> {{isotopes}} are {{the most}} stable and are thus more promising for chemical studies; however, they can only be produced indirectly from the alpha decay of heavier elements, and indirect synthesis methods are not favourable for chemical studies. The more neutron-rich isotopes 276Ds and 277Ds might be produced directly in the reaction between thorium-232 and calcium-48, but the yield {{is expected to be}} low. Furthermore, this reaction has already been tested without success, and more recent experiments that have successfully synthesized 277Ds using indirect methods show that it has a short half-life of 5.7ms, not long enough to perform chemical studies.|$|E
5|$|Evidence for the magicity of the Z=108 proton shell can be {{obtained}} from two sources: the variation in the partial spontaneous fission half-lives for isotones and the large gap in the alpha Q value for isotonic nuclei of hassium and <b>darmstadtium.</b> For spontaneous fission, it is necessary to measure the half-lives for the isotonic nuclei 268Sg, 270Hs and 272Ds. Since the isotopes 268Sg and 272Ds are not currently known, and fission of 270Hs has not been measured, this method cannot yet be used to confirm the stabilizing nature of the Z=108 shell. Good evidence for the magicity of the Z=108 shell can nevertheless be found from the large differences in the alpha decay energies measured for 270Hs, 271Ds and 273Ds. More conclusive evidence would come from the determination of the decay energy for the unknown nucleus 272Ds.|$|E
5|$|Prior to this, {{there had}} been failed {{synthesis}} attempts in 1986–7 at the Joint Institute for Nuclear Research in Dubna (then in the Soviet Union) and in 1990 at the GSI; a 1995 attempt at the Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory resulted in signs suggesting but not pointing conclusively at {{the discovery of a}} new isotope 267Ds formed in the bombardment of 209Bi with 59Co, and a similarly inconclusive 1994 attempt at the JINR showed signs of 273Ds being produced from 244Pu and 34S. Each team proposed its own name for element 110: the American team proposed hahnium after Otto Hahn in an attempt to resolve the situation on element 105 (which they had long been suggesting this name for), the Soviet team proposed becquerelium after Henri Becquerel, and the German team proposed <b>darmstadtium</b> after Darmstadt, the location of their institute. The IUPAC/IUPAP Joint Working Party (JWP) recognised the GSI team as discoverers in their 2001 report, giving them the right to suggest a name for the element.|$|E
5|$|Prediction of the {{probable}} chemical properties of meitnerium {{has not received}} much attention recently. Meitnerium {{is expected to be}} a noble metal. Based on the most stable oxidation states of the lighter group 9 elements, the most stable oxidation states of meitnerium are predicted to be the +6, +3, and +1 states, with the +3 state being the most stable in aqueous solutions. In comparison, rhodium and iridium show a maximum oxidation state of +6, while the most stable states are +4 and +3 for iridium and +3 for rhodium. The oxidation state +9, represented only by iridium in +, might be possible for its congener meitnerium in the nonafluoride (MtF9) and the + cation, although + is expected to be more stable than these meitnerium compounds. The tetrahalides of meitnerium have also been predicted to have similar stabilities to those of iridium, thus also allowing a stable +4 state. It is further expected that the maximum oxidation states of elements from bohrium (element 107) to <b>darmstadtium</b> (element 110) may be stable in the gas phase but not in aqueous solution.|$|E
25|$|Discoverers of some {{elements}} named them after {{their home country}} or city. Marie Curie named polonium after Poland; ruthenium, gallium, germanium, and lutetium {{were based on the}} Latin names for Russia, France, Germany, and Paris. Other elements are named after the place where they were discovered. Four elements, terbium, erbium, ytterbium, and yttrium were named after a Swedish village Ytterby, where ores containing them were extracted. Other elements named after places are magnesium (after Magnesia), strontium, scandium, europium, thulium (after an old Roman name for the far north of Scandinavia), holmium, copper (derived from Cyprus, where it was mined in the Roman era), hafnium, rhenium, americium, berkelium, californium, and <b>darmstadtium.</b>|$|E
500|$|Prediction of the {{probable}} chemical properties of <b>darmstadtium</b> {{has not received}} much attention recently. <b>Darmstadtium</b> {{is expected to be}} a noble metal. Based on the most stable oxidation states of the lighter group 10 elements, the most stable oxidation states of <b>darmstadtium</b> are predicted to be the +6, +4, and +2 states; however, the neutral state is predicted to be the most stable in aqueous solutions. In comparison, only palladium and platinum are known to show the maximum oxidation state in the group, +6, while the most stable states are +4 and +2 for both nickel and palladium. It is further expected that the maximum oxidation states of elements from bohrium (element 107) to <b>darmstadtium</b> (element 110) may be stable in the gas phase but not in aqueous solution. <b>Darmstadtium</b> hexafluoride (DsF6) is predicted to have very similar properties to its lighter homologue platinum hexafluoride (PtF6), having very similar electronic structures and ionization potentials. It is also expected to have the same octahedral molecular geometry as PtF6. Other predicted <b>darmstadtium</b> compounds are <b>darmstadtium</b> carbide (DsC) and <b>darmstadtium</b> tetrachloride (DsCl4), both of which are expected to behave like their lighter homologues. Unlike platinum, which preferentially forms a cyanide complex in its +2 oxidation state, Pt(CN)2, <b>darmstadtium</b> is expected to preferentially remain in its neutral state and form [...] instead, forming a strong Ds–C bond with some multiple bond character.|$|E
500|$|Unambiguous {{determination}} of the chemical characteristics of <b>darmstadtium</b> has yet to have been established due to the short half-lives of <b>darmstadtium</b> isotopes and {{a limited number of}} likely volatile compounds that could be studied on a very small scale. One of the few <b>darmstadtium</b> compounds that are likely to be sufficiently volatile is <b>darmstadtium</b> hexafluoride (...) , as its lighter homologue platinum hexafluoride (...) is volatile above 60°C and therefore the analogous compound of <b>darmstadtium</b> might also be sufficiently volatile; a volatile octafluoride (...) might also be possible. For chemical studies to be carried out on a transactinide, at least four atoms must be produced, the half-life of the isotope used must be at least 1second, and the rate of production must be at least one atom per week. Even though the half-life of 281Ds, the most stable confirmed <b>darmstadtium</b> isotope, is 11seconds, long enough to perform chemical studies, another obstacle is the need to increase the rate of production of <b>darmstadtium</b> isotopes and allow experiments to carry on for weeks or months so that statistically significant results can be obtained. Separation and detection must be carried out continuously to separate out the <b>darmstadtium</b> isotopes and have automated systems experiment on the gas-phase and solution chemistry of <b>darmstadtium,</b> as the yields for heavier elements are predicted to be smaller than those for lighter elements; some of the separation techniques used for bohrium and hassium could be reused. However, the experimental chemistry of <b>darmstadtium</b> has not received as much attention as that of the heavier elements from copernicium to livermorium.|$|E
500|$|All <b>darmstadtium</b> {{isotopes}} {{are extremely}} unstable and radioactive; in general, the heavier isotopes are {{more stable than}} the lighter. The most stable known <b>darmstadtium</b> isotope, 281Ds, is also the heaviest known <b>darmstadtium</b> isotope; it has a half-life of 11seconds. The isotope 279Ds has a half-life of 0.18seconds respectively. The remaining six isotopes and two metastable states have half-lives between 1microsecond and 70milliseconds. Some unknown isotopes in this region, such as 272Ds and 274–276Ds, are predicted to also have rather long half-lives of a few seconds. Before its discovery, 277Ds was predicted to have a half-life of around 5seconds, but it has since {{been found to have}} a half-life of only 5.7milliseconds. Likewise, while 280Ds was originally predicted to have a half-life of about 11seconds, more recent work that may have detected it as the electron-capture daughter of 280Rg, have found for it a half-life of much less than a second, and a later 2016 study finding it as the possible alpha daughter of 284Cn found a half-life of about 6.7ms.Ca + 248Cm → 296Lv* at RIKEN-GARIS |journal=Journal of the Physical Society of Japan |volume=86 |pages=034201-1–7 |doi=10.7566/JPSJ.86.034201 |bibcode=2017JPSJ...86c4201K }} ...|$|E
500|$|<b>Darmstadtium</b> {{was first}} created on November 9, 1994, at the Institute for Heavy Ion Research (Gesellschaft für Schwerionenforschung, GSI) in Darmstadt, Germany, by Peter Armbruster and Gottfried Münzenberg, under the {{direction}} of Sigurd Hofmann.

500|$|Using Mendeleev's {{nomenclature}} for unnamed and undiscovered elements, <b>darmstadtium</b> {{should be}} known as eka-platinum. In 1979, IUPAC published recommendations according to which the element was to be called ununnilium (with the corresponding symbol of Uun), a systematic element name as a placeholder, until the element was discovered (and the discovery then confirmed) and a permanent name was decided on. Although widely used in the chemical community on all levels, from chemistry classrooms to advanced textbooks, the recommendations were mostly ignored among scientists in the field, who called it [...] "element 110", with the symbol of E110, (110) or even simply 110.|$|E
500|$|The {{probable}} {{chemistry of}} roentgenium {{has received more}} interest {{than that of the}} two previous elements, meitnerium and <b>darmstadtium,</b> as the valence s-subshells of the group 11 elements are expected to be relativistically contracted most strongly at roentgenium. Calculations on the molecular compound RgH show that relativistic effects double the strength of the roentgenium–hydrogen bond, even though spin–orbit interactions also weaken it by [...] The compounds AuX and RgX, where X = F, Cl, Br, O, Au, or Rg, were also studied. Rg+ is predicted to be the softest metal ion, even softer than Au+, although there is disagreement on whether it would behave as an acid or a base. In aqueous solution, Rg+ would form the aqua ion +, with an Rg–O bond distance of 207.1pm. It is also expected to form Rg(I) complexes with ammonia, phosphine, and hydrogen sulfide.|$|E
500|$|According to calculations, 108 is a proton {{magic number}} for {{deformed}} nuclei (nuclei {{that are far}} from spherical), and 162 is a neutron magic number for deformed nuclei. This means that such nuclei are permanently deformed in their ground state but have high, narrow fission barriers to further deformation and hence relatively long life-times to spontaneous fission. The spontaneous fission half-lives in this region are typically reduced {{by a factor of}} 109 in comparison with those {{in the vicinity of the}} spherical doubly magic nucleus 298Fl, caused by the narrower fission barrier for such deformed nuclei. Hence, the nucleus 270Hs has promise as a deformed doubly magic nucleus. Experimental data from the decay of the <b>darmstadtium</b> (Z=110) isotopes 271Ds and 273Ds provides strong evidence for the magic nature of the N=162 sub-shell. The recent synthesis of 269Hs, 270Hs, and 271Hs also fully support the assignment of N=162 as a magic number. In particular, the low decay energy for 270Hs is in complete agreement with calculations.270Hs162|journal=Physical Review Letters|volume=97|date=2006|doi=10.1103/PhysRevLett.97.242501|pmid=17280272|bibcode=2006PhRvL..97x2501D|issue=24|pages=242501|display-authors=8}} ...|$|E
500|$|The {{physical}} {{basis of}} the chemical periodicity governing the periodic table is the electron shell closures at each noble gas (atomic numbers 2, 10, 18, 36, 54, 86, and 118): as any further electrons must enter a new shell with higher energy, closed-shell electron configurations are markedly more stable, leading to the relative inertness of the noble gases. Since protons and neutrons are also known to arrange themselves in closed nuclear shells, the same effect happens at nucleon shell closures, which happen at specific nucleon numbers often dubbed [...] "magic numbers". The known magic numbers are 2, 8, 20, 28, 50, and 82 for protons and neutrons, and also 126 for neutrons. Nucleons with magic proton and neutron numbers, such as helium-4, oxygen-16, calcium-48, and lead-208, are termed [...] "doubly magic" [...] and are very stable against decay. This property of increased nuclear stability {{is very important for}} superheavy elements: without any stabilization, their half-lives would be expected by exponential extrapolation to be in the range of nanoseconds (10−9s) when element 110 (<b>darmstadtium)</b> is reached, because of the ever-increasing repulsive electromagnetic forces between the positively charged protons that overcome the limited-range strong nuclear force that holds the nucleus together. The next closed nucleon shells and hence magic numbers are thought to be at the centre of the long-sought island of stability, where the half-lives to alpha decay and spontaneous fission lengthen again.|$|E
