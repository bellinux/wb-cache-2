50|$|In human sexuality, the {{refractory}} period {{is usually the}} recovery phase after orgasm during which it is physiologically impossible {{for a man to}} have additional orgasms due to increase in the penile sensory threshold (PST).

50|$|Women {{are able}} to achieve {{multiple}} orgasms {{due to the fact}} that they generally do not require a refractory period like men do after the first orgasm; though generally reported that women do not <b>experience</b> <b>a</b> refractory period and thus can <b>experience</b> <b>an</b> additional orgasm, or multiple orgasms, soon after the first orgasm, some sources state that both men and women <b>experience</b> <b>a</b> refractory period because, due to clitoral hypersensitivity or sexual satisfaction, women may also <b>experience</b> <b>a</b> period after orgasm in which further sexual stimulation does not produce excitement.|$|R

5|$|Between {{the late}} eighteenth and early nineteenth centuries, Cumaná <b>experienced</b> <b>an</b> {{increase}} in population.

This manifested itself in the construction of new housing and the 1960s rebuilding of the town centre. However, during the 1970s employment at Broadheath declined by nearly 40per cent.|$|E
40|$|This {{research}} {{examines how}} media-induced consumer activation level affects consumer response to highly energetic commercials. Over six studies, including a Hulu field experiment, the authors report that consumers who are <b>experiencing</b> <b>a</b> deactivating emotion (e. g., sadness induced by a movie) {{find it more}} difficult to watch highly energetic commercials compared with consumers who are not <b>experiencing</b> <b>a</b> deactivating emotion. As <b>a</b> result, consumers <b>experiencing</b> <b>a</b> deactivating emotion are less likely to watch highly energetic commercials and recall the advertiser compared with consumers who are not <b>experiencing</b> <b>a</b> deactivating emotion. The authors do not observe these effects when consumers <b>experiencing</b> <b>a</b> deactivating emotion watch commercials that are moderately energetic or when consumers do not <b>experience</b> <b>a</b> deactivating emotion. These findings suggest that when advertisers run commercials in a media context that induces a deactivating emotion (e. g., sadness, relaxation, contentment), they should avoid running highly energetic commercials (e. g., with upbeat, enthusiastic spokespeople). In addition, this research recommends that when advertisers are unable to determine the emotions induced by the media context, they should run commercials that are moderate in energy. The results of a metaanalysis across the present studies show that consumers <b>experiencing</b> <b>a</b> deactivating emotion will respond as much as 50 % more favorably to moderately energetic commercials compared with highly energetic commercials...|$|R

5|$|In 1913 the brothel was {{expanded}} again.

The Dumas also <b>experienced</b> <b>an</b> upswing in patronage. As a result of the added patronage, the brothel added five partitions and a staircase in 1916, and the ground floor, once a grand parlor, was partitioned into cribs.|$|E
