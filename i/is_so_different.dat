25|$|Perennial rice are {{varieties}} of long-lived rice that {{are capable of}} regrowing season after season without reseeding; they are being developed by plant geneticists at several institutions. Although these varieties are genetically distinct and will be adapted for different climates and cropping systems, their lifespan <b>is</b> <b>so</b> <b>different</b> from other kinds of rice that they are collectively called perennial rice. Perennial rice—like many other perennial plantscan spread by horizontal stems below or just above the surface of the soil but they also reproduce sexually by producing flowers, pollen and seeds.

500|$|Alfred Pollard termed {{some of the}} pre-1623 {{versions}} as [...] "bad quartos" [...] {{because of}} their adapted, paraphrased or garbled texts, which may in places have been reconstructed from memory. Where several versions of a play survive, each differs from the other. The differences may stem from copying or printing errors, from notes by actors or audience members, or from Shakespeare's own papers. In some cases, for example, Hamlet, Troilus and Cressida, and Othello, Shakespeare could have revised the texts between the quarto and folio editions. In the case of King Lear, however, while most modern editions do conflate them, the 1623 folio version <b>is</b> <b>so</b> <b>different</b> from the 1608 quarto that the Oxford Shakespeare prints them both, arguing that they cannot be conflated without confusion.|$|E
500|$|The {{sea otter}} is the {{heaviest}} (the giant otter is longer, but significantly slimmer) {{member of the}} family Mustelidae, a diverse group that includes the 13 otter species and terrestrial animals such as weasels, badgers, and minks.

The only member of the genus Enhydra, the sea otter <b>is</b> <b>so</b> <b>different</b> from other mustelid species that, as recently as 1982, some scientists believed it was more closely related to the earless seals. Genetic analysis indicates the sea otter and its closest extant relatives, which include the African speckle-throated otter, European otter, African clawless otter and oriental small-clawed otter, shared an ancestor approximately 5 million years ago (Mya).|$|E

500|$|In a 1995 interview, Guitar World writer Jeff Gilbert {{described}} Vitalogy as [...] "strange" [...] and [...] "very eclectic." [...] McCready agreed, saying, [...] "There is {{some weird}} stuff on there." [...] McCready attributed the album's sound {{to the group}} recording it on tour. During this period Vedder began to contribute in a large capacity as a guitarist. Gossard said, [...] "Vitalogy {{is the first one}} where Ed plays guitar and he wrote three to four songs. I remember thinking, 'This <b>is</b> <b>so</b> <b>different.</b> Is anyone going to like this?'...It had a more punk feel to it. Simple songs recorded really quickly." [...] The album has a notable lack of guitar solos compared with the band's first two albums. McCready said, [...] "Vitalogy is not really a 'solo' album. I don't think the songs demanded solos; {{it was more of a}} rhythmic album." ...|$|E

500|$|Unlike his sources, Shakespeare gives Banquo {{no role in}} the King's murder, {{making it}} a deed {{committed}} solely by Macbeth and his wife. Why Shakespeare's Banquo <b>is</b> <b>so</b> <b>different</b> from the character described by Holinshed and Boece is not known, though critics have proposed several possible explanations. First among them is the risk associated with portraying the king's ancestor as a murderer and conspirator in the plot to overthrow a rightful king, as well as the author's desire to flatter a powerful patron. But Shakespeare may also simply have altered Banquo's character because there was no dramatic need for another accomplice to the murder. There was, however, a need to provide a dramatic contrast to Macbeth; a role that many scholars argue is filled by Banquo. Similarly, when Jean de Schelandre wrote about Banquo in his Stuartide in 1611, he also changed the character by portraying him as a noble and honourable man—the critic D. W. Maskell describes him as [...] "...Schelandre's paragon of valour and virtue"—probably for reasons similar to Shakespeare's.|$|E
500|$|Tenar {{begins to}} {{question}} her beliefs {{when she hears}} Kossil defying the Nameless Ones, and sees {{that they do not}} punish her. She has a conversation with Penthe, her only friend, who expresses an [...] "unfaith" [...] in the divinity of the God-king. Though Tenar reacts to this with shock, the incident opens a new perspective to her. In her own thoughts, [...] "she felt as if she had looked up and suddenly seen a whole new planet hanging huge and populous right outside the window, an entirely strange world, one in which the gods did not matter." [...] Ged acts as a catalyst for this stream of thought, because he is completely alien to her; he is male, brown-skinned, and has a picture of the world <b>is</b> <b>so</b> <b>different</b> from Tenar's own. After speaking to him, she begins to wonder whether the Nameless Ones, despite their power, deserve her worship, and begins to lose faith in them and in all the things she has been taught. She expects to find only evil in Ged, according to what she has been taught; but instead she finds light and love, further challenging her belief.|$|E

500|$|Final Fantasy XIII Original Soundtrack is {{the soundtrack}} album of Final Fantasy XIII, {{containing}} {{all of the}} musical tracks from the game, and was composed and produced by Masashi Hamauzu. The soundtrack spans four discs and 85 tracks, covering a duration of 4:04:06. It was released on January 27, 2010 in Japan by Square Enix, bearing the catalog numbers SQEX-10183~6. The limited edition of the soundtrack included a bonus disc containing a radio drama written by novelist Jun Eishima. The radio drama does not include any music not already in the album. The album sold 16,000 copies the day of its release. It reached #3 on the Japanese Oricon charts, and remained on the charts for nine weeks. The soundtrack incorporates both orchestral and electronic music, sometimes within the same track. Almost two dozen of the tracks include vocal performances to some degree, {{the most of any}} Final Fantasy soundtrack to date. It does not include many of the mainstay tracks from previous games in the series such as Uematsu's [...] "Prelude" [...] and [...] "Main Theme", and its variation on his [...] "Chocobo", the only repeat track, <b>is</b> <b>so</b> <b>different</b> as to not credit him as the original composer in the album.|$|E
500|$|Her {{paintings}} of war subjects were just {{one aspect of}} Rix Nicholas's developing commitment to nationalist ideals and the heroic representation of Australia. At {{the time of her}} 1919 exhibition, Rix Nicholas had commented that she wished [...] "to show the people [...] what is possessed in a land of beauty where the colour scheme <b>is</b> <b>so</b> <b>different,</b> and which sent so many gallant men to the struggle for liberty". In this respect she was following {{in the tradition of the}} Heidelberg School and writers such as Henry Lawson and Banjo Paterson, who extolled the virtues of the bush and pioneer life. Accompanied by her friend Dorothy Richmond, Rix Nicholas set out to paint in rural New South Wales, beginning in Delegate, a small town on the border of New South Wales and Victoria. Here she created numerous works, including In Australia, His Land, and The Shearers. Other works from this period include The Three Sisters, Blue Mountains (1921–22), which is in the collection of the National Gallery of Australia. While Australian patriotic imagery and discourse of the period was very male-dominated, Rix Nicholas's portraits were frequently of women, such as in The Monaro Pioneer, The Magpie's Song and Motherhood.|$|E

However, when the actor starts {{to think he}} <b>is</b> <b>so</b> <b>different</b> from O'Malley, an awkward move can suggest otherwise. [...] "I was walking, doing a scene with Katherine Heigl. I finished my line with her, and then I walked straight into the light stand." [...] Critical of her affair with O'Malley, Knight's co-star Heigl explained: [...] "They really hurt somebody, and they didn't {{seem to be taking}} a lot of responsibility for it. I have a really hard time with that kind of thing. I'm maybe a little too black and white about it." [...] Speaking of O'Malley's relationship with Lexie, Rhimes offered her insight: [...] "I love them as friends. They make good friends. We all have that friend we met in school or the gym or somewhere – we just hit it off right away. And right away there was no pretense or airs. Just pure honesty. That's Lexie and George. They're really good friends and I can see the friendship evolving into something even greater."
