40|$|This paper {{considers}} a cellular {{system with a}} full-duplex base station and half-duplex users. The base station can activate one user in uplink or downlink (half-duplex mode), or two different users one in each direction simultaneously (full-duplex mode). Simultaneous transmissions in uplink and downlink causes self-interference at the base station and uplink-to-downlink interference at the downlink user. Although uplink-to-downlink interference is typically treated as noise, it is shown that successive interference decoding and cancellation (SIC mode) can lead to significant improvement in network utility, especially when user distribution is concentrated around a few hotspots. The proposed temporal fair user scheduling algorithm and corresponding power optimization utilizes full-duplex and SIC modes as well as <b>half-duplex</b> <b>transmissions</b> based on their impact on network utility.

40|$|Abstract — We {{investigate}} {{an architecture}} for multi-Gigabit outdoor mesh networks {{operating in the}} unlicensed 60 GHz “millimeter (mm) wave ” band. In this band, the use of narrow beams is essential for attaining the required link ranges in order to overcome the higher path loss at mm wave carrier frequencies. However, highly directional links make standard MAC methods for interference management, such as carrier sense multiple access, which rely on neighboring nodes hearing each other, become inapplicable. In this paper, we study {{the extent to which}} we can reduce, or even dispense with, interference management, by exploiting the reduction in interference due to the narrow beamwidths and the oxygen absorption characteristic of the 60 GHz band. We provide a probabilistic analysis of the interference incurred due to uncoordinated transmissions, and show that, for the parameters considered, the links in the network {{can be thought of as}} pseudo-wired. That is, interference can essentially be ignored in MAC design, and the challenge is to schedule <b>half-duplex</b> <b>transmissions</b> in the face of the “deafness” resulting from highly directional links.

40|$|The {{feasibility}} of practical in-band full-duplex radios {{has recently been}} demonstrated experimentally. One way to leverage full-duplex in a network setting is to enable three-node full-duplex, where a full- duplex access point (AP) transmits data to one node yet simultaneously receives data from another node. Such three-node full-duplex communication however introduces inter-client interference, directly impacting the full-duplex gain. It hence {{may not always be}} beneficial to enable three-node full-duplex transmissions. In this paper, we present a distributed full-duplex medium access control (MAC) protocol that allows an AP to adaptively switch between full-duplex and half-duplex modes. We formulate a model that determines the probabilities of full-duplex and half-duplex access so as to maximize the expected network throughput. A MAC protocol is further proposed to enable the AP and clients to contend for either full-duplex or <b>half-duplex</b> <b>transmissions</b> based on their assigned probabilities in a distributed way. Our evaluation shows that, by combining the advantages of centralized probabilistic scheduling and distributed random access, our design improves the overall throughput by 2. 70 x and 1. 53 x, on average, as compared to half-duplex 802. 11 and greedy downlink-uplink client pairing...|$|R

40|$|Abstract—We {{propose a}} {{time-division}} uplink transmission scheme that is applicable to future-generation cellular systems by introducing hybrid device-to-device (D 2 D) and infrastructure cooperation. Compared with existing frequency-division schemes, the proposed time-division scheme achieves {{the same or}} better spectral efficiency and outage performance with simpler signals and shorter decoding delay. These advantages come from sending a different message in each transmission block without block Markovity as in existing schemes. Using time-division, the pro-posed scheme divides each transmission frame into three phases with variable duration. The two user equipment units (UEs) partially exchange their information {{in the first two}} phases and then cooperatively transmit to the base station (BS) in the third phase. We further formulate the end-to-end outage probabilities, considering outages at both UEs and the BS. We analyze this outage performance in Rayleigh fading environment assuming full channel state information (CSI) at receivers and limited CSI at transmitters. Results show that user cooperation improves the achievable rate region even under <b>half-duplex</b> <b>transmission.</b> More-over, as the received SNR increases, this uplink cooperation signif-icantly reduces outage probabilities and achieves the full diversity order despite additional outages at the UEs.

40|$|Two of {{the major}} {{concerns}} in tactical military wire-less communication networks are covertness and throughput. Impulse Radio is an u!tra-wideband code division muhi-ple access (U WB- CDMA) technique being considered as the physical layer for future networks. Impulse radio exhibits low power spectral density and relatively high immunity to fading but suffers from relatively long acquisition times. In tradi-tional packet radio networks (PRNs), the physical layer link is terminated while scheduling <b>half-duplex</b> <b>transmissions</b> or {{in the absence of}} data packets. To re-estabiish physical!ayer links in an impulse radio system, signaling packets containing ezceptionaiiy tong acquisition headers transmitted at higher powers are required. Hence, to improve covertness in an im-puise radio based network, we propose a MAC layer scheme we call Sustained Link Networks (SLN) where the phys-ical layer links are maintained continuously. We develop a fuil-duplexing scheme which takes advantage of the low duty cycle nature of impulse radio to maintain physical layer links capable of supporting hi-directional data transfer. During the periods between data bursts, the physical layer links are main-tained by transmitting supplementary data at low bit rates and!OW power levels. We quantify the performance of an impulse radio receiver implementing the full-duplex scheme developed. We also present performance comparisons of an SLN based on impulse radio with traditional PRN variations implemented using impulse radio. ...|$|R

The main deterrent to employ full-duplex is the large self-interference (SI) from the simultaneous transmission and reception over the same frequency band. The SI is usually several orders of magnitude higher than the intended signal received from the other transmitter, because the later travels a longer distance than the former signal. Recent works have shown that, using different cancellation stages, the SI can be sufficiently suppressed to properly detect the intended signal [1, 2].|$|E

40|$|In this paper, we {{consider}} an orthogonal frequency {{division multiple access}} multi-user cellular system with one full-duplex base station communicating with multiple half-duplex users in a bidirectional way. The uplink and downlink transmissions are coupled together because {{of the existence of}} the self-interference at the base station and the inter-user interference (IUI) from the uplink users to the downlink users. We aim to maximize the system sum-rate of uplink and downlink transmissions by optimally pairing the uplink and downlink users and allocating the subcarriers and powers to these users. We formulate the problem as a mixed integer nonlinear programming problem. A two-layer iterative solution based on the dual method and the sequential parametric convex approximation (SPCA) method is proposed. It {{is referred to as the}} dual-SPCA algorithm. The dual-SPCA algorithm requires the IUI channel state information to be available at the base station, and hence, a significant overhead is generated. To reduce the amount of overhead required, we assume that the IUI channel model is known at the base station, and we design a location-aware resource allocation algorithm with limited channel state information that maximizes the system sum-rate. Simulation results show that when self-interference is low, uplink and downlink user-pairing can provide significant improvement on the system sum-rate compared with the conventional unidirectional <b>half-duplex</b> <b>transmission.</b> In addition, by considering two different network deployments, such as urban macro cell scenario and small cell scenario, we show that the improvement of full-duplex transmission over <b>half-duplex</b> <b>transmission</b> highly depends on the channel parameters.
