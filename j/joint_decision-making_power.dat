40|$|This paper reports {{results of}} an {{experiment}} designed to analyze the link between risky decisions made by couples and risky decisions made separately by each spouse. We estimate both the spouses and the couples’ degrees of risk aversion and we assess how the risk preferences of the two spouses aggregate when they make risky decisions. This enables us to investigate the decision process that takes place when couples make risky decisions. We find that in most couples men have more <b>decision-making</b> <b>power</b> than women and that women’s <b>decision-making</b> <b>power</b> increases when they ultimately implement the <b>joint</b> decisions.

We show that Brazil’s Bolsa Família program has significant impacts on women’s decision making, but with considerable heterogeneity in effects. In aggregate, Bolsa Família significantly increases women’s <b>decision-making</b> <b>power</b> regarding contraception. This effect {{is driven by}} urban households, in which Bolsa Família also significantly increases women’s <b>decision-making</b> <b>power</b> in spheres related to children’s school attendance and health expenses, household durable goods purchases, and contraception use.

30|$|Compared {{with the}} {{traditional}} image hashing concept, the superiority of content-based fingerprint concept lies in its potential high discriminating capability, better robustness, and multilayer security arising from the combination of various robust feature descriptors and a <b>joint</b> <b>decision-making</b> process. Same as in any information fusion processes, theoretically the discrimination capability of the content-based fingerprinting with effective <b>joint</b> <b>decision-making</b> scheme should outperform a single image hashing. Since the content-based fingerprint consists of several hash vectors, which are generated based on various robust features and different secret keys, {{it is argued that}} the framework of content-based fingerprinting results in a better robustness and multilayer security when an efficient <b>joint</b> <b>decision-making</b> is available. However, combining multiple image hashes approaches requires additional computation cost for the generation of content-based fingerprinting. The tradeoff between computation cost and performance is a concern with great importance in practice.|$|R

40|$|This article {{concerns}} {{the governance of}} the World Bank (WB) and tries to determine if it grants the <b>decision-making</b> <b>power</b> to Most Developed Countries (MDC) of the OECD. First of all, we demonstrate that these countries have effectively the <b>decision-making</b> <b>power</b> within three authorities of decision of the Bank. They are so capable of determining on their own the allocation of WB lending and conditionality. In this way, our study {{contributes to the literature}} relative to the governance of the international financial institutions (IFI) by wondering about the concrete implications of the distribution of votes within the WB. In a second time, we show that several characteristics of the governance of the WB, allow to maintain and to strengthen the power of the MDC (OECD) within the institution. The interest {{of this study is to}} show that if, not only the system of vote of the WB in proportion to the financial contributions is actually widely favourable to the MDC (OEDC), moreover, the formal rules of governance grant them the <b>decision-making</b> <b>power</b> within three authorities of decision of the Bank. This study joins in the debate concernig the legitimacy of the World Bank.

40|$|Background: Research {{suggests}} that women of reproductive age {{who are involved}} in household decision-making are more likely than those who are not involved to be able to control their fertility. Little is known, however, about this relationship among women at {{the upper end of the}} reproductive spectrum. The aim of this study was to determine the association between household <b>decision-making</b> <b>power</b> and modern contraceptive use among Nigerian women ages 35 – 49 years. Methods: A descriptive, cross-sectional study involving a secondary analysis of data from the Nigerian 2008 Demographic and Health Survey was conducted among women ages 35 – 49 years who were considered to be in need of contraception. The outcome was modern contraceptive use while the main independent variable was a woman’s household <b>decision-making</b> <b>power</b> score, constructed using principal component analysis. Multivariate logistic regression was performed to determine whether the women’s household <b>decision-making</b> <b>power</b> score, categorized into tertiles, was independently associated with modern contraceptive use. Data were weighted and adjusted for the complex survey design. Results: Prevalence of modern contraceptive use among Nigerian women deemed to be in need of contraception in this study was 18. 7 %. Multivariate logistic regression showed that women’s <b>decision-making</b> <b>power</b> remained statistically significantly associated with modern contraceptive use, even after adjusting for age, education, religion, polygyny, parity, wealth and domicile.

40|$|Numerous non-state {{certification}} {{initiatives have}} emerged and consolidated {{in the past}} 20 years to address social and environmental problems associated with production practices in several economic sectors. These programs embody the idea that information disclosure can, in part, be a tool for NGOs, investors, governments, and consumers to differentiate {{between high and low}} performers, and hence, advocates hope, place upward pressure on sector-wide performance. Beyond this simple appraisal, however, there remain many unanswered questions concerning how information disclosure is handled across programs and within programs across involved actors and across geographic regions of the world. With this gap as a point of departure, we examine non-state certification programs in fishery and forest sectors to explore the relationship between how much <b>decision-making</b> <b>power</b> is granted to stakeholders and the attention these stakeholders pay to concerns for transparency. The analysis highlights an important asymmetry between transparency and provisions for <b>decision-making</b> <b>power.</b> While granting stakeholders <b>decision-making</b> <b>power</b> inevitably gives them access to information, the disclosure of information need not come with provisions for <b>decision-making</b> <b>power.</b> Recognizing this asymmetry underlines how assessing transparency alone can miss critical issues of authority and power that ultimately shape the evolution and effectiveness of non-state certification...|$|R

The relationship between the allocation of <b>decision-making</b> <b>power</b> within organization and new product development (NPD) speed is investigated empirically using Chinese data. The results of correlation analysis show that horizontal integration is the key factor to influence NPD speed. Meanwhile, the results of regression analysis indicate that whether operational decentralization can accelerate NPD or not, rests with the degree of horizontal integration and the type of <b>decision-making</b> <b>power.</b> With the leverage effect from centralization and the agility from decentralization to gain competitive advantage, this research can provide a direct reference for managers to configure <b>decision-making</b> <b>power</b> in workplace effectively and neatly.

40|$|This paper aims to help {{supply chain}} {{managers}} {{to determine the}} value of retailer-supplier partnership initiatives beyond information sharing (IS) according to their specific business environment under time-varying demand conditions. For this purpose, we use integer linear programming models to quantify the benefits that can be accrued by a retailer, a supplier and {{system as a whole}} from shift in inventory ownership and shift in <b>decision-making</b> <b>power</b> with that of IS. The results of a detailed numerical study pertaining to static time horizon reveal that the shift in inventory ownership provides system-wide cost benefits in specific settings. Particularly, when it induces the retailer to order larger quantities and the supplier also prefers such orders due to significantly high setup and shipment costs. We observe that the relative benefits of shift in <b>decision-making</b> <b>power</b> are always higher than the shift in inventory ownership under all the conditions. The value of the shift in <b>decision-making</b> <b>power</b> is greater than IS particularly when the variability of underlying demand is low and time-dependent variation in production cost is high. However, when the shipment cost is negligible and order issuing efficiency of the supplier is low, the cost benefits of shift in <b>decision-making</b> <b>power</b> beyond IS are not significant...|$|R
