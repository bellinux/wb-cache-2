5|$|The Convair F2Y Sea Dart was an American {{seaplane}} fighter {{aircraft that}} rode on twin hydro-skis for takeoff. It flew {{only as a}} prototype, and never entered mass production. It is the only seaplane to <b>have</b> <b>exceeded</b> the speed of sound.|$|E
5|$|Most studies {{consider}} dinosaurs as endothermic (warm-blooded) animals, with {{an elevated}} metabolism {{comparable to that}} of today's mammals and birds. In a 2009 study, Herman Pontzer and colleagues calculated the aerobic endurance of various dinosaurs. Even at moderate running speeds, Heterodontosaurus would <b>have</b> <b>exceeded</b> the maximum aerobic capabilities possible for an ectotherm (cold-blooded) animal, indicating endothermy in this genus.|$|E

5|$|The Crown Estate {{is one of}} {{the largest}} {{property}} owners in the United Kingdom, with holdings of £7.3billion in 2011. It is held in trust, and cannot be sold or owned by the Sovereign in a private capacity. In modern times, the profits surrendered from the Crown Estate to the Treasury <b>have</b> <b>exceeded</b> the Civil List and Grants-in-Aid. For example, the Crown Estate produced £200million in the financial year 2007–8, whereas reported parliamentary funding for the monarch was £40million during the same period.|$|E
5|$|The {{film was}} {{released}} on December 20, 2006, thirty years after release of Rocky (1976), by Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer, Columbia Pictures and Revolution Studios, and exceeded box office expectations with a mainly positive critical reaction.

5|$|The low {{turnout was}} {{attributed}} {{in part to}} poor voter registry maintenance. The registry allegedly contains up to 900,000 nonexistent voters due to poor database maintenance, especially in updating the registry using death certificates and change of residence records. This allegation {{was supported by the}} 2011 census. The poor voter records were subsequently cited as the cause of the low formal turnout, which would otherwise <b>have</b> <b>exceeded</b> 50%. It was later estimated that the actual turnout in Croatia itself, without the diaspora, was 61%.|$|E

5|$|From {{the time}} of his {{conversion}} in 1625 onwards, Baltimore took care to cater for the religious needs of his colonists, both Catholic and Protestant. He had asked Simon Stock to provide priests for the 1625 expedition, but Stock's recruits arrived in England after Aston had sailed. Stock's own ambitions for the colony appear to <b>have</b> <b>exceeded</b> Baltimore's: in letters to De Propaganda Fide in Rome, Stock claimed the Newfoundland settlement could act as a springboard for the conversion of natives not only in the New World but also in China, the latter via a passage he believed existed from the east coast to the Pacific Ocean.|$|E
5|$|In nearby Haiti, {{the damage}} from the {{hurricane}} was catastrophic as torrential rains, reported to <b>have</b> <b>exceeded</b> , triggered widespread flooding and landslides throughout the country. Initial reports from Haiti were slow to reach the news media as most roads were flooded or destroyed. Several days after the hurricane's passage, reports began to indicate that immense damage had taken place due to the storm. The city of Gonaïves was completely flooded after a nearby river overflowed its banks. Residents sought safety from the flood waters in the upper floors and roofs of their homes. Sixteen {{people were killed in}} the city after a bridge was destroyed by the swollen river. The Tonazeau River near Port-au-Prince also topped its banks, inundating nearby areas.|$|E
5|$|Indonesia {{possesses}} 673 {{airports in}} 2013, ranging from grand international airports to modest unpaved airstrips on remote islands or inland interior areas located throughout the archipelago. In November 2011, Indonesia {{had more than}} 230 conventional airports, most of them operated by Transportation Ministry technical operation units and state-owned PT Angkasa Pura I & II. Major airports are managed by Angkasa Pura; Angkasa Pura I operates 13 airports in Eastern Indonesia, while Angkasa Pura II operates 13 airports in Western Indonesia. After the 2000 aviation deregulation, Indonesian airports endured a surge of passengers, especially catalyzed by the advent of low-cost carriers. According to the Indonesian Transportation Ministry, 9 of the 13 airports managed by PT Angkasa Pura I <b>have</b> <b>exceeded</b> their passenger capacity.|$|E

5|$|Josephine {{also caused}} major effects to marine interests. High waves, {{estimated}} to <b>have</b> <b>exceeded</b> 15ft (4.6m), disabled a sailboat {{with a crew}} of six on it. They were quickly rescued after issuing a distress signal to a nearby tanker vessel. The storm caused the loss of 1,799bags of sorghum from water damage when a freighter encountered Josephine en route to Baltimore, Maryland. The major shipping lanes of North America were severely impacted, with more than 25 ships reporting winds of at least 58mph (93km/h) {{over a period of}} nine days. Furthermore, at least five of those ships reported hurricane force winds during a period of six days. The highest wind speed reported from a ship was 92mph (148km/h), which was observed on October16.|$|E
5|$|Several {{managers}} {{have won the}} award in a season when they led their team to 100 or more wins. Lou Piniella won 116 games with the Seattle Mariners in 2001, the most by a winning manager, and Joe Torre won 114 with the New York Yankees in 1998. Sparky Anderson and Tony La Russa finished with identical 104–58 records in 1984 and 1988, respectively. Three National League managers, including Dusty Baker, Whitey Herzog, and Larry Dierker, <b>have</b> <b>exceeded</b> the century mark as well. Baker's San Francisco Giants won 103 games in 1993; Dierker's 1998 Houston Astros won 102 and Herzog led the Cardinals to 101 wins in the award's third season.|$|E
5|$|The Proclamation of Dušan's Law Codex {{was well}} {{received}} by the Serbian public, and is said to <b>have</b> <b>exceeded</b> the expectations of all the government ministers. It was also well received in France, where Jovanović was named an Officer of the Académie des Beaux-Arts. The painting was met with critical acclaim at the world's fair, and the fair's artistic committee awarded Jovanović a gold medal for his work. By way of this decision, the art historian Jelena Milojković-Djurić asserts, the Paris committee recognized that the painting was on par {{with those of the}} world's best visual artists.|$|E

5|$|The {{memorial}} {{takes the}} form of a Tuscan column of Purbeck Marble construction, on which stands a statue of Saint George slaying a dragon. Lady Horner first hoped to have an original sculpture and approached several artists but all quotes she received would <b>have</b> <b>exceeded</b> the village's budget, so she instead commissioned a copy of a statue in the Henry VII Chapel in Westminster Abbey. The column stands on a tall, narrow pedestal in Portland stone that bears the inscription: , a verse suggested by Robert Bridges, the poet laureate, in correspondence with Lady Horner. A cross is engraved immediately above.|$|E
5|$|The size of Chnodomar's cavalry is unknown, but was {{probably}} {{a small proportion of}} the total, as the Alamanni's heavily forested land was not suited to large-scale cavalry operations. Most of the Alamanni horsemen were noblemen and their retainers, as only they could afford to keep a warhorse. Chnodomar's cavalry is unlikely to <b>have</b> <b>exceeded</b> 1,750 horse in total, assuming that the cavalry element was similar to the 7% cavalry element in the early Roman citizen legion, as the latter was also recruited exclusively from the wealthiest classes.|$|E
5|$|The tail of Sauropelta was {{characteristically}} {{long and}} made up {{nearly half of the}} body length. One skeleton preserved forty caudal (tail) vertebrae, although some were missing, suggesting that the true number of caudal vertebrae may <b>have</b> <b>exceeded</b> fifty. Ossified tendons stiffened the tail along its length. Like other ankylosaurs, Sauropelta had a wide body, with a very broad pelvis and ribcage. The forelimbs were shorter than the hindlimbs, which resulted in an arched back, with the highest point over the hips. Its feet, limbs, shoulders, and pelvis were all very stoutly constructed and reinforced to support a great deal of weight. American paleontologist Ken Carpenter estimated the mass of S. edwardsorum at 1,500kilograms (3,300lb).|$|E

5|$|Throughout its existence, the {{hurricane}} remained relatively close to land, so consequently its effects were felt in many areas. Much {{of the northern}} Caribbean received moderate to heavy rainfall along with gusty winds during its passage; although only Haiti reported damage from it. Its effects were far more severe in Mexico where an estimated 4,000 people were killed by record-breaking floods triggered by {{the hurricane}}. The city of Monterrey received the worst damage: {{more than half of}} the structures in the city were flooded, hundreds were destroyed, and 20,000 people were left homeless. Damage from the storm in the country was estimated to <b>have</b> <b>exceeded</b> $50million (1909USD; $ USD).|$|E
5|$|An {{extensive}} {{review of}} these theories (excepting that of Preston) {{is given in}} Jurens's 1987 article. Its main conclusion is that the loss was almost certainly precipitated by the explosion of a 4-inch magazine, but that {{there are several ways}} this could have been initiated, although he rules out the boat deck fire or the detonation of her torpedoes as probable causes. In Jurens's opinion, the popular image of plunging shells penetrating Hoods deck armour is inaccurate, as by his estimation the angle of fall of Bismarcks 15-inch shells at the moment of the loss would not <b>have</b> <b>exceeded</b> about 14°, an angle so unfavourable to penetration of horizontal armour that it is actually off the scale of contemporaneous German penetration charts. Moreover, computer-generated profiles of Hood show that a shell falling at this angle could not have reached an aft magazine without first passing through some part of the belt armour. On the other hand, the 12-inch belt could have been penetrated, if Hood had progressed sufficiently far into her final turn.|$|E
5|$|As {{it moved}} inland, however, Alice {{produced}} prolific rains along {{and near the}} Rio Grande, resulting {{in some of the}} worst flooding ever seen in parts of northern Mexico and southern Texas; in some areas, the flooding amounted to a one-in-1,000-year event. The Pecos River crested at , which joined with the Rio Grande to produce significant flooding. The floods destroyed bridges and dikes and flooded many cities along the inner reaches of the river, which reached its highest water levels since 1865. As the river overflowed its banks, floods breached the dikes at Piedras Negras, Coahuila, destroying large sections of the town. Other communities in Mexico reported significant flood damage. In the United States, damage was heaviest in Ozona, Texas, where the floods killed 15people and caused $2million in damage (1954USD). Rainfall peaked at over , most of which fell in a 24‑hour period. In all, flooding from Hurricane Alice killed at least 55 people, including 17 in the U.S. and 38 in Mexico, though many deaths in rural Mexico may have gone unreported; the total death toll could <b>have</b> <b>exceeded</b> 150.|$|E
