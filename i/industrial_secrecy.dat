50|$|The {{main problem}} with speckle tracking, however, is {{increasingly}} recognised: The lack of standardisation. Each vendor of ultrasound equipment, or analysis software, has different algorithms, that will perform differently during analysis. In {{head to head}} comparisons, biases between analysis may be substantial, especially when compared to an external reference. Thus, measurements, normal limits and cut off values are only vendor specific. Due to <b>industrial</b> <b>secrecy,</b> {{the details of the}} different algorithms may also be largely unavailable, so a detailed investigation in modelling is difficult.|$|E

It was utilized the strategy of multiple case study. It was researched two companies selected by convenience among the associates from Brazilian Association of Biotechnology Companies- ABRABI. In each company it was performed interviews with keyexecutives. The questionnaire for interviews was based on previous works. Interviews were recorded and transcribed and the data analysis was made by the categorical thematic content analysis technique with categories defined a priori. Cases were individually and crosslly analyzed, aiming to characterize the constructs of interest and theirrelationship. Among main results, it is noteworthy that the sector ismunificent and provides many opportunities, although their exploitation is restricted by the delay in the authorization process by Brazilian regulatory agencies of new - product releases or current- manufacturing - process adaptations. This fact creates environmental hostility, stimulating the imitation among companies.

40|$|This thesis {{investigates the}} {{development}} of an animatronic robot with the objective of showing how modern animatronic models created as special effects have roots in models created during the scientific and mechanical revolution of the 17 th and 18 th centuries. It is noted that animatronic models that are available today have not been described in any great detail and most are covered by <b>industrial</b> <b>secrecy.</b> This project utilises technologies developed during {{the latter part of the}} 20 th century and into the beginning of the 21 st century to create the design of the animatronic robot. The objective of the project is to bring effective designs for animatronic robots into the public domain. The project will investigate a large variety of different mechanisms and apply them to various functioning parts of the model, with the design and method of each of these functions discussed. From this, one main part of the project, the jaw, will receive the focus of construction. Once the construction is complete this will be evaluated against what improvements and changes could be made for future iterations, with a revised design produced based on what has been learned.

40|$|An {{accelerating}} {{increase in}} linear programming applications to industrial problems {{has made it}} virtually impossible to keep abreast of them, {{not only because of}} their number (and diversity) but also because of the conditions under which many are carried out. <b>Industrial</b> (and governmental) <b>secrecy</b> is often present. Other conditions also bar access to ascertainment and assessment of the pattern of applications. Lack of a tradition for publication is one. Failure to ascertain the general significance of particular findings is another, as is discouragement arising from the fact that similar applications have previously been published by others. Immediate remedies are not available for these difficulties. Presumably conventions such as this will help, over a period of time, by encouraging informal contacts between interested persons. A talk on "industrial applications of linear programming" must be altered to suit these circumstances. In place of a survey or evaluation of industrial studies, two broad issues which are relevant to all such applications will be discussed. These are, (1) use of linear programming models as guides to data collection and (2) analysis (and prognosis) of fruitful areas of additional research, especially those which appear to have been opened by industrial applications. ...|$|R
40|$|Achieving a high {{fill factor}} is a {{bottleneck}} problem for capturing high-quality images. There are {{hardware and software}} solutions to overcome this problem. In the solutions, the fill factor is known. However, this is an <b>industrial</b> <b>secrecy</b> by most image sensor manufacturers due to its direct effect on {{the assessment of the}} sensor quality. In this paper, we propose a method to estimate the fill factor of a camera sensor from an arbitrary single image. The virtual response function of the imaging process and sensor irradiance are estimated from the generation of virtual images. Then the global intensity values of the virtual images are obtained, which are the result of fusing the virtual images into a single, high dynamic range radiance map. A non-linear function is inferred from the original and global intensity values of the virtual images. The fill factor is estimated by the conditional minimum of the inferred function. The method is verified using images of two datasets. The results show that our method estimates the fill factor correctly with significant stability and accuracy from one single arbitrary image according to the low standard deviation of the estimated fill factors from each of images and for each camera. open access</p...|$|E
40|$|The {{accumulation}} of damage in compοsite materials of ceramic matrix under mechanic loading {{is a topic}} {{that has not been}} answered satisfactorily up to today. The most basic objective difficulty in this problem is the way of approach and determination of damage in compοsite materials as it is a multiparametric problem. The question of the way of monitoring the damage is also rised. Non destructive testing constitutes of a very good choice for the monitoring and the study of the development of damage. The basic aim of this work is the study of development of damage and the failure mechanisms in composite materials with the use of two different techniques of not destructive techniques (Acoustic Emission AE and Acousto-Ultrasonic AU) during the mechanical testing, as well as the development of quantitative indicators capable of monitoring the various levels of damage of the material. Particular accent is given in the signal processing methodologies for the signals that result from each technique. To this direction three types of woven C/C composite material were tested. The differentiation in type of material lies in the different interfacial properties that the manufacturer selected without further details (<b>industrial</b> <b>secrecy).</b> At the same time, from the results of the application of the different signal processing methodologies that resulted from each non destructive method, conclusions are attempted to be exported with regard to the way that the different interfacial qualities influence the mechanisms of {{accumulation of}} damage. More analytically the objectives that were sought in the frame of this thesis are as follows: • Implementation of specifically selected mechanical tests in the three types of the woven composite C/C materials, that give the ability of development of multiple level damage in the structure of materials • Use of non destructive methods as the acoustic emission (AE) and the acousto-ultrasonics (AU) for the monitoring of damage that is developed during the mechanical tests • Recognition of the material’s failure mechanisms after the processing of AE signals • Development and application of innovative techniques for the processing of AU signals based on the wavelet transform • Development of quantitative indicators for the monitoring of damage accumulation from the processing of AU signals • Export of conclusions on the way that the differentiation in the final interfacial properties influences the way of development and accumulation of damage in the under review materials...|$|E
40|$|This study {{provides}} {{a new understanding}} of the nature of Eastman Kodak Research. The thesis considers the European context between 1891 and 1912, before the creation of the first Kodak Research Laboratory in 1912 at Rochester, New York, and between 1928 and 1950 with the opening of two additional Research Laboratories in the United Kingdom and in France. It sheds light on the technological and organisational relationship between the main Kodak Research Laboratory in Rochester and the later, related, Kodak Research Laboratories in Europe. Analysis of publications from numerous independent photochemists demonstrates that <b>industrial</b> <b>secrecy</b> during the interwar years limited the sharing of scientific knowledge and delayed developments in photographic science. The first Kodak Research Laboratory was created in Rochester in 1912 to address this issue internally. Its first director, Kenneth Mees, developed an innovative organisational model which combined fundamental and applied research in order to protect scientific facts about the photographic process that were discovered in-house and to create the appropriate preconditions for the development of new and marketable products. Qualitative analysis of unpublished research reports stresses the multi-faceted nature of the photographic research undertaken at the Harrow Research Laboratory from 1929 onwards. It shows that the British Laboratory was open to external sources of scientific knowledge and innovative technologies. Photographic knowledge was shared significantly during the 1930 s between the American, British and French Research Laboratories and Production Departments, as also evidenced by the previously undiscovered personal notebooks of a number of photochemists. Analysis of the British and more recently uncovered French Kodak archives also reveals that long-term Kodak research about colour photography was interrelated with the European Kodak Research Laboratories during the interwar period. Original analyses of unpublished patent correspondence demonstrate that the editorial drafting of strategic patents during the Second World War was at the core of the scientific collaboration between Kodak Limited and independent inventors. This thesis concludes that the work of the European Kodak research laboratories was fundamental to Eastman Kodak in the twentieth century. Despite cultural disparities, the three laboratories followed an organisational model that promoted scientific collaboration. Furthermore, the modest size of Kodak Research in Europe during the early years forced the company to partially adopt an “Open Innovation” model, combining external sources of technology with in-house research. This is the first study to address the question of the European nature of Kodak Research using unpublished laboratory archives. It unveils the complete organisation of Kodak research, including knowledge transfer and scientific collaborations, as well as the actors in Kodak Research that marked the history of twentieth century photography...|$|E
40|$|Glass fibre {{reinforcements}} {{form the}} foundation of a composite materials industry with a global annual production of greater than 10 million tons of high performance, light weight carbon footprint lowering materials. Possibly the most critical component involved in the manufacture of glass fibres and their composites is the fibre sizing. Yet because of the intense level of <b>industrial</b> <b>secrecy</b> around sizings there are very few people in the vast chain of composite materials suppliers, processers and end users who have more than a superficial understanding of what glass fibre sizings are and what they do. There are many questions which this large and growing composite community poses about glass fibre sizings. Which analytical techniques are most useful in sizing research? Who has published research results on sizing and their ingredients? Which silanes are the most researched for use in sizings? Which glass fibre manufacturers have reported research findings on sizings? This review will act as a guide to obtaining some of the answers to these and many other questions about glass fibre sizings. The composites materials industry is currently experiencing a period of intense growth in new application development due to the potential which light-weight high performance composite materials have to reduce the carbon footprint of many industries. Composite materials have been highly successful in such applications due to the synergy of combining two, or more, dissimilar materials to obtain a better performance than the sum of the individual components. Glass fibre has been particularly successful as the reinforcement in these composites. Today glass fibre products account for more than 95 % of fibre reinforcements used in the composites industry, primarily due to their highly attractive performance to price ratio. Possibly the most critical component involved in the manufacture of glass fibres and their composites is the fibre sizing. Sizing is a thin surface coating of mainly organic materials applied to nearly all types of man-made fibres during their manufacture. Given the well-recognized critical importance of sizing in all aspects of the profitability, processibility and performance of glass reinforced composites and consequently to the ultimate success of the composites industry, it is surprising (perhaps even astonishing) to note the lack of a proportionally sized body of fundamental and applied research publications on this subject. There can be few examples of such a large materials industry (global annual production well in excess of 10 million tons of fibre reinforced composites) where the manufacturing and performance of those materials are so critically dependent on such a small component that is so narrowly understood. The research and development of glass fibre sizing is inextricably linked to the intellectual property concerns of glass fibre manufacturers and consequently information {{on the nature of the}} technical challenges facing sizing developers is not openly available to the technical community. Despite these challenges there has been quite some work published in and around the subject of glass fibre sizings over the years. Given the importance of sizings to the continuing success and growth of the composites industry this review has collected and summarized a large proportion of the widely dispersed literature which is openly available around glass fibre sizings. The review should beneficial to academic researchers embarking on, or already working on, fundamental research in the area of glass fibre sizings and interfaces in glass reinforced composites. However, industrial readers from the composite materials supply chain and those engaged with end-use applications using glass reinforced polymers should also find the contents highly useful in improving their insight and understanding of this critical aspect of composite materials...|$|E
