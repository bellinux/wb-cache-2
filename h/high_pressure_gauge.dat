40|$|In {{this article}} we present {{calculations}} which indicate that nanoshells {{can be used as}} a <b>high</b> <b>pressure</b> <b>gauge</b> in Diamond Anvil Cells (DACs). Nanoparticles have important advantages in comparison with the currently used ruby fluorescence gauge. Because of their small dimensions they can be spread uniformly over a diamond surface without bridging between the two diamond anvils. Furthermore their properties are measured by broad band optical transmission spectroscopy leading to a very large signal-to-noise ratio even in the multi-megabar pressure regime where ruby measurements become challenging. Finally their resonant frequencies can be tuned to lie in a convenient part of the visible spectrum accessible to CCD detectors. Theoretical calculations for a nanoshell with a SiO 2 core and a golden shell, using both the hybridization model and Mie theory, are presented here. The calculations for the nanoshell in vacuum predict that nanoshells can indeed have a measurable pressure-dependent optical response desirable for gauges. However when the nanoshells are placed in commonly used DAC pressure media, resonance peak positions as a function of pressure are no longer single-valued and depend on the pressure media, rendering them impractical as a pressure gauge. To overcome these problems an alternative nanoparticle is studied: coating the nanoshell with an extra dielectric layer (SiO 2) provides an easy way to shield the pressure gauge from the influence of the medium, leaving the compression of the particle due to the pressure as the main effect on the spectrum. We have analyzed the response to pressure up to 200 GPa. We conclude that a coated nanoshell could provide a new gauge for high-pressure measurements that has advantages over current methods.

50|$|The cell uses {{conventional}} piston and cylinder arrangement. The piston {{is placed}} in a thin elastic diaphragm. The piston doesn't actually {{come in contact with}} the load cell. Mechanical stops are placed to prevent over strain of the diaphragm when the loads exceed certain limit. The load cell is completely filled with oil. When the load is applied on the piston, the movement of the piston and the diaphragm results in an increase of oil pressure. This pressure is then transmitted to a hydraulic <b>pressure</b> <b>gauge</b> via a <b>high</b> <b>pressure</b> hose. The <b>gauge's</b> Bourdon tube senses the pressure and registers it on the dial. Because this sensor has no electrical components, it is ideal for use in hazardous areas. Typical hydraulic load cell applications include tank, bin, and hopper weighing. By example, a hydraulic load cell is immune to transient voltages (lightning) so these type of load cells might be a more effective device in outdoor environments. This technology is more expensive than other types of load cells. It is a more costly technology and thus cannot effectively compete on a cost of purchase basis.|$|R

40|$|Objectives: To {{evaluate}} {{the accuracy of}} three different cutoff points {{for the detection of}} <b>high</b> blood <b>pressure</b> in adolescents, given the strong relationship between overweight and <b>high</b> blood <b>pressure</b> levels. Methods: A total of 1, 021 adolescents of both sexes were enrolled in the study, selected at random from public and private schools in Londrina, Brazil.

50|$|Copper {{units of}} {{pressure}} or CUP, {{and the related}} lead units of pressure or LUP, are terms applied to pressure measurements used {{in the field of}} internal ballistics for the estimation of chamber pressures in firearms. These terms were adopted by convention to indicate that the pressure values were measured by copper crusher and lead crusher gauges respectively. In recent years, they have been replaced by the adoption of more modern piezoelectric <b>pressure</b> <b>gauges</b> that more accurately measure chamber pressures and generally give significantly <b>higher</b> <b>pressure</b> values. This nomenclature was adopted to avoid confusion and the potentially dangerous interchange of pressure values and standards made by different types of <b>pressure</b> <b>gauges.</b> <b>Pressure</b> is a fundamental thermodynamic parameter that is expressed in units of force divided by area. In the avoirdupois system, the units of pressure are pounds per square inch and in the metric system, the units or pressure are newtons per square meter (pascals).
