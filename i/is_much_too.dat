5|$|With {{erythromycin}} {{therapy in}} DPB, great reduction in bronchiolar inflammation and damage is achieved through suppression {{of not only}} neutrophil proliferation, but also lymphocyte activity and obstructive mucus and water secretions in airways. The antibiotic effects of macrolides {{are not involved in}} their beneficial effects toward reducing inflammation in DPB. This is evident because the treatment dosage <b>is</b> <b>much</b> <b>too</b> low to fight infection, and in DPB cases with the occurrence of macrolide-resistant P.aeruginosa, erythromycin therapy still reduces inflammation.|$|E
5|$|At {{its closest}} approach, the angular size of Mars is 25arcseconds (a unit of degree); this <b>is</b> <b>much</b> <b>too</b> {{small for the}} naked eye to resolve. Hence, prior to the {{invention}} of the telescope, nothing was known about the planet besides its position on the sky. The Italian scientist Galileo Galilei was the first person known to use a telescope to make astronomical observations. His records indicate that he began observing Mars through a telescope in September 1610. This instrument was too primitive to display any surface detail on the planet, so he set the goal of seeing if Mars exhibited phases of partial darkness similar to Venus or the Moon. Although uncertain of his success, by December he did note that Mars had shrunk in angular size. Polish astronomer Johannes Hevelius succeeded in observing a phase of Mars in 1645.|$|E

5|$|HD 93083 is {{an orange}} dwarf star of {{spectral}} type K3V that is smaller and cooler than the Sun. It has a planet that {{was discovered by}} the radial velocity method with the HARPS spectrograph in 2005. About as massive as Saturn, the planet orbits its star with a period of 143 days at a mean distance of 0.477 AU. WASP-66 is a sunlike star of spectral type F4V. A planet with 2.3 times the mass of Jupiter orbits it every 4 days, discovered by the transit method in 2012. DEN 1048-3956 is a brown dwarf of spectral type M8 located around 13 light-years distant from Earth. At magnitude 17 it <b>is</b> <b>much</b> <b>too</b> faint {{to be seen with}} the unaided eye. It has a surface temperature of about 2500 K. Two powerful flares lasting 4–5 minutes each were detected in 2002. 2MASS 0939-2448 is a system of two cool and faint brown dwarfs, probably with effective temperatures of about 500 and 700 K and masses of about 25 and 40 times that of Jupiter, though {{it is also possible that}} both objects have temperatures of 600 K and 30 Jupiter masses.|$|E
5|$|Ross 695 is a {{red dwarf}} star located a mere 28.9 ± 0.6 light-years distant from Earth. At {{apparent}} magnitude 11.27, it <b>is</b> <b>much</b> <b>too</b> faint {{to be seen with}} the unaided eye. A small star, it has around 23% the mass and radius of the Sun, but only 0.7% its luminosity. VHS 1256-1257 is a brown dwarf of spectral type M7.5 located 41 ± 3 light-years distant from Earth. Around 73 times as massive as Jupiter, it is just under the mass boundary separating brown dwarves from stars. It has a companion that was first identified and documented by the 2MASS survey in 2015. It orbits at a distance of 102 ± 9 AU and has an estimated mass of approximately 11 times Jupiter's. DENIS-P J1228.2-1547 is a system composed of two brown dwarfs orbiting each other located 73 ± 3 light-years away from Earth. TV Corvi is a dwarf nova composed of a white dwarf and brown dwarf that orbit each other every 90 minutes. The system has a baseline magnitude of 17 that brightens periodically to magnitude 12, discovered by Clyde Tombaugh in 1931 and David Levy in 1990 and 2005.|$|E
5|$|Seawater is {{invariably}} salty and, {{although its}} degree of saltiness (salinity) can vary, about 90% {{of the water}} in the ocean has 34– (1.2 oz.) of dissolved solids per liter, producing a salinity between 3.4 and 3.5%. To easily describe small differences, however, oceanographers usually express salinity as a millage (‰) or part per thousand (ppt) instead of using percents. The surface salinity of waters in the Northern Hemisphere are generally closer to the 34‰ mark, while those in the South are closer to 35‰. The solutes in ocean water come both from inflowing river water and from the ocean floor. The relative composition of the solutes is stable throughout the world's oceans: sodium (Na) and chloride (Cl) make up about 85%. Other solutes include metal ions such as magnesium (Mg) and calcium (Ca) and negative ions such as sulfate (SO₄), carbonate (CO₃), and bromides. In the absence of other pollution, seawater would not be harmful to drink except that it <b>is</b> <b>much</b> <b>too</b> saline; similarly, it cannot be used for irrigating most plants without being desalinated. For scientific and technical purposes, a standardized form of artificial seawater is often used.|$|E

25|$|Conventional {{interpretations of}} the {{symbolism}} of grave goods revolved around religion (equipment for the hereafter), legal concepts (inalienable possessions) and social structure (status display, ostentatious destruction of wealth). There was multiplicity of messages and variability of meanings characterised the deposition of objects in Anglo-Saxon graves. In Early Anglo-Saxon cemeteries, 47% of male adults and 9% of all juveniles were buried with weapons, {{some of which were}} very young. The proportion of adult weapon burials <b>is</b> <b>much</b> <b>too</b> high to suggest that they all represent a social élite. The usual assumption is that these are 'warrior burials', and this term is used throughout the archaeological and historical literature. However, a systematic comparison of burials with and without weapons, using archaeological and skeletal data, suggests that this assumption <b>is</b> <b>much</b> <b>too</b> simplistic and even misleading. Anglo-Saxon weapon burial rite involved a complex ritual symbolism: it was multi-dimensional, displaying ethnic affiliation, descent, wealth, élite status, and age groups. This symbol continued until c.700 when it ceased to have the symbolic power that it had before. Heinrich Härke suggests this change was due to the changing structure of society and especially in ethnicity and assimilation implying the lowering of ethnic boundaries in the Anglo-Saxon settlement areas of England, towards a common culture.|$|E
25|$|In {{addition}} to {{opposition to the}} merging of the museums, {{the establishment of the}} museum quarter by forcing cars off Andrássy út also received criticism.

However, the recent statistical analyses discussed that there is no correlation between the risk of negative health effects and elevated level of natural background radiation.|$|E
25|$|In {{the myth}} of Inanna's descent, Inanna, in order to console her grieving sister Ereshkigal, who is {{mourning}} {{the death of her}} husband Gugalana (gu, bull, gal, big, ana, sky/heaven), slain by Gilgamesh and Enkidu, sets out to visit her sister. She tells her servant Ninshubur (Lady Evening), a reference to Inanna's role as the evening star, that if she does not return in three days, to get help from her father Anu, Enlil, king of the gods, or Enki. When she does not return, Ninshubur approaches Anu only to be told that he understands that his daughter is strong and can take care of herself. Enlil tells Ninshubur he <b>is</b> <b>much</b> <b>too</b> busy running the cosmos. Enki immediately expresses concern and dispatches his Galla demons, Galaturra or Kurgarra, sexless beings created from the dirt from beneath the god's finger-nails, to recover the young goddess.

25|$|Much {{less common}} than colorless zircon is colorless scheelite. Its {{dispersion}} (0.026) is also {{high enough to}} mimic diamond, but although it is highly lustrous its hardness <b>is</b> <b>much</b> <b>too</b> low (4.5–5.5) to maintain a good polish. It is also anisotropic and fairly dense (SG 5.9–6.1). Synthetic scheelite produced via the Czochralski process is available, but {{it has never been}} widely used as a diamond simulant. Due to the scarcity of natural gem-quality scheelite, synthetic scheelite is much more likely to simulate it than diamond. A similar case is the orthorhombic carbonate cerussite, which is so fragile (very brittle with four directions of good cleavage) and soft (hardness 3.5) that it is never seen set in jewelry, and only occasionally seen in gem collections because it is so difficult to cut. Cerussite gems have an adamantine luster, high RI (1.804–2.078), and high dispersion (0.051), making them attractive and valued collector's pieces. Aside from softness, they are easily distinguished by cerussite's high density (SG 6.51) and anisotropy with extreme birefringence (0.271).|$|E

500|$|Although no new {{elements}} (apart from einsteinium and fermium) {{could be}} {{detected in the}} nuclear test debris, and the total yields of transuranium elements were disappointingly low, these tests did provide significantly higher amounts of rare heavy isotopes than previously available in laboratories.
