In 1827 he followed {{with the second}} volume, Lærebog i Mathematiken. Anden Deel (Textbook <b>in</b> <b>Mathematics.</b> Part Two), consisting of a further 155 pages. He used his own teaching experience as the background for his writing; mainly abstract, {{the purpose of the}} books was to instill logical thinking. For instance, in the field geometry, it enticed readers to envisage a figure instead of putting it to paper. The books became widely used, and were reprinted in four and five volumes respectively.|$|E
