25|$|At Pancrase 1996 Anniversary Show, {{taking place}} on September 7, Rutten defended his undisputed title against Masakatsu Funaki in what is {{considered}} {{to be one of the}} greatest fights in Pancrase history. The Japanese wrestler came near finishing the match earlier with an ankle lock, but Rutten escaped miraculously and proceeded to fend Funaki off for the rest of the bout, utilizing the same stalling strategy he had used against Suzuki. Funaki made a wide usage of the knee-on-stomach and mount position to initiate leglock attacks, but the Dutch countered every time and eventually pushed Masakatsu away, moment in which the Japanese threw an illegal kick to Rutten while he was <b>getting</b> <b>up.</b> <b>In</b> response, the Dutch fighter knocked Funaki down with a palm strike, and then completely broke his nose with a second palm strike to a supine Masakatsu. The stunned Japanese tried to trade hits with Rutten, only for Bas to capitalize on this with his famed striking game. Rutten knocked him down twice with palms and knees, and he followed landing a lengthy, unanswered string of strikes until a knee to the face finally downed Funaki for the KO victory. In doing so, he became a three-time King of Pancrase.|$|E
500|$|Fraser McAlpine {{writing for}} BBC Music praised the song's {{composition}} yet criticized its lyrics for [...] " [...] escaping {{the feeling that}} she's only <b>getting</b> <b>up</b> <b>in</b> our collective grill once again with the sexy and the 'tude". Gavin Martin from the Daily Mirror wrote that [...] "Not Myself Tonight" [...] "shows the post-natal Aguilera has pumped up her sex appeal. And, although her top-shelf strategy is hardly startling in its originality, it's accomplished with more class than her obvious competitors". On behalf of The Village Voice, Drew Hinshaw criticized Aguilera's vocals and lyrics on the song. Likewise, Dan Martin from NME opined that with the new musical style of Bionic and its lead single, Aguilera had very little chance to explore her vocal ability. Writing for Drowned in Sound, Richard Wink concerned that [...] "Not Myself Tonight" [...] showcased an [...] "apparent identity crisis" [...] that Aguilera experienced during the production of Bionic; he questioned whether the alter ego [...] "Xtina" [...] was [...] "the character that represents a freewheeling, risk taking, carefree party girl" [...] or the contrasting [...] "mask a desperate popstar wears when they are struggling to maintain relevance".|$|E
500|$|From 2004 to 2007, {{the number}} of people {{confined}} in the Hole increased from 40 to up to 100. They slept in cots or sleeping bags, squeezed into every available floor space or on desktops. Men would sleep around the conference table while women slept in cubicles and small offices around the main conference room. They were so crowded that there was barely any room to move, according to one of those present: [...] "Everyone sleeping with only about six inches on either side. Above you. Below you. <b>Getting</b> <b>up</b> <b>in</b> the middle of the night, you'd disturb everyone." [...] They were only allowed to leave to attend Church events or to be taken to a shower in a nearby maintenance garage, to which they were taken two at a time under guard. Food was brought to them on golf carts from the Gold Base mess hall, as the executives were not allowed to eat {{with the rest of the}} staff, and they were only given ten to fifteen minutes to eat. According to one of the executives, the food was [...] "like leftovers, slop, bits of meat, soupy kind of leftovers thrown into a pot and cooked and barely edible." [...] The building was said to be infested with ants and on several occasions the electricity was turned off, causing the temperature inside to reach [...] due to the lack of air conditioning.|$|E

500|$|The song is {{interpreted}} {{to be an}} ode to Noel and Liam Gallagher's mother Peggy. In general the lyrics of the song stress an optimistic outlook. Noel Gallagher explained that [...] "At the time [...] [...] [...] {{it was written in}} the middle of grunge and all that, and I remember Nirvana had a tune called 'I Hate Myself and Want to Die', and I was like [...] [...] [...] 'Well, I'm not fucking having that.' As much as I fucking like him [...] and all that shit, I'm not having that. I can't have people like that coming over here, on smack, fucking saying that they hate themselves and they wanna die. That's fucking rubbish. Kids don't need to be hearing that nonsense." [...] While Gallagher has stated he did not intend [...] "Live Forever" [...] as a direct retort to Nirvana or their music (being a professed fan of the band), he contrasted the lives of Cobain and his band at that point, saying, [...] "Seems to me that here was a guy who had everything, and was miserable about it. And we had fuck-all, and I still thought that <b>getting</b> <b>up</b> <b>in</b> the morning was the greatest fuckin' thing ever, 'cause you didn't know where you'd end up at night. And we didn't have a pot to piss in, but it was fucking great, man". Gallagher considers the line [...] "We see things they'll never see" [...] the most important line of the song, explaining that old friends tend to laugh at jokes and stories that [...] "no one else gets".|$|E
