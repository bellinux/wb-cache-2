40|$|International audienceMolecular sieves are {{materials}} {{often used}} in the petroleum industry, especially for the purification of gas streams and in the chemical industry for separating compounds and drying reaction starting materials. They are also used in the filtration of air supplies for breathing equipments. When saturated, the molecular sieve should be regenerated {{so that it can}} be used again. The objective of this paper is to study the heat integration possibilities in the process of regeneration and cooling of a molecular sieve using <b>heat</b> <b>storages.</b> We will be trying to find the optimum design of the heat integration network including <b>heat</b> <b>storages</b> and <b>heat</b> exchangers. This is done using a MILP (Mixed Integer Linear Programming) formulation of the multi period heat integration problem. The inputs of the algorithm are the temporal variation of the operational gas’ temperature and of its heat capacity over the whole cycle and the desired maximum number of <b>heat</b> <b>storages</b> to be used. The outputs of the algorithms are the <b>heat</b> <b>storages</b> temperatures, their capacities and the net heating and cooling energy demanded to satisfy all the energy needs of the process. The study will consider many simulations; in each the number of <b>heat</b> <b>storages</b> used is different. The results of each case will be shown and discussed and compared with the reference case, where all energy demands (heating and cooling) are satisfied using hot and cold utilities...|$|R

25|$|<b>Heat</b> <b>storage</b> enables {{solar thermal}} plants to produce {{electricity}} during hours without sunlight. Heat {{is transferred to}} a thermal storage medium in an insulated reservoir during hours with sunlight, and is withdrawn for power generation during hours lacking sunlight. Thermal storage mediums {{will be discussed in}} a <b>heat</b> <b>storage</b> section. Rate of heat transfer is related to the conductive and convection medium as well as the temperature differences. Bodies with large temperature differences transfer heat faster than bodies with lower temperature differences.|$|E

To balance power for district renewable energy supply, substantial energy can be stored into the floor without violating comfort limits.

25|$|The high <b>heat</b> <b>storage</b> {{capacity}} in the phase change from solid to liquid, and the advantageous phase change temperature of 32°C (90°F) makes this material especially appropriate for storing low grade solar heat for later release in space heating applications. In some applications the material is incorporated into thermal tiles that are placed in an attic space while in other applications the salt is incorporated into cells surrounded by solar–heated water. The phase change allows a substantial reduction in {{the mass of the}} material required for effective <b>heat</b> <b>storage</b> (the heat of fusion of sodium sulfate decahydrate is 82 kJ/mol or 252 kJ/kg), with the further advantage of a consistency of temperature as long as sufficient material in the appropriate phase is available.|$|E

40|$|Charging latent <b>heat</b> <b>storages</b> {{is limited}} by the low thermal {{conductivity}} of Phase Change Materials (PCMs). In the present work, a combined numerical-analytical study reveals the limits of PCM charging in terms of the governing non-dimensional properties. A Pareto front between energy and power density is obtained, presenting the trade-off between storage capacity and charging rate for these idealised limits. The results show that the characteristic length, i. e. the maximum distance between PCM material and a heat exchanging surface, should be reduced as much as possible in order to reach the highest performance. The Pareto front reveals that, depending on the PCM/metal combination, the maximal metal volume fraction should not exceed 70 to 95 %. Furthermore, the optimal metal volume fraction depends on energy density versus charging power requirements. The performance of existing latent <b>heat</b> <b>storages</b> are situated in the developed framework for charge limits. status: accepte...|$|R

25|$|Systems for {{utilizing}} low-temperature {{solar thermal}} energy include means for heat collection; usually <b>heat</b> <b>storage,</b> either short-term or interseasonal; and distribution within a structure or a district heating network.

25|$|Heat gain is {{the heat}} {{accumulated}} {{from the sun}} in the system. Solar thermal heat is trapped using the greenhouse effect; the greenhouse effect {{in this case is}} the ability of a reflective surface to transmit short wave radiation and reflect long wave radiation. Heat and infrared radiation (IR) are produced when short wave radiation light hits the absorber plate, which is then trapped inside the collector. Fluid, usually water, in the absorber tubes collect the trapped heat and transfer it to a <b>heat</b> <b>storage</b> vault.|$|E

25|$|Multiple {{studies have}} {{explored}} the thermoregulatory capacity of rodent tails by subjecting test organisms to {{varying levels of}} physical activity and quantifying heat conduction via the animals' tails. One study demonstrated a significant disparity in heat dissipation from a rat's tail relative to its abdomen. This observation was attributed to the higher proportion of vascularity in the tail, {{as well as its}} higher surface area to volume ratio, which directly relates to heat's ability to dissipate via the skin. These findings were confirmed in a separate study analyzing the relationships of <b>heat</b> <b>storage</b> and mechanical efficiency in rodents that exercise in warm environments. In this study, the tail was a focal point in measuring heat accumulation and modulation.|$|E
25|$|Use {{of solar}} heat for {{district}} heating {{has been increasing}} in Denmark and Germany in recent years. The systems usually include interseasonal thermal energy storage for a consistent heat output day to day and between summer and winter. Good examples are in Vojens at 50 MW, Dronninglund at 27 MW and Marstal at 13 MW in Denmark. These systems have been incrementally expanded to supply 10% to 40% of their villages' annual space heating needs. The solar-thermal panels are ground-mounted in fields. The <b>heat</b> <b>storage</b> is pit storage, borehole cluster and the traditional water tank.

40|$|If daily {{heat load}} {{variations}} could be eliminated in district heating-systems, {{it would make}} the operation of the district heating system less costly and more competitive. There would be several advantages in the operation such as: Less use of expensive peak load power where often expensive fuels are used. Less need for peak load power capacity. Easier to optimize the operation that leads to higher conversion efficiencies. Less need for maintenance because of more smooth operation of the plants There are a number of ways to handle the daily variations of the heat load.

40|$|Short term water <b>heat</b> <b>storage's</b> {{have been}} {{introduced}} in many district heating systems. The main {{reason for this is}} the possibilities opened by the storage for optimization of the generation of heat and electricity in combined heat and power plants. The basic task for the storage is then to bridge the timevise gap between the heat demand and supply of heat from a cogeneration plant. Water <b>heat</b> <b>storage's</b> can also be useful in district heating systems supplied with industrial waste heat. The water volume in the storage must be stratified to avoid degradation {{of the quality of the}} heat that has been charged. Experimental studies of phenomena that influence the stratification and cause a degradation of the quality has been made in model storage's of different sizes The studies include extensive temperature measurements and velocity measurements with different techniques. Laser Doppler Anemometry was used to measure the vertical velocities in the boundary layer at the outer walls. The gradient zone was found to have a strong impact on the velocity field. The maximum velocity in the boundary layer was increasing due to available height up to a certain level where it remained constant. Particle Image Velocimetry Technique were used for measuring the two dimensional velocity field in seeded water in a plane illuminated by a laser. These measurements showed that large scaled convection cells appeared both above and below the gradient zone. The exchange of water between the boundary layer and the core was also shown in these experiments. A video based PIV-technique was developed where a complete charging experiment could be recorded on a video tape. The pictures were analysed in an image processing program which made it possible to evaluate the whole velocity field. On basis of simulations for a case study representing the district heating system in Piteå it was found that heat quality degradation is not essential for the optimization of the storage volume. The different phenomena that influence the quality degradation are important however for optimizing the shape of a storage of a given size. The results from the measurements in the model <b>heat</b> <b>storage's</b> are useful mainly for validation of computer models for numerical prediction of velocity and temperature fields and as a basis for planning of experiments in larger storage's of commercial size. It was therefore decided to include in the study an evaluation of the importance of heat quality degradation for sizing of short term water <b>heat</b> <b>storage's.</b> Godkänd; 1993; 20070313 (ysko...|$|R
