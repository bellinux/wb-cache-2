Leisure is understood as a time of personal growth, creation, recreation and participation in society. The main article in this newsletter addresses the issue as a dimension of well-being for the region’s adolescents, explores the activities they carry out, highlighting some gender differences, and raises some challenges. Among them, it discusses the priority given to time spent on freely chosen activities, inclusive and equal access to cultural, recreational and leisure activities, the urgent need to prevent and eliminate child labour, the importance of digital media in adolescents’ recreation {{and the need for}} information sources that can provide a fuller picture of their experiences...|$|E

40|$|Few would {{doubt that}} the {{conditions}} of governance have changed-and continue to change-as the early 21 st century seems to enter a period of profound uncertainty. Yet, at the same time, the world seems alive with a cacophony of approaches-old and new-on how to improve governance and, ultimately, policy outcomes. This collection-the {{first in a series}} of annual editions-seeks to address the implications of the current state of the world in terms of "good governance", i. e. the effective, efficient, and reliable set of legitimate institutions and actors dedicated to dealing with matters of public concern, be it in the field of financial markets (the <b>focus</b> <b>of</b> <b>this</b> <b>edition),</b> health care, security, or migration, and across local, national and international levels. Researchers at The Hertie School of Governance (Berlin, Germany) and other experts examine the current state of governance challenges and innovations from a variety <b>of</b> inter-disciplinary perspectives. <b>This</b> <b>edition</b> features a special set of chapters on the challenges of financial and fiscal governance, the tradeoffs faced by governance actors, and the new arrangements that have emerged or are required to not only address the ongoing crisis but also ensure greater stability into the future. This special section is complemented by chapters introducing basic concepts and models; exploring other global challenges and the reasons behind seemingly lackluster responses to them and highlighting the need for responsible sovereignty; conceptualizing governance innovation and introducing key examples; and assessing existing indicators of governance, while proposing a new framework for collecting, interpreting and applying governance-related informatio...|$|R
40|$|The set of {{sessions}} {{to make up}} the Track ranging between “Networked Arts: basic issues and achievements” and “On line cultural application: the new paradigma” stressed the <b>focus</b> <b>of</b> <b>this</b> year <b>edition</b> on an area identified by the European Commission as key for informatics and telecommunication applications. Indeed the <b>focus</b> <b>of</b> the Track on cultural heritage has attracted attendees {{from a wide variety of}} disciplines: archeologists, architects, art historians, designers, and of course ICT experts, who presented their contributions mostly in the Presentation program, extending the traditional WWW audience. We expect cross-fertilisation from different disciplines to be most useful in order to bring effective advantages to the Cultural Heritage area from WWW research...|$|R
40|$|International audienceOver the years, {{challenged}} {{networks have}} evolved from niche solution for extremely hostile scenarios (such as disaster relief or connectivity provision in rural and remote areas) to {{important component of}} everyday networks. In their second life, challenged networks have entered mobile cloud/mobile edge computing, IoT, mobile data offloading, and SDN. It is exactly these new directions of challenged networking that are the <b>focus</b> <b>of</b> <b>this</b> 2016 <b>edition</b> <b>of</b> CHANTS. While {{keeping an eye on}} the future, we also wanted to tackle a years-old affliction: how to move from theory to practice when dealing with challenged networks. For this reason, we also have a lineup spanning DTN software and testbeds that will speed up the jump from the research lab to marketable products...|$|R
40|$|Career {{adaptability}} {{is mediated}} by personality factors and socio-psychological processes, with learning playing an important role. Using a five-fold career adapt-abilities competency framework (defined here as control, curiosity, commitment, confidence and concern), which was {{developed from the}} international quantitative study that is the <b>focus</b> <b>of</b> <b>this</b> special <b>edition,</b> an explicitly qualitative study of the career biographies of mid-career changers from two European countries was undertaken. Data from 64 in-depth interviews with adults in contrasting labor markets from Norway and the UK were analysed deductively, using a career adapt-abilities framework. Results demonstrate {{the utility of the}} framework, as well as how adaptive adults used both formal and informal learning to develop career adapt-ability competencies, over time, across occupations and occupational sectors. A key conclusion relates to how this career adapt-abilities competency framework could be used to motivate adults in mid-career to adopt behaviors that help them effect positive career change...|$|R
40|$|The {{report is}} {{prepared}} jointly by DG ECFIN and DG TAXUD of the European Commission. As the previous edition, the report analyses recent trends in tax revenues and tax reforms in EU Member States. A particular <b>focus</b> <b>of</b> <b>this</b> year's <b>edition</b> {{is on the}} consequences of the global economic and financial crisis on revenue systems and the need to provide adequate policy responses. Given the size of the budgetary consolidation required after the crisis, a contribution from the revenue side will be necessary in many countries. The report analyses how revenue increases and tax systems in general could be designed in a growth-friendly way and to what extent some of the reforms would entail a need for coordination at the EU level. Moreover, it discusses tax policy issues related to the crisis and contributes to the ongoing discussion on financial sector taxation. European Union, taxation, tax reforms, financial sector...|$|R
40|$|Welcome to the 6 th {{edition of}} the Electronic Journal of Inclusive Education. Providing insight into {{changing}} the attitudes of regular educators concerning inclusive practice and knowledge concerning accommodating students with special learning needs is the <b>focus</b> <b>of</b> <b>this</b> <b>edition.</b> We also have an article addressing concerns {{about the use of}} behavior modification in public school classrooms. As the conversation continues concerning including students with special needs in regular education classrooms, the need for greater awareness and acceptance of the diversity inherent in the human condition becomes clearer in light of the September 11 th attacks on the World Trade Center. One article highlights dispositions of caring and concern that can be taught in public school classrooms. We also welcome a new member to our editorial board, Dr. Kimberly G. Griffith. Dr. Karen A. Verbeke discusses and identifies strategies and approaches to accommodating students with special needs in the regular classroom. This article also highlights the need for ongoing communication and collaboration between regular and special educators to provide for the needs of all students. Dr. James D. Dunne writes a very cogent rebuttal to the recent criticism of the use of behavior analysis/behavior modification in public school situation. This article highlights four approaches to instruction that have proven to be extremely beneficial not only for students with disabilities but also for all students in general education classrooms. Dr. Dunne provides insight into these well-researched and proven instructional techniques. Dr. Julie K. Ivey and Dr. Kathryn Reinke document changes in pre-service teachers attitudes to inclusive practice due to the interactions and training they have received during a summer program in environmental education. This article reveals the need for pre-service preparation for inclusive practice for both regular and special educators and highlights the resistance by regular educators to inclusive practice and settings. Dr. Everington, Dr. Stevens, and Ms. Kozar-Kocsis surveyed regular educators efforts to differentiate instruction for students with disabilities as well as for unidentified students with different learning needs. Their study reveals that experienced educators can and do differentiate instruction and work 2 ̆ 2 in the spirit of inclusive education. 2 ̆ 2 Dr. Griffith, Dr. Cooper and Dr. Ringlaben provide a paradigm and model for full acceptance of student with disabilities in regular education classrooms. Unique to their approach is the effort to make 2 ̆ 2 students with disabilities part of a circle of relationships rather than the center of relationships 2 ̆ 2. This article highlights the need to teach caring dispositions in public education. <b>This</b> current <b>edition</b> continues the conversation and enhances the knowledge base concerning inclusive practice and access to knowledge within the public school. We hope you enjoy and learn from the reading of it...|$|R
40|$|The {{ability to}} engage in {{reasoned}} discussion is a skill that is needed in many different workplace and community contexts. The capacity to argue effectively can enhance an individual’s democratic participation in contemporary society through, for example, online communication with political representatives, or participation in the political blogosphere. Yet {{studies have shown that}} many citizens’ argumentation skills are ‘only of the most elementary sort’ (Kuhn 1991, 264). This is despite the fact that both the process (argumentation) and the product (argument) of putting forward and negotiating ideas and perspectives is a fundamental aim of education. Educational argumentation, and the methods and tools of analysis for investigating it, are the <b>focus</b> <b>of</b> <b>this</b> special <b>edition.</b> In combination, the papers present an array of different means by which educational argumentation is currently being researched by key scholars in the field. The methods discussed have been shaped by a number of theoretical orientations and have emerged in a range of disciplinary fields, including linguistics, education, psychology, philosophy and computer science. Many have been influenced by recent developments in technology. Such research necessarily involves judgements concerning the effectiveness and quality of argumentation, as well as ideas on the development of new teaching-learning strategies, processes and resources. In <b>this</b> special <b>edition,</b> however, the focus is on methods for investigating the nature and meaning of argumentation as it occurs in educational contexts and on methods for investigating how it is taught and learned. [...] . In the following sections <b>of</b> <b>this</b> guest editorial, we set the scene for the papers that follow by discussing key trends in contemporary educational argumentation practices, pointing to how such trends are leading to modifications and innovations in research methods. Throughout the sections we also provide critical comment on what we consider to be some of the most significant issues which have emerged as a result of such innovations...|$|R
