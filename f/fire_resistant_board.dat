Prominent among these developments has been the high performance elastomers known as PN-F or Eypel-F, which have been manufactured for seals, O-rings, and dental devices. An aryloxy-substituted polymer has also been developed as a <b>fire</b> <b>resistant</b> expanded foam for thermal and sound insulation. The patent literature contains many references to cyclomatrix polymers derived from cyclic trimeric phosphazenes incorporated into cross-linked resins for <b>fire</b> <b>resistant</b> circuit <b>boards</b> and related applications.|$|R
50|$|Saha {{was the son}} of William and Henrikka Saha, a Finnish-American couple. After {{serving in}} the Merchant Marine during World War II, he {{enrolled}} in and graduated from Columbia University. Saha worked as a research chemist and is credited with the patent for the first <b>fire</b> <b>resistant</b> ironing <b>board</b> cover, and for various paints and pigments used on the exteriors of the first space satellites. At one time he was a resident of Minnesota; in his later years Saha resided in Cooperstown, Otsego County, New York. While living in New York City, he was an early associate of the beatniks. Saha was a long-standing member of Mensa. He died of cancer.|$|R

This paper explains the thermal loads on <b>fire</b> <b>resistant</b> glazing when tested according to European standards and compares these loads to the situation of a facade exposed to a pool fire. It shows an example of building developments close to rail and waterways with hazardous goods transports that led to research on a low budget solution to fireproof facades without using <b>fire</b> <b>resistant</b> glazing and will also show the results of this research...|$|R

40|$|U) During an Army {{research}} {{program in the}} mid- 1980 s, fire-resistant diesel fuel that self extinguished when ignited by an explosive projectile was developed. Chemically, this <b>fire</b> <b>resistant</b> fuel (FRF) was a stable mixture of diesel fuel, 10 percent water, and an emulsifier. The Army FRF program ended in 1987 without fielding this <b>fire</b> <b>resistant</b> fuel formulation. There were both technical and logistical reasons for this. Unconventional warfare experienced in Iraq and Afghanistan involving use of Improvised Explosive Devices (IED) has led the Army to restart the FRF program {{in an attempt to}} counter the increasing threat of fuel fires. Efforts are now underway to develop new <b>Fire</b> <b>Resistant</b> Fuel to reduce and/or eliminate both the initial mist fireball and any residual pool burning.
