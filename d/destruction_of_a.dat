5|$|In the {{unfolding}} plot, the player learns that Tachikawa and Elaine were killed (by the sabotage of their gun-ships) to procure microchips implanted in their brains. These chips can record a pilot's knowledge and combat skills; Nanosoft desired them {{to power the}} artificial intelligence in their weapons. The G-Police commander Horton is assassinated by Slater's traitorous wingman Ricardo, also to this end. The game ends with the <b>destruction</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> large spacecraft by Slater; the closing sequence reveals that Nanosoft had planned to use this to exert military dominance over other corporations.|$|E

5|$|On {{their return}} to Martlesham, Dowding {{outlined}} his concerns about night interceptions and {{the characteristics of a}} proper night fighter. Since the interceptions were long affairs, the aircraft needed to have long endurance. To ensure that friendly fire was not an issue, pilots would be required to identify all targets visually. This meant a separate radar operator would be needed, so the pilot would not lose his night vision by looking at the CRTs. And finally, since the time needed to arrange an interception was so long, the aircraft required armament that could guarantee <b>destruction</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> bomber in a single pass—there was little chance a second interception could be arranged.|$|E
5|$|The Pakistan Air Force retaliated {{for these}} attacks by bombing Okha harbour scoring direct hits on {{fuelling}} facilities for missile boats, an ammunition dump, and the missile boats' jetty.

However, the <b>destruction</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> special fuel tank prevented any further incursions until Operation Python, executed three days later.|$|E
