40|$|The Rotterdam Rules set forth, on {{the lines}} of the Hague- Visby Rules, a number of {{excepted}} perils when the carrier will not be liable for the damage to cargo. The institute of excepted perils was established by the Hague Rules almost 90 years ago, and is still implemented in practice. For such cases exceptionally the carrier is not liable under the principle of assumed guilty, but under the principle of proven guilty. In the preliminary activities for concluding the new international convention, the possibility has been considered of abolition of the institute of excepted perils has been considered, but in the end nevertheless, on the initiative of mainly maritime states, it has been retained, developed and more contemporarily styled, i. e. concerted with the requirements of the contemporary maritime transport. The Rotterdam Rules in Article 17, Paragraph 3, taxatively cite the excepted perils due to which the carrier will be able to exculpate from liability. The key difference is that error in navigation is no longer an <b>excepted</b> <b>peril.</b> Especially important novelties introduced by the Rotterdam Rules are exemption of the carrier from liability due to the acts of piracy, terrorist attacks, undertaking measures to avoid or prevent possible damage to the environment, and alike...|$|E
40|$|This thesis {{discusses}} {{the nature of}} sea carriers' implied obligations of seaworthiness, care of cargo and non-deviation from the voyage route, at common law and under the Hague and Hague-Visby Rules, and their effect on clauses which seek to exclude or modify them. After {{a consideration of the}} historical evolution and nature of the implied obligations, the standards of performance imposed under them at common law is considered before going on to how the peculiar nature of the obligations lead to modified results under the general contract law rules for the construction of exclusion clauses. The discussion proceeds to the standards of the obligations imposed on the carrier by the Hague and Hague-Visby Rules to exercise due diligence to make the vessel seaworthy and to properly and carefully carry the cargo. There is a consideration of the significance of the overriding, as well as the non-delegable nature of these obligations. In particular, whether or not a carrier whose breach of an implied obligation is a cause of the loss or damage to cargo, can rely on the exceptions provided by the Rules is considered in depth. The final sections of the thesis deal with the principles of causation and onus of proof applied in sea cargo claims and how they impact upon the interface between the implied obligations and exclusion clauses. The analysis of causation examines how liability is determined where the carrier's breach of an implied obligation co-operates with or is intervened upon by an <b>excepted</b> <b>peril</b> to produce the loss or damage to cargo. With respect to onus of proof, the issue considered is which party bears the legal burden on proof or disproof of the breach of an implied obligation: must the cargo owner establish affirmatively that the particular breach asserted caused his loss or is it for the carrier, as part of his defence, and claim for exemption from liability. to negative breach? The thesis advances two principal arguments. First, it is argued that because of the development of the implied obligations of seaworthiness, care of cargo and non-deviation from route as important obligations which underlie the carriage contract, strict and utmost care standards of performance are imposed under them at common law and under the Hague-Visby Rules respectively. Secondly, it is argued that the result of these high standards of performance {{is that there is a}} "risk" approach to liability which explains the peculiar rules of construction, causation and onus of proof which import restriction on the effect of sea carriers' exclusion clauses.

"The Austrian Government, and Kaiser Karl's in particular, {{is not to}} {{be called}} an {{intentionally}} unjust one; the contrary, I rather find; but it is, beyond others, ponderous; based broad on such multiplex formalities, old habitudes; and GRAVITATION has a great power over it. In brief, Official human nature, with the best of Kaisers atop, flagitated continually by Jesuit Confessors, does throw its weight on a certain side: the sad fact is, in a few years the brightness of that Altranstadt improvement began to wax dim; and now, under long Jesuit manipulation, Silesian things are nearly at their old pass; and the patience of men is heavily laden. To see your Chapel made a Soldiers' Barrack, your Protestant School become a Jesuit one,--Men did not then think of revolting under injuries; but the poor Silesian weaver, trudging twenty miles for his Sunday sermon; and perceiving that, unless their Mother could teach the art of reading, his boys, <b>except</b> under soul's <b>peril,</b> would now never learn it: such a Silesian could not want for reflections. Voiceless, hopeless, but heavy; and dwelling secretly, as under nightmare, in a million hearts. Austrian Officiality, wilfully unjust, or not wilfully so, is admitted to be in a most heavy-footed condition; can administer nothing well. Good Government in any kind is not known here: Possibly the Prussian will be better; who can say? ...|$|R
6000|$|There are {{two ways}} of {{enlarging}} the size of trout which should be carefully avoided. Pike are supposed to keep down the population and leave more food for the survivors, minnows {{are supposed to be}} nourishing food. Both of these novelties are dangerous. Pike have been introduced in that long lovely sheet of water, Loch Ken, and I have never once seen the rise of a trout break that surface, so [...] "hideously serene." [...] Trout, in lochs which have become accustomed to feeding on minnows, are apt to disdain fly altogether. Of course there are lochs in which good trout coexist with minnows and with pike, but these inmates are too dangerous to be introduced. The introduction, too, of Loch Leven trout is often disappointing. Sometimes they escape down the burn into the river in floods; sometimes, perhaps for lack of proper food and sufficient, they dwindle terribly in size, and become no better than [...] "brownies." [...] In St. Mary's Loch, in Selkirkshire, some Canadian trout were introduced. Little or nothing has been seen of them, unless some small creatures of a quarter of a pound, extraordinarily silvery, and more often in the air than in the water when hooked, are these children of the remote West. If they grew up, and retained their beauty and sprightliness, they would be excellent substitutes for sea-trout. Almost all experiments in stocking lochs have their <b>perils,</b> <b>except</b> the simple experiment of putting trout where there were no trout before. This can do no harm, and they may increase in weight, let us hope not in wisdom, like the curiously heavy and shy fish mentioned in the beginning of this paper.|$|R

My anger {{against you}} is gone; my sad {{reflections}} on you, {{and on the}} depths to which you and I {{and all of us}} are sunk in these strange times, are not to be uttered at present.

My clear opinion farther is, we had better quit the Scoundrel-province of Reform; better close that under hatches, in some rapid summary manner, and go elsewhither with our Reform efforts. A whole world, for want of Reform, is drowning and sinking; threatening to swamp itself into a Stygian quagmire, uninhabitable by any noble-minded man. Let us to the well-heads, I say; to the chief fountains of these waters of bitterness; and there strike home and dig! To puddle in the embouchures and drowned outskirts, and ulterior and ultimate issues and cloacas of the affair: what profit can there be in that? Nothing to be saved there; nothing to be fished up there, <b>except,</b> with endless <b>peril</b> and spread of pestilence, a miscellany of broken waifs and dead dogs! In the name of Heaven, quit that! ...|$|R
60|$|The {{crest of}} the ridge was only half a mile away. It was found unoccupied. The rocky mass of Surgham {{obstructed}} the view and concealed the great reserve collected around the Black Flag. But southward, between us and Omdurman, the whole plain was exposed. It was infested with small parties of Dervishes, moving about, mounted and on foot, in tens and twenties. Three miles away a broad stream of fugitives, of wounded, and of deserters flowed from the Khalifa's army to the city. The mirages blurred and distorted the picture, so {{that some of the}} routed Arabs walked in air and some through water, and all were misty and unreal. But the sight was sufficient to excite the fiercest instincts of cavalry. Only the scattered parties in the plain appeared to prevent a glorious pursuit. The signalling officer was set to heliograph back to the Sirdar that the ridge was unoccupied and that several thousand Dervishes could be seen flying into Omdurman. Pending the answer, we waited; and looking back northwards, across the front of the zeriba, where the first attack had been stopped, perceived a greyish-white smudge, perhaps a mile long. The glass disclosed details--hundreds of tiny white figures heaped or scattered; dozens hopping, crawling, staggering away; a few horses standing stolidly among the corpses; a few unwounded men dragging off their comrades. The skirmishers among the rocks of Surgham soon began to fire at the regiment, and we sheltered among the mounds of sand, while a couple of troops replied with their carbines. Then the heliograph in the zeriba began to talk in flashes of light that opened and shut capriciously. The actual order is important. 'Advance,' said the helio, 'and clear the left flank, and use every effort to prevent the enemy re-entering Omdurman.' That was all, but it was sufficient. In the distance the enemy could be seen re-entering Omdurman in hundreds. There was no room for doubt. They must be stopped, and incidentally these small parties in the plain might be brushed away. We remounted; the ground looked smooth and unbroken; yet it was desirable to reconnoitre. Two patrols were sent out. The small parties of Dervishes who were scattered all over the plain and the slopes of the hill prevented anything less than a squadron moving, <b>except</b> at their <b>peril.</b> The first patrol struck out towards Omdurman, and began to push in between the scattered Dervishes, who fired their rifles and showed great excitement. The other patrol, under Lieutenant Grenfell, were sent to see what the ground looked like from further along the ridge and on the lower slopes of Surgham. The riflemen among the rocks turned their fire from the regiment to these nearer objects. The five brown figures cantered over the rough ground, presenting difficult targets, but under continual fire, and disappeared round the spur. However, in two or three minutes they re-appeared, the riflemen on the hill making a regular rattle of musketry, amid which the Lancers galloped safely back, followed last of all by their officer. He said that the plain looked as safe {{from the other side of}} the hill as from where we were. At this moment the other patrol returned. They, too, had had good fortune in their adventurous ride. Their information was exact. They reported that in a shallow and apparently practicable khor about three-quarters of a mile to the south-west, and between the regiment and the fugitives, there was drawn up a formed body of Dervishes about 1,000 strong. Colonel Martin decided on this information to advance and attack this force, which alone interposed between him and the Arab line of retreat. Then we started.|$|R
