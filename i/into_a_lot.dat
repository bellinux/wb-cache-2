5|$|Leslie is {{convinced}} she can reason with Andy {{if they can}} talk without their lawyers, but Andy will not return her calls. Finally, Ann calls Andy and asks {{him to come to}} her house. Later that day, he arrives completely naked, having assumed Ann wanted to take him back. A disgusted Ann leaves the house, leaving Leslie and Andy to talk. Andy admits he is suing the town in an attempt to win Ann back, and she thinks of a different way he can impress her. The next day at city hall, Andy tells Leslie and Scott he will drop the lawsuit if they agree to fill in the pit right away. Scott agrees, unaware it was a trick between Andy and Leslie.

The episode ends with Keef riding a motorboat, revealing his role in KaBOOM! was an elaborate prank to get the playground built, and announcing he is going to build a hospital in a poor part of China.|$|E

Knowing that Presley had been looking for help within the music industry, Strong had her play tapes for Jackson, who was impressed with Presley's voice. The pair talked {{for the remainder of the}} night, until it was time for Jackson to leave. At this point, according to Strong, the entertainer gave Presley, who was still married at the time, a penetrating look and said in a conspiratorial voice, [...] "You and me, we could get <b>into</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> of trouble.

500|$|Earthsuit {{music was}} {{primarily}} rock, but also possessed strong hip-hop, electronica, reggae, soul, and experimental elements. Their sound had sometimes {{been compared to}} The Police, while Meany's rapping had been likened to the Beastie Boys. Adam LaClave stated the differing musical tastes of the band helped cultivate their sound: [...] "Each {{one of us is}} really <b>into</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> of different things ... it helps make our sound because you can hear all kinds of things". Live performances were characterized by [...] sunglasses, futuristic costumes, and energetic showmanship. Many bands have influenced Earthsuit's style; the group has performed covers of songs by Basement Jaxx, Black Sheep, Kraftwerk, and The Talking Heads. They have also utilized samples by DJ Shadow and The Verve.|$|E

In the Bayou Grande area of Pensacola, the tide {{was estimated to}} be about [...] above normal. At the intersection of Cedar and Baylen streets, oyster boats, steam tugs, wood, and other debris were scattered. A boat identified as the Wolverine was tossed <b>into</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> near the corner. Trees and chimneys were blown down, and a tin roof was peeled off a house as a result of strong winds. On the 26th port, one bark was completely destroyed, while another eleven were tossed around. A schooner that sank during the hurricane was tipped over. At the 38th port, 29 schooners were thrown ashore, and another sixteen were completely destroyed.

Other debris was scattered around the city, including pieces of shattered glass. A fire occurred at a hotel in Pensacola.|$|E
500|$|HOK Sport {{designed}} the stadium. HOK Sport's {{project manager for}} the project, Melinda Lehman, said that the Rooney family asked for the stadium's design to [...] "acknowledge the history of Pittsburgh and also bring in an element of looking forward, this is where Pittsburgh is going." [...] In order to accomplish this, HOK Sport used steel structurally and externally. The stone used in Heinz Field's design is artificial, in order to decrease cost. Of the glass used in the stadium's design, Lehman said, [...] "The glass is a more modern building element, which ties <b>into</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> of the buildings in [...] Pittsburgh and gives great views of the surrounding areas." [...] The Steelers and Panthers have their own locker rooms, which differ in size based {{on the amount of}} players each team is permitted to dress for each game. The visitor facilities are modeled after the home locker rooms' design. As with its predecessor, Heinz Field's culinary service provider is Aramark; over 400eateries are located throughout the stadium. A bronze statue of Steelers founder Art Rooney, similar to those located outside PNC Park, was moved [...] from its previous position outside Three Rivers Stadium. In addition, a statue of a Pitt Panther over a paved depiction of Pitt's Cathedral of Learning was placed outside Gate A. Upon opening in 2001, Heinz Field's 27by96foot Sony JumboTron was the largest scoreboard in the NFL. In 2007, ESPN named the [...] "tipping" [...] of the oversized Heinz ketchup bottles atop the scoreboard one of the top ten touchdown celebrations in the NFL.|$|E

500|$|The writers {{made several}} other changes going from season one to season two, {{including}} making the scripts more focused around the entire cast {{rather than just}} Leslie. They also tried to make Leslie appear more intelligent in the second season after receiving audience feedback that she appeared [...] "ditzy", which Michael Schur said was never their intention. Schur said, [...] "In the end, we just felt that Amy is an enormously likable presence on screen, so as the season went on we just tried to create situations where that would shine through." [...] During the episode [...] "Kaboom", a major subplot was resolved when the large construction pit that Leslie had long sought {{to turn into a}} park was filled with dirt and turned <b>into</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot.</b> The pit was first established in the premiere episode and had been a focal point of the series since the show began. Schur said while the pit project was originally conceived as a device to bring all the characters together working toward a common goal, and it was expected to only become a park during the series finale. However, Schur said he felt the early episodes were too focused on the pit and had led viewers to believe the entire show was about filling the pit, which was not the writers' intention, so they accelerated the resolution of that story arc. The idea of Ben and Chris, two state auditors who come in from outside Pawnee to help the town deal with budget problems, was conceived from news reports at the time of a number of states considering shutting down schools, parks and other services due to the global recession.|$|E
500|$|In February 2003, Case {{temporarily}} {{exited the}} show {{as a result of}} lengthy contract negotiations. Instead of having the character depart permanently (or be killed off), executive producer David Shaughnessy chose to have her leave town after issues with her marriage to Nick. While away, Sharon becomes suicidal; Case explained that Sharon's life had fallen apart and she left town to commit suicide, drinking herself into [...] "a complete stupor". Travelling to Denver, she meets (and has an affair with) businessman Cameron Kirsten (Linden Ashby), who physically abuses her. In April, Case signed a new contract with the show. Executive producer and head writer at the time John F. Smith said that upon Sharon's return to Genoa City, she wants to keep where she was a secret. That December, Sharon is horrified when Cameron arrives in town for apparent business with Newman Enterprises. Smith stated that the story with Cameron and Sharon would be one that [...] "builds quickly <b>into</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> of drama". Explaining their relationship, Ashby revealed that Cameron and Sharon were [...] "kindred spirits" [...] and hooked up, but Cameron becomes abusive, with Ashby calling him [...] "really disturbing". Cameron blackmails Sharon into meeting him at a motel. When she arrives they have a physical altercation in which Sharon throws a bottle at him to keep him from raping her, [...] "killing" [...] him (or so she believes). Australian magazine TV Soap noted that [...] "sweet, demure" [...] Sharon had become a murderer. After driving around with his body in her car trunk for days, she dumps it in an alley. Sharon's former friend, Grace, returns to town; she discovers Cameron alive, and nurses him back to health. Detective Weber (Sherman Augustus) is suspicious of Sharon's involvement in Cameron's disappearance. Sharon begins [...] "hallucinating" [...] with visions of Cameron's [...] "ghost" [...] (which is actually him, alive). Case noted that Sharon was getting into deeper trouble by making mistakes [...] "trying to do the right thing".|$|E
500|$|In April 2011, Mercy faces {{deportation}} to Nigeria, and Fatboy {{plans to}} save her by proposing. Norwood revealed that Mercy is shocked by the proposal, adding [...] "Mercy thinks he's lost his marbles, but soon comes round to the idea. Fatboy reckons that this isn't about his feelings, it's all about keeping her in the UK. Of course, he's also hoping that if she stays, maybe she'll end up liking him {{in the way he}} likes her. [...] You can get <b>into</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> of trouble for , ut all Fatboy can think is, 'How can I save Mercy?' She's the girl he loves." [...] Although Fatboy is in love with Mercy, he does not believe that Mercy sees him as more than a friend and may call off the wedding if he tells her. He does not think of the consequences, such as imprisonment. Norwood revealed that Fatboy has known Mercy since they were nine years old and he had feelings for her when EastEnders: E20 started, as he was upset when she got pregnant by someone else. He said that Fatboy would be heartbroken when Mercy leaves. Norwood told Inside Soap that the wedding creates more problems for the characters, rather than solving all their problems. The fact that they try so hard to prove they are genuine makes it [...] "very hard for them to be friends." [...] The wedding episode sees Fatboy have a dream come true, {{but at the same time}} it is a nightmare for him. Knowing the wedding is a sham he is [...] "waiting for that monster to appear". Ashley turns up and is annoyed that Fatboy has kept the wedding a secret, and of this, Norwood stated: [...] "When [...] finds out what has happened he is pretty shocked. He tries to make Fatboy see the consequences of his actions, but Fatboy doesn't want to hear it—his dad has already betrayed him when it comes to Mercy." [...] Mercy is shocked to learn that Fatboy did not tell her that Ashley reported her. Although Norwood concluded that Fatboy [...] "will go to the ends of the earth to make this marriage work".|$|E

The pleasure here– David Mitchell's endearing squareness apart– is the depths to which this silliness sinks". Jane Anderson in The Radio Times described the show as [...] "the funniest thing I've heard on Radio 4 in years and I'm considering suing the network for irreparable damage to my sides" [...] and Chris Campling in The Times called it [...] "The most consistently entertaining comedy panel show of the past few years" [...] and praises David Mitchell's chairmanship.|$|E

2500|$|... "With {{the release}} of Unexpected, Williams has welcomed R back into her arms with a modern edge, a la Rihanna and Chris Brown, infusing her soulful lyrics with party beats and dance-like synths. Take the lead single, for instance. [...] "We Break the Dawn" [...] is an immensely catchy mid-tempo jam co-written by Williams and ex-Child Beyonce's sister, Solange Knowles. The track re-launched the {{ebullient}} singer back into the mainstream, sporting a new, edgy electronica look and sound. [...] "We Break the Dawn" [...] has {{a certain amount of}} memorability in the synth riff and the laid-back party lyrics. The song is carefree, and {{a far cry from the}} depth of Gospel music. The album features a collection of [...] "moods" [...] including the bouncy tracks [...] "Hello Heartbreak," [...] hilariously including [...] "It's time for the percolator" [...] as the bridge, and [...] "Lucky Girl" [...] once the smooth intro stops. These dance-pop R beats are the same light and noncommittal ones you've become accustomed to with artists like, as I said earlier, Rihanna and Chris Brown, along with the party feel of The Pussycat Dolls and other contemporaries. Another mood of Unexpected is the party jam feel exhibited by [...] "Private Party" [...] and [...] "Hungover," [...] the tracks you jam while driving down the road with your windows down. [...] "The Greatest," [...] a fantastic pop ballad, and [...] "Thank U," [...] a melodic song about thanking what held you down so you can appreciate how far you've come, round out the heavier, and slower, moods on the album. Summary; this album fits nicely <b>into</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> of musical niches, making it a good addition to most collections. And you may be humming some of these tracks years down the line. Not my favorite of the year, but not too shabby either." ...|$|E
2500|$|A Chicago house album, Virgos music draws {{elements}} {{from the local}} deep house and acid house styles, and bears influence and similitaries {{with the work of}} Larry Heard, Fingers Inc. and Armando.

However, Virgo has been noted for its idiosyncratic sound, more introspective and dreamy than other mechanically intense styles from its era, Phuture's [...] "Acid Trax" [...] for example. In a 2009 interview, Merwyn Sanders stated: [...] "We were <b>into</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> of classic stuff, Kraftwerk and Gary Numan and a lot of jazz stuff. That’s what I grew up around, listening. My dad was a huge jazz fan, so that was just engrained in my head without me even knowing it. So I guess that’s what you get a little sense of with that album we did." [...] Fact called it a [...] "deep post-acid" [...] album, and wrote that despite being similar to other contemporary house releases, [...] "it stands alone, and its cerebral but generously groovy evocation of the urban nightscape has never been matched for elegance or acuity." [...] Alexis Petridis of The Guardian described it as [...] "music you might make the day after a drugged-out bacchanal – wistful and contemplative, shot through with a creeping, contagious melancholy." [...] Joe Muggs described Virgo as [...] "archetypal house music through and through: it is design {{as much as it is}} art, absolutely attuned to the proportions and metabolism of the human body in a technological society." [...] He also noted that despite the [...] "soulfulness and the spindly stripping down of its production", the album is not [...] "less powerful than noisier, bassier or thicker music." ...|$|E
