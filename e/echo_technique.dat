An accuracy of +/- 0. 001 inches is typically noted for commercial ultrasonic thickness gauges and ultrasonic thickness techniques. Codes and standards put limitations on many inspection factors including equipment, calibration tolerance and temperature variations. These factors are important and should be controlled, but unfortunately do not guarantee accurate and repeatable measurements in the field.

50|$|Floyd Alburn Firestone (1898-1986) was an {{acoustical}} physicist, who in 1940 while {{a professor}} at the University of Michigan invented the first practical ultrasonic testing method and apparatus. He was granted US Patent 2,280,226 for the invention in 1942. Manufactured by Sperry Corporation, the testing device was known variously as the Firestone-Sperry Reflectoscope, the Sperry Ultrasonic Reflectoscope, the Sperry Reflectoscope and sometimes also just as a Supersonic Reflectoscope, the name Firestone had originally coined for the instrument. The technology is not just used in quality control in factories to reject defective parts before shipment, but also revolutionized transportation safety. For example, ultrasonic testing is used for safety maintenance inspection of railroad cars, particularly axles and wheels, aircraft, particularly fuselages, and other transportation vessels for material fatigue. Dr. Firestone’s ultrasonic pulse <b>echo</b> <b>technique</b> for metal defect testing was also later applied in medical diagnosis, giving birth to the field of Echocardiography and to the field of Medical Ultrasonography, generally. Dr. Firestone was the editor of the Journal of the Acoustical Society of America from 1939-1957. Among Firestone’s many other inventions in his field are in a single year an “automatic device for the minute inspection of flaws”, “a new and useful improvement in hook-up of electrical apparatus”, and “a device for measuring noise”, and, even, later a “musical typewriter”.|$|E

40|$|Spin echo is a {{powerful}} technique to extend atomic or nuclear coherence time by overcoming the dephasing due to inhomogeneous broadening. However, applying this technique to an ensemble-based quantum memory at single-quanta level remains challenging.

By properly arranging the beam directions and optimizing the pulse fidelities, we have successfully managed to operate the spin <b>echo</b> <b>technique</b> in the quantum regime and observed nonclassical photon-photon correlations. In comparison to the case without applying the rephasing pulses, quantum memory lifetime is extended by 5 folds.
