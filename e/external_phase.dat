The transformation from unilamellar to multilamellar vesicles at higher temperature might be the characteristic for polyoxyethylene alkyl ether (ester) surfactant, since {{it is known that}} polyethylene glycol (PEG) and water remix at higher temperature due to breakdown of hydrogen bonds between water and PEG moieties.

5000|$|In chemistry, a {{suspension}} is a heterogeneous mixture containing solid particles that are sufficiently large for sedimentation. Usually {{they must be}} larger than one micrometer. A suspension is a heterogeneous mixture in which the solute particles do not dissolve but get suspended throughout {{the bulk of the}} medium. Particles of suspension are visible to the naked eye.It is when particles are left floating around freely in a solvent. The internal phase (solid) is dispersed throughout the <b>external</b> <b>phase</b> (fluid) through mechanical agitation, with the use of certain excipients or suspending agents. Unlike colloids, suspensions will eventually settle. An example of {{a suspension}} would be sand in water. The suspended particles are visible under a microscope and will settle over time if left undisturbed. This distinguishes a suspension from a colloid, in which the suspended particles are smaller and do not settle. Colloids and suspensions are different from solutions, in which the dissolved substance (solute) does not exist as a solid, and solvent and solute are homogeneously mixed. A suspension of liquid droplets or fine solid particles in a gas is called an aerosol or particulate. In the atmosphere these consist of fine dust and soot particles, sea salt, biogenic and volcanogenic sulfates, nitrates, and cloud droplets. Suspensions are classified {{on the basis of the}} dispersed phase and the dispersion medium, where the former is essentially solid while the latter may either be a solid, a liquid, or a gas. In modern chemical process industries, high-shear mixing technology has been used to create many novel suspensions. Suspensions are unstable from the thermodynamic point of view; however, they can be kinetically stable over a large period of time, which determines their shelf life. This time span needs to be measured to ensure the best product quality to the final consumer."Dispersion stability refers to the ability of a dispersion to resist change in its properties over time."
