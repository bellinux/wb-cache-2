5|$|All six {{ships of}} the class spent the {{majority}} of their careers abroad, primarily in Germany's colonial possessions <b>in</b> <b>Africa</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> Pacific. Seeadler visited the United States in March 1893, along with the protected cruiser , for the belated celebrations for the 400th anniversary of Columbus's crossing of the Atlantic. In July of that year, while assigned to the East Asia Division, Bussard and Falke assisted in the suppression of Mata'afa Iosefo's revolt in Samoa, along with a British corvette. Throughout the 1890s, Seeadler was assigned to Germany's colonies in East Africa and Southwest Africa, where she suppressed local uprisings.|$|E

Cormoran participated in the seizure of the Kiautschou Bay concession in China in 1897, and Falke was involved in the Venezuela Crisis of 1902–03. Bussard and Falke were broken up for scrap in 1912, but the remaining four ships were still in service following the outbreak of World War I in August 1914.|$|E

He continued to emphasize Pan-Africanism, black self-determination, and black self-defense.|$|E

5|$|Conquest <b>in</b> <b>Africa</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> East {{provided}} both {{wonder and}} terror to European intellectuals, as {{it led to}} the conclusion that Eden could never have been an actual geographical location. The Garden references exotic travel literature of the 15th century through the animals, including lions and a giraffe, in the left panel. The giraffe has been traced to Cyriac of Ancona, a travel writer known for his visits to Egypt during the 1440s. The exoticism of Cyriac's sumptuous manuscripts may have inspired Bosch's imagination.|$|E
5|$|Lemuriforms are {{currently}} {{thought to have}} evolved <b>in</b> <b>Africa,</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> earliest known strepsirrhine primates from Africa are azibiids from the early Eocene, which likely descended from a very early colonization of the Afro-Arabian land mass in the Paleocene (66 to 55mya). Stem lemuriforms, including Djebelemur and 'Anchomomys' milleri, {{have been found in}} Africa and date from 50 to 48 mya and were very distinct from European adapiforms. However, they lack a toothcomb. These stem lemuriforms suggest an early common ancestry with cercamoniines from outside of Europe. Based on large, procumbent lower teeth, Plesiopithecus, a fossil primate found in late Eocene deposits at the Fayum Depression in Egypt, is thought to be most closely related to lemuriforms. Together, Djebelemur, ‘Anchomomys’ milleri, and Plesiopithecus are considered to be sister taxa (the closest relatives) of lemuriform primates.|$|E

5|$|The {{assassination}} of Austria's crown prince on 28 June 1914 provided the pretext for the Austrian Empire to attack Serbia and trigger World War I. After {{four years of}} warfare, in which approximately two million German soldiers were killed, a general armistice ended the fighting on 11 November, and German troops returned home. In the German Revolution (November 1918), Emperor Wilhelm II and all German ruling princes abdicated their positions and responsibilities. Germany's new political leadership signed the Treaty of Versailles in 1919. In this treaty, Germany, {{as part of the}} Central Powers, accepted defeat by the Allies in one of the bloodiest conflicts of all time. Germans perceived the treaty as humiliating and unjust and it was later seen by historians as influential in the rise of Adolf Hitler. After the defeat in the First World War, Germany lost around 13% of its European territory (areas predominantly inhabited by ethnic Polish, French and Danish populations, which were lost following the Greater Poland Uprising, the return of Alsace-Lorraine and the Schleswig plebiscites), and all of its colonial possessions <b>in</b> <b>Africa</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> South Sea.|$|E
5|$|The political, {{social, and}} {{economic}} crises also touched {{the issue of}} who would succeed Houphouët-Boigny as head of state. After severing ties with his former political heir Philippe Yacé in 1980, who, {{as president of the}} National Assembly, was entitled to exercise the full functions of President of the Republic if the Head of State was incapacitated or absent, Houphouët-Boigny delayed {{as much as he could}} in officially designating a successor. The president's health became increasingly fragile, with Prime Minister Alassane Ouattara administering the country from 1990 onwards, while the president was hospitalised in France. There was a struggle for power, which ended when Houphouët-Boigny rejected Ouattara in favour of Henri Konan Bédié, the President of the National Assembly. In December 1993, Houphouët-Boigny, terminally ill with prostate cancer, was urgently flown back to Côte d'Ivoire so he could die there. He was kept on life support to ensure that the last dispositions concerning his succession were defined. After his family consented, Houphouët-Boigny was disconnected from life support at 6:35am GMT on 7 December. At the time of his death, Houphouët-Boigny was the longest-serving leader <b>in</b> <b>Africa</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> third in the world, after Fidel Castro of Cuba and Kim Il Sung of North Korea.|$|E
