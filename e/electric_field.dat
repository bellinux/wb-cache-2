5|$|An <b>electric</b> <b>field</b> {{generally}} {{varies in}} space, and its strength {{at any one}} point {{is defined as the}} force (per unit charge) that would be felt by a stationary, negligible charge if placed at that point. The conceptual charge, termed a 'test charge', must be vanishingly small to prevent its own <b>electric</b> <b>field</b> disturbing the main field and must also be stationary to prevent the effect of magnetic fields. As the <b>electric</b> <b>field</b> is defined in terms of force, and force is a vector, so it follows that an <b>electric</b> <b>field</b> is also a vector, having both magnitude and direction. Specifically, it is a vector field.|$|E
5|$|The {{competition}} between orientation produced by surface anchoring and by <b>electric</b> <b>field</b> effects is often exploited in liquid crystal devices. Consider {{the case in}} which liquid crystal molecules are aligned parallel {{to the surface and}} an <b>electric</b> <b>field</b> is applied perpendicular to the cell. At first, as the <b>electric</b> <b>field</b> increases in magnitude, no change in alignment occurs. However at a threshold magnitude of <b>electric</b> <b>field,</b> deformation occurs. Deformation occurs where the director changes its orientation from one molecule to the next. The occurrence of such a change from an aligned to a deformed state is called a Fredericks transition and can also be produced by the application of a magnetic field of sufficient strength.|$|E
5|$|The {{concept of}} the <b>electric</b> <b>field</b> was {{introduced}} by Michael Faraday. An <b>electric</b> <b>field</b> is created by a charged body in the space that surrounds it, and results in a force exerted on any other charges placed within the field. The <b>electric</b> <b>field</b> acts between two charges {{in a similar manner}} to the way that the gravitational field acts between two masses, and like it, extends towards infinity and shows an inverse square relationship with distance. However, there is an important difference. Gravity always acts in attraction, drawing two masses together, while the <b>electric</b> <b>field</b> can result in either attraction or repulsion. Since large bodies such as planets generally carry no net charge, the <b>electric</b> <b>field</b> at a distance is usually zero. Thus gravity is the dominant force at distance in the universe, despite being much weaker.|$|E

The measurement technique of <b>electric</b> <b>fields</b> with a DC type field mill is analyzed second, {{and then the}} antenna method for DC <b>electric</b> <b>fields,</b> currents and conductivity, and for AC <b>electric</b> <b>fields</b> is analyzed.

40|$|We {{experimentally}} {{investigated the}} effect of applied DC <b>electric</b> <b>fields</b> on the flame spread over polyethylene-coated electrical wire. The flame-spread rates over electrical wire with negative and positive DC <b>electric</b> <b>fields</b> from 0 to ± 7 kV were measured and analyzed. We compared the results for DC <b>electric</b> <b>fields</b> with previous results for AC <b>electric</b> <b>fields.</b> We explored whether or not various flame shapes could be obtained with DC <b>electric</b> <b>fields</b> and {{the main reason for}} the flame-spread acceleration, particularly {{at the end of the}} electrical wire, for AC <b>electric</b> <b>fields.</b> We found that DC <b>electric</b> <b>fields</b> do not significantly affect the flame-spread rates. However, the flame shape is mildly altered by the ionic wind effect even for DC <b>electric</b> <b>fields.</b> The flame-spread rate is relevant to the flame shape and the slanted direction in spite of the mild impact. A possible explanation for the flame spread is given by a thermal-balance mechanism and fuel-vapor jet. © 2011 The Korean Society of Mechanical Engineers...|$|R

Results showed that pulsed <b>electric</b> <b>fields</b> and heating applied in combination or individually induced permeabilization of cell membranes in the tomato fractions. However, no changes in β-carotene and lycopene bioaccessibility were found upon combined and individual pulsed <b>electric</b> <b>fields</b> and heating, except in the following cases: (i) in tissue, {{a significant decrease in}} lycopene bioaccessibility upon combined pulsed <b>electric</b> <b>fields</b> and heating and heating only was observed; (ii) in chromoplasts, both β-carotene and lycopene bioaccessibility significantly decreased upon combined pulsed <b>electric</b> <b>fields</b> and heating and pulsed <b>electric</b> <b>fields</b> only. The reduction in carotenoids bioaccessibility was attributed to modification in chromoplasts membrane and carotenoids-protein complexes. Differences in the effects of pulsed <b>electric</b> <b>fields</b> on bioaccessibility among different tomato fractions were related to tomato structure complexity. </p...|$|R
5|$|The <b>electric</b> <b>field</b> was {{formally}} {{defined as the}} force exerted per unit charge, but the concept of potential allows for a more useful and equivalent definition: the <b>electric</b> <b>field</b> is the local gradient of the electric potential. Usually expressed in voltspermetre, the vector direction of the field is the line of greatest slope of potential, and where the equipotentials lie closest together.|$|E
5|$|Faraday's and Ampère's work {{showed that}} a {{time-varying}} magnetic field acted {{as a source of}} an <b>electric</b> <b>field,</b> and a time-varying <b>electric</b> <b>field</b> was a source of a magnetic field. Thus, when either field is changing in time, then a field of the other is necessarily induced. Such a phenomenon has the properties of a wave, and is naturally referred to as an electromagnetic wave. Electromagnetic waves were analysed theoretically by James Clerk Maxwell in 1864. Maxwell developed a set of equations that could unambiguously describe the interrelationship between <b>electric</b> <b>field,</b> magnetic field, electric charge, and electric current. He could moreover prove that such a wave would necessarily travel at the speed of light, and thus light itself was a form of electromagnetic radiation. Maxwell's Laws, which unify light, fields, and charge are one of the great milestones of theoretical physics.|$|E

5|$|The {{principles}} of electrostatics are important when designing items of high-voltage equipment. There is a finite {{limit to the}} <b>electric</b> <b>field</b> strength that may be withstood by any medium. Beyond this point, electrical breakdown occurs and an electric arc causes flashover between the charged parts. Air, for example, tends to arc across small gaps at <b>electric</b> <b>field</b> strengths which exceed 30kV per centimetre. Over larger gaps, its breakdown strength is weaker, perhaps 1kV per centimetre. The most visible natural occurrence of this is lightning, caused when charge becomes separated in the clouds by rising columns of air, and raises the <b>electric</b> <b>field</b> {{in the air to}} greater than it can withstand. The voltage of a large lightning cloud may be as high as 100MV and have discharge energies as great as 250kWh.|$|E
5|$|When {{a charge}} {{is placed in}} a {{location}} with a non-zero <b>electric</b> <b>field,</b> a force will act on it. The magnitude of this force is given by Coulomb's law. Thus, if that charge were to move, the <b>electric</b> <b>field</b> would be doing work on the electric charge. Thus we can speak of electric potential {{at a certain point}} in space, which is equal to the work done by an external agent in carrying a unit of positive charge from an arbitrarily chosen reference point to that point without any acceleration and is typically measured in volts.|$|E

50|$|Honeybees {{accumulate}} {{an electric}} charge during flying and when their body parts are moved or rubbed together. Bees emit constant and modulated <b>electric</b> <b>fields</b> during the waggle dance. Both low- and high-frequency components emitted by dancing bees induce passive antennal movements in stationary bees according to Coulomb's Law. The electrically charged flagellum of mechanoreceptor cells are moved by <b>electric</b> <b>fields</b> and more strongly so if sound and <b>electric</b> <b>fields</b> interact. Recordings from axons of the Johnston's organ indicate its sensitivity to <b>electric</b> <b>fields.</b> Therefore, {{it has been}} suggested that <b>electric</b> <b>fields</b> emanating from the surface charge of bees stimulate mechanoreceptors and may play a role in social communication during the waggle dance.|$|R
40|$|The {{motion of}} polarizable bioparticles under {{the action of}} {{non-uniform}} ac <b>electric</b> <b>fields</b> is known as dielectrophoresis. Because submicrometre particles are subjected to Brownian motion, high <b>electric</b> <b>fields</b> are needed to manipulate them. However, these high <b>electric</b> <b>fields</b> give rise to fluid motion, which in turn results in a viscous drag on the particles. The <b>electric</b> <b>fields</b> generate beat, leading to gradients in conductivity, permittivity, and mass density in the fluid. These gradients give rise to electrothermal forces and buoyancy. Also non-uniform ac <b>electric</b> <b>fields</b> produce forces on the induced charges in the diffuse double layer on the electrodes, that results in fluid motion. Here we characterize these flows and their domain of influence...|$|R
40|$|As {{surveyors}} of {{the central}} nervous system (CNS), microglial cells play an integral part in the inflammatory response following traumatic injuries. Thus, they have been implicated in the limited capability of neurons to regenerate in the CNS. Additionally, the roles of endogenous <b>electric</b> <b>fields</b> in the regenerative process of neurons in the mammalian peripheral nervous system (PNS) or amphibian CNS have long been studied. Further, previous studies in our lab have shown that physiological <b>electric</b> <b>fields</b> are capable of directing behaviours in astrocytes and schwann cells. Therefore in this study, a BV- 2 microglia cell line was utilized to investigate whether microglial cells are capable of detecting <b>electric</b> <b>fields.</b> After determining whether microglia detected <b>electric</b> <b>fields,</b> the second aim was to investigate whether <b>electric</b> <b>fields</b> triggered microglial activation.

5|$|If a photon {{did have}} non-zero mass, {{there would be}} other effects as well. Coulomb's law would be {{modified}} and the electromagnetic field would have an extra physical degree of freedom. These effects yield more sensitive experimental probes of the photon mass than the frequency dependence {{of the speed of}} light. If Coulomb's law is not exactly valid, then that would allow the presence of an <b>electric</b> <b>field</b> to exist within a hollow conductor when it is subjected to an external <b>electric</b> <b>field.</b> This thus allows one to test Coulomb's law to very high precision. A null result of such an experiment has set a limit of m ≲ 10−14eV/c2.|$|E

40|$|It {{has been}} {{suggested}} that E × B mixing of magnetospheric plasma can lead to geomagnetic field aligned ionization enhancements termed whistler ducts. DC <b>electric</b> <b>fields</b> from thunderstorms have been put forward as the source of the required radial electrostatic field. Recent experimental observations have indicated that quasi-static radial thunderstorm <b>electric</b> <b>fields</b> are not responsible for duct formation. This evidence appears to be in contradiction to the current theoretical calculations. In this paper we reconsider duct formation through quasi-static thunderstorm <b>electric</b> <b>fields.</b> We find that more realistic thunderstorm charge distributions produce high altitude <b>electric</b> <b>fields</b> that are insufficient to create ducting...|$|R
5|$|Liquid {{crystals}} find wide use {{in liquid}} crystal displays, which {{rely on the}} optical properties of certain liquid crystalline substances in {{the presence or absence}} of an <b>electric</b> <b>field.</b> In a typical device, a liquid crystal layer (typically 4 μm thick) sits between two polarizers that are crossed (oriented at 90° to one another). The liquid crystal alignment is chosen so that its relaxed phase is a twisted one (see Twisted nematic field effect). This twisted phase reorients light that has passed through the first polarizer, allowing its transmission through the second polarizer (and reflected back to the observer if a reflector is provided). The device thus appears transparent. When an <b>electric</b> <b>field</b> is applied to the LC layer, the long molecular axes tend to align parallel to the <b>electric</b> <b>field</b> thus gradually untwisting in the center of the liquid crystal layer. In this state, the LC molecules do not reorient light, so the light polarized at the first polarizer is absorbed at the second polarizer, and the device loses transparency with increasing voltage. In this way, the <b>electric</b> <b>field</b> can be used to make a pixel switch between transparent or opaque on command. Color LCD systems use the same technique, with color filters used to generate red, green, and blue pixels. Chiral smectic liquid crystals are used in ferroelectric LCDs which are fast-switching binary light modulators. Similar principles can be used to make other liquid crystal based optical devices.|$|E

5|$|The {{concept of}} {{electric}} potential is {{closely linked to}} that of the <b>electric</b> <b>field.</b> A small charge placed within an <b>electric</b> <b>field</b> experiences a force, and to have brought that charge to that point against the force requires work. The electric potential at any point is defined as the energy required to bring a unit test charge from an infinite distance slowly to that point. It is usually measured in volts, and one volt is the potential for which one joule of work must be expended to bring a charge of one coulomb from infinity. This definition of potential, while formal, has little practical application, and a more useful concept is that of electric potential difference, and is the energy required to move a unit charge between two specified points. An <b>electric</b> <b>field</b> has the special property that it is conservative, which means that the path taken by the test charge is irrelevant: all paths between two specified points expend the same energy, and thus a unique value for potential difference may be stated. The volt is so strongly identified as the unit of choice for measurement and description of electric potential difference that the term voltage sees greater everyday usage.|$|E

40|$|The {{electrodynamic}} coupling {{between the}} auroral ionosphere and the magnetosphere {{is the main}} subject of this thesis. Satellite measurements of <b>electric</b> and magnetic <b>fields</b> and of charged particles are used to explore three distinct plasma boundaries, magnetically linked to the nightside auroral ionosphere. These boundaries are the inner edge of the plasma sheet (PS), and the inner and the outer edges of the plasma sheet boundary layer (PSBL). Strong ionospheric <b>electric</b> <b>fields</b> with amplitudes up to 400 mV/m may be observed in the subauroral ionosphere, {{in the vicinity of}} the ionospheric projection of the PS inner edge. Intense and dynamic auroral <b>electric</b> <b>fields</b> with local magnitudes up to 150 mV/m associated with upward ion beams and field-aligned currents are observed for the events treated here, at the inner and outer boundaries of the PSBL at an altitude of about 4 - 5 Earth radii, well above the acceleration region. Subauroral and auroral <b>electric</b> <b>fields</b> are the two main subjects of this thesis. Subauroral ion drifts (SAID) are associated with poleward <b>electric</b> <b>fields,</b> occurring predominantly in the premidnight region during the substorm recovery phase. The recently revealed abnormal subauroral ion drifts (ASAID) are associated with equatorward <b>electric</b> <b>fields,</b> occurring during extended periods of low auroral activity. The results indicate that the generation mechanism of SAID can neither be regarded as a pure voltage generator nor a pure current generator, but having certain characteristics of both generator types. Ionospheric feedback appears to play a major role for the development and maintenance of the SAID <b>electric</b> <b>fields.</b> The formation of ASAID is proposed to result from the proximity and interaction between different plasma boundaries of the innermost magnetosphere during extended periods of low auroral activity. The auroral <b>electric</b> <b>fields</b> observed in the upward current region at the PSBL inner and outer edges are associated with upward parallel <b>electric</b> <b>fields,</b> which partially decouple the high-altitude <b>electric</b> <b>fields</b> from the ionosphere. This is in contrast to the subauroral <b>electric</b> <b>fields</b> which are coupled. Multi-point measurements provided by the Cluster mission show that the observed <b>electric</b> <b>fields</b> are highly variable in space and time, revealing various types of acceleration processes. However, they appear to be tied to the boundary where they are originally formed. A case is  presented where they are associated with large electromagnetic energy fluxes directed upward away from the ionosphere. The interaction between the magnetosphere and ionosphere, being more pronounced at plasma boundary regions, is important for the understanding of the formation and regulation of the highly structured auroral <b>electric</b> <b>fields</b> observed in the upward current region.
