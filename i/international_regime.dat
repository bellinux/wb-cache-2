25|$|There {{had been}} tension and {{conflict}} between the Arabs and the Jews, and between each of them and the British forces, ever since the 1917 Balfour Declaration and the 1920 creation of the British Mandate of Palestine. British policies dissatisfied both Arabs and Jews. The Arabs' opposition developed into the 1936–1939 Arab revolt in Palestine, while the Jewish resistance developed into the Jewish insurgency in Palestine (1944–1947). In 1947 these ongoing tensions erupted into civil war, following the 29 November 1947 adoption of the United Nations Partition Plan for Palestine which planned to divide Palestine into three areas: an Arab state, a Jewish state and the Special <b>International</b> <b>Regime</b> for the cities of Jerusalem and Bethlehem.|$|E

The Partition Plan, a four-part document attached to the resolution, provided for the termination of the Mandate, the progressive withdrawal of British armed forces and the delineation of boundaries between the two States and Jerusalem. Part I of the Plan stipulated that the Mandate would be terminated as soon as possible and the United Kingdom would withdraw no later than 1 August 1948. The new states would come into existence two months after the withdrawal, but no later than 1 October 1948. The Plan sought to address the conflicting objectives and claims of two competing movements, Palestinian nationalism and Jewish nationalism, or Zionism. The Plan also called for Economic Union between the proposed states, and for the protection of religious and minority rights.|$|E

50|$|<b>International</b> <b>regimes</b> often form in {{response}} to a need to coordinate behavior among countries around an issue. In the absence of an overarching regime, for instance, telecommunications between countries would have to be governed by numerous bilateral agreements, which would become impossibly complex to administer worldwide.

The International Monetary Fund, Biological Weapons Convention, and Kyoto Protocol are other examples of <b>international</b> <b>regimes.</b> The number of <b>international</b> <b>regimes</b> has increased dramatically since the Second World War, and today regimes cover almost all aspects of international relations that might require coordination among countries, from security issues (such as weapons non-proliferation or collective defense), to trade, finance, and investment, information and communication, human rights, the environment, and management of outer space—to name a few.|$|R

2500|$|In February 1947, Britain {{announced}} its intent {{to terminate the}} Mandate for Palestine, referring {{the matter of the}} future of Palestine to the United Nations. The hope was that a binational state would ensue, which meant an unpartitioned Palestine. Ernest Bevin's policy was premised on the idea that an Arab majority would carry the day, which met difficulties with Harry Truman who, sensitive to Zionist electoral pressures in the United States, pressed for a British-Zionist compromise. [...] In May, the UN formed a Special Committee (UNSCOP) to prepare a report on recommendations for Palestine. The Jewish Agency pressed for Jewish representation and the exclusion of both Britain and Arab countries on the Committee, sought visits to camps where Holocaust survivors were interned in Europe as part of UNSCOP's brief, and in May won representation on the Political Committee. The Arab states, convinced statehood had been subverted, and that the transition of authority from the League of Nations to the UN was questionable in law, wished the issues to be brought before an International Court, and refused to collaborate with UNSCOP, which had extended an invitation for liaison also to the Arab Higher Committee. In August, after three months of conducting hearings and a general survey of the situation in Palestine, a majority report of the committee recommended that the region be partitioned into an Arab and a Jewish state, which should retain an economic union.

40|$|The {{history of}} {{diplomacy}} can by divided in three main periods: {{one is that}} of occasional diplomacy peculiar to Middle Ages, while other belong to permane diplomacy, peculiar to modern times. But this one can be divided in two parts, too: one with a bilateral character, previos to 1 st World War, and one with a multilateral character, manifested especially after the end on 1 st World War. This third type {{is the focus of}} present paper. And it cannot be separated from the newly <b>international</b> constructs: <b>international</b> <b>regimes,</b> and <b>international</b> organizations. International instritutions the area where <b>international</b> <b>regimes</b> are belonging to – are legal constructs which provide the formal (and) legal framework for continous negotiations. They are the most visible part of the new diplomacy – the one which has a permanent character, and it has an more open face. Anyway, the most important connection {{has to do with the}} <b>international</b> institutions, <b>international</b> <b>regimes,</b> and multilateral <b>international</b> negotiations. In the era of the new diplomacy, they all have a permanent character. International institutions help international negotiations carring on; while in their turn, they provide the base for international regimes’ creation, and especially for their evolution. The international regimes’ evolution is an inseparable part of a permanent international framework. And if there is missing a permanent international framework (international organization) connected to a specific regime, this regime is a difuse one, its members have only informal relations among them, while they survey each other, looking at their behavior, but they don’t have a formal relationship among them, which could help them solving their future common interests, and protect them from their common fears. <b>International</b> <b>regimes</b> are very important in the era when evrithing touches, and influences everything. In the same time, the complexity of our present world can be successfully handeled only by common efforts made by all interested states. <b>International</b> <b>regimes</b> are made from two main parts: one regards the principles, norms, rules, and procedures peculiar to a specific international area, while the other has to do with the evolutionary process of these regimes – sustained by a permanent organizational framework, and permanent negotiations. They help their members to attain their goals in conditions of incertitude, without arriving at such a tensions as to degenerate in war.

40|$|This paper {{outlines}} {{a framework}} for analysis of aggregate effects of <b>international</b> <b>regimes</b> – and demonstrates its relevance {{in the case of}} management of plant genetic resources for food and agriculture (PGRFA) in developing countries. Whereas many regime studies have focused on the effectiveness of <b>international</b> <b>regimes</b> – where effects are measured against the norms and rules of the regimes themselves – aggregate effects of <b>international</b> <b>regimes</b> are here measured against a set of criteria developed independently of the regimes. This approach is considered relevant when two or more regimes interact with regard to an issue area, and none of them cover the totality of measures assumed necessary to solve the problems. It is also relevant when there is scope for regime conflict. The management of PGRFA comprises many issues, and in demonstrating the method, one central issue has been selected: access to PGRFA, which is crucial for food security. The paper identifies the international norms and rules pertaining to access to PGRFA in the period 1992 – 2004, overlaps in their functional scopes, and the interaction among them. From these regime constellations, assumptions on the aggregate effects for developing countries are derived. These assumptions are in turn tested in case studies from the Philippines, where the aggregate regime effects on access to PGRFA are analysed in terms of policy decisions and goal achievements. Finally, the general relevance of the findings for other developing countries is discussed. A key conclusion is that the aggregate effects of the <b>international</b> <b>regimes</b> in question were largely detrimental to access to PGRFA in developing countries throughout the period studied – despite other intentions behind the individual agreements. The result of these developments is an emerging anti-commons tragedy: a situation where multiple actors have the possibilities to exclude each other from access to these vital resources. ...|$|R
