25|$|One of the {{disadvantages}} {{of the staff}} and ticket system {{is that it is}} very inflexible. If a locomotive fails in a station, for example, a token staff may be at the wrong end of a section and will have to be moved by road. This situation does not occur under the <b>Electric</b> <b>Token</b> System (ETS), a more advanced system in which tokens can be obtained at either end of a section from a token instrument.|$|E
2500|$|Since {{its opening}} on 1 July 1880, the single line between [...] and Oban was worked by the <b>electric</b> <b>token</b> system, {{this being the}} first ever {{application}} of that system in everyday service.|$|E
2500|$|Oban Goods Junction S.B. {{closed on}} 4 May 1969. Oban Station S.B. closed on 5 December 1982, when a 'no signalman' system of <b>electric</b> <b>token</b> working was {{introduced}} on the section from [...] signal box. The last remaining semaphore signals were removed at that time, including the signal gantry.|$|E

50|$|The Ffestiniog Railway {{operates}} on the <b>Electric</b> <b>Token</b> System (ETS) using {{a mixture of}} miniature and large train staffs, under the overall control of the Duty Controller based at Porthmadog.|$|E
50|$|The signal box, {{which had}} 15 levers, was {{situated}} on the island platform. From its opening in 1894, the West Highland Railway was worked throughout by the <b>electric</b> <b>token</b> system.|$|E
50|$|From {{the time}} of its opening in 1894, the West Highland Railway was worked {{throughout}} by the <b>electric</b> <b>token</b> system. Crianlarich signal box was situated {{at the north end of}} the island platform.|$|E
50|$|The train staff working {{was also}} {{replaced}} by single line <b>electric</b> key <b>token</b> working {{and at this}} time a three-lever ground frame gave the porter control of {{the up and down}} distant signals and the gate bolts (which were interlocked).|$|R
50|$|The <b>electric</b> key <b>token</b> {{instrument}} for the block section to Yeovil are now {{operated by the}} train crew {{under the supervision of}} the signal operator based at Yeovil Pen Mill. The block section to Dorchester West is operated under the 'tokenless single line' principle with track circuiting.|$|R
5000|$|Originally {{the line}} was {{operated}} under [...] "one engine in steam" [...] arrangements, but {{in the twentieth century}} the <b>electric</b> train <b>token</b> system was used, with a signal box at Calne; this closed on 2 November 1964 when freight working was discontinued, and the working arrangement reverted to one engine in steam.|$|R
50|$|From {{the time}} of its opening in 1894, the West Highland Railway was worked {{throughout}} by the <b>electric</b> <b>token</b> system. Garelochhead signal box, which had 18 levers, was situated on the island platform.|$|E
50|$|The signal box, {{which had}} 15 levers, was {{situated}} on the Up platform. From {{the time of its}} opening in 1894, the West Highland Railway was worked throughout by the <b>electric</b> <b>token</b> system.|$|E
50|$|Throughout its existence, {{signalling}} on the Ballachulish Branch {{used the}} <b>electric</b> <b>token</b> system. Appin signal box was {{located on the}} Down platform, {{on the west side}} of the railway. It had 24 levers.|$|E
25|$|Restoration of the {{passenger}} service in 1941 led to provision of <b>electric</b> train <b>token</b> signalling; an intermediate instrument was provided at Brixton Road to recess goods trains there, and a two lever ground frame was provided at Yealmpton. After the second closure, the signalling reverted to one engine in steam on 11 October 1952.|$|R
5000|$|At {{the present}} time, working from Coombe Junction to Looe is by train staff under [...] "one train only" [...] regulations. The <b>electric</b> train <b>token</b> between Liskeard and Coombe Junction has a key {{attached}} {{to operate the}} ground frame at Coombe Junction, so that the junction points there can be operated by the train crew.|$|R
5000|$|Phillips {{states that}} at first the line was {{operated}} on the [...] "one engine in steam" [...] principle, with the run-round and yard points at Lyme Regis being operated by a key on the train staff; and that in 1906 Tyers no. 6 instruments were installed, enabling <b>electric</b> train <b>token</b> working, with two sections meeting at Combpyne.|$|R
50|$|Throughout its existence, the Ballachulish Branch was {{worked by}} the <b>electric</b> <b>token</b> system. Ballachulish signal box was located {{west of the}} platforms, {{on the north side}} of the railway. It had 21 levers.|$|E
5000|$|Since {{its opening}} on 1 July 1880, the single line between [...] and Oban was worked by the <b>electric</b> <b>token</b> system, {{this being the}} first ever {{application}} of that system in everyday service.|$|E
50|$|From {{the time}} of its opening in 1894, the West Highland Railway was worked {{throughout}} by the <b>electric</b> <b>token</b> system. Arrochar & Tarbet signal box, which had 17 levers, was situated on the island platform.|$|E
50|$|The {{single track}} of the Bodmin branch was {{controlled}} by an electric train staff until 28 December 1950, after which an <b>electric</b> key <b>token</b> was used. Signalling on the branch was removed on 27 March 1968, after which points were operated by independent levers. The connection from the main line into the exchange siding is operated by a lever frame {{under the supervision of}} Lostwithiel signal box.|$|R
50|$|The {{single track}} of the Bodmin branch was {{controlled}} by an electric train staff until 28 December 1950, controlled by Bodmin Road Signal Box, after which an <b>electric</b> key <b>token</b> was used. Signalling on the branch was removed on 27 March 1968, after which points were operated by independent levers. After Bodmin Road Signal Box was closed on 30 May 1985, the lever frame controlling access to the Bodmin and Wenford Railway is now operated {{under the supervision of}} Lostwithiel signal box.|$|R
25|$|All {{sections}} between Bridgnorth and Bewdley North operate {{using the}} Tyer's <b>Electric</b> Train <b>Token.</b> Both Arley and Hampton Loade signal boxes can be switched out when not {{required by the}} service, reducing wear on the mechanics and {{reducing the number of}} signalmen required to operate the line. Arley yard may be accessed with the signal box switched out due to the presence of an intermediate token instrument, which also enables a train to depart from or terminate in the yard when the 'box is switched out.|$|R
50|$|From {{the time}} of its opening in 1901, the Mallaig Line was worked {{throughout}} by the <b>electric</b> <b>token</b> system. Mallaig signal box was situated south of the station, {{on the east side of}} the line.|$|E
50|$|From {{the time}} of its opening in 1894, the West Highland Railway was worked {{throughout}} by the <b>electric</b> <b>token</b> system. Shandon signal box, which had 15 levers, was situated {{at the south end of}} the island platform.|$|E
5000|$|In 1967, {{the method}} of working between Crianlarich and [...] was changed to the Scottish Region Tokenless Block system. In August 1985, {{the method of}} working between Crianlarich and Rannoch reverted to the <b>electric</b> <b>token</b> block system.|$|E
500|$|The railway {{is single}} track, so special {{measures}} {{have to be}} taken to prevent collisions. Before preservation, the railway operated a [...] "one engine in steam" [...] policy, but with growing passenger numbers it became necessary to install passing loops and a more stringent method of single line control was introduced. The line is worked by <b>Electric</b> Key <b>tokens,</b> which authorise the driver to enter a section of single line, and these are interlocked to prevent more than one token being withdrawn for a section at any one time. There is a loop at Pendre, which was used from the opening of the railway for shunting purposes, and further loops were installed at Brynglas in 1953 and Quarry Siding in 1963. When the Nant Gwernol extension opened in 1976, Abergynolwyn also became a passing loop. Between Abergynolwyn and Nant Gwernol the line is controlled by staff and ticket operation, which is controlled by the Abergynolwyn Blockman when on Duty.|$|R
5000|$|The station {{marks the}} end of the single line section from Whitehaven, which is {{operated}} using the <b>electric</b> key <b>token</b> system. From here the line southwards towards Ravenglass and Barrow is double track, except for the final section between Park South Junction (south of [...] ) and Barrow, also single since the late 1980s. The station track configuration is unusual in that the southbound ('up' line) is bi-directional through the station and has platform faces on both sides (though only the western one is actually used, the other side being fenced off) - this allows trains from the south to terminate here & turn back without having to enter the single line section to St Bees. The signal box controlling the layout is located {{at the north end of}} the station, whilst the plant exchange sidings and loco depot used by DRS freight trains are to the south. Two water cranes are sited at the station (one at each end).|$|R
50|$|The entire railway {{is one of}} {{the most}} {{comprehensively}} signalled heritage railways. With the exception of the connection at Kidderminster to Network Rail metals (which uses a colour light signal) the whole railway is signalled using GW style lower quadrant signals, of both metal and wooden pole/arm types (Exceptionally, the down starter at Highley has a rare concrete post). Each station (not including halts) has a signal box, with Bewdley having two boxes (North and South), due to the size of the layout there (Bewdley originally being a junction station).All sections between Bridgnorth and Bewdley North operate using the Tyer's <b>Electric</b> Train <b>Token.</b> Both Arley and Hampton Loade signal boxes can be switched out when not required by the service, reducing wear on the mechanics and reducing the number of signalmen required to operate the line. Arley yard may be accessed with the signal box switched out due to the presence of an intermediate token instrument, which also enables a train to depart from or terminate in the yard when the 'box is switched out.|$|R
