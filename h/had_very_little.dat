5|$|The {{history of}} vigilante {{justice and the}} Montana Vigilantes began in 1863 in what {{was at the time}} a remote part of eastern Idaho Territory. Vigilante {{activities}} continued, although somewhat sporadically, through the Montana Territorial period until the territory became the state of Montana on November 8, 1889. Vigilantism arose because territorial law enforcement and the courts <b>had</b> <b>very</b> <b>little</b> power in the remote mining camps during the territorial period.|$|E
5|$|There is some {{confusion}} {{as to who}} actually produced The Velvet Underground & Nico. Although Andy Warhol was the only formally credited producer, he <b>had</b> <b>very</b> <b>little</b> direct influence or authority over the album beyond paying for the recording sessions. In fact, several other individuals {{who worked on the}} album are often mentioned as the album's technical producer.|$|E
5|$|Andorra's first {{official}} game was a 6–1 defeat {{in a friendly}} match to Estonia in 1996. Since the qualifying rounds for the UEFA Euro 2000 tournament, Andorra have competed in qualifying for every European Championship and World Cup but have <b>had</b> <b>very</b> <b>little</b> success. They have only ever won five matches, four of them at home. They have two wins in competitive matches, 1–0 wins against Macedonia in the 2006 FIFA World Cup qualifying competition and against Hungary in the 2018 FIFA World Cup qualifying competition.|$|E

5|$|Because {{of their}} concerns, Aflaq kept quiet. But to his astonishment, keeping quiet {{caused him to}} lose his post as Secretary General – Aflaq was succeeded as Secretary General of the National Command by Munif al-Razzaz, a Jordanian of Syrian origin. However, the power between the two camps was {{unexpectedly}} reshuffled when Amin al-Hafiz defected to Aflaq's camp. In contrast to other military officers al-Hafiz <b>had</b> <b>very</b> <b>little</b> influence within or outside the party. Al-Hafiz's defection led to a resurgence of activity within Aflaq's faction, al-Bitar and Umran were brought back from Spain {{to form a new}} government.|$|E
5|$|From January to April 1916, Kippenberger {{underwent}} {{basic training}} at Trentham Military Camp {{as part of}} the 12th Reinforcement of the NZEF. On 1 May, he embarked for Europe to join the New Zealand Division. However, during transit his transport ship was unexpectedly diverted to Egypt. For two months, his contingent was based at the training camp of the Australian Imperial Force at Tel-el-Kebir but <b>had</b> <b>very</b> <b>little</b> to do with only a few hours of training each day. The 12th Reinforcement left in July for Sling Camp in England, where it underwent more intense training.|$|E
5|$|In {{the decades}} after Otto Jesse's death in 1901, {{there were few}} new {{insights}} into the nature of noctilucent clouds. Wegener's conjecture, that they were composed of water ice, was later shown to be correct. Study was limited to ground-based observations and scientists <b>had</b> <b>very</b> <b>little</b> knowledge of the mesosphere until the 1960s, when direct rocket measurements began. These showed {{for the first time that}} the occurrence of the clouds coincided with very low temperatures in the mesosphere.|$|E

5|$|The 1983 Atlantic {{hurricane}} season {{was the least}} active Atlantic {{hurricane season}} in 53years, during which only four tropical storms formed. The season officially began on June 1, 1983, and lasted until November 30, 1983. These dates conventionally delimit the period of each year when most storms form in the Atlantic basin. The season <b>had</b> <b>very</b> <b>little</b> activity, with only seven tropical depressions, four of which reached tropical storm strength or higher. This led to the lowest Accumulated Cyclone Energy count since 1950, but not since 1900.|$|E
5|$|Baird and Jackie {{were asked}} to visit Lennon at Kenwood which was his home in Weybridge in 1964. Cynthia Lennon—Lennon's wife at the time—took them both out {{shopping}} in Knightsbridge, buying them expensive clothes. During the same visit, The Beatles played at the Finsbury Park Astoria, and the sisters asked {{to be allowed to}} stand near the front, but had to be pulled out of the audience by security guards because of the crush. In December 1965, Dykins was killed in a car crash at the bottom of Penny Lane. Lennon was not told about his death for months afterwards. Dykins had married again, but Baird acknowledges that she and Jackie <b>had</b> <b>very</b> <b>little</b> contact with his wife, and did not attend their father's funeral.|$|E
5|$|HMS Glatton {{was derived}} from the design of the first breastwork monitors, but sacrificed the rear turret for thicker armour and larger guns with which to attack enemy ports. She was given a deep draught to improve her seaworthiness, but her low {{freeboard}} meant that she <b>had</b> <b>very</b> <b>little</b> ability to weather head seas. HMS Hotspur was similar in layout to Glatton, but she was given more freeboard by the addition of an unarmoured structure above her waterline armour belt. Designed as a ram, Hotspur was given a fixed turret with four gun ports as a rotating turret was not thought capable of withstanding the shock of impact. HMS Rupert was an enlarged version of Hotspur, but used a Glatton-type turret instead of the fixed turret and thicker armour than the older ship. The two Conqueror-class ships were enlarged versions of Rupert with heavier guns, thicker armour and a steel hull.|$|E

5|$|He married Julia Stanley in 1938. John {{was their}} only child together, but as Alf was often away at sea during World War II, {{he did not see}} much of his child during his infancy. During this period, Julia became {{pregnant}} with another man's child. He offered to look after his wife, their child and the expected baby, but Julia rejected the idea. He <b>had</b> <b>very</b> <b>little</b> contact with his son until Beatlemania, when they met again, but later had only intermittent contact with each other. He died in Brighton, where he had gone to live after marrying 19-year-old Pauline Jones, with whom he had two sons.|$|E
5|$|Roman {{occupation}} {{of what is}} now southern Scotland seems to have <b>had</b> <b>very</b> <b>little</b> impact on settlement patterns, with Iron Age hill forts and promontory forts in the south and Brochs and wheel houses in the north, continuing to be occupied in the Early Medieval period. The study of place names and archaeological evidence indicates a pattern of early Medieval settlement by the Picts, most densely around the north-east coastal plain; early Gaelic settlement was predominately in the western mainland and neighbouring islands. Anglian settlement in the south-east reached into West Lothian, {{and to a lesser extent}} into south-western Scotland. Later Norse settlement was probably most extensive in Orkney and Shetland, with lighter settlement in the Western Islands.|$|E
5|$|The Germans <b>had</b> <b>very</b> <b>little</b> {{in the way}} {{of heavy}} weapons, as they had {{discarded}} most of their artillery and machine guns due to lack of ammunition. Despite the chronic ammunition shortage von Lettow-Vorbeck was able to move four machine guns up close to the rifle pits, using them only at close range to ensure his ammunition would not be wasted. The inexperience of the Portuguese proved to be their downfall; despite their firing over 30,000 rounds, German casualties were extremely light, including only one casualty among their officers. Taking heavy casualties, having lost their commanding officer, and finding themselves hopelessly outnumbered, the Portuguese finally surrendered {{despite the fact that they}} had enough military supplies to continue the action.|$|E

Near the {{beginning}} of the season, Nocentini rode to a podium finish and a seventh place, respectively, at the Gran Premio dell'Insubria-Lugano and the similarly named Gran Premio di Lugano the next day. Ravard also took a seventh place that day, at Kuurne–Brussels–Kuurne. In March, Mondory rode to sixth place at Le Samyn. Later in March, Hinault took eighth at the E3 Prijs Vlaanderen – Harelbeke, a race dominated by 's Fabian Cancellara. The next day, Mondory took the team's best result in a single-day race which counted towards the UCI World Tour rankings by finishing fifth at Gent–Wevelgem.|$|E
5|$|By about 1864, {{both sides}} {{regarded}} the ship {{as a white}} elephant; Welles wrote in his diary that he would rather have the money than the ship and Webb was spending more money than he could anticipate from the contract. Nonetheless, he continued work on the Dunderberg as he <b>had</b> <b>very</b> <b>little</b> other work for his shipyard and, most importantly, {{in the hope of}} getting his contract amended to allow him to make a profit. On 22 July 1865, he launched the ship, now with her hull complete and about half of her armor installed, with much fanfare. The New York Times estimated a crowd of 20,000 watched the launching. The following year, the government rejected offers by Peru and Chile to purchase the ship, both then at war with Spain, lest the sale prejudice its lawsuit against Great Britain for selling warships to the Confederacy. Webb did manage to get a private bill passed by Congress in March 1867 that allowed him title to the ship once he repaid all monies advanced to him.|$|E
5|$|Operation PBHISTORY was {{an effort}} by the CIA to analyze {{documents}} from the Árbenz government to justify the 1954 coup after the fact, in particular by finding evidence that Guatemalan communists had been {{under the influence of}} the Soviet Union. Due to the quick overthrow of the Árbenz government, the CIA believed that the administration would not have been able to destroy any incriminating documents, and that these could be analyzed to demonstrate Árbenz's supposed Soviet ties. The CIA also believed this would help it better understand the workings of Latin American communist parties, on which subject the CIA <b>had</b> <b>very</b> <b>little</b> real information. A final motivation was that international responses to the coup had been very negative, even among allies of the U.S., and the CIA wished to counteract this anti-U.S. sentiment. The operation began on 4 July 1954 with the arrival of four CIA agents in Guatemala City, led by a specialist in the structure of communist parties. Their targets included Árbenz's personal belongings, police documents, and the headquarters of the Guatemalan Party of Labour.|$|E

5|$|Spirited Away was {{released}} theatrically in Japan on 20 July 2001 by distributor Toho, grossing ¥30.4 billion {{to become the}} highest-grossing film in Japanese history, according to the Motion Picture Producers Association of Japan. It {{was also the first}} film to earn $200 million at the worldwide box office before opening in the United States. The film was dubbed into English by Walt Disney Pictures, under the supervision of Pixar's John Lasseter. The dubbed version premiered at the Toronto International Film Festival on 7 September 2002 and was later released in North America on 20 September 2002. Spirited Away <b>had</b> <b>very</b> <b>little</b> marketing, less than Disney's other B-films, with at most, 151 theaters showing the film in 2002. After the 2003 Oscars, it expanded to as many as 714 theaters. The film grossed US$4 million in its opening weekend and ultimately grossed around $10 million by September 2003. In addition to its North American earnings of $10 million and Japanese earnings of $250 million, it grossed a further $29 million from other countries for a worldwide total of about $289 million. In Argentina, it's in the Top 10 of anime films with the most tickets sold.|$|E
5|$|The Hiroshima {{mission was}} {{followed}} by another atomic strike. Originally scheduled for 11 August, it was brought forward by two days to 9 August owing to a forecast of bad weather. This time, a Fat Man nuclear weapon was carried by B-29 Bockscar, piloted by Major Charles W. Sweeney. Enola Gay, flown by Captain George Marquardt's Crew B-10, was the weather reconnaissance aircraft for Kokura, the primary target. Enola Gay reported clear skies over Kokura, {{but by the time}} Bockscar arrived, the city was obscured by smoke from fires from the conventional bombing of Yahata by 224 B-29s the day before. After three unsuccessful passes, Bockscar diverted to its secondary target, Nagasaki, where it dropped its bomb. In contrast to the Hiroshima mission, the Nagasaki mission has been described as tactically botched, although the mission did meet its objectives. The crew encountered a number of problems in execution, and <b>had</b> <b>very</b> <b>little</b> fuel by the time they landed at the emergency backup landing site Yontan Airfield on Okinawa.|$|E
5|$|The {{selected}} {{project was}} a spin-off {{that was being}} developed by an inexperienced team under director Kazuhiro Aoyama. The spin-off was originally intended to introduce a new character {{who would have to}} escape from an infected Raccoon City. However, after the promotion, Capcom decided that Resident Evil protagonist Jill Valentine would be the main character and Raccoon City would be destroyed. Unlike the majority of the early scripts in the series, the scenario of the game was not created by Capcom's Flagship studio but by internal Capcom writer Yasuhisa Kawamura, who <b>had</b> <b>very</b> <b>little</b> experience with the Resident Evil series at the time. Kawamura noted that he had to play the original game to familiarize himself with the series' fictional universe immediately. Nevertheless, the story was proofread and sanctioned by Flagship to avoid continuity errors with other installments in the series, an issue that was also given attention in monthly meetings between all directors and producers.|$|E
