40|$|Much public {{attention}} and considerable controversy surround pharmaceutical marketing practices {{and their impact}} on physicians. However, views on the matter have largely been shaped by anecdotal evidence or results from analyses with <b>insufficient</b> <b>controls.</b> Making use of a dynamic fixed-effects distributed lag regression model, we empirically assess the role that two central components of pharmaceutical marketing practices (namely, detailing and sampling) have on physician prescribing behavior. Key differentiating features of our model include its ability to (i) capture persistence in the prescribing process and decompose it into own-growth and competitive-stealing effects, (ii) estimate an unrestricted decay structure of the promotional effects over time, and (iii) control for physician-specific effects that, if not taken into account, induce biased coefficient estimates of detailing and sampling effects. Based on pooled time series cross-sectional data involving three drugs, 24 monthly observations, and 74, 075 individual physicians (more than 2 million observations in total), we find that detailing and free drug samples have positive and statistically significant effects on the number of new prescriptions issued by a physician. However, we find that the magnitudes of the effects are modest. pharmaceutical marketing, salesforce effectiveness...|$|E
40|$|The {{continued}} reliance {{of manual}} data capture in engineering asset intensive organisations highlights {{the critical role}} played by those responsible for recording raw data. The potential for data quality variance across individual operators also exposes the need to better manage this particular group. This paper evaluates {{the relative importance of}} the human factors associated with data quality. Using the theory of planned behaviour this paper considers the impact of attitudes, perceptions and behavioural intentions on the data collection process in an engineering asset context. Two additional variables are included, those of time pressure and operator feedback. Time pressure is argued to act as a moderator between intention and data collection behaviour, while perceived behavioural control will moderate the relationship between feedback and data collection behaviour. Overall the paper argues that the presence of best practice procedures or threats of disciplinary sanction are <b>insufficient</b> <b>controls</b> to determine data quality. Instead those concerned with improving the data collection performance of operators should consider the operator’s perceptions of group attitude towards data quality, the level of feedback provided to data collectors and the impact of timepressures on procedure compliance.

In this appendix, we briefly respond to two primary criticisms which do not merit in-depth discussion in the main text: first, that our results are spurious due to <b>insufficient</b> <b>controls</b> for differences between states with high and low minimum wages; and second, {{that the effects of}} the minimum wage are seen in the “wrong ” industries (namely, those with a relatively low prevalence of minimum wage earners). 1 Spurious effects due to unobserved differences Dube [2013], Allegretto, Dube, Reich, and Zipperer [2013], and other papers written by this set of authors dismiss results contradicting their own by asserting that researchers who find such (negative) effects have failed to control sufficiently for unobserved heterogeneity between states. Dube argues that “states that have raised the minimum wage [by] more {{over the past several decades}} are systematically different from other states.

40|$|Social Engineering (SE) threats have {{constituted}} a reality for Information Technology (IT) systems for many years. Yet, even the latest {{editions of the}} generally accepted Information Security (IS) standards and best practices directives do not effectively address the Social Engineering aspect of IS defences. SE attacks target the human element of IS by exploiting human relations to the maximum possible extent. The social relations between interacting individuals {{who are involved in}} an Information Security Management System (ISMS) structure, combined with the frequently unpredictable fashion that humans act and react to stimuli, provide opportunities that Social Engineers may and do exploit. In the ongoing effort against Social Engineering attacks, if the social elements of IS are ignored, fallacious working assumptions may be made. These inadvertently result in the creation of <b>insufficient</b> <b>controls</b> against identified SE threats. Hence, simply put, Information Security scientists {{can no longer afford to}} ignore the nature of the social structures that govern all aspects of human relations, and in particular those that lie within the context of an ISMS.

This constitutes part of a larger effort by the authors to systematically identify and subsequently cater for SE threats to IS, in the context of which the social foundations of IS are examined.

40|$|Estimation of {{the host}} range of {{entomophagous}} biological control agents (parasitoids and predators) is complex. It is not always possible to inoculate all test organisms with eggs or neonates to determine “physiological suitability”. We argue that, for the host range testing of parasitoids, {{it is important to}} initially employ test procedures that will maximize the probability that the test species will be accepted for oviposition. This is vital to ensure that our testing methods do not generate data with a false impression of host specificity. No-choice tests are generally thought to maximize the expression of host range. The main reason for this may be increases in readiness to oviposit induced by host deprivation per se and/or associated changes in egg load, which has the potential to counteract any effects of prior experience. Sequential no-choice tests should only be used with caution as they have the potential to produce false negative results if the period of access to the lower ranked host is insufficient to allow time dependent changes in responsiveness of the parasitoid to become apparent, or if <b>insufficient</b> <b>controls</b> are utilized. Choice tests including the target host have the potential to mask the acceptability of lower ranked hosts, thereby producing false negative results. Examples where wider host ranges have been expressed in no-choice tests than in choice tests, and vice versa are presented. Sufficient variation exists that we recommend that researchers routinely use both assay methods for host range testing of parasitoids and predators...|$|E

Although the treatment process {{has been used for}} decades, it still remains in the realms of pseudoscience. If the claims of treating water with magnets are true, the process offers improvements on many of our applications of water in today's world. A large number of peer reviewed journal articles have reported contradictory claims about the treatment. Some of the most beneficial claimed water applications from magnetically treated water include improvement in scale reduction in pipes and enhanced crop yields with reduced water usage. Today we are still unsure whether the technology works and those who do believe it works are still trying to understand the mechanisms of how it works. Many research papers are starting to develop similar theories behind the mechanism of the treatment. From previous studies, it has been determined that the most successful MTD's are those with alternating poles. The majority of the experiments performed during this research were determined to have <b>insufficient</b> <b>controls</b> to produce conclusive results. The conclusions from this research were focused on designing improved experiments to provide more conclusive results. A theory was developed to explain the MTD's mechanisms of scale reduction.

40|$|The Philadelphia {{chromosome}} (Ph 1), {{present in}} [ges] 95 % of chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML) patients, is a well-characterized translocation {{that results in}} a unique chimeric gene product (BCR/ABL) with transforming capability. Molecular methods utilizing the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) to detect BCR/ABL mRNA transcripts has been useful for detecting minimal residual disease (MRD) after treatment, {{as well as for}} establishing the diagnosis of CML. Amplification-based assays for the BCR/ABL transcript, however, have shown variable reproducibility and sensitivity. This variability may be largely due to technical differences and <b>insufficient</b> <b>controls.</b> In this report, we describe the development of a highly controlled, reproducible, and sensitive PCR assay to detect Ph 1 that is well suited to clinical and research applications. A validation study of 82 samples was performed consisting of 25 dilutions of K 562 cells (Ph 1 +) into normal cultured B cells, 26 pre- and post-transplant peripheral blood samples from CML patients, 16 peripheral blood samples for diagnosis of CML, and 15 peripheral blood samples from healthy individuals. RNA isolated from 3 to 5 million leukocytes was reverse transcribed (RT) and amplified by nested primer PCR. The products were characterized using agarose gel electrophoresis. Approximately 1000 Ph 1 -positive cells admixed with 106 normal cells were detectable after one round of amplification. In 60 % of assays where one Ph 1 -positive cell was admixed with 106 normal cells, a BCR/ABL product was detectable after nested primer PCR. Specific measures to ensure accurate results in routine testing included (a) assessing RNA integrity and adequate cDNA preparation by detection of the constitutively expressed ABL mRNA, (b) monitoring sensitivity with the addition and detection of K 562 RNA mixed with RNA from unknown samples (failure to detect the "spiked" K 562 RNA indicates the presence of inhibitors or ribonucleases within the unknown RNA sample), (c) detection of nucleic acid contaminants by using negative controls in every assay, and (d) duplicate analysis of all samples and controls. Internally, this assay was 100 % reproducible. Our results verify that nested primer RT-PCR is a fast, sensitive alternative to cytogenetic or Southern blot analysis for monitoring MRD after treatment and for diagnosis of CML. In addition, the highly controlled detection scheme presented here {{can be used as a}} general model for the development of other amplification-based detection assays...|$|E
40|$|The {{board of}} {{directors}} at a company usually comprises both executive and non-executive directors. Their role is to run and direct the company for its benefit since it is incapable of acting by itself. Where there is a separation of ownership and control it is recognised {{that there is a}} risk that those in control may use their power for self-interested means. Attention is often focused on the executive directors and how legal controls and governance mechanisms can reduce the possibility of self-interest in the performance of their functions. However, seldom are non-executives the focus of this problem yet they are playing an increasingly important role in the running and governance of the company. This thesis is an investigation in to whether the legal rules and governance mechanisms are suitable in reducing the possibility of self-interest amongst non-executive directors. The study uses multiple directorships as a proxy for non-executive self-interest to demonstrate whether the controls and incentives are suitable. It begins by examining the nature of a nonexecutive’s fiduciary liability to the company focusing on the nature and purpose of the duty to identify when and why the duty is owed. Identifying the nature and purpose of the duty will allow the thesis to demonstrate that existing authority and academic literature on the scope of a non-executive’s fiduciary duty is an unsuitable interpretation based on the company’s current objects and reanalyses it {{from the perspective of the}} non-executive’s undertaking on the board. Whilst the analysis concludes that this interpretation would offer a suitable scope in deterring self-interest the thesis continues by examining the enforcement of fiduciary duties by considering the new statutory derivative claim. This analysis reveals that enforcement is low and may reduce the deterrence the fiduciary duties themselves might have. With low levels of enforcement the thesis turns its attention to ex ante incentives, particularly corporate governance mechanisms, which can “nudge” the non-executive in to acting for the benefit of the firm. This analysis contains a review of the corporate governance theories and an empirical study to identify the ways non-executive self-interest may be reduced. The theoretical analysis considers the ways boards may be structured to reduce the potential for self-interested behaviour. Using multiple directorships as a proxy for self-interest the empirical analysis provides evidence as to whether they are in fact perquisite consumption and identifies possible means of control. It is considered herein that there are <b>insufficient</b> <b>controls</b> and incentives on non-executive behaviour, which may lead to increased self-interest to the detriment of the company...|$|E
