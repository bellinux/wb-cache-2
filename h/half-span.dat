5|$|Experiments {{showed the}} need for {{only a small number}} of design changes, mainly {{involving}} the wing profile and positioning. To improve high-alpha performance, the leading edge of the wing was drooped, especially on outer sections, a dog-tooth was introduced at about <b>half-span</b> to control spanwise flow, and the entire wing given a slight negative camber which helped control trim drag and pitch-up. The area rule principle, made public in 1952, was also applied to the design. This resulted in several changes including the addition of a tailcone, sharpening the radar nose profile, thinning the intake lips, and reducing the cross-sectional area of the fuselage below the canopy.|$|E
25|$|Following {{closely to}} the winning formula that Levavasseur had {{introduced}}, the Antoinette V introduced a revised undercarriage, with a closely spaced pair of mainwheels {{at the rear of}} a carriage/skid which extended forward of the propeller, a tail-skid attached to the lower fin framework prevented damage to the tail section. Lateral stability on the ground was provided by outrigger wheels supported by a wire-braced framework at about <b>half-span.</b>|$|E
25|$|The 703 was a wood framed {{aircraft}} {{covered with}} a mixture of plywood and fabric. Its cantilever mid-mounted wing had a single spar and an associated D-box, skinned in plywood, formed the leading edge. The wing was fabric covered behind the spar. The leading edge was straight from root to tip, with slight sweep-back. From root out almost to <b>half-span</b> the wing tapered in plan only gently but further out, where the trailing edge was entirely formed by the aileron the wing tapered more strongly to a rounded tip. The NACA-derived airfoil provided a high maximum lift coefficient and small pitching moments and the wing had washout to avoid tip stall. There were Schempp-Hirth style airbrakes mounted on the rear of the spar in the central section, extending above and below the wing. On the first two 703s the central sections were set with strong (6.5°) dihedral and the outer section with none, forming a gull wing. The third 703 had the same wing but with constant dihedral from root to tip.|$|E
40|$|AbstractObjectiveTo {{analyze the}} {{structure}} of aquaporins- 3 (AQP- 3) from Schistosoma japonicum(SJAQP- 3) using bioinformatical methods, and to provid of references for vaccine targets research. MethodsProtparam, BepiPred, TMHMM Server, MLRC, Geno 3 d, DNA star software packages were used to predict the physical and chemical properties, hydrophilicity plot, flexibility regions, antigenic index, surface probability plot, secondary structure, and tertiary structure of amino acid sequence of SJAQP- 3. ResultsSJAQP- 3 had six transmembrane regions and two <b>half-spanning</b> helices that form a central channel. The <b>half-spanning</b> helices fold into {{the centre of the}} channel. Either of the <b>half-spanning</b> helix had a conserved motif of NPA common to all aquaporins. Predicted linear B-Cell epitopes were most likely at the N-terminal amino acid residues of 5 aa- 7 aa, 59 aa- 62 aa, 225 aa- 230 aa, 282 aa - 288 aa, 294 aa - 298 aa and 305 aa - 307 aa area. 59 aa- 62 aa, 225 aa- 230 aa located outside the membrane, the others located inside the cell. ConclusionsSJAQP- 3 is a integral membrane protein in Schistosoma japonicum tegument. There are six potential epitopes in SJAQP- 3. It might be a potential molecular target for the development of vaccines...|$|R

2500|$|The Parasol has {{conventional}} three-axis controls, including <b>half-span</b> ailerons. The main {{landing gear}} is bungee-suspended and the tail has a steerable skid. Brakes were optional and taxiing the aircraft without them was described as [...] "a little tricky".|$|E
2500|$|The LF-1 is a {{parasol wing}} {{monoplane}} with a high-set tailplane, {{powered by a}} Zündapp Z 9-092 engine delivering , able to operate from a [...] airstrip. The two-piece wings are set at 16° dihedral and are supported {{by a pair of}} v cabane struts and v-struts either side from approx <b>half-span</b> to the lower centre fuselage. Full span leading edge slats extend automatically and full span trailing edge flaps / drooping ailerons can be extended manually by the pilot. The fixed tailwheel undercarriage attaches to the fuselage with long struts and oleo pneumatic shock absorbers.|$|E
2500|$|The Clen Antú was a pure {{tailless}} glider, {{a flying}} wing {{apart from a}} central accommodation pod. It had a high aspect ratio (about 17) wing, swept at 23.67o at quarter chord, with no vertical airfoil surfaces. [...] The chord decreased along the span to 20% of the root value at the tip, and the wing carried a dihedral of about 3.5o. Broad chord tabbed control surfaces filled the trailing edge from the tip to about <b>half-span</b> and airbrakes were fitted. The accommodation pod was narrow but tall, providing fully instrumented tandem dual control positions. [...] The forward pilot sat in a glazed cockpit on the wing near its leading edge, with the second seated in his own enclosed cockpit stepped above and behind the first. Aft of the cockpits the plywood pod ended in a flat oval shape which provided some yaw stability. The pod continued below the wing containing a tandem pair of wheels with brakes at the rear and skids below the nose.|$|E
2500|$|Apart {{from the}} greater span, {{the wing of}} the Jantar 2 {{differed}} only from that of its predecessor by having less taper and a slight change of plan. [...] The leading edge remains straight and slightly swept, but the inner <b>half-span</b> has no sweep on the trailing edge, with the ailerons mounted on the forward swept edge of the outboard part. The wing construction {{is similar to that}} of the Jantar 1, all glass fibre with a single spar and glass cloth/foam sandwich skin. [...] There are mid-chord Schempp-Hirth airbrakes which extend both above and below the wing. [...] Its camber changing flaps are hingeless; instead the movement is provided by deflection of the upper wing surface. [...] Combined with a carefully sealed sliding joint in the lower surface, these elastic flaps minimise loss in lift due to leakage and abrupt shape changes. [...] The first two prototypes had two piece wings but later aircraft have further wing divisions at about 2.5m (8ft) from the wing tips for easier handling.|$|E
2500|$|The JetStar has {{a fairly}} typical {{business}} jet design layout, with a swept wing and a cruciform tail. The wing has a 30° sweepback and features large fuel tanks at about <b>half-span,</b> extending some distance {{in front and}} behind the wing. [...] The wings hold 10,000 pounds of fuel, and each slipper tank holds 4,000 pounds of fuel for a total fuel load of 18,000 pounds. [...] The wing also includes leading edge flaps (not slats) along {{the front of the}} wing outboard of the tanks (these leading edge flaps reduce the stalling speed by an additional three knots), while double-slotted trailing edge flaps span the entire rear surface inboard of the ailerons. [...] The wing incorporates inflatable rubber deicing boots for the removal of accumulated inflight ice. The horizontal stabilizer is mounted nearly halfway up the fin to keep it clear of the engines' jet blast. One feature is that the horizontal stabilizer is trimmable by pivoting the entire tail fin and stabilizer assembly, which has a distinctive unpainted area {{at the base of the}} fin that is noticeable in most pictures. The JetStar does not have any tail deicing capability, nor was it required for certification. [...] A speed brake is located on the underside of the fuselage to aid deceleration for landing. The original prototypes used a tricycle landing gear with one wheel per leg, but after an accident in 1962 the nose gear was modified with two tires.|$|E
