5|$|Death for <b>desertion</b> was {{abolished}} in 1930 over objections in the House of Lords from Lords Allenby and Plumer, two of {{the most}} distinguished British commanders of World War One; calls for its restoration in World War Two were vetoed on political grounds.|$|E
5|$|The Nationality Act of 1940 {{provided}} for {{loss of citizenship}} based on foreign military or government service, when coupled with citizenship in that foreign country. This statute also mandated loss of citizenship for <b>desertion</b> from the U.S. armed forces, remaining outside the United States in order to evade military service during wartime, or voting in a foreign election. The provision calling for loss of citizenship for foreign military service was held by the Supreme Court not to be enforceable without proof that said service had been voluntary, in a 1958 case (Nishikawa v. Dulles), and revocation of citizenship as a punishment for <b>desertion</b> was struck down that same year in another case (Trop v. Dulles).|$|E
5|$|After the Gibraltar hearings, Mary Celeste {{continued}} in service under new owners. In 1885, her captain deliberately wrecked her {{off the coast of}} Haiti, as part of an attempted insurance fraud. The story of her 1872 abandonment has been recounted and dramatized many times, in documentaries, novels, plays and films, {{and the name of the}} ship has become a byword for unexplained <b>desertion.</b>|$|E
50|$|The {{unit was}} plagued by <b>desertions.</b> Still, some 545 men from the Chasseurs {{accompanied}} Comte d'Estaing in his attack on Savannah. The white counterpart to the Chasseurs, the Grenadiers-Volontiers, nominally a battalion-sized unit originally and even more plagued by <b>desertions,</b> provided 156 men.|$|R
5000|$|New York {{suffered}} 44,913 <b>desertions</b> by the war's end, Pennsylvania recorded 24,050, with Ohio reporting <b>desertions</b> at 18,354. About 1 out of 3 deserters {{returned to}} their regiments, either voluntarily or after being arrested and being sent back. Many of the <b>desertions</b> were by [...] "professional" [...] bounty men, men who would enlist to collect the often large cash bonuses and then desert {{at the earliest opportunity}} to repeat another enlistment elsewhere. If caught they would face execution; otherwise it could prove a very lucrative criminal enterprise.|$|R
5000|$|In 1861 and 1862, the war {{was going}} badly for the Union Army and there were, by some counts, 180,000 <b>desertions.</b> In 1863 and 1864, the bitterest {{two years of the}} war, the Union Army {{suffered}} over 200 <b>desertions</b> every day, for a total of 150,000 <b>desertions</b> during those two years. This puts the total number of <b>desertions</b> from the Union Army during the four years of the war at nearly 350,000. Using these numbers, 15% of Union soldiers deserted during the war. Official numbers put the number of deserters from the Union Army at 200,000 for the entire war, or about 8% of Union Army soldiers. About 1 out of 3 deserters returned to their regiments, either voluntarily or after being arrested and being sent back. Many of the <b>desertions</b> were by [...] "professional" [...] bounty men, men who would enlist to collect the often large cash bonuses and then desert at the earliest opportunity to do the same elsewhere. If not caught and executed, it could prove a very lucrative criminal enterprise.|$|R
5|$|Any counterattack or {{relief effort}} {{contemplated}} by the South Vietnamese was doomed {{by the thousands}} of refugees that took to the roads in order to escape the fighting. <b>Desertion</b> among South Vietnamese units became common, as soldiers began disappearing from the ranks in search of family members. This pattern was to become too common as the offensive continued, not just among the territorial forces, but among the regular troops.|$|E
5|$|Before the Reformation, the {{extensive}} prohibited degrees of kinship, {{up to the}} fourth degree through consanguinity, meant that most noble marriages necessitated a papal dispensation. This could later be used as grounds for annulment if the marriage proved politically or personally inconvenient, {{although there was no}} divorce as such. After the mid-sixteenth century the prohibited degrees were reduced to those in Leviticus 13: 4–13, which limited them to relationships in the second degree of kinship. Separation from bed and board continued to be allowed in exceptional circumstances, usually adultery, and under the Reformed Kirk divorce was allowed on grounds of adultery or <b>desertion.</b> Scotland {{was one of the first}} countries to allow <b>desertion</b> as legal grounds for divorce and, unlike England, where divorce necessitated and act of parliament, divorce cases were initiated relatively far down the social scale.|$|E
5|$|Beginning in May, {{the brigade}} endured 112 {{consecutive}} days of skirmishes, comprising 86 separate clashes with the enemy. Though {{most of the}} skirmishes were small, {{by the end of}} the period, injuries and <b>desertion</b> had cut the regiment's strength by 25%. Ross was captured in late July at the Battle of Brown's Mill, but was quickly rescued by a successful Confederate cavalry counterattack.|$|E
50|$|The Battle of Alexandria {{was fought}} on July 31, 30 BC between {{the forces of}} Octavian and Mark Antony during the Final War of the Roman Republic. Although Antony's side was plagued by <b>desertions,</b> he still managed to {{narrowly}} defeat the Roman forces. The <b>desertions</b> continued, however, and, in early August, Octavian launched a second, ultimately successful, invasion of Egypt.|$|R
5000|$|... 22 February, a {{brigadier general}} {{defected}} in Idlib with 200 of his soldiers. In March, General Adnan Farzat {{from the city}} of Rastan and two other generals defected. Turkish government sources reported that same month a surge in <b>desertions</b> with 20,000 <b>desertions</b> in the past month alone bringing the total number of deserters from the Syrian army to over 60,000 soldiers.|$|R
2500|$|Several <b>desertions</b> to the légion de Panetier - Amalgamated {{into the}} le régiment de Bourbon ...|$|R
5|$|Brock {{arrived in}} Canada {{with the rest}} of the 49th foot and was {{initially}} assigned to Montreal. Almost immediately, in 1804 he was faced with one of the primary problems in Canada: <b>desertion.</b> Seven soldiers stole a boat and fled across the river (and border) into the United States. Despite having no jurisdiction on American soil, Brock sent a party across the border in pursuit and the men were captured.|$|E
5|$|Due to {{high rates}} of <b>desertion</b> from 13th SS Division, Sauberzweig {{proposed}} to disarm the Bosnians in both 13th SS Division and 23rd SS Division, but Himmler instead opted to transport the 2,000 Bosnians of 23rd SS Division from Hungary to Bosnia and re-organise the remaining troops of both divisions there, with key support units from 13th SS Division centralised under IX SS Mountain Corps, which would also move to Bosnia from Hungary.|$|E
5|$|Following his discharge, Ingram re-settled in Melbourne {{and gained}} {{employment}} {{as a general}} foreman with E. A. & Frank Watts Pty Ltd, building contractors. In 1926, Ingram's marriage with his wife Jane was dissolved upon his instigation {{on the grounds of}} <b>desertion</b> on her behalf. On 10 February the following year, he married Lillian Wakeling (née Hart), a widow, at the Methodist parsonage, Malvern; the pair were later to have one son.|$|E
25|$|The Ustaše militia was {{different}} {{in almost all}} respects from the mostly conscripted Croatian Home Guard. While the Home Guard was poorly equipped and subject to mass <b>desertions</b> from late 1942 onwards, the Ustaše militia consisted of young, well equipped and indoctrinated volunteers who were loyal to Pavelić and the NDH. Although they were ill-disciplined, they liked to fight and were tough combat soldiers. It was not until mid 1944 that Ustaše militia units began to suffer from significant numbers of <b>desertions,</b> although these were never on the scale suffered by the Home Guard. As {{a result of their}} greater reliability, Ustaše militia units were used on the flanks of suspect Home Guard units fighting Partisans in order to discourage mass <b>desertions</b> during action.|$|R
50|$|At that time, the British {{army had}} been reduced to 8,000 men due to {{casualties}} caused by the Spanish, diseases and <b>desertions.</b>|$|R
50|$|<b>Desertions</b> worsened {{particularly}} after the capitulation of Italy in September 1943. For example, during October 1943, 489 men deserted from the division.|$|R
5|$|In 1913, Thorpe married Iva M. Miller, {{whom he had}} met at Carlisle. In 1917, Iva and Thorpe {{bought a}} house {{now known as the}} Jim Thorpe House in Yale, Oklahoma, and lived there until 1923. They had four children: Gail, James F., Charlotte, and Frances. Miller filed for divorce from Thorpe in 1925, {{claiming}} <b>desertion.</b>|$|E
5|$|Marriages, {{particularly}} {{higher in}} society, were often political {{in nature and}} the subject of complex negotiations over the tocher (dowry). Some mothers took a leading role in negotiating marriages, as Lady Glenorchy did for her children in the 1560s and 1570s, or as matchmakers, finding suitable and compatible partners for others. Before the Reformation, the extensive marriage bars for kinship meant that most noble marriages necessitated a papal dispensation, which could later be used as grounds for annulment if the marriage proved politically or personally inconvenient, although there was no divorce as such. Separation from bed and board was allowed in exceptional circumstances, usually adultery. Under the reformed Kirk, divorce was allowed on grounds of adultery, or of <b>desertion.</b> Scotland {{was one of the first}} countries to allow <b>desertion</b> as legal grounds for divorce and, unlike England, divorce cases were initiated relatively far down the social scale.|$|E
5|$|Mary Celeste was not {{the first}} {{reported}} case of a ship being found strangely deserted on the high seas. Rupert Gould, a naval officer and investigator of maritime mysteries, lists several such occurrences between 1840 and 1855. Whatever the truth of these stories, it is the Mary Celeste that is remembered; the ship's name, or the misspelt Marie Celeste, has become fixed in people's minds as synonymous with inexplicable <b>desertion.</b>|$|E
25|$|In 1815, {{after the}} Battle of Waterloo, {{the town was}} again put into defence. However, after {{numerous}} <b>desertions,</b> the garrison was reduced to 400 men.|$|R
25|$|Several Greek-Cypriot {{units in}} the western sector {{suffered}} badly from <b>desertions,</b> as poorly disciplined reservists abandoned their units. The Troodos line was thus poorly manned.|$|R

5|$|Scots of the Riverina, a poem {{written by}} one of Australia's most renowned writers, Henry Lawson, is set in Gundagai. The poem {{describes}} a father's anger at his son's <b>desertion</b> at harvest time and later his grief when the son dies in battle in World War I. Hay and Hell and Booligal, written by Banjo Paterson, is a humorous take on life on the flat western Riverina plan.|$|E
5|$|U.S. Marine Corps {{reconnaissance}} {{estimated that}} the Iraqi Army had amassed around 60,000 troops across the border, near the Kuwaiti town of Wafra, {{in as many as}} 5 or 6 divisions. Infantry divisions normally consisted of three brigades with an attached commando unit, although some infantry divisions could have up to eight brigades–however most infantry divisions along the border were understrength, primarily due to <b>desertion.</b>|$|E
5|$|Washington's {{victories}} wrecked the British carrot-and-stick {{strategy of}} showing overwhelming force then offering generous terms. The Americans would not negotiate for {{anything short of}} independence. These victories alone were not enough to ensure ultimate Patriot victory, however, since many soldiers did not reenlist or deserted during the harsh winter. Washington and Congress reorganized the army with increased rewards for staying and punishment for <b>desertion,</b> which raised troop numbers effectively for subsequent battles.|$|E
50|$|Janssens {{began the}} battle with 2,049 troops, and lost 353 in {{casualties}} and <b>desertions.</b> Baird began {{the battle with}} 5,399 men, and had 212 casualties.|$|R

50|$|The South Korean {{military}} {{reported an}} increase in applications for early discharge and <b>desertions,</b> and announced that all material brought onto the barracks would be screened.|$|R
5|$|While {{incurring}} significant casualties {{fighting the}} Black Legion, the Chetnik movement in eastern Bosnia {{benefited from the}} mass <b>desertion</b> of Partisans and the many pro-Chetnik coups in Partisan and volunteer detachments. Despite their lack of unity, the Chetnik movement thrived in eastern Bosnia for the reminder of 1942 because some Chetnik leaders made accommodations with the Ustaše regime and as many Chetniks and Partisans were unwilling to kill fellow Bosnian Serbs of the opposing faction.|$|E
5|$|After {{building}} boats, Lochry {{and his men}} set {{off from}} Wheeling, hoping {{to catch up with}} the main body of the expedition. Meanwhile, Clark left Major Charles Cracraft with provisions and a small group of men on Camp Three Island to await Lochry's arrival. Further down the Ohio, Clark stopped at the mouth of the Kanawha River, but again he decided to keep moving in order to prevent <b>desertion.</b> Clark left a letter fastened to a pole which instructed Lochry to keep following.|$|E
5|$|Albert of Aachen says William's second <b>desertion</b> {{occurred}} in June 1098, along with William of Grand-Mesnil, {{a relative of}} Bohemond. On the road away from Antioch, they joined Stephen of Blois, another leader of the crusade who had also fled the siege. They travelled back towards Constantinople, but on the way met Emperor Alexius I Comnenus, who was advancing to Antioch with a relief army. They convinced him of the futility of the crusader siege and the emperor turned back to Constantinople.|$|E
60|$|March 1st.--Plenty more {{butternut}} or clay-color'd escapees every day. About 160 came in to-day, a {{large portion}} South Carolinians. They generally take the oath of allegiance, and are sent north, west, or extreme south-west if they wish. Several of them {{told me that the}} <b>desertions</b> in their army, of men going home, leave or no leave, are far more numerous than their <b>desertions</b> to our side. I saw a very forlorn looking squad of about a hundred, late this afternoon, {{on their way to the}} Baltimore depot.|$|R
50|$|In October 1944, due to {{widespread}} <b>desertions,</b> about 70% of the Bosnian Muslims {{of the division}} were disarmed and transferred elsewhere. The <b>desertions</b> were {{partly due to the}} constant fighting the division had been doing since March 1944, and also due to the move of much of the division from the 'security zone' in north-east Bosnia to Zagreb. Due to advances by the Soviet Red Army and its creation of two bridgeheads over the Danube, elements of the seriously under-strength division were sent to Batina to assist in throwing the Soviets back across the Danube.|$|R
5|$|By {{the end of}} 1943 the ZNDH was 9,775 {{strong and}} {{equipped}} with 295 aircraft, having lost 61 shot down, destroyed on the ground, in accidents and five <b>desertions.</b>|$|R
