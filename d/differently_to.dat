5|$|Almost 25% {{of women}} will {{experience}} {{mental health issues}} over their lifetime. Women are at higher risk than men from anxiety, depression, and psychosomatic complaints. Globally, depression is the leading disease burden. In the United States, women have depression twice as often as men. The economic costs of depression in American women {{are estimated to be}} $20 billion every year. The risks of depression in women have been linked to changing hormonal environment that women experience, including puberty, menstruation, pregnancy, childbirth and the menopause. Women also metabolise drugs used to treat depression <b>differently</b> <b>to</b> men. Suicide rates are less in women than men (<1% vs. 2.4%), but are a leading cause of death for women under the age of 60.|$|E

Impact Time is disabled in multiplayer and the gameplay is some modes is tweaked. Single Race {{is analogous to the}} single-player version except AI drivers are replaced with other players. Online Road Rage functions <b>differently</b> <b>to</b> the offline mode. The online version is a team-based mode that supports up six players and the objective is to destroy the rival team's cars before a certain number of miles have been driven. The remaining three modes are variations on the Crash mode that can be played online and locally. Team Crush and Double Impact are both two-player modes where both players causes pileups on a Crash junction simultaneously. Team Crush is focused cooperative gameplay while Double Impact is about competing with each other. Party Crash is an eight-player score competition mode where players crash on a junction individually and their scores are compared. In April 2010, online services were shut down.|$|E
5|$|In 1828, Persian Armenia was {{annexed to}} the Russian Empire {{after the last}} Russo-Persian War, and became known as Russian Armenia. When the Russian Empire collapsed, Russian Armenia {{declared}} its independence and joined the short-lived Transcaucasian Democratic Federative Republic, together with Georgia and Azerbaijan. This unified state hardly lasted a year and was soon dissolved. Since the Republic was short-lived, it did not use any flags or symbols. Nevertheless, some historians consider a horizontal gold, black, and red tricolor, {{similar to that of}} the German flag but arranged <b>differently,</b> <b>to</b> have been the flag of Transcaucasia. The federation was dissolved on May 26, 1918, when Georgia declared its independence as the Democratic Republic of Georgia. Both Armenia and Azerbaijan declared their independence two days later, on May 28, 1918, as the First Republic of Armenia and the Azerbaijan Democratic Republic, respectively.|$|E
5|$|On 22 November 2011, {{freelance}} translator Nazerine released a fan translation patch {{of the free}} demo version of the game. The initial project involved Nazerine translating, writing, and revising the game text, while another person hacked the game so that the translated text displayed properly on the game screen. This English patch launched {{the first wave of}} western interest in the game, with several video game publications reporting on it due to the game's unusual concept. The success of this translation attracted the attention of Hato Moa herself, who then offered Nazerine the opportunity to translate the full game—and later its sequel, Holiday Star—for an official English release. The translation process of the full game was also a solo effort by Nazerine; however, Hato removed the need for hacking by directly supervising the translation, adjusting images in the game for English sentences. As the demo's English patch was made before Nazerine had access to the full version of the game, several lines of dialogue were translated <b>differently</b> <b>to</b> reflect context revealed in Bad Boys Love; for example, third-person pronouns from Kazuaki Nanaki's route implying that he had a female lover in the fan translation were replaced with gender-neutral ones in the official translation. Few dramatic changes were made, though several jokes were added in Nazerine's translations of the game that were not present in the original Japanese text. The official English version of the game was released for download on 15 February 2012. The 2014 remake has also been confirmed to have used Nazerine's translation.|$|E
