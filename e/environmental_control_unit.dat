The two major motivations of this objective are decreasing the shelter's heavy dependence on generator use and lessening the tactical vulnerabilities in operating the systems in austere environments. Furthermore, this study determines whether a portfolio of these commercial-off-the-shelf (COTS) technologies is a good financial decision and estimates its return on investment (ROI). The results of this analysis found that the technologies associated with improving insulation of deployable shelters systems have the most profound effect in reducing overall generator fuel consumption.

According to the Department of Defense (DOD), forward-deployed generators, used to provide power to base support activities, are the largest single consumer of fuel throughout the battlefield. Eighty percent of the energy provided by generators is assessed to power <b>environmental</b> <b>control</b> <b>units</b> that run incessantly due to the poor insulating properties of the structures, according to a 2010 study conducted by the Department of the Air Force Civil Engineer Support Agency.

While caregivers routinely exploit contextual information to interact mean-ingfully with {{individuals who are}} nonverbal and have severe motor impairments, access technologies to date have largely ignored context. Contextual factors include the environmental and personal factors in the model of functioning and dis-ability introduced by The World Health Organization's International Classification of Functioning, Disability and Health in 2001. We propose the use of mutual information as an objective means of measuring the impact of contextual factors on me-chanical single switch usage. We show that common performance measures (e. g. sensitivity, specificity and response time) relating to switch use can be quantitatively unified within a mutual information measure. We exemplify the use of mutual information {{in the assessment of}} switch use in the presence of selected contextual factors. This information theo-retic measure facilitates performance comparison amongst users and can potentially help in classification of contextual stimuli in terms of their impact (i. e. facilitating, barrier, neutral). Our examples with able-bodied participants and an indi-vidual with disability indicate that mutual information can be sensitive to changes in contextual factors.

The thirst for energy is jeopardizing the self-sufficiency and security of the deployed warfighter. Improvements to equipment and the employment of renewable energy systems fail to address the impact that human behavior has on energy consumption and overlooks a tremendous opportunity.

40|$|This study {{presents}} the theoretical and experimental research of an ejector expansion transcritical refrigeration system for military <b>environmental</b> <b>control</b> <b>unit</b> (ECU) applications with carbon dioxide as refrigerant. The expansion losses of an isenthalpic throttling process {{are identified as}} one of the largest irreversibilities of transcritical CO 2 refrigeration cycles, which contribute to the low efficiency of such cycles. An ejector expansion device is proposed here to recover the expansion losses and increase cycle efficiency. The ejector was chosen over other expansion work recovery devices because of its unique advantages such as simple construction and robust operation. ^ A new two-phase flow ejector simulation model is developed to investigate the effects of design parameters and operation conditions on the performance of the ejector expansion device. An experimental test setup is built to test the performance of an ejector expansion device. Experimental results are used to validate the two-phase flow ejector model. The two-phase flow ejector model can predict the mass flow rate through motive nozzle within ± 5 % and the ejector outlet pressure within ± 12 % with the experimentally determined motive nozzle and suction nozzle isentropic efficiencies. ^ A prototype transcritical CO 2 <b>environmental</b> <b>control</b> <b>unit</b> was build and tested. The unit was tested with a two-stage compressor and a single-stage compressor. Micro-channel heat exchangers were used to build the gas cooler and evaporator. The test results were used to validate an existing simulation model for transcritical CO 2 air conditioning systems. After modification, the simulation model was able to predict the cooling capacity and cooling COP within ± 10 % of the measured results. ^ A new ejector expansion transcritical CO 2 system simulation model has been developed to predict the performance of unitary air conditioners using micro-channel heat exchangers. The model is exercised to perform parametric studies of transcritical CO 2 air conditioning systems for military ECU applications as well as residential air conditioning applications. It was found that the ejector expansion device is not suitable for military applications that have an outdoor temperature as high as 48. 9 °C. For residential applications, the COP of an ejector expansion transcritical CO 2 air conditioning system can be 11 % higher than that of a basic transcritical CO 2 air conditioning system. ...|$|E
40|$|Oxy-fuel {{technology}} for CO₂ capture has largely focused on combustion characteristics {{as a driver}} towards demonstration. Impurity removal studies typically centre on the how current <b>environmental</b> <b>control</b> <b>units</b> (FGD, SCR, activated carbon beds) operate in oxy-fuel firing. However, {{it is expected that}} some removal of NOₓ and SOₓ may occur during compression of flue gas through the lead chamber process. Some commercial systems link the capture of mercury to the formation of acid condensates (as a soluble mercury salt). Mercury in compressed flue gas represents a potential corrosion risk in the processing of CO₂ from oxy-fuel combustion processes. Gas phase elemental mercury (Hg⁰) is difficult to remove from the flue gas and the level of cleaning required to prevent corrosion of cryogenic brazed aluminium heat exchangers is uncertain. This work has investigated the behaviour of gaseous Hg⁰ in pressurised oxy-fuel systems in terms of the potential capture in acidic condensates, interaction with NOₓ gases and liquid stability on de-pressurisation. The work was undertaken on an adapted laboratory scale three stage axial-piston compressor with gas and liquid sampling at pressures up to 30 bar. The main finding was that gaseous Hg⁰ reacts readily with NO₂ formed from NO oxidation at high pressure. This reaction occurred without the presence of water, either water vapour or liquid water, contrary to speculation in the literature. Without NO₂, no capture of Hg⁰ was observed in the compression system. Overall, the capture of mercury during compression occurred as a consequence of high pressure, longer residence time and concentration of NO₂. Capture rates of 100 % Hg and 75 – 83 % NOₓ were measured from the compressor exit at 30 bar g...|$|R

Purchase and delivery of fuel necessary to provide this service was responsible for an estimated $ 1. 4 billion in costs and 33 resupply convoy casualties per year {{at the peak of}} U.

It is well understood that the current semi-autonomous mode of <b>environmental</b> <b>control</b> <b>unit</b> (ECU) operation results in gener-ators operating at low average loads—and low fuel efficiency—to accommodate periodic unmanaged spikes in peak load. We propose a mechanism to reduce costs through optimal prescriptive management of these ECUs.

The analysis {{is also used to}} identify the potential con- tribution from each component to improve the overall energy efficiency of the system. Three ECUs were investigated experimentally at high ambient temperature conditions to demonstrate the feasibility of the model presented herein. The investigated ECUs have capacities of 1. 5 (5. 3 kW), 3 (10. 6 kW), and 5 (17. 6 kW) tons of refrigeration (RT). The results indicate that the largest potential to improve exergetic efficiency of each unit resides in the compressor. This is followed in order by the evaporator and the condenser in the case of 1. 5 RT and 3 RT units, whereas for the 5 RT unit, relatively high irreversibility is associated with the evaporator when compared to the compressor. The second law analysis may help to focus on the components with higher exergy destruction and quantify the extent to which modifying such components can increase the exergetic efficiency of any ECU operating in high ambient temperature environments. ...|$|E

The mechanism behind ejector-based waste heat cooling {{is very different from}} absorption or adsorption cooling technologies that are also aimed at producing heat driven cooling. The ejector cooling system is actually more closely related to vapor compression technology, in which an ejector, a waste heat source, and a liquid pump are used to replace the vapor compressor. Despite the fact that ejectors were first used in refrigeration systems almost 100 years ago, commercially available waste heat driven ejector cooling systems do not exist at this point. However, this intriguing technology continues to draw significant attention from academia, Government laboratories, and research departments in industry. Rising energy costs and the desire to utilize otherwise unused low-grade energy that becomes available as a byproduct in many processes, such as power generation, justify increased research efforts on this promising approach.
