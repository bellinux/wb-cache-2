5|$|Division 12 {{arrived at}} {{the port city of}} Da Nang at 07:00 on 20 July 1965 and was the first U.S. Coast <b>Guard</b> <b>unit</b> to be {{stationed}} in South Vietnam. The morning after their arrival five of the division's eight cutters prepared to get underway for their first patrol accompanied by the Navy destroyer , which coordinated the Market Time assets in the Da Nang area.|$|E
5|$|In 1942, Chase assumed {{command of}} the 113th Cavalry, an Iowa National <b>Guard</b> <b>unit.</b> Initially a horse-mechanized unit, the 113th Cavalry soon became fully mechanized.

5|$|In April 1861, Parker ran as a Democrat for the St. Joseph {{part-time}} city attorney. He served three one-year terms from April 1861 to 1863. The American Civil War {{broke out}} {{four days after}} Parker took office and he enlisted in a pro-Union home <b>guard</b> <b>unit,</b> the 61st Missouri Emergency Regiment. He had reached the rank of corporal {{by the end of}} the war.|$|E
50|$|States still {{oversaw the}} new National <b>Guard</b> <b>units,</b> which were {{primarily}} {{to serve in}} their own states. However, {{the federal government could}} now nationalize National <b>Guard</b> <b>units</b> and send them into other states or even other countries without the approval of the units' home states. Today, both Army National Guard and Air National <b>Guard</b> <b>units</b> exist in Ohio, and many Ohioans belong to these organizations. Members of the National Guard receive pay and other benefits, including financial assistance to attend college. A desire to serve and the various financial benefits cause many Americans to enlist in National <b>Guard</b> <b>units.</b>|$|R
25|$|The Navy's <b>Guards</b> <b>units</b> {{still had}} the 1935 design, with the {{addition}} of the Guards ribbon below, except for units which were honoured with the Order of the Red Banner and became <b>Guard</b> <b>units</b> later.|$|R
50|$|The Royal Guards {{still exist}} {{down to the}} present and serve as protectors of the Royal Family of Thailand. Today's King's <b>Guard</b> <b>units</b> serve as the Thai {{equivalent}} to the <b>guards</b> <b>units</b> of various countries.|$|R
5|$|The 102d Fighter Interceptor Wing {{lost its}} F-106s on 5 January 1988. Between January and April 1988, the wing {{converted}} to the F-15A Eagle, which it {{received from the}} 5th Fighter-Interceptor Squadron which was inactivating at Minot Air Force Base. It then resumed its alert commitment at Otis, and also established a new Detachment 1 at Loring Air Force Base, taking over for the inactivating 5th Fighter-Interceptor Squadron. The 102d was the first Air National <b>Guard</b> <b>unit</b> to be equipped with the F-15.|$|E
5|$|The {{need for}} a Puerto Rican National <b>Guard</b> <b>unit</b> became {{apparent}} to Major General Luis R. Esteves, who had served as instructor of Puerto Rican Officers for the Porto Rico Regiment of Infantry at Camp Las Casas in Puerto Rico. His request was met {{with the approval of}} the government and Puerto Rican Legislature. In 1919, the first regiment of the Puerto Rican National Guard was formed, and General Luis R. Esteves became the first official Commandant of the Puerto Rican National Guard.|$|E
5|$|Most of the {{division}} returned to New York in September 1945, and from there went to Camp Bowie, Texas. On 7 December 1945, {{the division}} was deactivated from the active duty force and its members reassigned to other Army units. The following year, on 10 September 1946, the 45th Infantry Division was reconstituted as a National <b>Guard</b> <b>unit.</b> Instead of comprising units from several states, the post-war 45th was an all-Oklahoma organization. During this time the division was also reorganized and {{as a part of}} this process the 157th Infantry was removed from the division's order of battle and replaced with the 279th Infantry Regiment.|$|E
5000|$|The Governor's Guards of Connecticut {{are four}} {{distinct}} {{units of the}} Connecticut State Guard, apart of the organized militia under the Connecticut State Militia. There are two foot <b>guard</b> <b>units</b> and two horse <b>guard</b> <b>units.</b>|$|R
25|$|General Mann {{left the}} Militia Bureau and was succeeded by Jesse McI. Carter. Mann {{became the first}} {{commander}} of the 42nd Infantry Division, nicknamed the Rainbow Division, which was composed of National <b>Guard</b> <b>units</b> from 26 states and the District of Columbia. The 42nd Division's activation was important {{because it was the}} first time National <b>Guard</b> <b>units</b> from multiple states were organized together and it was the first time smaller <b>Guard</b> <b>units</b> were formed into divisions.|$|R
50|$|Ukraine {{maintained}} until 2016 {{a number}} of <b>Guards</b> <b>units,</b> tracing their traditions to the Soviet Armed Forces. A list {{can be seen at}} List of <b>guards</b> <b>units</b> of Ukraine. There were reports in 2015 that all <b>Guards</b> <b>units</b> had been either disbanded or reformed to regular units, this was proven false as all their Soviet decorations were removed from their titles and regimental colours by 15 November the same year due to the decommunization process in Ukraine which ceased promotion and glorification of the Soviet symbols. (On August 22, 2016, the Guards titles were removed from the unit titles.) Only one brigade, the 51st, a former <b>Guards</b> <b>unit,</b> had been dissolved the year before.|$|R
5|$|On 19 October 1920, the Oklahoma State militia was {{organized}} as the 45th Infantry Division of the Oklahoma Army National Guard, and manned with troops from Arizona, Colorado, New Mexico, and Oklahoma. The division was formed and federally {{recognized as a}} National <b>Guard</b> <b>unit</b> on 3 August 1923 in Oklahoma City, Oklahoma. It was assigned the 89th Infantry Brigade of the Colorado and Arizona National Guards, and the 90th Infantry Brigade of the Oklahoma National Guard. As a consequence of these militia roots, when the division was properly organized, many of its members were marksmen and outdoorsmen from the remote frontier regions of the Southwestern United States. The division's first commander was Major General Baird H. Markham.|$|E
5|$|After his forced retirement, Peng lived alone, under {{constant}} surveillance from the Central <b>Guard</b> <b>Unit</b> of the PLA, {{accompanied by a}} secretary and a bodyguard. His wife remained in Beijing; and, due to her work as the Party secretary of Beijing Normal University, was only able to visit infrequently. Peng's guards prevented curious local farmers from visiting Peng, until Peng threatened to complain to Mao. Peng's niece, Peng Meikui, visited frequently, and the two became close. Peng {{spent most of his}} free time renovating his home, gardening, and studying Marxist theory, agriculture, and economics. Peng was not completely purged: even though he could not participate in government meetings or decision-making bodies, he still received and read all documents distributed {{to the members of the}} Politburo and State Council, which he was technically still a member of. In 1960 Peng attended the funeral of Lin Boqu.|$|E
5|$|The {{division}} {{departed for}} the Western Front in June 1918 {{to join the}} American Expeditionary Force (AEF). The division's advance detachment reached Brest, France on 8 June. In late September, the29th received orders to join the U.S. First Army's Meuse-Argonne Offensive {{as part of the}} French XVII Corps. During its 21 days in combat, the 29th Division advanced seven kilometers, captured 2,148 prisoners, and knocked out over 250 machine guns or artillery pieces. Thirty percent of the division became casualtiesâ€”170 officers and 5,691 enlisted men were killed or wounded. Shortly thereafter the Armistice with Germany was signed on November 11, 1918, ending hostilities between the Central Powers and the Allied Powers. The division returned to the United States in May 1919. It demobilized on 30 May at Camp Dix, New Jersey, though it remained an active National <b>Guard</b> <b>unit.</b>|$|E
50|$|While the Wisconsin National Guard was {{deployed}} abroad, the Wisconsin State Guard {{was organized}} to temporarily replace the Wisconsin National Guard as the designated militia of Wisconsin and {{to assume the}} duties of the National <b>Guard</b> <b>units</b> until the National <b>Guard</b> <b>units</b> returned.|$|R
50|$|In the field, the army's {{standard}} khaki uniform {{was worn}} by all Imperial <b>Guard</b> <b>units</b> from 1905 to 1945. <b>Guard</b> <b>units</b> were distinguished by a wreathed star in bronze worn on the headgear, {{in contrast to}} the plain five pointed star worn by other units.|$|R

50|$|The federalization of the National Guard during World War I left {{states with}} no means {{to protect their}} {{citizens}} against invasion, sabotage, insurrection, natural disasters, or other emergencies generally contained by the National Guard. To compensate {{for the loss of}} National <b>Guard</b> <b>units,</b> Congress passed in 1916 the National Defense Act, which permitted states to raise Home <b>Guard</b> <b>units</b> to serve as replacements for National <b>Guard</b> <b>units</b> in federal service {{for the duration of the}} war; these Home <b>Guard</b> <b>units</b> would remain under state control but could receive surplus rifles, ammunition, and other supplies from the federal government at the discretion of the Secretary of War. The New Hampshire State Guard was created in 1917, and by January 1919 consisted of one infantry regiment with a strength of 57 officers and 938 enlisted men.|$|R
