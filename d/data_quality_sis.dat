Clearly the results of any spatial analysis are {{only as good as the}} data on which it is based. There are a number of significant areas for <b>data</b> <b>quality</b> research in <b>SIS.</b> These include topological consistency; consistency between spatial and attribute data; and consistency between spatial objects' representation and their true representation on the ground. The last category may be subdivided into spatial accuracy and attribute accuracy. One approach to improving <b>data</b> <b>quality</b> is the imposition of constraints upon data entered into the database. This paper presents a taxonomy of integrity constraints as they apply to spatial database systems. Taking a cross disciplinary approach it aims to clarify some of the terms used in the database and SIS fields for data integrity management.

This thesis set out to investigate <b>data</b> <b>quality</b> in advanced meter reading (AMR) systems that are used by energy companies in Sweden today. In order to investigate <b>data</b> <b>quality,</b> a definition was suggested. The definition {{was used as a}} basis for interviewing users of AMR systems to figure out the user experience of <b>data</b> <b>quality</b> and to understand what features improve <b>data</b> <b>quality.</b> The interviews were conducted with six different users working on companies that distributes electricity and/or district heating to companies and consumers. The features improving <b>data</b> <b>quality</b> were used to assess <b>data</b> <b>quality</b> in the open source AMR system called Gurux. A redesign was proposed to improve <b>data</b> <b>quality</b> in Gurux. The <b>data</b> <b>quality</b> parameter that needed to be improved the most was data accessibility. The conclusion of this master's thesis includes that there are many systems where <b>data</b> <b>quality</b> can be improved according to the perspectives given by the interviewees. Gurux is a system that can help improve <b>data</b> <b>quality</b> by making changes suggested in this thesis...|$|R

Attempts to define <b>data</b> <b>quality</b> include lists of <b>data</b> <b>quality</b> dimensions and more comprehensive theory-based frameworks. This paper extends the semiotics-based <b>data</b> <b>quality</b> framework proposed by Shanks and Darke. In particular, it discusses the social semiotic level of the framework {{in terms of social}} construction theory, and explains the goals of shared understanding and awareness of bias. Several small case studies are used to illustrate how social level <b>data</b> <b>quality</b> problems arise in practice, the problems they lead to, and strategies for dealing with the problems. The emergence of shared understanding and an awareness of bias are important factors in sociallevel <b>data</b> <b>quality.</b> Viewpoint analysis, conflict resolution and cultural immersion are shown to be important strategies for improving social-level <b>data</b> <b>quality...</b>|$|R
