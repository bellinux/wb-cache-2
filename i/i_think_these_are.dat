Alone among the many {{witnesses}} after the 1950 conviction and imprisonment of the Hollywood Ten for contempt of Congress, Seeger refused to plead the Fifth Amendment (which would have asserted that his testimony might be self incriminating) and instead, as the Hollywood Ten had done, refused to name personal and political associations on the grounds that this would violate his First Amendment rights: [...] "I am not going to answer any questions as to my association, my philosophical or religious beliefs or my political beliefs, or how I voted in any election, or any of these private affairs. <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>these</b> <b>are</b> very improper questions for any American to be asked, especially under such compulsion as this." [...] Seeger's refusal to answer questions that violated his fundamental Constitutional rights led to a March 26, 1957, indictment for contempt of Congress; for some years, he had to keep the federal government apprised of where he was going any time he left the Southern District of New York. He was convicted in a jury trial of contempt of Congress in March 1961, and sentenced to ten 1-year terms in jail (to be served simultaneously), but in May 1962, an appeals court ruled the indictment to be flawed and overturned his conviction.|$|E

60|$|Another {{advantage}} of proceeding {{by way of}} self-government is that it tends to prevent the Communist régime, when it comes, from having that truly terrible degree of centralization which now exists in Russia. The Russians {{have been forced to}} centralize, partly by the problems of the war, but more by the shortage of all kinds of skill. This has compelled the few competent men to attempt each to do the work of ten men, which has not proved satisfactory in spite of heroic efforts. The idea of democracy has become discredited as the result first of syndicalism, and then of Bolshevism. But there are two different things that may be meant by democracy: we may mean the system of Parliamentary government, or we may mean the participation of the people in affairs. The discredit of the former is largely deserved, and I have no desire to uphold Parliament as an ideal institution. But it is a great misfortune if, from a confusion of ideas, men come to think that, because Parliaments are imperfect, {{there is no reason why}} there should be self-government. The grounds for advocating self-government are very familiar: first, that no benevolent despot can be trusted to know or pursue the interests of his subjects; second, that the practice of self-government is the only effective method of political education; third, that it tends to place the preponderance of force on the side of the constitution, and thus to promote order and stable government. Other reasons could be found, but <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>these</b> <b>are</b> the chief. In Russia self-government has disappeared, except within the Communist Party. If it is not to disappear elsewhere during a Communist revolution, it is very desirable that there should exist already important industries competently administered by the workers themselves.|$|E

6000|$|Neither {{were the}} great Roman {{families}} which flourished {{in his time}} less obliged by him than the emperor. Your lordship knows with what address he makes mention of them as captains of ships or leaders in the war; {{and even some of}} Italian extraction are not forgotten. These are the single stars which are sprinkled through the [...] "AEneis," [...] but there are whole constellations of them in the fifth book; and I could not but take notice, when I translated it, of some favourite families to which he gives the victory and awards the prizes, in the person of his hero, at the funeral games which were celebrated in honour of Anchises. I insist not on their names, but am pleased to find the Memmii amongst them, derived from Mnestheus, because Lucretius dedicates to one of that family, a branch of which destroyed Corinth. I likewise either found or formed an image to myself of the contrary kind--that those who lost the prizes were such as had disobliged the poet, or were in disgrace with Augustus, or enemies to Maecenas; and this was the poetical revenge he took, for genus irritabile vatum, as Horace says. When a poet is thoroughly provoked, he will do himself justice, how ever dear it cost him, animamque in vulnere ponit. <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>these</b> <b>are</b> not bare imaginations of my own, though I find no trace of them in the commentators; but one poet may judge of another by himself. The vengeance we defer is not forgotten. I hinted before that the whole Roman people were obliged by Virgil in deriving them from Troy, an ancestry which they affected. We and the French are of the same humour: they would be thought to descend from a son, I think, of Hector; and we would have our Britain both named and planted by a descendant of AEneas. Spenser favours this opinion what he can. His Prince Arthur, or whoever he intends by him, is a Trojan. Thus the hero of Homer was a Grecian; of Virgil, a Roman; of Tasso, an Italian.|$|E
60|$|But I am not {{primarily}} {{interested in the}} plutocrats whose vision takes so vulgar a form. I am interested in {{the same thing when}} it takes a far more subtle form, in men of genius and genuine social enthusiasm like Mr. H. G. Wells. It would be very unfair to a man like Mr. Wells to suggest that in his vision the Englishman and the American are to embrace only in the sense of clinging to each other in terror. He is a man who understands what friendship is, and who knows how to enjoy the motley humours of humanity. But the political reconstruction which he proposes is too much determined by this old nightmare of necessitarianism. He tells us that our national dignities and differences must be melted into the huge mould of a World State, or else (and <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>these</b> <b>are</b> almost his own words) we shall be destroyed by the instruments and machinery we have ourselves made. In effect, men must abandon patriotism or they will be murdered by science. After this, surely no one can accuse Mr. Wells of an undue tenderness for scientific over other types of training. Greek may be a good thing or no; but nobody says that if Greek scholarship is carried past a certain point, everybody will be torn in pieces like Orpheus, or burned up like Semele, or poisoned like Socrates. Philosophy, theology and logic {{may or may not be}} idle academic studies; but nobody supposes that the study of philosophy, or even of theology, ultimately forces its students to manufacture racks and thumb-screws against their will; or that even logicians need be so alarmingly logical as all that. Science seems to be the only branch of study in which people have to be waved back from perfection as from a pestilence. But my business is not with the scientific dangers which alarm Mr. Wells, but with the remedy he proposes for them; or rather with the relation of that remedy to the foundation and the future of America. Now it is not too much to say that Mr. Wells finds his model in America. The World State is to be the United States of the World. He answers almost all objections to the practicability of such a peace among states, by pointing out that the American States have such a peace, and by adding, truly enough, that another turn of history might easily have seen them broken up by war. The pattern of the World State is to be found in the New World.|$|E

5000|$|The {{character}} that Gerber created, Princess Sofia, {{was designed to}} be a role model for both boys and girls. Gerber stated in an article “In a world where many young girls want to dress up as princesses, Sofia could serve as a positive role model, displaying traits and learning lessons that young girls (or boys) will retain long after they trade in their gowns for other costumes.” [...] Kind, courageous, bold, and curious are just a few of the qualities Gerber wanted to give Princess Sofia in order to make a positive character. He explains “To that end, Sofia is very adventurous, and bold, and courageous, and curious. [...] She has a big heart, and she’s always ready to try new things, and she’s always ready to stand up for what she believes in or what she thinks is right. By the way, <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>these</b> <b>are</b> good qualities for both girls and boys to follow. And so there’s a feminist message. There’s also a message for both boys and girls, saying you can do anything you set your mind to if you keep trying and don’t give up - that life is an adventure.” [...] Another important element he wanted to provide her with was to make her flawed. Sometimes she could mess up dealing with issues of sibling rivalry, sharing, or trying a new thing. This was a very important message Gerber wanted to provide to his young viewers. Gerber describes Sofia’s faults as “Sofia’s biggest flaw is that she is too trusting. It will take her a long time to learn this lesson.” ...|$|E

40|$|The role {{of intellectuals}} in the labour {{movement}} in South Africa has, {{with the exception}} of an article by Johann Maree, remain unstudied (Maree, 1989). In a much neglected study titled New Men of Power the late C Wright Mills identified four different types of intellectuals involved in the American labour movement. Firstly, there were professionally trained intellectuals such as lawyers and economists who were sometimes {{on the staff of the}} union. Secondly, there were the 'party ' intellec-tuals who followed the 'line ' of the party and sought to promote it among the rank and file leaders within the unions. Thirdly there were the free-lance research intellectuals who had no foothold in the institutions of the labour movement. Fourthly, there were union-made intellectuals. 'They are', Mills said 'union thinkers, with a big job on their hands [...] . (they) are in themselves a link between ideas and action'(Mills, 1971, 285).
