As {{part of a larger}} longitudinal study that resurveyed 1, 907 households and 102 villages in 14 of Bangladesh's 64 districts, the project focused on assessing the long-term impacts of a number of anti-poverty interventions�specifically, microfinance, agricultural technology, and educational transfers� on a range of monetary and nonmonetary measures of well-being. This note focuses on the long-term impacts on men's and women's assets of disseminating agricultural technologies to individuals compared with groups. It is hoped that these results will help policymakers, donors, and other stakeholders to effectively evaluate different interventions thereby contributing to the design of future anti-poverty programs in South Asia. Among the poverty-alleviation interventions undertaken by government and civil society organizations in Bangladesh are foodbased strategies designed to increase incomes and to alleviate micronutrient deficiencies. Polyculture fish and vegetables technologies are considered to have the potential to improve both poverty and micronutrient status by increasing the supply of micronutrients to household producers and the general population, by <b>improving</b> <b>the</b> <b>incomes</b> of household producers, and by lowering or keeping constant fish and vegetable prices in the face of rising demand due to population and income growth.

40|$|A survey {{based on}} a {{structured}} questionnaire was conducted {{at the beginning of}} 1995 to identify sources of capital and income for rural households in Kavango. The survey, which covered 80 households, revealed that there was a high dependence on external income sources. Pensions were the major source of income for the highest proportion of all households (33 per cent), followed by wages (23 per cent) and brewing (10 per cent). Other sources of income of similar importance to brewing were crop sales, non-formal work and cash remittances. Livestock were a minor source of income but a major source of capital and food security. Households with smaller cattle herds depended more on cattle for income and food security than those with larger herds. Cattle were a highly valued production resource that was only consumed during times of crisis and only in the absence of less valuable assets that could be easily liquidated. Grain storage was more popular among groups with the lowest income. By various criteria, female-headed households always tended to be in the group of households categorised as the poorest of the poor. However, given sufficient income, over one third of them would purchase cattle to diversify their investment portfolio. This article presents a number of potential strategies for <b>improving</b> <b>the</b> <b>incomes</b> of rural households in Kavango. These include the promotion of equitable livestock ownership and better use of the grazing resource through community management, intensification of cropping and the implementation of labour-intensive programmes to develop rural infrastructure. ...|$|E

In particular, we evaluate {{the role of}} key public assets like rural roads in reducing transaction costs and, through that channel, in <b>improving</b> <b>the</b> <b>incomes</b> of rural households. The study presents and implements a methodological proposal to quantify transaction costs. The results show that transaction costs in the area under study equal 50 % of the sales value, being appreciably higher (60 %) for producers who {{are connected to the}} market via non-motorized tracks. Likewise, the research confirms that transaction costs are much higher for small-scale farmers than for large-scale ones (67 % versus 32 % of the sales value). The results demonstrate that besides distance and time to the market, key variables for explaining the market integration strategy (i. e. when to sell and to what market) include several indicators associated with how much experience the farmer has with the market in which he operates; how stable his relations are with the different agents he trades with, and; how much of an investment he makes to obtain relevant information and to monitor compliance with implicit contracts associated with the transactions completed. The study shows that, through lowering transaction costs, access to an improved rural road system can improved substantially the incomes of the rural poor in Peru.

40|$|By {{the end of}} 1999, an {{estimated}} 24. 5 million Africans were living with HIV/AIDS, accounting for more that seventy percent of all global infections. In Tanzania, {{an estimated}} 1. 3 million people (of a total population of 33 million) {{were believed to be}} infected with HIV, and 140, 000 had already died of AIDS. One in every 12 adults is infected. African couples have large families, partly so there will be adult children to support parents in old age. Instead, because of the AIDS epidemic, the elderly are often caring for their infected children, or orphaned grandchildren. The authors use longitudinal household data from Tanzania's Kagera region, to measure the impact of prime-age adult mortality on the level, and changes in physical well-being (as measured by body mass index, or BMI) of the elderly. They find that the elderly in non-poor households have higher BMI. Non-poor households {{are more likely to have}} an adult death, and the elderly in these households are more likely to suffer declining BMI in the months before the death of a prime-age adult. The elderly in both poor, and non-poor households experience a significant drop in BMI after an adult death, but BMI recovers over time, and there is no long-run association with BMI levels, and recent adult deaths. The elderly hit hardest are those in households nor receiving private transfers. Private transfers received by other household members raise the BMI of the elderly, especially after a recent adult death. There is no evidence that nongovernmental organizations, or public assistance to the household affects short-run changes in BMI. The elderly who have more living children are physically better off, but short-run increases in the number of teenagers in the household are associated with declines in BMI. <b>Improving</b> <b>the</b> <b>incomes,</b> and assets of the poor is key to improving the overall BMI of the elderly. The elderly who have more assets (such as better quality dwellings) tend to have higher BMI. Controlling for individual, and household characteristics, the elderly in communities with roads that are navigable year-round, have substantially higher BMI. Prevention of communicable diseases is key to reducing short-run fluctuations in BMI - through preventing HIV, and community immunization programs that benefit the elderly.

40|$|The work-style and {{the attitudes}} of many {{development}} agencies have become more commercial and business-like in recent years. Where once they focused on handpumps and health, they now also debate the issues of interest rates for small loans, the management of market information and enterprise development services. One of the pioneers and leaders in this 'get real' trend is the US-based not-for-profit agency EnterpriseWorks Worldwide the name says it all. It started life as Appropriate Technology International in 1976. By the early 1980 s, it had expanded its attention from the technology side of fuel-saving stoves, solar cookers and oilseed presses, and shifted towards the economics and politics of producing them at low cost. Soon after, it was dealing with issues of franchises, replication strategies and tax incentives for rural workshops. Value chain analysis EnterpriseWorks has now incorporated this approach into the strategy of <b>improving</b> <b>the</b> <b>incomes</b> of groups of small-scale agricultural producers (it does not support individuals directly) by adding value to the products they cultivate. It undertakes sub-sectoral analyses of the value chain of a natural product. The life of a product is mapped from cultivation through raw material production to processing and marketing, including all the costs of inputs, investments and sales. EnterpriseWorks then picks out those links in the chain where an intervention could achieve considerable financial gains for {{a large group of}} producers. In Senegal and Guinea-Bissau, the value chain analysis has shown that cashew growers can increase their returns if they sell the nuts processed instead of raw. Interventions here include the introduction of treadle pumps to improve cashew irrigation, the development of cashew processors and the training of local entrepreneurs to manufacture and sell these. EnterpriseWorks has also helped to improve marketing efficiency by linking producers with exporters and organising marketing campaigns. In Haiti, the focus lies on improving the processing and marketing of Haïtien Bleu quality coffee. In Uganda, oilseeds such as sunflower became the focal point (see Spore 99), and in Niger and Côte d Ivoire it was market gardening. The how to manual on making a value chain analysis Enterprise Development of Natural Products is downloadable from their Website at: www. enterpriseworks. org/resources. asp where you can find a good range of manuals and publications on both technology and business processes. Over the years, EnterpriseWorks has developed an impressive list of processing technologies; besides those already mentioned, these include a cassava slicer, a meat grinder and a peanut mill. EnterpriseWorks works with decentralised partner offices in Benin, Burkina Faso, Côte d Ivoire, Guinea-Bissau, Mali, Niger, Senegal, Tanzania and Uganda.
