25|$|Poseidon {{returned}} as a five-year-old {{for one last}} campaign. After finishing fifth in the RRC Rawson Stakes, <b>he</b> <b>pulled</b> <b>up</b> sore. As he would require a long spell away from the track to recover, {{the decision was made}} to retire Poseidon to stud duties.|$|E
25|$|Merritt was {{the number}} one {{qualifier}} at the 2012 Olympic Trials. Two weeks before the track and field events at the 2012 Summer Olympics, Merritt tweaked his hamstring in the Herculis meet in Monaco. As {{a result of this}} injury <b>he</b> <b>pulled</b> <b>up</b> in a qualifying heat of the 400m at the London Olympics and did not finish.|$|E
25|$|At the 2016 Skate Canada, {{he placed}} {{fourth in the}} short program, after landing his first jump on one knee, nearly putting {{his hand on the}} ice on a second and not doing a combination. In the free skating, <b>he</b> <b>pulled</b> <b>up</b> to first with a score of 183.41. Overall he {{finished}} second behind Patrick Chan, by less than 4 points, and over bronze medalist Kevin Reynolds.|$|E
6000|$|... "We don't want {{to break}} a record," [...] said <b>he,</b> <b>pulling</b> <b>up</b> and panting after {{attempting}} {{to keep up with}} Johnson for five minutes. [...] "I would go quicker if I could, my dear sir, and I quite sympathise with your anxiety, but really I can't manage it." ...|$|R
50|$|The Fellow won a race at Auteuil Hippodrome in {{the summer}} of 1994 but was well beaten in other races. This {{included}} a final effort at the King George VI Chase, where <b>he</b> was <b>pulled</b> <b>up</b> behind Algan. Ironically, that horse had the same trainer and owner as The Fellow. His last race was at Auteuil on 18 June 1995, where <b>he</b> was <b>pulled</b> <b>up.</b>|$|R
6000|$|... "Tragic, but ambiguous," [...] said <b>he,</b> <b>pulling</b> <b>up</b> the blind. [...] "Look at this--a sheet from a note-book, with 'For God's sake come at once--P. T.,' scrawled upon it in pencil. Our friend, the doctor, {{was hard}} put {{to it when}} he wrote this. Come along, my dear fellow, for it's an urgent call." ...|$|R
25|$|His one {{overseas}} tour, to New Zealand in 1955–56, was blighted by injury. In {{the first}} Test, <b>he</b> <b>pulled</b> <b>up</b> with a strained muscle {{at the start}} of his ninth over; returning for the third Test, he again was injured, this time after four balls of his ninth over. This tour saw the emergence of Tom Dewdney as a fast bowler, and King never again appeared for the West Indies.|$|E
25|$|At the 2015 Skate Canada International, {{he placed}} {{sixth in the}} short program with the score of 73.25 points after invalidating his popped quadruple toe loop into a double and {{breaking}} the Zayak Rule by executing a triple lutz-double toe loop instead of a planned triple lutz-triple toe loop. He also received a level three for his step sequence. In the free skating, <b>he</b> <b>pulled</b> <b>up</b> to second with a score of 186.29, about 4 points behind Patrick Chan, after executing three quadruple jumps including the quadruple Salchow and toe loop in the first half, and the quadruple toe loop-double toe loop. He finished second overall behind Patrick Chan and above Daisuke Murakami with a total score of 259.54.|$|E
25|$|In 2010 {{he tried}} to attack his own world record for the third {{consecutive}} time at the Dubai Marathon 2010. Although he won the race with a time of 2:06:09, he failed to break his 18-month world record. In a post-race interview he revealed that he had suffered back pain, requiring intensive pre-race physiotherapy, resulting from having slept in a bad position. His problems continued at the NYC Half Marathon, where <b>he</b> <b>pulled</b> <b>up</b> mid-race visibly uncomfortable in his running. He had an easy victory in the inaugural edition of the 10K de Madrid in April. He scored his third victory at the Great Manchester Run the following month, although he missed out on Micah Kogo's course record. He followed this with his first win at the Great North Run in September, finishing the half marathon in a time of 59:33 minutes.|$|E

6000|$|... "It isn't a {{new thing}} to us," [...] said the young fellow, with a short laugh. [...] "And there isn't much to explain about it. You'll see them all through New England. When a man finds he can't get his funeral {{expenses}} out of the land, he don't feel like staying {{to be buried in}} it, and <b>he</b> <b>pulls</b> <b>up</b> and goes." ...|$|R
60|$|<b>He</b> rose, <b>pulled</b> <b>up</b> {{the blinds}} noiselessly, {{and opened the}} windows. Neither the fresh air nor the light awoke the {{sleeping}} man.|$|R
25|$|Landing and takeoff {{accidents}} {{were common}} on the rudimentary Russian airfields {{and due to}} the Re.2000 not having a rugged landing gear, {{compared to that of}} the CR.32. After a steel plate was added behind the cockpit {{for the protection of the}} pilots, the shift in the aircraft's center of gravity led to more frequent accidents. In a much publicized mishap, 1/Lt István Horthy (the son of the Hungarian regent Miklós Horthy), serving as a fighter pilot with the Hungarian Second Army died flying a Re.2000 V-421 with 1/3 Fighter Squadron on 20 (on 18, according to other authors) August 1942, on his 25th operational sortie. After a pilot flying above asked Horthy to increase height, <b>he</b> <b>pulled</b> <b>up</b> rapidly, stalled and crashed. Nevertheless, the determined Hungarian pilots kept on flying combat missions and scoring a number of kills against the Soviet fighter, if they managed to force their Russian opponents into a dogfight, thanks to the maneuverability of the Italian built plane.|$|E
25|$|At the 2017 Four Continents Championships, Hanyu placed {{third in}} the short program with a score of 97.04 points. He popped his quadruple Salchow-triple toe loop {{combination}} to a double Salchow-triple toe loop combination. Despite this, the Olympic champion was only 6 points behind Nathan Chen (in first) and less than 3.5 points behind Shoma Uno (in second). During his free skating, he started strong with a quadruple loop and a quadruple Salchow, followed by a triple flip, but then popped his second quadruple Salchow-triple toe loop combination attempt to a double Salchow. To {{make up for lost}} points, Hanyu, in place of the planned triple Axel-double toe loop combination, performed a triple Axel-triple toe loop combination and also substituted the triple Axel-half loop-triple Salchow combination with a quadruple toe loop-double toe loop combination. The reigning Olympic champion also changed his final jumping pass from a triple Lutz to a triple Axel. In the free skating, <b>he</b> <b>pulled</b> <b>up</b> to first with a score of 206.67, but overall finished second behind Nathan Chen, by less than 4 points, and over bronze medalist Shoma Uno, by more than 15.|$|E
25|$|In {{the second}} {{meeting of the}} 2011 IAAF Diamond League at Shanghai Golden Grand Prix, Powell won the 100m {{with a time of}} 9.95 seconds. Powell next ran at the IAAF Diamond League in Rome against Usain Bolt on 26 May. Powell had a superb start and mid but he faded towards the end, only to allow the world record holder to surpass him in the final 10–12m of the race. Bolt won in 9.91s and Powell came second in 9.93s. He said that he had lost focus, but is {{confident}} about beating Usain after what he had done that day. Powell next competed in the IAAF World Challenge in Rabat, Morocco, in a low key meet. There, after running the first 20m, <b>he</b> <b>pulled</b> <b>up</b> and finished last in 36.13s, citing a precaution against a serious hamstring injury. Reports said that it was nothing serious and he would be ready for the Jamaican Trials later in the month. At the Jamaican Trials 23–24 July, Powell looked impressive as he qualified through the rounds. He posted a season best of 9.90s in his semi-final, despite easing off in the final 15m. Later, after overcoming a bad start, Powell won the final to be titled National Champion for the fifth time in his career. He won in a time of 10.08s into a 1.8m/s headwind. Yohan Blake and Steve Mullings were second and third respectively with 0.01s separating them.|$|E

500|$|A lone [...] "Zero" [...] {{emerged from}} the cloud cover below Air Group 18, {{attempting}} to sneak up on the formation from behind. Harris spotted the enemy early on and led his division down in pursuit, chasing the Japanese fighter away from the air group {{and back into the}} cloud cover from which it had appeared. Harris and company followed him down through the clouds into the open skies above Fabrica airfield, where a [...] "hornets nest" [...] of enemy planes was waiting for them. A melee ensued, causing one Zero to break ranks {{in the face of an}} attack by Burley. Burley hit his target but did not have time to verify the kill—another Zero came in from behind, forcing him to take evasive action. Fortunately, Harris was behind this second Japanese fighter and shot him down just a moment later. Flying back toward the bombers, Harris spotted a single Zero Type 32 [...] "Hamp" [...] climbing in front of him, headed in the same direction and apparently intent on attacking the bomber squadrons. Harris pulled up above the enemy and turned inside of him, putting a burst into the plane from 7 o'clock. It went down in flames. Harris then observed the pilots from his division fighting hard over the air strip, so he doubled back to render assistance. As he headed down, he was jumped from 7 o'clock, by two Hamps. <b>He</b> <b>pulled</b> <b>up</b> hard and swung left, allowing his pursuers to overshoot their runs before he tacked back to the right, putting himself above and behind them. Harris dove on his former pursuers with his guns firing, causing one plane to explode and the other to flee the scene. Once more seeking out his division, Harris approached a cluster of planes that turned out to be still more Zero 32s. Harris's Hellcat had no problem outpacing them. After he'd put enough distance between himself and the group, he looped back and approached the enemy formation head on in a low side run. His target, the last Zero in formation, exploded a mere [...] from Harris, who finally spotted some fellow Hellcats. He broke off his engagement to follow the other VF-18 pilots to the rendezvous point.|$|E
2500|$|The England {{selectors}} were sufficiently {{impressed by}} Ellcock's form {{to call him}} up for the winter tour against West Indies. However, his tour had barely begun before it was over: <b>he</b> <b>pulled</b> <b>up</b> {{after just a few}} balls in the nets, ...|$|E
2500|$|Bob Hoover {{believed}} that the rivalry of the Tu-144 and Concorde led the pilot of the Tu-144 to attempt a manoeuver that went beyond the abilities of the aircraft: [...] "That day, the Concorde went first, and after the pilot performed a high-speed flyby, <b>he</b> <b>pulled</b> <b>up</b> steeply and climbed to approximately 10,000 [...] before leveling off. When the Tu-144 pilot performed the same manoeuver he pulled the nose up so steeply l didn't believe he could possibly recover." ...|$|E

2500|$|The Transformer {{brothers}} {{also knew}} where he was, but he didn't look and just held his pole steady. The brothers came and landed {{on the side of}} the canoe. They asked the man, [...] "What are you doing?" [...] He responded, [...] "Oh, you are my grandchildren. Oh this here, this is my food that I am going to feed you with." [...] He tells the three men, [...] "I have a house right here, right there in that little bay. You bring your canoe over and come up ashore." [...] <b>He</b> <b>pulled</b> <b>up</b> his pole and had a lot of the moss ready. In the house, he had a big fire ready and a mountain of rock underneath, already hot. He took some sticks and grabbed the hot rocks and put them in a bowl that was filled with water. When the rocks were dropped in, the water began to boil. He took the boiling water and placed the moss inside and then made soup. The tells the men to have a seat on his bench with his big hyu7kem plate. This was the first hyu7kem plate made because he knew these men were coming. It made this plate really fancy, and fed them with three Mountain Goat horn spoons. The three men ate the moss.|$|E
