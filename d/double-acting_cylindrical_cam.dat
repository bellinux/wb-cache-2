40|$|The {{currently}} used method to calculate {{radius of curvature}} of a <b>cylindrical</b> <b>cam’s</b> planar expansion pitch curve produces errors. Therefore, there is an urgent need to find an accurate method for <b>cylindrical</b> <b>cam</b> design. This research utilizes the three-dimensional expansion curve coordinates of the follower’s motion track and establishes the planar expansion pitch curve equation with the consideration of deviation angle, which can be easily used to analyze and design an oscillating follower <b>cylindrical</b> <b>cam.</b> The deduced equation of radius of curvature is based on motion law of the mechanism and prime cylinder radius of the cam. The relation curve between minimum radius of curvature and prime cylinder radius, which takes into consideration that planar expansion pitch curve varies with prime cylinder radius {{in the event of}} certain motion law, is described by MATLAB, and specific minimum radius of prime cylinder is generated for each allowable radius of curvature according to the relation curve.

40|$|Abstract—This {{paper was}} aimed at {{developing}} a computer aided design and manufacturing system for spatial <b>cylindrical</b> <b>cams.</b> In the proposed system, a milling tool with a diameter smaller {{than that of the}} roller, instead of the standard cutter for traditional machining process, was used to generate the tool path for spatial cams. To verify the feasibility of the proposed method, a multi-axis machining simulation software was further used to simulate the practical milling operation of spatial cams. It was observed from computer simulation that the tool path of small-sized cutter were within the motion range of a standard cutter, no occurrence of overcutting. Examination of a finished cam component clearly verifies the accuracy of the tool path generated for small-sized milling tool. It is believed that the use of small-sized cutter for the machining of the spatial <b>cylindrical</b> <b>cams</b> can generate a better surface morphology with higher accuracy. The improvement in efficiency and cost for the manufacturing of the spatial <b>cylindrical</b> <b>cam</b> can be expected through the proposed method.

5000|$|A <b>cylindrical</b> <b>cam</b> or {{barrel cam}} is a cam {{in which the}} {{follower}} rides {{on the surface of}} a cylinder. In the most common type, the follower rides in a groove cut into the surface of a cylinder. These cams are principally used to convert rotational motion to linear motion parallel to the rotational axis of the cylinder. A cylinder may have several grooves cut into the surface and drive several followers. <b>Cylindrical</b> <b>cams</b> can provide motions that involve more than a single rotation of the cylinder and generally provide positive positioning, removing the need for a spring or other provision to keep the follower in contact with the control surface.|$|R

Instead of 2 D {{expanding}} diagram method, {{this paper}} presents a new regenerating method for cutter location paths of using smaller tools to produce <b>cylindrical</b> <b>cams.</b> According to the expected motions, cams are put to use in various applications in mechanism. For a <b>cylindrical</b> <b>cam,</b> the roller follower operates in a groove cut {{on the periphery of}} an end mill with the diameter same as the roller. By using the conventional method, full-sized cutting tools, will restrict the flexibility of choosing cutting tools for wide roller guide. The manufacture of <b>cylindrical</b> <b>cams</b> is complicate and precise work that depends on the generating method and types of machine tools employed. Since the guiding curve cannot be offset exactly along the cylindrical surface, this leads to some approximating problems. Though the tool-paths generation by using the same size tools as rollers is applied in practice, the study of NC program by unequal tools is not available to meet high precision requirement. This proposed 3 D offset-based generating method can regenerate tool-paths for standard cutting tools instead of larger ones and implemented on computerized CAM system. Examples with wider grooves are demonstrated to prove its effectiveness...|$|R

This paper presents a simple yet comprehensive method {{for the design}} and machining of a <b>cylindrical</b> <b>cam</b> with a meshing indexing disc. In the proposed methodology, homogenous coordinate transformation and conjugate surface the-ory are employed to develop a kinematic model for the cam profile design. The pressure angle and the principal curvature of the designed cam are analysed using the analytical expression derived for the profile. The requiredNC data equations are obtained by solving the CNC link vari-ables by equating the machine tool ability function with the tool location matrix.

Please report any quality issues you encounter to digital@library. tamu. edu, referencing the URI of the item. Includes bibliographical references (leaves 46 - 47). The growing technology associated with petroleum equipment has lead to an increase in electrical components used to measure, adjust and control many aspects of the petroleum extraction process. This increase in electrical use has lead to the conversion of many components from hydraulic operation to electric. Therefore, it is the purpose of this report to detail and propose an engineering solution to the electrical conversion of a surface controlled subsea safety valve (SCSSV). Preliminary analysis has resulted in the following important functional requirements that the SCSSV should operate within: Temperatures up to 350 F. Estimated operational life of 20 years. Peak available power of 4300 W (actual value will be much lower than this due to other power system drains). The three conceptual designs presented in this report are the following: Electric motor actuator with a solenoid latching detent. Linear actuation with a fluid reservoir locking valve. Rotational engagement with an electric locking clutch. After reviewing and comparing these concepts, the last concept was chosen to be further developed. This concept will have the least temperature sensitive components and fewer leak path problem areas. Upon completion of the detailed design phase an electric SCSSV solution has been proposed. The following is a brief list of the performance claims: Power requirement to open: 0. 5 W. Time required to open valve: 10 minutes. Installable inline with 4 - 1 / 2 tubing. Operating temperature range: 20 - 350 F. H?S service certified. Hold open energy requirements 0 ~ 0. 2 W. There are however practical issues that must be addressed to ensure reliable and satisfactory performance of the SCSSV. The actual efficiency of the <b>cylindrical</b> <b>cam</b> mechanism and reliability of the torque overload clutch must be empirically determined due to the number of theoretical assumptions used. Thus these items should be thoroughly tested in order to produce a reliable and satisfactory SCSSV. It is with these claims and working issue that this electrically converted SCSSV be fully developed and installed for electrical petroleum production systems...|$|R
40|$|The {{hydrodynamic}} {{properties of}} a horizontal cylinder which {{is free to}} pitch about an off-centred axis are studied and used to derive the equations of motion of a wave energy converter which extracts energy from incoming sea waves with a linear power-take-off mechanism. The present work follows from a recent study which compared the performance of an off-centred cylinder {{with those of the}} Edinburgh Duck wave energy converter. The small decrease in performance found is offset by a reduction in the likely costs associated with the manufacturing of the <b>cylindrical</b> <b>cam</b> compared with those of the asymmetric profile. As part of the survivability strategy in very energetic seas-states it had been planned to completely submerge the device so as to reduce the mooring forces. However, experiments with scale models show that a good absorption capacity is retained even when fully-submerged. The hydrodynamic properties of a horizontal cylinder that pierces the free-surface and of one that is fully submerged are therefore of central concern in this study. These properties are well known for the case of very long cylinders but they are now found for cylinders with different widths, drafts, submergence levels and water-depths. The hydrodynamic forces and moments at the off-centred axis are, furthermore, derived through the application of transformation formulae. The equation of motion of the off-centred cylinder is derived for one degree of freedom and its performance as a wave energy converter is analysed. A relationship which relates the resonance of the device with the location of the off-centred axis and its mass distribution is derived and used to optimize the design for average sea conditions attained at a real location. Design cases associated with three diameters of the cylinder are looked into detail for both a fully-submerged and free-surface piercing cylinder. The one degree of freedom model is extended to include a multi-body which has three degrees of freedom in order to describe the dynamics of a proposed wave powered desalination system based on a cylindrical Duck device. This mathematical model is derived through linearised Lagrangian equations of motion in which the hydrodynamic forces are included as generalised external forces. The advantage of such approach is {{to reduce the number of}} equations associated with multi-body systems by removing the reaction forces of holomonic constraints from the system of equations to solve. This model is validated through experiments with a scale model performed in the curved tank of the University of Edinburgh with both regular waves and mixed seas.
