The Roscoe Wind Farm in Roscoe, Texas, is one of the world's largest wind farms with a 781.5 megawatt (MW) capacity. The <b>Energy</b> <b>Information</b> <b>Administration</b> states that the state's large agriculture and forestry industries could give Texas an enormous amount biomass for use in biofuels. The state also has the highest solar power potential for development in the nation.|$|E
5|$|NuScale is {{expected}} to be the first SMR to market, because its cooling is similar to the systems used in conventional power plants. However, alternative cooling systems using molten metals are expected to operate at higher, more efficient temperatures once approved. The company estimates a twelve-unit NuScale plant would cost $5,000 per kilowatt. In comparison, the <b>Energy</b> <b>Information</b> <b>Administration</b> in 2011 estimated costs to be $4,700 per kilowatt for conventional nuclear power, $4,600 for a carbon sequestration coal plant and $931 at a gas-fired plant or in excess of $1,800 for a gas-fired plant with carbon sequestration. David Mohre, executive director of NRECA's Energy and Power Division, said SMR's like NuScale's are ideal for rural towns that need small power plants and do not have access to natural gas. NuScale power plants are also expected to take less time, materials and space to construct than other power sources and can be expanded incrementally to meet changing power needs.|$|E

40|$|This study {{examines}} {{the long and}} short run relationships between oil price and food price volatility {{as well as the}} causal link between them. The study used annual food price volatility index from FAO from 2000 to 2013 and crude oil price from U. S. <b>Energy</b> <b>Information</b> and <b>Administration</b> (EIA) from 2000 to 2013. The Johansen and Jesulius co-integration test revealed that there is a long run relationship between oil price and domestic food price volatility. The vector error correction model indicated a positive and significant short run relationship between oil price and food price volatility. The Granger causality test revealed a unidirectional causality with causality running from oil price to food price volatility but not vice versa. It is recommended that policies and interventions that will help reduce uncertainty about food prices such as improved market information, trade policies and investment in research and development among others should be encouraged. Also to reduce the effect of oil price shock, it is recommended that government should subsidise pump price of refined oil, seek alternative sources of energy and there should be less dependence on oil for fertilizer production...|$|R

40|$|The Eagle Ford play {{in south}} Texas is {{currently}} {{one of the}} hottest plays in the United States. In 2012, the average Eagle Ford rig count (269 rigs) was 15 % of the total US rig count. Assessment of the oil and gas resources and their associated uncertainties in the early stages is critical for optimal development. The objectives of my research were to develop a probabilistic methodology that can reliably quantify the reserves and resources uncertainties in unconventional oil and gas plays, and to assess Eagle Ford shale oil and gas reserves, contingent resources, and prospective resources. I first developed a Bayesian methodology to generate probabilistic decline curves using Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) that can quantify the reserves and resources uncertainties in unconventional oil and gas plays. I then divided the Eagle Ford play from the Sligo Shelf Margin to the San Macros Arch into 8 different production regions based on fluid type, performance and geology. I used a combination of the Duong model switching to the Arps model with b = 0. 3 at the minimum decline rate to model the linear flow to boundary-dominated flow behavior often observed in shale plays. Cumulative production after 20 years predicted from Monte Carlo simulation combined with reservoir simulation was used as prior information in the Bayesian decline-curve methodology. Probabilistic type decline curves for oil and gas were then generated for all production regions. The wells were aggregated probabilistically within each production region and arithmetically between production regions. The total oil reserves and resources range from a P_(90) of 5. 3 to P_(10) of 28. 7 billion barrels of oil (BBO), with a P_(50) of 11. 7 BBO; the total gas reserves and resources range from a P_(90) of 53. 4 to P_(10) of 313. 5 trillion cubic feet (TCF), with a P_(50) of 121. 7 TCF. These reserves and resources estimates are much higher than the U. S. <b>Energy</b> <b>Information</b> <b>Administration?s</b> 2011 recoverable resource estimates of 3. 35 BBO and 21 TCF. The results of this study provide a critical update on the reserves and resources estimates and their associated uncertainties for the Eagle Ford shale formation of South Texas...|$|R
