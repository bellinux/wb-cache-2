5|$|The SUPP {{attacked}} the DAP {{on the basis}} of its coalition with the Islamist PAS, arguing that “A vote for Rocket <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>vote</b> for Islamic State". Lim Kit Siang, the parliamentary leader of the DAP, said that the issue was a “killer weapon” which could “finish off” the chances of DAP's candidate winning by frightening off the Chinese and non-Muslim voters in Sibu as it did during the 1999 Malaysian General Election where both Karpal Singh and Lim himself lost their parliamentary seats. The SUPP also claimed that if the DAP was to be voted in kampua noodles could no longer be sold as they were mixed with pork lard; a reference to PAS's policy to establish Malaysia as an Islamic state.|$|E

Thorpe worked in the constituency tirelessly, using the slogan [...] "A Vote for the Liberals <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>Vote</b> for Freedom", and in the 1955 general election halved his Conservative opponent's majority. Four years later, in October 1959, he captured the seat with a majority of 362, one of six successful Liberals in what was generally an electoral triumph for the Conservative Macmillan government.|$|E
500|$|When Stewart finished, he {{went into}} the hall to find Colbert was gone to tape his show. On the set of The Colbert Report, Colbert was {{discussing}} John McCain's rise in the polls, and joked that since the media had said that [...] "a vote for Mike Huckabee <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>vote</b> for McCain", and Colbert was Huckabee's [...] "running mate," [...] then Colbert, [...] "by the transitive property of Huckabee", was really McCain. He was soon interrupted by Stewart and O'Brien, who had just left the set of The Daily Show to continue their fight. [...] Stewart jokingly claimed that, since he had [...] "made" [...] both Colbert and O'Brien, Stewart himself was McCain—clearly provoking O'Brien. After some playful attacks, Colbert persuaded the two to wait outside until he finished taping his show.|$|E

2500|$|In March 1932, Thälmann {{was once}} again a {{candidate}} for the German Presidency, against the incumbent Paul von Hindenburg and Hitler.

[...] Thälmann returned as a candidate {{in the second round of}} the election, as it was permitted by the German electoral law, but his vote count lessened from 4,983,000 (13.2%), in the first round, to 3,707,000 (10.2%). After the Nazis came to power in January 1933, Thälmann proposed that the SPD and KPD should organise a general strike to topple Hitler, but this was not achieved. In February 1933, a Central Committee meeting of the already banned KPD took place in Königs Wusterhausen at the [...] "Sporthaus Ziegenhals", near Berlin, where Thälmann called for the violent overthrow of Hitler's government. Following the Reichstag fire, on 3 March he was arrested in Berlin by the police.|$|E

2500|$|With {{an overall}} record turnout of 83.8%, a level not {{achieved}} since the 1965 presidential election when turnout was 84.8%, {{the vast majority}} of the electorate decided not to stay home.

2500|$|The {{leader of}} the Liberal Party, Lars Sponheim, stated in September 2007 that his party would neither {{be a part of}} nor support a {{coalition}} that included the Progress Party, and that the Liberal Party preferred Labour Prime Minister Jens Stoltenberg over Progress Party leader Siv Jensen. By late August, 2009 figures produced by Response suggested that only 2% within the Liberal Party wanted to collaborate with the Progress Party. Sponheim later distanced himself and his party from the Conservative Party because the Conservatives wanted to improve relations with the Progress Party, leading Sponheim to comment [...] "A vote for the Conservatives <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>vote</b> for the Progress Party".

2500|$|On April 15, 2002, the Commission {{approved}} a resolution affirming the [...] "legitimate {{right of the}} Palestinian people to resist the Israeli occupation in order to free its land {{and be able to}} exercise its right of self-determination".

Of the 53-member commission, 40 countries voted yes, five voted no, and seven abstained.

Alfred Moses, a former United States ambassador to the commission and now chairman of the monitoring group UN Watch, said that [...] "A vote in favour of this resolution <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>vote</b> for Palestinian terrorism." [...] In a letter to the UNHRC on November 15, 2002, following an attack by Palestinians on Israelis in the town of Hebron, Nabil Ramlawi, the permanent observer for Palestine at the U.N., [...] appealed to the resolution as justification for the attack.|$|E
