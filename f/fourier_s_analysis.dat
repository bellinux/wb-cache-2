Introduction. The (pseudo) Goldstone bosons arise naturally in many modern theories such as supergravity, superstring theory and variants of general relativity with torsion. In the publications of last years the following (pseudo) Goldstone bosons are discussing: arion, axion, familon, majoron etc (see review [1]) ...|$|R

40|$|We {{report the}} {{discovery}} of four massive (M > 0. 8 M_) ZZ Ceti white dwarfs, including an ultramassive 1. 16 M_ star. We obtained ground based, time-series photometry for thirteen white dwarfs from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey Data Release 7 and Data Release 10 whose atmospheric parameters place them within the ZZ Ceti instability strip. We detect mono-periodic pulsations in three of our targets (J 1053, J 1554, and J 2038) and identify three periods of pulsation in J 0840 (173, 327, and 797 <b>s).</b> <b>Fourier</b> <b>analysis</b> of the remaining nine objects do not indicate variability above the 4 〈A〉 detection threshold. Our preliminary asteroseismic analysis of J 0840 yields a stellar mass M= 1. 14 ± 0. 01 M_, hydrogen and helium envelope masses of M_H = 5. 8 × 10 ^- 7 M_ and M_He= 4. 5 × 10 ^- 4 M_, and an expected core crystallized mass ratio of 50 - 70 %. J 1053, J 1554, and J 2038 have masses in the range 0. 84 - 0. 91 M_ {{and are expected to}} have a CO core; however, the core of J 0840 could consist of highly crystallized CO or ONeMg given its high mass. These newly discovered massive pulsators represent {{a significant increase in the}} number of known ZZ Ceti white dwarfs with mass M > 0. 85 M_, and detailed asteroseismic modeling of J 0840 will allow for significant tests of crystallization theory in CO and ONeMg core white dwarfs.
