5|$|The {{episode was}} {{intended}} to be commentary on Apartheid in South Africa, using <b>gender</b> <b>role</b> reversal. However, there were problems between the cast and director during filming, and Patrick Stewart sought to have the sexist nature of the episode changed. The resulting episode was not well liked by members of the production team, and the response from reviewers was negative.|$|E
5|$|Although {{homosexuality}} among females {{has taken}} place in many cultures in history, a recent phenomenon is the development of family among same-sex partners. Before the 1970s, the idea that same-sex adults formed long-term committed relationships was unknown to many people. The majority of lesbians (between 60% and 80%) report being in a long-term relationship. Sociologists credit the high number of paired women to <b>gender</b> <b>role</b> socialization: the inclination for women to commit to relationships doubles in a lesbian union. Unlike heterosexual relationships that tend to divide work based on sex roles, lesbian relationships divide chores evenly between both members. Studies have also reported that emotional bonds are closer in lesbian and gay relationships than heterosexual ones.|$|E
5|$|When the CCP {{entered the}} First United Front to fight warlords and unite China from 1924–27 with the Guomindang (GMD), the each party {{established}} their own women’s department during this time. However, the United Front {{ended with the}} White Terror (1927), where the GMD launched an attack to purge the communists and laborers. The ideas about liberating Chinese women from Confucian values were only permitted within the territory under CCP rule. These territories were called soviets, and were the places the CCP fled to following the White Terror {{because they were not}} {{under the control of the}} GMD. The GMD championed traditional Confucian ideals about women, and they established the New Life Movement, which sought to counter the <b>gender</b> <b>role</b> espoused by the CCP with traditional Confucian gender roles supported by the GMD. The CCP's time in the soviets from 1927–1945 also gave them the opportunity to develop the skills for organizing federations and governing, which greatly facilitated the founding of the ACWF later.|$|E

25|$|Moreover, these {{characteristics}} are also seen in television programing. For example, in most prime-time television shows women receive {{twice as many}} comments about her appearance than men. Similarly, a study investigating the cartoon “Pokémon” and <b>gender</b> <b>role</b> expresses the differences in “good” and “bad” characters. Jesse and James (villains of the story) are portrayed to have adopted counter-stereotypical portrayal. While Jesse is seen as more aggressive and James as more feminine, it subtly teaches children that nontraditional or nonstereotypical <b>gender</b> <b>role</b> behaviors are bad. Furthermore, children in the story have difficultly recalling a male pokemon revealing {{that there is an}} imbalance in which prominence is given to male characters.|$|E

25|$|A {{person may}} be {{considered}} to be a transgender person if their gender identity is inconsistent or not culturally associated with the sex they were assigned at birth, and consequently also with the <b>gender</b> <b>role</b> and social status that is typically associated with that sex.

Transsexual is generally considered a subset of transgender, but some transsexual people reject being labelled transgender.|$|E
25|$|While {{atypical}} <b>gender</b> <b>role</b> development may be heritable, {{this does}} not mean that it is independent. However, environmental effects can differ largely for different genders. Because society is more accepting of male traits (girls playing soccer) than female traits (boys doing ballet), society’s negativity typically forces males to try to stay within the stereotypic norms. That being said however, male influence accounted by environmental factors that lead to atypical development is also stronger for boys than girls in terms of atypical development.|$|E
25|$|Islam differentiates the <b>gender</b> <b>role</b> {{of women}} who believe in Islam {{and those who do}} not. The Muslim male's right to own slave women, seized during {{military}} campaigns and jihad against non-believing pagans and infidels from Southern Europe to Africa to India to Central Asia, was considered natural. Slave women could be sold without their consent, expected to provide concubinage, required permission from their owner to marry; and children born to them were automatically considered Muslim under Islamic law if the father was a Muslim.|$|E
50|$|Many {{writers have}} chosen to write {{with little or no}} {{questioning}} of <b>gender</b> <b>roles,</b> instead effectively reflecting their own cultural <b>gender</b> <b>roles</b> onto their fictional world.

40|$|Sexual {{violence}} against women in India is on the rise. India’s capital city of New Delhi is referred to, by many, as the rape capital of the world. In {{the wake of the}} gang rape of a medical student in Delhi, which sparked protests nationwide, and the increasing sexual {{violence against}} women in India in general, questions have been raised regarding the stereotypical <b>gender</b> <b>roles</b> constructed in Bollywood films and item songs, song and dance sequences within Bollywood films. <b>Gender</b> <b>roles</b> portrayed in Bollywood cinema, India’s Hindi language film industry, {{and the extent to which}} they shape and reflect the society, has been subject to academic research. However, this thesis conducts a unique study by examining and deconstructing <b>gender</b> <b>roles</b> in Bollywood films through women’s empowerment development discourse. The thesis conducts content analysis of three popular Bollywood films and three item songs, through which <b>gender</b> <b>roles</b> are explored. The image of an empowered woman, portrayed by the women’s empowerment development discourse, and central components of the concept of empowerment served as analytical tools, in that they provided a contrasting image to compare the portrayal of <b>gender</b> <b>roles</b> in Bollywood films. In order to identify these <b>gender</b> <b>roles,</b> analytical tools were derived from feminist film theory of the male gaze, and the theorisation of portrayal of women and men in Bollywood films, by numerous Indian scholars. By utilising these analytical tools and the techniques provided by qualitative content analysis, <b>gender</b> <b>roles</b> in the chosen Bollywood films and item songs, and audience’s perception towards the <b>gender</b> <b>roles</b> were analysed to highlight recent trends in the portrayal of <b>gender</b> <b>roles</b> in Bollywood films, and item songs...|$|R
25|$|In some {{cultures}} of Asia, a hijra is usually {{considered to be}} neither a man nor a woman. Most are anatomically male or intersex, but some are anatomically female. The hijra form a third <b>gender</b> <b>role,</b> although they do not enjoy the same acceptance and respect as males and females in their cultures. They can run their own households, and their occupations are singing and dancing, working as cooks or servants, sometimes prostitutes, or long-term sexual partners with men.

25|$|Hepp, Milos, and Braun-Scharm {{state in}} their study on gender {{identity}} disorder and anorexia nervosa in male monozygotic twins that the correlation between childhood gender identity disorder and adult homosexuality is stronger than the correlation between childhood gender identity disorder and adult transsexualism. Cohen-Kettenis and Gooren note in their {{review of the literature}} on transsexualism that children with gender identity disorder are more likely to identify as gay or lesbian later in life, as opposed to identifying as transgender. Additionally, gay and lesbian adults report having exhibited more opposite-sex <b>gender</b> <b>role</b> behavior than heterosexual adults.|$|E
25|$|Like other trans people, {{transsexual}} {{people may}} refer {{to themselves as}} trans men or trans women. Transsexual people desire to establish a permanent <b>gender</b> <b>role</b> {{as a member of}} the gender with which they identify, and many transsexual people pursue medical interventions as part of the process of expressing their gender. The entire process of switching from one physical sex and social gender presentation to another is often referred to as transitioning, and usually takes several years. Transsexual people who transition usually change their social gender roles, legal names and legal sex designation.|$|E
50|$|The term gender binary {{describes}} {{the system in}} which a society splits its members into one of two sets of <b>gender</b> <b>roles,</b> <b>gender</b> identities and attributes based on reproductive organs. In the case of people born with organs that fall outside this system (intersex people), enforcement of the binary usually includes coercive surgical <b>gender</b> reassignment. <b>Gender</b> <b>roles</b> are a major aspect of the <b>gender</b> binary. <b>Gender</b> <b>roles</b> shape and constrain an individual's life experiences, impacting aspects of self-expression ranging from clothing choices to occupation. Traditional <b>gender</b> <b>roles</b> continue to be enforced by the media, religion and educational, political and other cultural and social systems. Major religions such as Islam and Catholicism, in particular, act as authorities for <b>gender</b> <b>roles.</b> Islam, for example, teaches that mothers are the primary care givers to their children and Catholics only allow cisgender men to serve as their priests.|$|R
40|$|Aim: This {{study was}} {{conducted}} with the aim to determine point of view of final-year university students at Hacettepe University on <b>gender</b> <b>roles</b> regarding work life, social life, marriage and family life. Methods: This study is a cross-sectional study. The questionnaire was applied to a total of 448 students including 250 females and 198 males. Results: The results of the study reveal that views of students on <b>gender</b> <b>roles</b> related to work life, social life, marriage and family life exhibit statistically significant differences among the sexes for most of the statements given. Conclusions: It was identified that male students have more traditional views on <b>gender</b> <b>roles</b> related to work and marriage life. It was identified that female and male students have more egalitarian views on <b>gender</b> <b>roles</b> related to social and family life. The results of the study are important in that views on <b>gender</b> <b>roles</b> are revealed among most university students. The finding that university students still have a traditional perspective on social <b>gender</b> <b>roles</b> indicates that universities has failed to a certain degree in achieving its goal toward educating intellectual and open-minded individuals, and it reveals the need for sensitiveness in equality of <b>gender</b> <b>roles</b> besides the acquirement of professional knowledge...|$|R

25|$|Kelly and Hauck's {{research}} found that divisions of labor within a same-sex relationship {{can not be}} viewed as setting a precedent as to what gender roles are normal. A female partner in a same-sex relationship may perform chores that are considered feminine, like cooking, cleaning, and child rearing. However, the other female partner may perform chores that are considered masculine, like outside work and employment outside of the home. The partners’ behaviors do not support gender roles because all the roles performed are done by women. There is not an inherent distinction made between masculine and feminine because women are performing both types of chores. This lack of <b>gender</b> <b>role</b> discrimination would be true in same-sex relationships between two men as well.|$|E
25|$|Since the 18th century, {{the civic}} {{dimension}} of gender identity has been eclipsed by the sexual dimension of gender identity, and, today, effeminacy {{has often been}} considered a vice, indicative of other negative character traits and often involving a pejorative insinuation of homosexual tendencies in boys or men. In other societies, by contrast, effeminate boys or men may be considered a distinct human gender (third gender), and may have a special social function, {{as is the case}} of Two-Spirits in some Native American groups. Furthermore, some see effeminacy to be a characteristic or trait, part of a particular person's <b>gender</b> <b>role</b> and in this sense would not be considered a vice or indicative of any other characteristics. An effeminate boy or man is similar to a fop or a dandy, though these tend to be archaic identities that are taken on by the individual rather than insulting labels.|$|E
25|$|Sibling’s {{influence}} is often {{most effective when}} the sibling is of an age that is more advanced than the child himself, therefore increasing the motivation {{for the child to}} model after their brother or sister. The impact of older siblings are power predictors for the younger sibling’s <b>gender</b> <b>role</b> attitudes, sex-typed personality qualities, and masculine leisure activities. Findings suggest that girls develop less traditional attitudes than boys, thus, relative to stereotypically traditional development, older male siblings are more conscientious towards masculine activities, which are evidently modeled after by younger siblings more than feminine activities. Moreover, older brothers tend to have stronger influence over a younger sibling’s sexual development. There is evidence that the relationship between older brother and younger sister can, in fact, influence the sister to become more feminine, abiding to more stereotypical gender-typed development than girls with older sisters. Interestingly, biological studies show that dizygotic twins with the opposite- sex co-twin gender show more sex-typed behaviors than same-sex twins.|$|E

25|$|The {{effects of}} Western {{capitalist}} systems {{of development and}} culture makes flexibility in gender and labor roles more difficult than the indigenous cultures historical way of living off of the land. “Indigenous women’s entry into the money economy has been analyzed as making their domestic and subsistence work evermore dispensable to the reproduction {{of the labor force}} and thus reducing women’s power within the family. Indigenous men have been 	forced by the need to help provide for the family in the globalized capitalist economic system that favors paid economic labor while depending on female subordination and unpaid subsistence labor. These ideals are internalized by many workers and imported back into the communities.” This capitalistic infiltration harmed <b>Gender</b> <b>role,</b> they were becoming more and more restrictive and polarized with the ever-growing imposition of external factors on indigenous communities.

25|$|Increasingly emancipated German-speaking Jews {{wanted to}} immerse {{themselves}} in Germany's rich cultural life. However, individual Jews {{were faced with}} a dilemma: they faced new opportunities, but without the comfort of a secure community. For Jewish women, there was an additional issue. German society imposed the usual <b>gender</b> <b>role</b> restrictions and antisemitism, so cultivated Jewish women tapped into the cultural salon. But from 1800 on, salons performed a political and social miracle. The salon allowed Jewish women to establish a venue in their homes in which Jews and non-Jews could meet in relative equality. Like-minded people could study art, literature, philosophy or music together. This handful of educated, acculturated Jewish women could escape the restrictions of their social ghetto. Naturally the women {{had to be in}} well-connected families, either to money or to culture. In these mixed gatherings of nobles, high civil servants, writers, philosophers and artists, Jewish salonnières created a radical vehicle for democratisation, providing a context in which patrons and artists freely exchanged ideas. Henriette Lemos Herz, Fanny Mendelssohn Hensel, Dorothea Mendelssohn Schlegel, Amalie Wolf Beer and at least twelve other salonnières achieved fame and admiration.|$|E
25|$|Not all {{transsexual}} people {{undergo a}} physical transition. Some find reasons not to; for example, {{the expense of}} surgery, the risk of medical complications, or medical conditions which make the use of hormones or surgery dangerous. Some may not identify strongly with another binary <b>gender</b> <b>role.</b> Others may find balance at a mid-point during the process, {{regardless of whether or}} not they are binary-identified. Many transsexual people, including binary-identified transsexual people, do not undergo genital surgery, because they are comfortable with their own genitals, or because they are concerned about nerve damage and the potential loss of sexual pleasure, including orgasm. This is especially so in the case of trans men, many of whom are dissatisfied with the current state of phalloplasty, which is typically very expensive, not covered by health insurance, and commonly does not achieve desired results. For example, not only does phalloplasty not result in a completely natural erection, it may not allow for an erection at all, and its results commonly lack penile sexual sensitivity; in other cases, however, phalloplasty results are satisfying for trans men. By contrast, metoidioplasty, which is more popular, is significantly less expensive and has far better sexual results.|$|E
40|$|The {{focus of}} this thesis falls on the {{subjective}} dimension of gender equality, as translated into attitudes towards <b>gender</b> <b>roles</b> in {{the private and public}} spheres of life. Studying and understanding attitudes towards <b>gender</b> <b>roles</b> is relevant due to their broader implications for democratization, political participation, leadership, fertility, educational achievements, <b>gender</b> <b>roles</b> and division of labour. Based on the assumption that attitudes towards <b>gender</b> <b>roles</b> can impact important social phenomena, this dissertation aims to investigate the institutional, cultural and individual factors that lead to attitudinal gender equality. In other words, it considers what shapes these attitudes as well as how and why they change. These general questions are formulated in a cross-national or longitudinal context. Findings show important relationships between individual and macro level factors {{on the one hand and}} attitudes towards <b>gender</b> <b>roles</b> on the other hand, and detail the nature of these connections...|$|R
40|$|Traditionally, {{social norms}} have {{dictated}} certain <b>gender</b> <b>roles</b> {{for men and}} women. Men have generally been regarded as dominant, masculine, and independent, whereas women are of-ten depicted as weak, sensitive and dependent (Basow, 1986). In contemporary society, however, women are free to adopt more flexible <b>gender</b> <b>roles,</b> ranging from those traditionally regarded as “masculine, ” to those considered more “androgynous, ” to the more stereotypical female <b>gender</b> <b>roles.</b> Some women, nonethe-less, continue to adopt traditional <b>gender</b> <b>roles</b> in which self-ob-jectification may persist.
