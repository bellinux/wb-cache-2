5|$|Grammar can be {{described}} as a system of categories and a set of rules that determine how categories combine to form different aspects of meaning. Languages differ widely in whether they are encoded through the use of categories or lexical units. However, several categories are so common as to be nearly universal. Such universal categories include the <b>encoding</b> of the grammatical relations of participants and predicates by grammatically distinguishing between their relations to a predicate, the <b>encoding</b> of temporal and spatial relations on predicates, and a system of grammatical person governing reference to and distinction between speakers and addressees and those about whom they are speaking.|$|E

Double letters are disregarded when not pronounced separately, e.g. muddy <b>encodes</b> 31 (/m/-/d/), not 311, but midday <b>encodes</b> 311 (/m/-/d/-/d/) while accept <b>encodes</b> 7091 (/k/-/s/-/p/-/t/) since the ds and cs are pronounced separately. x <b>encodes</b> 70 when pronounced as /ks/ or /gz/ (e.g. in fax and exam) and 76 when pronounced /kʃ/ or /gʒ/ (e.g. in action or luxury); z <b>encodes</b> 10 when pronounced /ts/ (e.g. in pizza). In ghost (701, /g/-/s/-/t/) and enough (28, /n/-/f/), gh is being <b>encoded</b> by different numerals.
