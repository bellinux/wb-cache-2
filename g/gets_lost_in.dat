Upon {{interrogating}} a wounded Crachá Preto soldier, Max learns that Fabiana is being held by Serrano in the Nova Esperança favela and that the Crachá Preto raid was meant for Max, as vengeance {{for the deaths of}} their operatives at the stadium.

Max then witnesses the Crachá Preto necklace Marcelo, and escapes with Giovanna. Fleeing from the militia, Giovanna is rescued by Passos, but Max is abandoned, later saved by Da Silva.|$|E
25|$|In TFTP, a {{transfer}} is {{initiated by the}} client issuing a request to read or write a particular file on the server. The request can optionally include a set of negotiated transfer parameters proposed by the client under the terms specified by RFC 2347. If the server grants the request, the file is sent in fixed length blocks of 512 bytes by default or the number specified in the blocksize negotiated option defined by RFC 2348. Each block of transferred data which is usually carried within a single IP packet {{in order to avoid}} IP fragmentation, must be acknowledged by an acknowledgment packet before the next block can be sent. A data packet of less than 512 bytes or the agreed blocksize option signals termination of {{a transfer}}. If a packet <b>gets</b> <b>lost</b> <b>in</b> the network, the intended recipient will timeout and may retransmit their last packet (which may be data or an acknowledgment), thus causing the sender of the lost packet to retransmit that lost packet. The sender has to keep just one packet on hand for retransmission, since the lock step acknowledgment guarantees that all older packets have been correctly received. Notice that both devices involved in a transfer are considered senders and receivers. One sends data and receives acknowledgments, the other sends acknowledgments and receives data.|$|E

There is no {{question}} {{by the end of}} the album that the aim of the director – and composer – was to create a grand-scale orchestral epic. While some of the thematic content occasionally <b>gets</b> <b>lost</b> <b>in</b> the bombastic instrumentation, the score itself is heartfelt and authentic, and makes for an enjoyable listen. When compared to Advent Children, the score to Kingsglaive is darker and more cinematic, setting a refreshing precedent for any future Final Fantasy films".|$|E

Head abuzz with unaccustomed thoughts, Milo is soon back on his road, and the watchdog joins him on his journey through Wisdom.|$|E
500|$|The film's {{experimental}} plot and dense dialogue were controversially received. Esquires Mike D'Angelo claimed that [...] "anybody who claims {{he fully understands}} what's going on in Primer after seeing it just once is either a [...] or a liar". Scott Tobias writes for The A.V. Club: [...] "The banter is heavy on technical jargon and almost perversely short on exposition; {{were it not for}} the presence of voiceover narration, the film would be close to incomprehensible." [...] For the Los Angeles Times, Carina Chocano writes: [...] "sticklers for linear storytelling are bound to be frustrated by narrative threads that start promisingly, then just sort of fall off the spool". Some reviewers were entirely put off by the film's obfuscated narrative. Kirk Honeycutt of The Hollywood Reporter complained that Primer [...] "nearly <b>gets</b> <b>lost</b> <b>in</b> a miasma of technical jargon and scientific conjecture".|$|E

500|$|A {{major theme}} {{in this story}} {{is that of a}} {{symbiotic}} relationship between a planet and its inhabitants, similar to that in The Word for World Is Forest. In her introduction to the story, Le Guin stated [...] "We all have forests in our minds. Forests unexplored, unending. Each of us <b>gets</b> <b>lost</b> <b>in</b> the forests, every night, alone." [...] The [...] "vegetable love" [...] referred to in the poem from which the title is taken can be used to describe the final relationship between Osden and the planetary intelligence of World 4470. When Osden is attacked by Porlock in the planet, he transmits his fear to the planet, which amplifies it and reflects it back at him. Thus Osden's role {{is similar to that of}} Selver in The Word for World is Forest, in that he introduces violence to the forest world. The intelligence of Le Guin's forest has been contrasted to the [...] "low" [...] position occupied by vegetative beings in the works of other science fiction authors such as Arthur C. Clarke.|$|E
500|$|A mixed review {{came from}} Adam Markovitz of Entertainment Weekly, who {{compared}} Beyoncé's work on [...] "Rather Die Young" [...] {{to that of}} past idols such as Luther Vandross and Diana Ross, but felt the tone overshadowed her style, stating that [...] "she <b>gets</b> <b>lost</b> <b>in</b> her idols' polyester-swathed shadows". Matthew Horton of BBC Online wrote that the ballad is less successful than the other songs on 4 because of its [...] "overdone glitz". Similarly, NMEs Hamish MacBain classified [...] "Rather Die Young" [...] {{as one of the}} [...] "barely distinguishable slowies", and Priya Elan of the same publication wrote that the song is spoilt by [...] "some rather drippy lyrics and [...] chorus", adding that there are several lyrical references that [...] "instead of being explained further, are overturned in favour of some romantic mulch". Greg Kot of the Chicago Tribune noted that the song was {{a little more than a}} chorus on repeat. Ryan Dombal of Pitchfork Media commented that [...] "Rather Die Young" [...] ruins its Philly soul vibe with [...] "a theatrical Broadway glaze".|$|E
500|$|The New Yorkers David Denby {{felt the}} new version of Hairspray was [...] "perfectly pleasant," [...] but {{compared}} unfavorably to the Broadway musical, since [...] " [...] have removed the traces of camp humor and Broadway blue that gave the stage show its happily knowing flavor." [...] Denby criticized the dance numbers, calling them [...] "unimaginatively shot," [...] and he considered [...] "the idea of substituting John Travolta for Harvey Fierstein as Tracy’s hefty mother... a blandly earnest betrayal." [...] Stephanie Zacharek of Salon.com found Hairspray [...] "reasonably entertaining. But {{do we really need}} to be entertained reasonably? Waters' original was a crazy sprawl that made perfect sense; this Hairspray toils needlessly to make sense of that craziness, and something <b>gets</b> <b>lost</b> <b>in</b> the translation." [...] Zacharek was also displeased with the way Latifah's performance of [...] "I Know Where I've Been" [...] was incorporated into the movie, saying [...] "The filmmakers may believe they're adding an extra layer of seriousness to the material... the inclusion of this big production number only suggests that the filmmakers fear the audience won't get the movie's message unless it's spelled out for them." ...|$|E

500|$|Not all reviewers {{gave the}} film {{positive}} reviews. New York magazine's David Edelstein claimed {{in his review}} to [...] "have no idea what {{so many people are}} raving about. It's as if someone went into their heads while they were sleeping and planted the idea that Inception is a visionary masterpiece and—hold on ... Whoa! I think I get it. The movie is a metaphor for the power of delusional hype—a metaphor for itself." [...] Rex Reed of The New York Observer explained the film's development as [...] "pretty much what we've come to expect from summer movies in general and Christopher Nolan movies in particular ... doesn't seem like much of an accomplishment to me." [...] A. O. Scott of The New York Times commented [...] "there is a lot to see in Inception, there is nothing that counts as genuine vision. Mr. Nolan's idea of the mind is too literal, too logical, and too rule-bound to allow the full measure of madness." [...] David Denby, writing in The New Yorker, considered the film not nearly as much fun as Nolan imagined it to be, concluding, [...] "Inception is a stunning-looking film that <b>gets</b> <b>lost</b> <b>in</b> fabulous intricacies, a movie devoted to its own workings and to little else." ...|$|E
500|$|Four years later, [...] "Die Another Day" [...] {{was added}} to the set list of the 2008-09 Sticky & Sweet Tour, where it was used as a video interlude. It {{featured}} Madonna as a boxer on screen, while two of her dancers performed a faux boxing match. The video also showed Madonna in a technical knockout match, spraying her blood across the screen. Madonna's DJ Enferno remixed the song and the performance ended with the singer falling down {{on the ground in the}} video, as she emerged from beneath the stage while jump-roping. Paul Schrodt from Slant Magazine felt that the video emphasized the singer's [...] "already-muscular arms", adding that [...] "nlike your run-of-the-mill diva, Madonna is willing to get dirty for her art, and she sometimes <b>gets</b> <b>lost</b> <b>in</b> her backup dancers' routine, though she's quick to remind the audience, 'I'm still the one in control'". Ben Kaplan from Canada.com noted that [...] "Die Another Day", along with the performances of [...] "4 Minutes" [...] and [...] "La Isla Bonita" [...] are re-imagined as [...] "parts of larger medleys, with Madonna giving shout-outs to techno, flamenco and old-school R influences". This performance was included on the Sticky & Sweet Tour live CD and DVD release, recorded during Madonna's shows in Buenos Aires, Argentina, in December 2008.|$|E
500|$|According to Nick Catucci of Rolling Stone, Evanescence is {{primarily}} a [...] "syrupy mix of piano, guitar and strings" [...] which is not as [...] "saucy" [...] as the band's older material. Chris Willman of Reuters wrote, [...] "Every interchangeable tune on the new album also sounds designed to play over the end credits of an action blockbuster that takes itself too seriously". Theon Weber of Spin gave the album a mixed review; rather than holding back too much, Weber wrote, Lee did not do enough to restrain her performance: [...] "Evanescence <b>gets</b> <b>lost</b> <b>in</b> the cavernous spaces carved out by their unsecret weapon." [...] Edna Gundersen of USA Today criticized Raskulineczs production and the album's electronics: [...] "Tempered, her [...] emotional wail enhances the hypnotic medieval magic of signature Evanescence tunes. Some electronics slip into the mix, but the band's rock essence and penchant for weepy strings remain prominent, as does its flair for conveying wretched despair." [...] Although PopMatters Dane Prokofiev criticized the album's eponymous title as a new-band strategy, he praised the [...] "noticeable increase in the prominence of choir singing, tinkling piano motifs, and the silky sound of string instruments" [...] with the caveat that the additional deluxe-edition songs were superior to those on the standard edition. He also noted a turn in the band's sound to match that of symphonic metal. Steven Hyden of The A.V. Club called the album [...] "narcissistic", [...] "corny" [...] and [...] "irredeemably stupid".|$|E
