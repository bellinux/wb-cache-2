2500|$|Pyrotechnics {{utilizing}} {{either an}} exploding shell or a screamer can effectively scare birds away from runways.

The ship fired water cannons and <b>flare</b> <b>pistols</b> at the pirates, and attempted to outmaneuver them, but its constant maneuvers forced it to a speed of nine knots after one hour, after which the pirates attached an assault ladder and began boarding. The captain then ordered that all food and water be hidden in the steering compartment, and activated the ship's distress beacon, after which he and the crew barricaded themselves in the engine room, where they repulsed two attempts by the pirates to force their way in. The pirates would hold the ship for 20 hours.|$|R

50|$|A gas pistol is a {{non-lethal}} weapon used for self-defense and other purposes. It is typically a close-to-exact replica or conversion {{of a real}} handgun made {{to be able to}} fire tear gas cartridges only. Effective range is up to 4.5 metres depending on caliber. For legal purposes various techniques are used during manufacture/conversion to prevent the use of live ammunition, such as using calibers exclusive to gas cartridges, welding obstacles into a non-removable barrel and using malleable metal alloys. Gas pistols are prevalent in European countries with strict gun control laws. Gas pistols are also used in weapons training, and as starting <b>pistols,</b> <b>flare</b> guns, and movie props.|$|R

50|$|Webley & Scott {{produced}} {{a number of}} single-shot, break open signal flare gun devices used by Commonwealth Military Forces during the First and Second World Wars. The most prolific of these was the No.1 MkIII, produced in 1918 at the company's Birmingham facility. A variant, differing only in its use of black plastic grip panels instead of the earlier wood, was produced by Colonial Sugar Refinery in Sydney, Australia in 1942. Perhaps the most famous example of a No.1 Mk 1 <b>Flare</b> <b>Pistol</b> is in the collection at the Conception Bay Museum, Harbour Grace, NL. The gun was lent by Edward Langdon Oke, IV, a veteran of WW1 and the then editor of the Harbor Grace Standard newspaper, to the first Canadian to make a transatlantic flight, Capt. J. Errol Boyd (1891-1960). Boyd took off 9 Oct 1930 from the Harbour Grace airstrip in the plane Maple Leaf (aka, Columbia), navigated by Lieut. Harry Connor, and landed 10 Oct in Tresco, Scilly Isles, England. The gun was engraved to mark the historic flight and is also tatted with the owner’s initials.

5000|$|In 1890, Oke's older brother, John Langdon Oke (1854-1928), wed Mary Winifred Sheppard, whose father, Nathaniel Sheppard, was, like Oke's father, a {{lighthouse}} keeper on Harbour Grace Island. John was a Harbour Grace Water Company Secretary and Collector who suggested {{the site for}} the first civil airport in North America (now the oldest surviving operational airstrip in Canada), from which aviators such as Amelia Earhart would embark from Harbour Grace, NL to cross the Atlantic Ocean. The first pilots to use the airstrip, Edward F. Schlee (1887-1969) and William S. Brock (1895-1932), took off 26 Aug 1927 in the SM-1 NC857 monoplane, Pride of Detroit, attempting to set a speed record for round-the-world flight. Ned, a former Sergeant with the Royal Newfoundland Regiment in WW1, lent pilot Capt. J. Erroll Boyd (1891-1960) his Webley & Scott <b>flare</b> <b>pistol</b> to carry during the first flight by a Canadian from North America to England, 9-10 Oct 1930, in the Wright-Bellanca WB-2 Maple Leaf (aka, Columbia), navigated by the American, Lieut.

5000|$|... 13 April 1945 :On 5 April, a B-24H-15-DT, 41-28779, of the 564th Bomb Squadron, 389th Bomb Group (Heavy), {{captured}} by the Luftwaffe on 20 June 1944 (MACR 6533), and operated as KO+XA by KG 200, departs Wackersleben to avoid the Soviet advance with 29 KG 200 personnel aboard for a flight to Bavaria via Braunschweig. About 25 minutes into the flight, a German flak battery fires on the Liberator, damaging the fuselage, wings and number 4 (starboard outer) engine and cutting the rudder cables. Pilot Oberfeldwebel Rauchfuss manages to maintain control, however. Two passengers, injured by the gunfire, require immediate medical attention (one later dies), and the pilot lands in a meadow near Quedlinburg, but a powerline forces him to apply power to clear it and the bomber breaks its nosewheel strut when it overruns into a freshly ploughed field. The strut is removed {{and sent to the}} Junkers Component Factory at Eilsleben for repair. The oil leak on the engine and the rudder cables are also repaired. Returned on 12 April, the strut is reinstalled and an attempt is made to take off on 13 April, after all excess equipment is removed to lighten the plane, but the clearing proves too short, the B-24 bogs down in sodden soil, and the nose strut again breaks. Reluctantly, the crew destroys the airframe by punching holes in the fuel tanks and setting it alight with a <b>flare</b> <b>pistol.</b>|$|E
5000|$|Time Magazine:An {{extremely}} funny 15-minute film, may {{be taken}} as a solemn leg-pull of the recent vogue for dribble-and-splotch painters, those athletic canvas-coverers whose style owes less to Van Gogh's brush technique than to Stan Laurel's custard pie stance. Or it {{may be taken}} as an explicit set of instructions for getting rich.The film, a first-time effort by three ex-admen, begins with a loving shot of wharfs, fishing shacks and sounding sea-the sort of vista once sketched avidly by artists and now appreciated chiefly by retired couples who tour Cape Cod in late September. The artist is a burly fellow (Ezra Reuben Baker), recognizably aesthetic in paint-smeared dungarees, scurrilous red sweater and combat boots. He trundles a cart filled with paint buckets along a dock, then throws an enormous sheet of wallboard down on a mud flat ten feet below.Soberly, with exquisite skill, using first a vigorous forehand, then a precisely executed backhand, the painter slops color from buckets. Clearly he is a master, for his stroke with the long-handled hoe is sure and strong, his touch with the dribble-stick more than Japanese in its delicacy. And when he fills a <b>flare</b> <b>pistol</b> with paint and fires the last accent of orange at his abstraction, he does not pull the trigger. He squeezes.When the thing dries, he hacks it up in random rectangles with a power saw, then carefully signs each fragment. A seaplane, labeled [...] "Galerie des Abstracts, Paris-New York," [...] touches down. A man debarks whose rich, dark overcoat obviously proclaims him an art dealer. He strokes his jaw as he examines the paintings, eventually selects a small one, shakes hands with the painter and takes off. Pleased with himself, the painter matter-of-factly shoves the remaining works of art into the ocean. This, as the screen truly proclaims, is the end.|$|E
50|$|By then, many {{buildings}} {{were ready for}} occupancy and by mid-March, four Curtiss R-9s were delivered to the Chatham Train Station. They were assembled and the first flight was made by Lt. McKitterick on 25 March. In July, four Curtiss HS-1L flying boats were delivered to the depot and trucked to the base. These boats were so urgently needed that they were put into service almost immediately. The addition of these boats increased the time available to patrols from dawn to dusk. Two patrol areas, aptly named Areas A and B were then created. Area A was to the north while Area B was to the south. Planes always went in pairs with one plane carrying a radio transmitter. The plane with the transmitter was required to radio in a location every ten minutes. Both planes carried two homing pigeons for emergency communication with the base, and the birds had been trained for either the north patrol or the south patrol. Thus {{they could not be}} transferred from one area to another. Planes were equipped with emergency rations and water for three days, a flashlight, <b>flare</b> <b>pistol</b> with red and green cartridges, a sea anchor, life preservers, signal book and local charts. Patrols took place at 1000 ft with the purpose to protect the shipping in a defined area. Often the planes would circle around a ship for hours while looking for U-Boats after picking up the vessel in a predetermined location. While the two planes were out on patrol, two other planes and their fliers were on standby at the station, ready to assist should a plane radio in a distress call. If the planes and men could get airborne within seven minutes, they were considered to be within the acceptable range of response time. Eventually blimps were used to help in the patrol process. With their cruising speed of 35 mi/h km/h and a range of 900 mi, they were a useful asset in the patrols.|$|E
5000|$|The first {{incidents}} between Football fans in Greece {{were recorded}} in June 1930, after the match between Aris Thessaloniki and Panathinaikos F.C. at Thessaloniki. While Panathinaikos fans where arriving {{at the port of}} Piraeus from Thessaloniki, Olympiakos fans, who had not forgotten the big loss of their team (8-2) by Panathinaikos F.C. riot with the green fans. The word [...] "hooliganism" [...] was recorded at the early '60s where Greek students in the UK who had experienced the phenomenon of hooliganism there first taught the term to the journalists who were unable to explain why the fans were fighting each other and gave this situation a name.In 1962, after Panathinaikos F.C. and P.A.O.K. F.C. match incidents, newspapers wrote {{for the first time that}} hooligans (Χούλιγκανς) vandalized Apostolos Nikolaidis Stadium.It was on 19 November 1966 that a big flag, at the 13th gate of Apostolos Nikolaidis Stadium announced the arrival of a new group on the scene. Gate 13 would be the first organized group that over the years became a part of the club by affecting club decisions and by following the club on all possible occasions.P.A.O.K. F.C. fans made Gate 4 in 1978 and Olympiacos fans create the Gate 7 in 1981.In 1982, between Aris FC - Paok FC match incidents, Aris Dimitriadis was stabbed and later died in Thessaloniki's hospital. On 26 October 1986, at the Alkazar stadium of Larissa Charalambos Blionas was killed by a <b>flare</b> <b>pistol</b> thrown by the Paok fans. One month later anastasios Zontos was stabbed to death in Omonoia square in the center of Athens before the match AEK Athens F.C. & P.A.O.K. F.C.. In January 1991, before the derby of Aek F.C. and Olympiakos F.C., George Panagiotou died in the incidents between hooligans outside Nea Filadelfia's stadium hit by flare pistol.On 15 May 2005, in Thessaloniki derby Iraklis-Aris F.C., Aris' hooligans called Ierolohites invaded the pitch when the score was 2-1 for Iraklis. A football player Tasos Katsambis was injured during the clashes. The match was halted and Aris was punished with a 4-point deduction which led to their relegation to the Second Division.In April 2007, all sports stadiums were closed down in Greece for two weeks following the death of a fan in a pre-arranged fight between hooligans in Athens on 29 March. The fight involved 500 fans of rival Super League Greece clubs Panathinaikos, which is based in Athens, and Olympiacos, which is based in nearby Piraeus. The Greek government immediately suspended all team sports in Greece and severed the ties between teams and their supporters' organizations. A Third Division match between Panetolikos and Ilioupoli was stopped for thirty minutes when players and fans clashed following a Panetolikos disallowed goal. Two players and a coach were sent to the hospital.|$|E
