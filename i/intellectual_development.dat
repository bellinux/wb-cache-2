5|$|Hypothyroidism, {{also called}} underactive thyroid or low thyroid, {{is a common}} {{disorder}} of the endocrine {{system in which the}} thyroid gland does not produce enough thyroid hormone.

5|$|This {{philosophy}} of approaching {{the art of}} acting has stood not only steadfast, but as the cornerstone of acting {{for much of the}} 20th century to this day. Mikhail Chekhov considered Ivanov a key moment in his brother's <b>intellectual</b> <b>development</b> and literary career. From this period comes an observation of Chekhov's that has become known as Chekhov's gun, a dramatic principle that requires that every element in a narrative be necessary and irreplaceable, and that everything else be removed.|$|E
5|$|Wagner {{planned for}} a {{collected}} {{edition of his}} publications as early as 1865; he believed that such an edition would help the world understand his <b>intellectual</b> <b>development</b> and artistic aims. The first such edition was published between 1871 and 1883, but was doctored to suppress or alter articles that were an embarrassment to him (e.g. those praising Meyerbeer), or by altering dates on some articles to reinforce Wagner's own account of his progress. Wagner's autobiography Mein Leben was originally published for close friends only {{in a very small}} edition (15–18 copies per volume) in four volumes between 1870 and 1880. The first public edition (with many passages suppressed by Cosima) appeared in 1911; the first attempt at a full edition (in German) appeared in 1963.|$|E

5|$|The {{choice of}} Law marked {{the start of}} a new chapter for Smuts. The {{preceding}} years at Stellenbosch had been ones of tremendous <b>intellectual</b> <b>development.</b> From the narrow focus of his upbringing, his outlook had now expanded, awakening within him a consciousness of the breadth of knowledge now open before him. Smuts, though remaining an adherent of the Church, and respectful of the Bible and its teachings, had developed a more questioning and critical outlook during the course of his studies. Whereas at the outset of his university career he was content to follow his parents' wishes and be ordained into the Church, as his time at Victoria College came to an end he found himself more and more unwilling to commit to this path. Though he had now as yet wholly rejected the idea of ordination, he wished for a period of more diversified study before making that decision. So it was that Smuts came to select Law, rather than Divinity or Philosophy - the logical choices for a future Minister of Religion.|$|E
5|$|There is an {{extensive}} {{body of research}} demonstrating a significant association between attachment organizations and children's functioning across multiple domains. Early insecure attachment does not necessarily predict difficulties, {{but it is a}} liability for the child, particularly if similar parental behaviours continue throughout childhood. Compared to that of securely attached children, the adjustment of insecure children in many spheres of life is not as soundly based, putting their future relationships in jeopardy. Although the link is not fully established by research and there are other influences besides attachment, secure infants are more likely to become socially competent than their insecure peers. Relationships formed with peers influence the acquisition of social skills, <b>intellectual</b> <b>development</b> and the formation of social identity. Classification of children's peer status (popular, neglected or rejected) has been found to predict subsequent adjustment. Insecure children, particularly avoidant children, are especially vulnerable to family risk. Their social and behavioural problems increase or decline with deterioration or improvement in parenting. However, an early secure attachment appears to have a lasting protective function. As with attachment to parental figures, subsequent experiences may alter the course of development.|$|E
