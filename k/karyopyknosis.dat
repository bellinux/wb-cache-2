It is followed by karyorrhexis, or fragmentation of the nucleus.Pyknosis (from Greek pyknono meaning [...] "to thicken up, to close or to condense") is also observed in the maturation of erythrocytes (a red blood cell) and the neutrophil (a type of white blood cell). The maturing metarubricyte (a stage in RBC maturation) will condense its nucleus before expelling it to become a reticulocyte. The maturing neutrophil will condense its nucleus into several connected lobes that stay in the cell {{until the end of}} its cell life.|$|E

The {{purpose of this study}} is to evaluate whether morphological signs of apoptotic cell death could be detected in early streptozotocin-induced diabetes in rats kidneys. There were used five Wistar rats, and renal tissue samples were drawn after three weeks of disease and further evaluated in transmission electron microscopy (TEM). Podocytes damage was indicated by two major findings: foot processes effacement, viewed as loss of cell processes, and chromatin condensation and margination (partial karyo-pyknosis: peculiar nuclear morphologies – partly normal, euchromatic, and partly positive for <b>karyopyknosis</b> and nuclear shrinkage). Mitotic glomerular endotheliocytes were also encountered. Podocytes cell death commitment and detachment appeared as concomitant events. However, <b>karyopyknosis</b> is not a specific feature of apoptosis. Thus, further biochemical evaluations are needed to distinguish between different pathways of podocytes death...|$|E

Using an in vitro system, we examined the effect of bacterial lipopolysaccharide and recombinant human granulocyte colony-stimulating factor on the apoptosis (programmed cell death) of neutrophils and their subsequent ingestion by macrophages. Lipopolysaccharide delayed <b>karyopyknosis</b> and apoptosis of neutrophils, as shown by endogenous endonuclease activity and {{a high proportion of}} trypan blue-excluding cells, and subsequent ingestion by autologous macrophages. Granulocyte colony-stimulating factor also delayed neutrophil <b>karyopyknosis</b> and ingestion by macrophages. When a thioglycolate medium was coinjected intraperitoneally with lipopolysaccharide into guinea pigs in the in vivo system, delays in neutrophil disappearance and ingestion by macrophages in the peritoneal cavity were also observed.

40|$|SummaryOur work {{represents}} {{the first case}} report of polycystic echinococcosis co-infection with HIV, hepatitis C virus (HCV), and hepatitis B virus (HBV). Structural liver alterations {{were found to be}} related to parasitic structures and necroinflammatory foci (<b>karyopyknosis,</b> karyorrhexis, and karyolysis), consistent with Echinococcus vogeli. Visceral adipose tissue and intrahepatic triglyceride droplets (macrovesicular and microvesicular steatosis) indicated abnormal fat anabolism, which probably resulted from both viral-induced hepatopathy and drug-related toxicity. In summary, our results suggest that the observed liver abnormalities reflected the coincident exposure to hepatotropic viruses and parasites causing polycystic echinococcosis and were not indicative of opportunistic relationships among these pathogens...|$|E
40|$|AIM: To {{investigate}} the pathological characteristics of non-thermal damage induced by pulsed high intensity focused ultrasound (PHIFU) combined with ultrasound contrast agent (UCA), SonoVue (Bracco SpA, Milan, Italy) in rabbit liver VX 2 tumor. METHODS: Liver VX 2 tumor models {{were established in}} 20 rabbits, which were divided randomly into PHIFU combined with ultrasound contrast agent group (PHIFU + UCA group) and sham group. In the PHIFU + UCA group, 0. 2 mL of SonoVue was injected intravenously into the tumor, followed by ultrasound exposure of ISP 5900 W/cm 2. The rabbits were sacrificed one day after ultrasound exposure. Specimens of the exposed tumor tissues were obtained and observed pathologically under light microscope and transmission electron microscope. The remaining tumor tissues were sent for 2, 3, 5 -Triphenyltetrazolium chloride (TTC) staining. RESULTS: Before TTC staining, tumor tissues in both the sham and the PHIFU + UCA groups resembled gray fish meat. After TTC staining, the tumor tissues were uniformly stained red, with a clear boundary between tumor tissue and normal tissue. Histological examination showed signs of tumor cell injury in PHIFU + UCA group, with cytoplasmic vacuoles of various sizes, chromatin margination and <b>karyopyknosis.</b> Electron microscopic examination revealed tumor cell volume reduction, <b>karyopyknosis,</b> chromatin margination, intercellular space widening, the presence of high electron-density apoptotic bodies and vacuoles in cytoplasm.

Black seed (Nigella sativa) oil,which contains thymoquinone,has protection effect to renal toxicity mechanism. The {{aim of this}} research is knowing the influence of black seed (Nigella sativa) oil to renal histological damaging of mice (Mus musculus) that induced by paracetamol. This was laboratory experimental research with post test only controlledgroup design. Samples in this research were thirty male mices (Mus musculus), Swiss webster type, 6 - 8 weeks old age and + 20 g of each weight. Samples divided into 3 groups, each group has ten mices. The control group, mices are given with aquadest twice orally perdays for a week. The first group, mices are given with paracetamol and aquadest orally perdays for 3 days. Then, the fourth until seventh day, mices are treated like the control group. The second group, mices are given with paracetamol and black seed oil orally perdays for 3 days. Then, the fourth until seventh day, mices are given with aquadest and black seed oil orally perdays. Finally in eight day, mices are sacrificed with neck dislocation. After that, we made preparate from the right and leftrenal that painted by Hematoxillin Eosin (HE). Renal histological is observed and scored base on renal histological damaging on <b>karyopyknosis,</b> karyorhexis, and karyolysis. <b>Karyopyknosis</b> is given score 1, karyorhexis is given score 2, and karyolysis is given score 3.

A cytological {{analysis}} {{based on}} ultrastructural findings {{in some regions}} of Ohrid trout ` testes Salmo letnica (Karaman) in the prespawning and postspawning period, with a special emphasis of Sertoli cells, was performed. Sertoli cells, being {{an integral part of}} the seminiferous lobules underwent considerable changes, which influenced their cytomorphological features. The cells with endotheliomorphic appearance, characteristic for the prespawning period, gradually increase their dimensions. Lipid vacuoles of dif-ferent size were noticed in their cytoplasm, while the nuclei acquired a polymorphic appearance. In the seminiferous lobules with rare sperm residues Sertoli cells underwent further changes which caused their involution. The degenerative changes of Sertoli cells were manifested by an ex-treme vacuolisation, mitochondria with desintegrated crysts or mitochondria in degeneration (with widened crysts and thickened matrix), by desorganised endoplasmic reticulum, digestive vacuoles (autophagosomes), “myeline-like ” structures and lysed cytoplasmic regions. The above mentioned changes were followed by <b>karyopyknosis,</b> complete degeneration and delamination of cells from the wall of the seminiferous lobules, lysis and detritus formation (Sertoli necrotic material) in the lumen of the lobules.

After exposure to heat stress at 42 uC for different durations, the activities of enzymes expressed during cell damage increased in the supernatant of the heat-stressed myocardial cells from 10 min, and the pathological lesions were characterized by <b>karyopyknosis</b> and acute degeneration. Thus, cell damage was induced at the onset of heat stress. Immunofluorescence analysis showed stronger positive signals for both Hsp 27 and aB-crystallin from 10 min to 240 min of exposure compared to the control cells. According to the Western blotting results, during the 480 min of heat stress, no significant variation was found in Hsp 27 and aB-crystallin expression; however, significant differences were found in the induction of their corresponding mRNAs. The expression of these small heat shock proteins (sHsps) was probably delayed or overtaxed due to the rapid consumption of sHsps in myocardial cells at the onset of heat stress.

40|$|The {{neurotoxicity}} of epsilon-toxin, one of {{the major}} lethal toxins produced by Clostridium perfringens type B, was studied by histological examination of the rat brain. When the toxin was injected intravenously at a lethal dose (100 ng/kg), neuronal damage was observed {{in many areas of the}} brain. Injection of the toxin at a sublethal dose (50 ng/kg) caused neuronal damage predominantly in the hippocampus: pyramidal cells in the hippocampus showed marked shrinkage and <b>karyopyknosis,</b> or so-called dark cells. The dark cells lost the immunoreactivity to microtubule-associated protein- 2, a postsynaptic somal and dendric marker, while acetylcholinesterase-positive fibers were not affected. Timm’s zinc staining revealed that zinc ions were depleted in the mossy layers of the CA 3 subfield containing glutamate as a synaptic transmitter. The cerebral blood flow in the hippocampus was not altered significantly before or after administration of the toxin, as measured by laser-Doppler flowmetry, excluding the possibility that the observed histological change was due to a secondary effect of ischemia in the hippocampus. Prior injection of either a glutamate release inhibitor or a glutamate receptor antagonist protected the hippocampus from the neuronal damage caused by epsilon-toxin. These results suggest that epsilon-toxin acts on the glutamatergic system and evokes excessive release of glutamate, leading to neuronal damage...|$|E

The expression of αB-crystallin in rat hearts showed a significant decrease (P< 0. 05) throughout the heat stress treatment period, except at the 40 min time point. Likewise, decreased αB-crystallin expression was also observed in the H 9 C 2 cell line exposed to a high temperature in vitro, although its expression recovered to normal levels at later time points (80 and 100 min) and the cellular damage was less severe. The results suggest that αB-crystallin is mobilized early after exposure to a high temperature to interact with damaged proteins but that the myocardial cells cannot produce sufficient αB-crystallin for protection against heat stress. Lower αB-crystallin expression levels were accompanied by obvious cell/tissue damage, suggesting that the abundance of this protein is associated with protective effects in myocardial cells in vitro and in vivo.

40|$|BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Second mitochondria-derived {{activator}} of caspase (SMAC) -mimetics are a {{new class}} of targeted drugs that specifically induce apoptotic cancer cell death and block pro-survival signaling by antagonizing selected members of the inhibitor of apoptosis protein (IAP) family. MATERIAL AND METHODS: The present study was designed to investigate the radiosensitizing effect and optimal sequence of administration of the novel SMAC-mimetic Debio 1143 in vitro and in vivo. Apoptosis, alteration of DNA damage repair (DDR), and tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-α) signaling were examined. RESULTS: In vitro, Debio 1143 displayed anti-proliferative activity and enhanced intrinsic radiation sensitivity in 5 / 6 head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) cell lines in a synergistic manner. In vivo, Debio 1143 dose-dependently radio-sensitized FaDu and SQ 20 B xenografts, resulting in complete tumor regression in 8 / 10 FaDu-xenografted mice at the high dose level. At the molecular level, Debio 1143 combined with radiotherapy (RT) induced enhancement of caspase- 3 activity, increase in Annexin V-positive cells and <b>karyopyknosis,</b> and increase in TNF-α mRNA levels. Finally, in a neutralization experiment using a TNF-α-blocking antibody and a caspase inhibitor, it was shown that the radiosensitizing effect of Debio 1143 is mediated by caspases and TNF-α.

Bighead carp in field and laboratory studies showed a progressive recovery of structure and function in terms of histological, cellular, and biochemical features. In laboratory study, when fish were i. p. injected with extracted MCs at the doses of 200 and 500 μg MC-LReq/kg body weight, respectively, liver pathology in bighead carp was observed in a time dose-dependent manner within 24 h postinjection and characterized by disruption of liver structure, condensed cytoplasm, {{and the appearance of}} massive hepatocytes with <b>karyopyknosis,</b> karyorrhexis, and karyolysis. In comparison with previous studies on other fish, bighead carp in field study endured higher MC doses and longer-term exposure, but displayed less damage in the liver and kidney. Ultrastructural examination in the liver revealed the presence of lysosome proliferation, suggesting that bighead carp might eliminate or lessen cell damage caused by MCs through lysosome activation.

40|$|Our {{objective}} is to study {{the relationship between the}} regulatory proteins Bcl- 2 /Bax and mitochondria-mediated apoptosis during the differentiation of adipose-derived stromal cells (ADSCs) into neurons. Immunocytochemistry and western blotting showed that the cells weakly expressed neuron-specific enolase (NSE) in the non-induced group and expressed NSE more strongly in the groups induced for 1 h, 3 h, 5 h and 8 h. NSE expression peaked at 5 h (P 0. 05). Bcl- 2 expression gradually decreased over time in the non-induced group (P < 0. 05). However, Bax, caspase- 9, Cyt-c and caspase- 3 expression gradually increased and peaked at 8 h (P < 0. 05). Transmission electron microscopy revealed <b>karyopyknosis,</b> chromatin edge setting, mitochondria swelling and cavitation in cells at 5 h, and the mitochondrial membrane potential decreased over time, as demonstrated by laser scanning confocal microscopy. After a 5 h induction, cells differentiated into typical neurons and expressed Bcl- 2, which inhibited apoptosis. Bax showed a strong apoptosis-promoting capacity, leading to changes in the mitochondrial membrane potential and structure, and then triggered the caspase-independent apoptotic response through the mitochondrial pathway. At the same time, Cyt-c was directly or indirectly released from the mitochondria to the cytoplasm to trigger the caspase-dependent apoptotic response through the mitochondrial pathway. Therefore, Bcl- 2 /Bax {{play an important role in}} regulating caspase-dependent and caspase-independent apoptosis mediated by the mitochondrial pathway during the differentiation of ADSCs into neurons...|$|E
40|$|Abstract Background As {{there is}} no optimal {{treatment}} of non small cell lung cancer due to its resistance to common chemotherapeutics, we investigated the effect of human placenta-conditioned medium on tumor tissue. The human placenta constitutes a mixture of maternal and fetal origin and displays a variety of immunomodulatory aspects. Methods Freshly resected non small cell lung cancer tissues were incubated with placenta-conditioned medium in a short-term tissue culture model and A 549 cells were challenged, respectively. Term placenta was used for producing conditioned medium and HOPE-fixed stimulated tumor tissue was analyzed for expression of caspase- 3 and Ki 67 via immunohistochemistry. The effects of conditioned medium on squamous cell carcinoma were further compared to physiological concentrations of Carboplat/Gemzar. Results Conditioned medium caused in 2 of 3 cases elevated expression of caspase- 3 and reduced expression of Ki 67 in 3 out of 3 cases, while the chemotherapeutic agents caused no comparable expression of caspase- 3 or reduction of Ki 67. In cell culture up to 50 % of <b>karyopyknosis</b> was investigated and even sterile-filtrated medium caused widespread reduction of Ki 67 on protein level. Conclusion Human placenta releases substances that mediate apoptosis and reduce proliferation in tumor tissue and cell culture. As even sterile-filtrated medium caused the mentioned effects we hypothesize one or more soluble mediators. The detailed way of promoting apoptosis and nature of these mediators need to be elucidated in further studies. </p...|$|E

Seven animals {{were treated with}} imidocarb dipropionate on average 4. 5 days prior to death. Severe anaemia was present only in 2 cases. Degenerative histological changes observed mostly in the proximal convoluted tubules included vacuolar-hydropic degeneration, necrosis and detachment of renal tubular epithelial (RTE) cells from the basement membrane. Necrotic debris occasionally formed acidophilic casts within the tubules. In some cases, necrosis of the whole tubule was observed. Haemoglobin casts in the tubules and haemoglobin droplets in RTE cells seldom appeared. No significant histological changes were seen in the glomeruli. Ultrastructural lesions in RTE cells included nuclear membrane hyperchromatosis, <b>karyopyknosis,</b> karyolysis, swelling or collapse of mitochondria with fragmentation of cristae and vacuolar-hydropic degeneration in the endoplasmic reticulum and microvilli. Nuclear oedema was also observed. Many RTE cells exhibiting necrosis collapsed. Vacuolar-hydropic degeneration and necrosis were also observed in the glomerular and interstitial capillary endothelium. The severe acute tubular necrosis described {{in this study is}} probably the result of hypoxic renal injury. Systemic hypotension leading to vasoconstriction in the kidneys might be the most important cause of renal hypoxia in B. canis infections, but anaemia may also contribute to inadequate oxygenation.

40|$|The {{present study}} aimed to {{evaluate}} the current contamination status of Topolnitsa Reservoir, which {{is located in a}} region with intensive copper mining. The reservoir has been continually contaminated with metals over the last few decades. As, Cd, Cu, Ni, Pb, and Zn concentrations were measured in surface water samples and in the liver of common rudd, Scardinius erythrophthalmus (L.), in three different seasons: spring, summer, and autumn. The morphological structure of the fish liver was examined and the hepatic LDH, ALAT, and ASAT activities were measured. In general, metal concentrations in the water varied, but As and Cu were present in all three seasons at levels higher than the maximum permissible levels set by law. The metal concentrations in the fish liver were significantly higher than in the water. Histological alterations were classified as degenerative changes (granular, vacuolar, hydropic, and fatty degeneration), necrotic changes (necrobiosis) - <b>karyopyknosis,</b> karryorehsis, and karyolyzis, and necrosis)); and changes in blood vessels (hyperemia in sinusoids and major blood vessels). Higher LDH, ALAT, and ASAT activities in fish livers were measured in comparison to reference fish. In addition, the ALAT activity in the livers of S. erythrophthalmus from Topolnitsa Reservoir was significantly higher in the summer. Overall, it can be concluded that the metal-contaminated waters of Topolnitsa Reservoir lead to negative changes in the common rudd tissues at the cellular level including impaired structure and enhanced enzymatic activity in the fish liver...|$|E

K 562 cells were treated with wortmannin of various concentrations (3. 125 - 100 nmol/L) for 0 - 72 h. MTT assay {{was used to evaluate}} the {{inhibitory effect}} of wortmannin on the growth of K 562 cells. Cell apoptosis was detected by both Annexin-V FITC/PI double-labeled cytometry and transmission electron microscopy (TEM). The expression of p-Akt, T-p-Akt, NF-κBp 65 and IKK-κB was determined by Western blotting and reverse transcription- polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). Our results showed that wortmannin obviously inhibited growth and induced apoptosis of K 562 cells in vitro in a time- and dose-dependent manner. The IC 50 value of wortmannin for 24 h was 25 ± 0. 14 nmol/L. Moreover, wortmannin induced K 562 cells apoptosis in a dose-dependent manner. TEM revealed typical morphological changes of apoptosis in wortmannin-treated K 562 cells, such as chromatin condensation, <b>karyopyknosis,</b> karyorhexis and apoptotic bodies. Additionally, several important intracellular protein kinases such as p-Akt, NF-κBp 65 and IKK-κB experienced degradation of various degrees in a dose-dependent manner both at protein level and transcription level when cultured with wortmannin, but the expression of total Akt showed no change. It is concluded that wortmannin can inhibit the proliferation and induce apoptosis of K 562 leukemia cells possibly by down-regulating the survival signaling pathways (PI 3 K/Akt and NF-κB channels). © 2009 Huazhong University of Science and Technology and Springer-Verlag GmbH. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|E
40|$|Objective To {{investigate}} {{the effects of}} dexmedetomidine preconditioning on cerebral hypoxia-ischemia injury in rats.   Methods Seventy-two adult male Sprague-Dawley (SD) rats weighing 250 - 300 g were randomly divided into 3 groups: sham group (Group S), conventional resuscitation group (Group C) and dexmedetomidine preconditioning group (Group D). Cerebral hypoxia-ischemia injury rat model was produced by mechanical asphyxia. In Group D, 4 μ g/kg dexmedetomidine was injected intravenously 5 min before asphyxia. The Neurological Deficit Scale (NDS) was assessed at 12, 24, 48 and 72 h after return of spontaneous circulation. Six rats were sacrificed in each group and brain tissues were removed for microscopic examination of hippocampal CA 1 region and ultrastructure by electron microscope.   Results The PaO 2 in Group D and C rats was significantly lower after resuscitation (P = 0. 000, for all), while the PaCO 2 was increased as compared with before asphyxia (P = 0. 000, for all). Compared with Group S, NDS {{at each time point}} were significantly increased in Group C (P = 0. 000, for all). Compared with Group C, NDS were significantly decreased at 24, 48 and 72 h in Group D (P = 0. 000, for all). Compared with Group C, hippocampal neurons in Group D revealed alleviative necrosis, <b>karyopyknosis</b> and karyolysis, as well as increased number of survival neurons and relieved edema. Besides, there was good microenvironment of neurovascular unit and no obvious demyelination.   Conclusions Dexmedetomidine preconditioning can attenuate cerebral hypoxia?ischemia injury in rats, and improve the pathologic changes and ultrastructure of neurons of hippocampus.   doi:  10. 3969 /j. issn. 1672 - 6731. 2014. 05. 012 </p...|$|E
40|$|International audienceThe {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to determine whether neutrophil apoptosis and their consequent elimination by macrophages from the mammary gland is modulated by an infection caused by Staphylococcus aureus (S. aureus). The study was performed on twenty mammary glands of 5 virgin heifers. A buffered physiological solution (PBS) was administered as a means of control into the mammary glands of the heifers and after 168 h, the glands were inoculated with S.  aureus. The samples of cell populations were obtained by lavages of the mammary glands in 4 intervals (24, 48, 72 and 168 h) after the experimental infection. Flow cytometry was used for determination of Annexin-V positivity and propidium iodide (PI) negativity of neutrophils. Light microscopy was used for determination of neutrophil <b>karyopyknosis.</b> Cytochemistry was used for the detection of myeloperoxidase‑positive (MPO+) macrophages. Instillation of S. aureus resulted in an intramammary infection which persisted during the following experimental period. The total number of both Annexin-V-positive and PI negative neutrophils and karyopyknotic neutrophils peaked at 24 h after both of PBS and S. aureus administration. The highest percentages of Annexin-V‑positive and PI negative neutrophils and karyopyknotic neutrophils were detected 48 and 168  h after PBS and S.  aureus administration, respectively. The total number of MPO+ macrophages was the highest 24  h and 48 h after PBS and S. aureus administration, respectively; the percentage of MPO+ macrophages was the highest at 72 h in both cases. The dynamics of resolution of mastitis caused by S. aureus was very similar to the resolution of inflammatory response of the mammary gland after PBS administration. Mechanisms of cell pathogen elimination as well as inflammation resolution were very intensively involved; nevertheless, the mammary gland infection persisted. An early inclusion of the mechanisms of an acute inflammatory resolution thus paradoxically led to chronic infection...|$|E
40|$|Background and purpose: The aim of {{the present}} study was to {{investigate}} the effects of the insecticide thiamethoxam on some biochemical, histological and histochemical parameters of bighead carp liver (Aristichthys nobilis), which is an economically important fish species for aquaculture. Materials and methods: Different increasing concentrations of 6. 6 mg l- 1, 10 mg l- 1 and 20 mg l- 1 of the test chemical under laboratory conditions were tested for their toxicity on fish for 96. The hepatic activity of the enzymes lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), aspartate aminotransferase (ASAT) and alanine aminotransferase (ALAT) were measured. In addition, the hepatic histological structure was observed for alterations, as well as the lipid content was observed by histochemical staining. Results: It was determined that the enzymatic activity of the exposed fish was increased compared to the control group (p< 0. 05). Furthermore, the enzymatic activity was increased proportionally to the increasing thiamethoxam concentrations. The histological lesions, which were observed in the liver parenchyma, were degenerative and necrotic. The degenerative alterations were as follows: granular, balloon and fatty degeneration. The necrotic alterations in the fish liver were associated with presence of <b>karyopyknosis,</b> karyorrehsis and karyolysis, respectively. The histological alterations in the liver blood vessels were hyperemia and lymphocyte proliferation. Along with the established histological changes in the liver parenchyma, we found presence of fatty degeneration in the hepatocytes using Sudan III staining on cryostat sections. Conclusions: Our study shows that there is a relation between the concentration of the insecticide and biochemical changes, as well the severity of expression of the histological and histochemical alterations in the bighead carp liver. Overall, such experiments could be successfully applied in research and monitoring programs to study the effects of pesticides on fish...|$|E

40|$|Abstract Background Advances in {{nanotechnology}} {{have identified}} promising candidates for many biological, biomedical and biomedicine applications. They are being increasingly exploited for medical uses and other industrial applications. The {{aim of the}} present study was to investigate the effects of administration of gold nanoparticles (GNPs) on inflammatory cells infiltration, central vein intima disruption, fatty change, and Kupffer cells hyperplasia in the hepatic tissue in an attempt to cover and understand the toxicity and the potential threat of their therapeutic and diagnostic use. Methods A total of 70 healthy male Wistar-Kyoto rats were exposed to GNPs received 50 or 100 μl of GNPs infusion of 10, 20 and 50 nm GNPs for 3 or 7 days. Animals were randomly divided into groups, 12 GNPs-treated rats groups and one control group (NG). Groups 1, 2 and 3 received infusion of 50 μl GNPs of size 10 nm (3 or 7 days), size 20 nm (3 or 7 days) and 50 nm (3 or 7 days), respectively; while groups 4, 5 and 6 received infusion of 100 μl GNPs of size 10 nm, size 20 nm and 50 nm, respectively. Results In comparison with respective control rats, exposure to GNPs doses has produced alterations in the hepatocytes, portal triads and sinusoids. The alterations in the hepatocytes were mainly vacuolar to hydropic degeneration, cytopasmic hyaline vacuolation, polymorphism, binucleation, <b>karyopyknosis,</b> karyolysis, karyorrhexis and necrosis. In addition, inflammatory cell infiltration, Kupffer cells hyperplasia, central veins intima disruption, hepatic strands dilatation and occasional fatty change together with a loss of normal architechiture of hepatic strands were also seen. Conclusions The alterations induced by the administration of GNPs were size-dependent with smaller ones induced more affects and related with time exposure of GNPs. These alterations might be an indication of injured hepatocytes due to GNPs toxicity that became unable to deal with the accumulated residues resulting from metabolic and structural disturbances caused by these NPs. These histological alterations may suggest that GNPs interact with proteins and enzymes of the hepatic tissue interfering with the antioxidant defense mechanism and leading to reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation which in turn may induce stress in the hepatocytes to undergo necrosis. </p...|$|E

MethodsA total of 80 female Kunming rats {{were used to}} establish U 14 rat models of cervical cancer and then divided into groups I, II, III, IV, with 20 rats in each. For Group I, the control group, injection of normal saline was given around the tumors. For Group II, injection of 2  mg/kg cisplatin was given around the tumors. For Group III, injection of 75  mg/kg matrine was given around the tumors while the combined injection of matrine and cisplatin was given for Group IV with the same doses as Groups II and III. The animals were sacrificed 10  d after the injection and tumors were taken out for the comparisons of tumor weights after injection and calculation of anti-tumor rates, while thymus and spleen were taken for thymus index and spleen index. Blood in eyeball was collected for determination of changes in serum creatinine and urea nitrogen levels. Sections of tumor issue were prepared and morphological changes in tumor tissue cells were observed by using immunohistochemistry technique. ResultsAfter injection, the thymus index and spleen index in Groups III and IV {{were significantly higher than}} those in Groups I and II (P <  0. 05) while the two indexes in Group II were significantly lower than Group I (P <  0. 05). The tumor weights in Groups II and IV were significantly smaller than those in Groups I and III (P <  0. 05) with significantly higher anti-tumor rates than Groups I and III (P <  0. 05). The serum creatinine and urea nitrogen levels in Groups III and IV were significantly lower than Group II (P <  0. 05) and the two indicators in Group III were significantly lower than those in Group IV (P <  0. 05). The observation under the histological microscope showed densely arranged tumor cells in Group I, growing as a crumby structure and diffuse appearance, with hyperchromatic and large nuclei, and abundant cytoplasm. In the case of Group II, it showed less tumor cells, with extensive degenerative necrosis, sparse arrangement and <b>karyopyknosis</b> as well as karyoclasis. For Group III, necrosis of tumor cells in different sizes and heterogeneous color in nuclei were observed. For Group IV, the number of tumor cells was significantly smaller than Groups I and III and the tumor cells presented an appearance of crumby structure as cancer nests, with more proliferation of connective tissue. ConclusionsThe treatment of matrine combined with cisplatin can significantly improve the anti-tumor effect on U 14 rats with cervical cancer, which can be a new option for the treatment for cervical cancer...|$|E
40|$|Shrinkage of the {{elongated}} {{anterior cruciate}} ligament (ACL) using radiofrequency (RF) energy gains more and more interest as an alternative method for ACL reconstruction. Although {{there have been a}} few clinical studies on the outcome and complications of RF shrinkage of the elongated ACL, there is a substantial lack of in vivo basic science studies to evaluate the mechanical and histologic changes of such treated tissue. Therfore the aim of the present study was to analyse the biological response of the thermal stimulated collagen tissue using histological and immunohistological techniques. Furthermore we wanted to clarify if the elongated and RF treated ACL reaches the histological and biomechanical properties of the native ACL and is comparable with the properties of an ACL graft after 6 month. 16 female merino sheep received a lift of the tibial ACL insertion site to simulate chronic ACL elongation. Two groups were divided. Group A obtained no further treatment, wereas in group B the elongated ACL was shrunken by RF energy. A descriptive analysis after RF treatment of the native ACL at time zero showed no more regular collagen pattern. Regions which were directly exposed to RF energy suffered complete cell destruction. It showed the typical outcome of a necrosis with karyorrhexis and <b>karyopyknosis</b> of fibroblasts as well as hyalinization of the collagen tissue. After 6 month group B showed a significant increased cellularity in comparison to the group A and the native ACL. In addition the vascular density of the subsynovial and intermediate region of the RF treated tissue was increased by trend compared to the native ACL. Nevertheless we were able to demonstrate a constant higher vascular density in the anterior regions of group B (which were in direct contact with the RF probe) in comparison to the native ACL. Furthermore the RF treated ACL (group B) could not reach the biomechanical properties of the native ACL after 6 month. It showed a significant lower ultimate load and stiffness and a significant increased AP-laxity compared to the native ACL. The histological analysis of group B demonstrated an intensive tissue repopulation and - reorganisation which could give a reasonable explanation for the biomechanical findings. The present study could demonstrate that the process of regeneration of the elongated and RF treated ACL is not terminated after 6 month in opposite to an ACL graft. Moreover the histomorphological as well as the biomechanical properties of the native ACL were not reached. It is therefore reasonable to suggest that strong caution is needed during the time of rehabilitation, considering the impaired ligamentous structure...|$|E
40|$|Objective To {{investigate}} {{the effect of}} continuous irradiation with 125 I radioactive seeds in inhibiting HepG 2 cell proliferation and possible mechanisms in inducing apoptosis. Methods Human hepatoma cell line HepG 2 {{was selected as the}} research object and exposed to continuous irradiation with 125 I radioactive seeds. The initial dose rate was 5. 32 cGy/h, and HepG 2 cells were exposed to a dose of 0, 2, or 4 Gy. A light microscope and Hoechst 33258 staining were used to observe the morphological change of HepG 2 cells, the colony-forming assay was used to calculate plating efficiency, the scratch test was used to evaluate the change in migration ability, flow cytometry was used to measure cell apoptosis, and Western Blot was used to measure the expression of apoptosis-related proteins. An analysis of variance was used for comparison between multiple groups, and the least significant difference method was used for further comparison between any two groups. Results After HepG 2 cells were exposed to 125 I radioactive seeds at a dose of 0 Gy, 2 Gy, or 4 Gy, the 4 Gy group showed a reduction in cell density and {{an increase in the number}} of spherical free dead cells, as was shown by the light microscope; Hoechst 33258 staining showed that the 4 Gy group had typical features of apoptotic cells, such as <b>karyopyknosis,</b> fragmentation, and margination. The colony-forming assay showed that there were significant differences in plating efficiency between the control group, 2 Gy group, and 4 Gy group (120. 00 %± 3. 61 %, 112. 00 %± 2. 00 %, and 45. 00 %± 3. 61 %, F= 508. 90, P＜ 0. 001). The scratch test showed that there were significant differences in cell migration rate between the control group, 2 Gy group, and 4 Gy group (21. 24 %± 4. 36 %, 19. 93 %± 3. 37 %, and 11. 42 %± 0. 65 %, F= 8. 29, P＜ 0. 001). The results of flow cytometry for cell apoptosis showed that there were significant differences in cell apoptosis rate between the control group, 2 Gy group, and 4 Gy group (4. 33 %± 0. 67 %, 6. 90 %± 1. 31 %, and 17. 03 %± 1. 43 %, F= 110. 01, P＜ 0. 001). Western blot showed that 125 I irradiation significantly inhibited the expression of tumor proliferation-related protein PCNA, apoptosis-related protein Survivin, and Bcl- 2 and promoted the expression of pro-apoptotic proteins Bak and Bax. Conclusion 125 I radioactive seeds inhibit the growth of HepG 2 cells through promoting HepG 2 cell apoptosis and inhibiting proliferation and migration.

40|$|Aim: To {{explore the}} {{changes of the}} {{formation}} of cerebral hippocampus in rats with binding stress asthma after treated with shuganlifei method. Methods: The experiment was conducted in the key laboratory of Shanghai University of Traditional Chinese Medicine between March 2002 and January 2003. Fifty-six SD male rats were selected and assigned randomly into 7 groups: normal group, asthma group, stress group, asthma stress group, desamethasone group, regulating lung group and shuganlifei group with 8 rats in each group. The rats in normal group and stress group were treated with 1 mL saline through intraperitoneal injection. Those in other groups were treated with equivalence antigen fluid induced sensitization respectively through intraperitoneal injection. From the 8 th day after sensitization, the both hindlimb of the rats in stress group, asthma stress group, desamethasone group, regulating lung group and shuganlifei group were fixed by band every day vertically for 2 hours and gave the binding stress stimulation, totally for 3 weeks; Meanwhile, the rats in desamethasone group, regulating lung group and shuganlifei group were given desamethasone (0. 75 mg/each) 1 g/(L ·kg) and regulating lung method (ephedra, cassia twig, asarum, dried ginger, pinellia tuber, Chinese magnoliavine fruit and white peony root, all 9 g) 28 g/(mL ·kg) and shuganlifei method (based on the regulating method, 9 g Chinese thorowax root and 9 g immature bitter orange were added) 36 g/(mL ·kg) for gastric perfusion. From the 15 th day after sensitization, the rats in the asthma group, asthma stress group, desamethasone group, regulating lung group and shuganlifei group were given 20 g/L egg albumin absorbing for 3 minutes, totally for 2 weeks. At the ending of building models and treatment, the blood of abdominal aorta was separated from anesthesia rats. The level of plasm corticosterone was tested by radio-immunity method. After exacting the blood, the brain of rats was obtained by bittern the cranium. The form structure of cerebral hippocampal was detected by light microscope and transmission electron microscope. Results: Totally 56 rats were involved in the result analysis without drop. 1 The comparison of the level of plasm corticosterone in every group: It increased significantly in the asthma group and the stress group than that in the normal group [(532. 48 ± 115. 28), (323. 32 ± 100. 40), (235. 27 ± 46. 64) μg/L, (P < 0. 01, < 0. 05) ]. It decreased significantly in the shuganlifei group than that in the asthma stress group [(309. 50 ± 46. 52), (569. 89 ± 72. 32) μg/L(P all < 0. 01) ]. It decreased significantly in the shuganlifei group than that in the regulating lung group [(528. 60 ± 30. 72) μg/L,(P < 0. 01) ]. 2 The comparison of the formation structure of cerebral hippocampus under light microscope in the rats in each group: The pyramidal cells of cerebral hippocampus in the normal group were regularly arranged and the nucleus was round and big with clear nucleolus. The pyramidal cells in the asthma stress group, the desamethasone group and the regulating lung group were irregularly arranged. There were a large number of <b>karyopyknosis</b> of pyramidal cells in the CA 3 area. The pyramidal cells arrangement of cerebral hippocampus in the shuganlifei group was more regular, and the pyknosis neurons in CA 3 area decreased significantly. 3 The comparison of the formation structure of cerebral hippocampus under electron microscope in the rats in each group: The nucleus form of pyramidal cells in cerebral hippocampus in the normal group was regular with smooth karyotheca, the even distribution of nucleus heterochromatin, plenty mitochondrion and regular crest arrangement. It was similar between the asthma stress group and regulating lung group. The nucleus form of pyramidal cells in cerebral hippocampus was irregular, and the nucleus heterochromatin significantly increased with rarefaction cell plasm and most of extended mitochondrion, vacuoles and disorder crest arrangement. The nucleus form of pyramidal cells in cerebral hippocampus in desamethasone was irregular with the organell degeneration. The nucleus form of pyramidal cells in cerebral hippocampus in the shuganlifei group was regular with smooth karyotheca, even distribution of nucleus heterochromatin, cell plasm of rarefaction plenty mitochondrion but compact. Conclusion: The chronic binging stress can evoke or aggravate asthma, induce the increase of the level of plasm corticosterone in the rats with asthma, in order that the form of cerebral hippocampus neuron was injured. The shuganlifei method can play certain protective effects on the form structure of cerebral hippocampus neuron by the means of inhibiting the excretion of plasm corticosterone in the rats with asthma under the condition of stress. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|E
