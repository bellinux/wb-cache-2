5|$|Following Fear and Desire, Kubrick {{began working}} on ideas for a new boxing film. Due to the {{commercial}} failure of his first feature, Kubrick avoided asking for further investments, but commenced a film noir script with Howard O. Sackler. Originally under the title <b>Kiss</b> <b>Me,</b> Kill Me, and then The Nymph and the Maniac, Killer's Kiss (1955) is a 67-minute film noir about a young heavyweight boxer's involvement with a woman being abused by her criminal boss. Like Fear and Desire, it was privately funded by Kubrick's family and friends, with some $40,000 put forward from Bronx pharmacist Morris Bousse. Kubrick began shooting footage in Times Square, and frequently explored during the filming process, experimenting with cinematography and considering the use of unconventional angles and imagery. He initially chose to record the sound on location, but encountered difficulties with shadows from the microphone booms, restricting camera movement. His decision to drop the sound in favor of imagery was a costly one; after 12–14 weeks shooting the picture, he spent some seven months and $35,000 working on the sound.|$|E

25|$|Upon its release, <b>Kiss</b> <b>Me</b> Once {{received}} generally favorable {{reviews from}} most music critics. The {{majority of them}} complimented Minogue's charm and vocal delivery, alongside her return to contemporary pop music. However, critics were polarised towards the content and production; some felt the material was fun, but majority dismissed its memorability and felt it lacked innovation on Minogue's behalf. Commercially, the album performed moderately worldwide, and reached the top 10 in regions like Australia, the United Kingdom, Ireland, Spain, France, New Zealand, and Canada. The lack of commercial success for <b>Kiss</b> <b>Me</b> Once prompt Minogue to leave the company, citing artistic differences.|$|E

In this semi-farcical production, which mixed modern dress with Elizabethan clothing, Katherina {{was very much}} a match for Petruchio, and after apparently delivering her final speech with sincerity, she subsequently embarrassed him by leaving the dining hall alone.
