25|$|Subordinated {{bonds are}} those that have a lower {{priority}} than other bonds of the issuer in case of liquidation. In case of bankruptcy, there is a hierarchy of creditors.

After they have been paid, the subordinated bond holders are paid. As a result, the risk is higher. Therefore, subordinated bonds usually have a lower credit rating than senior bonds. The main examples of subordinated bonds {{can be found in}} bonds issued by banks, and asset-backed securities. The latter are often issued in tranches. The senior tranches <b>get</b> <b>paid</b> back first, the subordinated tranches later.|$|E
