40|$|Pigeons {{were shown}} to come under {{discrimination}} control when the SD and SΔ were temporally separated from reinforcement and non-reinforcement. SD and SΔ consisted of distinctive <b>key</b> illuminations <b>presented</b> <b>separately.</b> Responding on an FR 5 {{in the presence of}} SD or SΔ produced a third stimulus containing a schedule requirement. If this third (or interpolated) stimulus was preceded by SD, responding in its presence produced reinforcement followed by a time-out (TO). If, on the other hand, the third stimulus was preceded by SΔ, responding produced TO alone. In this fashion, the same stimulus and the same response requirement were imposed between SD and the reinforcement as between SΔ and the TO. In Experiment I, the schedule employed during the interpolated stimulus was FR; in Experiment II, FI. Discrimination reversal was accomplished in both experiments...|$|R

40|$|The {{discomfort}} {{caused by}} combined {{noise and vibration}} may {{be different from the}} sum of the discomfort caused by noise and the discomfort caused by vibration when they are <b>presented</b> <b>separately.</b> This experimental study investigated how judgements of discomfort caused by simultaneous noise and vibration depend on the level of noise and the magnitude of vibration. Twenty-four subjects used absolute magnitude estimation to report their discomfort caused by seven levels of noise (70 to 88 dBA SEL), seven magnitudes of vibration (0. 146 to 2. 318 ms- 1. 75), and all 49 possible combinations of noise and vibration. A root-sums-of-squares model was proposed to predict the discomfort of combined noise and vibration from the magnitude estimates of discomfort caused by the noise and the vibration when they are <b>presented</b> <b>separately.</b> </p...|$|R
