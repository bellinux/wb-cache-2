40|$|Polymer drug conjugates are an {{emerging}} class of therapeutic agent that offer advantages {{in the treatment}} of cancer through long circulation times and passive targeting. A further benefit of using a polymeric framework is that it readily allows attachment of targeting motifs to enhance the drug specificity, as well as allowing variation of the drug component. In this work a series of targeted polymer drug conjugates were prepared that incorporated different drugs via peptide linkers designed to be stable in circulation but degradable at the target site. In order to ensure stability in circulation, it was necessary to ensure the drugs were conjugated to the biodegradable linkers via amides, which required the introduction of amine functionalities to the natural-product drugs. The required <b>hemisyntheses</b> were successfully carried out, although yields were sometimes disappointing. An effort to allow an assessment of the pharmacokinetic effects of using a polymeric scaffold was made through the attempted synthesis of low molecular weight analogues of the polymer drug conjugates, with success in some cases. A recently developed polymeric precursor was used in the preparation of the polymer drug conjugates but was found to undergo an unexpected side-reaction, which may prevent the long term development of this particular precursor. The desired conjugates were nonetheless successfully produced on a scale suitable for initial biological testing.

40|$|Solanum nudum Dunal steroids {{have been}} {{reported}} as being antimalarial compounds; however, their concentration in plants is low, meaning that the species could be threatened by over-harvesting for this purpose. Swern oxidation was used for <b>hemisynthesis</b> of diosgenone (one {{of the most active}} steroidal sapogenin diosgenin compounds). Eighteen structural analogues were prepared; three of them were found to be more active than diosgenone (IC 50 27. 9 μM vs. 10. 1 μM, 2. 9 μM and 11. 3 μM). The presence of a 4 -en- 3 -one grouping in the A-ring of the compounds seems to be indispensable for antiplasmodial activity; progesterone (having the same functional group in the steroid A-ring) has also displayed antiplasmodial activity. Quantitative correlations between molecular structure and bioactivity were thus explored in diosgenone and several derivatives using well-established 3 D-QSAR techniques. The models showed that combining electrostatic (70 %) and steric (30 %) fields can explain most variance regarding compound activity.

The oxidation products, flavan- 3, 4 -diols and the corresponding C- 4 ketones, are bioactive compounds and useful intermediates for the <b>hemisynthesis</b> of proanthocyanidins, plant polyphenols which provide beneficial health properties for humans. Determinations of oxidation potentials excluded that catechin derivatives could be directly oxidized by laccase Cu(II), while it resulted in the H-abstraction from benzylic positions being promptly promoted by the enzyme {{in the presence of}} the mediator HBT, the parent species producing in situ the reactive intermediate benzotriazole-N-oxyl (BTNO) radical. A remarkable and unexpected result for the laccase/HBT oxidative system has been the chemoselective insertion of the oxygen atom into the C- 4 -H bond of catechin derivatives. Mechanistic aspects of the oxidation reaction have been investigated in detail for the first time in order to corroborate these results. Since the collected experimental findings could not alone provide information useful to clarify the origin of the observed chemoselectivity, these data were expressly supplemented with information derived by suitable molecular modeling investigations.

40|$|Our {{research}} {{focuses on}} the extended study of antimalarial and anticancer alkaloids isolated from Strychnos usambarensis (leaves and fruits), and is subdivided into two main axes: -	The development of a purification method for natural compounds such as tertiary indolomonoterpenic alkaloids (in particular for isostrychnopentamine or ISP) to improve the isolation process and to get significant quantities of purified compounds. -	The investigation of the pharmacological properties of ISP, especially on Plasmodium falciparum. The {{first part of the}} thesis is devoted to the phytochemical study of S. usambarensis leaves. It includes the development and the optimization of a simple and rapid HPLC method in order to perform a one-step-transposition in preparative scale (J Pharm Biomed Anal, 2011). In parallel to this work, a brand new alkaloid was isolated from the crude alkaloid extract of S. usambarensis leaves, 17 -O-acetyl, 10 -hydroxycorynantheol. The compound, assessed for its antiplasmodial activity on the 3 D 7 and W 2 strains of P. falciparum, represents one of the most active monoindolic alkaloid known to date with a remarkable selectivity for the parasite (Planta Medica, 2011). Fruits were also investigated in order to identify the main components and maybe the presence of ISP. Two major alkaloids were characterized by analytical HPLC and were therefore studied in LC-NMR and mass spectrometry (MS) after solid phase extraction (SPE) : palicoside and akagerine (Phytochem Letters, 2012). In addition, we also carried out <b>hemisynthesis</b> of isostrychnopentamine during the PhD mandate. The concept was to hemisynthetize ISP from 11 -OH usambarine, a tertiary alkaloid more abundant in the leaves. Unfortunately, the first experiments were not as conclusive as expected. The second part of the thesis concerns the investigation of the mode of action of ISP on P. falciparum. A metabolomic approach displaying the metabolomic differences induced in the parasites was combined to a transcriptomic study evaluating genes expression via a microarray analysis, in order to better understand the biological processes involved in P. falciparum in response to ISP. For this purpose we performed a study in 1 H NMR metabolomics on culture media of P. falciparum under ISP treatment. In addition, we investigated gene activation using microarrays and analyzed the alterations of the P. falciparum 3 D 7 transciptome in synchronous cultures after exposure to ISP.

The data demonstrate that: (i) the basic Lys 11 -Arg 12 doublet, although necessary, is not sufficient; (ii) a minimal substrate length of nine amino acids (residues 7 - 15 or 8 - 16) is essential; (iii) those amino acids around the Lys-Arg doublet which contribute to the formation of a possible beta-turn-alpha-helix secondary structure are critical; (iv) substrate recognition by the enzyme may involve several subsites in which structural determinants, situated on both sides of the basic doublet, participate; (v) the NH 2 -terminal sequence of neurophysin plays a critical role in the correct reading of the cleavage sequence by the processing endoprotease. It is proposed, first, that this type of structural feature may constitute the basis of a general coding system for endoproteases involved in the processing of polypeptide hormone precursors; second, that in addition to its role in the intragranular packaging of the nonapeptide hormone, neurophysin plays a key role in the correct processing of its common precursor with ocytocin...|$|E
40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{focuses on}} isolation and structural elucidation of anthocyanins, and their chemical properties. The characterization of anthocyanins from castor (Ricinus communis), fourteen cultivars of European gooseberry (Ribes grosssularia), three other Ribes spp., two cultivars of Jostaberry (R. × nidigrolaria), seven Hippeastrum (Amaryllis) hybridum cultivars, and nineteen species belonging to Caprifoliaceae (genera Sambucus, Lonicera and Viburnum) are described. New anthocyanins include: Cyanidin 3 -O-β-xylopyranoside- 5 -O-β- glucopyranoside (11), cyanidin 3 -O-β-xylopyranoside- 5 -O-β-(6 '''-malonylglucopyranoside) (19) and the methyl esterified product (18), cyanidin 3 -O-β-(6 ''-E-caffeoylglucopyranoside) (15), and cyanidin 3 -O-β-(6 ''-α-arabinopyranosylglucopyranoside) (6), {{which is the}} first complete identification of the disaccharide vicianose. Pigment 15 together with cyanidin 3 -O- β-(6 ''-E-caffeoylglucopyranoside) (17) constitute the major anthocyanin content in the cultivars; ‘Samsø’, ‘Hinnomäki Red’, ‘Taastrup’, ‘Lofthus’ and ‘Glendal’. These cultivars may thus be good candidates for consumption, colorant and breeding programmes, because no other commercial available berries have been reported to contain as high proportions of aromatic acylated anthocyanins. Anthocyanins from black beans (Phaseolus vulgaris) are for the first time hemisynthesized directly from a partly purified anthocyanin extract. The three mother anthocyanins (delphinidin 3 -O-β-glucopyranoside (22), petunidin 3 -O-β-glucopyranoside (26), malvidin 3 -O-β-glucopyranoside (27)) and their <b>hemisynthesis</b> products, 5 - carboxypyranoanthocyanins (32 - 34), were isolated in a preparative scale using Sephadex LH- 20 column chromatography. The individual pigments (22, 26, 27, 32 – 34) were characterized by NMR; the structures of 32 and 33 have previously only been tentatively identified. The 3 -O-β-glucopyranosides of delphinidin, petunidin and malvidin (Phaseolus vulgaris) (22, 26, 27) and cyanidin 3 -O-β-galactopyranoside (from Aronia melanocarpa) (4) have been dissolved in deuterated methanolic solutions without and with acid (5 %, CF 3 COOD). Their hemiacetal (hemiketal) forms were characterized by NMR as two epimeric 2 -hydroxy-hemiacetals. This is the first report of 13 C NMR assignments regarding two epimeric anthocyanin hemiacetal forms. Displacement of nuclear hydrogen by deuterium at various sites on the aglycone part of delphinidin 3 -O-β-glucopyranoside (22), petunidin 3 -O-β-glucopyranoside (26), and malvidin 3 -O-β-glucopyranoside (27) in their flavylium cationic and hemiketal forms were examined based on integration data obtained by 1 H NMR spectroscopy. Similar measurements were performed on the three corresponding pyranoanthocyanins (32 – 34), and the flavonol rutin (quercetin 3 -O-β-(6 ''-α-rhamnopyranosylglucopyranoside), 35. H→D exchanges were observed for the nuclear protons of the A-rings (H- 6 and H- 8) of 22, 26, 27 and 35. No similar H→D exchanges were observed for 32 – 34. This is explained with a generalized mechanism including a positively charged σ–complex. Since the oxygen (6 -O) included in the pyrano-ring of 32 – 34, has not the same electron donating effect as the 5 -OH group of 22, 26 and 27, the positively charged σ–complexes of 32 – 34 can not stabilize themselves to the same level as the corresponding complexes of 22, 26 and 27. The H→D exchange reactions appeared to be independent upon the concentration of the substrates and concentration of D+, in accordance with a first order reaction. Most antioxidant measurements are concentration dependent, and purity determination of examined compounds are crucial. To improve correctness in determination of anthocyanin purity, 1 H and 13 C NMR spectroscopy have been combined with HPLC-DAD and UV-Vis spectroscopy in analysis of anthocyanidin 3 -glycosides and 5 -carboxypyranoanthocyanidin 3 - glycosides. The molar absorptivity (ε) values were found to be relatively similar, in contrast to previously reported literature values. The ε-values for both anthocyanidin 3 - monoglycosides and 5 -carboxypyranoanthocyanidin 3 -glycosides were proposed to be 21800 and 22700 in acidified aqueous and methanolic solutions respectively. To assess the influence of structure on the potential antioxidant capacity of anthocyanins, the 3 -glucosides of pelargonidin (1), cyanidin (5), peonidin (24), delphinidin (22), petunidin (26), malvidin (27), 5 -carboxypyranopelargonidin (28), 5 -carboxypyranocyanidin (30), 5 - carboxypyranodelphinidin (32), 5 -carboxypyranopetunidin (33), and 5 - carboxypyranomalvidin (34) were examined by ferric ion reducing antioxidant power assay, FRAP. The reducing capacities of the individual anthocyanins were in the range of 0. 9 to 5. 2 Trolox equivalents. The two 5 -carboxypyranoanthocyanins 30 and 32, possessing pyrogallolor catechol-type of B-rings, showed the highest potential antioxidant capacity measured by FRAP for any anthocyanin. The relative order of the reducing capacity of the various 5 - carboxypyranoanthocyanidin 3 -glucosides and anthocyanidin 3 -glucosides were nearly alike whether determined by coulometric array detection or FRAP. The inclusion of the 5 -hydroxyl in the D-ring and just one oxygen substituent on the B-ring as in 28, diminished the reducing capacity considerably...|$|E
