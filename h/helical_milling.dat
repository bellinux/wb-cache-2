40|$|Milling is a versatile, {{intermittent}} cutting {{process that is}} used in industry for creating {{many different types of}} components such as aerospace structures, mould and dies as well as thin walled workpieces. To understand the process better, a different contribution towards the variable flow stress machining theory for prediction of intermittent chip formation is presented. A proposed model is developed to extend the application of the variable flow stress machining theory to predict cutting forces in flat <b>helical</b> end <b>milling.</b> Non-uniform chip thickness geometry is yielded as the milling progresses. In applying the variable flow stress machining theory, the uncut chip geometry is portioned into a number of segments by discretizing the radial depth of cut. The chip geometry for each segment is considered to be constant by taking the average value of the maximum and minimum chip thickness. The maximum chip thickness for each chip segment is computed based on the current width of cut, feed per tooth and the cutter diameter. The subsequent radial depth of cut is subtracted from the discretized size of the width of cut to obtain the minimum chip thickness. The milling forces are summed for each infinitesimal segment to obtain the total forces acting on the system of the workpiece and the helical cutter. Oblique cutting conditions are applied to cater for the chip flow direction due to the helix angle. The flow stress of the material is represented by two material constitutive models, the Johnson-Cook constitutive equation and the empirical power law stress-strain relation which is used by Oxley and his co-workers. The models are used to represent the plastic deformation occurring at high strain, strain-rate and temperature in the primary deformation shear zone and tool-chip interface zone to obtain the forces generated during the process. A further model is developed to predict the dynamic chip thickness variation in end milling of thin-walled workpieces. The workpiece is modelled as a flexible cantilever plate and the cutter is assumed to be a rigid body. The specimen is discretised into a number of segments that may have a unique dynamic characteristic. The volume of the removed material is computed at each discrete axial depth of cut and undeformed chip thickness {{as well as at the}} given circumferential section of the tool for each tool step that is taken into account. The variation of the radial depth of cut due to the dynamic displacement of the workpiece is considered in this proposed model. At each time step, the changing workpiece geometry during the milling process is considered by updating the dynamic characteristics of the thin-walled workpiece. Experimental work has been carried out to investigate the characteristics of cutting forces for different cutting conditions with two different work materials and two different <b>helical</b> end <b>mill</b> geometries. The investigation also considers the significant impact of the wall characteristics such as the wall thickness, height and the milling configuration. The outcomes of the experimental investigation are discussed in detail and show the significant effects with the variation of the wall, giving an indication to understanding the machining process in order to build a capable dynamic model.

40|$|A {{comparison}} between the geometry of the <b>helical</b> <b>milling</b> specialized tool and conventional end mill was firstly introduced. Furthermore, a mathematical model, in which the cutting area was divided into different cutting zones, was established to simulate the cutting depths and volume of the different cutting edges (three kinds) on specialized tool. Accordingly, a specific ratio between the volume removed by different edges and the total hole volume was derived mathematically and modeled using 3 D modeling software SolidWorks. Based on the established models, the cutting depths and cutting volume ratio variation trends under different cutting parameters were analyzed. The {{results showed that the}} change rules of cutting depths were different in every cutting zone and influenced greatly by the cutting parameters. In addition, the cutting volume ratio changes with different cutting parameters, but it can only vary in certain range due to the structure of the <b>helical</b> <b>milling</b> specialized tool.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} the present study is to develop {{techniques}} for manufacturing anatomically-shaped substrates of implants made from calcium polyphosphate (CPP) ceramic. These substrates have tissue-engineered cartilage growing on their top surfaces and can be used as implants for osteochondral focal defect repair. While many research groups have been fabricating such substrates using standard material shapes, e. g., rectangles and circular discs, it is considered beneficial to develop methods that can be integrated in the substrate fabrication process to produce an implant that is specific to a patient’s own anatomy (as obtained from computer tomography data) to avoid uneven and/or elevated stress distribution that can affect the survival of cartilage. The custom-made, porous CPP substrates were fabricated with three-dimensional printing (3 DP) and computer numerically controlled (CNC) machining for the first time to the best of the author’s knowledge. The 3 DP technique was employed in two routines: indirect- and direct- 3 DP. In the former, 3 DP was used to fabricate molds for pre-shaping of the CPP substrates from two different powder size ranges (< 75 μm and 106 - 150 μm). In the latter, CPP substrates were produced directly from the retrofitted 3 DP apparatus in a layer-by-layer fashion from 45 - 75 μm CPP powder with a polymeric binder. The prototyped samples were then sintered to obtain the required porosity and mechanical properties. These substrates were characterized in terms of their dimensional shrinkage and density. Also, SEM images were used to assess the particle distribution and neck and bond formations. The substrates produced using the indirect- 3 DP method yielded densities (< 75 μm: 66. 28 ± 11. 62 % and 106 - 150 μm: 65. 87 ± 6. 12 %), which were comparable to the substrates used currently and with some success in animal studies. Geometric adjustment factors were devised to compensate for the slight expansion inherent in the 3 DP mold fabricating process. These equations were used to bring the plaster molds into true dimension. The direct- 3 DP method has proven to be the ultimate choice due to its ability to produce complex anatomically-shaped substrates without the use of a chemical solvent. In addition, it allows for precise control of both pore size and internal architectures of the substrates. Thus, the direct- 3 DP was considered to be superior than the indirect- 3 DP as a fabrication method. In the alternative CNC machining approach to fabrication, the ability to machine the CPP ceramic was feasible and by careful selection of the machining conditions, anatomically-shaped CPP substrates were produced. To develop strategies for optimizing the machining process, a mechanistic model was developed based on curve fitting the average cutting forces to determine the cutting coefficients for CPP. These cutting coefficients were functions of workpiece material, axial depth of cut, chip width, and cutter geometry. To explore the utility of this modelling approach, cutting forces were predicted for a <b>helical</b> ball-end <b>mill</b> and compared with experimental results. The cutting force simulation exhibits good agreement in predicting the fundamental force magnitude and general shape of the actual forces. However, there were some discrepancies between the predicted and measured forces. These differences were attributed to internal microstructure defects, density gradients, and the use of a shear plane model in force prediction that was not entirely appropriate for brittle materials such as CPP. The present study successfully developed 3 DP and CNC fabrication methods for manufacturing anatomically-shaped CPP substrates. Future studies were recommended to explore further optimization of these fabrication methods and to demonstrate the utility of accurate substrates shapes to the clinical application of focal defect repair implants...|$|R
