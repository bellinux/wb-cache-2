40|$|When sowing grain {{we apply}} {{resource}} saving technologies-technologies such as «no till» and a technology called «mini-till». «No till» involves planting crops on untreated surfaces. "Mini-till" {{is designed for}} the planting with minimum tillage. During {{the movement of the}} sowing unit on these agricultural backgrounds we can see working bodies tipping out. Stabilization of the drilling depth is ensured in two ways - by moving part of the weight of the planter on the opener or the installation of ballast weights. Openers of grain drills for resource saving technologies for grain crops can be divided into three groups – foot, disc and anchor. <b>Disc</b> <b>coulter</b> has varieties – single <b>disc,</b> <b>double</b> <b>disc</b> and montesquiu <b>coulter.</b> To analyze the cost of power for the operation of the opener, the following indicators – the minimum engine power of the tractor on the coulter and engine power of tractors per unit of working width. The calculation of the indicators was conducted using data the technical specifications of the planter. Snow coulter drill AGRATOR 4800 provides a wide spread planting strip of 10 - 15 cm. The minimum power of the engine of the tractor on the opener is 7. 5 HP minimum power of tractor engine per unit of working width 25 HP/m. <b>Double</b> <b>disc</b> opener planter Great Plains has a minimum engine power of the tractor on the opener 2. 7 HP and per unit of working width 26. 0 - 28. 44 HP/m.

40|$|The {{basic problem}} {{associated}} with no-till and minimum tillage seeding operations {{is the presence}} of crop residue on fields which does not get cut with the existing seeding machines. This failure to cut crop residue results in improper placement of seed. Special seeding machines have been designed, (e. g., Haybuster 1206 grain and fertilizer drill) to overcome these problems. These machines re­quire extra investment for farmers already having conventional seeding machines if they want to practice minimum and no-tilling farming. The study was, therefore, undertaken to determine the perfor­mance of <b>disc</b> <b>coulters</b> under zero-till practice in the soil bin under different soil conditions and to provide design criteria for modification of existing seed drills so that they could be used under no till conditions. Cone index data on soil penetration resistance and soil moisture content were obtained from no-tilled and fall tilled fields at seeding time to simulate field conditions in the soil bin. Three sizes of <b>disc</b> <b>coulters</b> were evaluated for their cutting ability of the crop-residue in the soil bin. The data of cone index of packed soil, its moisture content, straw moisture content and straw density were also measured. Draft and vertical forces on coulters were reported for each test. Observations and analysis of data indicated a varying degree of crop residue being cut by the coulters under different soil conditions. The <b>disc</b> <b>coulter</b> 460 mm diameter performed satisfactorily and cut the straw at densities up to 5000 kg/ha at 50 mm depth of penetration and deeper...|$|R

40|$|Stand {{establishment}} of crops by direct drilling {{is a function}} of seed germination and seedling emergence efficacy and their interactions with the soil physical micro-environment created by direct drill coulters. Experiments conducted in two contrasting controlled climates using 0. 5 tonne undisturbed turf blocks suggested that the three coulter types compared (viz. an experimental chisel coulter, a hoe and a triple <b>disc</b> <b>coulter)</b> performed significantly differently, in terms of wheat seedling emergence, when the seed was direct drilled into a fine sandy loam soil. Overall the chisel coulter promoted highest seedling emergence (63. 5 %) followed by the hoe coulter (50. 6 %) and the triple <b>disc</b> <b>coulter</b> (27. 0 %). When the initial soil moisture potential was close to permanent wilting point, seedling emergence counts between these three coulters were highly significant with the difference between the chisel and triple <b>disc</b> <b>coulters</b> being almost six-fold. When the initial soil moisture level was adequate, seedling emergence counts from the triple disc grooves, were Still significantly lower than from the chisel and hoe coulters which themselves performed equally. When the controlled relative humidity was increased from 60 % to 90 %, seedling emergence increased but this difference was significant only at a lower level of probability of P = 0. 10. Application of pressures (using press wheels) up to 70 kPa over the covered seeds after bar harrowing had no significant effect on seedling emergence at either the low or adequate initial soil moisture levels. When similar pressures were applied directly over the uncovered seeds, seedling emergence significantly increased to 60 % in the hoe coulter grooves and to 28 % in the triple <b>disc</b> <b>coulter</b> grooves compared to the impressed seeds. No significant increase was observed from the chisel coulter groove {{as a result of these}} pressures because it had already promoted a high seedling emergence count of 58 %. Further experiments, using small undisturbed turf blocks, to examine more closely the poor performance of the triple <b>disc</b> <b>coulter,</b> indicated that smearing had not been the main cause of seedling emergence failure. When the triple <b>disc</b> <b>coulter</b> grooves were modified using combinations of pressure applications and seed covering techniques, seedling emergence was significantly improved. It appeared that this improvement in seedling emergence was a function of a modified soil physical micro-environment at the seed-soil interface. Based on these results two hypotheses were evolved. The first hypothesis suggested that the transfer of liquid soil moisture to the seed for germination (and perhaps away from the unprotected seedling after germination but prior to emergence) could be altered by the shape of the seed groove and placement and covering of the seed. This was described as "soil moisture diffusion" The second hypothesis suggested that after the germination, subterranean seedling survival depended on the availability of vapour phase moisture which was also a function of the groove shape and covering medium. This was described as "soil moisture captivity". A thermo-electric dew point hygrometer was used to measure the in-groove vapour moisture potential within the drilled grooves in the larger turf blocks, in a controlled environment. Significant and repeatable differences in the drying rates of the grooves created by the three coulter types were measured and promised to at least partly explain the underlying causes of their abilities (or lack of abilities in some cases) to promote seedling emergence. Combined counts of seedling emergence and sub-surface seedling survival were moderately correlated (r = 0. 71) with the corresponding rates of loss of in-groove soil vapour moisture. It appeared from the data that the important design characteristics for direct drilling coulters were that they must have the ability to both exploit the limited supply of sub-surface liquid moisture for germination and also retain soil moisture in the vapour form for seedling emergence and/or survival. The latter function appeared to be aided by the creation of minimum surface shattering and maintenance of a high incidence of surface mulch in the form of sod or organic matter. Field experiments suggested that when the only measured soil moisture data available was at or prior to drilling, the present state of knowledge would not permit accurate seedling emergence data to be predicted for any given coulter and covering technique. If however, soil moisture data was available for the period between drilling and seedling emergence, reasonable predictions of seedling emergence could be made, given the characteristics of the coulter types and covering techniques used. Examples of mathematical models were constructed for each of the three coulter types used, to predict seedling emergence as a function of these soil moisture data. The field experiments also confirmed that higher seedling emergence counts could be expected when the chisel coulter was used in dry soils compared with the hoe or triple <b>disc</b> <b>coulters.</b> During a typical spring-summer-autumn period in the Manawatu, when wheat seed was direct-drilled at fortnightly intervals into a "Tokomaru silt loam soil"; from 16 % of the drillings the chisel coulter promoted significantly higher seedling emergence counts than either the hoe or triple <b>disc</b> <b>coulters...</b>|$|R

40|$|During {{the process}} of direct {{drilling}} different shaped drill coulters have been observed to create different micro-environments at the seed zone. This study has been to examine possible changes in soil structure {{and the state of}} soil compaction around the groove, which in turn might affect root penetration. Several methods and pieces of equipment were developed to investigate the influence on the soil of two contrasting coulter shapes. These were the commercially-available triple <b>disc</b> <b>coulter</b> and an experimental chisel coulter. To measure soil bulk density in the drilled groove zone, a small core sampler was designed and tested. Soil strength was assessed using a modified multi-point penetrometer which could be inserted vertically into the soil or normal to the groove walls. The instantaneous and permanent soil pressure zone of influence around the groove, which was created by the passing of the coulters, was monitored using a liquid-filled tube with a terminal diaphragm and a minipressure transducer. Macroscopic visual assessment of the compaction of soil at the seed level was undertaken using a freezing sampling technique which facilitated thin section subsamples to be studied by photographic techniques. In addition, 3 mm 3 subsamples were taken directly from the grooves for electron microscopy study. Supplementary measurements included draft force and the coulter-passage-disturbance-zone at the soil surface using a load cell and a displacement transducer respectively. Wheat and lupin seeds were sown to study the effects of soil changes on root growth of a fibrous and tap root system. The data suggested that the triple <b>disc</b> <b>coulter</b> tended to compact well-defined zones around the groove while the chisel coulter produced no apparent compaction. Such soil compaction in a moist silt loam of initial bulk density less than 1. 1 g/cc did not result in any apparent differences in plant root responses between the two coulter types. In a drier, harder soil however (greater than 1. 32 g/cc) there appeared to be a clear disadvantage from use of the triple <b>disc</b> <b>coulter</b> in this respect. With lupin, root growth was restricted and deformed from use of the latter coulter, while in the case of wheat, seedling emergence was restricted in comparison with the chisel coulter. Smearing was found on the groove wall in moist soil with the triple <b>disc</b> <b>coulter</b> but the experiments were not able to show any mechanical restriction to root and plant development arising from the smear. In the field conditions, in contrast to the laboratory conditions (where seedling performance and root growth were better with the chisel coulter in almost all of the tested conditions except with moist and loose soil where it was equivalent to the triple disc) any localised compaction of soil by the triple <b>disc</b> <b>coulter</b> (particularly at and near the base of the groove) appeared to be compensated by other factors (weather, earthworms etc.) during the plant's full growth cycle. Compaction and mechanical impedance in isolation {{did not appear to be}} solely responsible for the root and plant growth responses. A physiological study of soil moisture transport process and soil water vapour availability in the seed zone should therefore be the subject of further studies...|$|R
