Clinical diagnosis was somewhat delayed as the disease is largely unknown to Canada and was manifested by a nonresponsive anemia which was not easily explained on peripheral blood evaluation alone, and concomitant interstitial nephritis. On post mortem examination splenomegaly was the main <b>gross</b> <b>pathological</b> <b>finding.</b> Light microscopic examination of bone marrow aspirates and subsequent electron microscopic examination of splenic and hepatic tissues revealed numerous Leishman-Donovan bodies in cells of the reticuloendothelial system. Parasitized reticuloendothelial cells were seen singly or forming granulomata. These latter did not contain giant cells and were confined mainly to the liver and spleen, being sparse and single in the first but extremely numerous and coalescing in the latter. Accumulation of intrafollicular hyaline material was seen in {{a small number of}} splenic follicles. Leishman-Donovan bodies on electron microscopic examination had a trilaminar periplast, a large round nucleus with heavy blocks of marginated chromatin and two nucleoli, a short flagellum and a kinetoplast. Lymph nodes and bone marrow had numerous parasitized macrophages but no granulomata. Leishman-Donovan bodies were not detected in the lungs and kidneys both of which exhibited a chronic intersitital reaction. The comparative hematological profile as well as the importance of bone marrow and electron microscopic examinations of the spleen and liver in diagnosis are discussed.

40|$|Renal {{diseases}} in sheep form a diverse spectrum of pathology and an extensive literature review of spontaneously occurring and experimentally induced {{diseases of the}} sheep kidney is presented in Chapter 1 of this thesis to provide a comparison with the lesions found {{in a survey of}} kidneys in slaughter-house killed sheep. The presentation of results of this survey form the major part of this thesis and provides information on these diseases relative to large populations of sheep which is only sparsely reported elsewhere. The abnormal kidneys under study were obtained from 444 of 13, 988 sheep slaughtered over a consecutive five day period at the Borthwick's freezing works, Longburn in January 1980. The prevalence of renal disease was 3. 18 per cent and no significant variation (p< 0. 05) in the prevalence of lesions was found between the various lines, chains and daily totals of sheep examined. From these sheep a total of 830 diseased kidneys were found and these were categorized into seven groups according to the major pathological lesion in each. In some kidneys additional minor lesions were present, making a total of 1212 macroscopic lesions identified. White spots and streaks constituted the major <b>gross</b> <b>pathological</b> <b>finding</b> in 188 kidneys; pale, red and brown discolouration in 174, 120 and 179 respectively; scars in 107; cysts in 37 and nodules in 25 kidneys. Abscesses, neoplasms and focal space occupying lesions of uncertain aetiology were included under the category of nodule. Pieces of tissue selected from 181 kidneys to represent the various lesions seen at gross examination were examined histologically. These were identified, recorded and graded according to the anatomical location, pattern of distribution, tissue changes and degree of severity. The main histopathological feature of the white spotted kidneys was chronic, mainly multifocal inflammation of the cortical interstitium. Similar but radially disposed inflammatory lesions with marked fibrosis occurred in the scarred kidneys. The pattern of these lesions suggested a haematogenous distribution of a pathogen in the spotted kidneys while the scarred kidneys were probably the result of ascending inflammation or infarctive processes. Kidneys with pale discolouration showed mild to moderately severe nephrosis of the cortical epithelial cells;, while kidneys with brown discolouration showed corticotubular intracytoplasmic and intralumenal haemosiderin deposition. In some kidneys haemosiderosis was restricted to areas of scarring. Red discoloured kidneys showed patchy or diffuse congestion. Cystic lesions were either parasitic or the result of urinary retention caused by blockage of tubules. In the latter, the blockage was either congenital or associated with chronic inflammation. With the exception of nephrosis and congestion all the lesions were chronic in nature and for most of them a definitive aetiological diagnosis was not established. In fact, in only those lesions containing Echinococcus granulosus hydatid cysts could such a diagnosis be made. Additional studies are indicated for the provision of further information on (a) the prevalence of renal {{diseases in}}. different geographical locations, (b) variation of disease types from area to area and (c) the causes of the lesions identified from this type of investigation...|$|E

40|$|Abstract Backgroud Soshiho-tang (SST, Xiao-chai-hu-tang in Chinese and Sho-saiko-to in Japanese), {{an oriental}} herbal formula, {{is used for}} {{treatment}} of chronic liver diseases. Although many researchers have studied the pharmacological properties of SST, information about its safety and toxicity is limited. Therefore, we evaluated the potential safety of SST in Sprague–Dawley rats {{over a period of}} 4 -weeks. Methods The SST was administered once daily by gavage to male and female rats at doses of 0, 500, 1000 and 2000 mg/kg/day for 4 weeks. We measured the body weight, mortality, food consumption, ophthalmoscopy, urinalysis, hematology, serum biochemistry, <b>gross</b> <b>pathological</b> <b>findings,</b> absolute/relative organ weights and histopathology. In addition, we analyzed the component of SST and measured the stability of its component in SST according to study periods using high performance liquid chromatography. Results The SST treatment did not result in any toxicologically significant changes in mortality, food consumption, ophthalmoscopy, urinalysis, hematology, serum biochemistry, <b>gross</b> <b>pathological</b> <b>findings,</b> absolute/relative organ weights and histopathology, except for salivation and reduction in body weight in the 2000 mg/kg/day male group. These findings in the 2000 mg/kg/day male group are considered toxicologically insignificant because they are not accompanied by other <b>pathological</b> <b>findings,</b> including in hematology, serum biochemistry and histopatholgy, and they do not exhibit a dose–response relationship. SST is detected three components including liquiritin, baicalin, and glycyrrhizin. In addition, there were not observed the significant differences among the contents of three components in SST according to storage periods. Conclusion These results indicate that SST may be a safe material. Based on these results, the no-observed-adverse-effect level was more than 2000 mg/kg for both genders. </p...|$|R

Not all non-necrotising granulomas are sarcoidosis; however, other causes of non-necrotising granulomas need to be excluded. The diagnosis requires exclusion of these other causes and often clinical evidence of sarcoidosis elsewhere. Stains and cultures for bacteria, mycobacteria and fungus should be negative. These studies are indicated even in patients with previously diagnosed sarcoidosis, because secondary infections can develop, especially in patients who have had corticosteroid treatment.|$|R

Fluorescent-antibody staining detected large amounts of measles antigen in lymphatic tissues, the gastrointestinal and respiratory tracts, the salivary glands, pancreas, liver, kidney, and other visceral tissues. Live attenuated or inactivated measles vaccine proved equally effective in preventing fatal measles in marmosets. Challenge with live virus of animals which were primed 1 year previously with inactivated alum-absorbed vaccine resulted in a precipitous response, with a 100 - to 1, 000 -fold increase in antibody titers. This vigorous booster response suggests the existence of a primary deficiency in lymphocyte cooperation in marmosets, which upon adequate priming is followed by extensive clonal expansion and antibody synthesis.

The current study was an opportunistic investigation of these naturally occurring bovine abortions to assess causality of abortion and vertical transmission of FMDV from infected cows to fetuses. For this purpose, fetal tissue samples of eight abortuses (heart, liver, kidney, spleen, palatine tonsil, umbilical cord, soft palate, tongue, lungs, and submandibular lymph node) were collected and screened by various detection methods, including viral genome detection, virus isolation, and immunomicroscopy. Amongst these cases, <b>gross</b> <b>pathological</b> changes were observed in 3 abortuses. <b>Gross</b> <b>pathological</b> <b>findings</b> included blood-tinged peritoneal and pleural effusions and myocarditis.

Further research on disease pathogenesis, pathogen-host-interactions and new prophylactic and therapeutic approaches are needed. In most studies, {{a large number of}} experimental animals are required to assess lung alterations at different stages of the disease. In order to reduce the required number of animals but nevertheless gather information on {{the nature and extent of}} lung alterations in living pigs, a computed tomographic scoring system for quantifying <b>gross</b> <b>pathological</b> <b>findings</b> was developed. In this study, five healthy pigs served as control animals while 24 pigs were infected with App, the causative agent of pleuropneumonia in pigs, in an established model for respiratory tract disease. Results Computed tomographic (CT) findings during the course of App challenge were verified by radiological imaging, clinical, serological, gross pathology and histological examinations. Findings from clinical examinations and both CT and radiological imaging, were recorded on day 7 and day 21 after challenge. Clinical signs after experimental App challenge were indicative of acute to chronic disease. Lung CT findings of infected pigs comprised ground-glass opacities and consolidation. On day 7 and 21 the clinical scores significantly correlated with the scores of both imaging techniques. At day 21, significant correlations were found between clinical scores, CT scores and lung lesion scores. In 19 out of 22 challenged pigs the determined disease grades (not affected, slightly affected, moderately affected, severely affected) from CT and <b>gross</b> <b>pathological</b> examination were in accordance. Disease classification by radiography and gross pathology agreed in 11 out of 24 pigs. Conclusions High-resolution, high-contrast CT examination with no overlapping of organs is superior to radiography in the assessment of pneumonic lung lesions after App challenge. The new CT scoring system allows for quantification of <b>gross</b> <b>pathological</b> lung alterations in living pigs.

Some changes in weights of male rats between the control group and the experimental groups were observed, but no significant changes in the weights of female rats were noted. To identify abnormalities in organs and tissues, we stained representative sections of each specified organ with hematoxylin and eosin for examination with a light microscope. No significant abnormalities were observed in any of the organs or tissues. Conclusion:The results suggest that intravenous injection of SMS is a safe method of treatment...|$|R
40|$|Background: Jawarish Jalinoos (JJ) is a {{classical}} semisolid traditional Unani formulation clinically {{used for the}} treatment of weakness of vital organs, liver, and stomach. Although JJ has been widely used clinically for several decades, no scientific report is available for its safety. Methods: JJ and its sugar-free tablet version (SFJJ; formulated to target diabetic population) were assessed for safety in rats. Ninety-day repeated dose oral toxicity study was performed as per the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development Guideline 408. JJ was orally administered at the dose of 2000  mg/kg bw/d, whereas SFJJ was orally administered at the doses of 506  mg/kg body weight (bw) /d, 1012  mg/kg bw/d, and 2024  mg/kg bw/d for 90 days. The animals were periodically observed for clinical signs of toxicity, mortality, morbidity, body weight changes, and feed consumption. At the end of the study, hematology, clinical biochemistry, electrolytes, gross pathology, relative organ weight, and histological examination were performed. Results: Treatment with SFJJ and JJ showed no significant differences in body weight gain, feed consumption, hematology, clinical biochemistry, and serum electrolytes. No <b>gross</b> <b>pathological</b> <b>findings</b> and differences in relative organ weights were observed between control and drug treated rats. Histological examination revealed no toxicologically significant abnormalities related with SFJJ or JJ treatment. Conclusion: The 90 -day repeated dose oral toxicity study demonstrates that the no observed adverse effect level of SFJJ and JJ is greater than 2024  mg/kg bw/d and 2000  mg/kg bw/d (p. o.) in rats, respectively. Both formulations were found to be safe up to the tested dose levels and experimental conditions, and therefore safe for clinical use as specified in the literature...|$|R
40|$|Deposited with {{permission}} of the author. © 1981 Dr. John Douglas BurtonJaw disease in kangaroos and wallabies, while uncommon in animals living in the free state, is {{a major cause of}} death in captive macropods. There are two major schools of thought regarding its aetiology. The first accepts the findings of Fox (1923) and considers the disease to be actinomycosis while the second believes jaw disease to be one manifestation of necrobacillosis. Regardless of the belief of the authors the clinical and pathological descriptions indicate the condition attacking macropods throughout the world is a single disease. Over one hundred affected macropods were examined {{during the course of this}} study and few species were found to be spared from jaw disease. Cases of lumpy jaw most commonly occurred in the winter months. All ages of macropods were affected although a higher prevalence was recorded in younger animals; however this may have been a reflection of the age of macropods in the zoo under study. The most common site of infection was the premolar and anterior molar region of the oral cavity, regardless of the age of the animal. The <b>gross</b> <b>pathological</b> <b>findings</b> were similar to the descriptions of affected animals by various authors throughout the world. The site of infection could generally be recognized at the gingival crevice, commonly between teeth, and excessive calculus formation associated with gingivitis and gingival recession was a common finding in affected animals. Penetration of the gingival mucosae by plant fibre was not found to be a significant predisposing factor in the initiation of the disease. (For complete abstract open document.) Open Acces...|$|R
40|$|The {{objective}} of this research project was to evaluate the clinical effect of Dimethyl sulphoxide in the symptomatic treatment of sheep suffering from heartwater caused by lichia ruminantiumforrmerly Cowdria ruminantium). 32 Merino crossbred sheep were used of which, 16 were infected with heartwater and 16 were control animals. Of the 16 sheep infected with heartwater, 8 were treated with a 10 % solution of DMSO in polyionic fluid at the dose rate of 1 g/kg twice daily for three consecutive days. Treatment was initiated {{two days after the}} onset of clinical disease. Eight of the control sheep were treated with DMSO following the same protocol. The remaining 8 infected and 8 not infected sheep were given similar volumes of polyionic fluid as placebo treatment. Arterial and venous blood samples for blood gas, haematocrit and total plasma protein measurement were collected daily from 5 days before, to 7 days following the onset of clinical disease. <b>Gross</b> <b>pathological</b> <b>findings</b> and cytological confirmation of the disease were recorded for the 16 infected sheep. The infected sheep treated with DMSO were able to maintain pulmonary gas exchange, had reduced pleural effusion and plasma protein loss compared to the untreated infected sheep that became hypoxic, developed severe pleural effusion and plasma protein loss. However, the infected sheep treated with DMSO developed a mild uncompensated metabolic acidosis. Non-infected sheep treated with DMSO showed reduced appetite while non-infected untreated sheep remained normal. The reduction in pleural effusion, maintenance of gaseous exchange and plasma protein levels, {{as a result of the}} use of DMSO in the symptomatic treatment of sheep suffering from heartwater, are considered beneficial.

40|$|The {{objectives}} of the work were to study the features of experimentally induced canine mastitis and to present hypotheses regarding the pathogenesis of the disease. The tight caudal abdominal mammary gland of six bitches was inoculated on day 8 after whelping with Staphylococcus intermedius to induce mastitis; adjacent mammary glands were used as controls. Clinical examination, bacteriological and cytological (whiteside test, Giemsa) examination of mammary secretion, as well as haematological tests were performed from 5 days before until 34 days after challenge. Mastectomy was sequentially performed 1, 2, 4, 18, 26 and 34 days after challenge {{in each of the}} bitches, in order to carry out a pathological examination of mammary glands. All animals developed clinical mastitis: challenged glands became painful, hot, enlarged and oedematous; secretion was brownish, purulent, with flakes or clots, subsequently becoming yellowish and thick. Staphylococci were isolated from all inoculated glands (up to 22 days). WST was positive in 41 / 46 samples from inoculated glands and 66 / 138 samples from control glands; neutrophils predominated during the acute stage. Blood leukocyte counts increased, whilst platelet counts decreased. <b>Gross</b> <b>pathological</b> <b>findings</b> initially included congestion, purulent discharge and subcutaneous oedema; then abscesses, brownish areas and size decrease were seen. Salient histopathological features were initially neutrophilic infiltration, haemorrhages, destruction of mammary epithelial cells and alveoli, and then infiltration by lymphocytes, shrunken alveoli, loss of glandular architecture and fibrous tissue proliferation. We conclude that in bitches, intrammamary inoculation of Staphylococcus intermedius can induce clinical mastitis, followed by subclinical disease. The disorder is characterized by bacteria isolation and leukocyte influx in challenged glands, by leukocyte presence in adjacent mammary glands, by increased blood leukocyte counts and by destruction of mammary parenchyma.

The patient died of disease thirteen months after the first operation. On the basis of the clinical and pathological features of this case, we consider that CoCC clinically resembles CCC and prognosis may be unfavorable, although it has characteristic <b>pathological</b> <b>findings.</b> It is still controversial whether CoCC should be accepted as a separate entity. The significance of repeat hepatectomy for recurrence and adjuvant chemotherapy should be clarified to improve the prognosis of CoCC. 68 才，男性．肝S 4 の径 3 cmの胆管細胞癌の診断で肝部分切除およびリンパ節廓清術を施行した．病理組織診断は細胆管細胞癌でリンパ管侵襲と静脈侵襲を伴っていた． 7 ヶ月後のCTで肝S 7 とS 8 に 2 個の再発腫瘍を認めたため，再肝切除術を行った．肉眼および病理所見は前回の腫瘍と同様であった． 2 回目の手術から 4 ヶ月後のCTで肝内胆管の拡張と肝門部のリンパ節腫大を認め，初回手術から 13 ヶ月後に癌死した．本症例の臨床病理学的特徴からは，細胆管細胞癌は特異的な病理学的特徴を有するものの，臨床的には胆管細胞癌と類似し予後不良であると考えられる．細胆管細胞癌の予後の向上のために，再発に対する再肝切除や補助化学療法の意義を明らかにすべきである...|$|R
40|$|Abstract Background Nuna Kadugu (NK), a Siddha {{medicine}} prepared from {{leaves and}} fruits of Morinda Pubescens, {{used for the}} treatment of various skin diseases. Though NK has been widely used for several decades, no scientific report was available on its safety. Present study was undertaken to demonstrate the oral toxicity of NK in Sprague Dawley rats. Methods Acute and 28 -day repeated oral toxicity studies were performed following OECD test guidelines 423 and 407, respectively, with minor modifications. In acute oral toxicity study, NK was administered at 2000 mg/kg b. wt., p. o and animals were observed for toxic signs at 0, 0. 5, 1, 4, 24 h and for next 14 days. Gross pathology was performed {{at the end of the}} study. In repeated dose, the 28 - day oral toxicity study, NK was administered at 300, 600 and 900 mg/kg b. wt. /p. o/day. Two satellite groups (control and high dose) were also maintained to determine the delayed onset toxicity of NK. Animals were observed for mortality, morbidity, body weight changes, feed and water intake. Haematology, clinical biochemistry, electrolytes, gross pathology, relative organ weight and histopathological examination were performed. Results In acute toxicity study, no treatment related death or toxic signs were observed with NK administration. In the repeated dose study, no significant differences in body weight changes, food / water intake, haematology, clinical biochemistry and electrolytes content were observed between control and NK groups. No <b>gross</b> <b>pathological</b> <b>findings</b> and difference in relative organ weights were observed between control and NK treated rats. Histopathological examination revealed no abnormalities with NK treatment. Conclusion Acute study reveals that the LD 50 of NK is greater than 2000 mg/kg, b. wt. in fasted female rats and can be classified as Category 5. 28 -day repeated oral toxicity demonstrates that the No Observed Adverse Effect Level of NK is greater than 900 mg/kg b. wt. /day, p. o in rats. There were no delayed effects in NK satellite group. In conclusion, NK was found to be non-toxic in the tested doses and experimental conditions. </p...|$|R
40|$|Context Pancreas, lung, {{kidney and}} liver injury {{has been proven}} to play an {{important}} role in severe acute pancreatitis. Objective To observe the protective effects of dexamethasone on multiple organs (pancreas, lung, kidney and liver) in rats with severe acute pancreatitis. Animals One hundred and thirty-five Sprague-Dawley rats. Design Ninety rats were prepared as severe acute pancreatitis models and were randomly divided into a control group and the dexamethasone treatment group (45 rats in each group). Another 45 rats were selected to be the sham operation group. Each group was randomly subdivided into 3 subgroups which were observed at 3, 6, and 12 h after surgery (15 rats in each subgroup). Main outcome measures The survival, <b>gross</b> and <b>pathological</b> <b>findings</b> under the light microscope, and the pathological scores of multiple organs in each group were recorded. Results There was no significant difference in survival between the dexamethasone treatment group and the control group (P= 0. 494).

40|$|The {{effects of}} vasectomy on testes and related {{structures}} of animal species {{and men are}} largely disputable. These possible effects were studied in the ram, an established experimental animal model used to investigate genitalia pathophysiology. In each of five rains, vasectomy in the left spermatic cord was carried out; subsequently, the clinical and ultrasonographic features were monitored up to 12 months postoperatively. The rams were sequentially euthanatized 1, 3, 6, 9 and 12 months post-operatively; gross-and histo-pathological examination of their testes and related structures were carried out. Four of the five rams developed sperm granulomas at the proximal to the testis end of vas deferens or/and at {{the tail of the}} epididymis; these were palpable from the first and the third month after vasectomy, respectively. Ultrasonographic findings on the vasectomy side were increased size and echogenicity of the epididymal tail, as well as anechoic areas, representing sperm granulomas, visible in the epididymal tail I week after vasectomy and in the proximal to the testis end of vas deferens 4 weeks after vasectomy. <b>Gross</b> <b>pathological</b> <b>findings</b> were limited on the vasectomy side and included adhesions between the parietal and the visceral vaginal tunic, enlarged and firm epididymal tail and presence of sperm granulomas at the epididymal tail or/and at the proximal to the testis end of vas deferens; the granulomas contained creamy material. Histopathological changes were observed mainly in the epididymal tails, consisting of a central mass of spermatozoa, surrounded by a layer of macrophages, surrounded in turn by loose vascular connective tissue rich in lymphocytes and plasma cells. With the exception of signs of mild hypospermatogenesis observed in one ram euthanatized 9 months after surgery, and of a slight increase in seminiferous tubule diameter and in seminiferous epithelium height in the rams euthanatized 6 and 9 months after surgery, which are both findings of no clinical importance, no clinical, ultrasonographic, gross- or other histo-pathological changes were observed in the testicular parenchyma during a 12 -month post-operative period. These results demonstrate that vasectomy has little if any detrimental effect on the morphologic characteristics of the spermatogenesis F in rams. (C) 2006 Elsevier B. V. All rights reserved...|$|R
