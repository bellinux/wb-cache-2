25|$|The {{first step}} in the {{development}} of ACE inhibitors was the discovery of ACE in plasma by Leonard T. Skeggs and his colleagues in 1956. Brazilian scientist Sérgio Henrique Ferreira reported a bradykinin-potentiating factor (BPF) present in the venom of Bothrops jararaca, a South American pit viper, in 1965. Ferreira then went to John Vane's laboratory as a postdoctoral <b>fellow</b> <b>with</b> his already-isolated BPF. The conversion of the inactive angiotensin I to the potent angiotensin II was thought to take place in the plasma. However, in 1967, Kevin K. F. Ng and John R. Vane showed plasma ACE is too slow to account for the conversion of angiotensin I to angiotensin II in vivo. Subsequent investigation showed rapid conversion occurs during its passage through the pulmonary circulation.|$|E

After earning a BSc in physics, chemistry and mathematics in 1955 and an MSc in physics in 1957 from the same institution, he joined Tata Institute of Fundamental Research as a research assistant the same year. Subsequently, taking a sabbatical from service, he enrolled for doctoral studies at University of California, Berkeley and worked {{under the guidance of}} Geoffrey Chew, known for his contributions to the fields of mesons and bootstrap model, to secure a PhD in 1962. He stayed in the US to complete his post-doctoral work at three institutions, Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory (1959–62) as a graduate student, California Institute of Technology (1962–63) as a research <b>fellow</b> <b>with</b> Murray Gell-Mann and Institute for Advanced Study, Princeton (1963–64) as a member.|$|E

They compare it to the incredible pace of scientific and technological growth during the Song dynasty (960–1279 CE). However, they also argue that without the influence of proto-scientific precepts in the ancient philosophy of Mohism, Chinese science continued to lack a definitive structure: ...|$|E

[...] He was to serve as the running backs coach for the team in the league that planned to begin play in April 2008. [...] However, the league never materialized. [...] Wheatley interned as an NFL Minority coaching <b>fellow</b> <b>with</b> the Pittsburgh Steelers during the summer of 2008 training camp. He also served at the Rising Stars Football Camp as an assistant instructor. In late August 2008, he became the assistant coach at Ohio Northern University, with responsibility for the team's running backs.

He stated first and second that [...] "American intervention would diminish Iran's influence in the Arab world" [...] and that [...] "a more muscular American policy could keep the conflict from spreading" [...] with [...] "sectarian strife in Lebanon and Iraq". Third, Boot argued that [...] "training and equipping reliable partners within Syria's internal opposition" [...] could help [...] "create a bulwark against extremist groups like Al Qaeda". He concluded that [...] "American leadership on Syria could improve relations with key allies like Turkey and Qatar" [...] as well as [...] "end a terrible human-rights disaster".|$|E

500|$|The next {{extended}} {{stop was}} at Mainz. The Elector was ill, but the Mozarts gave three concerts in the town, which brought in 200 gulden. From Mainz the family took the market boat up the River Main to Frankfurt, where several public concerts were given. Among those {{present at the}} first of these was the fourteen-year-old Johann Wolfgang von Goethe, who would many years later recall [...] "the little <b>fellow</b> <b>with</b> his wig and his sword". An advertisement for these concerts announced that [...] "the girl" [...] would play [...] "the most difficult pieces by the greatest masters", while [...] "the boy" [...] would play a concerto on the violin and also repeat his Vienna trick of playing with the keyboard completely covered by a cloth. Finally [...] "he will improvise out of his head, not only on the fortepiano but also on the organ...in all the keys, even the most difficult, that he may be asked".|$|E
500|$|Oana {{was married}} {{multiple}} times. With his first wife, Arma Puninani Richardson, {{he had two}} sons, George (born 1928) and Henry (born 1929). [...] On October 1, 1935, {{he was married to}} Joyce Powell of Winter Haven, Florida. By 1942, he had remarried to Patricial Hall of Atlanta. [...] In 1946, he was reported to be happily married to a Texas girl. He also had at least two marriages late in life, in 1968 to a woman named Cynthia, and in 1974 to Opal Gunn. Spencer Abbott, Oana's minor league manager in Portland and Atlanta, recalled that Oana [...] "worried hell out of me." [...] According to Abbott, Oana had friends in every town, and [...] "it was tough for him to live anything resembling a Spartan life." [...] Abbott speculated that, despite having major league talent, Oana's lifestyle may have held him back from becoming a star in the major leagues. [...] In 1946, Abbott opined: [...] "If he had been a less handsome <b>fellow</b> <b>with</b> the same ability he might have been a ten-year star now in the major leagues." ...|$|E
500|$|Three {{decades after}} Murrell's death, {{in the late}} 19th century, Morrison visited Hadleigh on a holiday, expressing {{the view that the}} area was [...] "still in the eighteenth century as regards aspect, costume, habits, and mode of thought". He learned about Murrell, and decided [...] "to write a story about him", believing that [...] "some might {{find it hard to believe}} that such a man, {{practicing}} such arts and wielding such influence, could have lived so recently within so short a distance from London". The landlord of the Castle Inn, a local pub, showed Morrison to the house in which Murrell had once lived, and the journalist was also able to meet with Choppen, the smith who had made Murrell's witch bottles. Morrison found that Choppen was living in a small house on the outskirts of Hadleigh; the craftsman revealed that while he had none of the bottles left, he was in possession of Murrell's spectacles. Morrison subsequently met with Murrell's son Edward [...] "a short, sturdy old <b>fellow,</b> <b>with</b> ashock head of loose, white hair" [...] who was then living in Thundersley. Morrison subsequently authored Cunning Murrell, a fictitious account of Murrell's life, as well as a more objective account, the latter for The Strand magazine. It was Morrison's novel that turned Murrell into a national figure and [...] "inflated the name of the old Essex wizard above all others of his craft".|$|E
