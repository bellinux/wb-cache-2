The targeted respondents of this study were several course content instructors from several different programs of Malaysian community colleges. Students from semester four <b>undertaking</b> <b>certificate</b> courses from various disciplines of studies were also involved in this research.

40|$|This study {{considers}} {{the determinants of}} whether a firm <b>exports,</b> <b>undertakes</b> R&D and/or innovates, and, in particular, the contemporaneous links between these variables using three waves of the UK Community Innovation Survey (CIS). Where appropriate, an instrumental variables procedure is employed to overcome problems of endogeneity. The results show that in both manufacturing and services, being involved in exporting increased the probability that an establishment was engaged in spending on R&D. Spending on R&D in manufacturing had a much larger impact on the probability of exporting which implies that spending on R&D was not simply to boost the probability of producing new goods and services, but also to improve the establishment’s knowledge assets which would in turn help it break down barriers to international markets. In non-manufacturing, spending on R&D increased the probability of innovating but had no significant impact on whether the establishment exported; rather, innovating increased the probability of exporting. Exporting had no direct impact on whether innovation occurred in either sector. Given the key role of R&D, innovation and exporting in determining productivity, {{it is important that}} government understands these complex interactions between R&D, innovation and exporting and takes advantage of them when devising and implementing productivity-enhancing policies at the micro-level...|$|R

It is shown that the static game is often a prisoners' dilemma where both firms are worse off when they both undertake FDI. To avoid the prisoners' dilemma, in an infinitely-repeated game, the firms can collude over their FDI versus export decisions. Then, a reduction in trade costs may lead firms to switch from <b>exporting</b> to <b>undertaking</b> FDI when trade costs are relatively high. Also, collusion over FDI may increase welfar...|$|R

Our results indicate that multinational firms dominate Japanese trade. In 2000, only 12. 4 percent of Japanese firms were multinationals but they accounted for 93. 6 and 81. 2 percent of Japanese exports and imports, respectively. We found that multinational firms emerged from being exporters/importers. These results imply that firms do not make the choice of either <b>exporting</b> or <b>undertaking</b> FDI, contrary {{to the findings of}} previous studies.

This note presents a Cournot duopoly model with two regions, each consisting of two countries, and with an inter-regional transport cost. It is shown that multilateral trade liberalisation may lead firms to switch from <b>exporting</b> to <b>undertaking</b> export-platform FDI when the interregional transport cost is high. Also, when the inter-regional transport cost is high, the switch to FDI leads to an increase in the volume of world trade in this industry.

In so doing, we build a three-country model, in which firms serve foreign markets either by <b>exporting</b> or <b>undertaking</b> FDI, and consider a coalition formation game with the Coalition Proof Nash Equilibrium as an equilibrium concept. We find that the equilibrium coalition structure varies upon firms characterization {{before and after the}} formation of a trading bloc. As in the literature, when all firms are exporters in the pre- and post-formation, bilateralism can be an equilibrium outcome. However, when trade barriers are not so high as to be trade-prohibitive and the environment is favorable to multinational activities in the pre- or post-formation, only global free trade will prevail as an equilibrium coalition structure. trading blocs, FTA, multinational corporations, FDI, coalition formation game,...|$|R

These features consistent with evidence of increasing returns to sophistication are unfortunately likely to contribute further to the current widening of spatial economic disparities across China.
