5|$|For 0<i<n, any mapping from S'i to S'n is {{homotopic}} (i.e., continuously <b>deformable)</b> to {{a constant}} mapping, i.e., a mapping that maps all of S'i {{to a single}} point of S'n. Therefore the homotopy group is the trivial group.|$|E
5|$|In the {{periodic}} table, americium is located {{to the right}} of plutonium, to the left of curium, and below the lanthanide europium, with which it shares many similarities in physical and chemical properties. Americium is a highly radioactive element. When freshly prepared, it has a silvery-white metallic lustre, but then slowly tarnishes in air. With a density of 12g/cm3, americium is less dense than both curium (13.52g/cm3) and plutonium (19.8g/cm3); but has a higher density than europium (5.264g/cm3)—mostly because of its higher atomic mass. Americium is relatively soft and easily <b>deformable</b> and has a significantly lower bulk modulus than the actinides before it: Th, Pa, U, Np and Pu. Its melting point of 1173°C is significantly higher than that of plutonium (639°C) and europium (826°C), but lower than for curium (1340°C).|$|E
5|$|The {{size of a}} Solar System object can be deduced {{from its}} optical magnitude, its distance, and its albedo. Objects appear bright to Earth {{observers}} either because they are large or because they are highly reflective. If their reflectivity (albedo) can be ascertained, then a rough estimate can be made of their size. For most distant objects, the albedo is unknown, but Haumea is large and bright enough for its thermal emission to be measured, which has given an approximate value for its albedo and thus its size. However, the calculation of its dimensions is complicated by its rapid rotation. The rotational physics of <b>deformable</b> bodies predicts that over {{as little as a}} hundred days, a body rotating as rapidly as Haumea will have been distorted into the equilibrium form of a triaxial ellipsoid. It is thought that most of the fluctuation in Haumea's brightness is caused not by local differences in albedo but by the alternation of the side view and end view as seen from Earth.|$|E
25|$|Once {{the local}} phase {{errors in the}} {{wavefront}} are known, they can be corrected by placing a phase modulator such as a <b>deformable</b> mirror at yet another plane in the system conjugate to the eye's pupil. The phase errors {{can be used to}} reconstruct the wavefront, which can then be used to control the <b>deformable</b> mirror. Alternatively, the local phase errors can be used directly to calculate the <b>deformable</b> mirror instructions.|$|E
25|$|Microelectromechanical systems (MEMS) <b>deformable</b> {{mirrors and}} {{magnetics}} concept <b>deformable</b> mirrors are currently {{the most widely}} used technology in wavefront shaping applications for adaptive optics given their versatility, stroke, maturity of technology and the high resolution wavefront correction that they afford.|$|E
25|$|In {{continuous}} {{systems such}} as electromagnetic fields, fluids and <b>deformable</b> bodies, a momentum density can be defined, and a continuum version of the conservation of momentum leads to equations such as the Navier–Stokes equations for fluids or the Cauchy momentum equation for <b>deformable</b> solids or fluids.|$|E

25|$|In astronomy, {{adaptive}} optics {{is a technique}} to measure variable image distortions and adapt a <b>deformable</b> mirror accordingly on a timescale of milliseconds, {{to compensate for the}} distortions.|$|E
25|$|Model-based {{approaches}} employ representation {{to extract}} vessels from images. Three broad categories of model-based are known: <b>deformable,</b> parametric, and template matching. <b>Deformable</b> methods uses objects {{that will be}} deformed to fit {{the contours of the}} objects on the image. Parametric uses geometric parameters such as tubular, cylinder, or ellipsoid representation of blood vessels. Classical snake contour in combination with blood vessel topological information can also be used as a model-based approach. Lastly, template matching is the usage of a template, fitted by stochastic deformation process using Hidden Markov Mode 1.|$|E
25|$|Historically, {{virtual work}} and the {{associated}} calculus of variations were formulated to analyze systems of rigid bodies, but they have also been developed {{for the study of}} the mechanics of <b>deformable</b> bodies.|$|E
25|$|These models don’t use {{a spatial}} {{representation}} of the body anymore, because they derive the parameters directly from the images or videos using a template database. Some {{are based on the}} <b>deformable</b> 2D templates of the human parts of the body, particularly hands. <b>Deformable</b> templates are sets of points on the outline of an object, used as interpolation nodes for the object’s outline approximation. One of the simplest interpolation function is linear, which performs an average shape from point sets, point variability parameters and external deformators. These template-based models are mostly used for hand-tracking, but could also be of use for simple gesture classification.|$|E
25|$|In {{the case}} of <b>deformable</b> bodies such as cloth simulation, {{it may not be}} {{possible}} to use a more specific pairwise pruning algorithm as discussed below, and an n-body pruning algorithm is the best that can be done.|$|E
25|$|Sickle-cell {{disease is}} a genetic disease that results in {{abnormal}} hemoglobin molecules. When these release their oxygen load in the tissues, they become insoluble, leading to mis-shaped red blood cells. These sickle shaped red cells are less <b>deformable</b> and viscoelastic meaning that they have become rigid and can cause blood vessel blockage, pain, strokes, and other tissue damage.|$|E
25|$|In {{order to}} perform {{adaptive}} optics correction, {{the shape of}} the incoming wavefronts must be measured as a function of position in the telescope aperture plane. Typically the circular telescope aperture is split up into an array of pixels in a wavefront sensor, either using an array of small lenslets (a Shack–Hartmann sensor), or using a curvature or pyramid sensor which operates on images of the telescope aperture. The mean wavefront perturbation in each pixel is calculated. This pixelated map of the wavefronts is fed into the <b>deformable</b> mirror and used to correct the wavefront errors introduced by the atmosphere. It is not necessary for the shape or size of the astronomical object to be known– even Solar System objects which are not point-like {{can be used in a}} Shack–Hartmann wavefront sensor, and time-varying structure on the surface of the Sun is commonly used for adaptive optics at solar telescopes. The <b>deformable</b> mirror corrects incoming light so that the images appear sharp.|$|E
25|$|Tip–tilt mirrors are {{effectively}} segmented mirrors having only one segment which can tip and tilt, {{rather than having}} an array of multiple segments that can tip and tilt independently. Due to the relative simplicity of such mirrors and having a large stroke, meaning they have large correcting power, most AO systems use these, first, to correct low order aberrations. Higher order aberrations may then be corrected with <b>deformable</b> mirrors.|$|E
25|$|The FX3B {{had become}} {{obsolete}} {{by this time}} due to new <b>deformable</b> structure regulations {{and was replaced by}} the new Iso–Marlboro IR. However, the FX3B was raced in two non-Championship races at this time; at the 1973 Race of Champions, Tony Trimmer raced an FX3B to fourth place while Ganley retired his car with handling problems. The New Zealander also retired at the FX3B's last race, the 1973 BRDC International Trophy, this time with low oil pressure.|$|E
25|$|IFs {{are rather}} <b>deformable</b> {{proteins}} {{that can be}} stretched several times their initial length. The key to facilitate this large deformation is due to their hierarchical structure, which facilitates a cascaded activation of deformation mechanisms {{at different levels of}} strain. Initially the coupled alpha-helices of unit-length filaments uncoil as they're strained, then as the strain increases they transition into beta-sheets, and finally at increased strain the hydrogen bonds between beta-sheets slip and the ULF monomers slide along each other.|$|E
25|$|Internal {{forces are}} {{produced}} between the particles of a <b>deformable</b> object, assumed as a continuum, {{as a reaction}} to applied external forces, i.e., either surface forces or body forces. This reaction follows from Euler's laws of motion for a continuum, which are equivalent to Newton's laws of motion for a particle. A measure of the intensity of these internal forces is called stress. Because the object is assumed as a continuum, these internal forces are distributed continuously within the volume of the object.|$|E
25|$|The W124 also {{featured}} a driver's side airbag (optional in Europe, later {{standard in the}} USA), height-adjustable seat belts with electronic-mechanical pre-tensioneers (standard) for both front passengers, rear seat belts which automatically adapted {{to the size of}} the passengers (standard), pedals that were moved inversely in a frontal impact (away from the drivers feet and in the direction of the bulkhead separating the cabin from the engine) and door arm rests with <b>deformable</b> elements designed to reduce abdominal injury risk resulting from a side impact.|$|E
25|$|In humans, {{the distal}} pads are wider {{than in other}} {{primates}} because the soft tissues of the finger tip are attached to a horseshoe-shaped edge on the underlying bone, and, in the grasping hand, the distal pads can therefore conform to uneven surfaces while pressure is distributed more evenly in the finger tips. The distal pad of the human thumb is divided into a proximal and a distal compartment, the former more <b>deformable</b> than the latter, which allows the thumb pad to mold around an object.|$|E
25|$|A {{variety of}} {{research}} and development, technology and engineering challenges also had to be overcome, such as working with the optics industry to create a precision large optics fabrication capability to supply the laser glass for NIF’s 7,500 meter-sized optics. State-of-the-art optics measurement, coating and finishing techniques were needed to withstand NIF’s high-energy lasers, as were methods for amplifying the laser beams to the needed energy levels. Continuous-pour glass, rapid-growth crystals, innovative optical switches, and <b>deformable</b> mirrors were among the technology innovations developed for NIF.|$|E
25|$|Newton's second law {{applies to}} {{point-like}} particles, {{and to all}} points in a rigid body. They also apply to each point in a mass continua, like <b>deformable</b> solids or fluids, but {{the motion of the}} system must be accounted for, see material derivative. In the case the mass is not constant, it is not sufficient to use the product rule for the time derivative on the mass and velocity, and Newton's second law requires some modification consistent with conservation of momentum, see variable-mass system.|$|E
25|$|At PAX Prime 2013, it was {{revealed}} that Double Fine had a game in development that would be released as free downloadable content for The Playroom, the augmented reality mini-game compilation that utilizes the PlayStation Camera on PlayStation 4. Titled My Alien Buddy, it built on their experience on augmented reality that they gained while making Double Fine Happy Action Theater and Kinect Party for Microsoft. The alien buddy is a <b>deformable</b> toy with which the player can interact. My Alien Buddy was released on December 24, 2013.|$|E
25|$|Adaptive optics (AO) is a {{technology}} {{used to improve}} the performance of optical systems by reducing the effect of wavefront distortions: it aims at correcting the deformations of an incoming wavefront by deforming a mirror in order {{to compensate for the}} distortion. It is used in astronomical telescopes and laser communication systems to remove the effects of atmospheric distortion, in microscopy, optical fabrication and in retinal imaging systems to reduce optical aberrations. Adaptive optics works by measuring the distortions in a wavefront and compensating for them with a device that corrects those errors such as a <b>deformable</b> mirror or a liquid crystal array.|$|E
25|$|The main {{benefits}} of the a posteriori methods are as follows. In this case, the collision detection algorithm need {{not be aware of}} the myriad of physical variables; a simple list of physical bodies is fed to the algorithm, and the program returns a list of intersecting bodies. The collision detection algorithm doesn't need to understand friction, elastic collisions, or worse, nonelastic collisions and <b>deformable</b> bodies. In addition, the a posteriori algorithms are in effect one dimension simpler than the a priori algorithms. Indeed, an a priori algorithm must deal with the time variable, which is absent from the a posteriori problem.|$|E
25|$|Human {{soft tissue}} is highly <b>deformable,</b> and its {{mechanical}} properties vary significantly {{from one person}} to another. Impact testing results showed that the stiffness and the damping resistance of a test subject’s tissue are correlated with the mass, velocity, and size of the striking object. Such properties may be useful for forensics investigation when contusions were induced. When solid object impact a human soft tissues, the energy of the impact will be absorbed by the tissues to reducing effect of the impact or the pain level, therefore; subjects with more soft tissue thickness tended to absorb the impacts with less aversion.|$|E
25|$|When the {{amplification}} {{process is}} complete the laser light enters the experimental chamber, lying {{at one end}} of the building. Here it is reflected off a series of <b>deformable</b> mirrors that help correct remaining imperfections in the wavefront, and then feeds them into the target chamber from all angles. Since the overall distances from the ends of the beamlines to different points on the target chamber are different, delays are introduced on the individual paths to ensure they all reach the center of the chamber at the same time, within about 10picoseconds (ps). The target, a fusion fuel pellet about 1mm in diameter in the case of HiPER, lies at the center of the chamber.|$|E
25|$|The energy {{spectrum}} of an electron {{moving in a}} periodical potential of rigid crystal lattice consists of allowed and forbidden bands and {{is known as the}} Bloch spectrum. An electron with energy inside an allowed band moves as a free electron but has an effective mass that differs from the electron mass in vacuum. However, a crystal lattice is <b>deformable</b> and displacements of atoms (ions) from their equilibrium positions are described in terms of phonons. Electrons interact with these displacements, and this interaction is known as electron-phonon coupling. One of possible scenarios was proposed in the seminal 1933 paper by Lev Landau, which includes the production of a lattice defect such as an F-center and a trapping of the electron by this defect. A different scenario was proposed by Solomon Pekar that envisions dressing the electron with lattice deformation (a cloud of virtual phonons). Such an electron with the accompanying deformation moves freely across the crystal, but with increased effective mass. Pekar coined for this charge carrier the term polaron.|$|E
25|$|A {{number of}} {{models have been}} {{proposed}} to describe fluid effects on the vascular remodelling in the embryo. One point which has often missed in these analogies {{is the fact that}} the process occurs within a living system; dead end can break off and reattach elsewhere, branches close and open at junctions or form valves, and vessels are extremely <b>deformable,</b> able to quickly adapt to new conditions and form new pathways. Theoretically, the formation of the vascular tree can be thought of in terms of percolation theory. The network of tubes arises randomly and will eventually establish a path between two separate and unconnected points. Once some critical number of sprouting tubes have migrated into a previously unoccupied area, a path called a fractal can be established between these two points. Fractals are biologically useful constructions, as they rely on an infinite increase in surface area, which in biological terms translates to a vast increase in transport efficiency of nutrients and wastes. The fractal path is flexible; if one connection is broken, another forms to re-establish the path. This is a useful illustration of how the vascular tree forms, although it cannot be used as a model.|$|E
25|$|The {{red blood}} cells of mammals are {{typically}} shaped as biconcave disks: flattened and depressed in the center, with a dumbbell-shaped cross section, and a torus-shaped rim {{on the edge of}} the disk. This distinctive biconcave shape optimises the flow properties of blood in the large vessels, such as maximization of laminar flow and minimization of platelet scatter, which suppresses their atherogenic activity in those large vessels. However, there are some exceptions concerning shape in the artiodactyl order (even-toed ungulates including cattle, deer, and their relatives), which displays a wide variety of bizarre red blood cell morphologies: small and highly ovaloid cells in llamas and camels (family Camelidae), tiny spherical cells in mouse deer (family Tragulidae), and cells which assume fusiform, lanceolate, crescentic, and irregularly polygonal and other angular forms in red deer and wapiti (family Cervidae). Members of this order have clearly evolved a mode of red blood cell development substantially different from the mammalian norm. Overall, mammalian {{red blood cells}} are remarkably flexible and <b>deformable</b> so as to squeeze through tiny capillaries, as well as to maximize their apposing surface by assuming a cigar shape, where they efficiently release their oxygen load.|$|E
25|$|In 2005, Xu et al. at Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute {{used the}} 3D VIP-Man phantom to {{simulate}} respiratory motions by adopting the gated respiratory motion {{data of the}} NCAT phantom. The 4D VIP-Man Chest phantom was used to study external-beam treatment planning for a lung cancer patient. In 2007, Xu's research group reported creation {{of a series of}} polygon-based phantoms representing a pregnant woman and her fetus at the end of 3, 6, and 9 month gestations (RPI Pregnant Females). The mesh data were initially obtained from separate anatomical information sources including a non-pregnant female, a 7-month pregnant woman CT data set, and a mesh model of the fetus. In 2008, two triangular mesh-based phantoms were created, named as RPI <b>Deformable</b> Adult Male and Female (RPI-AM, RPI-FM). The anatomic parameters of the phantoms were made consistent with two datasets: the mass and density of internal organs originated from ICRP-23 and ICRP-89, and the whole-body height and weight percentile data were obtained from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES 1999-2002). Later on, to study the relationship between breast size and lung dosimetry, a new group of phantoms were produced by altering the breast geometry of RPI-AF.|$|E
25|$|Elastic modulus {{is simply}} {{defined as the}} ratio of stress to strain within the {{proportional}} limit. Physically, it represents the stiffness of a material within the elastic range when tensile or compressive load are applied. It is clinically important because it indicates the selected biomaterial has similar <b>deformable</b> properties with the material {{it is going to}} replace. These force-bearing materials require high elastic modulus with low deflection. As the elastic modulus of material increases fracture resistance decreases. It is desirable that the biomaterial elastic modulus is similar to bone. This is because if it is more than bone elastic modulus then load is born by material only; while the load is bear by bone only if it is less than bone material. The Elastic modulus of a material is generally calculated by bending test because deflection can be easily measured in this case as compared to very small elongation in compressive or tensile load. However, biomaterials (for bone replacement) are usually porous and the sizes of the samples are small. Therefore, nanoindentation test is used to determine the elastic modulus of these materials. This method has high precision and convenient for micro scale samples. Another method of elastic modulus measurement is non-destructive method. It is also clinically very good method because of its simplicity and repeatability since materials are not destroyed.|$|E

500|$|During six flybys of Titan from 2006 to 2011, Cassini {{gathered}} radiometric {{tracking and}} optical navigation data from which investigators could roughly infer Titan's changing shape. The density of Titan {{is consistent with}} a body that is about 60% rock and 40% water. The team's analyses suggest that Titan's surface can rise and fall by up to 10 metres during each orbit. That degree of warping suggests that Titan's interior is relatively <b>deformable,</b> and that the most likely model of Titan is one in which an icy shell dozens of kilometres thick floats atop a global ocean. The team's findings, together with the results of previous studies, hint that Titan's ocean may lie no more than [...] below its surface. On July 2, 2014, NASA reported the ocean inside Titan may be as salty as the Dead Sea. On September 3, 2014, NASA reported studies suggesting methane rainfall on Titan may interact with a layer of icy materials underground, called an [...] "alkanofer," [...] to produce ethane and propane that may eventually feed into rivers and lakes.|$|E
