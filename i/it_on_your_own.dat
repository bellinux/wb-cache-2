500|$|While in KwaZulu-Natal, South Africa, in 2005, Cumberbatch and {{two friends}} were {{abducted}} overnight and held at gunpoint {{by a group}} of locals. Eventually their abductors drove them into unsettled territory and set them free without explanation. Cumberbatch said of the incident: [...] "It taught me that you come into this world as you leave <b>it,</b> <b>on</b> <b>your</b> <b>own.</b> It's made me want to live a life less ordinary." [...] He subscribes to Buddhist philosophy and has expressed affinity for meditation and mindfulness.|$|E
500|$|Thrive was {{recorded}} at Zoo Studio in Franklin, Tennessee, with producer Mark A. Miller. According to lead vocalist Mark Hall, {{the idea behind}} Thrive came from the student ministry he is involved in. As a youth pastor, Hall frequently uses Psalms 1, which metaphorically compares {{the concept of a}} righteous man to a prosperous tree planted by a river. Hall said that many people he has talked with are simply surviving, which he feels contrasts with this — he felt that, although hard times can come upon anyone, people are not put in these situations to simply survive through them, but rather to thrive through the adversity. Using the metaphor, Hall noted that, if one were to pull away all the dirt from around a tree, one would find roots digging into the ground in addition to the limbs of the tree reaching out. Hall elaborated that [...] "you need to get your strength from God; you don’t get <b>it</b> <b>on</b> <b>your</b> <b>own.</b> If you’re all limbs, the thorns of life will knock you over. You need to dig your roots in and let God reach out through you". Accordingly, half of the record focuses on 'reaching out', while the other half focuses on 'digging deep'. Hall described the record as being [...] "an effort to draw a picture of what a believer, a follower of Jesus, would look like if they dug into their roots and understood God and themselves more, and then instead of trying to go be Christian for God, they just let God give them chances to be a Christian".|$|E

One offering in this campaign is the video entitled [...] "Auto-Tune the Ads: Sony. Justin Timberlake. Peyton Manning." [...] When asked about a possible backlash by fans due to client integration in Auto Tune The News, Michael Gregory said [...] "The audience gets it. It used to be where any type of sponsorship you might have fans say 'they sold out' but nowadays {{if you can do}} <b>it</b> <b>on</b> <b>your</b> <b>own</b> terms, your fans are rooting for you." [...] In an interview with Wired, the band said {{they are going to be}} working with Comedy Central to produce a TV pilot for a television series to be aired sometime in 2011. The band's [...] "Songify This" [...] videos were parodied in The Simpsons' episode, [...] "The Falcon and the D'ohman" [...] and The Cleveland Show episode, [...] "Frapp Attack!". Aside from that, the band worked with app developer Khu.sh to create Songify, an Apple iPhone app that allows the users to autotune any speech into song. Provided with the app is an template that autotunes speech to the Double Rainbow music, with additional template packs from the band available for purchase in-app.|$|E
