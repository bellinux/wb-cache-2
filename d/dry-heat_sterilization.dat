50|$|The <b>Dry-Heat</b> <b>sterilization</b> {{process is}} {{accomplished}} by conduction; that is where heat is absorbed by the exterior surface of an item and then passed inward to the next layer. Eventually, the entire item reaches the proper temperature needed to achieve sterilization. The proper time and temperature for <b>Dry-Heat</b> <b>sterilization</b> is 160 °C (320 °F) for 2 hours or 170 °C (340 °F) for 1 hour. Instruments should be dry before sterilization since water will interfere with the process. Dry-heat destroys microorganisms by causing coagulation of proteins.|$|E
40|$|A {{mathematical}} model {{was developed to}} estimate the number of logarithmic cycles (LDec) of lipopolysaccharide concentration destroyed by a <b>dry-heat</b> <b>sterilization</b> process. The LDec values calculated from the {{mathematical model}} agreed well with those obtained from the destruction of lipopolysaccharide by a dry-heat treatment. A discussion of how the mathematical model {{may be used to}} evaluate a <b>dry-heat</b> <b>sterilization</b> cycle is presented. This mathematical model and the dry-heat destruction curves indicated existence of a maximum LDec value at each temperature. The implications of this finding are discussed...|$|E
40|$|Discussion {{of various}} {{techniques}} of sterilization of space flight hardware using either destructive heating or {{the action of}} chemicals. Factors considered in the dry-heat destruction of microorganisms include the effects of microbial water content, temperature, the physicochemical properties of the microorganism and adjacent support, {{and nature of the}} surrounding gas atmosphere. Dry-heat destruction rates of microorganisms on the surface, between mated surface areas, or buried in the solid material of space vehicle hardware are reviewed, along with alternative <b>dry-heat</b> <b>sterilization</b> cycles, thermodynamic considerations, and considerations of final sterilization-process design. Discussed sterilization chemicals include ethylene oxide, formaldehyde, methyl bromide, dimethyl sulfoxide, peracetic acid, and beta-propiolactone...|$|E

40|$|The Viking Mars landers to be {{launched}} in 1975 will carry experiments in biology, planetology, and atmospheric physics. A terminal <b>dry-heat</b> <b>sterilization</b> process using an inert gas was chosen to meet planetary quarantine requirements and preclude contamination of the biology experiment by terrestrial organisms. Deep sterilization is performed at the component level and terminal surface sterilization at the system level. Solutions to certain component problems relating to sterilization are discussed, involving the gyroscope, tape recorder, battery, electronic circuitry, and outgassing. Heat treatment placed special requirements on electronic packaging, including fastener preload monitoring and solder joints. Chemical and physical testing of nonmetallic materials was performed to establish data on their behavior in heat-treatment and vacuum environments. A Thermal Effects Test Model and a Proof Test Capsule were used. It is concluded that a space vehicle can be designed and fabricated to withstand heat sterilization requirements...|$|E
40|$|A {{description}} is presented {{of a unique}} system for the sterilization and sterile repair of spacecraft {{and the results of}} a test program designed to assess the biological integrity and engineering reliability of the system. This trailer-mounted system, designated the model assembly sterilizer for testing (MAST), is capable of the <b>dry-heat</b> <b>sterilization</b> of spacecraft and/or components less than 2. 3 meters in diameter at temperatures up to 433 K and the steam sterilization of components less than 0. 724 meter in diameter. Sterile access to spacecraft is provided by two tunnel suits, called the bioisolator suit systems (BISS), which are contiguous with the walls of the sterilization chambers. The test program was designed primarily to verify the biological and engineering reliability of the MAST system by processing simulated space hardware. Each test cycle simulated the initial sterilization of a spacecraft, sterile repair of a failed component, removal of the spacecraft from the MAST for mating with the bus, and a sterile recycle repair...|$|E
40|$|A {{study was}} {{undertaken}} to determine why bacteria could penetrate lengths of consolidated sandstone (Berea) faster when the sandstone was sterilized by autoclaving than when dry heat (150 °C, 3 h) was used. Changes in permeability, porosity, and pore entrance {{size of the}} rock {{as a result of}} autoclaving were not sufficient to explain the differences in penetration times observed, but electron dispersion spectroscopy and electron microscopy of the rock revealed changes in mineral composition and clay morphology. Autoclaved cores contained more chloride than dry-heated cores, and the clays of autoclaved cores were aggregated and irregularly shaped. Therefore, the decreases in bacterial penetration rates caused by autoclave sterilization were probably the result of a change in surface charge of the pores of the rock and of a reduction in surface area of clays available for adhesion. The results implied that <b>dry-heat</b> <b>sterilization</b> was preferable to autoclaving when examining biotic and abiotic interactions in a native-state rock model...|$|E
40|$|Planetary {{quarantine}} requirements {{associated with}} the launch of two Viking spacecraft necessitated microbiological assessment during assembly and testing at Cape Canaveral and the Kennedy Space Center. Samples were collected from selected surface of the Viking Lander Capsules (VLC), Orbiters, (VO), and Shrouds at predetermined intervals during assembly and testing. Approximately 7, 000 samples were assayed. Levels of bacterial spores per square meter on the VLC- 1 and VLC- 2 were 1. 6 x 10 (2) and 9. 7 x 10 (1), respectively, prior to <b>dry-heat</b> <b>sterilization.</b> The ranges of aerobic mesophilic microorganisms detected on the VO- 1 and VO- 2 at various sampling events were 4. 2 x 10 (2) to 4. 3 x 10 (3) and 2. 3 x 10 (2) to 8. 9 x 10 (3) /m 2, respectively. Approximately 1, 300 colonies were picked from culture plates, identified, lypholipized, and stored for future reference. About 75 % of all isolates were microorganisms considered indigenous to humans; the remaining isolates were associated with soil and dust in the environment. The percentage of microorganisms of human origin was consistent with results obtained with previous automated spacecraft but slightly lower than those observed for manned (Apollo) spacecraft...|$|E
40|$|<b>Dry-heat</b> <b>sterilization</b> of {{planetary}} lander capsules requires {{a knowledge of}} the thermal resistivity of microorganisms in the environment to which they will be subjected during sterilization of the space hardware. The dry-heat resistance of Bacillus subtilis var. niger spores on various lander capsule materials was determined at 125 C. Eight surface materials were evaluated, including a reference material, stainless steel. Survivor curves were computed, and decimal reduction times (D values) were obtained by a linear regression analysis. In four tests on stainless steel, the average value of D at 125 C was 17. 07 min. The D values for the other seven materials tested ranged from 18. 64 min on magnesium surfaces to 20. 83 min on conversion-coated magnesium. Of the materials evaluated, the results indicate that there is only {{a significant difference in the}} thermal resistance of B. subtilis var. niger spores on conversion-coated magnesium and conversion-coated aluminum from that on the reference material, stainless steel. The differences in D values for all the test surfaces may be the result of variations in test procedures rather than the effect of the surfaces on the thermal resistivity of the spores...|$|E
40|$|Twenty-three {{soil samples}} were {{collected}} from areas of the United States where major spacecraft assembly and launch facilities are in operation. Soil samples were treated with ethyl alcohol, ultrasonic energy, and gross filtration. The resultant suspensions consisted of viable, naturally occurring bacterial spores and were used to inoculate stainless-steel strips. The strips were suspended in a forced air oven and assays were made at 5 -min intervals {{for the number of}} viable spores. Most survivor curves were nonlinear. Subsequently, spore crops of heat-sensitive and heat-resistant soil isolates were found to have linear survivor curves at 125 C which were unaffected by {{the presence or absence of}} sterile soil particles from the parent sample. When two spore crops, one of which was heat-resistant and the other heat-sensitive, were mixed, the resultant nonlinear curves were unaffected by the presence or absence of sterile parent soil. Therefore, the survivor curves obtained originally with the soils were the result of heterogeneous spore populations rather than of protection afforded by soil particles in our test system. These results question the rationale both of assuming logarithmic death and of using decimal-reduction values obtained with subcultured standard reference spores in the derivation of <b>dry-heat</b> <b>sterilization</b> cycles for items contaminated with naturally occurring spore populations...|$|E
40|$|In this study, the in vivo {{biocompatibility}} of physically crosslinked dextran hydrogels was investigated. These hydrogels {{were obtained}} by mixing aqueous solutions of dextran grafted with L-lactic acid oligomers and dextran grafted with D-lactic acid oligomers. Gelation occurs due to stereocomplex formation of the lactic acid oligomers of opposite chirality. Since gelation takes some time, in situ gel formation is possible with this system. A number of sterilization methods was evaluated for their effect on the chemical and physical properties of the hydrogel. It was shown that of the investigated options (filtration, gamma irradiation, dry-heat and autoclaving) <b>dry-heat</b> <b>sterilization</b> was the preferred method to prepare sterile gels suitable for in vivo evaluations. Two types of stereocomplex gels were prepared and implanted subcutaneously in rats. The tissue reaction was evaluated {{over a period of}} 30 days. A mild ongoing foreign body reaction was observed characterized by infiltration of macrophages. Giant cells were only scarcely formed and the low numbers of lymphocytes showed that priming of the immune system is hardly involved. Importantly, the gels fully degraded in vivo within 15 days, which is in good agreement with the in vitro degradation behaviour of these gels. In conclusion, stereocomplexed dextran-oligolactic gels showed good biocompatibility which makes them suitable candidates for the design of controlled release devices for pharmaceutically active proteins.

40|$|Bacterial endotoxins, {{also known}} as lipopolysaccharides, are a fever-producing {{by-product}} of gram-negative bacteria commonly known as pyrogens. It is essential to remove endotoxins from parenteral preparations since they have multiple injurious biological activities. Because of their strong heat resistance (e. g., requiring <b>dry-heat</b> <b>sterilization</b> at 250 °C for 30 min) {{and the formation of}} various supramolecular aggregates, depyrogenation is more difficult than sterilization. We report here that soft hydrothermal processing, which has many advantages in safety and cost efficiency, is sufficient to assure complete depyrogenation by the inactivation of endotoxins. The endotoxin concentration in a sample was measured by using a chromogenic limulus method with an endotoxin-specific limulus reagent. The endotoxin concentration was calculated from a standard curve obtained using a serial dilution of a standard solution. We show that endotoxins were completely inactivated by soft hydrothermal processing at 130 °C for 60 min or at 140 °C for 30 min {{in the presence of a}} high steam saturation ratio or with a flow system. Moreover, it is easy to remove endotoxins from water by soft hydrothermal processing similarly at 130 °C for 60 min or at 140 °C for 30 min, without any requirement for ultrafiltration, nonselective adsorption with a hydrophobic adsorbent, or an anion exchanger. These findings indicate that soft hydrothermal processing, applied in the presence of a high steam saturation ratio or with a flow system, can inactivate endotoxins and may be useful for the depyrogenation of parenterals, including end products and medical devices that cannot be exposed to the high temperatures of dry heat treatments...|$|E
