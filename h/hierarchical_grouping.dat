40|$|Objective: The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{evaluate}} the use of antidepressants through use of mutually exclusive disease indications using a managed care database. Design and setting: A claims database from a 225 000 member managed care organisation was used for the study. A hierarchy of mutually exclusive antidepressant indications was developed: `Depression', `Other Approved Indication', `Mental Health', `Surrogate Diagnosis', `Other Uses', `Chronic Disease', and a residual `Unclassified' <b>hierarchical</b> indication <b>group.</b> Main outcome measures and results: Patients in the Depression and Other Approved Indication <b>hierarchical</b> <b>groups</b> likely received the antidepressant drugs primarily for these indications and frequently received selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs). Use of antidepressants in the Mental Health Disorders <b>hierarchical</b> <b>group</b> may have been for a related disease. The patients in the Surrogate Diagnosis, Other Uses, Chronic Diseases, and Unclassified <b>hierarchical</b> <b>groups</b> were significantly older than those patients in the Depression group and tricyclic antidepressant (TCA) use was more frequent than the SSRIs. The patients in the Unclassified diagnosis group may represent antidepressant use that is not adequately documented or not indicated. The Surrogate Diagnosis and Chronic Diseases <b>hierarchical</b> <b>groups</b> total healthcare costs were significantly higher than those observed in patients with a Depression diagnosis. Conclusions: Use of mutually exclusive <b>hierarchical</b> diagnosis <b>groups</b> proved to be a useful strategy for assessing antidepressant drug use.

40|$|Automatic road {{centerline}} extraction from high-resolution {{satellite imagery}} has gained considerable interest recently {{due to the}} increasing availability of commercial high-resolution satellite images. In this paper, a <b>hierarchical</b> <b>grouping</b> strategy is proposed to automatically extract main road centerlines from high-resolution satellite imagery. Here <b>hierarchical</b> <b>grouping</b> means that, instead of grouping all segments at once, the selective segments are grouped gradually, and multiple clues are closely integrated into the procedure. By this means, the computational cost can be reduced significantly. Through the stepwise grouping, the detected fragmented line segments eventually form the long main road lines. The proposed method has been tested and validated using several Ikonos and QuickBird images both in open areas and build-up urban environments. The results demonstrate its robustness and viability on extracting salient main road centerlines...|$|E

40|$|<b>Hierarchical</b> {{orthologous}} <b>groups</b> {{are defined}} as sets of genes that have descended from a single common ancestor within a taxonomic range of interest. Identifying such groups is useful {{in a wide range}} of contexts, including inference of gene function, study of gene evolution dynamics and comparative genomics. <b>Hierarchical</b> orthologous <b>groups</b> can be derived from reconciled gene/species trees but, this being a computationally costly procedure, many phylogenomic databases work on the basis of pairwise gene comparisons instead ("graph-based" approach). To our knowledge, there is only one published algorithm for graph-based <b>hierarchical</b> <b>group</b> inference, but both its theoretical justification and performance in practice are as of yet largely uncharacterised. We establish a formal correspondence between the orthology graph and <b>hierarchical</b> orthologous <b>groups.</b> Based on that, we devise GETHOGs ("Graph-based Efficient Technique for Hierarchical Orthologous Groups"), a novel algorithm to infer <b>hierarchical</b> <b>groups</b> directly from the orthology graph, thus without needing gene tree inference nor gene/species tree reconciliation.

40|$|The {{previously}} described methodology for <b>hierarchical</b> <b>grouping</b> of objects through iterative averaging {{has been used}} for simulation of cooperative interactions between objects of a system with the purpose of investigation of the conformational organization of the system. Interactions between objects were analyzed within the space of an isotropic field of one of the objects (drifter). Such an isotropic field of an individual object {{can be viewed as a}} prototype of computer ego. It allows visualization of a holistic space of multi-object relations (HSMOR) which has a complex structure depending on the number of objects, their mutual arrangement in space, and the type of metric used for assessment of (dis) similarities between the objects. In the course of computer simulation of cooperative interactions between the objects, only those points of the space were registered which corresponded to transitions in <b>hierarchical</b> <b>grouping.</b> Such points appeared to aggregate into complex spatial structures determining a unique internal organization of a respective HSMOR.

40|$|Organizations {{that are}} {{characterized}} by vertical authority structures, where decisions are made and implemented through a clear chain-of-command, are commonly seen as less responsive, less innovative, and less dynamic than organizations that have authority distributed more horizontally. This study takes aim at this presumption by miniaturizing authority structures {{to the level of}} the group, where group process theory can be marshaled to predict, measure, and assess outcomes for group innovation in an experimental setting. Using status theory, I propose that <b>hierarchical</b> <b>groups</b> will be more rather than less innovative than egalitarian groups. I conduct an experimental test by manipulating hierarchy in groups instructed to complete a common task, with outcomes mapped to innovative performance. Findings show that <b>hierarchical</b> <b>groups</b> are actually no more, and no less, innovative than egalitarian groups. Irrespective of authority structure, innovation appears to be most likely in groups in which a clear leader emerges who makes others in the group feel like her equal during group interaction. Other findings are presented to explain the apparent no-effect of authority structure on innovation. I will show that status processes advantage each type of group differently with respect to innovation. <b>Hierarchical</b> <b>groups</b> are advantaged by the presence of a clear leader; egalitarian groups are advantaged by the participative interaction that comes naturally to status peers. But the two conditions must occur together to maximize the likelihood for innovation, and this poses a problem for groups who seek to innovate, because status dynamics that promote one of the conditions undercut the status dynamics that promote the other. In egalitarian groups, when authority seekers try to take charge and lead, participative interaction is endangered because members resent the status move. In <b>hierarchical</b> <b>groups,</b> when higher ranking members act participatively, group leadership is contested because others feel empowered to take charge. Each group type therefore faces a dilemma of participative leadership, and because the dilemma is reversed across group types, the net effect of authority structure on innovation is no apparent effect. Implications of the findings for theory and practice are discussed...|$|R
