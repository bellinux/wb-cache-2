5000|$|In {{the broader}} context of {{learning}} about South Asian history, we can often find an <b>inconclusive</b> <b>range</b> of facts surrounding {{the portrayal of}} day-to-day life. Often, certain aspects of society or identity are left out because either they {{are thought to be}} insignificant or not part of the greater narrative. As one can see in the example of the Turkish Slaves, the court chroniclers chose to elude aspects of their history. So, as the authors that have been referenced in this article have done, one must piece together the puzzle. To do this, the authors thought outside the box and looked beyond court scribes,into memoirs, personal letters, and documents indirectly linked to the topic. Turkish slaves provide a narrative of capitalizing on opportunity, building authority, and creating a reputation so large that its true origins had to be hidden, for they may tarnish views on their accomplishments. Was their deployment into the frontiers and employment into the Delhi Sultanate a way for the 'Turkish' culture to flourish? Was it a way to ensure the authority of Islam could flourish, through the installation of military men into the capital? ...|$|E
40|$|PURPOSE: A higher {{radiation}} dose {{is believed to}} result in a larger probability of tumor control and a higher risk of side effects. To make an evidence-based choice of dose, the relation between dose and outcome needs to be known. This study focuses on the dose-response relation for prostate cancer. METHODS AND MATERIALS: A systematic review was carried out on the literature from 1990 to 2003. From the selected studies, the {{radiation dose}}, the associated 5 -year survival, 5 -year bNED (biochemical no evidence of disease), acute and late gastrointestinal (GI) and genitourinary (GU) morbidity Grade 2 or more, and sexual dysfunction were extracted. With logistic regression models, the relation between dose and outcome was described. RESULTS: Thirty-eight studies met our criteria, describing 87 subgroups and involving up to 3000 patients per outcome measure. Between the (equivalent) dose of 70 and 80 Gy, various models estimated an increase in 5 -year survival (ranging from 10 % to 11 %), 5 -year bNED for low-risk patients (5 - 7 %), late GI complications (12 - 16 %), late GU complications (8 - 10 %), and erectile dysfunction (19 - 24 %). Only for the overall 5 -year bNED, results were <b>inconclusive</b> (<b>range,</b> 0 - 18 %). CONCLUSIONS: The data suggest a relationship between dose and outcome measures, including survival. However, the strength of these conclusions is limited by the sometimes small number of studies, the incompleteness of the data, and above all, the correlational nature of the data. Unambiguous proof for the dose-response relationships can, therefore, only be obtained by conducting randomized trials...|$|E

40|$|Background: Organophosphorus {{poisoning}} (OPP) {{is a major}} global {{public health}} problem. Pralidoxime {{has been used in}} a complimentary role to atropine for the management of OPP. World Health Organization (WHO) recommends use of pralidoxime but studies regarding its role have been <b>inconclusive,</b> <b>ranging</b> from being ineffective to harmful or beneficial. Materials and Methods: The present study was undertaken {{to evaluate the effectiveness of}} pralidoxime. Eddleston′s study was the most compelling factor for our study, as he showed worst outcomes using pralidoxime. Our practice of continuous use of pralidoxime was based on the WHO guidelines and the study by Pawar (2006), which showed better outcome with higher doses of pralidoxime. These conflicting results suggested that a re-evaluation of its use in our clinical practice was indicated. Results: There was no difference in mortality rates, hemodynamic parameters and atropine requirements between the AP and A groups. Mean duration of ventilation (3. 6 ± 4. 6 in AP group vs. 3. 6 ± 4. 4 in A group) and Intensive Care Unit stay (7. 1 ± 5. 4 in AP group vs. 6. 8 ± 4. 7 in A group) was comparable. Serum sodium concentrations showed a correlation with mortality, with lower concentrations associated with better outcomes. Conclusion: The study suggests that add-on WHO-recommended pralidoxime therapy does not provide any benefit over atropine monotherapy. Adding pralidoxime does not seem to be beneficial and at the same time does not result in increased mortality rates. Our practice changed after completion of this study, and it has proven to be of significant benefit to patients who had to bear the expense of treatment...|$|R

40|$|Objective: Low {{socioeconomic}} status (SES) {{is a risk}} factor for type 2 diabetes and changes in diet and physical activity can prevent diabetes. We assessed the effectiveness and acceptability of community-based dietary and physical activity interventions among low-SES groups in the UK. Method: We searched relevant databases and web resources from 1990 to November 2009 to identify relevant published and grey literature using an iterative approach, focusing on UK studies. Results: Thirty-five relevant papers (nine quantitative, 23 qualitative and three mixed methods studies) were data extracted, quality assessed and synthesised using narrative synthesis and thematic analysis. The relationship between interventions and barriers and facilitators was also examined. Dietary/nutritional, food retail, physical activity and multi-component interventions demonstrated mixed effectiveness. Qualitative studies indicated a range of barriers and facilitators, which spanned pragmatic, social and psychological issues. The more effective interventions used a range of techniques to address some surface-level psychological and pragmatic concerns, however many deeper-level social, psychological and pragmatic concerns were not addressed. Conclusion: Evidence on the effectiveness of community-based dietary and physical activity interventions is <b>inconclusive.</b> A <b>range</b> of barriers and facilitators exist, some of which were addressed by interventions but some of which require consideration in future research...|$|R

40|$|The role of {{religion}} in human cooperation remains a highly contested topic. Recent studies using economic game experiments to explore this issue have been largely <b>inconclusive,</b> yielding a <b>range</b> of conflicting results. In this study, we investigate the ability {{of religion}} to promote cooperation by using explicit theological primes. In the first study, conducted in a church, we find that subjects who report a stronger connection with a Christian passage about charitable giving are subsequently more likely to cooperate in a one-shot prisoner’s dilemma game. In the second study, conducted over the Internet, we find that Christian subjects are more likely to cooperate after reading a Christian passage than a neutral one. However, in the same study, we find that Hindu and secular passages have no significant effect on Christians, and that none of the passages (Christian, Hindu, or secular) have an effect on non-Christians.

The problems of cometary origin remain <b>inconclusive,</b> with theories <b>ranging</b> from a purely interstellar origin to their being ejecta from the Galilean satellites of Jupiter. Comets can be grouped into one of two classes, depending on their periodicity, and statistical mechanics of the entire Jovian family of comets can be examined under the equilibrium hypothesis. Comet anatomy estimations have been determined, and there is speculation that comet chemistry may have been a factor in the origin of life on earth.

40|$|Female Eledone cirrhosa held in {{aquarium}} {{conditions for}} {{periods of time}} of five daysand over show relatively enlarged ovary sizes. Values for ovary index considerably exceed thoseof freshly caught animals and the incidence of {{the final stage of}} maturity, in which eggs pack the oviducts, is greater. A comparison of maturity indices for fresh and aquarium males was <b>inconclusive.</b> The <b>range</b> of factors associated with aquarium conditions is briefly reviewed and it is concluded that studies of cephalopod reproductive maturation must distinguish fresh and aquarium animals. Introduction External factors effective in inducing sexual maturation in cephalopods have been suggested several times. The influence of the absence of light has been implicated since the experiments of Wells & Wells (1959) showed that blinded Octopus vulgar is matured precociously. An effect of short day length in stimulating the optic glands of Sepia has been found by Defretin & Richard (1967) and Richard (1967) but this is not clearly the case for Octopus (Buckley, 1977). Octopuses kept in aquarium conditions for lengthy periods are said to have larger relative gonad sizes than those fresh from the sea (Wells & Wells, 1975). One of the factors associated with aquarium conditions is often a degree of starvation, and this circumstance alone is held to be a factor in inducing precocious sexual maturation in Eledone (Mangold & Boucher-Rodoni, 1973). In the course of recent studies on the growth and reproduction of Eledone cirrhosa from the North Sea (Boyle & Knobloch, 1982, 1983, 1984) animals which had remained in aquarium conditions for 5 days or over were separated from the analysis...|$|R

By the end of 1948, nearly two years after the discovery of the scrolls, no scholar had yet located the cave where the fragments had been found. With the unrest in the country, no large scale search could be undertaken. Sellers attempted to get the Syrians to help locate the cave, but they demanded more money than Sellers could offer. The cave was finally discovered on January 28, 1949 by a UN observer, and Sellers brought his box brownie camera to take the first photos of the cave, which were soon published in Life Magazine. In an attempt to date the scrolls, Sellers took some linen found in the cave, presumably from an outer wrapping of the scrolls, and brought it back to the University of Chicago. Unfortunately, the carbon-14 test, done at Chicago in 1950, was <b>inconclusive,</b> with a <b>range</b> from 245 BCE to 245 CE.

40|$|Abstract: Despite the {{prevalence}} of prostate cancer, the etiology and factors associated with its development and progres-sion are largely unknown. An important relationship in prostate cancer {{is the role of}} zinc. Clinical evidence and experi-mental evidence have established that prostate cancer is associated with a decrease in the zinc uptake and accumulation in the malignant cells; and that the accumulation of zinc in the prostate cells prevents malignancy. In contrast to this estab-lished consistent clinical relationship, numerous epidemiology studies and reports of the effect of dietary and supplemen-tal zinc on the incidence of prostate cancer have provided divergent, inconsistent, and <b>inconclusive</b> results; which <b>range</b> from adverse effects of zinc, protective effects of zinc, and no effect of zinc on the risk of prostate cancer. Despite these divergent and inconclusive results, a prevailing view and public warning has evolved from unsubstantiated and uncor-roborated epidemiology studies that zinc consumption increases the risk of developing advanced stage prostate cancer. Such a conclusion is not well-founded and has serious, confusing and erroneous implications for the medical/scientific community and for the public-at-large. The admonition of Dimitrios Trichopoulos over a decade ago [1] that, “ … (epide-miology) studies will inevitably generate false positive and false negative results with disturbing frequency. …, when (people) do take us seriously, we may unintentionally {{do more harm than good}} ” can be applied to the situation that is the subject of this report. Therefore it is extremely important to review the epidemiology studies that have lead to the conclusion of an adverse ef...|$|R
40|$|Purpose: The {{clarification}} of the constructs {{of the supply}} chain integration (clients, suppliers, external and internal), {{the creation of a}} measurement instrument based on a list of items taken from earlier papers, the validation of these scales and a preliminary benchmark to interpret the scales by percentiles based on a set of control variables (size of the plant, country, sector and degree of vertical integration). Design/methodology/approach: Our empirical analysis is based on the HPM project database (2005 - 2007 timeframe). The international sample is made up of 266 plants across ten countries: Austria, Canada, Finland, Germany, Italy, Japan, Korea, Spain, Sweden and the USA. In each country. We analized the descriptive statistics, internal consistency testing to purify the items (inter-item correlations, Cronbach’s alpha, squared multiple correlation, corrected item-total correlation), exploratory factor analysis, and finally, a confirmatory factor analysis to check the convergent and discriminant validity of the scales. The analyses will be done with the SPSS and EQS programme using the maximum likelihood parameter estimation method. Findings: The four proposed scales show excellent psychometric properties. Research limitations/implications: with a clearer and more concise designation of the supply chain integration measurement scales more reliable and accurate data could be taken to analyse the relations between these constructs with other variables of interest to the academic l fields. Practical implications: providing scales that are valid as a diagnostic tool for best practices, as well as providing a benchmark with which to compare the score for each individual plant against a collection of industrial companies from the machinery, electronics and transportation sectors. Originality/value: supply chain integration may be a major factor in explaining the performance of companies. The results are nevertheless <b>inconclusive,</b> the vast <b>range</b> of results obtained are due, amongst other things, {{to the fact that there}} is no exactness to the group of scales used, no-one has yet published an analysis of the measurement models nor clear benchmarks as to the variety of the scales used. </p...|$|R
40|$|Background: The {{relationship}} between monochromatic aberrations {{of the human}} eye and myopia has been investigated extensively {{over the past decade}} or so but the results are <b>inconclusive.</b> Wide age <b>range,</b> narrow refractive error range and large individual variations are common confounding factors in previous studies. To address these shortcomings, we conducted a two-part study. The first part set out to determine whether the monochromatic aberrations in myopic eyes are different from those in the non-myopic eyes in adults. Subjects were drawn from a narrow age band to minimise the confounding effect of age. The second part of this study compared the monochromatic aberrations of the more myopic and less myopic eyes of anisometropes. Methods: Monochromatic aberrations were measured for 5 mm pupils using the Complete Ophthalmic Analysis System (COAS) Wavefront Analyzer in 116 subjects with refractive spherical equivalent between - 10. 38 D and + 1. 38 D and in 26 anisometropes. Measurements were done in a dark room with natural pupils. The refractive errors, corneal curvatures and axial lengths of the eyes were measured under natural accommodation. Results: Highly myopic eyes had significantly smaller root mean square (RMS) values of fourth order (p = 0. 015) and spherical aberrations (p = 0. 009) than non-myopic eyes. The correlation coefficient was 0. 2354 (p = 0. 011) between fourth-order aberrations and refractive spherical equivalents and 0. 2817 (p = 0. 002) between spherical aberration and refractive spherical equivalents. Less myopic eyes of the anisometropes showed significantly larger total higher-order, third-order and spherical aberrations than the more myopic eyes (p < 0. 05, p < 0. 05 and p < 0. 01, respectively). Conclusions: Our study shows that spherical aberration is associated with refractive error. More myopic eyes tended to have smaller amounts of spherical aberration, however, the 'cause or effect' question remains. Longitudinal studies are needed to further investigate the {{relationship between}} monochromatic aberrations and refractive development. School of Optometr...|$|R
