5|$|On the left, on {{the other}} <b>hand,</b> <b>Count</b> William Louis of Nassau {{advanced}} with the remaining Dutch cavalry but was halted by the musketry fire of the 200 men standing on the advanced ditch. Aiming to disrupt the Dutch right, Verdugo then charged ahead of Frate's Albanian company and that of Baron de Bievres. The Dutch horse, disorganized by the musketry fire, could not resist Verdugo's rush and turned back, breaking the order, in turn, of the English foot standing behind. To capitalize on this success, Verdugo ordered his foot to follow up the victory. Unaware of the Spanish success {{on the other}} side of the field, the English infantry continued pressing back the Spanish right flank until they reached the Spanish camp. When they realized what had happened, however, the Englishmen turned back in a vain attempt to escape. The Spanish centre and left were blocking the way, and thus the English attempted to save themselves fleeing across the bogged ditches, only to be killed in large numbers.|$|E
25|$|On {{election}} day, the write-in {{ballots were}} counted, but not examined: determining for which candidate they were cast was deferred. After election officials tabulated 27,000 additional absentee and early ballots, Miller had won 35 {{percent of the}} vote while forty percent of the ballots cast were write-ins, which required a <b>hand</b> <b>count</b> to see what names were on them.|$|E
25|$|He {{dismissed}} Miller's {{claims of}} possible vote fraud as based on speculation, “Miller’s affidavits {{do not provide}} any facts of wrongful conduct at polling stations and not even circumstantial evidence of wrongdoing,” he said. The Miller campaign responded to the ruling by stating that votes that {{did not meet the}} standard established by the state legislature were not valid, and that that equal protection and fundamental fairness required a <b>hand</b> <b>count</b> of all the votes and an investigation of fraud allegations. The judge allowed a brief stay so that Miller could appeal to the Alaska Supreme Court.|$|E

25|$|Miller's Alaska {{state court}} lawsuit {{essentially}} repeated his federal suit allegations, but added new charges of voter fraud, claiming that precinct election officials had allowed voting without proper identification, and claiming that identical handwriting was suspiciously found on multiple ballots, {{which was also}} {{a violation of the}} requirement that a voter must personally pen a write-in ballot. Miller offered a new argument at a December 8 hearing; that hundreds of convicted sex offenders and possibly other felons were allowed to vote in the November election. On December 10, the Alaska Superior Court ruled against all of Miller's claims, finding the <b>hand</b> <b>count</b> of the write-in ballots valid.|$|E
25|$|After {{several days}} of counting, the Division of Elections showed Murkowski with a lead of some 1,700 votes over Miller, with about 8,000 {{write-in}} votes yet to be counted, and a trend of counting 97 percent of the write-ins as for Murkowski. Murkowski's campaign shied away from declaring a victory before the count was finished. As of November 17, (the {{last day of the}} <b>hand</b> <b>count),</b> the Division of Elections showed Murkowski having a lead of over 10,000 votes, meaning that even if all the 8,000 challenged ballots were discounted, Murkowski would still lead by about 2,200 votes. The Miller campaign then demanded a hand recount of the entire election, claiming that as Murkowski's votes were all verified by visual inspection Miller should get the same opportunity. The Division of Election officials responded that any recount of non-write-in votes would not be done by hand, but would be done using optical scanners.|$|E
25|$|The {{election}} {{was held on}} November 2, 2004, with the initial count showing Gregoire trailing Rossi by 261 votes. However, a legally mandated machine recount reduced that lead to only 42 votes, then a <b>hand</b> <b>count</b> that was requested and funded by the state's Democratic Party gave Gregoire a 10-vote lead. Following a State Supreme Court ruling that allowed several hundred ballots from King County to be included, her lead was further increased to 130 votes, but when the vote was certified by the state's Secretary of State, Sam Reed, {{at the end of}} December, one vote which had been counted in Thurston County past the deadline was disqualified and her lead was reduced to 129 votes. Washington's Republican leadership then filed suit, claiming that hundreds of votes, including votes by felons, deceased voters, and double voters, were included in the canvass, but on June 6, 2005, Judge John E. Bridges ruled that the Republican party did not provide enough evidence that the disputed votes were ineligible—or for whom they were cast—to overturn the election.|$|E

40|$|Experimentally, initial {{steps of}} {{leucocyte}} extravasation, including tethering and rolling, are analysed in endothelial cell flow chambers. Given {{the complexity and}} speed of endothelial-immune cell interaction, computer-aided advances of this analysis are highly desirable. Herein, we compared two established methods, <b>hand</b> <b>counting</b> and tracking software, with novel analysis software using defined movies recorded at standard conditions of endothelial-leucocyte interactions. As a first validation, cell counts and velocity parameters determined by seven experienced experts revealed no statistic differences to both semi-automated tracking and fully computerized analyses. Nevertheless, interindividual variations were substantial for <b>hand</b> <b>counting.</b> In additional experiments, velocity distributions between 1 and 800 microm/s {{picked up by the}} fully computerized analysis matched well with the tracking software as indicated by speed vector histograms. With respect to the time consumed for a defined set of movies, <b>hand</b> <b>counting</b> took 3. 6 +/- 1. 6 h, tracking software 4. 5 +/- 1. 2 h, whereas fully automated analysis consumed less than 15 min, reaching real-time mode. Thus, a validated and fully computerized method yielded functional flow chamber data unbiased, independent from an examiner, and reaching high-throughput level, which in turn will allow a substantial progress in understanding this process central for skin inflammation...|$|R

2500|$|Following the election, all 58 of California's {{counties}} had 28 days (until November 4, 2003) each {{to conduct}} a countywide canvass of their votes.

2500|$|The {{court said}} that the State statute does not require perfect spelling, and {{said that if the}} State {{legislature}} intended exact spelling it, would have said so. The emphasis, the court said, should be on making sure voters are not disenfranchised [...] The judge also wrote, [...] "To allow for write-in votes with less than a perfect spelling of a candidate’s name, as long as voter intent is clear ... a commonsense interpretation, which the court believes would be evident to most Alaskans”. The judge also rejected Miller's demands for a <b>hand</b> <b>count</b> of all the ballots cast in the election, not just those with write-in votes, because state law did not provide for it.|$|E
2500|$|On November 3, {{the winner}} {{remained}} undetermined; write-in ballots comprised 41% of the vote, Miller had 34%, and McAdams had 24%. McAdams later conceded, {{but the result}} required a hand-count of the write-in ballots to see what names were written on them. Miller's campaign manager announced that several teams, including attorneys, would be going to Alaska to watch the ballot count. Miller gained about 2,100 votes in the count of absentee ballots that was done on November 9 in Juneau, and trailed the write-in votes by 11,333 {{at the end of}} the day. The <b>hand</b> <b>count</b> of the write-in ballots began on November 10. After two days, the Alaska Division of Elections had examined about 48 percent of the ballots and had tallied about 98 percent of them as votes for Murkowski, despite objections from Miller's team of observers to spelling errors, legibility, and additional words such as [...] "Republican". When the last of the more than 100,000 write-in votes were counted on November 17, the Associated Press and the Republican Party of Alaska called the race for Murkowski. At that point, Murkowski's lead was more than 2,000 votes larger than the number of ballots challenged by Miller. On November 18, Murkowski declared victory, but Miller did not concede the race.|$|E
