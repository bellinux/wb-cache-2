5|$|The mission {{objectives}} involved {{evaluating the}} performance of the spacecraft over six orbits, as well as the effect of prolonged microgravity on the pilot. The specific spacecraft systems would also be evaluated and tested, and the worldwide tracking and communications network would be tested to see how well it would stand up in an extended mission. The flight control experiments included manually turning the spacecraft around, yaw and pitch manoeuvres to determine <b>how</b> <b>easy</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>to</b> control the spacecraft attitude, realignment of the onboard gyroscopes in flight, and leaving the spacecraft to drift on-orbit.|$|E
5|$|Hinckley was {{convinced}} {{that he would be}} Foster's equal if he became a national figure. He decided to emulate Bickle and began stalking President Jimmy Carter. He was surprised at <b>how</b> <b>easy</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>to</b> get close to the president—he was only a foot away at one event—but was arrested in October 1980 at Nashville International Airport for illegal possession of firearms. Carter had made a campaign stop there, but the FBI did not connect this arrest to the President and did not notify the United States Secret Service. His parents briefly placed him under the care of a psychiatrist. Hinckley subsequently turned his attention to Ronald Reagan whose election, he told his parents, {{would be good for the}} country. He wrote three or four more notes to Foster in early March 1981. Foster gave these notes to her dean, who gave them to the Yale police department, who sought but failed to track Hinckley down.|$|E

Former Dodgers great Duke Snider acknowledged occasional run-ins with Alston, but he said that Alston excelled at utilizing the specific strengths of each team that he managed. Tommy Lasorda, who played and coached under Alston and ultimately succeeded him as manager, commented on <b>how</b> <b>easy</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>to</b> play for Alston. Broadcaster Vin Scully said, [...] "I always imagined him to be the type who could ride shotgun on a stage through Indian territory. He was all man and two yards tall. He was very quiet, very controlled. He never made excuses. He gave the players the credit and he took the blame. He was so solid, so American." ...|$|E

2500|$|Wall {{was born}} to a German Mennonite family in Ukraine, and he spent his {{childhood}} in Yugoslavia, Hungary, and Austria. In 1948, he moved to Canada {{with his mother and}} five siblings. The family settled in Abbotsford, British Columbia. Wall enrolled at the University of British Columbia in 1958, where he studied chemistry but did not graduate. Given C$6,000 by his mother to build a house, he sold the finished product for $13,000 before she had moved in. He later claimed he [...] "discovered right then <b>how</b> <b>easy</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>to</b> make money in the real-estate business". Despite his early exit from academia, he donated $15million to UBC in 1991, at the time the largest private donation it had received. The university used the gift to found the Peter Wall Institute for Advanced Studies. In 1995, UBC awarded Wall an honorary doctorate. His degree citation credited him with [...] "a creative and innovative mind which allows him to bring unconventional solutions to otherwise insoluble problems".|$|E
2500|$|Crediting Andrea Martin {{with her}} broad and {{confident}} initial portrayal of Ishka, Adams commented on <b>how</b> <b>easy</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>to</b> play a character so well delineated. [...] Adams also infused Ishka {{with some of}} the stories Shimerman told of his own mother. [...] In an interview with , Adams said of Ishka: [...] "I love and adore her. [...] How can you not? [...] She just doesn't care what anybody thinks; she's so committed to what she thinks is right, and everyone else be damned. [...] But she has a heart of gold, and she's very strong. [...] To be a female as strong as she was, in the kind of world she came from, was wonderful, I think." [...] Lauding the character, Adams says that it's Ishka's backbone that helps her grow as an actress and as a person. [...] Adams has appeared at several Star Trek conventions with her [...] "Ferengi family" [...] and relishes meeting fans who express how much they love the character of Ishka.|$|E

2500|$|Raskin left Apple in 1982 {{and formed}} Information Appliance, Inc. to {{implement}} the concepts of his original Macintosh concept. The first product was the SwyftCard, a firmware card for the Apple II containing an integrated application suite, also released on a disk as SwyftWare. Information Appliance later developed the Swyft as a stand-alone laptop computer. Raskin licensed this design to Canon, which shipped a similar desktop product as the Canon Cat. Released in 1987, the unit had an innovative interface that attracted much interest {{but it did not}} become a commercial success. Raskin claimed that its failure was due in some part to Steve Jobs, who successfully pitched Canon on the NeXT Computer at about the same time. It has also been suggested that Canon canceled the CAT due to internal rivalries within its divisions. After running a cryptic full page advertisement in the [...] "Wall Street Journal" [...] that the [...] "Canon CAT is coming" [...] months before it was available, Canon failed to follow through, never airing the completed TV commercial when the CAT went on sale, only allowed the CAT to be sold by its typewriter sales people, and prevented Raskin from selling the CAT directly with a TV demonstration of <b>how</b> <b>easy</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>to</b> use. Shortly thereafter, the stock market crash of 1987 so panicked Information Appliance's venture capitalists that they drained millions of dollars from the company, depriving it of the capital needed to be able to manufacture and sell the Swyft.|$|E
2500|$|Croydon {{previously}} had many tramlines. The first to close was Addiscombe [...] East Croydon Station route through George Street to Cherry Orchard Road in 1927 {{and the last}} Purley - Embankment and Croydon (Coombe Road) - Thornton Heath routes closed April, 1951. However, in the Spring of 1950, the Highways Committee were presented by the Mayor {{with the concept of}} running trams between East Croydon station and the new estate being constructed at New Addington. This was {{based on the fact that}} the Feltham cars used in Croydon were going to Leeds to serve their new estates on reserved tracks. In 1962, a private study with assistance from BR engineers, showed <b>how</b> <b>easy</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>to</b> convert the West Croydon - Wimbledon train service to tram operation and successfully prevent conflict between trams and trains. These two concepts became joined in joint LRTL/TLRS concept of New Addington to Wimbledon every 15 mins via East and West Croydon and Mitcham plus New Addington to Tattenham Corner every 15 mins via East and West Croydon, Sutton and Epsom Downs. A branch into Forestdale to give an overlap service from Sutton was also included. During the 1970s, several BR directors and up-and-coming managers were aware of the advantages. In fact, Peter Parker was very well aware of this even before becoming Chairman. Chris Green, upon becoming Managing Director, Network South East, published his plans in 1987 expanding the concept to take in the Tattenham Corner and Caterham branches and provide a service from Croydon to Lewisham via Addiscombe and Hayes. Working with Tony Ridley, then Managing Director, London Transport, the scheme was brought out into the open with Scott Mackintosh being appointed Light Rail Manager in 1989.|$|E
2500|$|After his {{military}} service, Shepherd began his broadcast radio career in early 1945 on WJOB (AM) in Hammond, Indiana, later working at WTOD in Toledo, Ohio, in 1946. He began working in Cincinnati, Ohio, in January 1947 at WSAI, later also working at Cincinnati stations WCKY and WKRC the following year, {{before returning to}} WSAI. From 1951 to 1953, he had a late-night broadcast on KYW in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, after which he returned to Cincinnati for several shows on WLW. After a stint on television (see below), he returned to radio. [...] "Shep," [...] as he was known, settled in at WOR radio New York City, New York, {{at the end of}} February 1955, and on an overnight slot in 1956, where he delighted his fans by telling stories, reading poetry (especially the works of Robert W. Service), and organizing comedic listener stunts. The most famous of the last involved creating a hoax about a non-existent book, I, Libertine, by the equally non-existent author [...] "Frederick R. Ewing", in 1956. During a discussion on <b>how</b> <b>easy</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>to</b> manipulate the best seller lists, which at that time were based not only on sales but demand, Shepherd suggested that his listeners visit bookstores and ask for a copy of I, Libertine which led to booksellers attempting to purchase the book from their distributors. Fans of the show eventually took it further, planting references to the book and author so widely that demand for the book led to it being claimed by some to have been listed on The New York Times Best Seller list. Shepherd, Theodore Sturgeon and Betty Ballantine later wrote the actual book, with a cover painted by illustrator Frank Kelly Freas, published by Ballantine Books. Among his close friends in the late 1950s were Shel Silverstein and Herb Gardner. With them and actress Lois Nettleton, Shepherd performed in the revue he created, Look, Charlie. Later he was married to Nettleton for about six years.|$|E
