5|$|Huskisson's coffin {{was placed}} on a trestle table in the Town Hall, draped with black velvet and covered with {{feathered}} plumes.

At 10.00 two mutes guided the mourners out of the town hall and mounted horses; the rain and hail had by now eased. The mutes led the procession, <b>followed</b> <b>by</b> the mourners from the town hall and around 1,100 other mourners who had waited outside. These mourners marched six abreast, and were <b>followed</b> <b>by</b> the funeral committee, 28 local clergymen and two more mutes. Behind this group marched Joseph Brandreth and the Rev Blackburne, and behind them came carriages carrying the pall-bearers, a group of local dignitaries who had known and worked with Huskisson, <b>followed</b> <b>by</b> two more mutes. Behind this pair of mutes was a hearse carrying the coffin, <b>followed</b> <b>by</b> Huskisson's colleagues and his surviving brothers Thomas and Samuel. These in turn were <b>followed</b> <b>by</b> around 900 locals in mourning dress who had decided to join the procession, bringing the cortège to around half a mile (0.8km) in length. The Duke of Wellington, pleading a prior commitment to attend a dinner in Birmingham, did not attend.|$|E
