30|$|Proportion of {{adolescents}} classified as CH or CHMH significantly decreased with increasing age, whereas proportions with MH alone increased with age. Female gender {{was a significant}} <b>factor</b> <b>associated</b> with more frequent caseness in all three outcome groups. Living situation (i.e. living with both parents as opposed to not) was a significant <b>factor</b> <b>associated</b> with less frequent caseness in all three outcome groups. Socioeconomic status was a significant <b>factor</b> <b>associated</b> with more frequent MH, CH and CHMH with decreasing family income. Experienced school stress was a significant <b>factor</b> <b>associated</b> with more frequent MH, CH and CHMH. Having a non-Western nation of origin was only significantly associated with higher MH. These demographic parameters were used as possible confounders and were adjusted for in main outcome analyses.|$|R

5|$|Physical damage {{can also}} reduce the value of carrot crops. The two main forms of damage are splitting, whereby a {{longitudinal}} crack develops during growth {{that can be a}} few centimetres to {{the entire length of the}} root, and breaking, which occurs postharvest. These disorders can affect over 30% of commercial crops. <b>Factors</b> <b>associated</b> with high levels of splitting include wide plant spacing, early sowing, lengthy growth durations, and genotype.|$|E
5|$|A {{number of}} other factors are less closely linked to COPD. The risk is greater in those who are poor, {{although}} it is not clear if this is due to poverty itself or other risk <b>factors</b> <b>associated</b> with poverty, such as air pollution and malnutrition. There is tentative evidence that those with asthma and airway hyperreactivity are at increased risk of COPD. Birth factors such as low birth weight may also play a role as do a number of infectious diseases including HIV/AIDS and tuberculosis. Respiratory infections such as pneumonia do not appear to increase the risk of COPD, at least in adults.|$|E
5|$|Banksia violacea {{is one of}} a {{small number}} of Banksia species that has both lignotuberous and non-lignotuberous populations. In both cases, plants are adapted to release their aerial seed bank {{following}} a bushfire, ensuring seedlings are established on clear and relatively fertile ground; however the possession of a lignotuber makes plants much less reliant on fire regime for population maintenance and regeneration, as maternal plants are not killed by bushfire, but resprout from below ground level. Lignotuberous plants generally occur among the north-eastern populations, in the vicinity of Woodanilling. An investigation into the biogeography of these plants failed to find any vegetative, climatic or other environmental <b>factors</b> <b>associated</b> with the possession of a lignotuber.|$|E

Regarding economic problems, family caregivers often give up time from work to spend 47 hours per week on average with the person with AD, while the costs of caring for them are high.
