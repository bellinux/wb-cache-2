40|$|The {{purpose of}} this {{dissertation}} is to investigate the trend in adoption of two types of external intermediaries in clothing industry: <b>buying</b> <b>office</b> and <b>buying</b> agent. Limited {{research has been conducted}} on the classification of different types of clothing supply network, but this dissertation seeks to differentiate the value added in global sourcing activities of <b>buying</b> <b>office</b> and <b>buying</b> agent. A comprehensive case study is conducted to investigate one <b>buying</b> <b>office</b> and one <b>buying</b> agent that based in Hong Kong, using a new nine-factors global sourcing framework to compare extensively the performance and specialties of each type of intermediary. This dissertation successfully differentiates the functions and characteristics of <b>buying</b> <b>office</b> and <b>buying</b> agent, recognising a trend of adopting intermediaries based on a brand’s development, service expectation from intermediaries and external influences. This observed trend is applicable for all clothing retailers, intermediaries and prime manufacturers...|$|R

40|$|We {{consider}} a problem faced by a <b>buying</b> <b>office</b> {{for one of}} the largest retail distributors in the world. The <b>buying</b> <b>office</b> plans the distribution of goods from Asia to various destinations across Europe. The goods are transported along shipping lanes by shipping companies, many of which have collaborated to form strategic alliances; each lane must be serviced by a minimum number of companies belonging to a minimum number of alliances. The task involves purchasing freight capacity from shipping companies for each lane based on projected demand, and subject to minimum quantity requirements for each selected shipping company, such that the total transportation cost is minimized. In addition, the allocation must not assign an overly high proportion of freight to the more expensive shipping companies servicing any particular lane, which we call the lane cost balancing constraint. This study is the first to consider the lane cost balancing constraint in the context of freight allocation. We formulate the freight allocation problem with this lane cost balancing constraint as a mixed integer programming model, and show that even finding a feasible solution to this problem is computationally intractable. Hence, in order to produce high-quality solutions in practice, we devised a meta-heuristic approach based on tabu search. Experiments show that our approach significantly outperforms the branch-and-cut approach of CPLEX 11. 0 when the problem increases to practical size and the lane cost balancing constraint is tight. Our approach was developed into an application that is currently employed by decision-makers at the <b>buying</b> <b>office</b> in question. Department of Logistics and Maritime Studie...|$|R

40|$|One {{answer to}} the {{question}} of why government organizations don't perform better-common in academic “public choice” literature but also in folk wisdom-is that resources come too easily, independent of performance. Some businessmanagement literature suggests that a crisis in resource flows can force successful change-”necessity is the mother of invention. ” However, the literature also presents an alternative view: that crisis promotes rigid preprogrammed responses, not new ways of behaving. This paper examines the impact of crisis on organizational change in government by examining an organizational change effort in the U. S. federal government (procurement reform during the 1990 s) that occurred simultaneously with an organizational crisis involving workforce downsizing and introduction of competition for some <b>buying</b> <b>offices.</b> Using a dataset consisting of a survey of approximately 1, 600 frontline government contracting officials, the impact of variation in crisis at different <b>buying</b> <b>offices</b> on variation in behavior change is examined. Necessity was found to be the mother of invention, not rigidity. However, these effects were counteracted by two negative effects of crisis on organizational change: 1) employee resentment over violation of a “social contract at work” reduced behavior change, 2) employee association of the change effort with downsizing reduced attitudinal support for the change, which translated into reduced behavior change. On balance, crisis inhibited organizational change, rather than promoting it. Â© 2006 by the Association for Public Policy Analysis and Management...|$|R
40|$|This paper studies {{a problem}} {{encountered}} by a <b>buying</b> <b>office</b> {{for one of}} the largest retail distributors in the world. An important task for the <b>buying</b> <b>office</b> is to plan the distribution of goods from Asia to various destinations across Europe. The goods are transported along shipping lanes by shipping companies, which offer different discount rates depending on the freight quantity. To increase the reliability of transportation, the shipper imposes a quantity limit on each shipping company on each shipping lane. To guarantee a minimum business volume, each shipping company requests a minimum total freight quantity over all lanes if it is contracted. The task involves allocating projected demand of each shipping lane to shipping companies subject to the above conditions such that the total cost is minimized. Existing work on this and related problems employs commercial linear programming software to solve their models. However, since the problem is NP−hardNP−hard in the strong sense, it is unlikely to be solvable optimally in reasonable time for large cases. Hence, we propose the first heuristic-based algorithm for the problem, which combines a filter-and-fan search scheme with a tabu search mechanism. Experiments on randomly generated test instances show that as the size of the problem increases, our algorithm produces superior solutions in less time compared to a leading mixed-integer programming solver.
