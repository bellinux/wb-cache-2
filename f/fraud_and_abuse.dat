5|$|Prior to the 1980s crimes {{involving}} {{computers were}} dealt with using existing laws. The first computer crimes were {{recognized in the}} 1978 Florida Computer Crimes Act, which included legislation against the unauthorized modification or deletion of data on a computer system. Over {{the next few years}} the range of computer crimes being committed increased, and laws were passed to deal with issues of copyright, privacy/harassment (e.g., cyber bullying, cyber stalking, and online predators) and child pornography. It was not until the 1980s that federal laws began to incorporate computer offences. Canada was the first country to pass legislation in 1983. This was followed by the US Federal Computer <b>Fraud</b> <b>and</b> <b>Abuse</b> Act in 1986, Australian amendments to their crimes acts in 1989 and the British Computer Misuse Act in 1990.|$|E

40|$|Correspondence {{issued by}} the Government Accountability Office with an {{abstract}} that begins "SBA issued revised policy directives for the SBIR and STTR programs in August 2012 that included new requirements designed to help agencies identify <b>and</b> prevent potential <b>fraud,</b> waste, <b>and</b> <b>abuse</b> in the SBIR and STTR programs [...] changes that SBA developed in consultation with agencies that participate in the programs and a working group of inspectors general. Among other changes, the revised SBIR and STTR policy directives each include a new section on preventing <b>fraud,</b> waste, <b>and</b> <b>abuse</b> in the programs. They also include 10 minimum requirements related to <b>fraud,</b> waste, <b>and</b> <b>abuse</b> that the 11 participating agencies must meet, such as providing {{information on how to}} report <b>fraud,</b> waste, <b>and</b> <b>abuse</b> on their program websites and in solicitations. The revised policy directives include elements of our fraud-prevention framework. Based on our prior work, an effective fraud-prevention framework should include up-front preventive controls, detection and monitoring, and investigations and prosecutions. The 10 requirements in the revised directives include elements of the framework, but the effectiveness of the requirements in helping agencies identify <b>and</b> prevent potential <b>fraud,</b> waste, <b>and</b> <b>abuse</b> will depend on how participating agencies implement the requirements. SBA incorporated input from key stakeholders, specifically the SBIR and STTR program managers and representatives from an inspectors general working group, when developing the revised policy directives.

Grayson requested information about these legal costs after a June 2009 hearing of the House Financial Services Committee. Grayson's work uncovered that, between September 6, 2008 and July 21, 2009, taxpayers spent $6.3 million defending Fannie Mae executives Franklin Raines, J. Timothy Howard, and Leanne Spencer. Taxpayers paid an additional $16.8 million to cover legal expenses of workers at the Office of Federal Housing Enterprise Oversight, Fannie's former regulator.|$|E
