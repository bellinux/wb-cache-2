50|$|Isoseismic {{curves of}} the event {{displayed}} some anomalies in <b>damage</b> <b>distribution.</b> The town of Fosdinovo and its surroundings sustained only minor damage, despite being {{in the middle of}} an area of widespread destruction. Vigneta and Castiglioncello, both frazioni of Casola in Lunigiana, had very different fates: the first was completely devastated, while the latter experienced only a few cracks in the walls and some collapsed chimneys. Study on those anomalies led to a better understanding of the effect of ground composition on the transmission of seismic waves. Vigneta was built on alluvial ground, made of sand and cobbles. It turned out that the cobbles acted as an amplifier for the shock waves, multiplying their intensity and deflecting them in random directions. Sometimes, cobbles shattered, and the ground above was further destabilized. Castiglioncello was built on an extraordinarily compact limestone slab, which acted as a barrier that reflected shock waves. Resonance and shock-wave amplification phenomena, well understood today, were unknown at the time of the Garfagnana earthquake.|$|E
5000|$|While {{the subject}} is {{controversial}} and hotly debated, some believe shock cooling, as commonly explained, {{is nothing but a}} myth. This position is supported by the fact twin engine planes commonly experience ideal conditions for shock cooling during simulated, single engine failures, yet statistically show no difference in wear or <b>damage</b> <b>distribution</b> between engines. Equally, it has been pointed out the rate cylinder head temperatures drop off after a normal engine shutdown is often much faster than the usual rates deemed to present a shock cooling risk. Furthermore, others believe damage usually associated with shock cooling is actually caused by rapid throttle changes where fuel, which has been supercooled during high-altitude flight, is introduced into a very hot engine cylinder during descent, where rich of peak (as opposed to lean of peak) operation is considered the norm, thus causing higher operating temperatures. It is well established, high operating temperatures in of themselves, can contribute to excessive component wear and damage, which is typically associated with [...] "shock cooling".

The moments of the Coulombic, nuclear elastic and nuclear inelastic <b>damage</b> <b>distribution</b> were extracted from Monte Carlo simulations and combined to form a <b>damage</b> <b>distribution</b> using the analytic techniques first described in [I].

40|$|Considerable {{attention}} has been paid over the years to the problem of growing high purity KDP and KD*P to meet damage threshold requirements of ICF lasers at LLNL. The maximum fluence requirement for KD*P triplers on the National Ignition Facility (NIF) is 14. 3 J/cm 2 at 351 nm in a 3 ns pulse. Currently KD*P (conventional or rapid grown) cannot meet this requirement without laser (pre) conditioning. In this overview, recent experiments to understand laser conditioning and damage phenomena in KDP and KD*P will be discussed. These experiments have lead to a fundamental revision of damage test methods and test result interpretation. In particular, the concept of a damage threshold has given way to measuring performance by <b>damage</b> <b>distributions</b> using millimeter sixed beams. Automated R/l (conditioned) damage tests have shown that the best rapidly grown KDP crystals exhibit the same <b>damage</b> <b>distributions</b> at the best conventionally grown KD*P. Continuous filtration of the growth solution and post growth thermal sealing are shown to increase the damage performance as well. In addition, centimeter size beams from multijoule lasers have been used to study stepwise laser conditioning in KDP. These tests have shown that an increase in the damage threshold of ~ 1. 5 X is attainable with 8 - 12 shots of increasing fluence. The experiments show that the damage density (pinpoints/mm 3) evolves exponentially and once formed, the micron sized bulk pinpoints remain stable against increases in local fluence. The information obtained from <b>damage</b> <b>distributions</b> and conditioning studies has been used with model NIF spatial profiles to determine the probability of damage and the local pinpoint density generated in a tripler. Calculations based on test data have shown that. for well conditioned, high quality rapid growth KDP or conventional growth KD*P the damage probability is less than 3 %. Furthermore, the fluence profiles expected on NIF lead to only small numbers of generated pinpoints which are not expected to adversely affect NIF operations. To check the validity of the results, the 37 cm KD*P tripler from the Beamlet laser was mapped for damage. The inspection revealed pinpoint densities of the order of predicted by the damage evolution calculation...|$|R
