500|$|Producer Martin Hannett [...] "dedicated {{himself to}} {{capturing}} and intensifying Joy Division's eerie spatiality". Hannett believed punk rock was sonically conservative {{because of its}} refusal to use studio technology to create sonic space. The producer instead aimed {{to create a more}} expansive sound on the group's records. Hannett said, [...] " [...] were a gift to a producer, because they didn't <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>clue.</b> They didn't argue". Hannett demanded clean and clear [...] "sound separation" [...] not only for individual instruments, but even for individual pieces of Morris's drumkit. Morris recalled, [...] "Typically on tracks he considered to be potential singles, he'd get me to play each drum on its own to avoid any bleed-through of sound". Music journalist Richard Cook noted that Hannett's role was [...] "crucial". There are [...] "devices of distance" [...] in his production and [...] "the sound is an illusion of physicality".|$|E
500|$|The first {{instalment}} of Tintin in the Land of the Soviets {{appeared in the}} 10 January 1929 edition of , and ran weekly until 8 May 1930. Hergé did not plot out the storyline in advance; he improvised new situations on a weekly basis, leaving Jean-Marc and Randy Lofficier to observe that both [...] "Story-wise and graphically, Hergé was learning his craft before our eyes." [...] Hergé admitted that the work was rushed, saying, [...] "The [...] came out on Wednesday evening, and I often didn't <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>clue</b> on Wednesday morning how I {{was going to get}} Tintin out of the predicament I had put him in the previous week." [...] Michael Farr considered this evident, remarking that many drawings were [...] "crude, rudimentary, [...] rushed", lacking the [...] "polish and refinement" [...] that Hergé would later develop. Contrastingly, he thought that certain plates were of the [...] "highest quality" [...] and exhibited Hergé's [...] "outstanding ability as a draughtsman".|$|E
500|$|Tintin in the Congo was serialised {{under the}} French title of Tintin au Congo in Le Petit Vingtième from 5 May 1930 to 11 June 1931; it was {{syndicated}} to the French Catholic newspaper Cœurs Vaillants. Drawn {{in black and}} white, it followed the same formula employed in Land of the Soviets, remaining [...] "essentially plotless" [...] according to Michael Farr, and consisting of largely unrelated events that Hergé improvised each week. Hergé later commented {{on the process of}} writing these early adventures, stating, [...] "The [...] came out on Wednesday evening, and I often didn't <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>clue</b> on Wednesday morning how I was going to get Tintin out of the predicament I had put him in the previous week." [...] The strip's visual style was similar to that of Land of the Soviets. In the first instalment of Tintin in the Congo, Hergé featured Quick and Flupke, two young boys from Brussels whom he had recently introduced in another Le Petit Vingtième comic strip, in the crowd of people saying goodbye to Tintin.|$|E

500|$|When Mitzeee {{realised}} Mercedes was her stalker, Mercedes knocked Mitzeee {{out after}} Mitzeee tries to stab her. Mercedes realised {{that she will}} be blamed for stalking Mitzeee so she stabbed herself to convince people Mitzeee was mad. Metcalfe said the situation was born through [...] "pure desperation". She said that [...] "the thought of Mitzeee, Riley and Bobby as a family together was too much for her to take, and she just saw red. I don't think it's something that Mercedes thought about or planned - she wouldn't have even dreamed of doing it to herself. But at the time, she saw it as the only way out of the situation". Shenton explained that Mitzeee was worried due to the stalker so she decided to take some antidepressants and drink wine, which as she states [...] "isn't a great combination." [...] Shenton revealed that Mercedes arrived to see Mitzee who [...] "still has no idea who the stalker really is, but as they're talking, Mercedes says something that makes Mitzeee discover the truth - and she's totally shocked. Mitzeee is petrified and picks up a knife in the kitchen. The next thing you know, Mitzeee wakes up after being unconscious [...] The first thing she sees is Mercedes with a stab wound and there is blood everywhere. Mitzeee doesn't <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>clue</b> whether she could have stabbed Mercedes, or if someone else came into the flat and did it".|$|E
500|$|Winkelman, an ex-CBS Records {{executive}} and music promoter, {{had moved to}} the Milton Keynes area from London in 1993. He attested to a vast untapped fanbase for football in Milton Keynes—a [...] "football frenzy waiting to happen", he said. Critics of this claim pointed to the apparent lack of public interest in Milton Keynes City and the other local non-League clubs, and argued that Milton Keynes residents interested specifically in League football already had ample access with Luton, Northampton and Rushden & Diamonds all within [...] In Winkelman's own words, in a 2013 interview, he [...] "didn't <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>clue</b> about football" [...] when he was proposing to move a League club from another town—indeed looking back he said [...] "it was that naivety that enabled me to go and do it." [...] He was the only person in Milton Keynes publicly associated with the project; his financial supporters, later revealed to be Asda (a subsidiary of Walmart) and IKEA, were kept strictly anonymous. According to an investigative report by Ian Pollock, published in When Saturday Comes in July 2002, neither the Milton Keynes Council press office, the editor of the Milton Keynes Citizen newspaper nor the head of Invest in MK, the council agency encouraging businesses to move to the area, could tell him who was backing the plans. Winkelman told Pollock his supporters were [...] "major business people in MK and some developers. A number of major international partners who've done this sort of thing before." ...|$|E
500|$|Chrissie left Den but was {{eventually}} convinced {{to give their}} marriage another try. Oberman revealed in the Daily Mail that she drew on a famous real-life model to reconcile the dichotomous behaviour of a strong woman taking back her cheating husband: [...] "I based Chrissie on Hillary: an intelligent, attractive woman who was publicly humiliated. People ask why she stays with that awful man. A lot of strong women are like that." [...] She also saw {{the ebb and flow}} of Den and Chrissie's marriage as a reflection of the mental gameplaying that was so prominent in their characterisations: [...] "I think there's a challenge in it, and I think she would like to be the one who would ultimately tame him." [...] As Den's equal, Chrissie was intended to be a challenge to his propensity for intellectual games, having already outwitted the show's prior , Phil Mitchell (Steve McFadden). Den had seen little threat in his first wife's aptitude, but considered Chrissie to be [...] "as sharp as they come". Indeed, Den's extra-marital dalliances were used by writers to showcase and highlight Chrissie's [...] "strong-willed persona". When Zoe Slater (Michelle Ryan) chastised Den for caring only about Chrissie's reaction should she learn of their affair, Den fired back: [...] "And so should you. You think I've treated you badly? Well you don't <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>clue</b> what's going to happen if she ever finds out! The best thing you can do is keep your mouth shut." [...] By the time Chrissie left the Square, Oberman dryly observed that she had [...] "had more fights on EastEnders than most women have in their whole lives." ...|$|E

2500|$|White told Reuters that [...] "the reason [...] {{got killed}} {{is that they}} are part of an authoritarian social {{movement}} and were seen by the killers as symbolic of that movement ...

2500|$|The Varela Project was lauded by some outside {{observers}} such {{as former}} US President Jimmy Carter, in a May 2002 speech in Havana, Cuba, and the European Union, which awarded Payá the Sakharov Prize for Freedom of Thought. They did not <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>clue</b> about the applicable Cuban Law. Other observers are skeptical: Attempts {{to bring about}} democratic change in Cuba {{with the aid of}} US financing have long been criticized by pundits as [...] "Dead on Arrival" [...] when the initiatives reach Cuba, as there is widespread popular opposition in Cuba to US intervention in Cuban politics (as such, dissidents receiving money from US sources, especially from the CIA, are immediately discredited in Cuban politics). [...] 2004 Democratic Presidential candidate John Kerry called the initiative and its results [...] "counterproductive".|$|E

He applied {{to be on}} the show through a survival camp he was already enrolled at.

A 10,000m run in 27:09.02 minutes saw him gain selection for the 2011 World Championships in Athletics in Daegu. Ibrahim caused an upset in the 10,000m final by overhauling Mo Farah {{in the final stages}} of the race to win the gold medal. Farah had been undefeated up until that point that year while Ibrahim had come from relative obscurity, having competed only in Japan for almost two years.

2500|$|In 1963, Botvinnik founded his own school {{within the}} Soviet {{coaching}} system, and its graduates include world champions Anatoly Karpov, Garry Kasparov and Vladimir Kramnik, and other top-class {{players such as}} Alexei Shirov, Vladimir Akopian and Jaan Ehlvest. Botvinnik was not an infallible spotter of chess talent: although {{he said of the}} 11-year-old Kasparov, [...] "The future of chess lies in the hands of this young man", he said on first seeing Karpov, [...] "The boy doesn't <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>clue</b> about chess, and there's no future at all for him in this profession." [...] But Karpov recounts fondly his youthful memories of the Botvinnik school and credits Botvinnik's training, especially the homework he assigned, with a marked improvement in his own play. Kasparov presents Botvinnik almost as a kind of father figure, going some way towards balancing the common public perception of Botvinnik as dour and aloof; and Kasparov inherited Botvinnik's emphasis on preparation, research and innovation. Botvinnik was still playing a major teaching role in his late 70s, when Kramnik entered the school, and made a favorable impression on his pupil.|$|E

2500|$|Lisa Schwarzbaum of Entertainment Weekly {{gave the}} film an A minus. She praised the {{performance}} of Wormald, commenting that he [...] "handily owns the role for a new audience" [...] and closed her review saying, [...] "Guardians of the '80s flame will approve of the production's sincere respect for the original; church still matters, and so do Ariel's red cowboy boots." [...] Roger Ebert of the Chicago Sun-Times gave a negative review of the film, rating it one and half stars out of four. He criticized the film for being {{so close to the}} 1984 original [...] "sometimes song for song and word-for-word". He thought poorly of Wormald's performance, saying, [...] "He's got the Kevin Bacon role but not the Kevin Bacon charisma." [...] Ebert closed his review expressing, [...] "This new Footloose is a film without wit, humor or purpose. It sets up the town elders as old farts who hate rock 'n' roll. Does it <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>clue</b> that the Rev. Moore and all the other city council members are young enough that they grew up on rock 'n' roll? The film's message is: A bad movie, if faithfully remade, will produce another bad movie." ...|$|E
2500|$|Harper's first album, Sophisticated Beggar, was {{recorded}} in 1966 after he was spotted at Les Cousins and signed to Strike Records. The album consisted of Harper's songs and poetry backed by acoustic guitar, recorded with a Revox tape machine by Pierre Tubbs and with contributions from English guitarist Paul Brett. [...] Columbia Records recognised Harper's potential and hired American producer Shel Talmy to produce Harper's second album, Come Out Fighting Ghengis Smith, which was released in 1968. The 11 minute track [...] "Circle", [...] "a soundscape of Harper's difficult youth", was notable for marking a widening of his musical style away from the more traditional side of contemporary folk music heard at the time. Harper {{had an interest in}} traditional folk but did not consider himself a bona fide member of the folk scene. He later explained: Harper's record company had different expectations. [...] "They wanted me to write commercial pop songs and when they heard the album I made for them, they didn’t <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>clue.</b> They wanted hits. And I gave them [...] "Circle"". Bert Jansch contributed sleeve notes for the album and Harper paid tribute to Jansch with the song [...] "Pretty Baby"; the B-Side non album track of his first single (released in March 1966). During this period, Harper was managed by American music entrepreneur Jo Lustig, manager of The Pentangle and former agent to Julie Felix.|$|E
