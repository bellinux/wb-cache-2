The novel concept uses the correlation properties and bit streaming for reduced complexity architecture to meet real time requirement for asynchronous multiuser detection in wireless communication. To mitigate the effect of <b>multiple</b> <b>access</b> interference (MAI), this paper proposes a novel technique of multiplication and subtraction (Multisub) of cross correlation factor with receiving signal at output of matched filter, {{which is the first}} stage of parallel interference cancellation (PIC) multistage multiuser detector. Typically, asynchronous multiuser detector uses multishot detection, which involves block based computations and matrix inversions. Hence, Multisub correlation based suboptimal scheme have been evaluated to decrease the computational complexity and eliminate the need for matrix inversion. Moreover, such novel scheme can have added advantage to avoiding multishot detection if they start from a matched filter outputs. The paper compares the results of the novel scheme with the traditional single user matched filter and PIC multistage multiuser detector at different number of users. The result of the paper shows that bit error rate (BER) is minimize for 15 -user and the performance of the limited parallel interference cancellation (PIC) multistage multiuser detector improves in that of other schemes.
