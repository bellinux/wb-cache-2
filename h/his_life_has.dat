25|$|The four-act tragicomedy Le Fou? {{is seen by}} Vianu as {{comparable}} in subject matter and depth to Enrico IV, a celebrated 1922 play by Luigi Pirandello. The plot reflects Macedonski's confrontation with his critics, and his acceptance {{of the fact that}} people saw in him an eccentric. The central figure is a banker, Dorval, who identifies himself with Napoleon Bonaparte {{to the point where he}} sees episodes in his biography as mirrors of early 19th-century battles. Unlike patients with dissociative identity disorder, Dorval does not actually imagine <b>his</b> <b>life</b> <b>has</b> become Napoleon's, but rather joins with him on an intellectual level. Witnesses of this disorder are divided into family, who seek to have Dorval committed, and close friends, who come to see his take on life as a manifestation of genius. The spectator is led to believe that the latter interpretation is the correct one. At a larger level, Vianu indicates, the play is also Macedonski's critique of capitalism, and, using Parisian argot, makes allusive references to famous people of the day.|$|E
