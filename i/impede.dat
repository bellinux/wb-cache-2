5|$|In 2001, twenty-one {{northwest}} Washington tribes, {{joined by}} the United States filed a Request for Determination in U.S. District Court, asking the court {{to find that the}} State of Washington has a treaty-based duty to preserve fish runs and habitat sufficiently for the tribes to earn a “moderate living,” and sought to compel the state to repair or replace culverts that <b>impede</b> salmon migration. On August 22, 2007, the district court issued a summary judgment order, holding that while culverts impeding andromadous fish migration are not the only factor diminishing their upstream habitat, in building and maintaining culverts that <b>impede</b> salmon migration, Washington State had diminished the size of salmon runs within the case area and thereby violated its obligation under the Stevens Treaties. On March 29, 2013, the court issued an injunction ordering the state to significantly increase the effort for removing state-owned culverts that block habitat for salmon and steelhead, and to replace the state-owned culverts that have the greatest adverse impact on the habitat of andromadous fish by 2030.|$|E

5|$|Arrowslits, also {{commonly}} called loopholes, were narrow vertical openings in defensive walls which allowed arrows or crossbow bolts {{to be fired}} on attackers. The narrow slits were intended to protect the defender by providing a very small target, but {{the size of the}} opening could also <b>impede</b> the defender if it was too small. A smaller horizontal opening could be added to give an archer a better view for aiming. Sometimes a sally port was included; this could allow the garrison to leave the castle and engage besieging forces. It was usual for the latrines to empty down the external walls of a castle and into the surrounding ditch.|$|E

5|$|Body adaptations, {{especially}} a paddle-like tail, help banded sea kraits to swim. These adaptations {{are also found}} in more distantly related sea snakes (Hydrophiinae) because of convergent evolution.

On dry land, a banded sea krait can still move, but, on average, at only slightly more than a fifth of its swimming speed. In contrast, most other non-Laticauda sea snakes are virtually stranded on dry land.|$|E

40|$|Two {{small groups}} of steroids in the estrane series—here {{designated}} as <b>impeded</b> estrogens,—represent a class of compounds which differ from the majority of estrogenic substances in exerting certain unusual influences on growth of the uterus. The induction of these effects previously {{was considered to be}} peculiar to estriol. The unusual growth properties common to <b>impeded</b> estrogens are twofold: (a) after the threshold dosage required to initiate growth has been reached, the slope of the curve of increment of uterine weight in response to increased steroid dosage is very gradual rather than steep; (b) these compounds possess the ability to inhibit to a limited extent the uterine growth induced by estrone administered concurrently. The partial inhibition of estrone-induced growth of the uterus is confined to a critical dosage of the <b>impeded</b> estrogen and is overcome by increased dosage of the inhibitor. Estrone-induced growth of the vagina is not inhibited by <b>impeded</b> estrogens. Furthermore the simultaneous administration of <b>impeded</b> estrogens and testosterone does not lessen the amount of uterine growth evoked by the latter. The <b>impeded</b> estrogens so far encountered are 3 -hydroxyestratriene derivatives possessing either a ketone group at position 6 or a hydroxyl group at position 16. Oxygenated functions at these positions in phenolic estrogens have special significance in the excitation and restraint of uterine growth unshared by similar groups at certain other sites of the estrane molecule...|$|R
