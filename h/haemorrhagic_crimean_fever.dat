40|$|<b>Crimean</b> Congo hemorrhagic <b>fever</b> virus (CCHFV) {{is one of}} {{the most}} severe viral zoonozes. It is {{prevalent}} throughout Africa, Asia and southern Europe. Limited availability of sequence data has hindered phylogeographic studies. The complete genomic sequence of all three segments of 14 <b>Crimean</b> Congo hemorrhagic <b>fever</b> virus strains isolated from 1958 - 2000 in Russia, Central Asia and Africa was identified. Each genomic segment was independently subjected to continuous Bayesian phylogeographic analysis. The origin of each genomic segment was traced to Africa about 1, 000 - 5, 000 years ago. The virus was first introduced to South and Central Asia in the Middle Ages, and then spread to China, India and Russia. Reverse transfers of genomic segments from Asia to Africa were also observed. The European CCHFV genotype V was introduced to Europe via the Astrakhan region in South Russia 280 - 400 years ago and subsequently gradually spread westward in Russia, to Turkey and the Balkans less than 150 years ago. Only a few recombination events could be suggested in S and L genomic segments, while segment reassortment was very common. The median height of a non-reassortant phylogenetic tree node was 68 - 156 years. There were reassortment events within the European CCHFV lineage, but not with viruses from other locations. Therefore, CCHFV in Europe is a recently emerged zoonosis that represents a spillover from the global gene pool...|$|R
40|$|Background: <b>Crimean</b> Congo hemorrhagic <b>fever</b> (CCHF) {{has high}} {{morbidity}} and mortality. Therefore the treatment effect of Ribavirin {{with and without}} intravenous Immunoglobulin (IVIG) in viral <b>Crimean</b> Congo hemorrhagic <b>fever</b> was evaluated. Materials and Methods: In a clinical trial study, 40 patients with confirmatory positive serology test, 12 (30 %) received Ribavirin and IVIG (case group) and 28 (70 %) received only ribavirin as standards therapy (control group). The patients were followed and compared by defervescence and other clinical symptoms, and laboratory results such as {{white blood cell count}} (WBC), platelets; liver function test (LFT) and duration of hospitalization and mortality rate after eight weeks. Results: The mean (SD) period for defervescence and stopping bleedings was five (0. 6) days in case group and five (0. 5) days in control group with no significant differences (P = 0. 27). The mean period for return of WBC to normal was three (0. 6) days in case group and five (0. 8) days in control group (P = 0. 002). The mean period for return of LFT to normal was three (0. 9) days in case group and seven (0. 5) days in control group which showed a meaningful difference (P = 0. 001) Normalization of platelets was returned within four (0. 8) days in case group compared to 6 (0. 6) days in control group.

Results. The main complaints were general weakness (100 %), diffuse headache (91 %), loss of appetite (76 %), arthralgias (80 %), giddiness (32  %), nausea (52 %), vomiting (46 %), myalgia (65 %) and arthralgia (78  %). Hemorrhagic syndrome manifested with petechial rash (79  %), post-injection (32. 2 %) and traumatic (7. 5 %) hematomas, blee­ding gums (52. 3 %).
