5|$|Stealth {{is based}} on {{limiting}} the player character's visibility; hiding behind objects and buildings, avoiding the enemies' cone of vision, and avoiding lighted areas aid in reducing detection. When hiding behind an object, the player can lean around the sides to see the immediate area and eavesdrop, {{and as long as}} Corvo remains hidden, his enemies will not see him. The player can also look through keyholes to <b>gain</b> <b>insight</b> <b>into</b> closed rooms. Sneaking up behind enemies allows the player to silently subdue them, and unconscious or dead bodies can be moved and hidden.|$|E

There, Apollo 14 had the objective of sampling ejecta from the Imbrium impact to <b>gain</b> <b>insight</b> <b>into</b> the Moon's geologic history. A landing site near the freshly formed Cone crater was chosen, as this crater served as a 'natural drill hole' to allow the astronauts to obtain Imbrium ejecta, the primary objective of the mission.|$|E

Max von Sydow was Scott's original choice to play Weyland, but the casting of Pearce made it possible for him to portray Weyland as both an elderly character, and a younger man who appeared in an earlier script draft.|$|E

5|$|Day-Lewis {{threw his}} {{personal}} version of method acting into full throttle in 1989 with his performance as Christy Brown in Jim Sheridan's My Left Foot, which garnered him numerous awards, including the Academy Award for Best Actor and BAFTA Award for Best Actor. Brown, {{a writer and}} painter, was born with cerebral palsy and was only able to control his left foot. Day-Lewis prepared for the role by making frequent visits to Sandymount School Clinic in Dublin, where he formed friendships with several people with disabilities, {{some of whom had}} no speech. During filming, he refused to break character. Playing a severely paralysed character on screen, off screen Day-Lewis had to be moved around the set in his wheelchair, and crew members would curse at having to lift him over camera and lighting wires, all so that he might <b>gain</b> <b>insight</b> <b>into</b> all aspects of Brown's life, including the embarrassments.

25|$|The first Swedish nuclear reactor, R1, {{was started}} in 1951 and it {{was placed in a}} dug out cavern below the Royal Institute of Technology in Stockholm. It was a small {{experimental}} reactor with a thermal power of 1 MW. The purpose of R1 was not to produce power or plutonium but to <b>gain</b> <b>insight</b> <b>into</b> reactor physics. Also, the uranium extraction site in Kvarntorp reached its intended production capacity. In 1953, the Swedish scientists realized that the critical mass for the plutonium fueled nuclear weapons had been overestimated and the figure was reduced down to 5–10kg in a report by Sigvard Eklund, which meant that the production requirement for plutonium was significantly less than it was earlier anticipated. In 1955, FOA concluded that Sweden would be able to produce nuclear weapons once it had a plutonium reactor.|$|E
25|$|It is both biochemically and {{medically}} {{interesting how}} tarantula hawk venom works. How can an essentially non-toxic venom that causes so much pain, described as blinding, debilitating, and shockingly electric by Schmidt, subside in only three minutes in humans? Only the bullet ant is ranked {{higher than the}} tarantula hawk’s sting on Schmidt’s Sting Pain Index. How does it permanently paralyze a tarantula, yet keep it alive? It is also evolutionarily interesting and significant how such a toxin evolved. Selection pressure by potential vertebrate predators would have favored individuals with painful venom components, but not vertebrate-lethal components. At the same time, selection pressure against venom lethality towards prey and subsequent loss of prey to spoilage would be very strong. The tarantula hawk’s venom is a specific, evolutionarily tailored cocktail of compounds best suited to the wasps’ needs. Studying tarantula hawk venom may help us <b>gain</b> <b>insight</b> <b>into</b> treating human problems like chronic pain from injury or disease.|$|E
25|$|To <b>gain</b> <b>insight</b> <b>into</b> the {{physiology}} of starvation, in 1944 Keys {{carried out a}} starvation study with 36 conscientious objectors as test subjects in the Minnesota Starvation Experiment. At the time, conscientious objectors were being placed in virtual concentration camps, with a few functioning like the Civilian Public Service, so that recruiting them would prove easier than seeking out volunteers in the general population. The original pool of 400 responders was reduced to 36 selectees, of whom 32 {{would go on to}} complete the study. The main focus of the study was threefold: set a metabolic baseline for three months, study the physical and mental effects of starvation on the volunteers for six months, and then study the physical and mental effects of different refeeding protocols on them for three months. The participants would first be placed on the three-month baseline diet of 3200 calories after which their calories were reduced to 1800 calories/day while expending 3000 calories in activities such as walking. The final three months were a refeeding period where the volunteers were divided into four groups, each receiving a different caloric intake.|$|E
