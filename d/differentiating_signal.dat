The original kind of fluoroscopy, and the common kind for its first half century of existence, simply used none, because for most diagnosis and treatment, they weren't essential. For those investigations {{that needed to be}} transmitted or recorded (such as for training or research), movie cameras using film (such as 16 mm film) were the medium. In the 1950s, analog electronic video cameras (at first only producing live output but later using video tape recorders) appeared. Since the 1990s, there have been digital video cameras, flat panel detectors, and storage of data to local servers or (more recently) secure cloud servers. Late-model fluoroscopes all use digital image processing and image analysis software, which not only helps to produce optimal image clarity and contrast but also allows that result with a minimal radiation dose (because signal processing can take tiny inputs from low radiation doses and amplify them while to some extent also <b>differentiating</b> <b>signal</b> from noise).|$|E

40|$|The {{use of the}} {{three-way}} catalyst in motor vehicles has entailed a radical increase {{in the importance of}} misfire detection. In the case of a misfire, unburned fuel accesses the exhaust system, where its combustion in catalyst causes a dangerous increase of temperature, which may result in damage to the catalyst due to its thermal overload. Moreover, it may also lead to an increased emission of toxic substances. Therefore, misfire in an internal combustion engine must be detected, as specified in the On-Board Diagnostics II (OBDII) regulations beginning from 1996 model year, according to the Environmental Protection Agency (E. P. A.). Misfire detection constitutes an essential ingredient of OBDII. Its implementation entails the use of sophisticated measurement methods and the processing of the measured signals. Misfires tend to be related to a faulty ignition system, (Defective ignition plugs, leaking secondary insulation, damaged ignition control module or high voltage wires). Yet there is still a wide spectrum of other possible causes of misfire, not connected with the spark generation circuit. Misfire may rise, for example; due to the leaky intake manifold, mechanisms damage to the engine, EGR system valve damage, inappropriate air-fuel ratio, Exhaust restrictions, damaged crankcase ventilation system (PVC), damaged injector, damaged intake or outlet valves or their improper control timing. If misfire occurs with such high frequency that the excessive quantity of unburned fuel accessing the catalyst threatens to damage it, the blinking malfunction indicator lamp (MIL) will make the driver aware of the extent of the damage of the engine. Many strategies of misfire detection have been developed, including variation in engine shaft angular speed, spark plug voltage, cylinder pressure, oxygen sensor signal, knowledge based expert system, and neural networks. WE propose a new method to use the real time signals of conventional oxygen sensor (EGO) and wide band oxygen sensor (UEGO) to detect misfire. In this paper, misfire was induced on purpose with a misfire generator. The sensors and the misfire trigger signals were recorded simultaneously. In this paper, we suggested a misfire detection method which used the fluctuation of an EGO and an UEGO sensors output signals caused by a misfire. The fluctuation in oxygen concentration in an exhaust manifold was estimated by recording the conventional oxygen sensor signal and the wide band oxygen sensor signal. It was found that the <b>differentiated</b> sensors’ <b>signals</b> give the criteria for misfire detection. The misfire can be detected by monitoring the amplitude of the fluctuation in the <b>differentiated</b> <b>signals.</b> The <b>differentiated</b> <b>signals</b> of UEGO and EGO sensors can be used for misfire detection in a single cylinder motorcycle engine at any operating conditions. The proposed misfire detection method had showed a reliability up to 98 % for UEGO and 90 % for EGO sensors at different engine operating conditions such as: engine speed from idle (2000 rpm) to 5000 rpm, engine loads 20 %TPS to 60 % TPS, and Air-fuel ratio varying from lean to rich.

Results Here, we show that non-invasive resonant waveguide grating (RWG) biosensor <b>differentiates</b> <b>signaling</b> of endogenous protease activated receptor subtype 1 (PAR 1) and 2 (PAR 2) in human epidermoid carcinoma A 431 cells. The biosensor directly measures dynamic mass redistribution (DMR) resulted from ligand-induced receptor activation in adherent cells. In A 431, both PAR 1 and PAR 2 agonists, but neither PAR 3 nor PAR 4 agonists, trigger dose-dependent Ca 2 + mobilization as well as G q -type DMR signals. Both Ca 2 + flux and DMR signals display comparable desensitization patterns upon repeated stimulation with different combinations of agonists. However, PAR 1 and PAR 2 exhibit distinct kinetics of receptor re-sensitization. Furthermore, both trypsin- and thrombin-induced Ca 2 + flux signals show almost identical dependence on cell surface cholesterol level, but their corresponding DMR signals present different sensitivities.
