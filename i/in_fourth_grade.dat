5|$|By {{the age of}} five, Burke's local youth {{basketball}} league had {{to change}} its rules {{so that he would}} not keep stealing the ball from the other team. As a result of his prowess, he was not allowed over half court when the other team had the ball. He became Jared Sullinger's best friend <b>in</b> <b>fourth</b> <b>grade,</b> but when his mother was transferred to Atlanta in sixth grade they were separated. The reassignment only lasted one year, however. At the age of nine, Burke's father made him do everything with his left hand, including brushing his teeth and eating dinner, in order to develop his ambidexterity.|$|E

Born [...] November 8, 1985, and raised in Chatham, New Jersey, Hewitt began playing lacrosse as a youth. [...] Both of his older brothers played and introduced him to the sport. Hewit started playing lacrosse <b>in</b> <b>fourth</b> <b>grade</b> in a local recreational league in his hometown. By sixth grade he was converted from an attackman to a goalie, but not until the coaches convinced his mother's that her concern for her son's safety were unwarranted. He met his middle school, high school and college teammate Dan Cocoziello taking an entrance exam for the Delbarton School in sixth grade. [...] On the seventh and eighth grade team and the freshman team at the Delbarton School he also played goalie. [...] In eighth grade, he made a New Jersey state eighth-grade all-star team along with Cocoziello that competed against all-stars from other states. [...] He made the varsity team as a sophomore and helped lead the team to a cumulative 634 record and three high school lacrosse state championships. He was an all-state and all-conference goalie who made the headmaster’s list as a student. He was regarded as the fifth-best high school lacrosse recruit in the nation in the 2003, according to Inside Lacrosse. Since his older brother Grant was at Princeton, the college was on his short list along with Johns Hopkins, Duke, Harvard and Dartmouth. Grant later became captain of the 2006 Tigers lacrosse team.|$|E

2500|$|Watterson {{drew his}} first cartoon at age eight, and {{spent much time}} in {{childhood}} alone, drawing and cartooning. This continued through his school years, during which time he discovered comic strips such as Pogo, Krazy Kat, and Charles Schulz' Peanuts which subsequently inspired and influenced his desire to become a professional cartoonist. On one occasion when he was <b>in</b> <b>fourth</b> <b>grade,</b> {{he wrote a letter}} to Charles Schulz, who responded — to Watterson's surprise — making a big impression on him at the time. His parents encouraged him in his artistic pursuits. Later, they recalled him as a [...] "conservative child" [...] — imaginative, but [...] "not in a fantasy way", and certainly nothing like the character of Calvin that he later created. Watterson found avenues for his cartooning talents throughout primary and secondary school, creating high school-themed super hero comics with his friends and contributing cartoons and art to the school newspaper and yearbook.|$|E
