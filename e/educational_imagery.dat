30|$|Finally, {{the results}} of GIS and remote sensing imagery {{analysis}} with focus on the coastal zone herein, {{could serve as a}} powerful instructional and sensitizing tool for the population at large, which may not appreciate the dangers experienced in the coastal areas of Southern Mississippi as a result of overpopulation.

40|$|The Antarctic {{ice sheet}} changes in size {{over the course}} of a year. When it is summer in the {{southern}} hemisphere, the ice sheet decreases in size. As the ice sheet melts, it releases fresh water into the ocean. In the southern winter (our summer), the ice refreezes, drawing fresh water out of the surrounding ocean, leaving the salt behind. These seasonal changes in the ice sheet are examined in this activity, utilizing satellite <b>imagery.</b> <b>Educational</b> levels: High school, Middle school...|$|R

40|$|This {{interactive}} adventure engages {{children in}} a story-based scenario that emphasizes concepts of remote sensing and how NASA scientists use satellite imagery {{to better understand the}} Earth's environmental changes. It introduces students to Earth science concepts, beginning with classifying objects in satellite images by shape, color and texture, building a foundation for interpreting and understanding remote sensing. The story is set in New York City, chosen for its size, diversity and the visibility of prominent features in satellite <b>imagery.</b> <b>Educational</b> levels: Informal education...|$|R
40|$|This {{resource}} {{provides an}} introduction to the function and uses of the The National Weather Service's (NWS) Weather Surveillance Doppler Radar (WSR- 88 D).

40|$|Until very recently, {{planetary}} scientists {{had thought that}} Mars is a cold, dry planet. Then {{in the summer of}} 2000, NASA released images from the Mars Global Surveyor showing evidence of very recent seepage of ground water from crater and valley slopes in the planet's southern hemisphere. It seems that substantial reservoirs of the water that once may have run so copiously on the surface may still exist. Evidence of other water-created landforms is presented and accompanied by remote <b>imagery.</b> <b>Educational</b> levels: Graduate or professional, High school, Undergraduate lower division, Undergraduate upper division...|$|R

40|$|This {{ozone hole}} {{animation}} {{was created for}} the panel session Astrophysics or Astro-graphics at the workshop Communicating Astronomy to the Public on October 2, 2003. The purpose of the animation was to illustrate two different ways that a visualization might be structured based {{on the amount of}} time the viewer had to look at it. The animation on the left fully illustrated the data, imperfections and all, under the assumption that a presenter would have time to explain the animation in detail. The animation on the right had all the data imperfections removed by interpolation, under the assumption that the viewer would only have 20 or 30 seconds to look at it (on the evening news, for example) with only the briefest of explanations. The problem was that, without explanation, a layman might interpret the region of missing data in the movie on the left to be the ozone hole, instead of the central blue region. The point was that the truth of a visualization lies {{in the mind of the}} beholder, not in the absolute content of the <b>imagery.</b> <b>Educational</b> levels: Undergraduate lower division, Undergraduate upper division, Graduate or professional...|$|R
