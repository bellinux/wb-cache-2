[...] Bentley felt that Chenoweth was overused, and called her appearance in the episode [...] "nonsensical and unnecessary". Todd VanDerWerff of The A.V. Club graded the episode [...] "C". He felt that the three main plot strands were poorly balanced, resulting in an episode with [...] "powerful moments that drown as they're nearly subsumed by everything else going on." [...] VanDerWerff criticized Mercedes' storyline as being too abrupt, and deemed her performance of [...] "Beautiful": [...] "so forced that it loses any power it might have from what's a genuinely nice arrangement of the song." [...] Finally, he expressed his concern that the prevalence of songs in Glee may detract from {{the quality of the}} show.

One form of wiretapping utilized by the NSA is RADON, a bi-directional host tap that can inject Ethernet packets onto the same target. It allows bi-directional exploitation of Denied networks using standard on-net tools. [...] The one limitation of RADON is that it is a USB device that requires a physical connection to a laptop or PC to work. RADON was created by a Massachusetts firm called Netragard. Their founder, Adriel Desautels, said about RADON, “it is our ‘safe’ malware. RADON is designed to enable us to infect customer systems in a safe and controllable manner. Safe means that every strand is built with an expiration date that, when reached, results in RADON performing an automatic and clean self-removal.” ...|$|E

40|$|Profiling {{the online}} {{behaviour}} of Internet users {{has become a}} defining feature of the <b>Internet.</b> Individual <b>surfing</b> behaviour is tracked by many enterprises for statistical purposes, but also for behavioural advertising and other personalisation services. Profiling implies the processing of personal data often facilitated by cookies and other markers placed on the terminal equipment of Internet users. The European rules for the regulation of cookies and similar technologies were modified in 2009 requiring prior consent of the user, in order to guarantee that the user has some control over the processing of their information. In 2013 the Netherlands introduced probably the strictest implementation of the European rules concerning the installation of cookies. However, in practice the new legal requirements resulted in neglect of the obligations regarding user information {{on the one hand and}} in the widespread deployment of annoying banners, popup screens and ‘cookie walls’ on the other. Not only the advertising industry, but also web publishers and even ordinary Internet users opposed the regulation. Furthermore, the regulation, certainly initially, did not lead to increased user control. These and other factors support the conclusion that the Dutch cookie regulation is a case of regulatory failure. This paper discusses the practices that were deployed in the Netherlands and assesses them based on a multi-site study that examined the practices of 100 Dutch websites with regard to the installation of cookies. It further reflects on the response of the Dutch regulator, who –under the pressure of industry and consumers outcry- amended the relevant provisions of the Dutch Telecommunications Act in 2014...|$|R
40|$|With the {{development}} of mobile networks, customer needs and behaviours have changed. Mobile communications means {{so much more than}} simple voice communication; there is now mobile <b>Internet</b> with web <b>surfing,</b> videophone, streaming media, and micro blogging. The objective of network optimization has gradually shifted from enhancing network performance to improve quality of experience (QoE). Therefore, assessing and optimizing QoE is the trend for optimizing future mobile networks. Today, users want reliable access for their content, wherever they go in the network. To deliver the best possible experience to mobile broadband subscribers, operators need new ways to assess performance that will enable them to build and manage their networks in the most efficient way. The new paradigmatic eco system (user-interfacenetwork- content) requires novel and disruptive end-to-end considerations in order to enable and sustain the next generation of services and user experience. Thus, the extraordinary adoption of mobile connectivity by end users, and the need for optimized bandwidth management network resource, on the one hand, and the growing interest for good quality content delivery/consumption, is boosting the creation of new network solutions.

In accordance with this aim, we examined and reported their internet usage patterns and main purposes of using IT with a field survey. As a result of this research, it was aimed to state a general profile of the students reflecting their practices towards internet usage. At the same time, this study reveals that using information technologies make students not just to consume technology but also lead them to produce it.
