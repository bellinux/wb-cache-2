40|$|Brussels Free University Information and Documentation Science Department is {{implementing}} a documentary computer system, {{to be used}} as an in-house cost-free access, educational tool for its students. The online bibliographic search subsystem, called SERIDU, is based on a subset of the Euronet standard command language, which is being implemented by several <b>DIANE</b> <b>hosts.</b> A comparison is made of Euronet and of SERIDU commands, {{as well as of the}} data elements of Unisist Reference Manual and of the storage subsystems of the Department. A description is given of SERIDU commands, and is illustrated by a short sample session. The software is briefly described, as well as its present shortcomings and the future developments of the system, which might interest other library schools.

50|$|<b>Diane</b> Rehm <b>hosted</b> {{the show}} since 1979, {{when it was}} titled 'Kaleidoscope'; it was renamed for her in 1984. The show was {{sometimes}} guest hosted when Rehm is out for treatment for her spasmodic dysphonia, by a rotating list of NPR and NPR-related hosts including Susan Page, Tom Gjelten, Steve Roberts, Terence Smith, Frank Sesno, Andrea Seabrook, and Katty Kay. In March 2007, Rehm missed shows due to a bout of pneumonia. In March 2007, Diane Rehm suffered severe and painful corneal burns when she sprayed perfume on her contact lens {{during a trip to}} Oklahoma City. Rehm said that she labeled the identical three-ounce tinted plastic bottles to show they held different solutions but that the labels became blurred and hard to read, especially without her lenses in.|$|R
50|$|On December 9, 2005, <b>host</b> <b>Diane</b> Mizota {{announced}} the show had been canceled {{as a part}} of the retooling of G4 to cover a broader male audience. Running for four years and making 116 episodes, it was one of the few shows to have been on the network since its launch. The Howard Stern Show then announced on April 18, 2006 that Filter would return on Saturday June 3, 2006, with Stern's girlfriend Beth Ostrosky as host. In addition, the top-ten format would be altered so that lists may contain different numbers of items.|$|R
5000|$|Firestein {{explained}} to talk show <b>host</b> <b>Diane</b> Rehm {{that most people}} believe ignorance precedes knowledge, but in science, ignorance follows knowledge. Knowledge enables scientists to propose and pursue interesting questions about data that sometimes don’t exist or fully make sense yet. [...] "I use that term purposely {{to be a little}} provocative. But I don't mean stupidity. I don't mean dumb. I don't mean a callow indifference to facts or data or any of that," [...] Firestein said. Instead, thoughtful ignorance looks at gaps in a community's understanding and seeks to resolve them.|$|R
5000|$|Critics {{have pointed}} out that other programs, such as the eight-million {{listener}} per week Howard Stern Show, are absent from AFRTS. (This statement was made before Stern left for satellite radio in 2006.) Other claims—for example, that there is no political counterbalance to Limbaugh on AFRTS—have been rebutted by Byron York, a columnist for the predominantly conservative National Review: [...] "American military men and women abroad have access, for example, to the talk show of liberal <b>host</b> <b>Diane</b> Rehm ... Jim Hightower and CBS News anchorman Dan Rather." [...] Another possible political counterbalance to Limbaugh is Harry Shearer, who emphasizes his presence on AFRTS {{at the end of every}} episode of his satirical Le Show.|$|R
50|$|One evening, <b>Diane</b> {{decides to}} <b>host</b> a party, ruining Lane's plans with Peter. Peter arrives early and confesses to Stephanie {{that he has}} {{wanted to be alone}} with her for a long time. Outside, there is an {{electrical}} storm, and the lights go out. Candles and piano music create a romantic setting. Diane finds her old Ouija board and talks to the spirits of her previous lovers. A very drunk Howard finally reveals his feelings to Lane, who does not return them. Peter tells Lane that he does not share her feelings. Lane seems to take the rejection well. When everyone else has gone to bed, Peter tries seducing Stephanie, but she is conflicted, later following him back to his house.|$|R
5000|$|Trinity Foundation members, {{acting on}} this information, started digging through dumpsters outside Tilton's many {{banks in the}} Tulsa area as well as dumpsters outside the office of Tilton's lawyer, J.C. Joyce (also based in Tulsa). Over the next 30 days, Trinity's [...] "garbologists", as Anthony dubbed them, found tens of {{thousands}} of discarded prayer requests, bank statements, computer printouts containing the coding for how Tilton's [...] "personalized" [...] letters were generated, and more, all of which were shown in detail on the Tilton segment within the Primetime Live documentary, now titled [...] "The Apple of God's Eye". In a follow-up broadcast on November 28, 1991, Primetime Live <b>host</b> <b>Diane</b> Sawyer said that the Trinity Foundation and Primetime Live assistants found prayer requests in bank dumpsters on 14 separate occasions in a 30-day period.|$|R
50|$|The movie {{starts with}} a {{voice-over}} of Jane Goodale (Ashley Judd) over the images of a scientific experiment with a bull and a herd of cows, apparently the bull never mounts a cow twice, not even if her scent is changed. He prefers a new cow. Jane says that until recently, she believed that men are all like the bull, but to understand what happened {{we have to go}} back in time. Jane is a production assistant with a talk show that has recently been syndicated, which means that the <b>host</b> <b>Diane</b> Roberts (Ellen Barkin) who wants to be the best, is always looking for the ungettable guests, like Fidel Castro. Eddie Alden (Hugh Jackman) is the producer of the talk show and is a womanizer, much to the dismay of Jane who comments on his actions with amicable critique.|$|R

5000|$|However, on May 8, 2007, {{during an}} {{interview}} by NPR radio <b>host</b> <b>Diane</b> Rehm, Mr. Breathed responded to an e-mail question regarding the existence of Opus: The Last Christmas by saying, Uh, the better question is, 'Is there an Opus movie going to come out?' {{and the answer is}} 'no.' And, now I can say it's all for the better. Uh, the Weinstein brothers at Miramax tried for five years to develop an Opus movie, their first animated film, and it was, let me just say, it probably wasn't destined to be, as ... as it probably shouldn't. And the problem with developing these kinds of movies and films is that inevitably they discover that a property as idiosyncratic as a comic strip doesn't translate well unless you have the confidence of bringing the creator in and factoring him into the creation of the movie. They never, never do that. Yeah, um, they just don't trust us. So without that control there probably shouldn't be an Opus movie. In a June 2007 interview with Salon.com, Breathed confirmed that the Miramax feature was [...] "dead", but left the door open for an independently produced Opus film: There'll only be a movie if I'm writing it, which will probably keep him off the big expensive screen ... probably just as well.|$|R
