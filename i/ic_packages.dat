40|$|The aim of {{the study}} is to present the Variable Precision Rough Sets (VPRS) {{methodology}} to improving the classification accuracy for <b>IC</b> <b>Packaging</b> Product Database. The selection of proper packaging and manufacturing procedures is one of the priorities in IC design operations. Separation of industrial production characteristics require that IC designers have to ask the <b>IC</b> <b>packaging</b> engineers down the supply chain to confirm information regarding related product information, such as <b>IC</b> <b>packaging</b> type, size, functional features and price before they can select <b>IC</b> <b>packaging</b> products and determine IC product design procedures. In response to these product information demands from IC designers, service staffs of <b>IC</b> <b>packaging</b> factories integrate information from various departments to provide feedback to the designers. However, as the related information is very complex and professional, precious time is wasted during their communications, which instigates a failure to meet the demand of quick response. Furthermore, the IC product design and development cost and timing may be affected by lack of information. In an age of <b>IC</b> <b>packaging</b> technological breakthroughs, <b>IC</b> <b>packaging</b> structure and technological capabilities have already become key stages of IC design and manufacturing processes. Hence, it has become a very significant topic of the design industry, to effectively and rapidly, obtain ample product related information of <b>IC</b> <b>packaging</b> to meet their operational demands and enable them to improve operational costs and shorten processes. The present study adopts the VPRS method, an improved rough set theory to be applied to classification accuracy of the <b>IC</b> <b>packaging</b> product database; then compare the highest accuracy values with the values and rules obtained from the Johnson rough algorithm. The experimental results prove that proper β values, based on VPRS, are able to improve <b>IC</b> <b>packaging</b> product classification accuracy to obtain more consistent values and simpler rules regarding maximum value...|$|R

40|$|The {{integrated}} circuit (<b>IC)</b> <b>packaging</b> electromagnetic compatibility (EMC) /signal integrity (SI) /power integrity (PI) {{problems have been}} broadly attested. But <b>IC</b> <b>packaging</b> electromagnetic interference (EMI) was seldom addressed. Because the electromagnetic emission from IC packagings becomes more critical as the data rate of digital system continues increasing. Its working mechanism and modeling technology are very important. In this thesis, EM emission behaviors of <b>IC</b> <b>packaging</b> are systematically studied for the first time. It was never seen from other literatures. The fundamental principles and properties of electromagnetic radiations caused by heat sinks, vias, traces, and pin maps in <b>IC</b> <b>packaging</b> structures are carefully investigated and modeled. Both theoretical analysis based on first principles and simulated results based on numerical full wave solvers are provided to find out critical impact factors to <b>IC</b> <b>packaging</b> EMI. This work establishes basic modeling components for comprehensive radiation studies. It directly benefits fundamental understandings and guideline development for the optimization of the packaging EMI reduction. Some measurement results are also included to support concluded characterizations and analysis. A summary for <b>IC</b> <b>packaging</b> EMI design rules is discussed in details to conclude the derived design guidelines. Second, a novel data pattern based electromagnetic superposition method is developed to model the <b>IC</b> <b>packaging</b> electromagnetic emission. It employs the equivalence principle to obtain the electromagnetic field response over a broad spectrum. Then it uses the linear property of the passive parasitic system to superimpose the contribution of different signals on the packaging. As a result, with certain pre-calculations, it is convenient to compute the electromagnetic emission efficiently from different signals with various signal pattern combinations, which benefits identifying the worst case scenario. The proposed method can be implemented between different tools for specific purposes. In addition, data reconstruction can be evaluated through the phase shift, and it benefits identifying the EMI of any pulse bit pattern. This work offers great convenience for the post-processing, and allows the flexibility of real digital pulse signals. It provides a basic modeling framework for comprehensive radiation studies for <b>IC</b> <b>packaging</b> and PCB EMI reductions. Third, the performance of IC interconnects has been stretched tremendously in recently years by high speed IC systems. Their EM emission and SI modelings {{have to consider the}} existence of I/O active devices, such as buffers and drivers. The I/O model is difficult to obtain due to the IP protection and limited information. We proposed to use the X-parameter to model the IC interconnect system. Based on the PHD formalism, X-parameter models provide an accurate frequency-domain method under large-signal operating points to characterize their nonlinear behaviors. Starting from modeling the CMOS inverter, the whole link modeling primarily based on X-parameter for the pulse digital signals was presented. I/O modeling can also be investigated by the proposed new method to understand the impedance effects at high speed serial links. It is the first complete examination of the X-parameter to IC interconnect SI analysis. The nonlinear I/O property represented by IBIS models is also investigated to model its impact to <b>IC</b> <b>packaging</b> EMI. Statistical analysis is proposed to provide insightful results on random bit patterns. published_or_final_versionElectrical and Electronic EngineeringDoctoralDoctor of Philosoph...|$|R
