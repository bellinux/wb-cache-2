5|$|A brawl scene between Johnson's and Diesel's {{characters}} {{was considered}} difficult to choreograph. The characters were written {{to be equally}} formidable, so the fight was punctuated with moments of character development, as Moritz felt this made the fight more <b>exciting.</b> The scene required several weeks of rehearsal {{and more than a}} week of filming by the actors and their stunt doubles, who incurred several minor injuries.|$|E

40|$|WOS: 000354775800005 International audienceState-averaged (SA) {{variants}} of the spin-restricted ensemble-referenced Kohn-Sham (REKS) method, SA-REKS and state-interaction (SI) -SA-REKS, implement ensemble density functional theory for variationally obtaining excitation energies of molecular systems. In this work, the currently existing {{version of the}} SA-REKS method, which included only one <b>excited</b> state into the ensemble averaging, is extended by adding more <b>excited</b> states to the averaged energy functional. A general strategy for extension of the REKS-type methods to larger ensembles of ground and <b>excited</b> states is outlined and implemented in extended versions of the SA-REKS and SI-SA-REKS methods. The newly developed methods are tested in the calculation of several <b>excited</b> states of ground-state multi-reference systems, such as dissociating hydrogen molecule, and <b>excited</b> states of donor-acceptor molecular systems. For hydrogen molecule, the new method correctly reproduces the distance dependence of the lowest <b>excited</b> state energies and describes an avoided crossing between the doubly <b>excited</b> and singly <b>excited</b> states. For bithiophene-perylenediimide stacked complex, the SI-SA-REKS method correctly describes crossing between the locally <b>excited</b> state and the charge transfer <b>excited</b> state and yields vertical excitation energies in good agreement with the ab initio wavefunction methods.
