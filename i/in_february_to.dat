5|$|After repairs were completed, Fortune {{was briefly}} {{assigned}} to the Mediterranean Fleet before she {{was transferred to the}} Eastern Fleet in the Indian Ocean in early 1942. The ship screened an aircraft carrier during the Battle of Madagascar later that year and was assigned to convoy escort duties for the rest of 1942 and early 1943. She returned home <b>in</b> <b>February</b> <b>to</b> begin conversion into an escort destroyer. The ship was transferred to the Royal Canadian Navy (RCN) when it was completed in mid-1943 and renamed HMCS Saskatchewan. The ship spent the next year escorting convoys in the North Atlantic before she was transferred to the English Channel to defend convoys during the Normandy landings in June 1944. Sasketchewan engaged some German patrol boats the following month and was lightly damaged. She was sent to Canada for repairs and a general refit and did not return to the UK until January 1945. The ship resumed her former duties {{until the end of the}} war in May and then ferried troops back to Canada for several months. Sasketchewan was judged surplus later that year and was sold for scrap, in early 1946.|$|E
5|$|Following {{six months}} of {{training}} and re-organisation in Australia, the 2/31st returned to New Guinea in July 1943 where, {{under the command of}} Lieutenant Colonel Murray Robson who had previously served as second in command, they took part in the Salamaua-Lae campaign, before carrying out patrolling operations through the Markham Valley and into the Finisterre Range as part of the Finisterre Range campaign. After having been relieved by the 24th Battalion in January 1944, the 2/31st was once again withdrawn to Australia, arriving there <b>in</b> <b>February</b> <b>to</b> reconstitute and train for the next phase of the war.|$|E
5|$|In early 1934 Plaa and Cochet {{went on to}} {{showcase}} in Rio de Janeiro where they were challenged by the Pilo Facondi and Perico Facondi brothers, Chile's leading professionals, who both lost their matches against Cochet but managed to win at least one set. Plaa and Cochet returned <b>in</b> <b>February</b> <b>to</b> the Madison Square Garden where Vines and Tilden were already practising and waiting for them. In a three-day round robin indoors tournament Vines and Tilden outclassed Cochet in a four and five-set match respectively and the Americans were victorious in the doubles over the French pair as well. They then {{set out on a}} ten-city tour across the United States and Canada where the Tilden-Cochet match was always the main fixture. Tilden finished the tour as winner by an eight to two head-to-head margin against Cochet. In April in Providence Cochet was drawn to play Vincent Richards in singles and with Plaa played Barnes and Richards, both matches resulted in a French two straight sets victory. The first official knock-out tournament was held in May at the Park Avenue Tennis Club, New York and was called the Eastern Pro Championships. Cochet was eliminated in the semifinals.|$|E

West Indies {{dismissed}} Bangladesh for 58runs, the team's lowest {{score in}} ODIs and a record low for a Full Member at the World Cup. Shakib's house was stoned by angry {{fans in the}} aftermath, as was the West Indies team bus as it left the ground. Bangladesh registered wins against England, Ireland and the Netherlands, but defeats by West Indies, India and South Africa meant they did not progress beyond {{the first round of}} the tournament. With 8wickets at an average of 27.87, Shakib was Bangladesh's lead wicket-taker in the tournament, and his 142runs from 6innings made him the team's third highest run-scorer.|$|E
25|$|Without any {{agricultural}} crops {{or experience}} gathering, preparing and eating the ground acorns and grass seeds the Indians subsisted on {{for much of}} the year, the shortage of food at San Diego became extremely critical during {{the first few months of}} 1770. They subsisted by eating some of their cattle, wild geese, fish, and other food exchanged with the Indians for clothing, but the ravages of scurvy continued because there was then no understanding of the cause or cure of scurvy (a deficiency of vitamin C in fresh food). A small quantity of corn they had planted grew well, only to be eaten by birds. Portolá sent Captain Rivera and a small detachment of about 40 men south to the Baja California missions <b>in</b> <b>February</b> <b>to</b> obtain more cattle and a pack-train of supplies.|$|E
25|$|Datsyuk {{finished}} with his lowest end-of-season point total since the lockout in the 2009–10 season, scoring 70 points in 82 games. As {{a result of}} early season injuries to sniper Johan Franzén, center Valtteri Filppula and defenceman Niklas Kronwall, the Red Wings struggled to find consistency. However, a strong finish escalated the team from ninth place in the Western Conference <b>in</b> <b>February</b> <b>to</b> fifth place, and another 100-point season. Datsyuk scored the first two goals in Game 7 {{of the first round}} against the Phoenix Coyotes, including a breakaway deke on Ilya Bryzgalov, that sent the Wings to the second round for the fourth consecutive playoff season. The Red Wings, however, lost in five games to the San Jose Sharks.|$|E
