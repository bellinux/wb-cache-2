The influence of <b>drilling</b> speed and amount of feed on <b>drilling</b> forces has been studied by the single factor experiment. The conclusions indicated: when the feed went bigger, the <b>drilling</b> forces of the polished <b>drills</b> were lesser than unpolished <b>drills</b> for un-coating drills; but for coating <b>drills,</b> the <b>drilling</b> forces of the polished <b>drills</b> were greater than unpolished <b>drills.</b> With the increase of cutting speed, <b>drilling</b> forces of un-coating <b>drills</b> mounted up first but went down afterward; and the <b>drilling</b> forces of coating <b>drills</b> increased monotonously...|$|R
40|$|AbstractAt present, in {{our country}} the main deep <b>drilling</b> rigs are rotary disk <b>drilling</b> rig, spindle-type <b>drilling</b> rig and full {{hydraulic}} motor head drive <b>drilling</b> rig, and most of foreign <b>drilling</b> rig equipment are full hydraulic motor head drive <b>drilling</b> rigs. These rigs have many disadvantages; they cannot meet the demand of deep <b>drilling.</b> As the major breakthroughs {{were made in the}} development of high power permanent magnet frequency conversion motor, it is possible to develop the permanent-magnet motor direct drive top-driving <b>drilling</b> rig, so the efficiency of <b>drilling</b> can be improved. In this paper, the difficulties of deep <b>drilling</b> and existing problems of deep <b>drilling</b> rigs are analyzed, and direct drive permanent magnet motor top-driving <b>drilling</b> rig and its parameters and characteristics are introduced. The development of deep borehole permanent-magnet motor direct drive top-driving <b>drilling</b> rig accords with the requirements of <b>drilling</b> technology development and innovation concept, it is the development direction of deep core <b>drill's</b> renewal, will promote the development of geo-drilling technology...|$|R
30|$|<b>Drilling</b> {{companies}} {{alter the}} composition of <b>drilling</b> fluids from water-based to oil-based to increase viscosity to enable <b>drilling</b> at deeper levels. However, {{it is difficult to}} collect original <b>drilling</b> fluid during the <b>drilling.</b> Furthermore, researcher seldom has the opportunity to assess <b>drilling</b> mud filtrates collected during the <b>drilling</b> operations. In addition, <b>drilling</b> fluids are normally re-used for several wells. It is thus important to consider changes of <b>drilling</b> fluid compositions during the <b>drilling</b> (Wenger et al. 2004). In this situation, the main advantage of the method proposed here is to use the oil-based <b>drilling</b> mud mixtures as indicators for determining the degree of contamination, as discussed in the next section.|$|R

40|$|Managed Pressure <b>Drilling</b> {{now at the}} {{pinnacle}} of the 'Oil Well Drilling' evolution tree, has itself been coined in 2003. It is an umbrella term for a few new <b>drilling</b> techniques and some preexisting <b>drilling</b> techniques, all of them aiming to solve several <b>drilling</b> problems, including non-productive time and/or <b>drilling</b> flat time issues. These techniques, now sub-classifications of Managed Pressure <b>Drilling,</b> are referred to as 'Variations' and 'Methods' of Managed Pressure <b>Drilling.</b> Although using Managed Pressure <b>Drilling</b> for <b>drilling</b> wells has several benefits, not all wells that seem a potential candidate for Managed Pressure <b>Drilling,</b> need Managed Pressure <b>Drilling.</b> The <b>drilling</b> industry has numerous simulators and software models to perform <b>drilling</b> hydraulics calculations and simulations. Most of them are designed for conventional well hydraulics, while some can perform Underbalanced <b>Drilling</b> calculations, and a select few can perform Managed Pressure <b>Drilling</b> calculations. Most of the few available Managed Pressure <b>Drilling</b> models are modified Underbalanced <b>Drilling</b> versions that fit Managed Pressure <b>Drilling</b> needs. However, none of them focus on Managed Pressure <b>Drilling</b> and its candidate selection alone. An 'Managed Pressure <b>Drilling</b> Candidate Selection Model and software' that can act as a preliminary screen to determine the utility of Managed Pressure <b>Drilling</b> for potential candidate wells are developed as a part of this research dissertation. The model and a flow diagram identify the key steps in candidate selection. The software performs the basic hydraulic calculations and provides useful results in the form of tables, plots and graphs that would help in making better engineering decisions. An additional Managed Pressure <b>Drilling</b> worldwide wells database with basic information on a few Managed Pressure <b>Drilling</b> projects has also been compiled that can act as a basic guide on the Managed Pressure <b>Drilling</b> variation and project frequencies and aid in Managed Pressure <b>Drilling</b> candidate selection...|$|R

Fuzzy ball <b>drilling</b> fluids {{have been}} {{developed}} in order to effectively control lost circulation during CBM <b>drilling.</b> Depending upon fuzzy balls and colloids in fuzzy balls, the fuzzy ball <b>drilling</b> fluids changed their shapes and properties to completely plug underground heterogeneous seepage channels so as to strengthen the pressure bearing capacity of formations. This paper describes the available features of the fuzzy ball <b>drilling</b> fluid including efficient plugging, good carrying and suspension, formation damage control, compatible weighted by any weighted materials without auxiliary equipment. The fuzzy ball <b>drilling</b> fluids can finish <b>drilling</b> in low pressure natural gas zone, control CBM leakage; control the natural fractures, <b>drilling</b> in different pressures in the same open hole, combination with the air <b>drilling</b> mode, etc. during Ordos CBM <b>drilling.</b> The fuzzy ball <b>drilling</b> fluid will not affect down-hole motors and MWD. The fuzzy ball <b>drilling</b> fluid will be blend simply as conventional water based <b>drilling</b> fluids. The existing CBM <b>drilling</b> equipment can completely meet the fuzzy ball <b>drilling</b> mixing and it is maintained conveniently.
