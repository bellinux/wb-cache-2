2500|$|The {{micaceous}} sandstones of Carmarthenshire's [...] Tilestones Formation were {{formerly worked}} to provide roofing material, as were similar <b>flaggy</b> sandstones elsewhere, {{at least until}} the burgeoning of the North Wales slate industry in the nineteenth century.|$|E
2500|$|Rocks of the {{earliest}} part of the Cambrian Period {{are found in the}} Salt range in Punjab and the Spiti are in central Himalayas and consist of a thick sequence of fossiliferous sediments. In the Salt range, the stratigraphy starts with the Salt Pseudomorph zone, which has a thickness of [...] and consists of dolomites and sandstones. It is overlain by magnesian sandstones with a thickness of , similar to the underlying dolomites. These sandstones have very few fossils. Overlying the sandstones is the Neobolus Shale, which is composed of dark shales with a thickness of [...] Finally there is a zone consisting of red or purple sandstones having a thickness of [...] to [...] called the Purple Sandstone. These are unfossiliferous and show sun-cracks and worm burrows which are typical of subaerial weathering. The deposits in Spiti are known as the Haimanta system and they consist of slates, micaceous quartzite and dolomitic limestones. The Ordovician rocks comprise <b>flaggy</b> shales, limestones, red quartzites, quartzites, sandstones and conglomerates. Siliceous limestones belonging to the Silurian overlie the Ordovician rocks. These limestones are in turn overlain by white quartzite and this is known as Muth quartzite. Silurian rocks which contain typical Silurian fauna are also found in the Vihi district of Kashmir.|$|E
5000|$|The Carson <b>Flaggies</b> {{earned a}} three-peat of wins at USA Nationals in both 1 and 2 Flag {{divisions}} in 2004, 2005 and 2006. They are the originators of twirling {{three and four}} flags. They were featured in Gwen Stefani's [...] "Hollaback Girl" [...] video in 2005.|$|R
5000|$|Pep Flags, {{also known}} as <b>flaggies,</b> short flags, small flags, or twirl flags is the {{performing}} art of twirling one or two flag(s) {{as part of a}} choreographed routine. In recent years, some schools have implemented a third and even fourth flag in routines. This performing art is mainly prominent in Southern California high schools in various school districts. It is mainly in high schools but a few are in elementary, middle school and college/university levels.|$|R
2500|$|The {{music video}} for [...] "Hollaback Girl" [...] was {{directed}} by Paul Hunter and filmed in the Van Nuys and Reseda neighborhoods of Los Angeles, California. The video opens with a scene of Stefani spending time with her Harajuku Girls, when a crowd of students appears. Stefani and the Harajuku Girls then drive down Sherman Way past Magnolia Science Academy to Birmingham High School in a 1961 Chevrolet Impala, accompanied by the crowd. Stefani and the group cause a commotion when they disrupt a football game by walking onto the field and {{when they go to}} a 99 Cents Only Store and throw cereal and other food products down an aisle. Throughout the video, there are intercut sequences of choreographed dancing filmed in a sound stage, intended to represent Stefani's imagination. Stefani and the Harajuku Girls are outfitted in cheerleading uniforms, accompanied by several Californian spirit groups: the Orange Crush All Stars, a cheerleading squad from Orange County; a marching band from Fountain Valley High School in Fountain Valley; a pep flag team named the Carson High School <b>Flaggies</b> from Carson; and a drill team from Stephen M. White Middle School in Carson. To visualize the song's bridge, the Harajuku Girls spell the word [...] "bananas" [...] with cue cards. The video ends with a close-up frame of Stefani with her arms in the air.|$|R
60|$|Pyr. Therefore {{the seasons}} Lie all confused; and, by the heavens neglected, Forget themselves: Blind winter meets the summer In his mid-way, and, seeing not his livery, Has driven him headlong back; and the raw damps, With <b>flaggy</b> wings, fly heavily about, Scattering their pestilential colds and rheums Through all the lazy air.|$|E
60|$|Beyond {{this the}} dusk giant said nothing; neither, for {{impairing}} the other's market, did there appear much need to. After eying the rude speaker {{a moment with}} an expression of mingled admiration and consternation, the company silently exchanged glances of mutual sympathy under unwelcome conviction. Those who had purchased looked sheepish or ashamed; and a cynical-looking little man, with a thin <b>flaggy</b> beard, and a countenance ever wearing the rudiments of a grin, seated alone in a corner commanding {{a good view of the}} scene, held a rusty hat before his face.|$|E
6000|$|Before {{the second}} {{north-eastern}} reach, the interpreters exclaimed [...] "Yellala falla"--"the cataract is speaking," [...] {{and we could}} distinctly hear the cheering roar. The stream now assumed the aspect of Niagara below the Falls, and the circular eddies boiling up from below, and showing distinct convexity, suggested the dangerous [...] "wells" [...] of the northern seas. Passing the [...] "Three Weird Sisters," [...] unimportant rocks off, the right bank, we entered upon the remarkably long stretch, extending upwards of five miles, and, from its predominating growth, we proposed to call it [...] "Palmyra Reach." [...] The immediate river banks were clad with sedge, and the broad leaves of the nymph√¶a, a plant like the calamus of Asia, but here used only as a toothpick, began to oust the rushy and <b>flaggy</b> growth of the lower bed. The pink balls of the spinous mimosa, and bright flowers, especially the convolvulus and ipomaea, illuminated the dull green. The grassy land {{at the foot of}} the mountains was a mere edging, faced by outlying rocks, and we were shown the site of a village long ago destroyed.|$|E
60|$|She {{was very}} oddly dressed; {{she was quite}} naked from her head to below her breasts; her breasts were plump and round, not <b>flaggy</b> and hanging down, as it {{generally}} is with the Indian women, some of whose breasts hang as low as their bellies, but projecting as beautifully {{as if they had}} been laced up with stays round her body; and below her breast she had a broad piece of a skin of some curious creature, spotted like a leopard, probably of some fine spotted deer. This was wrapped round her very tight, like a body-girt to a horse; and under this she had a kind of petticoat, as before described, hanging down to her ankles. As for shoes or stockings, they were only such as nature had furnished. Her hair was black, and, as supposed, very long, being wreathed up and twisted in long locks about the plate of gold she wore; for when she pulled off the plate above mentioned, it hung down her back and upon her shoulders very gracefully; but it seems she did not think so, for, as soon as she found it so fallen down, she caused one of her women to roll it up, and tie it in a great knot which hung down in her neck, and did not look so well as when it was loose.|$|E
5000|$|There are 3 sub-catchments areas, Little <b>Flaggy</b> Creek in the north, <b>Flaggy</b> Creek in {{the centre}} {{and a small}} unnamed creek in the southeast. Two of the main tributaries are, <b>Flaggy</b> Creek (approx 4 km in length) and Little <b>Flaggy</b> Creek (also shown on some maps as Glenrock Creek). On a Map of the Parish of Kahibah dated 1887, Little <b>Flaggy</b> Creek was named [...] "First <b>Flaggy</b> Creek" [...] and <b>Flaggy</b> Creek was known as [...] "Second <b>Flaggy</b> Creek".|$|E

50|$|In 1886 {{the main}} shaft was sunk to the Borehole seam and another shaft was also sunk to the Borehole seam at <b>Flaggy</b> Creek which was located {{approximately}} 1 mile to the east. The Borehole seam at <b>Flaggy</b> Creek was 10 ft thick, however due to unsuitable ground conditions at the surface the Waratah Coal Company was unable to construct railway sidings & loading facilities at this site so a 2120 yard long underground tunnel was driven between the <b>Flaggy</b> Creek shaft & Charles' Pit. Soon after this Charles' Pit was officially opened with a special train being run to the colliery on 25 November 1887.|$|E
