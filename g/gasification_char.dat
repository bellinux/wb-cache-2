40|$|Kinetics of {{woodchips}} char gasification {{has been}} examined. Steam and CO 2 {{were used as}} the gasifying agents. Differences and similarities between kinetics of steam gasification and CO 2 gasification have been discussed. Comparison was conducted in terms of gasification duration, evolution of reaction rate with time and/or conversion, and effect of partial pressure on reaction rate. Reactor temperature was maintained at 900 Â Â°C. Partial pressure of gasifying agents varied from 1. 5 bars to 0. 6 bars in intervals of 0. 3 bars. Steam and CO 2 flow rates were chosen so that both gasifying agents had equal amount of oxygen content. CO 2 gasification lasted for about 60 Â min while steam gasification lasted for about 22 Â min. The average reaction rate for steam gasification was almost twice that of CO 2. Both reaction rate curves showed a peak value at certain degree of conversion. For steam gasification, the reaction rate peak {{was found to be}} at a degree of conversion of about 0. 3. However, for CO 2 gasification the reaction rate peak was found to be at a conversion degree of about 0. 1. Reaction rates have been fitted using the random pore model (RPM). Average structural parameter, [psi] for steam gasification and CO 2 gasification was determined to be 9 and 2. 1, respectively. Average rate constant at 900 Â Â°C was 0. 065 Â min- 1 for steam gasification and 0. 031 Â min- 1 for CO 2 gasification. Change in partial pressure of gasifying agents did not affect the reaction rate for both steam and CO 2 gasification. <b>Gasification</b> <b>Char</b> <b>gasification</b> <b>Char</b> kinetics High temperature steam gasification Biomass Syngas production...|$|E

The temperature range investigated were 600 - 1000 Â Â°C in steps of 100 Â Â°C. Results have been obtained under pyrolysis conditions at same temperatures. For steam gasification runs, steam flow rate was kept constant at 8. 0 Â g/min. Investigated characteristics were evolution of syngas flow rate with time, hydrogen flow rate and chemical composition of syngas, energy yield and apparent thermal efficiency. Residuals from both processes were quantified and compared as well. Material destruction, hydrogen yield and energy yield is better with gasification as compared to pyrolysis. This advantage of the gasification process is attributed mainly to <b>char</b> <b>gasification</b> process. <b>Char</b> <b>gasification</b> is found to be more sensitive to the reactor temperature than pyrolysis.

40|$|EN] The {{combustion}} of coal {{can result}} in trace elements, such as mercury, being released from power stations with potentially harmful effects for both {{human health and the}} environment. Research is ongoing to develop cost-effective and efficient control technologies for mercury removal from coal-fired power plants, the largest source of anthropogenic mercury emissions. A number of activated carbon sorbents have been demonstrated to be effective for mercury retention in coal combustion power plants. However, more economic alternatives need to be developed. Raw biomass <b>gasification</b> <b>chars</b> could serve as low-cost sorbents for capturing mercury since they are sub-products generated during a thermal conversion process. The aim {{of this study was to}} evaluate different biomass <b>gasification</b> <b>chars</b> as mercury sorbents in a simulated coal combustion flue gas. The results were compared with those obtained using a commercial activated carbon. Chars from a mixture of paper and plastic waste showed the highest retention capacity. It was found that not only a high carbon content and a well developed microporosity but also a high chlorine content and a high aluminium content improved the mercury retention capacity of biomass <b>gasification</b> <b>chars.</b> No relationship could be inferred between the surface oxygen functional groups and mercury retention in the char samples evaluated.

This study combines selective oxidation, analytical pyrolysis, and sulfur X-ray Absorption Near Edge Structure Spectroscopy (XANES) analysis. Samples with a wide variety of sulfur contents, (0. 63 % [...] 4. 40 %) have been prepared for use in this study. This includes steam <b>gasification</b> <b>chars,</b> oxidized coals and desulfurized coals as well of the original unaltered coals. Mild pyrolysis and XANES data shows that the sulfur chemistry of <b>gasification</b> <b>chars</b> is significantly different from that of the original coals. Mild pyrolysis of the samples that were oxidized with peroxyacetic acid showed that the level of simple thiophene structures observed in the pyrolysis products declines with increasing levels of oxidation. Sulfur XANES spectra of treated samples showed various effects depending on the treatment severity. The XANES spectra of less severely treated samples were similar, although not identical, to the untreated coal spectra. XANES of <b>gasification</b> <b>chars</b> indicated conversion of pyrite to pyrrhotite, removal of organic sulfide sulfur and dissolution of soluble inorganic sulfur species during gasification. Mild oxidation with peroxyacetic acid results in preferential oxidation of sulfide forms before thiophene forms but increasing oxidation severity leads to virtually all sulfur species being oxidized. Good agreement between W-band EPR and XANES data for aromatic sulfur contents were obtained. The TPR analysis of coal indicated that organic sulfur was present as alkyl-aryl sulfide, aryl-aryl sulfides, simple thiophenes and condensed thiophenes. TPR shows that non-thiophenic compounds are removed by PAA oxidation, and that the longer the oxidation is performed the greater is the removal of non-thiophenic sulfur structures...|$|R

The CEC values correlate well with the increase in the ratios of the oxygen atoms to the carbon atoms (O:C ratios) in the biochar materials. The higher O:C ratio was consistent with the presence of more hydroxyl, carboxylate, and carbonyl groups in the fast pyrolysis char. These results show how control of biomass pyrolysis conditions can improve biochar properties for soil amendment and carbon sequestration. Since the CEC of the fast-pyrolytic cornstover char can be about double that of a standard soil sample, this type of biochar products would be suitable for improvement of soil properties such as CEC, and at the same time, can serve as a carbon sequestration agent...|$|E

In the prior study, IBC- 105 coal with 4. 0 wt % sulfur was converted to chars with less than 1. 0 wt % sulfur in a laboratory-scale batch reactor. The susceptibility of the char to desulfurization was correlated with physicochemical char properties and mild gasification conditions.

Gasification was more beneficial than pyrolysis based on investigated criteria, but longer time was needed to finish the gasification process.

Inorganic constituents of food char {{were found to have}} a catalytic effect. Char reactivity increased with increased degree of conversion. In the conversion range from 0. 1 to 0. 9 the increase in reactivity was accompanied by an increase in pre-exponential factor, which suggested an increase in gasifying agent adsorption rate to char surface.

40|$|In {{the context}} of {{thermochemical}} conversion of solid fuels in dual fluidized bed (DFB) reactors, oxygen carrier bed materials {{have been found to}} enhance the rate of char <b>gasification.</b> <b>Char</b> gasification is typically the rate limiting step in the conversion process, which plays a role on the performance of the overall process and constrains the design of the reactor. The quantity of oxygen carried by the bed material in relation to the fuel feeding rate is likely to influence char conversion. This parameter is commonly characterized in literature by the oxygen-carrier-to-fuel ratio (ϕ), and it can be adjusted by either varying the fuel feed and/or the circulation rate of bed material in the DFB. The residence time of the fuel is typically altered by these changes, which results in an unclear role of the oxygen-carrier-to fuel ratio on the final char conversion. The present work investigates the impact of oxygen transport on char conversion in the 2 - 4 MWth DFB gasifier at Chalmers University of Technology. An iron ore is used as oxygen carrier and steam as fluidizing agent. A parametric study is conducted, in which a wide range of oxygen-carrier-to-fuel ratio (ϕ= 3 - 12) are achieved by varying fuel flow and bed material circulation. Char conversion is calculated on the basis of gas analysis and mass balance calculations. The results confirm that oxygen transport enhances char conversion, in line with previous research in smaller units.

40|$|International audienceGasification {{provides}} {{a mechanism to}} convert solids, such as biomass, coal, or waste, into fuels {{that can be easily}} integrated into current infrastructure. This paper discusses the use of residual char from a biomass gasifier as a catalyst for tar decomposition and presents an investigation of the catalytic properties of the char. Poplar wood was gasified in a fluidized bed reactor at temperatures ranging from 550 to 920 degrees C in reaction environments of 90 % steam/ 10 % N- 2 and 90 % N- 2 / 10 % CO 2. The properties of the char recovered from the process were analyzed, and the catalytic performance for hydrocarbon cracking reactions was tested. Brunauer-Emmett-Teller (BET) measurements showed that the surface area of the char was higher than conventional catalyst carriers. The surface area, which ranged from 429 to 687 m(2) g(- 1) increased with temperature and reaction time. The catalytic activity of the char was demonstrated through testing the catalytic decomposition of methane and propane to produce H- 2 and solid carbon. Higher char surface area resulted in increased performance, but pore size distribution also affected the activity of the catalyst, and evidence of diffusion limitations in microporous char was observed. Clusters of iron were present {{on the surface of the}} char. After being used for catalytic applications, carbon deposition was observed on the iron cluster and on the pores of the char, indicating that these sites may influence the reaction. When the char was heated to 800 degrees C in an inert (N- 2), atmosphere mass loss was observed, which varied based on the type of char and the time. ESEM/EDX showed that when char was heated to 1000 degrees C under N- 2, oxygen and metals migrated to the surface of the char, which may impact its catalytic activity. Through investigating the properties and performance of biomass <b>gasification</b> <b>char,</b> this paper demonstrates its potential to replace expensive tar decomposition catalysts with char catalysts, which are continuously produced on-site in the gasification process...|$|E

The <b>char</b> <b>gasification</b> rate in the experiments with the manganese minerals tested was higher than the corresponding values for ilmenite and iron ore, which were taken as benchmark materials.

Under these conditions, one of the materials presented higher <b>char</b> <b>gasification</b> rates than those observed for benchmark materials even when most of the K was already released. An estimation of the CO 2 capture efficiency in a continuous unit using one of the selected manganese minerals showed that around 99 % CO 2 capture efficiency could be reached at 1000 °C with a solid inventory in the fuel reactor as low as 300 kg/MWth if an efficient carbon stripper was present.

40|$|The {{objective}} of this thesis is to experimentally investigate the performance of steam <b>gasification</b> of <b>chars</b> of pure coal (lignite, sub-bituminous), pure biomass (radiata pine, eucalyptus nitens) and their blends. The influences of gasification temperature, types of coal and biomass, coal-biomass blending ratio, alkali and alkaline earth metal (AAEM) in lignite, on specific gasification characteristics (producer gas composition and yield, char reactivity) were studied. In addition, synergistic effects in co-gasification of coal-biomass blend char were also investigated. This project is in accordance with objectives of the BISGAS Consortium. In this study, experiments were performed in a bench-scale gasifier at gasification temperatures of 850 °C, 900 °C and 950 °C, respectively. Two types of coals (lignite and sub-bituminous) and two kinds of biomass (radiata pine and eucalyptus nitens) from New Zealand were selected as sample fuels. From these raw materials, the chars with coal-to-biomass blending ratios of 0 : 100 (pure coal), 20 : 80, 50 : 50, 80 : 20 and 100 : 0 (pure biomass), which were derived through the devolatilization at temperature of 900 °C for 7 minutes, were gasified with steam as gasification agent. During the gasification tests, the producer gas composition and gas production were continuously analysed using a Micro gas chromatograph. When the gas production was undetectable, the gasification process {{was assumed to be}} completed and the gasification time was recorded. The gasification producer gas consisted of three main gas components: hydrogen (H 2), carbon monoxide (CO) and carbon dioxide (CO 2). The results from <b>gasification</b> of <b>chars</b> of individual solid fuels (coal or biomass) confirmed that biomass <b>char</b> <b>gasification</b> was faster than coal <b>char</b> <b>gasification.</b> The influences of gasification temperatures were shown as: when gasification temperature increased, the H 2 yield increased in coal <b>char</b> <b>gasification</b> but decreased in biomass <b>char</b> <b>gasification.</b> In the meantime, CO yields increased while CO 2 yields decreased in both coal char and biomass <b>char</b> <b>gasification.</b> In addition, the char reactivity of all the pure fuel samples increased with elevated gasification temperatures. The results from co-gasification of coal-biomass blend char exhibited that the syngas production rate, which is defined as the total gas production divided by the gasification completion time, was enhanced by an increase in gasification temperatures as well as an increase in the biomass proportion in the blend. The AAEM species played a significant catalytic role in both gasification of pure coal chars and co-gasification of coal-biomass blend chars. The presence of AAEM increased the producer gas yield and enhanced the char reactivity. The positive synergistic effects of the coal-biomass blending char on syngas production rate only existed in the co-gasification of lignite-eucalyptus nitens blend chars.

In the present work the effects of pyrolysis temperature, total pressure and CO₂ concentration on the <b>gasification</b> of biomass <b>chars</b> have been studied using the thermogravimetric approach. The chars were obtained by pyrolysis in a drop tube furnace reactor at temperatures of 1000 and 1400 °C. The gasification tests were carried out in a pressurized thermogravimetric analyser (PTGA) at different temperatures, pressures and CO₂ concentrations. The reactivity measurements were conducted under the kinetically controlled regime, and three nth-order kinetic models as well as the Langmuir–Hinshelwood model were applied to determine the kinetic parameters...|$|R
40|$|Most industrially {{important}} carbons {{are produced}} from naturally occurring {{materials such as}} coal, oil, peat or wood by some form of thermal process. Chars are obtained from those natural materials as a residue after removal of the volatile matter. Chars (prepared from coal or other organic precursors) are non-graphitizable carbons, meaning that they cannot be transformed into graphitic carbon. Chars are comprised of elementary crystallites in parallel layers which are randomly {{oriented with respect to}} each other and are crosslinked together through weak bonds. Voids between crystallites determine the porosity of the char, and this {{plays an important role in}} <b>char</b> <b>gasification</b> behavior. <b>Chars</b> usually contain a pore size distribution, in which the larger macro- and mesopores play an important role in transport of reactants into the much smaller micropores, in which most gasification and combustion take place. Therefore, the effectiveness of micropores in gasification depends heavily on the numbers of meso- and macropores...|$|R

40|$|The chemical-looping {{combustion}} (CLC) {{process is}} a novel solution for efficient combustion with direct capture of carbon dioxide. The process uses a metal oxide as an oxygen carrier to transfer oxygen from an air to a fuel reactor, where the fuel reacts with the solid oxygen carrier. In this work, six different manganese ores are investigated as oxygen carriers for CLC application. The chemical-looping characteristics of the oxygen carriers were evaluated in a laboratory-scale fluidized-bed reactor in the temperature range of 900 - 970 oC during alternating reducing and oxidizing conditions. Three of the manganese ores showed a small oxygen release in inert environment between 850 and 950 oC. During reactivity tests, the gas yield with methane increased with the temperature and complete conversion of 50 % CO in H 2 was obtained {{for all of the}} ores. The rates of <b>char</b> <b>gasification</b> of two fuels, namely Mexican petroleum coke and Swedish wood char, were compared for the different manganese ores at 970 oC and with 50 % H 2 O in N 2 as fluidizing gas. Ilmenite and a manufactured Mn-oxide oxygen carrier consisting of Mn 3 O 4 and MgO-stabilized ZrO 2 as support were also included for comparison. The <b>char</b> <b>gasification</b> rate and the gas conversion were higher with the manganese ores and the Mn-oxide oxygen carrier compared to ilmenite. However, the higher reactivity of the manganese ores with H 2 and the ensuing decrease in H 2 inhibition for manganese ores is not sufficient to explain their higher rate of <b>char</b> <b>gasification.</b> Surface analysis of partially gasified petcoke particles in the presence of manganese ores showed formation of cavities and channels as well as a uniform distribution of potassium and sodium elements. The rate of <b>char</b> <b>gasification</b> also increased with the concentration of potassium and sodium impurities in the manganese ores. Thus the results suggest that the increased rate of char conversion for manganese ores is due to alkali-catalyzed steam gasification. The increase in rate of <b>char</b> <b>gasification,</b> in combination with potentially low costs of these materials suggests that manganese ores could be interesting materials for CLC with solid fuels...|$|R
