40|$|The {{research}} {{represents the}} natural {{working out of}} an early interest in the unauthorized building phenomenon in Italy. The initial target was to record, in geographical viewpoint, the current situation of illegal building trade and outlines a typological map. During the analysis, the trend has been shown the impossibility to act in that meaning. Given the particular distribution of unauthorized building work has appeared essential, however, {{to make it more}} accessible knowledge. When going to find a different interpretation of unauthorized, was reached, however, the existence of a present geography of weak build, which would affect the entire sector of building in Italy, not just illegal. Make manifest these geographies has therefore become the main objective of the research. For this purpose it is made of a model capable of bringing the multiple illustrative cases of building activity encountered on national territory. The basis of the new method, the deepening of the gap between the norm and society, the gap between society and politics, the distinction between legality and illegality. The analysis is divided into four phases. The first part is reconstructed theoretical framework from a geographical point of view. After summarizing {{the state of the art}} achieved by observing geographical unauthorized building, are shown what appear to the actual facts of the matter. After re-defined areas of research and expanded the system problematic, are exposed to the purposes and methods, anticipating the paradigm which is believed to follow. It is in the later stages that embodies the concept of "building weak. " The purpose is to highlight, in relation to the three parameters up to standard-society-nature (terms properly contextualized), the variation of the profile of weakness act to construct in Italy. The second part dealt with the issue of illegal building trade. In addition of inner considerations to the phenomenon, it is shown that in some cases the illicit action, normally weak, be supported by the various plaintiffs through plausible social and / or environmental reasons. To substantiate the different kind of fragility, the study of specific case studies identified in the country. In the third phase, the object becomes more properly the weak house. After an extensive review of the main moments regulatory planning, has been proved as well as the constructive action lawful, normally strong, is sometimes weakened by names and / or environmental. After this exposure in detail the relevant examples, useful to investigate the area of gray placed on the border of legality and legitimacy. In the fourth part, first to bring the reflection terms as much as possible to anticipate some conclusive and prospects of development of research, <b>it</b> <b>shall</b> <b>indicate</b> the main exit routes discernible so far. This work starts a new approach regarding the consideration of geographic territorializing agents, currently the most practiced. Attempts to shed light on some aspects little considered in the evaluation principles planners.
