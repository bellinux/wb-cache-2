25|$|However, chromatographic {{methods for}} {{separation}} started being {{adopted in the}} early 1980s. Developments were ongoing in the time period between when Cohn fractionation started being used, in 1946, and when chromatography started being used, in 1983. In 1962, the Kistler & Nistchmann process was created which was a spin-off of the Cohn process. Chromatographic processes {{began to take shape}} in 1983. In the 1990s, the Zenalb and the CSL Albumex processes were created which incorporated chromatography with a few variations. The general approach to using chromatography for plasma fractionation for albumin is: recovery of supernatant I, delipidation, anion exchange chromatography, cation exchange chromatography, and <b>gel</b> <b>filtration</b> chromatography. The recovered purified material is formulated with combinations of sodium octanoate and sodium N-acetyl tryptophanate and then subjected to viral inactivation procedures, including pasteurisation at 60°C. This is a more efficient alternative than the Cohn process for four main reasons: 1) smooth automation and a relatively inexpensive plant was needed, 2) easier to sterilize equipment and maintain a good manufacturing environment, 3) chromatographic processes are less damaging to the albumin protein, and 4) a more successful albumin end result can be achieved. Compared with the Cohn process, the albumin purity went up from about 95% to 98% using chromatography, and the yield increased from about 65% to 85%. Small percentage increases make a difference in regard to sensitive measurements like purity. There is one big drawback in using chromatography, which {{has to do with the}} economics of the process. Although the method was efficient from the processing aspect, acquiring the necessary equipment is a big task. Large machinery is necessary, and for a long time the lack of equipment availability was not conducive to its widespread use. The components are more readily available now but it is still a work in progress.|$|E
500|$|Calitoxin is {{a highly}} potent neurotoxin {{produced}} by the sea anemone Calliactis parasitica, which is stored in the nematocysts of stinging cells (cnidocytes). [...] This sea anemone is a species from the Hormathiidae family and is present along the European coasts of the Atlantic Ocean and in the Mediterranean Sea. [...] The name calitoxin {{is derived from the}} organism from which the toxin was isolated. The toxin was isolated by a team of researchers in Naples, Italy from animals collected in the Bay of Naples. [...] The team isolated the polypeptide through a series of centrifugations until the supernatant had lost toxic activity. [...] The resulting pellet was purified using the techniques liquid chromatography, <b>gel</b> <b>filtration,</b> and chromatofocusing. [...] The team then sequenced the purified polypeptide chain. [...] They also published details on the toxin's effects in vitro on crustacean tissue preparations, including nerve and muscle. [...] Their findings were published in the journal Biochemistry in 1989.|$|E
2500|$|Size-exclusion {{chromatography}} (SEC), {{also known}} as gel permeation chromatography or <b>gel</b> <b>filtration</b> chromatography, separates particles {{on the basis of}} molecular size (actually by a particle's Stokes radius). It is generally a low resolution chromatography and thus it is often reserved for the final, [...] "polishing" [...] step of the purification. It is also useful for determining the tertiary structure and quaternary structure of purified proteins. SEC is used primarily for the analysis of large molecules such as proteins or polymers. SEC works by trapping these smaller molecules in the pores of a particle. The larger molecules simply pass by the pores as they are too large to enter the pores. Larger molecules therefore flow through the column quicker than smaller molecules, that is, the smaller the molecule, the longer the retention time.|$|E
50|$|Electrochromatography is a {{chemical}} separation technique in analytical chemistry, biochemistry and molecular biology used to resolve and separate mostly large biomolecules such as proteins. It {{is a combination}} of size exclusion chromatography (<b>gel</b> <b>filtration</b> chromatography) and gel electrophoresis. These separation mechanisms operate essentially in superposition along the length of a <b>gel</b> <b>filtration</b> column to which an axial electric field gradient has been added. The molecules are separated by size due to the <b>gel</b> <b>filtration</b> mechanism and by electrophoretic mobility due to the gel electrophoresis mechanism. Additionally there are secondary chromatographic solute retention mechanisms.|$|E

50|$|Dialysis {{is useful}} {{for many of the}} same {{desalting}} and buffer exchange applications performed with <b>gel</b> <b>filtration</b> chromatography, as both methods are based on similar molecular weight cut-off limits. <b>Gel</b> <b>filtration</b> has the advantage of speed (a few minutes vs. hours for dialysis), though, along with the ability to remove contaminants from relatively small-volume samples compared to dialysis, an important feature when working with toxic or radioactive substances. Dialysis, on the other hand, is much less dependent on sample size as related to device format. For dialysis applications, achieving a high percentage sample recovery and molecule removal is generally straight forward with little optimization. For <b>gel</b> <b>filtration</b> applications it is important to select a column size and format that is suitable for your sample.|$|E
50|$|Desalting and buffer {{exchange}} are {{methods to}} separate soluble macromolecules from smaller molecules (desalting) or replace the buffer system used for another one {{suitable for a}} downstream application (buffer exchange).

Desalting and buffer exchange are two of the most common <b>gel</b> <b>filtration</b> chromatography applications, and they can be performed using the same resin.|$|E

50|$|The assay is {{performed}} by incubating the protein with a radiolabelled ligand of the protein for {{30 minutes at}} a given temperature, then quench on ice, run through a <b>gel</b> <b>filtration</b> mini column, and quantify the radiation levels of the protein that comes off the column. The radioligand concentration is high enough to saturate the protein. Denatured protein is unable to bind the radioligand and the protein and radioligand will be separated in the <b>gel</b> <b>filtration</b> mini column. When screening mutants selection {{will be for the}}rmal stability in the specific conformation, i.e. if the radioligand is an agonist selection will be for the agonist binding conformation and if it is an antagonist then the screening is for stability in the antagonist binding conformation.|$|E

Apamin was separated from the other compounds by <b>gel</b> <b>filtration</b> and ion exchange chromatography.|$|E
5000|$|Agarose is {{a useful}} {{material}} for chromatography {{because it does not}} absorb biomolecules to any significant extent, has good flow properties, and can tolerate extremes of pH and ionic strength as well as high concentration of denaturants such as 8M urea or 6M guanidine HCl.
