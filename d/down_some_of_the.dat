5|$|In {{the late}} Middle Ages, the {{increasing}} wealth of middle class merchants and traders meant that commoners began emulating the aristocracy, {{and threatened to}} break <b>down</b> <b>some</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> symbolic barriers between the nobility and the lower classes. The response came in two forms: didactic literature warning {{of the dangers of}} adapting a diet inappropriate for one's class, and sumptuary laws that put a cap on the lavishness of commoners' banquets.|$|E

He then comes across Beric Dondarrion and Thoros of Myr, who are {{preparing}} to hang the men responsible for {{the attack on the}} village. Sandor bargains with Beric, who allows him to personally hang two of the men. Beric and Thoros try to recruit Sandor into the Brotherhood, explaining that they intend to head north to fight the White Walkers and need his strength.|$|E
5|$|After landing, Young and Duke began {{powering}} <b>down</b> <b>some</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> LM's {{systems to}} conserve battery power. Upon completing their initial adjustments, the pair configured Orion for their three-day {{stay on the}} lunar surface, removed their space suits and took initial geological observations of the immediate landing site. They then settled down for their first meal on the surface. After eating, they configured the cabin for their first sleep period on the Moon. The landing delay caused by the malfunction in the Command/Service Module's main engine necessitated significant modifications to the mission schedule. Apollo 16 would spend one less day in lunar orbit after surface exploration had been completed to afford the crew contingency time to compensate for any further problems and to conserve expendables. In order to improve Young's and Duke's sleep schedule, {{the third and final}} moonwalk of the mission was trimmed from seven hours to five.|$|E

5|$|Hamilton {{regarded}} the second Pittsburgh convention {{as a serious}} threat to the operation of the laws of the federal government. In September 1792, he sent Pennsylvania tax official George Clymer to western Pennsylvania to investigate. Clymer only increased tensions with a clumsy attempt at traveling in disguise and attempting to intimidate local officials. His somewhat exaggerated report greatly influenced the decisions made by the Washington administration. Washington and Hamilton viewed resistance to federal laws in Pennsylvania as particularly embarrassing, since the national capital was then located in the same state. On his own initiative, Hamilton drafted a presidential proclamation denouncing resistance to the excise laws and submitted it to Attorney General Randolph, who toned <b>down</b> <b>some</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> language. Washington signed the proclamation on September 15, 1792, and it was published as a broadside and printed in many newspapers.|$|E
5|$|Sawyer {{found himself}} {{at odds with}} the Democratic {{organization}} on some occasions, most prominently on amendments to the city charter. In 1956, charter amendments aimed at weakening civil service protections were proposed. Sawyer had campaigned against the idea and refused to go along with them. Even without his support, the amendments found the required two-thirds vote in Council to make it on to the ballot for popular approval. The Pennsylvania Supreme Court struck <b>down</b> <b>some</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> amendments, and the rest failed in a referendum that April. Such disagreements led the Democratic City Committee to withhold their endorsement of Sawyer for a second term in 1959, and he retired from elected office to return to his law practice. In 1965, while serving as president of the southeastern Pennsylvania chapter of the Americans for Democratic Action, Sawyer led a group of Democrats who endorsed Republican Arlen Specter for district attorney of Philadelphia.|$|E

25|$|Since 2003, Slovenian {{authorities}} {{have attempted to}} rectify this discrimination by introducing a two day training programme on policing in a multi-ethnic community. The programme involved teaching police about Roma culture and their language which served to break <b>down</b> <b>some</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> stereotypes that caused tension. The Roma were made aware of their rights, and the police were educated about national and international standards regarding treatment of minorities. The programme involved teaching police about Roma culture and their language which served to break <b>down</b> <b>some</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> stereotypes that caused tension.

25|$|These strikes were qualitatively {{different}} from those waged over union recognition in the 1930s: employers {{did not try to}} hire strikebreakers to replace their employees, while the unions kept a tight lid on picketers to maintain order and decorum even as they completely shut <b>down</b> <b>some</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> largest enterprises in the United States.|$|E

25|$|The union, {{like most}} other United States {{construction}} unions, had remained nearly all-white {{for most of its}} history. That began to change in the early 1960s, as the American civil rights movement began to challenge employment discrimination in the north, then picked up steam in the 1970s as the federal government began using the Civil Rights Act of 1964 to knock <b>down</b> <b>some</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> barriers to African-American workers' entry into the industry. Some local unions of the Iron Workers fought integration and affirmative action tenaciously, but usually unsuccessfully.|$|E

25|$|However, the {{launching}} of balloons has provoked North Korea to threaten activists by warning that it would shell the areas with balloon launches. In October 2014, the North Korean border guards' attempt to shoot <b>down</b> <b>some</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> balloons led to a firefight due to North Korean shots landing near a South Korean military base and a residential area. A North Korean spy was arrested in 2011 and {{accused of trying to}} assassinate balloon campaign activist Park Sang-hak. In 2014, a North Korean agent posing as a defector was arrested for reportedly attempting to assassinate Choi Jung-hoon, another activist involved in the balloon drops and the commander of the North Korean People's Liberation Front. Jin-Heon Jung points out that the DMZ has become more militarized in recent years. The balloons may contribute to a decay of the remaining cooperation between the Korean governments; activists have been blamed of eagerly trying to destroy any cooperation between the governments.|$|E
25|$|In 1645 the Roundheads, {{now under}} the command of Major Phillip Lower, were chased off by a large {{contingent}} of Royalist cavalry, under Lord Goring. Goring's force however was not strong enough to hold the town and so withdrew, allowing Lower's troops to return. A few days later Goring returned with a larger force of some 1000 men. Lower now only had 200 men but had made efforts to bolster the town's defences and had pulled <b>down</b> <b>some</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> buildings to increase the field of fire from his guns. Despite this the Royalists were able to occupy the town, driving the defenders back into the castle and the church. As Goring lacked the large calibre weapons required to destroy the two structures, the attackers settled down to a siege. A few days later however, news reached Goring that Parliamentarian reinforcements were on their way from Lymington and having already suffered heavy losses, he made the decision to withdraw.|$|E

25|$|With great difficulty, Lafaille {{managed to}} climb down the 75 degree {{face to the}} pair's last bivouac site, where he found 20 metres of thin rope, {{allowing}} him to make short abseils <b>down</b> <b>some</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> hardest parts.

He finally reached what should have been the relative safety of the top of a fixed rope which he and Beghin had installed on a steep rock band, but almost immediately he was struck by a falling rock, which broke his right arm. Disabled and helpless, he lay on a ledge for two days in the hope that other climbers would rescue him. However, while there was a Slovenian team attempting a route on {{a different part of the}} South Face, they judged that a rescue attempt would be too dangerous to undertake, so help never came. The cruellest thing about the ordeal, Lafaille said, was being able to see life in the valley below, and by night, the flashbulbs of trekkers' cameras. In spite of this, he later agreed that the Slovenians had made the right decision in not trying to save him.|$|E

The site proved to be an excellent one; an old, dry riverbed with soil largely composed of gravel. A gravel base and steel plank was laid to accommodate the fighters based at Tsili Tsili that were in danger of bogging down when the weather deteriorated. By the end of October there were four airstrips at Nadzab, one of which was [...] long and sealed with bitumen.|$|E
