All of these things {{operating}} in synchronicity: like ringtones, flat-screens, theater, cuisine, fashion, sushi. I don't {{want to call it}} [...] "virtual reality," [...] so I call it Far Side Virtual. If you really want to understand Far Side, first off, listen to [...] Debussy, and secondly, go into a frozen yogurt shop. Afterwards, go into an Apple store and just fool around, hang out in there. Afterwards, go to Starbucks and get a gift card. They have a book there on the history of Starbucks—buy this book and go home. If you <b>do</b> <b>all</b> <b>these</b> things you'll understand what Far Side Virtual is — because people kind of live in it already.|$|E
500|$|Made-up stories did not {{exclusively}} comprise Animaniacs writing, as Hastings remarked: [...] "We weren't really there to tell compelling stories... {{you could do}} a real story, you could recite the Star-Spangled Banner, or you could parody a commercial... you could <b>do</b> <b>all</b> <b>these</b> kinds of things, and we had this tremendous freedom and a talent to back it up." [...] Writers for the series wrote into Animaniacs stories that happened to them; the episodes [...] "Ups and Downs," [...] "Survey Ladies," [...] and [...] "I Got Yer Can" [...] were episodes based on true stories that happened to Rugg, Deanna Oliver, and Stoner, respectively. Another episode, [...] "Bumbie's Mom," [...] both parodied the film Bambi and was a story based on Stoner's childhood reaction to the film.|$|E
500|$|When {{designing}} Ares, Charlie Wen {{was advised}} {{that the character}} should be 90% elemental and 5–10% human, then began sketching. He said {{that the rest of}} the team liked the designs, but were uncertain about execution. The transition towards Ares' human form was slow, and Wen said of the final design, [...] "he's still a huge guy, but he's got all this armor on that allows him to <b>do</b> <b>all</b> <b>these</b> things." [...] Like most of the Olympian gods in God of War, Zeus first appeared as a floating translucent head, and was modeled on the typical representation of the god in Greek mythology. Cory Barlog (Game Director of God of War II) said that for God of War II, they wanted to maintain Zeus' appearance from literature, but also to add their own interpretation to the character. Zeus' human appearance was originally designed by Charlie Wen for God of War II. This design was also used in God of War III, with updated graphics and the addition of an arm piece during the final fight. Andy Park was responsible for designing Zeus' spirit form for the final fight. Park produced several sketches, and imagined Zeus as a [...] "massive tornado creature with lightning searing throughout the form." [...] Park said that the ultimate goal was that [...] "we are looking at Zeus, but it is him transformed into a big cloud of smoke." ...|$|E

[...] While not a true Christian comic book as its emphasis is not on directly calling readers to repentance or propagating the faith but on superheroes utilizing Christian imagery and on Christian-based speculative fiction, Warrior Nun Areala takes its idea very seriously.|$|E

Thicke was unable to rejoin the cast for the shooting of the second season, opting instead to focus on his music.

[...] "If in fact I created a culture where people were going after each other, then how did we <b>do</b> <b>all</b> <b>these</b> things together with Republicans and Democrats?" [...] Christie asked during a Brick, New Jersey town hall meeting. [...] The Star-Ledger editorial board answered that Richard Nixon had cut deals with Democrats, but had still abused power; and that despite Christie's early bipartisanship, he has thrown himself into several partisan standoffs; and that his personal style had always been [...] "vindictive and aggressive"; and concluded that Christie [...] "created the culture that inspired" [...] the lane closures.|$|E

2500|$|At {{the first}} Deputies Committee meeting on {{terrorism}} held in April 2001, Clarke strongly {{suggested that the}} U.S. put pressure on both the Taliban and Al-Qaeda by arming the Northern Alliance and other groups in Afghanistan. Simultaneously, that they target bin Laden and his leadership by reinitiating flights of the MQ-1 Predators. To which Deputy Secretary of Defense Paul Wolfowitz responded, [...] "Well, I just don't understand why we are beginning by talking about this one man bin Laden." [...] Clarke replied that {{he was talking about}} bin Laden and his network because it posed [...] "an immediate and serious threat to the United States." [...] According to Clarke, Wolfowitz turned to him and said, [...] "You give bin Laden too much credit. He could not <b>do</b> <b>all</b> <b>these</b> things like the 1993 attack on New York, not without a state sponsor. Just because FBI and CIA have failed to find the linkages does not mean they don't exist." ...|$|E
2500|$|Nina {{was very}} much {{involved}} in {{the whole process of}} producing the album that she had to give up several television appearances, which included dropping out of her ASAP group and segment entitled the Sessionistas. She explained [...] "Umalis po ako sa ASAP dahil nagprepare po talaga ako sa album. At nasasabay sa mga out of town and out of the country na shows. [...] " [...] She kept a close watch from the album's conceptualization to its songs and arrangement, and even the paper dolls inside the album was her own idea. To be able to <b>do</b> <b>all</b> <b>these</b> things, she had to temporarily disappear in the scene for a while. Production for the album took nearly two years to finish, making people wonder if she had gone out of the music industry for good. In choosing a title for the album, Nina personally decided to call it Stay Alivecoming from the album's second track, [...] "Staying Alive"to remind the people that she is still very much around, in spite of the hiatus on TV, and the long break from the recording scene. She further explained the origin of the title: ...|$|E
2500|$|In the 2nd century CE, the Christian theologian Marcion {{composed}} a work (now lost) entitled Antithesis. In the Antithesis, Marcion {{set out in}} detail and discussed at length the contradictions between the Old Testament and New Testament. The Old and New Testaments, Marcion argued, cannot be reconciled to each other. The code of conduct advocated by Moses was [...] "an eye for an eye", but [...] Marcion pointed to Isaiah 45:7 [...] "I make peace and create evil, I the Lord <b>do</b> <b>all</b> <b>these</b> things. He contrasted this with Jesus' saying that [...] "a tree was known by its fruit, a good tree cannot bring forth evil fruit" [...] and then pointed to several injunctions and lessons in the Old Testament that the New Testament contradicts. For example, Elisha had children eaten by bears; Jesus said, [...] "Let the little children come to me". Joshua had the sun stopped in order to prolong the slaughter of his enemies. Paul quoted Jesus as commanding [...] "Let not the sun go down on your wrath"(Eph 4:26). In the Old Testament, divorce was permitted and so was polygamy; in the New Testament, neither is allowed. Moses enforced the Jewish Sabbath and Jewish Law; Jesus has de-institutionalised both. Even within the Old Testament, Marcion found contradictions. For example, [...] God commanded that no work should {{be done on the}} Sabbath, yet he told the Israelites to carry the ark around Jericho seven times on the Sabbath. No graven image was to be made, yet Moses was directed to fashion a bronze serpent. Marcion therefore rejected the entire Old Testament.|$|E

2500|$|Chapter 8 of tractate Yoma in the Mishnah and Babylonian Talmud and chapter 4 of tractate Kippurim (Yoma) in the Tosefta {{interpreted}} {{the laws of}} self-denial in [...] and [...] The Mishnah taught that on Yom Kippur, one must not eat, drink, wash, anoint oneself, put on sandals, or have sexual intercourse. Rabbi Eliezer (whom the halachah follows) taught that a king or bride may wash the face, and a woman after childbirth may put on sandals. But the sages forbad doing so. The Tosefta taught that one must not put on even felt shoes. But the Tosefta taught that minors can <b>do</b> <b>all</b> <b>these</b> things except put on sandals, for appearance's sake. The Mishnah held a person culpable to punishment for eating an amount of food equal to a large date (with its pit included), or for drinking a mouthful of liquid. For the purpose of calculating the amount consumed, one combines all amounts of food together, and all amounts liquids together, but not amounts of foods together with amounts of liquids. The Mishnah obliged one who unknowingly or forgetfully ate and drank to bring only one sin-offering. But one who unknowingly or forgetfully ate and performed labor had to bring two sin-offerings. The Mishnah did not hold one culpable who ate foods unfit to eat, or drank liquids unfit to drink (like fish-brine). The Mishnah taught that one should not afflict children at all on Yom Kippur. In the two years before they become Bar or Bat Mitzvah, one should train children to become used to religious observances (for example by fasting for several hours). The Mishnah taught that one should give food to a pregnant woman who smelled food and requested it. One should feed to a sick person {{at the direction of}} experts, and if no experts are present, one feeds a sick person who requests food. The Mishnah taught that one may even give unclean food to one seized by a ravenous hunger, until the person's eyes are opened. Rabbi Matthia ben Heresh said that one who has a sore throat may drink medicine even on the Sabbath, because it presented the possibility of danger to human life, and every danger to human life suspends the laws of the Sabbath.|$|E
