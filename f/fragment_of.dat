5|$|Appeals {{from the}} local people led to the Crown agreeing in July 1402 to build an earthen rampart and towers to protect the settlement. The site of these early defences is not known but may have been near where St Catherine's Church now stands. A ditch of unknown date in that {{vicinity}} may represent a <b>fragment</b> <b>of</b> the medieval defences.|$|E
5|$|In 2007, a {{single-storey}} {{building from}} the 1950s was demolished on Grey Friars Street giving archaeologists {{the opportunity to}} excavate and search for traces of the medieval friary. Very little was unearthed, except for a <b>fragment</b> <b>of</b> a post-medieval stone coffin lid. The results of the dig suggested that {{the remains of the}} friary church were farther west than previously thought.|$|E
5|$|Numerical {{simulations}} {{show that}} there is a 0.41 probability that the moon Halimede collided with Nereid at some time in the past. Although it is not known whether any collision has taken place, both moons appear to have similar ("grey") colors, implying that Halimede could be a <b>fragment</b> <b>of</b> Nereid.|$|E
50|$|Archaeologists often {{classify}} sherds by {{the part}} of the ceramic vessel from which the sherd came. For example, sherds may be categorized as rim sherds, body sherds, and/or base sherds. Rim sherds are <b>fragments</b> <b>of</b> a vessel's rim, while base sherds are <b>fragments</b> <b>of</b> the vessel's base. Body sherds are <b>fragments</b> <b>of</b> ceramic that are not identified as rim sherds or base sherds. Other categories might include <b>fragments</b> <b>of</b> handles or lids.|$|R

50|$|It is {{a useful}} and {{necessary}} term because, especially when initially found in archaeological excavation, {{it may be difficult}} to distinguish, for example, <b>fragments</b> <b>of</b> bricks from <b>fragments</b> <b>of</b> roofing or flooring tiles. However, ceramic building materials are usually readily distinguishable from <b>fragments</b> <b>of</b> ceramic pottery by their rougher finish.|$|R
5|$|Prior to 1 September 2009, the University of the Arts London PhD student, Nikolas Sarris, {{discovered}} the previously unseen <b>fragment</b> <b>of</b> the Codex {{in the library}} of Saint Catherine's Monastery. It contains the text of Book of Joshua 1:10.|$|E
5|$|Accounts of how bin Laden {{was located}} by U.S. {{intelligence}} differ. The White House and CIA director John Brennan {{stated that the}} process began with a <b>fragment</b> <b>of</b> information unearthed in 2002, resulting in years of investigation. This account states that by September 2010, these leads followed a courier to the Abbottabad compound, where the U.S. began intensive multiplatform surveillance. According to journalist Seymour Hersh and NBC News, however, the U.S. was tipped off about bin Laden's location by a Pakistani intelligence officer who offered details of where the Pakistani Intelligence Service held him in detention {{in exchange for a}} bounty.|$|E
5|$|Arana's support {{began to}} be {{solicited}} by the landed elite, who felt threatened by Arévalo's reforms. Arana, who was not initially inclined {{to get involved with}} politics, began to make occasional statements against the government. In the 1948 parliamentary election, he backed a number of opposition candidates, all of whom were defeated. By 1949 the National Renovation Party and the PAR were both openly hostile to Arana, while a small <b>fragment</b> <b>of</b> the Popular Liberation Front split off to support him. The leftist parties decided to back Árbenz instead, as they believed that only a military officer could defeat Arana.|$|E
50|$|The {{surviving}} text of Matthew are verses 11:25-30, {{they are}} in a fragmentary condition. It contains also <b>fragments</b> <b>of</b> Book of Daniel 3:51-53 and Odae (Papyrus 994 Rahlfs). Survived <b>fragments</b> <b>of</b> 13 leaves.|$|R
40|$|AbstractIn {{the first}} part of this paper, we prove that there are {{continuously}} many <b>fragments</b> <b>of</b> intuitionistic propositional calculus (IpC) which fail to have the interpolation property, thereby extending a result of J. I. Zucker. Our proof makes use of the Rieger-Nishimura lattice. The second part is devoted to transferring this result to <b>fragments</b> <b>of</b> classical predicate calculus (CPC) : this is done by giving a translation T <b>of</b> <b>fragments</b> <b>of</b> IpC in <b>fragments</b> <b>of</b> CPC which preserves the interpolation property...|$|R

5|$|By careful examination, the {{luminosity}} {{was found}} to proceed from the gills and not the stipe, nor from any <b>fragment</b> <b>of</b> rotten wood attached to the specimen. This phosphoresence was not observed in all specimens brought in for examination, and seemed to depend on some peculiar condition of the air, having been noticed only in specimens gathered in damp weather or just before a storm.|$|E
5|$|<b>Fragment</b> <b>of</b> a Crucifixion is a 1950 canvas by the Irish-born, English figurative painter Francis Bacon, {{housed in}} the Stedelijk Van Abbemuseum, Eindhoven. The {{painting}} shows two animals engaged in brutal struggle. The upper figure, which may be a dog or a cat, crouches over a chimera and is {{at the point of}} kill. It stoops on the horizontal beam of a T-shaped structure, which may signify Christ's cross. The painting contains thinly sketched passer-by figures, who seem oblivious to the central drama.|$|E
5|$|From the Iron Age {{there are}} more {{extensive}} examples of patterned objects and gold work. Evidence of the wider La Tène culture includes the Torrs Pony-cap and Horns. The Stirling torcs demonstrate common styles found in Scotland and Ireland and continental workmanship. One {{of the most impressive}} items from this period is the boar's head <b>fragment</b> <b>of</b> the Deskford carnyx. From the first century CE, as Rome carried out a series of occupations, there are Roman artifacts like the Cramond Lioness and Roman influence on material culture can be seen in local stone carvings.|$|E
40|$|This {{publication}} presents {{materials from}} a closed {{complex in the}} "ashpit" no. 13 of the Western Bilsk fortified settlement. In the filling {{of one of the}} pits there were found 285 <b>fragments</b> <b>of</b> antique amphorae. Among them it was possible to identify <b>fragments</b> <b>of</b> 13 Klazomenian amphorae and one Milesian amphora. We divided all <b>fragments</b> <b>of</b> rims belonging to the Klazomenian amphorae into 3 variants. In our opinion, all the considered <b>fragments</b> <b>of</b> amphorae could find the closest analogies among the vessels of the 1 st half of the 6 th century BC...|$|R

5|$|Further south, near Mount St. Helens, is {{a similar}} situation, where the St. Helens Fault Zone (SHZ) is {{believed}} to be the eastern edge of the Crescent Formation, but the pre-Cenozoic continental basement is near Mount Rainier. Separating these is the marine sedimentary formation known as the Southern Washington Cascades Conductor (SWCC); it is possible that it was deposited over a <b>fragment</b> <b>of</b> Siletzia. Or not: the oldest parts of the SWCC likely predate Siletzia, and the nature and location of the contact between these two formations is unknown.|$|E
5|$|Heinrich Kreutz {{studied the}} orbits of the three great comets, and {{developed}} {{the idea that the}} three comets were fragments of a much larger progenitor comet which had broken up at an earlier perihelion passage. The fragmentation of the Great Comet of 1882 itself demonstrated that this was plausible. It is now thought that the Great Comet of 1882 is a <b>fragment</b> <b>of</b> X/1106 C1, and that Comet du Toit (C/1945 X1) and Comet Ikeya–Seki (C/1965 S1) are two of its sister fragments.|$|E
5|$|In the 2000s, some {{possible}} close relatives of Ferugliotherium were discovered. An enigmatic tooth from the Paleogene of Peru, LACM 149371, {{was described in}} 2004 as possibly related to the family Ferugliotheriidae. Kielan-Jaworowska and colleagues described a p4 from the La Colonia Formation (Late Cretaceous of Argentina) as a new multituberculate genus, Argentodites, in 2007, but Gurovich and Beck noted close similarities between this p4 and the p4 in the possible jaw <b>fragment</b> <b>of</b> Ferugliotherium and suggested that it represented Ferugliotherium or a closely related species. A single mf1 from the Allen Formation (Late Cretaceous of Argentina) was described as another ferugliotheriid genus, Trapalcotherium, in 2009.|$|E

5|$|Northeast Minnesota has 2700-million-year-ago exposed rocks formed during {{volcanic}} activity {{that was in}} the form of seepage of lava from rifts in the sea floor. These lava flows began to rise up out of the ancient ocean to form the Superior craton; the Superior craton later assembled into the Canadian shield, which became part of the North American craton. The Superior province is the largest preserved <b>fragment</b> <b>of</b> Archean crust, and the Canadian shield is the nucleus of the North American craton.|$|E
