500|$|Foster {{talked about}} Hannibal in an {{interview}} with Total Film in late 2005. She said: [...] "The official reason I didn't do Hannibal is I was doing another movie, Flora Plum. So I get to say, in a nice dignified way, that I wasn't available when that movie was being shot... Clarice meant so much to Jonathan and I, she really <b>did,</b> <b>and</b> <b>I</b> know it sounds kind of strange to say {{but there was no way}} that either of us could really trample on her." ...|$|E
500|$|... "Because" [...] was {{inspired}} by Lennon listening to Ono playing Ludwig van Beethoven's [...] "Moonlight Sonata" [...] on the piano. He recalled he was [...] "lying on the sofa in our house, listening to Yoko play... Suddenly, I said, 'Can you play those chords backward?' She <b>did,</b> <b>and</b> <b>I</b> wrote 'Because' around them." [...] The track features three-part harmonies by Lennon, McCartney and Harrison, which were then triple-tracked to give nine voices in the final mix. The group considered the vocals to {{be some of the}} hardest and most complex they attempted. Harrison played the Moog synthesizer, and Martin played the harpsichord that opens the track.|$|E
500|$|A Wall Street billionaire {{placed under}} house arrest for {{stealing}} $2billion. On his character, Alda said [...] "Shaw is sometimes described as a Bernie Madoff-like character. I'm not sure. I don't think anyone has ever operated on the scale that Madoff <b>did.</b> <b>And</b> <b>I</b> don't know if what Shaw did technically qualifies as a Ponzi scheme. But in that Shaw was willing to steal money from people who really needed it who really couldn't afford to lose it and willing to take everything they had…yes, he's in Bernie territory, with both feet." [...] Ratner initially approached Robert Redford to play the role, being a fan of {{his work in the}} heist film The Hot Rock, but Redford turned him down.|$|E

500|$|According to Moss, Peggy [...] "has the {{capability}} of being a Don Draper, and there can't be {{two of them in}} the office." [...] The goodbye scene between Don and Peggy was a difficult one to shoot. Moss said, [...] "That scene was a really, really tough scene to do. They didn't tell me {{they were going to do}} this, but they told Jon to hold my hand and not let it go. Then he <b>did,</b> <b>and</b> <b>I</b> lost it. Every single one of those tears were absolutely real. She wants to stay with all of her heart. She does not want to leave, but she knows she has to." [...] Hamm said there was [...] "respect, understanding, and admiration between those two characters. This is the exact right time for her to leave." ...|$|E
500|$|... "Cocktails" [...] {{was written}} by Paul Lieberstein, who plays Human Resources {{representative}} Toby Flenderson on the series. Lost series creator J. J. Abrams was hired on as episode director, his first such credit for the series. Abrams disliked the American series when it first premiered, due to his love for the original British series. The director explained, [...] "I resented it before I saw it, because I thought, 'well, {{how are you going}} to do what Ricky and Steve did. In fact, the first season I didn't get into it at all. In the second season, they really found their voice. And that's despite having to make 22 episodes, which is twice the length of what the BBC show <b>did.</b> <b>And</b> <b>I</b> thought that the show became brilliant. I was really impressed by how it worked." ...|$|E
500|$|Kohli {{was raised}} in Uttam Nagar and started his {{schooling}} at Vishal Bharti Public School. In 1998, the West Delhi Cricket Academy was created, and Kohli, a nine-year-old, was part of its first intake. Kohli's father {{took him to the}} academy after their neighbours suggested that [...] "Virat shouldn't waste his time in gully cricket and instead join a professional club". Kohli trained at the academy under Rajkumar Sharma and also played matches at the Sumeet Dogra Academy at Vasundhara Enclave at the same time. Sharma recounts Kohli's early days at his academy, [...] "He oozed talent. It was so difficult to keep him quiet. He was a natural in whatever he <b>did</b> <b>and</b> <b>I</b> was most impressed with his attitude. He was ready to bat at any spot, and I had to literally push him home after the training sessions. He just wouldn’t leave." [...] In ninth grade, he shifted to Savier Convent in Paschim Vihar to help his cricket practice. Apart from sports, Kohli was good at academics as well, and his teachers remember him as [...] "a bright and alert child". Kohli's family lived in Meera Bagh until 2015 when they moved to Gurgaon.|$|E

500|$|... "You do {{appreciate}} {{the absurdity of}} a group of rabbis in Israel claiming that I'm being blasphemous about someone when they haven't heard the record, right? And then, everyone in the media runs with it as if it's the truth. And that's a little weird. But what's even weirder is that the song is not about Isaac Lurier, as the rabbis claim. It's named after Yitzhak Sinwani, who's singing in Yemenite on the track. I couldn't think of a title for the song. So I called it [...] "Isaac" [...] It's interesting how their minds work, those naughty rabbis. [...] He's saying, [...] "If all of the doors of all of the generous peoples' homes are closed to you, the gates of heaven will always be open." [...] The words are about 1,000 years old. [...] is an old friend of mine. He's never made a record. He comes from generations of beautiful singers. Stuart and I asked him to come into the studio one day. We said, [...] "We're just going to record you. We don't know what we're going to do with it." [...] He's flawless. One take, no bad notes. He doesn't even need a microphone. We took one of the songs he <b>did</b> <b>and</b> <b>I</b> said to Stuart, [...] "Let's sample these bits. We'll create a chorus and then I'll write lyrics around it." [...] That's how we constructed it." ...|$|E
500|$|While {{media reports}} {{initially}} suggested that Abhishek Bachchan was being considered {{to portray the}} role of Vijay Chauhan, director Karan Malhotra approached Hrithik Roshan for the role. Roshan, however was sceptical on taking up a role earlier played by Amitabh Bachchan and agreed to star in the film only after months of deliberation. He said, [...] "The script had so much passion that I felt very emotional and I {{made up my mind}} to do it". [...] On casting Hrithik, Malhotra explained, [...] "Hrithik has the charm of a boy and the attitude of a man. Also, he has a certain vulnerability, which I was looking in my characterisation of Vijay Dinananth Chauhan." [...] While explaining the character of Vijay Chauhan, Malhotra added, [...] "Nobody can play Vijay the way Amitabh Bachchan <b>did,</b> <b>and</b> <b>I</b> would have wanted my Vijay to be subtle even if it wasn't Hrithik. I wanted the negative characters in my film to be bigger. This made Hrithik's victory seem bigger." [...] In preparation for the film, Roshan did not look up Bachchan's performance in the original for inspiration, as he considered his role to be completely different. Roshan, however, faced several difficulties while filming. He suffered from a severe back injury, which caused him considerable pain, throughout the shooting schedule. In an interview with Filmfare he quoted, [...] "Agneepath is the hardest I’ve ever worked in my life. I didn’t know what the film had in store for me. I’ve never been so tired in my life. I have exhausted my body completely." ...|$|E
500|$|While {{calling into}} WVEE during their {{interview}} with Ciara and Polow da Don, Hilson said, [...] "I {{just want to}} tell Ciara it’s not about you. People are just reading way too far into it. People take things and make it what they want it to be. It wasn’t taking shots at nobody." [...] I just want to let Atlanta know and Ciara know that this is a true leak. I <b>did,</b> <b>and</b> <b>I</b> don't know if Polow said this on the radio, but I did fight this coming out. I didn't want this coming out because we played it for people when I did it and that's what people said it was about; they started throwing out names. We were like 'No, it's not about that' and we tried to let them know what it was really about. But the fact that people brought back names, it was like ok, that wasn't the reaction we need, so I told Polow, 'let's not do this and he agreed". Ciara happened to call in during the time period and said she was happy of where Hilson was at in her career, to which Hilson responded the same, saying how proud she was, and [...] "watching her from ground zero." [...] Hilson went on to state she was not jealous of anyone's career, noting how all female R artists are the same, pointing out that [...] "Keyshia’s on my album. I’ve worked with Ciara many times. I’m a fan of Beyoncé’s." [...] When asked exactly who the song is about, Hilson said the targets knew who they were, responding, [...] "It’s anybody that ever tried to take me down and didn’t want to see me succeed. I’m not gonna call their names because I feel I’ve addressed it." [...] She further clarified, commenting [...] "I will say this, my journey has been 12 years long and there have been many people, specifically girls, and it really just isn't one person, it's been a lot of people." ...|$|E

2500|$|On May 17, 2007, Berger relinquished {{his license}} to {{practice}} law {{as a result of}} the Justice Department investigation.

While I derived great satisfaction from years of practicing law, I have not done so for 15 years and do not envision returning to the profession. I am very sorry for what I <b>did,</b> <b>and</b> <b>I</b> deeply apologize." [...] By giving up his license, Berger avoided cross-examination by the Bar Counsel regarding details of his thefts.|$|E
2500|$|After the game, the umpire, Hoagland of Princeton, praised Michigan's {{blocking}} (then {{known as}} interference): [...] "If {{you can tell}} me how you are going to break such a perfect interference, four men running ahead of the man with the ball on end runs without allowing Michigan to make a score, I would like to know how it is done." [...] Michigan's trainer, Keene Fitzpatrick, filled in for Yost as the on-field coach against Iowa. After the game, Fitzpatrick noted:"I think our team-work today was fine. The men certainly have the right spirit. Coach Yost hated to go away. ... The last thing he said to me was, 'Keene, just before they go into the game, give them a good talk.' Well, I guess they <b>did,</b> <b>and</b> <b>I</b> am proud of them." ...|$|E
2500|$|Although {{he might}} by today's terms {{be called a}} seamer, back then Shaw was {{fundamentally}} a length bowler, holding a line on or just outside the off-stump: certainly, he often employed the off-theory, {{with as many as}} eight fielders patrolling the offside. His run-up was made up of six rapid, economical steps, but, according to the man himself, [...] "I really used to bowl faster than people thought I <b>did,</b> <b>and</b> <b>I</b> could make the ball break both ways, but not much. In my opinion, length and variation of pace constitute the secret of successful bowling." [...] However, although he was regarded almost universally as [...] "the high priest of length", he and Ted Peate together poured scorn all over suggestions that they were capable of [...] "hitting the spot" [...] with nearly every delivery (as was the common perception).|$|E

2500|$|... "Call Me When You're Sober" [...] had {{a limited}} radio release {{as the first}} single off The Open Door on July 31, 2006. This was {{followed}} by a wider release in the following week. Since the track leaked onto the Internet two days before its scheduled release to radio airplay, the band's record label Wind-up Records allowed radio stations to play the single ahead of schedule. Subsequently, the recording was made available for digital download on September 4, 2006, and a physical release as a single followed on September 25. Rumors began to surface that Wind-up was responsible for the track's selection as the album's first single, which Lee denied in a post on the band's then-active fansite Evboards.com: [...] "Wind up didn't choose this single- I <b>did,</b> <b>and</b> <b>I</b> had to fight for it. I love this song. Also, they didn't change anything about it. This is the way we made it. We fought over the guitar part but eventually just got the mix right." ...|$|E
2500|$|At {{one point}} Lazarus threw Ruetten a {{surprise}} party on his 25th birthday, unaware {{that he had}} been dating other women or that he had developed a serious relationship with Rasmussen. When she learned he was seriously involved with Rasmussen, she was despondent. [...] "I'm truly in love with John and the past year has really torn me up," [...] she wrote to Ruetten's mother in August 1985. [...] "I wish it didn't end the way it <b>did,</b> <b>and</b> <b>I</b> don't think I'll ever understand his decision." [...] In her own journal, she wrote [...] "I really don't feel like working. I found out that John is getting married." [...] She visited him at his condo, depressed, and the two had sex—"to give her closure", Ruetten testified years later—for what Ruetten says was the only time before Rasmussen's death. Later that night she awoke a fellow officer she roomed with to commiserate.|$|E
2500|$|In 2005, amid {{reports that}} Pitt and Aniston's divorce {{was due to}} Aniston's refusal to have {{children}} with Pitt, Aniston stated to Vanity Fair, [...] "I've {{never in my life}} said I didn't want to have children. I <b>did</b> <b>and</b> <b>I</b> do and I will... I would never give up that experience for a career." [...] Aniston also revealed that her divorce prompted her to reach out to her mother, Nancy, from whom she was estranged for nearly a decade. They initially became estranged when Nancy talked about her daughter on a television show and later wrote a book entitled, From Mother and Daughter to Friends: A Memoir (1999). Aniston has also stated she was devastated by the death of her longtime therapist, whose work helped make her separation from Pitt easier. Aniston said her relationship with Pitt, which she does not regret, was [...] "seven very intense years together" [...] and that [...] "it was a beautiful, complicated relationship".|$|E

2500|$|In November 2013, Schoolboy Q {{expressed}} he {{felt there}} were no more gangsta rappers. In an interview, Schoolboy Q discussed his status as a gangsta rapper: [...] "I'm not one of them rappers that's scared to put a title on their name," [...] Schoolboy Q said during an interview with MTV." [...] Conscious rappers never like to be called conscious rappers and a lyrical rapper never like to be a party rapper. I'm a gangsta rapper, that's who I am. I happen to make fun records at the same time, that's what I do. I joke, I bag on niggas, my personality is like that, but I am a gangsta rapper and that's what I'm gonna bring to the table." [...] During the interview, Schoolboy Q then added that gangsta rappers are nowhere to be found today: [...] "There's no more gangsta rappers. It's just trap music now. So I wanna get that old feeling back that I do naturally. I'm not necessarily trying to bring gangsta rap back. I'm just trying to let you know it's still here and I'm a part of it. I feel like I'm the only one out of the coast that's doing this gangsta rap shit the way that it used to be done...how niggas used to put detail in their music, not just going to the club and turning up." [...] Schoolboy Q said {{that he is going to}} bring that style in Oxymoron: [...] "I'm just telling my story and what I grew up around and what I seen and what I <b>did</b> <b>and</b> <b>I</b> wanna put that in the light instead of everybody just smiling. Like Eminem said, 'Whatever happened to wildin' out and being violent? / Whatever happened to catchin a good-ol' fashioned passionate ass-whoopin' and getting your shoes coat and your hat tooken?' [...] "I'm one of them niggas," [...] Schoolboy Q continued. [...] "Whatever happened to that? I don't want niggas to get beat up or no shit like that, but at the end of the day, that is a part of life and I like that type of music. That's what pushed West Coast music to where it was at like when Dre, Snoop and all them...Dogg Pound. That's what they was doin' and that's what they was talking about and that's what I was raised off of." ...|$|E
