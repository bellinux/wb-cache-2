A cutter which extends below the bottom surface, or sole, of the plane slices off shavings of wood. A large, flat sole on a plane guides the cutter to remove only the highest parts of an imperfect surface, until, after several passes, the surface is flat and smooth. When used for flattening, bench planes with longer soles are preferred for boards with longer longitudinal dimensions. A longer sole registers against a greater portion of the board's face or <b>edge</b> <b>surface</b> which leads to a more consistently flat surface or straighter edge. Conversely, using a smaller plane allows for more localized low or high spots to remain.|$|E

Furthermore, the results show that, for this notorious natural hydrophobic clay, all <b>edge</b> <b>surfaces</b> show hydrophilic behavior and that the precise structure of water above these surfaces is influenced by both the presence of hydroxyl groups and under-coordinated surface Al atoms; this will impact both geological processes where natural clays are involved and processes where such clays act as primary retention barriers to the dispersion of contaminants...|$|R

40|$|AbstractHybrid laser-arc welding of thick-section steel {{requires}} {{high power}} lasers, appropriate process parameters, and alternative techniques for obtaining deeper penetration.

40|$|X-ray {{photoelectron}} spectroscopy (XPS) {{has been}} used to study the surface composition and chemistry of Long Duration Exposure Facility (LDEF) exposed materials including silvered Teflon (Ag/FEP), Kapton, S 13 GLO paint, quartz crystal monitors (QCM's), carbon fiber/organic matrix composites, and carbon fiber/Al Alloy composites. In each set of samples, silicones were the major contributors to the molecular film accumulated on the LDEF exposed surfaces. All surfaces analyzed have been contaminated with Si, O, and C; most have low levels (less than 1 atom percent) of N, S, and F. Occasionally observed contaminants included Cl, Na, K, P, and various metals. Orange/brown discoloration observed near vent slots in some Ag/FEP blankets were higher in carbon, sulfur, and nitrogen relative to other contamination types. The source of contamination has not been identified, but amine/amide functionalities were detected. It is probable that this same source of contamination account for the low levels of sulfur and nitrogen observed on most LDEF exposed surfaces. XPS, which probes 50 to 100 A in depth, detected the major sample components underneath the contaminant film in every analysis. This probably indicates that the contaminant overlayer is patchy, with significant areas covered by less that 100 A of molecular film. Energy dispersive x-ray spectroscopy (EDS) of LDEF exposed surfaces during secondary electron microscopy (SEM) of the samples confirmed contamination of the surfaces with Si and O. In general, particulates were not observed to develop from the contaminant overlayer on the exposed LDEF material surfaces. However, many SiO 2 submicron particles were seen on a masked edge of an Ag/FEP blanket. In some cases such as the carbon fiber/organic matrix composites, interpretation of the contamination data was hindered by the lack of good laboratory controls. Examination of laboratory controls for the carbon fiber/Al alloy composites showed that preflight contamination was the most significant factor for all the contaminants generally detected at less than 1 atom percent, or detected only occasionally (i. e., all but Si, O, and C). Flight control surfaces, including sample backsides not exposed to space radiation or atomic oxygen flux, have accumulated some contamination on flight (compared to laboratory controls), but experimentally, the LDEF exposed surface contamination levels are generally higher for the contaminants Si and O. For most materials analyzed, Si contamination levels were higher on the leading <b>edge</b> <b>surfaces</b> than on the trailing <b>edge</b> <b>surfaces.</b> This was true even for the composite samples where considerable atomic oxygen erosion of the leading <b>edge</b> <b>surfaces</b> was observed by SEM. It is probable that the return flux associated with atmospheric backscatter resulted in enhanced deposition of silicones and other contaminants on the leading <b>edge</b> flight <b>surfaces</b> relative to the trailing edge. Although the Si concentration data suggested greater on-flight deposition of contaminants on the leading <b>edge</b> <b>surfaces,</b> the XPS analyses did not conclusively show different relative total thicknesses of flight deposited contamination for leading and trailing <b>edge</b> <b>surfaces.</b> It is possible that atomic oxygen reactions on the leading edge resulted in greater volatilization of the carbon component of the deposited silicones, effectively 'thinning' the leading edge deposited overlayer. Unlike other materials, exposed polymers such as Kapton and FEP-type Teflon had very low contamination on the leading <b>edge</b> <b>surfaces.</b> SEM evidence showed that undercutting of the contaminant overlayer and damaged polymer layers occurred during atomic oxygen erosion, which would enhance loss of material from the exposed surface...|$|R

The heterogeneity of four kaolinites (two low-defect and two high-defect samples) modified on their surface by cation exchange with Li+, Na+, or K+ was studied by DIS {{analysis of the}} derivative argon adsorption isotherms. The comparison between the derivative adsorption isotherms shows {{that the nature of}} the surface cation influences the adsorption phenomena on edge and basal faces. In the case of basal faces, two adsorption domains are observed: for the first one, argon adsorption is slightly sensitive {{to the nature of the}} surface cation; for the second one, argon adsorption energy depends on the nature of surface cation suggesting their presence on theoretically uncharged basal faces. This study also shows that the shape of elementary particles, as derived from basal and <b>edge</b> <b>surface</b> areas, changes with the nature of cation. This anomalous result is due to the decrease of <b>edge</b> <b>surface</b> area with increasing the size of the cation.

40|$|Abstract—Using first-principles molecular-dynamics simulations, {{probable}} inner-sphere complexes of Fe 2 + adsorbed on the <b>edge</b> <b>surfaces</b> of {{clay minerals}} were investigated. Ferrous ions are important reductants in natural processes and their properties {{can be altered}} significantly by complexation on <b>edge</b> <b>surfaces</b> of clay minerals. However, the microscopic picture of adsorption sites and structures of Fe 2 + is difficult to reveal with modern experimental techniques and, therefore, remains unclear. From the results of first-principles molecular-dynamics simulations, evidence has been provided that complexes on:SiO sites were the most stable forms, which should {{be responsible for the}} experimentally observed pH-dependent uptake. Such complexation was found to be strong enough to distort the local coordination structures of Si-O tetrahedra in the substrate.

40|$|ABSTRACT: We {{introduce}} a nonbonded three-body harmonic potential energy term for Mg−O−H interactions for improved <b>edge</b> <b>surface</b> stability in molecular simulations. The new potential term {{is compatible with}} the Clayff force field and is applied here to brucite, a layered magnesium hydroxide mineral. Comparisons of normal mode frequencies from classical and density functional theory calculations are used to verify a suitable spring constant (k parameter) for the Mg−O−H bending motion. Vibrational analysis of hydroxyl librations at two brucite surfaces indicates that surface Mg−O−H modes are shifted to frequencies lower than the corresponding bulk modes. A comparison of DFT and classical normal modes validates this new potential term. The methodology for parameter development can be applied to other clay mineral components (e. g., Al, Si) to improve the modeling of <b>edge</b> <b>surface</b> stability, resulting in expanded applicability to clay mineral applications.
