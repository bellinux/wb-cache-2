5|$|One {{application}} of this principle arises in a <b>film</b> <b>projector.</b> In this application, {{it is necessary to}} advance the film in a jerky, stepwise motion, in which each frame of film stops for {{a fraction of a second}} in front of the projector lens, and then much more quickly the film is moved to the next frame. This can be done using a mechanism in which the rotation of a Reuleaux triangle within a square is used to create a motion pattern for an actuator that pulls the film quickly to each new frame and then pauses the film's motion while the frame is projected.|$|E

5|$|In 1913, Edison {{introduced}} a new cylinder-based synch-sound apparatus known, just like his 1895 system, as the Kinetophone; instead of films being shown to individual viewers in the Kinetoscope cabinet, they were now projected onto a screen. The phonograph was connected by an intricate arrangement of pulleys to the <b>film</b> <b>projector,</b> allowing—under ideal conditions—for synchronization. However, conditions were rarely ideal, and the new, improved Kinetophone was retired after {{little more than a}} year. By the mid-1910s, the groundswell in commercial sound motion picture exhibition had subsided. Beginning in 1914, The Photo-Drama of Creation, promoting Jehovah's Witnesses' conception of mankind's genesis, was screened around the United States: eight hours worth of projected visuals involving both slides and live action were synchronized with separately recorded lectures and musical performances played back on phonograph.|$|E
5|$|Parallel with {{improvements}} in sound-on-film technology, {{a number of}} companies were making progress with systems that recorded movie sound on phonograph discs. In sound-on-disc technology from the era, a phonograph turntable is connected by a mechanical interlock to a specially modified <b>film</b> <b>projector,</b> allowing for synchronization. In 1921, the Photokinema sound-on-disc system developed by Orlando Kellum was employed to add synchronized sound sequences to D. W. Griffith's failed silent film Dream Street. A love song, performed by star Ralph Graves, was recorded, as was a sequence of live vocal effects. Apparently, dialogue scenes were also recorded, but the results were unsatisfactory and the film was never publicly screened incorporating them. On May 1, 1921, Dream Street was re-released, with love song added, at New York City's Town Hall theater, qualifying it—however haphazardly—as the first feature-length film with a live-recorded vocal sequence. There would be no others for more than six years.|$|E
25|$|On {{the evening}} of 28 December 1895, Méliès {{attended}} a special private demonstration of the Lumière brothers' cinematograph, given for owners of Parisian houses of spectacle. Méliès immediately offered the Lumières 10,000 for one of their machines; the Lumières refused, anxious to keep a close control on their invention and to emphasize the scientific nature of the device. (For the same reasons, they refused the Musée Grévin's 20,000 bid and the Folies Bergère's 50,000 bid the same night.) Méliès, intent on finding a <b>film</b> <b>projector</b> for the Théâtre Robert-Houdin, turned elsewhere; numerous other inventors in Europe and America were experimenting with machines similar to the Lumières' invention, albeit at a less technically sophisticated level. Possibly acting on a tip from Jehanne d'Alcy, who may have seen Robert W. Paul's Animatograph <b>film</b> <b>projector</b> while on tour in England, Méliès traveled to London. He bought an Animatograph from Paul, {{as well as several}} short films sold by Paul and by the Edison Manufacturing Company. By April 1896, the Théâtre Robert-Houdin was showing films as part of its daily performances.|$|E

The wall that separated the building from the Tomorrowland corridor was a large stained-glass mural featuring 22 famous inventors and visionaries. Also featured was the Timekeeper's study, library, and laboratory. The pre-show area also featured a 20-foot model of Da Vinci's Heliocentric Solar System, the Nautilus from Verne's 20,000 Leagues Under the Sea, the Albatross from Verne's The Clipper of the Clouds, a real 1920s <b>film</b> <b>projector</b> from Walt Disney Pictures, and an actual copy of Verne's novel, 20,000 Leagues Under the Sea.

25|$|The {{history of}} cinema in Germany {{can be traced}} back to the years shortly after the medium's birth. On November 1, 1895 Max Skladanowsky and his brother Emil {{demonstrated}} their self-invented <b>film</b> <b>projector</b> the Bioscop at the Wintergarten music hall in Berlin. A 15-minute series of eight short films, it was the first screening of films to a paying audience in Europe. This performance pre-dated the first paying public display of the Lumière brothers' Cinematographe in Paris on December 28 of the same year, a performance that Max Skladanowsky attended and at which he was able to ascertain that the Cinematographe was technically superior to his Bioscop. Other German film pioneers included the Berliners Oskar Messter and Max Gliewe, two of several individuals who independently in 1896 first used a Geneva drive (which allows the film to be advanced intermittently one frame at a time) in a projector, and the cinematographer Guido Seeber.|$|E

500|$|Limbo {{graphical}} {{and audio}} presentation were considered by reviewers as exceptional and powerful {{elements of the}} game. The monochrome approach, coupled with film grain filter, focusing techniques and lighting, were compared to both film noir and dreamlike tableaus of silent films, allowing the visual elements of the game to carry much of the story's weight. Cian Hassett of PALGN likened the effect to watching the game through an old-fashioned <b>film</b> <b>projector</b> that creates [...] "one of the most unsettling and eerily beautiful environments" [...] in video gaming. Garrett Martin of the Boston Herald compared the art style and game design decisions to German Expressionism with [...] "dreamlike levels that twist and spin in unexpected angles". The art style itself was praised as minimalistic, and considered reminiscent {{of the art of}} Lotte Reiniger, Edward Gorey, Fritz Lang, and Tim Burton. The use of misdirection in the visuals was also praised, such as by using silhouettes to avoid revealing {{the true nature of the}} characters or shadows, or by showing human figures across a chasm who disappear once the player crossed the chasm.|$|E

2500|$|On December 18, 1895 Charles Francis Jenkins {{showed off}} his <b>film</b> <b>projector</b> at the Franklin Institute. It {{was the first}} {{demonstration}} of moving pictures using flexible film in Philadelphia. A week later Woodville Latham's eidoloscope was shown to Philadelphia audiences. German immigrant and optician, Siegmund Lubin, {{was impressed with the}} technology and bought Jenkins' camera. In Philadelphia he filmed his first film, his horse eating hay. Lubin continued to make films in Philadelphia, now showing them commercially, and built his own cameras and projectors which he marketed. He eventually created a production company, Lubin Manufacturing Company, in 1902. Shortly afterwards Lubin opened up some of the cities first movie theaters and in 1905 Jules Mastbaum opened the city's first Nickelodeon. Lubin Studios shut down in 1917 and through most of the 20th Century Philadelphia had an almost non-existent film industry. In 1985 the Greater Philadelphia Film Office was created as part of the city government, and, in 1992, it became a regional economic office. Since 1992 the GPFO, which promotes the Philadelphia region and helps coordinate film productions, has assisted in the making of over 200 films and television shows. Between 1992 and 2002 film productions have brought in US$500 Million to the city's economy. In 2007 MovieMaker Magazine named Philadelphia the second-best American city to make a movie in. The magazine cites local talent, cost of living and help provided by the Philadelphia Film Office as reasons. Several months after the MovieMaker Magazine article, Pacifica Ventures announced that it will be opening a film studio in the Philadelphia area in 2008. Every year Philadelphia hosts the Philadelphia Film Festival and the Philadelphia International Gay & Lesbian Film Festival.

2500|$|Williams was {{the first}} showmen to use a {{projector}} produced by Haydon and Urry and his use of their machine (The Eragraph) came about {{as a result of}} three contributing factors: - need, availability, and timing. In early 1897, Haydon and Urry {{were in the process of}} developing their own <b>film</b> <b>projector.</b> The company had recently moved their offices and showroom to 353 Upper Street, Islington [...] and were located just across the street from the Royal Agricultural Hall where Williams was exhibiting. Williams was already acquainted with one of the firm’s employees, James Monte (their chief film maker), having met him a year earlier at a showman’s annual supper committee meeting. [...] By early February 1897, Haydon and Urry’s projector was ready for market and according to accounts from that time, Williams was in need of a new one. He had opened at the World’s Fair with an exhibition of films, but the projector he was using ("the Electroscope") had been condemned as a fire risk by London County officials. [...] Getting a showman as well known as Randall Williams on board with their new projector was no doubt a major coup for Haydon and Urry. The firm applied for a patent (application no. 3572) for their cinematograph on 10 February 1897 - just as the World’s Fair was ending - and just five days prior to the opening of Williams' show at King’s Lynn at the start of the fairground season. [...] The projector used by Williams at King's Lynn would have been the firm’s earliest model and, it was likely the same model he used throughout the summer, leading Haydon and Urry to claim in their advertising that their machine had been used “with unqualified success at Victorian Era Exhibition all Last Season.” ...|$|E
2500|$|Puyi {{could not}} speak Manchu; he only knew a single word in the language, yili ("arise"). Despite {{studying}} Manchu for years, he admitted {{that it was his}} [...] "worst" [...] subject among everything he studied. According to the journalist S. M. Ali, Puyi spoke Mandarin when interviewed but Ali believed that he could understand English. Johnston also introduced Puyi to the new technology of cinema, and Puyi was so delighted with the movies, especially Harold Lloyd films, that he had a <b>film</b> <b>projector</b> installed in the Forbidden City, despite the opposition of the eunuchs who disliked foreign technology operating in the Forbidden City. Johnston was also the first to argue that Puyi needed glasses, as he was extremely near-sighted, and after much argument with Prince Chun, who thought it was undignified for an Emperor to wear glasses, finally prevailed. Johnston, who spoke fluent Mandarin, closely followed the intellectual scene in China, and introduced Puyi to the [...] "new style" [...] Chinese books and magazines, which so inspired Puyi, that he wrote several poems that were published anonymously in [...] "New China" [...] publications. In 1922, Johnston had his friend, the writer Hu Shih, visit the Forbidden City to teach Puyi about recent developments in Chinese literature. Under Johnston's influence, Puyi embraced the bicycle as a way to exercise, cut his queue and grew a full head of hair, and wanted to go to study at Oxford, which was Johnston's alma mater. Johnston also introduced Puyi to the telephone, which Puyi soon become addicted to, phoning people in Beijing at random just to hear their voices on the other end. Johnston also pressured Puyi {{to cut down on the}} waste and extravagance in the Forbidden City, noting that all of these eunuch slaves had to be fed. Johnston convinced Puyi that he could open doors for himself and did not need eunuchs standing by idly all the time by the main doors of the palaces just to open the door for him if he should happen to come along. Puyi cut off his queue so he would look like a Western gentleman and under Johnston's advice embraced the bicycle as the best way to move about in the Forbidden City, retaining a lifelong enthusiasm for cycling, though it is doubtful that the eunuchs working as gardeners much appreciated Puyi's habit of riding through the flowers.|$|E
