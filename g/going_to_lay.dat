5|$|In the 1980s, Ben Shoshan and Yehuda Etzion, both {{members of}} the Gush Emunim Underground, plotted {{to blow up the}} al-Aqsa mosque and the Dome of the Rock. Etzion {{believed}} that blowing up the two mosques would cause a spiritual awakening in Israel, and would solve all the problems of the Jewish people. They also hoped the Third Temple of Jerusalem would be built on the location of the mosque. On 15 January1988, during the First Intifada, Israeli troops fired rubber bullets and tear gas at protesters outside the mosque, wounding 40 worshipers. On 8October1990, 22 Palestinians were killed and over 100 others injured by Israeli Border Police during protests that were triggered by the announcement of the Temple Mount Faithful, a group of religious Jews, that they were <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>lay</b> the cornerstone of the Third Temple.|$|E

6000|$|... "Perhaps not," [...] {{returned}} Gashford, with a sneer, [...] "but you {{are always}} too sure by half o' yer work. Come, stand up," [...] he added, <b>going</b> <b>to</b> where Tom <b>lay,</b> and stirring his prostrate form with his toe.|$|R
6000|$|After which, Joe withdrew to the window, {{and stood}} with his back towards me, wiping his eyes. And as my extreme {{weakness}} prevented me from getting up and <b>going</b> <b>to</b> him, I <b>lay</b> there, penitently whispering, [...] "O God bless him! O God bless this gentle Christian man!" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Well, I {{simply said}} what I thought," [...] {{answered}} Tom. [...] "They are not <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>lay</b> anything at Nellie's door if I can help it." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Oh, you'll wake up {{fast enough}} if they come," [...] {{answered}} Tom. [...] "But I am <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>lay</b> down myself. But I {{am not going}} to undress yet." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Say!" [...] he called. [...] "Jacobsen told me {{they were}} coming down this {{afternoon}} to Gabera. Said they were <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>lay</b> there to-night and take on sweet potatoes." ...|$|E
6000|$|Fortunately {{our young}} student was quick-witted. He soon {{perceived}} the drift of the Secretary's talk, and, without appearing to evade his questions, gave him such replies as conveyed to him no information whatever {{of the kind}} he desired. At the same time, he took occasion, when the Secretary's attention was attracted by something that was <b>going</b> on, <b>to</b> <b>lay</b> his finger on his lips and bestow a look of solemn warning on his comrades, the effect of which on their intelligent minds {{was to make the}} negro intensely stupid and the seaman miraculously ignorant! ...|$|R
6000|$|Mr. Goodman patted 'im on the shoulder. [...] "Don't {{you worry}} about Peter's troubles," [...] he ses. [...] "I know exactly wot to do; it's all planned out. Now I'm <b>going</b> <b>to</b> 'ave a <b>lay</b> down for an hour--I didn't get much sleep last night--and if you'll call me at twelve o'clock we'll go somewhere. Knock loud." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "The Englishman {{called down}} the {{everlasting}} curse of God on me," [...] he cried. [...] "Well, I have waited for it, {{and it does}} not come, so now for man's reward," [...] and <b>going</b> <b>to</b> where Suzanne <b>lay,</b> he set his arms beneath her and turned her over upon her back. [...] "She has swooned," [...] he said; [...] "perhaps it is as well," [...] and he stood looking at her, for thus in her faint she seemed wonderfully fair with the moonbeams playing upon her deathlike face.|$|R
6000|$|... "I suppose I deserve that, {{though it}} wasn't quite {{the only thing}} I meant. I've an idea that you are somehow <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>lay</b> up trouble for {{yourself}} by persevering in this search." ...|$|E
6000|$|Several minutes later, {{still on}} the stage and {{handling}} his animals, the husband managed a chance to mutter to his wife: [...] "It's the dog. It's him I'm after. I'm <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>lay</b> him out." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "And now, citizen Chauvelin," [...] he said, [...] "we {{know how}} we stand. We know that the English assassins are in Nantes. The {{question}} is how are we <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>lay</b> them by the heels." ...|$|E
5000|$|According to Basil I's grandson, the 10th-century emperor Constantine VII Porphyrogennetos, in 866 the Aghlabids {{launched}} a major seaborne {{campaign against the}} coasts of Dalmatia, with 36 ships {{under the command of}} [...] "Soldan" [...] (Sawdan, the Aghlabid emir of Bari), Saba of Tarento, and Kalfun the Berber. The Aghlabid fleet plundered the cities of Boutova (Budva), Rhosa (Risan), and Dekatera (Kotor), before <b>going</b> on <b>to</b> <b>lay</b> siege <b>to</b> Ragusa (Dubrovnik). The Ragusans managed to resist the Aghlabid siege for fifteen months, but as their strength declined, they sent envoys to Constantinople to seek assistance. Emperor Basil agreed to help them, and equipped a fleet of reportedly 100 ships, under the command of the experienced and capable patrikios Niketas Ooryphas. On learning of his approach from some deserters, the Saracens abandoned the siege and returned to Bari.|$|R
50|$|In Anglican churches, a vicar {{is a type}} of parish priest. Historically, parish {{priests in}} the Church of England were divided into vicars, rectors, and {{perpetual}} curates. The parish clergy and church were supported by tithes—like a local tax (traditionally, as the etymology of tithe suggests, of ten percent) levied on the personal as well as agricultural output of the parish. Roughly speaking, the distinction was that a rector directly received both the greater and lesser tithes of his parish while a vicar received only the lesser tithes (the greater tithes <b>going</b> <b>to</b> the <b>lay</b> holder, or impropriator, of the living); a perpetual curate with a small cure and often aged or infirm received neither greater nor lesser tithes, and received only a small salary (paid sometimes by the diocese). (See also Church of England#Organisation) Today, the roles of a rector and a vicar are essentially the same. Which of the two titles is held by the parish priest is historical. Some parishes have a rector, others a vicar.|$|R

6000|$|... "Absolutely! I {{would not}} suggest {{anything}} of the sort with Germany, but with this new Russia, the Russia of which Naida Karetsky is a daughter, why not?

60|$|SIR ROBERT CHILTERN. I fear I have no {{advice to}} give you, Mrs. Cheveley, except to {{interest}} yourself in something less dangerous.

6000|$|Saxton made {{a little}} gesture of approval, though he shook his head. [...] "You show {{you have a little}} sense now and then, but there's nothing in that view," [...] he said.

40|$|Professor Carr {{yesterday}} {{remarked that}} human trafficking {{is too often}} discussed only in theoretical or academic ways. I 2 ̆ 7 ve {{spent most of my}} career in the field, where interactions with victims, traffickers, and defense attorneys are anything but theoretical. But as keynote speaker for an academic symposium this morning, I 2 ̆ 7 m <b>going</b> <b>to</b> try <b>to</b> <b>lay</b> out a bit of the conceptual state of play from my current vantage point. The title of this symposium, 2 ̆ 2 Successes and Failures in International Human Trafficking Law, 2 ̆ 2 is a bit binary. Perhaps, in the best diplomatic tradition, we can temper that to 2 ̆ 2 Limitations and Opportunities in International Human Trafficking Law 2 ̆ 2 for my purposes today. And I think I 2 ̆ 7 m suited to offer some personal reflections here at the Law School today, having worked on this issue, whether as one of Professor MacKinnon 2 ̆ 7 s students, helping with the groundbreaking symposium that brought cutting-edge work to the fore; as a young trial lawyer in the Civil Rights Division; as a staff member on the House Judiciary Committee; and now as Ambassador-at- Large to Monitor and Combat Trafficking in Persons...|$|R
