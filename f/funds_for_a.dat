5|$|Breckinridge {{was also}} {{concerned}} with easing overland {{transport of goods}} to Virginia. In mid-1795, he, Robert Barr, Elijah Craig, and Harry Toulmin formed a committee to raise <b>funds</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> road connecting the Cumberland Gap to central Kentucky. Breckinridge was disappointed {{with the quality of}} the route, which was finished in late 1796, concluding that the individual maintaining it was keeping most of the tolls instead of using them for the road's upkeep.|$|E

5|$|After his maiden speech, Breckinridge took a {{more active}} role in the House. In debate with Ohio's Joshua Reed Giddings, he defended the Fugitive Slave Law's {{constitutionality}} and criticized Giddings for hindering the return of fugitive slaves. He opposed Tennessee Congressman Andrew Johnson's Homestead Bill, fearing it would create more territories that excluded slavery. Although generally opposed to funding local improvements, he supported the repair of two Potomac River bridges to avoid higher costs later. Other minor stands included supporting measures to benefit his district's hemp farmers, voting against giving the president ten more appointments to the U.S. Naval Academy, and opposing <b>funds</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> sculpture of George Washington because the sculptor proposed depicting Washington in a toga.|$|E
5|$|At the Tiffany Theatre, the {{audience}} performance cast had the theater's full cooperation; the local performers entered early and without charge.

Presently, The live action rendition of The Rocky Horror Picture Show is available for attendance in various locations in Los Angeles, typically Saturday nights at Midnight.|$|E
5|$|Floodlights were erected at {{the ground}} in 1956 and the £9,000 cost nearly sent the club into bankruptcy. However, Norwich's success in the 1958–59 FA Cup (where as a Third Division club they reached the semi-final, losing to First Division Luton Town after a replay) secured the {{financial}} status of the club and provided sufficient <b>funds</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> cover to be built over the South Stand. In 1963, the record was set for attendance at Carrow Road: a crowd of 43,984 watched a sixth round FA Cup match against Leicester City, and the South Stand was covered shortly afterwards.|$|E

5|$|In 1890, {{after the}} close of the {{legislative}} year, Sprigg relocated from Moorefield to Cumberland, Maryland. He resumed the practice of law and by 1894, his law office was located in the George's Creek and Cumberland Railroad headquarters building on Washington Street in Cumberland. Following the 1898 decisive victory of Winfield Scott Schley, a Frederick native, at the Battle of Santiago de Cuba during the Spanish–American War, Sprigg led an initiative in 1899 to raise <b>funds</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> silver service to be awarded from the people of Maryland to Schley in recognition of his actions.|$|E
5|$|In 2010, a {{fundraising}} {{campaign was}} started by the Cardiff City Supporters' Trust to raise <b>funds</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> statue of Keenor to be placed outside the clubs' stadium. The statue cost £85,000, which was raised through public donations and donations from the Welsh government and Football Association of Wales. The statue was designed by artist Roger Andrews, who had previously designed a statue of Tasker Watkins that was erected outside the Millennium Stadium in Cardiff. On 10 November 2012, the statue of Keenor holding the FA Cup was revealed outside gate 3 of the Cardiff City Stadium.|$|E
5|$|In November1906 the American Robert Peary {{returned}} from his latest unsuccessful quest for the North Pole, claiming a new Farthest North of 87°6′—a record disputed by later historians. He immediately began raising <b>funds</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> further attempt. In July1907 Dr Frederick Cook, a former shipmate of Amundsen's from Belgica, set off northwards on what was ostensibly a hunting trip but was rumoured to be an attempt on the North Pole. A month later Ernest Shackleton's Nimrod Expedition sailed for Antarctica, while Robert Falcon Scott was preparing a further expedition should Shackleton fail. Amundsen {{saw no reason to}} concede priority in the south to the British, and spoke publicly about the prospects of leading an Antarctic expedition—although his preferred goal remained the North Pole.|$|E

5|$|In the {{aftermath}} of Wallingford, Stephen and Henry spoke together privately about a potential end to the war; Stephen's son Eustace, however, was furious about the peaceful outcome at Wallingford. He left his father and returned home to Cambridge to gather more <b>funds</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> fresh campaign, where he fell ill and died the next month. Eustace's death removed an obvious claimant to the throne and was politically convenient for those seeking a permanent peace in England. It is possible, however, that Stephen {{had already begun to}} consider passing over Eustace's claim; historian Edmund King observes that Eustace's claim to the throne was not mentioned in the discussions at Wallingford, for example, and this may have added to Stephen's son's anger.|$|E
5|$|It {{was also}} {{reported}} that the CWU had started a fighting fund to help support postal workers who were experiencing financial difficulties {{as a result of}} the strike. Postmen lose a day's pay for each day they strike, and although most workers had lost just two days pay so far, many in the London area who had taken part in previous industrial action earlier in the year had lost as much as 18 days of wages. There was also speculation that the CWU lacked the <b>funds</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> lengthy dispute and donations to the union's fighting fund were pledged by other unions, including UNISON and Unite.|$|E
5|$|On June 24, 2016, President Obama {{announced}} {{the establishment of}} the Stonewall National Monument, a 7.7-acre site to be administered by the National Park Service. The designation, which followed transfer of city parkland to the federal government, protects Christopher Park and adjacent areas totaling more than seven acres; the Stonewall Inn is within the boundaries of the monument but remains privately owned. The National Park Foundation formed a new nonprofit organization to raise <b>funds</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> ranger station and interpretive exhibits for the monument.|$|E

5|$|Spanish EAV-8Bs joined Operation Deny Flight, {{enforcing}} the UN's no-fly zone over Bosnia and Herzegovina. Spain did not send its aircraft carrier {{to participate in}} the Iraq War in 2003, instead deploying F/A-18s and other aircraft to Turkey to defend that country against potential Iraqi attacks. Starting in 2007, Spain was looking to replace its Harrier IIs–with the likely option being the F-35B. The Spanish government, in May 2014 however, announced that it had decided to extend the aircraft's service life to beyond 2025 {{due to a lack of}} <b>funds</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> replacement aircraft.|$|E
5|$|The author {{contrasts}} Regents of the University of California v. Bakke {{with the}} Supreme Court's 1971 decision in Griggs v. Duke Power Co., which ruled that employers {{did not have}} to willfully discriminate against employees to violate Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964. Chief Justice Warren E. Burger wrote that certain standardized tests given by employers could be discriminatory, even if that was not the employer's intent. Another case discussed by Heins is the 1980 Supreme Court decision in Fullilove v. Klutznick, wherein the court ruled constitutional a federal law requiring a percentage of <b>funds</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> building project to be used for minority workers.|$|E
5|$|The camp's {{commanding}} officer Major General J.

The projected expense of the project was $35,000. At first, Berlin called in favors from civilian colleagues to visit and put on local performances to boost morale, but news of a Navy fundraising show on Broadway called Boom Boom inspired Berlin to request permission to write and stage a full Broadway production of their own.|$|E
