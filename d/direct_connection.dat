5|$|The {{system is}} {{split into two}} parts, with lines north of Boston having a {{terminus}} at North Station and lines south of Boston having a terminus at South Station. There is no <b>direct</b> <b>connection</b> between the two stations, but travel is made possible by transferring to the MBTA's subway system (although this requires an intermediate transfer at either Park Street or Downtown Crossing) or the 4 bus. This lack of <b>direct</b> <b>connection</b> could be alleviated by the proposed (but currently shelved) North–South Rail Link, which would build a tunnel connecting the two terminals.|$|E
5|$|Major railway routes through Sheffield {{railway station}} include the Midland Main Line, which links {{the city to}} London via the East Midlands, the Cross Country Route which links the East of Scotland and Northeast of England with the West Midlands and the Southwest, and the lines linking Liverpool and Manchester with Hull and East Anglia. With the {{redevelopment}} of London St Pancras station (now St Pancras International) complete, Sheffield has a <b>direct</b> <b>connection</b> to continental Europe. East Midlands Trains run services to St Pancras International and Eurostar run services from there to France and Belgium. The Master Cutler, a named passenger express train running from Sheffield railway station to London St Pancras, provides a <b>direct</b> <b>connection</b> to the capital.|$|E

5|$|R.I.P. 35E {{and other}} citizens' groups {{continued}} to oppose a <b>direct</b> <b>connection,</b> {{arguing that it}} would be no different from a typical freeway, since drivers {{would be more likely to}} exceed the speed limit if it was a continuous roadway to I-94. Saint Paul changed its mind again in September 1981, supporting a <b>direct</b> <b>connection,</b> along with Mn/DOT and the Metropolitan Council. A bill passed in March 1982 removed the stipulation that the parkway shall not connect to I-94, and allowed Route390 (I-35E) to use Route382 (the parkway). The final EIS was approved at about that time, and several groups including R.I.P. 35E filed suit in early 1983.|$|E
5|$|Unlike {{the other}} {{locations}} {{mentioned in the}} titles of the Four Quartets poems, Eliot had no <b>direct</b> <b>connection</b> to the original Christian community. As such, the community is supposed to represent almost any religious community.|$|E
5|$|By 1720, Vanbrugh's <b>direct</b> <b>connection</b> {{with the}} theatre had been terminated, but the leases and rents had been {{transferred}} to both his own family {{and that of his}} wife's through a series of trusts and benefices, with Vanbrugh himself building a new home in Greenwich. After the fire, the Vanbrugh family's long association with the theatre was terminated, and all their leases were surrendered by 1792.|$|E

5|$|Chiswick is {{situated}} {{at the start of}} the North Circular Road (A406), South Circular Road (A205) and the M4 motorway, the latter providing a <b>direct</b> <b>connection</b> to Heathrow Airport and the M25 motorway. The Great West Road (A4) runs eastwards into central London via the Hogarth Roundabout where it meets the Great Chertsey Road (A316) which runs south-west, eventually joining the M3 motorway.|$|E
5|$|It is {{generally}} not common for licensed gun owners to commit violent crimes with their guns, {{and most of the}} gun crimes are committed with illegal weapons that are beyond the control of the law. Annually, police investigate about 500 cases of illegal arming (with or without <b>direct</b> <b>connection</b> to committing other crime).|$|E

Michael Myers is the {{antagonist}} {{in all of}} the films except , the story of which has no <b>direct</b> <b>connection</b> to any other film in the series. In 2007, writer-director Rob Zombie made a remake of the 1978 film. A direct sequel to the 2007 remake was released two years later. An 11th film, directed by David Gordon Green, is set to be released in October 2018.|$|E

5|$|The Staten Island Railway {{originally}} {{consisted of}} three lines, but of the three, only the north-south Main Line is in passenger service. The terminal station at St. George provides a <b>direct</b> <b>connection</b> to the Staten Island Ferry. At St. George there are twelve tracks, only ten of which are presently used for service. At Tottenville, there is a three track yard, with two tracks {{on either side of}} a concrete station platform.|$|E

A new lower-level mezzanine will house the connection between the two stations, directly connecting to the downtown platform for Lexington Avenue service. The <b>direct</b> <b>connection</b> to the staircases to the upper level will be rebuilt. At the western end of the station, a transfer will be built to connect to the Harlem–125th Street station of the Metro-North Railroad. An elevator, stairs, and escalators would connect the two stations.|$|E
5|$|Christian metal bands {{exist in}} most of the subgenres of heavy metal music, and the only common link among most Christian metal bands are the lyrics. The Christian themes are often melded with the {{subjects}} of the genre the band is rooted in, regularly providing a Christian take on the subject matter. It has been argued that the marginal yet transnational Christian metal subculture provides its core members an alternative religious expression and Christian identity, and that the music serves the purpose of offering a positive message through lyrical content. This may not necessarily show a <b>direct</b> <b>connection</b> or reference to the Christian faith but often it does.|$|E
5|$|Construction of {{the railway}} was {{estimated}} to cost £1million. Initially, with the Crimean War under way, the Met {{found it hard to}} raise the capital. While it attempted to raise the funds it presented new bills to Parliament seeking an extension of time to carry out the works. In July 1855, an Act to make a <b>direct</b> <b>connection</b> to the GNR at King's Cross received royal assent. The plan was modified in 1856 by the Metropolitan (Great Northern Branch and Amendment) Act and in 1860 by the Great Northern & Metropolitan Junction Railway Act.|$|E

5|$|Despite {{the growth}} of the Internet, the {{characteristics}} of local area networks (LANs)--computer networks that do not extend beyond a few kilometers—remain distinct. This is because networks on this scale do not require all the features associated with larger networks and are often more cost-effective and efficient without them. When they are not connected with the Internet, they also have the advantages of privacy and security. However, purposefully lacking a <b>direct</b> <b>connection</b> to the Internet does not provide assured protection from hackers, military forces, or economic powers. These threats exist if there are any methods for connecting remotely to the LAN.|$|E
5|$|Donald Cousens Parkway and {{a planned}} {{connection}} with Morningside Avenue form the East Metro Transportation Corridor, originally {{envisioned by the}} province in the 1970s as a six lane municipal expressway. During the mid-1990s, the Ministry of Transportation of Ontario (MTO) conducted studies and identified {{the need for the}} corridor by 2011. Although York had intended for a continuous alignment, the City of Toronto has opposed the <b>direct</b> <b>connection</b> between Morningside and Donald Cousens Parkway. As a result, it is now proposed to connect Morningside Avenue and Donald Cousens Parkway via a widened Steeles Avenue. However, no timeline has been announced as of 2015.|$|E
5|$|I-95 {{runs from}} north to south through Providence while I-195 connects the city to eastern Rhode Island and southeastern Massachusetts, {{including}} New Bedford, Massachusetts, and Cape Cod. I-295 encircles Providence while RI 146 provides a <b>direct</b> <b>connection</b> with Worcester, Massachusetts. The city commissioned and began a long-term project, the Iway, to move I-195 in 2007 not only for safety reasons, but also to free up land and to reunify the Jewelry District with Downcity Providence, which had been split from one another by the highway. The project was estimated to cost $610 million.|$|E

These in turn provide hotel information {{directly to the}} hundreds of thousands of travel agents that align themselves with one of these systems. Individual hotels and small hotel chains often cannot afford the expense of these <b>direct</b> <b>connections</b> and turn to other companies to provide the connections.|$|R
