25|$|Pignut hickory {{begins to}} bear seed in {{quantity}} in 30 years, with optimum production between 75 and 200 years (16). The maximum age for seed production is about 300 years. Good seed crops occur every year or two with light crops in other years; frost can seriously hinder seed production (22). Usually {{less than half of}} the seeds are sound (2,3), but 50 to 75 percent of these will germinate. The <b>hickory</b> <b>shuckworm</b> (Laspeyresia caryana) can seriously reduce germination. Pignut seed, averaging 440/kg (200/lb), is lighter than the seed of other hickory species. The nuts are disseminated mainly by gravity, but the range of seeding is extended by squirrels and chipmunks.|$|E

50|$|Damaging agents: Although {{numerous}} {{insects and}} diseases affect hickories, shellbark hickory has no enemies that seriously threaten its development or perpetuation as a species. Seed production {{can be reduced}} significantly, however, through attack by several insects. Two {{of the most important}} are the pecan weevil (Curculio caryae) and the <b>hickory</b> <b>shuckworm</b> (Laspeyresia caryana).|$|E
50|$|The {{caterpillars}} (<b>hickory</b> <b>shuckworms)</b> feed on Carya ovata, Carya illinoensis and Juglans nigra.|$|R
50|$|Nuts of all hickory {{species are}} {{susceptible}} to attack by the hickory nut weevil (Curculio caryae). Another weevil (Conotrachelus aratus) attacks young shoots and leaf petioles. The Curculio species are the most damaging and can destroy 65 percent of the hickory nut crop. <b>Hickory</b> <b>shuckworms</b> also damage nuts.|$|R
50|$|Good seed crops occur every 2 to 3 {{years with}} light seed crops in {{intervening}} years. Approximately 50 to 75 percent of fresh seed will germinate. Fourteen mockernut hickory trees in southeastern Ohio produced {{an average annual}} crop of 6,285 nuts for 6 years; about 39 percent were sound, 48 percent aborted, and 13 percent had insect damage. <b>Hickory</b> <b>shuckworm</b> (Laspeyresia caryana) is probably {{a major factor in}} reducing germination.|$|E

40|$|The pecan bud moth, Gretchena bolliana (Slingerland), is {{a native}} pest of pecan and hickory {{throughout}} the pecan belt. It occurs from South Carolina to Florida and west to Texas. Arizona and New Mexico are free of this pest to date. Adult pecan bud moths have a wingspan of approximately two-thirds of an inch. Sexes occur in a 1 : 1 ratio, and {{both males and females}} are gray with blackish-brown patches on the forewings. The hindwings are a dark gray-brown with a fringe-like border of scales. The scales beneath the hind wings reflect a green-white iridescence. Adult bud moths resemble the <b>hickory</b> <b>shuckworm,</b> and both species are often collected in blacklight traps at the same time. Undamaged bud moths may be distinguished from shuckworm moths by their larger size and their difference in color; adult shuckworms are dark brown an...|$|E
40|$|Cydia Hübner 1825 is a genus of moths in {{the family}} Tortricidae with 231 named species and {{subspecies}} and is distributed on all continents except Antarctica. As larvae, many species feed within reproductive structures, such as fruits, seeds, and flowers, under bark, or within fleshy stems of at least 65 host-plant species including angiosperms and conifers. Many species, including codling moth, pea moth, spruce seed moth, pine seedworms, filbertworm, and <b>hickory</b> <b>shuckworm</b> are considered pests of agriculture and forestry. As a result, the biology, natural enemies, and pheromones of several species have been well-studied. The nomenclature and classification of Cydia has also been well-studied but is less resolved. Nineteen different genus names have been proposed for species in this genus, with Laspeyresia Hübner, and Carpocapsa Treitschke being in common usage until relatively recently. Following the rules governing the International Code of Zoological Nomenclature, Cydia is the valid genus name for all species congeneric with the codling moth, Cydia pomonella (Linnaeus), the type species of the genus. The relationship of Cydia to other genera in the tribe Grapholitini is a topic of continued debate. Some authors {{have suggested that the}} tribe is an evolutionary grade while others have presented evidence that Grapholitini is a monophyletic clade. Although some secondary sexual characters have been proposed, the genus Cydia can claim no synapomorphies that can be found in all Cydia species. To better understand the systematics and evolution of this group more detailed morphological, molecular, and ecological data are needed for non-pest species. At least 21 endemic species of Cydia are known from the Hawaiian Islands. Males of most species have a ventral pouch below the cubital vein of the hindwings similar to C. latiferreana (Walsingham), C. maackiana (Danilevsky), and several other Cydia species to a lesser extent, although this feature appears to have arisen independently in the Hawaiian group. Larvae, where known, feed on endemic plants {{in the family}} Fabaceae. Identification of species is made difficult by extreme polymorphism of wing patterns for some widespread species and a general reduction of morphological features in the genitalia of male moths, while some features of female genitalia, particularly the antrum and lamella postvaginalis, have diagnostic value. Eight new species of Hawaiian Cydia are described (C. mauiensis n. sp., C. velocilimitata n. sp., C. haleakalaensis n. sp., C. makai n. sp., C. koaiae n. sp., C. hawaiiensis n. sp., C. acaciavora n. sp., and C. anomalosa n. sp.) based on wing patterns and features of male and female genitalia. The thirteen previously known species are redescribed because original descriptions were inconsistent among authors and based solely on wing patterns. Distributions, host-plant affinities, and natural enemies for each species are discussed. A molecular phylogeny of 66 specimens representing 14 Hawaiian Cydia species plus 20 outgroup species was constructed using nuclear and mitochondrial DNA to assess the relative importance of host-plant affinities and geographic isolation in their diversification. Hawaiian Cydia is monophyletic and nested well-within the genus. They appear to have arrived in the Hawaiian Islands after the rise of Maui based on the basal position of several Maui and Hawaii Island species throughout the phylogeny. The earliest diverging species feed on Canavalia and dispersed across the high islands. Subsequent shifts to feeding on Sophora chrysophylla then Acacia koa were followed by speciation and the filling of these niches across the islands. The origin of Hawaiian Cydia remains obscure, but appears to be a separate colonization of remote Oceania from Cydia pseusomalesana Clarke in French Polynesia. It is likely that several more species of Hawaiian Cydia await discovery while several others probably have gone extinct in the 100 years since they were first collected. A broader survey of outgroup taxa from Asia and the Americas, and more informative genes in a molecular phylogeny may help resolve the origins of Hawaiian Cydia...|$|E
