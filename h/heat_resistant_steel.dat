However, the precipitation behavior and strengthening mechanism of Cu-rich phase in these advanced austenitic heat resistant steels is still unclear. In order to understand the precipitation strengthening behavior of Cu-rich phase and to promote high strength austenitic <b>heat</b> <b>resistant</b> <b>steel</b> development, 18 Cr 9 NiCuNb steel which is a Cu-added Nb contained advanced Fe–Cr–Ni type austenitic <b>heat</b> <b>resistant</b> <b>steel</b> has been selected for this study to be aged at 650 °C till to 10, 000 h. Micro-hardness and room temperature tensile test were conducted after long-time aging. SEM, TEM, HRTEM and three dimensional atom probe (3 DAP) technology accompanying with thermodynamic calculation have been used to investigate the Cu-rich phase precipitation behavior during 650 °C aging. The experimental results showed that Cu atoms can quickly concentrate in clusters at very early precipitation stage to form the fine nano-size Cu-rich “segregation areas” within less than 1 h at 650 °C. With increasing aging time at 650 °C Cu atoms continuously concentrate to Cu-rich segregation areas (clusters) and simultaneously other kinds of atoms such as Fe, Cr and Ni diffuse away from Cu-rich segregation areas to austenitic matrix, and finally to complete the transformation from Cu-rich segregation areas to Cu-rich phase. However, there is only Cu atoms concentration but not crystallographic transformation from early stage of Cu-rich clusters forming to the final Cu-rich phase formation. Even the Cu atom becomes the main composed element after 500 h aging at 650 °C the Cu-rich phase still keeps coherent relationship with austenitic matrix. According the experimental results in this study, Cu-rich phase precipitation sequence which starts from the Cu atom segregation followed by the Cu diffusing from matrix to segregation areas and Fe, Cr and Ni atoms diffuse out from Cu-rich areas to matrix without crystallographic transformation is proposed. The Cu-rich phase is the most dispersed phase and contributes the most important strengthening effect among all precipitated phases (M 23 C 6, MX and Cu-rich phase). It has been found that Cu-rich phase is very stable and still keeps in nano-size even for 10, 000 h aging at 650 °C. The unique precipitation strengthening of Cu-rich phase in combination with nano-size Nb-rich MX phase and grain-boundary M 23 C 6 carbide contributes excellent strengthening effect to 18 Cr 9 NiCuNb austenitic <b>heat</b> <b>resistant</b> <b>steel...</b>|$|E

40|$|A {{group of}} steels used in bearing {{applications}} {{were subjected to}} three different heat treatments – gaseous ferritic and austenitic nitrocarburizing at 580 °C and 620 °C respectively and solution nitriding at 1100 °C. The aim was to improve wear and corrosion resistance of the steels and to evaluate for which steels the processes are most suitable. Both nitrocarburizing processes resulted in a thin compound layer with a hardness {{in the range of}} 800 – 1000 HV for all investigated steels. The hardest and deepest diffusion zones were obtained on the steels with the lowest carbon content. The best properties for bearing applications were obtained by austenitic nitrocarburizing which resulted in a thicker compound layer and a deeper nitrocarburizing depth than ferritic nitrocarburizing. Another advantage of austenitic nitrocarburizing is that it produces an austenitic layer below the compound layer. By tempering at 300 °C this layer can be transformed to a fine structure with hardness above 1000 HV. It was also established that both ferritic and austenitic nitrocarburizing improve corrosion resistance in neutral salt spray significantly. Solution nitriding was applied to one group of martensitic stainless steels and one group of <b>heat</b> <b>resistant</b> <b>steels.</b> All the steels were found to contain nitrogen after the treatment.
