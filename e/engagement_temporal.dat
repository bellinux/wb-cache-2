40|$|Research {{seeking to}} improve {{retention}} at Universities has traditionally had {{a focus on}} student <b>engagement.</b> <b>Temporal</b> orientation has been theorised as having a significant influence on student engagement. Zimbardo's Time Perspective Inventory, the State Hope Scale, and the Study Process Questionnaire were completed by 167 Psychology students attending a rural university. Future Time Perspective and Past Positive were positively correlated with the Hope Pathway subscale. Present Hedonistic Time Perspective {{was positively correlated with}} the Agency subscale of Hope. There was a significant difference between deep and surface learners with regards to Future Time Perspective. No significant differences between school leavers and mature-aged students were found for the variables of Time Perspective and Hope. School leavers utilized surface learning strategies, while mature-aged students tended to use deep learning strategies. Current research suggests time perspectives may be helpful in enhancing and supporting academic engagement and persistence in higher education...|$|E

40|$|In {{order to}} become a {{proficient}} user of language, infants must detect temporal cues embedded within the noisy acoustic spectra of ongoing speech by efficient attentional engagement. According to the neuro-constructivist approach, a multi-sensory dysfunction of attentional engagement - hampering the temporal sampling of stimuli - might be responsible for language deficits typically shown in children with Specific Language Impairment (SLI). In the present study, the efficiency of visual attentional engagement was investigated in 22 children with SLI and 22 typically developing (TD) children by measuring attentional masking (AM). AM refers to impaired identification {{of the first of}} two sequentially presented masked objects (O 1 and O 2) in which the O 1 -O 2 interval was manipulated. Lexical and grammatical comprehension abilities were also tested in both groups. Children with SLI showed a sluggish <b>engagement</b> of <b>temporal</b> attention, and individual differences in AM accounted for a significant percentage of unique variance in grammatical performance. Our results suggest that an attentional engagement deficit - probably linked to a dysfunction of the right fronto-parietal attentional network - might be a contributing factor in these children's language impairments...|$|R

We designed and conducted an experiment based on the experiencesampling method to evaluate our model {{on the basis of a}} long-term SMS-based game called Day of the Figurines. Statistical analysis supports the hypothesis that player engagement can be predicted by the continuous data properties elapsed time and response time. Our findings point towards further research towards the adaptation of pervasive experiences to the player’s temporal context.

40|$|Abstract: Multi-actor {{systems are}} most often {{designed}} for a purpose, to perform one or more tasks, to achieve one or more goals for human users. Current research on system design focuses primarily on multi-agent system (MAS) functionality, structure and (emergent) behaviour. Very little research focuses on interaction between human users and systems. Trust in multi-actor systems, however, mandates consideration of their interaction. Recent research {{on the design of}} trust (YUPTA) in human (online) collaboration emphasizes the importance of time in interaction: synchronization, rhythm, duration and moments of transformation are elements that determine whether trust emerges and is maintained. This paper argues that similarly <b>temporal</b> <b>engagement</b> between human beings and multi-agent systems must be explicitly designed and implemented for trust in multi-actor systems, including MAS, to be acquired...|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{argues that}} {{performance}} {{can be seen}} to constitute both a critical discipline and a set of activities entailing an <b>engagement</b> with spatial, <b>temporal,</b> physical and material relations, rather than as a product of linguistic, textual and discursive relations. As such, performance is able to critique the functioning of language, text and discourse in assuming space, time, bodies and matter. Performance also suggests ways of working on and informing writing practices. The social relations of performance pertain to times and spaces which are temporary and processual, to activities which imagine other times, spaces and people, and seek to realise them for a specific time in a specific space for a specific group of people. The social relations realised in this process of contingent realities are able to inform writing, that is, to produce writing which connects theatre with other discourses, and which connects words with bodies in time and space. It is argued that theatre and performance's process of imagination and realisation and its <b>engagement</b> with spatial, <b>temporal,</b> physical and material relations provides a valuable site for critically examining the ways in which Australia privileges and remembers specific configurations of space, time, bodies and matter, while marginalising others, in producing official representations of the Australian nation. Such representations, reflected ingovernmental programmes such as those concerning citizenship and national security, have a bearing on how Australians view their national past, present and future, and how they perceive their social connections with each other. Just as specific performances are made subject to the textual and discursive categories of literature and social theory, official enactments of the Australian nation are able to 'contain' Australians who spatially, temporally and physically transgress national boundaries. As a material practice, performance is able to engage with official enactments of the nation in order to 're-open' the spaces, times and encounters concealed within these sites...|$|R
40|$|The Temporal Focus Scale (TFS) is a 12 -item self-report {{measure of}} {{cognitive}} <b>engagement</b> with the <b>temporal</b> domains of past, present and future.

We tested the factor structure of the scale in a sample of Northern Irish adolescents and found that our data supported a three factor structure, although there were problems with item 10. Because time perspective measures have been found to relate differentially to various health behaviours, we tested the relations between scores on the TFS and self-reported alcohol use. Results showed that scores on the TFS were not consistent statistical predictors of drinking category in a logistic regression.

40|$|Pairing a {{previously}} neutral conditioned stimulus (CS; e. g., a tone) to an aversive unconditioned stimulus (US; e. g., a footshock) leads to associative learning {{such that the}} tone alone comes to elicit a conditioned response (e. g., freezing). We have previously shown that an extinction session that occurs within the reconsolidation window (termed retrieval+extinction) attenuates fear responding and prevents the return of fear in Pavlovian fear conditioning (Monfils et al., 2009). To date, the mechanisms that explain the different behavioral outcomes between standard extinction and retrieval+extinction remain poorly understood. Here we sought to examine the differential <b>temporal</b> <b>engagement</b> of specific neural systems by these 2 approaches using Arc catFISH (cellular compartment analysis of temporal activity using fluorescence in situ hybridization). Our results demonstrate that extinction and retrieval+extinction lead to differential patterns of expression, suggesting that they engage different networks.

A biocybernetic loop is formed by adjusting the mode of operation of a task set (e. g., manual/automated mix) based on electroencephalographic (EEG) signals reflecting an operator's engagement in the task set. A critical issue for the loop operation is the selection of features of the EEG to provide an index of engagement upon which to base decisions to adjust task mode. Subjects were run in the closed-loop feedback configuration under four candidate and three experimental control definitions of an <b>engagement</b> index.

40|$|The article {{draws from}} two {{theoretical}} fields, innovation intermediation and sustainability transitions, {{to examine the}} role of government-affiliated intermediary organisations in system-level transitions. The role of intermediaries working between actors – producers and users, entrepreneurs and adopters, idea generators and funders – has seldom been specifically addressed in the transitions literature. Thus, the role of intermediary organisations in enacting change in socio-technical regimes, particularly of intermediaries falling between traditional public sector and private sector actors, is {{of interest in this}} article. Empirical analyses of two Finnish organisations, Sitra and Motiva, show that government-affiliated intermediaries are likely to engage in strategic niche management processes in diverse ways, each organisation having its own distinct characteristics. The analysis also points out that to get from niches to transition, sustained systemic intermediaries are crucial in articulating new visions and expectations. Government-affiliated intermediaries may make an important contribution to sustainability transitions by initiating and managing new policy or market processes and by acting as an impartial contact point or voice for new networks of actors. While independence from public administration is likely to facilitate networking, too neutral a stance or limited <b>temporal</b> <b>engagement</b> may reduce the transition-facilitating effects...|$|R
40|$|Book synopsis: Assembling Architecture explores {{new ways}} of {{engaging}} architecture in archaeology. It conceives of architecture both as the physical evidence of past societies but also existing beyond the physical environment and considers how {{people in the past}} have not just dwelled in buildings but existed with them. The book engages with the meeting point between these two perspectives. On the one hand, archaeologists must deal with the presence and absence of physicality as part of their analysis, and on the other hand, as a discipline studying humans through things, it also has to deal with the performances, as well as temporal and affective impacts of these material remains. The contributions investigate the way time, performance and movement – both physically and emotionally – are central aspects of understanding architectural assemblages. It is a book about the constellations of people, places and things that emerge and dissolve as affective, mobile, performative and <b>temporal</b> <b>engagements.</b> Documenting the ephemeral, relational, and emotional meeting with one category of material objects that has defined much research into {{what it means to be}} human Assembling Architecture elucidates and expands upon a crucial body of evidence that allows us to explore the lives and interactions of past societies...|$|R

40|$|The {{perception}} {{of time is}} one of the hallmarks of conscious experience. However, despite this importance, time is a relatively understudied dimension in psychology and cognitive neuroscience. A central question within the time perception literature is whether timing relies on a unitary, context independent neural mechanism, or whether timing is a distributed process that relies on multiple, context dependent circuits. A series of experiments drawing on a variety of methodologies were conducted in order to address this question. First, a series of meta-analyses, each modeling neuroimaging results on time perception studies, were conducted utilizing the Activation Likelihood Estimation (ALE) algorithm. Studies were divided on the bases of task variation, interval length, and explicit or implicit <b>engagement</b> of <b>temporal</b> processing. The results revealed dissociable, yet partially overlapping, neural networks that are selectively engaged for timing under different temporal contexts. Second, meta-analytic results were used to guide stimulation of a site within the right supramarginal gyrus (SMG), a site implicated during the processing of sub-second intervals, with Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation (TMS). Across a series of experiments, right SMG stimulation was found to selectively increase the length of perceived duration of a visual stimulus. An additional study utilized simultaneous TMS and Electroencephalography to demonstrate that SMG stimulation led to an increase in amplitude of a slow-wave negative cortical potential over frontocentral sites that correlated between subjects, such that individuals with larger increases in amplitude experienced a longer subjective duration than those with small or no change. Third, results from the meta-analysis also suggested dissociations between nigrostriatal and mesocortical dopamine pathways in the timing of sub-second and supra-second intervals, respectively. A behavioral genetics demonstrated that subjects with polymorphisms separately affecting different dopamine circuits were selectively impaired on a time perception task at distinct duration ranges, suggesting differential engagement of the dopamine system across different temporal contexts. These results suggest that timing is mediated by independent, but partially overlapping neural systems, which may be flexibly engaged depending on the task requirements, such that single or multiple systems may be active during any one timing task, depending on environmental conditions and behavioral requirements. ...|$|R
40|$|The neural {{correlates}} of processing linguistic context in schizophrenic patients with formal thought disorder (FTD) were examined. Six right-handed male patients with prominent 'positive' FTD {{were compared with}} six schizophrenic patients without FTD and seven volunteers, matched for cognitive and demographic variables. Functional magnetic resonance imaging (IMRI) {{was used to measure}} cerebral activation while subjects read and completed sentence stems out loud. During a GENERATION condition, subjects were required to generate a word which completed the sentence stem appropriately. During a DECISION condition, subjects selected and articulated one of two presented terminal words. A READING condition served as baseline. The three conditions were compared with each other. Regions activated were identified in each group, and between-group differences were detected using an ANCOVA. When GENERATION was compared with READING, FTD patients showed less activation in the right superior temporal gyrus than patients without FTD or controls, but greater activation in the left inferior frontal, inferior temporal and fusiform gyri. FTD patients also showed an attenuated right temporal response when GENERATION was compared with DECISION. This differential engagement of the right temporal cortex was independent of differences in the speed or accuracy of responses, whereas the left fronto-temporal differences in activation were not evident after covarying for task errors. The attenuated <b>engagement</b> of right <b>temporal</b> cortex, which is implicated in language comprehension at the discourse level, is consistent with neuropsychological evidence linking thought disorder with deficits in processing linguistic context...|$|R
40|$|Background: Here {{we report}} on a {{meta-analysis}} of the between-group main effect (Group Difference) noted in the attentional blink (AB) research focused on specific reading impairment, {{commonly referred to as}} developmental dyslexia. The AB effect relates to a limitation in the allocation of attention over time and is examined in a dual-target rapid serial visual presentation (RSVP) paradigm. When the second target appears in close temporal proximity to the first target, the second target is reported less accurately. Method: A Web of Science search with terms “attentional blink” & dyslexia returned 13 AB experiments (11 papers) conducted with developmental dyslexia. After exclusions, 12 experiments were included in the meta-analysis. The main pattern of performance from those experiments was lower overall accuracy in groups of individuals with dyslexia relative to typically reading peers; that is, a between-group main effect. This meta-analysis examined the size of the Group Difference in relation to temporal and task-set related features, which differed between and within experiments. Results: Random effects modelling indicated a significant Group Difference of − 0. 74 standard deviation units, 95 % CI [−. 96, −. 52], p <. 001 (excluding one anomalous result) : implicating significantly poorer overall dual-target performance in dyslexic readers. Meta-regression analyses indicated two variables related to the Group Difference; pre-RSVP time and temporal variability of the second target relative to the first target within the RSVP. Discussion: It is suggested that the endogenous <b>engagement</b> of the <b>temporal</b> features of task-set is slower or disrupted in developmental dyslexia. 18 page(s...|$|R
40|$|Can the {{cortical}} substrates for {{the perception}} of face actions be distinguished when the superficial visual qualities of these actions are very similar? Two fMRI experiments are reported. Compared with watching the face at rest, observing silent speech was associated with bilateral activation {{in a number of}} temporal cortical regions, including the superior temporal sulcus (STS). Watching face movements of similar extent and duration, but which could not be construed as speech (gurning; Experiment 1 b) was not associated with activation of superior temporal cortex to the same extent, especially in the left hemisphere. Instead, the peak focus of the largest cluster of activation was in the posterior part of the inferior temporal gyrus (right, BA 37). Observing silent speech, but not gurning faces, was also associated with bilateral activation of inferior frontal cortex (BA 44 and 45). In a second study, speechreading and observing gurning faces were compared within a single experiment, using stimuli which comprised the speaker’s face and torso (and hence a much smaller image of the speaker’s face and facial actions). There was again differential <b>engagement</b> of superior <b>temporal</b> cortex which followed the pattern of Experiment 1. These findings suggest that superior temporal gyrus and neighbouring regions are activated bilaterally when subjects view face actions – at different scales – that can be interpreted as speech. This circuitry is not accessed to the same extent by visually similar, but linguistically meaningless actions. However, some temporal regions, such as the posterior part of the right superior temporal sulcus, appear to be common processing sites for processing both seen speech and gurns...|$|R
40|$|Stan Brakhage, {{as one of}} the {{foremost}} avant-garde filmmakers of the 20 th Century (indeed right up to his death in 2003), has offered viewers of his films an expanded sense of what the camera can achieve. His influential development of theories of ‘hypnogogic vision’ and ‘moving visual thinking’ complicate the ways in which viewers of his films experience the visual. What is presented on the screen often reflects a discontinuous sense of the camera as eye. What is seen on the screen, and what can be seen, is not presented to us as a cohesive, non-negotiable actuality, but rather as a complex unearthing of cinematic techniques that relate to the physical aspects of seeing, and that engage with the viewer’s own sense of the visual. This paper seeks to show ways in which Stan Brakhage’s ‘just seeing’, and his achievements in cinematic technique in this area, are useful, in an expository way, in the contextualisation of some of the poetic techniques and strategies used in contemporary poetry in relation to the formulation, and manifestation, of complex temporal structures that invoke a sense of ‘Background Temporality’, or sense of <b>temporal</b> <b>engagement</b> that informs the poetry, and the performance of the poetry, at a given time, in a given place, to a given reader or audience. I will demonstrate, in relation to avant-garde and contemporary strategies of representation, such as those adopted in Brakhage’s cinema, how these poetries can engage with forms of discontinuous visuality, visuality that is fractured and multiply activated, particularly in terms of its temporal operation. Specifically I will look at some examples from the poetry of Lee Harwood, Bruce Andrews and Joan Retallack...|$|R
40|$|Whether in {{the guise}} of the novel or {{non-print}} media such as film and television, fin-de-millennium science fiction has provided opportunities to envisage a posthuman stage of evolution. The academic response to this has been polarized. Certain elements have embraced the genre as integral to the sociocultural relationship between unfettered biotechnological advance and the limitation of the human flesh. Others have treated the topic as fanciful entertainment, leading them to ignore and sometimes ridicule research on the posthuman. The thesis seeks to utilise the contemporary science fiction allegory as an aid in developing a critique of the emerging posthuman discourse, facilitating the analysis of its socio-political dynamic, and questioning whether discourse advancement necessitates the rejection of the humanist metanarrative. The thesis is divided into six chapters. The first chapter differentiates the posthuman from established biotechnological discourses, e mg the discontinuities in global location, <b>temporal</b> <b>engagement,</b> and participant ideology. The second reflects on the contemporary human condition associated with man's technological ingenuity being a credible threat to his own existence. It then outlines the epochal technoscience of the posthuman and introduces the diametrically opposed standpoints of the posthuman as amelioration, or autoextinction. The third chapter draws upon utopian visions of the future to contextualise and assist in the critical analysis of narratives advocating posthuman technoscience. The fourth chapter reverses this, by utilising dystopian imagery as an entree into the rationale of those opposing human alteration, facilitating its critique. The fifth chapter sees the science fiction allegory as a postfoundationalist narrative, offering up a discursive mirror to the influences of providence and progress on the posthuman debate. The final chapter examines whether an a-humanist account of man's relationship with technology might help to advance the posthuman debate...|$|R
40|$|Background Patient-centred {{care has}} been {{advocated}} {{as a key}} component of high-quality patient care, yet its meanings and related actions have been difficult to ascertain. Objective To map the use of different terms related to the process of giving patients a starring role in their own care and clarify the possible boundaries between terms that are often mixed. Methods A literature search was conducted using different electronic databases. All records containing the search terms ‘patient engagement’, ‘patient activation’, ‘patient empowerment’, ‘patient involvement’, ‘patient adherence’, ‘patient compliance’ and ‘patient participation’ were collected. Identified literature was then analysed using the Statistical Package for Social Science (SPSS). The number of yearly publications, most productive countries, cross-concepts articles and various scientific fields dealing with the multidisciplinary concepts were identified. Results Overall, 58 987 papers were analysed. Correspondence analysis revealed three temporal trends. The first period (2002 – 2004) focused on compliance and adherence, the second period (2006 – 2009) focused on the relationship between participation and involvement, and the third one (2010 – 2013) emphasized empowerment. Patient activation and patient <b>engagement</b> followed the <b>temporal</b> development trend connected to the ‘immediate future’. Discussion and conclusions The bibliometric trend suggests that the role of patient in the health-care system is changing. In the last years, the patient was viewed as a passive receptor of medical prescription. To date, the need to consider patients as active partners of health-care planning and delivery is growing. In particular, the term patient engagement appears promising, not only for its increasing growth of interest in the scholarly debate, but also because it offers a broader and better systemic conceptualization of the patients’ role in the fruition of health care. To build a shared vocabulary of terms and concepts related to the active role of patients in the health-care process may be envisaged as the first operative step towards a concrete innovation of health-care organizations and systems...|$|R
40|$|PURPOSE: In this EEG {{study we}} sought to examine the {{neuronal}} underpinnings of short-term plasticity as a top-down guided auditory learning process. We hypothesized, that (i) auditory imagery should elicit proper auditory evoked effects (N 1 /P 2 complex) and a late positive component (LPC). Generally, based on recent human brain mapping studies we expected (ii) to observe the involvement of different temporal and parietal lobe areas in imagery and in perception of acoustic stimuli. Furthermore we predicted (iii) that temporal regions show an asymmetric trend due to the different specialization of the temporal lobes in processing speech and non-speech sounds. Finally we sought evidence supporting the notion that short-term training is sufficient to drive top-down activity in brain regions that are not normally recruited by sensory induced bottom up processing. METHODS: 18 non-musicians partook in a 30 channels based EEG session that investigated spatio-temporal dynamics of auditory imagery of "consonant-vowel" (CV) syllables and piano triads. To control for conditioning effects, we split the volunteers in two matched groups comprising the same conditions (visual, auditory or bimodal stimulation) presented {{in a slightly different}} serial order. Furthermore the study presents electromagnetic source localization (LORETA) of perception and imagery of CV- and piano stimuli. RESULTS: Our results imply that auditory imagery elicited similar electrophysiological effects at an early stage (N 1 /P 2) as auditory stimulation. However, we found an additional LPC following the N 1 /P 2 for auditory imagery only. Source estimation evinced bilateral <b>engagement</b> of anterior <b>temporal</b> cortex, which was generally stronger for imagery of music relative to imagery of speech. While we did not observe lateralized activity for the imagery of syllables we noted significantly increased rightward activation over the anterior supratemporal plane for musical imagery. CONCLUSION: Thus, we conclude that short-term top-down training based auditory imagery of music and speech prompts involvement of distinct neural circuits residing in the perisylvian cortex...|$|R
30|$|That {{the vast}} {{majority}} of what we need to know is likely to be developed ‘on the job’ and across time is emphasised in much of the more practically orientated interdisciplinary literature. Some also emphasise the gradual acquisition of cross-disciplinary knowledge through activities and engagements that draw researchers into extra-disciplinary communities. In this regard, Buanes and Jentoft note that interdisciplinary research necessitates a ‘broad repertoire of perspectives acquired through interdisciplinary education or from membership in interdisciplinary research groups’ [9]. Perhaps offering one of the most sophisticated <b>engagements</b> around the <b>temporal</b> dimensions of cross-disciplinarity, they also argue that while structural obstacles to cross-disciplinarity can in principle be speedily addressed, the normative and cognitive barriers cannot. In this respect, they note that, ‘One can prepare the ground for an interdisciplinary culture to emerge, but it typically develops as a by-effect of other initiatives’ ([9], p. 453). In this respect, they emphasise at a variety of junctures, a strong sensitivity to time—one that portrays interdisciplinary learning as journey, where the interdisciplinarian learns and adjusts her perspectives along the way. This kind of approach points towards a more realistic agenda of cross-disciplinary knowledge acquisition, in no small measure because it is premised on a gradual acquisition of knowledge that is feasible and increasingly part of what academics already do [49]. Even for serendipity scholars, the role of time {{plays a key role in}} discovery, where feeling overwhelmed by information can result in key triggers being missed or overlooked [51]. Indeed, for others, who emphasise the variety of barriers (cognitive, normative and structural) confronting scholars prospectively working towards interdisciplinary collaboration there is a similar focus on this a continuing process, one that necessitates time to foster relationships and collaboratively learn with others [29]. In this respect, some emphasise the importance of providing opportunities for researchers from different disciplines to come together in the form of ‘encounters’. Such encounters have the aim of promoting ‘open communication across researchers from different fields’. While such open encounters provide a setting for ‘listening to, being curious of, and understanding each other’s perspectives and potential contributions to joint efforts’, a form of ‘appreciative inquiry’, the emphasis is on creating the conditions where ‘interactions can be fostered between researchers’ ([7], p. 24).|$|R
40|$|When interacting, people imitate each other. This {{tendency}} is truly ubiquitous and occurs {{in many different}} situations and behaviours. But what causes it? Several mechanisms have been proposed to contribute to imitation. In this thesis, I focus on three candidate mechanisms: simulation, temporal adaptation, and the goal to affiliate with others. I start by discussing different imitative behaviours, and reviewing the evidence that imitation might at times emerge spontaneously. I also review the evidence suggesting that the three candidate mechanisms might be involved in such emergent imitation. Then, I present three sets of experiments. In the first set, I investigate the role of simulation in language processing. In three experiments, I test the hypothesis that comprehenders use their language production system to simulate their interlocutor, which in turn facilitates their ability to predict the next word they will see or hear. I manipulate whether participants read the sentences silently or aloud and measure their ability to predict the final word of a sentence. My results demonstrate that prediction is enhanced when people use their production system during reading aloud. This gives some credence {{to the idea that}} simulation is routinely engaged in language processing, which in turn opens up a possibility that it may contribute to linguistic imitation. In the second set of experiments, I investigate whether temporal adaptation leads agents to imitate features of their partner’s actions. In three experiments, I test this by manipulating the partner’s response speed and the information about the partner’s actions. I show that agents imitate response speed when they are able to observe the partner. Moreover, they adapt to the specific temporal pattern of their partner’s actions. These findings provide evidence for the <b>engagement</b> of the <b>temporal</b> adaptation mechanism during motor interactions, and for its involvement in imitation. In the third set of experiments, I turn to the hypothesis that people engage in linguistic imitation because they want to harness the social benefits it brings. I investigate a key assumption of this hypothesis: that imitation has positive consequences for the social interaction. In three experiments, I manipulate whether participants’ word choice is imitated or counter-imitated by their conversational partner and measure how it affects the participants’ evaluation of the interaction and the partner, and their willingness to cooperate with the partner. I find evidence that linguistic imitation has positive social consequences. These results are consonant with the claim that imitation is motivated by the goal to affiliate and foster social relations. Taken together, these findings suggest that imitation might occur both in motor actions and language, and that it might have diverse causes. My work on language suggests that the tendency to linguistically imitate others could both result from the simulation mechanism, and be motivated by the goal to affiliate. My work on motor actions shows that automatic temporal adaptation contributes to emergent imitation during interactions. This research is conducive to the greater aim of cross-examining the currently known mechanisms of imitation...|$|R
40|$|Since its {{inception}} {{as a modern}} nation state in 1970, the Sultanate of Oman has actively pursued a policy of national integration and modernization, smoothing over the region's political cleavages through the practices of heritage. Oman's expanding heritage industry and market for heritage crafts and sites is exemplified by the boom in museums, exhibitions, cultural festivals and the restoration {{of more than a}} hundred forts, castles and citadels. The material forms of national heritage provide the context within which the very foundations of the nation take shape. But the construction of the heritage project in modern Oman has also necessitated the formulation of the public domains of history and Islam as seemingly separate and autonomous, erasing any awareness of the socio-political and ethical relationships that once characterized Ibadi Imamate rule (1913 - 1958) in the region. This dissertation is a study of how forms of history, the re-configuration of temporality and the institutionalization of material heritage (tur&# 257;th) recalibrate the Islamic tradition to requirements of modern political and moral order in Oman. Based primarily on 16 months of ethnographic fieldwork in Muscat, the capital and Nizwa, once the administrative and juridical centre of the Ibadi Imamate, it explores the different ways in which the Oman's past inhabits the present, sustaining an active effect on the configuration of religion and community in the nation state. This study explores the temporal logics embodied in the concept of `tradition,' through following concrete practices of making and reflecting on the past, and the material objects and texts that make these practices possible. Chapter 1 discusses the past as sanctioned by the Nizwa fort in its role as shar&# 299;'a adjudicator, as well as popular written and aural histories during the Imamate. Primarily moral in nature, oriented towards God and salvation and grounded in Ibadi doctrine and practice, the function of history held that the heterogeneity of every-day life's interactions and relationships facilitated by objects and texts could be assessed on the basis of past authoritative and exemplary forms of justice and morality, as embodied by the lives of virtuous forbears such as former Imams as well as the Prophet and his companions. Chapter 2 discusses how cleaving through the temporal assumptions of shar&# 299;'a time, heritage and conservation practices of the secular modern state, reconfigure religion through adopting a <b>temporal</b> <b>engagement</b> with a past that entails a changing teleological future rather than one continuous with an exemplary history. The materiality of objects and sites - including mosques and shari'a manuscripts - once embedded in ethically grounded social practices assumes an iterable and pedagogical mode of representation that cultivates every-day civic virtues, new forms of religiosity and forms of marking time, defining the ethical actions necessary to become an Omani modern through the framework of tradition. In chapter 3, even as the national narrative conditions the way people ethically work on themselves through evoking such forms of heritage as the Nizwa fort, its old suq or the dalla (coffee pot) by way of example, it also generates anxieties and emotional sensibilities that seek to address the erasures and occlusions of the past through deploying alternative temporal logics assuming a dynamic perceptual edge. In chapter 4, an unacknowledged slave legacy, a residue of the shar&# 299;'a past, continues to create unofficial tribal hierarchies through state juridical regulation of marriage and divorce, legally endorsing`customary' marriage practices between `pure' tribal Arabs vs. those descended from slaves or client tribes even as a national past sanctifies civil and political equality. Chapter 5 highlights the active re-configuration of historical memory by a non-Ibadi, non-Arab group, the Lawati, to fit into the national template through a process of Arab tribalization. This dissertation argues that "inhabiting" heritage forms the nexus of competing modes of engagement with material objects and landscapes in Oman even as it mobilizes the very different anxieties that this history offers.
