As a result, Tiana has become absorbed with her work and doesn't have time <b>for</b> <b>anything</b> <b>else.</b> Tiana finds hope when her wealthy childhood best friend Charlotte pays her a lump sum of money to make and serve beignets at a masquerade ball she is hosting for the handsome but disinherited Prince Naveen.|$|E
25|$|Causal determinism: The {{idea that}} {{everything}} is caused by prior conditions, making it impossible <b>for</b> <b>anything</b> <b>else</b> to happen. In its most common form, nomological (or scientific) determinism, future events are necessitated by past and present events combined with the laws of nature. Such determinism is sometimes illustrated by the thought experiment of Laplace's demon. Imagine an entity that knows all facts about {{the past and the}} present, and knows all natural laws that govern the universe. If the laws of nature were determinate, then such an entity would be able to use this knowledge to foresee the future, down to the smallest detail.|$|E
25|$|The Green Sun Princes' {{disadvantage}} is {{that they}} are few in number; only 50 infernal essences are controlled by the Yozis, and they do not yet have the ability to corrupt further Solar Essences as the Deathlords can. On the other hand, the Infernals have the full resources of the demon realm at their disposal, along with numerous Yozi cults which already exist in creation. The Infernals are closely tied to their Yozi masters, and experience Urge, psychological motivations towards missions set by their patrons. Unlike Abyssals, Infernals rarely regret their state, and instead revel in their mission to overthrow the upstart gods and return creation to its original rulers. It is implied, however, that due to the inherently poor treatment by the Yozis (being unable to fully comprehend things outside of their domain and thus with little respect <b>for</b> <b>anything</b> <b>else)</b> and obvious insanity, the vast majority will grow dissatisfied and go rogue, using their link to Primordial power to mutate into new Titans themselves, not bound by the same shortness of vision they possess.|$|E

Between that and my four children, I don't have the time or the energy <b>for</b> <b>anything</b> <b>else.</b> For example, I do appreciate that lots of people worked long and hard putting together things like the DVD of the Sticky & Sweet Tour that we just released, and I have seen the finished product, but I have got no idea how people are going to find out about it or how it's going to be sold." ...|$|E
500|$|Running gags and {{recurring}} segments {{were very}} common in the show. The end of every episode was closed with a water tower gag similar to The Simpsons couch gag. Director Rusty Mills and senior producer Tom Ruegger said that recurring segments like the water tower gag and another segment titled [...] "The Wheel of Morality" [...] eased the production of episodes because the same animated scenes could be used more than once (and, {{in the case of}} the Wheel segments, enabled the producers to add a segment in where there was not room <b>for</b> <b>anything</b> <b>else</b> in the episode).|$|E
500|$|... "Frozen Warnings" [...] was {{included}} in Toby Creswell's compendium 1001 Songs; Creswell wrote, [...] "Just as she had done with The Velvet Underground & Nico, the singer put a new tone into music." [...] In 2013 John Cale curated Life Along the Borderline: A Tribute to Nico at the Brooklyn Academy of Music, which featured songs from The Marble Index and other Nico albums performed by Peaches, Yeasayer, Sharon Van Etten, Meshell Ndegeocello and Cale. Jamie Stewart of Xiu Xiu, has cited the album as an inspiration, writing, [...] "it completely changed my entire view {{of what it was}} possible to do in music", and [...] "you could never mistake it <b>for</b> <b>anything</b> <b>else,</b> which is an astounding thing to be able to do." [...] The album was also a favorite of American musician Elliott Smith.|$|E

500|$|The {{right of}} {{assembly}} was originally {{distinguished from the}} right to petition. In United States v. Cruikshank (1875), the Supreme Court held that [...] "the {{right of the people}} peaceably to assemble for the purpose of petitioning Congress for a redress of grievances, or <b>for</b> <b>anything</b> <b>else</b> connected with the powers or duties of the National Government, is an attribute of national citizenship, and, as such, under protection of, and guaranteed by, the United States. The very idea of a government, republican in form, implies a right on the part of its citizens to meet peaceably for consultation in respect to public affairs and to petition for a redress of grievances." [...] Justice Morrison Waite's opinion for the Court carefully distinguished the right to peaceably assemble as a secondary right, while the right to petition was labeled to be a primary right. Later cases, however, paid less attention to these distinctions.|$|E
500|$|Group members {{expressed}} {{just how}} demanding {{their role in}} the group had been, describing the job as [...] "hard work" [...] and [...] "a tough gig", with touring for nine months of every year and filming the television series for most of the remainder, creating little time in their lives <b>for</b> <b>anything</b> <b>else.</b> Members also saw importance of being [...] "career driven" [...] and in portraying a positive image of themselves to the public in their personal lives, being [...] "always on". However, the cast insisted that the stressful work was well worth it to see a smile on a child's face, and described the bond between the members as [...] "like family". In 2005 Harding stated the lifestyle was [...] "quite hard in the beginning." [...] In October 2015 Robinson stated she had tried to leave the group [...] "after eight years" [...] but was convinced by producers to stay. She expressed that the following years she spent with the group were her favourite, and that she was proud of her decision to continue.|$|E
500|$|... "More than a Woman" [...] and [...] "I Care 4 U" [...] were {{released}} as posthumous singles and peaked within the top 25 of the Billboard Hot 100. The album was certified double Platinum by the RIAA and sold 2.6 {{million copies in}} the United States. [...] "More than a Woman" [...] reached {{number one on the}} UK singles chart making Aaliyah the first female deceased artist to reach number one on the UK singles chart. [...] "More than a Woman" [...] was replaced by George Harrison's [...] "My Sweet Lord" [...] which is the only time in the UK singles chart's history where a dead artist has replaced another dead artist at number one. In July 2001, she allowed MTV's show Diary behind-the-scenes access to her life and stated [...] "I am truly blessed to wake up every morning to do something that I love; there is nothing better than that." [...] She continued, [...] "Everything is worth it – the hard work, the times when you're tired, the times when you are a bit sad. In the end, it's all worth it because it really makes me happy. I wouldn't trade it <b>for</b> <b>anything</b> <b>else</b> in the world. I've got good friends, a beautiful family and I've got a career.

500|$|Rasmussen's {{first task}} was to adjust and arrange the guitar sound with which the band was dissatisfied. A guide track for the tempos and a click track for Ulrich's {{drumming}} were used. The band played in a live room, recording the instruments separately. Each song used three reels: one for drums, a second for bass and guitars and a third <b>for</b> <b>anything</b> <b>else.</b> Hetfield wrote lyrics during the recording sessions; these were occasionally unfinished as recording began, and Rasmussen said that Hetfield [...] "wasn't really interested in singing" [...] but instead [...] "wanted that hard vibe". Metallica's recording process was new to Jason Newsted, who questioned his impact on the overall sound {{and the lack of}} discussion {{with the rest of the}} team. Newsted had a different experience with his previous band, Flotsam and Jetsam, describing their style as [...] "basically everybody playing the same thing like a sonic wall". He recorded his parts separately from the rest of the band, with only the assistant engineer present. Newsted noted that his parts were at the same audio frequency as Hetfield's guitar parts, and this created a [...] " [...] for the same frequency". Steve Thompson, who mixed the album, claims that Ulrich was squarely to blame for the inaudible bass and unusual drums. Thompson wanted to be relieved of his mixing duties when Ulrich presented his ideas on the production, but Thompson was not allowed to leave and received the majority of the criticism for the misrepresentation of bass of the record.|$|E
2500|$|Campbell {{returned}} to Fanø in the summer, but {{the beach was}} in poor condition and crowd control of the spectators was poor. On the first run both rear tyres were ripped off Blue Bird and narrowly missed the crowd.

2500|$|For many years, Beban was typecast as a French {{character}} actor. Beban later recalled, [...] "No {{one will}} ever know what an awful time I had {{to get away from}} French character. I had to live, and for French character parts I could name my own salary, but <b>for</b> <b>anything</b> <b>else</b> I wasn’t worth as much as a chorus man."

2500|$|Gouldman’s {{reputation}} as a hit songwriter {{attracted the attention of}} bubblegum pop producers Jerry Kasenetz and Jeff Katz of Super K Productions, who invited him to New York to write formula bubblegum songs. In what he later called a [...] "creative lowpoint", Gouldman accepted. He recalled: [...] "They wanted me to write and produce for them, so I figured, why not? Nothing else was happening for me at the time. All told I worked for them for three or four periods {{over the course of a}} year, just writing and recording, and had no time <b>for</b> <b>anything</b> <b>else.</b> I was totally involved in the whole Kasenetz-Katz thing while I was with them." ...|$|E
2500|$|If [...] {{is heated}} to 2400°C, it splits into carbon {{monoxide}} (CO) and oxygen. The Fischer-Tropsch process {{can then be}} used to convert the CO into hydrocarbons.

Rival teams are developing such chambers, at Solarec and at Sandia National Laboratories, both based in New Mexico. According to Sandia these chambers could provide enough fuel to power 100% of domestic vehicles using 5800km2; unlike biofuels this would not take fertile land away from crops but would be land that is not being used <b>for</b> <b>anything</b> <b>else.</b> James May, the British TV presenter, visited a demonstration plant in a programme in his Big Ideas series.|$|E
2500|$|Hathcock {{once said}} that he survived in his work because of an ability to [...] "get in the bubble", to put himself {{into a state of}} [...] "utter, complete, {{absolute}} concentration", first with his equipment, then his environment, in which every breeze and every leaf meant something, and finally on his quarry. After the war, a friend showed Hathcock a passage written by Ernest Hemingway: [...] "Certainly there is no hunting like the hunting of man, and those who have hunted armed men long enough and like it, never really care <b>for</b> <b>anything</b> <b>else</b> thereafter." [...] He copied Hemingway's words on a piece of paper. [...] "He got that right," [...] Hathcock said. [...] "It was the hunt, not the killing." [...] Hathcock said in a book written about his career as a sniper: [...] "I like shooting, and I love hunting. But I never did enjoy killing anybody. It's my job. If I don't get those bastards, then they're gonna kill a lot of these kids dressed up like Marines. That's the way I look at it." ...|$|E
