40|$|The thesis {{deals with}} the {{planning}} of the new high-speed railway track Divača-Ljubljana. This section belongs to the planned TEN-T core network, {{so in order to}} place and select the parameters for designing the railway track I had {{to take into account the}} technical specifications for interoperability regarding each subsystem based on Directive 2008 / 57 /EC on the interoperability of the rail system within the Community. The starting point of the new rail link is located just before technical distribution station Divača, where it is linked to the section Trst-Divača, which was determined in a study in 2011. The ending point of discussed rail section is an underground passenger station in Ljubljana. The railway track is intended for international passenger traffic where trains reach speed up to 250 km/h and freight traffic trains travel with speed up to 100 km/h. For the practical part of my thesis I designed railway track according to directions of the Slovenian Standard SIST EN 13803 - 1 : 2010 and TSI on <b>Infrastructure</b> <b>Subsystem.</b> The terms and limit values of the elements in the plan and front view are based on those directions, which are used for planning the high-speed railways.

Furthermore, in order {{to evaluate the effectiveness of}} the Web-based instructional systems, constructed with the proposed model, a summative evaluation method is employed that makes use of pre-test and post-test questionnaires. This evaluation method is briefly presented, together with a summary of its results on the case study course. Finally the proposed model is examined in the context of current standardization efforts in the field of Learning Technology Systems. Specifically it is demonstrated how the model can conform to the Learning Technology System Architecture draft standard of IEEE Learning Technology Standards Committee. In conclusion, the model has shown encouraging results in the four systems it has been applied to. We mean to further elaborate on the model by employing it, to construct more instructional systems.

40|$|AbstractDuring recent decades, {{major public}} road {{authorities}} showed an increasing trend in seeking for alternative ways {{to establish and}} implement road infrastructures concession systems, with the main aim to make it doable in a reliable, socio-economically sustainable and cost effective manner. This phenomenon is mainly due to increasingly higher risks related {{to the establishment of}} road concession system and risk related to the introduction of road toll payment requirements. During the last three years, ANAS International Enterprise S. p. A., a subsidiary company of the Italian Highway Agency ANAS S. p. A., has been appointed for assessing the feasibility and comprehensively structuring road concessions, through the implementation of a Public-Private Partnership (PPP) initiative, for a large part of road network of the Republic of Colombia. The main activities consisted in (i) the development of a financial model, consistent with the rules and economic parameters related to the Colombian market; (ii) the assessment of the economic and financial feasibility; (iii) carrying out studies and simulations for several concessions scenarios implementation, including analysis of risks and technical, financial and legal assessment; (iv) preparation of tender documentation and delivery of technical support to the National Infrastructure Agency during the public-private partnership awarding process. Along with these activities, the implementation of an innovative road concession system allowed the transfer and application of a number of best practices in various sectors. Indeed, improvement on the following aspects have been achieved:•Innovations in construction, including alternative solutions for road embankment slope stabilization; barriers against rock falls; asphalt concrete mixtures modified with polymers;•Technological innovations, including intelligent transport systems, telecommunications and information <b>infrastructure,</b> <b>subsystem</b> tolls, transport operating centers, subsystem video surveillance cameras hotspots, emergency call subsystem, weighing subsystem, lighting systems in urban areas and tolls;•Innovations in financial structuring, including tailor-made regulating financial planning and monitoring tools, introduction of innovative solutions for the use of appropriate discount rates aimed to ensure investor profitability, assessment tool to manage public- and private-sides risks, assessing tools to ensure value for money, implementation of alternative solutions for public participation in Project Financing initiatives, development and implementation of alternative solutions for private funding in the financing process (including structuring infrastructure bonds), adoption of PPP structure type contracts provisions;In this paper, the Authors describe in detail the concession implementation process, by particularly focusing on criteria adopted in selecting the contract type and related aspects, and highlighting main criticalities identified throughout the concession setting up process.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this paper is to present the current status of the {{development}} of the Safety and Tritium Applied Research (STAR) Facility at the Idaho National Engineering and Environmental Laboratory (INEEL). Designated a National User Facility by the US DOE, the primary mission of STAR is to provide laboratory infrastructure to study tritium science and technology issues associated with the development of safe and environmentally friendly fusion energy. Both tritium and non-tritium fusion safety research is pursued along three key thrust areas: (1) plasma-material interactions of plasma-facing component (PFC) materials exposed to energetic tritium and deuterium ions, (2) fusion safety concerns related to PFC material chemical reactivity and dust/debris generation, activation product mobilization, and tritium behavior in fusion systems, and (3) molten salts and fusion liquids for tritium breeder and coolant applications. STAR comprises a multi-room complex with operations segregated to permit both tritium and non-tritium activities in separately ventilated rooms. Tritium inventory in STAR is limited to 15, 000 Ci to maintain its classification as a Radiological Facility. Experiments with tritium are typically conducted in glovebox environments. Key components of the tritium infrastructure have been installed and tested. This includes the following subsystems: (1) a tritium Storage and Assay System (SAS) that uses two 50 -g depleted uranium beds for tritium storage and PVT/beta-scintillation analyses for tritium accountability measurements, (2) a Tritium Cleanup System (TCS) that uses catalytic oxidation and molecular sieve water absorption to remove tritiated species from glovebox atmosphere gases and gaseous effluents from experiment and process systems, and (3) tritium monitoring instrumentation for room air, glovebox atmosphere and stack effluent tritium concentration measurements. Integration of the tritium <b>infrastructure</b> <b>subsystems</b> with the experimental and laboratory process systems is planned for early in 2004. Following an operational readiness review, tritium operations will be initiated in the summer of 2004. Summary results of the performance testing of the tritium <b>infrastructure</b> <b>subsystems</b> and their integration into the laboratory operations will be presented at this conference. Current research activity includes plasma-material interaction studies with the Tritium Plasma Experiment (TPE) and tritium/chemistry interactions in the molten salt designated as Flibe (2 ·LiF-BeF 2).

40|$|AbstractIn {{the last}} ten years, an {{efficient}} Security Management System (SEMS) has acquired an important role for organizations working in transportation sector. In many cases, Critical Infrastructure legislation plans specific and mandatory quality requirements {{for the implementation of}} a security management system. The organizations are encouraged by the legislative requirements and the competitiveness to certify the SEMS in accordance with the current international standards (e. g. ISO 27001 and ISO 28000). As well known, certification can be either a mandatory or a voluntary process but it is usually voluntary and qualitative. In the SEMS, as in other management systems, current certification uses a qualitative approach deriving from the ISO 9000. Normally in certification, quantitative assessment characterizes only some technological systems while every other application including human factor or procedures uses qualitative assessment. The development of security management system certification should bring to introducing risk-based and quantitative assessment methods. Benefits arising from the residual risk quantification of the SEMS can set certification a tool enabling to bargain with insurances, a warranty for the investments undertaken when facing stakeholders and shareholders, a proof to justify decisions during a legal action and last but not least a good publicity for company's image and hence company's competitiveness. This paper proposes the implementation of risk-based methodologies in use by process engineering to achieve a quantitative assessment of security management systems. The methodology is exposed and applied to a railway case study. The first steps show how to analyze the system (study of macro operability functions, identification of subsystems, etc.) and how to integrate technological, human and procedural aspects by flow charts. The later steps describe how to manage threats, vulnerability and criticality of Critical <b>Infrastructure</b> <b>subsystems</b> and how to identify “primary causes” and “Top Event consequences” drawing fault trees and event trees, and finally how to calculate the residual risk for security management system. In conclusion, the methodology is applied on a case study of one railway subsystem and the results of the quantitative risk analysis are exposed...|$|R

Although local field research {{is common in}} geography undergraduate curriculum, it rarely uses holistic approach to teaching sustainability science through community-based applied research and service learning. GVSU geographers have embarked upon a journey to build a sustainable university campus integrating geography and planning curriculum and undergraduate student research with campus infrastructure and community development plans. This paper examines specific examples, such as GVSU Sustainable Agriculture Project, Storm-Water Management System Plan, and Climate Action Plan that were used as opportunities to integrate university institutional policies and campus infrastructure projects with geography courses through undergraduate student research. Each case study analyzes three aspects of sustainability education: learning and assessing sustainable practices, applying geographic research to improve campus infrastructure, and integrating community- based research with civic engagement.

A key challenge is how to select a cost-effective communication system without compromising {{the performance of the}} applications. Current communication technologies were developed for conventional data networks with different requirements. It is therefore necessary to investigate how much of existing communication technologies can be retrofitted into the new energy infrastructure to cost-effectively deliver acceptable level of service. This paper investigates broadband power line communications (BPLC) as a backhaul solution in AMI. By applying the disparate traffic characteristics of selected AMI applications, the network performance is evaluated. This study also examines the communication network response to changes in application configurations in terms of packet sizes. In each case, the network is stress-tested and performance is assessed against acceptable thresholds documented in the literature. Results show that, like every other communication technology, BPLC has certain limitations; however, with some modifications in the network topology, it indeed can fulfill most AMI traffic requirements for flexible and time-bounded applications. These opportunities, if tapped, can significantly improve fiscal and operational efficiencies in AMI services. Simulation results also reveal that BPLC as a backhaul can support flat and clustered AMI structures with cluster size ranging from 1 to 150 smart meters...|$|R

40|$|The {{strategy}} for accomplishing civilian exploration {{goals and objectives}} {{is in the process}} of a fundamental shift towards a potential new approach called Flexible Path. This paper suggests that a government-industry or public-private partnership in the commercial development of low Earth orbit to geostationary orbit (LEO-to-GEO (LTG)) space, following or in parallel with the commercialization of Earth-to-LEO and International Space Station (ISS) operations, could serve as a necessary, logical step that can be incorporated into the flexible path approach. A LTG satellite-servicing infrastructure and architecture concept is discussed within this new strategic context. The concept consists of a space harbor that serves as a transport facility for a fleet of specialized, fully- or semi-autonomous robotic servicing spacecraft. The baseline, conceptual system architecture is composed of a space harbor equipped with specialized servicer spacecraft; a satellite command, communication, and control system; a parts station; a fuel station or depot; and a fuel/parts replenishment transport. The commercial servicer fleet would consist of several types of spacecraft, each designed with specialized robotic manipulation subsystems to provide services such as refueling, upgrade, repair, inspection, relocation, and removal. The space harbor is conceptualized as an ISS-type, octagonal truss structure equipped with radiation tolerant subsystems. This space harbor would be primarily capable of serving as an operational platform for various commercially owned and operated servicer spacecraft positioned and docked symmetrically on four of the eight sides. Several aspects of this concept are discussed, such as: system-level feasibility in terms of ISS-truss-type <b>infrastructure</b> and <b>subsystems</b> emplacement and maintenance between LEO and GEO; infrastructure components assembly in LEO, derived from ISS assembly experience, and transfer to various higher orbital locations; the evolving Earth-to-orbit (ETO) capability to deliver humans and cargo to LEO for assembly purposes; system architectural definition, optimal orbital parameters, mass estimations, delta velocity (V) estimations, power and propulsion options, and assessments of various critical technologies. Large-scale, robotic, LTG satellite servicing is considered as an essential economic pre-condition and next parallel or sequential step on the road toward exploration beyond LEO. Such a step might produce the necessary pre-requisite economic value that can be used by future decision makers to justify further investment in exploration beyond LEO...|$|R
