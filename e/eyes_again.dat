5|$|The video {{starts with}} Farmer slowly walking in an {{laboratory}} {{in which many}} animals are captive to serve as experiments. Depicting a supernatural creature, the singer approaches every cage {{to look at all}} the animals — pigeons, cats, bobcats, rabbits, mouses, a snake, an owl, a monkey, a doe — and heals them with her magic hands. Then she takes a wounded little cat out of its cage and puts it on her shoulders. During the second refrain, she remains standing with closed eyes {{in the middle of the}} room and uses her supernatural powers to explode all of the glass cages. She thus releases the animals and, with a monkey in her arms, leads them outside into the woods. Standing in the forest, she closes her <b>eyes</b> <b>again</b> and sends many rays of light from her hands. The last scene shows the Earth being covered by that light.|$|E
25|$|Additional {{evidence}} {{is provided by}} the eyes of ichthyosaurs that among vertebrates are both relatively and absolutely the largest known. Modern Leopard seals can dive to up to one kilometre hunting on sight. Motani suggested that ichthyosaurs, with their relatively much larger eye sockets, {{should have been able to}} reach even greater depths. Temnodontosaurus, with eyes that had a diameter of twenty-five centimetres, could probably still see at a depth of 1600 meters. At these depths, such eyes would have been especially useful to see large objects. Later species, such as Ophthalmosaurus, had relatively larger <b>eyes,</b> <b>again</b> an indication that diving capacity was better in late Jurassic and Cretaceous forms.|$|E
2500|$|Snake <b>Eyes</b> <b>again</b> {{appears as}} part of the [...] toy series. Although similar in concept to the earlier [...] toyline, the Sigma 6 action figures do not tie into the {{continuity}} of the original G.I. Joe universe, and were 8" [...] in height rather than the smaller 3 ¾" [...] scale figures of the A Real American Hero line.|$|E

2500|$|Meanwhile, Storm Shadow {{tries to}} stop Cobra from {{liberating}} prisoners from the G.I. Joe prison facility [...] "The Coffin". He is partially successful, but Tomax manages to free Firefly and several others, while killing those Cobra Commander considered [...] "loose ends". Storm Shadow then joins Snake Eyes {{and the rest}} of the main team in defeating several Cobra cells, and disarming nuclear weapons that Cobra Commander has placed in the Amazon and Antarctica. Cobra Commander and The Plague retreat to a secret base in the Appalachian Mountains, where the final battle takes place, and Snake <b>Eyes</b> <b>again</b> defeats Firefly in a sword duel. In the end, Snake Eyes is shown among the members of the fully restored G.I. Joe team.|$|E
2500|$|Many of Zinzendorf's {{beliefs and}} acts were based upon his father's words: “I live no more; {{he lives in}} me. I speak no more; he speaks in me. When you speak with me, you speak with him. When you have love for me, so too you have love for him, and when you hate me, so too you hate him, {{and when you have}} a word from me, so too you have it from him.” [...] Seeing Christ in Christian's eyes is a theme from the period in poetry, {{painting}} and engraving. An engraving complete with his portrait states that one can see the departed Christ by looking at Christel's forehead, meaning his eyes. A portrait of him now in the Moravian Archives in Herrnhut, Germany, includes the words Gebrochne Augen(broken <b>eyes),</b> <b>again</b> referring to seeing Christ at the moment of death in Christian's eyes, or at the moment of his completed sacrifice.|$|E
