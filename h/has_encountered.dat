5|$|At times, Beecher's <b>has</b> <b>encountered</b> {{challenges}} in maintaining this uniform standard. For example, when flooding affected one farm, the cows there produced enzymes in their milk that helped their calves {{to fight off}} bacteria, but changed {{the flavor of the}} milk.|$|E
5|$|In 1998 a new two-tier Anfield Road end was opened. The stand <b>has</b> <b>encountered</b> {{a number}} of {{problems}} since its redevelopment; {{at the beginning of the}} 1999–2000 season, a series of support poles and stanchions had to be brought in to give extra stability to the top tier of the stand. During Ronnie Moran's testimonial match against Celtic, many fans complained of movement of the top tier. At the same time that the stanchions were inserted, the executive seating area was expanded by two rows in the main stand, lowering the seating capacity in the paddock.|$|E
5|$|In recent years, San Sebastian Church <b>has</b> <b>encountered</b> {{threats to}} its {{structural}} integrity. The steel structure has been beset by rust and corrosion due to sea breezes from nearby Manila Bay. State funding was accorded {{to the church}} through the National Historical Institute which undertook restoration in 1982. The Recollect community has likewise expended funds for the church's maintenance and restoration. In 1998, it {{was placed on the}} biennial watchlist of the 100 Most Endangered Sites by the World Monuments Fund, though it was not retained in the subsequent watchlists.|$|E
40|$|The {{research}} {{was carried out}} with the participation of teachers working in Gaziantep and was a qualitative study with a maximum variation sample. The data were obtained by focus group interviews. According {{to the analysis of}} the data, the issues experienced by the participants on the forum pages are collected under four categories: character, aggression, obsession and disrespect. In character category, the participants reported that they <b>had</b> <b>encountered</b> irresponsibility, selfishness, lie, causticity; in aggression category, the participants reported they <b>had</b> <b>encountered</b> violation of private life, provocation, sexual harassment, defamation and bullying; in obsession category, the participants reported they <b>had</b> <b>encountered</b> monomania, dependency and trap; in disrespect category the participants reported that they <b>had</b> <b>encountered</b> violation of the right to speak and illegal file sharin...|$|R

5|$|The Latin American lesbian {{movement}} {{has been the most}} active in Mexico, but <b>has</b> <b>encountered</b> similar problems in effectiveness and cohesion. While groups try to promote lesbian issues and concerns, they also face misogynistic attitudes from gay men and homophobic views from heterosexual women. In 1977, Lesbos, the first lesbian organization for Mexicans, was formed. Several incarnations of political groups promoting lesbian issues have evolved; 13 lesbian organizations were active in Mexico City in 1997. Ultimately, however, lesbian associations have had little influence both on the homosexual and feminist movements.|$|E
5|$|The media hype he <b>has</b> <b>encountered</b> has led Tavares {{to remain}} guarded when {{speaking}} to the media, while his teammates and family attempt to shield him from the spotlight where they can. However, Tavares {{is regarded as a}} natural leader on the ice, and a player who puts his team first. The Oshawa Generals named Tavares their team captain in 2008, while he also served as the alternate captain with the Canadian junior team in 2009.|$|E
5|$|Due to its graphic content, Ultime grida dalla savana <b>has</b> <b>encountered</b> {{censorship}} {{issues with}} certain countries' film boards. In Australia, the Office of Film and Literature Classification (OFLC) banned both an uncut and cut {{version of the}} film in 1976. An appeal filed later that year was denied. Ten years later, the home video distributor Palace Video brought the same cut print before the film board and it received an R18+ rating. The cuts include segments from the lion attack, the torture and murder of the indigenous man by mercenaries, {{the death of a}} fox by a pack of hounds, and the death of a stag by a hunter in the opening scene.|$|E

Dr. Crusher is puzzled and full of emotion as she later confides to Counselor Deanna Troi (Marina Sirtis) and wonders about the true depth of her feelings for Odan. With some effort, Odan in Riker's body manages to convince the delegates from the warring planets to work with him. However, Riker's body begins to deteriorate due to the incompatibility of different biologies. The ship transporting the new host <b>has</b> <b>encountered</b> engine malfunctions. Dr. Crusher does everything she can to extend Riker's and Odan's chances while the Enterprise races to meet the Trill ship, and has a deeply emotional moment with Captain Picard.|$|E
5|$|Season two began airing in the United States on October 4, 2007, and {{featured}} 15 episodes. The {{second season}} was {{originally intended to}} consist of 22 episodes, but the order was cut to 15 due to the 2007–2008 Writers Guild of America strike. The season finale aired on May 8, 2008. After Liz broke up with Floyd in the summer, she is {{looking for ways to}} rebound. When Jerry Seinfeld confronts Jack about a new marketing campaign which featured clips of Seinfeld's sitcom, Seinfeld, in all NBC shows, he has a chance encounter with Liz that gives her some much-needed advice. During the TGS summer hiatus, Jenna becomes overweight due to performing in the Broadway show Mystic Pizza: The Musical (based on the real 1988 film Mystic Pizza). Tracy <b>has</b> <b>encountered</b> some marital problems with his wife Angie Jordan (Sherri Shepherd) and they become separated, but later reunite.|$|E
5|$|Strickland did {{not take}} into account the swampy lowland and high water table that characterizes the terrain around New Orleans, and so during its career the New Orleans Mint {{building}} <b>has</b> <b>encountered</b> numerous structural problems from the shifting soil beneath its foundation. In the 1840s the building was reinforced with iron rods inserted between the floors. In 1854, the federal government hired West Point engineering graduate (and Louisiana native) Pierre Gustave Toutant Beauregard to fireproof the building, rebuild the arches supporting the basement ceiling and install masonry flooring. Beauregard completed the work in conjunction with Captain Johnson K. Duncan by 1859. During this period, the Mint's heavy machinery was converted to steam power so a smokestack (since demolished) was built at the rear of the structure to carry away the fumes.|$|E

5|$|The Oberon's log {{reveals that}} the apes on board, led by Semos, {{organized}} a mutiny and {{took control of the}} vessel after it crashed. The human and ape survivors of the struggle left the ship and their descendants are the people Leo <b>has</b> <b>encountered</b> since landing. The apes arrive and attack the humans who have gathered to see Leo, although he is able to even the odds when he uses the Oberons last fragments of fuel to fire a final blast at the first wave of apes. The battle is halted as a familiar vehicle descends from the sky and is identified immediately by Leo. The pod is piloted by Pericles, the chimp astronaut. Pericles was pushed forward in time as Leo was, and had just now found his way to the planet. When Pericles lands and the pod opens, the apes interpret his arrival as the return of Semos, the first ape, who is their god. They bow, and hostilities between humans and apes suddenly cease.|$|E
5|$|The {{prospect}} of developing such large tourist accommodations <b>has</b> <b>encountered</b> concerns from both APSARA and the ICC, claiming that previous tourism {{developments in the}} area have neglected construction regulations and more of these projects {{have the potential to}} damage landscape features. Also, the large scale of these projects have begun to threaten the quality of the nearby town's water, sewage, and electricity systems. It has been noted that such high frequency of tourism and growing demand for quality accommodations in the area, such as the development of a large highway, has had a direct effect on the underground water table, subsequently straining the structural stability of the temples at Angkor Wat. Locals of Siem Reap have also voiced concern that the charm and atmosphere of their town have been compromised in order to entertain tourism. Since this local atmosphere is the key component to projects like Angkor Tourist City, the local officials continue to discuss how to successfully incorporate future tourism without sacrificing local values and culture.|$|E
5|$|Dropped {{into the}} swamp where Keyes and his squad disappeared, the Master Chief discovers that the Captain has been {{captured}} and {{both human and}} Covenant soldiers have been turned into zombie-like creatures by bulbous aliens. One soldier, Private Wallace Jenkins, is left still semi-conscious and painfully aware of his predicament, unable to control his movement or actions as his former friends and he attack McKay's troops. Jenkins intends on ending his life, but is instead captured by McKay for study. The Chief is approached by Halo's resident A.I., 343 Guilty Spark, who informs the Chief that the creatures he <b>has</b> <b>encountered</b> are called the Flood, a virulent parasite that infects hosts and converts them into either forms for combat, or for reproduction. To activate Halo's defenses, Guilty Spark needs the Master Chief's help. In Halo's Control Room, Guilty Spark gives the Master Chief the key to activate Halo, but is stopped by a furious Cortana. Cortana explains that Halo is a weapon, but it doesn't kill the Flood- it kills their food, meaning humans, Covenant, and any other sentient life. Realizing {{that they have to}} stop Guilty Spark from activating Halo, Cortana and the Master Chief decide to destroy Halo by detonating the crash-landed Pillar of Autumns fusion reactors. In order to do this, they need Captain Keyes' neural implants. Cortana discovers the Captain is still alive, held prisoner once again aboard the Truth and Reconciliation, {{now in the hands of}} the Flood who are trying to escape Halo. The Chief fights Covenant and Flood to the Captain, but finds out he is too late—the Captain has been assimilated into the parasite. The Chief retrieves the implants and leaves the Truth for the Autumn.|$|E

The angle Sun-Earth-MEX reached a minimum on 23-Oct at 0.39 deg. {{at a distance}} of 2.66 AU. Operational measures were undertaken to minimize the impact of the link degradation, since the higher density of electrons in the solar plasma heavily impacts the radio frequency signal.|$|E

50|$|Further {{evidence}} {{has shown that}} artificial techniques {{can be used to}} trick people into believing they <b>have</b> <b>encountered</b> a stimulus previously. In one experiment, participants were presented symbols which consisted of highly familiarly symbols, less familiar symbols and novel symbols. Participants were required to report whether they <b>had</b> <b>encountered</b> any of the symbols presented before the experiment. A 35 millisecond flash preceded each symbol, in which the same, different or no symbol was flashed. It was found that the brief flash of stimulus boosted the fluency of the target item. When the same symbol was flashed, participants’ ratings of <b>having</b> <b>encountered</b> the symbol previously increased. This example illustrates that fluent processing can induce a feeling of familiarity.|$|R
25|$|Fundamentalism and {{political}} realism are diplomatically incompatible. It {{is believed that}} the most evident characteristic of diplomacy is flexibility. The reason Iran’s diplomacy <b>has</b> <b>encountered</b> many shortcomings and lost numerous opportunities provided by international or regional political developments is the country’s focus on fundamental values and neglect of national interests. Fundamentalism is always accompanied with idealism while diplomacy always emphasizes realities. Therefore, the model of realistic fundamentalism will not work in the diplomatic arena.|$|E
