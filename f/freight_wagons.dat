5|$|A bromine {{extraction}} {{plant was}} opened in Amlwch in 1953 by Associated Ethyl (soon renamed Associated Octel, and later {{part of the}} Great Lakes Chemical Corporation). Chlorine produced at a plant in Ellesmere Port was brought by rail to Amlwch, which was used to extract bromine from sea water. The resulting ethylene dibromide was taken from Amlwch by rail as well. The company built a light railway through the town to Amlwch station, and a marshalling yard for exchanging <b>freight</b> <b>wagons.</b>|$|E
40|$|AbstractThis paper {{describes}} {{the development of}} a virtual <b>freight</b> <b>wagon</b> vehicle using virtual prototyping computer tools. The <b>freight</b> <b>wagon</b> considered as open type wagon “BOXN 25 ” of the Indian Railways. The <b>freight</b> <b>wagon</b> vehicle comprises of car body structure and two bogies. Solidworks is used for modeling the <b>freight</b> <b>wagon</b> and the geometry is exported to finite element tool, ANSYS. A multi degree of freedom system has been reviewed and compared with system having infinite degree of freedom (continuous structure). The current problem falls in the category of large models (Block Lanczos Algorithm is used) and has high degrees of freedom (PCG Solver is used). The structural dynamic response for the virtual <b>freight</b> <b>wagon</b> is determined. It is seen that the car body deformation is influenced by its elastic underframe and sidewalls. The influence of vibration modes, which describe local deflection, on the comfort level and stability of laden goods is discussed. Mode shapes up to a frequency of 30 Hz are considered...|$|R

The first part is {{addressed to the}} introduction of a modified <b>freight</b> <b>wagon</b> bogie. There are described conditions for rail vehicles approval and mainly load cases which every bogie must meet for commissioning. The next part deals with computer modelling and analyses of a frame of this modified <b>freight</b> <b>wagon</b> bogie. It was analysed using the FE method and calculations were focused on the assessment of stresses of the frame structure under exceptional load.

25|$|As Engström {{had a lot}} {{of earlier}} {{experience}} about rolling stock, his contribution on company's railway wagon building was significant. Wagon building balanced the wintertime pits in demand. The main customer was Finnish State Railways and the other customers were private railway operators with the standard 5 ft and narrow gauges. The company produced mainly <b>freight</b> <b>wagons,</b> but also some passenger coaches. The wagon production was ended in 1916, by when the company had built 1,980 closed and 963 open <b>freight</b> <b>wagons</b> and 80 coaches. This makes Hietalahti Shipyard and Engineering Works the second biggest producer of railway wagons in Finland until then, right after the State Railways' Engineering Works.|$|E
25|$|Belgian {{coaches and}} <b>freight</b> <b>wagons</b> were ordered in 1922, plus fifty {{locomotives}} from Henschel & Sohn, a German company in Cassel (today spelt Kassel). Later 25 more locomotives were bought from the Baldwin Locomotive Works in Philadelphia, U.S.A.|$|E

25|$|Clement and Henry Studebaker, Jr., became blacksmiths and foundrymen in South Bend, Indiana, in February 1852. They {{first made}} metal parts for <b>freight</b> <b>wagons</b> and later {{expanded}} into {{the manufacture of}} complete wagons. At this time, John M. was making wheelbarrows in Placerville, California. The site of his business is California Historic Landmark #142.|$|E

50|$|Loads {{had to be}} evenly balanced. If {{a farmer}} wanted to send a cow to market, {{he would have to}} send two calves to balance it, which would travel back on {{opposite}} sides of the same <b>freight</b> <b>wagon,</b> thereby balancing each other.|$|R
50|$|Neal himself owned a Conestoga {{outfit and}} with Jack Andrews, a neighbor, made {{frequent}} trips to Philadelphia {{during which he}} was exposed to constant danger of attack by bands of Indians, for the capture of a heavily laden <b>freight</b> <b>wagon</b> yielded much booty.|$|R
25|$|Another {{took place}} from 25–30 May 2008 with a Sixties theme. The Locomotion museum was opened at Shildon, County Durham {{providing}} undercover collection care facilities for more rail vehicles (particularly <b>freight</b> <b>wagons)</b> from the museum's collection. In addition, the museum had a high-profile campaign, {{supported by the}} National Heritage Memorial Fund, to purchase Flying Scotsman which arrived at the Museum as the climax of Railfest.|$|E
25|$|The {{supplies}} {{gathered at}} the quartermaster depot were shipped throughout the southwest via river boats and overland on mule team <b>freight</b> <b>wagons.</b> Up to 900 mules were kept in stables at Yuma Quartermaster Depot. The arrival of the Southern Pacific Railroad in Yuma in 1877 signaled {{the end of the}} depot. When the railroad reached Tucson in 1880, the quartermaster depot was closed. The quartermasters moved to Fort Lowell in Tucson.|$|E
25|$|Another {{solution}} to loss of brake pressure is the two-pipe system, fitted on most modern passenger stock and many <b>freight</b> <b>wagons.</b> In {{addition to the}} traditional brake pipe, this enhancement adds the main reservoir pipe, which is continuously charged with air directly from the locomotive's main reservoir. The main reservoir is where the locomotive's air compressor output is stored, and is ultimately the source of compressed air for all systems that use it.|$|E
50|$|Unitrain MRC was {{acquired}} in 1997 specialising in coal transportation; the main activity of this organisation is the leasing of freight cars, particularly coal wagons.

5000|$|On 22 December 1894 {{a strong}} wind blew a high-sided <b>freight</b> <b>wagon</b> into violent contact with other wagons, causing one to {{overturn}} and block the main line. An express train between London and Manchester collided with the wagon. 14 people were killed, and 48 injured.|$|R
25|$|In the 1990s a sharp {{decrease}} in traffic {{led to a}} period of large surpluses when only the best wagons were used. Many of the worst were either scrapped or cannibalized to maintain the others. At the time of independence, the number of <b>freight</b> <b>wagons</b> in Kazakhstan {{was estimated to be}} 128,000. In 2001, the number was down to 78,000. Of those, at least 30% and probably more were out of service. About 43% of the remaining wagons were over 20 years old.|$|E
25|$|The {{government}} began refurbishing and investing {{heavily in the}} country's freight network from 2014, beginning with the re-nationalisation of the Belgrano Cargas freight operator. Further investment of US$2.5 billion has been agreed with China {{in an effort to}} improve freight capacity throughout Argentina and refurbish ageing track segments. Through this investment, the government ordered 1000 <b>freight</b> <b>wagons</b> from Argentine state-owned company Fabricaciones Militares, while the deal with China included the purchase of 100 locomotives and 3,500 carriages from the country. This investment was doubled to US$ 4.8 billion in September 2015.|$|E
