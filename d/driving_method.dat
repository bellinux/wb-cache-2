40|$|Today, pigs {{are moved}} between farms, cities, {{national}} borders and abattoirs. Nevertheless, {{the scientific literature}} {{on the effectiveness of}} different <b>driving</b> <b>methods</b> and the potential impact on the welfare of pigs is inadequate. Scientific evaluations in this subject are therefore extremely important in order to ensure the best handling practices for both the welfare of the pig and the handlers. The aim {{of this study was to}} research the use of common handling practices when driving pigs in Sweden and how they affect the pig welfare. I also wanted to investigate the efficiency of various <b>driving</b> <b>methods.</b> The objective of this study is to open a discussion about how common <b>driving</b> <b>methods</b> can be improved for both pigs and the people handling them. For instance, improved <b>driving</b> <b>methods</b> can give these people more control over their work situation, which result in better animal welfare. A total of 112 finishing pigs was used in four studies to assess the efficiency of various moving methods by evaluation of pig behaviour and time to complete a standardized course. The pigs were divided into 12 groups which was exposed for each method twice. In the first method, method A, the pigs were touched with a plastic paddle in a low frequency. In method B, the pigs were touched with a plastic paddle in a high frequency. In <b>method</b> C, a <b>driving</b> board was used by walking behind the pigs. In method D, the pigs were driven forward by walking in front of them with a bucket of pig pellets. Method B was the most time efficient method (p 0, 05). However, both method C and D showed fewer stress-related behaviours than method B. Previous studies have shown that more behavioural transitions can be sign of stress. This can be shown in my study as well regarding method B which also registered a high amount of stress-related behaviours. Considering there are no statistical difference between method A and B regarding stress-related behaviours, one can conclude that method A is potentially stressful for the pigs as well. Conclusion; the most time efficient methods are also the most stressful which effects the animal welfare. Therefor more research has to be done regarding <b>driving</b> <b>methods</b> that are time efficient, animal welfare friendly and improves the work situation...|$|R

The quality of product gears is controlled by a gear-measuring instrument, which is calibrated by an involute artefact with high precision. A highly precise method for measuring the involute artefact by rolling has been proposed. However, this method does not yield sufficient accuracy. In this research, a novel rolling method for the involute artefact, a 'nonslip driving method', is proposed to achieve high accuracy.

40|$|Fast {{response}} {{liquid crystal}} display can improve motion picture quality and power efficiency. One {{of the most important}} applications is field-sequential-color display. The maximum relaxation time of such liquid crystal device must be less than a few milliseconds (i. e. < 3 ms). In this thesis, three different approaches, which are liquid crystal configuration, alignment layer and <b>driving</b> <b>method,</b> are explored in order to enhance the optical response of the liquid crystal device. A liquid crystal configuration called Stressed Splay Twist (SST) mode is investigated. It exhibits strong and fast optical bounce due to back-flow effect. It is also found that such fast optical transient effect, i. e. < 1. 5 ms, can be controlled by the two voltages <b>driving</b> <b>method</b> effectively. A SST mode field-sequential-color display with QVGA resolution is fabricated. In order to further improve the electro-optical properties of the SST mode, a stacked alignment layer is proposed as well. It is composed of 2 alignment layers which have different preferred alignment directions. Such alignment configuration is capable of generating multiple pretilt angles or azimuth angles on the same substrate. By using such alignment layers, the relaxation path of the SST mode is modified so that two voltages <b>driving</b> <b>method</b> can be avoided. Finally, a modified passive matrix display driving scheme is proposed. The typical response time of the passive matrix liquid crystal device is about 50 ms to 200 ms.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{the analysis of}} a new multi-oscillated current resonant type DC-DC converter. Current resonant converters have several remarkable features such as high efficiency, small size, low cost and low noise, and are frequently employed in many portable electronic systems such as personal computers, cellular phones and flat panel displays. The current resonant type converter generally employs pulse frequency modulation for constant voltage control in the output. For this reason, the magnetizing current through the converter not only causes a power loss under a light load, but also a loss during stand-by. Therefore, this type of converter has a problem in that the required smaller size cannot be achieved, because an auxiliary source is necessary for stand-by. In order to solve these problems, a new current resonant type power supply is proposed in which two <b>driving</b> <b>methods</b> are employed. In these <b>driving</b> <b>methods,</b> one MOSFET as a main switch is driven by an auxiliary winding of the transformer and another MOSFET as a main switch {{is driven by the}} driving IC with a low withstand voltage.

40|$|Once {{natural gas}} liquids (NGLs) have been {{separated}} from natural gas stream, they are further separated into their component parts, or fractions, using a distillation process known as fractionation. Distillation is the primary separation process widely used in the natural gas processing. Although it has many advantages, the main drawback is its large energy requirement, which can significantly influence the overall plant profitability. Another question {{that needs to be}} answered here is there any systematic study and analysis to improve energy saving for the NGLs fractionation plant without having major modifications to the separation units, which is more practical to implement. The large energy requirement of these processes can be systematically reduced by determining the optimal sequence using <b>driving</b> force <b>method.</b> Therefore, the objective {{of this paper is to}} present the study and analysis of the energy saving improvement for the NGLs fractionation plant by using <b>driving</b> force <b>method</b> which will require only minor or less modifications to the separation units. Generally, the concept of driving force was applied in designing an energy efficient distillation column [Gani and Bek-Pedersen, 2004]. However, the concept has been extended its application in designing energy efficient distillation columns sequence [Mustafa et. al., 2014]. To perform the studies and analysis, the energy efficient NGLs fractionation plant methodology is developed. Basically, the methodology consists of four hierarchical steps. In the first step, the energy that is obtained from the base NGLs sequence will be used as guidance for the next step where the base NGLs sequence is developed from a simple and reliable short-cut method. In the second step, the energy efficiency in distillation column will be improved through <b>driving</b> force <b>method</b> where the optimum sequence will be determined in this step. In the third step, the optimum sequence was analyzed in term of energy analysis by using a simple and reliable shortcut method distillation column in Aspen HYSYS environment. In the final step, the comparison between the existing sequence and the optimum sequence by using <b>driving</b> force <b>method</b> will be done and at the same time the economic performance for the optimum sequence is also evaluated in this step. Then, the return of investment (ROI) will be calculated to make sure that the proposed modification to improve energy saving is practical. The capability of this methodology is tested in designing an optimal energy efficient distillation columns sequence of NGLs fractionation unit. The existing NGLs fractionation unit consists of nine compounds (methane, ethane, propane, i-butane, nbutane, i-pentane, n-pentane, n-hexane, n-heptane) with direct-splitter-direct sequence was simulated using a simple and reliable short-cut method within Aspen HYSYS environment.
