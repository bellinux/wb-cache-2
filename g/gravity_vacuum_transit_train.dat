50|$|After the Berlin Blockade <b>transit</b> <b>trains</b> (link=no) {{would leave}} and enter West Berlin only via one line through Berlin-Wannsee railway station (W) and Potsdam Griebnitzsee railway station (E). All <b>transit</b> <b>trains</b> would start or end in East Berlin, passing through West Berlin {{with only one}} stop in the Western Berlin Zoologischer Garten railway station, which became West Berlin's main railway station. Until 1952, the Reichsbahn also {{permitted}} stops at other stations on {{the way through the}} Western sectors. After easing of tensions between East and West Germany, starting on 30 May 1976 <b>transit</b> <b>trains</b> going westwards, southwestwards, or southwards stopped once again at Wannsee. For <b>transit</b> <b>trains</b> going northwestwards, a shorter line was reopened on 26 September 1976 with an additional stop at the then Berlin-Spandau railway station, entering East Germany at Staaken.|$|R

50|$|Interzone trains {{passed through}} Oebisfelde, but no <b>transit</b> <b>trains</b> (Transitzüge, trains running between West Berlin and West Germany without {{stopping}} in East Germany) passed through Oebisfelde. <b>Transit</b> <b>trains</b> on the Hanover-Berlin route ran via the more southerly border crossing between Helmstedt and Marienborn on the Brunswick-Magdeburg railway (near the Helmstedt-Marienborn road border crossing). A typical route of an interzone train passing through Oebisfelde was the Cologne-Leipzig route. In 1959, two interzone trains ran daily, with {{three in the}} summer.|$|R
40|$|Longitudinal {{acceleration}} comfort {{is one of}} {{the essential}} metrics used to evaluate the ride comfort of train. The aim {{of this study was to}} investigate the effectiveness of using hand grip force as a correlate of longitudinal acceleration comfort of rapid <b>transit</b> <b>trains.</b> In the paper, a motion simulation system was set up and a two-stage experiment was designed to investigate the role of the grip force on the longitudinal comfort of rapid <b>transit</b> <b>trains.</b> The results of the experiment show that the incremental grip force was linearly correlated with the longitudinal acceleration value, while the incremental grip force had no correlation with the direction of the longitudinal acceleration vector. The results also show that the effects of incremental grip force and acceleration duration on the longitudinal comfort of rapid <b>transit</b> <b>trains</b> were significant. Based on multiple regression analysis, a step function model was established to predict the longitudinal comfort of rapid <b>transit</b> <b>trains</b> using the incremental grip force and the acceleration duration. The feasibility and practicably of the model was verified by a field test. Furthermore, a comparative analysis shows that the motion simulation system and the grip force based model were valid to support the laboratory studies on the longitudinal comfort of rapid <b>transit</b> <b>trains...</b>|$|R

40|$|The bachelor's thesis {{provides}} a description and {{a comparison of}} three different wastewater drainage systems in urban settlements. The first part describes the dimensioning procedures and introduces factors, which influence the design of sewerage systems, for <b>gravity,</b> <b>vacuum,</b> and pressure systems. The sewerage systems are compared from an economic and technical point of view. The characteristics, {{advantages and disadvantages of}} each system are highlighted as well. The second part of the bachelor's thesis presents the calculation of costs for the <b>gravity,</b> <b>vacuum,</b> and pressure sewerage systems on the basis of simplified example. The calculation of costs includes the cost of excavation, the cost of material, the cost of filling in, and the cost of connection to the sewerage system. The conclusion focuses on exposing which of the systems is the most cost-effective...|$|R
