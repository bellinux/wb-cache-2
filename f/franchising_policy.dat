50|$|On 29 November 2006, {{following}} a June 2006 complaint by the Department for Transport alleging excessive pricing by the ROSCOs, the Office of Rail Regulation (as {{it was then}} called) announced it was minded to refer {{the operation of the}} market for passenger rolling stock to the Competition Commission, citing, amongst other factors, problems in the DfT's own <b>franchising</b> <b>policy</b> as responsible for what may be regarded as a dysfunctional market. ORR said it will consult the industry and the public on what to do, and will publish its decision in April 2007. If the ORR does refer the market to the Competition Commission, there may well be a hiatus in investment in new rolling stock whilst the ROSCOs and their parent companies wait to hear what return they will be allowed to make on their train fleets. This could have the unintended consequence of intensifying the problem of overcrowding on some routes because TOCs will be unable to lengthen their trains or acquire new ones if they need the ROSCOs to co-operate in their acquisition or financing. Some commentators have suggested that such an outcome would be detrimental to the public interest. This is especially striking since the National Audit Office, in its November 2006 report on the renewal and upgrade of the West Coast main line, said that the capacity of the trains and the network will be full {{in the next few years}} and advocated train lengthening as an important measure to cope with sharply higher passenger numbers.|$|E

40|$|The article {{examines}} the labor and rail <b>franchising</b> <b>policy</b> of the British Labor Government. In opposition, the Labor Party initially opposed rail privatization on principle. By 1997, however, its approach was that privatization {{could be made to}} work given stronger regulation and an element of strategic leadership. The Strategic Rail Authority (SRA) was created to provide strategic direction for the rail industry and, after its absorption of the Office of Passenger Rail Franchising in 1999, it also became responsible for the regulation of the 25 Train Operating Companies. Government efforts to improve rail performance through the franchising system have proved to be problematic. The reasons for this include a complex but ineffective system of incentives and fines, the poor performance of the infrastructure authority and difficulties in bringing new rolling stock into service. Given these problems, the ultimate regulatory sanction is to terminate a poorly-performing train operating companies' franchise. This has happened once so far, when in 2003 Connex South East's franchise was removed and passed to a new public sector company, South Eastern Trains, a subsidiary of the SRA. The performance of South Eastern Trains has improved for four successive quarters. Despite the substantial improvements made by the public sector company, in January 2005 the SRA issued invitations to tender for the new Integrated Kent franchise covering services from Kent and East Sussex. There are several grounds for keeping South Eastern Trains within the public sector. The company has succeeded in improving performance, and so has complied with the what works principle. Another argument for maintaining at least one franchise in the public sector is that it could provide the basis for a gradual integration of the rail networ...|$|E

40|$|Given that {{virtually}} all British passenger train services were franchised out over the period 1995 - 7, and many have now been franchised for a second time, Britain should provide an excellent opportunity to study the impact of franchising passenger rail services. Moreover, since several different franchising models have been tried, there should also be some useful evidence {{on how best to}} go about franchising. In practice, however, the turbulent history of the British rail industry over this period makes drawing firm conclusions difficult. At the start, it appeared that franchising was very successful with strong competition for franchises, rapidly rising traffic, rising productivity and falling subsidies. Whilst most of the increase in traffic was due to external factors, the growth appears somewhat faster than would be explained by these factors alone. Despite this, a number of train operating companies got into financial difficulties, particularly in the Regional sector, where franchisees were relying on reduced costs rather than increased revenues to achieve subsidy reductions, and in the short term franchises were renegotiated or replaced with cost-plus contracts pending refranchising. After the bankruptcy of Railtrack not only have the costs and performance of the infrastructure manager severely deteriorated, but there has also been a large rise in the costs of train operating companies. Without {{a better understanding of the}} causes of this rise it is hard to form firm conclusions on the success of franchising. One argument is that one of the reasons franchisees found it difficult to achieve the anticipated cost reductions was the degree to which costs had already been driven down in the 1980 s. However costs did start to rise again in the early 1990 s and in the early years of franchising substantial savings in costs per train kilometre were achieved, with cost increases only following later. A second suggested explanation for the cost increase is the temporary placing of many Train Operating Companies on management contracts or renegotiation of franchises around 2001. We have found some support for this hypothesis, with our analysis showing that the affected TOCs experienced higher cost growth than other TOCs. A third argument is that the increase in costs in the last few years may have been driven by factors unrelated to the franchising process, and in particular, other aspects of policy such as health and safety legislation, disability discrimination legislation and a general requirement for higher standards. It is hard to be definitive on which of these three effects dominates, but we do have evidence which suggests that the way in which problem franchises were managed may have contributed substantially to the rise in costs after 1999 / 00. Our overall conclusion then is that passenger rail franchising in Britain may be regarded as a moderate success on the demand side, but that it has failed to achieve its objectives on the cost side. However, it should be noted that the rise in train operating costs in recent years has occurred at a time of considerable disruption, during which many other factors unrelated to <b>franchising</b> <b>policy</b> were changing at the same time.

40|$|First {{published}} online: 19 October 2016 How does {{international migration}} impact {{the composition of}} the demos? Constitutional doctrines and democratic theories suggest contrasting responses: an insular one excludes both non-citizen immigrants and citizen-emigrants; a deterritorialised one includes all citizens wherever they reside; a postnational one includes all residents and only these. This article argues that none of these predicted responses represents the dominant pattern of democratic adaptation, which is instead a level-specific expansion of the national franchise to include non-resident citizens and of the local franchise to include non-citizen residents. This is demonstrated by analysing an original dataset on voting rights in 31 European and 22 American countries, and outlining a level-sensitive normative theory of citizenship that provides support for this pattern as well as a critical benchmark for current <b>franchise</b> <b>policies.</b> The findings can be summarised in two inductive generalisations: (1) Voting rights today no longer depend on residence at the national level and on citizenship of the respective state at the local level; (2) Voting rights do, however, generally depend on citizenship of the respective state at the national level and on residence at the local level. In the article, these are called the patterns of franchise ‘expansion’ and ‘containment’. The former supports the idea of widespread level-specific expansion of the franchise and refutes the insular view of the demos. The latter signals corresponding level-specific restrictions, which defeats over-generalised versions of deterritorialised or postnational conceptions of the demos. In order to test how robust this finding is, cases are analysed where the dominant patterns of expansion have been resisted and where unexpected expansion has occurred. With regard to the former, the article identifies constitutional and political obstacles to voting rights expansion in particular countries. With regard to the latter, the article shows that even where national voting rights have been extended to non-citizen residents, containment remains strong through indirect links to citizenship...|$|R

40|$|INTRODUCTION The {{railways}} in Britain have a {{long history}} of using price discrimination backed up with product differentiation to significantly increase revenue over what might be obtained in an undifferentiated market. Whilst not as sophisticated as the yield management systems widely used in the airline industry, rail ticketing strategies are continually evolving, with new products emerging, unsuccessful products discontinued and gradual refinement of others. In recent years, there has been increased interest in modelling competition between different ticket types. The re-organisation of the railway industry in Great Britain has provided a greater commercial incentive to operators to price differentiate in order to maximise the revenue from their <b>franchises.</b> The <b>policy</b> of moderation of competition has allowed limited on-track competition, largely based around overlapping franchises but also with service extensions and new entrants, and this has stimulated product development and hence interest in ticket choice. Partly in response to the greater commercialisation of the railway industry, particularly where here is a degree of market power, the regulatory bodies have taken a greater interest in the range of tickets offered and their associated prices, travel restrictions and availability (SRA, 2003). This paper reports on research which was conducted as part of an update to the Passenger Demand Forecasting Handbook (PDFH), which contains a forecasting framework and recommended demand parameters that are widely used in the railway industry in Great Britain (ATOC, 2002), and as part of a project to provide the Strategic Rail Authority with evidence on cross elasticities between ticket types for use in its review of how it regulates rail fares...|$|R
40|$|As a {{significant}} {{contributor to the}} modern Australian economy, the residential real estate agency industry contributes approximately A$ 9. 9 billion in revenue and A$ 4. 2 billion in wages thus underpinning the Australian residential real estate employment (IBISWorld 2015 a). In addition, as a perpetually evolving and valuable investment asset class, residential real estate {{is regarded as a}} repository of wealth for millions of Australian households. The need to service the growing demand for residential real estate as well as to achieve sustainability in the competitive agency environment, are regarded as the predominant drivers of the real estate market. As such the residential real estate market is highly conducive to an affiliation of independent real estate organisations with franchised organisations as franchised organisations are able to offer a myriad of benefits such as economies of scale (IBISWorld 2014, 2015 b). Conversely and for this reason, franchising as a business format has been popular among a diverse range of industry sectors within the Australian economy. Franchising within the real estate industry remains an under-researched field in Australia. Instead much of the research within the real estate franchising field conducted to date focuses on the intrinsic benefits of franchising with the researchers generally electing to use a pragmatic lens to explain the franchising phenomenon. As such the findings emanate from a specific perspective and concern relatively practical issues such as &ldquo;encroachment, location and <b>franchise</b> fee <b>policies,</b> or more theoretical discourse on transaction cost analysis, ownership direction etc. &rdquo; (Price 2000, pp. 52). It is predominantly for this reason that this study&rsquo;s focus is principally linked to researching the basis of franchising strategy beyond its practical layer. In doing so, the study is directed towards an analysis of operational strategy adopted by different real estate agency business models, franchised and non-franchised, found in operation throughout Australia. As such this research exposes prevalent key themes and factors underpinning the strategic choice of business modelling within the Australian residential real estate agency industry. Additionally undertaking this study serves to add to a limited body of literature by investigating how many non-franchised real estate organisations gain competitive advantage through development of innovative business modelling in relation to positioning within the marketplace. The organisations adopting the innovative business modelling are thus seen as challenging the traditional franchise business model by way of posing the question whether&nbsp;the traditional franchise model has a boundless future as well as whether the franchising business model can be argued to be boundary-less...|$|R

These benefits include: sport development; social, cultural, economic and community benefits, among others, derived from hosting international level sport events. Canada has an enviable record of hosting major multi-sport events. We have staged them often and we have hosted them well. Since 1967, Canada has hosted almost every major multi-sport event available to it. Billions of dollars in public expenditures have been made in support of these events from all levels of government. But do the promises that are made to convince governments, community leaders and the general public deliver the benefits that they advertise? This research paper will examine the legacy aspects of major multi-sport games {{from the vantage point of}} community development, economic impact and in particular sport benefits. It also offers a conceptual framework to evaluate the sport benefit legacies and introduces the Major Event Return Legacy Index (MERLIN©). The prospect of hosting a major multi-sport event attracts a multitude of eager bidders in pursuit of tangible and intangible legacies for a nation. However, the rising complexity and spiraling expenditures necessary to secure, plan and stage these events require more robust assessment tools to properly measure the cost/benefit of supporting these mega projects. This research paper will contribute to the body of knowledge available to assist <b>franchise</b> holders and <b>policy</b> makers in determining the true legacy benefits that can be derived from hosting a major multi-sport event instead of relying on faith, hope and charity!Master of Business Administration (M.
