For the latter, its quasi-adiabatic case is explicitly analysed by making use of the highorder adiabatic approximation method and then manifests the wave packet collapse as well as the exactly-solvable case. By highlighting these analysis, it is finally found that an essence of the dynamical model of wave packet collapse is the factorization of the Schrodinger evolution other than the exact solvability. So many dynamical models including the well-known ones before, which are exactly-solvable or not, can be shown only to be the concrete realizations of this factorizability...|$|E
