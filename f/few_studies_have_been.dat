5|$|Complementary therapies {{have been}} {{investigated}} for treating people with acne. Low-quality evidence suggests topical application of tea tree oil or bee venom may reduce {{the total number of}} skin lesions in those with acne. Tea tree oil is thought to be approximately as effective as benzoyl peroxide or salicylic acid, but has been associated with allergic contact dermatitis. Proposed mechanisms for tea tree oil's anti-acne effects include antibacterial action against P. acnes, and anti-inflammatory properties. Numerous other plant-derived therapies have been observed to have positive effects against acne (e.g., basil oil and oligosaccharides from seaweed); however, <b>few</b> <b>studies</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> performed, and most have been of lower methodological quality. There is a lack of high-quality evidence for the use of acupuncture, herbal medicine, or cupping therapy for acne.|$|E

[...] This difference persisted even after controlling for household income and was greatest in the highest income quintile. [...] A Canadian study also found differences in neonatal mortality between different racial and ethnic groups.

2500|$|HLA-DQ8 confers {{susceptibility}} to coeliac disease {{but in a}} fashion somewhat similar to DQ2.5. Homozygotes of DQ8, DQ2.5/DQ8 and DQ8/DQ2.2 are higher than expected based on levels in the general population.(see: Understanding DQ haplotypes and DQ isoforms). HLA-DQ8 is generally not as involved in the most severe complications, {{and it does not}} recognize the [...] "33mer" [...] of α-2 gliadin to the same degree as DQ2.5. There are a smaller number of gliadin (prolamin) peptides presented by HLA-DQ8. A <b>few</b> <b>studies</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> done on the adaptive immune response for DQ8/DQ2- individuals. DQ8 appears to rely much more on adaptive immunity to the carboxyl half of alpha gliadins. [...] In addition, it appear to react with gamma gliadin to a degree comparable to DQ2.5. T-cell responses to the high molecular weight glutenin may be more important with DQ8 mediated than DQ2.5 mediated celiac disease.|$|E

2500|$|Studies of {{rehabilitation}} in Parkinson's disease are scarce and are of low quality. Partial evidence indicates speech or mobility problems can improve with rehabilitation, although studies are scarce and of low quality. Regular physical exercise and/or therapy can {{be beneficial to}} maintain and improve mobility, flexibility, strength, gait speed, and quality of life. Exercise may also improve constipation. Exercise interventions {{have been shown to}} benefit patients with Parkinson’s disease in regards to physical functioning, health-related quality of life, and balance and fall risk. In a review of 14 studies examining the effects of exercise on persons with Parkinson’s disease, no adverse events or side effects occurred following any of the exercise interventions. Five proposed mechanisms by which exercise enhances neuroplasticity are known. Intensive activity maximizes synaptic plasticity; complex activities promote greater structural adaptation; [...] activities that are rewarding increase dopamine levels and therefore promote learning/relearning; dopaminergic neurones are highly responsive to exercise and inactivity (“use it or lose it”); and where exercise is introduced at an early stage of the disease, progression can be slowed. One of the most widely practiced treatments for speech disorders associated with Parkinson's disease is the Lee Silverman voice treatment (LSVT), which focuses on increasing vocal loudness and has an intensive approach of one month. Speech therapy and specifically LSVT may improve voice and speech function. Occupational therapy (OT) aims to promote health and quality of life by helping people with the disease to participate in as many activities of their daily living as possible. <b>Few</b> <b>studies</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> conducted on the effectiveness of OT and their quality is poor, although some indication shows it may improve motor skills and quality of life {{for the duration of the}} therapy.|$|E
