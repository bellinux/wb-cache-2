An upstream monopolist may sell its product to two differentiated downstream retailers. Contract unobservability induces the manufacturer and each retailer to free-ride on margins earned by rival retailers, {{resulting in low}} transfer prices and low overall profit. O’Brien and Shaffer (1992) proposed {{a solution to this}} problem involving squeezing retail margins by using maximum RPM and high transfer prices. We show that when retail demand depends in any degree on retail sales effort, this equilibrium breaks down, and the opportunism problem reappears with full force. We show that no type of own-sale contracts or combination of own-sale restraints will solve the problem if sales effort matters. Moreover we show that certain <b>horizontal</b> <b>commitments,</b> as for example industry-wide minimum RPM, may restore the fully integrated outcome, but only in special cases...|$|R

In this study, the distribution characteristics of C 02, a promising natural refrigerant, were experimentally investigated for a parallel flow evaporator with 10 flat aluminum tubes. The tubes have the length of 1000 mm and each tube has six micro-channels with a diameter of 0. 8 mm. To detect the flow distribution into the tubes, the wall temperatures were measured along the tubes which are heated by flexible electric resistance heating wires. If the mass flow rate in a tube is lower than others, the superheating of the refrigerant would occur earlier in that tube and the corresponding wall temperature become higher. To investigate {{the effect of the}} gravity, three installation positions of the evaporator were considered; vertical headers/ <b>horizontal</b> tubes (case <b>I),</b> <b>horizontal</b> headers/ horizontal tubes (case 2), and horizontal headers/ vertical tubes (case 3). Experimental results showed that case I was most greatly influenced by the gravity.

40|$|This paper {{describes}} current WTO rules concerning telecommunications services. It {{includes an}} explanation {{of the structure of the}} GATS, its Annex on Telecommunications, and the Agreement on Basic Telecommunication Services. As discussed in the previous chapter, the latter reflects the commitments of sixty-nine countries that agreed to open their markets to foreign basic telecommunication services and to foreign suppliers of these services. It also contains additional rules which are linked to these commitments and are assembled under the so-called ‘Reference Paper’. The GATT is relevant in relation to equipment and terminals used to convey and receive telecommunications signals. This, however, constitutes a different line of trade, which is discussed in Chapter 9 of this book. he GATS, similarly to the GATT, aims at protecting equality of competitive opportunities for companies in domestic markets regardless of their origin and the origin of their services. It aims at facilitating progressive liberalisation of services while enabling WTO Members to regulate them “in order to meet national policy objectives”. The GATS thus constitutes the framework agreement relevant to all services and particularly those that, like telecommunication services, have been or are being liberalised. n contrast with the GATT, the GATS contains a mix of <b>horizontal</b> <b>commitments</b> applicable to all services and service suppliers and sectorbased commitments only applicable to those sectors which have been explicitly open to trade by WTO Members. Horizontal rules apply to all measures by Members affecting trade in services. There are no limits in the scope of services except those supplied on a non-commercial basis or outside any form of competition, such as national security or justice.

Material and Methods: Sixty patients were divided into a treated group (n= 30) consisting of hypertensive patients treated with nifedipine and a control group (n= 30) consisting of patients without arterial hypertension. The following exams were performed on the first visit: anamnesis, measurement of blood pressure, weight and height, extra- and intraoral examination, and determination of the vertical and horizontal gingival overgrowth indices, plaque index, and bleeding index. The measurements were repeated after 30 days. Results: Most patients using nifedipine (60. 7 %) presented grade <b>I</b> <b>horizontal</b> gingival overgrowth (1 to 2 mm), with 3. 6 % showing minimum vertical gingival overgrowth.

Here we aimed to investigate the effect of withdrawal of visual feedback on writing size in patients with PD.

40|$|Background: Carotenoids are multifunctional, taxonomically {{widespread}} and biotechnologically important pigments. Their biosynthesis {{serves as a}} model system for understanding the evolution of secondary metabolism. Microbial carotenoid diversity and evolution has hitherto been analyzed primarily from structural and biosynthetic perspectives, with the few phylogenetic analyses of microbial carotenoid biosynthetic proteins using either used limited datasets or lacking methodological rigor. Given the recent accumulation of microbial genome sequences, a reappraisal of microbial carotenoid biosynthetic diversity and evolution {{from the perspective of}} comparative genomics is warranted to validate and complement models of microbial carotenoid diversity and evolution based upon structural and biosynthetic data. Methodology/Principal Findings: Comparative genomics were used to identify and analyze in silico microbial carotenoid biosynthetic pathways. Four major phylogenetic lineages of carotenoid biosynthesis are suggested composed of: (i) Proteobacteria; (ii) Firmicutes; (iii) Chlorobi, Cyanobacteria and photosynthetic eukaryotes; and (iv) Archaea, Bacteroidetes and two separate sub-lineages of Actinobacteria. Using this phylogenetic framework, specific evolutionary mechanisms are proposed for carotenoid desaturase CrtI-family enzymes and carotenoid cyclases. Several phylogenetic lineage-specific evolutionary mechanisms are also suggested, including: (<b>i)</b> <b>horizontal</b> gene transfer; (ii) gene acquisition followed by differential gene loss; (iii) co-evolution with other biochemical structures such as proteorhodopsins; and (iv) positiv...|$|R

40|$|Aims: Many {{experiments}} {{have shown a}} positive effect of species richness on productivity in grassland plant communities. However, it is poorly understood how environmental conditions affect this relationship. We aimed to test whether deep soil and limiting nutrient conditions increase the complementarity effect (CE) of species richness due to enhanced potential for resource partitioning. Methods: We grew monocultures and mixtures of four common grassland species in pots on shallow and deep soil, factorially combined with two nutrient levels. Soil volume was kept constant to avoid confounding soil depth and volume. Using an additive partitioning method, we separated biodiversity effects on plant productivity into components due to species complementarity and dominance. Important findings: Net biodiversity and complementarity effects were consistently higher in shallow pots, which was unexpected, and at the low nutrient level. These two results suggest that although belowground partitioning of resources was important, especially under low nutrient conditions, it was not {{due to differences in}} rooting depths. We conclude that in our experiment (<b>i)</b> <b>horizontal</b> root segregation might have been more important than the partitioning of rooting depths and (ii) that the positive effects of deep soil found in other studies were due to the combination of deeper soil with larger soil volume...|$|R
40|$|AbstractIn {{the nervous}} system, {{transcription}} factor expression in progenitor and/or nascent neurons regulates cell type specification. Although {{the functions of}} these transcription factors at early stages are well established, {{whether or not they}} are required during late developmental periods remains an open question. To address this issue, we conditionally manipulated gene expression using a recently developed transposon-mediated gene transfer system combined with in ovo electroporation. In chicken retinas, horizontal cells are classified into three subtypes according to their characteristic neuronal morphology. Two LIM family transcription factors, Lim 1 and Isl 1, begin to be expressed in a distinct subset of nascent retinal neurons, which results in complementary expression of these genes in mature retinas in type I and type II/III horizontal cells, respectively. Overexpression of Isl 1 in post-migratory horizontal cells represses endogenous Lim 1 expression and increases the number of neurons with a dendritic morphology characteristic of type II horizontal cells, which normally express Isl 1. Inhibition of Lim 1 function by expression of a dominant negative form Lim 1 perturbs axonal morphogenesis of type <b>I</b> <b>horizontal</b> cells. Therefore, we propose that LIM family transcription factors are required for subtype-specific morphogenesis of horizontal cells at later stages of retinal development...|$|R
