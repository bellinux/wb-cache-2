5|$|One of Kraft's most {{important}} contributions to manned spaceflight {{would be his}} origination {{of the concept of}} a Mission Control Center. Many of the engineers in Project Mercury had previously worked on the flight test of aircraft, where the role for ground support was minimal. However, Kraft soon realized that an astronaut could only <b>do</b> <b>so</b> <b>much,</b> particularly during the fast-moving launch phase; the Mercury spacecraft would require real time monitoring and support from specialist engineers.|$|E
5|$|Thus far, the German fighters had {{performed}} well, {{but now it}} came to {{the most difficult part of}} the operation: withdrawing under attack. The German fighters were low on fuel and could only <b>do</b> <b>so</b> <b>much</b> to protect the bombers. Damaged stragglers lagged behind the main bomber streams and were easy prey for RAF fighters if they could be found. The four German raiding formations were all heading in different directions by 13:30: 9 Staffel were well clear to the south, heading back over Beachy Head; KG 1 were completing their bomb run while the Spitfires of 610 were being held at arm's length by JG 54 Bf 109s; the Ju 88s of KG 76 had attacked West Malling and their escorts were battling Nos. 32, 64, 501 and 615 Squadrons. The Dorniers were heading home under attack by elements of 32, 64 and 615 Squadrons. However, further to the east, Nos. 1, 17, 54, 56 and 266 Squadrons totalling 23 Spitfires and 36 Hurricanes were moving in to meet the main formations during their withdrawal.|$|E

25|$|In this fourth Edition I {{have made}} no {{alterations}} of any kind. I now, however, find myself at liberty to acknowledge my very great obligations to Mr. HENRY HOP of Amsterdam. To that Gentleman I owe the most distinct, as well as liberal information, concerning a very interesting and important subject, the Bank of Amsterdam; of which no printed account had ever appeared to me satisfactory, or even intelligible. The name of that Gentleman is so well known in Europe, the information which comes from him must <b>do</b> <b>so</b> <b>much</b> honour to whoever has been favoured with it, and my vanity is so much interested in making this acknowledgment, that I can no longer refuse myself the pleasure of prefixing this Advertisement to this new Edition of my Book.|$|E
25|$|Due to the {{haphazard}} {{nature of}} evacuation, many labourers did not arrive with their factory, {{and had to}} find labour on their own, though jobs were hard to come by. Additionally, cities like Tashkent became overwhelmed at {{the sheer volume of}} people arriving at its gates and had great difficulty supplying the food and shelter necessary for evacuees. Upon arrival, many evacuees died of illness or starvation in extreme poverty in Central Asia. Uzbek officials set up aid stations at Tashkent, which were mirrored at other railway stations to help combat the poverty, but they could only <b>do</b> <b>so</b> <b>much</b> as little could be spared economically for the war effort. Despite these troubles, the ability of Central Asia to absorb Soviet industry and population {{to the extent that it}} did and in the harried manner that it did was impressive. The Germans certainly didn't foresee the preparedness of Soviet Central Asia, and in the end they paid dearly for it.|$|E
25|$|It is {{said that}} in Myra the relics of Saint Nicholas each year exuded a clear watery liquid which smells like rose water, called manna (or myrrh), which is {{believed}} by the faithful to possess miraculous powers. After the relics were brought to Bari, they continued to <b>do</b> <b>so,</b> <b>much</b> to {{the joy of the}} new owners. Vials of myrrh from his relics have been taken all over the world for centuries, and can still be obtained from his church in Bari. Even up to the present day, a flask of manna is extracted from the tomb of Saint Nicholas every year on 6 December (the Saint's feast day) by the clergy of the basilica. The myrrh is collected from a sarcophagus which is located in the basilica vault and could be obtained in the shop nearby. The liquid gradually seeps out of the tomb, but it is unclear whether it originates from the body within the tomb, or from the marble itself; since the town of Bari is a harbour, and the tomb is below sea level, there have been several natural explanations proposed for the manna fluid, including the transfer of seawater to the tomb by capillary action.|$|E

500|$|The {{appearance}} of Samantha Mulder, {{this time as}} a clone of her from {{when she was still}} a little girl, was due to series creator Chris Carter's desire to bring her back. Carter felt Samantha was an important element of the show, referring to her as being part of the lifeblood of the series. The decision to kill the character X was made {{at the end of the}} third season. The writers felt that they could only <b>do</b> <b>so</b> <b>much</b> with the character and decided that they would either make him a bigger player on the show, or have him pay the price for collaborating with Fox Mulder. Ultimately they decided on the latter. This led to the introduction of Marita Covarrubias at the end of the episode, Mulder's latest informant.|$|E

500|$|Eric Goldman of IGN {{scored the}} season a 7.9 out of 10, feeling it [...] "had its up and downs, mixing in {{elements}} that worked (Daisy getting her Quake on, the Fitz and Simmons drama), elements {{we could have}} used more of (Secret Warriors!) and elements that just never felt right (Lincoln and his relationship with Daisy)." [...] Goldman also felt that {{the first half of}} the season was [...] "the stronger, more cohesive of the two halves" [...] as it aired the episode [...] "4,722 Hours" [...] which Goldman called [...] "the best hour of Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D. to date." [...] He criticized the pacing of the season, saying [...] "some episodes felt a bit jumbled and could have benefited from slowing down a bit—or simply not trying to <b>do</b> <b>so</b> <b>much</b> at once. Sometimes it was just a question of including too many characters or storylines in single episodes, causing some scenarios to not have time to breathe or get the proper build up they might have with more character-focused episodes." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{decision}} to have the character of X killed off in [...] "Herrenvolk" [...] was made {{at the end of}} the third season. The writers felt that they could only <b>do</b> <b>so</b> <b>much</b> with the character and decided that they would either make him a bigger character in the series, or have him pay the price for collaborating with Mulder. The show's producers decided to give Gillian Anderson's character Dana Scully cancer early in the fourth season. Carter initially discussed giving Scully's mother cancer but decided to have Scully suffer from it instead. Carter felt the move would give the show an interesting platform on which to discuss things such as faith, science, health care and a certain element of the paranormal. Some of the writing staff felt that the decision was a poor one to make, citing it as [...] "a cheap TV thing". However, Frank Spotnitz felt that, given the appearances of cancer-stricken abductees in previous episodes, it was an [...] "obligatory" [...] move to have Scully follow suit.|$|E
500|$|The album {{received}} {{some of its}} most negative reviews from the British and Irish press. A review for NME was critical of the album's personal lyrics, and claimed that Manson had emasculated himself by opening up. In a one-star review, The Guardian called the album unconvincing, and criticized it for a lack of experimentation; whilst Entertainment.ie writer Lauren Murphy chastised several songs for sounding too experimental and [...] "completely misplaced", summarizing: [...] "If he'd stuck to what he was good at – ear-piercing yelps, liberal dashes of real controversy and big, brawny metal songs with tough beats – he may have [...] a 'comeback' on his hands." [...] Conversely, Mayer Nissim from Digital Spy commended the album for its diversity, but was critical of its length and [...] "ill-advised attempts at stadium anthems." [...] He awarded the album three stars out of five and said: [...] "It's far from awful, but not for the first time, you can't help but feel that Manson could <b>do</b> <b>so</b> <b>much</b> better." ...|$|E

500|$|The film {{is presumed}} lost as no known {{surviving}} {{copies of the}} film exist. A synopsis of the film was published in The Moving Picture World. It states: [...] "Glade and Sears are next door neighbors and old friends. Glade has a daughter, while Sears has a son. The young people have never met, being away at school while the old folks have been cementing their friendship. As the two men own adjoining places, {{they believe that the}} best thing for the younger people to do is to get married. So they try to bring this about. Gladys Glade and Charlie Sears meet on the train while they are returning home and start a flirtation. Perhaps they would have married in the end, if the old folks hadn't 'butted in.' As it is, they lose all interest in each other. Then the fathers try another tack. They decide to be bitter enemies in public, hoping the opposition will bring the children together. The new plan works like a charm, and Gladys and Charlie, realizing their parents' shortcomings, decide to elope. They <b>do</b> <b>so,</b> <b>much</b> to the satisfaction of Glade and Sears." ...|$|E
500|$|Crash Bandicoot: Warped is a {{platform}} {{game in which}} the player controls Crash and Coco Bandicoot, who must travel {{back in time and}} gather 25 Crystals scattered across time before Doctor Neo Cortex and Uka Uka <b>do</b> <b>so.</b> <b>Much</b> of the game takes place in the Time-Twisting Machine, which acts as the hub area of the game. The Time-Twisting Machine is split up into five chambers; only the first chamber is initially available. Each chamber has five buttons that open portals to different levels. The goal in each level is to find and obtain the Crystal hidden in the area. In some levels, the Crystal will be located {{at the end of a}} level or must be earned by completing a specific challenge. Some levels contain a [...] "Bonus Platform" [...] that leads to a special bonus area, where the player must navigate through a separate area and collect everything in sight. As no lives are lost in the bonus areas, the bonus areas can be played through as often as the player desires until the bonus area can be cleared. After completing all five levels in a chamber, a sixth button that opens a portal to a boss level will appear. By defeating the boss, the next chamber will become available for play. When all 25 Crystals are found and all five boss characters are defeated, the game is won.|$|E
500|$|Rakeysh {{said the}} {{following}} in a scriptwriter's conference {{conducted by the}} Film Writers Association in the year 2008, [...] "I was making a documentary called Mamooli Ram, on the missed revolution with Kamalesh Pandey. We were sitting in a small hotel room in Nanded, drinking. We started singing songs, and we both realised we liked similar songs. And so Rang De Basanti was born. He was angry with the system, I was helpless with the system. We wanted to <b>do</b> <b>so</b> <b>much.</b> But we really can't do anything and it {{was born out of}} anger. He wrote a story called Ahuti, meaning sacrifice. Ahuti was about the armed revolution about India, between the years 1919 and 1931. It started with Ashfaqullah Khan, Ramprasad Bismil, Bhagat Singh, Rajguru, went on to Chandrashekhar Azad and so on. We had this amazing screenplay called Ahuti, which we had also termed as The Young Guns of India, which started with a train robbery, Azad on a horse and so on. I said, [...] "let's do The Young Guns of India". We were going to go on the floor, and suddenly {{there were a couple of}} film on Bhagat Singh made. But they came and went. Not because they were good or bad films, not because they were written badly or not written so bad. I'm not being judgmental about them. And this is very important: because they did not reflect the sentiment of today's time. Nobody in the audience could identify with something which was past. It wasn't that there wasn't idea of patriotism in us, but it was sleeping somewhere. And you had to kind of relate to it in today's world. So a couple of bottles of vodka again, and three days later, with couple of vodkas down, Kamlesh ji comes up with 'You know what, I think I've cracked it'." ...|$|E

2500|$|The school motto Quantum Potes Tantum Aude ("Dare All You Can, for God and Man") was {{introduced}} by the rector-headmaster, Fr Thomas Gartlan SJ, in 1906. Quantum Potes Tantum Aude is now formally translated from Latin as [...] "As {{much as you can}} <b>do,</b> <b>so</b> <b>much</b> dare to do", seen to best reflect the Latin, replacing the former [...] "Dare to do your Best". The motto is taken from a song of Saint Thomas Aquinas (12271274) entitled Lauda Sion Salvatorem ('Praise, O Sion, Praise Thy Saviour'). The next line after Quantum Potes Tantum Aude is Quia Maior Omni Laude, which, together, translates to [...] "As much as you can <b>do,</b> <b>so</b> <b>much</b> dare to do, because He is above all praise".|$|E
