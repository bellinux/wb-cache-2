5|$|The Anzac Mounted Division's {{lines of}} {{communication}} were now <b>fully</b> <b>extended,</b> and the difficulties of supplying the mounted troops from Romani {{made it impossible for}} the British Empire mounted force to consider any further advance at that time. Arrangements were made to hold and garrison the country decisively won by this series of indecisive engagements, from Katia eastwards to Bir El Abd.|$|E
5|$|All {{bodies were}} in similar flexed {{positions}} lying on their left sides with knees raised up towards their chin. In comparison, most bodies excavated from Egypt {{dating to the}} predynastic period are in a similar position, however at Merimda Beni Salama and El-Amra bodies were found on their right sides. From the time these bodies were buried up until the Middle Kingdom period, the dead were laid on their sides. After this period they were buried on their backs (dorsal position), and from the Fifth Dynasty the bodies were always <b>fully</b> <b>extended.</b>|$|E
5|$|The {{wreckage}} was too severely fragmented {{to determine}} the exact position of the rudders, elevators, flaps, and slats before impact and examination of eyewitness photographs showed only that the right wing slats were <b>fully</b> <b>extended</b> as the crew tried unsuccessfully to correct the steep roll they were in. The left wing slats could not be determined from the blurry color photographs, so they were sent to a laboratory in Palo Alto, California for digital analysis, a process that was pushing the limits of 1970s technology and necessitated large, complicated, and expensive equipment. The photographs were reduced to black-and-white, which {{made it possible to}} distinguish the slats from the wing itself and thus proved that they were retracted. In addition, it was also verified that the tail section of the aircraft was undamaged and the landing gear was down.|$|E

40|$|Throughout {{this paper}} we {{introduce}} {{the concept of}} quasi closed submoduleswhich is weaker than the concept of closed submodules. Byusing this concept we define the class of <b>fully</b> <b>extending</b> modules, wherean R-module M is called <b>fully</b> <b>extending</b> if every quasi closed submoduleof M is a direct summand. This class of modules is stronger than theclass of extending modules. Many results about this concept are given,also many relationships with other related concepts are introduced...|$|R

25|$|Pointe {{technique}} {{is the part}} of classical ballet technique that concerns pointe work, in which a ballet dancer supports all body weight on the tips of <b>fully</b> <b>extended</b> feet within pointe shoes. A dancer is said to be en pointe when the dancer's body is supported in this manner, and a <b>fully</b> <b>extended</b> vertical foot is said to be en pointe when touching the floor, even when not bearing weight. Pointe work is performed while wearing pointe shoes, which employ structural reinforcing to distribute the dancer's weight load throughout the foot, thus reducing the load on the toes enough to enable the dancer to support all body weight on fully vertical feet.|$|E
25|$|Even when <b>fully</b> <b>extended</b> ({{straight}}ened) at the elbow, {{the forearm}} did not form a straight angle, falling short of this by 22°. Pronation (twisting {{to make the}} palmar side of the hand face downwards) of the forearm was impossible, because the radius and ulna lacked rolling surfaces, meaning the forearm was in a permanent state of supination.|$|E

25|$|The freeway was {{not part}} of the {{original}} planned freeways around Kansas City in 1955. The section east of the I-35 interchange was built first and finished in 1968. The western portion was not planned until 1971, and was not finished until several years later. By 1987, the freeway was extended slightly westward in the downtown Kansas area, but was not <b>fully</b> <b>extended</b> to I-70 until 1991, when it was fully opened.|$|E

40|$|Flexor profundus is a {{mass action}} muscle {{so that when}} we <b>fully</b> <b>extend</b> one finger {{including}} full extension of the distal joint the entire muscle is pulled distally. By fully flexing the injured or operated finger at the metacarpophalangeal joint and <b>fully</b> <b>extending</b> the adjacent fingers, flexor digitorum profundus of the operated finger is made so redundant as to abolish all tension at the suture line. The position of the operated finger: metacarpophalangeal joint flexion with interphalangeal joint extension is ideal {{for the preservation of}} joint mobility and therefore ideal for the restoration of movement when the repaired flexor tendon is mobilized. It is permissible to splint a healthy finger in full extension for three weeks...|$|R
50|$|Freston {{was known}} for her loud support of California's Prop 2, a ballot measure that - among other things - {{required}} that by January 1, 2015, egg-laying hens raised in California {{be able to stand}} up, lie down, turn around, and <b>fully</b> <b>extend</b> their wings.|$|R
25|$|A variant on {{the fast}} bowler's action is the sling (sometimes {{referred}} to as the slingshot or javelin), where the bowler begins his delivery with his or her arm <b>fully</b> <b>extended</b> behind their back. The slinging action generates extra speed, but sacrifices control. The most famous exponent of the slinging action was Jeff Thomson, who bowled at extraordinary pace off a short run up. Other international examples include Fidel Edwards, Shaun Tait, Lasith Malinga and Mitchell Johnson.|$|E
25|$|A wagon brake has {{a handle}} which, when pushed down, extends a steel rod down {{and onto the}} stage. When <b>fully</b> <b>extended,</b> the steel rod {{actually}} lifts {{a section of the}} wagon slightly off the stage floor. The bottom end of the rod has a threaded cavity that will accept an extension spindle, which in turn can be used to adjust the height of the wagon above the stage. The brake is released by raising its handle, thereby retracting the steel rod away from the stage.|$|E
25|$|However, β-strands {{are rarely}} {{perfectly}} extended; rather, they exhibit a twist {{due to the}} chirality of their component amino acids. The energetically preferred dihedral angles near (φ,ψ) = (–135°,135°) (broadly, the upper left region of the Ramachandran plot) diverge significantly from the <b>fully</b> <b>extended</b> conformation (φ,ψ) = (–180°,180°). The twist {{is often associated with}} alternating fluctuations in the dihedral angles to prevent the individual β-strands in a larger sheet from splaying apart. A good example of a strongly twisted β-hairpin {{can be seen in the}} protein BPTI.|$|E

50|$|The tricepts {{extend the}} elbows. Since the extensors {{in the arms}} are being worked while flexors are only playing their role as antagonists, the antagonists often limit the extensors; for instance, the {{practitioner}} {{may be unable to}} <b>fully</b> <b>extend</b> the elbow joint, or raise the arms fully.|$|R
25|$|Originally, this {{definition}} {{said that the}} elbow joint must not straighten out during the bowling action. Bowlers generally hold their elbows <b>fully</b> <b>extended</b> and rotate the arm vertically about the shoulder joint to impart velocity to the ball, releasing it {{near the top of}} the arc. Flexion at the elbow is not allowed, but any extension of the elbow was deemed to be a throw and would be liable to be called a no ball. This was thought to be possible only if the bowler's elbow was originally held in a slightly flexed position.|$|E
25|$|From November 16 to 20, 2002, {{approximately}} 100 {{striped bass}} (Morone saxatilis), 5 bat rays (Myliobatis californica) and 2 leopard sharks (Triakis semifasciata) were {{found dead in}} the Flood Control Basin in both Adobe and Matadero Creeks within one mile of the tidegate. The fishkill was attributed to the first large rainstorm washing {{a large amount of}} leaf litter into the basin, leading to eutrophication and low dissolved oxygen. This is supported {{by the fact that the}} dead fish were all large (requiring more oxygen) at 2 to 4 feet long and the mouths and gills of the bass were <b>fully</b> <b>extended</b> open.|$|E
25|$|In Game 6, Pippen {{made the}} {{signature}} play of his career. Midway {{in the third}} quarter, Pippen received the ball during a Bulls fast break, charging toward the basket. As center Patrick Ewing jumped up to defend the shot, Pippen <b>fully</b> <b>extended</b> the ball out, absorbing body contact and a foul from Ewing, and slammed the ball through the hoop with Ewing's hand in his face. Pippen landed several {{feet away from the}} basket along the baseline, incidentally walking over a fallen Ewing. He then made taunting remarks to both Ewing and then Spike Lee, who was standing courtside supporting the Knicks, thus receiving a technical foul. This extended the Bulls' lead to 17; they won 93–79.|$|E
50|$|After {{ending his}} playing career and {{revealing}} that {{ever since his}} accident he could never <b>fully</b> <b>extend</b> or bend his right leg, Danilo became a coach. In 1963, he led Bolivia to their only title - Copa América - with a 5-4 win over Brazil along the way.|$|R
25|$|This waza knocks an opponent's shinai to {{the right}} or left. This neutralises a {{potential}} strike and gives the ideal chance to strike as an opponent is off-balance. For success, an opponent's maai has to be correctly perceived and then one knocks down their shinai before their arm <b>fully</b> <b>extends.</b> Valid examples are: do-uchiotoshi-men and tsuki-uchiotoshi-men.|$|R
