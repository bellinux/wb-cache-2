50|$|Debt-financed <b>Dividends</b> <b>Received</b> Limitation -Code Section 246A disallows {{the benefit}} of the <b>dividends</b> <b>received</b> {{deduction}} for debt financed purchases of corporate portfolio stock. As stated by the Joint Committee on Taxation, the provision reduces the deduction for <b>dividends</b> <b>received</b> on debt-financed portfolio stock. Therefore, the <b>dividends</b> <b>received</b> deduction is available only with respect to dividends “attributable” to stock financed through other means besides debt. A simple ratio is computed to determine what percentage of an investment is debt-financed. As a result, the <b>dividends</b> <b>received</b> deduction is reduced by the percentage of the investment funded by debt.|$|R
50|$|The Taxable Income Limitation -The <b>dividends</b> <b>received</b> {{deduction}} {{is limited}} {{with regard to}} the corporate shareholder’s taxable income. Per §246(b) of the IRC, a corporation with the rights to a seventy percent <b>dividends</b> <b>received</b> deduction, can deduct the dividend amount only up to seventy percent of the corporation’s taxable income. Furthermore, a corporation with the rights to an eighty percent <b>dividends</b> <b>received</b> deduction can deduct the dividend amount only up to eighty percent of the corporation’s taxable income. There are two exceptions to The Taxable Income Limitation. No taxable income restriction is placed on a corporation with a one-hundred percent <b>dividends</b> <b>received</b> deduction. Second, if the <b>dividends</b> <b>received</b> deduction increases or creates a net operating loss, the limitation does not apply.|$|R

50|$|Until 1973, company {{profits were}} taxed as profits, and {{dividend}} payments were then taxed as income. In 1973, a {{partial imputation system}} was introduced for dividend payments, under which companies were required to withhold tax on dividends, called an advance corporation tax, before they were distributed to shareholders. UK companies could set off the ACT amount withheld against the overall company tax liability, subject to certain limits. (The full amount of ACT paid could not be recovered if significantly large amounts of profits were distributed.) Shareholders of a UK company who received a <b>dividend</b> <b>received</b> a tax credit representing the ACT paid, which could be set off against their overall income tax liability. Non-taxable shareholders, such as pension funds, were entitled to a refund of the ACT amount.|$|E

The research type used is verificative research by using census method. The target population of this research is listed companies from the manufacturing sector at the Indonesia Stock Exchange which have positive earnings, operating cash flow, free cash flow and pay cash dividend both current year and last year. After being selected, there are 11 companies as target population. Because this research is done for five years, the total observations are 55. The multiple regression model is used to examine the influence of earnings, operating cash flow, free cash flow, and last year cash dividend both simultaneously and partially toward cash <b>dividend</b> <b>received</b> by stock holders. The results of this research show that (1) earnings, operating cash flow, free cash flow, and last year cash dividend simultaneously have influence toward cash <b>dividend</b> <b>received</b> by stock holders, (2) partially, earnings, free cash flow, and last year cash dividend have positive influence toward cash <b>dividend</b> <b>received</b> by stock holders, whereas operating cash flow has negative influence toward cash <b>dividend</b> <b>received</b> by stock holders...|$|E
40|$|An {{earlier version}} of this article {{appeared}} as Accounting Working Papers 04 / 08 Although UK resident tax-exempt shareholders lost the right to repayment of tax credits oil dividends paid by UK resident companies in July 1997, they could continue to receive tax credit repayments in respect of <b>dividend,</b> <b>received</b> from Irish resident companies until December 1998. In July 1997 the rate of tax credit on Irish companies' dividends was 21 %, and this was reduced to 11 % in December 1997. We obtain insights into the incentives and behavior of UK tax-exempt investors in response to these changes in the relative 'tax attractiveness' of investments in Irish resident companies. We find that only at its highest rate, 21 %, was the level of dividend tax credit on Irish companies' dividends sufficient to induce changes in UK tax-exempt shareholders' investment strategies: and that the propensity lot dividend capture by tax-exempt investors is heightened when the dividend tax credit yield is of the order of 0. 8 % or more and dividend yield is of the order of 2. 6 % or more...|$|E
40|$|The {{introduction}} of the proposed new Dividends Tax will {{have a significant impact}} on financial institutions such as Collective Investment Schemes, Linked Investment Service Providers and Long-term Insurers. The reason for this is that South African listed companies declaring local dividends will not necessarily have all the details of and know the identity of their shareholders. These financial institutions may be regarded as regulated intermediaries in terms of the new Dividends Tax legislation and therefore may have the responsibility of withholding the Dividends Tax from dividends received on behalf of their clients, who may in most cases be the beneficial owners of the underlying equity shares. The motivating factor for the research is the fact that there does not appear to be any guidance on the impact of the new Dividends Tax on financial institutions, since the Dividends Tax is new legislation. The research problem addressed in this thesis is how the systems and processes of a financial institution will be affected by the implementation of the new Dividends Tax. The research took the form of a case study designed to investigate the impact of the Dividends Tax on the financial institution at which the researcher is employed. The data required for the research was collected by means of a study of the relevant legislation enacted in connection with the topic, journal articles in financial/tax journals, as well as articles published in the media. The systems and processes presently in place, as well as the changes to these systems that will be needed to accommodate the new dividend tax were ascertained by means of in-depth interviews with relevant staff at the financial institution. In addition, the researcher also applied her personal knowledge of the business of the financial institution at which she works to the problem. As a result of the research it was determined that a Collective Investment Scheme, Linked Investment Service Provider and Long-Term Insurer will all be regarded as regulated intermediaries for the purposes of the new dividend withholding tax. This means that these financial institutions will be required to withhold Dividends Tax from dividends paid to their clients and pay this Dividends Tax so withheld to SARS. Furthermore, the findings of the research confirmed that the new Dividends Tax will {{have a significant impact on}} the client services department in areas such as notifying clients, training of client service staff, handling of declaration of exemption forms received from clients, amending client statements and tax certificates (to cater for the new Dividends Tax). In addition to this, it was ascertained that significant systems development will be required by these financial institutions in order to comply with the new Dividends Tax legislation. This would include the development of data input fields to enable users to capture the relevant information required and development of the system to enable it to flag local dividends received to which the Dividends Tax applies. The system would also need to cater for Secondary Tax on Companies credits as well as foreign tax rebates. The system should also be able to calculate the amount of Dividends Tax to withhold per <b>dividend</b> <b>received</b> by a client, as well as be able to handle the payment of the Dividends Tax to SARS and the refund to clients of Dividends Tax over deducted. It is essential that systems are able to flag the correct date of payment of the dividend so that the Dividends Tax can be paid over timeously to SARS in order to avoid interest and penalties being levied. To summarise, the new Dividends Tax has a significant impact on these financial institutions in areas such as client services, administration and system development...|$|E
