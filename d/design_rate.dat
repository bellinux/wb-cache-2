40|$|Protograph-based Raptor-like low-density parity-check codes (PBRL codes) are a {{recently}} proposed family of easily encodable and decodable rate-compatible LDPC (RC-LDPC) codes.

We achieve this by maximizing an upper bound on the minimum distance of any QC-LDPC code that can be obtained from the protograph of a PBRL ensemble. The obtained codes outperform the original PBRL codes at short block-lengths by significantly improving the error floor behavior at all <b>design</b> <b>rates.</b> Furthermore, we identify a reduction in complexity of the design procedure, facilitated by the general structure of a PBRL ensemble.

40|$|Abstract — In this paper, {{we study}} cross-layer design for rate control in {{multihop}} wireless networks. In our previous work, {{we have developed}} an optimal cross-layered rate control scheme that jointly computes both the rate allocation and the stabilizing schedule that controls the resources at the underlying layers. However, the scheduling component in this optimal cross-layered rate control scheme has to solve a complex global optimization problem at each time, and hence is too computationally expensive for online implementation. In this paper, we study how the performance of cross-layer rate control will be impacted if the network can only use an imperfect (and potentially distributed) scheduling component that is easier to implement. We study both the case {{when the number of}} users in the system is fixed and the case with dynamic arrivals and departures of the users, and we establish desirable results on the performance bounds of cross-layered rate control with imperfect scheduling. Compared with a layered approach that does not <b>design</b> <b>rate</b> control and scheduling together, our cross-layered approach has provably better performance bounds, and substantially outperforms the layered approach. The insights drawn from our analyses also enable us to design a fully distributed cross-layered rate control and scheduling algorithm for a restrictive interference model.

40|$|International audienceIn this paper, the {{transmission}} over the binary erasure channel (BEC) using non-binary LDPC (NBLDPC) codes is considered. The concept of peeling decoder and stopping sets is generalized to NBLDPC codes. Using these generalizations, a combinatorial characterization of decoding failures of NBLDPC codes is given, under {{assumption that the}} Belief Propagation (BP) decoder is used. Then, the residual ensemble of codes resulted by the BP decoder is defined and the <b>design</b> <b>rate</b> and the expectation of total number of codewords of the residual ensemble are computed. The decoding failure criterion combined with the density evolution analysis helps us to compute the asymptotic residual degree distribution for NBLDPC codes. Our approach to compute the residual degree distribution on the check node side is not efficient as {{it is based on}} enumeration of all the possible connections on the check node side which satisfy the decoding failure criterion. So, the computation of the asymptotic check node side residual degree distribution and further part of our analysis is performed for NBLDPC codes over GF 2 m with m = 2. In order to show that asymptotically almost every code in such LDPC ensemble has a rate equal to the <b>design</b> <b>rate,</b> we generalize the argument of the Maxwell construction to NBLDPC codes, defined over GF 22.

40|$|Abstract—Magnetic {{stimulation}} of neural tissue {{is an attractive}} technology because neural excitation may be affected without requiring implantation of electrodes. Pulsed discharge circuits are typically implemented for clinical magnetic stimulation systems. However, pulsed discharge systems can confound in vitro experimentation. As an alternative to pulsed discharge circuits, we present a circuit to deliver asymmetric current pulses for generation of the magnetic field. We scaled the system down using ferrite cores for the excitation coil. The scaled system allows observation using electrophysiological techniques and preparations not commonly used for investigation of magnetic stimulation. The design was refined using a comprehensive set of design equations. Circuit modeling and simulation demonstrate that the proposed system is effective for stimulating neural tissue with electric field gradients generated by time varying magnetic fields. System performance is verified through electrical test.

40|$|Abstract—In this paper, we {{consider}} cross-layer optimization in wireless networks with wireless broadcast advantage, {{focusing on the}} problem of distributed scheduling of broadcast links. The wireless broadcast advantage is most useful in multicast scenarios. As such, we include network coding in our design to exploit the throughput gain brought in by network coding for multicasting. We derive a subgradient algorithm for joint rate control, network coding and scheduling, which however requires centralized link scheduling. Under the primary interference model, link scheduling problem is equivalent to a maximum weighted hypergraph matching problem that is NP-complete. To solve the scheduling problem distributedly, locally greedy and randomized approximation algorithms are proposed and shown to have bounded worst-case performance. With random network coding, we obtain a fully distributed cross-layer design. Numerical results show promising throughput gain using the proposed algorithms, and surprisingly, in some cases even with less complexity than cross-layer design without broadcast advantage.
