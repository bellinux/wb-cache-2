25|$|In every discourse, {{whether of}} the mind conversing with its own thoughts, or of the {{individual}} in his intercourse with others, there is an assumed or expressed limit within which the subjects of its operation are confined. The most unfettered <b>discourse</b> <b>is</b> that in which the words we use are understood in the widest possible application, and for them the limits of discourse are co-extensive {{with those of the}} universe itself. But more usually we confine ourselves to a less spacious field. Sometimes, in discoursing of men we imply (without expressing the limitation) that it is of men only under certain circumstances and conditions that we speak, as of civilised men, or of men in the vigour of life, or of men under some other condition or relation. Now, whatever may be the extent of the field within which all the objects of our discourse are found, that field may properly be termed the universe of discourse. Furthermore, this universe of <b>discourse</b> <b>is</b> in the strictest sense the ultimate subject of the discourse.|$|E

25|$|A {{referring}} expression (RE), in linguistics, is any noun phrase, or {{surrogate for}} a noun phrase, whose function in <b>discourse</b> <b>is</b> to identify some individual object (thing, being, event...) The technical terminology for identify differs {{a great deal}} from one school of linguistics to another. The most widespread term is probably refer, and a thing identified is a referent, as for example in the work of John Lyons. In linguistics, the study of reference relations belongs to pragmatics, the study of language use, though it is also a matter of great interest to philosophers, especially those wishing {{to understand the nature of}} knowledge, perception and cognition more generally.|$|E
25|$|For example, while formal {{linguistics}} {{takes the}} sentence {{to be the}} canonical unit of analysis, conversation analysis (CA) takes the turn at talk as canonical. Speakers in conversation often do not use complete sentences or even complete words to converse.

In CA, the form and meaning of an utterance {{is a product of}} situated activity- which is to say meaning is highly contextual (within a social, interactive context) and contingent upon how participants respond to each other regardless of grammatical completeness of an utterance.|$|E
25|$|The {{issue of}} {{circular}} migration {{and its relation}} to development is especially relevant today. First, understanding the importance of transnationalism and the temporary and repetitive movement of migrants between countries has facilitated new thinking, specifically with regards to remittances and organized labor schemes. Second, the “win-win-win” <b>discourse</b> <b>is</b> being considered seriously as a potential option for development to provide benefits for all parties involved. Third, in the current political climate many parts of the developed world are against migration, so circular migration is an option that policy makers believe is more in touch with public opinion. Lastly, advances in technology have enabled government officials to monitor migrants as they move between their home and host countries.|$|E

40|$|In this study, we {{applied the}} text-change {{paradigm}} {{to investigate whether}} and how discourse hierarchy affected the memory representation of a discourse. Three kinds of three-sentence <b>discourses</b> <b>were</b> constructed. In the hierarchy-high condition and the hierarchy-low condition, the three sentences of the <b>discourses</b> <b>were</b> hierarchically organized and the last sentence of each <b>discourse</b> <b>was</b> located at the high level and {{the low level of}} the discourse hierarchy, respectively. In the linear condition, the three sentences of the <b>discourses</b> <b>were</b> linearly organized. Critical words were always located at the last sentence of the <b>discourses.</b> These <b>discourses</b> <b>were</b> successively presented twice and the critical words were changed to semantically related words in the second presentation. The results showed that during the early processing stage, the critical words were read for longer times when they were changed in the hierarchy-high and the linear conditions, but not in the hierarchy-low condition. During the late processing stage, the changed-critical words were again found to induce longer reading times only when they were in the hierarchy-high condition. These results suggest that words in a discourse have better memory representation when they are located at the higher rather than at the lower level of the discourse hierarchy. Global <b>discourse</b> hierarchy <b>is</b> established as an important factor in constructing the mental representation of a discourse...|$|R
25|$|In the 1980s, supertitles (sometimes called surtitles) {{began to}} appear. Although supertitles were first almost universally {{condemned}} as a distraction, today many opera houses provide either supertitles, generally projected above the theatre's proscenium arch, or individual seat screens where spectators {{can choose from}} more than one language. TV broadcasts typically include subtitles even if intended for an audience who knows well the language (for example, a RAI broadcast of an Italian opera). These subtitles target not only the hard of hearing but the audience generally, since a sung <b>discourse</b> <b>is</b> much harder to understand than a spoken one—even in the ears of native speakers.

25|$|For a {{majority}} of black women feminism has failed to accurately and holistically describe them as individuals {{to the world that}} surrounds them. They feel as though it takes something new that is not already bound to a predetermined master in order to capture this new movement. Womanism is something that Alice Walker can completely identify with without having second thoughts; it feels natural to her. Feminism does not. When distinguishing between feminism and womanism {{it is important to remember}} that many women find womanism easier to identify with. In addition, a key component of a womanist <b>discourse</b> <b>is</b> the role that spirituality and ethics has on ending the interlocking oppression of race, gender, and class that circumscribes the lives of African-American women.|$|E
25|$|Marie de Romieu’s <b>discourse</b> <b>is</b> closely {{based on}} part of a 1554 work by Charles Estienne, titled Paradoxes, which are notions {{contrary}} to the common opinion. Estienne’s work, in turn, was itself based on Paradoxes, a work by Italian humanist author Ortensio Lando. Lando’s piece was mainly a list of “exemplary ladies”, while Estienne builds onto that by omitting some Italian names and adding some French ladies to it. De Romieu, however, took it further. She follows Estienne’s prose, adding women she thought were deserving of praise. She paid {{special attention to the}} role of educated women, especially her contemporary female poets, praising in her Discourse other French female writers, such as Catherine de Clermont, Marguerite de Navarre, and Madeleine and Catherine des Roches. Notably, she removed the names of women who were entirely devoted to serving their husbands, as well as women who attempted to hide their accomplishments from public view.|$|E

40|$|This {{purpose of}} this study was to explore the grief of daughters on the death of their mothers. I interviewed fifteen women. This study draws on feminist post-structuralist {{insights}} into subjectivity as constructed in the interplay, and between socially available discourses. I identified three interrelated and co-existing discourses through which the metadiscourse of grief arose. These <b>discourses</b> <b>were</b> continuity, discontinuity and silencing. Two distinct patternings of the <b>discourses</b> <b>were</b> identified within the corpus of the text, and these seemed to be shaped primarily by the age of the woman when her mother died. These <b>discourses</b> <b>are</b> considered and collated within the social/historical context in which medical and psychological notions of grief have been hegemonic, and other subordinated and lay <b>discourses</b> <b>are</b> emerging. I suggest the understanding of oneself as a daughter in grief changes over time. The women interviewed in this study showed a 'desire' not to 'get over it' and disconnect, but to incorporate a continuing bond with the mother. How this is achieved is explained...|$|R

25|$|The {{rhetoric and}} {{composition}} pedagogy {{developed in the}} late nineteenth century, and still used in many schools today, is known as current-traditional rhetoric, commonly referred to among field scholars, and hereinafter, as “CTR.” CTR is defined by an emphasis on the final product, usually the five-paragraph, informal essay or short research paper on an objective topic. In addition, CTR centers around the notion that <b>discourse</b> <b>is</b> delivered in a prescribed, mechanical form, leading to its pedagogical focus on grammar, spelling, syntax, and uniform style and arrangement. Further, CTR promotes the idea that the purpose of writing is the product, which is expected to reflect a predefined, stagnant reality without consideration for process, authorial identity, or audience. For example, a CTR pedagogue might instruct his or her students to write an essay on bicycles; the expected outcome is an objective discussion of bicycles organized in a five-paragraph essay, the identity of the audience or the writer is not to be considered, and the goal is the final product—the “essay”— which should have no errors (or even intentional boundary-breakers) in grammar, spelling, or design. James Berlin and Robert Inkster examine typical CTR textbooks and evaluate their limited approach to teaching composition, concluding that CTR limits “discovery procedures,” diminishes the “importance of the writer,” and restricts writer engagement with audience. Likewise, W. Ross Winterowd similarly contends that the pedagogy of CTR is dated and ultimately ineffective in his examination of a number of current-traditional textbooks.|$|E
25|$|Colonialism was a {{capitalist}} venture moved by appropriation and plundering of foreign lands. It {{was supported by}} military force and a discourse that legitimized its violence {{in the name of}} progress and a universal civilizing mission. This <b>discourse</b> <b>is</b> complex and multi-faceted. It was elaborated in the 19th century by colonial ideologues such as Joseph-Ernest Renan and Arthur de Gobineau, but its roots reach far back in history. In Rethinking Postcolonialism: Colonialist Discourse in Modern Literature and the Legacy of Classical Writers, Amar Acheraiou discusses the history of colonialist discourse and traces its spirit to ancient Greece, including Europe’s claim to racial supremacy and right to rule over non-Europeans harboured by Renan and other 19th century colonial ideologues. He argues that modern colonial representations of the colonized as “inferior”, “stagnant” and “degenerate” were borrowed from Greek and Latin authors like Lysias (440-380 BC), Isocrates (436-338 BC), Plato (427-327 BC), Aristotle (384—322 BC), Cicero (106-43 BC), and Sallust (86-34 BC), who all considered their racial others – the Persians, Scythians, Egyptians as “backward”, “inferior”, and “effeminate”. Among these ancient writers Aristotle is the one who articulated more thoroughly these ancient racial assumptions, which served as a source of inspiration for modern colonists. In The Politics, he established a racial classification and ranked the Greeks superior to the rest. He considered them as an ideal race to rule over Asian and other ‘barbarian’ peoples, for they knew how to blend the spirit of the European “war-like races” with Asiatic “intelligence” and “competence”.|$|E

40|$|The aim of {{this study}} is to analyze the discourses of activists who work against female genital mutilation/cutting (FGM/C) in Tanzania. The study focus on the discourses that arise during {{interviews}} about FGM/C with five activists.

How do these discourses interact together – <b>are</b> there any <b>discourse</b> conflicts? How do the activists talk about FGM/C in comparison to our western view?
