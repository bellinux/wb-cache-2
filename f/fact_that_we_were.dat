I can still appreciate how odd it was that we had the chance to do that because it doesn’t really happen in a lot of cases.|$|E
500|$|Cinematographer Ben Davis, {{who also}} worked with Marvel on Guardians of the Galaxy, shot the film with a main unit of three Arri Alexa cameras. Davis said, [...] "Although the Alexa was Marvel's {{preferred}} camera, we weren't locked into that choice from the start. What wasn't negotiable was the <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>were</b> shooting digital: that's how Marvel shoots all of its films." [...] Davis also used Blackmagic Design's Pocket Cinema Cameras {{to meet the needs}} of the second unit kit explaining, [...] "The second unit typically needs a fleet of smaller cameras that are less expensive and are rugged enough to handle the various trials by fire, as it were, that we throw at them." [...] About the camera system, Whedon stated that this film was shot very differently from the first one; using lots of long lenses, and that he aimed to shoot the film almost like a documentary. To create the scenes depicting how Quicksilver views the world, scenes were shot with an ultra-high-speed camera and later combined with shots of Taylor-Johnson moving through the same scene at normal speed.|$|E

2500|$|After {{the season}} had ended, Edwin Denby, a Michigan player {{who later became}} U.S. Secretary of the Navy, wrote {{an account of the}} season in the {{university}} yearbook, The Palladium. With respect to the Harvard game, Denby noted that the Michigan football team had traveled to [...] "the distant and holy places of the East" [...] and proved to the Eastern press [...] "that we were farmers, miners, cutthroats, thugs and garroters, and to the reasonable people of the country that the men who came out of the West knew one or two games besides mumblepeg and marbles." [...] Denby continued that the loss to Harvard was [...] "a virtual victory" [...] and asserted that those best qualified to judge were of the opinion that, [...] "given equal conditions," [...] Michigan would have won:"We had traveled twenty-four hours by rail and rested less than two days before going on the field, we had changed drinking water and diet, we played before some thousands of Harvard sympathizers (though they displayed an impartial appreciation of the good plays of either side, and acted throughout in a thoroughly gentlemanly manner) and finally we played in the rain and on wet and slippery ground, conditions entirely new to us. And so they won, and, even as to that, there were not wanting whispers that without a fortuitous accident — however, post-mortems are always distasteful. Let us accept the <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>were</b> beaten, and record our intention of turning the tables next year. It is poor policy to belittle a successful antagonist. Better exalt him for the supreme skill he displayed in winning from such a foe, and so honor yourself." ...|$|E
2500|$|On 6 September 2008, Quo Vadis {{played a}} concert at The Medley in Montreal, at which Stéphane Paré {{confirmed}} that Yanic and {{him would be}} leaving the band, leaving Bart as the only original member still left in the band. Bart speculated that {{the distance between the}} band and Yanic contributed to his departure; [...] "With regard to Yanic, I know {{it was a very difficult}} decision to make on his part. People change, priorities change, personal situations change and he's been flying in from Tennessee for all the shows so you can imagine with the recent developments in the US/gas prices/travel and the <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>were</b> working remotely on the new record had probably something to do with it. I guess sometimes you have to make difficult decisions and this one was Yanic's. For sure on my end I will miss him on stage and working with him because he's been like a brother to me for 15 years and we've been through so much together." [...] At the same show, Bart's right knee, which had both ligaments torn away in a sports injury, gave in completely and he supported his entire weight on his left knee for the rest of the show. However, this was to no avail as eventually Rob [...] "The Witch" [...] from Necronomicon and Stephane from BCI had to carry Bart around for the rest of the set, eventually having him sit up on a chair for the remainder of the show. Stéphane proposed cutting the show short but Bart refused and played on till the end. In the following months, both his knees had to have surgery.|$|E

2500|$|In January 2013, it was {{revealed}} that due to the success of Texas Chainsaw 3D, Millennium Films began planning a sequel film to be called Texas Chainsaw 4 which was expected to begin filming later in 2013 in the state of Louisiana. Millennium Films Chairman Avi Lerner stated that the project was brought to him by Christa Campbell and Lati Grobman and that Millennium had signed on to produce, with Lionsgate distributing the finished product. Executive producer Mark Burg clarified that the sequel was prematurely announced and had not been authorised, [...] "The rights are controlled by Carl [...] and Main Line Pictures, no matter what Millennium says. Millennium simply sold the foreign rights and they will not tell us when a sequel is ready to be made. The script was developed by Carl, myself and writer/director John Luessenhop. Maybe they're looking for something to sell at Berlin, but they have no right to announce this sequel." [...] The idea for a prequel came when Seth M. Sherwood was given the chance to pitch the film to the studio. Dissatisfied with the inconsistencies of the franchise's continuity, he opted to make a Chainsaw film that wasn't just another sequel to the original: [...] "My pitch was always about doing it completely out of left field and making it different. The first thing I said to Millennium was 'I bet I can tell you what everybody else is pitching you and it’s X-Y-Z, but I want to do 1-2-3', and luckily, that's the direction they were interested in going as well." [...] The script was approached as a story of identity, based on the statements given by Tobe Hooper and Gunnar Hansen on how the character Leatherface is entirely devoid of personality beyond the masks he wears and what his family commands him to do. Sherwood chose not to have Leatherface be born as intellectually disabled, finding the story of a functional person that has their mental capabilities reduced to be more fascinating. Producer Les Whedon detailed the reasoning behind accepting Sherwood's pitch: [...] "What interested and enticed us about this production was the <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>were</b> presented with an opportunity to re-invent the franchise. It was the opportunity to almost go behind-the-scenes into the beginning of how Leatherface was created. What happened? Who is Leatherface and how did the whole character come to be?" [...] Despite the film's explanatory premise, co-director Julien Maury found it important to maintain some of the lead character's mystique, referring the project simply as [...] "moments from his young years." ...|$|E
2500|$|On September 13, 1920, Pickford {{gave his}} account of that night to the Los Angeles Herald-Examiner:We arrived back at the Ritz hotel at about 3 o'clock in the morning. I had already booked {{airplane}} seats for London. We were going Sunday morning. Both of us were tired out. We both had been drinking a little. I insisted that we had better not pack then, but rather get up early before our trip and do it then. I went to bed immediately. She fussed around and wrote a note to her mother. ... She was in the bathroom.Suddenly she shrieked: 'My God.' I jumped out of bed, rushed toward her and caught her in my arms. She cried to me {{to find out what}} was in the bottle. I picked it up and read: 'Poison.' It was a toilet solution and the label was in French. I realized what she had done and sent for the doctor. Meanwhile, I forced her to drink water in order to make her vomit. She screamed, 'O, my God, I'm poisoned.' I forced the whites of eggs down her throat, hoping to offset the poison. The doctor came. He pumped her stomach three times while I held Olive.Nine o'clock in the morning I got her to the Neuilly Hospital, where Doctors Choate and Wharton took charge of her. They told me she had swallowed bichloride of mercury in an alcoholic solution, which is ten times worse than tablets. She didn't want to die. She took the poison by mistake. We both loved each other since the day we married. The <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>were</b> separated months at a time made no difference in our affection for each other. She even was conscious enough the day before she died to ask the nurse to come to America with her until she had fully recovered, having no thought she would die.She kept continually calling for me. I was beside her day and night until her death. The physicians held out hope for her until the last moment, until they found her kidneys paralyzed. Then they lost hope. But the doctors told me she had fought harder than any patient they ever had. She held onto her life as only one case in fifty. She seemed stronger the last two days. She was conscious, and said she would get better and go home to her mother. 'It's all a mistake, darling Jack,' she said. But I knew she was dying.She was kept alive only by hypodermic injections during the last twelve hours. I was the last one she recognized. I watched her eyes glaze and realized she was dying. I asked her how she was feeling and she answered: 'Pretty weak, but I'll be all right in a little while, don't worry, darling.' Those were her last words. I held her in my arms and she died an hour later. Owen Moore was at her bedside. All stories and rumors of wild parties and cocaine and domestic fights since we left New York are untrue.|$|E
