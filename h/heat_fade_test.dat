40|$|Abstract. In this paper, a novel no-asbestos brake {{composite}} {{reinforced by}} natural bamboo fibers is studied. The bamboo fibers are modified by heat treatment, alkali treatment and coupling treatment respectively. Tribological performance of different fibers reinforced composites are developed {{by means of}} friction test and microstructure observation. The results show that heat treatment of bamboo fibers at 140 for 4 hours makes the friction and wear characteristics of brake composites more stable than the untreated ones, but poor wear resistance at low temperature and <b>heat</b> <b>fade</b> still exist. There is no significant change on fiber surface. The alkali treatment of 17 % NaOH solution for 12 hours contributes to desirable combination of higher friction coefficients and lower wear rates, and the surface morphology shows a number of deep grooves that avail the interface bonding. The effect of coupling treatment with KH 550 on tribological performance of composites have the similar rule {{to that of the}} alkali treated ones except of <b>heat</b> <b>fade,</b> and the fiber surface is evenly coated with the coupling agent, which enhances the bonding of fibers and resin but fails at elevated temperature...|$|R
40|$|Free-space optical (FSO) {{communication}} {{is a very}} attractive technology offering very high throughput without spectral regulation constraints, yet allowing small antennas (telescopes) and tap-proof communication. However, the transmitted signal has to travel through the atmosphere where it gets influenced by atmospheric turbulence, causing scintillation of the received signal. In addition, climatic effects like fogs, clouds and rain also affect the signal significantly. Moreover, FSO being a {{line of sight communication}} requires precise pointing and tracking of the telescopes, which otherwise also causes fading. To achieve error-free transmission, various mitigation techniques like aperture averaging, adaptive optics, transmitter diversity, sophisticated coding and modulation schemes are being investigated and implemented. Evaluating the performance of such systems under controlled conditions is very difficult in field trials since the atmospheric situation constantly changes, and the target scenario (e. g. on aircraft or satellites) is not easily accessible for test purposes. Therefore, with the motivation to be able to test and verify a system under laboratory conditions, DLR has developed a <b>fading</b> <b>testbed</b> that can emulate most realistic channel conditions. The main principle of the <b>fading</b> <b>testbed</b> is to control the input current of a variable optical attenuator such that it attenuates the incoming signal according to the loaded power vector. The sampling frequency and mean power of the vector can be optionally changed according to requirements. This paper provides a brief introduction to software and hardware development of the <b>fading</b> <b>testbed</b> and measurement results showing its accuracy and application scenarios...|$|R

40|$|The {{application}} of the single-aliquot regenerative-dose (SAR) protocol to equivalent dose determination in coarse-grain feldspar is investigated. An outline of the protocol is presented, and basic tests of its performance are discussed.

2500|$|Mountain bike {{disc brakes}} may range from simple, {{mechanical}} (cable) systems, to expensive and powerful, multi-piston hydraulic disc systems, commonly used on downhill racing bikes. Improved technology {{has seen the}} creation of vented rotors for use on mountain bikes, similar to those on cars, introduced to help avoid <b>heat</b> <b>fade</b> on fast alpine descents. Although less common, discs are also used on road bicycles for all-weather cycling with predictable braking, although drums are sometimes preferred as harder to damage in crowded parking, where discs are sometimes bent. Most bicycle brake discs are made of steel. Stainless steel is preferred due to its anti-rust properties. Discs are thin, often about 2mm. Some use a two-piece floating disc style, others use a floating caliper, others use pads that float in the caliper, and some use one moving pad that makes the caliper slide on its mounts, pulling the other pad {{into contact with the}} disc. Because the [...] "motor" [...] is small, an uncommon feature of bicycle brakes is that the pads retract to eliminate residual drag when the brake is released. In contrast, most other brakes drag the pads lightly when released so as to minimise initial operational travel.|$|R
40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{features the}} development of signal processing strategies for the estimation of channel impulse responses and the equalization {{of the effects of}} channels on communications signals propagating through them using the Discrete Wavelet Transform (DWT). The two strategies are developed as part of a wavelet-based signal processing platform, which can be used to enable reconfigurable radio transceivers. The approach taken is to recast standard discrete time-domain signal processing procedures into a DWT-based framework. To facilitate this, three equivalent techniques of DWT-based convolution that use both subband coding as well as polyphase filter implementations are devised. A DWT-based deconvolution procedure is derived analytically and is applied to perform estimation of several time-invariant multipath communications channels.

40|$|ABSTRACT. During the braking phase, {{the heat}} {{produced}} by friction between pads and disc cannot be entirely dissipated. Consequently, the brake disc, especially if very hard braking occur, can accumulate {{large amounts of}} heat {{in a short time}} so producing high gradients of temperature on it. Under these conditions, functionality and safety of the brake system can be compromised. The object {{of this study is to}} investigate, under extreme working conditions, the thermomechanical behaviour of different brake rotors in order to evaluate their efficiency and stability and to identify any compromising weakness on them. In particular, by means of FEM thermo-mechanical coupled analyses, one full disc and three ventilated rotors with different shapes have been studied. A very hard (<b>fading)</b> <b>test</b> has been used to evaluate the performances of the discs in terms of temperature distribution, stresses and strains. Obtained results demonstrate that the analysed ventilated discs, unlike the full rotor, can be effectively used in very hard working conditions, always ensuring high safety levels.

The crescent-shaped piece is called the Web and contains holes and slots in different shapes for return springs, hold-down hardware, parking brake linkage and self-adjusting components. All the application force of the wheel cylinder is applied through the web to the lining table and brake lining. The edge of the lining table generally has three “V"-shaped notches or tabs on each side called nibs. The nibs rest against the support pads of the backing plate to which the shoes are installed.Each brake assembly has two shoes, a primary and secondary. The primary shoe is located {{toward the front of}} the vehicle and has the lining positioned differently from the secondary shoe. Quite often, the two shoes are interchangeable, so close inspection for any variation is important. Linings must be resistant to heat and wear and have a high friction coefficient unaffected by fluctuations in temperature and humidity.Materials that make up the brake shoe include, friction modifiers (which can include graphite and cashew nut shells), powdered metal such as lead, zinc, brass, aluminium and other metals that resist <b>heat</b> <b>fade,</b> binders, curing agents and fillers such as rubber chips to reduce brake noise.|$|R

The technique was initially developed in the mid 1980 ’s, to do pre proof printing. It soon became clear that, though the technique had many aesthetic qualities, it also had poor qualities when it came to stability. It lacked light fastness and was very sensitive to high relative humidity levels (RH) and changes in RH. Research and testing of digital printing techniques have always been done, but for the most part, only to develop new, qualitative and cost effective techniques for the industry. Poor lightning policies can have immense impact on all art prone to fading. The IRIS prints have shown to fade more than other digital printing techniques and since the printers are no longer in common use, all IRIS prints can be viewed as originals. Many IRIS prints are also printed on different fine art paper and with different ink-sets i. e. all IRIS prints are different. This thesis will conduct MFT (micro <b>fading</b> <b>testing)</b> of IRIS prints and inkjet model materials.
