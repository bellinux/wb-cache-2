2500|$|Cheeses {{and eggs}} {{were only a}} small part of the Parisian diet, since there was no {{adequate}} refrigeration and no rapid way to deliver them to the city. The most common cheeses were those of the nearest region, Brie, and then those from Normandy. Fresh fruits and vegetables from the Paris region, potatoes, and <b>dried</b> <b>vegetables,</b> such as lentils and white beans, completed the diet.|$|E
2500|$|In the cities, fresh {{vegetables}} were expensive, and therefore, the poorer city dwellers {{had to make}} do with <b>dried</b> <b>vegetables.</b> Lentil soup ( [...] phakē) was the workman's typical dish. Cheese, garlic, and onions were the soldier's traditional fare. In Aristophanes' Peace, the smell of onions typically represents soldiers; the chorus, celebrating the end of war, sings Oh! joy, joy! No more helmet, no more cheese nor onions! Bitter vetch ( [...] orobos) was considered a famine food.|$|E
2500|$|Canning {{technology}} {{had just}} begun to be developed, and it gained in popularity through the period of westward expansion. [...] Initially, only upper-class migrants typically used canned goods. There are references in sources to canned cheese, fruit, meat, oysters, and sardines. By the time Marcy wrote his 1859 guide, canned foods were increasingly available but remained expensive. Canning also added weight to a wagon. [...] Rather than canned vegetables, Marcy suggested that travelers take <b>dried</b> <b>vegetables</b> which had been used in the Crimean War and by the U.S. Army.|$|E

2500|$|By the {{beginning}} of 1980, 95% of the [...] "basic shopping basket" [...] of foods were sold in metric quantities, {{with only a few}} products not being sold in prescribed metric quantities. The final report of the Metrication Board catalogues <b>dried</b> <b>vegetables,</b> dried fruit, flour and flour products, oat products, cocoa and chocolate powder, margarine, instant coffee, pasta, biscuits, bread, sugar, corn flakes, salt, white fats, dripping and shredded suet as being sold by prescribed metric quantities while no agreement had been reached with the industry regarding jam, marmalade, honey, jelly preserves, syrup, cereal grain and starches.|$|E
2500|$|Shipton deplored the extravagant {{lifestyle}} practised by {{the earlier}} British expeditions. He consulted a nutritionist at the Lister Institute to determine an efficient diet producing 4000 Calories {{a day in}} conjunction with locally sourced food. Lentils, <b>dried</b> <b>vegetables</b> and powdered milk were on the menu {{with the addition of}} cod liver oil along with ascorbic acid and ferrous sulphate tablets. This contrasted with the caviare, foie gras, quails' eggs and lobster of 1933 and even Shipton later admitted [...] "In 1935 I went rather too far the other way: it was bad policy to force people who were quite unused to rough food to make such a complete break with their normal diet." ...|$|E
2500|$|Finding food {{soon became}} the first preoccupation of the Parisians. The {{authorities}} of the German occupation transformed French industry and agriculture into a machine for serving Germany. Shipments to Germany had first priority; what was left went to Paris {{and the rest of}} France. All of the trucks manufactured at the Citroen factory went directly to Germany. (Later many of these trucks were cleverly sabotaged by the French workers, who recalibrated the dip sticks so that the trucks would run out of oil without notice). The greatest share of shipments of meat, wheat, milk produce and other agricultural products also went to Germany. What remained for the Parisians was strictly rationed, following the creation on 16 June 1940 of the Ministère de l'agriculture et du ravitaillement (Ministry of Agriculture and Supply), which began to impose a system rationing as early as 2 August 1940, as per Décret du 30 juillet 1940: bread, fat, flour products, rice, sugar; then, on 23 October 1940: butter, cheese, meat, coffee, charcuterie, eggs, oil; in July 1941: and as the war went on: chocolate, fish, <b>dried</b> <b>vegetables,</b> (like peas and beans), potatoes, fresh vegetables, wine, tobacco... Products could be bought only upon presentation of coupons attributed to specific items and on the specific week in which they could be used. Parisians (and all the population of France) were divided into seven categories depending upon their age, and allotted a certain amount of each product each month. A new bureaucracy, employing more than nine thousand city employees, with offices at all schools and the city hall of each arrondissement, was put into place to administer the program. The system resulted in long lines and frustrated hopes, since promised products often never appeared. Thousands of Parisians regularly made the long journey by bicycle to the countywide, hoping to come back, with vegetables, fruit, eggs and other farm products.|$|E

60|$|Turan waited, listening. He {{heard no}} sound. Then he {{advanced}} {{to the door and}} placed an ear against it. All was silence in the street beyond. A sudden draft must have closed the door, or perhaps it was the duty of the patrol to see to such things. It was immaterial. They had evidently passed on and now he would return to the street and continue upon his way. Somewhere there would be a public fountain where he could obtain water, and the chance of food lay in the strings of <b>dried</b> <b>vegetables</b> and meat which hung before the doorways of nearly every Barsoomian home of the poorer classes that he had ever seen. It was this district he was seeking, and it was for this reason his search had led him away from the main gate of the city which he knew would not be located in a poor district.|$|E
60|$|Mark {{had adopted}} {{a system of}} diet and a care of his person, that kept him in perfect health, illness being the evil that he most dreaded. His food was more than half vegetable, several plants having come forward even in the winter; and the asparagus, in particular, {{yielding}} {{at a rate that}} would have made the fortune of a London gardener. The size of the plants he cut was really astounding, a dozen stems actually making a meal. The hens laid all winter, and eggs were never wanting. The corned pork gave substance, as well as a relish, to all the dishes the young man cooked; and the tea, sugar and coffee, promising to hold out years longer, the table still gave him little concern. Once in a month, or so, he treated himself to a bean-soup, or a pea-soup, using the stores of the Rancocus for that purpose, foreseeing that the salted meats would spoil after a time, and the <b>dried</b> <b>vegetables</b> get to be worthless, by means of insects and worms. By this time, however, there were fresh crops of both those vegetables, which grew better in the winter than they could in the summer, in that hot climate. Fish, too, were used as a change, whenever the young man had an inclination for that sort of food, which was as often as {{three or four times a}} week; the little pan-fish already mentioned, being of a sort of which one would scarcely ever tire.|$|E
