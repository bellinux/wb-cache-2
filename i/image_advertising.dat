40|$|Purpose - The {{purpose of}} this paper is to develop a set of {{research}} propositions concerned with how the alignment between socially responsible corporate image and corporate identity might be enhanced through the reduction of scepticism by considering diagnostic dimensions of the corporate social responsibility (CSR) <b>image</b> <b>advertising</b> claim. Design/methodology/approach - The paper reviews corporate <b>image</b> <b>advertising,</b> the tool investigated for informing about the firm 2 ̆ 7 s CSR record, discusses the scepticism construct and theoretical explanations of why this communication approach might induce scepticism, considers extant empirical findings that lend support to these theories, and describes several elements of CSR advertising claims considered to be diagnostic and capable of inhibiting scepticism responses to CSR image advertisements among consumers. Research propositions are advanced and discussed. Findings - The paper provides conceptual insights into reducing consumer scepticism toward CSR-based corporate identity communicated via corporate <b>image</b> <b>advertising.</b> Research limitations/implications - The paper advances four research propositions, and proposes a method for testing these propositions. Practical implications - The paper acknowledges the increase in CSR-based corporate <b>image</b> <b>advertising,</b> discusses why such communication approaches may be prone to consumer scepticism, and considers message elements to inhibit this persuasion-eroding cognitive response.

40|$|This chapter {{provides}} {{a discussion of}} the use of corporate <b>image</b> <b>advertising</b> to communicate the socially responsible identity claims of a corporation, an increasingly popular marketing communications technique. A brief history of corporate <b>image</b> <b>advertising</b> is provided, and its role, as it relates to corporate identity, and reputation, is explained. Why this marketing communication technique might inspire scrutiny from stakeholder audiences, particularly consumers, is discussed, drawing on extant information-processing theories and the contextual characteristics of corporate social responsibility-based identity portrayal using advertising. Examples are provided to illustrate the discussion. A recent experimental study investigating the manipulation of message variables to inhibit the formation of consumer skepticism toward such advertising messages is described and its results reported. Future research directions are also suggested...|$|E
40|$|In {{the wake}} of recent major {{business}} collapses, {{and as a result}} of growing stakeholder expectations that firms make a contribution to society beyond economic benefits, such as products and profits, business is increasingly engaging in non-economic activities to meet these expectations. These non-economic programs include social and environmental initiatives, and demonstrate a firm’s commitment to corporate social responsibility (CSR). Corporate <b>image</b> <b>advertising</b> is increasingly being used to create the awareness of a firm’s CSR initiatives, and, in turn, preference for its products and brands. CSR-based corporate <b>image</b> <b>advertising,</b> however, is problematic. We discuss this marketing communication technique, and propose a research agenda to investigate the ability of two message variables, social topic information and social impact claim specificity, to influence the earliest stage of attitudinal development, cognitive responses. We focus, in particular, on the potentially corrosive cognitive response of scepticism, and suggest that these message variables are possibly able to inhibit the development of consumer scepticism and build a positive reputation...|$|E

40|$|The {{heart of}} this paper is a model of social {{interaction}} in which players use costumes and other visible consumption goods as signals about the identity of other players. If these signals are informative enough, players use them to condition their social interaction. Importantly, accurate signals are mutually beneficial. This game is then wrapped in another in which players choose their costumes. There are many equilibria in this expanded game, some of which allow individuals to perfectly signal their type in all social interactions, and others of which do not. The perfect signaling equilibria Pareto dominate the others, but since there are many of them, the players face a difficult coordination problem. In this paper we explore the hypothesis that <b>image</b> <b>advertising</b> solves this coordination problem. Two implications of our theory are that <b>image</b> <b>advertising</b> campaigns are necessarily massive, and that the targeted audience for the advertising campaign is necessarily larger than the targeted group of buyers of the advertised product. We offer anecdotal evidence in support of both implications. 2 1...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{examines}} {{a monopoly}} firm’s decision on price and advertising {{in a market}} where exclusivity matters. Two forms of advertising are analyzed: (a) informative advertising, in which the firm provides real information about the product’s existence, features and quality, and (b) <b>image</b> <b>advertising,</b> in which the firm communicates an image for the product that allows buyers to associate themselves with. Consumers are both image-conscious and “snobbish. ” In other words, both image and exclusivity give them utility. Therefore, image advertis-ing increases consumers ’ willingness to pay {{even though they are}} assumed to be fully rational. In equilibrium only a fraction of consumers will buy the image good. We analyze the effects of income dispersion, the inherent nature of the product, and the existence of a strategic competitor on the equilibrium outcome and welfare. The monopolist makes lower profits selling to more snobbish con-sumers if the product is of high quality. An increase in consumers ’ snobbishness causes the share of <b>image</b> <b>advertising</b> to decrease if the product is of low quality. Also, it is shown that the monopolist advertises more than the two duopolists combined, and more consumers are served under monopoly than under duopoly, leading to an increase in total welfare...|$|E
40|$|Until recently, brand identities {{were built}} by firms via brand <b>image</b> <b>advertising.</b> However, the flourishingconsumer {{communication}} weakened the firms ’ grip on their brands. The interaction between advertising and consumer communications and their joint impact on brand identity is {{the focal point}} of this paper. We present a model in which consumer preference for functional attributes may correlate with the identity they desire to project of themselves. This correlation is known to the firm but not to the consumers. Both the firm and the consumers can communicate their desired brand identity, although the actual brand identity is determined endogeneously by the composition of consumers who purchase it (i. e., what types of people consume the brand). We find that sometimes the firm can strengthen the identity of its brand by refraining from advertising. This result is based on the following intermediate finding: advertising can diminish the endogeneous informativeness of consumer communications by making it one-sided. Furthermore, it turns out that refraining from brand <b>image</b> <b>advertising</b> may be optimal for the firm when the product is especially well positioned to create a strong identity—i. e., when consumer preferences for functional and self-expressive attributes are highly correlated.
