In doing so, we use the BDS statistic of Brock, Dechert, and Scheinkman (1987) for nonlinearity testing and then proceed to compute the Lyapunov spectra to determine to what degree futures data resemble a chaotic system. Although the results indicate the presence of nonlinearity, they fail to provide significant evidence of deterministic chaos. ...|$|R

It uses <b>daily</b> official <b>settlement</b> copper <b>prices</b> of LME in the spot and 3 month futures markets from 2000 - 2014. Initially, we use cointegration test and ECM to investigate the copper market efficiency. Then OLS, ECM, GARCH, EGARCH and ECM-GARCH models are employed to compute different optimum hedge ratios. Finally, the hedge effectiveness is measured based on minimization {{of the value of}} AIC and SBIC. Our result indicate that copper futures market is inefficient. Hedge effectiveness comparison concludes that ECM model gives the best hedging performance. However, ECM-GARCH is accounted to be the best model for hedging strategy since it captures the time-varying conditional heteroscedasticity to ECM model.

Ordinary Least Squared (OLS) method {{was used to}} compute Minimum-Variance hedging ratio (MVHR), R-squared and hedging effectiveness by using <b>daily</b> data from <b>settlement</b> <b>price</b> of crude palm oil futures contracts and spot price of crude palm oil. The empirical {{results indicate that the}} highest hedging ratio has been observed in the February 2009 FCPO contract, 66. 7660 %. Meanwhile, the lowest hedging ratio occurs in June 2010 contract which is 35. 7131 %. In overall, Malaysia FCPO market only provides a low level of hedging effectiveness (19 %- 53 %) due to less volatility of CPO spot price. As a conclusion, hedging effectiveness of crude palm oil futures market in Malaysia shows a low level of hedging effectiveness. This result indicates that the spot price of crude palm oil in Malaysia is relatively stable and consistent over the period of 2009 to 2011. The outcome of this research intends to provide hedging information of the Malaysia FCPO futures market in order to cover risk exposure by holding FCPO in BMD...|$|R

A cointegrating relationship among <b>settlement</b> <b>prices</b> is examined for the underlying long-run economic relationships. Cointegration tests and vector autoregressive models of the rates of return were unable to establish any long-run relationships among the variables.

40|$|Analyzing and {{forecasting}} price changes {{belongs to}} very actual themes nowadays. In {{comparison with the}} past, much more attention and researches are dedicated to forecasting methods also at the universities. In the following text we will present possibility of forecasting time series of <b>settlement</b> <b>prices</b> of chosen metals at the London Metal Exchange (LME), using extrapolation of time series. More specifically, we will forecast monthly averages of cash seller and <b>settlement</b> <b>price</b> of chosen metals (Tin, Aluminum, Copper and Zink) using exponential smoothing method. This method belongs to classic mathematical / statistical methods of forecasting, named also quantitative methods - based on technical analysis. To examine the mentioned method, we performed an empirical experiment using real data of LME. We used average monthly cash seller and <b>settlement</b> <b>prices</b> of chosen metals, in period from January 1990 till June 2006. The effort was to forecast monthly averages of metal prices 6 months ahead, while forecasts were done always {{from the beginning of}} each quarter from January 2001 till June 2006. Data, from which the forecasting model of exponential smoothing was outgoing, was always from January 1990, till quarter from which the model carried out a forecast on next 6 months. Forecasts achieved by this process were compared with real prices from LME, available in time of experiment realization. For the success measurement of each forecast were calculated forecast errors - M. E. (mean error), M. S. E. (mean squared error), M. A. E. (mean absolute error), M. A. P. E. (mean absolute percentage error), M. P. E. (mean percentage error) and SSE (sum of squared error) ...|$|R
