50|$|<b>Paper</b> <b>birch</b> trees {{themselves}} have varied reactions to wildfire. A group, or stand, of <b>paper</b> <b>birch</b> {{is not particularly}} flammable. The canopy often has a high moisture content and the under story is often lush green. As such, conifer crown fires often stop once they reach a stand of <b>paper</b> <b>birch</b> or become slower moving ground fires. Since these stands are fire resistant they may become seed trees to reseed the area around them which was burned. However, in dry periods <b>paper</b> <b>birch</b> is flammable and will burn rapidly. As the bark is flammable it will often burn and may girdle the tree.|$|R

40|$|Leaf {{morphology}} and anatomy {{have been}} found to vary considerably among tree species, and leaf characteristics have widely been used for analyzing plant growth and resource use strategies because of their structural adaptation to withstand environments. Considering the changing climate projections, early-successional, broad niched species like <b>paper</b> <b>birch</b> (Betula papyrifera Marsh.) are expected to increase dominance due to a zonal shift of natural vegetation and/or open gaps within the current vegetation zones. Hence, {{it is important to understand}} factors such as leaf characteristics that enable these pioneer species to inhabit a wide geographic range and their increasing dominance. <b>Paper</b> <b>birch</b> is a pioneer tree species in North America that inhabits wide climatic and geographic gradients; in addition, the species has developed different leaf morphology and anatomy that have allowed <b>paper</b> <b>birch</b> to adapt to diverse habitats. This study examines how the leaf characteristics of <b>paper</b> <b>birch</b> vary under uniform and stressed environments. The major objectives were (a) to investigate leaf characteristics variations in <b>paper</b> <b>birch</b> populations grown in uniform environmental conditions as in a greenhouse and a common garden; (b) to correlate between leaf characteristics and <b>paper</b> <b>birch?s</b> environment of origins; (c) to investigate leaf characteristic variations in <b>paper</b> <b>birch</b> populations grown under different carbon dioxide concentrations [CO 2] and soil water levels to determine the relationship between leaf characteristics and individual or interacting effects of [CO 2], water levels and populations; and (d) to analyze the relationship within and between leaf morphology and anatomy of the birch populations. The study found significant differences among <b>paper</b> <b>birch</b> populations in leaf morphological characteristics under a uniform environment at the greenhouse and the common garden. The leaf characteristic variations in the uniform environment may be related to the different genotypes of the birch inhabiting a wide environmental gradient. In <b>paper</b> <b>birch</b> populations grown in the common garden, significant differences in stomatal density, stomatal area, pore area and guard cell width were identified. As expected, the birch populations in greenhouse and common garden environments showed significant correlations of leaf characteristics, namely specific leaf area (SLA), leaf maximum width index and petiole area to latitude, longitude, elevation, temperature, precipitation and aridity index of origin. Correlation between leaf characteristics of <b>paper</b> <b>birch</b> in the greenhouse showed that populations originated in limited precipitation (during growing season) had low hair density on leaf adaxial surface, with larger leaf width and petiole area. Birch populations grown in the common garden revealed that populations originated in higher mean annual precipitation had less hair density on leaf adaxial surface with smaller leaf area and higher stomatal density. Relationships within the leaf characteristics revealed significant correlations within and between leaf morphology and anatomy as populations with larger leaf area had larger petiole area and less adaxial hair density in greenhouse. The larger petiole in larger leaf reflects the need for mechanical strengthening to support, whereas inverse relationship between leaf area and hair density possibly showed a strategy of the birch to balance water loss. In common garden, the birch populations with larger leaf area had larger specific leaf area and higher adaxial hair density but low stomatal density. All these features in <b>paper</b> <b>birch</b> populations provide a structural basis for reducing water loss through leaves and increasing water use efficiency. There was no consistency in leaf characteristics when the <b>paper</b> <b>birch</b> populations were grown in uniform environments as in the greenhouse and the common garden. Analysis of the leaf characteristics in the birch showed significant differences due to the interaction and/or main effects of [CO 2], water levels and populations. <b>Paper</b> <b>birch</b> had decreased leaf area and increased stomatal density under elevated [CO 2] which might have reduced stomatal conductance and increased water-use efficiency. Under low soil water level, <b>paper</b> <b>birch</b> populations studied had smaller stomatal area, pore area and guard cell width. Contrasting with the expectation neither stomatal area was larger nor stomatal density increased under low water level. A trade-off between stomatal area and density in this study showed that stomatal area per unit leaf area remained the same. Hence, smaller stomatal area and guard cell width under low water level must have improved [CO 2] diffusion and decreased water loss compared to larger stomatal area and guard cell width. The results of this study confirmed significant genotypic difference in leaf characteristics of <b>paper</b> <b>birch</b> populations irrespective of a uniform growing environment. The characteristics, namely leaf area, maximum width, SLA, stomatal density and stomatal area, appear related to the environment of origin; however, these relationships were not consistent in the birch populations grown in the greenhouse and common garden. <b>Paper</b> <b>birch</b> populations acclimated to the uniform environments; differences in leaf area, stomatal density and stomatal area in <b>paper</b> <b>birch</b> populations under different [CO 2] and soil water levels prove the birch?s ability to acclimate to environmental changes. Lastly, integration of leaf morphology and anatomy enhanced <b>paper</b> <b>birch?s</b> ability to balance between [CO 2] gain and water loss...|$|R

40|$|<b>Paper</b> <b>birch</b> is an ecologically {{valuable}} {{species with}} a broad geographic distribution and increasingly valuable commercial attributes. Its diversity, versatility and enduring nature make it an ideal candidate for a selective breeding program. However, {{an understanding of the}} genecology of the species and an understanding of the potential impacts of climate change will be fundamental to its success. The objectives of the trail were to determine if the phenotypic variability observed in <b>paper</b> <b>birch</b> for certain traits was due to genetics, the growing environment or an interaction between the two. Traits examined were bud flush (phenological) and height growth (morphological). Whether or not nursery practices were a factor was also examined. Twenty provenances of <b>paper</b> <b>birch</b> were collected from five regions in British Columbia (BC) and northern Idaho. Seedlings were grown at three nurseries in BC and Idaho and planted in a randomized single tree interlocking block design in three common gardens in BC and Idaho. Geographic variation in the timing of bud burst in <b>paper</b> <b>birch</b> is under genetic and environmental control. It follows climatic clines based on latitude, longitude and elevation. The signal for the onset of spring bud flush is determined by an interaction between air and soil temperature and photoperiod. Long distance displacement of provenances from their site of origin can lead to detrimental abiotic and biotic effects such as frost or pest damage. Differences in stock handling among nurseries and nursery displacement effects also influenced the growth and survival of some provenances. This information will be useful when developing seed zones and seed transfer guidelines for <b>paper</b> <b>birch</b> in BC. It will also help mitigate the potential impacts of climate change and will be beneficial if a selective breeding program is established.

We study how different species traits interact with disturbance frequency to change species dominance in the canopy, focusing on the effects of resprouting ability. We develop an individual-based model that simulates the dynamics of three species <b>paper</b> <b>birch</b> Betula papyrifera Marsh, white pine Pinus strobus L. and sugar maple Acer saccharum Marsh., characterized by different successional strategies, as observed in northern Minnesota forests. We tested (i) how different disturbance frequencies, (ii) sugar maple resprouting and (iii) <b>paper</b> <b>birch</b> resprouting change successional patterns. We show that three disturbance frequency classes produce three different outcomes, each dominated by a different species, with lower disturbance frequency favouring later successional species. The importance of resprouting ability for success in the canopy depends on the species' other life-history traits.
