5|$|The Order is {{dedicated}} to the principles of Charity, Unity, Fraternity, and Patriotism. A First <b>Degree</b> exemplification ceremony, by which a man joins the Order, explicates the virtue of charity.

5|$|Willamette {{also offers}} five 3+3 Programs to allow {{students}} to earn both an undergraduate <b>degree</b> and law <b>degree</b> {{in a total of}} six years.

5|$|A classic {{result of}} graph theory states that a graph of odd order (having an odd number of vertices) always {{has at least}} one vertex of even <b>degree.</b> (The {{statement}} itself requires zero to be even: the empty graph has an even order, and an isolated vertex has an even <b>degree.)</b> In order to prove the statement, it is actually easier to prove a stronger result: any odd-order graph has an odd number of even <b>degree</b> vertices. The appearance of this odd number is explained by a still more general result, known as the handshaking lemma: any graph has an even number of vertices of odd <b>degree.</b> Finally, the even number of odd vertices is naturally explained by the <b>degree</b> sum formula.|$|E

Experiment 2 (fixed field conditions) measured the effects of 22 h of storage without air in disposable containers maintained at four ambient temperatures (7 <b>degrees</b> C, 17 <b>degrees</b> C, 27 <b>degrees</b> C, 39 <b>degrees</b> C with semen at - 0. 5 <b>degrees</b> C to 3 <b>degrees</b> C, 4 <b>degrees</b> C to 7 <b>degrees</b> C, 8 <b>degrees</b> C to 10 <b>degrees</b> C, 12 <b>degrees</b> C to 15 <b>degrees</b> C, respectively). Per cycle pregnancy rate (PC) was measured after one artificial insemination (AI) in uterine body of 200 X 10 (6) total spermatozoa, 7 h (Experiment 1) or 17 h (Experiment 2) before ovulation. In Experiment 1, PC was similar for both conditions (60 % (n = 40 cycles) vs. 63 % (n = 40), respectively, 5 stallions X 8 cycles). Only velocity VCL and ALH were slightly higher at 15 <b>degrees</b> C.
