5|$|At home, Bart {{comes up}} with a {{character}} called Angry Dad, based on the frequent angry outbursts of his father, Homer. Bart rolls out the first issue of Angry Dad, which becomes a hit with the kids in school. During an autograph signing session in the schoolyard, Bart is approached by a spokesman for an Internet entertainment site. <b>He</b> <b>wants</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> Angry Dad into an online animated cartoon series, and Bart agrees in exchange for stock. The cartoon becomes an Internet hit, becoming the single most popular non-pornographic website of all time. The only one still unaware of Angry Dad is Homer, who finds out one day at work. Once the humiliated Homer gets home, he finds Bart and strangles him. Marge and Lisa stops him and calms him down, and Homer agrees to suppress his anger from that point on.|$|E
5|$|Meanwhile, Todd Packer (David Koechner) {{visits the}} office and announces that <b>he</b> <b>wants</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> amends for his past behavior. He makes rude remarks masked as apologies and hands out store-bought cupcakes. Pam Halpert (Jenna Fischer) argues {{that they should not}} eat the cupcakes, to spite Packer. She remains adamant on this point even after Packer leaves, but once Pam goes home the {{remaining}} employees eat the cupcakes. Packer reveals to the documentary crew that he spiked the cupcakes with drugs, supposedly as revenge for getting him fired (though none of the employees present save Nellie {{had anything to do with}} his being fired). He then visits Jim Halpert (John Krasinski) and Darryl Philbin (Craig Robinson) at Athlead in Philadelphia, pulling the same trick on them. In the morning, Pam returns to {{the office and}} announces she is going to eat her cupcake, only to find everyone else reeling from the aftereffects of Packer's deed.|$|E

He said, [...] "There's always that danger Lewis could fall back into his old ways, and he is down to his last penny. But at the moment, Lewis is trying his hardest and has no ulterior motive— just {{an awful lot of}} ice to break instead!" [...] Lewis returns the money he took from Peter, adding an extra {{thousand}} pounds as compensation. Havers said that Lewis feels desperately bad about what he did. Upon entering the Rovers, Lewis is punched by Deirdre. [...] Havers stated that Lewis wants Audrey to forgive him and [...] give him a second chance. Lewis finds Audrey charming and honest and he likes being mothered by her to an extent. Havers said that Lewis did fall in love with Audrey while they were together, but no one believes him as he has told so many lies, and thought Lewis' one redeeming feature was not taking Audrey's money when he had the chance. Havers added, [...] "He's been feeling terrible because he did the dirty on her and <b>he</b> <b>wants</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> amends." ...|$|E

500|$|New Phillies' bench coach Larry Bowa said, [...] "(Asche) {{reminds me}} of a younger Chase Utley, he gets real mad when he misses a ball, <b>he</b> <b>wants</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> every play, he wants to go out and work, you can't hit enough groundballs to him ... he's got a great {{attitude}} ... that kind of energy can invigorate a ball club." [...] Marcus Hayes, a writer for the Philadelphia Daily News concurred with Bowa's comparison of Asche to Utley, calling their similarities [...] "eerie", and writing, [...] "Already, Asche's solution to failure is to ignore fatigue; to work harder; to improve at all costs. His objective is not necessarily to hit home runs, or to hit a big payday, but, rather, to make sure he can beat out a ground ball in late September. Sound familiar?" [...] Sal Rende, the hitting coach for the Phillies' AAA affiliate, noted that Asche also has solid intangibles, including makeup and work ethic, garnering yet another comparison to Utley. For his part, Asche said that while he appreciates the comparison, he wants to be his own player. Asche's determination and work ethic contributed to his fast ascent through the Phillies minor league system. He is a perfectionist, who recalled a game in which he made three fielding errors as his most memorable game with the big league Phillies.|$|E
500|$|The American Broadcasting Company (ABC) {{characterized}} Hunt as [...] "confident", [...] "innovative", [...] "intelligent", {{while he}} {{also can be}} [...] "aggressive", [...] "brazen", [...] "presumptuous", [...] "hasty and rash". McKidd said of his character: [...] " [...] He's not an easy character to connect to, I think. There's some darkness to him and there's some danger to him that I think is really interesting and exciting to play. [...] " [...] Additionally, McKidd describes Hunt as [...] "very instinctive, and follows his gut, and he's very impulsive, and very immediate. He immediately assesses a situation. And he's very honest, sometimes painfully honest, with himself and with others. <b>He</b> <b>wants</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> himself better. He wants to improve himself as a person. He's a decent guy, {{a sort of a}} guy I'd like to go out and have a beer with." [...] Hunt's unorthodox teaching methods {{have been the subject of}} controversy. McKidd said of this: [...] The look of Owen has been described as hardcore and the antithesis of the other males on the show. McKidd says it's not just the look of Owen, but the fact that in his profession, he is dealing with life and death everyday. The one distinction he finds between his character and the others is that Owen does not care what other people think of him. When McKidd returned from his first appearance, his character appeared to have been changed. McKidd told TV Guide: [...] "Yes, that was who he really is in the premiere, but now we're seeing what can happen to a good man, a good soldier and good surgeon [...]" ...|$|E
500|$|Jack is {{put into}} the bear cage, and notices a handcuffed Juliet being led to his old prison. She visits him later and asks Jack to treat Ben's back, which has become {{infected}} following the surgery, but Jack refuses. She also explains that she is {{in trouble with the}} Others for killing Pickett. Later, Isabel (Diana Scarwid), the Others' [...] "sheriff," [...] arrives at the cage and discusses Jack's tattoo with him, as she can read the Chinese. Isabel brings him to a room where Juliet is being held and asks him whether Juliet told him to kill Ben or not. Jack lies and says she did not and is brought back to his cage. Once back, he is visited by Cindy Chandler (Kimberley Joseph) and the previously kidnapped members of the tail-section. Cindy starts to ask Jack questions, saying they are here to [...] "watch", but he angrily sends her away. Alex visits Jack later and tells him that the Others are planning to execute Juliet. Alex helps him escape from his cage, and they go to Ben Linus (Michael Emerson), who writes a note, sparing Juliet, in return for Jack's continuing to be Ben's doctor. The two then go to a trial the Others are holding for Juliet, and Alex gives Isabel Ben's note, which says Juliet is not to be executed, but is to be marked instead (with a branded symbol at the base of her spine). When Juliet later asks Jack why he helped her, he replies that it is because Ben said he would let both of them off the island and <b>he</b> <b>wants</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> that happen by working together. At the end of the episode, Jack and the Others travel back to the main island on a boat. Just before leaving, Isabel translates Jack's tattoo, [...] "He walks amongst us, but he is not one of us". Jack replies, [...] "That's what they say, that's not what they mean." ...|$|E

500|$|Jay Park's {{music is}} {{generally}} contemporary R and hip hop, {{but he also}} incorporates pop, dance, soul, electronic and acoustic into his songs. Prior to debuting with 2PM, Park was coached vocally by former SOLID member and renowned R artist Kim Jo-han, also known to be the vocal coach of many idols in the industry. Kim {{went on to say}} that [...] " [...] has an appealing and unique voice" [...] and [...] "definitely stood out amongst the rest". Park began to write rap lyrics since eighth grade. Since becoming a solo artist, he has complete creative control over his music : he writes and composes his own songs, produces his albums, chooses the people he wants to work with, and participates in the mastering and mixing of his songs, something almost unheard-of for a singer in the Korean music industry. More than making hit songs, Park says he wants people to hear to his style of music, to make them listen to [...] "Jay Park-sounding" [...] music. Being fluent in both English and Korean, Park writes songs in these two languages. He admits that he is more at ease when writing songs in English than in Korean, as he started learning Korean in his late teens. Having grown up listening to music of American artists, he admits his music sounds more [...] "American" [...] than K-Pop, saying it is the style of music <b>he</b> <b>wants</b> <b>to</b> <b>make,</b> while still being recognized as K-Pop. His musical process starts by listening to a lot of beats sent by various producers, while thinking of what kind of song he wants to write, and eventually short-listing a selection of potential beats to work with. Then, Park works on the melody of the song, along with ideas and lyrics. He writes the hook of the song first, and finally the verses. Park is inspired by everything when writing songs : [...] "just listening to good songs, seeing a good live performance, having good conversations with people. Just everyday life". Some songs Park wrote are influenced by songs from other artists, for example, his song [...] "Turn Off Your Phone" [...] (Korean: Revised Romanization: Jeonhwagireur Kkeonwa) from his album New Breed was inspired by Leessang's hit single [...] "Turn Off the TV ..." [...] (Korean: Revised Romanization: TV Reurkkeotne) from their 7th album Asura Balbalta.|$|E

2500|$|Since his injury, Lewis {{has been}} cleared to {{participate}} in organized team activities, including on-field work, but <b>he</b> <b>wants</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> sure he remains healthy for {{the rigors of the}} preseason.

[...] "I want to get confident with my knees right now so, when training camp starts, I'm full throttle and there's no holding back whatsoever." [...] When asked about off-season conditioning, Lewis replied: [...] "I think I'm a lot stronger, especially in my upper body. My lower body feels stronger than it was prior to the injury. I'm excited to see what I can do now with a year of NFL lifting and training without banging on (the knee)." [...] He competed for the starting job in the 2009 NFL Season.|$|E
2500|$|Uninterested in {{adopting}} others' opinions, with {{a penchant for}} discipline and thoroughness acquired in Germany, he became an adept of Stoicism, which accounts for his emphasis on ethical values, above all honesty. His devotion to honesty sometimes caused problems in social settings. Analyzing his style, particularly as found in his correspondence, philologist Cristina Florescu categorizes Philippide as a late Romantic, displaying [...] "impetuosity, idealism, a longing for a vanished time, imprudent and abrupt gestures", his flourishes meshing with his [...] "elevated consciousness of Romanian realities". She suggests that his spirit, in order to face a society he often shunned, took refuge in humor. His primary weapon was irony: [...] "whether acidic or gently sentimental, frequently hilarious but even more often stinging". His blend of satire, humor and irony made for a highly specific writing style. However, as argued by his friend Gheorghe T. Kirileanu, his speeches were uplifting, [...] "stirring up inside you, in the deepest parts of your soul, the pleasure to work and live." [...] According to Kirileanu, Philippide was cheereful only [...] "because <b>he</b> <b>wants</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> others happy"; his scatological jokes, however, were perfectly suited to annoy [...] "the delicate aristocrats", Simion Mehedinți and Matei B. Cantacuzino.|$|E

[...] Shari Bollers of Afridiziak stated [...] "All the characters were created to enable the audience to warm up to them and to laugh with and at them. With its switching of dual languages of native and English, it was easy to follow. It was a film that included everyone and warmed us with the humour. Whether Nigerian or not you will find this film funny." [...] Caitlin Pearson of The Africa Channel stated: [...] "What makes the plot of Phone Swap engaging are the performances from its all-star cast, and a visual range in its cinematography that allows us to see more of Nigeria than any claustrophobic Nollywood film could ever hope to do. [...] Francis McKay of Flick Hunter gave a 3 out of 4 stars and concluded: [...] "Kunle Afolayan crafted a highly watchable film with a good story and a cast led by two talented actors. The film is a good representation of Nigeria...".|$|E
