25|$|Much of {{the humor}} of The Order of the Stick {{is based on}} roleplaying games (particularly the Dungeons and Dragons 3rd Edition ruleset), with {{characters}} freely discussing game mechanics, such as experience points, skill sets, and random encounters. The characters <b>know</b> <b>very</b> <b>well</b> that {{they live in a}} world controlled by the rules of roleplaying games, but attempt to function normally within it, often with nonsensical results. Characters have been shown browsing through rulebooks for the D game to select a certain monster for use, or to learn about a new class. Common techniques of players and Dungeon Masters are spoofed, such as the weather of the campaign world changing to herald a dramatic encounter, or a player who does not bother to complete the details of his character's backstory. Burlew's satirical humor addresses many of the clichés of the fantasy genre as a whole, often by twisting them in new and different ways.|$|E

500|$|He {{represented}} a Mafia that controlled power {{and did not}} let power control them, according to German sociologist Henner Hess. To make a good impression, or fare figura, is important: [...] "they enjoy the respect shown them, they enjoy power, {{but they do not}} wish to give rise to its discussion. They <b>know</b> <b>very</b> <b>well</b> that behind the veil of modesty power is felt to be all the more uncanny."

500|$|Offa died on 29 July 796, and may {{be buried}} in Bedford, {{though it is not}} clear that the [...] "Bedeford" [...] named in that charter was {{actually}} Bedford. He was succeeded by his son, Ecgfrith of Mercia, but according to the Anglo-Saxon Chronicle Ecgfrith died after a reign of only 141 days. A letter written by Alcuin in 797 to a Mercian ealdorman named Osbert makes it apparent that Offa had gone to great lengths to ensure that his son Ecgfrith would succeed him. Alcuin's opinion is that Ecgfrith [...] "has not died for his own sins; but the vengeance for the blood his father shed to secure the kingdom has reached the son. For you <b>know</b> <b>very</b> <b>well</b> how much blood his father shed to secure the kingdom on his son." [...] It is apparent that in addition to Ecgfrith's consecration in 787, Offa had eliminated dynastic rivals. This seems to have backfired, from the dynastic point of view, as no close male relatives of Offa or Ecgfrith are recorded, and Coenwulf, Ecgfrith's successor, was only distantly related to Offa's line.|$|E
500|$|Lê Duẩn {{departed}} from Marxist/Leninist orthodoxy {{when it came}} to practical policy and stated that the country had to [...] "carry out agricultural cooperation immediately, even before having built large industry." [...] While he acknowledged that his view was heresy, Lê Duẩn insisted that Vietnam was in a unique situation; [...] "It seems that no country so far in history has been in a situation such as ours. We must lead the peasantry and agriculture immediately to socialism, without waiting for a developed industry, though we <b>know</b> <b>very</b> <b>well</b> that without the strong impact of industry, agriculture cannot achieve large-scale production and new relations of agriculture cannot be consolidated... To proceed from small-scale production to large-scale production is a new one." [...] According to Lê Duẩn the key to socialism was not mechanisation and industrialisation, but a new division of labour. He also believed that cooperatives {{did not need to be}} autarkic, but rather [...] "organically connected, through the process of production itself, with other cooperatives and with the state economic sector." [...] Vietnam could achieve this through state intervention and control. He saw the economy as one whole directed by the state and not many parts intertwined.|$|E
500|$|Critics {{considered}} [...] "Subtle Invitation" [...] {{to be one}} of the album's strongest songs {{because of}} its [...] "well executed" [...] jazz influence. The song begins with the sounds of people dining, then introduces the strong bassline and drums. Towards the end of the song, Carey belts out the climax. Sarah Rodman from The Boston Herald described it as fascinating and wrote, [...] "it sounds as though Carey is singing in falsetto while still in her chest voice." [...] "Clown" [...] drew strong media attention, and its lyrical content led critics to speculate that Carey aimed it at rapper Eminem, who had publicly announced that he had had a relationship with Carey. Rodman said [...] "Clown" [...] was [...] "languidly sinister", with lyrics such as, [...] "I should've left it at 'I like your music too'...You should never have intimated we were lovers / when you <b>know</b> <b>very</b> <b>well</b> we never even touched each other." [...] Critics compared [...] "I Only Wanted" [...] with [...] "My All"s instrumentation and structure of verse, chorus and guitar solo. According to Sal Cinquemani from Slant Magazine, Carey makes vague allusions to her ex-husband Tommy Mottola with the line, [...] "Wish I'd stayed beneath my veil". The song uses Latin-inspired guitar instrumentation and wind sounds as an additional backbone to the melody, and dripping water as its percussion.|$|E

500|$|In 2002, Eminem {{mentioned}} the singer twice on The Eminem Show, his fourth studio album, {{on the tracks}} [...] "Superman" [...] and [...] "When the Music Stops", {{both of which were}} revealed to have been inspired by their relationship in Eminem's 2008 autobiography, The Way I Am. The former track contained the lyrics [...] "What you trying be? My new wife? / What, you Mariah? Fly through twice," [...] while the latter suggested that he begged to be taken back by Carey. Later that year, Eminem confirmed that they had been in a relationship in an interview for Rolling Stone, but claimed to have not been fully committed to it and that he disliked her as a person, while Carey told Maxim that it was never a [...] "sexual relationship" [...] and interviewer Larry King [...] "I hung out with him, I spoke to him on the phone. I think I was probably with him a total of four times. And I don't consider that dating somebody." [...] Carey recorded a song called [...] "Clown" [...] for Charmbracelet which [...] "ambiguously addressed the relationship" [...] with the lyrics [...] "Should've left it at I like your music too" [...] and [...] "You should've never intimated we were lovers/ When you <b>know</b> <b>very</b> <b>well</b> we never even touched each other." ...|$|E
500|$|In their {{accounts}} afterward, British officers and soldiers alike noted their frustration that the colonial militiamen fired {{at them from}} behind trees and stone walls, rather than confronting them in large, linear formations {{in the style of}} European warfare. [...] This image of the individual colonial farmer, musket in hand and fighting under his own command, has also been fostered in American myth: [...] "Chasing the red-coats down the lane / Then crossing the fields to emerge again / Under the trees {{at the turn of the}} road, / And only pausing to fire and load." [...] To the contrary, beginning at the North Bridge and throughout the British retreat, the colonial militias repeatedly operated as coordinated companies, even when dispersed to take advantage of cover. [...] Reflecting on the British experience that day, Earl Percy understood the significance of the American tactics: During the whole affair the Rebels attacked us in a very scattered, irregular manner, but with perseverance & resolution, nor did they ever dare to form into any regular body. Indeed, they knew too well what was proper, to do so. Whoever looks upon them as an irregular mob, will find himself much mistaken. They have men amongst them who <b>know</b> <b>very</b> <b>well</b> what they are about, having been employed as Rangers against the Indians & Canadians, & this country being much covered with wood, and hilly, is very advantageous for their method of fighting.|$|E
500|$|From {{the year}} 2001 onwards, Eminem {{claimed to have}} dated Carey for six months {{throughout}} the gloomy times in her life. Carey denied ever having {{been involved with the}} rapper in a personal relationship, claiming that they had only met a handful of times, and it was professional. Subsequently, he referred to Carey in several of his songs in a negative light, claiming to have been angered by her not admitting to seeing him. On Charmbracelet, Carey included a song titled [...] "Clown", which critics suggested was aimed at Eminem. [...] "Clown"'s lyrics were described as [...] "languidly sinister" [...] by Sarah Rodman of The Boston Globe, and read: [...] "I should've left it at 'I like your music too'...You should never have intimated we were lovers / When you <b>know</b> <b>very</b> <b>well</b> we never even touched each other." [...] In 2005, during concerts on the rapper's Anger Management Tour, he began playing voice-mails and recordings that were reportedly left by Carey. One of the messages said: [...] "I heard you were getting back with your ex-wife. Why won't you see me? Why won't you call me?". After playing the excerpt, Eminem would pretend to be sick before launching into his song [...] "Puke". On May 12, 2009, Eminem released his sixth studio album Relapse, which included the song [...] "Bagpipes from Baghdad". The song's lyrics suggested Eminem was still in love with Carey and [...] "wanted her back": [...] "I want another crack at ya" [...] and [...] "Nick Cannon better back the f**k up. I'm not playing, I want her back, you punk." [...] After the song's release, Cannon went on his website, defending Carey and expressing his disgust at the rapper's comments: ...|$|E

2500|$|In 1886, Carte raised Helen's {{salary to}} £1,000 a year plus a 10% {{commission}} {{on the net}} profits of all business at his theatres. [...] According to historian Jane Stedman, [...] "When she demurred, he wrote, 'You <b>know</b> <b>very</b> <b>well,</b> and so do all those who know anything about my affairs, that I {{could not have done}} the business at all, at any rate on nothing like the same scale, without you'". Carte's first wife had died in 1885, and Helen married Richard on 12 April 1888 in the Savoy Chapel, with Sir Arthur Sullivan acting as Carte's best man.|$|E

I <b>know</b> <b>very</b> <b>well</b> that these moral weaknesses are chronic, that there is no hope of cure". But the greatest suffering came from outside Carmel. On 23 June 1888, Louis Martin disappeared from his home and was found days later, in the post office in Le Havre. The incident marked the onset of her father's decline. He died on July 29, 1894.|$|E
2500|$|In casting Good Morning, Miss Bliss, Peter Engel {{knew the}} success of the show would not hinge on Miss Bliss herself, but on her students. Engel {{particularly}} envisioned one character, Zack Morris, who [...] "would be that incorrigible kid who could lie to your face, letting you <b>know</b> <b>very</b> <b>well</b> that he's lying, and make you love him for it all the same." [...] Engel insisted that the show could not go on without Zack Morris, but {{he turned out to be}} one of the most difficult characters to cast. Engel's casting director, Shana Landsburg, finally happened across fourteen-year old Mark-Paul Gosselaar and was immediately struck by the teen's charisma, charm, and good looks. After a quick read-through, Gosselaar was immediately given the role.|$|E
2500|$|How {{many times}} {{has it been}} said that the art {{movement}} called Cubism is extinguished?

I replied that I had heard this much doubted, upon which he said Reuss had written it and it was so! He would send me the despatch to read if I liked, but I have declined. I did not say what I thought, which is that for thirty years I have had the experience of how many lies Prince Bismarck's diplomatic agents (with some exceptions) have written him, and therefore I usually disbelieve what they write completely, unless I know them to be honest and trustworthy men. Szechenyi, the Ambassador at Berlin, whom we <b>know</b> <b>very</b> <b>well,</b> tells me that there had been no scenes with the Emperor, who said to Szechenyi: Dies ist der erste Kummer, den mein Sohn mir macht.|$|E

[...] So I went to Bob Anderson, the Secretary of the Navy, and I said, [...] "There is machinery in the law which is very strict about the promotion and the Secretary can't dictate, but there is a way that you can write in a precept a certain qualification that you want, and we can write it so strongly that they can't accept anybody but Rickover."

2500|$|Sometime during 1965 Ibárruri {{flew from}} Paris to Dubrovnik to {{apologize}} {{as president of}} the PCE to Josip Broz Tito. On May 17, 1948, the Cominform, successor to the ECCI, had expelled Yugoslavia from the community of Socialist countries and Ibárruri had lent her voice and pen to his censure. The 20th Congress of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union held February 14–26, 1956, repudiated the charges against Yugoslavia. Now Ibárruri {{came face to face with}} the man she had slandered. She started to apologize profusely, but Tito cut her short and said, [...] "Do not vex yourself, Dolores, do not worry. I <b>know</b> <b>very</b> <b>well</b> how things worked in those days. I know it perfectly. Furthermore, believe me, I most likely would have done what you did had I been in your situation." [...] Ibárruri returned to visit Yugoslavia several times thereafter. In late December 1965 the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet of the USSR decorated Ibárruri with an Order of Lenin medal. A total of 431,418 decorations were given out between 1930 and 1991, but only seventeen went to foreigners.|$|E
