5|$|In Matthew 27:49 {{the codex}} {{contains}} added text: ἄλλος δὲ λαβὼν λόγχην ἔνυξεν αὐτοῦ τὴν πλευράν, καὶ ἐξῆλθεν ὕδορ καὶ αἷμα (the other took a spear and pierced <b>His</b> <b>side,</b> <b>and</b> immediately came out water and blood). This reading {{was derived from}} John 19:34 and occurs in other manuscripts of the Alexandrian text-type.|$|E
5|$|On July 20, 1951, King Abdullah I {{was shot}} three times by a Palestinian gunman {{as he entered}} the mosque, killing him. His {{grandson}} Prince Hussein, was at <b>his</b> <b>side</b> <b>and</b> was also hit, though a medal he was wearing on his chest deflected the bullet.|$|E
5|$|The {{following}} {{night the}} goddess of death appeared {{to him in a}} dream standing at <b>his</b> <b>side,</b> <b>and</b> declared that in three days time she would clasp him in her arms. It was no idle vision, for after three days the acute pain of his injury brought his end.|$|E
60|$|He {{straightened}} himself. His {{back was}} towards her. She put her two hands on <b>his</b> <b>sides,</b> <b>and</b> ran them quickly down.|$|R
60|$|They saw {{the colour}} leave his face. They saw his arms drop limply to <b>his</b> <b>sides,</b> <b>and</b> <b>his</b> eyes dilate with obvious sudden fear.|$|R

5|$|Ann becomes consumptive and Mary {{travels with}} her to Lisbon in hopes of nursing her back to health. There they are {{introduced}} to Henry, who {{is also trying to}} regain his health. Ann dies and Mary is grief-stricken. Henry and Mary subsequently fall in love but are forced to return to England separately. Mary, depressed by her marriage to Charles and bereft of both Ann and Henry, remains unsettled, until she hears that Henry's consumption has worsened. She rushes to <b>his</b> <b>side</b> <b>and</b> cares for him until he dies.|$|E
5|$|At {{the end of}} chapter 51 of Gylfaginning, High {{describes}} how the gods caught and bound Loki. Skaði is described as having taken a venomous snake and fastening it above the bound Loki, so that the venom may drip on to Loki's face. Loki's wife Sigyn sat by <b>his</b> <b>side</b> <b>and</b> held a bowl out. The bowl catches the venom, but when the bowl becomes full Loki writhes in extreme pain, causing the earth to shake and resulting in what we know as an earthquake.|$|E
5|$|In Matthew 27:49, Codex C {{contains}} added text: ἄλλος δὲ λαβὼν λόγχην ἒνυξεν αὐτοῦ τὴν πλευράν, καὶ ἐξῆλθεν ὖδορ καὶ αἳμα (the other took a spear and pierced <b>His</b> <b>side,</b> <b>and</b> immediately {{came out}} water and blood). This reading {{was derived from}} John 19:34 and occurs in other manuscripts of the Alexandrian text-type (א, B, L, Γ, 1010, 1293, pc, vgmss).|$|E
60|$|As if {{from the}} {{relaxation}} of effort {{he seemed to}} be seized with violent pain. He pressed his hands to <b>his</b> <b>sides</b> <b>and</b> bent forward.|$|R
60|$|I {{asked this}} in some alarm, because {{the little man}} was rolling about in his seat, holding <b>his</b> <b>sides,</b> <b>and</b> growing very red in the face.|$|R
60|$|Here {{the chief}} broke off, got up, placed {{his hands on}} both <b>his</b> <b>sides</b> <b>and</b> roared with laughter, until the anxious {{sentinels}} outside believed that he had gone mad.|$|R
5|$|As a {{hurricane}} approaches Quahog, Rhode Island, the Griffin family prepares for its arrival. In his own attempt {{to pass the}} time, Brian decides to use magic mushrooms, to the curiosity of Stewie. As the mushrooms start to take effect on Brian, he begins having hallucinations and eventually cuts his own ear off. Stewie tries to help Brian by staying by <b>his</b> <b>side</b> <b>and</b> taking care of him, but Brian continues to perceive himself in an ugly world where he is continually attacked by various monsters resembling the Griffins and Quagmire. Brian eventually snaps out of the hallucination after Stewie helps him downstairs to drink some water.|$|E
5|$|Despite of the {{internal}} opposition of Fernando de la Rúa, Alfonsín got his party to approve the pact. He reasoned that Menem would be supported by the eventual referendum, that many legislators would turn to <b>his</b> <b>side,</b> <b>and</b> he would eventually be able to amend the constitution reinforcing presidential power rather than limiting it. Still, as both sides feared a betrayal, all {{the contents of the}} pact were included as a single proposal, not allowing the Constituent Assembly to discuss each one separately. The Broad Front, a new political party composed of former Peronists, led by Carlos Álvarez, grew in the elections for the Constituent Assembly. Both the PJ and the UCR respected the pact, which was completely approved. Duhalde made a similar amendment to the constitution of the Buenos Aires province, in order to be re-elected in 1995. Menem won the elections with more than 50% of the vote, followed by José Octavio Bordón, and Carlos Álvarez. The UCR finished third in the elections for the first time.|$|E
5|$|Having won both League and Cup in {{separate}} seasons with two clubs, Chapman {{was determined to}} go one better and win the Double – which {{had not yet been}} won in the 20th century – in 1931–32 but ended up missing out on both, finishing second in the League behind Everton and losing the 1932 FA Cup Final controversially to Newcastle United, with Newcastle's equaliser coming after the ball had gone behind for a goal kick. Undeterred, Chapman kept faith with <b>his</b> <b>side</b> <b>and</b> launched a bid for the 1932–33 title. However, it was during this season that Arsenal suffered one of the most infamous defeats in their history.|$|E
6000|$|... "Skimmer or flyer, we {{have him}} now, dead under our lee, with a sandy beach on three of <b>his</b> <b>sides,</b> <b>and</b> {{the wind in}} his eye!" [...] cried the first-lieutenant.|$|R
6000|$|... "Chug-a-rum!" [...] said Grandfather Frog {{and held}} on to <b>his</b> <b>sides</b> <b>and</b> opened <b>his</b> mouth very wide in a {{noiseless}} laugh, for Grandfather Frog never makes a sound when he laughs.|$|R
5000|$|... "Bill {{held his}} head {{lower and lower}} and his wings further and further out from <b>his</b> <b>sides,</b> <b>and</b> prodded away harder and harder at the ground behind, but it wasn’t any use." ...|$|R
5|$|He {{believed}} {{that he and his}} men had secured Dai Do and wasn't expecting a sudden massive counterattack by the NVA. Company G took cover in the village cemetery and the fight raged through the night. The next morning, the bodies of more than three hundred enemy soldiers lay near their positions. Vargas's battalion commander arrived on the scene and ordered a renewed assault on the village. He carried to safety a Marine whose arm had been severed, and when the soldier pleaded for his arm, Vargas went back and found it. When the battalion commander, fighting like any other rifleman, was shot in the back three times, Vargas dragged him a hundred yards to an evacuation point, firing at the enemy as he went with an AK-47 he had picked up on the battlefield. By {{the end of the third}} day of battle, the North Vietnamese retreated and Vargas finally allowed himself to be treated for a bullet wound in <b>his</b> <b>side</b> <b>and</b> shrapnel from mortar blasts.|$|E
5|$|Meanwhile, {{the others}} {{arrive at the}} cabin for the hunting trip. Leslie (Amy Poehler) proves to be an {{excellent}} hunter and bags the first quail. Growing increasingly agitated, Ron agrees to a challenge that Leslie cannot shoot more birds than he can, and they split up. After {{a few hours of}} hunting, Ron screams and the others rush to <b>his</b> <b>side</b> <b>and</b> find he has been shot in the head. Ann, a nurse, takes Ron back to the cabin, where he is absolutely furious even though the injury is not serious. Ron asks whether Leslie shot him, but she insists she did not. Ron takes several pain pills and washes it down with scotch, which forces Ann and Leslie to hold his mouth open and induce vomiting, despite fierce opposition from Ron himself.|$|E
5|$|The {{conflict}} had {{the potential}} to spark another international war since Wolfgang William wanted to have the still not demobilized army of Lorraine, which continued to operate in the region despite the Peace of Westphalia, to intervene on <b>his</b> <b>side,</b> <b>and</b> Frederick William sought support of the Dutch Republic. The latter however followed a policy of neutrality and refused to aid Frederick William's campaign, which was furthermore opposed by the Imperial estates as well as the local ones. Politically isolated, Frederick William aborted the campaign after the Treaty of Cleves negotiated by Imperial mediators in October 1651. The underlying religious dispute was only solved in 1672. While military confrontations were avoided and the Brandenburg-Prussian army was primarily occupied with stealing cattle (hence the name), it considerably lowered Frederick William's reputation.|$|E
60|$|They {{heard an}} inordinate roar of laughter, {{and there was}} Diabolus sitting {{opposite}} to them, holding <b>his</b> <b>sides,</b> <b>and</b> lashing <b>his</b> tail about, {{as if he would}} have gone mad with glee.|$|R
5000|$|Juan Manuel Abras Contel ( [...] ; February 1, 1975) is a Swedish-born {{classical}} music composer, conductor and musicologist of European origin (Catalan and Galician on <b>his</b> father's <b>side</b> <b>and</b> Basque, Italian and French on <b>his</b> mother's <b>side)</b> <b>and</b> European and Argentine citizenship.|$|R
60|$|The Captain put {{his hands}} to <b>his</b> <b>sides</b> <b>and</b> laughed till the tears coursed down his cheeks. Checking his mirth at last, he called to Souvestre, who was {{retreating}} in disgust and anger.|$|R
5|$|While Busby was in {{hospital}} {{recovering from the}} injuries he sustained in the air crash, his managerial duties were left to his assistant, Jimmy Murphy. After Busby recovered, he set about rebuilding <b>his</b> <b>side,</b> <b>and</b> within five years, in 1963, he had won the FA Cup {{for the first time}} in 15 years. This was followed up by two league titles in three years, and then the greatest prize in European club football, the European Cup. He continued as manager for one more year after this success, leaving his managerial duties to club trainer Wilf McGuinness. McGuinness struggled in his new post, however, and Busby was convinced to return for the second half of the 1970–71 season. However, he retired from football permanently that summer, and was succeeded that summer by Frank O'Farrell. O'Farrell's stay was short-lived, though, as his inability to control George Best's extravagances forced the board to sack him with three years still to run on his contract.|$|E
5|$|At the old lady's house, Gary {{has been}} fed a lot. The old lady puts out fresh sheets of flyers {{given to her}} by Patrick. Upon reading them, Gary realizes that SpongeBob truly loves him and wants him back. He tries to leave, but instead of doing that, he ends up going to the closet, filled with empty snail shells. When the old lady tries to feed him again, Gary finds that the old lady most likely has {{sinister}} motives—she is possibly trying to fatten and then eat him. He makes his escape, but the old lady chases him out onto the streets. Gary quickly finds one of the gangster snails he saw before, which the old lady now mistakes for Miss Tuftsy, and takes him home instead. Back home, SpongeBob gives up on his search for Gary, and tries to forget about him by taking a walk, but his memories keep coming to mind and upsetting him. He is constantly reminded as the streets are filled with posters and signs for Gary. SpongeBob then hears a meow. At first he thinks he is imagining Gary is there, but then he turns around to find Gary is actually at <b>his</b> <b>side,</b> <b>and</b> he is overjoyed to see his beloved pet again.|$|E
5|$|In a {{biological}} symbiosis one organism typically shores up some weakness or deficiency of the other(s). As {{in such a}} symbiosis, Odin the father of all humans and gods, though in human form was imperfect by himself. As a separate entity he lacked depth perception (being one-eyed) and he was apparently also uninformed and forgetful. But his weaknesses were compensated by his ravens, Hugin (mind) and Munin (memory) {{who were part of}} him. They perched on his shoulders and reconnoitered {{to the ends of the}} earth each day to return in the evening and tell him the news. He also had two wolves at <b>his</b> <b>side,</b> <b>and</b> the man/god-raven-wolf association was like one single organism in which the ravens were the eyes, mind, and memory, and the wolves the providers of meat and nourishment. As god, Odin was the ethereal part—he only drank wine and spoke only in poetry. I wondered if the Odin myth was a metaphor that playfully and poetically encapsulates ancient knowledge of our prehistoric past as hunters in association with two allies to produce a powerful hunting alliance. It would reflect a past that we have long forgotten and whose meaning has been obscured and badly frayed as we abandoned our hunting cultures to become herders and agriculturists, to whom ravens act as competitors.|$|E

5|$|Ramsey dropped Alan Ball and John Connelly {{and brought}} in Terry Paine and Martin Peters, whose {{advanced}} style of play as a midfielder matched the qualities Ramsey looked for in his system. England beat Mexico 2–0. Ramsey replaced Terry Paine with Ian Callaghan for their final group match, against France. England won 2–0, securing qualification to the knockout rounds. Two difficult situations arose from the final group match, however. After making a vicious tackle and being cautioned, midfielder Nobby Stiles came under fire from senior FIFA officials, who called for Ramsey to drop him from the side. Ramsey strongly disagreed, and told the FA to inform FIFA that either Stiles would remain in his team or Ramsey himself would resign. Another bad tackle was committed during that match, resulting in Tottenham striker (and one of England's most prolific goal-scorers) Jimmy Greaves being injured and sidelined {{for the next few}} matches. Despite having more experienced strikers in his squad, Ramsey selected young Geoff Hurst as Greaves's replacement, once again seeing potential in the young West Ham forward. The France match also marked Ramsey's final game with a winger. After it, he dropped Ian Callaghan from <b>his</b> <b>side</b> <b>and</b> brought back Alan Ball to strengthen the midfield.|$|E
5|$|The {{campaign}} {{starts in}} 1476 as Francisco leads Portuguese troops under Prince Juan {{to victory in}} the Battle of Toro by destroying Aragonese military camps and capturing Cardinal Mendoza and the Duke of Alba. He then launches raids on supporters of Queen Isabella. In the end, the battle is indecisive, but King Afonso receives assurances from Spain that the African coast and eastern waters are a Portuguese domain. Thirteen years later, in 1489, Francisco serves the now-King Juan, in a mission to consolidate Portuguese control of Tangiers at an island outpost in the Loukkos River led by Afonso de Albuquerque, defending the area from Barbary pirates. He is then appointed Viceroy of Portuguese India by King Manuel, and sets sail for his new post. He plunders the Swahili coast along the way there, razing Mombasa. He then establishes Portuguese India in Cannanore and Cochin and confronts the Zamorin of Calicut who intends to undermine Portuguese rule of India, and who has suborned the allegiance of Kolathiri Raja with gold; Francisco then plunders the Malabar coast. He then moves to the Gujarati coast. Afonso de Albuquerque is sent by King Manuel to relieve Francisco of his post and send him to Portugal to face accusations of misconduct in the Indies. Francisco hears of the news of his son's death {{at the hands of}} a Egyptian fleet led by Amir Husain and refuses to return until he avenges his son's death. He converts Afonso de Albuquerque to <b>his</b> <b>side</b> <b>and</b> then takes revenge on his enemies in the Battle of Diu in 1509, including the Egyptian Mamelukes and the Ottomans. This being done, he sets sail for Portugal, being slain by Khoikoi warriors in modern-day South Africa while gathering water.|$|E
