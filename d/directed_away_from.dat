5|$|In Fig.2, the {{corresponding}} {{part of the}} revolving orbit is mn with s as its centre of force. Assume that initially, {{the body in the}} static orbit starts out at right angles to the radius with speed V. The body in the revolving orbit must also start at right angles and assume its speed is v. In the case shown in Fig. 1., v > V and the force is directed towards S. The argument applies equally if v < V. Also, the force may be <b>directed</b> <b>away</b> <b>from</b> the centre.|$|E
5|$|The second group, plates 48 to 64, {{detail the}} effects of the famine which ravaged Madrid from August 1811 until after Wellington's armies liberated the city in August 1812. Starvation killed 20,000 people in the city that year. In these plates, Goya's focus is <b>directed</b> <b>away</b> <b>from</b> the {{generalised}} scenes of slaughter of anonymous, unaligned people in unnamed regions of Spain; he turns towards a specific horror unfolding in Madrid. The famine was a result of many factors. For example, French invaders and Spanish guerrillas and bandits blocked paths and roads into the city, hampering the provision of food.|$|E

25|$|The main role of {{the city}} was as a trading place {{throughout}} the history, as it sat at the crossroads of two trade routes and mediated the trade from India, the Tigris and Euphrates regions and the route coming from Damascus in the South, which traced the base of the mountains rather than the rugged seacoast. Although trade was often <b>directed</b> <b>away</b> <b>from</b> the city for political reasons , it continued to thrive until the Europeans began to use the Cape route to India and later to utilize the route through Egypt to the Red Sea.|$|E

25|$|Earth's axis remains tilted in {{the same}} {{direction}} with reference to the background stars throughout a year (regardless of where it is in its orbit). This means that one pole (and the associated hemisphere of Earth) will be <b>directed</b> <b>away</b> <b>from</b> the Sun at one side of the orbit, and half an orbit later (half a year later) this pole will be directed towards the Sun. This is the cause of Earth's seasons. Summer occurs in the Northern hemisphere when the north pole is directed toward the Sun. Variations in Earth's axial tilt can influence the seasons and is likely a factor in long-term climate change (also see Milankovitch cycles).|$|E
25|$|In {{his army}} office, Napoleon tells 14-year-old Eugène de Beauharnais (Georges Hénin) {{that he can}} keep his {{executed}} father's sword. The next day, Joséphine arrives with Eugène to thank Napoleon for this kindness to her only son. The general staff officers wait for hours while Napoleon clumsily tries to convey his feelings for Joséphine. Later, Napoleon practises his amorous style {{under the guidance of}} his old friend Talma, the actor. Napoleon visits Joséphine daily. Violine is greatly hurt to see Napoleon's attentions <b>directed</b> <b>away</b> <b>from</b> herself. In trade for agreeing to marry Napoleon, Joséphine demands of Barras that he place Napoleon in charge of the French Army of Italy. Playing with Joséphine's children, Napoleon narrowly misses seeing Barras in her home. Joséphine hires Violine as a servant.|$|E

2500|$|Problem solving, {{according}} to prominent cognitive psychologists, {{is fundamental to}} learning. It resides as an important research topic in educational psychology. A student is thought to interpret a problem by assigning it to a schema retrieved from long-term memory. A problem students run into while reading is called [...] "activation." [...] This is when the student's representations of the text are present during working memory. This causes the student to read through the material without absorbing the information {{and being able to}} retain it. When working memory is absent from the readers representations of the working memory they experience something called [...] "deactivation." [...] When deactivation occurs, the student has an understanding of the material and is able to retain information. If deactivation occurs during the first reading, the reader does not need to undergo deactivation in the second reading. The reader will only need to reread to get a [...] "gist" [...] of the text to spark their memory. When the problem is assigned to the wrong schema, the student's attention is subsequently <b>directed</b> <b>away</b> <b>from</b> features of the problem that are inconsistent with the assigned schema. The critical step of finding a mapping between the problem and a pre-existing schema is often cited as supporting the centrality of analogical thinking to problem solving.|$|E
2500|$|Then, as {{food prices}} rose and {{the signs of}} famine became readily visible around July or August 1942, the Government of Bengal and the Bengal Chamber of Commerce devised a Foodstuffs Scheme that {{provided}} preferential distribution {{of a number of}} goods and services to workers in essential war industries, to prevent them from leaving their jobs, stating, [...] "the maintenance of essential food supplies to the industrial area of Calcutta must be ranked on a very high priority among the government's wartime obligation." [...] Rice was <b>directed</b> <b>away</b> <b>from</b> the starving rural districts to workers in industries considered vital to the military effort– particularly in the area around Greater Calcutta. By December of that year, the total number of individuals covered (workers and their families) was approximately a million; during the brief crisis {{in the aftermath of the}} air raids on Calcutta, this high number forced the government to seize rice by force from mills and warehouses in Greater Calcutta. Essential workers also benefited from ration cards, a network of [...] "cheap shops" [...] which provided essential supplies at discounted rates, and direct, preferential allocation of supplies such as water, medical care, and antimalarial supplies. They also received subsidised food, free transportation, access to superior housing, regular wages and even mobile cinema units for the workers' entertainment. Their workers were also frequently paid in part in weekly allotments of rice sufficient to feed their immediate families, further protecting them from inflation.|$|E
60|$|Only one trivial matter marred their easy explorations;--his boots {{remained}} unlaced. No propitious {{moment came}} when he could stoop and lace them. He was not a dexterous man with eyelets, and stooping made him grunt and his head swim. He hoped these trailing imperfections went unmarked.

She on her part could not determine whether he would be displeased or not if she noticed this slight embarrassment and asked him to set it right. They were quite long leather laces and they flew about with a sturdy negligence of anything but their own offensive contentment, like a gross man who whistles a vulgar tune as he goes round some ancient church; flick, flock, they went, and flip, flap, enjoying themselves, and sometimes he trod on one and halted in his steps, and sometimes for a moment she felt her foot tether him. But man is the adaptable animal and presently they both became more used to these inconveniences and more mechanical in their efforts to avoid them. They treated those laces then exactly as nice people would treat that gross man; a minimum of polite attention and all the rest pointedly <b>directed</b> <b>away</b> <b>from</b> him....|$|E
