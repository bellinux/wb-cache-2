30|$|In the {{semantic}} analysis <b>of</b> <b>video,</b> how to extract {{the semantic}} concept of human thinking from video content {{is the focus of}} this research field. Crossing the semantic gap and achieving semantic concept level video retrieval is the most challenging research content in video content research. The most common methods for solving such problems are to construct a semantic index of a specific domain through semantic analysis and semantic extraction <b>of</b> <b>video</b> content. For sports video, it generally has a relatively uniform semantic structure and shooting mode, so there is a certain convenience for the semantic analysis of sports events. Semantic analysis <b>of</b> <b>video</b> data, efficient retrieval <b>of</b> <b>video,</b> sharing <b>of</b> <b>video</b> data resources, and construction <b>of</b> <b>video</b> content analysis and management systems have far-reaching research significance and practical application value.|$|R
