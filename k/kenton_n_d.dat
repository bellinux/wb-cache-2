During the transmission, the power decays along path with the attenuation exponent α > 2. In REN and RDN, n nodes are randomly distributed in the square region with side-length √n and 1, respectively. We randomly choose n B nodes as the sources of multicast sessions, and for each source v, we pick uniformly at random <b>n</b> <b>d</b> nodes as the destination nodes. Based on percolation theory, we propose multicast schemes and analyze the achievable throughput by considering all possible values of n s and <b>n</b> <b>d</b> · As a special case of our results, we show that for n s = Θ(n), the per-session multicast capacity of RDN is Θ Equation Persented when <b>n</b> <b>d</b> = O Equation Persented and is Θ(1 /n) when <b>n</b> <b>d</b> = Ω Equation Persented the per-session multicast capacity of REN is Θ Equation Persented when <b>n</b> <b>d</b> = O Equation Persented and is Θ Equation Persented when <b>n</b> <b>d</b> = Ω Equation Persented. © 2009 IEEE...|$|R

Corner cuts were first investigated by Onn and Sturmfels [6], the original motivation stemming from computational commutative algebra. Let us write   N cut for the set of corner cuts of cardinality k; in the computational geometer’s terminology, these are the k-sets of <b>N</b> <b>d</b> 0. Among other things, Onn and Sturmfels d− 1 2 d give an upper bound of O(k d+ 1) for the size of   <b>N</b> <b>d</b> 0 when the dimension k cut is fixed. In two dimensions, it is known (see [3]) that # ¡   <b>N</b> <b>d</b> 0 = Θ(k log k). k cut We will see that in general, for any fixed dimension d, the order of magnitude ¡ of #   <b>N</b> <b>d</b> 0 k cut ¡ is between kd− 1 log k and (k log k) d− 1. (It has been communicated {{to me that the}} same bounds have been found independently by Gaël Rémond.) In fact,   N the elements of d 0 correspond to the vertices of a k certain polytope, and what our proof will show is that the above upper bound holds for the total number of flags of that polytope.
