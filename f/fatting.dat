40|$|It {{has been}} {{hypothesized}} that visceral <b>fat</b> releases {{free fatty acids}} and adipokines and thereby exposes the liver to <b>fat</b> accumulation. The authors aimed to evaluate current epidemiologic evidence for an association between abdominal <b>fat</b> and liver <b>fat</b> content. Clinical and epidemiologic studies with data on abdominal <b>fat</b> and liver <b>fat</b> content were reviewed. Studies using waist circumference to estimate abdominal <b>fat</b> mass suggested a direct association between abdominal <b>fat</b> and liver <b>fat</b> content. Studies using imaging methods suggested a direct association between intraabdominal <b>fat</b> and liver <b>fat</b> content, but not between subcutaneous abdominal <b>fat</b> and liver <b>fat</b> content. In conclusion, clinical and epidemiologic studies of abdominal <b>fat</b> and liver <b>fat</b> content suggest a direct association between abdominal <b>fat</b> and liver <b>fat</b> content which is probably accounted for by visceral <b>fat.</b> However, results from the included studies do not allow strong conclusions regarding the temporal sequence of events.

60|$|It {{was a very}} {{different}} Sunday from those to which Henrietta had been accustomed, in the complete quiet and retirement of Rocksand. The Hall was so far from the church, that there was but just time to get back in time for evening service.

60|$|It will be recollected, that, in a manner, all {{the bacon}} and pork {{consumed}} {{in this country}} (the far largest consumption of meat out of towns) is, when growing, fed on grass, and on whey or skimmed milk,--and when <b>fatting,</b> partly on the latter. This {{is the case in}} the dairy countries, all of them great breeders and feeders of swine; but for the much greater part, and in all the corn countries, they are fattened on beans, barley-meal, and pease. When the food of the animal is scarce, his flesh must be dear. This, one would suppose, would require no great penetration to discover.|$|E

There is one difference in the two cases, but only one-- that while the farmer can repay himself by eating the ox, the scientific man cannot repay himself by eating you; and so never gets paid, in most cases, at all.|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACT Data from 100 {{male and}} 100 female broiler {{chickens}} that were {{raised on the}} floor under two lighting regimes (12 and 24 hr light) were combined. Birds were weighed when 58 days old (male data presented first) (2372 g, 1913 g) and then slaughtered at 59 days. Abdominal <b>fat</b> was weighed (2. 18 %, 2. 82 %) and <b>fat</b> extracted from ground carcass (12. 0 %, 13. 7 % wet basis), intestines (47. 6 %, 56. 2 % dry basis), and from a triangular section of backskin (86. 1 %, 88. 0 % dry basis). Percent total <b>fat</b> was 10. 4 and 12. 2 (wet basis). Abdominal <b>fat</b> regressed on live body weight produced negative intercepts, indicating that regressed rather than percent values should be used. <b>Fat</b> from the four locations mentioned above had correlation coefficients of +. 45 to +. 76 for males and +. 47 to +. 74 for females. Percent abdominal <b>fat</b> had low nonsignificant correlations with <b>fat</b> free live body weight (r = +. 23 male,-. 07 female). Abdominal <b>fat</b> weight was a better (higher r 2) predictor of total <b>fat,</b> total <b>fat</b> minus abdominal <b>fat,</b> percent carcass <b>fat,</b> and percent intestinal <b>fat,</b> than percent backskin <b>fat.</b> Thirty-three percent (male) and 22 % (female) of the variation of percent abdominal <b>fat</b> was accounted for by percent backskin <b>fat.</b> Abdominal <b>fat</b> should be obtained directly and used for predicting <b>fat</b> in the bird rather than backskin <b>fat.</b> Abdominal <b>fat</b> was + 20. 7 % (male) and + 22. 8 % (female) of total <b>fat.</b> Prediction equations for estimating total <b>fat</b> and <b>fat</b> free live weight, given abdominal <b>fat,</b> and live body weight were developed.

40|$|Miraglio ABSTRACT In recent years, new and {{redesigned}} ingredients {{have been}} introduced as <b>fat</b> substitutes and replacers. A <b>fat</b> replacer is an ingredient that replaces {{some or all of}} the functions of <b>fat</b> and may or may not provide nutritional value. A <b>fat</b> substitute is an ingredient that replaces all the functions of <b>fat</b> without any energy contribution. Currently available <b>fat</b> replacers are <b>fat</b> mimics (also called mimetics) on <b>fat</b> analogs. <b>Fat</b> mimics are based on carbo-hydrate. protein, and/or <b>fat</b> and have energy values from 0 to 38 kJ/g (() - 9 kcal/g). <b>Fat</b> analogs have the characteristics of <b>fat</b> but have less energy. Because no one ingredient replaces all the functions of <b>fat,</b> most reduced-fat foods are formulated with a combination of ingredients and processes that affect both <b>fat</b> and energy content. Each formula must be evaluated for its total energy value: additionally, once acceptability and long-term use patterns of these reformulated products are established, their effect on energy intake must also be evaluated.

60|$|It {{scarcely}} need be {{remarked that}} {{the high price of}} butchers' meat at present, and its low price formerly, were not caused by the scarcity in the one case or the plenty in the other, but by the different expense sustained at the different periods, in preparing cattle for the market. It is, however, possible, that there might have been more cattle a hundred years ago in the country than at present; but no doubt can be entertained, that there is much more meat of a superior quality brought to market at present than ever there was. When the price of butchers' meat was very low, cattle were reared chiefly upon waste lands; and except for some of the principal markets, were probably killed with but little other <b>fatting.</b> The veal that is sold so cheap in some distant counties at present bears little other resemblance than the name, to that which is bought in London. Formerly, the price of butchers, meat would not pay for rearing, and scarcely for feeding, cattle on land that would answer in tillage; but the present price will not only pay for <b>fatting</b> cattle on the very best land, but will even allow of the rearing many, on land that would bear good crops of corn. The same number of cattle, or even the same weight of cattle at the different periods when killed, will have consumed (if I may be allowed the expression) very different quantities of human substance. A fatted beast may in some respects be considered, {{in the language of the}} French economists, as an unproductive labourer: he has added nothing to the value of the raw produce that he has consumed. The present system of grating, undoubtedly tends more than the former system to diminish the quantity of human subsistence in the country, in proportion to the general fertility of the land.|$|E
60|$|How delicious {{was that}} English morning after their voyage; the slant {{rays of the}} sun {{silvering}} the turf, and casting rainbows across the gossamer threads from one brown bent to another; the harvest fields on the slopes dotted with rich sheaves of wheat; the coppices, in their summer glory, here and there touched with the gold of early autumn, and the slopes and meadows bright with lively green, a pleasant change for eyes fresh from the bare, rugged mountain-side and the rank unwholesome vegetation of Panama. Shaggy little Scottish oxen were feeding on the dewy grass, their black coats looking sleek in the sun beyond the long shadows of the thorns; but as Mary said, laughing, 'Only Farmer Fitzjocelyn's cattle came here now,' and she stopped more than once to be introduced to some notable animal, or to hear the history of experiments in <b>fatting</b> beasts.|$|E
60|$|Of his co-mates on {{the throne}} the elder in rank was a west country baronet, who, not content with <b>fatting</b> beeves and brewing beer like his sires, aspired to do {{something}} for his country.

He was, perhaps, rather too much inclined to think that he could see further through a millstone than another, and had a way of looking as though he were always making the attempt. He was a man born to grace, if not his country, at any rate his county; and his conduct was uniformly such as to afford the liveliest satisfaction to his uncles, aunts, and relations in general.

40|$|Trans <b>fat</b> is {{the common}} name for {{unsaturated}} <b>fat</b> with trans-isomer (E-isomer) fatty acid(s). Because the term refers to the configuration of a double carbon-carbon bond, trans <b>fats</b> are sometimes monounsaturated or polyunsaturated, but never saturated. While some trans <b>fat</b> occurs naturally, {{most of it is}} artificial. It is found in partially hydrogenated vegetable oil. Foods that contain artificial trans <b>fat</b> include margarines, shortenings, and fry oils, as well as many baked good, mixes, and packaged foods. <b>Fat</b> should not be completely eliminated from anyoneâs diet {{but it is important to}} understand the difference between good <b>fats</b> and unhealthy <b>fats.</b> Unsaturated <b>fats</b> come from plants, nuts and seeds and are âgood â <b>fats,</b> such as olive, canola, peanut and corn oil. The unsaturated <b>fats</b> are classified into monounsaturated and polyunsaturated. Unhealthy <b>fats</b> include the trans fatty acids (trans <b>fat)</b> and saturated <b>fats.</b> Artificial trans <b>fat</b> results from partial hydrogenation of plant oils. It raises bad cholesterol (LDL cholesterol) as do saturated <b>fats</b> and dietary cholesterol and decreases good cholesterol (HDL). This results in an increased risk of coronary heart disease. Trans <b>fat</b> is the most dangerous type of dietary <b>fat.</b> It increases bad (LDL) cholesterol and lowers good (HDL) cholesterol...|$|R

60|$|We {{are told}} that {{in some parts of}} England, {{especially}} in the counties of Essex, Hertford, Cambridge, Bedford, Bucks, Oxford, Northampton, Lincoln, and Nottingham, it is very frequent to have the lands produce from seven to ten quarters of barley upon an acre, which is a produce not heard of in the most fruitful of all those we call corn countries abroad, much less in France. On the contrary, if they have a great produce of corn, it is because they have a vast extent of land for it to grow upon, and which land they either have no other use for, or it may be is fit for no other use; whereas our corn grounds are far from being the richest or the best of our lands, the prime of our land being laid up, as the ploughmen call it, to feed upon, that is, to keep dairies of cows, as in Essex, Suffolk, and the fens; or for grazing grounds, for <b>fatting</b> the large mutton and beef, for which England is so particularly famed. These grazing countries are chiefly in Sussex, and in the marshes of Romney, and other parts in Kent; also in the rich vales of Aylesbury, and others in Bucks and Berkshire, the isle of Ely, the bank of Trent, the counties of Lincoln, Leicester and Stafford, Warwick and Chester, as also in the county of Somerset, Lancaster, north riding of Yorkshire, and bank of Tees, in the bishoprick of Durham.|$|E

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to evaluate total and individual meat yield of boneless cuts, retail cuts, descarded trimmings and carcass bones of 38 Braford castrated steers, slaughtered at 22 months of age after feedlot finishing.

Shrinkage losses decreased as <b>fat</b> coverage increased, and it was 2. 57, 2. 22, and 1. 96 %, respectively, for insufficient, uneven, and even <b>fat</b> coverage whereas flank yield increased, reaching values of 13. 04, 13. 47 and 14. 36 %. Boneless yield was the highest in carcasses with insufficient <b>fat</b> coverage (78. 70 %) when compared to even <b>fat</b> coverage (77. 62 %), which is a result of the lowest trimming percentage, which increased according to coverage <b>fat</b> (4. 40; 5. 14 and 6. 01 %, respectively for carcass with insufficient <b>fat</b> coverage, uneven <b>fat</b> coverage and even <b>fat</b> coverage).

40|$|These {{results suggest}} how muscle, {{subcutaneous}} <b>fat</b> and intramuscular <b>fat</b> are deposited from weaning to yearling. How might these results be explained? Tissue maturity âmuscle matures earlier than <b>fat</b> {{in the growth}} process and has nutrient priority over <b>fat</b> when muscle is making maximum growth. Cattle normally make maximum growth, rate/day, when muscle is being deposited at the maximum rate. Why? Muscle has a much higher water content than <b>fat,</b> therefore, it requires less nutrients to deposit a pound of muscle then a pound of <b>fat.</b> 10 - 1 Conceptâduring the fattening process, 10 pounds of waste <b>fat</b> (subcutaneous, seam and internal <b>fat)</b> is deposited for each pound of taste <b>fat,</b> (intramuscular <b>fat).</b> This concept may partially explain why waste <b>fat</b> reaches maximum deposition after most of the muscle has been deposited and taste <b>fat</b> is more dependent on age than weight.

60|$|It may be {{that the}} {{extermination}} was not altogether undeserved; that they were not sufficiently educated or skilful to carry out that 'petite culture' which requires--as I have said already--not only intellect and practical education, but a hereditary and traditional experience, such as is possessed by the Belgians, the Piedmontese, and, above all, by the charming peasantry of Provence and Languedoc, the fathers (as far as Western Europe is concerned) of all our agriculture. It may be, too, that as the sugar cultivation increased, they were tempted more and more, in the old hard drinking days, by the special poison of the West Indies--new rum, to the destruction both of soul and body. Be that as it may, their extirpation helped to make inevitable the vicious system of large estates cultivated by slaves; a system which is judged by its own results; for it was ruinate before emancipation; and emancipation only gave the coup de grace. The 'Latifundia perdidere' the Antilles, as they did Italy of old. The vicious system brought its own Nemesis. The ruin of the West Indies {{at the end of the}} great French war was principally owing to that exclusive cultivation of the cane, which forced the planter to depend on a single article of produce, and left him embarrassed every time prices fell suddenly, or the canes failed from drought or hurricane. We all know what would be thought of an European farmer who thus staked his capital on one venture. 'He is a bad farmer,' says the proverb, 'who does not stand on four legs, and, if he can, on five.' If his wheat fails, he has his barley--if his barley, he has his sheep--if his sheep, he has his <b>fatting</b> oxen. The Provencal, the model farmer, can retreat on his almonds if his mulberries fail; on his olives, if his vines fail; on his maize, if his wheat fails. The West Indian might have had--the Cuban has--his tobacco; his indigo too; his coffee, or--as in Trinidad--his cacao and his arrowroot; and half a dozen crops more: indeed, had his intellect--and he had intellect in plenty--been diverted from the fatal fixed idea of making money as fast as possible by sugar, he might have ere now discovered in America, or imported from the East, plants for cultivation far more valuable than that Bread-fruit tree, of which such high hopes were once entertained, as a food for the Negro. As it was, his very green crops were neglected, till, in some islands at least, he could not feed his cattle and mules with certainty; while the sugar-cane, to which everything else had been sacrificed, proved sometimes, indeed, a valuable servant: but too often a tyrannous and capricious master.|$|E

I should be very glad those persons would come and make one trial and then I think they would be satisfied. It is my opinion that there never was an army of so large number that was more faithful and true to their country than this is. There is some cowards no doubt. If it had not been so at the battle in Charlestown there is no doubt but we should have gained a complete victory but old Gorist and Calender were afraid to show their heads. It is said some of our cowards have been confined to their tents ever since. I would have you send me a letter by the first opportunity to inform how you do. You may depend I shall come home as soon as I can with honor and to leave the Regiment in safety. My Lieut. Colo. Gilman is very sick at this time and my duty is harder than common.|$|E
40|$|The {{amount and}} {{distribution}} of adipose tissue is important to cattle production. <b>Fat</b> influences the animalâs reproductive efficiency and determines its carcass value. As a cowâs reproductive efficiency {{is associated with a}} level of overall fatness, not just a particular <b>fat</b> depot, being able to re-partition <b>fat</b> to a more valuable depot while reducing <b>fat</b> in less valuable depots would be advantageous. Most previous research involving <b>fat</b> deposition in cattle focussed on subcutaneous and intramuscular <b>fat,</b> and usually evaluated these in relation to total <b>fat</b> or carcass weight rather than the relationship between individual <b>fat</b> depots. The hypothesis that there is a genetic basis for variation in <b>fat</b> distribution in cattle and a weak relationship between <b>fat</b> depots independent of anatomical site was tested. The principal aim of this research was {{to gain a better understanding}} of the mechanisms controlling <b>fat</b> deposition in cattle, including any relationship between <b>fat</b> depots. Marbling features (e. g. shape and orientation) and seam (intermuscular) <b>fat</b> area were quantified using image analysis. The seam <b>fat</b> area and other carcass <b>fat</b> measurements were used to examine the relationship between <b>fat</b> depots. Candidate genes for <b>fat</b> deposition traits were identified and sequenced in Jersey â Limousin mapping sires to find single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs). In all, 33 SNPs from 11 candidate genes for <b>fat</b> deposition were selected for association studies in the sire progeny. There was large variation in all of the measures but the variation was largely independent of other marbling factors. The seam <b>fat</b> area data were used to identify a quantitative trait locus on chromosome 19, and subsequently identify candidate genes for seam <b>fat</b> area. In general, there were low correlations between <b>fat</b> traits suggesting the relationship between the depots was not strong. The fixed effects of cohort, breed and myostatin variant affected general <b>fat</b> deposition. However, sire affected <b>fat</b> distribution, as no sire had progeny consistently higher or lower for all <b>fat</b> traits. These results suggest there is only a weak genetic link between the <b>fat</b> depots. The size of effect was small for most of the SNPs associated with <b>fat</b> deposition, although there were some candidate genes with sizeable effects, for example, tyrosine kinase, endothelial (TEK 1) (channel <b>fat,</b> 28 %) and Ã, Ã-carotene 15, 15 '-monooxygenase (BCMO 1) (subcutaneous <b>fat,</b> 20 %). Moreover, the combined effect of all SNPs affecting a single trait explained 38 % (channel <b>fat),</b> 26 % (seam <b>fat</b> and subcutaneous <b>fat)</b> and 23 % (omental <b>fat)</b> of the phenotypic variation. Interestingly, although some genes were associated with variation in more than one <b>fat</b> trait, no one gene was associated with all <b>fat</b> traits or overall fatness. The major conclusion from the research described herein is that there is genetic influence on <b>fat</b> deposition in addition to the effects of age, breed and management, the deposition of <b>fat</b> into the various adipose sites is controlled in an independent manner genetically and there appears to be no one gene that affects deposition in all sites. There were four principal results that support this conclusion; 1) there were low correlations between <b>fat</b> traits, 2) there were no sires with progeny consistently high or low for all <b>fat</b> traits, 3) the QTL for the various <b>fat</b> depots did not overlap with each other, and 4) no SNP was associated with all <b>fat</b> traits. These results indicate that there is large scope for selecting for and against individual <b>fat</b> traits without altering other <b>fat</b> depots. Thesis (Ph. D.)
