5|$|By tradition, {{the winner}} of the {{previous}} year's Masters Tournament puts the <b>jacket</b> <b>on</b> the current winner {{at the end of the}} tournament. In 1966, Jack Nicklaus became the first player to win in consecutive years and he donned the jacket himself. When Nick Faldo (in 1990) and Tiger Woods (in 2002) repeated as champions, the chairman of Augusta National put the <b>jacket</b> <b>on</b> them.|$|E

Several children remain trapped in the blaze, and Krishna gets faced with the dilemma of saving the children without revealing his abilities. He dons a broken black mask and puts his <b>jacket</b> <b>on</b> inside-out, creating the persona of Krrish. Later, when Kristian Li sees Krrish fighting some goons and removing his mask, he discovers his friend Krishna as Krrish. As Krrish is being offered a reward for his deeds, Krishna asks Kristian to assume the identity, so that he can pay for his sister's surgery.|$|E
5|$|The current {{color scheme}} was {{selected}} in 1974 by then athletic director and former head coach Bobby Dodd. The original Wreck decor featured a wooden GT shield {{on both the}} driver and passenger-side doors. This shield was removed during Dodd's revitalization of the old Model A. Dodd chose an old gold paint from a Lincoln car paint catalogue as the base for the new color scheme. He also placed a slightly stretched GT emblem on the door, a Tech helmet on the rear quarter panel, and a 1952 version of the Yellow <b>Jacket</b> <b>on</b> the front quarter panel. According to Tech lore, Bobby Dodd was so enamored with the Lincoln gold that he changed the football helmet and uniform color to match the new Ramblin' Wreck paint scheme.|$|E

In this position, he completed 65 patrols in the North Sea, Norwegian waters, the Bay of Biscay and the English Channel in the first {{one and a half}} years of the war. Hartenstein took command of torpedo boat Seeadler on 20 November 1938. In October 1939 Hartenstein transferred and switched command of torpedo boat Jaguar with Kapitänleutnant Franz Kohlauf who took over command of Seeadler. On 30 March 1941, command of Jaguar was given to Kapitänleutnant Friedrich-Karl Paul and Hartenstein transferred to the U-boat force, and on 4 September 1941 was given command of U-156, a Type IXC U-boat. For his service on torpedo boats, Hartenstein was awarded the German Cross in Gold on 2 February 1942. Karl Dönitz personally pinned the award on Harteinstein's leather <b>jacket</b> <b>on</b> 17 March 1942. U-156 was first assigned to the 4th U-boat Flotilla at Stettin as a training boat, then was transferred to the 2nd U-boat Flotilla at Lorient, France, on 31 December 1941.|$|E

500|$|Liverpool {{reached the}} FA Cup Final, making its first {{appearance}} at Wembley Stadium. [...] Liddell {{had played in}} all seven matches during the club's progression, scoring critical goals against Blackpool and Everton. Demand for tickets far exceeded supply, with more than 100,000 applications being made for Liverpool's allocation of only 8,000. Liddell recalled being inundated with requests from friends, family, and Liverpudlians in general. Some 100,000 spectators witnessed Arsenal defeat Liverpool 2–0 on 29 April. Constant marking by Alex Forbes contained Liddell {{for much of the}} 90 minutes, and a tackle executed early in the game caused the winger pain. Journalist Brian Glanville questioned Arsenal's tactics and recalled being told by Liddell that he had been unable to put his <b>jacket</b> <b>on</b> the next day. Subsequent match reports by the media accused Forbes of acting with malice in his marking, which Liddell and Arsenal's Wally Barnes refuted.

500|$|The video opens, {{looking down}} on Martin who is singing, as he lies on his back on a {{mattress}}. As the camera shot pulls back, the mattress is revealed to be outside. A cyclist cycles past in reverse and Martin leaps up from the mattress. He walks in reverse through a city, out into the suburbs and eventually crossing a railway line [...] and into woods, picking up his suit jacket as he goes. Upon arriving at his car, a black BMW, he gets in and briefly passes out. A woman, at first shown lying unresponsive {{on the ground in}} front of the car, is shown flying back in through the shattered windscreen. The car rolls back up a hill in the woods and through a broken fence, which joins back together as the car passes through it. As the video closes, the couple is shown driving back up the road. It is revealed that Martin's passenger had removed her seat belt, in order to put her <b>jacket</b> <b>on,</b> just before the car accident, causing her death. Irish actress Elaine Cassidy portrays the female passenger.|$|E
500|$|Box Car Racer was {{conceived}} by Blink-182 guitarist/vocalist Tom DeLonge and formed {{during a break}} from touring. The trio's European tour {{in the winter of}} 2001 was delayed {{in the aftermath of the}} September 11 attacks, and rescheduled dates in early 2002 were also canceled due to DeLonge's back problems, the result of a herniated disc. He began taking painkillers and developed [...] "neurosis-inducing side effects." [...] DeLonge had felt [...] "bummed out" [...] and creatively stifled while recording the group's previous album, Take Off Your Pants and <b>Jacket.</b> <b>On</b> the ensuing tour, he and Blink drummer Travis Barker would jam [...] "every day," [...] and Barker introduced him to post-hardcore music. [...] DeLonge had previously been derisive of any other styles of music, but soon embraced acts like Fugazi, Quicksand, Rocket from the Crypt, and Pitchfork. He began writing heavier-sounding guitar riffs; the first riff he created became part of the song [...] "All Systems Go". Barker, in his 2015 memoir Can I Say, maintains that he asked DeLonge if they should use the riffs for a new Blink album. [...] "I honestly thought that Tom had already had a conversation with [...] about this. They were so tight—inseparable—I couldn't imagine Mark didn't know," [...] Barker writes.|$|E
500|$|The {{song was}} revived {{a decade and}} a half later with the launch of the U2 360° Tour on 30 June 2009 in Barcelona, where it was once again {{performed}} as part of the encore. It was introduced by a robotic voice reading excerpts from the poem [...] "Funeral Blues" [...] by W. H. Auden, followed by Bono's appearance wearing a laser-studded <b>jacket</b> <b>on</b> a darkened stage illuminated only by a glowing steering wheel-shaped microphone that hangs from above. During the performance, Bono would alternatively embrace or hang from the microphone, or twirl around it, or swing it overhead to emphasize the lyrics. The New York Times said its use as [...] "a love song that can double as devotional" [...] helped keep the show's music and messages in balance, while the Chicago Tribune said that Bono sang the song with fervor as part of an encore during which [...] "the show's outsized ambitions produced a neon-lighted moment that nearly justified the costly enterprise." [...] Rolling Stone called the song's performance [...] "one of the show's highpoints." [...] "Ultraviolet" [...] continued to be performed during the encore throughout the first two legs of the tour, with minor changes such as the use of a different introduction.|$|E

500|$|On September 4, 1995, Simms' jersey was {{retired in}} a halftime {{ceremony}} {{of a game}} versus the Dallas Cowboys. During an emotional speech, Simms stated {{that he wanted to}} don his jersey one final time, and throw [...] "one more pass" [...] to teammate Lawrence Taylor. Simms later commented, [...] "ll of a sudden it kind of hit me, I've put Lawrence in a really tough spot; national TV, he's got dress shoes and a sports <b>jacket</b> <b>on,</b> and he's had a few beers and he's going to run down the field and I'm going to throw him a pass." [...] Simms then motioned for Taylor to run a longer pattern, and after 30–40yards, threw him the pass. Taylor later stated that the situation made him more nervous than any play of his career, [...] "I'm saying to myself (as the pass is being thrown), 'If I drop this pass, I got to run my black ass all the way to Upper Saddle River because there ain't no way I'm {{going to be able to}} stay in that stadium'."

The video premiered on Vimeo on September 27, 2012. It begins with Brown walking through the desert, while intercut scenes of himself sitting in front of a couch (with his girlfriend, played by Runa Lucienne, sleeping behind him) are shown. As the chorus begins for the first time, Brown is seen catching a ride from an army truck. He eventually arrives at an army base to prepare for a [...] "suicide mission", which involves him riding a spacecraft into outer space to save the world from an alien ship invading Earth. A news reporter at the base (Brown's girlfriend) runs to him with the question, [...] "People are saying this is a suicide mission, why are you doing this?" [...] Brown replies, [...] "I'm doing a service for my country and my planet. If that means saving the people I love and I care about, then that's what I'll do." [...] As the spacecraft takes off, tears run down Brown's face before the spacecraft crashes into the alien ship, killing him. Brown and his girlfriend are then shown, hugging on the couch.|$|E
500|$|After {{his career}} ended, Taylor worked in several regular {{television}} jobs. He first {{worked as a}} football analyst for the now defunct TNT Sunday Night Football.
