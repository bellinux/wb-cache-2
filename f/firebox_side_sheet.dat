50|$|The upper crown {{sheet of}} the inner firebox is, as with most {{locomotive}} boilers, approximately flat and horizontal, so as to maintain a constant depth of water over this hottest part of the firebox. This flat surface, with steam pressure on its upper side, requires stays to support it. As {{it is not a}} constant distance from the boiler barrel, unlike the <b>firebox</b> <b>sides,</b> this staying is difficult to arrange.|$|R
50|$|While the {{locomotive}} was not disguised by a streamlined casing, {{a degree of}} air-smoothing was applied, with a conical smokebox front, a smoothly curved plate covering the area beneath the smokebox down to the buffer beam {{and out to the}} cylinders, and streamlined fairings around the stack and steam dome. The front of the cab was faired in to the boiler top and <b>firebox</b> <b>sides</b> in a smooth, streamlined curve.|$|R
50|$|The main {{difficulty}} of rod stays {{was that it}} required {{a large number of}} rod stays, each of which was placed at a different angle to its neighbour. The complexity of this rod staying was what drove Alfred Belpaire to develop his Belpaire firebox. This used a more complicated squared-off outer firebox, which was more difficult to manufacture, but could now use simple short rod stays throughout, as for the <b>firebox</b> <b>sides.</b>|$|R
50|$|The GPCS {{relies on}} the {{gasification}} of coal on a low temperature firebed so that the gases are then fully burnt above the firebed. To achieve this, the amount of air being drawn up through the firebed is minimised, while the main sources of air required for combustion is through secondary air inlets located in the <b>firebox</b> <b>sides</b> and through the vertically sliding firedoor. The air inlets contain swirl inducers to spread the incoming air inside the firebox.|$|R
50|$|Other visible {{differences}} are larger mechanical lubricators and external {{drive from the}} valve spindle, a vacuum ejector exhaust muffler {{just in front of}} the safety valves, pipes conveying exhaust and ejector steam to the ashpan for mixing with the primary air, the secondary air inlets in the <b>firebox</b> <b>sides</b> with spark arresting plates outside them, and the snifting and bypass valves which were removed and blanked off since the modified locomotive drifted in mid-gear with steam supplied from the drifting valve.|$|R
50|$|From 1935, all 46 Class 12 {{locomotives}} {{were eventually}} reboilered with Watson Standard no. 2 boilers and reclassified to Class 12R. In the process, {{they were also}} equipped with Watson cabs with their distinctive slanted fronts to facilitate access to the <b>firebox</b> <b>side</b> stays, compared to the vertical fronts of the original cabs. In {{the case of the}} NBL-built locomotives, the reboilered engines were also fitted with running boards which continued straight through underneath their cabs. The new boilers raised the engine's boiler pitch by 1+1/4 in.|$|R
50|$|Eventually all thirty Class 16C {{locomotives}} were reboilered with Watson Standard no. 2B boilers and reclassified to Class 16CR. Several alterations to {{the engine}} frames were necessary to accommodate the no. 2B boiler. Bearing brackets had to be provided on the bridle casting to suit the firebox support sliding shoes fitted {{at the front of}} the firebox foundation ring. The frame had to be altered to suit the new wider Watson cab with its slanted front to allow access to the lagging which covered the flexible stays and stay caps on the <b>firebox</b> <b>sides.</b>|$|R
50|$|A gas {{producer}} combustion system (GPCS) and dual Lempor exhaust were installed, {{along with some}} other small improvements. The Lempor had a four-jet blastpipe with extended petticoats to provide truer ejector proportions. To accommodate the arrangement, the smokebox was extended by 300 mm. Steam flow in the cylinders was improved by streamlining {{the edges of the}} piston valves which were each equipped with an additional valve ring to reduce leakage. The firebox was modified to the GPCS system wherein principal combustion is effected using secondary air introduced above the firebed through ducts in the <b>firebox</b> <b>sides,</b> while primary air was restricted through dampers and a redesigned grate.|$|R
5000|$|The early boiler fireboxes had flat {{parallel}} sides (see figure 1). As locomotives grew {{in power}} their boilers expanded in diameter, but {{the width of}} the firebox grate was still constrained by the need to fit between the locomotive frames, which were themselves constrained by the gauge between the wheels. This {{led to the development of}} the [...] "waisted" [...] form (see figure 2), where a narrow firebox flared upwards and outwards to meet the boiler barrel. Staying of these <b>firebox</b> <b>side</b> walls could still use simple short rod stays, although these were progressively tilted in the middle of the firebox, so as to remain perpendicular to the sheets.|$|R
2500|$|During BNCR ownership, {{the colour}} {{of the engine}} is {{believed}} to have been a dark laurel green lined out in vermilion/light blue/chrome yellow with the initials [...] "BNCR" [...] painted on the cab <b>side</b> <b>sheets</b> ...|$|R
5|$|The {{original}} design of tender, {{which came to}} be known as Type 'A' was designed for the first ten streamlined locomotives. These were of welded tank construction and included <b>side</b> <b>sheets</b> extending from the rear of the tender, which had the effect of reducing drag from eddies between the tender and the leading coach. 28 of these were constructed to be coupled with all the 24 streamliners (Nos. 6220–6229 and Nos. 6235–6248) as well as four of the unstreamlined locomotives (Nos. 6249–6252). In practice, it would seem that the <b>side</b> <b>sheets</b> made it more difficult to access the water filler as well as the couplings.|$|R
50|$|Twenty-two {{members of}} the new class were ordered at first. Wagons 1-8 were {{delivered}} as class ALF, but later wagons were fitted with bogie exchange equipment from new. The older wagons were refitted and recoded between 1963-1965. These wagons were all fitted with <b>side</b> <b>sheets.</b>|$|R
50|$|Clark {{returned}} to consultancy, and patented a device for preventing smoke from being emitted when coal was burned in locomotive fireboxes. The primary {{feature of this}} device {{was a series of}} air inlets in the <b>firebox</b> <b>sides,</b> air being forced in by steam jets when the regulator was closed. It was invented in 1857, tried out by the North London Railway and the Eastern Counties Railway, and following further trials in 1858 by Clark's former employer, the GNoSR, was adopted in 1859 as a standard fitting by the latter railway. It was used on all GNoSR locomotives built during the terms of office of Clark's successors Ruthven (1855-1857) and William Cowan (1857-1883), and was still being fitted to new engines as late as 1890 by Cowan's successor James Manson, although in modified form.|$|R
5000|$|Like most PRR steam locomotives, the M1 and M1a {{featured}} the square-shouldered Belpaire firebox. The square-topped section continued {{ahead of the}} firebox proper, revealing {{the presence of a}} combustion chamber - an extended firebox, giving more room for complete combustion of burning gases. The standard M1/M1a boiler used a working pressure of [...] 38 locomotives were later converted into class M1b; the differences were all in the boiler, those being the addition of firebox circulators - large tubes carrying water passing through the firebox space, increasing water circulation and heating area, and thus steam generation - and an increase in boiler pressure to [...] The only externally visible difference was extra cleaning plugs in the <b>firebox</b> <b>sides,</b> for washing out the circulators. The M1b had greater tractive effort, thanks to the greater pressure, and more power at speed.|$|R

50|$|The Class 26, {{popularly known}} as the Red Devil, was rebuilt from Henschel-built Class 25NC no. 3450 by {{mechanical}} engineer David Wardale. The rebuilding {{took place at the}} Salt River shops of the SAR in Cape Town and was based on the principles developed by Argentinian mechanical engineer Livio Dante Porta. The primary objectives of the modifications were to improve the combustion and steaming rate to reduce the emission of wasteful black smoke and to overcome the problem of clinkering. This was achieved by the use of a Gas Producer Combustion System (GPCS), which relies on the gasification of coal on a low temperature firebed so that the gases are then fully burnt above the firebed. The GPCS minimises the amount of air being drawn up through the firebed, the main source of air required for combustion being through ancillary air intakes located on the <b>firebox</b> <b>sides</b> above the firebed.|$|R
