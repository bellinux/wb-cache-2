5000|$|A tenant's duty to {{pay rent}} was {{traditionally}} {{thought of as}} an independent covenant, meaning that the tenant was required to pay rent {{regardless of whether the}} landlord fulfilled their duties of performance. [...] Now the duty of a tenant to pay rent {{is considered to be a}} <b>dependent</b> <b>covenant,</b> and the tenant can be freed from the duty to pay rent if the landlord breaches the covenant of repair or warranty of habitability.|$|E
40|$|This Note {{demonstrates}} that the Washington Supreme Court correctly applied contract principles to the Hindquarter lease dispute. The Note first reviews {{the historical development of}} <b>dependent</b> <b>covenants</b> in both residential and commercial contexts. After setting out this important background information, the Note examines Hindquarter and the three factors that influenced the Washington Supreme Court in following the <b>dependent</b> <b>covenants</b> trend: (1) material inducements to execute the lease; (2) the intent of the parties; and (3) equity and policy considerations. The Note concludes that, even though the landlord prevailed in Hindquarter, commercial tenants stand to gain most from the supreme court 2 ̆ 7 s decision...|$|R
5000|$|Leases include <b>dependent</b> <b>covenants</b> - if the {{landlord}} fails {{to perform their}} duties, the tenant will be relieved of paying rent. The breach of these covenants {{can be used as}} an affirmative defense by the tenant in an action for unpaid rent or eviction. These covenants include the warrant of habitability (keeping the premises habitable) and the covenant to repair (requiring {{the landlord}} to repair damage to the premises). [...] In American law, the warrant of habitability was established by the D.C. Circuit case Javins v. First National Realty Corp.|$|R
50|$|Covenant spent 1999 touring, {{changing}} record labels, and on {{the preparation}} of another album. Off-Beat Records went out of business, and Dependent was created by former Off Beat employees. Together with a few selected former Off-Beat acts, <b>Covenant</b> joined <b>Dependent.</b> In addition, <b>Covenant</b> were signed with SubSpace Communications in Sweden, effectively ending their tenure with Memento Materia. Meanwhile, 21st Circuitry Records ceased operations, leading the three {{to find a new}} home in America with Metropolis Records (Metropolis had bought the rights to the 21st Circuitry back catalogue). Shortly thereafter, the band's first three albums and the Theremin EP were re-issued in the US under the Metropolis label.|$|R
50|$|Through {{his attempt}} of {{returning}} to the text to allow Paul to speak for himself as he suggests, Wright offers a definition of what he believes the apostle means by ‘justification,’ which is contrary to popular belief. In crafting said definition, the interpreter identifies three pieces, which he believes to be vital to this consideration: that justification is <b>dependent</b> upon <b>covenant</b> language, that it utilises law-court language, functioning within the covenantal setting as a strong explanatory metaphor of justification, and that it cannot be understood within a Pauline context as separate from eschatology. Through the inclusion of covenant language, justification alludes {{to the presence of}} sin and wickedness {{in the world and the}} way in which the covenant was instituted to bring about salvation. Within this context, the law-court metaphorical language acknowledges God’s role as judge who is to put the world to rights, to deal with evil and to restore justice and order to the cosmos. Finally, Wright’s definition of ‘justification’ within Paul’s letters acknowledges that the term is not associated, as has commonly been perceived, with one’s personal needs necessary to attain salvation, but instead with what marked someone as a member of God’s people.|$|R
