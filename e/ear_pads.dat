Unlike TV Ears, transmitters for wireless headphone systems are typically capable of projecting audio waves to several different headsets at one time. Wireless systems {{are good for}} up to 20 meters and for advanced music and in-home movie-watching experiences. Leather <b>ear</b> <b>pads</b> make listening comfortable and keep excess sound from escaping and disrupting surrounding viewers.|$|E
5000|$|Working {{out of two}} nearby {{locations}} in the early 1970s - one housing Koss TV-Rental, which also did electronics and musical instrument repairs - and their main facility two blocks to the east - Koss pioneered the high-end [...] "electro-static" [...] "ES series" [...] headphone market. These headphones {{set the standard for}} wide-range frequency response. Being very durable, they required service for wear and tear on cords and <b>ear</b> <b>pads</b> - and K&M Electronics (Klenworth & Midwest based in Minneapolis), working out of the TV Rental location, supported the repair efforts, mainly of headphones that came in by the case from those customer locations. Koss headphones were easy and cost-effective to repair. At this site, in a separate garage setup, the musical instrument and electronics repair was done. The TV-rental and repair site was managed by John's brother Pete Koss. Eventually Koss dominated the headphone market, competing mainly with Telex. Koss however was considered a higher quality unit at the time, offering a wide line of models. Growth in the late 1970s caused them to move to their present location {{on the north side of}} Milwaukee.|$|E
30|$|ThinkGear is the {{technology}} which {{is embedded in}} every NeuroSky product. It enables connectivity with brainwaves of the wearer. It comprises of a sensor that touches the forehead to collect brain wave data centered at the frontal cortex, the contact and the reference points located on the <b>ear</b> <b>pad.</b> The data is processed using the onboard chip included on it. Both the eSense Meters (Meditation and Attention) and raw brainwaves are calculated on the ThinkGear Chip.|$|R

50|$|Females are {{medium-sized}} and elegant; however, males {{can be much}} larger. They have muscular bodies though {{females are}} slightly smaller. Their legs are long with perfectly oval paws. They have large ears. The tail has medium length with tapering toward the tip. The head appears to be round, but it is slightly longer than broad with well-defined whisker <b>pads.</b> <b>Ears</b> are large and well set. Their eyes are oval and match the coat color. The fur is short and has no undercoat, besides it lying close to the body. The coat should not be silky. The colors can be different but the most recognized are red, white, black, red and white,black and white, brown and brown tabby.|$|R
40|$|AIM : Kabuki make-up Syndrome is {{so named}} because of the {{characteristic}} facies of the affected patient. The face {{is similar to a}} Kabuki actor's mask. The main aim of this report was to describe the oral features in Kabuki Syndrome, focusing on the tooth anomalies. PATIENTS AND METHODS : Five subjects with Kabuki Syndrome, identified by the Child Neuropsychiatric Clinic of the University of Sassari, Italy, were enrolled. Their medical records were reviewed and oral and dental examinations were completed. The diagnosis was based upon the typical pattern of malformations and dysmorphic features reviewed by Matsumoto and Niikawa. RESULTS : All patients showed typical characteristics of the Syndrome such as a long palpebral fissure, lower palpebral eversion, arched eyebrows, short nasal septum, prominent and large <b>ears,</b> fingertip <b>pads,</b> mental retardation, and paramedian elevation of the lower lip. CONCLUSION : Kabuki make-up Syndrome is of unknown origin but a genetic aetiopathogenesis has been proposed. It is extremely rare; in Japan, where it is most frequent, it affects 1 : 32000 newborns. The typical facies of the syndrome, combined with general medical and dental examinations, are very important for diagnosis confirmation. </br...|$|R
40|$|Epidermal Langerhans cells bear surface receptors which {{implicate}} them as immunocompetent {{cells and}} they are now felt {{to play an important}} role both in delayed hypersensitivity and in skin allograft reactions. To determine the relationship between Langerhans cell availability and certain immunologic phenomena, surface densities were determined by ATP-ase and gold uptake in 3 rodent species: guinea pig, hamster, and mouse. Surface densities in epidermal specimens from the <b>ear,</b> back, foot <b>pad,</b> and buccal mucosa varied between 600 and 1500 cells/mm 2. Significantly fewer cells were found in the hamster cheek pouch (130 cells/mm 2) and in the mouse tail (110 cells/mm 2 for C 57 BL/ 6 J; 260 cells/mm 2 for BALB/c nu/nu). Langerhans cells were absent from the central portion of the cornea in all 3 species. Decreased Langerhans cell surface density may contribute to immunologic privilege as has been observed for the cornea and hamster cheek pouch and to the unusual allograft characteristics of mouse tail skin...|$|R
5000|$|The {{rules of}} play in 1893 were more like rugby than what might be {{considered}} modern football. The rules called for eleven players on a side with a scrimmage line dividing the teams. The team on offense was required to begin a play by kicking the ball either forward or backward to the quarterback. The quarterback couldn't run with the ball, but he could hand it off. In order to keep possession, the offensive team had to either gain five yards in three downs or not lose ten yards. Forward passing was not allowed. Touchdowns counted for 4 points, with 2 points for a goal after a touchdown, 4 points for a field goal, and 2 points for a safety. Players wore an assortment of [...] "football armor" [...] such as [...] "shin guards, rubber noses, head bands, ankle protectors, elbow and hip <b>pads,</b> <b>ear</b> guards, and mouth pieces. The game consisted of two 45-minute halves.|$|R
6000|$|A {{few minutes}} later he came {{suddenly}} upon Bara, the deer, asleep beneath a tree, and as Tarzan was hungry he made a quick kill, and squatting beside his prey proceeded to eat his fill. As he was gnawing the last morsel from a bone his quick <b>ears</b> caught the <b>padding</b> of stealthy feet behind him, and turning he confronted Dango, the hyena, sneaking upon him. With a growl the ape-man picked up a fallen branch and hurled it at the skulking brute. [...] "Go away, eater of carrion!" [...] he cried; but Dango was hungry and being large and powerful he only snarled and circled slowly about as though watching {{for an opportunity to}} charge. Tarzan of the Apes knew Dango even better than Dango knew himself. He knew that the brute, made savage by hunger, was mustering its courage for an attack, that it was probably accustomed to man and therefore more or less fearless of him and so he un-slung his heavy spear and laid it ready at his side while he continued his meal, all the time keeping a watchful eye upon the hyena.|$|R
50|$|After {{several years}} of observing and {{analyzing}} customers, Red Chaney concluded travelers would enjoy the convenience of making purchases without leaving their vehicles. A small window would be the easy service area. He cut out the opening {{on the west side}} of the building and the genesis of all future 'drive-through restaurants' was created. Occasionally cars would back up in a long line so Red added a mike and speaker on a pole at the side driveway; when more vehicles would arrive, the fleet-footed man would go running out the restaurant's screen door with a pencil over his <b>ear</b> and scratch <b>pad,</b> racing from car-to-car collecting orders. (Red did not want anyone to believe they were slow and he did not want to lose the business.) He would scurry back inside and deliver the orders, then quickly serve the other awaiting food orders to the tables. Behind saloon-like swinging doors, his wife - Miss Julia - was the cook in the back kitchen. The entire business was a two-person operation. Red rarely put his funds inside the cash register. Business was brisk and the orderly placement of bills was too time-consuming. The paper money would simply pile up and he would rifle through the several-inch-thick heap to get the correct change. Safety was not a worry as the place was simply too full of customers for anyone to cause trouble.|$|R
40|$|Most {{patients}} with Kabuki syndrome (KS) {{are the only}} person in their family with the condition. However, familial cases of KS have been described showing evidence that this syndrome can be inherited as a dominant trait with variable expressivity. We report on two related individuals with facial findings characteristic of KS. The proposita had arched eyebrows, long and upward slanting palpebral fissures, cleft lip and palate, retromicrognathia, brachydactyly of hands and feet, stubby fingers, nail hypoplasia, and prominent finger pads. Her mother had eyebrows with dispersed lateral half, long and upward slanting palpebral fissures, retrognathia, abnormal and posteriorly rotated <b>ears,</b> prominent finger <b>pads,</b> brachydactyly of feet, learning difficulties, and psychomotor development delay. DNA sequencing revealed a novel missense mutation in the MLL 2 gene in both the proposita and her mother. The mutation (p. R 5432 Q) was found in the exon 51, within the SET domain of the gene, which confers methyltransferase activity on the protein. Therefore, the epigenetic and transcriptional regulatory properties of this protein may be altered and this suggests that the mutation is the cause of phenotype observed in both the patient and her mother. The clinical signs and the molecular evidence in this family further support the notion that KS is an autosomal dominant condition with variable expressivity. To our knowledge this is the first report of a Brazilian family with recurrence of this syndrome. (C) 2012 Wiley Periodicals, Inc. NIH [DE 08559]NI...|$|R
40|$|A MRL strain {{bearing the}} {{autosomal}} recessive mutant gene, lpr (lymphoproliferation), spontaneously develops, {{in addition to}} a lupus-like syndrome, unique serological and pathological manifestations. Production of high titers of IgG rheumatoid factors (RF) {{may be related to the}} formation of extremely large amounts of cryoglobulins and the development of tissue lesions such as necrotizing polyarteritis, arthritis, and glomerulonephritis. To analyze more directly the relationship of IgG RF to the development of cryoglobulins and tissue injuries, we have established four monoclonal IgG RF secreting hybridomas from unimmunized MRL-lpr/lpr mice and determined their pathogenic effects in normal strains of mice. All the monoclonal IgG RF obtained in this study were of the IgG 3 subclass and generated cryoglobulins. However, the fact that not only IgG 3 Rf monoclonals but also four of five non-RF IgG 3 monoclonals were able to form cryoglobulins, which were composed exclusively of each IgG 3 monoclonal, indicates that the IgG 3 molecule has a unique physicochemical property to self-associate via nonimmunological interaction and the ability to form cryoglobulins. When the in vivo pathogenic activities of these IgG 3 RF and non-RF monoclonals were examined, three of IgG 3 RF monoclonals with the specificity to IgG 2 a were able to induce extensive pathologic manifestations including peripheral vasculitis and glomerulonephritis characteristic of patients with cryoglobulinemia. Our results indicate that the IgG 3 itself, independently of its specificity, could be a potential source of cryoglobulins and IgG 3 RF, combined with its activity of cryoglobulin formation, may play a significant role in the development of glomerulonephritis and cutaneous vascular lesions of <b>ears</b> and foot <b>pads</b> observed frequently in aged MRL-lpr/lpr mice...|$|R
