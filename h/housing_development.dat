5|$|Author Walt Morey owned {{an estate}} in Wilsonville {{and after his}} death in 1992, his widow sold the {{property}} to a developer. The <b>housing</b> <b>development</b> built on that property, Morey's Landing, bears his name as does the children's section of the Wilsonville Public Library.

5|$|Construction {{started in}} 1929 {{on a branch}} from Wembley Park to Stanmore to serve a new <b>housing</b> <b>development</b> at Canons Park, with {{stations}} at Kingsbury and Canons Park (Edgware) (renamed Canons Park in 1933). The government again guaranteed finance, this time under the Development Loans Guarantees & Grants Act, the project also quadrupling the tracks from Wembley Park to Harrow. The line was electrified with automatic colour light signals controlled from a signal box at Wembley Park and opened on 9 December 1932.|$|E
40|$|Purpose - Even as many {{countries}} are facing changes in demographic profile and {{new types of}} senior <b>housing</b> <b>developments</b> are becoming more important, there is limited evidence for the development impact of a senior house on surrounding residential property values. The {{purpose of this paper}} is to address the void in knowledge, investigating the impact of senior <b>house</b> <b>developments</b> on apartment values in Tampere, Finland. Design/methodology/approach - To specify valuation effects of proximate senior <b>house</b> <b>development</b> projects, advanced research design combining propensity score matching procedure and hedonic pricing models is used. Findings - The results show that a senior <b>house</b> <b>development</b> has a significant positive impact on proximate residential property values within a 500 metre radius. The impact is found to be the highest in underdeveloped neighbourhoods. Nevertheless, in neighbourhoods where property values and demand for housing units are higher and senior <b>house</b> <b>developments</b> fall into the criteria of infill development, a premium is lower, but still statistically significant and notable in magnitude. Research limitations/implications - This paper studies apartment values only in Tampere, Finland, and it is important to notice that local regulations and market conditions may have a notable impact on the outcomes from senior <b>house</b> <b>developments.</b> Originality/value - This study is the first of its kind to address a number of empirical issues and provide with statistically significant evidence for positive impacts from senior <b>house</b> <b>developments</b> – encouraging investors and developers to build senior houses...|$|R

5|$|Grevillea juniperina, {{commonly}} known as juniper- or juniper-leaf grevillea or prickly spider-flower, is a plant of the family Proteaceae native to eastern New South Wales and south-eastern Queensland in Australia. Scottish botanist Robert Brown described the species in 1810, and seven subspecies are recognised. One subspecies, G. j. juniperina, is restricted to Western Sydney and environs and is threatened by loss of habitat and <b>housing</b> <b>development.</b>|$|E

5|$|Plotland {{development}} {{elsewhere in}} Britain was bulldozed following the Second World War, and various {{attempts were made}} by the local council to demolish Jaywick, but there was resistance from residents, who campaigned against this and won a preservation order in 1970.

A mains sewer system was only installed in 1977.|$|E

5|$|The <b>Housing</b> <b>Development</b> Board (HDB) {{continued}} to promote public housing with new towns, such as Ang Mo Kio, being designed and built. These new residential estates have larger and higher-standard apartments and are served with better amenities. Today, 80–90% {{of the population}} lives in HDB apartments. In 1987, the first Mass Rapid Transit (MRT) line began operation, connecting most of these housing estates and the city centre.|$|E
5|$|The only {{surviving}} {{buildings of}} RAF Handforth are the government pay offices {{adjacent to the}} Total Fitness gym on Dairyhouse Lane. These buildings were the Headquarters of the depot and have survived in military/MoD use to this day. The depot had satellite sites within Cheadle Hulme, these being Site Number 5, general storage (beneath the Eden Park road <b>housing</b> <b>development</b> which, until the <b>housing</b> <b>development</b> began still maintained the internal road layout and building foundations) and site number 6 (motor transport storage area) which is now covered by part of the Hursthead housing estate. Three large (150ft × 250ft) steel built, vehicle storage sheds stood at the junction of Malmesbury Road and Lyncombe Close/Tintern Road. The last of these sheds survived well into the 1980s and was latterly used by the local council as a rubbish dump. This stood between Tollard Close and Tintern Road. The houses on May Avenue were built by the RAF as married quarters and exist to this day.|$|E
5|$|In the 14th century Ranulf Higden, a monk in Chester, {{described}} {{some of the}} Roman remains, {{including the}} sewers and tombstones. Antiquarians began to take interest in the remains in the 17th century and interest continued {{to grow in the}} 18th century, fed by accounts of Roman Chester and discoveries such as an altar to Jupiter Tanarus. Jupiter Tanarus– also Taranis– was the Romanised version of the god Taranis who was the equivalent of Jupiter the god of thunder. In 1725, William Stukeley recorded the Roman arches of the east gate; they were demolished in 1768. Over the next century, accidental discoveries continued, such as parts of the Roman bath complex outside the fortress which were destroyed by a late-18th-century <b>housing</b> <b>development.</b>|$|E

5|$|In {{the early}} 20th century, {{many of the}} large country estates in the area, with their mansions and {{associated}} grounds and outbuildings, were split up into smaller plots of land, attracting haphazard <b>housing</b> <b>development</b> and small farms. By {{the outbreak of the}} First World War in 1914 Crawley had grown into a small but prosperous town, serving a wide rural area and those passing through on the A23 London–Brighton road. Three-quarters of the population had piped water supplies, all businesses and homes had electricity, and piped gas and street lighting had been in place for 50years. An airfield was opened in 1930 on land near the racecourse. This was a private concern until the Second World War when it was claimed by the Royal Air Force.|$|E
5|$|NY185 {{begins at}} an {{intersection}} with NY9N and NY22 in Crown Point. The route progresses eastward as a two-lane highway named Bridge Road. Heading {{away from the}} western terminus, there is {{a fork in the}} road: to the left is NY185, and to the right is a road to a <b>housing</b> <b>development.</b> Most of NY185 runs along the lowlands around Lake Champlain, making curves at intersections, and heading on relatively flat elevations. As the highway approaches the lake, it makes a curve to the north. There, it intersects with County Route48 (Lake Road) and begins to follow the lake shore.|$|E
5|$|Now in {{the town}} of Junius, the route follows an {{alignment}} parallel to that of the Thruway as it passes south of a large <b>housing</b> <b>development</b> and by a series of small lakes collectively known as Junius Ponds. NY318 continues on, passing through a mixture of forested areas and cultivated fields as it heads eastward through the town. Just past an intersection with Nine Foot Road (County Route108 or CR108), NY318 serves the Waterloo Premium Outlets, a large collection of outlet stores situated between NY318 and the Thruway. Past the outlet mall, the route continues through largely rural surroundings to the community of Stone Church Corner, where it briefly curves to the northeast before veering back to the east as it enters the town of Tyre.|$|E
