Accurate quantification of farm emissions is essential to ensure compliance with regulatory requirements. The objectives {{of this study were}} to provide {{a review of the literature}} on NH 3 and H 2 S emissions from swine production facilities in North America with a meta-analysis that integrates results of independent studies, including measured emissions data from both swine houses and manure storage facilities as well as concentration data in the vicinity of swine production facilities. Results from more than 80 studies were identified through a thorough literature search, and the data were compiled together with results from the 11 swine sites in the National Air Emissions Monitoring Study (NAEMS). Data across studies were analyzed statistically using the MIXED procedures of SAS. Median <b>emissions</b> <b>rates</b> from swine houses were 2. 78 and 0. 09 kg/year per pig for NH 3 and H 2 S, respectively. Median <b>emissions</b> <b>rates</b> from swine storage facilities were 2. 08 and 0. 20 kg/year per pig for NH 3 and H 2 S, respectively. The Emergency Planning and Community Right-to-Know Act (EPCRA) require reporting of NH 3 and H 2 S emissions that exceed 100 lb/d. The size that may trigger the need for a farm to report NH 3 emissions is 3, 410 pigs based on median NH 3 <b>emissions</b> <b>rates</b> in the literature, but the threshold can be as low as 992 pigs based on 90 th-percentile <b>emissions</b> <b>rates.</b> Swine hoop houses had significantly higher NH 3 <b>emission</b> <b>rates</b> than other manure-handling systems (P < 0. 01), whereas deep pit houses had the highest H 2 S <b>emission</b> <b>rates</b> (P = 0. 03). Farrowing houses had the highest H 2 S <b>emission</b> <b>rates,</b> followed by gestation houses, and finishing houses had lowest H 2 S <b>emission</b> <b>rates</b> (P < 0. 01). Regression models for NH 3 and H 2 S <b>emission</b> <b>rates</b> were developed for finishing houses with deep pits, recharge pits, and lagoons. The NH 3 <b>emission</b> <b>rates</b> increased with increasing air temperature, but effects of air temperature on H 2 S <b>emission</b> <b>rates</b> were not significant.

In semi-insulating HgI 2, the densities and <b>emission</b> <b>rates</b> of two types of trap species are also determined by DCTS. Therefore, it is demonstrated that DCTS is a powerful method for determining the densities and <b>emission</b> <b>rates</b> of traps in semi-insulating semiconductors...|$|R
40|$|Over {{the last}} few years fast-sampling {{ultraviolet}} (UV) imaging cameras have been developed for use in measuring SO 2 emissions from industrial sources (e. g. power plants; typical <b>emission</b> <b>rates</b> ~ 1 – 10 kg s − 1) and natural sources (e. g. volcanoes; typical <b>emission</b> <b>rates</b> ~ 10 – 100 kg s − 1). Generally, measurements have been made from sources rich in SO 2 with high concentrations and <b>emission</b> <b>rates.</b> In this work, for the first time, a UV camera has been used to measure the much lower concentrations and <b>emission</b> <b>rates</b> of SO 2 (typical <b>emission</b> <b>rates</b> ~ 0. 01 – 0. 1 kg s − 1) in the plumes from moving and stationary ships. Some innovations and trade-offs have been made so that estimates of the <b>emission</b> <b>rates</b> and path concentrations can be retrieved in real time. Field experiments were conducted at Kongsfjord in Ny Ålesund, Svalbard, where SO 2 emissions from cruise ships were made, and at the port of Rotterdam, Netherlands, measuring emissions from more than 10 different container and cargo ships. In all cases SO 2 path concentrations could be estimated and <b>emission</b> <b>rates</b> determined by measuring ship plume speeds simultaneously using the camera, or by using surface wind speed data from an independent source. Accuracies were compromised in some cases {{because of the presence of}} particulates in some ship emissions and the restriction of single-filter UV imagery, a requirement for fast-sampling (> 10 Hz) from a single camera. Despite the ease of use and ability to determine SO 2 <b>emission</b> <b>rates</b> from the UV camera system, the limitation in accuracy and precision suggest that the system may only be used under rather ideal circumstances and that currently the technology needs further development to serve as a method to monitor ship emissions for regulatory purposes. A dual-camera system or a single, dual-filter camera is required in order to properly correct for the effects of particulates in ship plumes...|$|R
