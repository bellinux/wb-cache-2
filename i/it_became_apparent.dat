5|$|During Early's Raid, which {{preceded the}} Battle of Fort Stevens, troops were rushed to Fort Corcoran {{in order to}} help {{forestall}} a Confederate advance on the Arlington Line. After <b>it</b> <b>became</b> <b>apparent</b> that the forces under the command of Confederate general Jubal Early were moving further north, the additional troops at Fort Corcoran marched northward to counter them.|$|E
5|$|In the 1980s, <b>it</b> <b>became</b> <b>apparent</b> {{that four}} lanes {{at the western}} end was not enough. Several safety {{improvement}} areas were identified and projects implemented. In 1988 the Basalt Bypass relocated the highway off its original alignment through that town (currently Two Rivers Road), to a new two-lane road {{to the south of}} it that crossed the Roaring Fork to the east of the town.|$|E

5|$|It {{has been}} {{suggested}} that Concorde was not withdrawn for the reasons usually given but that <b>it</b> <b>became</b> <b>apparent</b> during the grounding of Concorde that the airlines could make more profit carrying first-class passengers subsonically. A lack of commitment to Concorde from Director of Engineering Alan MacDonald was cited as having undermined BA's resolve to continue operating Concorde.|$|E
5|$|Raising the {{suspicions of}} Prince Sturdza after <b>it</b> <b>became</b> <b>apparent</b> that he {{sided with the}} reform-minded youth of his day in {{opposition}} to the Regulamentul Organic regime, Kogălniceanu was prevented from completing his doctorate, and instead returned to Iași, where he became a princely adjutant in 1838.|$|E
5|$|There was {{danger of}} {{invasion}} {{from the more}} powerful French forces, so Adams and the Federalist congress built up the army, bringing back Washington as its commander. Washington wanted Hamilton to be his second-in-command and Adams reluctantly accommodated. <b>It</b> <b>became</b> <b>apparent</b> that Hamilton was truly in charge due to Washington's advanced years.|$|E

5|$|With the {{development}} of modern quantum mechanical theories of electron configurations within atoms, <b>it</b> <b>became</b> <b>apparent</b> that each period (row) in the table corresponded to the filling of a quantum shell of electrons. Larger atoms have more electron sub-shells, so later tables have required progressively longer periods.|$|E
5|$|With {{the twin}} {{victories}} of Plataea and Mycale, the second Persian invasion of Greece was over. Moreover, {{the threat of}} a future invasion was abated; although the Greeks remained worried that Xerxes would try again, over time <b>it</b> <b>became</b> <b>apparent</b> that the Persian desire to conquer Greece was much diminished.|$|E
5|$|After the war, <b>it</b> <b>became</b> <b>apparent</b> {{that most}} holiday camps in Britain had {{been damaged by}} troop occupation, and the {{situation}} {{was so bad that}} questions were raised in parliament. Other than Clacton, the Butlins camps were relatively unscathed, and even Clacton, which had been damaged by troop occupation, re-opened in early 1946. In the post-war boom Butlin saw opportunities on foreign shores. He opened camps at Mosney, in the soon to be Republic of Ireland, in 1948 and on Grand Bahama, in 1949.|$|E

5|$|An {{important}} theoretical {{decision for}} White {{is to choose}} whether to play a2–a3. While this move protects the b4 square and threatens the pawn advance b2–b4, it encourages Black's rook lift Ra8–a6–h6. As Lalic puts it:It was {{not so long ago}} that 8.a3, with the obvious intention of expanding with b2–b4, was the standard move. However, after Black responds with the logical a7–a5, <b>it</b> <b>became</b> <b>apparent</b> in tournament practice that the inclusion of these moves is in fact in Black's favour, as it gives his queen's rook access into play via the a6-square.|$|E
5|$|As <b>it</b> <b>became</b> <b>apparent</b> {{that the}} {{following}} NHL season would be suspended due to a lockout, Samuelsson initially signed with Genève-Servette HC of the Swiss National League A in September 2004. He appeared in 12 games for the club, recording six points. A month after signing in Switzerland, he returned to Södertälje SK of the Elitserien in late October. He recorded 20 points over 29 games as the club qualified for the eighth and final playoff spot, where they were defeated by Färjestad BK in four-straight games. Samuelsson notched six points in ten post-season games.|$|E
5|$|As <b>it</b> <b>became</b> <b>apparent</b> that, {{not only}} were {{conditions}} in the ghettos terrible (hunger, diseases, etc.), but that the Jews were being singled out for extermination at Nazi concentration camps, they increasingly tried to escape and hide {{in order to survive}} the war. Many Polish Gentiles concealed hundreds of thousands of their Jewish neighbors. Many of these efforts arose spontaneously from individual initiatives, but there were also organized networks dedicated to aiding the Jews.|$|E

5|$|By 1970 these {{differences}} {{had not been}} resolved, and Brezhnev postponed the 24th Party Congress and the Ninth Five-Year Plan (1971–1975). The delay in resolving these issues led to rumours circulating in Soviet society that Kosygin, or even Brezhnev, would lose their posts to Podgorny. By March 1971 <b>it</b> <b>became</b> <b>apparent</b> that Brezhnev {{was the leader of}} the country, with Kosygin as the spokesman of the five-year plan and Podgorny's position within the collective leadership strengthened.|$|E
5|$|Current {{taxonomy}} recognises four subspecies: M. s. splendens in Western Australia, M. s. musgravei {{in central}} Australia (subspecies previously recognised as M. s. callainus), M. s. melanotus in inland eastern Australia and M. s. emmottorum in southwestern Queensland. Initially, {{the three were}} considered separate species as they were described far from their borders with other subspecies. However, as the interior of Australia was explored, <b>it</b> <b>became</b> <b>apparent</b> there were areas of hybridisation where subspecies overlapped. Thus in 1975, the first three forms below were reclassified as subspecies of Malurus splendens.|$|E
5|$|During {{the initial}} pilot {{conversion}} course, <b>it</b> <b>became</b> <b>apparent</b> that the AV-8B exhibited flight characteristics {{different from the}} AV-8A. These differences, {{as well as the}} digital cockpit fitted instead of the analog cockpit of the TAV-8A, necessitated additional pilot training. In 1984, funding for eight AV-8Bs was diverted {{to the development of a}} two-seat TAV-8B trainer. The first of the 28 TAV-8Bs eventually procured had its maiden flight on 21 October 1986. This aircraft was delivered to VMAT-203 on 24 July 1987; the TAV-8B was also ordered by Italy and Spain.|$|E

5|$|During {{the late}} 1970s, <b>it</b> <b>became</b> <b>apparent</b> that the {{facilities}} at Hampden were {{in need of}} renewal. As an amateur club, Queen's Park could not possibly fund the works, while Glasgow District Council withdrew funding and the UK Government decided not to fund it either. Queen's Park considered selling Hampden, but a public appeal and minor repair work kept Hampden open during the 1980s. The riot after the 1980 Scottish Cup Final prompted reforms, as alcohol was banned from football stadia in Scotland.|$|E
5|$|East–West {{tensions}} rapidly subsided {{through the}} mid-to-late 1980s, culminating {{with the final}} summit in Moscow in 1989, when Gorbachev and George H. W. Bush signed the START I arms control treaty. During the following year <b>it</b> <b>became</b> <b>apparent</b> to the Soviets that oil and gas subsidies, along {{with the cost of}} maintaining massive troops levels, represented a substantial economic drain. In addition, the security advantage of a buffer zone was recognised as irrelevant and the Soviets officially declared that they would no longer intervene in the affairs of allied states in Central and Eastern Europe.|$|E
5|$|Having {{secured the}} radar {{equipment}} and under heavy enemy fire, Major Frost {{gave the order}} for the three detachments to withdraw to the evacuation beach; <b>it</b> <b>became</b> <b>apparent,</b> however, that the beach had not been secured by the under-strength 'Nelson' detachment when a German machine gun opened fire on the airborne troops, severely wounding the company sergeant major. Frost ordered 'Rodney' and the available men of 'Nelson' to clear the defences, whilst he led the other three detachments back to the villa, which had been reoccupied by enemy troops.|$|E
