Wright describes as the [...] "alternating pair thin-line type" [...] which he calls [...] "perhaps the most sophisticated of Insular interlace types". [...] The panels are symmetrical about a vertical axis, except for the left end of the upper panel, which is different. Whereas the other ends of the pattern finish in a flat line parallel with the vertical <b>framing</b> <b>line,</b> part of a shape like an incomplete D, the top left finishes in two ellipses pointing into the corners. [...] The lines forming the interlace patterns are coloured in the dark blue/black and the bright yellow, but differently. [...] In the lower panel the yellow colours the left half of the design, but the upper panel begins at the (deviant) left in the dark colour, then switches to yellow once the pattern changes to that used {{for the rest of}} the panels. [...] It continues in yellow until the central point, then changes to the dark colour for the right hand side of the design.|$|E

[...] Within several framing lines making rectangles of similar proportions to the cover itself, a central rectangular panel is marked with pricks to make a grid of 3mm squares, 21 tall and 10 wide. [...] Lines on the grid are engraved and coloured in yellow to form two stepped [...] "crosses", or squares standing on one corner, with additional stepped elements in the four corners and halfway up the vertical sides, between the two [...] "crosses". [...] The vertical axial line down the grid and the two horizontal axes through the crosses are also coloured in the yellow pigment right {{to the edges of}} the grid. [...] The remaining lines on the grid and all the lines along the edges of the grid are coloured in the dark colour. [...] This is a simple version of the sort of design found on Insular carpet pages, as well as in Coptic manuscript decoration and textiles, and small stepped crosses decorate the main panels of the famous Sutton Hoo shoulder-clasps. [...] The alignment of the various outer framing lines with the innermost frame and the panel with the grid is noticeably imperfect, as the top <b>framing</b> <b>line</b> was extended too far to the left. [...] Traces of an uncoloured first attempt at this line can be seen on the right hand side, above the coloured line.|$|E
50|$|In 2000, Moss and Sorell were {{commissioned}} {{to create a}} world-record-sized balloon sculpture in Moi, Belgium. They designed and depicted a scene showing two soccer players kicking a ball into a goal. At the time, the sculpture was the largest non-round balloon sculpture in the world. It was constructed of more than 40,750 inflated latex balloons. The installation was built without <b>framing,</b> <b>line</b> or glue and relied only on traditional balloon twisting methods. Forty-two additional crew members and more than 640 man-hours were required to construct the sculptural piece, which stood 25 ft tall and was roughly 80 ft wide. Each of the latex soccer players stood an unprecedented 40 ft tall.|$|E

50|$|A <b>frame</b> <b>line</b> is the unused {{space that}} {{separates}} two adjacent images, or film frames, on the release print of a motion picture. They can vary in width; a 35 mm film with a 1.85:1 hard matte has a <b>frame</b> <b>line</b> approximately 8 millimeters (0.3 inches) high, whereas both a full frame negative and the anamorphic format have very narrow <b>frame</b> <b>lines,</b> with the <b>frames</b> very close together. When a film is properly projected, the <b>frame</b> <b>lines</b> {{should not be}} visible to the audience and are typically cropped out in projection with an aperture mask.|$|R
50|$|The Nikon SP has dual viewfinders {{providing}} <b>frame</b> <b>lines</b> for a {{total of}} six focal lengths. The main viewfinder has 1x magnification and has <b>frame</b> <b>lines</b> for 50 mm, 85 mm, 105 mm and 135 mm (selected by rotating a dial under the rewind crank). The frames are parallax-corrected and the focusing patch appears in the centre of the viewfinder. A separate, smaller viewfinder (less than life size) {{to the left of the}} main viewfinder has non-parallax corrected <b>frame</b> <b>lines</b> for 35 mm.

40|$|Characters often overlap form <b>frame</b> <b>lines.</b> Such character-line {{overlapping}} seriously deteriorates {{the recognition}} rate of characters. In this paper, {{a simple but}} powerful <b>frame</b> <b>line</b> removal algorithm- Line Width Thresholding Approach- is presented. Taking smaller threshold for the run-lengths within characters and larger threshold for those between characters, our approach is very robust. To cope with the situation that digits overlap with <b>frame</b> <b>lines,</b> two approaches are implemented and compared to use a priori information. One uses heuristic a-priori information, the other uses the feedback of the recognition core. The experiments on value-added tax invoices have shown the effect of our approach: the recognition rate of overlapped digit strings does not decrease...|$|R

25|$|The {{black ink}} <b>framing</b> <b>lines</b> drawn around each design {{are thought to}} have been added at a later date, {{possibly}} in 1818, just prior to Blake giving the plates to John Linnell.

It has been suggested that the <b>framing</b> <b>lines</b> may have been added due to the discrepancy between the size of the plates {{and the size of the}} paper (each sheet is 37.8 x 27cm.).|$|R

40|$|We display by {{numerical}} calculation how rest <b>frame</b> spectral <b>lines</b> {{appear in the}} observed spectrum of gamma-ray bursts due to the Doppler effect in the fireball framework. The analysis shows that: a) in the spectrum of a relativistically expanding fireball, all rest <b>frame</b> <b>lines</b> would shift to higher energy bands and would be significantly smoothed; b) rest frame weak narrow emission lines as well as narrow absorption lines and absorption line forests would be smoothed and would hardly be detectable; c) the features of rest <b>frame</b> broad emission <b>lines</b> as well as both strong and weak broad absorption lines would remain almost unchanged and therefore {{would be easier to}} detect; d) deep gaps caused by rest <b>frame</b> broad absorption <b>lines</b> would be significantly filled; e) a rest <b>frame</b> emission <b>line</b> forest would form a single broad line feature; f) the observed relative width of the rest <b>frame</b> very narrow <b>line</b> would approach 0. 162; g) when the Lorentz factor Γ is large enough, the observed line frequency ν_line and the rest <b>frame</b> <b>line</b> frequency ν_ 0,line would be related by ν_line≈ 2 Γν_ 0,line. We also investigate the effect of time dependence of the line intensity and the effect of variation of Γ. We find that the feature of rest frame dimming narrow emission lines would disappear when Γ is very large. The form of emission lines would be sharp on both edges when Γ varies with time. This phenomenon depends not only on the initial Lorentz factor but also on the observation time. Comment: 28 pages, 18 figure...|$|R
