40|$|A {{modification}} of the classical banyan switching network architecture is called the dilated slipped banyan. This architecture is recursive and switching networks of any size perform permutation switching under a simple switching rule. They also exhibit column-control and dilation, properties that are particularly relevant to guided-wave and free-space photonic technologies. A photonic switching network, with this dilated slipped banyan architecture, is proposed as the hub of an all-optical active-star <b>local-area</b> <b>network.</b> The switching assignment at this hub is time-multiplexed on a fixed schedule that is known to all the terminals. Then, this all-optical <b>local-area</b> <b>network</b> provides the equivalent of full-connectivity with high effectively simultaneous data rates between every pair of terminals.

40|$|People {{have long}} trusted central {{authorities}} to coordinate secure collaboration on <b>local-area</b> <b>networks.</b> Unfortunately, the Internet doesn't provide {{the kind of}} administrative structures individual organizations do. As such, users risk painful consequences if global, distributed systems rely on central authorities for security. Fortunately, security need not come at the price of centralized control. To prove it, we present SFS, a secure, global, decentralized file system permitting easy cross-administrative realm collaboration. With a simple idea, self-certifying pathnames, SFS lets users escape the evils of centralized control. 1 Introduction As distributed applications become increasingly prevalent, we must confront a serious danger: Future distributed infrastructures may, as a condition for security, subject their users to rigid, centralized control with stifling consequences.

40|$|Distributed {{audio and}} video {{applications}} require end-to-end performance guarantees from the underlying networks for smooth delivery of real-time media streams. The end-to-end nature dictates that real-time support be built into both wide-area and <b>local-area</b> <b>networks.</b> With the enormous growth of portable computers equipped with networking capabilities, {{it is important to}} develop real-time protocols for wireless LAN technologies, such that real-time audio/video communication services can be extended to these mobile terminals as well. This paper describes the implementation effort of supporting end-to-end performance guarantees over a heterogeneous <b>local-area</b> <b>network</b> comprising of both wired and wireless LAN segments. This work also addresses the performance guarantee issues associated with terminal mobility in the wireless segments.

40|$|The {{dissertation}} {{contributes to}} the definition, design and implementation of a group technology platform capable of operating over large-scale networks. These <b>networks</b> differ from <b>local-area</b> <b>networks</b> by their limitations in terms of high latency, low reliability and vulnerability to partitions. These characteristics motivate the design of new services offering acceptable performance over these networks. Most of today's large scale networks are built clusters of <b>local-area</b> <b>networks</b> inter-connected by long-haul point-to-point. To offer efficient group communication over this type of infra-structure, the dissertation suggests an hierarchical approach that combines protocols dedicated to <b>local-area</b> <b>networks</b> protocols dedicated to large-scale networks. In the framework, the thesis extends and improves previous results in the are of local-area group communication. additionally, new approaches for operation in large-scale are proposed, including algorithms to enforce causal and total order. Finally, to illustrate {{the use of these}} technologies, the thesis proposes a generic architecture to support remote invocation of replicated objects. The remote invocation protocol supports the used of different replication strategies for each object. It is believed that such a problem-oriented approach will be a key factor to offer the flexibility required by future distributed applicationsAvailable from Fundacao para a Ciencia e a Tecnologia, Servico de Informacao e Documentacao, Av.

40|$|Wireless <b>local-area</b> <b>networks</b> are {{becoming}} increasingly popular. This is due, in part, to the recent availability of devices capable of communicating at data rates approaching that of conventional wired networks. These high rates are made possible through new modulation and coding techniques that dramatically increase bandwidth efficiency. However, maintaining reliable communication at higher data rates requires more signal power. Consequently, wireless devices often support multiple data rates, providing the user the ability to choose the rate that best suits their application. Alternatively, an automatic rate adaption mechanism may be used. Rate adaption {{is the process of}} automatically selecting the rate that gives the optimum throughput for the channel conditions. Although rate adaption mechanisms for cellular wireless networks have been studied at length, few have been proposed for wireless <b>local-area</b> <b>networks.</b> This paper presents one such mechanism: a rate adaptive MAC protocol based [...] ...|$|R
