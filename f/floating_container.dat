40|$|When a pontoon-type, {{very large}} {{floating}} structure is heavily loaded {{in the central}} portion, it will deform with its central deflection much larger than its corner deflections. The resulting differential deflection, if large enough, may cause machines and equipment sensitive to differential deflection to cease operation or the floating structure {{to be subjected to}} additional large stresses. In this paper, we introduce the so-called gill cells which are compartments within the floating structure with holes or slits at the bottom floor to allow water to flow in and out freely.

40|$|Since 1998 the Port of Rotterdam and Delft University of Technology {{are working}} {{together}} to make the conventional container terminals capable of coping {{the demands of the}} container terminals of the future. These demands are: the increasingly larger ships service within relatively short times at competitive costs, the increasing service demands on the landside for handling the trucks, trains and barges. In 2004 both partners participated in a multidisciplinary research project entitled The Container Terminal of the Future. The main purpose of this research project was to generate new ideas to cope the demands mentioned above. From this project they concluded {{that it is possible to}} increase the berth productivity by means of a floating crane (the <b>Floating</b> <b>Container</b> Crane) working in the basin side of the ships. Moreover it is expected that this new concept will help to alleviate container terminals congestion because there is no demand for storage or internal transport in the deep-sea terminal. Furthermore, it is also expected that the total handling costs for containers to and from the hinterland can be reduced. This report concerns the logistical and economic aspects of the <b>Floating</b> <b>Container</b> Crane (FCC) in order to collaborate with both partners (the Port of Rotterdam and Delft University of Technology). So, at the end of the year 2006 a detailed analysis related to the Customs operation was carried out with the help of Customs of Rotterdam. Thanks to this analysis some logistical problems were detected in relation to the ideal FCC concept, which means a direct container transport from the deep-sea terminal to the inland terminals. These problems leaded to finding other possibilities to use the FCC, which implied an indirect transport. At the beginning of the year 2007 an economic analysis was carried out to check if the total handling costs for containers to and from the hinterland were actually reduced. This analysis only considered the possibilities of using the FCC that,for the moment, are feasible after the Customs Analysis. In the last stage of this project, the basins of the European Ports with inland waterway connections and with a significant amount of TEU were analysed knowing where the FCC has space enough to work in the basin side of the new generation container vessels.

With around 100 separate technologies researched globally in over 25 countries wave energy {{are believed to}} {{soon be able to}} compete with other renewable sources such as wind energy. One of the new technologies is WaveTube; a wave energy converter currently under development and in need of technical verification. The basic idea of WaveTube is a partially submerged container with an enclosed fresh water volume. The kinetic energy of the ocean waves are transferred onto the <b>floating</b> <b>container,</b> creating an inner flow in the structure and electricity is generated as the fresh water flows through turbines. Previous small-scale model tests have confirmed the basic idea of WaveTube and an inherent continuation is visualizing and evaluating the inner flow using Computational Fluid Dynamics.

However, this Master Thesis project shows that a simulation using ANSYS Fluent of this case is not a successful approach. With inner moving parts a so called dynamic mesh was required, which updates the mesh as the boundaries move. In order for this method to be successful the mesh needs to be of high quality. However, for the complex geometry that WaveTube is no mesh was found to meet the requirements and the calculations using the Volume of Fluid method were not able to proceed...|$|E

Ship wreckage have huge impact for ship navigation, environment, economics, and others. Those impact have many disadvantages for the shipowners, and also for environment. For examples the fuel spills that pollute the environment, make disturbance to sailing ship because the track for those navigation is blocked by the ship wreck and their cargo especially on shallow location (< 50 m).

50|$|Another {{important}} {{classification of}} dashpot timers are mercury-displacement timers. These {{depend on the}} displacement of a pool of mercury that make connection with two electrodes. There {{are two kinds of}} mercury displacement timers, delayed-make displacement timers and slow break displacement timers. Delayed-make displacement timers work by having a plunger <b>floating</b> in a <b>container</b> of mercury, when energy is applied to the coil it pulls the plunger into its center. The mercury that is displaced by this enters the thimble though an orifice. Inert gas trapped {{at the top of the}} thimble prevents the mercury from rising. Eventually the gas escapes through a ceramic plug, and this permits mercury to fill the thimble. When the mercury rises to a certain level it makes contact between electrodes. The amount of delay that this produces is determined when it is manufactured. Slow-break displacement timers work in the same way as delayed-make displacement timers only that when the coil is de-energized, the plunger rises to its original position, and mercury flows through the orifice to reach outside level. when it falls below the lip of the ceramic cup, electrical contacts become open. Its physical size is used to regulate the delay time of connection break. These timers are designed with a fixed delay period, usually to a maximum of 20 minutes.|$|R

The mechanisms of the different stages of sulfate chemistry in the batch and sulfate fining process are presented, depending on the level of addition of cokes in the batch. The fining gas release as function of temperature from batch and melt are shown for different soda-lime-silica glass forming raw material batches. In case of coke and sulfate containing batches, sulfur dioxide gas release takes place in steps and at different temperature levels. SO 2 may evolve from the batch blanket (at about 900 Â°C), but also at higher temperatures from the fresh melt starting at about 1050 Â°C up to 1250 Â°C, some SO 2 release can take place up to 1350 Â°C and then for oxidized melts a strong evolution between 1420 and 1500 Â°C. The last stage of SO 2 evolution from the melt is generally accompanied with oxygen gas formation as well. Bubble growth rates during primary fining a float glass melts from experiments and models are compared and the removal of dissolved gases from such melts will be shown. The paper shows that furnace atmosphere may have an important influence on the temperature of fining gas evolution and total fining gas production: water vapor or helium in the atmosphere will reduce fining onset temperature and may significantly increase gas evolution during primary fining...|$|R

The offshore port systems have an increasing interest depending on ever-growing container trade and vessel size. In the literature, there are some existing proposals which aim to analyse the offshore port system in terms of technical and economic evaluation aspects. Although, applied examples of the offshore systems for liquid and dry bulk cargo shipping are in practice, there is no large scale implementation for container shipping industry. An ongoing study at University of Strathclyde examining location analysis of the offshore container port system is an inspiration of this research. According to this research point of view, offshore of West Coast of the North America may {{be considered as a}} potential location to construct a fixed or <b>floating</b> offshore <b>container</b> port system. In direction of this perspective, the target of this research work is to optimise door-to-door delivery of the container cargoes between several route alternatives. In this respect, container transport network for case of West North America Coast is analysed with the aid of the linear optimisation tools. The concept of offshore container port system is settled at the centre of the transportation network alternatives integrated to intermodal connections. By utilisation of an offshore port system, {{it would be possible to}} give a better logistical response to ship size enlargement trend of the liner container shipping industry. The adaptation of the short sea shipping and the intermodal connection alternatives to the offshore container port system concept have significant influence to optimise freight transport from shipper to consignee on the determined route alternatives. The objective function of the optimisation model aims to minimise time and cost of door-to-door transport for this specific case. Operational challenges helps to determine the constraints of the linear optimisation model. The assumed constraints for the mentioned optimisation problem are ship and port drafts, docking capacity of ports, intermodal integration limits, and maximum handling capacity of port equipment. The fundamental decision variables may be considered as speed, service frequency, port handling capacity, number of handling equipment, vehicle cargo capacities, and port prices affecting to reach time and cost based minimisation. The data collection is going to established based on real container traffic statistics and future forecasts. The present study targets to determine the impact of the proposed offshore container port on West Coast of North America. Therefore, it is going to be possible to provide a more energy efficient, environmentally friendly, and time and cost efficient freight transport through West Coast of North America...|$|R
40|$|The {{overall goal}} of this project {{was to develop a}} {{high-temperature}} melt properties database with sufficient reliability to allow mathematical modeling of glass melting and forming processes for improved product quality, improved efficiency and lessened environmental impact. It was initiated by the United States glass industry through the NSF Industry/University Center for Glass Research (CGR) at Alfred University [1]. Because of their important commercial value, six different types/families of glass were studied: <b>container,</b> <b>float,</b> fiberglass (E- and wool-types), low-expansion borosilicate, and color TV panel glasses. CGR member companies supplied production-quality glass from all six families upon which we measured, as a function of temperature in the molten state, density, surface tension, viscosity, electrical resistivity, infrared transmittance (to determine high temperature radiative conductivity), non-Newtonian flow behavior, and oxygen partial pres sure. With CGR cost sharing, we also studied gas solubility and diffusivity in each of these glasses. Because knowledge of the compositional dependencies of melt viscosity and electrical resistivity are extremely important for glass melting furnace design and operation, these properties were studied more fully. Composition variations were statistically designed for all six types/families of glass. About 140 different glasses were then melted on a laboratory scale and their viscosity and electrical resistivity measured as a function of temperature. The measurements were completed in February 2003 and are reported on here. The next steps will be (1) to statistically analyze the compositional dependencies of viscosity and electrical resistivity and develop composition-property response surfaces, (2) submit all the data to CGR member companies to evaluate the usefulness in their models, and (3) publish the results in technical journals and most likely in book form...|$|R
40|$|The {{unusually high}} surface tension of room {{temperature}} liquid metal is molding it as unique material for diverse newly emerging areas. However, unlike its practices on earth, such metal fluid would display very different behaviors when working in space where gravity disappears and surface property dominates the major physics. So far, few direct evidences {{are available to}} understand such effect which would impede further exploration of liquid metal use for space. Here to preliminarily probe into this intriguing issue, a low cost experimental strategy to simulate microgravity environment on earth was proposed through adopting bridges with high enough free falling distance as the test platform. Then using digital cameras amounted along x, y, z directions on outside wall of the transparent container with liquid metal and allied solution inside, synchronous observations on the transient flow and transformational activities of liquid metal were performed. Meanwhile, an unmanned aerial vehicle was adopted to record the whole free falling dynamics of the test capsule from the far end which can help justify subsequent experimental procedures. A series of typical fundamental phenomena were thus observed as: (a) A relatively large liquid metal object would spontaneously transform from its original planar pool state into a sphere and <b>float</b> in the <b>container</b> if initiating the free falling; (b) The liquid metal changes its three-dimensional shape due to dynamic microgravity strength due to free falling and rebound of the test capsule; and (c) A quick spatial transformation of liquid metal immersed in the solution can easily be induced via external electrical fields. The mechanisms of the surface tension driven liquid metal actuation in space were interpreted. All these findings indicated that microgravity effect should be fully treated in developing future generation liquid metal space technologies. Comment: 16 pages, 9 figure...|$|R
40|$|As a {{comparative}} study, the global performance of two cases for a floating harbor system are researched by numerical analysis and compared with results from experiments: {{one is a}} two-body case such that a floating quay is placed next to a fixed quay, a normal harbor, {{and the other is}} a three-body case such that a container ship is posed {{in the middle of the}} floating quay and the fixed quay. 	The numerical modeling is built based on the experimental cases. Mooring system used in the experiments is simplified to sets of linear springs, and gaps between adjacent bodies are remarkably narrow as 1. 3 m~ 1. 6 m with reference to large scales of the floating structures; a water plane of the fixed quay is 480 m? 160 m, and the ship is 15000 TEU (twenty-foot equivalent unit) class. 	With the experiment-based models, numerical analysis is implemented on two domains: frequency domain using a three dimensional constant panel method, WAMIT, and time domain using a coupled dynamic analysis program of moored floating structures, CHARM 3 D/HARP. 	Following general processes of the two main tools, additional two calibrations are implemented if necessary: revision of external stiffness and estimation of damping coefficients. The revision of the external stiffness is conducted to match natural frequency of the simulation with that of the experiment; to find out natural frequencies RAO comparison is used. The next, estimation of damping coefficients is carried out on time domain to match the responses of the simulation with those of the experiment. 	After optimization of the numerical analysis, a set of experimental results from regular wave tests is compared with RAO on frequency domain, and results from an irregular wave test of the experiment are compared with response histories of simulation on time domain. In addition, fender forces are compared between the simulation and experiment. Based on response histories relative motions of the <b>floating</b> quay and <b>container</b> ship are compared. And the floating harbor system, the three-body case, is compared with a conventional harbor system, a fixed quay on the portside of the container ship, in terms of motions of the container ship. As an additional simulation, the three-body case is investigated on an operating sea state condition. From the present research, the experimental results are well matched with the numerical results obtained from the simulation tools optimized to the experiments. In addition, the floating harbor system show more stable motions of the container ship than the conventional harbor system, and the floating harbor system in the operating sea state condition have motions even smaller enough to operate in term of relative motions between the floating quay and the container ship...|$|R
40|$|Compared to land, {{rail and}} air, sea {{transport}} {{has proven to}} have the largest contribution to the transport of goods and is witnessing a continuous growth over the years. The existing ports are dealing with an increasing flow of goods and the transporting vessels, resulting in capacity problems. New innovations and technology are needed to encounter these problems and in a sustainable way. One of the solutions proposed is to expand towards the sea. A floating port at a certain distance from land could reduce the pressure on these ports. The objective of the thesis is to examine feasibility of an offshore <b>floating</b> terminal for <b>container</b> transshipment with an annual throughput of 1 million TEU. Different locations {{around the world with}} high potential for the container transshipment have been proposed as possible locations for the floating terminal. The first step was to design the terminal according to certain requirements. Except for accommodating a number of activities, the terminal has also the function of creating protected waters for the vessels calling on it. Different floating concepts were examined for their eligibility and finally a pontoon-shaped structure was chosen for the form of the hull of the terminal. The terminal has a rectangular- shaped layout with a length dimension of 1190 m and a width of 240 m. Berthing facilities and 11 quay cranes are provided at the lee side of the terminal for the loading and unloading operations of the containers. The heart {{of the study was to}} draw conclusions about the operability of the designed system based on the results of a hydrodynamic research. Computer models such as DELFRAC and SEAWAY were used to calculate the responses of both the terminal and vessel, in different sea conditions. According to the criteria for container vessel motions during lifting operations and the response calculations, it was concluded that the (un) loading operations of the containers could proceed safely up to sea conditions with a significant wave height of 3 m. This state represents the Serviceability Limit State (SLS) for the designed system and is of importance for determining the downtime of the terminal as result of the wind waves generated motions. Station keeping of the terminal is necessary to prevent the terminal from being drifted away by sea loads. After considering a number of alternatives to achieve this function, it is finally chosen for a combined DP thrusters- turret mooring system. The system will make it possible for the terminal to maintain a beam-on position to waves during operating conditions. This is to fulfil the function as a breakwater. During high seas, the terminal rotates till a bow-on position (heading) to waves. The last characteristic of the system will result in reduction of the sea loads on the terminal and thus also the mooring loads during aggressive sea conditions. The total construction cost of the terminal, including the necessary equipment is estimated for 448 million Euros. The terminal revenues are represented in the transshipment fee that the shipping liners must pay when using the terminal. According to the results of the financial analyses, a minimum fee of 125 Euro per TEU must be charged in order to make the terminal cost-effective. Civil Engineering and Geoscience...|$|R
