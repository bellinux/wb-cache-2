5|$|A {{possible}} way to detect an <b>eruption</b> is studying Edziza's geological history since every volcano {{has its own}} pattern of behavior, {{in terms of its}} <b>eruption</b> style, magnitude and frequency, so that its future <b>eruption</b> is expected to be similar to its previous eruptions.|$|E
5|$|A {{technique}} for altering the natural progression of <b>eruption</b> is employed by orthodontists {{who wish to}} delay or speed up the <b>eruption</b> of certain teeth for reasons of space maintenance or otherwise preventing crowding and/or spacing. If a primary tooth is extracted before its succeeding permanent tooth's root reaches ⅓ of its total growth, the <b>eruption</b> of the permanent tooth will be delayed. Conversely, if {{the roots of the}} permanent tooth are more than ⅔ complete, the <b>eruption</b> of the permanent tooth will be accelerated. Between ⅓ and ⅔, it is unknown exactly what will occur to the speed of <b>eruption.</b>|$|E
50|$|Artemisia also {{experiences}} minor <b>eruptions</b> lasting about 5 minutes. These minor <b>eruptions</b> {{are followed}} by major <b>eruptions</b> within six hours. Minor <b>eruptions</b> are rare. Years may pass between episodes of minor <b>eruptions.</b>|$|R
50|$|Historical <b>eruptions</b> {{have been}} {{reported}} since 1375 (give or take 25 years). The first two <b>eruptions</b> came from the Empung cone, both the <b>eruptions</b> were VEI 3's. <b>Eruptions</b> since 1829 have been from the Tompaluan Crater.

5|$|During {{recorded}} history, eruptions have consisted {{primarily of}} a central vent <b>eruption</b> (in the caldera) followed by an explosive <b>eruption,</b> then lahars. Ruiz's earliest identified Holocene <b>eruption</b> was about 6660BC, and further eruptions occurred in 1245BC±150years (dated through radiocarbon dating), about 850BC, 200BC±100 years, 350AD±300 years, 675AD±50 years, in 1350, 1541 (perhaps), 1570, 1595, 1623, 1805, 1826, 1828 (perhaps), 1829, 1831, 1833 (perhaps), 1845, 1916, December 1984 – March 1985, September 1985 – July 1991, and possibly in April 1994. Many of these eruptions involved a central vent <b>eruption,</b> a flank vent <b>eruption,</b> and a phreatic (steam) explosion. Ruiz is the second-most active volcano in Colombia after Galeras.|$|E
40|$|Drug-induced {{cutaneous}} <b>eruptions</b> {{are named}} {{among the most}} common side effects of many medications. Thus, cutaneous drug <b>eruptions</b> are a common cause of morbidity and mortality, especially in hospital settings. The present article reviews different presentations of drug-induced cutaneous <b>eruptions,</b> {{with a focus on}} <b>eruptions</b> reported secondary to the use of interferon and ribavirin. Presentations include injection site reactions, psoriasis, eczematous drug reactions, alopecia, sarcoidosis, lupus, fixed drug <b>eruptions,</b> pigmentary changes and lichenoid <b>eruptions.</b> Also reviewed are findings regarding life-threatening systemic drug reactions...|$|R
5000|$|Guacha {{has been}} the source of <b>eruptions</b> with volumes of more than [...] dense rock equivalents. These <b>eruptions</b> in Guacha's case have a Volcanic {{explosivity}} index of 8. The close succession of multiple large scale <b>eruptions</b> indicates that plutons feeding such <b>eruptions</b> are assembled over millions of years.|$|R
30|$|Phreatic <b>eruptions</b> are <b>eruptions</b> {{in which}} magmatic {{processes}} {{are not the}} principal driving mechanism. Rather, broadly defined hydrothermal processes (i.e., interactions among water, rocks, and magmatic heat and gas) play the key role in generating phreatic <b>eruptions.</b> On our wet planet, explosive interactions between volcanoes and meteoric water are extremely diverse. Phreatic <b>eruptions</b> encompass steam-driven explosions generated by magma intruding fluvial sediments and aquifers, lava or pyroclastic flows interacting with surface water, geyser-like explosions driven by depressurization of near boiling-point subterranean geothermal water, and volcanic <b>eruptions</b> expelling hydrothermal systems formed during periods of repose (e.g., Barberi et al. 1992; Rouwet et al. 2014). In contrast to magmatic <b>eruptions,</b> a broadly accepted classification scheme of phreatic <b>eruptions</b> is lacking.|$|R
5|$|Hazard maps {{showing that}} Armero would be {{completely}} flooded after an <b>eruption</b> were distributed {{more than a month}} before the <b>eruption,</b> but the Colombian Congress criticized the scientific and civil defense agencies for scaremongering.

5|$|On May 18, 1980, a major {{volcanic}} <b>eruption</b> {{occurred at}} Mount St. Helens, a volcano located in Skamania County, {{in the state}} of Washington, United States. The <b>eruption</b> (a VEI 5 event) was the most significant volcanic <b>eruption</b> to occur in the contiguous 48 U.S. states since the 1915 <b>eruption</b> of Lassen Peak in California. It has often been declared as the most disastrous volcanic <b>eruption</b> in United States history. The <b>eruption</b> was preceded by a two-month series of earthquakes and steam-venting episodes, caused by an injection of magma at shallow depth below the volcano that created a large bulge and a fracture system on the mountain's north slope.|$|E

30|$|Here, {{we aim to}} {{investigate}} the mechanisms of the phreatic <b>eruptions</b> of Ioto. Some phreatic <b>eruptions</b> have been accompanied by clear precursors. However, <b>eruptions</b> without precursors have also been reported. Phreatic <b>eruptions</b> and related activities such as earthquakes, deformation and fumaroles on the ground {{are considered to be}} related with hydrothermal reservoirs of shallow depths (e.g., Kaneshima et al. 1996). We will clarify the relationship between phreatic <b>eruptions</b> and hydrothermal reservoirs in Ioto with seismic and crustal deformation data. Although the scale of phreatic <b>eruptions</b> is small in Ioto, they are frequent, occurring everywhere on the island. Elucidation of the regularity and mechanisms of phreatic <b>eruptions</b> helps to reduce the risk to residents on the island.|$|R

5|$|The Minoan <b>eruption</b> of Thera, also {{referred}} to as the Thera <b>eruption</b> or Santorini <b>eruption,</b> was a major catastrophic volcanic <b>eruption</b> with a Volcanic Explosivity Index (VEI) of 6 or 7 and a dense-rock equivalent (DRE) of , Dated to the mid-second millennium BCE, the <b>eruption</b> was one of the largest volcanic events on Earth in recorded history. It devastated the island of Thera (now called Santorini), including the Minoan settlement at Akrotiri and communities and agricultural areas on nearby islands and the coast of Crete with a related earthquake and tsunami.|$|E
5|$|There {{have been}} several tellings of Johnston's story in documentaries, films and docudramas about the <b>eruption.</b> Documentaries such as The <b>Eruption</b> of Mount St. Helens! (1980) {{appeared}} the same year, while a movie was filmed in the year following the <b>eruption</b> and released {{to coincide with the}} first anniversary. The story of Mount St. Helens and Johnston continues to be told in documentaries and reconstructions several decades after the <b>eruption</b> took place.|$|E
5|$|A large {{volcanic}} <b>eruption</b> {{from any}} volcanoes in the Mount Cayley field would have major {{effects on the}} Sea-to-Sky Highway and municipalities such as Squamish, Whistler, Pemberton and probably Vancouver. Because of these concerns, the Geological Survey of Canada is planning to create hazard maps and emergency plans for Mount Cayley, as well as Mount Meager north of the volcanic field, which experienced a major volcanic <b>eruption</b> 2,350years ago similar to the 1980 <b>eruption</b> of Mount St. Helens.|$|E
50|$|This volcano has {{had many}} {{recorded}} <b>eruptions</b> during the 19th and 20th centuries, {{and a couple}} reports of volcanic activity in the area during the 18th century may have referred to Shishaldin as well. Therefore, the volcano's entire recorded history is spotted with reports of activity. AVO has 24 confirmed <b>eruptions</b> at Shishaldin, making it the volcano with the third most confirmed <b>eruptions</b> (after Akutan and Pavlof). However, Shishaldin has the most <b>eruptions</b> (this means confirmed AND possible <b>eruptions)</b> in Alaska, but half of the <b>eruptions</b> are unconfirmed, with the most recent one being from January 28 to January 2015 (ongoing).|$|R
2500|$|<b>Eruptions</b> of Etna {{follow a}} variety of patterns. Most occur at the summit, where there are [...] five {{distinct}} craters — the Northeast Crater, the Voragine, the Bocca Nuova, and the Southeast Crater Complex (2). Other <b>eruptions</b> occur on the flanks, which have more than 300 vents {{ranging in size from}} small holes in the ground to large craters hundreds of metres across. Summit <b>eruptions</b> can be highly explosive and spectacular, but rarely threaten the inhabited areas around the volcano. In contrast, flank <b>eruptions</b> can occur down to a few hundred metres altitude, close to or even well within the inhabited areas. Numerous villages and small towns lie around or on cones of past flank <b>eruptions.</b> Since the year AD1600, at least 60 flank <b>eruptions</b> and countless summit <b>eruptions</b> have occurred; nearly half of these have happened {{since the start of the}} 20th century. Since 2000, Etna has had four flank <b>eruptions</b> — in 2001, 2002–2003, 2004–2005, and 2008–2009. Summit <b>eruptions</b> occurred in 2006, 2007–2008, January–April 2012, and again in July–October 2012.|$|R
5|$|Tephra {{analysis}} has yielded evidence for many <b>eruptions</b> during the Pleistocene and Holocene, including two large explosive <b>eruptions</b> {{during the early}} and mid-Holocene. These <b>eruptions</b> deposited significant tephra layers over Patagonia and Tierra del Fuego.|$|R
5|$|A {{possible}} way to detect an <b>eruption</b> is studying Silverthrone's geological history since every volcano {{has its own}} pattern of behavior, {{in terms of its}} <b>eruption</b> style, magnitude and frequency, so that its future <b>eruption</b> is expected to be similar to its previous eruptions.

5|$|Additional {{activity}} {{occurred in}} August 1819, {{consisting of a}} small <b>eruption</b> (VEI-2) with flames and rumbling aftershocks. It is {{considered part of the}} 1815 <b>eruption</b> sequence.|$|E
5|$|Although the {{fracturing}} {{process is}} not yet known, the altitudinal statistical analysis indicates that the caldera had formed just before the <b>eruption.</b> The area of the island was smaller, and the southern and eastern coastlines appeared regressed. During the <b>eruption,</b> the landscape was covered by the pumice sediments. In some places, the coastline vanished under thick tuff depositions. In others, recent coastlines were extended towards the sea. After the <b>eruption,</b> the geomorphology of the island was characterized by an intense erosional phase during which the pumice was progressively removed from the higher altitudes to the lower ones.|$|E

50|$|Seafloor {{exploration}} {{has discovered}} that more volcanic <b>eruptions</b> occur {{at the bottom of}} the sea than on land. However, the effects of ambient water and hydrostatic pressure on silicic volcanic <b>eruptions</b> in subaqueous settings are not entirely understood because deep marine <b>eruptions</b> are not directly observed and studied. Because of this, information of recent deep-water volcanic <b>eruptions</b> are still incomplete and limited.|$|R
5|$|Although {{volcanic}} eruptions in Hawaiʻi rarely produce casualties (the only direct historical fatality due to volcanic {{activity on the}} island occurred at Kīlauea in 1924, when an unusually explosive <b>eruption</b> hurled rocks at an onlooker), property damage due to inundation by lava is a common and costly hazard. Hawaiian-type eruptions usually produce extremely slow-moving flows that advance at walking pace, presenting little danger to human life, {{but this is not}} strictly the case; Mauna Loa's 1950 <b>eruption</b> emitted as much lava in three weeks as Kīlauea's current <b>eruption</b> produces in three years and reached sea level within four hours of its start, overrunning the village of Hoʻokena Mauka and a major highway on the way there. An earlier <b>eruption</b> in 1926 overran the village of Hoʻōpūloa Makai, and Hilo, partly built on lavas from the 1880–81 <b>eruption,</b> is at risk from future eruptions. The 1984 <b>eruption</b> nearly reached the city, but stopped short after the flow was redirected upstream.|$|E
5|$|Beginning on September1, 1948, the then-active volcano Mount Hibok-Hibok on Camiguin Island in the Philippines {{began to}} release lava {{in a series}} of <b>eruption</b> events which {{continued}} for the ensuing three years. On December4, 1951, a large, Peléan <b>eruption</b> event later rated between a 2 and 3 on the Volcanic Explosivity Index, sending pyroclastic flows and lahars down the northeast flank of the volcano. The resultant ash flows alone killed an estimated 500people on the island, {{making it one of the}} deadliest volcanic <b>eruption</b> events in recorded history. As the typhoon approached the archipelago, relief agencies were forced to divert aid operations to victims of the recent <b>eruption,</b> slowing the recovery process.|$|E

50|$|Studies of tephra layers {{have shown}} {{that a number of}} <b>eruptions</b> have {{occurred}} beneath the glacier, probably in the north-east of the crater or in Bárðarbunga. There have also been smaller <b>eruptions</b> in an ice-free area of Dyngjuháls to the north-east. <b>Eruptions</b> appear to follow a cycle: there were several <b>eruptions</b> in the glacier between 1701 and 1740 and since 1780.|$|R
40|$|We report {{characteristics}} of quiescent filament <b>eruptions</b> {{that did not}} produce coronal mass ejections (CMEs). It is known {{that there is a}} dichotomy of quiescent filament eruptions: those that produce CMEs and those that do not. We examined the quiescent filament <b>eruptions,</b> each of which was located far from disk center (greater than or equal to 0. 7 R(sub Sun)) in diffuse remnant magnetic fields of decayed active regions, was well observed in Ha observations and Fe XII, and had good coronagraph coverage. We present the similarity and differences of two classes of filament <b>eruptions.</b> From their lack of CME production and the appearance of their eruptive motion in Fe XII movies, we conclude that the non-CME-producing filament <b>eruptions</b> are confined <b>eruptions</b> like the confined filament <b>eruptions</b> in active regions. We take the similarity of the confined and eruptive quiescent filament <b>eruptions</b> with their active-region counterparts to favor runaway tether-cutting connection for unleashing the magnetic explosion in all these <b>eruptions...</b>|$|R
