5000|$|The line of {{the front}} {{mudguards}} [...] "which", said The Times, [...] "previously gave the car a somewhat blunt appearance" [...] was re-arranged with the side lamps and flashing indicators in different positions. A small chrome reflector on the <b>headlamp</b> <b>rim</b> allowed the driver to know the side lights were functioning. Overdrive was made an option. These amendments were announced 11 September 1956.|$|E
5000|$|The formerly-smaller Series 61 {{was moved}} to the Series 62's General Motors C-Body platform, making them very similar. Major design changes marked the C-bodied Cadillacs for 1948. They {{featured}} General Motors first all-new postwar body with styling advances including tailfins inspired by the Lockheed P-38 fighter plane. There was also an attractive eggcrate grille, which was higher in the middle than on the sides. The front of the car was protected by a heavier and more massive bumper bar that curved around the fenders. The Cadillac crest was centered low in a [...] "V" [...] above the radiator grille. Chrome <b>headlamp</b> <b>rims</b> were used. Cars in the 61 series lacked bright metal front fender shields and under-taillight trim. A new dashboard with [...] "rainbow" [...] style instrument cluster and leather grained panels extending to the carpets was seen only this year.|$|R
5000|$|Late in 1963, Rootes {{were set}} to {{discontinue}} the Rapier. It {{was no longer the}} mainstay of the competitions department because Rootes had directed its competitive effort towards the Hillman Imp and the Sunbeam Tiger. In fact a totally new Series IV Rapier had been designed, prototypes built and testing completed, and then the Rootes Group changed its mind! The new Series IV Rapier became the Mark I Humber Sceptre and the old Series IIIA Rapier was redesigned, hopefully to give it a new lease of life as a touring saloon rather than a sports coup√©. The most obvious difference was the change to 13 in road wheels in common with the rest of Rootes' light car range. This meant that the stainless steel wheel trims of earlier Rapiers were replaced by Rootes corporate hub caps and rim finishers. At the front, the car was redesigned to make it look more up-to-date. A new bonnet made the front look lower and flatter and the front wings were modified to accept extensions housing alloy side grilles and sidelights with amber turn indicators. The traditional Sunbeam grille, already stylised for the Series II, was further modified to give a lower, more square shape with a pronounced convex profile. New <b>headlamp</b> <b>rims</b> were fitted, in fact Sunbeam Alpine items but chromed for the Rapier, and a new front bumper using the same shape and profile {{as the rest of the}} Light Car range. At the back, a new full width number plate plinth appeared with a new Light Car range bumper. To give a more open look from the side, the frames were removed from the side windows. Finally, small badges fitted at the bottom of each front wing and on the boot lid proclaimed each car to be a [...] "Series IV".|$|R
