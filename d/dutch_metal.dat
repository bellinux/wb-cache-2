5|$|A {{few days}} after the show and despite a {{precarious}} health state due to strong eye inflammation, Doro was in Tilburg, the Netherlands, to participate at the first edition of Christmas Metal Symphony, where she sang accompanied by a band of <b>Dutch</b> <b>metal</b> musicians and by a symphonic orchestra.|$|E
5|$|By {{the end of}} 2001, After Forever {{appeared}} as rising stars on the dynamic scene of <b>Dutch</b> <b>metal,</b> which included bands like The Gathering, Within Temptation, Gorefest and Ayreon. Their second album Decipher (2001) had received very positive reviews and their name was {{well known in the}} underground scene of the Netherlands. Critics were impressed by the remarkable musicianship of the young members of the band and in particular by Floor Jansen’s vocals, both in studio and in live performances. In contrast with these premises for a bright future, the relationships within the band were not so idyllic. Soon after the release of Decipher, After Forever faced a strong creative contrast between founding member and guitarist Mark Jansen {{and the rest of the}} band. Mark Jansen had been the main composer of the band together with Sander Gommans and his love for movie soundtracks and classical music had had a strong influence on the musical style of After Forever’s first two albums, Prison of Desire (2000) and Decipher. Moreover, his interest for religious and moral themes had characterized his lyrics for many songs, often collected under a common title (e.g. The Embrace That Smothers and My Pledge of Allegiance). In the next album, Mark Jansen meant to further explore complex interactions between classical instruments, choruses in Latin and death metal elements, while Gommans and the others preferred a more direct and aggressive approach to music, retaining some elements that made the sound of the band recognizable, but expanding it in new and different directions. These musical differences led to Mark Jansen leaving the band, in what he felt as an actual dismissal.|$|E

500|$|Soon the Christian metal bands became {{controversial}} {{for their}} beliefs and often evangelistic {{goals in the}} metal music scene, which typically holds individualism in particularly high esteem. Stryper, for instance, although a commercial success at that time, received a hostile reception when they played at a <b>Dutch</b> <b>metal</b> festival in 1985. Regardless of this, Stryper helped to popularize the genre. They were the first Christian band to reach platinum status on an album. The 1986 album To Hell with the Devil sold 2 million copies and achieved a Grammy nomination. The music videos for [...] "Free", [...] "Calling on You", and the power ballad [...] "Honestly" [...] all spent many weeks on Music Television's Top 10, and [...] "Free" [...] was in the No. 1 position for 12 weeks (60 days), May 4 – July 24, 1987.|$|E
2500|$|Over {{the past}} decade, Wilton and Rockenfield had written songs for {{previous}} Queensrÿche albums that Tate discarded {{in favor of}} songs he wrote with outside writers, such as Jason Slater. However, they chose not to use them for this album, according to Wilton [...] "because {{there was such a}} renewed inspiration in the band. (...) I might go revisit [...] sometime, but for this album I wanted it all fresh and new." [...] Wilton has also said: [...] "Songs were often written in a day." [...] It became a collaborative effort without any involvement from outside writers, unlike the group's final albums with Tate. <b>Dutch</b> <b>metal</b> magazine Aardschok co-founder [...] "Metal Mike" [...] van Rijswijk says that during the Alcatraz Metal Festival on August 12, 2012, La Torre let him hear 17 demos they were working on, and he discovered that [...] "many of the fast-paced 'Queen of the Reich'-like tracks didn't make the album", in favor of the more mid-tempo songs that would have fitted well on Operation: Mindcrime or Empire.|$|E
60|$|I {{have turned}} away one artist: the poor {{creature}} was utterly incompetent {{to depict the}} sublime, graceful, and pathetic personages and events with which this history will most assuredly abound, and I doubt whether even the designer engaged in his place can make such a portrait of Miss Ethel Newcome as shall satisfy her friends and her own sense of justice. That blush which we have indicated, he cannot render. How are you to copy it with a steel point and a ball of printer's ink? That kindness which lights up the Colonel's eyes; gives an expression to the very wrinkles round about them; shines as a halo round his face;--what artist can paint it? The painters of old, when they portrayed sainted personages, were fain to have recourse to compasses and gold leaf--as if celestial splendour could be represented by <b>Dutch</b> <b>metal!</b> As our artist cannot come up to this task, the reader will be pleased to let his fancy paint for itself the look of courtesy for a woman, admiration for a young beauty, protection for an innocent child, {{all of which are}} expressed upon the Colonel's kind face, as his eyes are set upon Ethel Newcome.|$|E

60|$|And, indeed, a great dramatist, as he was, {{could not}} but have felt very much {{hampered}} at being obliged continually {{to interrupt the}} progress of a play in order to send on some one {{to explain to the}} audience that the scene was to be changed to a particular place on the entrance of a particular character, and after his exit to somewhere else; that the stage was to represent the deck of a ship in a storm, or the interior of a Greek temple, or the streets of a certain town, to all of which inartistic devices Shakespeare is reduced, and for which he always amply apologises. Besides this clumsy method, Shakespeare had two other substitutes for scenery--the hanging out of a placard, and his descriptions. The first of these could hardly have satisfied his passion for picturesqueness and his feeling for beauty, and certainly did not satisfy the dramatic critic of his day. But as regards the description, {{to those of us who}} look on Shakespeare not merely as a playwright but as a poet, and who enjoy reading him at home just as much as we enjoy seeing him acted, it may be a matter of congratulation that he had not at his command such skilled machinists as are in use now at the Princess's and at the Lyceum. For had Cleopatra's barge, for instance, been a structure of canvas and <b>Dutch</b> <b>metal,</b> it would probably have been painted over or broken up after the withdrawal of the piece, and, even had it survived to our own day, would, I am afraid, have become extremely shabby by this time. Whereas now the beaten gold of its poop is still bright, and the purple of its sails still beautiful; its silver oars are not tired of keeping time to the music of the flutes they follow, nor the Nereid's flower-soft hands of touching its silken tackle; the mermaid still lies at its helm, and still on its deck stand the boys with their coloured fans. Yet lovely as all Shakespeare's descriptive passages are, a description is in its essence undramatic. Theatrical audiences are far more impressed by what they look at than by what they listen to; and the modern dramatist, in having the surroundings of his play visibly presented to the audience when the curtain rises, enjoys an advantage for which Shakespeare often expresses his desire. It is true that Shakespeare's descriptions are not what descriptions are in modern plays--accounts of what the audience can observe for themselves; they are the imaginative method by which he creates in the mind of the spectators the image of that which he desires them to see. Still, the quality of the drama is action. It is always dangerous to pause for picturesqueness. And the introduction of self-explanatory scenery enables the modern method to be far more direct, while the loveliness of form and colour which it gives us, seems to me often to create an artistic temperament in the audience, and to produce that joy in beauty for beauty's sake, without which the great masterpieces of art can never be understood, to which, and to which only, are they ever revealed.|$|E
