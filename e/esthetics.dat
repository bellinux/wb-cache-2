5|$|The {{prosthetic}} phase begins {{once the}} implant is well integrated (or has a reasonable assurance {{that it will}} integrate) and an abutment is in place to bring it through the mucosa. Even {{in the event of}} early loading (less than 3 months), many practitioners will place temporary teeth until osseointegration is confirmed. The prosthetic phase of restoring an implant requires an equal amount of technical expertise as the surgical because of the biomechanical considerations, especially when multiple teeth are to be restored. The dentist will work to restore the vertical dimension of occlusion, the <b>esthetics</b> of the smile, and the structural integrity of the teeth to evenly distribute the forces of the implants.|$|E
5|$|The {{book had}} {{chapters}} on memory, imitation and suggestion, perceptual illusions, and <b>esthetics.</b> In these he refuted {{the idea that}} experience was just the external environment acting on and molding a mind working as a passive recipient. Stratton saw the sensation of time as being multidimensional, in analogy with perception of space. That we could simultaneously hear separately, without synthesizing, multiple mixed tones meant our experiences did not necessarily come in single file temporally. To Stratton this meant time had multiple dimensions, since simultaneous events could not be distinguished on the one past-present-future dimension of time alone. He did not address how the other dimensions could be in temporal-space if the events were indistinguishable temporally to begin with. He also analyzed poetic measure as mathematically connected to the waxing and waning span of attention, tying the arts to psychology. This last was rebutted by Charles Samuel Myers, writing in Nature, who saw poetry and its rhythm as too complex a subject to be reduced to the arithmetic of attention spans.|$|E
5|$|Tokyopop's {{localized}} volumes {{appeared on}} ICv2's monthly top one-hundred selling graphic novels. The Rozen Maiden manga has received generally positive reviews. Anime News Network praised Peach-Pit's works as always {{being able to}} evoke excitement or laughter from its readers but was critical about Rozen Maidens lack of plot and criticized how the dialogue or layout can be vague. Comic Book Bin wrote that while Rozen Maiden was not a splendid manga, its emphasis on psychology and emotion was something American comics should follow to expand their readership. Active Anime praised several aspects of the series: the combination of mystery, comedy, and cuteness with a balance of fantasy and drama; the visual <b>esthetics</b> of the images and characters; and a broadness that extends towards teens and adults. Initially, Anime Land praised the balance between comedic daily life and the underlying {{dark side of the}} plot. In later volumes though, Anime Land criticized the story's pacing and the abrupt ending. In their review of the sequel, Anime Land wrote they were surprised by the dark tone and how the plot was confusing even with knowledge from the first series. Manga-News also praised the story's alteration between moments of peace and conflict but panned the latter volumes for being rushed and losing the story's complexity. In their review of the sequel, Manga-News praised the introduction for being interesting and accessible to new readers.|$|E

25|$|For Peirce, First Philosophy, {{which he}} also called cenoscopy, is less basic than {{mathematics}} and more basic than the special sciences (of nature and mind). It studies positive phenomena in general, phenomena available to any person at any waking moment, {{and does not}} settle questions by resorting to special experiences. He divided such philosophy into (1) phenomenology (which he also called phaneroscopy or categorics), (2) normative sciences (<b>esthetics,</b> ethics, and logic), and (3) metaphysics; his views on them are discussed in order below.|$|E

25|$|Bruxism {{can cause}} {{significant}} tooth wear {{if it is}} severe, and sometimes dental restorations (crowns, fillings etc.) are damaged or lost, sometimes repeatedly. Most dentists therefore prefer to keep dental treatment in people with bruxism very simple and only carry it out when essential, since any dental work is likely to fail in the long term. Dental implants and complex bridgework for example are relatively contraindicated in bruxists. In the case of crowns, {{the strength of the}} restoration becomes more important, sometimes at the cost of aesthetic considerations. E.g. a full coverage gold crown, which has a degree of flexibility and also involves less removal (and therefore less weakening) of the underlying natural tooth may be more appropriate than other types of crown which are primarily designed for <b>esthetics</b> rather than durability. Porcelain veneers on the incisors are particularly vulnerable to damage, and sometimes a crown can be perforated by occlusal wear.|$|E
500|$|Criteria for {{the success}} of the implant {{supported}} dental prosthetic varies from study to study, but can be broadly classified into failures due to the implant, soft tissues or prosthetic components or a lack of satisfaction {{on the part of the}} patient. The most commonly cited criteria for success are function of at least five years in the absence of pain, mobility, radiographic lucency and [...] peri-implant bone loss of greater than 1.5mm [...] on the implant, the lack of suppuration or bleeding in the soft tissues and occurrence of technical complications/prosthetic maintenance, adequate function, and <b>esthetics</b> in the prosthetic. In addition, the patient should ideally be free of pain, paraesthesia, able to chew and taste and be pleased with the <b>esthetics.</b>|$|E
500|$|The {{novel is}} well known for its style, which is {{variously}} described as modern, hard-boiled, or understated. As a novice writer and journalist in Paris, Hemingway turned to Ezra Pound—who had a reputation as [...] "an unofficial minister of culture who acted as mid-wife for new literary talent"—to mark and blue-ink his short stories. [...] From Pound, Hemingway learned to write in the modernist style: he used understatement, pared away sentimentalism, and presented images and scenes without explanations of meaning, most notably at the book's conclusion, in which multiple future possibilities are left for Brett and Jake. The scholar Anders Hallengren writes that because Hemingway learned from Pound to [...] "distrust adjectives," [...] he created a style [...] "in accordance with the <b>esthetics</b> and ethics of raising the emotional temperature towards the level of universal truth by shutting the door on sentiment, on the subjective." ...|$|E

2500|$|Peirce {{distinguished}} {{philosophical logic}} as logic per se from mathematics of logic.

He argued that, more generally, as inference, [...] "logic {{is rooted in the}} social principle", since inference depends on a standpoint that, in a sense, is unlimited.|$|E
2500|$|Fascinated by the <b>esthetics</b> of transparency, Beasley {{worked in}} cast acrylic {{for the next}} ten years.

2500|$|In {{addition}} to his work as an artist, during these years Cohen Gan continued to write articles on <b>esthetics</b> in which he also included various biographical treatments.

[...] His book, [...] "Art, Law, and the Social Order," [...] documents his 1993 legal battle against the Bezalel Academy of Arts and Design in an attempt to receive the same conditions as a Professor of Art that professors of science receive.|$|E
2500|$|Peirce {{regarded}} logic per se as {{a division}} of philosophy, as a normative science based on <b>esthetics</b> and ethics, as more basic than metaphysics, and as [...] "the art of devising methods of research". More generally, as inference, [...] "logic {{is rooted in the}} social principle", since inference depends on a standpoint that, in a sense, is unlimited. Peirce called (with no sense of deprecation) [...] "mathematics of logic" [...] much of the kind of thing which, in current research and applications, is called simply [...] "logic". He was productive in both (philosophical) logic and logic's mathematics, which were connected deeply in his work and thought.|$|E
2500|$|Many of {{the later}} 20th-century composers in various modernist and minimalist styles came from outside of New York City, such as John Cage from Los Angeles, though many studied, performed, or {{conducted}} in New York. John Corigliano, however, is a New York native who has worked exclusively in tonal idioms {{for most of his}} career. [...] Steve Reich innovated a technique known as phasing, in which two musical activities are begun simultaneously and repeated, gradually drifting out of sync with each other in a natural evolution. Reich was also very interested in non-Western music, incorporating African rhythmic techniques in his compositions Drumming. Rhys Chatham as well as Glenn Branca blended the minimal music with modern rock <b>esthetics</b> and began writing microtonal pieces for large orchestras of guitarists but also wrote other classical pieces with non-amplified instruments. Kyle Gann is a musicologist as well as a composer of post modern pieces.|$|E
2500|$|Thomas Hine {{identified}} 1954–64 as the campiest {{period in}} modern U.S. history. During this time, Americans had {{more money to}} spend, thanks to the post-war economic boom; but they often exercised poor taste. In the UK, on the other hand, camp is an adjective, often associated with a stereotypical view of feminine gay men. The term has been in common use for many decades. Gay comedian Kenneth Williams wrote in a diary entry for 1 January 1947: [...] "Went to Singapore with Stan—very camp evening, was followed, but tatty types so didn't bother to make overtures." [...] Although it applies to gay men, it is a specific adjective used to describe a man that openly promotes {{the fact that he}} is gay by being outwardly garish or eccentric, for example, the character Daffyd Thomas in the English comedy skit show Little Britain. [...] "Camp" [...] forms a strong element in UK culture, and many so-called gay-icons and objects are chosen as such because they are camp. People like Kylie Minogue, John Inman, Lawrence Llewelyn Bowen, Lulu, Graham Norton, Mika, Lesley Joseph, Ruby Wax, Dale Winton, Cilla Black, and the music hall tradition of the pantomime are camp elements in popular culture. The British tradition of the [...] "Last Night of the Proms" [...] has been said to glory in nostalgia, camp, and pastiche. Thomas Dworzak published a collection of portrait photographs of Taliban soldiers, found in Kabul photo studios. The Taliban book shows a campy <b>esthetics,</b> quite close to the gay movement in California or a Peter Greenaway film.|$|E

60|$|The problem, as {{it seems}} to me, {{presented}} to the New World, is, under permanent law and order, and after preserving cohesion, (ensemble-individuality,) at all hazards, to vitalize man's free play of special Personalism, recognizing in it something that calls ever more to be consider'd, fed, and adopted as the substratum for the best that belongs to us, (government indeed is for it,) including the new <b>esthetics</b> of our future.|$|E
6000|$|Nearer than this. It is not {{generally}} realized, {{but it is}} true, as the genius of Greece, and all the sociology, personality, politics and religion of those wonderful states, resided in their literature or <b>esthetics,</b> that what was afterwards the main support of European chivalry, the feudal, ecclesiastical, dynastic world over there--forming its osseous structure, holding it together for hundreds, thousands of years, preserving its flesh and bloom, giving it form, decision, rounding it out, and so saturating it in the conscious and unconscious blood, breed, belief, and intuitions of men, that it still prevails powerful to this day, {{in defiance of the}} mighty changes of time--was its literature, permeating to the very marrow, especially that major part, its enchanting songs, ballads, and poems.[21] ...|$|E
60|$|And, if {{we think}} of it, what does civilization itself rest upon--and what object has it, with its religions, arts, schools, &c., but rich, luxuriant, varied personalism? To that, all bends; and it is because toward such result {{democracy}} alone, on anything like Nature's scale, breaks up the limitless fallows of humankind, and plants the seed, and gives fair play, that its claims now precede the rest. The literature, songs, <b>esthetics,</b> &c., of a country are of importance principally because they furnish the materials and suggestions of personality for the women and men of that country, and enforce them in a thousand effective ways.[27] As the topmost claim of a strong consolidating of the nationality of these States, is, that only by such powerful compaction can the separate States secure that full and free swing within their spheres, which is becoming to them, each after its kind, so will individuality, with unimpeded branchings, flourish best under imperial republican forms.|$|E
60|$|Never {{had real}} bard a task more fit for sublime ardor and genius than to sing worthily the songs these States have already indicated. Their origin, Washington, '76, the {{picturesqueness}} of old times, {{the war of}} 1812 and the sea-fights; the incredible rapidity of movement and breadth of area--to fuse and compact the South and North, the East and West, to express the native forms, situations, scenes, from Montauk to California, and from the Saguenay to the Rio Grande--the working out on such gigantic scales, and with such a swift and mighty play of changing light and shade, of the great problems of man and freedom,--how {{far ahead of the}} stereotyped plots, or gem-cutting, or tales of love, or wars of mere ambition! Our history is so full of spinal, modern, germinal subjects--one above all. What the ancient siege of Illium, and the puissance of Hector's and Agamemnon's warriors proved to Hellenic art and literature, and all art and literature since, may prove the war of attempted secession of 1861-'65 to the future <b>esthetics,</b> drama, romance, poems of the United States.|$|E
60|$|We see our land, America, her literature, <b>esthetics,</b> &c., as, substantially, the {{getting in}} form, or effusement and statement, of deepest basic {{elements}} and loftiest final meanings, {{of history and}} man--and the portrayal, (under the eternal laws and conditions of beauty,) of our own physiognomy, the subjective tie and expression of the objective, as from our own combination, continuation, and points of view--and the deposit and record of the national mentality, character, appeals, heroism, wars, and even liberties--where these, and all, culminate in native literary and artistic formulation, to be perpetuated; and not having which native, first-class formulation, she will flounder about, and her other, however imposing, eminent greatness, prove merely a passing gleam; but truly having which, she will understand herself, live nobly, nobly contribute, emanate, and, swinging, poised safely on herself, illumin'd and illuming, become a full-form'd world, and divine Mother not only of material but spiritual worlds, in ceaseless succession through time--the main thing being the average, the bodily, the concrete, the democratic, the popular, on which all the superstructures of the future are to permanently rest.|$|E

Why would any intrusion, even from people I like, spoil the charm? But am I alone? Doubtless there comes a time--perhaps it has come to me--when one feels through his whole being, and pronouncedly the emotional part, that identity between himself subjectively and Nature objectively which Schelling and Fichte are so fond of pressing. How it is I know not, but I often realize a presence here--in clear moods I am certain of it, and neither chemistry nor reasoning nor <b>esthetics</b> will give the least explanation. All the past two summers it has been strengthening and nourishing my sick body and soul, as never before.

60|$|Nick sauntered {{about the}} church--it {{took a good}} while; he leaned against low things {{and looked up at}} it while he smoked another cigarette. It struck him as a great pity such a pile should be touched: so much of the past was buried there that it was like desecrating, like digging up a grave. Since the years were letting it down so gently why jostle the elbow of slow-fingering time? The fading {{afternoon}} was exquisitely pure; the place was empty; he heard nothing but the cries of several children, which sounded sweet, who were playing on the flatness of the very old tombs. He knew this would inevitably be one of the topics at dinner, the restoration of the abbey; it would give rise to a considerable deal of orderly debate. Lord Bottomley, oddly enough, would probably oppose the expensive project, but on grounds that would be characteristic of him even if the attitude were not. Nick's nerves always knew on this spot what it was to be soothed; but he shifted his position with a slight impatience as the vision came over him of Lord Bottomley's treating a question of <b>esthetics.</b> It was enough to make one want to take the other side, the idea of having the same taste as his lordship: one would have it for such different reasons.|$|E
60|$|In short, as, {{though it}} may not be realized, it is {{strictly}} true, that a few first-class poets, philosophs, and authors, have substantially settled and given status to the entire religion, education, law, sociology, &c., of the hitherto civilized world, by tinging and often creating the atmospheres out of which they have arisen, such also must stamp, and more than ever stamp, the interior and real democratic construction of this American continent, to-day, and days to come. Remember also this fact of difference, that, while through the antique and through the mediaeval ages, highest thoughts and ideals realized themselves, and their expression made its way by other arts, as much as, or even more than by, technical literature, (not open to the mass of persons, or even to the majority of eminent persons,) such literature in our day and for current purposes, is not only more eligible than all the other arts put together, but has become the only general means of morally influencing the world. Painting, sculpture, and the dramatic theatre, it would seem, no longer play an indispensable or even important part in the workings and mediumship of intellect, utility, or even high <b>esthetics.</b> Architecture remains, doubtless with capacities, and a real future. Then music, the combiner, nothing more spiritual, nothing more sensuous, a god, yet completely human, advances, prevails, holds highest place; supplying in certain wants and quarters what nothing else could supply. Yet in the civilization of to-day it is undeniable that, over all the arts, literature dominates, serves beyond all--shapes the character of church and school--or, at any rate, is capable of doing so. Including the literature of science, its scope is indeed unparallel'd.|$|E
60|$|Arrived now, definitely, at an apex {{for these}} Vistas, I confess that the {{promulgation}} {{and belief in}} such a class or institution--a new and greater literatus order--its possibility, (nay certainty,) underlies these entire speculations--and that the rest, the other parts, as superstructures, are all founded upon it. It really {{seems to me the}} condition, not only of our future national and democratic development, but of our perpetuation. In the highly artificial and materialistic bases of modern civilization, with the corresponding arrangements and methods of living, the force-infusion of intellect alone, the depraving influences of riches just as much as poverty, the absence of all high ideals in character--with the long series of tendencies, shapings, which few are strong enough to resist, and which now seem, with steam-engine speed, to be everywhere turning out the generations of humanity like uniform iron castings--all of which, as compared with the feudal ages, we can yet do nothing better than accept, make the best of, and even welcome, upon the whole, for their oceanic practical grandeur, and their restless wholesale kneading of the masses--I say of all this tremendous and dominant play of solely materialistic bearings upon current life in the United States, with the results as already seen, accumulating, and reaching far into the future, that they must either be confronted and met by at least an equally subtle and tremendous force-infusion for purposes of spiritualization, for the pure conscience, for genuine <b>esthetics,</b> and for absolute and primal manliness and womanliness--or else our modern civilization, with all its improvements, is in vain, and we are on the road to a destiny, a status, equivalent, in its real world, to that of the fabled damned.|$|E
6000|$|Nor must I fail, {{again and}} yet again, to clinch, {{reiterate}} more plainly still, (O that indeed such survey as we fancy, may show in time this part completed also!) the lofty aim, surely the proudest and the purest, in whose service the future literatus, of whatever field, may gladly labor. As we have intimated, offsetting the material civilization of our race, our nationality, its wealth, territories, factories, population, products, trade, and military and naval strength, and breathing breath of life into all these, and more, must be its moral civilization--the formulation, expression, and aidancy whereof, {{is the very}} highest height of literature. The climax of this loftiest range of civilization, rising above all the gorgeous shows and results of wealth, intellect, power, and art, as such--above even theology and religious fervor--is to be its development, from the eternal bases, and the fit expression, of absolute Conscience, moral soundness, Justice. Even in religious fervor there is a touch of animal heat. But moral conscientiousness, crystalline, without flaw, not Godlike only, entirely human, awes and enchants forever. Great is emotional love, even {{in the order of}} the rational universe. But, if we must make gradations, I am clear there is something greater. Power, love, veneration, products, genius, <b>esthetics,</b> tried by subtlest comparisons, analyses, and in serenest moods, somewhere fail, somehow become vain. Then noiseless, withflowing steps, the lord, the sun, the last ideal comes. By the names right, justice, truth, we suggest, but do not describe it. To the world of men it remains a dream, an idea as they call it. But no dream is it to the wise--but the proudest, almost only solid, lasting thing of all. Its analogy in the material universe is what holds together this world, and every object upon it, and carries its dynamics on forever sure and safe. Its lack, and the persistent shirking of it, as in life, sociology, literature, politics, business, and even sermonizing, these times, or any times, still leaves the abysm, the mortal flaw and smutch, mocking civilization to-day, with all its unquestion'd triumphs, and all the civilization so far known.[30] ...|$|E
6000|$|There need never, at the worst, be any {{difficulty}} {{about the}} things advantageously chuckable for art; the question is all but of choosing them in the heap. Yet were I to represent a struggle--an interesting one, indispensably--with the passions of the theatre (as a profession, {{or at least as}} an absorption) I should have to place the theatre in another light than the satiric. This, however, would by good luck be perfectly possible too--without a sacrifice of truth; and I should doubtless even be able to make my theatric case as important as I might desire it. It seemed clear that I needed big cases--small ones would practically give my central idea away; and I make out now my still labouring under the illusion that the case of the sacrifice for art can ever be, with truth, with taste, with discretion involved, apparently and showily [...] "big." [...] I daresay it glimmered upon me even then that the very sharpest difficulty of the victim of the conflict I should seek to represent, and the very highest interest of his predicament, dwell deep in the fact that his repudiation of the great obvious, great moral or functional or useful character, shall just have to consent to resemble a surrender for absolutely nothing. Those characters are all large and expansive, seated and established and endowed; whereas the most charming truth about the preference for art is that to parade abroad so thoroughly inward and so naturally embarrassed a matter is to falsify and vulgarise it; that as a preference attended with the honours of publicity it is indeed nowhere; that in fact, under the rule of its sincerity, its only honours are those of contradiction, concentration and a seemingly deplorable indifference to everything but itself. Nothing can well figure as less [...] "big," [...] in an honest thesis, than a marked instance of somebody's willingness to pass mainly for an ass. Of these things I must, I say, have been in strictness aware; what I perhaps failed of was to note that if a certain romantic glamour (even that of mere eccentricity or of a fine perversity) may be flung over the act of exchange of a [...] "career" [...] for the esthetic life in general, the prose and the modesty of the matter yet come in with any exhibition of the particular branch of <b>esthetics</b> selected. Then it is that the attitude of hero or heroine may look too much--for the romantic effect--like a low crouching over proved trifles. Art indeed has in our day taken on so many honours and emoluments that the recognition of its importance is more than a custom, has become on occasion almost a fury: the line is drawn--especially in the English world--only at the importance of heeding what it may mean.|$|E
6000|$|It {{was as a}} man of {{the world}} that, for all his youth, La Farge rose or, still better, bowed, before us, his inclinations of obeisance, his {{considerations}} of address being such as we had never seen and now almost publicly celebrated. This was what most immediately and most iridescently showed, the truth being all the while that the character took on in him particular values without which it often enough, though then much more grossly, flourishes. It was by these enrichments of curiosity, of taste and genius, that he became the personality, as we nowadays say, that I have noted--the full freshness of all of which was to play but through his younger time, or at least through our younger apprehension. He was so [...] "intellectual"--that was the flower; it crowned his being personally so finished and launched. The wealth of his cultivation, the variety of his initiations, the inveteracy of his forms, the degree of his empressement (this in itself, I repeat, a revelation) made him, with those elements of the dandy and the cavalier to which he struck us as so picturesquely sacrificing, a cluster of bright promises, a rare original and, though not at all a direct model for simpler folk, as we then could but feel ourselves, an embodiment of the gospel of <b>esthetics.</b> Those more resounding forms that our age was to see this gospel take on were then still to come, but I was to owe them in the later time not half the thrill that the La Farge of the prime could set in motion. He was really an artistic, an esthetic nature of wondrous homogeneity; one was to have known in the future many an unfolding that went with a larger ease and a shrewder economy, but never to have seen a subtler mind or a more generously wasteful passion, in other words a sincerer one, addressed to the problems of the designer and painter. Of his long later history, full of flights and drops, advances and retreats, experiment and performance, of the endless complications of curiosity and perversity, I say nothing here save that if it was to contradict none of our first impressions it was to qualify them all by others still more lively; these things belonging quite to some other record. Yet I may just note that they were to represent in some degree an eclipse of the so essentially harmonious person round whom a positive grace of legend had originally formed itself. I see him at this hour again as that bright apparition; see him, jacketed in black velvet or clad from top to toe in old-time elegances of cool white and leaning much forward with his protuberant and over-glazed, his doubting yet all-seizing vision, dandle along the shining Newport sands in far-away summer sunsets on a charming chestnut mare whose light legs and fine head and great sweep of tail showed the Arab strain--quite as if (what would have been characteristic of him) he had borrowed his mount from the adorable Fromentin, whom we already knew as a painter, but whose acquaintance as a writer we were of course so promptly to owe him that when [...] "Dominique" [...] broke upon us out of the Revue {{as one of the most}} exquisite literary events of our time it found us doubly responsive.|$|E
