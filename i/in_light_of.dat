The Metropolitan Railway extension from Harrow to Uxbridge was also discussed at the meeting on 28 October 1903, as a station was to be opened in Ruislip on the line.

5|$|At the conference, <b>in</b> <b>light</b> <b>of</b> {{the little}} {{information}} available on Egyptian dispositions and intentions, {{and due to}} a shortage of infantry and artillery, the commanders agreed they could not relieve the surrounded strongpoints on the canal in the near future.

Southern Command expected to have 640 tanks on Monday October 8, of which 530 tanks would be distributed among three divisions: 200 tanks under Adan, 180 under Sharon, and 150 under Mandler after part of his losses were replaced. Estimates put the number of Egyptian tanks at 400, when there were in fact 800 tanks across the canal by Sunday evening. <b>In</b> <b>light</b> <b>of</b> the apparent superiority, Gonen recommended a frontal attack at night with Adan's 162nd Division crossing to the west bank at El-Qantarah and Sharon's 143rd Division crossing into Suez City. Adan however, lacking infantry, urged a cautious approach until more reserves reached the front.|$|E
