50|$|Some {{scholars}} who consider Jude to predate 2 Peter {{note that the}} latter appears to quote the former but <b>excises</b> the <b>reference</b> to the non-canonical book of Enoch.|$|R
50|$|Following a {{more relaxed}} {{attitude}} towards the hobby, Wizards of the Coast reinserted many of these <b>excised</b> <b>references</b> in the third edition of the game. This said, they kept intact the terms they had been replaced with, using both when applicable to appeal both to older players and those who played in subsequent editions of the game which introduced {{the use of the}} replacement terms (which were used during the 2nd edition of the game, in which the vast majority of material on the fiends of D&D was expanded and given depth). The latest edition of the game does not however use the 1st edition D&D term 'Daemon', instead continuing to use 'Yugoloth' in its place, leaving 'daemon' as an effectively defunct and abandoned term (in our world, daemon are something close to a muse, a divine inspiration in the Greek mythology and so effectively do not fill in the role of evildoer).|$|R
5000|$|The {{show was}} finally dubbed into Arabic in September 2005, {{under the title}} [...] "Al-Shamshoon" [...] (آل شمشون). In {{addition}} to being dubbed in Arabic (with subtitles provided for shots including written English, such as the chalkboards), references to alcohol, pork, and numerous other themes have been deleted or significantly modified. For instance, Homer drinks soda-pop instead of beer, eats beef sausages and hot dogs as opposed to pork, while shots of him eating bacon and pork rinds were removed entirely, eats ka'ak instead of donuts, and all references to Moe's Tavern were cut. References to Rabbi Krustofsky, Krusty the Clown's father, were removed as well. According to Richard Poplak of the CBC, an ex-Disney employee in Lebanon told him that, in Poplak's words, [...] "if a TV station can help it, they’ll <b>excise</b> <b>references</b> to Judaism from shows meant for the pan-Arab market." [...] Badih Fattouh, MBC 1's acquisitions and drama commissioner head, said, [...] "You must understand {{that we did not}} simply dub, but we Arabized the concept, and we toned it down a bit. We toned down the language — we Arabized it in the cultural sense." ...|$|R
25|$|The {{original}} broadcasts included {{references to}} the sponsor, Coca-Cola. Subsequent broadcasts and home media releases have <b>excised</b> all <b>references</b> to Coca-Cola products. Later subsequent broadcasts of the special also had some scenes, animation, including sound effects being redone for correction. Snoopy's dog bowl was given a new color, Charlie Brown no longer looked off-model in Lucy's psychiatric booth, new animation was placed in scenes where Charlie Brown was giving directions at the auditorium, the hearts when Sally gets enamored in Linus were redone, and Snoopy no longer sings like a human in the final carol.|$|R
30|$|Each of {{the stained}} protein {{containing}} bands {{observed in the}} electrophoresis gel was <b>excised</b> from <b>reference</b> gels for identification by matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF MS) according to the method of Aluko et al. (2004). After MALDI-TOF analysis of tryptic peptides, mass tags were searched against the mustard UniGene database using the MS-FIT program of Protein Prospector (University of California, San Francisco, CA, USA) with autocatalytic trypsin fragments as internal calibration standards. All searches were performed against the National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI) mustard UniGene database.|$|R

50|$|In 2008, a film student {{reported}} that the Hungarian National Film Archive possesses a longer print of the film. While the print does not contain the opening musical number, it does contain several <b>excised</b> lines <b>referencing</b> Italy that had been cut upon the film's re-release in the 1940s. With the opening number still missing, {{it may be that}} this scene was cut after its original preview screenings during the 1930s rather than during its re-release, as previously thought. However, the discovery of the Hungarian print has not yet been independently verified, and Turner Entertainment, who owns the rights to the film, has not indicated that any restoration is forthcoming.|$|R
40|$|This paper {{reviews the}} {{economics}} of taxation. It falls into three parts. The first part examines the rationale of <b>excise</b> taxation by <b>reference</b> to the non-revenue objectives that are pursued through the imposition of the various duties. The second part discusses the instruments that can be applied, i. e. duties, regulations and permits. The third part reviews some issues - discrimination, coordination and earmarking - that often arise in connection with excise taxation. ...|$|R
5000|$|The {{character}} of Marshal Duncan was played by Buddy Van Horn, Eastwood's long-time stunt double, {{to suggest that}} he and the Stranger could be the same person. In an interview, Eastwood said that earlier versions of the script made the Stranger the dead marshal's brother. He favored a less explicit and more supernatural interpretation, and <b>excised</b> the <b>reference.</b> The Italian, Spanish, French and German dubbings restored it. [...] "It's just an allegory," [...] he said, [...] "a speculation on what happens when they go ahead and kill the sheriff and somebody comes back and calls the town's conscience to bear. There's always retribution for your deeds." [...] The graveyard set featured in the film's final scene included tombstones inscribed [...] "Sergio Leone" [...] and [...] "Don Siegel" [...] as a humorous tribute to the two influential directors.|$|R
2500|$|In 1975, {{the lack}} of {{consensus}} surfaced during the compilation of a new standard prayer book, [...] "Gates of Prayer." [...] To accommodate all, ten liturgies for morning service and six for evening were offered for each congregation to choose of, from very traditional to one that retained the Hebrew text for God but translated it as [...] "Eternal Power", condemned by many as de facto humanistic. [...] "Gates of Prayer" [...] symbolized the movement's adoption {{of what would be}} termed [...] "Big Tent Judaism", welcoming all, over theological clarity. In the following year, an attempt to draft a new platform for the CCAR in San Francisco ended with poor results. Led by Borowitz, any notion of issuing guidelines was abandoned in favour of a [...] "Centenary Perspective" [...] with few coherent statements. The [...] "Big Tent", while taking its toll on the theoreticians, did substantially bolster constituency. The UAHC slowly caught up with Conservative Judaism on the path toward becoming the largest American denomination. Yet it did not erase boundaries completely, and rejected outright those who held syncretic beliefs like Jewbu and Messianic Judaism, and also Sherwin Wine-style Secular Humanistic Judaism. Congregation Beth Adam, which <b>excised</b> all <b>references</b> to God from its liturgy, was denied UAHC membership by a landslide vote of 113:15 in 1994.|$|R
40|$|For most xenobiotics, {{the rates}} of {{percutaneous}} absorption are limited by diffusion through the horny layer of skin. However, percutaneous absorption of chemicals may seriously increase when the skin is damaged. The aim of this work was to develop an in vitro representative model of mechanically damaged skins. The epidermal barrier was examined following exposure to a razor, a rotating brush, and a microneedle system in comparison to tape-stripping which acted as a <b>reference.</b> <b>Excised</b> full-thickness skins were mounted on a diffusion chamber in order to evaluate the effect of injuries and to mimic physiological conditions. The transepidermal water loss (TEWL) was greatly increased when the barrier function was compromised. Measurements were made for all the damaged biopsies and observed histologically by microscopy. On human and porcine skins, the tape-stripping application (0 to 40 times) showed a proportional increase in TEWL which highlights {{the destruction of the}} stratum corneum. Similar results were obtained for all cosmetic instruments. This is reflected in our study by the nonsignificant difference of the mean TEWL scores between 30 strips and mechanical damage. For a specific appreciation, damaged skins were then selected to qualitatively evaluate the absorption of a chlorogenic acid solution using fluorescence microscopy...|$|R
