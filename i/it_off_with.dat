5|$|Writing in the Jamaican {{broadsheet}} The Gleaner, Carolyn Cooper, Professor of Literary and Cultural Studies at UWI, {{condemned the}} group who committed Jones' murder. She blamed their behaviour on the selective {{use of the}} Bible, noting that while many Jamaicans embrace those Biblical passages which condemn same-sex sexual activity and cross-dressing, they are themselves typically guilty of many other Biblical sins, such as adultery and murder. She commented that Jones had been killed just for being himself and expressed the hope that his killers face legal prosecution for their crime. The following week she published a follow-up article in which she responded to several emails that she had received which claimed that the real victims of the scenario were the men whom Jones deceived when he was dancing with them. She reiterated her condemnation of Jones' killers, remarking that rather than retaliating violently, they should have brushed <b>it</b> <b>off</b> <b>with</b> a humorous comment.|$|E

The rest {{of the third quarter}} was scoreless, but midway through the fourth quarter, Troy Brown's 10-yard punt return gave the Patriots great field position at the Titans 40-yard line. The Patriots gained only 13 yards on their ensuing possession (including a critical 4-yard completion from Brady to Brown on fourth down and 3), but it was enough for Vinatieri to make a 46-yard field goal, giving New England a 17–14 lead with 4:02 left in regulation.|$|E

However, 49ers defensive end Roy Barker intercepted Detmer with 43 {{seconds left in the}} half, and the Eagles would never seriously threaten again.|$|E

Anderson was injured early in the drive and replaced for two plays by Jack Thompson. But Johnson kept the Bengals moving on those plays, first rushing for eight yards and then gaining 14 yards on a screen pass on third down and 8. Later on the drive, Johnson converted a fourth and inches situation with a 7-yard run, and Anderson eventually finished <b>it</b> <b>off</b> <b>with</b> a 3-yard touchdown pass to Bass, making the final score 27–7. San Diego responded with a drive to the Bengals 5-yard line, but turned the ball over on downs with less than three minutes left.|$|E

25|$|The {{first half}} was a turbo charged shootout as both teams scored {{on all three}} of their possessions. Kansas City started <b>it</b> <b>off</b> <b>with</b> an 11-play, 80-yard drive in which quarterback Joe Montana, playing in his last NFL game before {{retirement}} completed all six of his passes, the last a 1-yard touchdown toss to tight end Derrick Walker. Miami responded with a 10-play, 72-yard drive including an 18-yard reception by Irving Fryar, who lateraled the ball to James Saxon for an additional 9-yard gain to the Kansas City 1. Bernie Parmalee ran the ball across the goal line from there, tying the game with 2:20 {{left in the first}} quarter. However, it took just four plays for Kansas City to retake the lead at 14-7 with Montana's 57-yard touchdown pass to running back Kimble Anders.|$|E
25|$|Green Bay regrouped on {{the opening}} drive of the second half, moving the ball 73 yards in 10 plays, the longest a 25-yard {{completion}} from Favre to receiver Donald Driver.

The key play of the drive was a 22-yard scramble by Vick, while Feely finished <b>it</b> <b>off</b> <b>with</b> a 23-yard field goal that gave the Falcons a 27-7 lead. There was still 3:46 left in the third quarter, but this would be the game's final score.

25|$|Cleveland struck back {{on their}} opening drive {{of the third quarter}} with a 79-yard, 8-play {{touchdown}} drive.

However, Denver responded with a touchdown of their own, as Sammy Winder (filling in for injured starter Bobby Humphrey) rushed for 22 yards on the drive, while Elway completed a 53-yard pass to Young and finished <b>it</b> <b>off</b> <b>with</b> a 5-yard scoring pass to tight end Orson Mobley, putting the team back up by 10 points at 17-7. Later in the quarter, Cleveland defensive back Kyle Kramer was called for a 15-yard spearing penalty on Elway's 25-yard run, setting up Winder's 7-yard touchdown run that gave the Broncos a 24-7 lead with 4:19 left in the third quarter.|$|E
