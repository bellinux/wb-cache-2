In 1945 he served as the alternate British judge at the Nuremberg trials, and he was made a Privy Counsellor in 1947. He joined the Court of Appeal of England and Wales in 1950 but retired in 1956 when he had served <b>for</b> <b>long</b> <b>enough</b> to draw a pension.

Lipton about animal rights, and Lipton (who Oscar {{suspects}} is gay) gives Oscar his private cell phone number, asking Oscar {{to call him}} in the evening to discuss issues further. Oscar tells Pam (Jenna Fischer) and Jim Halpert (John Krasinski) that the Senator was hitting on him. Jim says Lipton was likely just schmoozing a voter, talks to Lipton himself, and also gets his number. Meredith Palmer (Kate Flannery) later gets Lipton's number as well, resulting in Oscar thinking that the senator {{may not have been}} hitting on him. When Oscar is leaving, Lipton shakes his hand and caresses Oscar's arm <b>for</b> <b>long</b> <b>enough</b> that Oscar once again believes Lipton was pursuing him.|$|E

5|$|Penis pumps induce erections {{without the}} need for drugs or {{invasive}} treatments. To use a pump, the man inserts his penis into a cylinder, then pumps it to create a vacuum which draws blood into the penis, making it erect. He then slides a ring from the outside of the cylinder onto the base of the penis to hold the blood in and maintain the erection. A man who is able to get an erection but has trouble maintaining it <b>for</b> <b>long</b> <b>enough</b> can use a ring by itself. The ring cannot be left on for more than 30 minutes and cannot be used {{at the same time as}} anticoagulant medications.|$|E
5|$|The {{life cycle}} of Chirocephalus diaphanus is {{extremely}} fast. The typical duration of a full life cycle is not known, but a figure of around 3 months has been suggested. The eggs are tolerant to drying out; when their habitat fills with water again, some of the eggs will hatch, while others remain dormant. This enables the species to continue to survive in an unpredictable habitat, since some eggs remain in case the habitat does not persist <b>for</b> <b>long</b> <b>enough</b> for the animals to mate and produce offspring. Dispersal between bodies of water can occur through the movements of animals such as cattle, deer and horses.|$|E
5|$|Allemand's {{expedition}} of 1805, {{often referred}} to as the Escadre invisible (invisible squadron) in French sources, was an important French naval expedition during the Napoleonic Wars, which formed a major diversion to the ongoing Trafalgar Campaign in the Atlantic Ocean. With the French Mediterranean Fleet at sea, Emperor Napoleon I hoped to unite it with the French Atlantic Fleet and together form a force powerful enough to temporarily displace the British Royal Navy Channel Fleet <b>for</b> <b>long</b> <b>enough</b> to allow an invasion force to cross the English Channel and land in Britain. In support of this plan, the French squadron based at Rochefort put to sea in July 1805, initially with the intention that they would join the Atlantic Fleet from Brest. When this fleet failed to put to sea, the Rochefort squadron, under Contre-Admiral Zacharie Allemand, went on an extended raiding cruise across the Atlantic, both to intercept British trade left lightly defended by the concentration of British forces in European waters and with the intention of eventually combining with the French Mediterranean Fleet then blockaded in Spanish harbours.|$|E

5|$|Although it {{had lost}} its UK title, Razer still reigned as {{champion}} of the Extreme All-Stars tournament. Its first battle to defend this title was against twice UK champion Chaos 2 and dual-spinner 13 Black. Razer and 13 Black joined forces to eliminate Chaos 2, in what was its last ever fight on Robot Wars. Razer's next battle against Spawn Again was a rematch from the series five semi-finals. Razer was again the aggressor: it repeatedly punctured Spawn Again's body panels, prompting its constructors to seek safety by driving themselves into the pit. Razer's next battle was one-on-one versus 13 Black. Following an impact with the arena wall, 13 Black stopped spinning <b>for</b> <b>long</b> <b>enough</b> that Razer could lift it with the arm and lower it into the pit. In the All-Stars grand final, Razer faced Firestorm4. Razer manoeuvred its wedge underneath Firestorm4, lowered the arm and immobilised its opponent.

The Greeks observed that the charged amber buttons could attract light objects such as hair. They also found that if they rubbed the amber <b>for</b> <b>long</b> <b>enough,</b> they could even get an electric spark to jump. This property derives from the triboelectric effect.|$|E

25|$|Fusion {{reactions}} {{occur when}} {{two or more}} atomic nuclei come close enough <b>for</b> <b>long</b> <b>enough</b> that the nuclear force pulling them together exceeds the electrostatic force pushing them apart, fusing them into heavier nuclei.

Hence, nuclei smaller than iron-56 {{are more likely to}} fuse while those heavier than iron-56 are more likely to break apart.|$|E

25|$|Adverse {{possession}} {{is one of}} {{the most}} contentious methods of acquiring property, albeit one that has played a huge role in the history of English land. Historically, if someone possessed land <b>for</b> <b>long</b> <b>enough,</b> it was thought that this in itself justified acquisition of a good title. This meant that while English land was continually conquered, pillaged, and stolen by various factions, lords or barons throughout the middle ages, those who could show they possessed land long enough would not have their title questioned.|$|E
25|$|The {{situation}} is similar if two nuclei are brought together. As they approach each other, all the protons in one nucleus repel all the protons in the other. Not until the two nuclei actually come close enough <b>for</b> <b>long</b> <b>enough</b> so the {{strong nuclear force}} can take over (by way of tunneling) is the repulsive electrostatic force overcome. Consequently, even when the final energy state is lower, {{there is a large}} energy barrier that must first be overcome. It is called the Coulomb barrier.|$|E
