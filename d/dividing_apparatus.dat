40|$|FtsZ plays {{a crucial}} role in {{bacterial}} cell division, and may be involved in plastid division in eukaryotes. To in-vestigate the evolution of the <b>dividing</b> <b>apparatus</b> from pro-karyotes to eukaryotes, the ftsZ genes were isolated from the unicellular primitive red alga Galdieria sulphuraria. Two ftsZ genes (GsftsZI and GsftsZI) were isolated. This suggests that duplication and divergence of the ftsZ gene occurred in an early stage of plant evolution. A compari-son of the FtsZs of G. sulphuraria and other organisms shows that FtsZ is highly and universally conserved among prokaryotes, primitive eukaryotic algae, and higher plants. The GsftsZ 2 gene seems to contain an intron. Southern hybridization analysis of the G. sulphuraria chromosomes separated by CHEF revealed that each ftsZ gene and its flanking region may be duplicated...|$|E

40|$|A <b>divided</b> bar <b>apparatus</b> {{is deemed}} {{to be the most}} {{accurate}} method of measuring the thermal conductivity, λ, (W/mK) of intact rock cores in the laboratory. The divided bar is a steady-state comparative method in which the temperature drop across a disk of rock is compared with that across a disk of standard material of known conductivity. Thermal conductivity test results obtained from rock cores can be used in software programs to determine the design requirements for any medium to large-scale ground-source energy system. This paper describes the design and development of a low-cost <b>divided</b> bar <b>apparatus</b> and compares the values obtained to those achieved by previous researchers and those recommended by EED, a commonly used borehole heat exchanger design software program. The divided bar was designed in accordance with the following principles: keep construction costs low by using readily available materials, develop a simplistic operating procedure to promote continuity of use and cater for the testing of different sized rock cores. As there are currently no recognised testing standards available for operation of a <b>divided</b> bar <b>apparatus,</b> the sample preparation procedure for samples tested on the UCD <b>divided</b> bar <b>apparatus</b> was developed as a proposed standard testing procedure. The proposed procedure amalgamates the developments and suggestions of previous researchers in addition to published test procedures in Ulusay and Hudson (2007), and could possibly contribute towards the development of a standardised procedure for testing on a <b>divided</b> bar <b>apparatus.</b> The test results presented in this paper demonstrate a strong relationship between thermal conductivity and mineral composition with the effects of porosity also having a notable influence on the thermal conductivity of the tested rocks...|$|R

40|$|ABSTRACT: Synthetic {{samples of}} diVerent grain size {{fractions}} of quartz were prepared and the thermal conductivities {{measured with a}} <b>divided</b> bar <b>apparatus.</b> The measurements were carried out on dried and water-saturated samples both perpen-dicular and parallel to the main stress direction during compaction of the samples. A clear correlation was observed between the porosity and the measured thermal conductivities. For water-saturated samples the thermal conductivity decreases more with increasing porosity than for ideal isotropic material as predicted by the geometric mean model. A clear positive correlation was also found between the thermal conductivity and the grain sizes of the samples. When the expected eVect of porosity on the thermal conductivity was excluded, a linear correlation between the logarithm of the grain size and the measured thermal conductivities of the water-saturated samples was found. An anisotropy eVect (a=kQ/k⊥) in thermal conductivity was observed for the samples, being most prominent for the coarsest ones. The measured anisotropy {{is assumed to be}} mainly due to the thermal anisotropic nature of the quartz crystal...|$|R

40|$|The thermal {{conductivity}} of soils and rocks {{is an important}} property {{for the design of}} thermally active ground structures such as geothermal energy foundations and borehole heat exchange systems. This paper presents the results of a laboratory study of the {{thermal conductivity}} of soils and rocks from around Melbourne, Australia. The thermal conductivity of six soils and three rock types was experimentally measured using both a thermal needle probe and a <b>divided</b> bar <b>apparatus.</b> Soil samples were tested at a wide range of moisture contents and densities. The results demonstrated that the thermal conductivity varied with soil moisture content, density, mineralogical composition and particle size. Coarse grained soils were observed to have a larger thermal conductivity than fine grained soils. In addition, the thermal conductivity of soils increased with an increase in dry density and moisture content. Siltstone, sandstone and basalt rock samples were tested dry and water saturated. They demonstrated an increase in thermal conductivity with an increase in density when dry. However, when water saturated, siltstone and sandstone showed no significant correlation between density and thermal conductivity; whereas a linear increase in thermal conductivity with density was observed for the saturated basalt samples. These differences were attributed to both variations in mineralogy and anisotropy of each sample. The thermal conductivity data obtained from this study provides an initial database for soils and rocks from the Melbourne (Australia) region which can serve for the design of thermo-active structures installed locally and in locations with similar ground conditions...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{presents}} the results of 34 new heat flow estimates taken in 2004 from 16 water bores and 18 petroleum exploration wells in the western Otway Basin. The average estimated heat flow measured across the study area is 65. 6 ± 9. 4 mW/m 2, with a range of 42 – 90 mW/m 2. There are three recognisable sectors within the study area where heat flow is slightly elevated relative to the background levels. These sectors can be broadly classified as Mount Schank (73. 5 ± 0. 5 mW/m 2), Mount Burr (71. 2 ± 7. 6 mW/m 2) and Beachport (78. 3 ± 10. 4 mW/m 2). Thermal conductivity values for each unit involved in heat flow estimation were determined from laboratory measurements on representative core using a <b>divided</b> bar <b>apparatus.</b> Borehole thermal conductivity profiles were then developed in this study by assigning a constant value of conductivity to each geological formation. The process of collecting temperature data involved measuring temperature profiles for 16 water bores using a cable, winch and thermistor, and compiling well completion temperature data from 18 petroleum wells. The precision of temperature data was higher in the water bores (continuous logs) than in the petroleum wells (largely bottom-of-hole temperature estimates). Inversion heat flow modelling suggests heterogeneous heat flow at 6000 m depth, with two zones where vertical heat flow might exceed 90 mW/m 2, and several zones where vertical heat flow might be as low as 40 mW/m 2. Therefore, while slightly higher surface heat flow does coincide with some of the volcanic centres, heterogeneous basement heat production is a more likely explanation, as there are no heat flow anomalies greater than 5 – 10 mW/m 2 associated with the Pleistocene–Recent Newer Volcanics Province. The distribution of heat flow in south-east South Australia is most simply explained by non-volcanic phenomena. Chris Matthews, Graeme Beardsmore, Jim Driscoll and Nicky Pollingto...|$|R
40|$|On the one hand, {{the state}} system of the Golden Horde {{inherits}} a number of features from the former political culture of the Turkic states. On the other hand, it brings fundamental changes that determine {{the characteristics of the}} Eurasian empire. We introduce the concept of zero-point of history to explain periodization of Tatar history. In the history, the smooth flow of events breaks near the bifurcation point, when society enters into an unstable phase and a radical dismantling of social structures begins. Elements of the past remain as invariants. But they find themselves in the new assembly, which cannot be reduced to the same combinations of social elements. This is essentially new historical phase, in which one coordinate system of space-time is replaced by another and history launches a new countdown. The Golden Horde is the pinnacle of a nomadic civilization. Its prosperity was based on metallurgy, agriculture, and trade. Moreover, its main export was corn. Hundreds of cities and seaports were built in the Golden Horde, which distinguishes it from the Great Steppe. At the same time, despite the increase in sedentary population, the Golden Horde civilization retained its nomadic mentality. Chinese or European models of governance were basically impossible due to the presence of nomadic economy: it was necessary to control precisely the clans occupying certain territories. Clans were able to ensure both the collection of taxes from the mobile population and training of soldiers for the army. The clan system gave stability in the conditions of semi-nomadic life, while also allowing to control the sedentary population. The Golden Horde was a highly developed State with a strong financial system, with the state <b>apparatus</b> <b>divided</b> into two parts, one of which was associated with control of the nomadic population, and the other with the sedentary one. Territory, state structures, traditions, and political culture of the Golden Horde became the basis of the Russian Empire. To the Horde legacy the Orthodox faith was added, borrowed from Byzantium, which together determined the nature of Russia...|$|R
