25|$|If {{a player}} is in jail, {{they do not}} take a normal turn and must either pay a fine of $50 to be released, use a Chance or Community Chest <b>Get</b> <b>Out</b> <b>of</b> <b>Jail</b> Free card, or attempt to roll doubles on the dice. If a player fails to roll doubles, they lose their turn. Failing to roll doubles in three {{consecutive}} turns requires the player to either pay the $50 fine or use a <b>Get</b> <b>Out</b> <b>of</b> <b>Jail</b> Free card, after which they move ahead according to the total rolled. Players in jail may not buy properties directly from the bank, due to being unable to move, but can engage all other transactions, such as mortgaging properties, selling/trading properties to other players, buying/selling houses and hotels, collecting rent, and bidding on property auctions. A player who rolls doubles to leave jail does not roll again; however, if the player pays the fine or uses a card {{to get out and}} then rolls doubles, they do take another turn.|$|E

The series is narrated by Brenda Strong, {{from the point of view}} of the deceased Mary Alice Young, as she observes, from a unique perspective, the lives of the Wisteria Lane residents and her former best friends.

Marcia Cross portrayed Bree Van de Kamp, whose flawless life is shaken after she starts dealing with the aftermath of her husband's death, while trying to overcome her guilt for having dated the man who killed him. Former model Gabrielle Solis, portrayed by Eva Longoria, who suffers a miscarriage just as she starts accepting upcoming motherhood. Nicollette Sheridan portrayed Edie Britt, whose commitment issues and numerous one night stands have made her an iconic character.

[...] Management at the Gardens pressured the Toronto police department to release him, complaining that the sell-out crowd of 18,000 fans might riot if they canceled the show. He was released by 8 p.m. and escorted to the venue by the police, who remained at the arena throughout the performance. He displayed a jovial attitude during the concert, joking with the audience and singing in a mock operatic style for comedic effect.

500|$|Much of the 1960s {{redevelopment}} of Manchester's {{city centre}} was unpopular with residents. Market Street, near the explosion {{and at that}} time the second-busiest shopping street in the UK, was considered by some commentators a [...] "fearful" [...] place, to be [...] "avoided like the plague". Until Margaret Thatcher's third consecutive election victory in 1987, the staunchly Labour-controlled Manchester Council believed that Manchester's regeneration should be funded solely by public money, despite the government's insistence on only funding schemes with a significant element of private investment. Graham Stringer, leader of Manchester City Council, later admitted that after the 1987 General Election result [...] "there was no <b>get</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>jail</b> card.
