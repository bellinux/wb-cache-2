With a minimum constant load in the order of 10 (- 8) N, wear has been observed to occur randomly at <b>film</b> <b>defect</b> sites but also on initially intact film areas. Wear is always accompanied by an increase of friction forces. A wearless friction dependence on the scan velocity could not be observed.

40|$|The {{influence}} of oxide film defects {{generated from the}} filling process on the mechanical strength of aluminium alloy castings has been investigated. Using numerical simulation and experimental validation, the investigation aims to reveal the relationships among the liquid aluminium flow behaviour in the filling, the likely oxide <b>film</b> <b>defect</b> distribution caused by surface turbulence and the final mechanical strength of the castings. CFD modelling was used to investigate the liquid metal flow behaviour and the likely oxide <b>film</b> <b>defect</b> distribution in the filling at different ingate velocities. In particular, a numerical algorithm - Oxide Film Entrainment Tracking (OFET, 2 -D) has been proposed and developed for predicting such oxide <b>film</b> <b>defect</b> distribution in the liquid aluminium throughout the filling. Also, light microscopic and SEM techniques were used to identify the microstructures of oxide film casting defects. The Weibull statistics method was employed to quantify the effects of oxide film distributions on the mechanical strength and reliability of the acquired aluminium alloy castings for different runner systems. It was found from the numerical simulations that the ingate velocities acquired using different runner systems have significant influence {{on the distribution of}} oxide film defects generated by surface turbulence in the filling process, which results in the disparities of the final mechanical strength of the castings.

The reduction in the melt velocity was measured to be about 50 %. It was shown that if the cross section of the runner is increased more than that which is necessary to keep the metal naturally-pressurised in the running system, a considerable amount of double oxide <b>film</b> <b>defects</b> form after the filter and this considerably reduces the reliability of the castings produced...|$|R

In addition, the existence of double oxide <b>film</b> <b>defects,</b> which were widely recognised as {{a major factor in the}} quality and reproducibility of the properties of light-alloy castings, has been demonstrated in Mg-alloy castings. Thus it became important to understand behaviour of double oxide <b>film</b> <b>defects</b> formed in Mg-alloys. In the work reported here, three different Mg alloys (commercial pure Mg, AZ 91 alloy, and Mg-Y alloys) and two cover gases (SF 6 /air and SF 6 /CO 2), were used, in order to involve different doubled oxide films which may have different behaviours. Direct and cross-sectional observations of the double oxide <b>film</b> <b>defects</b> formed the Mg-alloy castings protected by different cover gases were obtained via a Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM), and the focus ion beam milling (FIB) technique. In addition, oxide films growing on the corresponding Mg-alloy melt surfaces were also investigated. Based on the observed film structures in conjunction with a thermochemical calculation, evolution processes of the different double oxide <b>film</b> <b>defects</b> were suggested. The quality of Mg-alloy castings was evaluated by the Weibull modulus, which is popularly used to discriminate “good” and “bad” castings. A shortcoming of the traditional Weibull estimation method (i. e. linear least square method) was demonstrated, and a new estimation method was therefore come up with.

Two off-line analysis methods were further developed and applied to the defects: polarized light imaging and interferometric imaging. Polarized light showed residual stresses in the film caused by the particle as well as properties of the embedded particle.

The vast majority of as-grown 3 C-SiC surfaces consisted of trains of single bilayer height (0. 25 nm) steps.

As supersaturation is lowered by decreasing precursor concentration, terrace nucleation on the top (111) surface becomes suppressed, sometimes enabling the formation of thin 3 C-SiC film surfaces completely free of steps. For thicker films, propagation of steps inward from mesa edges is sometimes observed, suggesting that enlarging 3 C mesa sidewall facets begin to play an increasingly important role in film growth.

40|$|In {{the ever}} {{increasingly}} interconnected world, {{the demand for}} novel data storage devices is rapidly growing. One {{of the most promising}} candidates for future non-volative memory is the redox-based resistive switching. Resistive switching describes the reversible switching between two states, with low and high resistance, upon applying an electrical bias. The typical resistive switching device consists of a transition metal oxide thin film sandwiched between two metal electrodes. Even in this rather simple geometry, there is a considerable amount of parameters determining the device performance and thus the relevance for future applications. Understanding and controlling this large field of parameters connotes a technological challenge, however, it also offers new degrees of freedom for tuning and optimizing the device performance by adjusting microscopic properties of the devices. The resistive switching in Nb:SrTiO 3 /SrTiO 3 /Pt devices, investigated in this work, depends on the oxygen vacancy motion within the SrTiO 3 thin film and the oxygen exchange at the SrTiO 3 /Pt-interface, which can be influenced by the thin <b>film</b> <b>defect</b> structure. Therefore, in this work, the contribution of the SrTiO 3 thin <b>film</b> <b>defect</b> structure and the interface configuration to the overall switching performance is identified. Utilizing these findings, the feasibility to tune certain switching parameters, especially the retention and the memory window, by tailoring the microscopic configuration of the device is shown. The SrTiO 3 thin films with adjusted Sr/Ti ratio, resulting in a tailored defect structure, are deposited by pulsed laser deposition. The beneficial influence of point and extended defects on the switching properties is shown. The best switching performance, in terms of retention and memory window, is observed for Sr-rich devices. By depositing SrO islands, which are suspected to induce antiphase boundaries, forming free devices with a high memory window are fabricated. The two aspects of the interface configuration investigated in this work are additional SrO and contaminations at the interface. This additional SrO, which is intrinsically present for Sr-rich thin films or induced during forming with high currents for stoichiometric thin films, stabilizes the retention of the low resistance state. Regardless of the defect structure and the additional SrO, the often disregarded presence of contaminations at the interface is found to be mandatory for the resistive switching in SrTiO 3 thin film devices. By introducing an artificial contamination layer of carbon at the SrTiO 3 /Pt interface, devices with a significantly increased memory window of 106 and stable retention are fabricated...|$|E
40|$|Recent {{advances}} {{in understanding the}} filling process during casting have indicated that metal flow conditions play key roles in controlling {{the quality of the}} casting. 2, 15 Inappropriate filling of castings usually cause surface oxide films to be folded into the bulk liquid or broken due to a higher liquid metal kinematic energy, resulting in so-called “entrainment damage”. These folded oxide film defects are entrained in aluminium alloy casting and significantly affect both static and fatigue reliabilities. 4 In the present study, an algorithm, Oxide Film Entrainment Tracking (OFET, 2 -D), has been developed, tested, and validated for numerical modelling of the liquid aluminium flow and movement, fold-over and entrapment of oxide films during the mould filling process of aluminium castings. The Volume of Fluid (VOF) method is employed to track the free surface of liquid metal flow. A kinematic approach has been utilised for modelling the movement and entrainment of the oxide films on the liquid metal surface. Because the oxide films on the free surface are usually very thin, the inertial forces of the films can be disregarded in comparison to other forces like gravity and pressure. The computer program based on the proposed algorithm is able to model the metal flow behaviour and oxide <b>film</b> <b>defect</b> entrainment in filling of aluminium castings...|$|E

40|$|Film {{processing}} procedures {{by means}} of Roll-to-Roll (R 2 R) for barrier coatings can often result in PV barrier films being manufactured with significant quantities of defects, which resulting in lower efficiency and a short life span. In order to improve the process yield and product efficiency it is desirable to develop an inspection system that can detect transparent barrier <b>film</b> <b>defects</b> in the production line during the film processing. Off-line detection of defect in transparent PV barrier films is difficult and time consuming.

Although consistent and repeatable hysteresis {{could possibly be}} attractive for memory based applications, it is detrimental to the deployment of graphene in high speed electronic switches. While the origin of such hysteresis has been variously attributed to graphene-insulator interface traps, adsorbed molecules and bulk charges in the dielectric, its dependence {{on the quality of}} the graphene has been largely unexplored. Since, CVD is the most promising synthesis route for large area graphene and defects in such a growth process are inevitable, it is important to understand the influence of the quality of graphene on hysteresis.

Strongly pinned vortices parallel to the c axis appear to exist in tilted low magnetic fields up to a characteristic threshold field, below which the magnetic induction within the film obeys a simple relation B=H cos.

In these methods parameters like PittingPotential (Ep) and Critical Pitting Temperature (CPT) can be measured respectively and used topredict the susceptibility of DSS to pitting corrosion.

40|$|Necessity is {{the mother}} of all inventions. With Si hitting the speed bottleneck, newer {{materials}} to replace Si are being sought out. The ex-foliation based experiments on graphene by Geim and Novoselov at this point was perfect as many of its physical properties were fascinating from an electronics standpoint and hence it was very soon projected as a Si replacement for logic applications. In addition, graphene is also an attractive alternative to applications such as radio frequency devices, ultra-sensitive mass/chemical sensing, high-speed optoelectronics and transparent conductors for photo-voltaic applications. While the widespread success and utility of Si can be attributed to easy availability of source material and the ability to synthesize large areas of ultra high quality material, chemical vapor deposition (CVD) is the only available method to controllably produce large area monolayer graphene. CVD graphene is however polycrystalline and therefore defective. Hence, in order to promote graphene towards large-scale commercialization, it is necessary to be able to grow spatially homogeneous graphene with tailored defect densities. Transfer of atomic layers of graphene from the substrate on which it is grown, a Cu foil typically, on to an insulating substrate for electrical measurements is typically a major defect inducing step. Hence, a direct transfer-free fabrication of suspended device using graphene grown on thin films of electro-deposited Cu was attempted and successfully reported for the first time. Though it was shown that the fabrication process itself did not introduce any additional defects, the maximum obtained mobility on such fabricated structures was 5200 cm 2 /V·s. This value is lower than reported values in literature and thus improvements for electronic applications warranted further optimization. However, limitations on ability of electro-deposited Cu films (melting point of 1083 ◦C) to withstand high temperatures, 1000 ◦C, impeded further optimizations. Hence, growth on Cu foils was taken up. On Cu foil, we were able to identify the roles of the growth kinetics and system thermodynamics on the final quality of graphene. Specifically, by carefully altering the conditions during appropriate growth phases, we were able to obtain graphene films of tunable defect densities with motilities ranging from 200 - 20000 cm 2 /V·s. Using a host of characterization Techniques like electrical transport, Raman spectroscopic measurements, TEM imaging and water permeation studies, we find that the defect densities in graphene are largely concentrated at the boundaries, while the bulk of the graphene grain remains pristine. Further investigations revealed a thermodynamic correlation between the growth conditions and quality of the grain boundary in terms of defect density and structure. In addition to the influence of defects in graphene on charge mobility as seen before, their impact on the device contact resistance and charge transport hysteresis in graphene field effect transistors were also investigated.

40|$|Abstract [...] Direct to Digital Holography (DDH) {{has been}} {{developed}} as a semiconductor wafer inspection tool and in particular {{as a tool for}} seeing defects in high aspect ratio (HAR) structures on semiconductor wafers and also for seeing partial-height defects. While the tool works very well for general wafer inspection, it has unusual capabilities for high aspect ratio inspection (HARI) and for detecting thin residual <b>film</b> <b>defects</b> (partial height defects). Inspection of HAR structures is rated as one of the highest unmet priorities of the member companies of International SEMATECH, and finding residual thin <b>film</b> <b>defects</b> (in some cases called “stringers”) is also a very difficult challenge. The capabilities that make DDH unusually sensitive include: 1) the capture of the whole wave [...] both the classical amplitude captured by traditional optical systems, and the phase of the wave, with phase potentially measured to ~ 1 / 1000 ’th of a wavelength or ~ 2 to 3 Angstroms for a deep ultra-violet (DUV) laser; 2) heterodyne detection—this allows it to capture very low signal levels; and 3) a head-on geometry using a collimated laser beam that allows best penetration of HAR structures. The basic features and methods of this patented technology are presented, along with simple calculations of signal strength and expected noise levels for various circumstances. Full-wave numerical calculations of electromagnetic field penetration into HAR contacts and experimental results from various wafer types and structures are also presented...|$|R
30|$|Surface {{composition}} of ALD <b>film</b> <b>defects</b> in the sterling silver knife was determined through x-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) measurements using a Kratos Axis 65 X-ray Photoelectron Spectrometer, employing a mono-chromatic Al(Kα) source with a 125  mm Omnicron (EA 125) hemispherical analyzer with a seven-channel detection capability for photoemission analysis. The charge neutralizer {{was employed to}} prevent surface charging. All peaks were calibrated to the C s peak centered at 284.6  eV. XPS surface concentrations were calculated using CasaXPS™ from the peak areas of O 1 s, Ag 3 d, Al 2 p, S 2 p and C 1 s using manufacturer supplied relative sensitivity factors.|$|R
