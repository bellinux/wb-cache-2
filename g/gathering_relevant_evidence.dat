40|$|My aim in {{this paper}} is to give a {{philosophical}} analysis of the relationship between contingently available technology and the knowledge that it makes possible. My concern is with what specific subjects can know in practice, given their particular conditions, especially available technology, rather than what can be known “in principle” by a hypothetical entity like Laplace’s Demon. The argument has two parts. In the first, I’ll construct a novel account of epistemic possibility that incorporates two pragmatic conditions: responsibility and practicability. For example, whether subjects can gain knowledge depends in some circumstances on whether they have the capability of <b>gathering</b> <b>relevant</b> <b>evidence.</b> In turn, the possibility of undertaking such investigative activities depends in part on factors like ethical constraints, economical realities, and available technology. In {{the second part of the}} paper, I’ll introduce “technological possibility” to analyze the set of actions made possible by available technology. To help motivate the problem and later test my proposal, I’ll focus on a specific historical case, one of the earliest uses of digital electronic computers in a scientific investigation. I conclude that the epistemic possibility of gaining access to scientific knowledge about certain subjects depends (in some cases) on the technological possibility for making responsible investigation...|$|E
40|$|This article, {{the third}} of an eleven part series, will offer advice and {{practical}} tips to new and existing mentors / practice teachers {{to enable them to}} develop within their role as a mentor and aid them in developing a portfolio of evidence that meets the Nursing and Midwifery Council (NMC 2008 a) Standards to Support Learning and Assessment in Practice (SSLAP). It will stress the importance of creating a good quality practice placement, furthermore it will examine the essential components that make an effective good quality practice placement all of which directly relate to the fifth domain and outcomes of the Nursing and Midwifery Councils (2008 a) SSLAP named ‘Creating an Environment for Learning’. The article essentially presents a number of suggested ways in which this domain can be achieved and how mentors can utilise these methods in order to demonstrate and gather evidence to show they have met NMC (2008 a) domain and outcomes for ‘Creating an Environment for Learning’. More importantly a number of learning activities and useful tips will be incorporated to aid prospective and existing mentors / practice teachers to undertake various self assessments in achieving this domain. This will hopefully assist mentors / practice teachers in <b>gathering</b> <b>relevant</b> <b>evidence</b> in order to demonstrate how they have met the aforementioned domain and outcomes as part of the requirement to become or maintain the NMC (2008 a) mentor / practice teacher requirements. For more in-depth information on the NMC (2008 a) SSLAP and requirements refer to part 1 of the series ‘Developing mentors to support students in practice, Part 1 : Standards to Support Learning and Assessment in Practice...|$|E
40|$|In {{a growing}} Dumber of countries, {{guidelines}} are playing {{an increasingly important}} role in assuring the quality of care. Their validity-depends on a systematic development process and explicit links between recommendations and underlying evidence. Their role in aiding clinical decision making depends on their developers identifying the key decisions and their consequences; <b>gathering</b> the <b>relevant</b> <b>evidence</b> on the risks and costs of alternative decisions; and presenting the appropriate evidence to make each key decision hi a simple and accessible format, possibly electronic Decision analysis is a potentially powerful tool for clarifying clinical decisions and involving patients directly in the process but its routine use hi guidelines is complex {{and has yet to}} be fully evaluated. Duplication of guidelines can be avoided by appraising and adapting existing guidelines hi local contexts. There is very Httfc evidence available about the Impact of guidelines on the doctor-patient relationship. They might have a potentially deleterious effect, but the combination of explicit guidelines eliciting patient preferences and Information technology might redress the balance by increasing the role of patients themselves. © 1997 Hsevier Science Ltd...|$|R
