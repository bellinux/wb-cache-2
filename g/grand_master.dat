5|$|The British monarch is Sovereign of the Order of St Patrick. The Lord Lieutenant of Ireland, the monarch's {{representative}} in Ireland, {{served as the}} <b>Grand</b> <b>Master.</b> The office of Lord Lieutenant was abolished in 1922; the last Lord Lieutenant and <b>Grand</b> <b>Master</b> was The 1st Viscount FitzAlan of Derwent. Rather oddly, the statutes of the Order did not provide that the <b>Grand</b> <b>Master</b> be admitted to the Order {{as a matter of}} right. While some Lords Lieutenant were in fact appointed to the Order, this seems to have been {{the exception rather than the}} rule.|$|E

50|$|The Lodge {{has been}} the basic local unit of the Order since its founding. Councils of Past <b>Grand</b> <b>Masters,</b> {{also known as the}} Patriarchal Order of Past <b>Grand</b> <b>Masters</b> in America, were added in 1844 and are {{composed}}, as the name suggests, by Past <b>Grand</b> <b>Masters</b> of the Order. Patriarchies, composed of Past <b>Grand</b> <b>Masters</b> who have rendered particularly valuable service to the Order, were created during a reorganization in 1873, and are modeled on a similar British adjunct.|$|R

50|$|There are now Provinces (with Provincial <b>Grand</b> <b>Masters)</b> {{under the}} <b>Grand</b> Lodge of Ireland, the National Grand Lodge of France, and the Grand Lodge of Scotland, for example. However, not all Masonic jurisdictions have Provinces or Provincial <b>Grand</b> <b>Masters.</b>|$|R

5|$|Locating the armillary {{building}} in Egypt {{with the three}} stone keys, George and Nico sneak into the building, only to see Susarro forcing Bruno to activate the armillary. As it powers up, George and Nico subdue Susarro, just before Petra arrives with a hooded man seen twice before during their adventure, who proceeds to kill Susarro with supernatural powers. The figure {{turns out to be}} the <b>Grand</b> <b>Master</b> of the Neo-Templars, thought to have been killed back in Bannockburn, but had survived, having Petra work with Susarro until he learnt what the <b>Grand</b> <b>Master</b> needed. With the armillary active and the location of a large power site displayed, the <b>Grand</b> <b>Master</b> sets off dynamite in the building as he escapes with Petra, trapping George, Nico, and Bruno inside and killing Flap. The group find the only way for them to escape is for one of them to sacrifice themselves in one of the puzzle rooms, forcing Bruno to take the responsibility, hoping to atone for past sins so that George and Nico can stop the <b>Grand</b> <b>Master.</b>|$|E

50|$|Several armorials of the 15th {{and early}} 16th century depict the {{coat of arms}} of the <b>grand</b> <b>masters.</b> These include the Chronica by Ulrich Richenthal, an armorial of St. Gallen kept in Nuremberg, an armorial of {{southwest}} Germany kept in Leipzig and the Miltenberg armorial. Conspicuously absent from these lists are three <b>grand</b> <b>masters,</b> Gerhards von Malberg (1241-1244) and his successors Heinrich von Hohenlohe (1244-1249) and Gunther von Wüllersleben (1250-1252), so that pre-modern historiographical tradition has a list of 34 <b>grand</b> <b>masters</b> for the time before 1525 (as opposed to 37 in modern accounts).|$|R
5|$|The first {{attempts}} {{to build the}} aqueduct were made by <b>Grand</b> <b>Master</b> Martin Garzez in 1596, but construction was suspended before being continued in 1610. The watercourse was inaugurated five years later on 21 April 1615. Several engineers {{took part in the}} project, including Bontadino de Bontadini, Giovanni Attard and Natale Tomasucci. The aqueduct was named after <b>Grand</b> <b>Master</b> Alof de Wignacourt, who partially financed its construction.|$|E
5|$|The {{order to}} build an {{aqueduct}} to carry water from springs in Dingli and Rabat to the capital was issued on 19 October 1596. That year, <b>Grand</b> <b>Master</b> <b>Grand</b> <b>Master</b> Martin Garzez brought in the Jesuit Padre Giacomo to design the watercourse. His design was accepted and work was begun, but construction was suspended soon afterwards due to financial reasons.|$|E
5|$|During {{the rule}} of <b>Grand</b> <b>Master</b> Perellos, the Order was {{amassing}} great wealth. The Inquisitor Delci desired to garner greater power in Malta and attempted to take hold of the Order's hospital. This hospital was a privileged place and nobody could be admitted prior to presenting their honorary crests, however the inquisition's officers infiltrated the hospital and commenced a formal inspection. These were soon ordered to leave the premises by the commanding knight of Avernes de Bocage, who was the hospital's supervisor. This news reached <b>Grand</b> <b>Master</b> Perellos, who sent his emissary, the Great Prior Marc'Antonio Zondadari, to the Court of Rome to forward complaints about the incident.|$|E

5|$|En {{route to}} Egypt, Bonaparte reached Malta on 9 June 1798, then {{controlled}} by the Knights Hospitaller. <b>Grand</b> <b>Master</b> Ferdinand von Hompesch zu Bolheim surrendered after token resistance, and Bonaparte captured an important naval base {{with the loss of}} only three men.|$|E
5|$|Soon {{after the}} Treaty of Kraków of 1525, Albrecht (Albert) of Hohenzollern planned a Polish–Lithuanian fief in Livonia, seeking a {{dominant}} position {{for his brother}} Wilhelm, the Archbishop of Riga. What happened instead was {{the establishment of a}} Livonian pro-Polish–Lithuanian party or faction. Internal fighting in Livonia took place when the <b>Grand</b> <b>Master</b> of the Brothers concluded a treaty with Moscow in 1554, declaring his state's neutrality regarding the Russian–Lithuanian conflict. Supported by Albrecht and the magnates, Sigismund II declared a war on the Order. <b>Grand</b> <b>Master</b> Wilhelm von Fürstenberg accepted the Polish–Lithuanian conditions without a fight, and according to the 1557 Treaty of Pozvol, a military alliance obliged the Livonian state to support Lithuania against Moscow.|$|E
5|$|The Castellania was {{the supreme}} court of justice of the islands, hence called Gran Corte or the {{variants}} in legal documents. The <b>Grand</b> <b>Master</b> had the absolute power to preside over the institution. The Papacy quarreled for a superior decision, such as when there was conflict with the court of the Bishop, but citing sovereignty of the princely <b>Grand</b> <b>Master</b> it was never conceded. With the presence of the Inquisition, the Holy See considered Malta similar to a colony, but through the Castellania the Order kept rigid control and sovereignty over Malta. Though the Inquisition had the power to issue a death penalty in cases related to religion, such as heresy, fornication and sodomy, it generally left it at the discretion of the Castellania. In its time, the Castellania was considered to be a secular court, and the law was amended with the issue of a Bando by the <b>Grand</b> <b>Master.</b> In military context the knights were not subject to the Castellania, and were instead prosecuted at the Military Tribunal (Tribunale Militare), however it received assistance from the higher hierarchy of the Castellania such as from the judge of the criminal court.|$|E

5|$|The Wignacourt Aqueduct was {{constructed}} between 1610 and 1615 to carry water from springs in Dingli and Rabat to the Maltese capital Valletta. It {{was named after}} Alof de Wignacourt, the <b>Grand</b> <b>Master</b> of the Order of St. John, who partially financed its construction.|$|E

5|$|Andre {{reveals that}} an idol of Baphomet has been {{discovered}} in Paris, and George gains access to the excavation. Using the chalice, he discovers {{an image of a}} church with a square tower. George returns to the Countess, and he discovers that the biblical references show a secret area inside a well containing a chessboard mural with a river running through it. Compiling their clues, George, Nicole and Andre decide that the Templars are going to Bannockburn, Scotland. George and Nicole board a train, but she and an old woman in their compartment soon go missing. He reaches the conductor's carriage, where the old woman, Khan in disguise, throws Flap out of the carriage. However, Khan is shot and killed by another man. George and Nicole reach the church {{in time to see the}} <b>Grand</b> <b>Master</b> of the Templars acquire a power from two huge Baphomet idols—the Sword of Baphomet, or the Broken Sword. After trying to tempt George to join their ranks, the <b>Grand</b> <b>Master</b> orders the couple to be killed, but they escape with the aid of explosives. The church explodes, killing Guido, the Templars and—presumably—the <b>Grand</b> <b>Master.</b> The game ends with George and Nico on their last date on the Eiffel Tower.|$|E
