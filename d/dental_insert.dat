30|$|The {{main purpose}} of the current study was to {{evaluate}} the degree of osseointegration in the <b>dental</b> implants <b>inserted</b> for a second time following the treatment of the implant surfaces with peri-implantitis therapy. Unlike other peri-implantitis therapy approaches, the approach developed in this experiment allowed all the treatment procedures to be performed outside the mouth, thereby enabling the decontamination methods to be applied easily and uniformly to all the regions of the implants in a more standardized manner than would be possible intra-orally.|$|R
50|$|In contrast, the {{superior}} alveolar nerves {{are not usually}} anesthetized directly because they are difficult to approach with a needle.

30|$|In conclusion, {{the results}} of this study {{indicated}} that there was no significant difference in the BIC percentages and the RFA measures between the implants retrieved due to peri-implantitis and re-implanted in the dog jaws and the new <b>dental</b> implants <b>inserted</b> for the first time. Moreover, the results also suggested that a dental implant retrieved due to peri-implantitis may be re-used in the same patient after decontamination of the implant surface. Nevertheless, despite the encouraging findings presented by this study, further studies including a larger number of implants are needed to substantiate the findings of our study.|$|R
30|$|Despite {{the high}} {{survival}} rate of <b>dental</b> implants <b>inserted</b> in maxillary sinuses that have undergone sinus floor elevation (SFE) with bone grafting, complications still occur [1 – 3]. Sinus membrane perforation {{is reported to}} be the most common complication [4, 5]. Postoperative maxillary sinusitis is less common (0 – 22 %) [6, 7]; nevertheless, it could potentially compromise the outcome of SFE and affect the overall well-being of the patient [8]. Developing postoperative sinusitis is often associated with a reduction in the patency or complete obstruction of the ostium due to inflammatory edema in the sinus or preexisting chronic sinusitis [8 – 12].|$|R
30|$|The {{prosthodontic}} {{rehabilitation of}} patients with atrophic maxilla is a challenge for a clinician due to the severe compromise of masticatory function and speech with a significant quality of life impact.

40|$|Background/purpose: The aim of {{the current}} in vitro study was to {{determine}} if there was a correlation between the integrals (I) of the function cutting resistance/depth, obtained using a computerized implant motor, and the bone-to-implant contact (BIC) percentages of <b>dental</b> implants <b>inserted</b> in bovine ribs. Materials and methods: Segments of bovine ribs were used, and a total of 21 perforations were performed. A total of 21 <b>dental</b> implants were <b>inserted</b> in the prepared bone sites. A computerized implant motor (“Torque Measuring Motor”) was used to assess, before implant insertion, the values of the bone cutting resistance. The data of bone density obtained by the implant motor were statistically correlated with the BIC percentages. Results: A significant positive linear correlation was found between the integrals measured by the implant motor and the BIC assessed by histomorphometry (r =  0. 78, n =  21, P <  0. 0001). Indeed, the increase of the integral values recorded by the reader matched with the increase of BIC percentages measured by histomorphometry. Pearson correlation coefficient for linear regression (R 2) between values assessed by the surgical motor and histomorphometry was 0. 61 (P <  0. 0001), indicating that 61 % of the data points were aligned with the regression line. Conclusion: The instrument under testing seems to provide a reliable quantitative estimator, the integral, of the final BIC achieved at implant insertion, and therefore of the implant primary stability, and could represent a significant aid for a proper planning of rehabilitations with the use of dental implants...|$|R

30|$|Increases or {{decreases}} of ISQ {{values are}} explained as follows: The <b>inserted</b> <b>dental</b> implant body {{is supported by}} mechanical interdigitating force after surgery, but this interdigitating force will be reduced time-dependently by the effects of osteoclasts activation at the initial stage of the bone remodeling process, then osseointegration will be completed by an increasing contact area between the bone and dental implant body at the bone regeneration step [38]. The period switch from ISQ decreasing to increasing was considered as the most unstable but important period during the healing period [24].|$|R
40|$|One of {{the most}} {{important}} factors that affect osseointegration is the primary stability of the implant. <b>Dental</b> implants <b>inserted</b> at the posterior region of the maxilla exhibit the lowest success rates as the low density bone in this area often jeopardize rigid fixation of the implant. Many surgical techniques have been developed to increase the primary stability of an implant placed in low density bone, such as bicortical fixation of the implant, undersized preparation of the implant bed and bone condensation by the use of osteotomes. A new promising technique, named osseodensification, has been recently developed that creates an autograft layer of condensed bone at the periphery of the implant bed by the aid of specially designed burs rotating in a clockwise and anti-clockwise direction. The purpose of this review is to emphasize that implant primary stability is strongly influenced by the surgical technique, to quote and briefly analyse the various surgical procedures laying weight to osseodensification procedure...|$|R
40|$|Abstract The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{evaluate}} the survival rate and the incidence of prosthetic complications of 377 implants with a double octagon connection. Furthermore the correlations among implant dimensions (diameter and length), bone quality and insertion torque were investigated. A four-year multi-center prospective clinical study was designed to evaluate the survival rate of 377 <b>dental</b> implants, <b>inserted</b> on 189 patients between January 2004 and April 2010 with an average follow-up of 46 months. The implant survival rate was 99, 7 %. The incidence of complication was 0, 53 %. Moreover insertion torque was statistically related in a significant way to the implant diameter. The connection system in exam seems to reduce the unscrewing risk of the prosthetic components. Within the limits of this study, it is observed that at the wider diameter corresponds a higher implant primary stability. The implant length instead, seems not to be critical to obtain higher primary stability...|$|R
40|$|OBJECTIVES: The {{aim of this}} {{prospective}} study was to evaluate the 5 -year performance and success rate of titanium screw-type implants with the titanium plasma spray (TPS) or the sand-blasted, large grit, acid-etched (SLA) surface inserted in a two-stage sinus floor elevation (SFE) procedure in the posterior maxilla. MATERIAL AND METHODS: A total of 59 delayed SFEs were performed in 56 patients between January 1997 and December 2001, using a composite graft with autogenous bone chips combined with deproteinized bovine bone mineral (DBBM) or synthetic porous beta-tricalcium phosphate (beta-TCP). After a healing period averaging 7. 75 months, 111 <b>dental</b> implants were <b>inserted.</b> After an additional 8 - 14 -week healing period, all implants were functionally loaded with cemented crowns or fixed partial dentures. The patients were recalled at 12 and 60 months for clinical and radiographic examination. RESULTS: One patient developed an acute infection in the right maxillary sinus after SFE and did not undergo implant therapy. Two of the 111 inserted implants {{had to be removed}} because of a developing atypical facial pain, and 11 implants were lost to follow-up and were considered drop-outs. The remaining 98 implants showed favorable clinical and radiographic findings at the 5 -year examination. The peri-implant soft tissues were stable over time; the mean probing depths and mean attachment levels did not change during the follow-up period. The measurement of the bone crest levels (DIB values) indicated stability as well. Based on strict success criteria, all 98 implants were considered successfully integrated, resulting in a 5 -year success rate of 98 % (for TPS implants 89 %, for SLA implants 100 %). CONCLUSION: This {{prospective study}} assessing the performance of <b>dental</b> implants <b>inserted</b> after SFE demonstrated that titanium implants can achieve and maintain successful tissue integration with high predictability for at least 5 years of follow-up in carefully selected patients...|$|R

However, histological evidence and comparative data are still missing. The {{aim of this study}} was an histological and histomorphometrical comparison of submerged and immediately loaded dental implants with a new modified acid etched surface inserted into postextraction sites of nonhuman primates. Thirty-two implants were placed in postextraction sockets of 4 adult Chacma Baboons (papio ursinus). Each baboon received 8 implants: 4 submerged and 4 immediately loaded. The implants were retrieved after 90 days of healing with a 4 -mm trephine bur and processed for histology and histomorphometry. The bone-to-implant contact percentage in the submerged and immediate loaded implants was 86. 02 % and 86. 85 %, respectively, with no statistically significant differences.

40|$|PURPOSE: The {{purpose of}} this article was to {{evaluate}} the suitability of deep-frozen allograft for ridge augmentation procedures in severely atrophic maxillae and to evaluate the clinical success of <b>dental</b> implants <b>inserted</b> after grafting and before prosthetic rehabilitation. PATIENTS AND METHODS: This study included 13 patients (3 men and 10 women) aged 36 to 65 years. All the patients selected for this study required bone augmentation procedures because of severe alveolar ridge atrophy and were scheduled for onlay bone allograft and titanium implants in a 2 -stage procedure. The <b>dental</b> implants were <b>inserted</b> 5 months after grafting. The follow-up period for the implants was 6 months after placement at the second stage of implant surgery. RESULTS: A total of 24 onlay block allografts were used to augment atrophic maxillae in 13 patients. Of the 24 onlay block allografts, 5 were scheduled for vertical alveolar ridge augmentation and the remaining 19 for horizontal alveolar ridge augmentation. Early exposure of the onlay bone graft was observed in 2 patients. All the block grafts showing early exposure had to be completely removed because of infection. All the observed complications were associated with onlay bone grafts placed to increase the vertical dimension of the alveolar ridges. Thirty-eight implants ranging in length from 10 to 15 mm were placed in the area of bone augmentation. All implants inserted achieved satisfactory primary stability. Two implants failed to integrate 6 months after placement during the second stage of surgery. The failed implants were successfully replaced without any need for additional bone grafting. CONCLUSIONS: The use of block allografts to treat maxillary atrophy yielded successful outcomes. Moreover, the augmentation procedure allowed the insertion of implants in the grafted area 5 months after surgery. Therefore, {{on the basis of this}} preliminary study, deep-frozen bone allograft can be considered a promising treatment for severe maxillary atrophy, with more extensive follow-up studies being needed to confirm these preliminary data...|$|R

40|$|Background: The {{extremely}} resorbed edentulous mandible, with a bone {{height of}} 8 mm or less, {{is still a}} challenge in implant dentistry. Recently, dental implants of 6 mm in length have been developed. Purpose: The purpose of this 1 -year prospective cohort study was to evaluate treatment outcome of mandibular overdentures supported by four 6 -mm dental implants. Materials and Methods: Twelve edentulous patients with a mandibular height between 6 and 8 mm participated. The patients were treated with an overdenture supported by four 6 -mm OsseoSpeed (TM) dental implants (Astra Tech AB, Molndal, Sweden). Clinical and radiographic parameters were evaluated 1 year after completion of the prosthetic treatment. Patients' satisfaction was scored before implant surgery and 1 year after prosthetic treatment. Results: One-year implant survival rate was 96 % (two implants were lost). One patient had a fracture of the mandible {{in the region of}} one of the implants 3 weeks after implant surgery. Mean scores for plaque, calculus, gingiva, bleeding, and pocket probing depth were low. Patients' satisfaction was high.

40|$|OBJECTIVES: To {{test the}} null {{hypothesis}} of {{no difference in the}} implant failure rates, postoperative infection, and marginal bone loss for the insertion of dental implants in periodontally compromised patients (PCPs) compared to the insertion in periodontally healthy patients (PHPs), against the alternative hypothesis of a difference. METHODS: An electronic search without time or language restrictions was undertaken in March 2014. Eligibility criteria included clinical human studies, either randomized or not. RESULTS: 2768 studies were identified in the search strategy and 22 studies were included. The estimates of relative effect were expressed in risk ratio (RR) and mean difference (MD) in millimetres. All studies were judged to be at high risk of bias, none were randomized. A total of 10, 927 <b>dental</b> implants were <b>inserted</b> in PCPs (587 failures; 5. 37 %), and 5881 implants in PHPs (226 failures; 3. 84 %). The difference between the patients significantly affected the implant failure rates (RR 1. 78, 95 % CI 1. 50 - 2. 11; P< 0. 00001), also observed when only the controlled clinical trials were pooled (RR 1. 97, 95 % CI 1. 38 - 2. 80; P= 0. 0002). There were significant effects of <b>dental</b> implants <b>inserted</b> in PCPs on the occurrence of postoperative infections (RR 3. 24, 95 % CI 1. 69 - 6. 21; P= 0. 0004) and in marginal bone loss (MD 0. 60, 95 % CI 0. 33 - 0. 87; P< 0. 0001) when compared to PHPs. CONCLUSIONS: The present study suggests that an increased susceptibility for periodontitis may also translate to an increased susceptibility for implant loss, loss of supporting bone, and postoperative infection. The results should be interpreted with caution due to the presence of uncontrolled confounding factors in the included studies, none of them randomized. CLINICAL SIGNIFICANCE: There is some evidence that patients treated for periodontitis may experience more implant loss and complications around implants including higher bone loss and peri-implantitis than non-periodontitis patients. As the philosophies of treatment may alter over time, a periodic review of the different concepts is necessary to refine techniques and eliminate unnecessary procedures.

40|$|International audienceThe {{long-term}} {{success of a}} dental implant {{is related to the}} properties of the bone-implant interface. It is important to follow the evolution of bone remodeling phenomena around the implant. To date, there is no satisfactory method for tracking physiological and mechanical properties of this area, and it is difficult for clinicians to qualitatively and quantitatively assess the stability of a dental implant.

In this study we perform numerical simulations, using the finite element method, of wave propagation in a <b>dental</b> implant <b>inserted</b> into bone. To simplify the calculations, an axisymmetric geometry is considered. Given the importance of monitoring of peri-prosthetic area, particular attention is given to the boundary conditions between the implant and the bone.

Materials and MethodsTwenty-one consecutive patients with one or more missing premolars or molars in the posterior mandible and with an estimated bone height of 8 mm between the top of the ridge and alveolar nerve were included. Each patient was to receive one or more 6 -mm implants (OsseoSpeed 4. 0 S, Astra Tech Implant System, Dentsply Implants, Molndal, Sweden) without any grafting. After a 3 -month osseointegration period, the implants were restored with custom-made titanium abutments (Atlantis abutment, Dentsply Implants) and cemented zirconia-based porcelain crowns. Clinical and radiographic examinations were performed at placement of the restoration and 12 months thereafter. Next to this, patients' satisfaction was scored before treatment and after 12 months with the restoration in function. ResultsImplant survival was 100 %. From loading to the 12 -month follow-up, mean marginal bone loss was 0. 14 mm (SD: 0. 4). Mean scores for plaque, calculus, gingiva, bleeding, and pocket probing depth were low.
