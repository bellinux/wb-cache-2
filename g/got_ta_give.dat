This research demonstrates utilization of PNIPAM microgel system as a template for incorporation of chiral D- and L- tartaric acids (TA). The poly(n-isopropylacrylamide) (PNIPAM) microgel was synthesized using surfactant free emulsion polymerization (SFEP) and was characterized using standard procedures. The combination of 1. 4 × 10 - 3 g/ml microgel with 3. 02 × 10 - 4 g/ml <b>TA</b> <b>gave</b> the most stable system. Subsequently, a two-phase system was obtained after centrifugation.

40|$|Abstract- Extensive {{blood loss}} in total hip surgery {{is well known}} and is {{associated}} with a high transfusion rate of allogeneic blood. The aim {{of this study is to}} assess the effects of intraoperative tranexamic acid on post-operative bleeding and need for allogeneic transfusion during hip fracture surgery. We investigated 67 patients undergoing hip fracture surgery in a prospective, randomized, double-blinded study. 32 patients received tranexamic acid (<b>TA)</b> <b>given</b> in a bolus dose of 15 mg/kg before surgical incision. The remaining, 35 patients were allocated as control group. Postoperative bleeding, transfusions, complications, and hospital stay were recorded. The intraoperative bleeding was significantly lower in the TA group (652 ± 228 ml vs. 1108 ± 372 ml, P < 0. 003). Post operative drainage was lower in TA group (296 ± 85 ml vs. 375 ± 110 ml, P < 0. 195). There were no differences in coagulation parameters. The rates of transfused patients in TA and control groups were 37 % and 57 %. In TA group, hospital stay was 4. 3 ± 1. 6 days (vs. 5. 8 ± 1. 5 days in control group; P < 0. 05).

All three PSIR sequences were performed {{as a part of}} a cardiac MRI performed on a patient clinically referred for cardiac MRI with and without contrast. A total of 28 patients were examined with the three PSIR sequences. All three PSIR sequences were performed in the short axis 10 – 25 minutes after intravenous injection of a Gadolinium-based contrast agent. Evaluation of the PSIR sequences ability to detect myocardial late gadolinium enhancement (LGE) was performed by a retrospective review by two blinded, experienced cardiovascular imagers. The review was a qualitative inspection that included grading by a 5 -point Likert scale for the sequence’s ability to resist motion artifact, image resolution, ability to visualize hyperenhancement, and overall satisfaction.

40|$|Intraoperatively administered, {{tranexamic}} acid (TA) does not reduce bleeding in total hip replacement (THR). Therefore, its prophylactic use was attempted {{in the present}} study because this {{has been shown to be}} more effective in cardiac surgery. We investigated 40 patients undergoing THR in a prospective, randomized, double-blinded study. Twenty patients received <b>TA</b> <b>given</b> in two bolus doses of 10 mg/kg each, the first just before surgical incision and the second 3 h later. In addition, a continuous infusion of TA, 1. 0 mg. kg(- 1). h(- 1) for 10 h, was given after the first bolus dose. The remaining 20 patients formed a control group. Both groups used preoperative autologous blood donation and intraoperative autotransfusion. Intraoperative bleeding was significantly less (P: = 0. 001) in the TA group compared with the control group (630 +/- 220 mL vs 850 +/- 260 mL). Postoperative drainage bleeding was correspondingly less (P: = 0. 001) (520 +/- 280 vs 920 +/- 410 mL). Up to 10 h postoperatively, plasma D-dimer concentration was halved in the TA group compared with the control group. One patient in each group had an ultrasound-verified late deep vein thrombosis. In conclusion, we found TA, administrated before surgical incision, to be efficient in reducing bleeding during THR. Implications: In a prospective, double-blinded study of 40 patients undergoing total hip replacement, the preoperative administration of {{tranexamic acid}} reduced bleeding by 35 %, probably by decreasing induced fibrinolysis. Whether tranexamic acid therapy can replace predonation of autologous blood or intraoperative autotransfusion requires further study...|$|R

40|$|There is {{a growing}} {{interest}} in the characterisation of volatile organic compounds (VOCs) in workroom air because of the potentially adverse health effects of these compounds. Volatile organic compounds have intrinsic properties as they vaporise easily and penetrate deep into the lungs were they can be transported {{to a number of}} target organs. The VOCs selected for this study were methylethylketone, methylisobutylketone, benzene, toluene, perchloroethylene, butylacetate, decane, limonene, a- and b-pinene. An investigation of the selected VOCs on the solid adsorbents Tenax TA, Chromosorb 106 and Carbotrap has been carried out regarding method optimalisation (conditioning, desorption, calibration), blanks, blank build-up, storage stability (50 ng and 500 ng at 5 ºC and 20 ºC) as a function of time, intercomparison in a field study and detection limit. The analytes were introduced into the gas chromatograph by means of thermal desorption and detection was performed by mass spectrometry. For the optimalisation of the adsorbents regarding conditioning- and desorption procedures it was established that complete desorption could be achieved for all adsorbent-adsorbate combinations. Linearity, with regression coefficient of 0. 99 or better, was established in the mass range 1 ­ 1500 ng with low relative standard deviations (RSD) in the calibration application. The blank levels and the blank build up on Carbotrap and Tenax TA have been investigated and found to be excellent with no signs of artefact development over time. Chromosorb 106, however, contains inherently more artefacts that build up over time. The stability of the analytes on the adsorbents over time was investigated and it was found that Chromosorb 106 gave the overall best results with recoveries of 90 % or better for all analytes. Tenax <b>TA</b> and Carbotrap <b>gave</b> lower recoveries and were more influenced by variations in time, temperature and concentration. Refrigerated temperatures are best avoided for storage on Tenax TA but may increase the recovery of some compounds (e. g. butylacetate) on Carbotrap. A system for comparing solid adsorbents in a diffusive sampling mode was constructed for field-sampling. Active charcoal sampling with solvent desorption was used as a reference method. The atmospheric concentrations of a-, b-pinene and limonene in an insect repellent production facility were investigated and relative good agreement between the adsorbents and the charcoal samples were found. Chromosorb 106 gave somewhat higher results compared to Tenax <b>TA,</b> while Carbotrap <b>gave</b> the lowest results. Tenax <b>TA</b> <b>gave</b> results that were most consistent to those found on charcoal. The limits of detection (LOD) and quantification (LOQ) of the analytical system were determined for the selected analytes, and rang from 0. 01 - 0. 05 ng and from 0. 03 - 0. 15 ng respectively. This equals a LOD and LOQ for 8 hours diffusive sampling of approximately 0. 03 - 0. 35 µg m- 3 and 0. 09 - 0. 69 µg m- 3 respectively, for all adsorbents.

A mixed- methods approach to data collection involved a focus group of 12 TAs, and structured classroom observations followed by semi-structured interviews of 7 TAs. This allowed the researcher to discuss what was observed as well as discover their views on their and other TAs’ practise. Varying degrees of mediation were observed: scaffolding, acceptance but challenging pupil’s response, bridging, exploring systematic thinking, and using process oriented questions. Very rarely did <b>TAs</b> <b>give</b> answers to problems in isolation. TAs often were responsible for supporting students in regulating their behaviour, and indicated that their focus was not solely on students academic attainment but more so on their emotional and social development as well.
