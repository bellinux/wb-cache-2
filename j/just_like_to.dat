[...] Bob McCann, author of Encyclopedia of African American actresses in film and television (2010), considered it [...] "simply one of the most haunting R records ever made", while Robert Christgau named it [...] "miraculous" [...] and explained [...] "the miracle being that it's by Diane Warren and you want to hear it again." [...] About.com reviewer Mark Edward Nero named it one of the best R break-up songs and considered it Braxton's [...] "finest moment". He further commented, [...] "damn, this song is so sad it can make people cry for hours at a time."

The service began with a chorus of the hymn [...] "Jerusalem" [...] sung in Engrish with a mock Chinese accent. Cleese delivered a memorable eulogy to Chapman with a shock humour that he believed Chapman would have appreciated, and later became the first person at a televised British {{memorial service}} to say [...] "fuck". Palin also delivered a eulogy to Chapman, as did Idle, quipping that Chapman had decided to die rather than listen to Palin once again. Idle also led the other surviving Pythons and Chapman's close friends and family in a rendition of the song [...] "Always Look on the Bright Side of Life" [...] from The Life of Brian. Idle closed his remarks by saying: [...] "I'd <b>just</b> <b>like</b> <b>to</b> be the last person at this meeting to say 'fuck'." ...|$|E
500|$|Conversely, Spins March Hogan wrote, [...] "'Some of us <b>just</b> <b>like</b> <b>to</b> read', she sings, and hey, that {{includes}} us. But it's easier to clap {{for something that}} moves or touches you, rather than serves as an advertisement for Gaga as incomprehensible high-end brand." [...] Consequence of Sound wrote in their review, [...] "Gaga's head appears on a black swan and she boogies down in a clam bikini. If this doesn't bump up her sales, I no longer believe in art." [...] Hilary Hughes of Esquire said that the video [...] "hits all the marks of Gaga-esque eccentricity: glitter, boob grabs, weird animals, space, severed limbs, devotional imagery, nudity, neon, etc. It just doesn't redefine those marks, as previous music videos of Gaga's— namely [...] "Bad Romance," [...] "Paparazzi" [...] and [...] "Judas"— have". Spencer Kornhaber of The Atlantic believed that Gaga was parodying herself with the video and suggested that her aim was [...] "to make a video both celebrating and poking fun at her career thus far." [...] However, he considered it forgettable when compared to Gaga's previous efforts.|$|E

[...] After the party is over, Pam runs to the camera and screams [...] "I would <b>just</b> <b>like</b> <b>to</b> say that this was the best Dundies ever! Whoo!". In the parking lot, Pam admits to Jim that it was she who wrote the graffiti. She begins to ask Jim a question, but stops when she notices the camera. A Chili's employee then talks to the camera and says that Pam apparently was sneaking drinks off of others' tables, which is against the restaurant's rules. [...] He then tells the audience that he Xeroxed her driver's license and she is never welcome at Chili's again. Jim helps Pam into Angela Martin's (Angela Kinsey) car and smiles as they leave.|$|E

[...] In Fall 2008 Mullen left the church, joining a group of Chanology protesters across the street.

When she started recording her sixth studio album Circus (2008), she contacted Morier to write songs with her. When the two were in the studio, they asked Kurstin to give them tracks.

500|$|Similar {{to other}} artists that the {{director}} have worked with, Rolston usually brought his team of professionals along to the shooting, including make-up artist, wardrobe-hair stylist, dancers and choreographer. However, Rolston and his team turned out to cause a few creative conflicts with the group during production. One of them came from the original routine conducted by Watkins, {{the person who was}} in fact choreographed most of the group's early videos. She remembered Rolston's camp's choreographer Frank Gatson Jr. [...] "locked" [...] the girls out from providing ideas as they were practicing the new dance moves. The trio eventually dropped his choreograph because they thought his version wasn't their [...] "style of dancing." [...] But still, two of his moves were adapted in the final clip. [...] "To me, I didn't even think about, 'Well, can I really choreograph?' I was just like, 'Let me do my thing.' I <b>just</b> <b>like</b> <b>to</b> dance and I know when I like what I see. I like different kinds of stuff," [...] Watkins shared.

500|$|Mark Washburn of Knight Ridder {{wrote that}} at the time of the episode's broadcast, most Americans were {{accustomed}} to seeing homosexual characters on television. He said this is why Patty's coming-out did not become as controversial as the episode's examination of the same-sex marriage issue, which was more sensitive in the country then. The controversy became so big that local news programs in certain cities aired segments about it. In response to the claims that this episode was supporting gay marriage, Al Jean replied that [...] "we don't really take any positions for or against anything, we <b>just</b> <b>like</b> <b>to</b> examine all sides of an issue and I think that anyone who would get their political wisdom from a cartoon might be sadly mistaken." [...] Likewise, Mark Pinsky writes in The Gospel According to The Simpsons that once the episode ended, it was hard to tell what stance on same-sex marriage the writers had and that [...] "both sides of the controversy had their say, voiced by various Simpsons characters". Jean has also cited the episode in defense to critics who say The Simpsons has lost its relevance and edginess in later years. In his book , John Ortved responded to this, commenting that despite the controversies the episode was [...] "in fact a long-winded and lame exploration of the topic." ...|$|E
