5000|$|Agribusiness is also {{changing}} {{the rules of the}} organic market. The rise of organic farming was driven by small, independent producers and by consumers. In recent years, <b>explosive</b> <b>organic</b> market growth has encouraged the participation of agribusiness interests. As the volume and variety of [...] "organic" [...] products increases, the viability of the small-scale organic farm is at risk, and the meaning of organic farming as an agricultural method is ever more easily confused with the related but separate areas of organic food and organic certification.|$|R
5000|$|Hexamethylene triperoxide diamine (HMTD) is a [...] high <b>explosive</b> <b>organic</b> compound. The theorized {{structure}} lent itself well {{to acting}} as an initiating, or primary explosive. While still quite sensitive to shock and friction, it was relatively stable {{compared to other}} initiating explosives of the time, such as mercury fulminate, and proved to be relatively inexpensive and easy to synthesise. As such, it was quickly taken up as a primary explosive in mining applications. However, it has since been superseded by even more stable compounds such as tetryl.|$|R

50|$|Organic {{peroxides}} are {{organic compounds}} containing the peroxide functional group (ROOR′). If the R′ is hydrogen, the compounds are called organic hydroperoxides. Peresters have general structure RC(O)OOR. The O−O bond easily breaks, producing free radicals {{of the form}} RO•. Thus, organic peroxides are useful as initiators for some types of polymerisation, such as the epoxy resins used in glass-reinforced plastics. MEKP and benzoyl peroxide are commonly used for this purpose. However, the same property also means that organic peroxides can either intentionally or unintentionally initiate explosive polymerisation in materials with unsaturated chemical bonds, and this process {{has been used in}} <b>explosives.</b> <b>Organic</b> peroxides, like their inorganic counterparts, are powerful bleaching agents.|$|R
40|$|New {{techniques}} {{for the field}} detection of inorganic improvised explosive devices (IEDs) are urgently developed. Although ion mobility spectrometry (IMS) has been {{proved to be the}} most effective method for screening <b>organic</b> <b>explosives,</b> it still faces a major challenge to detect inorganic explosives owing to their low volatilities. Herein, we proposed a strategy for detecting trace inorganic explosives by thermal desorption ion mobility spectrometry (TD-IMS) with sample-to-sample analysis time less than 5 s based on in-situ acidification on the sampling swabs. The responses for typical oxidizers in inorganic explosives, such as KNO 3, KClO 3 and KClO 4 were at least enhanced by a factor of 3000 and their limits of detection were found to be subnanogram. The common <b>organic</b> <b>explosives</b> and their mixtures with inorganic oxidizers were detected, indicating that the acidification process did not affect the detection of <b>organic</b> <b>explosives.</b> Moreover, the typical inorganic explosives such as black powders, firecrackers and match head could be sensitively detected as well. These results demonstrated that this method could be easily employed in the current deployed IMS for on-site sensitive detection of either inorganic <b>explosives</b> or <b>organic</b> ones...|$|R
40|$|Abstract Multi-component {{reactions}} {{are a very}} elegant and rapid way to access highly functional molecules from simple building blocks in drug lead synthesis. Multi-component one-pot reactions generally afford good yields which is important in combinatorial synthesis. Over the past decade, several sequential multi-component reactions have been developed into multi-component one-pot reactions. Since multi-component one-pot reactions results in a reduced number of operations, they usually allows direct transformation of intermediates to desired products by avoiding isolation, handling and chromatography. Hence, better yields are usually achieved. In this study 1, 4 -disubstituted 1, 2, 3 -triazoles were obtained by a high-yielding copper (I) catalyzed 1, 3 -dipolar cycloaddition reaction between in situ generated azides and terminal acetylenes. This one-pot, two-step procedure tolerated most functional groups and circumvented {{the problems associated with}} the isolation of potentially toxic and <b>explosive</b> <b>organic</b> azides. All of these factors are important in combinatorial synthesis of drug lead compounds...|$|R

40|$|A {{group of}} organic chromophoric {{molecules}} including siloles, pyrans, tetraphenylethylenes and fulvenes, are designed and synthesized. Light emissions of conventional luminescent materials are often quenched by aggregate formation. These molecules, however, become stronger luminophors when aggregated {{although they are}} practically nonemissive in their dilute solutions. By varying their packing structures in the aggregation states, emission color ranging from blue to red can be achieved. The emission of fulvenes can also be controlled by changing their morphology. While they emit a faint light in the amorphous state, their crystal forms are strongly luminescent. Intermolecular interaction or restriction of intramolecular rotation in different states {{may be responsible for}} such behaviors. Thanks to such effects, the molecules can be employed as sensors for the detection of <b>explosives,</b> <b>organic</b> solvent vapors, solution pH, and biomacromolecules. Further modification of their structures by molecular engineering endeavors may generate materials that can find an array of applications in optical display systems and as biological probes...|$|R
40|$|The {{detection}} and characterization of energetic materials at distances up to 45 m using stand-off laser induced breakdown spectroscopy (LIBS) has been demonstrated. A field-portable open-path LIB spectrometer working under a coaxial configuration was used. A preliminary study allowed choosing a single-pulse laser source over a double-pulse system {{as the most}} suitable source for the stand-off analysis of organic samples. The C 2 Swan system, {{as well as the}} hydrogen, oxygen and nitrogen emission intensity ratios were the necessary parameters to identify the analyte as an <b>organic</b> <b>explosive,</b> <b>organic</b> non-explosive and non-organic samples. O/N intensity ratios of 2. 9 and 2. 16 with relative standard deviations of 4. 03 % and 8. 36 % were obtained for 2, 4 -dinitrotoluene and aluminium samples, respectively. A field test with known samples and a blind test were carried out at a distance of 30 m from the sample. Identification of energetic compounds in such conditions resulted in 19 correct results out of 21 samples...|$|R

Readily combustible solids are powdered, granular, or pasty substances which are dangerous if they can be easily ignited by brief contact with an ignition source, such as a burning match, and if the flame spreads rapidly. it is further divided into • {{flammable solid}}s, • polymerizing substances and • self-reactive substances, i.e., thermally unstable solids liable to undergo a strongly exothermic thermal decomposition even without participation of oxygen (air) other than materials classified as <b>explosive,</b> <b>organic</b> peroxides or as oxidizing.Spontaneously combusting solids or pyrophoric solids are solids that, even in small quantities, are liable to ignite within five minutes after coming into contact with air. Substances and mixtures of this hazard class are assigned to a single hazard category {{on the basis of the}} outcome of the UN Test N.2. Self-heating substances are solids or liquids, other than a pyrophoric substance, which, by reaction with air and without energy supply, are liable to self-heat. Substances and mixtures of this hazard class are assigned to one of two hazard categories on the basis of the outcome of the UN Test N.4. Substances which on contact with water emit flammable gases are liable to become spontaneously flammable or to give off flammable gases in dangerous quantities. Substances and mixtures of this hazard class are assigned to one of three hazard categories on the basis of the outcome of UN Test N.5, which measures gas evolution and speed of evolution. Flammable aerosols can be classified as Class 1 or Class 2 if they contain any component, which is classified as flammable.|$|R

40|$|Manuscripts 1 and 2 of this {{dissertation}} both {{involve the}} pre-blast detection of trace explosive material. The first manuscript explores {{the analysis of}} human hair {{as an indicator of}} exposure to explosives. Field analysis of hair for trace explosives is quick and non-invasive, and could prove to be a powerful linkage to physical evidence in the form of bulk explosive material. Individuals tested were involved in studies which required handling or close proximity to bulk high explosives such as TNT, PETN, and RDX. The second manuscript reports the results of research in the design and application of canine training aids for non-traditional, peroxide-based <b>explosives.</b> <b>Organic</b> peroxides such as triacetonetriperoxide (TATP) and hexamethylenetriperoxidediamine (HMTD) can be synthesized relatively easily with store-bought ingredients and have become popular improvised explosives with many terrorist groups. Due to the hazards of handling such sensitive compounds, this research established methods for preparing training aids which contained safe quantities of TATP and HMTD for use in imprinting canines with their characteristic odor. ^ Manuscripts 3 and 4 of this dissertation focus on research conducted to characterize pipe bombs during and after an explosion (post-blast). Pipe bombs represent a large percentage of domestic devices encountered by law enforcement. The current project has involved the preparation and controlled explosion of over 90 pipe bombs of different configurations in order to obtain data on fragmentation patterns, fragment velocity, blast overpressure, and fragmentation distance. Physical data recorded from the collected fragments, such as mass, size, and thickness, was correlated with the relative power of the initial device. Manuscript 4 explores the microstructural analysis of select pipe bomb fragments. Shock-loading of the pipe steel led to plastic deformation and work hardening in the steel grain structure as evidenced by optical microscopy and microhardness testing respectively. ...|$|R
50|$|An {{explosion}} {{is a type}} {{of spontaneous}} chemical reaction that, once initiated, is driven by both a large exothermic change (great release of heat) and a large positive entropy change (great quantities of gases are released) in going from reactants to products, thereby constituting a thermodynamically favorable process in addition to one that propagates very rapidly. Thus, explosives are substances that contain a large amount of energy stored in chemical bonds. The energetic stability of the gaseous products and hence their generation comes from the formation of strongly bonded species like carbon monoxide, carbon dioxide, and (di)nitrogen, which contain strong double and triple bonds having bond strengths of nearly 1 MJ/mole. Consequently, most commercial <b>explosives</b> are <b>organic</b> compounds containing -NO2, -ONO2 and -NHNO2 groups that, when detonated, release gases like the aforementioned (e.g., nitroglycerin, TNT, HMX, PETN, nitrocellulose).|$|R
