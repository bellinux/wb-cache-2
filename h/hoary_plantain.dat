50|$|Plantago media, {{known as}} the <b>hoary</b> <b>plantain,</b> is a species of {{flowering}} plant in the plantain family Plantaginaceae. It is native to central and western Europe, including Great Britain and introduced to parts of the north-east United States.

50|$|The site {{consists}} of unimproved species-rich chalk grassland {{on the edge}} of Salisbury Plain, parts of it with over forty plant species per square metre, and supports some uncommon butterflies. Its slopes of the Lower Chalk mostly face south-west, and there are two combes. The sward is notable for upright brome (Bromus erectus) and sheep’s fescue (Festuca ovina). Other plants include quaking grass! crested hair-grass, Bird’s-foot-trefoil, dwarf thistle, small scabious (Scabiosa columbaria) and <b>hoary</b> <b>plantain</b> (Plantago media).|$|E

5000|$|The site {{is thought}} to be the last {{remaining}} example of a Thames valley hay meadow in Surrey. It contains a range of lime-loving (calcicole) plants which are characteristic of this type of meadow. The grassland is dominated by rough-stalked meadow grass Poa trivialis, crested dog’s-tail grass Cynosurus cristatus, and lesser knapweed Centaurea nigra. Yellow rattle Rhinanthus minor, meadow-fescue grass Festuca pratensis, meadow barley Hordeum secalinum, smooth hawk’s-beard Crepis capillaris and common reed Phragmites australis are locally abundant, the last species being unusual in such dry situations. Other frequent species include meadow brome Bromus commutatus, a grass only recorded from one other Surrey location in recent years, meadow foxtail grass Alopecurus pratensis, Yorkshire-fog grass Holcus lanatus, pepper saxifrage Silaum silaus and meadow-sweet Filipendula ulmaria. Associated calcicole species include meadow cranesbill Geranium pratense, clustered bell-flower Campanula glomerata, cowslip Primula veris, <b>hoary</b> <b>plantain</b> Plantago media, salad burnet Sanguisorba minor and lady’s bedstraw Galium verum.The meadow is surrounded by old hedgerows with a variety of species such as ash Fraxinus excelsior, hawthorn Crataegus monogyna, field maple Acer campestre, spindle Euonymus europaeus, dogwood Cornus sanguinea, and buckthorn Rhamnus catharticus. A drainage ditch along two sides of the site supports five species of willow including purple willow Salix purpurea and almond willow Salix triandra. Common comfrey Symphytum officinale, ragged robin Lychnis flos-cuculi, cyperus sedge Carex pseudocyperus and the uncommon aquatic liverwort Riccia fluitans...along this ditch.

40|$|Contrasting {{effects on}} the stomatal index (SI), stomatal density, {{epidermal}} cell size and number were observed in four chalk grassland herbs (Sanguisorba minor Scop., Lotus corniculatus L., Anthyllis vulneraria L. and Plantago media L.) following exposure to elevated carbon dioxide concentrations (CO 2) in controlled environment growth cabinets. SI of S. minor increased for both leaf surfaces, whilst in A. vulneraria and P. media SI decreased on one surface only. In L. corniculatus, no differences in SI were observed as epidermal cell density changed in parallel with stomatal density. In L. corniculatus and S. minor stomatal density increased on both surfaces, whereas in P. media it decreased; in A. vulneraria stomatal density decreased on the abaxial leaf surface alone following exposure to elevated CO 2. In the latter three species, SI changed because stomatal density did not change in parallel with epidermal cell density. The results suggest elevated CO 2 is {{either directly or indirectly}} affecting cell differentiation and thus stomatal initiation in the meristem. In S. minor and P. media leaf growth increased in elevated CO 2, because of increased cell expansion of epidermal cells, whereas in L. corniculatus, epidermal cell size decreased and greater leaf growth was because of an increase in epidermal cell divisions. In A. vulneraria, leaf size did not change, but increased cell expansion on the adaxial surface suggests CO 2 affects leaf surfaces differently, either directly or indirectly at the cell differentiation stage or as the leaf grows. These results suggest component species of a plant community may differ in their response to elevated CO 2. Predicting the effect of environmental change is therefore difficult.

40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to {{investigate}} the impact of ambient (345 ?l l? 1) and elevated (590 ?l l? 1) CO 2 on the root and shoot growth of four native chalk grassland herbs: Sanguisorba minor Scop, (salad burnet), Lotus carniculatus L. (birdsfoot trefoil), Anthyllis vulneraria L. (kidney vetch) and Plantago media L. (<b>hoary</b> <b>plantain).</b> Elevated CO 2 had contrasting effects on both shoot and root growth of the four species studied. Both leaf expansion and production were stimulated by elevated CO 2 for S. minor, L. corniculatus and P. media, whilst for A. vulneraria, only leaflet shape appeared to be altered by elevated CO 2, with the production of broader leaflets, compared with those produced in ambient CO 2. After 100 d shoot biomass was enhanced in elevated CO 2 for S. minor and L. corniculatus, whilst there was no effect of elevated CO 2 on shoot biomass for A. vulneraria or P. media. Contrasting effects of CO 2 were also apparent for measurements of specific leaf area (SLA), which increased for L. corniculatus, decreased for A. vulneraria and remained unaltered for S. minor and P. media in elevated compared with ambient CO 2. Elevated CO 2 also had contrasting effects on both the growth and morphology of roots. The accumulation of root biomass was stimulated following exposure to elevated CO 2 for S. minor and L. corniculatus whilst there was no effect on root biomass for A. vulneraria or P. media. Root length was measured on three occasions during the 100 d and revealed that exposure to elevated CO 2 promoted root extension in S. minor, L. corniculatus and P. media, but not in A. vulneraria. Specific root length (SRL, length per unit dry weight) was increased in elevated CO 2 for one species, P. media, whilst the root to shoot ratio of all four species remained unchanged by CO 2. These results show that four native herbs differ in their response to CO 2, suggesting that the structure of this plant community may be altered in the future...|$|E
