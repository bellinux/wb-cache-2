40|$|This paper {{presents}} a route guidance system for car owners {{to find their}} cars in parking garages. The presents system comprises a positioning-assisting subsystem and a car-finding mobile app. The positioning-assisting subsystem mainly uses the iBeacon technology for indoor positioning. The car-finding mobile app <b>guides</b> <b>car</b> owners to their cars based on a non-map navigation strategy. This study also designs a virtual coordinate system to support identifying the locations of parking spaces and iBeacon devices. We use Arduino and Android as the platforms to implement the proposed positioning-assisting subsystem and car-finding mobile app, respectively. We have also deployed the system in a parking garage in our campus for testing. Experimental results verify that our system can efficiently and correctly <b>guide</b> <b>car</b> owners to the parking spaces of their cars...|$|R

40|$|With {{the rapid}} {{development}} of China’s {{economy and the}} rise of Chinese living standards, Chinese demand for private car ownership is increasing significantly. China is already the world’s largest automobile market and is coveted by many giant automotive enterprises. However it is extremely difficult to cater to China’s automobile market demands because of particular Chinese conditions such as the unique culture, the diverse requirements of a geographically dispersed population, fastidious consumers and crowded traffic. The problem is that there is very limited literature in this area to <b>guide</b> <b>car</b> designers when designing a car for the Chinese market. This research examines the special demands of private cars for Chinese consumers, identifies particular elements of vehicle design that are important for successful Chinese marketing, and incorporates them into a new computer-generated 3 D model...|$|R
