We classify localising and colocalising subcategories, and give characterisations of small, dualisable, and K(n) -nilpotent spectra. We give a number of useful extensions to the theory of vn self maps of finite spectra, and to the theory of Landweber exactness. We show that certain rings of cohomology operations are left Noetherian, and deduce some powerful finiteness results. We study the Picard group of invertible K(n) -local spectra, and the problem of grading homotopy groups over it. We prove (as announced by Hopkins and Gross) that the Brown-Comenetz dual of MnS lies in the Picard group. We give a detailed analysis of some examples when n = 1 or 2, and a list of open problems...|$|E

40|$|Abstract. Let G be {{a finite}} group. We use {{the results of}} [5] {{to show that the}} Tate {{homology}} of <b>E(n)</b> <b>local</b> spectra with respect to G produces E(n − 1) local spectra. We also show that the Bousfield class of the Tate homology of LnX (for X finite) is {{the same as that of}} Ln− 1 X. To be precise, recall that Tate homology is a functor from G-spectra to G-spectra. To produce a functor PG from spectra to spectra, we look at a spectrum as a naive G-spectrum on which G acts trivially, apply Tate homology, and take G-fixed points. This composite is the functor we shall actually study, and we’ll prove that 〈PG(LnX) 〉 = 〈Ln− 1 X 〉 when X is finite. When G = Σp, the symmetric group on p letters, this is related to a conjecture of Hopkins and Mahowald (usually framed in terms of Mahowald’s functor RP−∞(−)). 1...|$|E

40|$|In {{north-east}} Brazil, Archean and Paleoproterozoic cratonic blocks are enclosed {{within a}} network of Brasiliano-age (07 – 055 Ga) metasedimentary foldbelts. The unfoliated Coronel João Sa ́ grano-diorite pluton, which contains magmatic epidote and strongly resorbed clinopyroxene, intrudes the Sergipano Foldbelt. Zircons yield a concordant U–Pb crystallization age of 625 2 Ma; titanite ages are approximately 621 Ma. Discordant zircons suggest inheritance from at least two magma sources of ages 22 Ga. Model calculations based on diffusion parameters and Rb–Sr isotope data from separated minerals indicate that the pluton cooled {{at a rate of}} 36 C/Myr. Whole-rock element compositions and initial Sr–Nd isotopic compositions that are heterogeneous on all length scales suggest magma mixing. Trace-element concentrations and Nd isotope data argue against a contribution from a contem-poraneous mantle-derived magma. Values of magmatic eNd (at 625 Ma) resemble contemporary <b>eNd</b> for <b>local</b> supracrustal rocks and basement, compatible with anatexis of a crustal source.
