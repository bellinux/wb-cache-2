5000|$|Before the Law of Property Act 1925, a {{freehold}} estate transferable to the owner's [...] "heirs and assigns" [...] (that is, successors by inheritance, or purchase gift, respectively), was a fee simple estate. When transfer, by inheritance or otherwise, {{was limited to}} lineal descendants ("heirs of the body" [...] or [...] "heirs of the blood") of {{the first person to}} whom the estate was given, it was a fee tail estate. There were also <b>freehold</b> estates not <b>of</b> <b>inheritance,</b> such as an estate for life.|$|R
50|$|In law, a {{base fee}} is a <b>freehold</b> estate <b>of</b> <b>inheritance</b> which is limited or {{qualified}} by {{the existence of}} certain conditions. In modern property law the commonest example of a base fee is an estate created by a tenant in tail, not in possession, who bars the entail {{without the consent of}} the protector of the settlement. Any attempt to bar the entail without the consent of the Protector would only be partially successful. Though he bars his own issue (the rights of the future tenants in tail), he cannot bar any remainder or reversion, and the estate (i.e. the base fee) thus created is determinable on the failure of his issue in tail. The base fee can be defined as rights that would last {{for as long as the}} fee tail would have lasted, but which will end when the line of descent stipulated in the fee tail ran out.|$|R
