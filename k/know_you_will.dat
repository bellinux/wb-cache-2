500|$|After the 2007 playoffs saw two wild-card {{teams with}} better records (Jacksonville Jaguars and {{eventual}} Super Bowl XLII champions New York Giants) {{go on the}} road to defeat division winners (Pittsburgh Steelers and Tampa Bay Buccaneers, respectively) during wild-card weekend, the NFL explored another proposal to change the playoffs so that the team with the better record would host the game, even if that meant a division winner went on the road. The NFL's Competition Committee withdrew the request later that offseason, with Atlanta Falcons president Rich McKay mentioning that they wanted the idea to simply get a discussion going. New England Patriots owner Robert Kraft was a strong opponent of the rule change, believing that [...] "if you win a division, it's good for your fans to <b>know</b> <b>you</b> <b>will</b> have a home game." ...|$|E

2500|$|When Roosevelt {{addressed}} the Congress in person on March 1, 1945, {{about a month}} before his death, he made public reference to his disability for almost {{the first time in}} 20 years. [...] "I hope that you will pardon me for this unusual posture of sitting down," [...] Roosevelt began, [...] "but I <b>know</b> <b>you</b> <b>will</b> realize that it makes it a lot easier for me not to have to carry about ten pounds of steel around on the bottom of my legs." ...|$|E

[...] "The band has made a creative decision to revert back to a three piece, as they originally started.

2500|$|CBS and Warner Bros. {{terminated}} Sheen's {{contract on}} March 7, 2011. He {{was replaced by}} Ashton Kutcher. In the aftermath of his dismissal, Sheen remained vocally critical of Chuck Lorre, and filed a wrongful termination lawsuit against Lorre and Warner Bros., which was settled the following September 26. That same month, Sheen, while presenting an award at the Primetime Emmy Awards, addressed [...] "everybody here from Two and a Half Men" [...] and stated, [...] "From {{the bottom of my}} heart, I wish you nothing but the best for this upcoming season. We spent eight wonderful years together and I <b>know</b> <b>you</b> <b>will</b> continue to make great television." [...] In 2012, Sheen returned to television in Anger Management, the spin-off of the movie of the same name.|$|E
2500|$|In 1917, it {{was decided}} to re-establish the liberal arts college, and on June 14, 1918, the Eastern Nazarene College was {{chartered}} with degree-granting authority in the state of Rhode Island, while secondary education would remain as the Eastern Nazarene Academy. Choosing a new name, however, would be difficult: the school was now a liberal arts college and a Nazarene institution. Candidates included: [...] "Northeastern Nazarene College", [...] "Bresee Memorial College", [...] "Nazarene College of the Northeast", and [...] "Nazarene College and Bresee Theological Institute". General Superintendent John W. Goodwin can be credited with the chosen name, as he wrote to Hiram F. Reynolds, also a general superintendent and a long-time supporter of the school: [...] "I <b>know</b> <b>you</b> <b>will</b> do your best for our New England College. I should be glad if they would change the name to the Eastern Nazarene College, or something like that. It would seem we must have a school there, although it moves along hard and slow." ...|$|E
2500|$|Failures in {{both the}} East and the West began a tide of events that was to {{overwhelm}} Asquith's Liberal Government. Strategic setbacks combined with a shattering personal blow when, on 12 May 1915, Venetia Stanley announced her engagement to Edwin Montagu. Asquith's reply was immediate and brief, [...] "As you know well, this breaks my heart. I couldn't bear {{to come and see}} you. I can only pray God to bless you—and help me." [...] Venetia's importance to him is illustrated by a letter written in mid-1914; [...] "Keep close to me beloved in this most critical time of my life. I <b>know</b> <b>you</b> <b>will</b> not fail." [...] Her engagement; [...] "a very treacherous return after all the joy you've given me", left him devastated. Significant though the loss was personally, its impact on Asquith politically can be overstated. The historian Stephen Koss notes that Asquith [...] "was always able to divide his public and private lives into separate compartments (and) soon found new confidantes to whom he was writing with no less frequency, ardour and indiscretion." ...|$|E
