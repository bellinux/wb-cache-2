40|$|Objectives: To improve ethanolic {{fermentation}} {{performance of}} self-flocculating yeast, {{difference between a}} <b>flocculating</b> <b>yeast</b> strain and a regular industrial yeast strain was analyzed by transcriptional and metabolic approaches. Results: The number of down-regulated (industrial yeast YIC 10 vs. <b>flocculating</b> <b>yeast</b> GIM 2. 71) and up-regulated genes were 4503 and 228, respectively. It is the economic regulation for YIC 10 that non-essential genes were down-regulated, and cells put more "energy" into growth and ethanol production. Hexose transport and phosphorylation were not the limiting-steps in ethanol fermentation for GIM 2. 71 compared to YIC 10, whereas the reaction of 1, 3 -disphosphoglycerate to 3 -phosphoglycerate, the decarboxylation of pyruvate to acetaldehyde and its subsequent reduction to ethanol were the most limiting steps. GIM 2. 71 had stronger stress response than non-flocculating yeast and much more carbohydrate was distributed to other bypass, such as glycerol, acetate and trehalose synthesis. Conclusions: Differences between <b>flocculating</b> <b>yeast</b> and regular industrial yeast in transcription and metabolite profiling will provide clues for improving the fermentation performance of GIM 2. 71.

40|$|Abstract Background Very high gravity (VHG) {{fermentation}} using {{medium in}} excess of 250 g/L sugars for more than 15 % (v) ethanol can save energy consumption, not only for ethanol distillation, but also for distillage treatment; however, stuck fermentation with prolonged fermentation time and more sugars unfermented is the biggest challenge. Controlling redox potential (ORP) during VHG fermentation benefits biomass accumulation and improvement of yeast cell viability that is affected by osmotic pressure and ethanol inhibition, enhancing ethanol productivity and yield, the most important techno-economic aspect of fuel ethanol production. Results Batch fermentation was performed under different ORP conditions using the <b>flocculating</b> <b>yeast</b> and media containing glucose of 201 [*]±[*] 3. 1, 252 [*]±[*] 2. 9 and 298 [*]±[*] 3. 8 g/L. Compared with ethanol fermentation by non-flocculating yeast, different ORP profiles were observed with the <b>flocculating</b> <b>yeast</b> due to the morphological change associated with the flocculation of yeast cells. When ORP was controlled at − 100 mV, ethanol fermentation with the high gravity (HG) media containing glucose of 201 [*]±[*] 3. 1 and 252 [*]±[*] 2. 9 g/L was completed at 32 and 56 h, respectively, producing 93. 0 [*]±[*] 1. 3 and 120. 0 [*]±[*] 1. 8 g/L ethanol, correspondingly. In contrast, there were 24. 0 [*]±[*] 0. 4 and 17. 0 [*]±[*] 0. 3 g/L glucose remained unfermented without ORP control. As high as 131. 0 [*]±[*] 1. 8 g/L ethanol was produced at 72 h when ORP was controlled at − 150 mV for the VHG fermentation with medium containing 298 [*]±[*] 3. 8 g/L glucose, since yeast cell viability was improved more significantly. Conclusions No lag phase was observed during ethanol fermentation with the <b>flocculating</b> <b>yeast,</b> and the implementation of ORP control improved ethanol productivity and yield. When ORP was controlled at − 150 mV, more reducing power was available for yeast cells to survive, which in turn improved their viability and VHG ethanol fermentation performance. On the other hand, controlling ORP at − 100 mV stimulated yeast growth and enhanced ethanol production under the HG conditions. Moreover, the ORP profile detected during ethanol fermentation with the <b>flocculating</b> <b>yeast</b> was less fluctuated, indicating that yeast flocculation could attenuate the ORP fluctuation observed during ethanol fermentation with non-flocculating yeast. </p...|$|R

40|$|Background: Considerable {{progress}} is being made in ethanol production from lignocellulosic feedstocks by fermentation, but negative effects of inhibitors on fermenting microorganisms are still challenging. Feeding preadapted cells has shown positive effects by sustaining fermentation in high-gravity simultaneous saccharification and co-fermentation (SSCF). Loss of cell viability has been reported in several SSCF studies on different substrates and seems to be the main reason for the declining ethanol production {{toward the end of the}} process. Here, we investigate how the combination of yeast preadaptation and feeding, cell flocculation, and temperature reduction improves the cell viability in SSCF of steam pretreated wheat straw. Results: More than 50 % cell viability was lost during the first 24 h of high-gravity SSCF. No beneficial effects of adding selected nutrients were observed in shake flask SSCF. Ethanol concentrations greater than 50 g L- 1 led to significant loss of viability and prevented further fermentation in SSCF. The benefits of feeding preadapted yeast cells were marginal at later stages of SSCF. Yeast flocculation did not improve the viability but simplified cell harvest and improved the feasibility of the cell feeding strategy in demo scale. Cultivation at 30 °C instead of 35 °C increased cell survival significantly on solid media containing ethanol and inhibitors. Similarly, in multifeed SSCF, cells maintained the viability and fermentation capacity when the temperature was reduced from 35 to 30 °C during the process, but hydrolysis yields were compromised. By combining the yeast feeding and temperature change, an ethanol concentration of 65 g L- 1, equivalent to 70 % of the theoretical yield, was obtained in multifeed SSCF on pretreated wheat straw. In demo scale, the process with <b>flocculating</b> <b>yeast</b> and temperature profile resulted in 5 % (w/w) ethanol, equivalent to 53 % of the theoretical yield. Conclusions: Multifeed SSCF was further developed by means of a <b>flocculating</b> <b>yeast</b> and a temperature-reduction profile. Ethanol toxicity is intensified in the presence of lignocellulosic inhibitors at temperatures that are beneficial to hydrolysis in high-gravity SSCF. The counteracting effects of temperature on cell viability and hydrolysis call for more tolerant microorganisms, enzyme systems with lower temperature optimum, or full optimization of the multifeed strategy with temperature profile...|$|R

40|$|The {{production}} of ethanol and other sustainable products including methane, limonene and pectin from citrus wastes (CWs) was {{studied in the}} present thesis. In {{the first part of}} the work, the CWs were hydrolyzed using enzymes – pectinase, cellulase and β-glucosidase – and the hydrolyzate was fermented using encapsulated yeasts in the presence of the inhibitor compound ‘limonene’. However, the application of encapsulated cells may be hampered by the high price of encapsulation, enzymes and the low stability of capsules’ membrane at high shear stresses. Therefore, a process based on dilute-acid hydrolysis of CWs was developed. The limonene of the CWs was effectively removed through flashing of the hydrolyzate into an expansion tank. The sugars present in the hydrolyzate were converted to ethanol using a <b>flocculating</b> <b>yeast</b> strain. Then ethanol was distilled and the stillage and the remaining solid materials of the hydrolyzed CWs were anaerobically digested to obtain methane. The soluble pectin content of hydrolyzate can be precipitated using the produced ethanol. One ton of CWs with 20 % dry weight resulted in 39. 64 l ethanol, 45 m 3 methane, 8. 9 l limonene, and 38. 8 kg pectin. The feasibility of the process depends on the transportation cost and the capacity of CW. For example, the total cost of ethanol with a capacity of 100, 000 tons CW/year was 0. 91 USD/L, assuming 10 USD/ton handling and transportation cost of CW to the plant. Changing the plant capacity from 25, 000 to 400, 000 tons CW per year results in reducing ethanol costs from 2. 55 to 0. 46 USD/L in an economically feasible process. Since this process employs a <b>flocculating</b> <b>yeast</b> strain, the major concern in design of the bioreactor is the sedimentation of yeast flocs. The size of flocs is a function of sugar concentration, time and flow. A CFD model of bioreactor was developed to predict the sedimentation of flocs and the effect of flow on distribution of flocs. The CFD model predicted that the flocs sediment when they are larger than 180 micrometer. The developed CFD model can be used in design and scale-up of the bioreactor. For the plants with low CW capacity, a steam explosion process was employed to eliminate limonene and the treated CW was used in a digestion plant to produce methane. The required cost of this pretreatment was about 0. 90 million dollars for 10, 000 tons/year of CWs.

In this review, we summarize recent progress in the application of high cell density yeast bioprocesses for first and second generation bioethanol production. High biomass concentrations obtained by retention of yeast cells in the reactor enables easier cell reuse, simplified product recovery and higher dilution rates in continuous processes. High local cell density cultures, in the form of encapsulated or strongly <b>flocculating</b> <b>yeast,</b> furthermore obtain increased tolerance to convertible fermentation inhibitors and utilize glucose and other sugars simultaneously, thereby overcoming two additional hurdles for second generation bioethanol production. These effects are caused by local concentration gradients due to diffusion limitations and conversion of inhibitors and sugars by the cells, which lead to low local concentrations of inhibitors and glucose. Quorum sensing may also contribute to the increased stress tolerance.

The use of immobilized cells is, without any doubt, {{one of the most interesting}} ways to achieve this purpose, being several the advantages they present. Moreover, they are a clear example of how life and engineering sciences interact in the {{development of}} a fermentation process. As the cost of the biomass support material is known to be a limiting factor in the implementation of a continuous high-cell-density fermentation process, the use of low cost immobilization technique is required as is the case of the application of <b>yeast</b> <b>flocculating</b> cells.

The plant where this process is applied includes three main components - an ultrafiltration unit, a bioreactor and a destillation unit. Final products of this process are a whey protein concentrate and ethanol. Ultrafiltration and distillation units {{are similar to the}} ones being used in other cheese whey treatment plants. The innovative characteristics of this process lie on the design of the bioreactor and its operation mode and on the microorganism being used. The bioreactor, with a total volume of 1000 litters at the installed scale, is a concentric tube internal loop air-lift bioreactor with a degassing zone at the top; the mode of operation is continuous; the lactose fermenting used yeast strain has the ability to form flocs. By using a <b>flocculating</b> <b>yeast</b> strain and operating the bioreactor continuously a higher productivity in lactose conversion to ethanol may be achieved with a simultaneous reduction in the volume of residual solids.

40|$|Yeast {{has long}} been {{considered}} the microorganism of choice for second-generation bioethanol production due to its fermentative capacity and ethanol tolerance. However, tolerance toward inhibitors derived from lignocellulosic materials is still an issue. <b>Flocculating</b> <b>yeast</b> strains often perform relatively well in inhibitory media, but inhibitor tolerance has never been clearly linked to the actual flocculation ability per se. In this study, variants of the flocculation gene FLO 1 were transformed into the genome of the nonflocculating laboratory yeast strain Saccharomyces cerevisiae CEN. PK 113 - 7 D. Three mutants with distinct differences in flocculation properties were isolated and characterized. The degree of flocculation and hydrophobicity of the cells were correlated {{to the length of}} the gene variant. The effect of different strength of flocculation on the fermentation performance of the strains was studied in defined medium with or without fermentation inhibitors, as well as in media based on dilute acid spruce hydrolysate. Strong flocculation aided against the readily convertible inhibitor furfural but not against less convertible inhibitors such as carboxylic acids. During fermentation of dilute acid spruce hydrolysate, the most strongly flocculating mutant with dense cell flocs showed significantly faster sugar consumption. The modified strain with the weakest flocculation showed a hexose consumption profile similar to the untransformed strain. These findings may explain why flocculation has evolved as a stress response and can find application in fermentation-based biorefinery processes on lignocellulosic raw materials...|$|R
40|$|Apart {{from the}} {{empirical}} conventional filtration model, {{a number of}} rigorous multiphase flow models are available for {{the description of the}} dead-end cake filtration of compressible slurries. In this study, Tiller`s and Smiles` models are compared with regard to their quantification of the dynamic filtration behavior of `dilute` <b>flocculated</b> <b>yeast</b> slurry during dead-end constant pressure filtration. Steady-state filtration is employed to obtain the compressive yield stress and specific resistance of the cake as functions of solid fraction. It is found that, by virtue of these cake properties, the governing equations of Smiles` and Tiller`s model can be numerically solved. The results show that Smiles` and Tiller`s models are equivalent in quantifying filterability and specific resistance, as well as solid fraction, superficial liquid velocity and solid pressure profiles. The compressible property of the cake is demonstrated by the dependence of either filterability or average specific resistance on the applied pressure. For dilute slurries, the applied pressure has a significant influence on solid fraction profile but has little influence on superficial liquid velocity profile with the maximum variance in superficial liquid velocity in the cake being determined by the solid fraction of the slurry. In the dead-end filtration of dilute slurry, the superficial liquid velocity through the cake is almost uniform and the specific resistance can be approximately obtained from correlation of filtration data by the conventional model. © 2007 Elsevier B.

40|$|One of {{the most}} common ways to improve the {{productivity}} of a fermentation process is the use of high cell density systems. In practice, such a system usually represents a threephase (gas-liquid-solid) dispersion operating in a continuous mode. The interest for these biosystems has been increasing because they seem to be a very promising alternative to the traditional batch fermentation with freely suspended cells. The cells are usually immobilised on a carrier or in a simpler and cheaper way, they are self-aggregated forming flocs. High cell density biosystems have many specific advantages: higher volumetric productivity, higher product concentration and substrate conversion, easy separation of biocatalyst (cells) from the liquid medium, utilization of the same biocatalyst (cells) for extended periods of process time and a minimised risk of contamination. A continuous airlift bioreactor (CALR) due to the advantageous combination of sufficient mixing, low shear stress and satisfactory flocs suspension at low power input is being often chosen for carrying out fermentations with high cell density. However, there is still a lack of reliable data on transport phenomena, which would allow bioreactor design and scale-up procedures to optimise a bioprocess performance at any bioreactor scale. In airlift bioreactors with a well-defined liquid circulation loop, the liquid velocity is the major hydrodynamic parameter, which considerably affects all physical phenomena. Most velocity measurement techniques are not suitable for use in fermentation processes (e. g. tagging of liquid elements with chemicals due to their interference with the exactly defined substrate pool and sterility problems, visual techniques as Laser Doppler Anemometry due to the opaqueness of the broth). The use of small flowfollowing particles with non-invasive detection of their movement is one of the promising methods. Detection techniques for opaque media include the use of radioactive counters, inductive coils and radio wave detectors. One of the attractive possibilities for a utilization of high cell density system is alcoholic fermentation of lactose from cheese whey using <b>flocculating</b> <b>yeast.</b> Cheese whey, as a by-product of dairy industry, represents a significant environmental problem due to very high values of BOD and COD. For this purpose, a flocculating recombinant strain of Sacharomyces cerevisae was developed enabling the hydrolysis of lactose to galactose and glucose, followed by sugar conversion into ethanol. The main goal {{of this study was to}} investigate the hydrodynamics of continuous airlift bioreactor during ethanolic fermentation using highly <b>flocculating</b> <b>yeast.</b> The magnetic particle-tracer method was used for hydrodynamic measurements. Different operation conditions (dilution and air flow rates and biomass concentration), bioreactor configuration and its scale (6 and 50 dm 3) have been applied in order to assess their impact on bioreactor hydrodynamics and its operation and to study scale-up effects on the bioprocess. Measurements of liquid circulation velocity revealed one very important fact regarding to airlift bioreactor operation with high cell density system – the existence of a critical value of biomass concentration, at which a dramatic deceleration of net liquid flow appears when the biomass quantity increases (see Figure). Moreover, the magnitude of critical biomass concentration was found not to be dependent on gas flow rate.

40|$|Zymomonas mobilis ZM 401 is a {{flocculating}} strain {{which can}} be self-immobilized within fermentors for a high-cell-density cul-ture to improve ethanol productivity, as well as high-gravity fermentation to increase ethanol titer, due to its improved ethanol tolerance associated with the morphological change. Here, we report its draft genome sequence. Due to the unique Entner-Doudoroff pathway, with 1 moleATP produced per mole glucose consumed (14), less bio-mass is accumulated during ethanol fermentation by Zymo-monas mobilis, which consequently improves ethanol yield, the most important technoeconomic factor for ethanol produc-tion, making this species an alternative to be engineered with a pentose metabolic pathway for bioethanol production from lignocellulosic biomass (1). Themost frequently studied strain ofZ. mobilis is ZM 4 (ATCC 31821), whose genome sequence was published in 2005 (13). ZM 401 (ATCC 31822) is a flocculating mutant of ZM 4 (11). In comparison to that of ZM 4, the phenotype of ZM 401 not only allows cells to be self-immobilized within fermentors without consumption of supportingmaterials for a high-density culture to improve ethanol productivity but also makes the strain suitable for high-gravity fermentation to increase ethanol titer, since the morphological change enhances ethanol tolerance. Moreover, the flocculating phenotype enables cost-effective biomass recovery by sedimentation instead of centrifugation, as reported for ethanol fermentation by <b>flocculating</b> <b>yeast</b> (16). Here, we report its draft genome sequence. We sequenced the nuclear genome of ZM 401 using the whole-genome shotgun sequencing approach and generated 910, 015 paired-end reads with the next-generation sequencing platform Illumina HiSeq 2000 (12).

40|$|Fining {{agents are}} used in the {{clarification}} of beers; they help to reduce the time required to sediment suspended yeast cells and ensure the clarity and colloidal stability of beer. Following an adventitious observation during dry-hopping experiments, we identified a fining activity associated with Saaz hops. Extracts of hop cones were subsequently shown to have the capacity to <b>flocculate</b> <b>yeast</b> and result in their sedimentation. This activity has since been identified in extracts of many different hop varieties and, significantly in spent hops, the co-product resulting from commercial extraction of hops with either CO 2 or ethanol. Here we illustrate the activity of the novel finings extracted from spent hops following CO 2 extraction of Galena hops. The sediments formed on fining were compact, relative to those obtained when commercial isinglass was used to fine the same beers. The hop extracts were also effective in reducing 90 ° haze in beers under conditions designed to mimic both cask ale (12 [*]°C) and lager (4 [*]°C) type applications. The compounds responsible for the fining activity appear to be large (30 – 100 [*]kDa, or more) polyphenols. Analysis of the polyphenols using colourimetric tests indicated the presence of proanthocyanidins. On acidic hydrolysis these generated cyanidin, which would be derived from a polymer composed of catechin and epicatechin subunits. The presence of these materials in spent hops offers the possibility to develop commercial products, with desirable fining properties, from an existing co-product stream. Furthermore, the finings are derived from a traditional ingredient of the brewing process...|$|R
40|$|It {{is widely}} {{accepted}} that flocculation improves filtration performance by increasing cake permeability. This principle {{is important in}} submerged membrane filtration for drinking water applications where the feed material can potentially contain fouling components which prohibit the extended operation of the filter. Less well understood {{is the impact of}} floc properties on the hydraulic properties of the fouling layer formed on the membrane or the impact of hydrodynamic conditions during treatment on the floc-fouling layer relationship. In order to advance knowledge of this area, a set of tools were developed to characterise the cake formed during constant pressure filtration in terms of the compressive yield stress and permeability as a function of solid volume fraction. Using an iterative procedure, the optimal parameters for these models are calculated as are pressure and solid fraction distribution profiles. Input parameters to the numerical analysis are flux and final cake height data obtained from batch filtration experiments which are driven to steady state. The calculated material properties are compared against piston and centrifuge data with good agreement. Application of the material properties to constant flux filtration involved development of a numerical model for simultaneous consolidation and cake formation. <b>Flocculated</b> <b>yeast</b> was used as the test system with the predicted transmembrane pressure rise as a function of time under constant flux conditions compared with experimental data. Good agreement is observed between model and experimental trends. The close correspondence between experimental and predicted results also suggests that {{it may be possible to}} predict trans-membrane pressure rise during constant flux filtration on the basis of material properties determined through simple constant pressure steady state experiments. A good account of the data was also achieved through extension of the general equation to include an empirical model for the consolidation time constant. These new tools were applied to characterise the cakes formed under well controlled shear conditions. To avoid complications with modeling the sheared filtration system, the filtration was performed below the critical shear rate for particle rejection. This was verified by in-situ particle counts and size measurement. The material properties were determined for <b>flocculated</b> <b>yeast</b> filtered in a coni-cylindrical Couette at several shear rates below the critical shear. Comparison of the compressive yield stress showed that cakes subjected to shear required less compressive stress to collapse. It is shown that the general equation for constant flux could be modified to encompass this effect through inclusion of an empirical shear parameter. The transmembrane pressure rise is able to be described well by this model. DEM particle simulation was performed to investigate the effect of floc size and structure on cake permeability. Flocs of known size and structure were placed in a virtual suspension and the process of consolidation simulated by application of a compressive force. The permeability of the cake was calculated by computational fluid dynamics at various stages of the consolidation showing that the larger compact floc showed the highest permeability despite the highly compact structures formed. Comparison of pore size distribution also confirmed that several larger pores remained after consolidation of the larger compact flocs. Further work needs to be undertaken to pin point the microstructural mechanism governing this behaviour and whether the presence of fluid passing through these pores under normal filtration flows affects the retention of permeability of cakes under compression. Furthermore, the shear environment required to minimise the detrimental effects caused by shear enhanced cake collapse and also to form flocs of compact structure and large size needs to investigated...|$|R
40|$|In this project, a novel bio-reactor {{technology}} in which reaction is coupled with product separation {{was developed to}} pilot/demonstration scale. Combining reaction with separation during a fermentation allows the fermentation of highly concentrated feeds and allows the fermentation of streams {{with high levels of}} salts/non-fermentable inhibitors. Simultaneous saccharification and fermentation of polysaccharides such as starch and cellulose can also be combined with ethanol separation in the Continuous Stirred Reactor Separator (CSRS). Application of the bio-reactor to various substrates was investigated on a lab scale with fermentation of raw starch, cane molasses, xylose, whey permeate and permeate mother liquor. <b>Flocculating</b> <b>yeast</b> strains for high density sucrose/glucose fermentation were selected and adapted to form fast settling pellets. A strain of K marxianus capable of fermenting high salt permeate mother liquor was also selected and adapted. A low energy solvent ethanol recovery system was developed for ethanol recovery from the vapors leaving the reactor/separator. This Solvent Absorption/Extractive Distillation (SAED) process gives a low energy method for purifying the ethanol to an anhydrous product. The amount of energy needed to recover an anhydrous ethanol product from a CSRS stage running at 8 % ethanol was calculated to be under 8, 000 BTU/gallon. This process may also have further application in VOC (volatile organic carbon compounds) removal from air streams. During this project, a 24, 000 Liter CSRS was designed, fabricated, installed, and operated at a small batch ethanol plant (Permeate Refining Inc) in NE Iowa. The reactor was operated on a semi-continuous basis over a period of 18 months.

40|$|Ethanol {{production}} from lignocellulosic biomass is considered more beneficial than its {{production from}} starch and sugar based crops, considering the energetics and environmental advantages {{as well as}} the readily availability of the feed stock. However, the recalcitrant nature of lignocellulosic materials makes its ethanol production more challenging. Common methods of hydrolysis and fermentation of lignocellulosic materials to ethanol is through the separate hydrolysis and fermentation method (SHF) and the simultaneous saccharification and fermentation method (SSF). During SHF, product inhibition of the enzymes occurs as the sugar concentration increases during the hydrolysis, the process is also associated with increased contamination risk. SSF process makes use of suboptimal conditions for the hydrolysis and the fermentation; also the fermenting organism cannot be reused since it has been mixed with the lignocellulosic biomass. In this study, a new method was developed for hydrolysis and fermentation of lignocellulosic materials to ethanol, called simultaneous saccharification, filtration and fermentation (SSFF). The method allows both the hydrolysis and fermentation at optimum conditions {{with the use of a}} membrane bioreactor. It also allows the fermenting organism to be reused for several batches. The method was applied on pretreated spruce using a <b>flocculating</b> <b>yeast</b> strain and also on pretreated wheat straw using encapsulated genetically modified yeast. SSFF was compared with SSF as one of the conventional method, both on 10 % suspended solids basis. From pretreated spruce, similar ethanol yield was obtained. Interestingly, from the pretreated wheat straw, 90 % ethanol yield of the theoretical value was obtained during the SSFF while just 53 % was obtained during the SSF. The study shows that the newly developed method of SSFF has the potential to replace the conventional methods and to improve ethanol production from lignocellulosic biomass.  Simultaneous Saccharification, Filtration and Fermentatio...|$|R
40|$|Bioethanol from {{lignocellulosic}} {{materials is}} one of the desired alternatives to meet the increased demand of renewable fuels. However, there are challenges in several steps of lignocellulose processing, including pretreatment, hydrolysis and fermentation. Using flocculating strains in the fermentation process gives a number of advantages. For example, the cells can be accumulated in the bioreactors leading to high cell concentration and rapid fermentation. They are easily separated using sedimentation and can thus be recycled to the bioreactors. Some of these strains are also better than non-flocculating strains at tolerating the possible inhibitors in the cultivation media, such as furan aldehydes, organic acids and phenolic compounds. These inhibitors make it hard for the yeast to ferment the hydrolyzate and detoxification is often necessary. A <b>flocculating</b> <b>yeast</b> strain was isolated from a Swedish ethanol plant (Domsjö Fabriker AB) fermenting sulphite liquor, and registered at Culture Collection University of Gothenburg as CCUG 53310. It has been shown that this strain can successfully ferment lignocellulosic hydrolyzates, where freely suspended reference strains failed to assimilate any sugar. In order to understand and get the possibility to improve the fermentation, a phenotypic and physiological characterization of the yeast strain has been performed. The effect of different inhibitor classes present in hydrolyzate as well as of complete hydrolyzate, on the macromolecular composition of the yeast has been investigated. Different responses {{can be seen from the}} different inhibitor classes, providing evidence for differences in metabolism between yeast cells grown in the different media. The phenotypical studies have shown that the strain, that is constitutively flocculating, belongs to the Flo 1 phenotype, meaning that its flocculation is inhibited only by mannose. It has also been shown that the flocculation is dependent on cell wall proteins, and Ca 2 +, suggesting calcium ion dependent proteins binding to carbohydrates in neighboring cells. The flocculating cells also exhibit a significantly higher hydrophobicity than the non-flocculating reference strain; this is a factor that might also contribute to the flocculation...|$|R

40|$|Bioengineering has a {{considerable}} {{potential for the}} use of complex systems (CS) in modelling and simulation. Biological systems are built on functional elements, where the large variety of existing chemical and physical properties allow them to present a vast diversity at any scale level. Furthermore, the composites and control structures that build-up from the different levels, tend to form self-organised and regulated mechanisms, all of which are capable to provide adaptation and redundancy of systems that support life. Therefore, CS modeling of cells and colonies is an important challenge in the post-genome era of Biotechnology. Legacy technology The authors first approach to the use of CS was applied to the study of quality and safety of refrigerated foods during their life cycle. Some of the tested concepts (e. g. elements, composites, structures, agents and scenarios) constitute today a ’legacy technology’ for bioengineering process simulation, and therefore, examples of simulations are presented. This approach has however a ’limit of scale’ due {{to the use of the}} finite element method (the building block), being therefore, better suited for describing macroscale phenomena, such as heat/mass transfer, fluid flow, simple chemical reactions, Michaelis-Menten enzyme mechanics or Monod microbiological growth; and not for simulating the cell and colonies at the mesoscale. Thus, one of the main challenges for bioengineering is to develop strategies that enable the description of systems from the mesoscale to the macroscale. BioReactor engineering: Mesoscale to macroscale! Simulation tools are now being developed to assist during process prototyping. These include, describing cell dynamics (cycle and metabolism), cell to cell communications and colony dynamics (quorum sensing) inside bioreactors. Such tools present a huge potential to be used in networks, cellular automata (individual based models - artificial life) and information theory for mining relationships, as well as, other pattern recognition techniques that provide information to build mesoscale models and link them to macroscale events.

Oxygen availability was not uniform in the fermenter, according to the global volumetric mass transfer coefficients determined.
