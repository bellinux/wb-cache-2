5|$|Frequent {{cyclones}} also pose a threat, {{particularly to}} concentrated or small populations. In late January 1997, Cyclone Gretelle destroyed 80% of the Manombo forest canopy. With their habitat, including {{most of their}} food resources, effectively destroyed, the ruffed lemurs of the forest broadened their diet, remaining surprisingly frugivorous. Their body weights dropped and no births were reported for four years, but they managed to stave off starvation. This event demonstrated not only their <b>flexibility</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> face of natural disasters, which may highlight the evolutionary reasons behind their reproductive capacity and litter size, but also the threat faced by already stressed populations.|$|E
5|$|The {{network of}} lines south of Preston allowed great <b>flexibility</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> routing of trains. A train {{approaching}} the town {{on any of}} the lines from the south (except the WLR from Southport) could be routed to enter the station via either the North Union or the East Lancashire line. It was even possible for trains from the north to perform an effective U-turn, a feat sometimes carried out by trains between Scotland and Blackpool that would otherwise have had to reverse.|$|E
5|$|The phase {{behavior}} of lipid bilayers is determined {{largely by the}} strength of the attractive Van der Waals interactions between adjacent lipid molecules. Longer-tailed lipids have more area over which to interact, increasing the strength of this interaction and, as a consequence, decreasing the lipid mobility. Thus, at a given temperature, a short-tailed lipid will be more fluid than an otherwise identical long-tailed lipid. Transition temperature can also be affected by the degree of unsaturation of the lipid tails. An unsaturated double bond can produce a kink in the alkane chain, disrupting the lipid packing. This disruption creates extra free space within the bilayer that allows additional <b>flexibility</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> adjacent chains. An example of this effect can be noted in everyday life as butter, which has a large percentage saturated fats, is solid at room temperature while vegetable oil, which is mostly unsaturated, is liquid.|$|E

5|$|To {{make the}} boot loader {{appealing}} to other operating system developers, Apple added features to allow <b>flexibility</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> booting process such as network boot using TFTP and load Mach-O and ELF formatted kernels. BootX can also boot from HFS, HFS+, UFS and ext2 formatted volumes. The boot loader {{can be manipulated}} at startup by holding down various key combinations to alter the booting process. Such functions include Verbose Mode, achieved by holding down the Command and V key at startup, which replaces the default Apple logo with text-based information on the boot process and Single User Mode, achieved by holding down the Command and S, which, depending on the operating system, may boot into a more basic command-line or text-based version of the operating system, to facilitate maintenance and recovery action. The ROM can also be set to require a password to access these technical functions using the OpenFirmware interface.|$|E
5|$|Abelisaurids, {{especially}} Majungasaurus, may instead {{have been}} adapted for a feeding strategy {{more similar to}} modern felids, with short and broad snouts, that bite once and hold on until the prey is subdued. Majungasaurus had an even broader snout than other abelisaurids, {{and other aspects of}} its anatomy may also support the bite-and-hold hypothesis. The neck was strengthened, with robust vertebrae, interlocking ribs and ossified tendons, as well as reinforced muscle attachment sites on the vertebrae and the back of the skull. These muscles {{would have been able to}} hold the head steady despite the struggles of its prey. Abelisaurid skulls were also strengthened in many areas by bone mineralized out of the skin, creating the characteristic rough texture of the bones. This is particularly true of Majungasaurus, where the nasal bones were fused and thickened for strength. On the other hand, the lower jaw of Majungasaurus sported a large fenestra (opening) on each side, as seen in other ceratosaurs, as well as synovial joints between certain bones that allowed a high degree of <b>flexibility</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> lower jaw, although not to the extent seen in snakes. This may have been an adaptation to prevent the fracture of the lower jaw when holding onto a struggling prey animal. The front teeth of the upper jaw were more robust than the rest, to provide an anchor point for the bite, while the low crown height of Majungasaurus teeth prevented them from breaking off during a struggle. Finally, unlike the teeth of Allosaurus and most other theropods, which were curved on both the front and back, abelisaurids like Majungasaurus had teeth curved on the front edge but straighter on the back (cutting) edge. This structure may have served to prevent slicing, and instead holding the teeth in place when biting.|$|E

40|$|In 2005, India amended its Patents Act, 1970 to {{introduce}} TRIPS compliant product patent regime. Generally speaking, {{law and policy}} makers <b>in</b> India during <b>the</b> time of the amendment were confronted with two major concerns viz. {{the future of the}} Indian pharmaceutical industry and access to affordable medicines in India and other developing countries. To address these concerns India along with many other developing countries attempted to incorporate TRIPS <b>flexibilities</b> <b>in</b> their domestic law. However, the success of <b>the</b> TRIPS <b>flexibilities</b> <b>in</b> addressing <b>the</b> question of access to affordable medicines mainly depends on three factors: a) <b>the</b> incorporation of <b>flexibilities</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> domestic law; b) the manufacturing capability of a country; and c) the political will to use the public interest safeguards provided <b>in</b> <b>the</b> domestic law. There are only a few countries like India, which satisfy the above-mentioned conditions to a certain extent. This article examines whether these premises hold true after five years into the implementation of the TRIPS compliant patent system in India. <b>In</b> this context <b>the</b> paper identifies and analyzes the legal, policy and institutional challenges that India is currently facing <b>in</b> <b>the</b> implementation of TRIPS flexibilities. It also identifies the main legal, policy and institutional disconnect <b>in</b> <b>the</b> implementation of TRIPS <b>flexibilities</b> <b>in</b> India. It argues that to effectively use TRIPS flexibilities to address access to affordable medicines require changes in three areas viz. law, policy and institutions. It clearly shows that mere incorporation of TRIPS <b>flexibilities</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> domestic legislation alone is not enough and the domestic legislation needs to be complemented with policy and institutional framework. ...|$|R

25|$|Primatologist Klaus Zuberbühler uses {{these ideas}} to {{help explain the}} {{emergence}} of vocal <b>flexibility</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> human species.
