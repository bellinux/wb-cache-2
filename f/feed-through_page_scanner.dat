50|$|In the 1990s Telesensory {{increasingly}} shifted {{its emphasis}} toward the low-vision market and became less {{devoted to the}} Optacon. <b>Page</b> <b>scanners</b> with optical character recognition {{had come to be}} the tool of choice for blind people wanting access to print. <b>Page</b> <b>scanners</b> were less expensive and had a much shallower learning curve than the Optacon. In addition, blind people could generally read through material more quickly with a <b>page</b> <b>scanner</b> than with an Optacon.|$|R

50|$|Most {{high-end}} commercial robotic scanners use traditional air and suction technology {{while some}} others use alternative approaches like bionic finger for turning the <b>pages.</b> Some <b>scanners</b> {{take advantage of}} Ultrasonic sensor or Photoelectric sensor to detect dual pages and prevent skipping of pages. With reports of machines being able to scan up to 2900 pages per hour robotic book scanners are specifically designed for large-scale digitization projects.|$|R
50|$|Students {{who would}} like to utilize library copiers, printers, and {{scanners}} need to preload money in increments of $1 or $5 onto their respective school’s identification card at an automated load station. While BC students may print from the majority of computers in the library, FAU students are restricted to printing from the computes in room 103. Printing charges are 10 cents per <b>page,</b> but <b>scanners</b> may be used at no charge.|$|R
50|$|As the day watch commences, John Koenig {{leaves his}} office and enters Main Mission. A recent {{accident}} has left Paul Morrow with fractured ribs and a broken ankle. With his second-in-command recuperating in the Medical Centre, Koenig is working even longer hours than normal. He offers Winters, one of the senior operatives, the opportunity to temporarily assume Morrow's position. When the man gladly accepts, Koenig adjourns to his quarters for some much-needed rest. The Commander has scarcely sat down when he hears Winters <b>paging</b> him. <b>Scanners</b> have detected an unidentified powered object approaching the Moon.|$|R
50|$|More recently, {{with digital}} {{scanning}} and image manipulation, non-photo blue fulfills its {{function in a}} different way. The artist can do their sketch and inking in the traditional manner and scan the <b>page.</b> Most <b>scanners</b> will detect the light blue lines. However, shifting to greyscale and increasing the contrast and brightness of the scanned image causes the blue to disappear. Another common approach involves replacing the blue channel with another channel - typically the red channel. The exact processes may differ depending on the scanner, settings and image-editing software, but the concept remains the same.|$|R
40|$|Shiga toxins 1 and 2 (Stx 1 and Stx 2) from Shiga toxin-producing E. coli (STEC) {{bacteria}} were simultaneously detected with a newly developed, high-throughput antibody microarray platform. The proteinaceous toxins were immobilized and {{sandwiched between}} biorecognition elements (monoclonal antibodies) and pooled horseradish peroxidase (HRP) -conjugated monoclonal antibodies. Following {{the reaction of}} HRP with the precipitating chromogenic substrate (metal enhanced 3, 3 -diaminobenzidine tetrahydrochloride or DAB), {{the formation of a}} colored product was quantitatively measured with an inexpensive flatbed <b>page</b> <b>scanner.</b> The colorimetric ELISA microarray was demonstrated to detect Stx 1 and Stx 2 at levels as low as ~ 4. 5 ng/mL within ~ 2 h of total assay time with a narrow linear dynamic range of ~ 1 – 2 orders of magnitude and saturation levels well above background. Stx 1 and/or Stx 2 produced by various strains of STEC were also detected following the treatment of cultured cells with mitomycin C (a toxin-inducing antibiotic) and/or B-PER (a cell-disrupting, protein extraction reagent). Semi-quantitative detection of Shiga toxins was demonstrated to be sporadic among various STEC strains following incubation with mitomycin C; however, further reaction with B-PER generally resulted in the detection of or increased detection of Stx 1, relative to Stx 2, produced by STECs inoculated into either axenic broth culture or culture broth containing ground beef...|$|R
50|$|Doxie scanner use {{rechargeable}} {{lithium-ion battery}} {{that can be}} used for ingesting about 100 documents. The AC cable allows the powering of the scanner to save the batteries. It is also featured with 512 MB of onboard storage for saving approximately 600 scanned pages or about 2,400 photos, with scans being done at up to 600dpi in 24bit color in 12 seconds per <b>page.</b> The <b>scanner</b> can be used for business cards, receipts, and standard printed documents scanning, and it supports Google Docs, Evernote, Scribd, Backpack, Acrobat.com and Flickr. Doxie also offers integration with some online tools, such as Google Drive, offering optical character recognition for turning scanned pages into actual text documents. It is available in both Windows and OS X.|$|R
50|$|As for outsourcing, {{books are}} often shipped to be scanned by {{low-cost}} sources to India or China. Alternatively, due to convenience, safety and technology improvement, many organizations choose to scan in-house by using either overhead scanners which are time-consuming, or digital camera-based scanning machines which are substantially faster {{and is a}} method employed by Internet Archive as well as Google. Traditional methods have included cutting off the book's spine and scanning the <b>pages</b> in a <b>scanner</b> with automatic page-feeding capability, with subsequent rebinding of the loose pages.|$|R

He is also the president and owner of ArtScans Studio in Culver City, California, where he uses a scanner of his own invention to serve a clientele of celebrity artists and fine artists. The ArtScans <b>page</b> describes the <b>scanner</b> this way: [...] "ArtScans has been doing accurate color capture for reproduction since 1992. We own and operate a large (44" [...] x 50") flatbed scanner {{that is the only}} one of its kind in the world. Both the scanner and its software were designed by us." ...|$|R
