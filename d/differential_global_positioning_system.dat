2500|$|Geodetic {{methods are}} an {{indirect}} method for {{the determination of}} mass balance of glacier. Maps of a glacier made at two different points in time can be compared and the difference in glacier thickness observed {{used to determine the}} mass balance over a span of years. This is best accomplished today using <b>Differential</b> <b>Global</b> <b>Positioning</b> <b>System.</b> Sometimes the earliest data for the glacier surface profiles is from images that are used to make topographical maps and digital elevation models. Aerial mapping or photogrammetry is now used to cover larger glaciers and icecaps such found in Antarctica and Greenland, however, because of the problems of establishing accurate ground control points in mountainous terrain, and correlating features in snow and where shading is common, elevation errors are typically not less than 10m (32ft). Laser altimetry provides a measurement of the elevation of a glacier along a specific path, e.g., the glacier centerline. The difference of two such measurements is the change in thickness, which provides mass balance over the time interval between the measurements. [...] Again a good method over a span of time but not for annual change detection. The value of geodetic programs is providing an independent check of traditional mass balance work, by comparing the cumulative changes over ten or more years.|$|E

40|$|The {{coastal zone}} {{is a highly}} dynamic entity both {{spatially}} and temporally and when shoreline changes (and in particular retreat) occur on a hmnan time-scale, measurement of {{the rate of change}} becomes a pressing issue. This dynamism presents an excellent scenario for monitoring change using remote sensing techniques, {{and in the case of}} coastal sand dunes, where the requirement is to measure small scale changes such as erosion or accretion in the region of 10 or 20 m, aerial photography is the preferred source of remotely sensed data. The rapid developments in digital camera technology and real time satellite <b>differential</b> <b>Global</b> <b>Positioning</b> <b>Systems</b> have yielded new opportunities for mapping and monitoring environmental change when used with image processing and mapping software and state-of-the-art digital photogrammetric workstations. Despite the progress in digital technologies, however, there is still considerable lack of awareness on the part of potential users, and it is in response to this that the processing chain for data collection through to orthophoto production described here has been developed. This study explores the major issues that affect quality, mission logistics and cost and will demonstrate the methodology and application of digital techniques for producing georectified imagery and contoured orthophoto maps of coastal environments. This will be achieved through a series of case studies of dynamic dune environments in south-west England and France.

The inexpensive DGPS requires post-processing to achieve accuracy O(0. 4 m) and O(0. 01 m/s). Thirty drifters were constructed and deployed in well-developed, rip-currents to map the circulation patterns {{for the first time}} in the field at a high spatial resolution. Drifter observations obtained during three-hour periods on seven different days under varying wave and tidal conditions describe eddies with a rotational period of 4. 7 min, confined to the surf-zone and coupled to the rip morphology. On average, three drifters per hour exited the surfzone. Dependent upon wave conditions, one or two eddies existed between 90 m-spaced rip-channels, creating a seaward flow in the channels and shoreward flow over the shoals. Cross-shore volumetric flow rates for an alongshore transect through the eddy centers balance to a difference of less than 10 % of the gross flow discharge.

Researchers developed the conformal augmented HUD as an intuitive adjunct that provides a high fidelity reconstructed image of essential aspects of the visual field superimposed on the actual field of view.

Researchers investigated {{the use of}} <b>differential</b> <b>global</b> <b>positioning</b> <b>systems</b> (GPS), inertial measurement, and other sensing technologies {{as the basis of}} a system that would prevent crashes. Such a system attempts to control the vehicle if it leaves the lane because the driver is incapacitated.

The long-term goal of this research involves development of a "driver-centered" vehicle control system capable of providing lane-keeping feedback to the driver, and, ifnecessary, of imposing aggressive intervention strategies to take over control of the vehicle, steer it to a safe position on the shoulder, and stop it. This research also targets the development of "driver assistive" technologies [...] such as Heads Up Display and torque feedback supplied by the steering wheel [...] which provide information to the driver without necessarily requiring computer control of the vehicle.
