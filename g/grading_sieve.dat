40|$|The {{shape factor}} of quarry rock - {{defined by the}} ratio of the median nominal {{diameter}} and median sieve diameter - is often applied throughout various phases in the realization of a granular hydraulic structure. In this research, the value as well as the variability of the shape factor is reassessed. Also the dependency of the shape factor on elongation and blockiness - two parameters to describe the shape of rock - is examined. In order to do so a series of experiments has been performed on multiple rock samples. The research focuses on experimental rock data. Each file represents a specific rock grading. On each <b>grading,</b> <b>sieve</b> tests, density tests and shape tests have been performed in both IJmuiden, the Netherlands and Slovag, Norway...|$|E

The material examined came from three Areas A, B and C. Three types of samples were examined for molluscs. Bulk samples of approximately 30 liters volume were treated in a water separation machine ("flotation tank') constructed according to blueprints supplied by the Museum of London. The float was passed through <b>graded</b> <b>sieves</b> (1 mm and 250 micrometer mesh, in that order) and then air-dried and sorted. The sediment remaining in the machine, after all the flot was separated off, was air-dried and <b>sieved</b> through <b>graded</b> <b>sieves</b> of mesh size 8 mm, 4 mm, 2 mm, and 1 mm in that order, following which each fraction was sorted by hand to separate out organic remains.

40|$|Particle size {{distribution}} and trace element patterns were studied in a full-scale anaerobic digestion plant treating pig slurry. Mass balance was established for major (N, P, K, Ca, Fe, Mg and S) and minor (Al, Cu, Mn and Zn) elements. Most {{of the elements}} were conserved through the process {{but part of the}} P, Ca, Mg and Mn was deposited as crystals lining the digester. In the dry matter of the slurry, Cu and Zn occurred at between 170 and 2600 mg kg 1 due to pig diet supplements. Analyses of particle {{size distribution}}s in raw and digested slurries showed a general shift in distribution towards larger sizes due to degradation of small and easily degradable particles as well as formation of large microbial filaments. <b>Graded</b> <b>sieving</b> of digested slurry showed metals to be mainly present on 3 – 25 lm particles.

40|$|The {{grading curve}} of an {{aggregate}} {{is a fundamental}} characteristic for mix design that can easily be modified to adjust several mix properties. While sieve analysis remains the reference method to determine this curve, optical devices are developing, allowing easier and faster assessment of aggregate grading. Unfortunately, optical grading results significantly differ from <b>sieve</b> <b>grading</b> curves. As a consequence, getting full acceptance of these new methods requires building bridges between the various particle size measurement systems. In order to build the <b>sieve</b> <b>grading</b> curve of an aggregate sample from video image analysis, a new model using images captured by a single camera device has been developed. This model has been tested on different samples stemming from four quarries with various petrography and flakiness index. For the 10 / 12. 5, 12. 5 / 16, 10 / 16 and 10 / 25 size fractions, the difference between actual <b>sieve</b> <b>grading</b> curve and optical grading curve is smaller than 7 %. For the 6. 3 / 10 fraction, the maximum {{difference between the two}} grading curves is equal to 15 %. This difference could mainly be explained by parasitical rotation of small particles before image capture...|$|R
40|$|Ultrafiltration {{study of}} the ultramicroscopic viruses {{provides}} a direct method for determining the approximate size of these agents. A graded series of collodion filters of progressively smaller permeability can be prepared according to the- general method developed by Bechhold (1907 a, 1907 b) and applied to biological studies by Hitchcock (1925, 1926), Elford (1929), Krueger and Ritter (1930), and others. Under appropriate conditions the virus suspensions can be frac-tionated {{into a series of}} suspensions containing more and more finely dispersed particles, the series of membranes acting in some respects as a <b>graded</b> <b>sieve.</b> Results obtained by this method, therefore, give only an approximation as to the maximum size of the active principle. In this work, before carrying on ultrafiltration studies with the virus of poliomyelitis, a comparison was made between mem-branes prepared according to the different methods described in the literature. On the basis of these preliminary studies the following procedure was adopted, for the reason that by this methodmembranes can be reproduced with an accuracy of i 5 per cent.

40|$|In {{this study}} an attempt {{has been made}} to {{understand}} thehydrogeomorphological regime of the Vidrupa River basin by utilizing soil texture qualitative classification tool through both the field and laboratory analysis to determine the classes for agricultural soils based on their physical texture. The classes are distinguished in the field by the 'textural feel' which can be further clarified by separating the relative proportions of sand, silt and clay using <b>grading</b> <b>sieves,</b> the particle size distribution. The class is then used to determine crop suitability and to approximate the soils responses to environmental and management conditions such as drought or calcium (lime) requirements. Rainfall – runoff processes in tropical microcatchments are driven by a combination of factors like rainfall characteristics, soil physical conditions, slope gradients and vegetation types. Nevertheless, soil physical properties like texture and drainage conditions of the subsoil as well as slope gradients are key factors in runoff control under tropical rainfall with high storm event intensities and rainfall accumulations. Hydrological processes in tropical watersheds are strongly influenced by particular climatic, geomorphologic and soil conditions in the tropics. High temperature and wetness accelerate rock weathering and the formation of deep soil profiles is widely shown in the study area...|$|R

Rat glomeruli were isolated by a <b>graded</b> <b>sieving</b> technique, {{and the nature}} and purity of the preparation were examined by scanning electron microscopy (SEM). A {{great majority of the}} glomeruli (86. 0 ± 6. 0 %) were not encapsulated, and there was very little contamination of the preparations with tubular fragments. By supplementing tissue culture medium with conditioned medium (CM) and insulin, we were able to grow single cells from dissociated rat glomeruli. From these single cells, we were able to clone and maintain in culture three distinct cell types. Also, with this specialized medium, we were able to clone these three cell types from outgrowths of whole golmeruli. One of these cell types was characterized as glomerular epithelial cells (GEC). GEC, as opposed to the other two cloned cell types obtained in this study, had cilia on their surfaces and also possessed receptors for complement (C 3) in vitro. Low concentrations of the aminonucleoside of puromycin (AMNS), which {{have been shown to be}} specifically cytotoxic to GEC in vivo, were found to be cytotoxic to GEC but not to the other two glomerular cells in vitro. In addition, GEC did not contain antihemophilic factor (factor VIII), a marker for endothelium, nor were they able to phagocytose polystyrene spherules in vitro, as can mesangial cells in short-term culture...|$|R

Although adenosine {{is known to}} affect renal function through stimulating adenosine receptors, {{little is known about}} A 1 receptors in human glomeruli. Thus, we attempted to identify the adenosine A 1 receptor-cyclic AMP (cAMP) system in human glomeruli. Normal renal cortical tissues were obtained at nephrectomy of patients with renal cell carcinoma. Glomeruli were isolated using a <b>graded</b> <b>sieving</b> method or dissected manually under a stereomicroscope. Radioligand binding assay using 2 -chloro-N-[3 H] cyclopentyl adenosine ([3 H]CCPA, an A 1 agonist ligand) was performed at 30 °C for 90 minutes. Cyclic AMP (cAMP) produced in glomeruli was measured after incubation with different concentrations of N 6 -cyclohexyladenosine (CHA; A 1 agonist) and a phosphodiesterase inhibitor. The specific binding was saturated within 60 minutes and reversible by adding 1 mM of theophylline. Scatchard plot analysis revealed a single class of binding site (Kd = 1. 78 ± 0. 21 nM, Bmax = 271. 7 ± 35. 8 fmol/mg protein). The specific binding was inhibited dose-dependently by various agents in an order suggesting A 1 receptor specificity. CHA inhibited the production of cAMP in microdissected human glomeruli. This inhibitory effect was antagonized by 8 -cyclopentyl- 1, 3 -dipropylxanthine (DPCPX; A 1 antagonist). This is the first study revealing the presence of the A 1 receptor-cAMP system in human glomeruli using a radioligand binding assay method and by measuring the cAMP production...|$|R

Cow bone were procured from an abattoir and sun dried for 4 weeks after which it was crushed with a sledge hammer. A portion was burnt to ashes while others were further pulverized with laboratory ball mill before the two <b>grades</b> were <b>sieved</b> using 75 μm sieve size.

Hence bagasse can be used in production of asbestos-free brake pad...|$|R
40|$|Within {{recent years}} {{much has been}} done toward {{determining}} the agricultural significance of certain physical properties of the soil. The grade of fineness {{is the most important}} of these physical properties, in that it determines, to a large extent, other properties. The· mechanical analysis of soils has thus come to be considered of primary importance in soil investigations. Any improvements in the methods or apparatus for mechanical analysis will, therefore, doubtless be welcomed by agricultural investigators. Though this is a very recent line of work, still many devices have been introduced for the separation of soil on the basis of fineness into different <b>grades.</b> The <b>sieving</b> can be carried out practically only for the coarser grades of sand and gravel. The original beaker methods in several modifications, all depending upon unequally rapid settling through quiet water, and subsequent decantation, were improved on by Noebel, Schoene and others by introducing a rising current of water. Hilgard has improved this method further by introducing at the bottom of the elutriation tube, a churn to break up floccules. Both the beaker method and these elutriation methods are open to the objection that for the finer separations they are very time-consuming, and that for the finest separations which are desirable, they are entirely impracticable. These very finest grades, however, differ most remarkable from the coarser grades, and their separation and quantitative determination is, therefore, the most desirable part of the mechanical analysis...|$|R
40|$|There {{has been}} debate about animals’ {{contribution}} to ocean circulation, called biomixing, or biogenic mixing. The energy input of schooling fish is significant but the eddies {{may be too}} small; so energy is dissipated as heat before impacting oceanic structure. I suggest that high turbulence caused by some very large aggregations of small animals has an important impact via a more direct ecosystem feedback process than overall ocean circulation. In the model presented here, large schools exhibit cooperative behavior and act like giant <b>sieves</b> <b>grading</b> zooplankton through individual swimmer’s wakes, which focus the best prey in predictable positions. Following schoolers exploit these patterns. Then schools leave, in their wakes, chaotic turbulence enhancing growth of the smaller zooplankton and phytoplankton which has been graded out by the school. The result is a different community structure of plankton than would exist without such biomixing. Changes to plankton abundance and community structure on oceanic scales {{over the past century}} are correlated to overfishing and are consistent with this concept...|$|R

A new asbestos free brake pad was developed using an agro waste material of sawdust {{along with other}} ingredients. This was {{with a view to}} exploiting the characteristics of sawdust which are largely deposited as waste around sawmills in replacing asbestos which {{has been found to be}} carcinogenic.

The properties examined are microstructure analysis, hardness, compressive strength, density, ash content, wear rate and water absorption. The results obtained showed that the finer the sieve size the better the properties. The results obtained in this work were compared with that of commercial brake pad (asbestos based) and showed a close correlation.

40|$|The {{development}} of asbestos free brake pads using corn husks as alternative filler was studied {{with a view}} to replacing asbestos, which has been known to be carcinogenic. Corn husks was sourced and milled, before been <b>sieved</b> into <b>sieve</b> <b>grades</b> of 100 and 200 μm. The varying proportions of the as-screened corn husk fibres and silicon carbide were mixed with fixed proportions of graphite, steel dust and resin to produce brake pads by using compressional moulding. The hardness, compressive strength, density, flame resistance, wear rate and porosity of the products were then determined. The result obtained showed that the brake pad produced with the corn husk passing the finer 100 μm screen gave better compressive strength, higher hardness, lower porosity and lower rate of wear, consequent on the finer distribution of the corn husks particles in the matrix. The results obtained for the brake pads were then compared with that of commercial brake pad (asbestos based and optimum formulation laboratory brake pad, corn husk based). The results were found to be in close agreement suggesting that corn husk can be used in the production of asbestos-free brake pads...|$|R
40|$|The {{aflatoxin}} {{distribution in}} corn fractions obtained after visual segregation for defects in 30 samples, {{known to be}} contaminated, was studied. Each sample was passed through a 5. 0 mm round holes <b>sieve,</b> <b>graded</b> for defects and then segregated in sound kernels (regular kernels) and non-sound kernels (injured, germinated, fermented, moldy, heated, insect damaged, immature, broken, hollow, fermented up to ¼, discolored, extraneous materials, and injured by other causes), {{as defined by the}} Brazilian Official Grading rules for corn. The non-sound kernels showed the highest contamination levels in all samples. The contamination levels of non-sound kernels (20 % of total weight) ranged from 23 to 1, 365 µg/kg of aflatoxins (B 1, B 2, G 1 and G 2) and were higher than sound kernels (p< 1 %) ranging from not detected (ND) to 126 µg/kg and in 87 % of these the aflatoxin contents were lower than 20 µg/kg. Statistically significant correlation indexes were found among the percentage of defective groups like fermented, heated and sprouted kernels or the total injured kernels, and the estimated contamination levels for the sound and non sound fractions. It was concluded that the non-sound kernels fraction, even being small in weight, has contributed with 84 % of the estimated contamination of the samples. The segregation of the non-sound kernels would favor a reduction in the contamination of corn lots. The poorer quality corn types (types 3 and Bellow Standart) have predominated among samples of the experiment...|$|R
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{evaluate}} the relationships between physicochemical properties and aerosolisation performance of different grades of lactose. In order to get a wide range of physicochemical properties, various grades of lactose namely Flowlac 100 (FLO), Lactopress anhydrous 250 (LAC), Cellactose 80 (CEL), Tablettose 80 (TAB), and Granulac 200 (GRA) were used. The different lactose <b>grades</b> were carefully <b>sieved</b> to separate 63 - 90 μm particle size fractions and then characterised in terms of size, shape, density, flowability, and solid state. Formulations were prepared by blending each lactose with salbutamol sulphate (SS) at ratio of 67. 5 : 1 (w/w), and then evaluated in terms of SS content uniformity, lactose-SS adhesion properties, and in vitro aerosolisation performance delivered from the Aerolizer. <b>Sieved</b> lactose <b>grades</b> showed similar particle size distributions (PSDs) and good flow properties but different particle shape, particle surface texture, and particle solid state. Content uniformity assessments indicated that lactose particles with rougher surface produced improved SS homogeneity within DPI formulation powders. Lactose-SS adhesion assessments indicated that lactose particles with more elongated shape and the rougher surface showed smaller adhesion force between lactose and salbutamol sulphate. Lactose powders with higher bulk density and higher tap density produced smaller emission (EM) and higher drug loss (DL) of SS. In vitro aerosolisation for various lactose grades followed the following rank order in terms of deposition performance: GRA>TAB>LAC ≈ CEL>FLO. Linear relationships were established showing that in order to maximize SS delivery to lower airway regions, lactose particles with more elongated shape, more irregular shape, and rougher surface are preferred. Therefore, considerable improvement in DPI performance can be achieved by careful selection of grade of lactose included within DPI formulations...|$|R
40|$|The {{research}} {{portrayed in}} this dissertation aims to derive empirical means of predicting CBR values from index testing parameters and parameters calculated from them (e. g. shrinkage product). The project involved compiling {{a database of}} test results {{for a range of}} rock material types across moist and dry regions in southern Africa. The database was compiled {{in such a way that}} it represents natural gravels sampled (mostly) for construction or rehabilitation of road layer works. The database included a location description, material description, Weinert N-Value, Atterberg Limits, grading analysis and CBR values. In addition to this, the linear shrinkage product, shrinkage product, grading coefficient, grading modulus and dust ratio were calculated and also used in the analyses. All the samples were divided into two groups based on climate, as described by Weinert (1980). The data was then further sub-divided into compaction classes (95 %, 98 % and 100 % Mod AASHTO) and within these compaction classes, each sample was assigned to a rock material group based on the classification proposed by Weinert (1980), but with minor alterations (e. g. further subdivision of pedogenic deposits). A total of 60 groups were created. Data processing was done using grading normalised to 100 % passing the 37, 5 mm screen. In order to limit interdependency resulting from the cumulative <b>grading,</b> the <b>sieve</b> analysis results were converted to percentages retained on each sieve. This was necessary as statistical regressions often rejected datasets due to interdependency among input parameters (such as Atterberg Limits and cumulative grading). Based on the nature of the data, both stepwise linear regressions and Weibull regressions were performed. Though the Weibull regression is more suitable to the data (in theory) the linear regression could not be excluded, due to variable data. In addition, the existing model proposed by Kleyn (1955) which was derived empirically by Stephens (1988) was also retained for the analysis. In an attempt to refine Kleyn s model, the two parameters used by the method (i. e. grading modulus and plasticity index) were used in normal linear regressions in an attempt to adapt the model to specific material (and compaction) groups in the two climatic regions. More than 130 regressions were done for the final analysis (excluding experimental regressions, etc.), after restricting the predicted CBR ranges in an attempt to eliminate the prevailing data trend. The attempt proved futile, though, placing severe restrictions on the derived models. For each of the 60 groups all four methods were tested (i. e. stepwise linear regression, Weibull regression, Kleyn s model and a linear model adapted for each group based on Kleyn s model) and the most suitable model selected. A number of regressions were incomplete due to insufficient data, particularly in the groups associated with dry regions. Results proved poor and are ascribed to data variability rather than test methods. The data variability, in turn, is the result of test methods with poor reproducibility and repeatability. In short, the test methods (the CBR in particular) resulted in inconsistent data and subsequently poor results, making accurate predictions nearly impossible.

40|$|In {{the master}} thesis project of spring 2013, the {{adsorption}} dehydration {{of natural gas}} {{on a bed of}} SylobeadTM Molecular <b>Sieve</b> <b>Grade</b> 564 adsorbent pellets was to be modelled in MATLAB 7. 12. 0 (R 2011 a). This process {{is a part of the}} &# 197;sgard section at the K&# 229;rst&# 248; processing plant. The main goal of the project was to establish a dynamic rate based model for the adsorption column and to implement realistic equilibrium and mass transfer relationships for the K&# 229;rst&# 248; process conditions. The modelling was divided into two parts; the reactor model and the intrapellet model. The reactor model described the adsorption process from bulk gas phase to the surface of the adsorbent pellets, while the intrapellet model examined the adsorption behaviour of water within a single pellet. Several assumptions were made to simplify the problem. The models describe water being adsorbed from inert methane in an isothermal and isobaric adsorption column. The conditions of the system were provided by Statoil, while the kinetics and certain parameters of the process were determined by literature correlations or estimations. The resulting models seem to give appropriate presentations of the adsorption behaviour. Due to the many assumptions made, there may be inconsistencies compared to the real process at K&# 229;rst&# 248;. As there is little information on the adsorption behaviour inside the columns at K&# 229;rst&# 248; to compare the models to, there was conducted a parameter study to verify the expected adsorption behaviour and stability of the models. The problem that was to be solved was stiff and showed some numerical instability. The general trend in the parameter study seemed to be that the stability increased with slower adsorption mechanisms, either it be a reduction in the Langmuir constant, the mass transfer coefficient or increase axial dispersion. With the initial conditions set for the process, it seems like the adsorption column at K&# 229;rst&# 248; may be underutilised. Only 40 % of the column is saturated with water for the given cycle time. An approximate effectiveness factor, which describes the ratio between the actual adsorption rate occurring in the pellet and the adsorption rate that would occur if the entire pellet were at the surface conditions, was implemented in the reactor model. The implemented function was found from the intrapellet model with reduced mass transfer coefficient and pore dispersion, slowing down the adsorption process inside the pellet. The function resulted in an apparent effect on reactor model concentration profiles, indicating a reduced efficiency of the column. </p...|$|R
