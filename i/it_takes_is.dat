500|$|Although {{each of the}} film's key puppets {{required}} a small team of puppeteers to operate it, the most complex puppet of the production was Hoggle. Shari Weiser was inside the costume, while Hoggle's face was radio-controlled by Brian Henson and three other operators. Speaking in the Inside the Labyrinth documentary, Brian Henson explained that Weiser [...] "does all the body movement and her head is inside the head. However, the jaw is not connected to her jaw. Nothing that the face is doing has any connection with what she's doing with her face. The other {{four members of the}} crew are all radio crew, myself included." [...] Speaking of the challenges involved with performing Hoggle, Brian Henson said, [...] "five performers trying to get one character out of one puppet was a very tough thing.

500|$|In {{writing the}} script, the Breaking Bad staff decided {{early on that}} Gus would not speak much during the scene because they felt it was more {{dramatic}} that way and more appropriate for his character. Esposito felt the scene was a pivotal moment not only for his character, but for Gus' relationship with Walter, and a warning that Walter should continue to operate Gus' way or risk death. Regarding his character's murder of Victor, Esposito said: [...] "This had to be done. Someone did something, they got seen. ... It was about survival. This had to be done, but I {{could do it in}} a way that also sent a message to the people who weren't listening." [...] Bryan Cranston said he was not expecting the episode to take the direction it did. He called the scene [...] "painful, but beautifully crafted, and reasonably so", and commented on the contrast between Gus' calm demeanor and Walter's [...] "tap-dancing to stay alive". Cranston said of Esposito's performance, [...] "When he plays that bad character, his eyes go dead, and all <b>it</b> <b>takes</b> <b>is</b> to look into his eyes."

2500|$|In February 1997, Hudson and Grakal visited Starr in his Beverly Hills {{residence}} for a songwriting session. The {{result of this}} meeting was a song called [...] "My Love", which was promptly renamed to [...] "Everyday" [...] after Starr commented that McCartney had already used the title. The song was demoed under that name by Starr, Hudson, Grakal, and guitarist Steve Dudas. Happy with this session, the quartet followed it up with more recordings the following month, at Los Angeles's Whatinthewhatthe? Studios. There the musicians recorded two tracks: [...] "Mr. Double-It-Up" [...] and [...] "One", the latter of which, per Grakal's lyric sheet, was originally called [...] "All <b>It</b> <b>Takes</b> <b>Is</b> One". For these sessions, Starr played the drum set he had used during his time with the Beatles. In mid-to-late April, Starr and Hudson worked on Vertical Man as Starr began rehearsals for an upcoming tour. Before embarking on the tour (which would begin on 28 April), Starr recorded [...] "I'll Be Fine Anywhere". After the tour had finished on 8 June, Starr went on holiday, and returned in July.

2500|$|As {{summarized}} {{by the official}} press of his time, he [...] "put all his efforts into directing peasants toward the cottage industry", created [...] "home economics classes and adult education courses", and [...] "was the first to speak" [...] at educational conferences. He established a dairy factory, as well as shops for weavers, ropemakers, wainwrights and woodturners, and showcased their products at the 1900 World's Fair. Following Julius Kühn, Kalinderu insisted that the precondition of a [...] "rational economy" [...] was good livestock, so he inaugurated a freely accessible breeding program, also providing tenants with cultivars, or with beekeeping and sericulture implements. He also reintroduced reforestation and forest farming where bad practices had affected the environment. Kalinderu held {{the notion that the}} Romanian peasant was miserable for being illiterate, and that [...] "all <b>it</b> <b>takes</b> <b>is</b> a set of favorable circumstances for him to display [...] talents". The efforts to educate his tenants were conjugated with those of Steauas Haret, by then National Liberal Minister of Education, providing young students with work experience and physical culture, as well as inculcating in them a patriotic awareness. A significant portion of his time was spent on teaching peasants to diversify their diet, including providing hired hands with daily rations of vegetables, meat and milk. This helped to prevent outbursts of pellagra.|$|E
