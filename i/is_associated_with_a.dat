5|$|Adam used several leitmotifs in the ballet. This {{is a short}} musical {{phrase that}} <b>is</b> <b>associated</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> certain character, event, or idea. Adam's leitmotifs are heard several times {{throughout}} the ballet. There is a leitmotif associated with Giselle and another with Albrecht. Hilarion's motif marks his every entrance. It suggests the Fate theme in Beethoven's Fifth Symphony.|$|E
5|$|Another case of synesthesia is {{swimming}}-style synesthesia {{in which}} each swimming style <b>is</b> <b>associated</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> vivid experience of a color. These synesthetes {{do not need to}} perform the actual movements of a corresponding swimming style. To activate the concurrent experiences, it is sufficient to activate the concept of a swimming style (e.g., by presenting a photograph of a swimmer or simply talking about swimming).|$|E

A retrospective cohort study showed that salpingotomy <b>was</b> <b>associated</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> higher rate of subsequent intrauterine pregnancy; it <b>was</b> not <b>associated</b> <b>with</b> <b>an</b> increased risk of repeat ectopic pregnancy, but it <b>was</b> <b>associated</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> significant risk of persistent trophoblastic disease [1].|$|R

5|$|CT {{screening}} <b>is</b> <b>associated</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> {{high rate}} of falsely positive tests which may result in unneeded treatment. For each true positive scan there are about 19 falsely positives scans. Other concerns include radiation exposure {{and the cost of}} testing along with follow up. Research has not found two other available tests—sputum cytology or chest radiograph (CXR) screening tests—to have any benefit.|$|E
5|$|Disease-modifying {{treatments}} only {{reduce the}} progression {{rate of the}} disease but do not stop it. As multiple sclerosis progresses, the symptoms tend to increase. The disease <b>is</b> <b>associated</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> variety of symptoms and functional deficits that result {{in a range of}} progressive impairments and handicap. Management of these deficits is therefore very important.|$|E
5|$|Einstein {{concluded}} that each wave of frequency f <b>is</b> <b>associated</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> collection of photons with energy hf each, where h is Planck's constant.

5|$|In {{their summer}} camps, {{starting}} in January, male grey-headed flying foxes set up mating territories. Mating territories are generally 3.5 body lengths along branches. These flying foxes' neck glands enlarge in {{males in the}} mating season, and are used to mark the territories. The males fight to maintain their territories, and this <b>is</b> <b>associated</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> steep drop in the males' body condition during this time.|$|E
5|$|Long-term {{usage of}} non-steroidal {{anti-inflammatory}} drugs (NSAIDs) <b>is</b> <b>associated</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> reduced likelihood of developing AD. Evidence also supports {{the notion that}} NSAIDs can reduce inflammation related to amyloid plaques. No prevention trial has been completed. They {{do not appear to}} be useful as a treatment.

5|$|Obesity hypoventilation {{syndrome}} <b>is</b> <b>associated</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> reduced {{quality of}} life, {{and people with}} the condition incur increased healthcare costs, largely due to hospital admissions including observation and treatment on intensive care units. OHS often occurs together with several other disabling medical conditions, such as asthma (in 18–24%) and type 2 diabetes (in 30–32%). Its main complication of heart failure affects 21–32% of patients.|$|E

Precipitations and clouds are associated with the trowal, the projection on the Earth's surface of the tongue of warm air aloft formed during the occlusion process of the depression.|$|E

5|$|Antiretroviral {{treatment}} {{among people}} with HIV whose CD4 count ≤ 550 cells/µL is a very effective way to prevent HIV infection of their partner (a strategy known as treatment as prevention, or TASP). TASP <b>is</b> <b>associated</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> 10 to 20 fold reduction in transmission risk. Pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) with a daily dose of the medications tenofovir, with or without emtricitabine, is effective {{in a number of}} groups including {{men who have sex with}} men, couples where one is HIV positive, and young heterosexuals in Africa. It may also be effective in intravenous drug users with a study finding a decrease in risk of 0.7 to 0.4 per 100personyears.|$|E
5|$|Because {{consuming}} {{too much}} sodium increases risk of cardiovascular diseases, health organizations generally recommend that people reduce their dietary intake of salt. High sodium intake <b>is</b> <b>associated</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> {{greater risk of}} stroke, total cardiovascular disease and kidney disease. A reduction in sodium intake by 1,000mg per day may reduce cardiovascular disease by about 30 percent.
