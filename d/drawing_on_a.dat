5|$|At {{its peak}} {{at the end}} of the 19th century, the U.S. ice trade {{employed}} an estimated 90,000 people in an industry capitalised at $28 million ($660 million in 2010 terms), using ice houses capable of storing up to 250,000 tons (220 million kg) each; Norway exported a million tons (910 million kg) of ice a year, <b>drawing</b> <b>on</b> <b>a</b> network of artificial lakes. Competition had slowly been growing, however, in the form of artificially produced plant ice and mechanically chilled facilities. Unreliable and expensive at first, plant ice began to successfully compete with natural ice in Australia and India during the 1850s and 1870s respectively, until, by the outbreak of World War I in 1914, more plant ice was being produced in the U.S. each year than naturally harvested ice. Despite a temporary increase in production in the U.S. during the war, the inter-war years saw the total collapse of the ice trade around the world. Today, ice is occasionally harvested for ice carving and ice festivals, but little remains of the 19th-century industrial network of ice houses and transport facilities.|$|E
5|$|During its TGS 2014 presentation, the {{real-time}} demonstration footage {{was dubbed}} Final Fantasy XV: The Overture, which demonstrated the graphic capabilities in Luminous Studio {{and the effect}} of environmental changes on gameplay. While it was intended as a one-off presentation, the team said they were considering creating a second demo for release in Japan based on The Overture. A demo featuring the battle against the Astral Titan was featured at E3 2016: while <b>drawing</b> <b>on</b> <b>a</b> part of the game, the fight was tailored for the demo so it could be completed within a ten-minute window, with the full version having different victory requirements. A Japan-exclusive commercial demo dubbed Judgement Disc was released on November 11. Spanning the game's events up {{to the middle of the}} first chapter, it was designed to allow players to judge the game's merits.|$|E

25|$|While the {{measures}} of the internal angles in planar triangles always sum to 180°, a hyperbolic triangle has measures of angles that sum to less than 180°, and a spherical triangle has measures of angles that sum to more than 180°. A hyperbolic triangle {{can be obtained by}} <b>drawing</b> <b>on</b> <b>a</b> negatively curved surface, such as a saddle surface, and a spherical triangle can be obtained by <b>drawing</b> <b>on</b> <b>a</b> positively curved surface such as a sphere. Thus, if one draws a giant triangle {{on the surface of the}} Earth, one will find that the sum of {{the measures}} of its angles is greater than 180°; in fact it will be between 180° and 540°. In particular it is possible to draw a triangle on a sphere such that the measure of each of its internal angles is equal to 90°, adding up to a total of 270°.|$|E

25|$|The {{reception}} of Darwin's ideas continued to arouse scientific and religious debates, and wide public interest. Satirical cartoonists seized on animal ancestry {{in relation to}} other topical issues, <b>drawing</b> <b>on</b> <b>a</b> long tradition of identifying animal traits in humans. In Britain mass circulation magazines were droll rather than cruel, and thus presented Darwin's theory in an unthreatening way. Due to illness, Darwin began growing a beard in 1862, and when he reappeared in public in 1866 with a bushy beard, caricatures centred on Darwin and his new look contributed to a trend in which all forms of evolutionism were identified with Darwinism.|$|E

25|$|When the YOH-4A was {{eliminated}} by the Army, Bell went about {{solving the problem}} of marketing the aircraft. In addition to the image problem, the helicopter lacked cargo space and only provided cramped quarters for the planned three passengers. The solution was a redesigned fuselage, sleeker and aesthetically appealing, adding 16ft3 (0.45m3) of cargo space in the process. A Bell executive contributed to this redesign by <b>drawing</b> <b>on</b> <b>a</b> sketch two lines extending the fuselage to where it meets the tail. The redesign was designated Bell 206A, and Bell President Edwin J. Ducayet named it the JetRanger, denoting an evolution from the popular Model 47J Ranger.|$|E
25|$|St. Isidore Church {{was built}} between 1620 and 1664 {{by order of}} Empress Maria of Austria, {{daughter}} of Charles V of Germany and I of Spain, {{to become part of}} a school run by the Jesuits, which still exists today. Its dome is the first example of a dome <b>drawing</b> <b>on</b> <b>a</b> wooden frame covered with plaster, which, given its lightness, makes it easy to support the walls. It was the cathedral of Madrid between 1885 and 1993, which is the time it took to build the Almudena. The artworks inside were mostly burned during the Spanish Civil War, but it retained the tomb that holds the incorrupt body of Saint Isidore Laborer and the urn containing the ashes of his wife, Maria Torribia.|$|E
25|$|According to some late sources, the Sultan gave Francis {{permission}} {{to visit the}} sacred places in the Holy Land and even to preach there. All that can safely be asserted is that Francis and his companion left the Crusader camp for Acre, from where they embarked for Italy {{in the latter half}} of 1220. <b>Drawing</b> <b>on</b> <b>a</b> 1267 sermon by Bonaventure, later sources report that the Sultan secretly converted or accepted a death-bed baptism as a result of the encounter with Francis. The Franciscan Order has been present in the Holy Land almost uninterruptedly since 1217 when Brother Elias arrived at Acre. It received concessions from the Mameluke Sultan in 1333 with regard to certain Holy Places in Jerusalem and Bethlehem, and (so far as concerns the Catholic Church) jurisdictional privileges from Pope Clement VI in 1342.|$|E
