2500|$|The [...] {{railways}} {{were intended}} to take 4 ft [...] in (1,435 mm) <b>gauge</b> <b>vehicles</b> and allow a (second) running tolerance.|$|R
50|$|They {{are used}} {{extensively}} in Switzerland and in Spain, {{in the latter}} country to transport standard <b>gauge</b> <b>vehicles</b> on broad <b>gauge</b> lines.|$|R
5000|$|... in {{addition}} to the general ten standard gauge tracks a Special Gauge Display allows to show broad gauge and narrow <b>gauge</b> <b>vehicles.</b>|$|R
50|$|A {{special feature}} is the Zwickau model of {{tram-train}} operations. BOStrab-compliant RegioSprinters of the Vogtlandbahn run over tram tracks to the Zwickau central (Zentrum) tram stop. Tram-trains run from the Zwickau-Schwarzenberg line at street level to the Stadthalle tram stop. The metre-gauge line has a third rail fitted to allow standard <b>gauge</b> <b>vehicles</b> to continue to the Zentrum tram stop. The RegioSprinters are diesel-powered {{as most of the}} Vogtlandbahn network is not electrified and the vehicles are slightly narrower than normal because the tram line does not have sufficient clearance for full-width standard <b>gauge</b> <b>vehicles.</b>|$|R
50|$|The Märkische Museum Railway (Märkische Museums-Eisenbahn) or MME is a German railway {{society that}} {{was founded in}} order to show narrow <b>gauge</b> <b>vehicles</b> in {{operation}} on small branch lines.|$|R
5000|$|The {{museum has}} very limited space. The rolling stock {{collection}} is exhibited in Hall B and consists mainly of [...] metre <b>gauge</b> <b>vehicles.</b> Exhibited rolling stock includes the following: ...|$|R
2500|$|... the trams in Dresden, {{authorised}} in 1872 as horsecars, used [...] <b>gauge</b> <b>vehicles.</b> Converted to 600 V DC electric trams in 1893, {{they now}} use both gauges {{are within the}} tolerance for standard gauge.|$|R
5000|$|The South African {{national}} network employs [...] gauge, and has maximum width of 3048 mm and maximum height of 3962 mm, which {{is greater than}} the normal British loading gauge for standard <b>gauge</b> <b>vehicles.</b>|$|R

50|$|The three {{standard}} <b>gauge</b> <b>vehicles</b> remaining, BF343 (ex 780), BE346 (ex 750) and BE351 (ex 752), were railed from Port Pirie to Murwillumbah in 1991, {{following a}} sale from Australian National to the Northern Rivers Railroad.|$|R
50|$|The second {{generation}} {{can be easily}} distinguished by its round headshape made from GFK (glass-fiber reinforced plastic). These follow the DB design being produced since 2000 for other customers as well, for example a batch of 12 trains went to Athens (Greece) in meter gauge (ordered in 1999, delivered since 2003). With the {{second generation}} the available options for GTW trains had already expanded - meter <b>gauge</b> <b>vehicles</b> can be ordered in a 2.2 or 2.7 m width and the standard <b>gauge</b> <b>vehicles</b> in a 3.0 or 3.1 m width. Also the GTW 2/6 may be expanded with an additional bogie car making it a GTW 2/8.|$|R
50|$|Besides the Feldbahn contacts, {{the company}} {{produced}} Series 50 steam locomotives and standard rail <b>gauge</b> <b>vehicles</b> in the 1930s. The company produced diesel locomotives, and Series 44 and Series 50 steam engines, {{for the national}} railway company, Deutsche Reichsbahn-Gesellschaft.|$|R
50|$|More rarely, {{standard}} <b>gauge</b> <b>vehicles</b> {{are carried}} over narrow gauge tracks using adaptor vehicles; {{examples include the}} Rollbocke transporter wagon arrangements in Germany, Austria and the Czech Republic and the milk transporter wagons of the Leek and Manifold Valley Light Railway in England.|$|R
50|$|This class {{consisted}} of 15 vehicles, resembling the M cattle wagons though squashed and stretched {{to fit the}} narrower loading gauge while maintaining similar capacity to the broad <b>gauge</b> <b>vehicles.</b> Construction started in 1899, and the last vehicle entered service in 1917.|$|R
50|$|In 1998 the Deutsche Bahn had a {{total of}} 180 well wagons of 43 {{different}} types. They are used to move very large and heavy goods that would exceed the loading gauge on flat wagons. Such loads typically include: combine harvesters, generators or narrow <b>gauge</b> <b>vehicles.</b>|$|R
50|$|Thirty Two {{locomotives}} of {{this type}} were built, ten by Krauss Maffei and exported to Spain, and twenty-two built in Spain by Babcock & Wilcox. Being Iberian <b>gauge</b> <b>vehicles</b> the overall dimensions are larger, and the engines are 16 cylinder versions, giving a total engine power of 4000 hp.|$|R
50|$|The DGEG {{also owns}} a large library (in {{cooperation}} with the University Library of Dortmund (Universitätsbibliothek Dortmund) whose books can be loaned through any public library in Germany, and an archive {{on the subject of}} railways in Witten. The collection of narrow <b>gauge</b> <b>vehicles</b> was dissolved and museum operations on the Jagsttal line (Jagsttalbahn) had to be given up on the closure of the route.|$|R
50|$|Amongst {{them were}} seven steam {{locomotives}} (including the former DR 99 5633 and a Lenz-Typ i), five diesel locomotives (including the former DB Class V 29), six railbuses (including a Wismar railbus, a Wismar (Frankfurt version) {{and one from}} the Franzburger Kreisbahn, 28 passenger coaches, 6 luggage and mail vans and numerous goods wagons and works vehicles. The society even has some standard <b>gauge</b> <b>vehicles.</b>|$|R
50|$|At Lydney the Severn and Wye Railway, a 3 ft 6in gauge horse-operated line {{dating from}} about 1813, crossed {{the path of}} the SWR on the level. The SWR agreed to pay the S&WR £15,000 to be spent on {{upgrading}} their line for broad <b>gauge</b> <b>vehicles.</b> The S&WR dragged their feet, but in 1857 they put the work in hand. Their line continued to be worked by horses alone.|$|R
50|$|Since {{then the}} Lower Saxony Kleinbahn Museum (Niedersächsisches Kleinbahn-Museum) has emerged. At {{weekends}} from May to September and in December, regular services are {{run on the}} Bruchhausen-Vilsen-Asendorf route - predominantly with steam trains. Under the name Hoyaer Eisenbahn, a connecting service is operated on the Eystrup-Hoya-Bruchhausen-Vilsen-Syke route. In Bruchhausen-Vilsen station, standard <b>gauge</b> <b>vehicles</b> may {{be transferred to the}} narrow gauge section by means of rollbocks (Rollböcken) or transporter wagons (Rollwagen).|$|R

50|$|Some early onsets {{of winter}} brought {{distress}} to the FO. On those occasions, staff members had {{to clear the}} track. For that work, steam locomotives of type HG 3/4 were used until 1968. They were then replaced with modern diesel electric locomotives of class HGm 4/4. In the years when winter came early, locomotives and railcars sometimes had to be loaded onto standard <b>gauge</b> <b>vehicles,</b> to be transported from either Göschenen or Chur to Brig or vice versa, {{on the side of}} the pass where they were needed.|$|R
25|$|The {{first part}} of the project was to lay a third rail inside the {{existing}} tracks at Jacobacci and the Chubut Valley so that they could be used by the narrow <b>gauge</b> <b>vehicles.</b> New tracks were laid to extend the Chubut Valley line from Trelew to Rawson at the coast and westwards to Las Plumas. After floods destroyed much of the line in 1931-32, work began again in 1934 with new plans, with a 105 m-long bridge and a 110 m-long tunnel to be built. 1,000 labourers worked in the harsh Patagonian environment, many later settling.|$|R
40|$|As {{a general}} rule, the multi-body {{simulation}} models used by railway vehicle designers consider the wheelsets {{to be fully}} rigid, thus leading to possible errors when calculating the critical {{speed of the vehicle}} under study. This article suggests a wheelset model that takes into account wheelset flexibility for the study of dynamic stability. The model is simple to implement, easily parameterised, and can be applied to both conventional and variable gauge wheelsets. The parameters corresponding to wheelset flexibility that most influence the critical speed of high-speed and variable <b>gauge</b> <b>vehicles</b> are also analysed. Qc 20140315 </p...|$|R

50|$|Historically, {{the rail}} gauge has had {{considerable}} variations, with narrow gauge common in many early systems. However, most light rail systems are now standard gauge. An important advantage of standard gauge is that standard railway maintenance equipment {{can be used}} on it, rather than custom-built machinery. Using standard gauge also allows light rail vehicles to be delivered and relocated conveniently using freight railways and locomotives. Additionally, more manufacturers are able to produce standard <b>gauge</b> <b>vehicles,</b> reducing costs for rolling stock acquisition. Another factor favoring standard gauge is that low-floor vehicles are becoming popular, and there is generally insufficient space for wheelchairs to move between the wheels in a narrow gauge layout.|$|R

50|$|As {{railways}} {{developed during}} the 19th century, the military also discovered the utility of this new mode of transport. In {{stark contrast to the}} rudimentary road network of the time, the railways could transport large quantities of supplies, heavy equipment and troops rapidly and efficiently. For operations to the front lines the military developed its own system of field railways (Feldbahnen), usually built to a narrow gauge. In addition to the general advantages of narrow gauge railways - they took up less space and could have tighter curves, for example - narrow <b>gauge</b> <b>vehicles</b> and track were more easily transportable and could be quickly moved to conform as the location of the front line changed.|$|R
50|$|To {{carry out}} the work, the section of that line between Westerleigh and the Mangotsfield Junction with the A&GR was {{temporarily}} closed from 5 June 1844, and re-opened as a mixed gauge line—the first in the country—on 29 July 1844. During the closure the Coalpit Heath collieries were unable to send coal to the A&GR. The B&GR's own track was broad gauge with longitudinal timbers under the rails; the narrow gauge track was formed with cross-sleepers and 35 lb/yd fishbelly rails; the narrow rails were two inches higher than the broad gauge rails, and at the junctions the broad gauge rails were not interrupted, it being arranged that the narrow <b>gauge</b> <b>vehicles</b> would pass over the broad gauge rails.|$|R
50|$|Two tramcars (No. 1 and 2) {{and four}} {{trailers}} (No. 11 to 14) were built for passenger traffic in 1926 by Grazer Waggonfabrik. These cars were very generously dimensioned {{and at that}} time were the largest narrow <b>gauge</b> <b>vehicles</b> of Austria. By 1963 these were the only passenger vehicles in use, and after passenger traffic ceased they were sold to the Zillertal Railway. The trailers were altered and used as passenger vehicles, and the tramcars were dismantled and converted to trucks. The trailers were brought back to the Höllental Railway in 1986 and restored. A tramcar was reconstructed from the original bogies and one of the trailers. This reconstructed tramcar commenced operation in 2005.|$|R
