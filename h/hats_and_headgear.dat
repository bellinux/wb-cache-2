5000|$|Kay is {{well known}} for his array of {{elaborate}} <b>hats</b> <b>and</b> <b>headgear.</b> When appearing professionally (in concerts, interviews etc.) he has been referred to as [...] "the mad hatter" [...] for his love of headgear. It is said that he has many different hats that he wears at concerts and in public. The Indian Country Media Network has criticised him for wearing sacred First Nations regalia.|$|E
50|$|People in the Song dynasty {{never left}} their homes barefoot, and always {{had some sort}} of {{headgear}} on. Shops in the city specialized in certain types of <b>hats</b> <b>and</b> <b>headgear,</b> including caps with pointed tails, as well as belts and waistwraps. Only Buddhist monks shaved their heads and strolled about with no headgear or hat of any sort to cover their heads. For footwear, people could purchase leather shoes called 'oiled footwear', wooden sandals, hempen sandals, and the more expensive satin slippers.|$|E
50|$|During the 18th, 19th, {{and early}} 20th centuries, {{there was a}} booming {{international}} trade in plumes for extravagant women's <b>hats</b> <b>and</b> other <b>headgear.</b> Frank Chapman noted in 1886 that feathers {{of as many as}} 40 species of birds were used in about three-fourths of the 700 ladies' hats that he observed in New York City. This trade caused severe losses to bird populations (for example, egrets and whooping cranes). Conservationists led a major campaign against the use of feathers in hats. This contributed to passage of the Lacey Act in 1900, and to changes in fashion. The ornamental feather market then largely collapsed.|$|R
50|$|In the United States, civilians may {{salute the}} American flag by placing their right hand over their heart or by {{standing}} at attention during the playing {{of the national}} anthem or while reciting the American Pledge of Allegiance, or when the flag is passing by, as in a parade. Men and boys remove their <b>hats</b> <b>and</b> other <b>headgear</b> during the salute; religious headdress (and military headdress worn by veterans in uniform, who are otherwise civilians) are exempt. The nature of the headgear determines whether it is held in {{the left or right}} hand, tucked under the left arm, etc. However, if it is held in the right hand, the headgear is not held over the heart but the hand is placed in the same position it would be if it were not holding anything.|$|R

40|$|In this paper, {{we address}} the {{generation}} of semantic labels describing the headgear accessories carried out by people in a scene under surveillance, only using depth information obtained from a Time-of-Flight (ToF) camera placed in an overhead position. We propose a new method for headgear accessories classification based {{on the design of}} a robust processing strategy that includes the estimation of a meaningful feature vector that provides the relevant information about the people’s head and shoulder areas. This paper includes {{a detailed description of the}} proposed algorithmic approach, and the results obtained in tests with persons with <b>and</b> without <b>headgear</b> accessories, <b>and</b> with different types of <b>hats</b> <b>and</b> caps. In order to evaluate the proposal, a wide experimental validation has been carried out on a fully labeled database (that has been made available to the scientific community), including a broad variety of people <b>and</b> <b>headgear</b> accessories. For the validation, three different levels of detail have been defined, considering a different number of classes: the first level only includes two classes (hat/cap, and no hat/cap), the second one considers three classes (<b>hat,</b> cap <b>and</b> no hat/cap), and the last one includes the full class set with the five classes (no hat/cap, cap, small size hat, medium size <b>hat,</b> <b>and</b> large size <b>hat).</b> The achieved performance is satisfactory in every case: the average classification rates for the first level reaches 95. 25 %, for the second one is 92. 34 %, and for the full class set equals 84. 60 %. In addition, the online stage processing time is 5. 75 ms per frame in a standard PC, thus allowing for real-time operation...|$|R
