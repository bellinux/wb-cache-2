Typical diameters are 1/8", 3/16" [...] for residential and 3/16" [...] and 1/4" [...] for commercial applications. [...] There are many different types cable and strand (also referred to as wire rope). Cable and strand is available in <b>galvanized</b> <b>carbon</b> <b>steel,</b> type 304 stainless steel, or the highly corrosion resistant, type 316 stainless steel (best for coastal areas). The most common cable construction is 1x19 type construction strand, which is 19 cables twisted in a single bundle, whereas for example, 7x7 would be 7 cable bundles of 7 cables twisted. This type of stainless strand is designed to have limited stretch, as compared to galvanized, making it a good long term cable railing solution. It has long been used for yacht stays and guy wires, proving its outdoor durability and strength.|$|E

40|$|The Materials Consultation Group of SRTC has {{completed}} an external corrosion {{analysis of the}} Model 9975 packaging container for storage in K Reactor under ambient conditions {{for a period of}} 12 years. The 12 -year storage period includes two years for shipping and ten years for storage. Based on review of existing literature and stated building storage conditions, corrosion degradation of the 304 L Stainless Steel (SS) packaging container (drum and vessels) should be minimal during the 12 year time period. There may be visible corrosion on the <b>galvanized</b> <b>carbon</b> <b>steel</b> pallet due to initial drum handling. The visible corrosion will not be sufficient to cause significant degradation during the 12 -year storage period.

40|$|The {{aesthetic}} {{appeal and}} thermal capacity of ferritic stainless steels, {{together with the}} combination of good mechanical properties and excellent corrosion resistance, makes them ideal for exposed composite slabs using profiled decks. Cold-formed members are very slender, with a high resistance-to-weight ratio, so they are highly sensitive to buckling phenomena and the behaviour of these elements is very complex. Although the use of composite floor slabs with carbon steel sheeting is well established, a study into the structural performance of composite slabs using ferritic stainless steel decking is required due to the complex nonlinear behaviour of stainless steels, which is very different to carbon steel. This paper presents some tests characterizing the resistance of a deck profile which is approximately 60 mm in depth in the construction stage. Six simply supported tests (undergoing positive and negative bending moment) have been conducted for {{the determination of the}} flexural resistance of the decks, as part of a major European project looking at ferritic stainless steel in structural applications. These results are compared with some similar previous tests on <b>galvanized</b> <b>carbon</b> <b>steel</b> decks. The resistance of a continuous sheet over two or more spans under combinations of moment and shear loads at the internal supports is assessed by performing three continuous decking tests. Internal support tests have also been conducted to analyse the bending moment-support reaction for different spans and finally, some end support tests have been carried out to characterize the outer support reaction resistance of the decks. All the experimental results have been compared with the predicted ultimate loads in Standards, showing that expressions proposed in EN 1993 - 1 - 3 for carbon steel are, in general, applicable to ferritic stainless steel, although some changes may be introduced in order to get more accurate results and make ferritic stainless steel a competitive option in construction.

40|$|The paper aims at {{contributing}} to a better appraisal of the wedge-opened double cantilever beam method for testing the debonding toughness of adhesively bonded plates. The test specimens consisted of two plates of either hot-dip <b>galvanized</b> low <b>carbon</b> <b>steel</b> or alloy Al- 6082 -T 6 bonded with an epoxy-based adhesive. The classical method of crack length measurement by visual observation of the crack tip {{along the side of}} the specimen is compared with a method making use of displacement sensors for continuously monitoring the deflection of the plates. The variation of toughness with debonding rate was derived from the evolution of the debond length either with respect to a static wedge or with respect to a wedge advancing at a constant rate.

40|$|This {{study is}} a {{detailed}} failure analysis of <b>galvanized</b> high <b>carbon</b> <b>steel</b> wires, which developed coating cracks during the torsion test performed as a quality control {{at the end of}} the manufacturing process. Careful visual inspections showed that the cracks are already present in the coating before the torsion test. In order to explain the origin of these cracks, systematic metallographic investigations were performed by means of optical and scanning electron microscope on both the wires and the rods that have been cold drawn to produce the wire. The chemical composition of the galvanized coatings was evaluated by means of energy dispersive spectroscopy. Micro bidimensional X-ray diffraction experiments were also performed to measure the residual stresses in the galvanized coating. The results showed that the failure is related to two main factors: the relatively high content of silicon in the steel and the unsuitable cooling rate of the rods at the exit from the galvanizing bath. The mechanism proposed to explain the origin of the defects was supported by Finite Elements Methods simulations and verified with in-plant tests. The proper countermeasures were then applied and the problem successfully solved...|$|R

In particular, the automotive industry has developed {{a variant of the}} original process, called Friction Stir Spot Welding (FSSW), which has a strong interest related to the welding of aluminum alloys and dissimilar materials in thin sheets. Aluminum-steel welding is an actual challenge, being FSSW an alternative to produce these joints. However, the information available related to the influence of process parameters on the characteristics of aluminum-steel joints is scarce. The aim of this work was to study the effect of the pin length of the welding tool and its penetration depth, during friction stir spot welding (FSSW) of overlaps joints of AA 6063 with <b>galvanized</b> low <b>carbon</b> <b>steel.</b> FSSW was done by changing the pins length between 0. 65 and 1. 5 mm, and also by modifying the tool penetration depth in the welded joints.

40|$|An {{eddy current}} {{technique}} for determining parameters of a thin nonmagnetic conductive coating on a ferromagnetic conductive sheet metal is reported. Under several conditions the electrical impedance of a coil {{is shown to}} be a function of two independent quantities: the substrate permeability-to-conductivity ratio and the coating thickness-conductivity product. Thus, thickness or conductivity of the coating can be determined independently of the variations of magnetic and electrical properties of the substrate. Simple analytic formulae for the electrical impedance of circular and rectangular surface coils are obtained and applied to predict the behavior of split wound surface coils. The performance of the method was tested in the frequency range 20 - 100 kHz on 1. 5 mm thick low <b>carbon</b> <b>steel</b> sheers coated with 15 - 45 mu m thick aluminum layers and on two series of 0. 75 - 2. 0 mm thick hot dip <b>galvanized</b> low <b>carbon</b> <b>steel</b> sheets of 9 - 20 mu m coating thickness. The experiment was carried out using printed surface coils of rectangular and circular shape. Agreement between theory and experiment is excellent. The mathematical inversion carried out using the obtained formulae and the Newton-Raphson method takes about 450 ms on a Pentium 133 MHz PC. Discrepancies between the eddy current thicknesses and those obtained by other techniques were typically below 1 mu m. An uncertainty in the thickness or conductivity determination better than 2 % is obtained. The method has an extremely low sensitivity to variations in the substrate permeability. A large change in the substrate permeability, implying large changes in the coil electrical impedance, does not significantly influence the determined coating thickness. When the permeability change is about a factor of 10, additional errors in the thickness determination typically do not exceed 0. 5 mu m. (C) 1998 American Institute of Physics...|$|R
40|$|AbstractHot rolled, {{annealed}} or <b>galvanized</b> low <b>carbon</b> <b>steel</b> sheets display yield {{points in}} tensile testing. These {{are associated with}} deformation heterogeneities along the test specimen, known as Lüders bands, which cause an unacceptable surface appearance in steel sheet formed products. This problem is usually eliminated through a light cold rolling pass (“skin-pass”) in the material as a last step in its industrial manufacturing, imposing a reduction of thickness of about 1 – 2. 0 % on the sheet. Existing experimental results for these strain heterogeneities along the rolling direction are analyzed, as well as corresponding finite element analyses. The constitutive behavior of the material is described by a curve displaying an initial stress peak followed by the work hardening of the material. The FEAs led to distributions and shapes of Lüders bands in the sheets similar to the experimental ones. The bands nucleate intermitently and propagate {{from the surface of}} the sheets, at the initial contact region between the material and the rolls. For low and high friction between the material and the roll and for low sheet thickness reductions (0. 5 % and 1. 0 %), a limited influence of the roll diameter on the Lüders bands distribution was found. For sheet thickness reductions of 2. 0 % and higher, high friction between the roll and the material and large roll diameters, the distribution of LBs in the sheets was different from that obtained for small roll diameters and low friction between the rolls and the material. Increasing thickness reductions in the skin-pass led to changes in the Lüders bands distribution, involving an increasing homogeneity in the deformation. It is suggested that the critical thickness reduction in the skin-pass is associated to a minimum volume fraction of material deformed above a certain strain level...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. The {{separator}} {{is one of}} {{the most}} important parts in PEM fuel cells. Stainless steels are widely used as separator for its good mechanical properties and mass production. However, for a good chemical compatibility, stainless steels need to have high chromium content or surface treatment, which makes separator high cost. Low cost of separator is important for commercial use. In this study, conventional low <b>carbon</b> <b>steel</b> is used as base metal of separator. Low <b>carbon</b> <b>steel</b> is low at cost, but has poor chemical properties for separator. For a good corrosion resistance, low <b>carbon</b> <b>steel</b> needs to be surface treated. To make a uniform surface treated layer on low <b>carbon</b> <b>steel,</b> chromium is conventionally electroplated on the steel and thermally nitrided. Surface treated low <b>carbon</b> <b>steel</b> is investigated using microstructure and element analysis tools. Interfacial contact resistance and polarization test is applied for the properties of fuel cell separator. The results show that chromium nitrided layer uniformly formed on low <b>carbon</b> <b>steel.</b> And the surface treated steel showed a good corrosion resistance as a separator...|$|R
