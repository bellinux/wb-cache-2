5|$|After the {{occupation}} of Veracruz, many military personnel received the Medal of Honor, an unusually high number that somewhat diminished {{the prestige of the}} award. The army presented one, nine went to marines and 46 were bestowed upon naval personnel. During World War I, Butler, then a major, attempted to return his medal, explaining he had done nothing to deserve it. The medal was returned with orders to keep it and to wear <b>it</b> <b>as</b> <b>well.</b>|$|E

Some tanks had a vertically stabilised TOP-1 gun telescopic sight. Ammunition stowage for the main gun was improved from 122 rounds to 147. In 1938, the cylindrical turret was replaced with a conical turret, with the same 45mm model 1934 gun. Some T-26s mod. 1938/1939, equipped with radio set, had a PTK commander's panoramic sight.|$|E

5|$|Higgins' song writing {{grew out}} of a desire to express her {{emotions}} when she was at school and her lyrics describe her feelings about her own life and relationships. The piano was the first instrument she learned to play, and she continues to use <b>it</b> <b>as</b> <b>well</b> as digital pianos including a Roland RD-300SX, RD-700 and KR-15. She also uses guitars extensively in her music particularly when touring, due to their portable nature and favours the Australian brand, Maton.

5|$|It is a {{particularly}} poignant melody that should play with an audience's emotions. The mistress clearly {{knew what she was}} doing sleeping with an older man, and yet there is something expletive about <b>it</b> <b>as</b> <b>well.</b> Eva's bitchiness should be enjoyed by an audience, but they should also be investing in the plight of a young girl's eviction. The narrative of this section is so well structured that it is obvious the journey of the mistress is complete by her exit. This allows the audience to invest in a single moment while also learning more about Eva and Peron's character as they move forward in the story.|$|E

5|$|Some modern genealogical {{researchers}} consider John {{a possible}} father to Theodora Axouchina, wife of Emperor Alexios I Megas Komnenos of Trebizond (r. 1204–1222), {{but that is}} conjectural: the family name Axouchina is ascribed to her because her eldest son, the Trebizondian emperor John I Megas Komnenos Axouchos (r. 1235–1238), bore <b>it</b> <b>as</b> <b>well.</b>|$|E
5|$|The series' concept {{originated}} in 1999 when Taniguchi {{was working on}} Infinite Ryvius. He wanted to create another series that would contain themes similar to <b>it,</b> <b>as</b> <b>well</b> as new ones centered mostly on how people adapted to the 21st century. A manga adaptation of s-CRY-ed, drawn by Yasunari Toda, was serialized in Akita Shoten's Weekly Shōnen Champion. A novelization by Kazuho Hyodo has been published. Additionally, a two-part recollection film was released by Sunrise. Both the anime and the manga have also seen English release.|$|E

The Foreurs failed to win a game in the 1998 Memorial Cup tournament, however, and finished in last place.|$|E

5|$|After the Iberian king Pharasmanes I had his son Rhadamistus (r.51–55AD) invade Armenia to depose the Roman client king Mithridates, Vologeses I of Parthia (r. c.51–77AD) {{planned to}} invade and place his brother, the later Tiridates I of Armenia, on the throne. Rhadamistus was {{eventually}} driven from power, and, {{beginning with the}} reign of Tiridates, Parthia would retain firm control over Armenia—with brief interruptions—through the Arsacid Dynasty of Armenia. Even {{after the fall of}} the Parthian Empire, the Arsacid line lived on through the Armenian kings. However, not only did the Arsacid line continue through the Armenians, <b>it</b> <b>as</b> <b>well</b> continued through the Georgian kings with the Arsacid dynasty of Iberia, and for many centuries afterwards in Caucasian Albania through the Arsacid Dynasty of Caucasian Albania.|$|E
5|$|As Mr. Burns {{fights for}} {{life at the}} hospital, the Springfield police are working to find his assailant. Smithers wakes {{up the next morning}} and vaguely remembers {{shooting}} someone the night before in a drunken rage. Guilt-ridden, Smithers heads for a local church, and is promptly arrested when the confessional {{turns out to be a}} police sting. While passing the media on his way to the police station, Smithers makes a witty remark Sideshow Mel recognizes from an episode of Pardon My Zinger that aired at the same time as the shooting. Mel realizes Smithers must have watched <b>it</b> <b>as</b> <b>well,</b> giving him an alibi. As Smithers' memory clears, it turns out he had actually shot Jasper in his wooden leg. Meanwhile, the townsmen pull down the sun-blocker, which crushes Shelbyville to their delight.|$|E

5|$|Informed of the revolt, al-Hajjaj {{requested}} reinforcements {{from the}} Caliph, {{but was unable}} to stop the advance of the rebel army, which is reported to have numbered 33,000 cavalry and 120,000 infantry. On 24 or 25 January 701, Ibn al-Ash'ath overwhelmed al-Hajjaj's advance guard at Tustar. At the news of this defeat, al-Hajjaj withdrew to Basra and then, as he could not possibly hold the city, left <b>it</b> <b>as</b> <b>well</b> for nearby al-Zawiya. Ibn al-Ash'ath entered Basra on 13 February 701. Over the next month, a series of skirmishes were fought between the forces of Ibn al-Ash'ath and al-Hajjaj, in which the former generally held the upper hand. Finally, in early March, the two armies met for a pitched battle. Ibn al-Ash'ath initially prevailed, but in the end al-Hajjaj's Syrians, under Sufyan ibn Abrad, carried off a victory. Many rebels fell, especially among the qurrāʾ, forcing Ibn al-Ash'ath to withdraw to Kufa, taking with him the Kufan troops and the élite of the Basran cavalry. At Kufa, Ibn al-Ash'ath found the citadel occupied by Matar ibn Najiya, an officer from al-Mada'in, and was forced to take it by assault.|$|E
5|$|Meanwhile, Lobengula {{moved to}} the north-east, now well out of the Company's reach for the {{foreseeable}} future. However, his sickness, {{which turned out to}} be smallpox, sharply intensified and eventually killed him on 22 or 23 January 1894. With the king dead, Mjaan, the most senior of the izinDuna, took command of the Matabele. Mjaan was an old man, and his only son had been killed in the war. He wished to make peace. In late February 1894, he convened an indaba at which he and his contemporaries met with James Dawson, a trader known to them for many years, who offered the olive branch on behalf of the Company. The izinDuna unanimously accepted. They also told the trader what had happened to the Shangani Patrol, and led him to the battle site to survey <b>it,</b> <b>as</b> <b>well</b> as to examine and identify the largely skeletonised bodies of the soldiers, which still lay where they had fallen. Dawson was the first non-Matabele to learn of the last stand.|$|E
5|$|Other {{locations}} used {{included the}} real-life new town of Hemel Hempstead, Hertfordshire, which was under construction {{at the time}} and doubled for the fictional new town of Winnerden Flats. Other scenes were shot in London including Trafalgar Square, where the police agreed to hold up the traffic for just two minutes to allow Guest to take shots of trucks ferrying equipment through London to Winnerden Flats, and in the foyer of the House of Lords for the scene where Quatermass first meets Vincent Broadhead. The climactic scenes of the hurricane caused by the explosion of the Winnerden Flats complex were shot on the South Downs near Brighton. A minor mishap occurred during the filming of this scene when the wind machines blew Brian Donlevy's toupée off his head and the crew had to chase after <b>it.</b> <b>As</b> <b>well</b> as shooting on location, Guest and his crew made use of Stages 2 and 5 of the New Elstree Studios, the first Hammer production to shoot there. This was production designer Bernard Robinson's first film for Hammer; he went on to become their regular set designer, working on many Hammer films.|$|E
