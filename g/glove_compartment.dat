25|$|The Bel Air {{utilized}} a stainless-steel {{belt and}} rocker molding, identifying signature {{on the rear}} fenders, a <b>glove</b> <b>compartment</b> light and power tailgate on 9-passenger wagons to distinguish itself from the lower-priced Biscayne series.|$|E
25|$|The usual Daimler luxury {{fittings}} included: {{heating and}} ventilating equipment, windscreen washer, cigar lighter, lockable <b>glove</b> <b>compartment,</b> two courtesy lights when any door is opened, special reading lights for passengers, spring-balanced lid for the luggage compartment which is illuminated {{when the car}} sidelights are in use, etc.|$|E
25|$|Flat roof wagons were {{no longer}} {{manufactured}} worldwide, and instead the raised roof is used for both the Legacy wagon and Legacy Outback. Daytime running lamps were introduced on US models starting with the 2000 Model Year. Cabin air filters were available starting with 2001 models installed underneath and behind the <b>glove</b> <b>compartment</b> door.|$|E

25|$|The {{very first}} 1999 Acura TL (2G) {{rolled off the}} {{assembly}} line on August 4, 1998. The only option on the sedan was a CD-based navigation system. The 1999 TL's navigation system stored the maps in zones; there were 5 different zones for the U.S. Starting with this generation, cabin air filters (also known as pollen filters) were installed as standard equipment and are located behind the <b>glove</b> <b>compartment.</b>|$|E
25|$|Suspension on the 1965 models was redesigned. Replacing {{the former}} leaf-spring rear {{suspension}} {{was a new}} three-link system, with coil springs. Interiors featured a new instrument panel and two-way key system were introduced. The introduction of two keys was for valet parking, in that the rounded head key would only open the trunk or locked <b>glove</b> <b>compartment,</b> while the squared head key would unlock the doors and the ignition.|$|E
25|$|The {{interior}} was a Cassini hallmark featuring a special black fabric with copper metal {{buttons on the}} individual adjustable and reclining front seats and on the padded door panels, that was set off by extra thick copper carpeting. Additional copper accents were on the steering wheel, door pulls, and on the instrument panel. Embroidered Cassini medallions were featured on the headrests. The <b>glove</b> <b>compartment</b> door, trunk lid, front fender, and hood featured Cassini's signature.|$|E

2500|$|Coupland {{lived in}} Redmond, Washington {{for six weeks}} and Palo Alto, Silicon Valley for four months researching the lives of Microsoft workers. [...] "It was a 'Gorillas in the Mist' kind of observation… What do they put in their <b>glove</b> <b>compartments?</b> What snack foods do they eat? What posters are on their bedroom walls?" [...] Friends from Microsoft and Apple also helped him with research.|$|R
50|$|The Ambassador Nova was {{launched}} in 1990 in two variants—a 55 bhp petrol-powered Deluxe version and a 37 bhp diesel-powered Diesel DX version. The Ambassador Nova received a newly designed steering wheel, new steering column, better brakes and electricals. The brake pedal was now top-hinged, while the earlier central instrumentation flanked by two <b>glove</b> <b>compartments</b> {{was replaced by a}} more conventional setup with a single glovebox. It also had some cosmetic changes which included a new radiator grille, while retaining the square turn signals of the earlier Mark IV.|$|R
25|$|The {{interior}} featured raised seating in {{the second}} row, a hard point on the passenger’s side of the center console to provide support {{for a range of}} optional accessories (e.g., an optional shopping bag holder), rear-seat table, waste basket and cargo net integrated into the rear seat backs. Standard interior features included a coat hook integrated {{into the side of the}} front passenger's headrest, <b>glove</b> <b>compartment</b> with pen holder and toll card, configurable center console and rear seating with a two position backrests — one position favoring cargo and the other favoring comfort.|$|E
25|$|According to Dunn's testimony, Davis {{threatened}} to kill him, then opened his car door and pointed {{what appeared to be}} a shotgun at him. Dunn, who had a concealed weapons permit, took a handgun out of his <b>glove</b> <b>compartment</b> and started firing at Davis' door, hitting him in the legs, lungs, and aorta. As the SUV backed up to evade his gunshots, Dunn opened his own door and continued firing at the car, later testifying that he still feared for his safety as well as that of Rouer, who was to return to the vehicle imminently.|$|E
25|$|The 'Spirit of America' Nova was {{introduced}} in 1974. In anticipation of the US bicentennial in 1976, the limited edition Nova Coupes were painted white and featured blue and red accent stripes as well as red and blue interior carpets and fabrics. Oldsmobile and Buick entered the compact car market; both the Apollo and Omega debuted, using the same bodystyles from the Nova lineup. Additional options were included on these Nova-like models, such as lighting under the dashboard and in the <b>glove</b> <b>compartment.</b> Pontiac's final GTO of this era {{was based on a}} facelifted 1974 Ventura coupe, itself based on the Nova, but fitted with a shaker hoodscoop from the Trans Am.|$|E
5000|$|According to Bridges, at {{the first}} sound of gunfire, he and fellow student Mikael Gross, unbeknownst to each other, ran to their {{vehicles}} to retrieve their personally-owned firearms placed in their <b>glove</b> <b>compartments.</b> Mikael Gross, a police officer from Grifton, North Carolina retrieved a 9 mm pistol and body armor. [...] Bridges, a county sheriff's deputy from Asheville, North Carolina retrieved his [...]357 Magnum pistol from beneath the driver's seat of his Chevrolet Tahoe. Bridges and Gross approached Odighizuwa from different angles, with Bridges yelling at Odighizuwa to drop his gun. Odighizuwa then dropped his firearm and was subdued by several other unarmed students, including Ted Besen and Todd Ross.|$|R
5000|$|The Eldorado was {{redesigned}} but rode on {{the same}} 129.5 in wheelbase. The elevated tailfins were removed, with fins planed flat, and sharp, distinct body lines replaced the rounded look. Also new were a straight rear bumper and vertical lamp clusters. The headlight pairs switched from horizontal to vertical, thus permitting a wider grille. Curved frameless side windows appeared with a tempered glass backlight. New standard features included lamps for luggage and <b>glove</b> <b>compartments</b> and front and rear safety belts. Power was still supplied by the 340 horsepower [...] V8. Perimeter frame construction allowed repositioning the engine six inches forward in the frame, thus lowering the transmission hump and increasing interior room.|$|R
25|$|With their warrant Greggs, Freamon and Bunk {{perform a}} stop-and-search of Chris and Snoop. Greggs finds the wiring for the hidden <b>glove</b> box <b>compartment</b> and discovers the {{concealed}} firearms within. They arrest {{them for the}} weapons charge and then have the grand jury serve a warrant for blood and hair samples once they are in custody.|$|R
25|$|Inside, {{headrests}} {{were now}} standard equipment {{and a new}} instrument panel included square instruments replacing the round instruments of previous years along with a push-button operated ashtray and rotary <b>glove</b> <b>compartment</b> knob, as well as heating/air conditioning controls relocated {{from the center of}} the dash to the left of the steering wheel near the lights and wiper switches. The high-beam lights indicator was a red rocket located on the dash. Also new was a steering column-mounted ignition switch that also locked the steering wheel when not in use – a feature found on all 1969-model General Motors passenger cars, a year before locking steering columns were required by federal mandate starting in 1970.|$|E
25|$|In the 2004 model year, the XG350 {{received}} larger front brakes (discs {{went from}} 10.9- to 12-inch), {{which in turn}} required a 16-inch spare tire as standard equipment, replacing the 'space-saver' design used since 2001. Also new this year were restyled front and rear bumpers, bodyside moldings, headlights (now with HID availability), driving lights, tail lamps, grille, and deck lid with recessed license plate holder. The high-mounted stop lamp in the rear window went to an all-new LED design. The interior wood-tone trim changed to a lighter shade, <b>glove</b> <b>compartment</b> and storage bins were now covered in charcoal gray material (formerly black), the door-mounted power window switch panels now matched the interior color (previously, they were high-gloss wood-tone), recessed seat tethers allowed for secure installation of child seats in all three rear seat positions, and the trunk hinges were now supported using hydraulic pistons. Standard equipment leather upholstery was available in solid deep charcoal or a two-tone finish featuring a tan interior with brown dashboard/center console and upper door trim. The L versions were equipped with specific 12-spoke silver-painted allow rims featuring center caps covering the lug nuts. Minor equipment changes inside included redesigned levers for the hood release and tilt steering column, an updated cruise control switch, a recessed trunk pull-down handle, and leather trim around the console armrest tray.|$|E
500|$|In the video, Usher {{sits in a}} car {{outside a}} house where his ex-girlfriend is being {{intimate}} with another man. He pulls a gun out of his <b>glove</b> <b>compartment</b> and agonizes {{over whether or not}} to enter the house. After ruminating over the different scenarios, Usher drives off {{at the end of the}} video. Jason Lipshut of Billboard found the [...] "narrative arc" [...] for the video to be [...] "a bit perplexing". Jeff Lapointe of MTV News viewed that it [...] "depicts the darker side of human nature as Usher drives up to his girlfriend/ex-girlfriends house to discover another vehicle, another man, another side of his love. In the realization of fury and anger, images distort Usher's reality with thoughts of taking his gun and shooting the intruder. Thoughts of running away with the girl. Thoughts of driving off to never be seen." ...|$|E
5000|$|Inside the cars, a {{completely}} new instrument panel with full instrumentation (sans idiot lights) was installed, although the designers {{were not able to}} integrate the available air conditioning into the panel; the evaporator and vents were still hung beneath the dash in a space-robbing box. For the ladies, an [...] "Exclusive Beauty Vanity" [...] with a mirror and makeup tray was fitted in the <b>glove</b> box <b>compartment</b> on most models. Just in case anyone would forget that Studebaker's glove box contained the vanity feature, the fronts were adorned with the word [...] "Vanity" [...] in golden script.|$|R
2500|$|A new {{option for}} 1958 was a [...] "Trans-Portable" [...] radio {{that could be}} removed from the {{instrument}} panel through the <b>glove</b> <b>compartment</b> and used as a portable radio for beaches, picnics, etc. thanks to portable batteries.|$|E
2500|$|The basic {{patented}} design {{allowed a}} series of features to be deployed on the spar-frame that would later allow quick development of new models. The original Vespa featured a rear pillion seat for a passenger, or optionally a storage compartment. The original front protection [...] "shield" [...] was a flat piece of aero metal; later, this developed into a twin skin to allow additional storage behind the front shield, similar to the <b>glove</b> <b>compartment</b> in a car. The fuel cap was located underneath the (hinged) seat, which saved {{the cost of an}} additional lock on the fuel cap or need for additional metal work on the smooth skin.|$|E
2500|$|It {{featured}} special color-matched fender flares {{and front}} air dam, 'Rally-Tuned' suspension with [...] {{front and rear}} sway bars, high-effort power steering gears, front and rear three-way adjustable [...] "Strider" [...] Gabriel (brand name) shock absorbers, heavy-duty semi-metallic [...] front disk brakes with ribbed 10x1.2-inch (254x30.5mm) rear drum brakes, unique AMX grille, [...] "Turbocast II" [...] 14x7-inch aluminum road wheels with ER60x14 Goodyear [...] "Flexten" [...] GT radial RWL (raised white letter) tires, rear spoiler, special striping package, hood and door decals, console shifted automatic or manual transmission with 'Rallye Gauge' package (total of eight dials including an intake-manifold vacuum gauge), as well as simulated aluminum dash overlays with AMX badge on the <b>glove</b> <b>compartment</b> door.|$|E
2500|$|The 1996 {{model year}} {{was the first time}} that the Taurus did not have an {{optional}} engine. The base G and GL had the 3.0L Vulcan V6, which was a carryover from the previous model. The top of the line LX, however, got the new 3.0L DOHC Duratec 30 V6, which produced [...] and was developed specifically for this model. When Ford rearranged the Taurus models for 1998, the Vulcan became the standard engine, and the Duratec became optional on all models. However, it was only available on the SE for 1999. Vulcan-equipped models came with the 4-speed AX4S automatic transmission, while Duratec equipped models got the 4-speed AX4N transmission. However, some Vulcan-equipped models randomly received the AX4N transmission for no apparent reason. Ford also deleted some features for the 1999 model year, in order to lower the price about one thousand dollars, and possibly boost sales. Some deleted features included the floor courtesy lamps and <b>glove</b> <b>compartment</b> lamp.|$|E
2500|$|Unlike {{the first}} Escort (which was {{developed}} by Ford of Britain), the second generation was developed jointly between the UK and Ford of Germany. Codenamed [...] "Brenda" [...] during its development, it used the same mechanical components as the Mark I. The 940cc engine was still offered in Italy where the smaller engine attracted tax advantages, but in the other larger European markets in Europe it was unavailable. The estate and van versions used the same panelwork as the Mark I, but with the Mark II front end and interior. The car used a revised underbody, which had been introduced as a running change during {{the last six months}} production of the Mark I. Rear suspension still sat on leaf springs though some contemporaries such as the Hillman Avenger had moved on to coil springs. The car came in for criticism for its lack of oddments space, with a <b>glove</b> <b>compartment</b> only available on higher end models, and its stalk-mounted horn.|$|E
2500|$|On November 27, 1978, Washington, D.C. police detectives {{received}} {{a tip from}} a reliable source describing a man known as [...] "Bandit" [...] who was selling illegal narcotics stored {{in the trunk of}} his car. The informant gave the location of the car and a description of both car and driver. The detectives discovered the parked car, and called for a computer check on the car, which confirmed that the car's owner matched the description and used the alias [...] "Bandit". Shortly thereafter they observed the car being driven by a man matching the description. They stopped the car and ordered the driver out. After noticing a bullet on the front seat, they searched the <b>glove</b> <b>compartment</b> and discovered a pistol, at which point they arrested the driver, identified as Albert Ross. A detective then opened the trunk and discovered a closed brown paper bag. He opened the bag and found numerous bags containing white powder, which were later identified as heroin. During a later search, they also found and opened a zippered red leather pouch, which contained $3,200 in cash. No warrant was obtained for these searches.|$|E
2500|$|When {{video footage}} was {{initially}} released, {{it did not}} contain audio, although Chicago Police dashboard cameras should automatically record audio when the video recording is activated. According to a CPD video, [...] "The in-car camera system automatically engages both the audio and the video recording when the vehicles' emergency roof lights are activated" [...] and each vehicle has a front and rear camera and microphone. City officials initially blamed a technical problem. It was later revealed that the audio recording equipment in officer Van Dyke's vehicle had been [...] "intentionally damaged" [...] according to records from police technicians. Another car's audio was disabled because the microphones were in the <b>glove</b> <b>compartment</b> with the batteries inserted backwards.
