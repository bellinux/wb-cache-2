This small, hard-won airfield was a critical point in the entire island chain, and both military sides strategically considered that control of the airbase offered potential control of the local battle area airspace. In fact, Henderson Field and the aircraft based upon it soon resulted in telling effects on the movement of Japanese <b>forces</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Solomon Islands and in the attrition of Japanese air <b>forces</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> South Pacific Area.
