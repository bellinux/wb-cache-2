25|$|Identification of {{the exact}} causes usually begins with a {{thorough}} medical history, including detailed questioning about symptoms, bowel habits, diet, medication and other medical problems. Digital rectal examination is performed to assesses resting pressure and voluntary contraction (maximum squeeze) of the sphincter complex and puborectalis. Anal sphincter defects, rectal prolapse, and abnormal perineal descent may be detected. Anorectal physiology tests assess {{the functioning of the}} anorectal anatomy. Anorectal manometry records the pressure exerted by the anal sphincters and puborectalis during rest and during contraction. The procedure is also able to assess sensitivity of the anal canal and rectum. Anal electromyography tests for nerve damage, which is often associated with obstetric injury. Pudendal nerve terminal motor latency tests for damage to the pudendal motor nerves. Proctography, also known as <b>defecography,</b> shows how much stool the rectum can hold, how well the rectum holds it, and how well the rectum can evacuate the stool. It will also highlight defects {{in the structure of the}} rectum such as internal rectal intussusception. Dynamic pelvic MRI, also called MRI <b>defecography</b> is an alternative which is better for some problems but not as good for other problems. Proctosigmoidoscopy involves the insertion of an endoscope (a long, thin, flexible tube with a camera) into the anal canal, rectum and sigmoid colon. The procedure allows for visualization of the interior of the gut, and may detect signs of disease or other problems that could be a cause, such as inflammation, tumors, or scar tissue. Endoanal ultrasound, which some consider to be the gold standard for detection of anal canal lesions, evaluates the structure of the anal sphincters, and may detect occult sphincter tears that otherwise would go unseen.|$|E

50|$|Cinedefecography is a {{technique}} that is an evolution of defecagography. The defecation cycle is recorded as a continuous series rather than individual still radiographs.

50|$|Anal {{sphincter}} dyssynergia {{tends to}} be one of the most predicted diagnoses with a patient suffering from symptoms like chronic constipation and inability to control bowel movements. Diagnosis techniques for dyssynergia have been known to be expensive and aren’t commonly offered at some countrywide hospitals. Fortunately, there are still special tests and examinations that can be done given the proper medical care and treatment to properly detect and diagnose dyssynergia.

50|$|Megarectum {{is a large}} rectum as {{a result}} of {{underlying}} nerve supply abnormalities or muscle dysfunction, which remains after disimpaction of the rectum. The Principles of Surgery textbook describes any rectum that can hold more than 1500cc of fluid as a megarectum. The term megarectum is also used for a large rectal mass on rectal examination, a wide rectum on an abdominal x-ray, the presence of impaired rectal sensation or the finding of large maximal rectal volumes on anorectal manometry.

50|$|Pelvic floor {{dysfunction}} can {{be diagnosed}} by history and physical exam, {{though it is}} more accurately graded by imaging. Historically, fluoroscopy with <b>defecography</b> and cystography were used, though modern imaging allows the usage of MRI to complement and sometimes replace fluoroscopic assessment of the disorder, allowing for less radiation exposure and increased patient comfort, though an enema is required the evening before the procedure. Instead of contrast, ultrasound gel is used during the procedure with MRI. Both methods assess the pelvic floor at rest and maximum strain using coronal and sagittal views. When grading individual organ prolapse, the rectum, bladder and uterus are individually assessed, with prolapse of the rectum {{referred to as a}} rectocele, bladder prolapse through the anterior vaginal wall a cystocele, and small bowel an enterocele.|$|E
40|$|OBJECTIVE: <b>Defecography</b> may {{be useful}} in {{pre-operative}} assessment of patients with genital prolapse. <b>Defecography</b> is an invasive and embarrassing procedure for patients and little effort has been made to optimalise selection criteria for <b>defecography.</b> This study investigated whether discrimination of high and low probability of abnormal <b>defecography</b> is possible based on the quantified findings from patient history, pelvic examination and a validated questionnaire. DESIGN: Prospective observational study. SETTING: Three teaching hospitals in The Netherlands. POPULATION: Eighty-two patients undergoing surgical correction of uterine prolapse Stages 2 - 4. METHODS: A history and pelvic examination were obtained from all patients. A validated questionnaire was used to assess the presence of defecation and micturition symptoms. Using multivariate logistic regression analyses with receiver operating characteristic curves, a diagnostic model to predict the presence of an abnormal <b>defecography</b> was systematically constructed and validated. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE: Presence of abnormal finding at <b>defecography.</b> RESULTS: The most important predictors for abnormal <b>defecography</b> were prolapse of the posterior vaginal wall, history of abdominal or pelvic surgery and the presence of constipation. With these variables, a prediction rule could be constructed which predicted the prevalence of an abnormal <b>defecography</b> (area under curve = 0. 73; 95 % CI 0. 61 - 0. 83).

40|$|<b>Defecography</b> is a {{study to}} assess {{anorectal}} function during evacuation. To investigate the value of fluoroscopic <b>defecography</b> in directing diagnostic and therapeutic management in children with defecation disorders. We reviewed all fluoroscopic <b>defecography</b> studies performed (2003 - 2009) in children with defecation problems and normal anorectal motility studies. Results were classified into three groups: (1) normal pelvic floor function; (2) pelvic floor dyssynergia, including incomplete relaxation of pelvic musculature, inconsistent change in anorectal angle and incomplete voluntary evacuation; (3) structural abnormality, including excessive pelvic floor descent with an intra-rectal intussusception, rectocele or rectal prolapse. We included 18 patients (13 boys, median age 9. 1 years). Indication for fluoroscopic <b>defecography</b> was chronic constipation in 56 %, fecal incontinence in 22 % and rectal prolapse in 22 %. <b>Defecography</b> showed pelvic floor dyssynergia in 9 children (50 %), a structural abnormality in 4 (22 %) and normal pelvic floor function in 5 (28 %). In 12 children (67 %) the outcome of fluoroscopic <b>defecography</b> directly influenced therapeutic management. After <b>defecography</b> 4 children (22 %) were referred for anorectal biofeedback treatment, 4 children (22 %) for surgery, 2 children (11 %) for additional MR <b>defecography,</b> and 1 child to the psychology department, and medication was changed in 1 child. In 6 children (33 %) the result did not change the management. In 9 children (75 %) the change of management was successful.

40|$|Background: {{complaints}} of defecation disorders in older patients {{living at home}} is an emerging problem. Little is known about radiological examination of this population. Objective: this study aimed to analyse the yield of <b>defecography</b> in women older than 75 years, living at home and complaining of defecation disorders. Design and settings: prospective study of patients referred to a radiology department in a tertiary-care medical centre in Rouen, France. Subjects and methods: 52 women (mean age: 78, range: 75 – 93) complaining of constipation, faecal incontinence or pelvic pain underwent <b>defecography.</b> <b>Defecography</b> was performed after intake of a barium meal and vaginal opacification. Radiographs were analysed accordingly with the established criteria. Results: <b>defecography</b> showed perineal descent in 27 patients, rectocele in 29, intussusception in 33 and enterocele in 14. A combination of abnormalities was found in 40 women. Only 3 studies were normal. There was no significant association between symptoms and pelvic disorders revealed by <b>defecography.</b> Conclusions: <b>defecography</b> in symptomatic women aged 75 years and over did not raise any technical difficulty.

30|$|Recently, the American College of Radiology (ACR) {{published}} the new Appropriateness Criteria for Pelvic Floor Dysfunction, stating {{that both the}} fluoroscopic cystocolpodefecography and MR <b>defecography</b> with rectal contrast opacification are appropriate and with equal rating scales for evaluation of pelvic floor disorders of the different compartments, with preference for MR <b>defecography</b> in assessing defecatory dysfunctions [21]. In anal incontinence, both endorectal ultrasound and pelvic MRI are preferred for assessing the anal sphincter, but it is indicated that MR <b>defecography</b> should be considered for evaluation of the entire pelvic floor {{in order to assess}} both the pelvic musculature and other possible associated abnormalities [21]. It is also favored, when possible, MR <b>defecography</b> in an open-magnet unit, to respect the normal physiologic position. Also recently, both the European Society of Urogenital Radiology (ESUR) and the European Society of Gastrointestinal and Abdominal Radiology (ESGAR) published a conjoined article regarding recommendations for pelvic floor dysfunction imaging, specifying the various indications where MR <b>defecography</b> is appropriate, with high levels of agreement (85 – 92 %) between the authors regarding assessment of rectal outlet obstruction, rectocele, recurrent pelvic organ prolapse, and anismus, and at least moderate agreement (54 – 77 %) in all other pelvic floor pathologies [22].|$|E
40|$|INTRODUCTION: Multiple {{sclerosis}} is {{a chronic}} demyelinating neurological disease and causing {{a variety of}} neurological symptoms, including discomfort of anorectal function. Constipation and faecal incontinence present as anorectal dysfunction in MS and anal manometry, colonic transit time, electromyography, and <b>defecography</b> {{can be used for}} assessment. PRESENTATION OF CASE: We presented a thirty-three years old woman with rare condition of anorectal dysfunction in multiple sclerosis. Anal manometry, <b>defecography</b> were done, and synchronously anal incontinence and mechanical constipation due to rectocele and anismus were detected in this patient. DISCUSSION: Although anal incontinence and constipation are seen often in patients with multiple sclerosis, in the literature, coexistence of animus, rectocele and anal incontinence are quite rare.
