40|$|Hierarchical linear growth model (HLGM), as a {{flexible}} and powerful analytic method, has played an increased {{important role in}} psychology, public health and medical sciences in recent decades. Mostly, researchers who conduct HLGM {{are interested in the}} treatment effect on individual trajectories, which can be indicated by the cross-level interaction effects. However, the statistical hypothesis test for the effect of cross-level interaction in HLGM only show us whether there is a significant group difference in the average rate of change, rate of acceleration or higher polynomial effect; it fails to convey information about the magnitude of the difference between the group trajectories at specific time point. Thus, reporting and interpreting <b>effect</b> <b>sizes</b> have been increased emphases in HLGM in recent years, due to the limitations and increased criticisms for statistical hypothesis testing. However, most researchers fail to report these model-implied <b>effect</b> <b>sizes</b> for group trajectories comparison and their corresponding confidence intervals in HLGM analysis, since lack of appropriate and standard functions to estimate <b>effect</b> <b>sizes</b> associated with the model-implied difference between grouping trajectories in HLGM, and also lack of computing packages in the popular statistical software to automatically calculate them. ^ The present project is the first to establish the appropriate computing functions to assess the standard difference between grouping trajectories in HLGM. We proposed the two functions to estimate <b>effect</b> <b>sizes</b> on model-based grouping trajectories difference at specific time, we also suggested the robust <b>effect</b> <b>sizes</b> to reduce the bias of estimated <b>effect</b> <b>sizes.</b> Then, we applied the proposed functions to estimate the population <b>effect</b> <b>sizes</b> (d) and robust <b>effect</b> <b>sizes</b> (du) on the cross-level interaction in HLGM by using the three simulated datasets, and also we compared the three methods of constructing confidence intervals around d and du recommended the best one for application. At the end, we constructed 95 % confidence intervals with the suitable method for the <b>effect</b> <b>sizes</b> what we obtained with the three simulated datasets. ^ The <b>effect</b> <b>sizes</b> between grouping trajectories for the three simulated longitudinal datasets indicated that even though the statistical hypothesis test shows no significant difference between grouping trajectories, <b>effect</b> <b>sizes</b> between these grouping trajectories can still be large at some time points. Therefore, <b>effect</b> <b>sizes</b> between grouping trajectories in HLGM analysis provide us additional and meaningful information to assess group effect on individual trajectories. In addition, we also compared the three methods to construct 95 % confident intervals around corresponding <b>effect</b> <b>sizes</b> in this project, which handled with the uncertainty of <b>effect</b> <b>sizes</b> to population parameter.

500|$|Particular {{attention}} has been paid to the function of dopamine in the mesolimbic pathway of the brain. This focus largely resulted from the accidental finding that phenothiazine drugs, which block dopamine function, could reduce psychotic symptoms. It is also supported by the fact that amphetamines, which trigger the release of dopamine, may exacerbate the psychotic symptoms in schizophrenia. The influential dopamine hypothesis of schizophrenia proposed that excessive activation of D2 receptors was the cause of (the positive symptoms of) schizophrenia. Although postulated for about 20years based on the D2 blockade effect common to all antipsychotics, it was not until the mid-1990s that PET and SPET imaging studies provided supporting evidence. While dopamine D2/D3 receptors are elevated in schizophrenia, the <b>effect</b> <b>size</b> is small, and only evident in medication naive schizophrenics. On the other hand, presynaptic dopamine metabolism and released is elevated despite no difference in dopamine transporter. The altered synthesis of dopamine in the nigrostriatal system have been confirmed in several human studies. Hypoactivity of dopamine D1 receptor activation in the prefrontal cortex has also been observed. [...] The hyperactivity of D2 receptor stimulation and relative hypoactivity of D1 receptor stimulation is thought to contribute to cognitive dysfunction by disrupting signal to noise ratio in cortical microcircuits. [...] The dopamine hypothesis is now thought to be simplistic, partly because newer antipsychotic medication (atypical antipsychotic medication) can be just as effective as older medication (typical antipsychotic medication), but also affects serotonin function and may have slightly less of a dopamine blocking effect.|$|E
