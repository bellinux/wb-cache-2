5|$|Remains {{that were}} {{recovered}} <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>Pentagon</b> were photographed, {{and turned over}} to the Armed Forces Medical Examiner office, located at Dover Air Force Base in Delaware. The medical examiner's office was able to identify remains belonging to 179 of the victims. Investigators eventually identified 184 of the 189 people who died in the attack. The remains of the five hijackers were identified through a process of elimination, and were turned over as evidence to the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI). On September 21, the ACFD relinquished control of the crime scene to the FBI. The Washington Field Office, National Capital Response Squad (NCRS), and the Joint Terrorism Task Force (JTTF) led the crime scene investigation at the Pentagon.|$|E
5|$|XX Bomber Command was {{assigned}} responsibility for Operation Matterhorn, and its ground crew began {{to leave the}} United States for India during December 1943. The Twentieth Air Force was formed in April 1944 to oversee all B-29 operations. In an unprecedented move, {{the commander of the}} USAAF, General Henry H. Arnold, took personal command of this unit and ran it <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>Pentagon</b> in Washington, D.C. The 58th Bombardment Wing was XXBomber Command's main combat unit, and its movement from Kansas to India took place between April and mid-May 1944.|$|E
50|$|Its {{name comes}} from a topological {{construction}} <b>from</b> <b>the</b> snub dodecahedron with the kis operator applied to the pentagonal faces. In this construction, all the vertices are computed to be <b>the</b> same distance <b>from</b> <b>the</b> center. The 80 of the triangles are equilateral, and 60 triangles <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>pentagons</b> are isosceles.|$|R
25|$|In October 2003, {{the role}} of the United States {{government}} in the massacre was publicized when the National Security Archive at George Washington University published a series of records <b>from</b> <b>the</b> CIA, <b>the</b> <b>Pentagon,</b> <b>the</b> State Department, the FBI and the White House which were released in response to Freedom of Information Act requests.|$|R
50|$|On June 10, 1971, the U.S. Supreme Court {{ruled that}} the Nixon Administration could not block The New York Times <b>from</b> {{publishing}} <b>the</b> <b>Pentagon</b> Papers. <b>The</b> next month, on July 12, 1971, Staggers ordered CBS News to hand over film not used in the documentary, Selling of <b>the</b> <b>Pentagon.</b>|$|R
5|$|Mulder later tells Scully that {{he wants}} to reveal the {{conspiracy}} to the public. As he is leaving, he meets with The Smoking Man who tells him that he can cure Scully's cancer by using a chip included in the vial Mulder took <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>Pentagon.</b> Meanwhile, Kritschgau goes before the FBI panel, denying any knowledge of Ostelhoff's murderer, also revealing that his son died that morning. Kritschgau claims to work for not only the Department of Defense but also a congressional lobbying firm known as Roush. Mulder sees Scully and her doctor about the chip. Scully's family is skeptical, particularly her brother Bill, who is quite upset with Mulder. Scully decides to go ahead and have the chip inserted in her neck.|$|E
5|$|In late 1943 the United States Joint Chiefs of Staff {{approved}} {{a proposal to}} begin the strategic air campaign against the Japanese home islands and East Asia by basing B-29s in India and establishing forward airfields in areas of China. This strategy, which was designated Operation Matterhorn, required the construction of large airstrips near Chengdu in inland China which would be supplied by Allied cargo aircraft and be used to refuel B-29s traveling from bases in Bengal en route to bombing targets in Japan. XX Bomber Command was assigned responsibility for this effort and its ground crew began to leave the United States for India by sea in December 1943. The Twentieth Air Force was formed in April 1944 to oversee all B-29 operations. In an unprecedented move, {{the commander of the}} USAAF, General Henry H. Arnold, took personal command of this unit and ran it <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>Pentagon.</b> The 58th Bombardment Wing was XX Bomber Command's main combat unit, and its movement from Kansas to India took place from April to mid-May. While the wing had not completed training at the time it left for India, its combat groups were more experienced than most newly deployed USAAF bomber units.|$|E
5|$|From his {{headquarters}} in Tampa, Schwarzkopf began planning the operations to defend Saudi Arabia. Lieutenant General Charles Horner, USAF, ran the headquarters in Riyadh. Schwarzkopf planned supply lines for the 50,000 troops initially sent to Saudi Arabia, tapping Major General William G. Pagonis {{as director of}} the logistical operations, with U.S. Air Force cargo aircraft landing supplies at Dhahran and U.S. Navy ships offloading troops and supplies at Dammam. By August 20, 20,000 U.S. troops were in Saudi Arabia, with another 80,000 preparing to deploy, and a further 40,000 reserves tapped to augment them. Schwarzkopf arrived at the CENTCOM command in Riyadh on August 25, and on August 29 he conducted his first front-line tour of the potential combat zone, accompanied by reporters. Over the next several weeks, Schwarzkopf spoke frequently with both reporters and troops under his command, conducting many high-profile press conferences and updates to the situation in Saudi Arabia. Schwarzkopf worked to help coordinate the contributions of the different nations contributing military forces to the effort. By mid-October, Schwarzkopf indicated he was confident the forces were of a sufficient level that they could defend Saudi Arabia if it was attacked. Through October, Schwarzkopf and his command were occupied with setting up facilities and supply lines for the troops streaming into Saudi Arabia. He also worked to minimize the culture clash among foreigners in sharia-dominated Saudi Arabia, such as the high visibility of women in military roles. Schwarzkopf remained at his command in Riyadh through December, making frequent frontline visits to the troops. On December 29, 1990, he received a warning order <b>from</b> <b>The</b> <b>Pentagon</b> to be ready to attack into Iraq and Kuwait by January 17.|$|E
50|$|He was United States Attorney for the Southern District of New York from 1970 to 1973. During {{his term}} he {{represented}} the United States Government {{in seeking to}} stop The New York Times <b>from</b> publishing <b>the</b> <b>Pentagon</b> Papers.|$|R
25|$|In May 2010, Tom Burghardt {{wrote for}} Space Daily that the X-37B {{could be used}} as a spy {{satellite}} or to deliver weapons <b>from</b> space. <b>The</b> <b>Pentagon</b> subsequently denied claims that the X-37B's test missions supported the development of space-based weapons.|$|R
5000|$|In a 6-3 decision, the Supreme Court {{ruled the}} US {{government}} {{could not stop}} <b>the</b> Times <b>from</b> publishing <b>the</b> <b>Pentagon</b> Papers, holding that prior restraints were barred by the First Amendment unless the publication “will surely result in direct, immediate, and irreparable damage to our Nation or its people.” ...|$|R

25|$|In 1991, NBC {{broke away}} from the {{telecast}} in the third period to televise a briefing <b>from</b> <b>The</b> <b>Pentagon</b> involving the Gulf War. SportsChannel America included the missing coverage in a replay of NBC's telecast (NBC owned 50% of Rainbow Enterprises, the parent of SportsChannel America).|$|E
25|$|In 1972, {{paramilitary}} police units {{launched a}} few hundred drug raids annually within the United States. In the early 1980s, SWAT drug raid numbers increased to 3,000 annually, and by 1996, 30,000 raids annually. During the 1990s, according to the Capital Times in Madison, Wisconsin, weapons donations <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>Pentagon</b> greatly bolstered the number of SWAT teams {{and the extent of}} their operations. The paper reported that the military transferred nearly 100,000 pieces of military equipment to Wisconsin police departments in the 1990s.|$|E
5000|$|In May 2015, Newsweek {{reported}} that Taliban insurgents were buying U.S.-supplied weapons <b>from</b> Afghan forces. <b>The</b> <b>Pentagon</b> [...] "lost track {{of many of}} the 465,000 light weapons the U.S. supplied to Afghan security forces." ...|$|R
50|$|Judge John M. Woolsey of the S.D.N.Y. {{rejected}} government {{efforts to}} censor on obscenity grounds {{the distribution of}} James Joyce’s Ulysses. Judge Murray Gurfein of the Court rejected government efforts to enjoin the New York Times <b>from</b> publishing <b>the</b> <b>Pentagon</b> Papers. Defamation suits were heard in the S.D.N.Y. against CBS and Time Magazine by General William Westmoreland and Israeli General Ariel Sharon.|$|R

25|$|Reactivated Camp Jackson became Fort Jackson in 1940, {{giving the}} {{military}} installation the permanence desired by city {{leaders at the}} time. The fort was annexed into {{the city in the}} fall of 1968, with approval <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>Pentagon.</b> In the early 1940s, shortly after the attacks on Pearl Harbor which began America's involvement in World War II, Lt. Colonel Jimmy Doolittle and his group of now-famous pilots began training for the Doolittle Raid over Tokyo at what is now Columbia Metropolitan Airport. They trained in B-25 Mitchell bombers, the same model as the plane that now rests at Columbia's Owens Field in the Curtiss-Wright hangar.|$|E
25|$|Robert Entman, {{professor}} of communication at the George Washington University and critic of mainstream media for decades, indicated {{it was a}} very wise tactic <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>Pentagon.</b> He mentioned there were more chances for the journalists to make favorable reports whilst in Iraq with British and American soldiers than if they had been asking questions in Washington. Entman indicated there is a natural cultural bias of American journalists in favor of military troops of their own country and that journalists do like to satisfy the government upon which they rely for information, as well as the public on whom they depend commercially. Entman also mentioned the high number of retired generals making comments on TV, pointing out these could not be considered independent experts as they were still paid by the government. He claims the British Broadcasting Corporation was much more neutral and informative on cultural and historical background than most American television reports.|$|E
500|$|On {{the side}} where the plane hit, the Pentagon is bordered by Interstate 395 and Washington Boulevard.

25|$|There {{have been}} no {{comments}} <b>from</b> either <b>the</b> <b>Pentagon</b> or US army spokespeople in Iraq on Karpinski's accusations. But, since that time, there have been revelations about the Torture Memos, including one issued by John Yoo on March 14, 2003 to the General Counsel of DOD, in which he advised that federal laws related to torture and other abuses {{did not apply to}} interrogators overseas - five days before the US invasion of Iraq.|$|R

25|$|In 1993 Idema was {{contracted}} to train police {{forces in the}} former Soviet republic of Lithuania. After his return, he contacted officials <b>from</b> both <b>the</b> <b>Pentagon</b> and <b>the</b> Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), claiming to have uncovered a conspiracy by the Russian Mafia to smuggle nuclear material out of Lithuania. According to Idema, FBI agents demanded he provide the names of his contacts. He refused, claiming that the FBI was infiltrated by KGB agents and that his sources would have been killed.|$|R
500|$|Residents of Mokhoyan, {{a village}} about 500 metres east of Camp Belamby, stated that a bomb had {{exploded}} in their vicinity on 8 March, destroying an armored vehicle and wounding several U.S. soldiers. They recounted that U.S. soldiers afterwards lined {{many of the}} male villagers against a wall, threatening to [...] "get revenge for this incident by killing at least 20 of your people," [...] and threatening that [...] "you and your children will pay for this". One Mokhoyan resident told The Associated Press [...] "It {{looked like they were}} going to shoot us, and I was very afraid." [...] U.S. officials <b>from</b> <b>The</b> <b>Pentagon</b> declared that they had [...] "no evidence" [...] that villagers had been lined up against a wall and threatened in Mokhoyan. U.S. officials refused to confirm or deny that U.S. soldiers were wounded outside the village on 8 March.|$|E
500|$|Army {{engineers}} {{determined by}} 5:30p.m. {{on the first}} day that no one remained alive in the damaged section of the building. In the days after the crash, news reports emerged that up to 800 people had died. Army soldiers from Fort Belvoir were the first teams to survey the interior of the crash site and noted the presence of human remains. Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) Urban Search and Rescue teams, including Fairfax County Urban Search and Rescue assisted the search for remains, working through the National Interagency Incident Management System (NIIMS). Kevin Rimrodt, a Navy photographer surveying the Navy Command Center after the attacks, remarked that [...] "there were so many bodies, I'd almost step on them. So I'd have to really take care to look backwards as I'm backing up in the dark, looking with a flashlight, making sure I'm not stepping on somebody". Debris <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>Pentagon</b> was taken to the Pentagon's north parking lot for more detailed search for remains and evidence.|$|E
500|$|Meanwhile, in the present, The Lone Gunmen inform Dana Scully (Gillian Anderson) {{that they}} have lost contact with Mulder, who had set out {{in search of the}} Queen Anne. Scully first turns to Walter Skinner (Mitch Pileggi), unsuccessfully, then {{attempts}} to confront Assistant Director Alvin Kersh (James Pickens, Jr.). She finally threatens Agent Jeffrey Spender (Chris Owens) before Skinner shows up and provides her with the information <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>Pentagon.</b> Scully leaves with the Gunmen to find Mulder. On the Queen Anne, a British sailor tells Mulder that the Germans are looking for what they believe is a weapon called [...] "Thor's Hammer". Mulder tells him that Thor's Hammer is not a weapon, but a scientist that will build a weapon. The sailor, however, {{turns out to be a}} German spy and locks Mulder in the engine room with the ship's crew. One of the sailors, who strongly resembles Kersh, decides to steer the boat to Jamaica, but Mulder tells them to sail back where they came from, in order to pass through the time warp and re-appear in 1998.|$|E
50|$|One way of {{constructing}} the Perles configuration {{is to start}} with a regular pentagon and its five diagonals, which form the sides of a smaller regular <b>pentagon</b> within <b>the</b> initial one. The nine points of the configuration consist of four out of the five vertices of each <b>pentagon</b> and <b>the</b> shared center of the two pentagons; <b>the</b> two missing <b>pentagon</b> vertices are chosen to be collinear with the center. The nine lines of the configuration consist of the five lines that are diagonals of <b>the</b> outer <b>pentagon</b> and sides of <b>the</b> inner <b>pentagon,</b> and <b>the</b> four lines that pass through the center and through corresponding pairs of vertices <b>from</b> <b>the</b> two <b>pentagons.</b>|$|R

500|$|On May 1 at 1:22p.m., Panetta, {{acting on}} the president's orders, {{directed}} McRaven {{to move forward with}} the operation. Shortly after 3p.m., the president joined national security officials in the Situation Room to monitor the raid. They watched night-vision images taken from a Sentinel drone while Panetta, appearing {{in a corner of the}} screen from CIA headquarters, narrated what was happening. Video links with Panetta at CIA headquarters and McRaven in Afghanistan were set up in the Situation Room. In an adjoining office was the live drone feed presented on a laptop computer operated by Brigadier General Marshall Webb, assistant commander of JSOC. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton was one of those in the Situation Room, and described it like this: [...] "Contrary to some news reports and what you see in the movies, we had no means to see what was happening inside the building itself. All we could do was wait for an update from the team on the ground. I looked at the President. He was calm. Rarely have I been prouder to serve by his side as I was that day."
