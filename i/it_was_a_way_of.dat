Not whole poetic pieces but {{a part of}} classics were quoted and recited by individuals usually followed by a chorus. Fujiwara no Kintō (966–1041) compiled Wakan rōeishū ("Sino-Japanese Anthology for Rōei", ca. 1013) from Japanese and Chinese poetry works written for roei. One or two lines were quoted in Wakan rōeishū and those quotations were grouped into themes like Spring, Travel, Celebration.|$|E
25|$|The Vickers-Wibault {{construction}} {{method was}} based on the patents of Michel Wibault, who began working with Vickers in 1922. <b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>way</b> <b>of</b> producing an all-metal aircraft with an airframe built up from simple, non-machined metal shapes, covered with very thin e.g. 0.016 in (0.4mm) corrugated light alloy sheets. Skin panels were riveted {{to each other and to}} the underlying structure; the skin on the wings was not stressed. Vickers' first experience of the method was with the licence built Wibault Scout. The first Vickers design using this construction was the Vireo and the third, the Viastra, used a blend of Wibault and Vickers construction techniques.|$|E

At the age of 14 Baird was allowed to go into Liverpool city centre by herself, where she drank cappuccino coffee in the Kardomah Coffee House, {{although}} Baird and her friends called it [...] "frothy coffee". At 16, Baird started to hitch-hike to London, although her aunt never knew, as she would never have allowed it. Baird talked about the trips to London, and how relatively safe they were: [...] "Hitching was easy then. <b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>way</b> <b>of</b> life. Everything was becoming more free. We'd start chatting to people in the Tube station and get invited to parties. People always gave us a place to stay – we were never harmed." ...|$|E

A year later the article appeared in Lobster Issue 19, and another appeared 18 months later. Although The Guardian noted that the Government was considering making the publication of such names a criminal offence, then Lobster co-editor Stephen Dorril noted that [...] "All the names and details [...]. have been compiled by research in their local libraries or have already appeared in published books.

500|$|Under the Bruces {{and their}} successors to the Scottish throne the title Earl of Carrick became a prestigious honorific title usually {{given to a}} son of the king or {{intended}} heir; at some time between 1250 and 1256 Earl Niall, anticipating that the earldom would {{be taken over by}} a man from another family, issued a charter to Lochlann (Roland) of Carrick, a son or grandson of one of Donnchadh's brothers. The charter granted Lochlann the title Cenn Cineoil, [...] "head of the kindred", a position which brought the right to lead the men of Carrick in war. The charter also conferred possession of the office of baillie of Carrick under whoever was earl. Precedent had been established here by other native families of Scotland, something similar having already taken place in Fife; <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>way</b> <b>of</b> ensuring that the kin-group retained strong locally based male leadership even when the newly imposed common law of Scotland forced the comital title to pass into the hands of another family. By 1372 the office had passed—probably by marriage—to the Kennedy family of Dunure.|$|E

In a 1971 letter, co-screenwriter Ennio Flaiano offered a fuller meaning of the word: [...] "The term vitellone was used in my day to define a young man from a modest family, perhaps a student – but one who had either already gone beyond the programmed schedule for his coursework, or one who did nothing all the time... I believe the term is a corruption of the word vudellone, the large intestine, or a person who eats a lot. <b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>way</b> <b>of</b> describing the family son who only ate but never 'produced' – like an intestine, waiting to be filled." ...|$|E

Ayer, declined to rate Nkrumah as a [...] "first-class philosopher", saying, [...] "I liked him and enjoyed talking to him but he did not seem to me to have an analytical mind. He wanted answers too quickly. I think part of the trouble may have been that he wasn't concentrating very hard on his thesis. <b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>way</b> <b>of</b> marking time until the opportunity came for him to return to Ghana."

His body was returned to Russia and he was buried with full pomp and splendour in the Peter and Paul Fortress in St. Petersburg, the first Romanov to be honoured in this way since before the revolution. The press noted that the funeral [...] "was regarded by civic and Russian authorities as an obligation to the Romanov family rather than a step toward restoration of the monarchy." [...] According to a government spokesman, <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>way</b> <b>of</b> [...] "cleansing our guilt".
