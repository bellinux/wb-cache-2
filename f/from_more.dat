5|$|Adenanthos obovatus hybridises with A.detmoldii {{to produce}} A.× pamela. Known only from road verges in the Scott River region, {{it was first}} {{discovered}} in 1979, {{and it is now}} known <b>from</b> <b>more</b> than twenty individual plants. The discovery of it in such large numbers, together with its recognised horticultural potential, prompted Nelson to formally describe and name it in 1986. Morphologically it is intermediate between its parents; that is, taller than A.obovatus, with longer leaves and light red flowers. It is fertile, raising the possibility of the establishment of a hybrid swarm.|$|E
5|$|All IQ {{tests show}} {{variation}} in scores {{even when the}} same person takes the same test over and over again. IQ scores also differ for a test-taker taking tests <b>from</b> <b>more</b> than one publisher at the same age. The various test publishers do not use uniform names or definitions for IQ score classifications. All these issues must {{be kept in mind}} when interpreting an individual's IQ scores, because they all can result in different IQ classifications for the same person at different times.|$|E
5|$|Among ectoparasites, bats carry fleas and mites, {{as well as}} {{specific}} parasites such as bat bugs and bat flies (Nycteribiidae and Streblidae). However, {{they are one of}} the few non-aquatic mammalian orders that do not host lice. This may be due to competition <b>from</b> <b>more</b> effective, specialized parasites which occupy the same niche.|$|E

5|$|As neither Lussin or {{the earlier}} Zara-class cruisers met the {{requirements}} of the Marinesektion, Vice Admiral Maximilian Daublebsky von Sterneck, who had replaced Pöck in November 1883, decided that further torpedo cruisers would be ordered <b>from</b> <b>more</b> experienced, foreign shipyards.

5|$|At {{first the}} {{sketches}} were derived almost exclusively from the books, whose multimedia approach, consisting of short anecdotes interspersed with cartoons, diaries, newspaper articles and recipes, proved easily adaptable {{to the screen}} either as raw material or creative inspiration. In later series, as usable material from the books and other obvious sources began to run out, concepts were drawn <b>from</b> <b>more</b> standard historical texts under Jenner's supervision. He and fellow researchers read through many different studies and picked out suitably quirky, intriguing snippets, which were then pitched to the writers for development.|$|E
5|$|Before these discoveries, {{a theory}} existed that a Midcontinental seaway {{separated}} {{what is now}} Texas and Oklahoma <b>from</b> <b>more</b> western lands during the Early Permian, isolating Dimetrodon to a small region of North America while a smaller sphenacodontid called Sphenacodon dominated the western area. While this seaway probably did exist, the discovery of fossils outside Texas and Oklahoma show that its extent was limited {{and that it was}} not an effective barrier to the distribution of Dimetrodon.|$|E

For example, Link and Fox have adopted designs <b>from</b> <b>more</b> recent titles, while Samus has gained {{the ability to}} change into a new form, Zero Suit Samus. Dr. Mario, Roy, Young Link, Mewtwo, and Pichu are the first characters to not return from a previous game, though they do appear as stickers or trophies.|$|E
5|$|Bruce's {{collection}} of specimens, gathered <b>from</b> <b>more</b> {{than a decade}} of Arctic and Antarctic travel, required a permanent home. Bruce himself needed a base from which the detailed scientific reports of the Scotia voyage could be prepared for publication. He obtained premises in Nicolson Street, Edinburgh, in which he established a laboratory and museum, naming it the Scottish Oceanographical Laboratory, with the ultimate ambition that it should become the Scottish National Oceanographic Institute. It was officially opened by Prince Albert of Monaco in 1906.|$|E

5|$|From {{the overall}} stock of an {{estimated}} 458 million workers, 394million (86%) operate in the unorganised sector (of which 63% are self-employed) mostly as informal workers. There is a strong relationship between the quality of employment and social and poverty characteristics. The relative growth of informal employment was more rapid within the organised rather than the unorganised sector. This informalisation is also related to the flexibilisation of employment in the organised sector that {{is suggested by the}} increasing use of contract labour by employers in order to benefit <b>from</b> <b>more</b> flexible labour practices.|$|E
