50|$|The dusky {{damselfish}} S. adustus {{spends the}} majority of its life within a territory that is only approximately 0.6 square meters in area. These territories provide them with hiding spots, dietary needs, and spawning sites. Individuals in suboptimal territories frequently attempt to relocate, and so those in optimal habitats must constantly monitor territorial occupancy. Territorial aggression is often proportional to territory quality. Movements outside of territorial borders, called forays, are common and may span distances of sixteen meters or more. Three types of forays exist. The shortest-distance ones are involved in foraging. Longer forays usually involve courtship activity and mating. Non-feeding and non-reproductive forays are associated with territorial reoccupation.The blue velvet <b>damsel</b> <b>fish</b> is very aggressive against other male blue velvet damsels.|$|E

40|$|Empirical {{studies show}} that similar {{patterns}} emerge from {{a large number of}} different biological systems. For example, the group size distributions of several fish species and house sparrows all follow power law distributions with an exponential truncation. Networks built by ant colonies, slime mold and those are designed by engineers resemble each other in terms of structure and transportation efficiency. Based on the investigation of experimental data, we propose a variety of simple stochastic models to unravel the underlying mechanisms which lead to the collective phenomena in different systems. All the mechanisms employed in these models are rooted in the concept of selective reinforcement. In some systems the reinforcement can build optimal solutions for biological problem solving. This thesis consists of five papers. In the first three papers, I collaborate with biologists to look into group formation in house sparrows and the movement decisions of <b>damsel</b> <b>fish.</b> In the last two articles, I look at how shortest paths and networks are constructed by slime molds and pheromone laying ants, as well as studying speedaccuracy tradeoffs in slime molds ' decision making. The general goal of the study is to better understand how macro level patterns and behaviors emerges from micro level interactions in both spatial and non-spatial biological systems. With the combination of mathematical modeling and experimentation, we are able to reproduce the macro level patterns in the studied biological systems and predict behaviors of the systems using minimum number of parameters...|$|E
40|$|International {{trade of}} marine {{ornamental}} fishes has been expanding rapidly in recent years, {{and the fact}} that nearly 98 % of the species traded are collected from reef habitats is of vital concern for the conservation of the fragile coral reef ecosystem. Hence, it is widely accepted that the ultimate answer to a long-term sustainable trade of marine ornamental fishes is only through the development of hatchery production technologies. The techniques for broodstock development, breeding and seed production of three species of <b>damsel</b> <b>fishes</b> viz. the three spot damsel, Dascyllus trimaculatus, the humbug damsel, Dascyllus aruanus and the blue damsel, Pomacentrus caeruleus, were developed and standardised, which can be scaled up for commercial level production. Broodstock development was done in one-tonne Fiber Reinforced Plastic (FRP) tanks with biological filter and by feeding with natural feeds. The size range of broodstock fish of D. trimaculatus, D. aruanus and P. caeruleus were 9 - 10, 7 - 8 and 7 - 9 cm, respectively. The number of eggs per spawning ranged from 5000 to 15000. The interval between two successive spawnings ranged from 3 to 14 days. The eggs were attached either {{on the sides of the}} broodstock tank or on the substratum provided in the broodstock tank.

40|$|It is well {{established}} that small-sized live feed with sufficient DHA, EPA and ARA as starter feed is the key factor for the success in larviculture of marine fishes with altricial larvae having limited yolk, which are in an undeveloped state at hatching. Copepods form {{a major component of}} the natural diet of many fish larvae and the wide range of body sizes of copepods both within and between species is extremely useful for employing the early stage nauplii and copepodites as starter feed for very small larvae with small mouth opening. Improved survival, growth and normal pigmentation have been documented in the larviculture of several marine finfishes reared with the early stage nauplii and copepodites. This is generally attributed to the levels of DHA, EPA and or arachidomic acid (ARA) in the diet and particularly to the DHA: EPA ratio in the diet. Two species of copepods viz. Euterpina acutifrons, a harpacticoid copepod and Pseudodiaptomus serricaudatus, a calanoid copepod were selected and cultured. They were employed as starter feed for the larviculture of three species of <b>damsel</b> <b>fishes</b> viz. the three spot damselfish, Dascyllus trimaculatus, the humbug damselfish, Dascyllus aruanus and the blue damselfish, Pomacentrus caeruleus.

40|$|It {{is widely}} {{accepted}} that if well managed, the marine aquarium trade could provide socio-economic stability to local communities while incentivising {{the maintenance of}} coral reefs. However, the trade has also been implicated as having potentially widespread environmental impacts that has in part driven developments in aquaculture to relieve wild collection pressures. This study investigates the biodiversity in hobbyist aquaria (using an online survey) and those species currently available from an aquaculture source (commercial data and hobbyist initiatives) {{in the context of}} a traffic light system to highlight gaps in aquaculture effort and identify groups that require fisheries assessments. Two hundred and sixty nine species including clown <b>fish,</b> <b>damsels,</b> dotty backs, angelfish, gobies, sea horses and blennies, have reported breeding successes by hobbyists, a pattern mirrored by the European and US commercial organisations. However, there is a mismatch (high demand and low/non-existent aquaculture) for a number of groups including tangs, starfish, anemones and hermit crabs, which we recommend are priority candidates for local stock assessments. Hobbyist perception towards the concept of a sustainable aquarium trade is also explored with results demonstrating that only 40 % of respondents were in agreement with industry and scientists who believe the trade could be an exemplar of a sustainable use of coral reefs. We believe that a more transparent evidence base, including the publication of the species collected and cultured, will go some way to align the concept of a sustainable trade across industry stakeholders and better inform the hobbyist whe...|$|R
40|$|Abstract OnlyThe {{significant}} revenue {{involved in}} marine aquarium trade notwithstanding, {{in developing countries}} generates gainful employment and alternate livelihood in rural sector to fishers. Despite rich biodiversity of marine ornamental fishes and ideal milieu for expansion of trade the sector remains at infancy. However, absence of primary database on marketing is a major handicap in expansion and regulation of this sector. This study focused on status of demand, supply and potentials of marine aquarium fish trade. The study covered demand and supply entities including suppliers, hobbyists and aquarium keepers. The results documents prominence of aquarium industry and portray the challenges in expanding domestic trade in Kerala. The preferred candidates in trade in Kerala include <b>damsel</b> <b>fish,</b> wrasse, butterfly fish, trigger fish and cardinal fishes. Hobbyist‚ awareness, interests and willingness to keep marine fishes was high despite negligible trade. The demand and purchasing power of hobbyists is undoubtedly {{the single most important}} force in determining potential and profitability of marine aquarium industry in Kerala. Maintenance and upkeep snags, technological lag, institutional support and high mortality were the major problems in the sector. The resources are currently being unexploited or discarded. The sector could provide alternative avocation for fishermen if state of art technologies for collection, handling and transport are developed integrating with conservation and sustainable development objectives. The marine aquarium trade of Kerala needs to capitalize on key strength of unexploited resources by alleviating major weaknesses of technological lag and harnessing the opportunities of tapping the huge demand for improving trade...|$|E
40|$|Caribbean {{coral reefs}} {{have had an}} 80 % {{decrease}} in live coral cover {{over the last several}} decades and the effect of white-band disease on Acropora species was a major contributor. The loss of Acropora resulted in a decrease of reef rugosity and habitats for fish and reef invertebrates. This paper examines the record of stressors today and in pre-human staghorn communities to examine possible changes. Acropora cervicornis fragments, estimated to be 250 - 750 years old, were collected from recently exposed earthquake scarps on patch reefs in the South Water Caye Marine Reserve, Central Belize. Skeletal records of stressors included <b>damsel</b> <b>fish</b> chimneys, clubbed and eroded tips representing fireworm predation, and resheeting over dead tissue presumably killed by snail predation or disease. These results were compared to similar data from live A. cervicornis colonies on 18 nearby patch reefs. A. cervicornis comprised most of the subfossil assemblage, but makes up only 1 % of the live coral cover today. It is replaced on patch reefs today by branching corals with much less topographic relief such as Agaricia tenuifolia (21 %), Porites porites (16 %) and Millipora complinata (fire coral, 15 %). Damselfish impacts did not change from the pre-human baseline, but the incidence of fireworm predation and disease had both more than doubled. Increased biological stressors on A. cervicornis may result from a loss of fireworm and snail predators such as large fish and lobsters. An increase in fishing regulations in South Water Cay Marine Reserve may be necessary for the reestablishment of thriving staghorn coral communities...|$|E
40|$|Cobia (Rachycentron canadum) {{has been}} {{considered}} as a potential species for aquaculture because of its fast growth and commercial value. As a consequence of successful spawning and seed production, {{there has been a}} significant demand for cage farming of cobia in India (Philipose et al. 2013). Not many reports are available on diseases of cage-farmed cobia. Globally, mortality due to pasteurellosis in cage-cultured cobia caused by Photobacterium damselae subsp. piscicida has been reported (Liu, Lin & Lee 2003). Vibriosis caused by Vibrio alginolyticus, V. harveyi, V. parahemolyticus and V. vulnificus has also been responsible for mortalities in cage-cultured cobia (Rajan et al. 2001; Liu et al. 2004). Photobacterium damselae subsp. damselae was originally isolated from the skin lesions of <b>damsel</b> <b>fish,</b> Chromis punctipinnis (Love et al. 1981). Subsequently, diseases caused by this pathogen have been reported in several cultivable fish species like seabream (Vera, Navas & Fouz 1991), eel (Ketterer & Eaves 1992), turbot (Fouz et al. 1992), ovate pompano (Zhao et al. 2009) and Asian seabass (Kanchanopas-Barnette et al. 2009). Infection caused by P. damselae subsp. damselae has also been recorded in marine mammals like dolphins (Fujioka et al. 1988) and several wild fish species (Han et al. 2009). Pathogenicity of this bacterium in several marine fish species and humans has been reviewed (Rivas, Lemos & Osorio 2013 a). There have been no reports on mortality caused by this pathogen in cobia. This study was envisaged with the objectives to describe the disease epizootic caused by P. damselae subsp. damselae in cage-farmed cobia and characterize the pathogen...|$|E
40|$|Habitat {{specificity}} plays {{a pivotal}} role in forming community patterns in coral reef fishes, yet considerable uncertainty remains as to the extent of this selectivity, particularly among newly settled recruits. Here we quantified habitat specificity of juvenile coral reef fish at three ecological levels; algal meadows vs. coral reefs, live vs. dead coral and among different coral morphologies. In total, 6979 individuals from 11 families and 56 species were censused along Ningaloo Reef, Western Australia. Juvenile fishes exhibited divergence in habitat use and specialization among species and at all study scales. Despite the close proximity of coral reef and algal meadows (10 ’s of metres) 25 species were unique to coral reef habitats, and seven to algal meadows. Of the seven unique to algal meadows, several species are known to occupy coral reef habitat as adults, suggesting possible ontogenetic shifts in habitat use. Selectivity between live and dead coral was found to be species-specific. In particular, juvenile scarids were found predominantly on the skeletons of dead coral whereas many <b>damsel</b> and butterfly <b>fishes</b> were closely associated with live coral habitat. Among the coral dependent species, coral morphology {{played a key role in}} juvenile distribution. Corymbose corals supported a disproportionate number of coral species and individuals relative to their availability, whereas less complex shapes (i. e. massive & encrusting) were rarely used by juvenile fish. Habitat specialisation by juvenile species of ecological and fisheries importance, for a variety of habitat types, argues strongly for the careful conservation and management of multiple habitat types within marine parks, an...|$|R
40|$|Reports were scanned {{in black}} and white at a {{resolution}} of 600 dots per inch and were converted to text using Adobe Paper Capture Plug-in. Fish censuses were made in three habitat types in Honaunau Bay and adjoining Alahaka Bay, Hawai'i, during the summers of 1974 to 1978. The habitats were an inshore Boulder Zone, a current-swept Drop-off Zone, and a luxuriant Coral-rich Zone. SCUBA-assisted observations and a standardized transecting method with 50 -m segmented lines were employed. The number of individuals of each species observed was recorded during a minimum of three transects per site per year. Reconnaissance dives were also conducted to further qualitatively assess the fish population in Honaunau Bay. A total of 126 species was observed along the transects and 37 additional species were seen on reconnaissance dives. The average number of species distributed along transects were 54 for the Boulder Zone, 60 for the Coral-rich Zone, and 60 for the Drop-off Zone. The Shannon-Weiner diversity index and the number of species observed each year remained fairly constant for each transect. The species make-up was qua 1 itatively similar for all transects but quantitative differences were evident. The Drop-off Zone was characterized by plankton pickers and wandering predators, the Boulder Zone by an increased number of herbivores while the Coral-rich Zone appeared intermediate.
