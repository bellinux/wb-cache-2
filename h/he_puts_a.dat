He is now leading the Victorian Bushrangers and the Melbourne Renegades in the Big Bash. Andrew has led the Victorian to a successful Sheffield shield campaign {{in his first year}} as senior coach.|$|E
25|$|Harold (Patrick McKenna) is Red's nephew and {{the fictional}} {{producer}} {{and director of}} The Red Green Show. He is a nerdâ€”he has a significant overbite, wears thick glasses, is very eager and sensitive. He is often appalled by the behaviour of the other lodge members (and even Red himself), and <b>he</b> <b>puts</b> <b>a</b> lot of effort into trying to change everyone's behaviour, usually {{with little or no}} success.|$|E
25|$|Tobey {{knows that}} McAuley {{wants to kill}} him, but a plan is set up with Owen Dowd, Rebecca's brother. <b>He</b> <b>puts</b> <b>a</b> {{great deal of money}} in Byron Sweet, one of McAuley's minions, to frame him as a traitor.

500|$|Revolution Software's {{point and}} click {{adventure}} game [...] was first released in 1996. While investigating a murder, protagonist and player character George Stobbart finds himself uncovering a dark mystery regarding the Knights Templar. A medieval manuscript which he obtained {{during the investigation}} leads him to a castle located in Lochmarne, Ireland. As he cannot enter the castle through the main entrance door, he climbs a haystack, which stops short {{of the top of}} the wall. <b>He</b> <b>puts</b> <b>a</b> sewer key which he obtained {{at the beginning of the}} game in a crack in the wall, which forms a step, allowing him to climb over the wall. Inside the castle, an entrance to an underground dig is located. A tied-up goat is sitting near the entrance; however, the rope to which it is tied is long enough to allow it to prevent George from reaching the entrance by butting him. An old piece of farming machinery is located at the left side of the screen, but George is unable to interact with it, as the goat continues to butt him. George must allow the goat to butt him when trying to reach the entrance, but while the goat is returning to its original position, the player must click on the farming machinery, which causes George to quickly jump up and run to the machinery and slightly reposition it. When returned to its original position, the goat again charges and butts George, but while doing so, gets its rope entangled with the machinery, due to its repositioning. This allows George to move freely and enter the dig.|$|E
2500|$|He is {{the assassin}} sent to kill Ah-Rin in Mo-Yong house. But he is killed by Ja Hye and Mo-Yong Bi. In the end, <b>he</b> <b>puts</b> <b>a</b> joke: [...] "I'm killed {{so fast that}} I can't present my name!".|$|E
2500|$|... "Language" [...] is {{the story}} of Army Cook Sanford Carter and his time in Japan. Carter has held many {{positions}} within the Army up until the time he becomes a cook. As a mess sergeant, <b>he</b> <b>puts</b> <b>a</b> lot of effort into providing quality food for the men, but doesn't feel appreciated. The men accuse him of stealing food and he decides not to provide them with quality food. The men begin to appreciate him; however, Carter finds out that their mistrust in him remains.|$|E
50|$|Before {{his major}} {{victory against the}} Saffarids, he had made various expeditions in Transoxiana; in 892, <b>he</b> <b>put</b> <b>an</b> end to the Principality of Ushrusana by seizing of all of its lands. During the same period, <b>he</b> <b>put</b> <b>an</b> end to the Bukhar Khudas in Bukhara.

2500|$|The {{isolation}} and boredom of Casanova's last years {{enabled him to}} focus without distractions on his Histoire de ma vie, without which his fame would have been considerably diminished, if not blotted out entirely. He {{began to think about}} writing his memoirs around 1780 and began in earnest by 1789, as [...] "the only remedy to keep from going mad or dying of grief". The first draft was completed by July 1792, and he spent the next six years revising it. <b>He</b> <b>puts</b> <b>a</b> happy face on his days of loneliness, writing in his work, [...] "I can find no pleasanter pastime than to converse with myself about my own affairs and to provide a most worthy subject for laughter to my well-bred audience." [...] His memoirs were still being compiled {{at the time of his}} death, his account having reached only the summer of 1774. A letter by him in 1792 states that he was reconsidering his decision to publish them, believing that his story was despicable and he would make enemies by writing the truth about his affairs. But he decided to proceed, using initials instead of actual names and toning down the strongest passages. He wrote in French instead of Italian because [...] "the French language is more widely known than mine".|$|E
6000|$|<b>He</b> <b>puts</b> <b>a</b> {{sheet of}} {{notepaper}} before his father, who takes it and [...] begins to con over the verses thereon, while JOHNNY looks carefully [...] at his nails.|$|E

60|$|Then <b>he</b> <b>put</b> <b>a</b> {{number of}} questions, {{to make sure}} that nothing had been left out or covered up.|$|R

6000|$|... "Then," [...] he continued--"then you'll up, and you'll say this:--Gunn is a {{good man}} (you'll say), and <b>he</b> <b>puts</b> <b>a</b> {{precious}} sight more confidence--a precious sight, mind that--in a gen'leman born than in these gen'lemen of fortune, having been one hisself." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I didn't say nothing, sir, for I {{could make}} neither head nor tail {{of what he}} was saying, and, I dessay, looked as {{surprised}} as might be. Then he takes a step forward, and <b>he</b> <b>puts</b> <b>a</b> hand on my shoulder, and says he: ...|$|E

6000|$|... "What do I know? Why not? To gain a day perhaps. It {{would take}} Sotillo {{a day to}} give me the estrapade, and try some other things perhaps, before <b>he</b> <b>puts</b> <b>a</b> bullet through my heart--as he did to that poor wretch here. Why not?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Don't grow impatient, Walter," [...] said Caleb. [...] "We'll run {{up against}} {{something}} soon--perhaps {{more than you}} care for. It's easy enough to think of sinking an enemy's ship. Supposing <b>he</b> <b>puts</b> <b>a</b> few thirteen-inch shells through your craft, {{and you begin to}} go down--what then?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Oh, John's {{heart is}} all light enough!" [...] said Miss Grace; [...] "and I don't doubt his love. He's the best, noblest, most affectionate {{fellow in the}} world.

60|$|And <b>he</b> <b>put</b> <b>a</b> twenty-dollar gold {{piece in}} the driver's hand. After a moment the driver {{said he could not}} make change.|$|R

60|$|Mr. Carvel winced. <b>He</b> <b>put</b> <b>an</b> {{arm around}} her. He, {{thought of his}} lonely widowerhood, of her whose place Virginia had taken.|$|R
6000|$|Says Turpin, 'You shall {{eat your}} words, [...] With a sarse of leaden bul-let;' [...] So <b>he</b> <b>puts</b> <b>a</b> pistol to his mouth, [...] And he fires it down his gul-let.

60|$|First, {{by doing}} thus, <b>he</b> <b>puts</b> <b>a</b> stop to the fraud--that piece {{of money is}} no more made the {{instrument}} to deceive others, which otherwise it might do; and though {{it is true that}} the loss is only to the last man, that is to say, in the ordinary currency of the money, yet the breach upon conscience and principle is to every owner through whose hands that piece of money has fraudulently passed, that is to say, who have passed it away for good, knowing it to be counterfeit; so that it is a piece of good service to the public to take away the occasion and instrument of so much knavery and deceit.|$|E
6000|$|One raw April morning, as Corydon goes to pay {{his usual}} duty to Phillis, he finds, not his charmer with her dear smile as usual ready to welcome him, but Mrs. Lambert, with very red eyes, and the General as pale as death.

I can hear now the sobs of the good Aunt Lambert, {{and to this day}} the noise of fire-irons stirring a fire in a room overhead gives me a tremor. I heard such a noise that day in the girls' room where the sisters were together. Poor, gentle child! Poor Theo! ...|$|E
60|$|<b>He</b> <b>put</b> <b>an</b> affectionate {{gentleness}} {{into the}} last two words. The real intimacy of their intercourse {{had never been so}} vividly expressed before.|$|R
