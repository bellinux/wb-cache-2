We call an Euclidean instanton {{is to be}} an oscillating instanton, if there exists a point where the derivative of the scale factor and the scalar field vanish at the same time. Then we can prove that the oscillating instanton can be analytically continued, both as inhomogeneous and homogeneous tunneling channels. Here, we especially focus on the possibility of a homogeneous tunneling channel. For the existence of such an instanton, we have to assume three things: (1) there should be a local maximum and the curvature of the maximum should be sufficiently large, (2) there should be a local minimum and (3) {{the other side of the}} potential should have a sufficiently <b>deeper</b> <b>vacuum.</b> Then, we can show that there exists a number of oscillating instanton solutions and their probabilities are higher compared to the Hawking-Moss instantons. We also check the possibility when the oscillating instantons are comparable with the Coleman-DeLuccia channels.

By KA 2, the fundamental role of gravity in {{the dynamics of}} vacuum geometry is being conceded to the remaining fundamental interactions. The ground state in KA 2 is of the form M̅^n+ 4 =C̅^n+ 1 ×^ 3, where the static (averaged-out over scales L>> L_o) C̅^n+ 1 carries effective torsion as relic of the <b>deeper</b> <b>vacuum</b> dynamics at Planck scale. For the simplest non-trivial implementation of KA 2, the Bianchi IX subclass of SU(2) -invariant B^ 4 _ IX provides the C̅^ 5 =B̅^ 4 _ M× S^ 1, with the S^ 1 coming from 'augmentability', a complement to compactification. The classical action involves (i) the gravitational and EW sectors in elegant hierarchy, (ii) the higgsless emergence and full calculability of the EW gauge bosons masses and (iii) gravity as a necessarily effective field, hence non-quantizable. A conjectured C^n+ 1 with n≤ 7 (to adjoin the strong interaction) toward a standard model 2, might also offer novel perspectives for supergravity. Comment: 8 page...|$|R
40|$|In this paper, {{we provide}} a {{counter-example}} to the ER=EPR conjecture. In an anti-de Sitter space, we construct {{a pair of}} maximally entangled but separated black holes. Due to the vacuum decay of the anti-de Sitter background toward a <b>deeper</b> <b>vacuum,</b> these two parts can be trapped by bubbles. If these bubbles are reasonably large, then within the scrambling time, there should appear an Einstein-Rosen bridge between the two black holes. Now by tracing more details on the bubble dynamics, one can identify parameters such {{that one of the}} two bubbles either monotonically shrinks or expands. Because of the change of vacuum energy, one side of the black hole would evaporate completely. Due to the shrinking of the apparent horizon, a signal of one side of the Einstein-Rosen bridge can be viewed from the opposite side. We analytically and numerically demonstrate that within a reasonable semi-classical parameter regime, such process can happen. Bubbles are a non-perturbative effect, which is the crucial reason that allows the transmission of information between the two black holes through the Einstein-Rosen bridge, even though the probability is highly suppressed. Therefore, the ER=EPR conjecture cannot be generic in its present form and its validity maybe restricted. Comment: 20 pages, 9 figure...|$|R

5000|$|In metallurgy, {{alpha case}} is the oxygen-enriched surface phase that occurs when {{titanium}} and its alloys are exposed to heated air or oxygen. Alpha case is hard and brittle, and tends to create a series of microcracks which will reduce the metal's performance and its fatigue properties. Alpha case can be minimized or avoided by processing titanium at very <b>deep</b> <b>vacuum</b> levels. However once present on the surface, the currently applied method to remove the Alpha case is by the subtractive methods of machining and /or chem milling. An emerging technique is to subject the metal to an electrochemical treatment in molten salts, such as calcium chloride or lithium chloride at elevated temperatures. This method, as proven in laboratory, is effective in removal of the dissolved oxygen from the alpha case, and hence recovery of the metal. However, the unwanted consequence of the high temperature treatment is {{the growth of the}} grains in the metal. Grain growth may be limited by lowering the molten salt temperature.

50|$|The heat {{transfer}} coefficient on the evaporating side of the tube is mostly determined by the hydrodynamic flow conditions of the film. For low mass flows or high viscosities the film flow can be laminar, in which case {{heat transfer}} is controlled purely by conduction through the film. Therefore in this condition the {{heat transfer coefficient}} decreases with increased mass flow. With increased mass flow the film becomes wavy laminar and then turbulent. Under turbulent conditions the heat transfer coefficient increases with increased flow.Evaporation takes place at very low mean temperature differences between heating medium and process stream, typically between 3 - 6K, therefore these devices are ideal for heat recovery in multi stage processes.A further advantage of the falling film evaporator is the very short residence time of the liquid {{and the absence of}} superheating of the same. Not considering the vapour separator, the residence time inside the tubes is measured in seconds, making it ideal for heat-sensitive products such as milk, fruit juice, pharmaceuticals, and many others.Falling film evaporators are also characterised by very low pressure drops; therefore, they are often used in <b>deep</b> <b>vacuum</b> applications.|$|E

50|$|Vacuum {{is useful}} {{in a variety of}} {{processes}} and devices. Its first widespread use was in the incandescent light bulb to protect the filament from chemical degradation. The chemical inertness produced by a vacuum is also useful for electron beam welding, cold welding, vacuum packing and vacuum frying. Ultra-high vacuum is used in the study of atomically clean substrates, as only a very good vacuum preserves atomic-scale clean surfaces for a reasonably long time (on the order of minutes to days). High to ultra-high vacuum removes the obstruction of air, allowing particle beams to deposit or remove materials without contamination. This is the principle behind chemical vapor deposition, physical vapor deposition, and dry etching which are essential to the fabrication of semiconductors and optical coatings, and to surface science. The reduction of convection provides the thermal insulation of thermos bottles. <b>Deep</b> <b>vacuum</b> lowers the boiling point of liquids and promotes low temperature outgassing which is used in freeze drying, adhesive preparation, distillation, metallurgy, and process purging. The electrical properties of vacuum make electron microscopes and vacuum tubes possible, including cathode ray tubes. Vacuum interrupters are used in electrical switchgear. Vacuum arc processes are industrially important for production of certain grades of steel or high purity materials. The elimination of air friction is useful for flywheel energy storage and ultracentrifuges.|$|E
5000|$|Dust from lunar {{soil that}} was carried into {{spacecraft}} during the Apollo missions {{proved to be}} a nuisance. The lack of gravity, or the existence of gravity at {{a small fraction of the}} gravitational force of the Earth, increases the time during which dust remains airborne, thereby increasing the probability that these dust particles will be inhaled. Lunar dust particles that are generated by impaction in a <b>deep</b> <b>vacuum</b> have complex shapes and highly reactive surfaces that are coated with a thin layer of vapor-deposited mineral phase. Airborne mineral dust in a variety of forms has been shown to present a serious health hazard to ground-based workers. The health hazards that are associated with volcanic ash, which is a commonly used analog of lunar dust, have not been reported to be especially serious; however, this type of ash quickly loses its reactive surfaces and is often aggregated into particles that are not readily respirable into the deep lung. Crew members who will be at a lunar outpost can be directly exposed to lunar dust in several ways. After crew members perform spacewalks or EVAs, they will introduce into the habitat a large quantity of dust that will have collected on spacesuits and boots. Cleaning of the suits between EVAs and changing of the Environmental Control Life Support System (ECLSS) filters are other operations that could result in direct exposure to lunar dusts. In addition, if the final spacesuit design is based on the current spacesuit design, EVAs may cause dermal injuries, and the introduction of lunar dusts into the suits' interior, which may enhance skin abrasions. When the crew leaves the lunar surface and returns to microgravity, the dust that is introduced into the crew return vehicle will [...] "float," [...] thus increasing the opportunity for ocular and respiratory injury.|$|E
5000|$|Pressure is a {{force that}} can be {{measured}} absolutely, because the natural minimum of pressure is total vacuum. Pressure is frequently measured with reference to atmospheric pressure rather than on any absolute scale, relative to complete and perfect vacuum; it is technologically simpler and cheaper. It may also be more convenient to use relative scales, because, with things like pneumatics and hydraulics, {{the amount of energy}} transferred is reduced by the relative [...] "backpressure" [...] of the atmosphere. (e.g.: 15 psi of air in a tank at sea level will become 30 psi in the vacuum of space.) Therefore, with measurements of things like blood pressure or tire pressure, a measurement relative to air pressure is a better indication of [...] "burst pressure" [...] (damage threshold) than an absolute scale. Absolute scales are typically used in science, <b>deep</b> <b>vacuum</b> measurements (where the fluctuating pressure of the atmosphere becomes a nuisance), aeronautics (where precise measurements of the atmosphere are needed to determine altitude), or lighting construction (where the relative pressure of the atmosphere is inconsequential), and are measured in units of [...] "atmospheres" [...] or torr. Barometers do measure absolute pressure by holding a vacuum {{at the top of the}} mercury column or one side of a diaphragm, but that vacuum is awkward to achieve and maintain. Thus, while the general public may be familiar with measurements of absolute pressure from weather forecasts, most pressures such as tire pressures and water pressures are measured relative to atmospheric pressure using cheaper and simpler pressure gauges. For this reason, the pressure relative to atmospheric pressure is called gauge pressure and measurements given in units like pounds per square inch (abbreviated lbf/in2 or psi) are often shown as psig (the [...] "g" [...] standing for gauge) or psia ("a" [...] for absolute).|$|E

Pseudomonas putida was used as a model organism and stored for shorter (2 d) and longer periods (28 d). The impact of the treatments (preservation method, duration) was evaluated on the level of single cells using flow cytometry and on the population level using protein mass spectrometry. On the single cell level, the effect of sodium azide fixation was found to be small (1. 01 ≤ sd ≤ 1. 76) for short term and larger for long term storage (1. 59 ≤ sd ≤ 2. 33), as determined by FlowFP fingerprinting. In contrast, <b>deep</b> frozen and <b>vacuum</b> dried cells showed properties highly similar to fresh reference cells, even after extended storage (0. 5 ≤ sd ≤ 1. 2).

Here, we extend $q$-theory by introducing dissipation from irreversible processes. Neglecting the possible instability of a de-Sitter vacuum, we obtain different scenarios with either a de-Sitter asymptote or collapse to a final singularity. The Minkowski asymptote still requires fine-tuning of the initial conditions.

40|$|A {{scheme is}} {{analyzed}} for effcient generation of vacuum ultraviolet radiation through four-wave mixing processes assisted by {{the technique of}} Stark-chirped rapid adiabatic passage. These opportunities are associated with pulse excitation of laddertype short-wavelength two-photon atomic or molecular transitions so that relaxation processes can be neglected. In this three-laser technique, a delayed-pulse of strong oR-resonant infrared radiation sweeps the laser-induced Stark-shift of a two-photon transition in a such way that facilitates robust maximum two-photon coherence induced by the first ultraviolet laser. A judiciously delayed third pulse scatters at this coherence and generates short-wavelength radiation. A theoretical analysis of these problems based on the density matrix is performed. A numerical model is developed to carry out simulations of a typical experiment.

40|$|In {{the theory}} of the chiral anomaly in {{relativistic}} quantum field theories (RQFT) some results depend on regularization scheme at ultraviolet. In the chiral superfluid 3 He-A, which contains two Weyl points and also experiences the effects of chiral anomaly, the "trans-Planckian" physics is known and the results can be obtained without regularization. We discuss this on example of the chiral magnetic effect (CME), which has been observed in 3 He-A in 90 's. There are two forms of the contribution of the CME to the Chern-Simons term in free energy, perturbative and non-perturbative. The perturbative term comes from the fermions living {{in the vicinity of the}} Weyl point, where the fermions are "relativistic" and obey the Weyl equation. The non-perturbative term originates from the <b>deep</b> <b>vacuum,</b> being determined by the separation of the two Weyl points. Both terms are obtained using the Adler-Bell-Jackiw equation for chiral anomaly, and both agree with the results of the microscopic calculations in the "trans-Planckian" region.

Varying the arrival time of a second probe pulse allows high degree of control over its evolution as it propagates along the fiber, in particular soliton self-compression and dispersive wave (DW) emission. In the experiments reported, a DW is emitted at 300 nm, with a central frequency that oscillates with the pump-probe delay.

This paper describe the challenges of developing, integrating and modifying new payload rails capable of transporting payloads within the thermal vacuum chamber up to 65, 000 pounds. Ambient and Cryogenic Operations required to configure for testing will be explained. Lastly review historical payload configurations stretching from the Apollo program era to current James Webb Space Telescope testing...|$|R
40|$|We {{examine the}} {{possible}} {{extension of the}} parameter space of the minimal supersymmetric extension of the Standard Model (MSSM), as expressed via the renormalization-group equations in terms of universal soft supersymmetry-breaking terms at the unification scale, to include tachyonic input scalar masses. Many models with negative masses-squared for scalars at the unification scale may be viable because the small sizes of the masses-squared allow them to change signs during the renormalization-group evolution to the electroweak scale. However, in many cases, there is, {{in addition to the}} electroweak <b>vacuum,</b> a much <b>deeper</b> high-scale <b>vacuum</b> located along some F- and D-flat direction in the effective potential for the MSSM. We perform a numerical search for such vacua in both the CMSSM and the NUHM. We discuss the circumstances under which the existence of such a deep charge- and color-breaking vacuum is consistent with standard cosmology. A crucial role is played by the inflation [...] induced scalar masses, whereas thermal effects are often irrelevant. Comment: 24 pages, 4 figure...|$|R
40|$|The Pacific Highway {{is being}} {{upgraded}} {{to support the}} transportation demand between Sydney and Brisbane, Australia. To avoid the town of Ballina, the bypass route has to traverse on a floodplain consisting of very soft, highly compressible, saturated marine clays up to 40 m <b>deep.</b> A <b>vacuum</b> assisted surcharge load scheme in conjunction with prefabricated vertical drains was selected to reduce the required time and consolidate the deeper subsoil layers. The design of the combined vacuum and surcharge fill system {{and the construction of}} the embankment is described. A comparison of the performance of the vacuum combined surcharge loading system with a standard surcharge fill highlights the benefits of vacuum consolidation. Field monitoring data is presented to demonstrate how the embankment performed during construction. Suitable design charts for vertical drains were developed considering both vertical and horizontal drainage. As a result, the conventional and often cumbersome trial and error methods to estimate the appropriate parameters could be avoided...|$|R
