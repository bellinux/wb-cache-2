40|$|Purpose: The {{building}} {{sector accounts}} for 40 % {{of the total}} energy consumption in Sweden today, and the largest proportion is consumed during the operating phase. From the year 2020 and onwards, all new buildings should be erected as zero-emissionbuildings. The building’s design can reduce energy demands, but the current legal requirements do not favour energy-efficient designs. This study focuses on the design’s importance for the energy efficiency of buildings, i. e., energy-saving design. The impact of specific measures is difficult to calculate due {{to the complexity of}} reality. This study aims to highlight the measures that could reduce energy consumption in commercial buildings. Method: In order to provide answers to the issues stated in the report and to achieve the objective of the study, case studies are being conducted investigating three commercial buildings where deliberate decisions were made to use <b>energy-reducing</b> measures. Results and conclusions are based on qualitative interviews and literature studies. Findings: The <b>energy-reducing</b> design measures found to be of most importance used in the studied buildings are the form factor, the window portion and the thermal storage capacity. Moreover, significant savings are possible by carefully consider how solar energy can be limited or used in the building. Generally, buildings tends to become more technical, therefore technical knowledge early in the process is important to reach a good result. Economic incentives and clear objectives with right focus are also important for optimizing a building’s energy performance. The wording and the requirement levels in the Swedish building regulations highly controls the construction of energy efficient buildings. Implications: This study shows how energy efficient design is made today and provides an indication of what can be done and what should be prioritized. By imposing requirements on consumed energy instead of bought, energy efficient design could be favoured. Furthermore, this study suggests that a balance between windows, façade and solar shading are important <b>energy-reducing</b> measures. Regardless of selected energyreducing measures, a good performance is essential. Finally, this study shows that a methodical use of existing knowledge and technology makes a difference. Limitations: A lifecycle approach provides an overall picture of a building’s energy consumption. However, this study is based on the energy consumption during the operating phase. The result of this study does not take economic or aesthetic factors into account. This study is a comparative case study and is based on few but carefully matched cases.

40|$|From the {{perspective}} of surface bonding, {{the origin of the}} O-reduced inner potential and work function in very LEED (VLEED - very low energy electron diffraction) is analysed. It is recognised that, for the O-Cu(001) sample, such a reduction originates from the O-metal bonding, namely, variations of atomic states. The inner potential relates to the charge quantity and the work function depends on the density-of-state of the surface. With expansion in size and elevation in energy-state, the metal dipoles induced by the hybridised-O- 2 are responsible for the reduction in the local work function. Therefore, the inner potential and the work function act as important identities for the surface electrons. It is suggested that, at very low energies, the exchange-interaction between the energetic incident beams and the surface is insignificant, and hence the <b>energy-reduced</b> inner potential is weak enough to be neglected. The VLEED is therefore an ideal tool for nondestructive information about the behaviour of surface electrons...|$|E

40|$|AbstractObjectiveObesity is {{characterized}} by chronic subclinical inflammation, which is critical to endothelial dysfunction. Weight loss, induced by lifestyle interventions, {{is associated with a}} decline in biomarkers of inflammation and endothelial dysfunction. There is little evidence that high dietary calcium intake may reduce inflammation and improve endothelial function. The {{purpose of this study was}} to evaluate the effects of weight loss from a high-calcium <b>energy-reduced</b> diet on biomarkers of inflammation, fibrinolysis, and endothelial function in obese individuals. MethodsIn this randomized clinical trial, we analyzed the data from 35 obese adults who lost at least 3 % of initial body weight, during a period of 16 wk of energy restriction (− 800 Kcal/d). Individuals were randomized into the following dietary regimens: (1) a high calcium diet (HCD; 1200 – 1300 mg/d) or (2) a low-calcium diet (LCD; < 500 mg/d). ResultsAfter 16 wk of intervention subjects on HCD compared with those on LCD exhibited greater reduction in waist circumference and waist-to-hip ratio. Participants on HCD presented a significant reduction in all biomarkers of endothelial dysfunction evaluated in the study (intracellular adhesion molecule- 1, vascular cell adhesion molecule 1, and E-Selectin), whereas subjects on LCD showed a significant decrease in intracellular adhesion molecule- 1 and E-Selectin. Biomarkers of inflammation and fibrinolysis were reduced in both diets, although without reaching statistical significance. The reduction in all markers of inflammation, fibrinolysis, and endothelial dysfunction was similar in both diets.

40|$|The aim of {{the present}} study was to test the {{hypothesis}} that a prolonged refeeding duration after successful very-low-energy diet (VLED) -induced weight loss beneficially affects weight development and eating behaviour. Patients (it 269) were recruited to a I-year obesity treatment programme with 12 weeks of an initial VLED. After the VLED, patients with 10 % weight loss were randomly allocated to I week (group 1) or 6 weeks (group 6) refeeding to an ordinary, <b>energy-reduced</b> diet, and thereafter followed and actively treated for an additional 40 weeks. Eating behaviour (revised twenty-one-item Three-Factor Eating Questionnaire) was measured at baseline, during and after refeeding, and at week 52. Weight change over time in the two treatment groups was tested by repeated-measures analysis in completers and by intention to treat (ITT). Of the patients, 169 (109 women) lost >= 10 % during the VLED and were randomised. At randomisation, weight loss was - 16. 5 (SD 3. 7) % in group I and - 16. 7 (SD 4 - 3) % in group 6 (P= 0. 73). Between weeks 12 and 52, completers in group 6 regained significantly less weight (3. 9 (SD 9. 1) %) as compared with group 1 (8. 2 (SD 8. 3) % P= 0. 006) (ITT, P= 0. 05). Completers in group 6 also maintained a higher level of dietary restraint after refeeding was completed, but eating behaviour did not differ at week 52. Weight change after the refeeding periods were completed did not differ significantly between the groups (P= 0. 06).

BackgroundDespite the popularity of the VLCHF diet, no studies have compared the chronic effects of weight loss and metabolic change to a conventional HCLF diet under isocaloric conditions. MethodsA total of 88 abdominally obese adults were randomly assigned to either an energy-restricted (∼ 6 to 7 MJ, 30 % deficit), planned isocaloric VLCHF or HCLF diet for 24 weeks in an outpatient clinical trial. Body weight, blood pressure, fasting glucose, lipids, insulin, apolipoprotein B (apoB), and C-reactive protein (CRP) were measured at weeks 0 and 24. ResultsWeight loss was similar in both groups (VLCHF − 11. 9 ± 6. 3 kg, HCLF − 10. 1 ± 5. 7 kg; p = 0. 17). Blood pressure, CRP, fasting glucose, and insulin reduced similarly with weight loss in both diets. The VLCHF diet produced greater decreases in triacylglycerols (VLCHF − 0. 64 ± 0. 62 mmol/l, HCLF − 0. 35 ± 0. 49 mmol/l; p = 0. 01) and increases in high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C) (VLCHF 0. 25 ± 0. 28 mmol/l, HCLF 0. 08 ± 0. 17 mmol/l; p = 0. 002). Low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) decreased in the HCLF diet but remained unchanged in the VLCHF diet (VLCHF 0. 06 ± 0. 58 mmol/l, HCLF − 0. 46 ± 0. 71 mmol/l; p < 0. 001). However, a high degree of individual variability for the LDL response in the VLCHF diet was observed, with 24 % of individuals reporting an increase of at least 10 %. The apoB levels remained unchanged in both diet groups. ConclusionsUnder isocaloric conditions, VLCHF and HCLF diets result in similar weight loss. Overall, although both diets had similar improvements for a number of metabolic risk markers, an HCLF diet had more favorable effects on the blood lipid profile. This suggests that the potential long-term effects of the VLCHF diet for CVD risk remain a concern and that blood lipid levels should be monitored.

The aim of this analysis {{is to provide a}} description of the people in Germany who follow a predominantly vegetarian diet and to compare their food consumption with those of nonvegetarians. As part of DEGS 1 (2008 – 2011), a validated questionnaire was used within a representative sample of 6, 933 persons aged 18 to 79 to study how often and how much of 53 different food groups was consumed during a four-week period. The questionnaire also included a question about {{a vegetarian}} diet. The data were analysed descriptively and with a binary-logistical regression model. In Germany, 4. 3 % of the population (6. 1 % of women and 2. 5 % of men) aged 18 to 79 usually follows a vegetarian diet. The highest proportion of vegetarians is found among 18 - to 29 -year-olds (women 9. 2 % and men 5. 0 %) and among women aged 60 to 69 (7. 3 %). People with a higher level of education are more likely to usually follow a vegetarian diet. The same applies to people who live in large cities and those who conduct more than four hours of sports per week. In addition, women and men who usually follow a vegetarian diet not only consume significantly less meat compared with non-vegetarians, they also drink less <b>energy-reduced</b> drinks, and less beer and wine; they also drink more tea and eat more fruit and vegetables. A vegetarian lifestyle is often associated with positive socio-political impacts. It can, among others, contribute to a reduction in factory farming, which means it can help preserve the environment. A reduction in meat consumption in Germany would also be beneficial from a public health perspective, since meat consumption is currently considerably higher than the amounts recommended by the German Nutrition Society.

OBJECTIVE: We compared the effects of 2 isocaloric diets that differed in protein and fat content on weight loss, lipids, appetite regulation, and energy expenditure after test meals. DESIGN: This was a parallel, randomized study in which subjects received either a low-fat, high-protein (LF-HP) diet (29 +/- 1 % fat, 34 +/- 0. 8 % protein) or a high-fat, standard-protein (HF-SP) diet (45 +/- 0. 6 % fat, 18 +/- 0. 3 % protein) during 12 wk of energy restriction (6 +/- 0. 1 MJ/d) and 4 wk of energy balance (7. 4 +/- 0. 3 MJ/d). Fifty-seven overweight and obese [mean body mass index (in kg/m(2)) : 33. 8 +/- 0. 9] volunteers with insulin concentrations > 12 mU/L completed the study. RESULTS: Weight loss (LF-HP group, 9. 7 +/- 1. 1 kg; HF-SP group, 10. 2 +/- 1. 4 kg; P = 0. 78) and fat loss {{were not significantly different}} between diet groups even though the subjects desired less to eat after the LF-HP meal (P = 0. 02). The decrease in resting energy expenditure was not significantly different between diet groups (LF-HP, - 342 +/- 185 kJ/d; HF-SP, - 349 +/- 220 kJ/d). The decrease in the thermic effect of feeding with weight loss was smaller in the LF-HP group than in the HF-SP group (- 0. 3 +/- 1. 0 % compared with - 3. 6 +/- 0. 7 %; P = 0. 014). Glucose and insulin responses to test meals improved after weight loss (P < 0. 001) with no significant diet effect. Bone turnover, inflammation, and calcium excretion did not change significantly.

This mean value was exceeded in July 2016, which {{is thought to be}} a result of forced limitation in steam production. NOx emissions are reduced secondarily by an urea-based SNCR-system where its efficiency depends on several parameters, foremost sufficiently high flue gas temperatures. This work has identified parameters that effects foremost hydrogen-based combustion emission from the solid fuel boiler. This was achieved by evaluating historical data and by conducting tests during operation of the solid fuel boiler, which was planned and evaluated using a software called MODDE. Emission reducing measures and recommended ways to operate the boiler was then presented from the collected data. Practical measures including down-winding supply machinery of secondary air and replacement of urea injection showed no tendencies in reducing NOx emissions. However, complete shut down of one the furnaces produced at least 100 °C higher flue gas temperatures produced from the active furnace. Low NOx emissions was noted when secondary air was supplied from machinery with original speed. therefor, during stretched periods with low steam production, it's recommended that: Only one furnace should be active as steam producer, urea should be injected at its original placement in the flue gas chamber close the furnace and that secondary air should be supplied by machinery with original speed. Comparison test made in this work showed that this way of operating the solid fuel boiler could reduce NOx emissions with 45 % compared to mean NOx emissions at low steam production in July 2016...|$|R
40|$|Abstract Antiretroviral {{drugs are}} usually {{used for the}} {{treatment}} of Human Immunodeficiency Virus HIV. This virus specifically attacks the lymphocytes so the antiretroviral drugs are designed specifically to block the virus from penetrating into the interior of the cell. The attachment of the virus {{on the surface of the}} lymphocyte will cause a change in the surface area of the cell. Such surface area change is followed by change in surface free energy. This work attempted to estimate the surface free energies of five antiretroviral drugs from absorbance data and their possible effects on the surfaces of the lymphocytes. The absorbance values were measured and using modified form of Lifshitz equation through the concept of Hamaker constants surface energies were calculated. Coating effectiveness studies showed that the drugs preferentially coated the surfaces of lymphocytes as expected. The surface free energies for the drugs varied from 48. 9 mJm 2 for drug 1 to 37. 7 mJm 2 for drug 4. This means that drug 4 that has the lowest surface free energy is more hydrophobic than drug 1. The surface free energies of HIV-infected lymphocytes varied from 9. 3 mJm 2 for drug 3 to 13. 9 mJm 2 for drug 2 being lower than for uninfected lymphocytes by up to a factor of 77 with drug 1 and 62 with drug 4 in blood of patients without previous drug treatment confirming the surface <b>energy-reducing</b> capacity of HIV. The low value of the free energy in drug 4 of 39. 5 mJm 2 is in line with effectiveness value 0. 0245 for drug 4 which is the lowest as shown in table 3. It is interesting to observe that drug 1 which has the highest coating effectiveness 0. 5102 also has the highest surface free energy 47. 5 mJm 2 confirming the existence of some relationship between drug coating of the surface of the blood cell and the cell surface free energy. It is interesting to note that Ozoihu 2014 reported the surface free energy of infected lymphocyte as 31. 812. 36 mJm 2 and that of uninfected cell as 39. 942. 82 mJm 2. While the values for uninfected cell are close to within 3. 2 of each other the values for infected are widely different up to 19. 5. The findings of this research work suggest possible existence of a thermodynamic criterion for HIV-drug interaction prediction that will be a valuable tool in HIV-blood interaction study.

The VLCHF diet produced greater decreases in triacylglycerols (VLCHF - 0. 64 +/- 0. 62 mmol/l, HCLF - 0. 35 +/- 0. 49 mmol/l; p = 0. 01) and increases in high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C) (VLCHF 0. 25 +/- 0. 28 mmol/l, HCLF 0. 08 +/- 0. 17 mmol/l; p = 0. 002). Low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) decreased in the HCLF diet but remained unchanged in the VLCHF diet (VLCHF 0. 06 +/- 0. 58 mmol/l, HCLF - 0. 46 +/- 0. 71 mmol/l; p < 0. 001). However, a high degree of individual variability for the LDL response in the VLCHF diet was observed, with 24 % of individuals reporting an increase of at least 10 %. The apoB levels remained unchanged in both diet groups. CONCLUSIONS: Under isocaloric conditions, VLCHF and HCLF diets result in similar weight loss. Overall, although both diets had similar improvements for a number of metabolic risk markers, an HCLF diet had more favorable effects on the blood lipid profile. This suggests that the potential long-term effects of the VLCHF diet for CVD risk remain a concern and that blood lipid levels should be monitored.

40|$|Summary Introduction: Cigarette {{smoking is}} a major risk factor for the {{development}} of many lifestyle diseases, including cardiovascular disease. Overweight and obesity have also been shown to be associated with an increased risk for several lifestyle diseases, and co-occurrence of overweight and smoking has substantial consequences for health. Smoking cessation and weight reduction are associated with both immediate and long-term benefits including reduced risk of cardiovascular disease and increased life expectancy. Varenicline is an approved smoking cessation product shown to increase the chances of a successful attempt to quit smoking. However, smoking cessation is associated with weight gain, and it is suggested that this weight gain may offset some of the advantages of giving up smoking. Concern regarding post cessation weight gain seems to be a powerful motivator for continued smoking, and post cessation weight gain is also often the reason for relapsing after cessation. It is therefore necessary to find some interventions that may prevent, or at least reduce, the weight gain associated with smoking cessation so that a larger proportion of weight concerned smokers may successfully quit smoking. Aims: The first aim of this thesis was to compare the efficacy of a low fat diet high in complex carbohydrates (LFHCC; ≤ 30 energy % fat, ≤ 20 energy % protein and ≥ 50 energy % carbohydrate) and a high protein diet moderately reduced in carbohydrates (HPMRC; ≥ 25 energy % protein, ≤ 55 energy % fat and ≤ 20 energy % carbohydrates) in preventing short-term weight gain four and 12 weeks after smoking cessation. The second and third aims were to compare the effects of the two diets on body composition and cardiovascular risk factors, respectively, 12 weeks after smoking cessation. The last aim was to compare dietary changes and examine correlations between the dietary changes and changes in body weight four weeks after smoking cessation. Subjects and methods: A total of 80 healthy overweight or obese men and women who were smoking ≥ 10 cigarettes daily and willing to take varenicline were randomized. Mean age was 50 (SD 9) years and mean BMI was 31 (SD 4) kg/m 2. Both groups received individual counseling for diet and smoking cessation with a total of 12 visits, the first visit at the date of screening and the last visit 12 weeks after smoking cessation. Continuous abstinence rates were estimated based on self-reported smoking status, confirmed by CO-measurements at every visit. Body weight was measured every week. Body composition (waist circumference, hip circumference, waist-to-hip ratio, body fat % and muscle mass in kg) and cardiovascular risk factors (blood pressure, fasting blood glucose, total cholesterol, LDL cholesterol, HDL cholesterol, and triglycerides) were measured at randomization and 12 weeks after smoking cessation. For measuring of compliance with the intervention diets, 7 -days weighed records were conducted at randomization and four weeks after smoking cessation. Statistical analyses were performed twice; once for the participants who were abstinent from smoking all 12 weeks after smoking cessation, and once for all completers regardless of their smoking status. Results: A total of 70 participants met at the last visit, with no difference in completion-rates between the intervention groups. Of the participants randomized, 37. 5 % managed to be abstinent from cigarette smoking all twelve weeks after smoking cessation, with {{no significant difference between the}} dietary intervention groups. Four weeks after smoking cessation the change in body weight was not different between the groups (p>. 05), but the HPMRC group had a significant (p. 05). However, both groups showed an increase in HDL (p<. 05). Among all completers, we found mean between-group differences in waist circumference reduction (2. 3 cm [95 % CI. 2, 4. 4], p=. 03), fat mass (1. 6 kg [95 % CI. 3, 2. 9], p=. 02) and triglycerides (. 32 mmol/L [95 % CI. 03,. 62], p=. 03), all in favor of the HPMRC group. Both groups made several significant changes to their dietary composition, but no significant between-group difference in reduction of energy intake. The LFHCC group significantly reduced their intake of fat to ≤ 30 E% while the HPMRC group significantly increased their protein intake to ≥ 25 E%, but neither of the intervention groups met the target level for intake of carbohydrates. Despite this, we found a significant correlation between the change in intake of carbohydrate and change in body weight (r=. 51, p=. 02) in the HPMRC group among the nonsmokers. When we included the reduced smokers we found a significant correlation between changes in intake of protein and fat and changes in body weight (r=. 39, p=. 01 and r=. 36, p=. 02, respectively) in the HPMRC group. Conclusion: Both a moderately <b>energy-reduced</b> diet with decreased intake of fat and increased intake of complex carbohydrate and a moderately <b>energy-reduced</b> diet with increased intake of protein and reduced intake of carbohydrates prevented short-term post cessation weight gain. However, it seems like a diet with increased intake of protein and reduced intake of carbohydrate may result in more beneficial effects, such as decreased body fat, abdominal fat (waist circumference) and triglyceride levels compared to a diet with decreased intake of fat and increased intake of carbohydrate...|$|E
40|$|Obesity is {{associated}} with increased risk of serious medical conditions, impaired quality of life, reduced working capacity, and shortened life expectancy. Obesity surgery {{is the most effective}} weight loss treatment with large health benefits, including reduced mortality. However, the long-term effects on productivity loss are not known. Surgical treatment is not an option for all obese patients and effective dietary treatments are much needed. Very-low-energy diets (VLED) induce rapid and substantial weight loss. After the VLED period, patients switch back to ordinary food. The refeeding period may be crucial in adjusting eating habits to maintain weight loss. The effect of different refeeding strategies on weight development has so far not been examined. VLED does not work for all patients and it is therefore important to understand who will benefit the most from VLED treatment and identify those who need extra support. The aim of this thesis was to test if a prolonged refeeding duration after VLED-induced weight loss improves weight development, to explore factors predicting VLED weight loss and drop out, and to study the effect of obesity surgery on disability pension. Obese patients were recruited to a 1 -year, randomised weight management intervention with 12 weeks of initial VLED. Those who lost at least 10 percent of their weight on the VLED were randomised to either 1 or 6 weeks of refeeding to an ordinary, <b>energy-reduced</b> diet. Patients with longer refeeding regained significantly less weight up to 1 year and maintained higher levels of dietary restraint, reflecting an improved ability to restrict food intake and follow dietary prescriptions. VLED treatment resulted in similar outcomes in women and men. However, the predictors differed by gender. Variables related to perceived physical health, social interaction, socioeconomic factors and obesity-related psychosocial problems predicted VLED outcome. Furthermore, the results suggest that social support and walking capacity are important determinants of successful weight loss in men whereas psychosocial function may influence VLED outcome in women. The Swedish Obese Subjects (SOS) study involves 2010 surgically treated patients and 2037 obese, contemporaneously, matched control patients followed for up to 20 years. The surgically treated patients achieved sustained weight loss whereas the conventionally treated controls were on average weight stable. Information on granted disability pension was obtained for all participants from the Swedish Social Insurance Agency. The risk of disability pension was lower in the surgically treated men than in the control men when adjusting for confounders (HR= 0. 79; 95 % CI: 0. 62 – 1. 00, P= 0. 05). Number of disability pension days was also lower in men (609 versus 734 days, P= 0. 01) in a subgroup followed over 10 years (903 men/ 1994 women) In women, the risk of disability pension or adjusted number of days over 10 years (889 versus 888 days) did not differ between the treatment groups (P= 0. 97). The main findings of this work suggest that weight loss after VLED treatment can be improved by prolonged refeeding, that different factors influence VLED outcome in women and men, and that bariatric surgery {{is associated}} with reduced disability pension in men...|$|E
40|$|University of Minnesota Ph. D. dissertation. August 2012. Major: Applied Economics. Advisors: Timothy Beatty, Stephen Polasky. 1 {{computer}} file (PDF); vii, 169 pages, appendix p. 121 - 169. Many environmental policies have clear public health impacts and {{are designed to}} improve health outcomes either by reducing the environmental health risks individuals encounter in their daily lives, or by encouraging more healthy lifestyles. One way of testing {{the effectiveness of these}} policies is to examine the behavioral changes they induce. In this dissertation, I use the American Time Use Survey (ATUS) to estimate behavioral responses to several environmental policies by examining how individuals shift the amount of time they spend in various activities during the day. The ATUS is a nationally representative, federally administered survey on time use in the United States. The survey collects information on all activities performed by respondents during a designated 24 -hour period. It was first administered in 2003 and has continued throughout every year since, allowing me to collect responses for an 8 -year period, 2003 - 2010. Because each respondent provides detailed information on his/her activities during the designated 24 -hour period, I am able to determine how much time each person spends in various morning, afternoon and, evening activities that may be affected by the policies of interest. Although the ATUS has been in existence for 9 years, it has been under utilized in the economic literature. Researchers have traditionally focused primarily on the budget constraint faced by individuals and households, ignoring the time constraint. Examining how time use is affected by exogenous policy changes has the potential to shed light on many economic questions. For example, the literature has found that as gas prices increase consumption decreases, however; at a very inelastic rate. Analysis of time-use data could add to these findings by examining what behaviors are most affected. Do the higher prices cause individuals to carpool or take public transit to work, or do they contribute to fewer recreational excursions? Do the higher prices make commutes longer or shorter? Does this affect {{the amount of time spent}} working during the day? Time use data sets such as the ATUS can be used to lend insights to many of the behavioral questions we are concerned about in economics. This dissertation consists of three essays that use the ATUS to examine individual responses to different environmental policies with a particular focus on the behavioral responses that may affect health. In the first essay, I investigate whether individuals respond to publicly provided information on air quality by reducing their vigorous outdoor activities, and thus minimizing their exposure to dangerous concentrations of pollutants. In the second essay, I estimate behavioral responses to Daylight Savings Time (DST) by examining how individuals shift the amount of time they spend in activities that may affect residential energy use. Finally, in the third essay I investigate how DST affects the time individuals spend in exercise and other aerobic activities to determine if it can be used as a low cost policy to promote public health. Despite considerable improvements in air quality over the past few decades, there is still concern that the health risks from air pollution are too high. This has lead the EPA and others to push for even stricter emissions and ambient air-quality standards. However, there are concerns that the marginal benefits of additional abatement regulations no longer exceed their increasing marginal costs and that alternative approaches are needed to reduce the health risks from air pollution. Essay 1 investigates the effectiveness of one alternative policy [...] demand-side episodic programs that attempt to reduce exposure on high-pollution days by increasing averting behavior. If effective, these policies offer a lower cost alternative to tighter standards and other supply side policies. Specifically, I study whether individuals respond to daily information provided on air-quality levels, and whether they respond particularly to air quality alerts issued during periods of high pollution. While controlling for individual responses to actual air quality index levels, my results show that individuals engage in averting behavior on alert days by reducing the time they spend in vigorous outdoor activities by 18 percent or 21 minutes on average. With few exceptions, previous DST studies have relied on simulation models to estimate and extrapolate energy savings under different policy programs. Although these studies have found a range of energy savings, Kellogg and Wolf (2007) found that the most sophisticated simulation model available in the literature significantly overstated electricity savings when it was applied to Australian data. This suggests that individuals are not operating completely off the clock (as assumed in previous DST studies), but instead that the time of sunrise and sunset affects their daily behaviors. Essay 2 uses the ATUS to estimate behavioral responses to DST by examining how individuals shift the amount of time they spend sleeping, awake at home, and awake away from home during the day for a time period immediately surrounding a change in the DST regime. Aggregating activities into these three broad categories allows for a simple and clear analysis of how changes in time use due to DST may affect residential energy consumption. Sunrise occurs one hour later in the morning due to DST, meaning that mornings are darker and cooler than they would be on ST. During the cooler months in the spring and fall especially, this may cause individuals to use more lighting and heating electricity regardless of behavioral/time-use adjustments. Similarly, DST causes the late afternoons and early evenings to be warmer and brighter. This should reduce lighting electricity, but likely lead to increased air conditioning use, making the overall impact on afternoon and evening energy consumption ambiguous. Most simulation models suggest that afternoon energy savings do result from DST, and those savings more than offset the increased use in the morning, making DST an <b>energy-reducing</b> policy. However, one cannot accurately draw such conclusions without information on how behaviors change on DST. My results suggest that the DST time shift has the largest impact in the spring, and that individuals are getting up earlier in the morning and spending the additional time at home. This would use additional energy beyond what traditional simulation models predict. Additionally, there is also evidence that individuals are spending less time at home in the evenings, which may reduce energy consumption. Several states have recently discussed legislation to either observe standard time year around or DST year around. These new proposals are interesting because they mark a clear shift in the motivation for DST away from residential energy conservation. Proposals now cite other economic and social costs of DST, whereas the literature to date has focused primarily on energy effects. To address the need for additional research into the other possible behavioral impacts of DST, Essay 3 uses ATUS data to investigate how DST affects the time individuals spend in exercise and other aerobic activities. For example, an additional hour of after-work daylight can be used for biking, jogging, playing golf or tennis, walking, or other aerobic activities. If DST leads to increases in physical activity, there may be a public health argument for adopting year long DST or even double DST. In its 2011 Annual Report on Health Statistics, the Center for Disease Control (CDC) found that only 20 percent of adult Americans meet the federal Physical Activity Guidelines. Given these disappointing numbers and America's obesity problem, DST may prove to be a low cost policy tool to improve health outcomes. In fact, my results suggest that adding an additional hour of evening daylight in the spring results in an additional 16 minutes of exercise on average. In all three essays of this dissertation, the previous literature was narrow in scope, focusing on small geographic regions, and used incomplete outcome measures. Thus, each essay makes a unique contribution to the literature by using a nationally representative data set over a long period of time with detailed data on time use. The results from all three essays also have important policy implications that are discussed further in their respective conclusions...|$|R
40|$|D-Tagatose is an incompletely absorbed {{ketohexose}} (stereoisomer of D-fructose) {{which has}} potential as an <b>energy-reduced</b> alternative sweetener. In an earlier 90 -day toxicity study, rats fed diets with 10, 15 and 20 % D-tagatose exhibited increased liver weights, but no histopathological alterations. To {{determine whether there}} might be any toxicological relevance to this effect, three studies were conducted in male, adult Sprague-Dawley rats. In the first study, four groups received Purina diet (group A), Purina diet with 20 % D-tagatose (group B), SDS diet (group C), or SDS diet with 20 % D-tagatose (group D). For groups A and B, the 28 -day treatment period {{was followed by a}} 14 -day recovery period (Purina diet). Food remained available to all animals until the time of sacrifice. Groups of 10 rats were killed on days 14 (groups A and B), 28 (groups A-D), and 42 (groups A and B). Body weights, as well as weights of wet and lyophilized livers, were determined. The lyophilized livers collected on day 28 from groups A and B were analyzed for protein, total lipid, glycogen, DNA, and residual moisture. By day 14, relative wet liver weights had increased by 23 % in group B. On day 28, the increase was 38 % in group B and 44 % in group D. At the end of the recovery period, the increase had diminished to 14 % in group B. On day 28, liver glycogen content (in %) was significantly increased, and liver protein, lipid, and DNA contents were significantly decreased in group B compared to group A. Total amounts per liver of protein, total lipid, glycogen, and DNA were significantly increased. In the second study, four groups of 20 rats each received SDS diet with 0, 5, 10, and 20 % D-tagatose for 29 - 31 days. The food was available until the time of sacrifice. At termination, plasma was obtained from 10 rats/group for clinicochemical analyses. Five rats/group were subjected to whole-body perfusion, followed by processing of livers for qualitative and quantitative electron microscopic examination. Livers of 6 rats/group were analyzed for acyl-CoA oxidase and laurate 12 -hydroxylase (cytochrome P 450 4 A 1) activity, DNA synthesis (Ki- 67 index), and number of nuclei per unit area of tissue. Liver weights were significantly increased in linear relation to the D-tagatose intake. Plasma transaminases (but not glutamyl transferase and alkaline phosphatase) were increased in the high-dose group. Except for glycogen accumulation, no ultrastructural changes were seen on electron microscopic examination of livers of the control and high-dose groups. Morphometric analysis confirmed the increase of glycogen and the absence of alterations of endoplasmatic reticulum, mitochondria, and Golgi apparatus. The Ki- 67 index did not differ between the groups. A dose-related decrease of the number of nuclei per unit area signified some hepatocellular hypertrophy. Acyl-CoA oxidase and CYP 4 A 1 activity were significantly increased in the mid- and high-dose groups, but these increases were small and not accompanied by electron-microscopic evidence of peroxisome proliferation. In the third study, four groups received SDS diet (groups A and C) or SDS diet with 5 % D-tagatose (groups B and D). All animals were killed on day 28. Groups A and B were fasted for 24 h before sacrifice; groups C and D had food available until sacrifice. Liver weights and liver composition were measured as in Study 1. Relative wet and dry liver weights were increased in response to the treatment in rats killed under the fed condition, but not in rats killed under the fasted condition. The livers of the treated rats (group D) had an increased glycogen content in comparison to the controls (group C). Taken together, these results demonstrate that D-tagatose at dietary levels of 5 - 20 % increases liver glycogen deposition and relative liver weights in nonfasting rats. In fasted rats the 5 % dose level is the no-effect level. At the higher dose levels, the increased glycogen deposition induced minimal hypertrophy and some compensatory growth which reached completion {{before the end of the}} 28 -day treatment period. It is concluded that the liver enlargement seen in response to the consumption of D-tagatose is a physiological response to the treatment-induced increased glycogen deposition. No hepatocellular growth was seen at the 5 % dietary level of D-tagatose (corresponding to an intake of 2. 6 - 2. 8 g/kg body wt), suggesting that the increase of liver glycogen at this dose remained within normal limits. © 1999 Academic Press...|$|E
