40|$|The McLeod, Pirani, <b>Knudsen</b> and {{ionization}} <b>gauges</b> {{have been}} studied as to their suitability {{in the operation of}} large metal vacuum systems with organic vapor pumps now coming into extensive use in modern physics. Advantages and disadvantages of each type based on our experience are critically discussed. The superiority of a <b>gauge</b> on the <b>Knudsen</b> principle for this work is stressed and we present a new design and a simpler mode of operation of such a gauge together with a full discussion of its construction, calibration and characteristics...|$|R
