In contrast to the middle troposphere, <b>air</b> <b>parcels</b> from the Southern Ocean had the lowest frequency, irrespective of the time of year.

50|$|The LCL can {{be either}} {{computed}} numerically, approximated by various formulas, or determined graphically using standard thermodynamic diagrams such as the Skew-T log-P diagram or the Tephigram. Nearly all of these formulations {{make use of the}} relationship between the LCL and the dew point, which is the temperature to which an <b>air</b> <b>parcel</b> needs to be cooled isobarically until its RH just reaches 100%. The LCL and dew point are similar, with one key difference: to find the LCL, an <b>air</b> <b>parcel's</b> pressure is decreased while it is lifted, causing it to expand, which in turn causes it to cool. To determine the dew point, in contrast, the pressure is kept constant, and the <b>air</b> <b>parcel</b> is cooled by bringing it into contact with a colder body (this is like the condensation you see on the outside of a glass full of a cold drink). Below the LCL, the dew point temperature is less than the actual ("dry bulb") temperature. As an <b>air</b> <b>parcel</b> is lifted, its pressure and temperature decrease. Its dew point temperature also decreases when the pressure is decreased, but not as quickly as its temperature decreases, so that if the pressure is decreased far enough, eventually the <b>air</b> <b>parcel's</b> temperature will be equal to the dew point temperature at that pressure. This point is the LCL; this is graphically depicted in the diagram.|$|R

40|$|Knowledge of {{trace gas}} fluxes at the land surface is {{essential}} for understanding the impact of human activities on the composition and radiative balance of the atmosphere. An ability to derive fluxes at the regional scale (on the order of 10 (2) - 10 (4) km 2), at the scale of ecosystems and political borders, is crucial for policy and management responses. Lagrangian ("air mass-following") aircraft experiments have potential for providing direct estimates of regional-scale fluxes by measuring concentration changes in <b>air</b> <b>parcels</b> as they travel over the landscape. Successful Lagrangian experiments depend critically on forecasts of <b>air</b> <b>parcel</b> locations, rate of dispersion of <b>air</b> <b>parcels,</b> and proper assessment of forecast errors. We describe an operational tool to forecast <b>air</b> <b>parcel</b> locations and dispersion and to guide planning of flights for air mass-following experiments using aircraft. The tool consists of a particle dispersion model driven by mesoscale model forecasts from operational centers. The particle model simulates time-reversed motions of <b>air</b> <b>parcels</b> from specified locations, predicting the source regions which influence these locations. Forecast errors are incorporated into planning of Lagrangian experiments using statistics of wind errors derived by comparison with radiosonde data, {{as well as the}} model-to-model spread in forecast results. We illustrate the tool's application in a project designed to infer regional CO 2 fluxes-the CO 2 Budget and Rectification Airborne study, discuss errors in the forecasts, and outline future steps for further improvement of the tool.

If the <b>air</b> <b>parcel</b> is lifting further beyond the LCL, water vapor in the <b>air</b> <b>parcel</b> will begin condensing, forming cloud droplets. (In the real atmosphere, it is usually necessary for air to be slightly supersaturated, normally by around 0.5%, before condensation occurs; this translates into about 10 meters or so of additional lifting above the LCL.) The LCL is a good approximation of the height of the cloud base which will be observed on days when air is lifted mechanically from the surface to the cloud base (e.g., due to convergence of airmasses).|$|R
