25|$|Throughout Lullaby, Streator is the reader's only narrator. True to his {{journalist}} occupation, he is {{detailed in}} many of his descriptions of the events going on around him. At the same time, Streator tends to be philosophical and cynical about {{the world around him}} and the people he meets, probably because of the tragedies that have haunted him for many years. In regards to the actual sequence and happenings of events, he seems to be a reliable narrator. But often his philosophical asides seem to overshadow his duty as a balanced narrator. At times, it <b>is</b> <b>frustrating</b> not knowing the true motives of Helen, Mona, or Oyster and, by the end, it is apparent that Streator could not always be trusted. But the nature of the story insists that we only get one perspective; one man retelling the past that has resulted in the present. Streator himself knows the issues with how he is telling the story, but in his recognition of the potential problems of a first person perspective, he becomes a more reliable narrator.|$|E

It takes a healthy imagination to see the lasers bouncing off one's lightsabre. What's worse is that it's not always obvious where the exit passage is, which <b>is</b> <b>frustrating</b> after a slog through a tough level."

500|$|Mika's {{return to}} the lineup of Street Fighter V was praised by Jason Shreiser of Kotaku, who wrote that [...] "She looks fun to play—check out those wrestling moves — {{but this is an}} odd choice given Mika’s lack of pedigree. Cool throwback, though!" [...] However, after the game's released, her {{gameplay}} has subsequently been criticized for being [...] "cheap". At Eurogamer, Wesley Yin-Poole labelled Mika as SFVs [...] "most hated character", writing [...] "I've seen people criticise R. Mika players for doing nothing but going for this Passion Rope Throw over and over again until it lands. Some within the fighting game community believe this move, as well as the [...] "vortex" [...] style, is not a [...] "high skill" [...] strategy", and as a result Mika has been labelled [...] "cheap" [...] and a [...] "troll character" [...] that <b>is</b> <b>frustrating</b> to play against.|$|E
500|$|Critics praised Time Gals visuals. GameFan magazine, in praising Wolfteam's port of the game, complimented the Mega-CD version's {{graphics}} and short load times. GamePro said the animation is [...] "great, with bright, vivid colors, and fast-paced, exciting movement" [...] and praised the [...] "funny gameplay" [...] and [...] "nonstop action". Shawn Sackenheim [...] of AllGame complimented the animation, calling it [...] "high quality", but criticized the Mega-CD graphics, calling them [...] "downgraded". He commented that, though Time Gal offered a good thrill, it lacked replay value. Author Andy Slaven commented that, though the animation is nice, it can't really be enjoyed while playing. Ciolek echoed similar statements, {{saying it is}} more enjoyable to watch than to play. He further commented that the game <b>is</b> <b>frustrating</b> and rigid when compared to more contemporary standards. Electronic Gaming Monthlys group of reviewers praised the Mega-CD version's graphics quality. Three of the four reviewers lauded the gameplay, specifically the challenge and format. The other reviewer stated he didn't care {{for this type of}} game, referring to the gameplay as [...] "nothing more than memorizing".|$|E
500|$|Although the minigames and {{co-operative}} mode {{were considered}} interesting, the deathmatch mode was criticised for being [...] "slow and clunky". AllGame's McCall {{felt that it}} simply did not work due to the game's unusual manual targeting. Publications also claimed that the controls were complex and confusing. In a negative review, James Bottorff of The Cincinnati Enquirer explained that the control scheme <b>is</b> <b>frustrating</b> because players are required to change from using the analog stick to the C buttons of the Nintendo 64 controller when switching to combat mode. GameSpot said that the controls remain responsive at all times, but acknowledged that the alternation between the two control styles [...] "might prove distasteful to some". In a retrospective review, Andy Green of Nintendo Life stated that Jet Force Gemini is [...] "a really enjoyable game" [...] with [...] "its fair share of flaws that tend to hinder the experience a little too much. That being said, it's certainly an incredibly fun title, at its best, that will definitely raise a few smiles".|$|E

500|$|Justice Sonia Sotomayor {{delivered}} {{the opinion of}} the Court. [...] Sotomayor first noted {{that this was not a}} case of first impression, and that the court had ruled on a similar issue only seven years previously. [...] Sotomayor stated that Cherokee Nation of Okla. v. Leavitt held that when the government makes a contractual promise to pay in return for services, the government is bound to pay for those services. [...] This was a long-standing principle of contract law, dating back to Ferris, and the [...] "principle safeguards both the expectations of Government contractors and the long-term fiscal interests of the United States." [...] If the appropriation exceeds the amount of the individual contract, then the government is bound to honor the contract. [...] Sotomayor stated that although the situation that Congress placed the BIA in <b>is</b> <b>frustrating,</b> but it is an issue for Congress to resolve. [...] The Court affirmed the decision of the Tenth Circuit Court. [...] Justices Antonin Scalia, Anthony Kennedy, Clarence Thomas, and Elena Kagan joined Justice Sotomayor's opinion.|$|E

I don't know many women who go to bed with their husband at night and have sex with a bra on ... So let's make it real in the movies." [...] In 2008, she made her first appearance on AskMen.com's [...] "99 Most Desirable Women" [...] list at number 60. The same year, men's magazine Maxim placed her at number 59 in their annual [...] "Hot 100" [...] rankings. The following year, the magazine ranked her at number four. Although admitting that sex appeal is one of the [...] "best assets", Åkerman considers being beautiful both [...] "a blessing and a curse", stating, [...] "I tend to get a lot of scripts in which people want me to play the trophy wife, which <b>is</b> <b>frustrating</b> because I want the interesting, meaty roles." ...|$|E

In 2005, the US Department of Homeland Security indicated how seriously it takes the ALF when it included them in a list of domestic terrorist threats. The tactics of some of the more determined ALF activists are anathema to many animal rights advocates, such as Singer, who regard the movement as something that should occupy the moral high ground. ALF activists respond to the criticism with the argument that, as Ingrid Newkirk puts it, [...] "Thinkers may prepare revolutions, but bandits must carry them out." ...|$|E
2500|$|The {{practice}} {{existed before}} Winblad's account. In a January 1982 {{review of the}} new IBM Personal Computer, BYTE favorably noted that IBM [...] "refused to acknowledge the existence of any product that {{is not ready to}} be put on dealers' shelves tomorrow. Although this <b>is</b> <b>frustrating</b> at times, it is a refreshing change from some companies' practice of announcing a product even before its design is finished." [...] Creative Computing in March 1984 wrote of Coleco's delay in releasing the Adam that the company [...] "did not invent the common practice of debuting products before they actually exist. In microcomputers, to do so otherwise would be to break with a veritable tradition." [...] After Dyson's article, however, the word became popular among writers in the personal computer software industry as a way to describe products they believed took too long to be released after their first announcement. InfoWorld magazine editor Stewart Alsop helped popularize its use by lampooning Bill Gates, then CEO of Microsoft, with a Golden Vaporware award for the 18-month late release of Microsoft's first version of Windows in 1985. Alsop presented it to Gates at a celebration for the release while the song [...] "The Impossible Dream" [...] played in the background.|$|E

40|$|Abstract: Success {{or failure}} of {{democracy}} are interpreted as different equilibria of a dynamic political game. Democracy <b>is</b> <b>frustrated</b> and fails when voters do not replace corrupt leaders, given some transition cost of changing leadership, and any new leader {{would be likely to}} govern corruptly. Even when new politicians have a small probability of being virtuous, democracy can <b>be</b> <b>frustrated</b> in a unitary political system. But in a federal system, democracy cannot <b>be</b> consistently <b>frustrated</b> at both national and provincial levels, because provincial leaders who govern responsibly could build reputations to become contenders for higher national office. Similarly, democracy cannot <b>be</b> consistently <b>frustrated</b> in a democratization process that begins with decentralized provincial democracy and only later introduces nationally elected leadership...|$|R
2500|$|Räikkonen {{expressed}} his dislike {{of the situation}} {{he found himself in}} during the race with a three [...] pit stop strategy and complained of heavy front tyre degradation and excessive understeer. He informed the press that neither he nor his team identified the source of the problem but appreciated assistance: [...] "To try and drive slowly in certain places didn't make any difference so I don't understand it really. Wherever we finished it's pretty disappointing. Not being able to solve certain issues <b>is</b> <b>frustrating.</b> Hopefully something comes up and we find what the issues are." [...] Similarly, Alonso complained his car had severe tyre vibrations in the final two laps, reducing his visibility: [...] "I tried to control the pace. I was asking for a gap from behind to cross the line just in front of them. But then Vettel overtook [...] Magnussen and {{there was no time to}} save any more so on the last lap I was flat out with huge vibrations." [...] The Williams performance chief Rob Smedley suspected minor issues including Massa's slow pit stop prevented his team from finishing on the podium but praised Ricciardo's performance. Red Bull team principal Christian Horner explained that Vettel's first lap pit stop for medium compound tyres was performed with the intention of not using soft tyres for the rest of the race.|$|E
2500|$|Kevin Young, an African-American {{poet who}} edited a Selected Poems of Berryman for Library of America, commented on this issue: [...] use of [...] "black dialect" [...] <b>is</b> <b>frustrating</b> and even {{offensive}} at times, as many have noted, and deserves examination at length. Nonetheless, the poems are, in part, about an American light {{that is not}} as pure as we may wish; or whose purity may rely not just on success (the dream) but on failure (the song)[...] [...]In turn, the poems are not a song of [...] "myself" [...] but a song of multiple selves. Instead of a cult of personality, we have a clash of personalities—the poems' protagonist Henry speaks not just as [...] "I" [...] but as [...] "he," [...] "we," [...] and [...] "you"[...] [...]Berryman relied on the shifting form to explain in part his disparate personalities[...] [...]The voice shifts from high to low, from archaic language to slang, slant rhyme to full, attempting to render something of jazz or, more accurately, the blues—devil's music. What emerges and succeeds {{is something of a}} sonnet plus some—a devil's sonnet, say (the three sixes stanzas too obvious to be ignored). Berryman's heresy is against the polite modernism that preceded him. That the poem can let in all sorts of Americanisms—not just Greek, as Eliot would have it—and not as signs of culture's decay, but of its American vitality, is fearless and liberating.|$|E
2500|$|The film review {{aggregator}} Rotten Tomatoes reports 71% positive reviews {{based on}} 52 surveyed critics {{and an average}} score of 7.4/10. [...] The site's consensus reads: [...] "The ending {{could use a little}} work but this is otherwise another sterling example of David Fincher's iron grip on atmosphere and storytelling." [...] Metacritic rated it 61/100 based on 19 reviews. Roger Ebert gave the film 3.5 stars out of 4, praising Douglas as [...] "the right actor for the role. He can play smart, he can play cold, and he can play angry. He is also subtle enough that he never arrives at an emotional plateau before the film does, and never overplays the process of his inner change". In her review for The New York Times, Janet Maslin wrote, [...] "Mr. Fincher, like Michael Douglas in the film's leading role, does show real finesse in playing to the paranoia of these times". Time magazine's Richard Corliss wrote, [...] "Fincher's style is so handsomely oppressive, and Douglas' befuddlement is so cagey, that for a while the film recalls smarter excursions into heroic paranoia (The Parallax View, Total Recall)". In his review for The Washington Post, Desson Howe wrote, [...] "It’s formulaic, yet edgy. It’s predictable, yet full of surprises. How far you get through this tall tale of a thriller before you give up and howl is a matter of personal taste. But there’s much pleasure in Fincher’s intricate color schemes, his rich sense of decor, his ability to sustain suspense {{over long periods of time}} and his sense of humor". Entertainment Weekly gave the film a [...] "B+" [...] rating and Owen Gleiberman wrote, [...] "Emotionally, there's not much at stake in The Game — can Nicholas Van Orton be saved?! — but Douglas is the perfect actor to occupy the center of a crazed Rube Goldberg thriller. The movie has the wit to be playful about its own manipulations, even as it exploits them for maximum pulp impact". In his review for the San Francisco Chronicle, Mick LaSalle wrote, [...] "At times The Game <b>is</b> <b>frustrating</b> to watch, but that's just a measure of how well Fincher succeeds in putting us in his hero's shoes". However, Rolling Stone magazine's Peter Travers felt that [...] "Fincher's effort to cover up the plot holes is all the more noticeable for being strained ... The Game has a sunny, redemptive side that ill suits Fincher and ill serves audiences that share his former affinity for loose ends hauntingly left untied".|$|E
