Paul Veyne Marx {{is right to}} {{disagree}} with Ricardo : the quantitative theory {{does not apply to}} metal money. If Roman gold and silver had escaped from Rome to India, as has been affirmed, this would have been critical; even more critical than Mickwitz claimed in a 1934 article for Annales; the consequence, morever, would not have been the collapse of exchange, but a slow recession in demand. Only the <b>gold</b> <b>drain</b> did not exist for Pliny most certainly mentions the 100 million in importations but omits Roman exportations to India.

Drawing on the experience of three core economies (England, France, Germany) and seven peripheral economies (Austria-Hungary, Bulgaria, Greece, Italy, Norway, Serbia, Sweden), my paper argues for a more nuanced perspective on the European periphery. While the conventional view might be true for some countries - most notably the Balkan countries - our findings, based on a VAR model and impulse response functions, suggest that the average <b>gold</b> <b>drain</b> that a specific peripheral economy was exposed to differed substantially from country to country. We also show that some of the peripheral economies, most notably Austria-Hungary, always enjoyed enough pulling power via discount rate policy to reverse quickly any such gold outflow.

The properties of this molecule were studied in detail through a structure-properties relationship study with its regioisomer, that is, 2, 2 '-(2, 7 -dihexyl- 4, 9 -dihydro-s-indaceno[1, 2 -b: 5, 6 -b']dithiophene- 4, 9 -diylidene) dimalononitrile (para-IDT(═C(CN) 2) 2) (see isomer structures in blue in Chart 2). The influence of the bridge functionalization was also investigated by comparison with their diketone analogues meta-IDT(═O) 2 and para-IDT(═O) 2. This study sheds light on the impact of regioisomerism on the electronic properties at the molecular level (electrochemistry, absorption spectroscopy, molecular modeling) and also on the supramolecular arrangement, and finally on the organic field-effect transistors (OFET) performances and stabilities.

The flexibility and dimensional instability of the substrate constituted the main challenge during manufacturing. We developed a novel method to handle the foils during processing by reversibly attaching them onto 6 inch Si wafers. The so-called foil-on-carrier assembly showed excellent flatness (about 1 μm) and good dimensional stability and tolerance towards the different processing steps up to 160 °C.

In order to achieve structures with high resolution, all functional layers were patterned using a commercial wafer stepper (PAS 5500 / 100 D). The two dielectric materials used and the two ways of making the source-drain resulted in four different metal-insulator-metal (MIM) stacks. The MIM stacks were characterized by optical microscopy, scanning electron microscopy and four point resistance measurements. Registration accuracies below 0. 5 μm were found over the whole wafer. Transistor fabrication was finished by depositing pentacene derivatives from solution. © 2011 World Scientific Publishing Company...|$|R
40|$|O f the bullionist {{writers who}} {{advocated}} {{restoration of the}} gold con-vertibility of England’s currency during the Bank Restriction period 1797 – 1821, few are as little known today as John Wheatley. Certainly his name is not as familiar as those of David Ricardo, Henry Thornton, Thomas Malthus, Francis Horner, William Huskisson, and other bullionists. Yet in some respects {{he was the most}} original of the group. His Essay on the Theory of Money and Principles of Commerce (1807) spelled out the logic and implica-tions of the strict bullionist position more forcefully and systematically than any document before Ricardo’s High Price of Bullion: A Proof of the Depreciation of Bank Notes (1810). To Wheatley belongs much of the credit for expounding at least four hard-line bullionist propositions often attributed to Ricardo. First, money-stock changes have no effect on output and employment. Second, exchange rate de-preciations, a high price of <b>gold,</b> and specie <b>drains</b> stem solely from an excess issue of currency. Third, being purely monetary phenomena, exchange rate changes, gold price movements, and specie drains are immune to real shocks operating through the balance of payments. Fourth, exchange rate depreciation and the excess of market over mint price of gold constitute proof and measure of overissue in inconvertible paper regimes. To these can be added a fifth con-tribution: his demonstration that monetary expansion and price inflation can continue indefinitely on a given gold base if all countries expand in step. Wheatley derived these propositions from an analytical model character-ized by sharp dichotomization of real and monetary sectors. He sought to show that monetary shocks do not affect real variables nor real shocks monetar...|$|R
40|$|Despite the {{tremendous}} potential of all oxide thin film transistors for application in large area microelectronics further advancements have been {{hampered by the}} lack of hole transporting oxides with similar or comparable transport characteristics to their n-type counterparts. Although there are a few studies reporting p-type doping of traditional n-type oxides, the subject still remains controversial and stable p-type material has not been reproducibly observed. Hence, alternative metal oxides that show intrinsic p-type characteristics are required especially for applications in CMOS (complementary metal oxide semiconductor). There has been some success with alternative materials such as Cu 2 O and SnOx and indeed p-type TFTs were reported[1]. However TFTs incorporating Cu 2 O as a semiconducting channel suffer from a very low field effect mobility (< 10 - 2 cm 2 V- 1 s- 1) making it unsuitable for CMOS applications. Additionally, these TFTs show high off-state currents that indicate the presence {{of a large number of}} copper vacancy defect states that pin the Fermi Level in the device. Here we report the fabrication of hole-transporting NiOx-based TFTs. Nickel nitrate hexahydrate and erythritol solutions in ethanol (0. 2 M) were spin coated onto fused silica, c-Si, spray coated Al 2 O 3 gate dielectrics and glass and underwent thermal annealing at different temperatures in air. Analyses revealed that at the optimum annealing temperature of about 340 oC NiOx films (80 nm) with optical band gap of about 3. 6 eV and overall transmittance in the visible spectrum in excess of 75 % were produced. X-ray diffraction showed both cubic and hexagonal NiOx polycrystalline material (average crystal size of 15 nm) embedded in a dominant amorphous matrix. TFTs employing thermal evaporated <b>gold</b> source and <b>drain</b> contacts exhibit excellent hole transport characteristics with negligible hysteresis, low operating voltages (- 10 V), high hole mobility in the order of 10 cm 2 V− 1 s− 1 and high current on/off ratio of about 10 ^ 4.
