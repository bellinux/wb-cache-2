40|$|Why has the IS/LM model persisted? In {{this paper}} I {{consider}} that question, {{along with the}} related, {{and in some ways}} more interesting, question of how the use of the IS/LM model has changed over time. I begin by discussing some general issues about the persistence of IS/LM and how its treatment has changed, presenting some bibliometric evidence about the appearance of IS/LM in the literature over the last forty years. Then I look specifically at how the treatment of IS/LM has evolved from the 1960 s until today, comparing a 1960 s <b>intermediate</b> <b>macro</b> text with a modern intermediate text. Finally, I relate that discussion to some thoughts {{about the future of the}} IS/LM model. Some General Comments on the Persistence of IS/LM IS/LM analysis is a creature of pedagogy, and to understand its persistence one must understand the nature of economic pedagogy in the <b>intermediate</b> <b>macro</b> course, where the IS/LM model predominates. Since just about every economics student takes <b>intermediate</b> <b>macro,</b> just about every economist has taken <b>intermediate</b> <b>macro,</b> so as long as IS/LM continues to be used in that <b>intermediate</b> <b>macro</b> course, IS/LM will retain its central role in rough and ready discussions of macro policy.

40|$|Two {{distinct}} routes lead to {{the creation}} of multi [...] scale equilibrium structures in dense degenerate plasmas, often met in astrophysical conditions. By analyzing an e-p-i plasma consisting of degenerate electrons and positrons with a small contamination of mobile classical ions, we show {{the creation of a new}} macro scale L_macro (controlled by ion concentration). The temperature and degeneracy enhancement effective inertia of bulk e-p components also makes the effective skin depths larger (much larger) than the standard skin depth. The emergence of these <b>intermediate</b> and <b>macro</b> scales lends immense richness to the process of structure formation, and vastly increases the channels for energy transformations. The possible role played by this mechanism in explaining the existence of large-scale structures in astrophysical objects with degenerate plasmas, is examined.

40|$|We define {{social action}} as a {{strategy}} to obtain limited social change at the <b>intermediate</b> or <b>macro</b> levels of society which is generally used in nonconsensus situations and employs both 2 ̆ 2 norm-adhering 2 ̆ 2 and 2 ̆ 2 norm-testing 2 ̆ 2 modes of intervention. In this formulation, the key concept is social change. This paper proposes to explore certain aspects of social change as they apply to social action. The discussion {{is divided into two}} parts. The first is a brief summary of pertinent social change theory, presented as background for part two in which are presented and discussed certain propositions about planned change that are critical to any social action endeavor. This treatment, obviously, will not cover every subconcept of social change that is applicable to social action. Nor does it include a direct discussion of power, crucial as this is for social action; that requires a separate treatment of its own. Only five concepts are selected and discussed: social movements, crisis, conflict, resistance to change, and legitimacy...|$|R
40|$|Canadian {{engineers}} contributed {{much to the}} nation’s {{economic and}} technical development, but their assignments have evolved considerably over the years. Engineers moved from being craftsmen and builders of structures to project leaders. system designers, and managers. Engineering is more science-based, but practical design remains paramount. Engineers have many career options; they function in technical, managerial, and hybrid tasks. Their loyalty now is to projects or teams, but they make organizational and professional commitments. Perspectives and Methodology We adopted three different viewpoints in writing this essay: micro, <b>intermediate,</b> and <b>macro.</b> Put differently, we look at engineers and the engineering profession in Canada from perspectives that reflect the individual, the organization, and the nation. Our goal in using these three different approaches is to offer a tapestry of richness that truly defines a significant group {{in the history of}} Canada. We use findings from the fields of history, the social sciences, management/business, and, of course, engineering and applied sciences. Our bibliography is long, but it is truly just a sample; however, it is representative of the numerous items that we collected for this report. In sum, we offer a qualitative meta-analysis of...|$|R
40|$|Austrians {{frequently}} {{lament the}} absence of an Austrian undergraduate money-macro curriculum, especially at the intermediate level. This is ironic in that a large body of work currently exists, both from “the masters ” and more recent researchers, that provides the essential theoretical underpinnings and historical and empirical analysis from which to mount a coherent Austrian macro course suitable for second or third year students. Unfortunately, that literature generally presupposes significant background knowledge in Austrian economics and thus does not ordinarily serve as a suitable platform upon which to build an intermediate money-macro course. I shall suggest all the components for such a course are in hand save one: an <b>intermediate</b> <b>macro</b> text appropriate for classroom use.

40|$|Many modern code {{generation}} methods use tree {{pattern matching}} with dynamic programming. However, {{especially in the}} case of an irregular special-purpose processor architecture their lack of transparency and stability may be problematic: it is difficult to predict the exact code generation result in advance, and the effects of a modification in the code generation rules may be surprisingly wide. In contrast, macro expansion techniques are intuitively transparent. When global variables are disallowed, macro expansion typically has the Church-Rosser property: the final expansion result is independent of the expansion order of the individual <b>intermediate</b> <b>macro</b> calls. Besides enabling parallel implementation, order-independence means stability: the effects of modifying a macro definition are guaranteed to remain local. The locality is actually the problem with macro expansion; code optimization is improved when an assembly language macro is sensitive to its context. For instance, it should [...] ...|$|E

This US performance did not happen in a global vacuum. Globalization of US IT firms promoted deeper integration of IT throughout the US economy, which in turn promoted more extensive globalization in other sectors of the US economy and labor market. How will the increasingly globalized IT industry affect US long-term growth, <b>intermediate</b> <b>macro</b> performance, and disparities in the US labor market? What policies are needed to ensure that the United States remains first in innovation, business transformation, and education and skills, which are prerequisites for US economic leadership in the 21 st century?

30|$|Brush et al. (2009) use an {{organizational}} framework {{to review the}} academic literature on women entrepreneurship. They propose a gender-aware framework for a holistic understanding of the phenomenon of women entrepreneurship. Founded on institutional theory, they build a framework around 3 Ms (markets, money and management) and add two more constructs (motherhood and meso/macro environment) to construct a 5  M framework to study women entrepreneurship. They report that the variable Motherhood is a metaphor, which represents female entrepreneur’s household and family context. This can have a much larger impact {{especially in the case}} of female entrepreneurs as compared to male entrepreneurs. Going beyond the domain of markets, the meso/macro environment tries to capture influences of society, culture (<b>macro),</b> <b>intermediate</b> structures and institutions (meso).|$|R
40|$|In {{this article}} we discuss macro and micro goal setting approaches, {{focusing}} on the relations between goals at different organisational levels. Translating strategic goals in a top-down manner throughout the organisation is a rather complex process. In organisations, at least one <b>intermediate</b> level between <b>macro</b> (i. e. strategic) and micro (i. e. operational) goals can be distinguished: the level of meso (i. e. tactical) goal setting. The process of a strategic dialogue is introduced to arrive at organisational goal coherence, which is defined as consensus on goal priorities within single constituencies and between multiple constituencies at different organisational levels. This process is illustrated in a case study, in which the CATPCA method {{has been applied to}} empirically operationalise degrees of consensus. Effects of the strategic dialogue on organisational goal coherence are demonstrated...|$|R
40|$|Governance {{comprises}} {{a network}} of interdependent connections between various actors. The performance of governance institutions should be measured, both quantitatively (efficiency, effectiveness and economy dimensions) and qualitatively (outcomes and impact on society). Such measuring endeavours should occur {{against the background of}} globally-accepted principles of ‘good’ and ‘outcomes-based’ governance. It should further be facilitated by the design and establishment of comprehensive monitoring and evaluation systems. The question may be asked as to what extent the South African Government complies with international best practices to measure the goodness of its policy, strategy, programme and project interventions. The focus of this article is thus to critique the system utilised by the South African Government to measure the goodness of government (institutional perspectives) as well as the goodness of governance (network, ‘joined-up’, societal perspectives). A <b>macro,</b> <b>intermediate</b> and micro framework is utilised for this purpose. [URL]...|$|R
40|$|When {{compared}} to more traditional {{fields of study}} in the discipline, the application of economic principles to sport {{is a relatively new}} endeavor. It has been only 50 years since Simon Rottenberg (1956) published “The baseball players labor market, ” the first article about sports economics which appeared in a top journal. 1 As late as 1980, only 24 journal publications had appeared that covered sports, but since then the field has exploded: From 1981 through 2004 there were a total of 683 journal articles focusing on sports economics and the Journal of Sports Economics was founded in 2000 (von Allmen, 2005). 2 Commensurate with increasing research activity has been the growth of courses dedicated to sports economics. Economists with interest in the field have developed and offered courses in sports economics at more than 70 institutions in the United States and many more internationally (Humphreys, 2005). These courses are usually offered as upper-level electives for economics majors, and as such they are often taught assuming that the students had already taken courses in <b>intermediate</b> <b>macro</b> and micro theory and econometrics. At the same time, the number of sport management degree programs has increased to the extent that today more than 170 universities award bachelors degrees in sport management in th...|$|E
40|$|In 1962, Arthur Okun posited an {{empirical}} {{relationship between the}} change in the unemployment rate and real output growth. Since then, the media, policymakers, pundits, and <b>intermediate</b> <b>macro</b> students have used the so-called Okun’s law {{as a rule of thumb}} to relate changes in unemployment to changes in output growth. However, some studies have suggested that the relationship has not been stable over time. Furthermore, the slow recovery of U. S. unemployment relative to output after the Great Recession has led some to question whether Okun’s law has changed permanently. In this light, the authors reconsider the evidence on instability in Okun’s law and, in particular, examine whether the Great Recession has contributed to the breakdown of the empirical relationship. (JEL C 22, E 32) Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis Review, September/October 2012, 94 (5), pp. 399 - 418. Many macroeconomic textbooks contain a rule of thumb relating real output growth to changes in the unemployment rate. 1 This relationship, called Okun’s law after Okun (1962), typically assigns a 2 - to 3 -percentage-point decrease in real gross domestic product (GDP) growth to a 1 -percentage-point increase in the unemployment rate. 2 Unlike laws in the physical sciences (e. g., Newton’s laws of motion), Okun’s law is an (arguably loose) empirical correlation and is, in general, neither theoretically motivated nor strictly adhered to in the data. 3 As man...|$|E
40|$|Practical men, {{who believe}} {{themselves}} to be quite exempt from any intellectual influences, are usually the slaves of some defunct econ-omist. Madmen in authority, who hear voices in the air, are distilling their frenzy from some academic scribbler {{of a few years}} back. John Maynard Keynes By the mid- 1990 s, most macroeconomists had probably assumed that the concept of a “liquidity trap ” was safely dead and buried. Many of the newer <b>intermediate</b> <b>macro</b> texts failed to even mention the term. It would hardly be the first time, however, that a seemingly discred-ited macroeconomic concept suddenly regained a measure of respect-ability. With prominent macroeconomists, such as Paul Krugman (1998), now offering advice on how Japan can escape from its liquidity trap, it is appropriate to look at some neglected historical and theo-retical issues raised by that dubious concept. Although it is easy to find definitions of the term “liquidity trap,” 1 its original meaning and interpretation are somewhat unclear. For instance, what did Keynes actually intend when he used the term “liquidity trap ” in the General Theory? How does the modern inter-pretation differ? How can we identify the existence of a liquidity trap? What policies can prevent its formation, or allow an economy to move out of an existing trap? What monetary policy is optimal in a liquidity trap? Until very recently, contemporary macroeconomists had given little thought to those questions. Many of the answers are surprising...|$|E
40|$|The cochlea is a fluid-filled organ with {{multiple}} structures. The {{scales of the}} structures in the cochlea range from millimeter (macro) to sub-micrometer (micro). In this work, both the micro and macro fluidic effects in cochlear mechanics are studied to understand the working mechanism of the cochlea. Topics include wave generation and propagation, fluid viscosity, complex boundary conditions for fluid-structure interactions, power flow, and inverse problems. In addition, a method is developed {{to bridge the gap}} for the modeling effort among different scales. This method is applicable to other fluid-structure coupling problems {{with multiple}} scales. The entire work is based on a physiologically-based finite element cochlear model that couples mechanical, electric, and acoustic fields. On the macro scale, the direction of wave propagation is studied under various stimulation methods, including acoustic, bone conduction, internal force, and internal pressure sources excitations. In a passive cochlea, the reciprocity relation holds. The effect of structural (active component) perturbations on the wave propagation is also analyzed. Multiple sources are identified to the contribution of the extended ringings of the basilar membrane under an impulse response. The power dissipation and amplification are analyzed in the cochlear channels as well. On the micro scale, the viscous flow in the sub-tectorial membrane region is modeled. The flow is coupled to the motion of surrounding micro structures. The micro fluid is also coupled to the macro fluid. The model combines both analytical solutions for the micro fluid-structure interaction and numerical solutions for the <b>intermediate</b> and <b>macro</b> scale fluid behaviors. The interactive usage of analytic and numerical solutions makes the multiscale model computationally efficient and physically interpretable. This model provides a tool to determine the spatial dependence of flow modality in the sub-tectorial membrane region; determine the relative importance of motility (either outer hair cell somatic or hair bundle motility) on inner hair cell hair bundle stimulation; and analyze the role of the Hessen's stripe and the noise to signal ratio in the hearing...|$|R
40|$|Management {{education}} and development are recognised as highly problematic in advanced industrial societies {{that have a}} relatively long tradition of management theory and practice. Problems of developing managerial competence become all the more acute in non-Western societies that require the transfer of managerial know-how from external, mainly Western sources. The focus of this thesis is Continuing Management Education {{as a vehicle for}} Management Development with special reference to Bahrain as a transitional society. The investigation serves as a context for evaluating the transferability of selected Western Management theories to non-Western *environments. Special emphasis is placed on the concepts of leadership, motivation and managerial professionalism, following a detailed empirical investigation of the Bahrain management culture at the <b>macro,</b> <b>intermediate</b> and micro levels. A strategy for Continuing Management Education is designed within the broader context of scanning four major management development options available to Bahrain, namely Westernisation, Bahrainisation, Japanisation and Pragmatisation. The latter option is recommended in the light of evidence generated through a collaborative approach involving an extensive survey of the management community. The strategy is applied to Bahrain through evaluating Gulf Polytechnic's Continuing Management Education Programme (COMEP) against it and identifying areas where specific correctives are needed. An explicit attempt is made to develop some guidelines pertinent to cross-cultural management theory transfer with special reference to such variables as specificity of a particular theory, its level of analysis and its methodological structure. At a parallel level, an effort is made to derive pertinent lessons of experience; both in policy terms and on theoretical grounds, out of the Bahrain case by way of a series of tentative generalizations whose applicability extends beyond Bahrain to the Gulf region, the Middle East and possibly other transitional societies. The research is based on a processual-developmental qualitative methodology and amounts to a managerial evaluation of a particular body of management theory and practice. This choice was partly influenced by the author's duality of roles as researcher and director of a major institution of higher learning. A future research agenda is also charted out...|$|R
