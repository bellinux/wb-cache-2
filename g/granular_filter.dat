40|$|Granular {{filters are}} {{traditionally}} used for water filtration and recently {{they are being}} extensively used in several chemical engineering applications. Computational fluid dynamics (CFD) simulations are a cost-effective tool for the design and development of granular filters in applications such as fast pyrolysis of biomass for bio-oil production. The predictive capability of CFD simulations of granular filtration strongly depends on the equations governing the concentration of particulates and {{the model for the}} filtration rate. The primary objective of this work is to understand and investigate the filtration of inertial particulates in a <b>granular</b> <b>filter,</b> and develop high fidelity models using direct numerical simulations. Particle-resolved direct numerical simulation (PR-DNS) is a first-principles approach to develop accurate models for interphase momentum, energy, heat transfer in gas-solid flow and can be developed to study granular filtration. Another objective is to test these developed models in the CFD code ANSYS-FLUENT to simulate a full-scale moving bed <b>granular</b> <b>filter.</b> A direct numerical simulation-Lagrangian particle tracking (DNS-LPT) approach has been developed to simulate moving-bed granular filtration. It is established that DNS-LPT simulations give numerically converged results. The penetration and single-collector efficiency obtained from DNS-LPT gives good match with published results. The DNS-LPT results show that for inertial particles in a <b>granular</b> <b>filter</b> there is a significant nonzero mean slip between particles and fluid. A modified effective Stokes number that gives a good collapse of single-collector efficiency is obtained from DNS-LPT data. Using DNS-LPT simulations we developed a model for filter coefficient in terms of the modified effective Stokes number {{that can be used in}} CFD simulations. An analytical framework for calculating filter efficiency of polydisperse particles in a granular bed is developed for cases where inertial impaction and interception are the principal filtration mechanisms. The developed framework can be used for both the Stokes flow and moderate Reynolds number. The results obtained from the analytical framework give a good match with the DNS-LPT results. The DNS-LPT approach has been used to study bouncing of particles from granule surface by implementing hard-sphere collision between particles and granules. The DNS-LPT results of filter efficiency is compared with the results obtained using laser-based experiments performed by collaborators. The DNS-LPT simulations for bouncing particles are used to develop a model for adhesion probability of inertial particles in a <b>granular</b> <b>filter.</b> In addition to the model development, the developed models are implemented and tested in the CFD code ANSYS-FLUENT to simulate a full-scale moving-bed <b>granular</b> <b>filter...</b>|$|E
40|$|Granular {{filters are}} {{provided}} {{for the safety of}} water retaining structure for protection against piping failure. The phenomenon of piping triggers when the base soil to be protected starts migrating in the direction of seepage flow under the influence of seepage force. To protect base soil from migration, the voids in the filter media should be small enough but it should not also be too small to block smooth passage of seeping water. Fulfilling these two contradictory design requirements at the same time is a major concern for the successful performance of <b>granular</b> <b>filter</b> media. Since Terzaghi era, conventionally, particle size distribution (PSD) of granular filters is designed based on particle size distribution characteristics of the base soil to be protected. The design approach provides a range of D 15 f value in which the PSD of <b>granular</b> <b>filter</b> media should fall and there exist infinite possibilities. Further, safety against the two critical design requirements cannot be ensured. Although used successfully for many decades, the existing filter design guidelines are purely empirical in nature accompanied with experience and good engineering judgment. In the present study, analytical solutions for obtaining the factor of safety with respect to base soil particle migration and soil permeability consideration as proposed by the authors are first discussed. The solution takes into consideration the basic geotechnical properties of base soil and filter media as well as existing hydraulic conditions and provides a comprehensive solution to the <b>granular</b> <b>filter</b> design with ability to assess the stability in terms of factor of safety. Considering the fact that geotechnical properties are variable in nature, probabilistic analysis is further suggested to evaluate the system reliability of the filter media that may help in risk assessment and risk management for decision making...|$|E
40|$|Occurrences of inadequacies of subballast as a {{filtration}} {{layer of}} the ballasted rail tracks would become persistent if inappropriate criteria were still {{being used in the}} design. Traditionally, the subballast is considered mainly to act as a stress dissipation layer, more commonly known as a capping layer. Attention towards its function as a <b>granular</b> <b>filter</b> is proven by the fact that common design practice uses design criteria that are primarily based on steady seepage loading that is common in embankment dams. The seepage hydraulics through porous media is influenced by the cyclic mechanical loading generated by passing trains. Under the influence of cyclic train loading, subballast particles rearrange and attempt to attain a more stable configuration through the process of vertical compression, lateral spreading, and particle degradation. The deformability of the pore medium itself would then affect the filter condition due to the changes in porosity and its subsequent impact on hydraulic conductivity. This paper presents a procedure that combines a family of formulations and configuration charts that considers the effectiveness of the subballast as a <b>granular</b> <b>filter</b> being dependent on the reduction of its porosity and hydraulic conductivity over time...|$|E

40|$|A {{study was}} {{conducted}} {{to assess the impact of}} media aging on Cryptosporidium parvum transport and retention in <b>granular</b> <b>filters.</b> Column experiments were conducted with sand, anthracite and granular activated carbon (GAC) filters. All columns possessed an identical filter design and grain size distribution. Oocyst removal was evaluated with both new and aged media. The variation of performance amongst new media was attributed to the shape of the tested granular media and to the concentration of extractable metals on the surface of collector grains. Media aging significantly increased the treatment performance of sand (26 %) and of GAC (31 %) but had no influence on the performance of anthracite. This enhanced performance of aged media correlated well with the extent of biofilm development. The best removal performance was observed with aged GAC (71 ± 2 %) which supported the highest amount of biomass according to polysaccharide and protein measurements. The results of this investigation are of particular interest as they suggest that media aging increases the removal of protozoan parasites in full-scale <b>granular</b> <b>filters.</b> SCOPUS: ar. jinfo:eu-repo/semantics/publishe...|$|R
40|$|The {{retention}} {{capability of}} <b>granular</b> <b>filters</b> {{is controlled by}} the narrow constrictions connecting the voids within the filter. The theoretical justification for empirical filter rules used in practice includes consideration of an idealised soil fabric in which constrictions form between co-planar combinations of spherical filter particles. This idealised fabric has not been confirmed by experimental or numerical observations of real constrictions. This paper reports the results of direct, particle-scale measurement of the constriction size distribution (CSD) within virtual samples of <b>granular</b> <b>filters</b> created using the discrete-element method (DEM). A previously proposed analytical method that predicts the full CSD using inscribed circles to estimate constriction sizes is found to poorly predict the CSD for widely graded filters due to an over-idealisation of the soil fabric. The DEM data generated are used to explore quantitatively the influence of the coefficient of uniformity, particle size distribution and relative density of the filter on the CSD. For a given relative density CSDs form a narrow band of similarly shaped curves when normalised by characteristic filter diameters. This lends support to the practical use of characteristic diameters to assess filter retention capability...|$|R

The influence of the electric charges carried by particle and grains on filtration efficiency was revealed {{and there was a}} close agreement between the model and measured values without electric charges. Variation in the efficiency and pressure drop during filtration, hence gradual clogging of the bed, was studied using two types of column.

40|$|As {{deposits}} {{accumulate in}} a <b>granular</b> <b>filter,</b> pressure drop across the filter bed {{required to maintain}} a constant fluid flow rate may increase. Two pressure drop increase patterns had been observed. In slow sand filters pressure drop remains unchanged for {{a certain period of}} time then increases exponentially with the volume of filtrate; in granular aerosol filters pressure drop increases linearly with the amount of deposits from the beginning of the filtration process. New concepts of homogeneous and heterogeneous depositions were introduced in this paper. A statistical model based on these new concepts was developed. This non-linear model was able to reproduce both observed pressure drop increase patterns, including the linear one. Excellent agreements between the present model and experimental measurements were obtained. It was concluded that the two pressure drop increase patterns were indeed caused by different deposit distributions rather than different pressure drop increase mechanisms.

40|$|Gravimetric and {{volumetric}} sampling {{techniques are}} reliable for {{the measurement of}} porosity in fully saturated granular filters. However, both methods require a significant effort to gather and prepare samples, are time intensive to process, and do not capture real-time changes.

These probes measure the dielectric properties of the soil-water mixtures from which the porosity of filters may be inferred. This study demonstrates that generalized calibrations can result in large errors for porosity estimation when using diverse and small-scale filter types. By comparing with gravimetric and volumetric based porosity measurements for saturated <b>granular</b> <b>filter</b> porosity, impedance probes with filter-specific calibration offer the reliability and confidence owing to its reduced error in a quick, nondestructive fashion.

The batch equilibria between dissolved phosphorus (DP) and three engineered AlOx coated media (soil-based, AOCMc; pumice-based, AOCMp; Portland cement concrete-based, AOCMpcc) were investigated. Media isotherms are evaluated with surrogate matrix in de-ionized (DI) water, municipal wet weather flow (rainfall-runoff) and dry weather (wastewater) matrices. Compared to the uncoated media substrates, AOCM provides statistically significantly higher equilibra capacity. Wet and dry weather flow matrices had lower DP adsorption compared to the DI matrix due to competitive effects, in particular SO 42 -. As compared to AOCMc and AOCMp isotherms AOCMpcc exhibited an increasing mass transfer gradient with increasing DP concentration; driven by surface precipitation. A series of <b>granular</b> <b>filter</b> materials were also tested in batch equilibrium experiments using the equivalent surrogate matrix of DI water. Results were modeled using Freundlich isotherm equation. Another unified sorption variable, Ku was calculated {{and served as a}} more appropriate parameter for media evaluation and comparison. At Ce = 0. 03 mg/L, Ku values ranged from 25. 68 to 0. 09 L/g for the media tested in this study, indicating a significant variability of the media capacity. This study also examined the kinetics of DP mass transfer from the aqueous matrix to the media. A 2 nd order potential driving model is utilized for the overall rate process. Comparing synthetic- and actual rainfall-runoff matrices demonstrated that actual runoff produced slower overall rate kinetics for AOCMc and AOCMp primarily due to the presence of competitive ions (SO 42 -) while elevated Ca 2 + at the alkaline surface of AOCMpcc offset the effect of SO 42 -, through surface precipitation. Commercially available media exhibited a large variance of capacities. Column breakthrough experiments of DP from granular media were also conducted. Thomas model was utilized to simulate the breakthrough curves of AOCM.

40|$|<b>Granular</b> media <b>filters</b> are {{commonly}} used to remove suspended solids and prevent emitter clogging in microirrigation systems. Silica sand is the standard filtering media but other granular materials {{can be used for}} this purpose. The characterization of the pressure drop produced by the clean filtering media is of practical interest for designing and managing these filters. Different models such as Ergun or Kozeny-Carman equations are usually used to predict pressure drop produced by the filtering media. However, as parameters of the media such as equivalent diameter and sphericity, that are difficult to determine, appear in these equations, the objective {{of this study was to}} construct a new model to estimate the pressure drop of different filtering materials of interest in <b>granular</b> <b>filters</b> with limited data of the physical parameters that characterize the filtering media. This paper, taking as starting point the multivariate adaptive regression splines (MARS), develops a new algorithm hybridizing it with the artificial bee colony (ABC) method, to estimate the pressure drop in <b>granular</b> <b>filters</b> broadly used in microirrigation systems for the first time with a data-driven model. Laboratory experiments were used to measure pressure drop across silica sand, crushed glass, modified glass and glass microspheres in a scaled filter at surface velocities ranging from 0. 004 to 0. 025 m s − 1. The ABC method allows the tuning of the MARS parameters during the training phase improving significantly the regression accuracy. Additionally, a multilayer perceptron network (MLP) and M 5 model tree were fitted to the experimental data for comparison purposes. The results have shown that ABC-MARS-based model was the best estimation of the pressure drop with a coefficient of determination of 0. 78.

The project includes investigations of the indirectly-heated gasifier, development of particulate removal equipment, evaluation of catalytic methods for upgrading producer gas, development of contaminant measurement and control techniques, modeling of the thermal performance of the ballasted gasifier, and estimation {{of the cost of}} hydrogen from the proposed gasification system. Specific technologies investigated include a thermally ballasted gasifier, a moving bed <b>granular</b> <b>filter,</b> and catalytic reactors for steam reforming and water-gas shift reaction. The approach to this project was to employ a pilot-scale (5 ton per day) gasifier to evaluate the thermally ballasted gasifier as a means for producing hydrogen from switchgrass. A slipstream from the gasifier was used to evaluate gas cleaning and upgrading options. Other tests were conducted with laboratory-scale equipment using simulated producer gas. The ballasted gasifier operated in conjunction with a steam reformer and two-stage water-gas shift reactor produced gas streams containing 54. 5 vol-% H 2. If purge gas to the feeder system could be substantially eliminated, hydrogen concentration would reach 61 vol-%, which closely approaches the theoretical maximum of 66 vol-%. Tests with a combined catalyst/sorbent system demonstrated that steam reforming and water-gas shift reaction could be substantially performed in a single reactor and achieve hydrogen concentrations exceeding 90 vol-%. Cold flow trials with a laboratory-scale moving bed <b>granular</b> <b>filter</b> achieved particle removal efficiencies exceeding 99 %. Two metal-based sorbents were tested for their ability to remove H 2 S from biomass-derived producer gas.

The comparison of the measured aerodynamic resistances of the horizontal and vertical iodine air filters is conducted. The main conclusion is that {{the magnitude of the}} aerodynamic resistance of the horizontal iodine air filters is much smaller in comparison with the magnitude of the aerodynamic resistance of the vertical iodine air filters at the same loads of the air dust aerosol volumes. It is explained that the direction of the air dust aerosol blow and the direction of the gravitation force in the horizontal iodine air filter are orthogonal, hence the effective accumulation of the small dispersive coal dust particles takes place at the bottom of absorber in the horizontal iodine air filter. It is found that the air dust aerosol stream flow in the horizontal iodine air filter is not limited by the appearing structures, made of the precipitated small dispersive coal dust particles, in distinction from the vertical iodine air filter, in the process of long term operation of the iodine air filters at the nuclear power plant.

40|$|For the {{successful}} {{performance of a}} <b>granular</b> <b>filter</b> medium, existing design guidelines, {{which are based on}} the particle size distribution (PSD) characteristics of the base soil and filter medium, require two contradictory conditions to be satisfied, viz., soil retention and permeability. In spite of the wider applicability of these guidelines, it is well recognized that (i) they are applicable to a particular range of soils tested in the laboratory, (ii) the design procedures do not include performance-based selection criteria, and (iii) there are no means to establish the sensitivity of the important variables influencing performance. In the present work, analytical solutions are developed to obtain a factor of safety with respect to soil-retention and permeability criteria for a base soil - filter medium system subjected to a soil boiling condition. The proposed analytical solutions take into consideration relevant geotechnical properties such as void ratio, permeability, dry unit weight, effective friction angle, shape and size of soil particles, seepage discharge, and existing hydraulic gradient. The solution is validated through example applications and experimental results, and it is established that it can be used successfully in the selection as well as design of granular filters and can be applied to all types of base soils...|$|E
40|$|Experiments were {{conducted}} to study {{the effectiveness of a}} geotextile separator for minimizing the intrusion of a compacted clayey till into a layer of coarse stone under applied pressures. For comparison purposes, intrusion was also studied for the case of a graded granular filter~separator {{and in the absence of}} a filter~separator between the soil and the stone. Both the selected geotextile and graded <b>granular</b> <b>filter</b> efficiently minimized intrusion of the soil mass into the stone void space, and the actual quantity of fines which passed through the geotextile or granular filter~separator was insignificant with respect o the void space in the stone. It is considered that most of the fines passed through the geotextile due to compaction during installation of the clayey soil in the test cell and not due to the applied pressures. In the absence of a filter-separator, a significant amount of clay soil intruded into the voids of the stone layer. The results of this study suggested that both the geotextile and graded granular filter/separa-for could be successfully used in practice, however the geotextile occupies substantially less air space and is likely to be easier to construct and more cost effective.

40|$|There was loss {{of water}} at Oje-Owode dam {{embankment}} through seepage. Evidence of some degrees of fracturing and seepage at the dam toe been reported. Previous {{results showed that the}} dam embankment was permeable and anomalous seepage occurred at the toe. This study, therefore attempted the application of locally sourced <b>granular</b> <b>filters,</b> precisely, stone dust from quarry, to model the control of seepage and piping at the toe of the dam embankment. Coarse soil samples were collected from quarry site as selected <b>granular</b> <b>filters.</b> Granite stones of sizes - inch were selected as the drain samples. These were subjected to particle size analysis, compaction tests, specific gravity; and constant head permeability test. Numerical analyses were also carried out to generate flow lines, seepage rates and velocity vectors of the dam. The results of the simulated flow net showed a seepage value of 3. 8066 x 10 - 8 m 3 /s per width, while total seepage at maximum phreatic level and at full length (896 m) of dam axis was 3. 4107 x 10 - 5 m 3 /s. This indicated loss of water from dam toe through seepage. The velocity vector contours showed flow directions and maximum velocity magnitude of 3. 6 x 10 - 8 m/s in the direction of decreasing heads. The modelled filter-drain installed at dam toe controlled the anomalous seepage water and prevented piping {{as though it were a}} horizontal drain. The flow lines were controlled at coordinate points (36. 25 m, 0. 56 m) and remained horizontal through the filter media, until it exited the dam at th...|$|R
40|$|The {{thesis is}} an outline study for {{reconstruction}} of Mrzlek, the existent drinking water treatment plant. It {{is based on}} the outline scheme. The thesis begins with the presentation of the existent water treatment plant, the water source, and the analysis of the quality of raw and treated water. In continuation, I present a theoretical background to individual water treatment technologies, as well as the designing of the works of these technologies. I discuss sedimentation, coagulation and flocculation, oxidation with ozone, filtration through rapid <b>granular</b> <b>filters,</b> adsorption with active carbon, ultrafiltration, disinfection with chlorine and UV radiation. Each technology is looked at in terms of water treatment method and in terms of its advantages and disadvantages. Finally, the individual technologies are put together into several technological lines of water treatment. These lines are then compared from different technical aspects and evaluated financially. In this way the technological line with the best results has been chosen and proposed to the investor...|$|R
40|$|Traditionally <b>granular</b> <b>filters</b> were used. In {{the last}} decades they have been {{progressively}} replaced by geotex-tile filters. For their design there are several methods available in the literature, however, {{as many of them}} re-sult from the experience with implementation of geotextile filters under specific conditions, their application should be done with care. A numerical tool was developed to assist in the designing of filters, for both granu-lar and geotextile solutions. This tool includes a list of methods useful for the designer of a filter, and thus, was developed to give the user information about the validity of the conditions for applying the methods in question. It includes a comparison and summary of the design results obtained from different methods, allow-ing their comparison. The numerical tool has been tested and validated using examples from literature and is working well and can be a good aid for the project of filters, therefore, a valid approach to save time and ad-ditional expenses...|$|R
