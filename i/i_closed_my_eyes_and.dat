D'Or described an experience that he had singing at the festival as follows: [...] "I had a concert in the Canary Islands...in the WOMAD Festival in front of something like 20,000 people, and then I saw {{just in front of}} me, a group of Palestinian young people with a huge Palestinian flag. And at the beginning I was very tense because I didn't know what their intentions were. <b>I</b> <b>closed</b> <b>my</b> <b>eyes</b> <b>and</b> said 'Look, you speak always about the power of music and how music can get people close to each other', and I was like aiming to their heart, and I'm singing especially for them, and then when I opened my eyes and I saw those people dancing with the Palestinian flag and singing with me together, and it was for me like an amazing sight, because this is something that I don't think ever happened before. I don't know why this world...is choosing...always...war and hate, because things are much easier to solve if you just want to solve them, that's what I feel. And maybe it's naïve, but this is my belief." ...|$|E

Starting, I called upon her name; but none replied. Fleeing from the islet, I gained the {{neighboring}} shore, and searched among the woods; and my comrades meeting, besought their aid. But idle all. No glimpse of aught, save trees and flowers. Then Media was sought out; the event made known; and quickly, bands were summoned to range the isle.|$|E

60|$|And I {{awoke to}} the old pain of the jacket in solitary. About me were the {{customary}} four: Warden Atherton, Captain Jamie, Doctor Jackson, and Al Hutchins. I cracked my face with my willed smile, and struggled not to lose control under the exquisite torment of returning circulation. I drank the water they held to me, waved aside the proffered bread, and refused to speak. <b>I</b> <b>closed</b> <b>my</b> <b>eyes</b> <b>and</b> strove to win back to the chain- locked wagon-circle at Nephi.

60|$|My {{method of}} {{mechanical}} hypnosis was {{the soul of}} simplicity. Sitting with folded legs on my straw-mattress, I gazed fixedly at a fragment of bright straw which I had attached {{to the wall of}} my cell near the door where the most light was. I gazed at the bright point, with my eyes close to it, and tilted upward till they strained to see. At the same time I relaxed all the will of me and gave myself to the swaying dizziness that always eventually came to me. And when I felt myself sway out of balance backward, <b>I</b> <b>closed</b> <b>my</b> <b>eyes</b> <b>and</b> permitted myself to fall supine and unconscious on the mattress.|$|E

I tried to lift my left hand, but could not, and looking down saw that the arm was bandaged like {{to that of a}} mummy, which made me think again that I must be dead, if the dead could suffer so much pain. <b>I</b> <b>closed</b> <b>my</b> <b>eyes</b> <b>and</b> thought or slept a while.|$|E

60|$|He {{began to}} rave. Then I half swooned, and when sight and hearing fully {{returned}} I {{was lying in}} the cave on my blankets. A great lassitude weighted me down. The terrible thrashing about in the icy water had quenched my spirit. For a while I was too played out to move, and lay there in my wet clothes. Finally I asked leave to take them off. Bud, who had {{come back in the}} meantime, helped me, or I should never have got out of them. Herky brought up my coat, which, fortunately, I had taken off before the ducking.

60|$|If {{that was}} not the old Sally Langdon I did not know who it was. Miss Sampson tried to appear offended, and Steele tried to look insulted, but they both failed. They could not have looked {{anything}} but happy. Youth and love were too strong for this couple, whom circumstances might well have made grave and thoughtful. They were magnet and steel, powder and spark. Any moment, right before my eyes, I expected them to rush right into each other's arms. And when they refrained, merely substituting clasped hands for a dearer embrace, <b>I</b> <b>closed</b> <b>my</b> <b>eyes</b> <b>and</b> remembered them, as they would live in my memory forever, standing crushed together on the ridge that day, white lips to white lips, embodying all that was beautiful, passionate and tragic.|$|E
60|$|Monsieur, I {{assure you}} that at that moment my heart {{absolutely}} stood still. The tempter stood at my elbow and whispered, and I deliberately smothered the call of my conscience.

For a second or two <b>I</b> <b>closed</b> <b>my</b> <b>eyes</b> <b>and</b> deliberately conjured up the vision of Mme. la Marquise fainting for lack of food, and of M. le Vicomte dying for want of sustenance; then I worked my way {{to the door of the}} shop and accosted the burly proprietor with as much boldness as I could muster.|$|E

Then I heard a snort of sudden awakening and alarm, and a cry, and I looked out. The Indian was hacking at Borg with a knife, and Borg was warding off with his arms and trying to grapple him. When they did grapple, Bella crept up from behind and threw her arm in a strangle-hold about her husband's neck. She put her knee into the small of his back, and bent him backward and, with the Indian helping, threw him to the floor." ...|$|E

Sometimes {{it seemed as though}} I could have touched them by stretching out my hand; but when I tried, my fingers closed upon thin air. What were they? Why had they come to torment me? Was it because they scented an evil deed? Would they haunt me for ever like this? What folly!

Then on a sudden, as I lay there dozing, a slight noise attracted my attention. I {{opened my eyes and}} stared out silently. The door of my bedroom was pushed gently open. A hand held it gingerly ajar for a while. A brown head was thrust in at the slit, and then another. [...] "Softly!" [...] a voice murmured low in Hawaiian. I lay still, and never moved a thread or muscle of my face, but gazing across dimly through my closed eyelids I could see that one of the men was Kalaua; the other, I imagined, was a perfect stranger. My heart beat fast. Strange thoughts thronged me. [...] "Surely," [...] I said to myself, [...] "this must be Maloka." ...|$|E
