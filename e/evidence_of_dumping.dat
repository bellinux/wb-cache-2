50|$|Given {{that there}} are {{concerns}} in Indonesia {{on the impact of}} EU's environmental regulations there is a strong dialogue on the issue. An anti-dumping investigation was initiated in August 2012 as there was <b>evidence</b> <b>of</b> <b>dumping</b> by companies from both Indonesia and Argentina of biodiesel on the EU market. Provisional measures were imposed in May 2013. As of 27 November 2013 the EU will impose definitive anti-dumping duties on imports of biodiesel from Indonesia.|$|E
40|$|Throughout {{its current}} range, the Cross Timbers forest {{ecosystem}} {{is vulnerable to}} land-use change. In this study, we examined the surrounding land use matrix on the vegetation structure, composition and regeneration of six Cross Timbers forest fragments in Denton County, Texas (north of the Dallas-Fort Worth metroplex). Two fragments adjacent to agricultural land, two to residential neighborhoods, and two formally protected forest sites were selected. In summer 2015, five 100 m 2 plots were randomly established in each fragment at least 200 meters from the edge. In each plot, all live and dead trees ≥ 3 cm diameter were identified and their height and diameter at breast height (DBH at 1. 3 m aboveground) measured. <b>Evidence</b> <b>of</b> <b>dumping</b> (presence of trash) was recorded as an index of human frequentation. Differences in vegetation structure among the forest fragments were found. Most notably, fragments adjacent to agriculture contained 25 % to 50 % fewer trees per hectare than all other sites (Kruskal-Wallis, p < 0. 02), especially trees < 10 cm DBH. However, residential fragments had fewer trees that were ≥ 15 cm DBH {{compared to the other}} fragments, indicating that these are the youngest of the forest patches surveyed. Trash was observed in 60 % of plots surveyed at residential forest sites, showing high levels of human frequentation compared to the protected and agricultural forest sites. Agricultural sites contained the lowest number of recorded tree species and were most similar to each other, sharing 91 % of species. These findings indicate that surrounding land use affects forest structure and composition, consequently affecting valuable ecosystem services including wildlife habitat, aesthetics and recreation...|$|E
40|$|In this paper, I {{test the}} theory that weak {{economic}} conditions in a foreign economy cause cyclical dumping, i. e., the temporary sale of products in a trading partner's economy at a price below average total cost. Although I am unable to observe prices or costs directly, a novel identification strategy allows me to uncover <b>evidence</b> <b>of</b> cyclical <b>dumping.</b> Using country- specific information on foreign economic shocks in manufacturing industries, filing decisions by the US industry, and antidumping decisions by the US government, I am able to identify strong <b>evidence</b> <b>of</b> cyclical <b>dumping.</b> After controlling for other factors that likely drive industry filing and government decisions, I find that a one standard deviation fall {{in the growth of}} employment in a foreign economy's manufacturing industry quadruples the joint probability that the US industry will file an antidumping petition and the US government will impose a preliminary (temporary) antidumping measure. Further, a one standard deviation fall in foreign employment growth more than doubles the joint probability that a petition will be filed and a final (long-lasting) antidumping measure will be imposed. Antidumping duties...|$|R

50|$|According to many {{different}} sources, there is <b>evidence</b> <b>of</b> large-scale <b>dumping</b> <b>of</b> toxic waste {{on the remote}} island of Annobon, at least during the 1980s and 1990s. The German edition of Der Spiegel on 28 August 2006 reported {{that the government of}} Equatorial Guinea sold permits to UK and US companies to bury 10 million metric tons of toxic waste and 7 million metric tons of radioactive waste on the island of Annobón. Teodoro Obiang Nguema Mbasogo, president of Equatorial Guinea, supposedly receives 200 million US dollars per year for renewed permits, while the population of Annobón lives in extreme poverty. The report also showed evidence that the whole island's ecosystem is about to collapse due to the massive waste dumping.|$|R
50|$|Plans for Site 41 were {{established}} {{to provide the}} four north Simcoe County with municipalities of Midland, Penetanguishene, Tiny and Tay with a local waste disposal site. These municipalities, along with Port McNicoll and Victoria Harbour, had been using a site known as the Pauze landfill since 1966. Hydrogeological surveys of the Pauze landfill in 1982 and 1983 revealed a leachate plume migrating towards Nottawasaga Bay, and <b>evidence</b> <b>of</b> the illegal <b>dumping</b> <b>of</b> liquid industrial waste. Consequently, the landfill was closed in October 1987, and a new water system {{would have to be}} constructed for the impacted residents of Perkinsfield.|$|R
40|$|Background: Although early dumping {{syndrome}} {{is a well-known}} complication after Roux-en-Y Gastric Bypass (RYGB), data on the long-term prevalence are limited and inconclusive. This study aims to describe the prevalence <b>of</b> early <b>dumping</b> syndrome in patients 3 to 6 years after primary RYGB, using 3 different criteria. Methods: In this cross-sectional study a total of 140 patients after RYGB were randomly selected and approached. Of these, 51 patients {{agreed to participate in}} a Mixed-Meal Tolerance Test using a liquid nutrition supplement (Ensure Plus 200 ml). The results of the first 28 are presented here. Heart Rate (HR) and Haematocrit (Ht) were measured at baseline and 10, 20, 30 and 60 minutes after the test meal. Symptoms scores were measured at baseline, 30 and 60 minutes. Early dumping was defined as a HR-increase of > 10 beats per minute, a Ht-increase of > 3 %, and/or ≥ 2 gastrointestinal symptoms and ≥ 1 vegetative symptom on a symptom score. A confidence interval (CI) was calculated using the Clopper-Pearson method. Results: Prevalence <b>of</b> early <b>dumping</b> was 89 % (n= 25) according to HR (95 % CI [0. 72; 0. 98]); 32 % (n= 9) according to Ht (95 % CI [0. 16; 0. 52]) and 7 % (n= 2) recorded symptom score (95 % CI [0. 01; 0. 24]). In the vast majority the objective changes indicative <b>of</b> early <b>dumping</b> occurred within 10 minutes postprandially. Symptoms were reported within 30 minutes postprandially. Conclusions: The interim results show a large discrepancy of the prevalence <b>of</b> early <b>dumping</b> between the different criteria. Hemodynamic <b>evidence</b> <b>of</b> early <b>dumping</b> is only in a few cases accompanied by complaints...|$|R
40|$|Since the mid- 1990 s, a {{fleet of}} up to 50 vessels have been {{conducting}} a gillnet fishery on the continental slopes to the West of the British Isles, North of Shetland, at Rockall and Hatton bank. These vessels, though mostly based in Spain are registered in the UK, Germany and other countries outside the EU such as Panama. The fishery is conducted in depths between 200 and 1200 meters, with the main target species being monkfish (200 - 800 m) and deepwater sharks (800 - 1200 m). These fisheries are not well documented or understood {{and they seem to}} be largely unregulated, with little or no information on landings, catch composition and discards. Vessels currently participating in the fishery are reported to use up to 250 km of gear, and the nets are left fishing unattended and hauled every 3 - 10 days with trip lengths varying between 4 – 8 weeks. The amount of fishing gear used in the fisheries, the lengths of the fleets, {{and the fact that the}} nets are unattended much of the time, make it very likely that a large quantity of nets are lost, while there is also <b>evidence</b> <b>of</b> illegal <b>dumping</b> <b>of</b> sheet netting. The long soak times in these fisheries result in a high proportion of the catches being unfit for human consumption. Keywords: Deepwater Shark Fisheries, Ghostfishing...|$|R
30|$|The slope {{geometry}} and the geo-mechanical strength <b>of</b> <b>dump</b> materials mostly control the stability <b>of</b> the <b>dump</b> [7, 19, 42]. Das [18] and McCurthy and David [41] asserted various factors responsible for failure <b>of</b> <b>dump</b> slopes such as geology and hydrogeology <b>of</b> the <b>dumping</b> area, gravitational force, seepage <b>of</b> water from <b>dump</b> to slope, lowering of water {{adjacent to a}} slope, changes of stress and erosion <b>of</b> <b>dump</b> (removal <b>of</b> lateral support) caused by flowing water. Other factors such as dump slope angle (slope inclination), natures <b>of</b> the <b>dump</b> materials (material properties), degree <b>of</b> compaction, <b>dump</b> height and changes in cohesion of interface materials have also been pointed by other workers [34, 48, 57].|$|R

50|$|It {{has been}} {{proposed}} that archaeological <b>evidence</b> <b>of</b> New Fire ceremonies {{can be found in}} the shape <b>of</b> <b>dumps</b> <b>of</b> pottery and households utensils discarded in the initial stage of the celebration. The idea was first proposed by George C. Vaillant in the 1930s but his model was criticized as theoretically unfounded and abandoned. In 2001 Elson and Smith rethought the proposal in light of the findings <b>of</b> several ceramic <b>dumps</b> that seemed to match the idea of what remains of New Fire ceremony would look like. They conclude that New Fire ceremonies were held throughout the Aztec sphere of influence and had a distinct importance at both the local level of each household and in the larger political level of the state religion.|$|R
