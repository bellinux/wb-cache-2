50|$|While debate exists among neurologists {{as to the}} {{specific}} number of senses due to differing definitions {{of what constitutes a}} sense, Gautama Buddha and Aristotle classified five ‘traditional’ human senses which have become universally accepted: touch, taste, smell, sight, and hearing. Other senses that have been well-accepted in most mammals, including humans, include nociception, equilibrioception, <b>kinaesthesia,</b> and thermoception. Furthermore, some nonhuman animals have been shown to possess alternate senses, including magnetoception and electroreception.|$|E

Later, in 1880, Henry Charlton Bastian suggested [...] "kinaesthesia" [...] instead of [...] "muscle sense" [...] on the basis that some of the afferent information (back to the brain) comes from other structures, including tendons, joints, and skin.

5000|$|The {{philosophy}} of the lawine torrèn's mastermind is that choreography cannot be constricted; moreover, {{it is all about}} the feeling of how movement is perceived, every movement. It was due to our sense for <b>kinaesthesia</b> and our ability for being empathetic that we fully understood our teddy bears - today, we admire the elegance of a crane. The increased upright - the genuine axis of the wish for elevation in dance - forms the basis for [...] "artful elevation". Conducted by humans, cars, diggers, cranes, aeroplanes, snow cats, ships, whichever vehicles, become the electric amplifier of a dance that erupts like rock 'n' roll from the stifling air of the theatre, its space self-referential and formatted too tightly. Drama is understood as an evolutionary creature; art works on the basis of memetic processes: copy, variation and selection form the algorithm of the system called art, which unremittingly saves beauty anew, without signification and orientation. Lawine torrèn sees itself as an attention-industrial formation that functions as a catalyst in and of global economy, steering processes instead of destructing them.|$|E

40|$|This {{review of}} <b>kinaesthesia,</b> the senses of limb {{position}} and limb movement, has been prompted by recent new {{observations on the}} role of motor commands in position sense. They make it necessary to reassess the present-day views of the underlying neural mechanisms. Peripheral receptors which contribute to <b>kinaesthesia</b> are muscle spindles and skin stretch receptors. Joint receptors do not appear {{to play a major role}} at most joints. The evidence supports the existence of two separate senses, the sense of limb position and the sense of limb movement. Receptors such as muscle spindle primary endings are able to contribute to both senses. While limb position and movement can be signalled by both skin and muscle receptors, new evidence has shown that if limb muscles are contracting, an additional cue is provided by centrally generated motor command signals. Observations using neuroimaging techniques indicate the involvement of both the cerebellum and parietal cortex in a multi-sensory comparison, involving operation of a forward model between the feedback during a movement and its expected profile, based on past experience. Involvement of motor command signals in <b>kinaesthesia</b> has implications for interpretations of certain clinical conditions...|$|E

Eleven young healthy subjects completed a series of highly intensive damaging exercises for their hamstring muscles. Prior to the exercise, and during the 5 -day recovery period, the subjects were tested for biochemical markers (creatine kinase, aspartate aminotransferase, and lactate dehydrogenase), perceived pain sensation, physical performance (squat jump, counter movement jump, maximal frequency leg stamping, maximal isometric torque production and maximally explosive isometric torque production), <b>kinaesthesia</b> (active torque tracking) and static balance. We observed significant decreases in maximal isometric knee flexion torque production, the rate of torque production, and majority of the parameters for vertical jump performance. No alterations were found in <b>kinaesthesia,</b> static balance and fast stepping on spot. The highest drop in performance and increase in perceived pain sensation generally occurred 24 or 48 hours after the exercise. Damaging exercise substantially alters the neuromuscular functions of the hamstring muscles, which is specifically relevant for sports and rehabilitation experts, as the hamstrings are often stretched to significant lengths, in particular when the knee is extended and hip flexed. These findings are practically important for recovery after high-intensity trainings for hamstring muscle...|$|E

An AC induction motor was used to apply movement to the models of the thumb carpometacarpal joint, little finger metacarpophalangeal joint and index finger metacarpophalangeal joint for investigating median, ulnar and mixed nerve (ulnar and median) innervation, respectively.;Thumb: High kinaesthetic acuity was present in the thumb following local anaesthesia of the median nerve. Median and radial nerve anaesthesia demonstrated that much of this remaining sensation {{was due to the}} contribution of the radial nerve. <b>Kinaesthesia</b> in median PNI subjects was characterised by high movement detection but inconsistent grading of movement.;Little Finger: Ulnar nerve anaesthesia resulted in profound kinaesthetic loss. Some subjects could detect at least some movements but could not grade amplitudes and velocities, sometimes sensing movements in the extension, flexion plane. Subsequent to ulnar PNI, kinaesthetic sensation varied from no sensation to kinaesthetic acuity approaching normal levels. Of the three models, the little finger provided the most complete model for assessing kinaesthetic recovery.;Index: Both ulnar and median nerve anaesthesia had a small but detrimental effect on the ability to sense movement in the index indicating that muscle and skin/joint proprioceptors both contribute to <b>kinaesthesia.</b> Median and ulnar nerve anaesthesia had opposite effects on the ability to grade movements, causing underestimation and overestimation of amplitudes, respectively. Median PNI resulted in variability and in the ability to grade movement, whereas ulnar PNI resulted in consistent exaggeration of amplitude.;The three intrinsic muscles, abductor pollicis brevis, first dorsal interosseus and abductor digiti minimi all generated 8 - 10 Hz tremor, both in the normal hand, and subsequent to PNI and carpal tunnel syndrome (CTS).

40|$|Background: Parkinson’s {{disease is}} {{accompanied}} by deficits in passive motion and limb position sense. Objective: To investigate whether deep brain stimulation of the subthalamic nucleus (STN-DBS) reverses these proprio-ceptive deficits. Methods and results: A passive movement task was applied to nine patients with Parkinson’s disease and bilateral chronic STN-DBS and to seven controls. Thresholds for 75 % correct responses were 0. 9 ˚ for controls, 2. 5 ˚ for Parkinson’s disease patients when stimulation was OFF, and 2. 0 ˚ when stimulation was ON. Conclusions: STN-DBS improves kinaesthesic deficits in Parkinson’s disease, but {{does not lead to}} a full recovery of proprioceptive function. K inaesthesia is the conscious perception of limb and body position, orientation, and motion. Recent studies have shown that patients with Parkinson’s disease have higher thresholds for detecting passive elbow movements, reflecting kinaesthesic deficits. 1 2 Patients with Parkinson’s disease show altered proprioception related EEG potentials during passive movements, which probably reflect changes in the cortical processing of kinaesthesic signals. 3 Dopaminergic drugs appear to enhance this deficit. 4 In contrast, we found no effect of levodopa on <b>kinaesthesia.</b> 2 Deep brain stimulation of the subthalamic nucleus (STN-DBS) improves motor deficits in Parkinson’s disease 5 but it may worsen cognitive functions such as working memory. 6 However, the effects of STN-DBS on <b>kinaesthesia</b> are unknown.

40|$|Deep brain {{stimulation}} (DBS) is {{an excellent}} treatment for tremor and is generally thought to be reversible by turning off stimulation. For tremor, DBS is implanted in the ventrointermedius (Vim) nucleus of the thalamus, a region that relays proprioceptive information for movement sensation (<b>kinaesthesia).</b> Gait disturbances have been observed with bilateral Vim DBS, but the long-term effects on proprioceptive processing are unknown. We aimed to determine whether Vim DBS surgical implantation or stimulation leads to proprioceptive deficits in the upper limb. We assessed two groups of tremor subjects on measures of proprioception (<b>kinaesthesia,</b> position sense) and motor function using a robotic exoskeleton. In the first group (Surgery), we tested patients before and after implantation of Vim DBS, but before DBS was turned on to determine if proprioceptive deficits were inherent to tremor or caused by DBS implantation. In the second group (Stim), we tested subjects with chronically implanted Vim DBS ON and OFF stimulation. Compared to controls, there were no proprioceptive deficits before or after DBS implantation in the Surgery group. Surprisingly, those that received chronic long-term stimulation (LT-stim, 3 - 10 years) displayed significant proprioceptive deficits ON and OFF stimulation not present in subjects with chronic short-term stimulation (ST-stim, 0. 5 - 2 years). LT-stim had significantly larger variability and reduced workspace area during the position sense assessment.

How this is possible is the main problem addressed in the work. Unlike previous literature (Ricœur, Merleau-Ponty and Derrida) all the resources of genetic phenomenology are employed. The central argument is that the lebendige Gegenwart as the core of Husserl’s theory of passivity consists of preliminary forms of <b>kinaesthesia,</b> feelings and drives in a constant process where repression occurs as {{a necessary part of}} all constitution. The clarification of repression thus consists in show-ing how it presupposes a broad conception of consciousness such as that presented by Husserl.

40|$|The article {{examines}} the practice known as ‘rooftopping photography’ and its significance for the representation of vertical cities. It begins by charting {{the historical development of}} architecture as a viewing platform {{in the age of the}} camera, and dwells on the imagery of cityscapes from above that emerged in the inter-war period. Against this background, the essay investigates how rooftopping arose out of the urban exploration movement and became a global trend in the early 2010 s. This phenomenon is situated within its wider social and cultural context, and is discussed with reference to the online media discourse that contributed to its public visibility. A set of ideas from the philosophy of photography and visual culture inform the critical analysis of rooftopping photographs: this broad and diverse body of images is examined with a focus on two predominant modes of representation—panoramic and plunging views. The affective responses elicited by so-called ‘vertigo-inducing’ images are discussed through the concept of vicarious <b>kinaesthesia,</b> which offers insights into the nexus between visceral experience and visual representation that lies at the core of rooftopping. By unpacking this interplay, the essay explores a phenomenon that has hitherto been given little scholarly attention and reflects on its broader implications for the relationship between photography and architecture today...|$|E

DESIGN: Systematic literature review. METHODS: PubMed and Web of Science databases were used to select studies of {{the presence of}} cervical motor dysfunctions within the acute stage (<[*] 6 weeks) after whiplash trauma and/or their predictive value for the development of chronic whiplash-associated disorders. RESULTS: The presence of cervical motor dysfunctions in the acute stage after whiplash trauma was investigated in 4 cohorts. The course of cervical motor dysfunctions in whiplash-associated disorders was examined in 4 cohorts, and the predictive value on outcome 1 year post-whiplash trauma was assessed in 3 cohorts. Reduced cervical mobility, disturbed <b>kinaesthesia,</b> and altered muscle activity were found in the acute stage, and these persisted over time in the moderate/severe group. The predictive value of examining the presence of cervical motor dysfunctions was doubtful. The course and predictive value of initial reduced cervical mobility was inconsistent. CONCLUSION: Cervical motor dysfunctions are present soon after whiplash trauma persisting in those with moderate/severe symptoms. However, these dysfunctions have limited predictive value, and hence may not explain the complex clinical picture of whiplash-associated disorders.

40|$|After {{a period}} of {{eccentric}} exercise of elbow flexor muscles of one arm in young, adult human subjects, muscles became fatigued and damaged. Damage indicators were a fall in force, change in resting elbow angle and delayed onset of soreness. After the exercise, {{subjects were asked to}} match the forearm angle of one arm, whose position was set by the experimenter, with their other arm. Subjects matched the position of the unsupported reference arm, when this was unexercised, with a significantly more flexed position in their exercised indicator arm. Errors were in the opposite direction when the reference arm was exercised. The size of the errors correlated with the drop in force. Less consistent errors were observed when the reference arm was supported. A similar pattern of errors was seen after concentric exercise, which does not produce muscle damage. The data suggested that subjects were using as a position cue the perceived effort required to maintain a given forearm angle against the force of gravity. The fall in force from fatigue after exercise meant more effort was required to maintain a given position. That led to matching errors between the exercised and unexercised arms. It was concluded that while a role for muscle spindles in <b>kinaesthesia</b> cannot be excluded, detailed information about static limb position can be derived from the effort required to support the limb against the force of gravity...|$|E
40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to {{investigate}} the cervicocephalic <b>kinaesthesia</b> of healthy subjects for gender and age effects and its reliability in a new virtual reality test procedure. 57 healthy subjects (30 male, 27 females; 18 - 64 years) were immersed into a virtual 3 D scene via a headmounted display, which generated specific head movements. The joint repositioning error was determined in a static and dynamic test at the times T 0, T 1 (T 0 + 10 minutes) and T 2 (T 0 + 24 hours). The intrasession reliability (T 0 -T 1) and the intersession reliability (T 0 -T 2) were analysed. In both tests no gender- or age-specific effects were found. In the overall group the means of the static test were 6. 2 - 6. 9 and of the dynamic test were 4. 5 - 4. 9. The intratest difference in the static test was - 0. 16 and the intertest difference was 0. 47. The intratest difference in the dynamic test was 0. 42 and the intertest difference was 0. 37. The static and dynamic test was reproducible in healthy subjects, with minor deviations, irrespective of gender and age. The smaller interindividual differences in the dynamic test could be beneficial in the comparison of healthy individuals and individuals with cervical spine disorders...|$|E
