40|$|What is the {{background}} of the NLA? The Jamaican government established the National Land Agency in 2001 as part of its ongoing public sector modernization programme, aimed at improving the services available to farmers and other landowners. The NLA effectively brings together the activities and services of four previously separate government departments: land titles, surveys and mapping, land valuation and estate management. The merger of these departments provided the authorities with an opportunity to consolidate their multiple databases and document management systems into a single, coherent system. This resulted in the implementation of an automated Land Registration and Parcel Data Management System (LRS/PDMS), which has transformed the previous largely manual national land titling procedures, and [URL] eLandjamaica, a web-based property search service. What land valuation services are available from eLandjamaica? One of eLandjamaica´s main advantages is that it gives online access to the NLA´s valuation roll, which serves as the official inventory of all properties in Jamaica and is used as the basis for land tax assessment. The valuation roll includes a physical description of each property, its address, the name or names of its owner or tenant, its net annual rental value and total market value in <b>Jamaican</b> <b>dollars.</b> The value of a piece of land depends on, among other things, its use (residential, agricultural, commercial, etc.) and the economic climate. Jamaican law requires that property is revalued ´as near as may be every five years´ in order to reflect current rental or sale price levels, and to adjust property tax levels accordingly. The most recent revaluation exercise was completed in 2002, and the resulting 680, 000 valuation roll reports may be accessed through eLandjamaica. How can this information help farmers? Through eLandjamaica, farmers can now inspect the valuation roll and assess whether they are entitled to tax relief. In an effort to support the country´s farming sector, the government offers ´agricultural derating´ grants to landowners who use a substantial proportion of their land for agricultural production. These grants constitute a 50 % property tax exemption. For farmers who live in remote areas of the island, having online access to such information can save much valuable time. They no longer need to visit the NLA head offices in Kingston but can connect to the Internet from their own homes or a local NLA office. How is eLandjamaica benefiting the tax authorities? The government relies heavily on property tax revenues to fund important services such as education and health care, and is therefore working to improve the efficiency and transparency of the tax system. In particular, it is hoped that by making official, undisputed records of land values more widely available this will discourage land speculation and fraud. eLandjamaica offers a single point of entry, enabling NLA officers can quickly share land valuation and other land-related data with other government agencies and private-sector organizations. As a result, they can create a more consistent picture of the relations between land use in a particular area and its tax burden, and so may more easily adjust property tax policies to support the local economy. The launch of eLandjamaica has transformed the work of many local authorities. The staff no longer spend their time helping people search through valuation rolls, or creating and maintaining paper archives. Through eLandjamaica the public can now access directly a wealth of information online. Website user statistics show that the numbers of requests for certificates of title and other land-related documentation have risen steadily. This is also partly thanks to NLA´s successful efforts to reduce transaction times. The NLA´s improvements in service delivery are making a significant contribution to the government´s overall goal of strengthening the island´s real estate and land markets. mailto:adrienne. mullings@nla. gov. jm Adrienne Mullings serves as NLA PR officer. For additional information on eLandjamaica and other NLA services, visit [URL] www. nla. gov. jm. Knowing the exact value of a piece of land is essential both for local governments, to enable them to levy appropriate taxes, and for farmers to calculate their annual budgets.

40|$|Since 1996, the Bank of Jamaica (BoJ) {{has sought}} to limit changes in the {{exchange}} rate for the <b>Jamaican</b> <b>dollar</b> {{in the context of}} its efforts to maintain low inflation. However, with a persistently high public sector deficit, real interest rates have remained generally high, which partly explains the slow pace of growth. This paper discusses an alternative monetary policy mix for achieving low variance for inflation and output through the prism of an empirical macroeconomic model. The simulation results suggest that a monetary policy mix that takes into account the impact of policy on both inflation and output achieves lower variance for inflation and output compared with the current policy mix, which tilts somewhat toward exchange rate stabilization. A case, therefore, can be made for the BoJ to move to a soft inflation targeting regime supported by fiscal consolidation. ...|$|E
40|$|The authors {{examine how}} the food stamp program {{affected}} measures of poverty during devaluation of the <b>Jamaican</b> <b>dollar</b> in the early 1990 s. They find that without the food stamp program, the poverty gap in Jamaica {{would have been much}} worse, especially in 1990 and 1991. For the country as a whole, not having a food stamp program wouldn't have affected the incidence of poverty significantly, but particular groups among the poor would have fared worse. Households with elderly residents benefited most from the program. Households with young children benefited more than households without, in terms of the poverty headcount and gap. The program also appears to have had more effect on extremely poor households than on those of the transient poor (people who move in and out of poverty). Explicitly incorporating behavioral responses into the model reduces the contribution of food stamps to household consumption and poverty, but the poorest benefited most from the program even after accounting for behavioral responses. The program contributed more to reducing poverty than to smoothing consumption.

40|$|We {{are more}} than a little bit {{surprised}} at the seeming reticence of the central bank's governor, Mr Derrick Latibeaudiere, {{to the idea of a}} monetary policy committee, being proposed by the private sector. The suggestion forms part of the package of proposals of the so-called Partners for Progress group, who have been seeking a framework for sustained growth in the Jamaican economy. This group has not only been talking. They have been prepared to back the strength of their convictions with substantial action. Indeed, they have been attempting to convince domestic financial institutions to convert high-cost <b>Jamaican</b> <b>dollar</b> loans to other forms of debt instruments that would ease the short-term interest burden and provide an opportunity for the Government to begin to seriously address the public sector deficit. Reasonably, those who are putting together this programme want to be assured that the administration establishes the environment in which concessions made by the private sector translate into real macro- economic value. One way to help ensure this is through transparency in policy formulation. A monetary policy committee is but one instrument, so far as the partners are concerned, to add value to the idea. Mr Latibeaudiere's reservation, it seems, rests on his argument that such committees usually operate in the context of independent central banks, which are removed from direct political control and which have control over monetary policy formulation. Perhaps! Indeed, this newspaper supports the idea of an independent central bank, whose principal officers are removed from the whim of political control and have the authority, under law, to limit lending to the government. This is an ideal for which we must strive - the sooner the better. However, we do not see an independent central bank and a monetary policy committee in the context of the existing structure of the Bank of Jamaica as mutually exclusive. The truth be told, senior officials who speak of the operation of the BOJ often hail its relative independence and the creative tension which usually exists between the central bank and the finance ministry. In fact, there is a healthy bit of chest-thumping at Nethersole Place. In any event, we would have thought that in the absence of its independence, a monetary policy committee, involving key economic players, would be a development welcomed by the central bank and its top managers. Such a committee would, on the face of it, provide the central bank with some level of insulation from political controllers or politicised and over-reaching bureaucrats at the finance ministry. Indeed, the timely publication of the minutes of the meeting on which the decisions of the committee were made would provide powerful moral authority against a Government that was intent on running roughshod over the wishes of the committee. We, for instance, would like to know the thinking, and technical arguments, behind the decision in the first quarter of last year to push interest rates well beyond 30 per cent to defend the <b>Jamaican</b> <b>dollar.</b> It would be interesting to know what was the stance of the professional central bankers on offering investors such high levels of real return on their money. The fundamental argument is that better decisions are likely to be made in an environment of openness and transparency and on the basis of access to other than a narrow slate of views. Moreover, the kind of committee which is being proposed could well be a fundamental first step to an independent central bank. Central Bank,Jamaica,Jamaica Central bank,Central Bank Jamaica...|$|E
