5000|$|Bilali Mohammed was {{purchased}} by Thomas Spalding and assigned as his <b>head</b> <b>driver</b> at his plantation on Sapelo Island. Bilali could speak Arabic and had knowledge of the Qur'an. [...] "Due to his literacy and leadership qualities, he would be appointed the manager of his master's plantation, overseeing approximately five hundred slaves" [...] (Rebel Music by Hisham D. Aidi). In the War of 1812, Bilali and his fellow Muslims on Sapelo Island helped to defend the United States from a British attack. Upon Bilali's death in 1857, {{it was discovered that}} he had written a thirteen-page Arabic manuscript. At first, this was thought to have been his diary, but closer inspection revealed that the manuscript was a transcription of a Muslim legal treatise and part of West Africa's Muslim curriculum.|$|E
2500|$|The Crow often hunted bison by {{utilizing}} buffalo jumps. [...] "Where Buffaloes are Driven Over Cliffs at Long Ridge" [...] was {{a favorite}} spot for meat procurement by the Crow Indians for over a century, from 1700 to around 1870 when modern weapons were introduced. [...] The Crow used this place annually in the autumn, a place of multiple cliffs along a ridge that eventually sloped to the creek. Early {{in the morning the}} day of the jump a medicine man would stand {{on the edge of the}} upper cliff, facing up the ridge. He would take a pair of bison hindquarters and pointing the feet along the lines of stones he would sing his sacred songs and call upon the Great Spirit to make the operation a success. After this invocation the medicine man would give the two <b>head</b> <b>drivers</b> a pouch of incense. As the two <b>head</b> <b>drivers</b> and their helpers headed up the ridge and the long line of stones they would stop and burn incense on the ground repeating this process four times. The ritual was intended to make the animals come to the line where the incense was burned, then bolt back to the ridge area.|$|R

40|$|A {{simulation}} {{was created}} using LS-DYNA® {{to determine the}} acoustical properties of a golf ball and golf <b>driver</b> <b>head</b> impact. LS-DYNA® has a coupled finite element analysis (FEA) and boundary element method (BEM) solver that uses the integral form of Helmholtz’s acoustic wave equation to deliver predicted sound pressure levels at predetermined acoustic points. Validation of the modeling was done on a simple plate donated by Titleist Golf. The plate was modeled and meshed using TrueGrid and impacted by a three layer golf ball model derived from “Tanka’s” paper on multilayered golf balls. The final converging model consisted of 10, 900 solid fully integrated elements between the ball, plate, and plate support structure. The result was compared to experimental data taken by an air cannon and anechoic chamber that housed strain and acoustical measurement equipment. The sound level predictions from the model showed a promising correlation with experimental data and the focus switched to a golf <b>driver</b> <b>head</b> response during impact. The same ball developed from Tanaka’s paper was used to impact a 350 cc generic golf <b>driver</b> <b>head.</b> The <b>driver</b> <b>head</b> consisted of 3300 fully integrated shell elements throughout the model. The top of the hosel was fixed during the simulation to simulate the connection to the golf shaft. The ball was fired {{at the center of}} the driver’s face and the predicted sound was determined for a point two feet behind the <b>driver</b> <b>head.</b> The BEM prediction of the <b>driver</b> <b>head</b> model showed little correlation with actual recorded impact sounds provided by Cleveland Golf when comparing frequency response functions. These differences could arise from assumptions and simplifications made to speed up the impact simulation. The sound produced from the golf ball after impact was one such factor was not included. Due to the complex shape of the <b>driver</b> <b>head</b> and the total number of elements involved, the numerical solution took upwards of 100 hours to finish. Adding the golf ball sound would greatly increase computational time and not contribute significantly to the overall predicted sound. Although the BEM solution can be used to characterize different <b>driver</b> <b>heads,</b> the impact is too complicated to efficiently and accurately predict the true impact sounds...|$|R
5000|$|After leaving Hydra <b>Head,</b> <b>Driver</b> {{felt that}} [...] "labels were not {{interested}} in what I was doing". He said that the return to the more metal-based sound of early Kayo Dot albums was sparked prior to the making of Gamma Knife because he felt frustrated with [...] "bland, unthoughtful, weak metal coming out and receiving acclaim." [...] The budgets for Stained Glass and Gamma Knife were minuscule, thus limiting the scope in which those projects could be conceived; however, with Hubardo, the group had a set budget that was considerably larger, allowing the band to create an album on a grander scale. Additionally, Driver was able to dedicate his time to writing the album {{due to a lack of}} day job. Due to increased repetition and an aspect of catchiness, guitarist Ron Varod characterized the album as [...] "pop".|$|E

40|$|We {{propose a}} method of {{estimating}} <b>driver's</b> <b>head</b> movement by tracking a pair of nostrils. Nostrils clearly appear {{as a pair of}} dark areas in a facial image. Shape of nostrils have little influence of deformation compared to eyes. We use a concentric circular mask or density difference mask to detect difference of image density. We represent nostril position by a center of gravity of extracted nostril region, and apply moving average to a sequence of the detected nostrils positions. We decide reference positions of nostrils through a procedure that an interval of moving average is fixed into a standard cycle of model <b>driver’s</b> <b>head</b> motion. We estimate <b>driver’s</b> <b>head</b> movement from a difference between detected nostrils position and reference nostrils position. Cycle of <b>driver’s</b> <b>head</b> movement is available for a measure of monitoring driving condition. Experimental results show the effectiveness of our proposed method. 1...|$|R

40|$|As a {{consequence}} of the impact of a small car with a high-containment safety barrier, the <b>driver’s</b> <b>head</b> can break the side window and directly strike the barrier. This potentially fatal occurrence is not considered by the European norms for safety barrier certification. In this paper, a method is introduced to generate the limit surface of the positions occupied by the <b>driver’s</b> <b>head</b> during the impact of a small car with a safety barrier. Simulations of TB 11 tests were performed and the results used to create the envelope of the <b>driver’s</b> <b>head</b> positions outside the car compartment.

40|$|An {{acoustic}} profile {{from the impact}} between a golf ball and <b>driver</b> <b>head</b> was produced using FEA. Following this, the results were analyzed to determine the feasibility of an acoustical optimization of such an impact. A validation of the FEA program LS-DYNA® was undertaken to ensure a proper solution was attained in the software analysis. An experimental and theoretical validation was performed that involved firing a golf ball at a titanium plate and comparing data from the impact to FEA simulations. Once the FEA program was validated, a golf club <b>driver</b> <b>head</b> model was used to generate an acoustical output using LS-DYNA®. By comparing this acoustic output to real <b>driver</b> <b>head</b> sound data, a feasibility of profiling good and bad sound was established. Using the optimization add-on program LS-OPT® a simple shape optimization was performed to maximize {{the speed of the}} ball after the impact. This new geometry of the club head was acoustically analyzed and the results were compared to the non-optimized case and shown to be distinct. The simulation results, however, did not compare well with the real <b>driver</b> <b>head</b> data and more analysis would be needed to improve upon the results. Overall, the project was able to establish an analytical relationship to the acoustics generated and produce a solid foundation for the possibilities of an acoustical optimization...|$|R
