40|$|Keywords:eye detection; driver fatigue; PERCLOS Abstract. One of the {{important}} causes of traffic accidents is driver fatigue. In this paper, a new real-time non-intrusive method to detect driver fatigue is proposed. Firstly, face region is detected by AdaBoost algorithm because of its robustness. Then a region of interest of the eye is defined based on face geometry. In this region, eye pupil is precisely located by radial symmetry transform. With principal component analysis(PCA), three <b>eigen</b> <b>spaces</b> are trained to recognize eye states. Open, closed eye samples and other non-eye samples in the face region are used to get these <b>eigen</b> <b>spaces.</b> At last, PERCLOS and consecutive eye closure time are adopted to detect driver fatigue.

We also propose a novel method to merge kernel <b>eigen</b> <b>spaces</b> (KES) in feature space. Subspace methods {{have traditionally been}} used with the full appearance of the image. Recently local features based bag-of-features (BoF) representation has performed impressively on classification tasks. We use KES with BoF vectors to construct class specific subspaces and use the distance of a query vector from the database KESs as the classification criteria. The use of local features makes our approach invariant to illumination, rotation, scale, small affine transformation and partial occlusions. The system allows hierarchy by merging the KES in the feature space. The classifier performs competitively on the challenging Caltech- 101 dataset under normal and simulated occlusion conditions.

The proposed method is based on finding free-configuration <b>eigen</b> <b>spaces</b> (FCE) in the robot actuation area. Using the FCE technique to find optimal paths for autonomous mobile robots, the underlying hypothesis is that in the low-dimensional manifolds of laser scanning data, there lies an eigenvector which corresponds to the free-configuration space of the higher order geometric representation of the environment. The vectorial combination of all these eigenvectors at discrete time scan frames manifests a trajectory, whose sum can be treated as a robot path or trajectory. The proposed algorithm was tested on two different test bed data, real data obtained from Navlab SLAMMOT and data obtained from the real-time robotics simulation program Player/Stage. Performance analysis of FCE technique was done with existing four path planning algorithms under certain working parameters, namely computation time needed to find a solution, the distance travelled and the amount of turning required by the autonomous mobile robot. This study will enable readers to identify the suitability of path planning algorithm under the working parameters, which needed to be optimized.

40|$|Analysis and {{interpretation}} of DNA Microarray data is a fundamental task in bioinformatics. Feature Extraction plays {{a critical role in}} better performance of the classifier. We address the dimension reduction of DNA features in which relevant features are extracted among thousands of irrelevant ones through dimensionality reduction. This enhances the speed and accuracy of the classifiers. Principal Component Analysis is a technique used for feature extraction which helps to retrieve intrinsic information from high dimensional data in <b>eigen</b> <b>spaces</b> to solve the curse of dimensionality problem. Neural Networks and Support Vector Machine are implemented on reduced data set and their performances are measured in terms of predictive accuracy, specificity, and sensitivity. Next, we propose a Multiobjective Genetic Algorithm-based fuzzy clustering technique using real coded encoding of cluster centers for clustering and classification. This technique is implemented on microarray cancer data to select training data using multiobjective genetic algorithm with non-dominated sorting. The two objective functions for this multiobjective techniques are optimization of cluster compactness as well as separation simultaneously. This approach identifies the solution. Support Vector Machine classifier is further trained by the selected training points which have high confidence value. Then remaining points are classified by trained SVM classifier. Finally, the four clustering label vectors through majority voting ensemble are combined. The performance of the proposed MOGA-SVM, classification and clustering method has been compared to MOGA-BP, SVM, BP. The performance are measured in terms of Silhoutte Index, ARI Index respectively.

40|$|Abstract. A {{general scheme}} to {{represent}} the relation between dynamic images and camera and/or object motions is proposed for applications to visual control of robots. We consider the case where a moving camera observes moving objects in a static scene. The camera obtains images of the objects moving within the scene. Then, the possible combinations of the camera and the objects ’ poses and the obtained images are not arbitrary but constrained to each other. Here we represent this constraint as a lower dimensional hypersurface in the product space of the whole combination of their motion control parameters and image data. The visual control is interpreted as to find a path on this surface leading to their poses where a given goal image will be obtained. In this paper, we propose a visual control method to utilize tangential properties of this surface. First, we represent images with a composition of {{a small number of}} “eigen images ” by using K-L (Karhunen-Loève) expansion. Then, we consider to reconstruct the <b>eigen</b> <b>space</b> (the eigen image space) to achieve efficient and straightforward controls. Such reconstruction of the space results in the constraint surface being mostly flat within the <b>eigen</b> <b>space.</b> By this method, visual control of robots in a complex configuration is achieved without image processing to extract and correspond image features in dynamic images. The method also does not need camera or hand-eye calibrations. Experimental results of visual servoing with the proposed method show the feasibility and applicability of our newly proposed approach to a simultaneous control of camera self-motion and object motions...|$|E

Therefore in such cases also the FRS must be self-trained to make the system up-to-date.

Even so, many AAA companies refrain from using face segmentation software as it gives the power of adding game content by the end users, and that may lead to an increased risk of offensive content, that goes against company standards and policy, to enter their application. By taking the concept of procedural generation and applying this together with face segmentation, placing a Principal Component Analysis (PCA) based texturization model, we allow for a controlled yet functioning face texturization in a run-time virtual environment. In this project we use MatLab to create a controlled <b>Eigen</b> <b>space,</b> infuses this into an application built in Unity 3 D using UMA, and lets smaller recreation vectors, that spans a few kilobytes as most, to create textures in run-time.
