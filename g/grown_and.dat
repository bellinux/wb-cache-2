5|$|A central {{principle}} of mainstream economics is that trade can make everyone better off through comparative advantage and efficiency gains from specialization and greater efficiency. Many feminist economists question this claim. Diane Elson, Caren <b>Grown</b> <b>and</b> Nilufer Cagatay explore {{the role that}} gender inequalities play in international trade and how such trade reshapes gender inequality itself. They and other feminist economists explore whose interests specific trade practices serve.|$|E

5|$|E85 flex-fuel {{vehicles}} {{are becoming increasingly}} common in the Midwest, where corn is a major crop and is the primary feedstock for ethanol fuel production. Regional retail E85 prices vary widely across the US, with more favorable prices in the Midwest region, where most corn is <b>grown</b> <b>and</b> ethanol produced. Depending of the vehicle capabilities, the break-even price of E85 has to be between 25 and 30% lower than gasoline.|$|E

5|$|It was {{not until}} after 9,500 BC that the eight {{so-called}} founder crops of agriculture appear: first emmer and einkorn wheat, then hulled barley, peas, lentils, bitter vetch, chick peas and flax. These eight crops occur more or less simultaneously on Pre-Pottery Neolithic B (PPNB) sites in the Levant, although wheat {{was the first to}} be <b>grown</b> <b>and</b> harvested on a significant scale. At around the same time (9400 BC), parthenocarpic fig trees were domesticated.|$|E

5|$|The main {{residual}} {{uncertainty in the}} early measurements was in the measurement of the isotopic composition of the silicon to calculate the atomic weight, so in 2007 a 4.8kg single crystal of isotopically-enriched silicon (99.94% 28Si) was <b>grown,</b> <b>and</b> two one-kilogram spheres cut from it. Diameter measurements on the spheres are repeatable to within 0.3nm, and the uncertainty in the mass is 3µg. Full results from these determinations were expected in late 2010.|$|E

5|$|After being enslaved for 12 years, Northup is {{restored}} to freedom {{and returned to}} his family, leaving behind the other slaves. As he walks into his home, he sees his wife with their son and daughter (fully <b>grown)</b> <b>and</b> her husband, who present him with his grandson and namesake, Solomon Northup Staunton. Solomon apologizes for his long absence while his family comforts him. The film's epilogue displays a series of graphics recounting Northup's unsuccessful suits against Brown, Hamilton and Burch, along with the 1853 publication of Northup's slave narrative memoir, Twelve Years a Slave. The memoir describes his role in the abolitionist movement, and the mystery surrounding details of his death and burial. Patsey and Solomon never met again.|$|E
5|$|After {{four years}} of doing his {{residency}} in Singkawang, Borneo, Dr. Pardi (Adnan Kapau Gani) returns to Java to open a practice. Before then, he goes to Cigading to visit his family and give them souvenirs. Upon arrival he is stunned to find that his family's maid Tati (Djoewariah), who had been his childhood playmate, is now a <b>grown</b> <b>and</b> beautiful woman. He secretly begins to fawn over Tati, although he does not tell her the reason. When Pardi's mother tells him he should marry quickly, he refuses all of her suggested brides. He says only that he already has someone in mind, aware that his mother would never approve an inter-class marriage with the maid.|$|E
5|$|Banksia acanthopoda {{is little}} known in cultivation, {{although}} it has been successfully <b>grown</b> <b>and</b> propagated at The Banksia Farm in Mount Barker, Western Australia, and at the Royal Botanic Gardens in Cranbourne, Melbourne. It is a sprawling and untidy shrub, but its habit can be improved by pruning. Its prominent yellow flower heads appear from July to October in cultivation, and have potential for use in the cut flower industry. It prefers a well-drained soil in full sun or light shade, and will tolerate dry conditions once established. Propagation is by seed; seeds take three to five weeks to germinate, and have a germination rate of 80 to 90 percent.|$|E

5|$|Campbell's dwarf hamster has cheek pouches, {{which are}} an {{extension}} of the mouth, extending from the mouth {{all the way to the}} rear legs. Food is transferred into these pouches through the diastema. The inside of the pouch contains a large number of folds of dermal papillae. When the pouch is full, it extends and becomes part of the structure of the skin. By 11 days of age, the cheek pouches are fully <b>grown</b> <b>and</b> can carry objects up to the size of a sunflower seed. When the cheek pouches become full, they extend back to the shoulder blades, which restrict movement.|$|E
5|$|Common herbs such as sage, mustard, {{and parsley}} were <b>grown</b> <b>and</b> used in cooking all over Europe, as were caraway, mint, dill and fennel. Many {{of these plants}} grew {{throughout}} all of Europe or were cultivated in gardens, and were a cheaper alternative to exotic spices. Mustard was particularly popular with meat products and was described by Hildegard of Bingen (1098–1179) as poor man's food. While locally grown herbs were less prestigious than spices, they were still used in upper-class food, but were then usually less prominent or included merely as coloring. Anise was used to flavor fish and chicken dishes, and its seeds were served as sugar-coated comfits.|$|E
5|$|Edible {{mushrooms}} are well-known examples of fungi. Many are commercially raised, but others must be harvested from the wild. Agaricus bisporus, sold as button mushrooms when small or Portobello mushrooms when larger, is a commonly eaten species, used in salads, soups, {{and many other}} dishes. Many Asian fungi are commercially <b>grown</b> <b>and</b> have increased in popularity in the West. They are often available fresh in grocery stores and markets, including straw mushrooms (Volvariella volvacea), oyster mushrooms (Pleurotus ostreatus), shiitakes (Lentinula edodes), and enokitake (Flammulina spp.).|$|E

5|$|Food and cuisine in Ireland {{takes its}} {{influence}} from the crops <b>grown</b> <b>and</b> animals farmed in the island's temperate climate {{and from the}} social and political circumstances of Irish history. For example, whilst from the Middle Ages until the arrival of the potato in the 16th century the dominant feature of the Irish economy was the herding of cattle, the number of cattle a person owned was equated to their social standing. Thus herders would avoid slaughtering a milk-producing cow.|$|E
5|$|In {{attempts}} {{to address the}} weaker structure of the reparative fibrocartilage, new techniques {{have been designed to}} fill the defect with tissue that more closely simulates normal hyaline articular cartilage. One such technique is autologous chondrocyte implantation (ACI), which is useful for large, isolated femoral defects in younger people. In this surgery, chondrocytes are arthroscopically extracted from the intercondylar notch of the articular surface. The chondrocytes are <b>grown</b> <b>and</b> injected into the defect under a periosteal patch. ACI surgery has reported good to excellent results for reduced swelling, pain and locking in clinical follow-up examinations. However, some physicians have preferred to use undifferentiated pluripotential cells, such as periosteal cells and bone marrow stem cells, as opposed to chondrocytes. These too have demonstrated the ability to regenerate both the cartilage and the underlying subchondral bone.|$|E
5|$|Like most of India, {{agriculture}} {{is one of}} the most significant sectors of the economy of Uttarakhand. Basmati rice, wheat, soybeans, groundnuts, coarse cereals, pulses, and oil seeds are the most widely grown crops. Fruits like apples, oranges, pears, peaches, litchis, and plums are widely <b>grown</b> <b>and</b> important to the large food processing industry. Agricultural export zones have been set up in the state for leechi, horticulture, herbs, medicinal plants, and basmati rice. During 2010, wheat production was 831 thousand tonnes and rice production was 610 thousand tonnes, while the main cash crop of the state, sugarcane, had a production of 5058 thousand tonnes. As 86% of the state consists of hills, the yield per hectare is not very high. 86% of all croplands are in the plains while the remaining is from the hills.|$|E

5|$|Over 80% of Chad's {{population}} {{relies on}} subsistence farming and livestock raising for its livelihood. The crops <b>grown</b> <b>and</b> {{the locations of}} herds {{are determined by the}} local climate. In the southernmost 10% of the territory lies the nation's most fertile cropland, with rich yields of sorghum and millet. In the Sahel only the hardier varieties of millet grow, and these with much lower yields than in the south. On the other hand, the Sahel is ideal pastureland for large herds of commercial cattle and for goats, sheep, donkeys and horses. The Sahara's scattered oases support only some dates and legumes. Chad's cities face serious difficulties of municipal infrastructure; only 48% of urban residents have access to potable water and only 2% to basic sanitation.|$|E
5|$|Spanish conquistadors brought {{potatoes}} and tomatoes from the Americas to Europe in the 16th century, but these vegetables only became commonly <b>grown</b> <b>and</b> consumed in Eastern Europe in the 19th century. Eventually, both became staples of peasant diet and essential ingredients of Ukrainian and Russian borscht. Potatoes replaced turnips in borscht recipes, and tomatoes – fresh, canned or paste – took over from beet sour {{as the source}} of tartness. The turnip is rarely found in modern recipes, and even then, together with potatoes. In Ukraine, beet sour and tomatoes were both used for some time until the latter ultimately prevailed during the last third of the 19th century.|$|E
5|$|Such a {{depiction}} {{is common}} in semitechnical and popular dinosaur literature. Robert T. Bakker has extended social behavior to parental care, and has interpreted shed allosaur teeth and chewed bones of large prey animals as evidence that adult allosaurs brought food to lairs for their young to eat until they were <b>grown,</b> <b>and</b> prevented other carnivores from scavenging on the food. However, there is actually little evidence of gregarious behavior in theropods, and social interactions {{with members of the}} same species would have included antagonistic encounters, as shown by injuries to gastralia and bite wounds to skulls (the pathologic lower jaw named Labrosaurus ferox is one such possible example). Such head-biting may have been a way to establish dominance in a pack or to settle territorial disputes.|$|E
