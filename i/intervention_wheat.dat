Polish wheat prices generally move to expected intervention prices and then stay there until the next intervention level becomes known.

Formal statistical tests are conducted through Johansen's cointegration approach to identify the long-term equilibrium relationship between futures and cash markets.

The wheat futures price from China Zhengzhou Commodity Exchange and soybeans futures price from Dalian Commodity Exchange with different forecasting horizons ranging from one week to six months are also used. Results suggest that a long-term equilibrium relationship between the futures price and cash price for soybeans has been established. A weak short-term efficiency of the soybean futures market is revealed. The futures market for wheat is inefficient. The relative inefficient wheat market may be caused by over-speculation and government <b>intervention,</b> because <b>wheat</b> is the staple food in China and the government has more control over it than soybeans.

A pooled cross section data on 72 countries is used to estimate these functions for wheat and rice. The results suggest that import demand elasticities are larger than their corresponding excess demand elasticities and that price transmission elasticities are less than unity.

Without proper grades, standards, and certification systems, however, farmers may remain uncertain {{about the actual}} financial return associated with their quality-enhancing investments. This report summarizes the outcomes of a short video-based randomized training <b>intervention</b> on <b>wheat</b> quality measurement and collective marketing among 15, 000 wheat farmers in Ethiopia. Our {{results suggest that the}} intervention led to significant changes in farmers’ commercialization behaviors—namely, it prompted farmers to adopt behaviors geared toward assessing their wheat’s quality using easily implementable test-weight measures, assessing the accuracy of the equipment used by buyers in their kebeles (scales, in particular), and contacting more than one buyer before concluding a sale. The training also led to improvements in share of output sold, price received, and collective marketing, albeit with important limitations. First, farmers who measured their wheat quality received a higher price, but only if their wheat was of higher quality. Second, farmers who found that their wheat was of higher quality were more reluctant to aggregate their wheat (that is, sell their products through local cooperatives) than those who found that their wheat was of lower quality. Lastly, the training intervention led to better use of fertilizer in the following season. Our discovery that a short training intervention can significantly change farmers’ marketing and production behavior should encourage the development of further interventions aimed at enhancing farmers’ adoption of improved technologies and commercialization.

Methods: Sixty subjects (46 females) were randomized to either a sorghum (<b>intervention)</b> or white <b>wheat</b> (control) group, receiving 45 g of flaked cereal biscuits to include daily in their prescribed diets for 12 weeks. Primary outcome was weight loss. Secondary outcomes included plasma glucose, glycosylated hemoglobin (HbA 1 c), insulin, total cholesterol, high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-c), low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-c), triacylglycerides (TAG), interleukin (IL) - 1 β, IL- 6, IL- 8, tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-α), high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hs-CRP), and total antioxidant capacity (TAC; measured at 0 and 12 weeks). Results: After 12 weeks, {{there were no significant}} differences in weight loss or any clinical variables between a wheat control and sorghum cereal group in an energy-restricted diet.

40|$|This thesis {{analyses}} {{the influence}} of Francoist agrarian policy on agricultural output in Spain in the 1939 - 55 period. The {{focus is on the}} wheat, olive and wine sectors, and special attention is given to small-scale farmers. Agrarian policy included price-fixing, production quotas and rationing of consumption. In the historical literature, this policy is often blamed for the post-Civil War decline in output. Yet, the present analysis states that this interpretation is erroneous. Producers and consumers circumvented intervention by creating a black market. When earnings from this source are included, value of output per unit of land remained close to pre-war levels. This also holds for small-scale farmers, although they benefited less from the black market than large-scale farmers did. It is then concluded that the decrease in wheat output was caused by lack of work animals and fertilisers rather than official prices. <b>Intervention</b> in the <b>wheat</b> sector was therefore desirable from a social viewpoint, but the system could have been improved. Average olive oil output was only below the pre-war level immediately after the war. Consequently, state intervention was unnecessary after 1942 - 43 and could have been abolished long before it was finally done in 1952. Thus, the intervention in the olive sector is an example of state failure. In the wine sector, policy aimed at increasing farm prices rather than decreasing consumer prices. Table wine consumption declined after the war, but this was counteracted by higher demand for high-alcohol white wine for the production of brandy and industrial alcohol. The winegrowers in Toledo successfully reacted by increasing output of high-alcohol white wine. Yet, the strategy led to overproduction, and state protection was increased in 1952 - 53. Consequently, state intervention had different effects on different sub-sectors. However, in none of the cases did output decline significantly because of the price policy...|$|R
40|$|Adoption of {{the green}} {{revolution}} technology helped India accelerate the growth in wheat production which in turn helped in reducing the heavy dependence on wheat imports to meet the domestic demand. However, the growth in production was never large enough to meet the domestic demand on a sustained basis. While {{most of the times}} the wheat production fell short of the demand, in some years the production exceeded the effective demand. Because of this, imbalances in domestic demand and supply of wheat are a recurrent phenomenon. Since these imbalances create serious problems for producers and consumers, and also for the market stability, the government has been intervening actively to stabilize the <b>wheat</b> market. Such <b>interventions</b> have been in various forms like- public procurement, guaranteed price to the producers, open market sales, maintenance of buffer stock, public distribution system, tariffs, export, import and trade regulations. However, these interventions typically have several other goals besides market stabilization. These demand and supply imbalances in the case of wheat have become more serious in the recent period, which is a cause of concern. This is indicated by the increase in fluctuations in the net trade of wheat, and from the stock held by public agencies (Fig. 1 and 2). After 1998, India was caught in a spiral of accumulation of large stock of wheat, followed by large exports, and the subsequent depletion of stock followed by large imports. Again the country started building stock of wheat beginning with July 2008 {{and it seems to be}} at a threshold of accumulating the large stock.

The {{aim of this study}} was to examine whether a replacement diet, thereby substituting all other cereal grains, with products made with organic khorasan wheat could provide additive protective effects in reducing lipid, oxidative and inflammatory risk factors, in patients with Acute Coronary Syndromes (ACS) in comparison to a similar replacement diet using products made from organic modern wheat. A randomized double-blinded crossover trial with two intervention phases was conducted on 22 ACS patients (9 F; 13 M). The patients were assigned to consume products (bread, pasta, biscuits and crackers) made either from organic semi-whole khorasan wheat or organic semi-whole control wheat for eight weeks in a random order. On average, patients ingested 62. 0 g dry weight (DW) day− 1 khorasan or control semolina; and 140. 5 g DW day− 1 khorasan or control flour, respectively. An eight-week washout period was implemented between the respective interventions. Blood analyses were performed both at the beginning and end of each intervention phase; thereby permitting a comparison of both the khorasan and control intervention phases, respectively, on circulatory risk factors for the same patient. Consumption of products made with khorasan wheat resulted in a significant amelioration in total cholesterol (− 6. 8 %), low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) (− 8. 1 %) glucose (− 8 %) and insulin (− 24. 6 %) from baseline levels, independently of age, sex, traditional risk factors, medication and diet quality.

40|$|In {{the late}} 19 th and early 20 th century, as wheat {{production}} and marketing were transformed in scale and in practice, American farmers {{tried to make}} sense of how they were positioned within a rapidly growing and changing international market. They tried to formulate a response that would gain them some sense of control over a market that was described by some as vast and powerful as nature itself, and by others as a playground for the wealthy speculators who supposedly controlled it. By situating the farmers within the changing international grain market this thesis explains the challenges that they were up against. American farmers understood their plight through narratives of market failure, common enough during the agricultural depression of the 1890 s, {{as well as in the}} first decade of the twentieth century: declining prices, distant famines, and attempts to corner the wheat market reinforced the notion that supply and demand were not working "properly" to produce prosperity for all. During the Populist period, farmers organized to demand relief, in the form of government intervention, from what they perceived as a predatory market system that guaranteed profits to speculators but usually left producers with little to show for their labor. They mounted a moral critique of the marketing system, arguing that merchants and middlemen had organized the market in such a way as to control it through unethical and damaging means such as pools and price agreements. These efforts having largely failed, farmers turned increasingly to the cooperative movement to try to exert influence in the marketplace. The crisis of World War I created a different kind of market failure, one that prompted different forms of government <b>intervention</b> in both <b>wheat</b> importing and wheat exporting countries. In both cases these interventions were designed to stabilize prices through centralized oversight, something the farmers had repeatedly asked for and failed to achieve, but found, in the end, did little to secure their way of life. In the aftermath of war, in what was for wheat farmers a permanent crisis requiring permanent government intervention, farmers continued to identify the middlemen as their problem, but after 50 years of controversy, the merchants and exchanges had established a relatively well-oiled and highly technical system of marketing and trading to handle commodities in an international market. Farmers were left with little choice but to think of themselves as businessmen dealing with other businessmen, and this position overtook the older moral discourse as farmers sought to marshal their cooperative strength toward forming their own price-controlling marketing organizations...|$|R

40|$|Inflation, {{especially}} in food prices, has been persistently high in India {{during the past}} twenty four months. This {{has been a source}} of concern to policy-makers. Fortunately, food price increases are now starting to ease, after the major spike that occurred in the wake of the severe drought of 2009. However, there still remains concern that we: (a) need to better understand the factors that drive such spikes in key prices; and (b) design more effective policies to prevent such future price spikes. The main approach to understanding inflation and its drivers has typically rested, on the whole, in assessing aggregate macroeconomic (aggregate supply and demand) conditions, which then typically leads to consideration of macroeconomic and monetary) policies as the principal tool to deal with inflation surges. That may indeed be appropriate in most circumstances, but is often a blunt, sometimes costly instrument that can stifle growth, especially if price pressures arise from (temporary) supply constraints. Therefore, it may be important to complement an aggregate macroeconomic analysis of inflation with microeconomic analysis: to ascertain if inflation is being driven by specific price spikes in important food and non-food commodities, which has the potential to drive other commodity prices in a cost-push manner. This paper, on global wheat market developments, price transmission and impacts on Indian domestic markets, as well as an assessment of public policies to manage domestic prices, is part of a larger effort to improve our in-house (Department of Economic Affairs) research [...] -to track, monitor and forecast fast-moving key macro-economic variables with potentially large consequences for public policy. We have begun to intensify our efforts. We are investing further systematically [...] -to understand growth and inflation dynamics in the context of rising food inflationary pressures in India and worldwide. We are capturing more high frequency data, and applying quantitative modeling tools (as evident in our current Economic Survey). We take up wheat in this paper, because of recent rapid price rises globally, as well as domestically, and because it constitutes a major element of the overall wholesale and consumer food price inflation indices. Some aspects of the price formation and policy <b>intervention</b> processes in <b>wheat</b> are also likely to be structurally similar for other similar classes of important food items (such as rice), permitting broader insights. Our paper draws upon existing theoretical insights and modeling attempts in the literature; it is, nevertheless, useful to note three “biases” in our approach: (a) favoring analysis of short-term, high-frequency price formation (daily, monthly, or quarterly), versus alternative longer-term annual, structural models; (b) favoring simplified reduced form forecasting models that track high-frequency turning points well, over more elaborate models and tests of longerduration time-series data (which may tend to be more historical and backward-looking, and less useful for short-term forecasting); and (c) assessing current India-specific public interventions in greater detail, than in more general academic papers and models. ...|$|R
40|$|Magister Curationis - MCurIn this minithesis a {{systematic}} review {{of all of}} the available contemporary literature on post-breast cancer lymphoedema was undertaken. The purpose of this systematic review was to search for, collate, synthesize and thereby provide the reader with a comprehensive, evidence-based account of all the available research published between 1988 and 2008 on the treatment of post-breast cancer lymphoedema with natural medicine. Because the large number of articles published every year across a plethora of biomedical journals makes it incredibly difficult for practitioners to keep up-to-date within their specialized areas, systematic reviews are particularly useful as they summarize high quality, contemporary scientific knowledge on a topic in one place (Antman, Lau, Kupelnik, Mosteller & Chalmers, 1992). One such topic on which many health practitioners have a paucity of information regarding management and risk reduction is lymphoedema (Radina, Armer, Culbertson & Dusold, 2004) The primary objective of this research project was to assess the effects of natural medicine on post-breast cancer lymphoedema in regard to 1) life style improvement including any signs and symptoms related to the condition such as heaviness, tightness, pain, ache, itch, mobility of the affected arm, skin texture as well as psychological symptoms like distress; 2) arm volume changes of the affected limb; 3) adverse effects; and 4) modification or cessation of treatment. Several online databases were searched for articles that contain the term lymphoedema, lymphedema, limb swelling or "linfedema" (Spanish and Portuguese); thereby including all possible spellings in English, Spanish and Portuguese. Relevant information was extracted and recorded in tabular format. The quality of each study was analysed using a checklist,which was drawn up by the primary researcher and study supervisor based on the CONSORT guidelines (Altman, 1996). To ensure quality, only randomized controlled trials, quasi-randomized controlled trials or clinical trials that met the inclusion or exclusion criteria, reporting benefits or adverse effects of natural medicines for the treatment of post-breast cancer lymphoedema were included. In addition,studies had to focus on natural medicine versus placebo or routine treatment or no treatment as types of intervention; and participants had to include women of all ages that had been diagnosed with post-breast cancer lymphoedema. The relevant data from included studies was entered into Review Manager 5 (Revman 5) software for meta-analysis. The primary studies included in this systematic review generally suffered from small sample sizes, varied somewhat in their operationalisation of outcomes and the format for presenting results, making meta-analysis very difficult. However, results suggest that sodium selenite taken orally and CYCLO 3 FORT also taken orally are effective in the reduction of limb volume. The results also suggested that aromatherapy using an <b>intervention</b> cream containing <b>wheat</b> germ oil and essential oils of fennel, sage, geranium, black pepper and juniper; and vitamin E plus pentoxifylline taken orally are not effective. Seeing as these results are drawn from single studies with heterogeneous outcome variables, they should be seen as tentative until they are confirmed by replication. Gaps in the literature regarding natural medicine as a treatment for post-breast cancer lymphoedema were identified, and recommendations for further research are proposed...|$|R

Further, to identify the reported incidence of adverse effects, such as abdominal pain or diarrhoea, that resulted from the fibre intervention. Search methods: We identified randomised controlled trials (RCTs) from Cochrane Colorectal Cancer's Specialised Register, CENTRAL, MEDLINE and Embase (search date, 4 April 2016). We also searched ClinicalTrials. gov and WHO International Trials Registry Platform on October 2016. Selection criteria: We included RCTs or quasi-RCTs. The population were those having a history of adenomatous polyps, but no previous history of CRC, and repeated visualisation of the colon/rectum after at least two-years' follow-up. Dietary fibre was the intervention. The primary outcomes were the number of participants with: 1. at least one adenoma, 2. more than one adenoma, 3. at least one adenoma {{greater than or equal to}} 1 cm, or 4. a new diagnosis of CRC. The secondary outcome was the number of adverse events. Data collection and analysis: Two reviewers independently extracted data, assessed trial quality and resolved discrepancies by consensus. We used risk ratios (RR) and risk difference (RD) with 95 % confidence intervals (CI) to measure the effect. If statistical significance was reached, we reported the number needed to treat for an additional beneficial outcome (NNTB) or harmful outcome (NNTH). We combined the study data using the fixed-effect model if it was clinically, methodologically, and statistically reasonable. Main results: We included seven studies, of which five studies with 4798 participants provided data for analyses in this review. The mean ages of the participants ranged from 56 to 66 years. All participants had a history of adenomas, which had been removed to achieve a polyp-free colon at baseline. The <b>interventions</b> were <b>wheat</b> bran fibre, ispaghula husk, or a comprehensive dietary intervention with high fibre whole food sources alone or in combination. The comparators were low-fibre (2 to 3 g per day), placebo, or a regular diet. The combined data showed no statistically significant difference between the intervention and control groups for the number of participants with at least one adenoma (5 RCTs, n = 3641, RR 1. 04, 95 % CI 0. 95 to 1. 13, low-quality evidence), more than one adenoma (2 RCTs, n = 2542, RR 1. 06, 95 % CI 0. 94 to 1. 20, low-quality evidence), or at least one adenoma 1 cm or greater (4 RCTs, n = 3224, RR 0. 99, 95 % CI 0. 82 to 1. 20, low-quality evidence) at three to four years. The results on the number of participants diagnosed with colorectal cancer favoured the control group over the dietary fibre group (2 RCTS, n = 2794, RR 2. 70, 95 % CI 1. 07 to 6. 85, low-quality evidence). After 8 years of comprehensive dietary intervention, no statistically significant difference was found in the number of participants with at least one recurrent adenoma (1 RCT, n = 1905, RR 0. 97, 95 % CI 0. 78 to 1. 20), or with more than one adenoma (1 RCT, n = 1905, RR 0. 89, 95 % CI 0. 64 to 1. 24). More participants given ispaghula husk group had at least one recurrent adenoma than the control group (1 RCT, n = 376, RR 1. 45, 95 % CI 1. 01 to 2. 08). Other analyses by types of fibre intervention were not statistically significant. The overall dropout rate was over 16 % in these trials with no reasons given for these losses. Sensitivity analysis incorporating these missing data shows that none of the results can be considered as robust; when the large numbers of participants lost to follow-up were assumed to have had an event or not, the results changed sufficiently to alter the conclusions that we would draw. Therefore, the reliability of the findings may have been compromised by these missing data (attrition bias) and should be interpreted with caution. Authors' conclusions: There is a lack of evidence from existing RCTs to suggest that increased dietary fibre intake will reduce the recurrence of adenomatous polyps in those with a history of adenomatous polyps within a two to eight year period. However, these results may be unreliable and should be interpreted cautiously, not only because of the high rate of loss to follow-up, but also because adenomatous polyp is a surrogate outcome for the unobserved true endpoint CRC. Longer-term trials with higher dietary fibre levels are needed to enable confident conclusion...|$|R
40|$|Pulses (legumes) are {{a common}} dietary {{constituent}} of ethnic communities exhibiting lower rates of cardiovascular disease (CVD). The following studies examined the effect of including chickpeas in an 'Australian' diet on CVD risk factors. Participants were free-living volunteers aged 30 to 70 years. Study 1 investigated the effect of chickpeas on serum lipids, lipoproteins, glycaemic control, bowel function and satiation (degree of fullness leading to meal cessation) compared to a higher-fibre wheat-supplemented diet (Chapter 2). Participants completed two controlled dietary interventions (chickpea-supplemented and higher-fibre wheat-supplemented), isocaloric with their usual dietary intake, in random order. The design of the intervention diets was for matched macronutrient content and dietary fibre however increased consumption of polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA) during the chickpea-supplemented diet was noted. Small but significant reductions in mean serum total cholesterol and low density lipoproteincholesterol (LDL-C) were reported following the chickpea diet compared to the wheat. Statistical analysis suggested a relationship between increased consumption of PUFA and reduction in cholesterol during the chickpea intervention but could not discern the source of PUFA. Chickpea supplementation did not adversely affect bowel function and participants found them very satiating. There was no effect on glycaemic control. A small, sub-study compared the effects of an isocaloric, lower-fibre wheat diet to the higher-fibre wheat, to evaluate the effect of quantity of fibre as well as source on bowel health and satiety. During the lower-fibre <b>wheat</b> <b>intervention,</b> some participants reported lower satiation, and poorer bowel health. Some of {{the results from this}} study were included in a larger, collaborative study investigating the effect of chickpeas on serum lipids and lipoproteins in two centres, Launceston and Melbourne. The Melbourne group followed a similar controlled, random crossover comparison of a chickpeasupplemented diet to a higher-fibre wheat-supplemented diet, also endeavouring to match macronutrient content and dietary fibre. The Melbourne group also reported small but significant reductions in mean serum LDL- and total cholesterol but reported discrepancies in consumption of PUFA as well as dietary fibre between the intervention diets. Statistical analysis of the combined results suggested a relationship between increased consumption of PUFA and dietary fibre and a reduction in cholesterol during the chickpea intervention. Appendix 1 is a description of this collaborative study, formatted as a scientific paper, accepted for publication. Study 2 investigated whether results from the controlled study would translate to ad libitum situations (Chapter 3). The study followed an ordered crossover design where participants followed their habitual ad libitum dietary intake for four weeks (familiarisation phase), incorporated a minimum of four 300 g (net weight) cans of chickpeas per week for 12 weeks and then resumed their habitual diet for another four weeks (usual phase). Small but significant reductions in body weight, body mass index (BMI), serum TC, fasting insulin and HOMA-IR occurred following the chickpea phase, compared to the post-chickpea usual phase. Results suggested that participants positively altered their eating pattern during the pre-chickpea familiarisation phase, sustained these changes during the 12 -week chickpea phase but regressed during the usual phase. Participants consumed significantly more dietary fibre and PUFA during the chickpea phase and less total fat and saturated fatty acids (SFA) compared to the usual phase. Perceived bowel health remained constant throughout the study, while satiation increased significantly during the chickpea phase along with a small but significant reduction in mean body weight. Incorporating chickpeas into an 'Australian' style diet resulted in increased consumption of PUFA and dietary fibre that produced small but significant reductions in serum TC, BMI and glycaemic control, high satiation and little effect on bowel function. Individuals wishing to reduce CVD risk may choose to include chickpeas in their diet...|$|R
40|$|Background: Whole grain intake is {{associated}} with reduced risk of chronic diseases, such as cardiovascular disease and Type 2 diabetes. Unlike more commonly recognised whole grains, sorghum is a so-called “ancient”, gluten-free whole grain food that is gaining attention from food manufacturers, consumers and researchers as a beneficial ingredient in novel product development. Sorghum is widely cultivated globally due to its adaptability to semi-arid/arid conditions and high temperatures, and has significant potential for sustainable grain production in harsh climates. It is a dietary staple in some communities of Asia, Africa and Central America, however {{in countries such as}} the United States and Australia, sorghum is predominantly used as an animal feed, with only small quantities utilised for the manufacture of human foods. If sorghum is to be accepted as a common food, attention to food formulations and processing methods that produce desirable sorghum-based cereal products, whilst preserving the grain’s beneficial nutritional and functional attributes, is required. Sorghum whole grain has been shown to have lower starch and protein digestibility in vitro, resulting in reduced metabolisable energy and hence smaller weight gains in animals, and some cultivars are high in dietary fibre and rich in polyphenolic compounds. Based on their purported mechanisms, these attributes may contribute to positive effects on metabolic markers and body weight and therefore may more broadly influence chronic disease prevention in humans when they consume sorghum-based foods regularly. However, there is a paucity of human studies to date. Research Hypothesis and Study Aims: This thesis proposes that sorghum grain consumption may assist in chronic disease prevention via weight management, especially in populations where food is ubiquitous and obesity-related chronic diseases are prevalent. Research examining the effects of sorghum intake on health outcomes, such as weight loss and disease biomarkers, requires clinical studies. These studies may also expose potential protective roles of the sorghum grain as part of a whole diet. The key hypothesis of this thesis is that sorghum is a viable alternative to more commonly consumed whole grain cereals in the human diet and may have positive benefits on factors associated with metabolic health including weight management. A review of the literature described sorghum grain structure and composition which relate to mechanisms by which sorghum grain components may influence weight management and chronic disease risk; and summarised the evidence on effects of sorghum consumption on health outcomes related to chronic disease prevention. This review provided insights into the knowledge gaps and study imperatives that informed the experimental components of the thesis. In order to conduct human trials successfully, particularly with participants who do not typically consume traditional sorghum foods, suitable ready-to-eat sorghum grained cereal foods in the form of flaked breakfast cereal biscuits were formulated and tested prior to intervention trials commencing. A randomised, crossover, feeding study using the flaked sorghum biscuits was conducted to investigate mechanisms related to general metabolic markers and antioxidant status, as well as acute satiety. A randomised controlled trial (RCT) was then conducted with the aim to test the weight-loss effects of longer-term whole grain sorghum flaked biscuits consumption incorporated into an energy-restricted diet plan. This study also examined the effects on key biomarkers of metabolic health, inflammation and oxidative stress. Methods: Gaps in the knowledge of effects of sorghum consumption on indicators of metabolic disease, including weight, were identified and elements of study designs were incorporated into the experimental components of the thesis. Whole grain flaked cereal biscuits were formulated on a pilot line by our industry partner (Sanitarium Health and Wellness) using a multistep process involving steaming, drying, rolling and baking. For the acute satiety study, forty subjects (20 males and 20 females) were tested on four occasions after a 12 -hour fast. At baseline, they consumed 50 grams (or 3 biscuits) of one of four treatment meals: white, red or brown whole grain sorghum flaked biscuits or a whole grain flaked wheat biscuit control. Subjective satiety was measured at 8 time-points over four hours and food intake at the subsequent meal {{and for the rest of}} the day recorded. In a subset of 20 subjects, plasma glucose, insulin, and four appetite-related gut peptides (GIP, GLP- 1, PYY and ghrelin) were also measured. In the subsequent RCT investigating chronic sorghum consumption, sixty subjects (14 males and 46 females) were randomised to either a sorghum (<b>intervention)</b> or <b>wheat</b> (control) group. Both groups received advice on an energy-restricted diet from an Accredited Practising Dietitian and were provided with 45 g of cereal products to include daily in their prescribed diets for 12 weeks. The primary outcome was weight loss. Secondary outcomes included: plasma glucose, HbA 1 c, insulin, total cholesterol, HDL-c, LDL-c, TAG, and various markers of inflammation and oxidative stress (IL 1 β, IL- 6, IL- 8, TNFα, hsCRP, HPX and TAC), measured at 0 and 12 weeks. Subjective satiety ratings were assessed at 0, 6 and 12 weeks. Results: A vast array of nutritional and bioactive sorghum grain components, such as slowly digestible starches, polyphenols including anthocyanins in red sorghum, unsaturated fatty acids, and dietary fibre (including resistant starch), were identified in the literature, with potential actions in health protective metabolic processes. There was a paucity of human studies that are necessary to better understand effects of sorghum consumption (as a whole food), especially those related to health outcomes and indicators of disease. These findings justified the human studies described. During the acute meal test study, subjects reported significantly lower satiety ratings after consuming wheat compared to sorghum biscuits. Incremental AUC of postprandial GLP- 1, GIP and in males, PYY, were significantly higher (p= 0. 018, p= 0. 031, p= 0. 036 respectively) for sorghum breakfasts compared to wheat. Energy intake at a subsequent meal did not differ between treatments, nor did glucose, ghrelin and TAC responses. The red sorghum biscuit showed the greatest alteration in appetite hormones, suggesting that the specific combination of its components (such as unique anthocyanin flavonoids) requires further investigation. Hence, these results informed the choice of a red sorghum-based biscuit to test in the subsequent 3 month RCT. This trial did not identify any significant differences in weight loss or any clinical variables between a sorghum cereal group and a wheat control in an energy-restricted diet. For both groups, the majority of clinical indices changed significantly over time (p Conclusions: Research presented in this thesis provides human evidence for acute satiety effects from whole grain sorghum ingestion in the form of flaked cereal biscuits. However, it could not be concluded that whole grain sorghum assists specifically with weight management, or is superior to wheat (another whole grain product). Further clinical trials are necessary to establish an evidence base for weight loss effects from chronic sorghum consumption. In the longer term, this research would help to further evaluate the weight loss potential of sorghum consumption, especially red sorghum grown in abundance locally in Australia. Weight loss effects would be considered to assist in the prevention of chronic diseases, particularly those associated with obesity. Nevertheless, new knowledge was generated from these studies demonstrating the potential of sorghum consumption to enhance acute satiety. Sorghum is not only a gluten-free whole grain cereal, but also a promising ingredient in cereal foods targeting appetite control. Commercially, the results of the feeding trials may contribute to the development of the sorghum industry globally by adding to the evidence base on human health effects. This thesis also showcases the collaboration between food industry and science to progress sorghum, a relatively unknown human food in Australia, through the food product innovation pipeline with positive outcomes for all stakeholders including researchers, food manufacturers and also consumers...|$|R
