40|$|The {{thermal stress}} of the {{internally}} finned bayonet tube used for high temperature heat exchangers is numerically investigated by ANSYS software. Three kinds of lateral fin profiles, namely Z-shape, S-shape and V-shape are studied and compared. The significant temperature gradient and largest Von Mises stress are acquired. The largest stress is still generated in the joint of <b>inner</b> <b>fin</b> and outer tube due to the discontinuous change of the structure. The <b>inner</b> <b>fin</b> and inner tube are proposed to not be welded together to meet the reliability. The Z-shape has the best performance in both heat transfer and reliability, and is recommended for engineering application in high temperature heat exchangers. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

At first, heat exchange experiment {{has been done in}} the case when the spring fin has been inserted as extended heat exchange surface into the heat exchange channel. Within the experimental ranges studied, the small diameter spring achieves the largest heat exchange performance with the smallest pressure loss penalty. Especially, an optimum spring pitch may exist at the p/d value less than 10. Such a desirable spring fin shows large heat exchange performance than <b>inner</b> <b>fin</b> and louvered fin elements. Secondly, an experimental set-up based on the unsteady method that can quickly evaluate the heat transfer performance has been explained. Thirdly, new idea of dynamic heat exchanger unit based on an impinging jet has been introduced...|$|E

The investigated operational parameters were the maximum operational temperature {{and the number of}} repeated heating-cooling cycles. The TCR was experimentally determined by measuring the total heat supply, core tube wall and <b>inner</b> <b>fin</b> surface temperatures for steady-state and natural-convection conditions. In addition, the specimen was tested through up to 200 heating-cooling cycles. The experimental results showed a TCR increase of 81 % {{at the same time as}} the average temperature difference between the hot inner flow and cooling air increased from 30 °C to 130 °C; over the maximum operational temperature (120 °C), the TCR increased faster than before; and, after the heating-cooling cycle testing the TCR presented an increase of 31 % in respect with the initial value. Such findings may be useful as a reference for preliminary thermal design and as recommendations for optimal operation of heat exchangers based on copper-aluminum L-type finned tubes...|$|E
40|$|Abstract Internal heat {{exchanger}} (IHX) apparatus using the temperature difference {{between high and}} low pressure lines in vehicle air conditioning system is a good method to enhance the cooling performance. In this study, we designed various double-pipe internal {{heat exchanger}}s which have <b>inner</b> <b>fins</b> between the internal pipe and external pipe. We also measured the performance characteristic (pressure drop, cooling capacity, compressor work and coefficient of performance (COP)) of the modified internal heat exchangers that had the change of the fin height and the inside shape of the internal pipe. This experimental results indicated that the liner and serration type internal heat exchanger was the best cooling performance. In addition, the air conditioning system with the liner and serration type internal heat exchanger showed the improved performances of about 6. 4 % and 9. 2 %, respectively, for the cooling capacity and COP...|$|R
40|$|The {{turbine blade}} works at high thermal loads, {{especially}} the trailing {{edge of the}} blade due to the hot gas leakage flow. Pin-fins are well recognized as a kind of effective device to augment the convective heat transfer and effectively cool the trailing edge.

A 90 deg turn cooling wedge passage with cylindrical pin-fins is used to model the trailing edge.

40|$|A {{numerical}} {{investigation was}} carried out to evaluate the melting characteristics of phase change material (PCM) in an <b>inner</b> <b>fin</b> type rectangular encapsulation using different fin shape configurations. Despite straight fins are the commonly used in PCM thermal storage for heat transfer enhancement mechanism, {{increasing the number of}} fins can significantly hamper the natural convection effects which will only lead to a marginal improvement in heat transfer rate. Hence, exploring different geometrical fin shapes can be another option to improve heat transfer rate or served as an alternative method for thermal enhancement in latent heat storage system. This paper presents extensive computational simulation on the PCM melting in four different investigated fin shapes: straight fin, T-shape fin, Y-shape fin and cross-shape fin configurations. Fluent 6. 3 simulation software was utilized in producing two-dimensional simulation to visualize the PCM melting fractions, temperature distributions and flow fields of the melting process internally. The results had shown that changing the geometrical fin shape was able to deliver comparable melting performance as the conventional straight fin configuration. The natural convection current formations and circulation patterns will be discussed in this paper...|$|E
40|$|Abstract: Experiments were {{performed}} to investigate the performance enhancement of single-phase flow and boiling heat transfer in the 3 D inner finned helical tubes. The tests for single-phase flow and heat transfer were {{carried out in the}} helical tubes with a curvature of 0. 0663 and a length of 1. 15 m, the range of the Reynolds number examined varies from 1000 to 8500. In comparison to the smooth helical tube, the experimental results of two finned helical tubes with different <b>inner</b> <b>fin</b> geometry showed that the heat transfer and flow resistance in the 3 D inner finned helical tube gains greater augmentation. Within the measured range of Reynolds number, the average augmentation ratio of heat transfer of the two finned tubes are 71 % and 103 %, compared with the smooth helical tube, and 90 % and 140 % for flow resistance, respectively. The tests for flow boiling heat transfer was carried out in the 3 D inner finned helical tube with a curvature of 0. 0605 and a length of 0. 668 m. Compared with that in the smooth helical tube, the boiling heat transfer coefficient in the 3 D inner finned helical tube is increased by 40 %~ 120 % under varied mass flow rate and wall heat flux conditions, meanwhile, the flow resistance coefficient increased by 18 %~ 119 %...|$|E
40|$|Mercury (Hg) {{exposure}} poses {{a threat}} to both fish and human health. Sharks are known to bioaccumulate Hg, however, little is known regarding how Hg is distributed between different tissue groups (e. g. muscle regions, organs). Here we evaluated total mercury (THg) concentrations from eight muscle regions, four fins (first dorsal, left and right pectorals, caudal-from both the inner core and trailing margin of each fin), and five internal organs (liver, kidney, spleen, heart, epigonal organ) from two different shark species, bonnethead (Sphyrna tiburo) and silky shark (Carcharhinus falciformis) to determine the relationships of THg concentrations between and within tissue groups. Total Hg concentrations were highest in the eight muscle regions with no significant differences in THg concentrations between the different muscle regions and muscle types (red and white). Results from tissue collected from any muscle region would be representative of all muscle sample locations. Total Hg concentrations were lowest in samples taken from the <b>fin</b> <b>inner</b> core of the first dorsal, pectoral, and caudal (lower lobe) fins. Mercury concentrations for samples taken from the trailing margin of the dorsal, pectoral, and caudal fins (upper and lower lobe) were also not significantly different from each other for both species. Significant relationships were found between THg concentrations in dorsal axial muscle tissue and the <b>fin</b> <b>inner</b> core, liver, kidney, spleen and heart for both species as well as the THg concentrations between the dorsal fin trailing margin and the heart for the silky shark and all other sampled tissue types for the bonnethead shark. Our results suggest that biopsy sampling of dorsal muscle can provide data that can effectively estimate THg concentrations in specific organs without using more invasive, or lethal methods...|$|R

40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to measure and portray blood {{movement}} in the placenta in vivo in normal and growth restricted pregnancies, using Intra Voxel Incoherent Motion (IVIM) magnetic resonance imaging. Thirteen patients with apparently normal healthy pregnancies were scanned at 31 +/- 7 (mean+/-s. d.) weeks gestation and seven patients with intrauterine growth restriction (IUGR) were scanned at 31 +/- 4 weeks. A region of interest (ROI) was defined encompassing the placenta between the decidual and chorionic plates. The volume of moving blood within each imaging voxel of the ROI was then calculated as a percentage of the total voxel volume (f per cent). This information was colour coded to produce maps of moving blood volume. The placenta was segmented length ways into two zones of approximately equal area, termed inner and outer, the latter being adjacent to the uterine wall. f was fitted for the average in the outer zone (f(out)) and <b>inner</b> zone (<b>f(in)).</b> The parameter (f(out) -f(in)) was then calculated for each subject. This was positive in 12 / 13 of the normal cases and zero for one case (+ 10 per cent+ 10, mean+/-s. d.). For pregnancy affected by IUGR this value was negative in all cases (- 4 per cent+/- 3). Perfusion fraction mapping identified differences in function within the normal placenta in vivo, and between the placentae of normal and IUGR pregnancies. The technique has potential applications in managing, and investigating the aetiology of, pregnancy compromise...|$|R
40|$|High power {{diode laser}} arrays have found {{increasing}} {{applications in the}} field of pumping solid-state lasers and fiber lasers. Due to the thermal crosstalk across diode laser arrays and non-uniformity of local flow rate within microchannel cooler, junction temperature distribution becomes inhomogeneous, consequently leading to spectrum broadening and large beam divergence of diode laser pumping sources. In this work, an analytical method and numerical heat transfer based on finite volume method were employed to optimize the inner structure of microchannel cooler so as to obtain low thermal resistance and uniform junction temperature distribution for the diode laser arrays. Three-dimensional numerical models were developed to study the fluid flow and heat transfer of copper stacked microchannel coolers with different dimensions and arrangements of <b>inner</b> channels and <b>fins.</b> More uniform junction temperature distribution of diode laser array package could be achieved by self-heating compensation with specific coolant covering width.

The heat transfer characteristics of those refrigerants R 134 a, R 1234 ze(E) and R 1234 ze(Z) are experimentally compared in this study. Their heat transfer coefficient and pressure gradient in a horizontal microfin tube are measured at temperatures of 40 and 50 oC for condensation, and temperature of 30 oC for evaporation. The equivalent <b>inner</b> diameter, <b>fin</b> height, and surface enlargement to the equivalent smooth tube of the microfin tube are 5. 34 mm, 0. 255 mm, and 2. 24, respectively. The thermodynamic and transport properties of R 1234 ze(Z) are calculated by Reprop (Lemmon et al., 2013) associated the fluid file provided by Akasaka (2013) that is proposed to fit the experimental data by Higashi et al. (2013) and Miyara et al. (2013). For condensation, the heat transfer coefficient and pressure gradient of R 1234 ze(Z) are higher than those of R 1234 ze(E) and R 134 a at mass flux of 200 kg m- 2 s- 1 and heat flux of 10 kW m- 2. This is mainly because of the higher vapor velocity due to lower vapor density, larger liquid thermal conductivity and latent heat comparing to R 134 a and R 1234 ze(E). The experimentally determined heat transfer coefficient and pressure gradient are reasonably agree with the predicted values by Cavallini et al. (2009), Yonemoto et al. (2006), and Kadzierski et al.
