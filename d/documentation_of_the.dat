5|$|The {{extent of}} Rommel's {{involvement}} in the military's resistance against Hitler or the 20 July plot is difficult to ascertain, as people most directly involved did not survive, and limited <b>documentation</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> conspirators' plans and preparations exists.

5|$|Although {{there is}} no {{reliable}} <b>documentation</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> demographic impact of the Black Death in Scotland, there are some indications of the immediate effects of the plague. Walter Bower recorded that 24, about a third, of the canons of St. Andrews died during the outbreak. There are also anecdotal references to abandoned land in the following decades. If the pattern followed that in England, then the population may have fallen to as low as half a million {{by the end of}} the fifteenth century. Compared with the distribution of population after the later Clearances and the Industrial Revolution, these numbers would have been relatively evenly spread over the kingdom, with roughly half living north of the River Tay.|$|E
5|$|Archaeologists {{have been}} aware of ancient sites in the area since at least the 1940s; early work {{occurred}} at Aspero on the coast, a site identified as early as 1905, and later at Caral further inland.

A 2001 paper in Science, providing a survey of the Caral research, and a 2004 article in Nature, describing fieldwork and radiocarbon dating across a wider area, revealed Norte Chico's full significance and led to widespread interest.|$|E

5|$|In 2008, {{a survey}} of {{historic}} properties in the county was undertaken by the State Historic Preservation Office of the West Virginia Division of Culture and History. Following this survey, the Hampshire County Historic Landmarks Commission and the Hampshire County Commission began an initiative to place these identified structures and districts on the National Register of Historic Places. Preparation of the necessary documentation for Hebron Church, French's Mill, Yellow Spring Mill, and the Nathaniel and Isaac Kuykendall House began in April 2013, when Governor Earl Ray Tomblin awarded $10,500 to the Hampshire County Commission. The cost of the commission's <b>documentation</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> history and significance of the four properties was $15,000, of which the county paid $4,500.|$|E
5|$|Preservation of <b>documentation</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> {{legacy of}} {{residential}} schools was also highlighted {{as part of}} the TRC's Calls to Action.

On April 4, 2016, the Ontario Court of Appeal ruled that documents pertaining to IAP settlements will be destroyed in 15 years if individual claimants do not request to have their documents archived. This decision was fought by the TRC as well as the federal government, but argued for by religious representatives.|$|E

5|$|The Wrestlers is an oil {{painting}} on millboard by English artist William Etty, painted around 1840 and {{currently in the}} York Art Gallery. It depicts a wrestling match between a black man and a white man, both glistening with sweat and under an intense light emphasising their curves and musculature.

5|$|The book on Lappland was {{published}} in 1908, with eleven watercolors by Bauer. They were painted in Stockholm, almost 18 months after his visit, using the photos and sketches he had collected during his journey. Many of the photos resulted in other drawings and paintings. Most of these were romanticized versions of the photos, but he succeeded in capturing the nuances and ambiance of the goahtis, and {{the richness of the}} Sami garments and crafts. Details from the Sami culture, such as the bent knives, shoes, spears, pots and belts, became important elements in the clothes and ornamentations of Bauer's trolls. Bauer's eye for detail and his numerous notes also made the material an ethnographic <b>documentation</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> era.|$|E

A reappraisal of Brescian art of the period, as well as the clear evidence of the style, have led critics to assign to Cairano the execution of the stone parts of the monument, limiting delle Croci's involvement only to the bronze inserts. The jeweller, consequently, assumed the entire Martinengo commission but entrusted the parts outside his competence, most of the monument in fact, to the Cairano studio.|$|E
