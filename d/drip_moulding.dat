25|$|While {{the general}} outline of these {{buildings}}, with steeply pitched roofs, lower chancels and small bellcotes are easily recognisable, the form varies from tiny buildings like St Mark's Greendale, (1848) to the somewhat larger cruciform St Michael's, Wollongong, (1858). Even {{at a church}} as remote as St Mark's, which was surrounded by fields and forest, and had neither village nor full-time priest, {{the details of the}} design commanded Blacket's care, the little building having an elegant gable over its fluted doorway, and floral bosses, long since destroyed, at the ends of its <b>drip</b> <b>moulding.</b>|$|E
25|$|This is {{a mature}} {{work by the}} {{architect}} who retired in 1898. The nave and chancel are combined structurally into one space with four walls, one roof overall, and no columns or aisles. There is a basic porch leading into the nave on the north side. A combined lean-to {{on the south side}} houses the organ chamber and vestry, which share an arched opening into the chancel. The exterior combines a simple Victorian low church aspect using just the basics of Gothic Revival architecture. Thus, apart from two small crosses on the apexes of the roof and porch, there are only two other decorations: the shaped <b>drip</b> <b>moulding</b> over the west window, and the minimal moulding {{at the base of the}} porch archway.|$|E
25|$|The {{third stage}} {{comprises}} the porch, including the west gable parapet wall surmounted by a Latin cross at its apex, the gable parapet {{wall to the}} nave also with a Latin cross, and the tiled roofs of the nave, apse and porch. The porch is {{to the west of}} the nave, its walls also constructed of random rubble with uncoloured concrete block quoins. The western porch facade has a rectangular window with three lights, the outer casements of which open outwards while the central light is fixed. There is a narrow, upright slit in the stone wall above the window. The western facade of the nave has a circular window in-filled with fixed louvers and topped by a stone <b>drip</b> <b>moulding.</b> Both gable parapets have moulded block-work coping. The northern elevation of the porch features a doorway now accessed by a ramp with a bell mounted to the right-hand side of the doorway that is framed in bevelled concrete.|$|E

Each entrance has a pointed arch with expressed <b>drip</b> <b>mould,</b> paired timber panelled doors, and is framed by low engaged columns. Each gable is framed by buttresses crowned by gablets, and the top section of the gable has stone tracery. The northern entrance vestibule has a projecting curved section at the rear. The narthex has two lancets with expressed <b>drip</b> <b>moulds</b> and window surrounds, and is surmounted by a rendered balustrade parapet.

50|$|The front facade, {{which has}} a {{northwest}} aspect, features a central, pointed-arch window with <b>drip</b> <b>moulding,</b> three green glass lights, tracery, and mullions; and gothic arched doorways with stone pediments above, {{on either side of}} the window. Above this is a broad pediment decorated with abbreviated blind panel tracery.|$|E
5000|$|The {{building}} is domestic in scale and concept, yet its original civic function {{is expressed in}} decorative elements such as an arched entrance with <b>drip</b> <b>moulding,</b> quoining to the rectangular windows, and stepped sandstone courses at the gables. A sandstone slab on the front gable bears the inscription [...] "Windsor Shire Council Chambers", with the word [...] "Shire" [...] overwritten by [...] "Town".|$|E
50|$|The Georgian-styled {{rendered}} exterior is scored {{to resemble}} ashlar, and presents a symmetrical front facade to Main Street. Entrances are set back {{at either end}} under small pedimented porticos, and the upper storey of each house features narrow, round-headed windows either side of large French doors. These open onto a small balcony above a projecting ground floor bay. All the second level windows and doors are protected by curved <b>drip</b> <b>moulding</b> and full-length shutters.|$|E
5000|$|The {{tower is}} in two stages, with rendered, {{diagonal}} buttresses with setbacks which rise through parapet as corner pinnacles.

A quatrefoil pierced parapet has gargoyles at the corner. [...] The tower has a peel of 6 bells.|$|R
50|$|In architecture, a hood mould, label mould (from Latin labia, lip), <b>drip</b> <b>mould</b> or dripstone, is an {{external}} moulded projection from a wall over {{an opening to}} throw off rainwater. This moulding can be terminated at the side by ornamentation called a label stop.|$|R

50|$|The local parish church, St Paul's, {{dates from}} the 12th century with the tower being built in 1395. The tower is in two stages, with rendered, {{diagonal}} buttresses with setbacks which rise through parapet as corner pinnacles. A polygonal stair turret at the south east corner rises to a pyramidal cap. The first stage has two 2-light perpendicular west window under a plain <b>drip</b> <b>mould,</b> and similar but smaller window with carved stops to the south. The second stage has one 2-light perpendicular window under a <b>drip</b> <b>mould</b> with carved stops on each side; all louvres except the west which is blank. A quatrefoil pierced parapet has gargoyles at the corner. It has been designated as a Grade I listed building.

50|$|Renaissance {{architectural}} {{styles and}} influences start {{appearing in the}} eastern corners of Wales {{during the reign of}} Queen Elizabeth. In Glamorgan an early example of Renaissance alteration was made to the facade of the outer gatehouse of the now ruined Old Beaupre, near Cowbridge in 1580. This was followed by the more striking Porch in the inner courtyard of 1600 at Old Beaupre.A later and more developed example of Renaissance architecture is Ruperra Castle, built in 1628 for the Welsh soldier Sir Thomas Morgan and the design ideas may originate from his travels on the Continent. The castle is rectangular in layout with round towers at the corners. A feature of Ruperra is the rectangular three light windows with <b>drip</b> <b>moulds,</b> with the centre light higher than the side lights. These windows appear on other Welsh Renaissance houses. The Castle is rectangular with round corner towers and a Porch with a classical doorway. Unfortunately {{as the result of a}} fire in 1941 it now stands partly ruined. In the north-east of Wales a very important surviving Renaissance house was Plas Teg near Mold. Rectangular in form with rectangular corner towers it is the typical form of Renaissance house seen over much of Europe. A close parallel would be the first phase (unfinished) of Drumlanrig Castle in Scotland. Another important Renaissance house, demolished in 1973, was Brymbo Hall near Wrexham. The house was built for John Griffith in 1625 and a Baroque wing was added later in that century. The core of the house was in brick with a fine classical doorway. Fortunately a watercolour by John Ingleby in the National Museum of Wales records this building. A further example of the Renaissance classicism was the Banqueting Hall at Margam Abbey. This was recorded by Thomas Dineley in 1684, but only the stone facade now remains, erected in its present position in 1835. It is three bays wide with fluted Ionic columns carrying richly detailed entablatures.|$|R
