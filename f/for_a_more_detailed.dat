5|$|Geoffrey Chaucer's Troilus and Criseyde {{reflects}} a more humorous world-view than Boccaccio's poem. Chaucer {{does not have}} his own wounded love to display and therefore allows himself an ironic detachment from events and Criseyde is more sympathetically portrayed. In contrast to Boccaccio's final canto, which returns to the poet's own situation, Chaucer's palinode has Troilus looking down laughing from heaven, finally aware of the meaninglessness of earthly emotions. About {{a third of the}} lines of the Troilus are adapted from the much shorter Il Filostrato, leaving room <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>more</b> <b>detailed</b> and characterised narrative.|$|E
5|$|His {{conception}} of 'marvellous reality' {{revolves around the}} natural fantastic qualities of Latin America and the Caribbean, {{as opposed to the}} overly forced and cliché efforts by European surrealists to portray magical occurrences. The result was the presentation of impossible or fantastic events described as if they were completely usual and natural, such as the metamorphoses of Mackandal and Ti Noel. These events, however, often represent the beliefs of other characters in the novel. <b>For</b> <b>a</b> <b>more</b> <b>detailed</b> account of the differences between magic realism and Carpentier's real maravilloso, see the page on magic realism.|$|E

We {{adopt the}} widely used metric {{defined as the}} ratio of the total energy {{consumption}} to the sum flow rates, which represents the amount of energy needed for each unit flow rate. This performance metric is appropriate for designing power efficient wireless networks, which is also the very objective of our article.

In this paper we discuss how to use shared memory on GPUs {{and how does it}} affect the implementation and performance. <b>For</b> <b>a</b> <b>more</b> <b>detail</b> clarification of benefit of using shared memory, we take into account parallel algorithm for calculation of the Walsh spectrum on graphics processor unit (GPU) and its parallel implementation in CUDA C. Using shared memory is a good optimization strategy, which gives faster time of execution of the parallel program...|$|R

From these articles, the definition of different terms like renewable material, recyclable material, biodegradable material, sustainable material and finally natural material were collected. Furthermore, a classification of natural fibre was drawn. One of these natural fibres - the coconut was chosen <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>more</b> <b>detail</b> analysis in mechanical point of view. An integrated method to analyse the sustainability of the coconut fibre as one of the blend components in building construction will be suggested. Finally, several uses of the fibre are reviewed.
