2500|$|Acceleration {{presents}} {{gifted children}} academic material from established curricula that is commensurate with their ability and preparedness, {{and for this}} reason is a low-cost option {{from the perspective of the}} school. This may result in a small number of children taking classes targeted at older children. [...] However, for the majority of gifted students, acceleration is beneficial both academically and socially. [...] "Radical acceleration (acceleration by two or more years) is effective academically and socially for highly gifted students." [...] Some advocates have argued that the disadvantages of being retained in a standard mixed-ability classroom are substantially worse than any shortcomings of acceleration. For example, psychologist Miraca Gross reports: [...] "the majority of these children [...] are socially rejected , isolated, and deeply unhappy. Children of IQ 180+ who are retained <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>regular</b> <b>classroom</b> are even more seriously at risk and experience severe emotional distress." [...] These accelerated children should be placed together in one class if possible. Research suggests that acceleration might have an impact long after students graduate from high school. For example, one study shows that high-IQ individuals who experienced full-grade acceleration earned higher incomes as adults.|$|E

The primary focus {{of this study was}} to examine the attitudes of the population of primary school principals' with regard to the inclusive education practice of placing and educating students with disabilities <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>regular</b> <b>classrooms.</b> <b>In</b> addition, <b>the</b> researcher sought to ascertain principals' perceived barriers and needs with regard to facilitating and implementing inclusive education practices. The survey instruments used to collect data consisted of: a) demographic section, b) Attitude Toward Inclusive Education Scale, c) Opinions Relative to the Integration of Students with Disabilities scale, and d) openended questions. The results suggest that Namibian primary school principals hold positive attitudes toward students with disabilities in general, though they have preferences of the type of disabilities to be accommodated <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>regular</b> <b>classrooms.</b> Students with social difficulties were more favored for inclusion than students with sensory and physical disabilities. Principals favored inclusion of students with behavioral challenges slightly more than students with academic difficulties. Principals' perceptions were that inclusive education has potential benefits for students with and without disabilities and that it presents opportunity for academic growth for students with disabilities. Yet, special school or classroom placement was perceived as the most stable environment for educating students with disabilities, especially when considering their social and emotional development. Furthermore, principals were of the opinion that due to pre-service training, which did not include courses on special education and disabilities, educators lack the needed knowledge, skills, and abilities to educate thesestudents, hence the need for comprehensive in-service. In addition to lack of training in special education as a major barrier, other reported barriers were lack of proper educational facilities and equipment, lack of parent involvement and students' characteristics. The multivariate analysis revealed that younger school principals held more favorable attitudes toward placement of students with disabilities <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>regular</b> <b>classrooms.</b> Principals with graduate degrees and BA/BS perceived themselves as not having the ability to educate these students in comparison to those with lesser qualifications.

40|$|All {{areas of}} {{education}} face changes and challenges constantly. Early childhood education is no exception. A recent challenge teachers face {{in early childhood}} education is the advent of inclusion. Implementing inclusion in early childhood classrooms creates more diversity among the children. Inclusion of students with various disabilities has caused concern among parents and teachers. There are some concerns that need special attention when including students with disabilities <b>in</b> <b>the</b> early childhood classrooms. Reforming public education to accommodate the needs of special education children placed in <b>regular</b> <b>classrooms</b> is a vital issue. For several years there have been arguments concerning the placement {{of children with disabilities}} <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>regular</b> <b>classrooms.</b> When inclusion children are placed <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>regular</b> <b>classrooms</b> <b>the</b> teachers are required to provide individualized instruction for the inclusion children. This may take away the time the teacher have to spend with the other children. The inclusion of children in <b>regular</b> <b>classrooms</b> have been both positive and negative effects. This means, with respect to all stages of the education system, including early childhood, that all children, regardless of their disability, can attend their local educational setting, and have their learning and development needs met through the provision of high-quality care and education For inclusive early childhood education to be successful, early childhood teachers as well as parents and members of the wider community need to embrace and practice inclusion. Parents of children without disabilities may bring with them attitudes and understandings that can lead to social exclusions, restrictions and disadvantages for all children with disabilities and their family in their early childhood setting and neighbourhood community. In this paper, we tried to highlight the attitudes and understandings of some parents of non-disabled children towards the inclusion and teaching of children with disabilities in regular early childhood settings and the consequences that resulted from the exclusionary and inclusionary constructions that these parents took up to define and understand disability and inclusion. We then offer some ideas and strategies for dialogue that may help early childhood teachers appropriately respond to this issue at own capacity...|$|R

40|$|According to research, while {{moderately}} {{gifted students}} can often fit <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>regular</b> <b>classrooms</b> with differentiated instructions, pull-out programs, or acceleration options, highly gifted students do {{better when they}} are grouped with other intellectually-advanced peers {{in accordance with their}} strengths, interests, and background knowledge of a topic. Each of these students requires special attention and management strategies to develop better cognitive, social, emotional, and physical skills. Thanks to the grouping strategy, highly gifted students can study concepts at the appropriate pace, depth, and complexity so that these students feel valued and normal (Neville, 2007; Rogers, 2007). In order to fully meet these students’ needs, creating a school for highly, exceptionally, and profoundly gifted students would be a more beneficial plan compared to requiring them to stay within <b>the</b> <b>regular</b> <b>classroom,</b> accelerating, or grade skipping.

This study revealed critical findings in relation to teachers assessment for children with disabilities, according to the teacher-participants themselves. First, the assessment strategies that teachers employed are based on the diagnostic, formative, and summative purposes of assessment.
