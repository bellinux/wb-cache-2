Then, when I love him, I am his hearing through which he hears, his sight through which he sees, his hand through which he grasps, and his foot through which he walks.|$|E
500|$|In September 2003, Jules Engel, Hillenburg's mentor when {{he studied}} {{experimental}} animation at the California Institute of the Arts, died. Hillenburg dedicated {{the film to}} him: [...] "He truly was the most influential artistic person in my life. I consider <b>him</b> <b>my</b> 'Art Dad.'" ...|$|E
500|$|The {{following}} year, Murphy {{starred in}} Red Lights with Robert De Niro and Sigourney Weaver. He played Tom Buckley, the assistant to Weaver's character {{who is a}} paranormal investigator. [...] Murphy considered working with De Niro to {{have been one of}} the most intimidating moments in his career. He remarked: [...] "My first scene when I come to visit <b>him</b> <b>my</b> character is supposed to be terrified and intimidated. There was no acting involved. The man has presence. You can't act presence. I'll never have that. Watching him use it...when you put a camera on it, it just becomes something else." ...|$|E

60|$|I flung myself before <b>him</b> on <b>my</b> knees, {{and with}} floods of tears besought him to release me from this engagement, assuring <b>him</b> that <b>my</b> cowardice was abject, {{and that in}} every point of intellect and {{character}} I was his hopeless and derisible inferior.|$|R
500|$|After the film's release, Dharma Arthur, a news {{producer}} for WAPT in Jackson, Mississippi, {{wrote a letter}} to Newsweek saying that Borat's appearance on the station had led to her losing her job: [...] "Because of <b>him,</b> <b>my</b> boss lost faith in my abilities and second-guessed everything I did thereafter … How upsetting that a man who leaves so much harm in his path is lauded as a comedic genius." [...] Although Arthur has said she was fired from the show, she told the Associated Press that she left the station. She said that she checked a public relations website that Borat's producers gave her before booking him.|$|E
500|$|The {{death of}} her eldest son, Prince Albert Victor, Duke of Clarence and Avondale, in 1892 was a serious blow to Alexandra. His room and {{possessions}} were kept exactly as he had left them, much as those of Prince Albert were left {{after his death in}} 1861. She said, [...] "I have buried my angel and with <b>him</b> <b>my</b> happiness." [...] Surviving letters between Alexandra and her children indicate that they were mutually devoted. In 1894, her brother-in-law Alexander III of Russia died and her nephew Nicholas II of Russia became Tsar. Alexandra's widowed sister, the Dowager Empress, leant heavily on her for support; Alexandra slept, prayed, and stayed beside her sister {{for the next two weeks}} until Alexander's burial.|$|E
500|$|Stephen Thomas Erlewine, {{senior editor}} of AllMusic, called My Love: Essential Collection an {{overcompensation}} for how All the Way... A Decade of Song (1999), concentrated on newer recordings {{at the expense of}} hits. According to <b>him,</b> <b>My</b> Love: Essential Collection [...] "fits the bill well" [...] for those listeners who are looking for an overview of Celine Dion's two decades as an international superstar, as it has all her big adult contemporary hits. Erlewine also noted that although Dion has had more hits in the ten years since All the Way... A Decade of Song, apart from her cover of Roy Orbison's [...] "I Drove All Night", almost none of her new-millennium hits are as memorable as her singles from the '90s.|$|E

500|$|On September 23, 2010, rapper Q-Tip {{confirmed}} {{working on}} Jay-Z's twelfth [...] studio album, with a tentative release in 2011. By May 2012, reports arose {{that he was}} working on new music with Roc Nation producer Jahlil Beats. In an interview with XXL, Beats stated: [...] "Me and Jay-Z been going back and forth. He picked a couple of my joints that he's working on. I don't even wanna say too much about Jay, but we definitely working on some stuff. I haven't even sent him a bunch of beats. I sent <b>him</b> <b>my</b> favorite stuff. He hit me right back like, 'Yo, I'ma go in on this,' or, 'I like this.'" [...] The album development was kept a secret, but The-Dream hinted about a new Jay-Z album in an April 2013 interview with Hot 97.|$|E
500|$|Accepting the nomination, Lincoln {{delivered}} his House Divided Speech, drawing on , [...] "A house divided against itself cannot stand. I believe this government cannot endure permanently half slave and half free. I {{do not expect}} the Union to be dissolved—I do not expect the house to fall—but I do expect it will cease to be divided. It will become all one thing, or all the other." [...] The speech created an evocative image {{of the danger of}} disunion caused by the slavery debate, and rallied Republicans across the North. The stage was then set for the campaign for statewide election of the Illinois legislature which would, in turn, select Lincoln or Douglas as its U.S. senator. On being informed of Lincoln's nomination, Douglas stated [...] " [...] is the strong man of the party...and if I beat <b>him,</b> <b>my</b> victory will be hardly won." ...|$|E
500|$|Shanina's {{personal}} life was thwarted by war. On 10 October 1944, {{she wrote in}} her diary, [...] "I can't accept that Misha Panarin doesn't live anymore. What a good guy! [...] has been killed... He loved me, I know, and I <b>him...</b> <b>My</b> heart is heavy, I'm twenty, but I have no close [...] friend". In November 1944, Shanina wrote that she [...] "is flogging into her head that [...] loves" [...] a man named Nikolai, although he [...] "doesn't shine in upbringing and education". In the same entry she wrote {{that she did not}} think about marriage because [...] "it's not the time now". She later wrote that she [...] "had it out" [...] with Nikolai and [...] "wrote him a note in the sense of 'but I'm given to the one and will love no other one". Ultimately in her last diary record, filled with sombre tones, Shanina wrote that she [...] "cannot find a solace" [...] now and is [...] "of no use to anyone".|$|E

Edward Brady, the {{battalion}} commander, in a statement. “I’ve {{spent more time with}} <b>him</b> than <b>my</b> wife since I’ve taken command.

500|$|Villeneuve {{went into}} lap 48 {{less than a}} second behind Schumacher. Partway through the lap he {{attempted}} to overtake Schumacher at the Dry Sack corner. Braking later than Schumacher, Villeneuve held the inside line and was ahead on the track when Schumacher turned in on him resulting in a collision. ITV's then pit lane reporter James Allen has noted that onboard footage shows Schumacher twitching his steering wheel left before turning right into Villeneuve. Martin Brundle, in the commentary box alongside Murray Walker, immediately saw that Schumacher's move had been deliberate, saying, [...] "That didn't work Michael. You hit the wrong part of <b>him,</b> <b>my</b> friend". The right-front wheel of Schumacher's Ferrari hit the left radiator pod of Villeneuve's Williams—unlike the 1994 collision with Hill where Schumacher inflicted damage on Hill's suspension—and caused Schumacher to retire. Villeneuve described the incident after the race [...] "The car felt very strange. The hit was very hard. It was not a small thing." [...] He continued but the damage to his car meant he was slower than the cars behind him.|$|E
500|$|Over {{the next}} few days, Garfield made some improvement, as the nation viewed the news from the capital and prayed. Although he never stood again, {{he was able to}} sit up and write several times, and his {{recovery}} was viewed so positively that a steamer was fitted out as a seagoing hospital to aid with his convalescence. [...] He was nourished on oatmeal porridge (which he detested) and milk from a cow on the White House lawn. When told that Indian chief Sitting Bull, a prisoner of the army, was starving, Garfield said, [...] "Let him starve," [...] then, [...] "Oh, no, send <b>him</b> <b>my</b> oatmeal." [...] X-radiation (or X-ray) usage, which likely would have helped the president's physicians determine exactly where the bullet was lodged in his body, would not be invented for another fourteen years. [...] Alexander Graham Bell tried to locate the bullet with a primitive metal detector; he was not successful. One means of keeping the president comfortable in Washington's summer heat {{was one of the first}} successful air conditioning units: air that was propelled by fans over ice and then dried had reduced the temperature in the sickroom by 20 degrees Fahrenheit (11 degrees Celsius).|$|E
500|$|Murphy {{became a}} {{national}} celebrity following his World War II military service when Life magazine proclaimed him America's [...] "most decorated soldier" [...] in its 16 July 1945 issue cover story. That magazine cover {{brought him to the}} attention of veteran actor James Cagney who invited him to Hollywood. When Murphy arrived in California after his military discharge, Cagney cancelled the hotel reservations he'd made for Murphy and instead took him into his own home, [...] "I got the shock of my life. Audie was very thin. His complexion was bluish-gray." [...] Commenting years later on his first impression, Cagney said, [...] " [...] in such a nervous condition that I was afraid he might jump out of a window. I took him home and gave <b>him</b> <b>my</b> bed." [...] He spent three weeks as a guest of Cagney and then returned to Texas before finally agreeing to an offer from brothers James and William Cagney of $150 a week as a contract player with their production company. The Cagneys gave Murphy personal attention on acting techniques. He also took lessons at the Actors' Lab on Sunset Boulevard. Murphy studied voice techniques, learned judo, and trained with choreographer John Boyle, Cagney's dance coach for Yankee Doodle Dandy. A 1947 disagreement with William Cagney ended his association with the brothers without having been cast in a film production.|$|E

500|$|After [...] "Freakshow" [...] is Blackouts eight track, [...] "Toy Soldier", a R and dance-pop song {{reminiscent}} of Destiny's Child's song [...] "Lose My Breath" [...] (2004) that showcases a military drumroll and Spears singing about needing a new lover. In [...] "Hot as Ice", a R song featuring background vocals by T-Pain, she sings {{in a higher}} register: [...] "I'm just a girl {{with the ability to}} drive a man crazy / Make him call me 'mama', make <b>him</b> <b>my</b> new baby." [...] Blackouts tenth track [...] "Ooh Ooh Baby" [...] contains a flamenco guitar and blends the beat from Gary Glitter's [...] "Rock and Roll" [...] (1972) and the melody of The Turtles' [...] "Happy Together" [...] (1967). In the lyrics, she sings to a lover [...] "Touch me and I come alive / I can feel you on my lips / I can feel you deep inside". Kara DioGuardi said she was inspired by the relationship between Spears and her first son in the studio, saying: [...] "I would look at the two of them, the way {{they looked at each other}} and the way she would hold the baby. It kind of struck me as interesting. At times it'd be about a kid at times about a lover." [...] "Perfect Lover", an R song, has a propulsive, clattery belly-dance beat in which Spears sings lyrics such as [...] "Tick-tock / Tick-tock / Come and get me while I'm hot". The twelfth track is [...] "Why Should I Be Sad", a midtempo R song directed to her ex-husband Kevin Federline. One of the bonus tracks, [...] "Everybody", samples Eurythmics' [...] "Sweet Dreams (Are Made of This)" [...] (1983). It features Spears singing about the dancefloor in a breathy lower register.|$|E

2500|$|On 18 June 2014, Davidson {{attended}} the assault trial of former N-Dubz singer Dappy. [...] "Dappy {{is a good}} friend of mine.

2500|$|In 1815 the Roman Catholic Church in Paraguay was {{declared}} independent of both Buenos Aires and Rome. Francia seized ecclesiastical properties, and appointed himself {{head of the}} Paraguayan Church (reminiscent of Henry VIII declaring himself Supreme Head of the Church of England). Pope Pius VII excommunicated him for doing so; Francia's reply on hearing this was: [...] "If the Holy Father himself should come to Paraguay I would make <b>him</b> <b>my</b> private chaplain." ...|$|E
