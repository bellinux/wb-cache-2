40|$|International audienceThis work {{describes}} some {{consequences of}} paternal germ cell DNA {{damage on the}} reproduction success in two fish species. Male brown trout (n = 31) and male Arctic charr (n = 28) {{were exposed to the}} model genotoxicant MMS at the end of spermatogenesis to generate a significant DNA damage level in mature spermatozoa (28 % and 25 % tail DNA in trout and charr sperm, respectively, evaluated through the comet assay). Sperm from each MMS exposed and control fish was then used to fertilize in vitro an aliquot of a single pool of eggs collected from 4 unexposed females for each species. Each batch of fertilized eggs was monitored individually in the hatchery to follow embryonic and larval abnormalities during the fry development. Paternal exposure did not influence fertilization rate or survival rate at hatching in either species. However, MMS paternal treatment resulted in a large array of <b>morphological</b> <b>abnormalities</b> during embryonic and larval development. At the eyed stage, malformations exhibited a 8 fold increase in trout and a 2 fold increase in charr for larvae stemming from MMS treated males as compared with controls. At the end of yolk sac resorption, an increase in the <b>gross</b> <b>morphological</b> <b>abnormality</b> incidence was found in trout larvae originating from MMS exposed males (2. 10 % vs. 0. 93 % in control, p < 0. 05). When looking more in detail at bony structures after Alizarin red S staining, a 20 % incidence of skeletal defects was recorded at the swimming stage. A positive correlation was found between the paternal sperm DNA damage level and the skeletal abnormality incidence of its progeny. During the next 2 months of development, mortality in trout originating from DNA damaged sperm was 3 times higher than in control. After one year, no effect of paternal treatment was found on growth traits (length and weight) but the <b>gross</b> <b>morphological</b> <b>abnormality</b> incidence was still very high in the treated group (27 % malformation incidence vs. 0. 5 % in control). These results demonstrate ecologically relevant consequences of fish spermatozoa DNA damage and stress the value of using this parameter as a biomarker signaling potential long term effects of environmental genotoxins in aquatic systems...|$|R

Elevated expression of HIF- 1 alpha has been reported to be associated with tumor progression, invasion and metastasis in many cancers. To investigate the role of HIF- 1 alpha in tumor development and metastasis, we established transgenic mice constitutively expressing HIF 1 A gene under regulation of the cytomegalovirus gene promoter. Although HIF- 1 alpha protein levels varied among organs, expression of HIF 1 A mRNA in most organs gradually increased in an age-dependent manner. The transgenic mice showed no <b>gross</b> <b>morphological</b> <b>abnormality</b> up to 8 weeks after birth, although they subsequently developed tumors in the lymphoid, lung, and breast; the most prominent tumor was lymphoma appearing in the intestinal mucosa and intra-mesenchymal tissues. The prevalence of tumors reached 80 % in 13 months after birth. The constitution of lymphocyte populations in the transgenic mice did not differ from that in wild-type mice. However, lymphocytes of the transgenic mice revealed prolonged survival under long-term culture conditions and revealed increased resistance to cytotoxic etoposide.

Here {{we conducted a}} GWAS meta-analysis among 63, 558 participants of European descent, initially from 16 cohorts with serial kidney function measurements within the CKDGen Consortium, followed by independent replication among additional participants from 13 cohorts. In stage 1 GWAS meta-analysis, single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) at MEOX 2, GALNT 11, IL 1 RAP, NPPA, HPCAL 1, and CDH 23 showed the strongest associations {{for at least one}} trait, in addition to the known UMOD locus, which showed genome-wide significance with an annual change in eGFR. In stage 2 meta-analysis, the significant association at UMOD was replicated. Associations at GALNT 11 with Rapid Decline (annual eGFR decline of 3 [*]ml/min per 1. 73 [*]m(2) or more), and CDH 23 with eGFR change among those with CKD showed significant suggestive evidence of replication. Combined stage 1 and 2 meta-analyses showed significance for UMOD, GALNT 11, and CDH 23. Morpholino knockdowns of galnt 11 and cdh 23 in zebrafish embryos each had signs of severe edema 72 [*]h after gentamicin treatment compared with controls, but no <b>gross</b> <b>morphological</b> renal <b>abnormalities</b> before gentamicin administration.

40|$|Natural populations carry {{deleterious}} recessive alleles {{which cause}} inbreeding depression. We compared mortality {{and growth of}} inbred and outbred zebrafish, Danio rerio, between 6 and 48 days of age. Grandparents of the studied fish {{were caught in the}} wild. Inbred fish were generated by brother-sister mating. Mortality was 9 % in outbred fish, and 42 % in inbred fish, which implies at least 3. 6 lethal equivalents of deleterious recessive alleles per zygote. There was no significant inbreeding depression in the growth, perhaps because the surviving inbred fish lived under less crowded conditions. In contrast to alleles that cause embryonic and early larval mortality in the same population, alleles responsible for late larval and early juvenile mortality did not result in any <b>gross</b> <b>morphological</b> <b>abnormalities.</b> Thus, deleterious recessive alleles that segregate in a wild zebrafish population belong to two sharply distinct classes: early-acting, morphologically overt, unconditional lethals; and later-acting, morphologically cryptic, and presumably milder alleles...|$|E

40|$|Nonresolving {{inflammatory}} processes {{affect all}} stages of carcinogenesis. Lactoferrin, {{a member of the}} transferrin family, is involved in the innate immune response and anti-inflammatory, anti-microbial, and anti-tumor activities. We previously found that lactoferrin is significantly down-regulated in specimens of nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC) and negatively associated with tumor progression, metastasis, and prognosis of patients with NPC. Additionally, lactoferrin expression levels are decreased in colorectal cancer as compared with normal tissue. Lactoferrin levels are also increased in the various phases of inflammation and dysplasia in an azoxymethane–dextran sulfate sodium (AOM-DSS) model of colitis-associated colon cancer (CAC). We thus hypothesized that the anti-inflammatory function of lactoferrin may contribute to its anti-tumor activity.

To assess whether there might be any rational basis for such a measure we have undertaken morphological and biochemical studies of the jejunal mucosa in 14 patients with multiple sclerosis. All were found to have morphologically normal villi, and quantitative estimation of surface-to-volume ratios gave values which did not differ from control subjects.

40|$|AbstractThe Drosophila eggshell is {{a highly}} {{specialized}} extracellular matrix that forms between the oocyte and the surrounding epithelial follicle cells during late oogenesis. The dec- 1 gene, which is required for proper eggshell assembly, produces three proproteins that are cleaved within the vitelline membrane layer to multiple derivatives. The different spatial distributions of the cleaved derivatives suggest that they play distinct roles in eggshell assembly. Using extant dec- 1 mutations in conjunction with genetically engineered dec- 1 transgenes, we show that, although all three dec- 1 proproteins, fc 106, fc 125, and fc 177, are required for female fertility, <b>gross</b> <b>morphological</b> <b>abnormalities</b> in the eggshell are observed only {{in the absence of}} fc 177. The coalescence of the roof, pillar, and floor substructures of the tripartite endochorion suggested that quantitatively minor fc 177 derivatives are necessary to prevent ectopic aggregation of endochorion proteins during the assembly process.

40|$|The {{vertebrate}} nucleopore complex (NPC) is a 125 MDa multiprotein assembly that mediates nucleocytoplasmic transport. One of its components, CAN/Nup 214, is an FXFG repeat-containing protein {{known to}} be involved in myeloid leukemia in humans. We have devised a powerful genetic approach, using maternally derived protein in murine null embryos, to show that CAN/ Nup 214 is essential for NPC function in vivo. We demonstrate that CAN-/- mouse embryonic stem (ES) cells are not viable and that CAN-/- embryos die in utero between 4. 0 and 4. 5 days postcoitum, following the depletion of their CAN from maternal sources. In 3. 5 -day-old mutant embryos, cultured in vitro, progressive depletion of CAN leads to cell cycle arrest in G 2 phase, and eventually to blastocoel collapse, impaired NLS-mediated protein uptake and nuclear accumulation of polyadenylated RNA. Remarkably, these defective CAN-depleted embryos do not display any <b>gross</b> <b>morphological</b> <b>abnormalities</b> in their nuclear envelopes or NPCs.

Such tumor predisposition syndromes can {{be recognized by}} specific patterns of <b>morphological</b> <b>abnormalities.</b> Objectives To assess the prevalence of <b>morphological</b> <b>abnormalities</b> in a large cohort of patients with childhood cancer and to identify new tumor predisposition syndromes. Design, Setting, and Participants Patients were recruited from Emma Children's Hospital, Academic Medical Center, Amsterdam, the Netherlands, between January 2000 and March 2003. A total of 1073 patients underwent a physical examination directed at 683 <b>morphological</b> <b>abnormalities.</b> The patient cohort consisted of 898 long-term survivors of childhood cancer and 175 newly diagnosed pediatric patients with cancer. The control group consisted of 1007 schoolchildren examined in an identical way. Mean ages of patients and controls were 21. 2 and 10. 4 years, respectively. Main Outcome Measures Prevalence and patterns of <b>morphological</b> <b>abnormalities</b> in patients compared with controls. To prevent age bias, only age-independent abnormalities were used for overall prevalence analysis. Patients younger than 9 years {{were excluded from the}} pattern analysis. The sample was restricted to white patients to prevent ethnicity bias. Results <b>Morphological</b> <b>abnormalities</b> were significantly more prevalent in pediatric patients with cancer. Major abnormalities were present in 26. 8 % of patients vs 15. 5 % of controls (P <. 001) and minor anomalies in 65. 1 % of patients vs 56. 2 % of controls (P <. 001). Three or more minor anomalies were detected in 15. 2 % of patients vs 8. 3 % in controls (P <. 001). Forty-two patients were diagnosed with an established tumor predisposition syndrome. Multivariate analyses showed 14 <b>morphological</b> <b>abnormalities</b> to occur significantly more often in the patient group. For 2 of these (blepharophimosis and asymmetric lower limbs), we identified statistically significant patterns of co-occurring <b>morphological</b> <b>abnormalities</b> suggestive of new tumor predisposition syndromes. Thirty-four patients fit 1 of the 2 novel tumor predisposition patterns. Conclusions Pediatric patients with cancer show a significantly higher prevalence of <b>morphological</b> <b>abnormalities</b> compared with controls.

We previously reported on the loss of NXF 5 in a male patient with a syndromic form of intellectual disability. To study the functional role of NXF 5 we identified the mouse counterpart. Based on synteny, mouse Nxf 2 is the ortholog of human NXF 5. However, we provide several lines of evidence that mouse Nxf 7 is the actual functional equivalent of NXF 5. Both Nxf 7 and NXF 5 are predominantly expressed in the brain, show cytoplasmic localization, and present as granules in neuronal dendrites suggesting a role in cytoplasmic mRNA metabolism in neurons. Nxf 7 was primarily detected in the pyramidal cells of the hippocampus and in layer V of the cortex. Similar to human NXF 2, mouse Nxf 2 is highly expressed in testis and shows a nuclear localization. Interestingly, these findings point to a different evolutionary path for both NXF genes in human and mouse. We thus generated and validated Nxf 7 knockout mice, which were fertile and did not present any <b>gross</b> anatomical or <b>morphological</b> <b>abnormalities.</b> Expression profiling in the hippocampus and the cortex did not reveal significant changes between wild-type and Nxf 7 knockout mice.

We isolated the full-length cDNA sequence from Lytechinus variegatus and utilized morpholinos to further investigate the role of Endo 16 during embryonic development in this species. Endo 16 -deficient embryos failed to undergo gastrulation and the blastocoele became filled with dissociated cells after 24 h of incubation. Moreover, there was a delay in endoderm differentiation as assayed by staining with an antibody that recognizes Endo 1. The differentiation of other cell types including oral ectoderm, primary mesenchymal cells (PMC) and secondary mesenchymal cells (SMC) appeared to be normal, although the patterns of protein expression did not resemble control embryos due to the <b>gross</b> <b>morphological</b> <b>abnormalities</b> elicited by the LvEndo 16 morpholino.

40|$|The {{premature}} human aging Werner syndrome (WS) {{is caused}} by mutation of the RecQ-family WRN helicase, which is unique in possessing also 3 '- 5 ' exonuclease activity. WS patients show significant genomic instability with elevated cancer incidence. WRN is implicated in restraining illegitimate recombination, especially during DNA replication. Here we identify a Drosophila ortholog of the WRN exonuclease encoded by the CG 7670 locus. The predicted DmWRNexo protein shows conservation of structural motifs and key catalytic residues with human WRN exonuclease, but entirely lacks a helicase domain. Insertion of a piggyBac element into the 5 ' UTR of CG 7670 severely reduces gene expression. DmWRNexo mutant flies homozygous for this insertional allele of CG 7670 are thus severely hypomorphic; although adults show no <b>gross</b> <b>morphological</b> <b>abnormalities,</b> females are sterile. Like human WS cells, we show that the DmWRNexo mutant flies are hypersensitive to the topoisomerase I inhibitor camptothecin. Furthermore, these mutant flies show highly elevated rates of mitotic DNA recombination resulting from excessive reciprocal exchange. This study identifies a novel WRN ortholog in flies and demonstrates an important role for WRN exonuclease in maintaining genome stability...|$|E
40|$|CD 63 is {{a member}} of the tetraspanin {{superfamily}} that constitutes a main component of the lysosomal membrane. In mice, two CD 63 gene loci are present, with only one of these two being functional. We generated and analyzed mice deficient for active CD 63. Disruption of CD 63 results in a complete loss of CD 63 protein expression. Despite its abundance in late endosomes/lysosomes, the lack of CD 63 does not cause obvious endosomal/lysosomal abnormalities. CD 63 knockout mice are viable and fertile without <b>gross</b> <b>morphological</b> <b>abnormalities</b> in the majority of tissues. No alterations in the populations of immune cells and only minor differences in platelet function were observed. This suggests that the lack of CD 63 could be successfully compensated for, most likely by other tetraspanins. However, CD 63 deficiency leads to an altered water balance. CD 63 knockout mice show an increased urinary flow, water intake, reduced urine osmolality, and a higher fecal water content. In principle cells of the collecting duct of CD 63 -deficient mice, abnormal intracellular lamellar inclusions were observed. This indicates that the sorting of apical transport proteins might be impaired in these cells.

50|$|Many {{knock-outs}} {{have been}} made in the apoptosis pathways to test the function of each of the proteins. Several caspases, in addition to APAF-1 and FADD, have been mutated to determine the new phenotype. In order to create a tumor necrosis factor (TNF) knockout, an exon containing the nucleotides 3704-5364 was removed from the gene. This exon encodes a portion of the mature TNF domain, as well as the leader sequence, which is a highly conserved region necessary for proper intracellular processing. TNF-/- mice develop normally and have no <b>gross</b> structural or <b>morphological</b> <b>abnormalities.</b> However, upon immunization with SRBC (sheep red blood cells), these mice demonstrated a deficiency in the maturation of an antibody response; they were able to generate normal levels of IgM, but could not develop specific IgG levels. Apaf-1 is the protein that turns on caspase 9 by cleavage to begin the caspase cascade that leads to apoptosis. Since a -/- mutation in the APAF-1 gene is embryonic lethal, a gene trap strategy was used in order to generate an APAF-1 -/- mouse. This assay is used to disrupt gene function by creating an intragenic gene fusion. When an APAF-1 gene trap is introduced into cells, many morphological changes occur, such as spina bifida, the persistence of interdigital webs, and open brain. In addition, after embryonic day 12.5, the brain of the embryos showed several structural changes. APAF-1 cells are protected from apoptosis stimuli such as irradiation. A BAX-1 knock-out mouse exhibits normal forebrain formation and a decreased programmed cell death in some neuronal populations and in the spinal cord, leading to an increase in motor neurons.|$|R

[...] A BAX-1 knock-out mouse exhibits normal forebrain formation and a decreased programmed cell death in some neuronal populations and in the spinal cord, leading to an increase in motor neurons.|$|R

There was not a fixed pattern of the malformations, which varied in gravity, and could affect the postanal spines or terminal claws.

40|$|Hutchinson-Gilford {{progeria}} syndrome (HGPS) is {{an accelerated}} aging disorder caused by mutations in LMNA leading to {{expression of a}} truncated prelamin A variant termed progerin. Whereas a farnesylated polypeptide is normally removed from the carboxyl-terminus of prelamin A during endoproteolytic processing to lamin A, progerin lacks the cleavage site and remains farnesylated. Cultured cells from human subjects with HGPS and genetically modified mice expressing progerin have nuclear <b>morphological</b> <b>abnormalities,</b> which are reversed by inhibitors of protein farnesylation. In addition, treatment with protein farnesyltransferase inhibitors improves whole animal phenotypes in mouse models of HGPS. However, improvement in nuclear morphology in tissues after treatment of animals has not been demonstrated. We therefore treated transgenic mice that express progerin in epidermis with the protein farnesyltransferase inhibitor FTI- 276 {{or a combination of}} pravastatin and zoledronate to determine if they reversed nuclear <b>morphological</b> <b>abnormalities</b> in tissue. Immunofluorescence microscopy and “blinded” electron microscopic analysis demonstrated that systemic administration of FTI- 276 or pravastatin plus zoledronate significantly improved nuclear <b>morphological</b> <b>abnormalities</b> in keratinocytes of transgenic mice. These results show that pharmacological blockade of protein prenylation reverses nuclear <b>morphological</b> <b>abnormalities</b> that occur in HGPS in vivo. They further suggest that skin biopsy may be useful to determine if protein farnesylation inhibitors are exerting effects in subjects with HGPS in clinical trials...|$|R
40|$|International audienceMammalian sialidase Neu 4, ubiquitously {{expressed}} in human tissues, {{is located in}} the lysosomal and mitochondrial lumen and has broad substrate specificity against sialylated glycoconjugates. To investigate whether Neu 4 is involved in ganglioside catabolism, we transfected beta-hexosaminidase-deficient neuroglia cells from a Tay-Sachs patient with a Neu 4 -expressing plasmid and demonstrated the correction of storage due to the clearance of accumulated GM 2 ganglioside. To further clarify the biological role of Neu 4, we have generated a stable loss-of-function phenotype in cultured HeLa cells and in mice with targeted disruption of the Neu 4 gene. The silenced HeLa cells showed reduced activity against gangliosides and had large heterogeneous lysosomes containing lamellar structures. Neu 4 (-/-) mice were viable, fertile and lacked <b>gross</b> <b>morphological</b> <b>abnormalities,</b> but showed a marked vacuolization and lysosomal storage in lung and spleen cells. Lysosomal storage bodies were also present in cultured macrophages preloaded with gangliosides. Thin-layer chromatography showed increased relative level of GD 1 a ganglioside and a markedly decreased level of GM 1 ganglioside in brain of Neu 4 (-/-) mice suggesting that Neu 4 may be important for desialylation of brain gangliosides and consistent with the in situ hybridization data. Increased levels of cholesterol, ceramide and polyunsaturated fatty acids were also detected in the lungs and spleen of Neu 4 (-/-) mice by high-resolution NMR spectroscopy. Together, our data suggest that Neu 4 is a functional component of the ganglioside-metabolizing system, contributing to the postnatal development of the brain and other vital organs...|$|E
40|$|Alterations {{in nuclear}} {{morphology}} {{are common in}} cancer progression. However, {{the degree to which}} <b>gross</b> <b>morphological</b> <b>abnormalities</b> translate into compromised higher-order chromatin organization is poorly understood. To explore the functional links between gene expression and chromatin structure in breast cancer, we performed RNA-seq gene expression analysis on the basal breast cancer progression model based on human MCF 10 A cells. Positional gene enrichment identified the major histone gene cluster at chromosome 6 p 22 {{as one of the most}} significantly upregulated (and not amplified) clusters of genes from the normal-like MCF 10 A to premalignant MCF 10 AT 1 and metastatic MCF 10 CA 1 a cells. This cluster is subdivided into three sub-clusters of histone genes that are organized into hierarchical topologically associating domains (TADs). Interestingly, the sub-clusters of histone genes are located at TAD boundaries and interact more frequently with each other than the regions in-between them, suggesting that the histone sub-clusters form an active chromatin hub. The anchor sites of loops within this hub are occupied by CTCF, a known chromatin organizer. These histone genes are transcribed and processed at a specific sub-nuclear microenvironment termed the major histone locus body (HLB). While the overall chromatin structure of the major HLB is maintained across breast cancer progression, we detected alterations in its structure that may relate to gene expression. Importantly, breast tumor specimens also exhibit a coordinate pattern of upregulation across the major histone gene cluster. Our results provide a novel insight into the connection between the higher-order chromatin organization of the major HLB and its regulation during breast cancer progression...|$|E
40|$|Previously, we have {{demonstrated}} that mRNA expression of endothelin- 1 (ET- 1), a potent vasoconstrictor, is induced in astrocytes and endothelial cells after ischemic conditions, suggesting that both of these cells synthesize ET- 1 under this stress condition. Furthermore, ET- 1 protected primary cultured astrocytes from ischemic stress. In order to further investigate the role of endothelial ET- 1 in cerebral ischemic injury, transgenic mouse lines (TET) with a transgene that included ET cDNA with SV 40 polyA under tyrosine kinase with immunoglobulin and epidermal growth factor homology domain (Tie- 1) promoter were used. TET mouse lines were further characterized for ET- 1 over-expression in the brain. The reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) analysis using the primers specific for transgene ET- 1 showed that transgene ET- 1 is only expressed in the brain from TET mice. Total expression of ET- 1 mRNA was also increased in the transgenic brain compared with the non-transgenic brain by semi-quantitative RT-PCR. In situ hybridization and immunocytochemical analyses showed that the increased ET- 1 mRNA and peptide expressions were detected in endothelial cells of cerebral vessels of TET mice. Under normal conditions, the TET mice that have a slightly increased blood pressure {{compared with that of}} non-transgenic mice showed no <b>gross</b> <b>morphological</b> <b>abnormalities</b> in the brain. However, after transient middle cerebral artery occlusion, TET mice showed a more severe neurological deficit, and larger infarct size and volume, suggesting that over-expressing ET- 1 in endothelial cells is deleterious to neuronal survival under ischemic conditions. Our present TET model will serve as an ideal model for studying the role of endothelial ET- 1 in the pathogenesis of ischemic stroke. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|E

40|$|Cannabis use {{disorders}} (CUDs) affect 13. {{1 million}} individuals worldwide. Brain morphology specific to CUDs may mediate the adverse behavioral outcomes of CUDs. We reviewed findings from 20 human neuroimaging studies on grey and white matter morphology in cannabis users that specifically included CUD assessments. There is evidence for CUD-specific <b>morphological</b> <b>abnormalities</b> within the striatum, medial temporal lobe, prefrontal cortex, cerebellum, and corpus callosum. Factors that may aggravate <b>morphological</b> <b>abnormalities</b> associated with CUDs include earlier onset age, higher lifetime exposure, and CUD-associated problems, while abstinence {{may result in}} (partial) recovery. These observations suggest that the neural substrates of compulsive cannabis use (e. g., striatum) may be distinct from those linked to cannabinoid exposure (e. g., hippocampus). The lack of studies examining individuals with a diagnosed CUD prevents drawing strong conclusions on CUD-specific <b>morphological</b> <b>abnormalities.</b> Comparing cannabis users with and without CUD is essential to delineate the neurobiology and inform new treatment strategies...|$|R
