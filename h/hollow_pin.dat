50|$|For {{portable}} 1 litre bottles, {{the head}} of the siphon bottle is removed for filling. A rubber seal and tube are also removed. Then about 1 litre of very cold water is added to the bottle; the bottle is not completely filled. The rubber seal, tube, and head are then reassembled. An 8-gram CO2 charger is inserted and securely screwed into a port in the head; the port has a conical seal and a <b>hollow</b> <b>pin</b> that pierces the charger and lets the gas into the bottle. When the sound of the gas bubbling into the water is heard, the bottle is shaken, then left to rest. Within seconds, the trigger pull will release seltzer water.|$|E

One dimensional (1 D) diffraction gratings and two dimensional (2 D) photonic crystals (PCs) are considered as particular types of inhomogeneous media with spatial periodicity. A few application oriented items are presented as a result of computations on the basis of transfer relations, regarding 2 D PCs as a stack of 1 D diffraction gratings and applying technique of matrix Riccati equation. Two first items are 2 D PCs and <b>hollow</b> <b>pin</b> structure. The last two items are two methods of optical monitoring.

40|$|There {{is growing}} {{interest}} {{in the use of}} cryosurgical treatment for the ablation of cancerous and diseased tissue. This thesis describes experimental and numerical investigation of the thermoelectric devices to be utilized in development of the cryosurgical probe for generating freezing and rewarming temperature required for tissue ablation. Thermoelectric cooling devices were used in this research due to being compact, noiseless with no moving parts and no circulating refrigerant. A novel three-dimensional model of human living tissue including metabolic heat, perfusion of blood and variation of tissue properties with temperature has been developed to determine thermal behaviour of tissue during cryosurgery process and predict the cooling requirement of the cryosurgical probe using COMSOL Multiphysics 5. 2 software. COMSOL Multiphysics was used {{for the first time to}} develop three dimensional model of single stage and multistage thermoelectric devices and to predict the temperature difference across the thermoelectric modules at different input of electrical power. It is concluded that three stage thermoelectric module is capable of generating the temperature of the 213 K for cancer tissue ablation. The laboratory prototype of the cryosurgical probe was developed to investigate the performance of three stage thermoelectric device and the minimum temperature of the approximately 240 K were achieved in the experimental test. A circular <b>hollow</b> <b>pin</b> fin with lower thermal resistance was developed in SolidWorks flow simulation 2015 software and introduced as a suitable heat exchanger to be used in the laboratory prototype. ...|$|E

40|$|Induced tissue {{regeneration}} around percutaneous medical implants {{could be}} a useful method to prevent {{the failure of the}} medical device, especially when the epidermal seal around the implant is disrupted and the implant must be maintained {{over a long period of}} time. In this manuscript, a novel concept and technique is introduced in which autologous keratinocytes were delivered to the interfacial area of a skin-implant using the hollow interior of a fixator pin as a conduit. Full thickness human skin explants discarded from surgeries were cultured at the air-liquid interface and were punctured to fit at the bottom of hollow cylindrical stainless steel fixator pins. Autologous keratinocytes, previously extracted from the same piece of skin and cultured separately, were delivered to the specimens thorough the interior of the <b>hollow</b> <b>pins.</b> The delivered cells survived the process and resembled undifferentiated epithelium, with variations in size and shape. Viability was demonstrated by the lack of morphologic evidence of necrosis or apoptosis. Although the cells did not form organized epithelial structures, differentiation toward a keratinocyte phenotype was evident immunohistochemically. These results suggest that an adaptation of this technique could be useful for the treatment of complications arising from the contact between skin and percutaneous devices in vivo...|$|R

50|$|More {{recently}} in 2011/12 was {{the addition of}} a Picatinny rail to the frame under the barrel as standard on all models whose number ends in R. The major difference in slide design, between the older model SIG pistols and the current production, is that the older model slides were stamped whereas the current production models are milled on a CNC machine. The stamped models have an end piece at the muzzle end which is welded in place, to complete the slide. Additionally, the older stamped slides feature a removable breech block. This breech block is pinned to the slide with two <b>hollow</b> roll <b>pins,</b> one pressed inside the other, with their split ends opposed.

50|$|Badges {{were made}} of pressed steel, brass and zinc. All {{versions}} of the Wound Badge were worn on the lower left breast of the uniform or tunic.

At first, the Wound Badge in Black was stamped from sheet brass, painted semi-matte black with a <b>hollow</b> reverse <b>pin</b> back attachment or of solid construction. From 1942, steel was {{used to make the}} badges. The Wound Badge in silver was made (before 1942) from silver-plated brass, and (after 1942) from lacquered zinc, and had a solid reverse with either a needle pin or a broad flat pin bar. The Wound Badge in Gold was a gilded version of the Wound Badge in Silver. In 1957, a revised version of the Wound Badge was authorised for wear; however, the previous type could still be worn if the swastika were removed (for example by grinding).|$|R
50|$|Ergonomics {{and fully}} ambidextrous {{controls}} were a key {{focus in the}} design of the firearm, and as a result, three interchangeable grip backstraps are included (small, medium and large) to accommodate various hand shapes and sizes; this feature permits most shooters a comfortable and efficient grip on the firearm. The injection molded grip frame contains four steel guide rails for the slide: two at the rear of the frame, and the remaining pair above the front of the trigger guard. The trigger guard itself is squared off at the front and textured. The polymer grip has a texturized 'HI-GRIP' non-slip surface on the sides and both the front and rear backstraps and a slightly funneled magazine well to aid magazine insertion. The <b>hollow</b> cross <b>pin</b> that secures the lower end of the backstrap was designed to function as a loophole for attachment of a lanyard.

40|$|In this paper, a {{statistical}} methodology of estimating wear coefficient and predicting wear volume in a revolute joint using in-situ measurement data is presented. An instrumented slider-crank mechanism is built, which can measure the joint {{force and the}} relative motion between the pin and bushing during operation. The former is measured using a load cell built onto a necked portion of the <b>hollow</b> steel <b>pin,</b> while the latter is measured using a capacitance probe. In order to isolate the effect of friction in other joints, a porous carbon air bearing for the revolute joint between the follower link and the slide stage, {{as well as a}} prismatic joint for the linear slide, are used. Based on the relative motion between the centers of pin and bushing, the wear volumes are estimated at six different operating cycles. The Bayesian inference technique is used to update the distribution of wear coefficient, which incorporates in-situ measurement data to obtain the posterior distribution. In order to obtain the posterior distribution, Markov Chain Monte Carlo technique is employed, which effectively draws samples of the given distribution. The results show {{that it is possible to}} narrow the distribution of wear coefficient and to predict the future wear volume with reasonable confidences. The effect of prior distribution on the wear coefficient is discussed by comparing with non-informative case...|$|R
