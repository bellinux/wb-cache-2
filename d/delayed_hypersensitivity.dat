25|$|Prednisone is an {{immunosuppressive}} agent which affects {{all of the}} organ systems. Effects on the cellular level include cell activation, replication, differentiation, and mobility. The overall goal is to decrease blistering (inhibition of immediate and <b>delayed</b> <b>hypersensitivity)</b> through decreasing the production of autoantibodies. In order to suppress the production of antibodies, higher doses must be administered. Lesser doses can be prescribed {{in order to achieve}} suppression of monocyte function.|$|E
25|$|Visible, irritating bites {{are due to}} {{an immune}} {{response}} from the binding of IgG and IgE antibodies to antigens in the mosquito's saliva. Some of the sensitizing antigens are common to all mosquito species, whereas others are specific to certain species. There are both immediate hypersensitivity reactions (types I and III) and <b>delayed</b> <b>hypersensitivity</b> reactions (type IV) to mosquito bites. Both reactions result in itching, redness and swelling. Immediate reactions develop {{within a few minutes}} of the bite and last for a few hours. Delayed reactions take around a day to develop, and last for up to a week.|$|E
2500|$|There {{have been}} {{concerns}} about {{the side effects of}} monoclonal antibodies, and specifically of infliximab, but these are rare. [...] Early side effects include the risk of allergic reactions (including anaphylaxis which may be life-threatening), and reactions to the infusion. [...] These are often treated with medications given before treatment. [...] Infliximab also carries a risk of worsening infection, and can cause reactivation of old infections, like tuberculosis. [...] Over time, there is the risk of serum sickness, which is a <b>delayed</b> <b>hypersensitivity</b> response to the medication. [...] Later complications may include multiple sclerosis and lymphoma. [...] Finally, the medication is quite expensive, with treatment costs ranging from US$3000 to $8000 per infusion.|$|E

40|$|This study {{evaluates the}} overall {{survival}} and disease free survival of melanoma patients that {{were treated with}} an autologous melanoma cell vaccine, administered as a post-operative adjuvant. Included are 43 patients with totally resected metastatic melanoma (28 -AJCC stage III, 15 -AJCC stage IV), with a median follow up of 34 months (6 – 62). The treatment consisted of eight doses of a vaccine made of 10 – 25 × 106 autologous melanoma cells either released from the surgical specimen or grown in cell cultures. Tumour cells were conjugated with hapten dinitrophenyl, mixed with Bacille Calmette Guérin and irradiated to 110 [*]Gy.

Patients with a <b>delayed</b> type <b>hypersensitivity</b> reaction of ⩾ 10 [*]mm had a median disease free survival of 17 months (mean 35 months) and a mean overall survival of 63 months (median not reached). In contrast, patients with a negative or weak <b>delayed</b> type <b>hypersensitivity</b> had a median disease free survival of 9 months (relative risk of recurrence= 4. 5, P= 0. 001), and a median overall survival of 16 months (relative risk of death= 15, P= 0. 001). Stage III patients with a positive <b>delayed</b> type <b>hypersensitivity</b> reaction had an improved disease free survival of 16 months and a mean overall survival of 38 months, whereas patients with a negative <b>delayed</b> type <b>hypersensitivity</b> had a median disease free survival of 7 months (relative risk= 4. 5, P= 0. 02) and a median overall survival of 16 months (relative risk= 9. 5, P= 0. 005).

40|$|The {{relation}} between non-specific <b>delayed</b> cutaneous <b>hypersensitivity</b> and bird fancier's lung {{was investigated in}} 13 patients with the disorder. They were compared with 50 subjects who {{had no reason to}} have decreased non-specific <b>delayed</b> cutaneous <b>hypersensitivity</b> (control group) and 34 patients with pulmonary sarcoidosis. In addition, 13 patients with bird fancier's lung (11 of the original group) were tested at least one year after avoiding exposure to the causal antigen. Five antigens (candidine, staphylococcal toxoid, tuberculin purified protein derivative, trichophyton, and streptokinase-streptodornase) were injected intradermally (0. 1 ml) and the mean weal diameter was measured at 48 hours. The mean weal size was significantly less in the subjects with bird fancier's lung at the time of diagnosis than in the control group (2. 23 v 5. 66 mm) but did not differ significantly from that of the subjects with sarcoidosis (2. 80 mm) or from that of the bird fanciers with no exposure to the causal antigen for one year (2. 75 mm).

40|$|Background: <b>Delayed</b> {{cutaneous}} <b>hypersensitivity</b> {{tests are}} a globally accepted test to assess cellular immunity in vivo. The {{quality and quantity}} of the response to these type of tests, varies in different populations. Aim: To study <b>delayed</b> cutaneous <b>hypersensitivity</b> in a group of healthy Chilean elders. Material and methods: Forty two elders (32 male), aged 60 to 76 years old were studied. Multitest-CMI® was applied in the left forearm. This test allows the subcutaneous administration of seven antigens and a glycerin control. Results were compared with those of a group of young adults studied by the authors. Results: Among males there was a mean of 2. 7 ± 1. 4 positive responses compared with women, that had 1. 7 ± 1 positive responses (p= 0. 016). The sum of response diameters was 4. 2 ± 1. 5 and 3. 6 ± 1. 9 mm in men and women respectively (p = NS). Compared to young adults, elderly women had a lower response to tetanus and diphtheria toxoids and men had a lower response to diphtheria and Proteus mirabilis. Conclusions: Elderly people have a less intense response to <b>delayed</b> cutaneous <b>hypersensitivity</b> tests than young adults. This response must be assessed in each population to account for regional variability. (Rev Méd Chile 2000; 128 : 379 - 86) ...|$|R

40|$|ABSTRACT The {{immunological}} {{response of}} chickens infected at 28 days of age with {{infectious bursal disease}} virus (IBDV) was examined. Cellular immunity was studied by the graft ̂ versus-host reaction and <b>delayed</b> type <b>hypersensitivity</b> skin reactions to tuberculin. Antibody responses to sheep red blood cells (S-RBC's) were tested by a direct hemagglutination test. Circulating levels of immunoglobulins (Ig's) IgM, IgG and IgA were monitored by the radial immunodiffusion test. The results of the graft-versus-host reaction and <b>delayed</b> type <b>hypersensitivity</b> reactions were similar for both the infected and control chicks. IBDV significantly reduced the primary antibody response to S-RBC's, but had no marked effect on the secondary antibody response.
