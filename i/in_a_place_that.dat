Antibiotics in addition to standard incision and drainage is recommended in persons with severe abscesses, many sites of infection, rapid disease progression, the presence of cellulitis, symptoms indicating bacterial illness throughout the body, or a health condition causing immunosuppression. People who are very young or very old may also need antibiotics.

25|$|The Guardian then {{sets off}} to the Black Garden. After going through a teleporter, they find {{themselves}} <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>place</b> <b>that</b> is not on any map of known space and time. After several battles, the Guardian reaches {{the heart of the}} Black Garden, which the Vex appear to be worshiping. The heart summons three Sol Progeny — a group of Vex units called Eschaton Mind, Imminent Mind, and Primeval Mind. After defeating the three Sol Progeny, the heart is destroyed, returning the Guardian to Mars and lifting the shroud of Darkness from the Traveler back on Earth. At the Tower, the Speaker addresses gathered Guardians in a celebratory speech. Over in the nearby hangar, though, the player's Guardian converses with the Exo Stranger, who says that the fight is far from over.|$|E
25|$|In {{all these}} {{religious}} paintings {{there is something}} that is very seldom found in the art of today, that is as rare in painting as it is rare in poetry—the quality of rapture. I had seen some of these pictures before and <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>place</b> <b>that</b> had a different atmosphere from that of a picture gallery. I had seen them in the painter’s house, on rough walls, hanging above where children played or where a family sat at a meal. In these surroundings they had seemed natural and right—they had enshrined the reality that was around. And here beside the Silvermine River in Connecticut I talked with a man who might have worked in one of the cathedrals or belonged to a mediaeval guild of craftsmen, a man who considers art in relation to an economy utterly different from the one that is dominant among us in the world today.|$|E

25|$|Broadcast 15 February 1995, {{the final}} episode deals with plants {{that live in}} hostile environments. Attenborough visits Ellesmere Island, north of the Arctic Circle, to {{demonstrate}} that even <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>place</b> <b>that</b> is unconducive to life, it can be found. Algae and lichens grow in or on rock, and during summer, when the ice melts, flowers are much more apparent. However, they must remain {{close to the ground}} {{to stay out of the}} chilling wind. In the Tasmanian mountains, plants conserve heat by growing into 'cushions' that act as solar panels, with as many as a million individual shoots grouped together as one. Others, such as the lobelia in Mount Kenya, have a 'fur coat' of dense hairs on their leaves. The saguaro cactus in the Sonoran Desert flourishes because of its ability to retain vast amounts of water, which can't be lost through leaves because it has none. Many desert dwellers benefit from an accelerated life cycle, blooming rapidly within weeks after rainfall. Conversely, Mount Roraima is one of the wettest places on Earth. It is a huge sandstone plateau with high waterfalls and nutrients are continuously washed away, so plants have to adapt their diet if they are to survive. A bladderwort is shown invading a bromeliad. Inhabitants of lakes have other problems to contend with: those that dominate the surface will proliferate, and the Amazon water lily provides an apt illustration. Attenborough ends the series with an entreaty for the conservation of plant species.|$|E

For the motion-capture aspect of the films, he used a suit and facial markers to highlight the dragon's expressions and movements. Cumberbatch told Total Film [...] "You just have to lose your shit on a carpeted floor, <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>place</b> <b>that</b> looks {{a little bit like a}} mundane government building.

500|$|The {{producers}} {{decided to}} start the episode inside The Swan because they considered the audience would expect to pick up from Locke and Jack looking into the hatch shaft, so the opening instead is filmed <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>place</b> <b>that</b> does not reveal its location or period - Jack Bender stated it made him remember a San Francisco apartment - until {{the explosion of the}} hatch. For the flashbacks, director Jack Bender decided to avoid making the hospital scenes similar to ER, filming mostly with handheld cameras to give a [...] "spontaneous feel" [...] to the scene. Sarah's operation was filmed in an actual surgery room in Oahu, while Aloha Stadium in Honolulu is used for Jack and Desmond's tour de stade.|$|E

Andrew Billen of The Times refuted claims by the BBC that [...] "EastEnders Live" [...] was not a [...] "gimmick" [...] but in fact proof of the soap's [...] "innovative vigour". Billen deemed the live episode a [...] "reactionary move", observing that Coronation Street had aired a live episode for its 40th anniversary in 2000. He reminded readers: [...] "live television drama is nothing new but rather harks back to {{the earliest days of}} television and, beyond them, to theatre itself."

500|$|Derrickson chose Nepal as a {{location}} to feature an [...] "Eastern city" [...] {{that would not}} be familiar to most audiences. After scouting and deciding on locations in the country, many of those areas were destroyed by the April 2015 Nepal earthquake. Rather than choosing another country, Derrickson and Cumberbatch felt that bringing attention and tourism to Nepal following the event [...] "was {{all the more reason to}} shoot there". Cumberbatch said that shooting in Nepal was [...] "absolutely vital to this film, I think not least because it’s so based in something that is exotic. It was a magical way to start the shoot. It’s important to a film like this—which has a profound gearshift into a spiritual and otherworldly dimension—that the portal for that be <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>place</b> <b>that</b> actually happens in itself to be incredibly spiritual and marvelous." [...] The eventual filming locations around the Kathmandu Valley included the Pashupatinath and Swayambhunath Temples; Thamel and New Road in Kathmandu; and the Patan Durbar Square in Patan.|$|E

500|$|Greenwald {{first tried}} {{to take control of}} the sounds from the {{expensive}} synthesizers Guitar Center was selling by recording samples of them, but was unimpressed with the results. On a later visit to the shop, he recorded what would be the first sound to be featured on the album; he taped a guy who [...] "was just going for it on a drum kit", lowering the speed of the sample of the drum recording he used. The singer described how he felt while editing the sample: [...] "I started to hear some kind of solace <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>place</b> <b>that</b> is sonically hellish.” Greenwald started recording the album in a Guitar Center in Brooklyn, and then at a shop in Baltimore. Instead of looking to record instruments specifically planned for a song, Greenwald taped whatever sound he thought that could become better in quality when editing them later. Greenwald ended up with around 40 hours of iPhone recordings to work at his home. Some snippets were played through a 4-track tape recorder, others were old pedals and some were looped or used as synthesizer patches. These recordings were put together, EQ'd, mixed and mastered in Pro Tools. Much planning was put into how the recordings were edited together, as he tried to [...] "connect things that were seemingly un-connectable." [...] The end result was an album that featured ambient, dub, new-age, experimental and post-vaporwave styles.|$|E
500|$|The {{music video}} was {{directed}} by Chris Robinson, and was shot in West Hollywood at [...] "The London". It premiered on MTV on January 28, 2010. French fashion model Noemie Lenoir portrays Usher's love interest. Like the album version of the song, the music video does not feature Plies or his verse. In the video, Usher struggles {{to get home to}} his wife, however due to several obligations and his partying, he cannot make it. Previous shots are given of Usher and Lenoir in a brown backdrop, and assumed previous situations of their love life and Usher coming home. Scenes are seen with Usher in a boardroom setting, and then teaching dance to a group of women in a studio, then in a club. Several instances in the video are unknown as in the scene in which Usher takes a phone call, unknown to the viewer for [...] "business or pleasure," [...] as explained by James Montgomery of MTV News. In describing the video, he went on to say, [...] "...you can kind of see why it'd be about both. Such is the life he's chosen, and now he must deal with the repercussions." [...] In following scenes the threat of infidelity is seen even clearer as Usher gets close to the [...] "over-friendly dancers" [...] and [...] "sipping — and spitting — champagne <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>place</b> <b>that</b> looks very much like a strip club." ...|$|E

During an interview with MTV News, Lee stated that the visual was [...] "ethereal", also saying that [...] "this [...] {{is going to look}} a lot different. Actually, I kind of wanted it to be the opposite. The first video, for 'What You Want,' was very real, and this is very surreal." [...] The singer further confessed that the clip draws inspiration from dark fantasy horror film Paperhouse (1988) in order to achieve surreality. Lee further explained, [...] " [...] this girl, and everything that she would draw would come to life in her dreams, and she was creating this dream world for herself. And at first, it was cool, but then it's like this nightmare. So I sort of thought it would apply, and be cool, to have it be this dream that you're trapped in. So you're <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>place</b> <b>that,</b> at first, is a magical world, but at the same time, you're isolated and trapped there, and that's the reason you {{want to come back to}} reality after a time." [...] When filming the video, fiber optics were used reportedly in order to create the effect of things coming to life after drawing them. Lee described the appearance of the rest of the group in the visual as [...] "sort of like the dream within the dream, in an abyss of darkness".|$|E
