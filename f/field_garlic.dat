Therefore, this study aimed to establish bivariate and multivariate norms for this crop using the Diagnosis and Recommendation Integrated System (DRIS) and Nutritional Composition Diagnosis (CND), respectively. The criteria used were nutritional status and the sufficiency range, and then the diagnoses were compared. The study was performed in the region of Alto Paranaíba, MG, Brazil, during the crop seasons 2012 and 2013. Samples comprised 99 commercial <b>fields</b> of <b>garlic,</b> cultivated with the cultivar &# 8220;Ito&# 8221; and mostly established in Latossolo Vermelho-Amarelo Distrófico (Oxisol). Copper and K were the nutrients with the highest number of fields diagnosed as limiting by lack (LF) and limiting by excess (LE), respectively. The DRIS method presented greater tendency to diagnose LF, while the CND tended towards LE. The sufficiency range of both methods presented narrow ranges in relation to those suggested by the literature. Moreover, all ranges produced by the CND method provided narrower ranges than the DRIS method. The CND method showed better performance than DRIS in distinguishing crop yield covered by different diagnoses.

40|$|<b>Field</b> {{experiments}} with <b>garlic</b> show that rational use of potassium (K) greatly promoted garlic growth and yield. Balanced fertilization {{is shown to}} im-prove crop value by a large margin, with farm income being enhanced considerably. Ahigh-yielding garlic crop demands large amounts of nutrients,especially nitrogen (N) and K. Garlic is particularly sensitive tolow soil K supply. Based on traditional practice, garlic growers in southeast China tend to rely on fertilizer sources that contain only N and phosphorus (P) resulting in steadily declining available soil K lev-els. Potassium uptake imbalance relative to N can predispose the crop to serious disease and insect damage. In addition to loss of garlic shoot and clove yields, crop quality is also lower, reducing the viability of this cash crop alternative. Balanced fertilization technology improves both nutri-ent management practices by farmers and eliminates the effect of K de-ficiency on garlic production.

40|$|Abstract Background Garlic and its {{constituents}} {{are reported}} to have been effective in reducing methane emission and also influence glucose metabolism in body; however, studies in ruminants using garlic leaves are scarce. Garlic leaves contain similar compounds as garlic bulbs, but are discarded in <b>field</b> after <b>garlic</b> bulb harvest. We speculate that feeding garlic leaves might show similar effect as garlic constituents in sheep and could be potential animal feed supplement. Thus, we examined the effect of freeze dried garlic leaves (FDGL) on rumen fermentation, methane emission, plasma glucose kinetics and nitrogen utilization in sheep. Methods Six sheep were fed Control diet (mixed hay and concentrate (60 : 40)) or FDGL diet (Control diet supplemented with FDGL at 2. 5  g/kg BW 0. 75 of sheep) using a crossover design. Methane gas emission was measured using open-circuit respiratory chamber. Plasma glucose turnover rate was measured using isotope dilution technique of [U- 13 C]glucose. Rumen fluid, feces and urine were collected to measure rumen fermentation characteristics and nitrogen utilization. Result No significant difference in rumen fermentation parameters was noticed except for rumen ammonia tended to be higher (0. 05  < P <  0. 1) in FDGL diet. Methane emission per kg dry matter ingested and methane emission per kg dry matter digested were lower (P <  0. 05) in FDGL diet. Plasma glucose concentration was similar between diets and plasma glucose turnover rate tended to be higher in FDGL diet (0. 05  < P <  0. 1). Nitrogen retention was higher (P <  0. 05) and microbial nitrogen supply tended to be higher (0. 05  < P <  0. 1) in FDGL diet. Conclusion FDGL diet did not impair rumen fermentation, improved nitrogen retention; while absence of significant results in reduction of methane emission, glucose turnover rate and microbial nitrogen supply, further studies at higher dose {{would be necessary to}} conclude the merit of FDGL as supplement in ruminant feedstuff...|$|R
5000|$|In the {{beginning}} of the 1960s, Lee traveled throughout Korea to find new subject matters for his art. He found them in nature—seas, beaches, fields and agricultural products—in artificial environments—stone walls in Jeju Island as well as manufactured architectural items—and in unfamiliar areas such as seaweed farms. In 1964, he created an installation work called The Wind Fence in the Han River on Nanji Island. The work was inspired by color rope fences around <b>garlic</b> <b>fields</b> in the countryside. The Wind Fence (1964) is composed of wood sticks and fabric. The wood sticks are firmly embedded to the ground in a circular orientation. The fabrics are tied to every stick and they horizontally connect each wood stick to another, forming four zig-zagged circles. Overall, they form a shape of a fence. Lee considers finding new subject matters significant for inventing new concept and method for his art. In the same year, he did some performance art such as The Burning Canvas Floating on the River (1964). He burned his old paintings and let them drift away in the Han River to demonstrate his defiant drive to [...] "escape from the bonds of the past".|$|R
40|$|Abstract: The {{effect of}} garlic extract {{containing}} bioactive allicin on the germination and subsequent seedling vigour of pathogen-infested wheat seeds, was tested.

The second aim was to charac-terize the antifungal activities of garlic extract and pure allicin on moulds belonging to the natural endogenous microflora. Garlic extract showed fungicidal activity on the endogenous fungal contamination of the wheat seeds and particularly reduced the degree of disease caused by Bipolaris sorokiniana and Drechslera tritici-repentis. Allicin in garlic juice corrected the poor germination of wheat seeds caused by natural mycoflora of grain. Growth promoting activities of garlic juice on wheat seedling vigour was reported. In-terestingly, the inoculum on naturally infected wheat seeds could be reduced with garlic juice as a seed dressing biofungicide, before sowing. In this study, we demonstrated the efficacy and the high control potential of garlic extract against seed-borne wheat fungi.

The models accounted for 98 % and 96 % of the variation observed in A. fatua and P. aviculare, respectively. Model validation performed well in predicting the seedling emergence of both species. According to this model, A. fatua emergence started at 381 TT after sowing and reached 50 % and 90 % of total emergence at 407 and 478 TT, respectively, with a soil base temperature of 1. °C. P. aviculare started emergence at 410 TT after sowing and reached 50 % and 90 % of total emergence at 505 and 590 TT, respectively, with a base temperature of 0. °C.

40|$|Phosphine (PH 3), was {{recently}} found worldwide {{even in the}} remote atmosphere (Naturwissenschaften 83 (1996 a, 131, Atmos. Environ. 37 (2003) 2429). It is of interest to find natural mechanisms which could produce phosphine gas and drive a volatile link of the atmospheric phosphorus cycle {{and the formation of}} phosphoric acid as possible condensation nuclei for clouds. Here we report on simulated lightning exposing sodium phosphate in a reducing medium (methane model atmosphere or organic matter) for 5 seconds to a spark induced by microwave. The gas product analyzed by gas chromatography contained phosphine (yield up to 0. 6 g per kg phosphate P) and methylphosphine (CH 3) PH 2 (yield up to 0. 02 g per kg phosphate P). We suggest a plasma-chemical formation mechanism where organic compounds or methane or secondary hydrogen thereof reduce phosphate to phosphine of which a small fraction can subsequently react with methyl radicals to form methylphosphine. A small yield of 6 mg phosphine per kg phosphate P was even obtained in methane free medium, by simple plasmatic recombination of inorganic phosphorus. We believe that methane and hydrogen are useful model substances of pyrolytic gases with high reducing power which may form if lightning strikes biomass, soil and aerosol. These results suggest evidence that phosphine and methylphosphine (detectable in the <b>field</b> by intense <b>garlic</b> odor) are produced when atmospheric lightning strikes the ground or aerosol which is containing oxidized forms of phosphorus and chemical reductants.

40|$|Comparison {{of seven}} {{isolates}} of rust from leek (Allium porrum), three from chives (Allium schoenoprasum), one from A. scorodoprasum {{and one from}} A. babingtonii {{on the basis of}} telial and uredinial morphology showed there to be three morphologically distinct species. Application of these criteria to herbarium material confirmed these findings and showed the rust on leeks in the U. K. to be the same species found on European leeks, garlic and certain wild Allium spp. from the Mediterranean. It is suggested that the following names be adopted, viz. Puccinia allii (DC.) Rud. for the rust on leeks, Puccinia mixta Fuck. for the rust on chives and Uromyces ambiguus (DC) Lev. for the rust on A. babingtonii. Infection studies on isolates of each rust supported the morphological evidence, and showed the three species to have different, extensive but overlapping host ranges within the genus Allium. In the ampeloprasum complex, A. kurrat accessions were highly susceptible to leek rust whereas some accessions of A. ampeloprasum and A. babingtonii had high levels of quantitative resistance. There was no evidence of 'hypersensitive-type' resistance in the complex. Tests within one leek cultivar (Musselburgh) showed older plants to be more resistant than seedlings in at least two quantitative components. However leaf tissue appeared to become more susceptible to infection with age, except in the leaf tips, which did not change in susceptibility over time. Inoculation of 16 leek cultivars with leek rust isolates from different geographical areas, and subsequent analysis during the disease cycle of several components of resistance (viz; latent period, pustule density and pustule length) showed that some cultivars performed consistently better against all isolates. However, in most cases there was a considerable and complex cultivar-isolate-component interaction. There was no evidence of physiologic specialisation in the isolates, but low levels of specialisation could have been hidden by the high level of variation in the experiments. Comparison of <b>field</b> cultivars of <b>garlic</b> with equivalent virus-free material using an isolate of leek rust gave inconclusive results, and further study of the rust-garlic-virus interaction is recommended.

We {{have compared}} in a <b>field</b> trial two <b>garlic</b> clones, « Germidour » and « Thermidrôme », each one in 3 different virological conditions : - chronical infection by garlic mosaic virus. - mechanical inoculation with garlic mosaic 4 months after plantation. - healthy plants. Symptoms of chronical and artificial virus infection are stronger in « Thermidrôme », in which « chronical » and « shock » symptoms are different, with a secondary attack of Pyrenochaeta terrestris on {{roots in the}} second instance, probably caused by a deterioration of the source/sink ratio. Measures of chlorophyll content of leaves confirm the naked eye observation of symptoms. The yield of bulbs is reduced by 25 p. 100 for virus diseased plants of « Germidour », more than 50 p. 100 for « Thermidrôme ». Two reasons explain similar yields for « VC 6 » (the original virus-diseased clone from which « Germidour » was extracted by meristem culture) and for healthy « Thermidrôme (directly obtained from healthy plants in the « Blanc de la Drôme » variety) : - a higher potential yield, related with higher chlorophyll content in wider leaves. - a better tolerance to the deleterious incidence of virus infection. A paradoxal explanation of the persistance of healthy plants in the « Blanc de la Drôme » variety may be looked for in its extreme virus-susceptibility, {{which is supposed to}} have made efficient the traditional massal selection of bulbs and cloves before plantation, by elite growers. With more tolerant varieties, like « Violet de Cadours », from which was obtained « VC 6 », such a massal selection was probably less efficient, with the consequence of a 100 p. cent virus infection on these varieties...|$|R
40|$|Grace Palacio Arceneaux, a Mexican-American {{resident}} of Watsonville, California, was interviewed in 1977 by Meri Knaster, {{an editor at}} the Regional History Project, as part of a series of oral histories documenting local agricultural and ethnic history. Arceneaux was born in San Martin de Bolaños, Jalisco, Mexico, in March 1920. She came with her family to San Juan Bautista, California, in 1923 during the havoc of the Mexican Revolution. The family lived on a little ranch and eked out a living farming and doing field work. Her mother died in childbirth when she was a young girl, and shortly thereafter her father died, leaving Arceneaux to care for her nine brothers and sisters. As she said, she always had a child to carry on her hip, wherever she went. Not only did her parents not speak English, they did not want it spoken in the house; Arceneaux and her siblings translated for their parents, for their father's business deals and jobs. She attended school through the fifth grade and returned to school many years later, when she was in her forties, to obtain her high school diploma at Watsonville night school, and earned a degree at Cabrillo College. Knaster wrote in her notes of these interviews: “All those years of no schooling are not manifested in either her manner of speaking or vocabulary [...] she's a very articulate woman. ” After her father died, Arceneaux hired out her family as a unit, working in the fields around San Juan Bautista whenever possible, and doing whatever else was available, keeping the county from separating her siblings and putting them in foster homes. Because of serious, recurring bouts of tuberculosis, she spent several years in sanitariums and was no longer able to do fieldwork due to the permanent damage to her health. Her narrative is rich in recollections of local history, of the Mexican and Filipino communities and their customs and inter-relationships. She was married at one time to a Filipino farmworker and so became a member of that community, as well. She also discusses the life of <b>field</b> workers, harvesting <b>garlic</b> and various other crops, and the role of labor contractors in agriculture. The period she spent among Filipinos is rich with details about a side of Watsonville life that is not well documented [...] Chinatown, gambling, and prostitution. Her spirit of grit and determination shines through her descriptions of chronic hard times and poverty as she worked unremittingly to raise her siblings and to make a life for herself. Her life story shows how she made the transition from illegal immigrant farmworker to middle-class social activist. She speaks movingly of her marriages, work life, her precarious financial situation, and the importance of her Catholicism, as she her evolved from an unquestioning Catholic into her own self-defined understanding of her religion as it embraced activism and equality. As a mature woman she returned to school, and discovered the world of books and ideas, and gained confidence in her abilities to speak and think critically about the condition of her community, and its political and cultural marginalization. This in turn led to her involvement in community issues during which she {{became one of the first}} Mexican-American women in the Pajaro Valley to fight for bilingual education, outreach services for poor women, victims of domestic violence, and those seeking to gain educations for themselves. Knaster noted many small, telling details of Arceneaux's life when she interviewed her in her home in Watsonville. She wrote: "there is a nice back yard, where she hung laundry on her clothesline after one interview. We met in the kitchen, a remodeled expanded, large room, with a view of the yard through sliding glass doors, a room full of light, spacious. Grace always kept her hands busy [...] she's one of those women whose work is never done because she does so much and is so industrious, never wasting a moment. She would wash and dry the dishes, pair socks that she had removed from the dryer or fold cloth napkins. Another time she worked on a quilt she had gotten from someone who had died. It was too big for their bed so she removed the trim and sewed as we talked. " Knaster noted that in the background of the tape recordings you can often hear a tea kettle whistling, or water running as she washes dishes, as Grace's voice moves back and forth according to the activity she is engaged in. Sometimes she would get up from the kitchen table to demonstrate something [...] how she used to work in the <b>garlic</b> <b>fields,</b> or how she would carry a little brother or sister on her hip. She would unabashedly let tears flow when relating especially emotional episodes in her life, lifting up her glasses as she wiped away the tears. Knaster characterized Arceneaux as a wonderfully warm, sharing, open person, and extremely informative as well. Despite the hardships in her life, her narration is not bitter or resentful. As her conversation reveals, she has a realistic understanding of ethnic and gender discrimination as it is manifest in the Mexican, Anglo, and Filipino communities, having experienced them herself as a single woman, a Mexican, and later as the wife of a Filipino with a Filipino/Mexican child. Her observations of ethnic and class distinctions in the agricultural communities of San Juan Bautista and Watsonville are a real contribution to the social history of this region...|$|R
40|$|La producción y calidad del cultivo del ajo criollo (Allium sativum) se ven limitadas por diversas enfermedades de origen fungoso y bacterial, que llevan al {{productor}} a aplicar estrategias de control químico y en algunos casos abandonar la actividad por un incremento en las pérdidas. El control biológico es una estrategia útil para combatir este tipo de microorganismos. El objetivo de esta investigación consistió en evaluar el antagonismo {{in vitro}} de Trichoderma sp. y Bacillus subtilis contra tres de los principales patógenos del ajo: Sclerotium cepivorum, Penicillium sp. y Pseudomonas marginalis. Las especies mencionadas se aislaron e identificaron con pruebas bioquímicas y claves taxonómicas respectivamente y se determinó su actividad antagónica y efecto inhibitorio utilizando el crecimiento en platos duales. La cepa de B. subtilis mostró un potencial con valores bajos de PICR: 14, 087 ante S. cepivorum y 3, 328 ante Penicillium sp., por lo que se clasifica como un mal biocontrolador. Por su parte, Trichoderma presentó un potencial muy alto, con valores de PICR de 40, 210 frente a S. cepivorum y de 45, 034 ante Penicillium sp., lo que indica que es un muy buen controlador. Los resultados apoyan el potencial de las cepas de Trichoderma sp. como agentes de control biológico frente a la pudrición causada por Penicillium del ajo, la bacteriosis por P. marginalis y la pudrición blanca por S. cepivorum. No así Bacillus subtilis, pues la cepa aislada demostró poco potencial como biocontrolador. The production {{and quality of}} the cultivate <b>garlic</b> <b>field</b> (Allium sativum) is limited by diverse fungal diseases and bacteria that lead the producer to implement the application of chemical control strategies and in some cases the abandonment of the activity by an increase in losses. Biological control is a useful strategy to combat these types of microorganisms. The objective of this research was to evaluate the in vitro antagonism of the Trichoderma sp. and Bacillus subtilis against three major pathogens of garlic: Sclerotium cepivorum, Penicillium sp. and Pseudomonas marginalis. The species mentioned were isolated and identified by biochemical and taxonomic keys respectively and tested for antagonistic activity and inhibitory effect on growth using dual plates. Strain B. subtilis showed a low potential with low values of PICR, 14, 087 against S. cepivorum and 3, 328 against Penicillium sp., this is bad biocontrol. Regarding Trichoderma sp, it presented a very high potential, with values of 40, 210 PICR against S. cepivorum and 45, 034 against Penicillium sp. The valuation classifies it as a very good biocontrol. The results obtained in these studies support the potential of the strains of Trichoderma sp as biological control agents against Penicillium sp garlic rot, P. marginalis bacteria and white rot by S. cepivorum. This is not the case with B. subtilis, as the isolate proved otherwise...|$|R
40|$|Foram instalados dois experimentos de campo, um com alho 'Lavínia' e outro com cebola 'Monte Alegre' e 'Roxa do Traviú', para estudar a eficiência de controle e a seletividade de herbicidas. Na cultura do alho, havia os seguintes tratamentos: {{pendimethalin}} a 1, 50 kg/ha, linuron a 1, 00 kg/ha e oxadiazon a 1, 00 kg/ha, aplicados no dia do plantio; ioxinil a 0, 50 e 0, 75 kg/ha, ioxinil + oxadiazon a 0, 75 + 0, 25 kg/ha e 0, 50 + 0, 50 kg/ha, aplicados em pós-emergência, testemunhas com e sem cultivo e com palha seca. Ocorreu uma população mista de mato com predomínio de beldroega. Em contagens realizadas aos 48 e 84 dias, verificou-se excelente controle de dicotiledôneas por todos os tratamentos. Ioxinil só ou em mistura com oxadiazon, em pós-emergência, não controlou gramíneas. Nenhum tratamento herbicida reduziu o número de plantas de alho, ocorrendo os menores valores com as testemunhas com mato e com palha. As produções, em peso, de bulbos ocorreram na seguinte ordem decrescente: testemunha capinada >oxadiazon >ioxinil + oxadiazon a 0, 50 + 0, 50 = pendimethalin = testemunha com palha = ioxinil + oxadiazon a 0, 75 + 0, 25 kg > linuron > ioxinil a 0, 75 kg >ioxinil a 0, 50 kg > testemunha com mato. Na cultura da cebola, havia os seguintes tratamentos: pendimethalin a 1, 50 kg/ha, linuron a 1, 00 kg, oxadiazon a 1, 00 kg e chloroxuron a 4, 00 kg, aplicados no dia do transplantio; ioxinil a 0, 50 kg e 0, 75 kg, oxadiazon + ioxinil a 0, 75 + 0, 25 kg, idem a 1, 00 + 0, 25 kg e a 1, 00 + 1, 00 kg, e linuron a 1, 00 kg, todos aplicados 32 dias após o transplantio, testemunhas com e sem capina. Ocorreu uma população predominante de dicotiledôneas com maior frequência de beldroega e de quenopódio. A avaliação, realizada aos 48 dias, mostrou excelente controle de dicotiledôneas por todos os tratamentos, com valores acima de 95 %. O ioxinil, só ou em mistura com oxadiazon, não controlou gramíneas, e o chloroxuron apresentou o menor controle geral, mas ainda satisfatório. O oxadiazon em PRÉ e o linuron em PÓS foram os mais eficientes no controle de gramíneas. Não houve diferenças entre as produções de cebola nos diferentes tratamentos. Two <b>field</b> trials with <b>garlic</b> 'Lavínia' {{and onion}} 'Monte Alegre' and 'Roxa do Traviú' {{were performed on}} a loamy soil to study herbicide selectivity and their efficiency on weed control. The following treatments were studied on garlic: pendimethalin at 1. 50 kg/ha; linuron at 1. 00 kg/ha and oxadiazon at 1. 00 kg/ha, applied in pre-emergence at the planting day; ioxynil at 0. 50 and 0. 75 kg/ha, ioxynil + oxadiazon at 0. 75 + 0, 25 kg/ha and 0. 50 + 0. 50 kg/ha, applied 35 days after, weeded and hoed checks and a check with mulch. The weed population {{was a mixture of}} various types of weeds; predominated by Portucala oleracea L. Weed control was evaluated at 48 and 84 days. All treatments controlled very well the dicotyledons. Ioxynil alone or mixed with oxadiazon in post-emergence did not control grasses. None of the herbicide treatments reduced the garlic stand, occurring the lowest number on the checks with weeds and mulch. The yields occurred in the following: hoed check > oxadiazon > ioxynil + oxadiazon at 0. 50 + 0. 50 kg/ha = pendimethalin = mulch = ioxynil + oxadiazon at 0. 75 + 0. 25 kg/ha > linuron > ioxynil at 0. 75 kg/ha > ioxynil at 0. 50 kg/ha > weeded check. On the onion crop the following treatments were studied: pendimethalin at 1. 50 kg/ha, linuron at 1. 00 kg/ha, oxadiazon at 1. 00 kg/ha, and chloroxuron at 4. 00 kg/ha, applied in pre-emergence on the day of transplanting; ioxynil at 0. 50 and 0. 75 kg/ha, oxadiazon + ioxynil at 0. 75 + 0. 25 kg/ha, at 1. 00 + 0. 25 kg/ha and at 1. 00 + 1. 00 kg/ha and linuron at 1. 00 kg/ha, all applied 32 days after, weeded and hoed checks. The weeds occurring were predominantly dicotyledons being Portulaca oleracea L. and Chenopodium album L. the most dominant. Control evaluation was done at 48 days showing an excelent control of dicotyledons (over 95 %) by all treatments. Ioxynil alone or mixed with oxadiazon did not control grasses and chloroxuron showed the lowest general control but yielded satisfactory. Oxadiazon in pre-emergence and linuron in post-emergence were the most efficient in controling gresses. There were no differences among treatments for bulb yield...|$|R
