25|$|Perlis laksa (Malay: Laksa Perlis) {{is similar}} to Penang Laksa but differs in <b>garnishing</b> used such as catfish and eel fish. The famous Perlis laksa {{can be found in}} Kuala Perlis.|$|E
25|$|Ackerman also {{convinced}} the Defense Department to stop <b>garnishing</b> wages from certain U.S. soldiers {{serving in the}} war against Iraq. Although troops who serve in combat zones are not required to pay federal taxes, many soldiers had failed to be granted the exemption.|$|E
25|$|Kedah laksa (Malay: Laksa Kedah) is {{very similar}} to Penang laksa and only differs in the <b>garnishing</b> used. Sliced boiled eggs are usually added to the dish. Kedah laksa used rice to make a laksa noodle. The famous laksa in Kedah is Laksa Telok Kechai.|$|E
50|$|While not {{as widely}} used as more common <b>garnishes</b> such as olives or lemon twists, the {{cocktail}} onion is the signature <b>garnish</b> of the Gibson, {{which consists of}} a standard Martini <b>garnished</b> with a cocktail onion instead of the standard olive.|$|R
5000|$|While {{certainly}} not required, a cocktail <b>garnish</b> adds a festive touch to any mixed drink. Generally, the more fruit flavors in a drink, the more festively the drink is <b>garnished.</b> More traditional drinks (e.g., martini, whiskey sour, or godfather) are generally <b>garnished</b> more conservatively. Many non-alcoholic mixed drinks (like punches) {{may not be}} <b>garnished</b> at all, unless they are [...] "virgin" [...] (non-alcoholic) versions of traditional cocktails.|$|R
50|$|A <b>garnish</b> may be {{so readily}} {{identified}} with a specific dish that the dish may appear incomplete without the <b>garnish.</b> Examples include a banana split sundae with cherries on top or buffalo wings served with celery stick <b>garnish</b> and blue cheese dressing.|$|R
25|$|The {{two main}} groups of parsley used as herbs are curly leaf (i.e.) (P. crispum crispum group; syn. P. crispum var. crispum) and Italian, or flat leaf (P. crispum neapolitanum group; syn. P. crispum var. neapolitanum); of these, the neapolitanum group more closely resembles the natural wild species. Flat-leaved parsley is {{preferred}} by some gardeners {{as it is}} easier to cultivate, being more tolerant of both rain and sunshine, and is said to have a stronger flavor, (although this is disputed,) while curly leaf parsley is preferred by others because of its more decorative appearance in <b>garnishing.</b> A third type, sometimes grown in southern Italy, has thick leaf stems resembling celery.|$|E
25|$|In 2002, Stavans {{published}} in the Barcelona newspaper La Vanguardia a Spanglish translation of {{the first chapter of}} Cervantes’ Don Quixote de la Mancha. The translation has been controversial throughout the world, <b>garnishing</b> celebrations and attacks. Critics accuse Stavans of using Spanglish to call attention to himself. Supporters say that the translation is an indication that the Latino community in the United States has come of age. Stavans has responded to the reactions with interviews in which he argues that Spanglish is today’s manifestation of “mestizaje,” the crossbreeding of racial, social, and cultural traits of Anglos and Latinos similar to what occurred during the colonization of the Americas in the sixteenth century.|$|E
500|$|The false {{chanterelle}} {{has been described}} as edible (though not tasty) by some experts, but other authors report it as potentially poisonous. Indeed, Fries described it as venenatus, meaning [...] "poisonous", in 1821. David Arora speculates that the confusion about edibility may be a result of misidentification with the similar-looking but definitely poisonous Omphalotus species. However, extracts made from Nigerian collections were mildly toxic to mice. Some people experience gastrointestinal symptoms after eating the mushroom, possibly due to its high levels of the sugar alcohol arabitol. It was eaten, though not especially highly regarded, by the Zapotec people of Ixtlán de Juárez in Oaxaca. The Tepehuán people of northwestern Mexico also occasionally eat the mushroom, which they refer to in their native language as guin'xacan ("delightful") or kia's gio ("iguana lard"); there, it is commonly prepared by roasting over charcoal, or boiling and <b>garnishing</b> with cheese.|$|E
50|$|Jeera rice is {{generally}} <b>garnished</b> with {{finely chopped fresh}} coriander leaves, but is also <b>garnished</b> with onion rings in some Indian hotels and restaurants.|$|R
5000|$|A large {{variety of}} {{cocktail}} <b>garnishes</b> are used. Many rum-based cocktails, {{especially those with}} fruit flavors, tend to be decorated with tropical-themed <b>garnishes</b> or slices of fruit. Tequila-based drinks favor limes and other citrus fruits. Gin- and vodka-based drinks tend toward <b>garnishes</b> with a more dignified flair (olives, onions, or possibly a citrus twist or a single maraschino cherry), unless they are variations of a fruity rum-based drink. Whiskey- and brandy-based drinks tend toward minimal garnishment, if any. Restaurant chains and hotel bars tend to use larger and more ostentatious <b>garnishes,</b> and neighborhood bars tend to go the other extreme.|$|R
50|$|In Hong Kong and Guangzhou, wonton noodles {{are usually}} served in {{steaming}} hot soup with shrimp wontons and <b>garnished</b> with leafy vegetables. There {{are plenty of}} variations of this popular Cantonese dish, with different toppings and <b>garnishes.</b> For example, the soup and wontons in a separate bowl, the noodles being served relatively dry, with the toppings and <b>garnishes,</b> dressed with sauce, dipping the noodles in the soup to eat it.|$|R
2500|$|As a garnish to meat {{dishes in}} the past the most common were porridges and cereals, in which the meat was boiled, later on boiled or rather steamed and baked root {{vegetables}} (turnips, carrots) as well as mushrooms; additionally the meat, without taking account its type, was garnished with pickled products—pickled cabbage, or sour and [...] "soaked" [...] (marinated) apples (mochoniye yabloki) or cranberries. Pan juices, alone or mixed with sour cream or melted butter, were used as gravy to pour on <b>garnishing</b> vegetables and porridges. Meat sauces, i.e. gravies based on flour, butter, eggs and milk, are not common for traditional Russian cuisine.|$|E
2500|$|Several {{different}} {{cakes and}} pies {{are made in}} Campania. Pastiera pie is made during Easter. Casatiello and tortano are Easter bread-cakes made by adding lard or oil and various types of cheese to bread dough and <b>garnishing</b> it with slices of salami. Babà cake is a well known Neapolitan delicacy, best served with Rum or limoncello (a liqueur invented in the Sorrento peninsula). It is an old Austrian cake, which arrived in Campania during the Austrian domination of the Kingdom of Two Sicilies and was modified there to become a [...] "walking cake" [...] for citizens always in a hurry for work and other pursuits. Sfogliatella is another cake from the Amalfi Coast, as is Zeppole, traditionally eaten on Saint Joseph's day. Struffoli, little balls fried dough dipped in honey, are enjoyed during the Christmas holidays.|$|E
2500|$|Johor laksa (Malay: Laksa Johor), from Johor {{state in}} {{southern}} Malaysia, only resembles Penang laksa {{in the kind}} of fish used but differs in everything else. Johor laksa has coconut milk, use kerisik, asam Gelugur, dried prawns, lemon grass, galangal and spices akin to curry. The <b>garnishing</b> comprises slices of onion, beansprouts (taugeh), mint leaves, [...] Vietnamese coriander or daun kesum, cucumber and pickled white radish. Sambal belacan (a kind of chili paste) is placed on the side. Finally, just before eating, freshly squeezed lime juice is sprinkled on the dish. Unique to Johor laksa is its Italian connection – spaghetti is used instead of the normal rice noodles or vermicelli. Johor laksa is traditionally eaten using the hand and the noodles are usually knitted (cetak) into a disk for each serving. Johor Laksa has been declared a Malaysian heritage food by the Malaysian Department of National Heritage.|$|E
50|$|Other pre-prohibition {{recipes for}} the Gibson exist. They all omit bitters {{and none of}} them <b>garnish</b> with an onion. Some <b>garnish</b> with citrus twists. Others use no {{garniture}} at all. There is no known recipe for the Gibson <b>garnishes</b> with an onion before William Boothby's 1908 Gibson Recipe. Some sources persist in using other garnishment than the onion into the 1930s and beyond, but still none use bitters.|$|R
50|$|The sliced seafood that composes {{the main}} {{ingredient}} is typically draped over a <b>garnish.</b> The typical <b>garnish</b> is Asian white radish, daikon, shredded into long thin strands, or single leaves of the shiso (perilla) herb.|$|R

2500|$|Degas's {{work was}} controversial, but was {{generally}} admired for its draftsmanship. His La Petite Danseuse de Quatorze Ans, or Little Dancer of Fourteen Years, which he {{displayed at the}} sixth Impressionist exhibition in 1881, was probably his most controversial piece; some critics decried what they thought its [...] "appalling ugliness" [...] while others saw in it a [...] "blossoming". In part Degas' originality consisted in disregarding the smooth, full surfaces and contours of classical sculpture... in <b>garnishing</b> his little statue with real hair and clothing made to scale like the accoutrements for a doll. These relatively [...] "real" [...] additions heightened the illusion, but they also posed searching questions, such as what {{can be referred to}} as [...] "real" [...] when art is concerned. The suite of pastels depicting nudes that Degas exhibited in the eighth Impressionist Exhibition in 1886 produced [...] "the most concentrated body of critical writing on the artist during his lifetime ... The overall reaction was positive and laudatory".|$|E
2500|$|In November 2005, Mike Joyce told Marc Riley on BBC Radio 6 Music that {{financial}} hardship had reduced him to selling rare Smiths' recordings on eBay. By way of illustration, Riley played {{part of an}} unfinished instrumental known as the [...] "Click Track" [...] (or [...] "Cowbell Track"). Morrissey responded with a statement three days later revealing that Joyce had received £215,000 each from Marr and Morrissey in 1997, along with Marr's final back-payment of £260,000 in 2001. Morrissey failed to make his final payment because, he said, he was overseas in 2001 and did not receive the paperwork. Joyce obtained a default judgement against Morrissey, revised his outstanding claim to £688,000, and secured orders <b>garnishing</b> much of the singer's income. This {{was a source of}} ongoing inconvenience and grievance to Morrissey, who estimated that Joyce had cost him at least £1,515,000 in recovered royalties and legal fees up to 30 November 2005.|$|E
2500|$|Upon release, {{the film}} opened to {{positive}} reviews. Critics praised the film for its simplicity, its romance, {{saying that it}} was [...] "one of the finest romantic films to come out of Bollywood in 2007". The film's direction and performances were particularly appreciated. Taran Adarsh from indiaFM gave the film a 3.5 out of 5 rating saying it is [...] "as refreshing as an ice-cold watermelon juice in scorching heat." [...] Subhash K. Jha wrote, [...] "...Jab We Met is the kind of cinematic experience that is hard to come by {{in this day and age}} of smoky cynicism and borrowed rage." [...] Rajeev Masand from CNN-IBN, who gave the film 3 stars out of 5, described it as [...] "a film bursting with the kind of lovely little moments that'll bring a smile to your face. Khaled Mohamed, of the Hindustan Times, gave the film 3 out of 5 stars, saying the film, [...] "is quite a delight, particularly for the chirpy-chirpy-cheep-cheep girl and the retentive, moan-groan boy. Directed with a flair for <b>garnishing</b> even the most abject of circumstances with humour and irony, here’s a feel-cool movie. Wonderful.|$|E

2500|$|The {{inventory}} has 3690 {{entries for}} precious metals and stones. These include a coffer of Catherine Parr's jewels which {{remained at the}} Tower of London, amongst its contents were gold headresses set with pearls and diamonds (habillements); girdles with gold links set with diamonds, rubies and pearls; and two jewels fashioned with the initials HK, for Katherine and Henry. One more recent acquisition was a jewel with balas rubies bought from Anton Fugger;"A jewell bought by the kinges Majestie of Anthony fulker and his company of Antewarpe in May 1551 and delivered to t'handes of the Earl of willteshere lorde treasurer of England by the kinges Majestie the VIIth day of June 1551.A fayer flower of golde having sett in the same three table ballaces sett withowte foyle, and between everey ballace a perle, and in the myddes betwene the three ballaces a large pointed Diamounte and a perle pendaunt {{at one of the}} ballaces." [...] Edward VI was obliged to buy this jewel, which he described in his diary, for 100,000 crowns because the English crown owed £60,000 to the Fugger's bank. The enamelled Royal Gold Cup which survives in the British Museum is listed simply as; [...] "a Cuppe of gold with Imagerie, the knopp a crowne Imperiall and aboute the bordre of the cover and the foote a Crowne garnished with lxii <b>garnishing</b> perles weying lxxix oz," [...] and identified by its original number of pearls. The [...] "knopp a crowne Imperiall" [...] and [...] "the bordre of the cover" [...] with its pearls were lost at some point between the 17th and 19th centuries. Notes in the inventory record diplomatic gifts given and some incidents; in the summer of 1552, Edward VI lost a large pearl pendant from a gold chain while riding between Titchfield and Southampton. The pearl was found and returned in May 1553.|$|E

50|$|A <b>garnish</b> makes food {{or drink}} items more {{visually}} appealing. They may, for example, enhance their color, {{such as when}} paprika is sprinkled on a salmon salad. They may provide a color contrast, for example when chives are sprinkled on potatoes. They may make a cocktail more visually appealing, such as when a cocktail umbrella is added to an exotic drink, or when a Mai Tai is topped with any number of tropical fruit pieces. Sushi may be <b>garnished</b> with baran, a type of plastic grass or leaf.
