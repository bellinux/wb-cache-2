Wilbur, M.D. sponsored a measure in the AMA's House of Delegates permitting the AMA Board of Trustees' plan for the merger of <b>D.O.</b> <b>and</b> M.D. professions.

In this paper, I consider the moral status of {{the distinction}} between <b>doing</b> <b>and</b> allowing harm. I look at objections to the doctrine such as James’ Rachels’ Wicked Uncle Case and Jonathan Bennett’s argument that any acceptable analysis of the distinction leaves it implausible that the distinction is morally relevant. I consider putative defences of the Doctrine from Philippa Foot and Warren Quinn. I argue that neither Foot not Quinn provides a satisfactory justification of the Doctrine of <b>Doing</b> <b>and</b> Allowing, but that the idea of self-ownership discussed by Quinn can be developed to provide a justification of the doctrine...|$|R
