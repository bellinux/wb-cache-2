40|$|The aim of {{this study}} is to examine the effect of {{settlement}} intentions on the structural, social, and cultural integration of recently arrived intra-EU migrants in the Netherlands. Hypotheses on differences in integration, both shortly after arrival and over time, are derived from the intergenerational immigrant integration model. Based on two waves from the New Immigrants to the Netherlands Survey, a multilevel growth model was estimated. Most differences were found with regard to the level of integration shortly after arrival. Migrants who <b>intend</b> <b>to</b> leave and those who <b>intend</b> <b>to</b> stay were found to differ most strongly from each other in terms of initial levels of structural, social, and cultural integration. Migrants who <b>intend</b> <b>to</b> stay had more contact with natives, were more proficient in Dutch, and consumed more host country media than migrants who <b>intend</b> <b>to</b> leave. On the other hand, migrants who <b>intend</b> <b>to</b> leave worked more hours per week than migrants who <b>intend</b> <b>to</b> stay. Differences over time were only found with regard to Dutch language proficiency. Migrants who <b>intend</b> <b>to</b> stay increased their proficiency stronger than migrant who <b>intend</b> <b>to</b> leave...|$|R

40|$|Disastrous {{wildfires}} {{have occurred}} often in south-eastern Australia. Following multi-fatality wildfires in Victoria on 7 February 2009 the national approach to community wildfire safety, ‘Prepare, stay and defend or leave early’, came under intense critical scrutiny. The approach was revised subsequently {{so as to}} emphasise leaving as the safest option {{in the event of}} a wildfire warning. This study reports findings from a survey of 584 residents of at-risk locations. The majority (47 %) reported that they <b>intended</b> <b>to</b> leave if warned of a bushfire threat. However, a substantial minority (24 %) reported that they <b>intended</b> <b>to</b> stay and defend their home. A further 29 % reported that they <b>intended</b> <b>to</b> wait and see what developed before making a final decision. Those <b>intending</b> <b>to</b> leave differed from those <b>intending</b> <b>to</b> stay and defend in several ways. Those <b>intending</b> <b>to</b> leave were characterised generally by being more concerned about the danger posed by bushfires, they viewed themselves as more vulnerable to bushfire threat and they were worried about their house being destroyed in their absence. Those <b>intending</b> <b>to</b> stay and defend were motivated, mostly, to protect their valued property and they believed that their efforts would be successful. They did not perceive themselves to be risk takers. Those <b>intending</b> <b>to</b> leave generally reported rather low levels of preparations for leaving safely. An appreciable percentage of those <b>intending</b> <b>to</b> stay and defend reported levels of preparations for safe defence which were probably inadequate for safe and effective defence...|$|R
