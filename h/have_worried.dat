25|$|On 4 November 2008, {{forensic}} tests {{concluded that}} the Guangxu Emperor died from acute arsenic poisoning. China Daily quoted a historian, Dai Yi, who speculated that Cixi may have known of her imminent death and may <b>have</b> <b>worried</b> that the Guangxu Emperor would continue his reforms after her death. CNN reported in November 2008 {{that the level of}} arsenic in his remains was 2,000 times higher than that of ordinary people.|$|E
25|$|The news {{coverage}} of the rapes and updated travel advisories <b>have</b> <b>worried</b> Indian tourism industry. Some media reports stated that high-profile rape cases had led to tourist numbers to drop 20 to 30 per cent compared to previous year. The Assocham agency found that of 1200 businesses surveyed more than 70% reported cancellations by female tourists from Britain, Canada, the U.S. and Canada along with a 25% decline overall. However, tourist arrivals in India increased from 6.5 million arrivals in 2012 to 6.8 million arrivals in 2013. Tourist arrivals in 2014 observed another 10% increase over 2013 levels.|$|E
25|$|Alongside {{four other}} applicants, CTL {{submitted}} their licence {{application to the}} Australian Broadcasting Control Board in April 1959. The company went public in September of the same year, on the Australian Stock Exchange in Sydney, offering 100,000 shares which were immediately oversubscribed, ending up with a total subscribed capital of A£300,000 (A$600,000). The two key shareholders in CTL made an agreement with all other shareholders that all shares were to be bought back {{in the event that}} they were unsuccessful in their licence bid— they need not <b>have</b> <b>worried,</b> since after a hearing of considerable length, the ABCB decided to grant CTL the licence in November 1960. The callsign for the station was to be CTC and the new service was to transmit on VHF channel 7.|$|E
60|$|Then other {{troubles}} came on. Some {{of these}} little girls were sickly, some very sickly. Lady Arabella had her faults, and they were such as were extremely detrimental to her husband's happiness and her own; but that of being an indifferent mother was not among them. She <b>had</b> <b>worried</b> her husband daily for years {{because he was not}} in Parliament, she <b>had</b> <b>worried</b> him because he would not furnish the house in Portman Square, she <b>had</b> <b>worried</b> him because he objected to have more people every winter at Greshamsbury Park than the house would hold; but now she changed her tune and worried him because Selina coughed, because Helena was hectic, because poor Sophy's spine was weak, and Matilda's appetite was gone.|$|R

25|$|Ironically, {{that same}} toga {{eventually}} caused Ptolemy's downfall, {{according to the}} Roman historian Suetonius. Many years later, in AD 40, the Mauretanian king wore it on a state visit to Rome as guest of the emperor Caligula (ruled 37-41). When the two leaders entered the amphitheatre together, the toga and its owner were accorded much admiration by the crowd. In an apparent fit of envy, the deranged emperor ordered Ptolemy's immediate execution. Beyond Suetonius' superficial explanation, {{it is likely that}} the Roman government was becoming concerned by Ptolemy's growing wealth and independence of action and that his removal from power, if not outright execution, was planned. Dio suggests that Ptolemy was executed because he had become too wealthy. Ptolemy had started issuing gold coins, which was the traditional prerogative of an independent head of state. Another likely factor was Ptolemy's distinguished pedigree, which gave him a dangerously broad appeal in north Africa. On his father's side, Ptolemy was the scion of the ancient Numidian dynasty founded by king Massinissa (ruled 201-148 BC), who was Ptolemy's direct ancestor in 5 generations. On his mother's side, he was the grandson of Mark Antony (the last Roman political rival to Augustus) and Cleopatra, the last pharaoh of an independent Egypt. It must <b>have</b> <b>worried</b> the Roman leadership that if Ptolemy ever turned against Rome, his pedigree, wealth and power could endanger the whole Roman position in north Africa.|$|E

2500|$|Muslims in Rwanda {{are also}} {{actively}} involved in social activities, such as their jihad to [...] "start respecting each other". Many Rwandan Muslims are engaged in efforts to heal ethnic tensions after the genocide, are Islamic groups are {{reaching out to the}} disadvantaged, for example by forming women's groups that provide education on child care. Western governments <b>have</b> <b>worried</b> over the growing influence of Islam, and some government officials have express concern that some of the mosques receive funding from Saudi Arabia. However, there is little evidence of militancy.|$|E
2500|$|Some {{parents may}} over-indulge their only child. The media {{referred}} to the indulged children in one-child families as [...] "little emperors". Since the 1990s, some people <b>have</b> <b>worried</b> that this {{will result in a}} higher tendency toward poor social communication and cooperation skills amongst the new generation, as they have no siblings at home. No social studies have investigated the ratio of these over-indulged children and to what extent they are indulged. With the first generation of children born under the policy (which initially became a requirement for most couples with first children born starting in 1979 and extending into the 1980s) reaching adulthood, such worries were reduced.|$|E
2500|$|With {{a return}} like this, Glenn Ford, {{not to mention}} his friend Bill Holden, need not <b>have</b> <b>worried</b> about their future careers after the war. Both men flourished {{throughout}} the 1950s and 1960s as male icons for those decades, but Ford was frustrated that he was not given the opportunities to work with directors of the caliber that led Holden to his Oscar-winning [...] career, such as Billy Wilder and David Lean. [...] Glenn Ford missed out on From Here to Eternity– as did Rita Hayworth– when production was stalled by Columbia studio head, Harry Cohn. He also made the mistake, which he bitterly regretted later, of turning down the lead in the brilliant comedy [...] Born Yesterday (also planned with Rita Hayworth) which Holden then snatched up.|$|E

2500|$|Towards {{the end of}} his life, in 1963, Stephen Burt notes, [...] "Randall's {{behavior}} {{began to}} change. Approaching his fiftieth birthday, he seems to <b>have</b> <b>worried</b> deeply about his advancing age[...] [...] After President Kennedy was shot, Randall spent days {{in front of the television}} weeping. Sad to the point of inertia, Randall sought help from a Cincinnati psychiatrist, who prescribed [...] Elavil." [...] The drug made him manic and in 1965, he was hospitalized and taken off Elavil. At this point, he was no longer manic, but he became depressed again. Burt also states, [...] "In April The New York Times published a viciously condescending review of [...] The Lost World. Soon afterwards, Jarrell slashed a wrist and returned to the hospital." [...] After leaving the hospital, he stayed at home that summer under his wife's care and returned to teaching at the University of North Carolina that fall.|$|E
2500|$|The Wall Street Journal {{reported}} that film critics thought that Walking with Dinosaurss [...] "majestic visuals are seriously undermined by pedestrian storytelling". The Hollywood Reporter said, [...] "Many critics have derided the juvenile {{tone of the}} voice dialogue... also noting that the animals' lips don't move." [...] The film review aggregator website Metacritic gave an aggregate score of 37 out of 100, which it said indicated [...] "generally unfavorable" [...] reviews. It surveyed [...] and assessed 10 reviews as negative, six as mixed, and five as positive. The similar website Rotten Tomatoes scored the film with 24% based on a survey of [...] assessed as positive or negative. It assessed 53 as negative and 17 as positive. The website said, [...] "Walking with Dinosaurs boasts painstaking visual brilliance, but it's unfortunately clouded by a clumsy script that's dominated by juvenile humor." [...] It also reported, [...] "The pundits say the filmmakers seem to <b>have</b> <b>worried</b> that a quasi-nature documentary approach might have turned off the youngsters, but the narrative is so poorly executed that the end result isn't all that entertaining, much less educational." ...|$|E
2500|$|National {{security}} reporter Spencer Ackerman {{said the}} film [...] "does not present torture as a silver bullet {{that led to}} bin Laden; it presents torture as the ignorant alternative to that silver bullet". Critic Glenn Kenny said that he [...] "saw a movie that subverted a lot of expectations concerning viewer identification and empathy" [...] and that [...] "rather than endorsing the barbarity, the picture makes the viewer in a sense complicit with it", which is [...] " [...] whole other can of worms". Writer Andrew Sullivan said, [...] "the movie is not an apology for torture, as so many have said, and as I <b>have</b> <b>worried</b> about. It is an exposure of torture. It removes any doubt that war criminals ran this country for seven years". Filmmaker Michael Moore similarly said, [...] "I left the movie thinking it made an incredible statement against torture", and noted that the film showed the abject brutality of torture. Critic Andrew O'Hehir said that the filmmaker's position on torture in the film is ambiguous, and creative choices were made and the film poses [...] "excellent questions for us to ask ourselves, arguably defining questions of the age, and I think the longer {{you look at them}} the thornier they get".|$|E

2500|$|The pier stayed open during World War I, but steamers were requisitioned for war service, entertainers {{were away}} {{fighting}} and tramcars became shelters. Lydia Cecilia Hill {{appeared as a}} dancer in the old [...] up {{to the age of}} 15 years, until it burned down in 1928. On 27 Nov 1941 a Wellington bomber crashed into the sea to the east of the pier. The first jet airspeed record and the first airspeed record over 600mph was made between Herne Bay Pier and Reculver by H J Wilson who broke the World Air Speed Record at 606mph in a standard Gloster Meteor Mark IV in November 1945. Cricketer Godfrey Evans used to box on the pier: [...] "he would take on all comers at £2 a bout until his county Kent, fearing for his eyesight, told him to stop". From 1910 {{to the end of the}} 1960s the Grand Pavilion housed summer shows, winter pantomimes, exhibitions and the Remembrance Day and Commonwealth Day services. The Pier Pavilion, known as the Cowshed, had public roller skating sessions, and until 2010 was home to two roller hockey clubs which won championships. [...] There was a gym, and other sports hosted here were badminton, judo, squash and five-a-side football. Since the pier was built, youths <b>have</b> <b>worried</b> local people by [...] off the pier. There is an annual crab-catching competition on the pier stub. The pier tends to be used as a marker for races.|$|E
