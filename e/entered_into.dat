40|$|The {{purpose of}} this paper is to {{illustrate}} the character of the construction firm <b>entering</b> <b>into</b> agriculture sector and to consider the condition for the continuance of agricultural business. The results are summarized as follows: 1) Construction firm <b>entering</b> <b>into</b> agriculture sector are regional ones and they <b>enter</b> <b>into</b> agriculture sector in order to maintain their employment. 2) To continue agricultural business, it is important to fill the information gap by building relation with organ concerned. 3) Some construction firm build relation with organ concerned without official support. It is highly significant from the perspective of maintaining the regional economic vitality that regional construction firm <b>enter</b> <b>into</b> agriculture sector. Because some construction firm yield the local products in response to regional request, construction firm <b>entering</b> <b>into</b> agriculture sector have a potential to be bearer of regional agriculture. It is needed that local government re-evaluate construction firm <b>entering</b> <b>into</b> agriculture sector from the perspective of maintaining the regional economic vitality and creating bearer of regional agriculture, and support them if needed. After this, it is needed to verify hypothesis that construction firm <b>entering</b> <b>into</b> agriculture sector maintain the regional economic vitality and regional agriculture. Because most construction firm <b>entering</b> <b>into</b> agriculture sector that studied in this paper is founded by board as farmer, it is needed to give a new evaluation to construction firm that are expected to <b>enter</b> <b>into</b> agriculture sector with the revision Agricultural Land Law enforcement in 2009. 2009 年度秋季大会シンポジウム共通論題「農地制度改革と農業参入、農業生産法人...|$|R
40|$|Thesis (MBA) [...] Stellenbosch University, 2015. ENGLISH ABSTRACT: The {{shortage}} of nurse educators {{has an effect}} on the training of current and future nurses. A {{shortage of}} nurse educators leads to the inability {{to increase the number of}} student nurses, which results in a lack of trained nursing staff to meet the healthcare needs of the South African population. There is a need to gain an understanding of why nurse educators <b>enter</b> <b>into</b> and remain in academia versus the reasons why nurse practitioners – specifically registered nurses (RN) – choose to <b>enter</b> <b>into</b> and remain in practice. The prioritised reasons for <b>entering</b> <b>into</b> and remaining in nurse academia were investigated with a focus on: i.) The difference between the reasons why RNs <b>enter</b> <b>into</b> and remain in nursing practice ii.) The difference between the reasons why nurse educators <b>enter</b> <b>into</b> and remain in academia iii.) The difference between the reasons why RNs <b>enter</b> <b>into</b> nursing practice and reasons for nurse educators <b>entering</b> <b>into</b> academia iv.) The difference between the reasons why RNs remain in nursing practice and reasons why nurse educators remain in academia A descriptive, quantitative design was used to explore the factors that lead to nurses <b>entering</b> <b>into</b> and remaining in academia. An on-line, self-administered survey was used as the primary data collection instrument. Data was tabulated and presented in histograms and frequencies. The study found that: i.) RNs <b>enter</b> <b>into</b> and remain in nursing practice for the same reasons ii.) That nurse educators <b>enter</b> <b>into</b> and remain in academia for different reasons iii.) That RNs <b>enter</b> <b>into</b> nursing practice and nurse educators <b>enter</b> <b>into</b> academia for different reasons iv.) The primary reason for RNs remaining in nursing practice and nurse educators remaining in academia are the same The shortage of nurse educators is critical and it is essential that NEIs begin to institute plans focussing on the reasons behind nurse educators’ decision to stay in nursing education. Private NEIs should use the findings of this study to focus on areas that indicate satisfaction with the position rather than dissatisfaction in order to develop specific attraction and retention strategies...|$|R

40|$|This study {{attempts}} {{to understand the}} wishful thinking effect through a group ap-proach. We build a group decision making model that tries to explain how a group dynamic can lead the group to interpret and recall data so that they correspond to more favorable beliefs about the group future prospects. Group members have to take one single common decision determining the group effort level in a joint production. We find that (a) An agent's incentive to <b>enter</b> <b>into</b> denial when others are in denial is higher than an agent's incentive to <b>enter</b> <b>into</b> denial when he is alone; (b) An agent's incentive to <b>enter</b> <b>into</b> denial when others are realist is lower than an agent's incentive to <b>enter</b> <b>into</b> denial when he is alone; (c) An agent's incentive to <b>enter</b> <b>into</b> denial increases with the riskiness of the project; (d) {{the presence of a}} leader can either increase or decrease the incentive to <b>enter</b> <b>into</b> denial depending on assumptions made on costs. We build an experimental protocol allowing to try to test the previous model and validate or not its predictions...|$|R
