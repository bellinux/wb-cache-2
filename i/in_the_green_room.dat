They travelled with a portable case that unfolds into a mini recording studio, {{allowing them to}} put down ideas <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>green</b> <b>room</b> at venues. In a departure from their usual songwriting methods, much of the demo material stemmed from Rauch's rhythms he developed for song ideas on his home kit, leaving {{the rest of the}} group to develop their parts from them. Barnes said the band wanted to direct the album towards the idea of someone finding their own identity, and drew inspirations from various sources, including the novel Till We Have Faces by C.S.

On the Pet Sounds Stage, having managed to drown out Biffy Clyro who were on the NME Stage at the same time, David Kitt had stewards pull his younger brother out of the crowd and up onto the stage so they could perform a song together.

[...] Larson told Long, [...] "I really hope we don't have to play each other" [...] before leaving the green room, but they would in fact face off as Long won his match and a total of $11,516 in cash and prizes. The two men competed against Janie Litras, a dental assistant, in the next episode of the session.|$|E

2500|$|Despite the {{official}} flag policy {{published by the}} EBU allowing only [...] "national, regional and local flags of the participants" [...] and banning {{the flag of the}} Nagorno-Karabakh Republic, during the first voting recap of the first semi-final on 10 May, Armenian artist Iveta Mukuchyan was filmed <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>green</b> <b>room</b> holding the flag of the Nagorno-Karabakh Republic, sparking condemnation from the Azerbaijani press. The situation further escalated during the semi-final qualifiers' press conference afterwards, where a member of the Azerbaijani press criticised the Armenian delegation and the EBU for allowing the flag to be shown during the show. Responding to a question on the incident from a journalist from Aftonbladet, Mukuchyan stated: [...] "My thoughts are with my Motherland. I want peace everywhere."

[...] The Executive Supervisor of ESC, Jon Ola Sand, urged that Eurovision should be a [...] "friendly battlefield....not a political battleground", and presenter Alice Tumler reminded the audience that [...] "Our motto is 'Building Bridges', and music should stand over politics tonight...".

He chaired the {{national}} conference of trades in 1845 and helped organize the National Association of United Trades for the Protection of Labour (NAUT), serving as the body’s president for seven years. Duncombe was a frequent speaker at trade union functions, and came out in public support of a number of strikes. The enigmatic radical was also equally at home <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>green</b> <b>rooms</b> of theatres and the gambling halls of exclusive clubs like Crockford's and Almack's where he ran up debts to the astounding amount of £120,000 - £140,000 (in excess of £8 million in 2006 pounds) http://www.measuringworth.com/index.html. His creditors had him arrested in 1847 and he was heavily criticized for using parliamentary privilege to escape punishment. Indeed, his critics accused Duncombe of using an earlier trip to Canada to support his friend and political patron Lord Durham as a ruse to escape his debts.|$|R
2500|$|Fears {{over the}} ability of Pete Doherty to appear [...] proved unfounded as he was {{reported}} to have gone on a booze session and then slept on a mattress for two hours in his dressing room before taking to Stage 2/NME with Babyshambles. The band then went on to watch Bright Eyes perform on the Pet Sounds Stage. However Amy Winehouse threw the Sunday line-up on Stage 2/NME into chaos by pulling out of the festival. [...] As a result, many of the acts performing on that stage, such as The Thrills, CSS, Dogs and My Chemical Romance, began earlier or later than planned, to the disapproval of some fans. Another casualty was Snow Patrol keyboardist, Tom Simpson who was arrested following the band's appearance at Live Earth on the same day as their Oxegen performance. Despite this misfortune, the rest of the band carried on as planned as they performed a well-received headlining set that included [...] "Run", [...] "Chasing Cars" [...] and [...] "Open Your Eyes". [...] They even questioned if their loyal fans would rather be over <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Green</b> <b>Room</b> watching Editors instead before dedicating a song to the band.|$|E
2500|$|On March 31, 2010, George {{announced}} that he would forgo his final two seasons of college eligibility at Fresno State and enter the 2010 NBA draft. He made his first appearance on a 2010 mock draft on Draft Express a month into his sophomore season. By May 2010, mock drafts such as Draft Express, ESPN.com, and The Hoops Report predicted that George would be selected 12th overall by the Memphis Grizzlies. Two days before the draft, Marc J. Spears from Yahoo! Sports wrote an article about an anonymous Eastern Conference scout stating that [...] "in five years, Paul George will be the best player {{to come out of this}} draft". Hoping to draft Derrick Favors, the Pacers had discussed a draft trade with the Nets that would have sent Danny Granger and the 10th pick to the Nets for Devin Harris, Yi Jianlian and the 3rd overall pick, but the deal fell through. George was invited to sit <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>green</b> <b>room</b> during the draft and was selected tenth overall by the Indiana Pacers. He became the highest NBA draft pick in Fresno State history. On July 1, 2010, he signed his rookie contract with the Pacers; a two-year guaranteed deal worth $3.9 million, with team options for a third and fourth year.|$|E
2500|$|Many changes {{occurred}} during the Nixon administration {{under the direction of}} First Lady Pat Nixon. Clement Conger, the new White House curator appointed during the Nixon administration, had completed substantial Chippendale and Neoclassical interiors at the United States Department of State. <b>In</b> <b>the</b> <b>Green</b> <b>Room,</b> {{as well as in the}} Blue and Red rooms, Conger addressed correcting the generic traditional plaster moldings put in place during the Truman reconstruction, installing historically accurate crown moldings and ceiling medallions. Conger commissioned Edward Vason Jones and David Byers to design new drapes of striped cream, green, and coral silk satin. [...] Conger and Jones cited illustrations shown in an early 19th-century pattern book belonging to the Society for the Preservation of New England Antiquities (now called Historic New England). Coral and gilt ornamental cornices were constructed and installed above the windows. They were topped by hand-carved, gilded American eagles with outspread wings, a favorite decorative motif of the Federal period. The cornices are similar to those in the library of the Miles Brewton House in Charleston, South Carolina, and the South Drawing Room of the Sir John Soane House in London in the United Kingdom. Scalamandré produced a copy of the Kennedy-era moss green silk to be rehung on the walls.|$|E
