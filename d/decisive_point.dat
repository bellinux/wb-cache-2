5|$|During the {{artillery}} barrage {{that preceded the}} infantry assault, Longstreet began to agonize over an assault {{that was going to}} cost dearly. He attempted to pass the responsibility for launching Pickett's division to his artillery chief, Col. Edward Porter Alexander. When the time came to actually order Pickett forward, Longstreet could only nod in assent, unable to verbalize the order. The assault, known as Pickett's Charge, suffered the heavy casualties that Longstreet anticipated. It was the <b>decisive</b> <b>point</b> in the Confederate loss at Gettysburg and Lee ordered a retreat back to Virginia the following day.|$|E
5|$|Hannibal {{stood with}} his men in the weak center and held them to a {{controlled}} retreat. The crescent of Hispanic and Gallic troops buckled inwards as they gradually withdrew. Knowing {{the superiority of the}} Roman infantry, Hannibal had instructed his infantry to withdraw deliberately, creating an even tighter semicircle around the attacking Roman forces. By doing so, he had turned the strength of the Roman infantry into a weakness. While the front ranks were gradually advancing, the bulk of the Roman troops began to lose their cohesion, as they began crowding themselves into the growing gap. Soon they were compacted together so closely that they had little space to wield their weapons. In pressing so far forward in their desire to destroy the retreating and seemingly collapsing line of Hispanic and Gallic troops, the Romans had ignored (possibly due to the dust) the African troops that stood uncommitted on the projecting ends of this now-reversed crescent. This also gave the Carthaginian cavalry time to drive the Roman cavalry off on both flanks and attack the Roman center in the rear. The Roman infantry, now stripped of protection on both its flanks, formed a wedge that drove deeper and deeper into the Carthaginian semicircle, driving itself into an alley formed by the African infantry on the wings. At this <b>decisive</b> <b>point,</b> Hannibal ordered his African infantry to turn inwards and advance against the Roman flanks, creating an encirclement in one of the earliest known examples of a pincer movement.|$|E

25|$|The Channel coast was {{a natural}} obstacle, {{only a few hundred}} {{kilometres}} from the German border and over such a distance, motorised supply from railheads could function, using the dense west European road network and by living off the land, amidst the highly developed agriculture of western Europe, unlike in Poland where it had been much harder to maintain momentum. Tooze concluded that although the German victory of 1940 was not determined by brute force, the Wehrmacht did not rewrite the rules of war or succeed only because of the ardour of German soldiers and French pacifism. The odds against Germany were not so extreme as to be insurmountable by better planning for an offensive based on the familiar principles of Bewegungskrieg (manoeuvre warfare). The German army managed to concentrate a hugely powerful force at the <b>decisive</b> <b>point</b> but took a gamble of great magnitude that could not be repeated if the attack failed. When the Germans attempted to repeat the success of 1940 against the Soviet Union in 1941, little was left in reserve. The Red Army had a greater margin of numerical superiority, better leadership and more room for manoeuvre and the Napoleonic principle of the concentration of superior force at the <b>decisive</b> <b>point</b> was impossible for the Germans to achieve.|$|E

The Native Marriages Act of 1872 was the result of deep consideration on both Maine's and Stephen's part.

25|$|Yoshiki {{was born}} on November 20, 1965 in Tateyama, Chiba Prefecture, Japan, as the elder of two {{brothers}} in a musically oriented family. His father was a tap dancer and jazz pianist, his mother played the shamisen, while his aunt played the koto. He began taking piano lessons and music theory at age four. He then became interested in classical works by Ludwig van Beethoven and Franz Schubert. In elementary school, he played the trumpet in the brass band, and around age ten started composing songs for piano. This period was a <b>decisive</b> <b>point</b> in his life. He was 11 years old when his father committed suicide; he found relief in rock music. After discovering the music of American hard rock band Kiss, he started learning to play drums and guitar. Yoshiki was also influenced by works from Led Zeppelin, Iron Maiden, Sex Pistols, David Bowie, Queen, The Beatles, Charged GBH and Pyotr Ilyich Tchaikovsky.

500|$|Descriptions of {{the battle}} differ, and its {{location}} is debated. The decisive and perhaps sole engagement took place on 8June 218; Dio places it at a defile outside of a village believed to be Immae, approximately twenty-four miles or so by road between Antioch and Beroea. Herodian challenges this assertion, suggesting that the battle took place closer to the borders of Syria Coele and Syria Phoenice, possibly near Emesa. Downey then suggests that two battles took place: an initial engagement matching the one described by Herodian, and a later battle near Antioch, which [...] Downey agrees was the <b>decisive</b> <b>point</b> in the rebellion.

2500|$|Tooze {{wrote that}} a debunking of a {{technological}} {{interpretation of the}} German victory in France, should not lead {{to the conclusion that}} it was the genius of Manstein or the superiority of German soldiers that caused the victory. There was no grand German strategic synthesis, the course of the 1940 campaign depended on the economic mobilisation of 1939 and the geography of western Europe. During the winter of 1939–1940, the quality of German armoured forces was substantially improved and the plan attributed to Manstein was not a revolutionary departure from traditional military thinking but the concentration of superior force at the <b>decisive</b> <b>point,</b> a synthesis of [...] "materialism and military art". The German army committed all its armoured units to the offensive and had it failed, would have had no mobile units to resist an Allied counter-offensive. Casualties were high but with the swift end to the campaign were bearable. The Luftwaffe was also fully committed but the Allied air forces held back a substantial reserve, in anticipation of a longer campaign. The Luftwaffe was able to gain air superiority but at a far greater cost in losses than that of the army. On 10 May, Luftwaffe losses were [...] {{and by the end of}} the month [...] of Luftwaffe aircraft had been written off and [...] badly damaged.
