The idea of cloning was suggested by producers David Giler and Walter Hill, who opposed the production of Alien Resurrection, as they thought it would ruin the franchise.|$|E

However, upon more detailed examination at the scene, the official figures reached 49 dead. The bodies were discovered on the Mexican Federal Highway 40 at about 4am, forcing the Mexican police and the federal troops to close the highway. The victims were all headless and dismembered; none of the victims were shot dead. According to the testimonies of several civilians from San Juan, late at night before the bodies were discovered, a foul-odor could be perceived from a distance, but none of them <b>imagined</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> stink actually came from dismembered bodies. When the forensic experts began to pick up the bodies, they had to use facemasks because the intensity of the odor was intolerable.

500|$|The United States had grievances at British {{violations}} of American sovereignty (their navy was impressing US sailors), restriction of American trade by Britain, and an American desire to gain territory by invading and annexing the poorly defended British North American colonies. American grievances included the impressment of American sailors by the Royal Navy, the blockade of French ports, {{and a belief}} that the British were inciting American Indians to attack U.S. settlements on the western frontier. War hawks in the U.S. called for an invasion of Canada to punish the British Empire and to lessen the threat to American interests represented by the Native Americans. At the same time, the US leaders believed that the growing population needed new territory; some <b>imagined</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> United States was destined to control all of the North American continent.

American hawks assumed that Canadian colonists would rise up and support the invading U.S. armies as liberators and that, as Thomas Jefferson famously wrote, conquering Canada would be [...] "a mere matter of marching".|$|E

500|$|On 8 December, the Austro-Hungarians {{fell back}} against Užice and Valjevo. The Serbs {{anticipated}} that their opponents would entrench themselves {{and attempt to}} block the Serbian Army's advance, but the Austro-Hungarians had failed to construct any defensive networks and, as such, were {{in no position to}} block the Serbian offensive. The Austro-Hungarians had ensured that Valjevo's defenses were fortified and had laid down artillery plans for the town's defense, but their lack of prior preparation meant that the hills surrounding the town were devoid of any significant defensive positions. The Serbs exploited this weakness by manoeuvring around the hills and encircling the Austro-Hungarians, suffering minimal casualties. The Serbian 3rd Army then broke through the defenses of the 6th Army at Mount Suvobor and stormed Valjevo. In Niš, the Bulgarian ambassador to Serbia reported: [...] "The most improbable news from the battleground, sweet to the Serb ear, has been going around since this morning." [...] He wrote that, in the last three to four days, the Serbian Army had captured one Austro-Hungarian General, 49 officers and more than 20,000 troops, as well as 40 cannon and [...] "huge quantities of war matériel". By 9 December, the Austro-Hungarian counter-offensive around Belgrade lost its momentum and the Austro-Hungarians began to retreat back towards the city centre. One Austro-Hungarian soldier wrote: [...] "We could not have <b>imagined</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> Serbs were on our heels, after all we had recently been victorious." [...] On 10 December, the Serbian Army captured the lower reaches of the Drina, forcing the majority of surviving Austro-Hungarian troops to flee across the river. They did not stop until they had crossed the Sava and the Danube and entered the Banat. Very few Austro-Hungarian soldiers made it back into Bosnia.|$|E
500|$|Parsifal {{is one of}} the Wagner operas {{regularly}} {{presented at}} the Bayreuth Festival to this day. Among the more significant post-war productions was that directed in 1951 by Wieland Wagner, the composer's grandson. At the first Bayreuth Festival after World War II he presented a radical move away from literal representation of the Hall of the Grail or the Flowermaiden's bower. Instead, lighting effects and the bare minimum of scenery were used to complement Wagner's music. This production was heavily influenced by the ideas of the Swiss stage designer, Adolphe Appia. The reaction to this production was extreme: Ernest Newman, Richard Wagner's biographer described it as [...] "not only the best Parsifal I have ever seen and heard, but one of the three or four most moving spiritual experiences of my life". Others were appalled that Wagner's stage directions were being flouted. The conductor of the 1951 production, Hans Knappertsbusch, on being asked how he could conduct such a disgraceful travesty, declared that right up until the dress rehearsal he <b>imagined</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> stage decorations were still to come. Knappertsbusch was particularly upset by the omission of the dove which appears over Parsifal's head {{at the end of the}} opera, which he claimed inspired him to give better performances. To placate his conductor Wieland arranged to reinstate the dove, which descended on a string. What Knappertsbusch did not realise was that Wieland had made the length of the string long enough for the conductor to see the dove, but not for the audience. Wieland continued to modify and refine his Bayreuth production of Parsifal until his death in 1966. Martha Mödl created a [...] "complex, tortured Kundry in Wieland Wagner's revolutionary production of Parsifal during the festival's first postwar season," [...] and would remain the company's exclusive Kundry for the remainder of the decade.|$|E

2500|$|Wharton was a {{scientist}} {{interested in the}} natural world, and wrote scientific papers {{on a variety of}} topics including astronomy and metallurgy, presenting several to the American Philosophical Society. In the winter of 1883–1884 there was a period of several months when sunsets were extraordinarily red worldwide. Some <b>imagined</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> red color was from dust dispersed in the atmosphere worldwide by the volcano Krakatoa which had recently erupted. Others <b>imagined</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> reddish hue might come from iron and steel furnaces because they were known to create a reddish-brown dust. Wharton was curious, and one morning when a light snow was falling, collected some from a field near his house, melted and evaporated it, studying the remaining particles under a microscope which he had on hand for metallurgy. The particles looked like [...] "irregular, flattish, blobby" [...] glass particles. He visited a ship that had come to port in Philadelphia, having sailed from Manila, a course that had taken it a few hundred miles from Krakatoa. It had been slowed by a huge amount of pumice floating in the ocean, evidently spewed out by Krakatoa. Wharton obtained some pumice from one of the ship's crew, compared it with the dust he had collected, and found almost identical particles. In 1893 he presented a paper about the dust to the 150th anniversary meeting of the American Philosophical Society. Wharton also wrote a paper about the use of the Doppler effect on the color of light emitted by binary stars to determine their distance from Earth, and made the analogy to a train whistle which changes tone as it passes. Wharton {{was one of the most}} accomplished metallurgists in America during his lifetime, certainly the most widely known.|$|E

Franciscans such as Toribio de Benavente [...] "Motolinia" [...] saw elements of Christianity in the precolumbian religions and therefore believed that Mesoamerica had been evangelized before, possibly by St. Thomas whom legend had it had [...] "gone to preach beyond the Ganges".
