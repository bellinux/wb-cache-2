Under a capitalist economy, managers of firms are ordered and legally required to base production around profitability, and in theory, competitive pressure creates a downward pressure on profits and forces private businesses to be responsive to demands of consumers, indirectly approximating production for use. In the Lange Model, the firms would be publicly owned and the managers would be tasked with setting the price of output to its marginal cost, thereby achieving pareto efficiency through <b>direct</b> <b>allocation.</b>|$|E

40|$|Main {{memory in}} many tera-scale systems {{requires}} tens of kilowatts of power. The resulting energy consumption increases system cost {{and the heat}} produced reduces reliability. Emergent memory technologies will provide systems the ability to dynamically turn-on (online) and turnoff (offline) memory devices at runtime. This technology, coupled with slack in memory demand, offers the potential for significant energy savings in clusters of servers. However, to realize these energy savings, OS-level memory allocation and management techniques must be modified to minimize the number of active memory devices while satisfying application demands. We propose several page shaping techniques and structural enhancements to proactively and reactively <b>direct</b> <b>allocations</b> to a minimal number of devices. To evaluate these techniques on real systems, we implemented these shaping techniques in the Linux kernel. Experiments using our OS extensions coupled with a simple history-based heuristic (to track demand and control state transitions) yield up to 60 % energy savings with less than 1 % performance loss for various benchmarks including lmbench and SPEC. 1 1...|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT We {{present a}} memory {{management}} scheme for Java based on thread-local heaps. Assuming most objects are created {{and used by}} a single thread, it is desirable to free the memory manager from redundant synchronization for thread-local objects. Therefore, in our scheme each thread receives a partition of the heap in which it allocates its objects and in which it does local garbage collection without synchronization with other threads. We dynamically monitor to determine which objects are local and which are global. Furthermore, we suggest using profiling to identify allocation sites that almost exclusively allocate global objects, and allocate objects at these sites directly in a global area. We have implemented the thread-local heap memory manager and a preliminary mechanism for <b>direct</b> global <b>allocation</b> on an IBM prototype of JDK 1. 3. 0 for Windows. Our measurements of thread-local heaps with <b>direct</b> global <b>allocation</b> on a 4 -way multiprocessor IBM Netfinity server show that the overall garbage collection times have been substantially reduced, and that most long pauses have been eliminated.

Additional addresses (say, 10.0.0.230-10.0.0.240) are aliased to the loopback interface of the server (or assigned to special interfaces, the latter typically being the case with VMware/UML/jails/vservers/other virtual server environments) and 'published' on the 10.0.0.2 interface (although many operating systems allow <b>direct</b> <b>allocation</b> of multiple addresses to one interface, thus eliminating the need for such tricks).|$|E
50|$|The {{principal}} {{means for}} accomplishing the reforms was changing the funding system to force research institutes {{to establish contact}} with productive enterprises and to do work directly supporting those enterprises. <b>Direct</b> <b>allocation</b> of funds to research institutes was to be phased out and replaced by a system under which institutes sold theirservices in the marketplace. The distinctions among institutes subordinate to the Chinese Academy of Sciences, the industrial ministries, provincial-level governments, colleges and universities, and even the NDSTIC were to be minimized, and all were to compete and collaborate in a single market-oriented system. Institutes doing basic research were to compete for grants from a National Natural Science Foundation (which was subsequently established). The reforms were not intended as a budget-cutting measure, and total state funding for science and technology was to be increased.|$|E
50|$|The Lange model (or Lange-Lerner theorem) is a neoclassical {{economic}} {{model for a}} hypothetical socialist economy based on public ownership {{of the means of}} production and a trial-and-error approach to determining output targets and achieving economic equilibrium and Pareto efficiency. In this model, the state owns non-labor factors of production, and markets allocate final goods and consumer goods. The Lange model states that if all production is performed by a public body such as the state, and there is a functioning price mechanism, this economy will be Pareto-efficient, like a hypothetical market economy under perfect competition. Unlike models of capitalism, the Lange model is based on <b>direct</b> <b>allocation,</b> by directing enterprise managers to set price equal to marginal cost in order to achieve Pareto efficiency. By contrast, in a capitalist economy managers are instructed to maximize profits for private owners, while competitive pressures are relied on to indirectly lower the price to equal marginal cost.|$|E

Its critics claim equivalence economy is practically impossible, and some indeed point to Marx's rejection in the Grundrisse of the [...] "time-chit" [...] theory of allocating goods proposed by 18th and 19th century utopian socialists such as John Francis Bray and John Gray On this view, Dieterich at most shows that the allocation of goods according to commercial principles is only one method of allocating resources; other methods such as sharing, redistribution, subsidization, barter, grants and <b>direct</b> <b>allocation</b> according to need may often serve the interest of fairness, efficiency and social justice better, provided that people accept a common ethic about {{what is best for}} all, if they can see that adopting such an ethic has good results.

40|$|Two {{apparently}} similar {{methods for}} making numerical judgments about {{a set of}} objects (point <b>allocation</b> and <b>direct</b> rating) {{have been shown to}} yield different profiles of values (here, numerical judgments) attached to Ranks. Direct rating typically leads to a nearly linear relationship of Value with Rank. When using point allocation, people tend to produce a half U-shape of Value with Rank, evidenced by a positive quadratic term in Rank, which is not present for direct rating. We argue that point allocation imposes a fixed-sum frame on the judgment task. Furthermore, certain problems, such as allocating a budget, are intrinsically framed as fixed-sum. These problems also lead to quadratic curvature of numerical judgment with Rank.

The management allocates resources down through the ranks through <b>direct</b> <b>allocation</b> or delegation (Thompson 1967). Communities leave resource allocation to their members. They reveal resources transparently, make them openly available in the commons, and members mobilize these resources at will.
