5|$|Chatwin's {{writing was}} shaped by {{his work as a}} {{cataloguer}} at Sotheby's, which provided him with years of practice writing concise yet vivid descriptions of objects with the intention of enticing buyers. In addition, Chatwin's interest in nomads also influenced his writing. One aspect of nomadic culture that interested him was the few possessions they had. Their spartan way of life appealed to his aesthetic sense, and <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>something</b> <b>he</b> sought to emulate in both his life and his writing. He strove to strip unnecessary objects from his life and unnecessary words from his prose.|$|E

They live {{together}} in the city's Yaletown neighbourhood, and return to Sweden during the off-season. In March 2010, Henrik and Johanna made a joint $1.5million donation, with Daniel and his wife Marinette, to the BC Children's Hospital's $200 million project for a new building; the two families requested that it be put towards a pediatric intensive-care unit and a diagnostic imaging area. Henrik commented that <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>something</b> <b>he</b> and his wife had wanted to do since Valter was born.|$|E
25|$|On the December 11, 1995 {{episode of}} Monday Nitro, Orndorff confronted Brian Pillman after Pillman made {{derogatory}} comments about Orndorff. After telling Flair and Anderson {{how much he}} respected them, Orndorff told Pillman {{that he could have}} been a Horseman and the only reason Pillman was a Horseman was because he turned it down. Anderson and Flair tried to calm Orndorff down but Orndorff lost his temper and attacked Pillman. Pillman, Flair, and Anderson attacked Orndorff and then Arn Anderson and Ric Flair delivered a spike piledriver to Orndorff on the arena floor during the attack. WCW later explained that Orndorff had been seriously hurt in the attack and that his career was over. In actuality, Orndorff was forced to retire due to his previous injuries in the WWF, with the entire right side of his body beginning to atrophy (eventually causing his arm and leg muscles to shrink). <b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>something</b> <b>he</b> had worked through as best he could {{but by the end of}} 1995 he was forced to retire and started to work as a trainer and a road agent for WCW. At the 2000 Fall Brawl, in a match between The Filthy Animals and The Natural Born Thrillers, Orndorff suffered a neck injury after delivering a piledriver. The referee, Charles Robinson stopped the match as a result.|$|E

500|$|The {{episode was}} written by Richard Appel, who wanted to do an episode that had two things; a [...] "go to work with your parents day" [...] and Bart getting a driver's license. The [...] "go to work with your parents day" [...] idea appealed to Appel because <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>something</b> <b>he</b> [...] "lost the right" [...] {{to do when he}} went from public school to private school as a child. Appel {{considered}} those days to be his favorites because he [...] "didn't have to do anything" [...] at his parents' job. The idea of having a driver's license was something that Appel dreamed about when he was younger.|$|E
500|$|After {{completing}} The Elephant Man (1980), Lynch met producer Richard Roth over coffee. Roth {{had read}} and enjoyed Lynch's Ronnie Rocket script, {{but did not}} think <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>something</b> <b>he</b> wanted to produce. He asked Lynch if the filmmaker had any other scripts, but the director only had ideas. [...] "I told him I {{had always wanted to}} sneak into a girl's room to watch her into the night and that, maybe, at one point or another, I would see something that would be the clue to a murder mystery. Roth loved the idea and asked me to write a treatment. I went home and thought of the ear in the field." [...] Production was announced in August 1984. Lynch wrote two more drafts before he was satisfied with the script of the film. Conditions at this point were ideal for Lynch's film: he had made a deal with Dino De Laurentiis that gave him complete artistic freedom and final cut privileges, with the stipulation that the filmmaker take a cut in his salary and work with a budget of only $6 million. This deal meant that Blue Velvet was the smallest film on the De Laurentiis' slate. Consequently, Lynch would be left mostly unsupervised during production. [...] "After Dune I was down so far that anything was up! So it was just a euphoria. And when you work with that kind of feeling, you can take chances. You can experiment." [...] Because the material was completely different from anything that would be considered mainstream at the time, Laurentiis had to start his own company to distribute it.|$|E
2500|$|It {{is often}} assumed {{that given the}} foreshortening seen in the {{representation}} of God the Father, the artist {{was familiar with the}} either of the Italian painters Donatello or Masaccio. Susie Nash believes van Eyck was already leading toward this development, and <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>something</b> <b>he</b> was [...] "perfectly capable of producing without such models", and believes the technique represents [...] "a shared interest [...] a case of influence." ...|$|E

[...] His father, a {{construction}} worker in Libya, {{died of a heart}} attack when Bouazizi was three, and his mother married Bouazizi's uncle some time later. Along with his six siblings, Bouazizi was educated in a one-room country school in Sidi Salah, a small village [...] from Sidi Bouzid. Although several media outlets reported that Bouazizi had a university degree, his sister, Samia Bouazizi, stated that he had never graduated from high school, but that <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>something</b> <b>he</b> had wanted for both himself and his sisters. With his uncle in poor health and unable to work regularly, Bouazizi had worked various jobs since he was ten, and in his late teens he quit school in order to work full-time.|$|E
2500|$|Adams' {{retirement}} in May 2002 meant Vieira became club captain. He described the feeling as [...] "daunting", but <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>something</b> <b>he</b> looked forward to: [...] "Taking the responsibility {{on my shoulders}} is something I relish. It will make me a better, more mature footballer and a more mature person as well." [...] Against Chelsea at Stamford Bridge in September 2002, Vieira was sent off for a late tackle on Gianfranco Zola; Arsenal's persistence nevertheless earnt them a point. In an interview with L'Équipe soon after, Vieira spoke of his desire to rest, as he felt [...] "burned out": [...] "I can hardly stand. My back aches, my legs hurt, it hurts all over. I'm going to see Arsène. He must give me time off to relax." [...] He featured in 66 games the previous campaign for Arsenal, but Wenger rejected the player's need for special treatment: [...] "I looked at the statistics for Tuesday's game and, physically, Patrick was outstanding. He pushed himself very hard and that explains {{why he was so}} tired." ...|$|E

2500|$|The two-silhouette logo is {{inspired}} by, of all things, a highway sign. Ironically, Mahrt was driving to a Metro League game in 2012 [...] thinking out loud {{about his new}} league [...] when he took special notice of the imagery used to demarcate the Lewis & Clark National Historic Trail. <b>It</b> <b>is</b> <b>something</b> <b>he</b> had seen countless times, as the signs appear every five miles along the Missouri River.

A friend who made a few {{tentative}} experiments to this end turned out nothing beyond a will, and that he dictated and left incomplete. (<b>It</b> <b>was</b> scarcely on the lines of an ordinary will, being blasphemous, and mentioning no property except his inside.)

2500|$|The album {{had a more}} hard edged sound {{than the}} Impressions had before. On this new sound Mayfield claimed <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>something</b> <b>he</b> [...] "long wanted to do...but were out of {{category}} of {{what was expected of}} me and the Impressions. What I got off in the Curtis album allowed me to be more personal for myself.". The two singles off the album [...] "(Don't Worry) If There's a Hell Below, We're All Going to Go" [...] and [...] "Move on Up" [...] showcased Mayfield's new funk musical style, {{while the rest of the}} tracks were much softer soul based songs. Not having any traditional music lessons, Mayfield claimed his backing band would occasionly comment [...] "gosh, this is a terribly strange key to play in", but still played it accordingly as written.

2500|$|The {{story is}} told in three parts by the main character, Michael Berg. Each part {{takes place in a}} {{different}} time period in the past. Part I begins in a West German city in 1958. After 15-year-old Michael becomes ill on his way home, 36-year-old tram conductor Hanna Schmitz notices him, cleans him up, and sees him safely home. He spends the next three months absent from school battling hepatitis. He visits Hanna to thank her for her help and realizes he is attracted to her. [...] Embarrassed after she catches him watching her getting dressed, he runs away, but he returns days later. [...] After she asks him to retrieve coal from her cellar, he is covered in coal dust; she watches him bathe and seduces him. He returns eagerly to her apartment on a regular basis, and they begin a heated affair. They develop a ritual of bathing and having sex, before which she frequently has him read aloud to her, especially classical literature, such as The Odyssey and Chekhov's The Lady with the Dog. Both remain somewhat distant from each other emotionally, despite their physical closeness. Hanna is at times physically and verbally abusive to Michael. Months into the relationship, she suddenly leaves without a trace. The distance between them had been growing as Michael had been spending more time with his school friends; he feels guilty and believes <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>something</b> <b>he</b> did that caused her departure. The memory of her taints all his other relationships with women.|$|E

5000|$|McLean {{suffered}} from {{drug and alcohol}} addiction. He went to rehab in 2001 (and again in 2002) following an intervention by bandmate Kevin Richardson. During an interview with New Zealand radio station ZM, McLean described addiction as the hardest thing he has ever had to go through, stating <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>something</b> <b>he</b> battles with every day. He checked into rehab {{for the third time}} on January 10, 2011, citing [...] "personal reasons". In preparation for the NKOTB and Backstreet Boys tour, McLean said, [...] "I want to be healthy and perform and sing for people at my very best and happiest." [...] His time in rehab did not affect the tour.|$|R

5000|$|On his three-year-old debut, Aristotle {{was sent}} to France for the Group Two Prix Greffulhe over 2100 metres on heavy ground at Longchamp Racecourse on 23 April. Ridden by Kinane, he took the lead 800 metres from the finish and drew clear in the closing stages and won by {{three and a half}} lengths from Rhenium. However, he had veered left {{repeatedly}} in the straight, hampering the third placed finisher Boutron, and after an inquiry by the racecourse stewards he was disqualified and demoted to third. Kinane commented [...] "Aristotle ducked to the left on three occasions. <b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>something</b> <b>he's</b> never done before. If he'd kept straight, we'd have won the race by 10 lengths".|$|R

50|$|Through the Monster, Conor {{ultimately}} {{understands that}} although {{he does not want}} his mother to die, <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>something</b> <b>he</b> must accept, and he must not feel guilty for wanting <b>it</b> to <b>be</b> over so he does not have to feel pain anymore. After this, Conor returns, with the Monster by his side, to comfort his mother one last time, and she dies at 12:07. He returns home with his grandmother, with whom he has reached an understanding, and she gives Conor the room that used to be his mother's. In the room, he finds his mother's old art book, which depicts the stories that were told to him by the Monster, and a drawing of his mother as a child with the Monster.|$|R
50|$|Shinjyurou Mamiya (Mamiya Shinjūrō) is {{a skilled}} {{embalmer}} and protagonist of the series, who has romantic feelings for Azuki. While living with Chan in America, Chan often asked if Shinjyurou could work on someone he loves; he finally decides that <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>something</b> <b>he</b> fears, and pledges to never embalm Azuki. He realizes {{the importance of}} giving farewells to actual bodies, which affects his views and his embalming. In the live-action series, Shinjyurou works as a janitor at a hospital, with only Renji and the hospital director knowing he is an embalmer to avoid discrimination. When a body is sent to be embalmed, Renji sends him a text message calling him to a church where he performs the embalming. Masato Wada portrayed Shinjyurou in the live-action drama.|$|R

He never had been afraid of anything in his life before, but now absolute terror took possession of him at sight of the schoolmaster's face. Physical strength and force had no power to frighten the sullen lad, but all the irresistible might of a fine soul roused to frenzy looked out in the young man's blazing eyes, dilated nostrils, and tense white mouth. It cowed the boy, because <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>something</b> <b>he</b> could not understand. He only {{realized that he was}} in the presence of a force that was not to be trifled with.|$|E
60|$|Strether WAS then {{as much as}} {{ever the}} valued friend of her family, <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>something</b> <b>he</b> could at all events go on with; and the manner of his {{response}} to it expressed even for himself how little he had enjoyed the prospect of ceasing to figure in that likeness. He had always seen Sarah gracious--had in fact rarely seen her shy or dry, her marked thin-lipped smile, intense without brightness and as prompt to act as the scrape of a safety-match; the protrusion of her rather remarkably long chin, which in her case represented invitation and urbanity, and not, as in most others, pugnacity and defiance; the penetration of her voice to a distance, the general encouragement and approval of her manner, were all elements with which intercourse had made him familiar, but which he noted today {{almost as if she}} had been a new acquaintance. This first glimpse of her had given a brief but vivid accent to her resemblance to her mother; he could have taken her for Mrs. Newsome while she met his eyes as the train rolled into the station. It was an impression that quickly dropped; Mrs. Newsome was much handsomer, and while Sarah inclined to the massive her mother had, at an age, still the girdle of a maid; also the latter's chin was rather short, than long, and her smile, by good fortune, much more, oh ever so much more, mercifully vague. Strether had seen Mrs. Newsome reserved; he had literally heard her silent, though he had never known her unpleasant. It was the case with Mrs. Pocock that he had known HER unpleasant, even though he had never known her not affable. She had forms of affability that were in a high degree assertive; nothing for instance had ever been more striking than that she was affable to Jim.|$|E

It seemed, indeed, as if everything connected with Toby was destined to beget distrust and anxiety in my bosom. Notwithstanding Marnoo’s denial of any knowledge of his fate, I could not avoid suspecting that he was deceiving me; and this suspicion revived those frightful apprehensions with regard to my own fate, which, for a short time past, had subsided in my breast.|$|R
