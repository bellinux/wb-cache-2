40|$|In March of 2015, twelve {{samples of}} {{vesicular}} basalt {{were collected from}} Villarrica volcano in Southern Chile. The samples were collected along a northeast-southwest trending fissure and cinder cone system {{on the east side}} of the stratovolcano, at nine locations. Samples were crushed, sieved, cleaned, and picked in preparation for ICP-MS (inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry). ICP-MS data is used to determine the major and trace elements composition of the rock. We will use this geochemical data, so we can determine if these lava flows were sourced by a single eruptive event, or multiple eruptive events. Since these are mafic rocks, we are primarily <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>looking</b> <b>for</b> significant differences in iron and magnesium content. Compositional analysis will also give us insight regarding magma source, and magmatic evolution. Hickey-Vargas et al., (1989), found that small satellite cones have higher olivine/plagioclase ratios compared to the lava from the main Villarrica volcano, so we expect to see something similar.

40|$|Ironically rural America {{has become}} viewed {{by a growing}} number of Americans as having a higher quality of life not because of wat it has, but rather because of what it does not have. ” This quote from an unknown author found by a {{graduate}} student in the University of Nebraska Rural Initiative focuses on a poin we often forget. No doubt you can name many things we are happy not to have in rural Nebraska: smog, traffic jams, urban canyons, lack of green or open spaces, the list goes on. Many of these “deficiencies” amount to assets that rural areas may be able to turn into future opportunities. For example Dr. Larry Swanson, a rural sociologist, originally from Nebraska and now at the University of Montana, made the point that young people, like his twenty‐ something sons, are <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>looking</b> <b>for</b> places to move that have amenities because “they can’t afford to buy a house in western Montana. ” By “amenities” he is speaking of rivers, the wide open spaces, big skies and lush prairies, mountains, lakes, forests, and wildlife. Rural Nebraska offers many of the amenities his sons and others like them are seeking. We rank 10 th in stream miles nationally, we have pine forests in the West and beautiful broadleaf trees in the Northeast and Southeast, expansive prairies with the Sandhills being the largest, and abundant wildlife. At least some of these enterprising young people who might consider Nebraska as they search for new roots will bring their ownjobs with them or create them when they settle down. Retirees are another group who look for affordable places with amenities that offer an enjoyable lifestyle. Yet to appeal to these potential future rural Nebraskans we need to be planning long term to insure that the basics that underie any successful community are built and maintained. I’m talking about the broad category of infrastructure...|$|E

40|$|There {{is a lot}} of philosophically {{interesting}} {{work being}} done in the borderlands between traditional and formal epistemology. It <b>is</b> easy <b>to</b> think that this would all be one-way traffic. When we try to formalise a traditional theory, we see that its hidden assumptions are inconsistent or otherwise untenable.

Either way, the formalist teaches the traditionalist a lesson about what the live epistemological options <b>are.</b> I want <b>to</b> argue, more or less by example, that the traffic here should be twoway.

We isolate a property — properness over diamonds — that implies λ + is preserved and show that this property is preserved by λ–support iterations. Our condition is a relative of that presented in [1]; {{it is not clear}} if the two conditions are equivalent. We close with an application of our technology by presenting a consistency result on uniformizing colorings of ladder systems on {δ < λ +: cf(δ) = λ} that complements a theorem of Shelah in [3]. 1. Definitions One of the mysteries of iterated forcing theory is the lack of a good solution to the following “equation ” for an uncountable regular cardinal λ: proper forcing countable support iteration = x λ–support iteration. The goal of this paper <b>is</b> <b>to</b> present a generalization of properness to the context of larger cardinals. We make no claim that ours is the “right ” generalization; however, the proof that our condition is preserved by λ–support iteration <b>is</b> close <b>to</b> the proof that properness is preserved by countable support iteration and seems quite natural. Throughout this paper, we make the following assumptions: • λ is a regular cardinal satisfying λ = λ <λ. • D is a normal filter on λ “with diamonds”, i. e., for every S ∈ D +, there is a sequence 〈Aδ: δ ∈ S 〉 such that for every A ⊆ λ, {δ ∈ S: A ∩ δ = Aδ} ∈ D +. • χ is a regular cardinal that is “large enough”.

[...] "We were just, in general, getting started for the road-building season this week and it seems as though his truck <b>was</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> needed. It <b>looked</b> like he <b>was</b> doing some maintenance on it", Amorello said in a telephone interview. [...] "I found him under the truck. There's not much more I can say. I dialed 911 and that's all I could do." ...|$|R
5000|$|According to Mario, [...] "it's {{a little}} bit of {{everything}} on this record. That’s why I love it. Sean is like a brother to me. He knows me. So, when he did this record, he was definitely thinking about me. It’s a club record and every man has experienced this situation before. It’s like why would you want to break up with me when you gon’ get the same thing with the next man. But, he ain’t gon do it as fly as I can. I can’t wait to perform it. It’s <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> a movie. <b>Look</b> for the movie! We’re not calling this a single or a video, we’re calling it a movie." ...|$|R
5000|$|... "I {{had just}} gone through an {{experience}} that made me write this song about like knowing the second you see someone like, 'Oh, this <b>is</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> interesting. It's <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> dangerous, but <b>look</b> at me going in there anyway... I think that for me, {{it was the first}} time I ever kind of noticed that in myself, like when you are curious about something you know might be bad for you, but you know that you <b>are</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> go for it anyway because if you don't, you'll have greater regrets about not seeing where that would go, but I think that for me it all went along with this record that was pushing boundaries, like the sound of this record pushes boundaries, it was writing about something I hadn't written before." ...|$|R
60|$|They {{made their}} way towards a small clump of trees, near which a fair-sized crowd {{had already begun to}} collect. Evidently {{listening}} <b>to</b> the speakers <b>was</b> one of Clapham's fashionable Sunday amusements. Mr Waller talked and gesticulated incessantly as he walked. Psmith's demeanour was perhaps a shade patronizing, but he displayed interest. Mike proceeded to the meeting with the air of an about-to-be-washed dog. He was loathing the whole business with a heartiness worthy of a better cause. Somehow, he felt he <b>was</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> made <b>to</b> <b>look</b> a fool before the afternoon was over. But he registered a vow that nothing should drag him on to the small platform which had been erected {{for the benefit of the}} speaker.|$|R
6000|$|... "Temperament be damned!" [...] was the forcible reply. [...] "I {{have done}} my best. When you've said those four words, Tallente, any man {{ought to have}} {{philosophy}} enough to add, 'Whatever the result may <b>be,</b> it isn't <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> my funeral.' <b>Look</b> at you--haggard, losing weight every day, poring over papers, scheming, planning, writing articles, pouring out the great gift of your life {{twice as fast as}} you need. No one will thank you for it. It's quite enough to give half your soul and the joy of living to work for others. Keep something up your sleeve for yourself, Tallente. Mark you, that's the soundest thing in twentieth century philosophy you'll ever hear of.--Corner of Clarges Street right for you, eh?" ...|$|R

Speaking of the broader progress under his administration, Obama stated, [...] "I believe that one day, we’re <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> able <b>to</b> <b>look</b> back on these years and say that this was a turning point. This was the moment when we began to build a strong middle class in Indian Country; the moment when businesses, large and small, began opening up in reservations; the moment when we stopped repeating the mistakes of the past, and began building a better future together, one that honors old traditions and welcomes every Native American into the American Dream." ...|$|R
