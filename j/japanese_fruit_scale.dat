40|$|In fleshy fruits, the {{variability}} of cell morphology at the <b>fruit</b> <b>scale</b> is largely unknown. It presents both a huge variability and {{a high level of}} organization. Better knowledge of cell morphology heterogeneity within the fruit is necessary to understand fruit development, to model fruit mechanical behaviour, or to investigate variations of physico-chemical measurements. A generic approach is proposed to build cartographies of cell morphology at the <b>fruit</b> <b>scale,</b> which depict regions corresponding to different cell morphologies. The approach is based on: (1) sampling the whole fruit at known positions; (2) imaging and quantifying local cell morphology; (3) pooling measurements to take biological variability into account and (4) projecting results in a morphology model of the whole fruit. The result is a synthetic representation of cell morphology variations within the whole fruit. The method was applied to the characterization of cell morphology in tomato pericarp. Two different imaging scales that provided complementary descriptions were used: 3 D confocal microscopy and macroscopy. The approach is generic and can be adapted to other fruits or other products...|$|R

40|$|This study {{analyzes}} {{the competitiveness of}} countries exporting fruit juices into Japan through market structure analysis (MSA) {{within the context of}} the theory of consumer demand using the relative price version of the Rotterdam model and the block-wise dependent uniform substitute Rotterdam model. The models were estimated for six different types of fruit juices (orange, grapefruit, other citrus, apple, pineapple and grape juices imported from 18 countries) on monthly per capita data over the period December, 1995, to May, 2005, using the non-linear least squares (LSQ) in the Time Series Processor (TSP) program. Results indicate that the market structure underlying the competition for the <b>Japanese</b> <b>fruit</b> juice market is non-uniformly competitive, and most of the cross price elasticities are below one. Consequently, an exporter cant take market share from another exporter quickly through price reductions. Nonetheless, the United States and the Philippines appear to have a competitive advantage in the export of orange and pineapple juices, respectively. Brazil has the most to gain from an increase in the size of the <b>Japanese</b> <b>fruit</b> juice market. The demand for fruit juices imported into Japan is projected to increase at a decreasing rate over the next decade or so because of the absolute decline in population growth. The results of the study have important implications to countries exporting fruit juices to Japan for making marketing strategies such as price reduction, product differentiation as well as export supply plan.

40|$|Light {{distribution}} within {{fruit trees}} {{has a major}} influence on the distribution of fruit quality and diseases. A method for estimating light partitioning at the intra-tree canopy scale is presented. It is based on the three-dimensional (3 D) reconstruction of the tree canopy at the organ scale. First, the trees are 3 D-digitised with a magnetic device at current-year shoot scale. Second, shoot foliage is 3 D-reconstructed by using allometric relationships and leaf angle distributions built from sampled shoot digitising at leaf scale. Third, false colours are attributed to plant components, e. g., shoot types, in order to distinguish them on the virtual plant images. Fourth, orchard scenes are created with a coloured target tree at the centre and black neighbour trees shading the target tree. Fifth, images of the virtual scene are created with view directions set to those of the light sources, namely according to the sun course for direct radiation and a set of sampled directions over the sky hemisphere for diffuse radiation. Sixth, light interception by each coloured plant component is computed from processing the scene images, namely coloured pixels counts. The method was used with eighteen 13 -year-old Golden Delicious apple trees trained in vertical axis, ycare and drilling systems. Light interception was computed at <b>fruit</b> <b>scale</b> (using one colour per fruit). As an indirect validation of the method, simulated fruit irradiance was related to actual fruit sugar content. At the individual <b>fruit</b> <b>scale,</b> r² coefficients were about 0. 3 – 0. 4. After grouping fruits in irradiance classes, r² coefficients were mostly above 0. 85. The method was therefore found suitable for estimating light distribution within fruit trees...|$|R

Tomato pericarp was used as a model for fleshy <b>fruits.</b> Two different <b>scales</b> were investigated through 3 D imaging using confocal microscopy, and macroscopy imaging of pericarp slices. The morphology of the tomato pericarp was assessed (1) from 3 D microscopy images through stereological estimation of cell wall surface area and (2) from greyscale granulometry computed with mathematical morphology. Spatial heterogeneity within pericarp was described by measuring the morphology for different regions of interest within the whole fruit and for each characterisation method. This resulted in cartography of the cellular structure at the scale of the fruit; either by cell wall surface area estimate or by grey level mean size. Both methods presented complementary results, and made it possible to compare results obtained at different scales...|$|R

40|$|In 2006, Japan {{was one of}} {{the markets}} that contributed to the 4 million dollars live bee sales in Australia. In 2007, the export of queen honey bee from Australia was {{suspended}} when Nosema apis was detected in the nurse bees that were escorting the queens during a quarantine inspection off the Japanese ports. Nosemosis or nosema is a worldwide endemic disease caused by N. apis. Infected bees have reduced life span, energy, productivity, and develop deformed glands. As a result of this suspension, many <b>Japanese</b> <b>fruit</b> farmers had to hand pollinate many of their crops while Australian beekeepers suffered financial losses from the loss of trade. Thus, it will be extremely beneficial for both Japanese and Australian farmers if nosema-free nurse bees could be produced and used as escort nurse bees. Two novel approaches of producing nosema-free bees are proposed: (1) treating infected nurse bees with heat therapy and (2) raising newly hatched nurse bees (HNB) in isolation of infected hives. These approaches may produce nosema-free escort nurse bees. Escort nurse bees feed royal jelly to queen bees in cages during the export journey, thus it is essential that HNB can synthesize and secrete royal jelly. This means that HNB need to develop functional hypopharyngeal glands (HG) in order to secrete royal jelly. Proteins found in pollen are said to be 100...|$|R

40|$|Background and Aims Fruit {{temperature}} {{results from}} a complex system involving the climate, the tree architecture, the fruit location within the tree crown and the fruit thermal properties. Despite much theoretical and experimental evidence for large differences (up to 10 degrees C in sunny conditions) between fruit temperature and air temperature, fruit temperature is never used in horticultural studies. A way of modelling fruit-temperature dynamics from climate data is addressed in this work. Methods The model is based upon three-dimensional virtual representation of apple trees and links three-dimensional virtual trees with a physical-based fruit-temperature dynamical model. The overall model was assessed by comparing model outputs to field measures of fruit-temperature dynamics. Key Results The model was able to simulate both the temperature dynamics at <b>fruit</b> <b>scale,</b> i. e. fruit-temperature gradients and departure from air temperature, and at the tree scale, i. e. the within-tree-crown variability in fruit temperature (average {{root mean square error}} value over fruits was 1. 43 degrees C). Conclusions This study shows that linking virtual plants with the modelling of the physical plant environment offers a relevant framework to address the modelling of fruit-temperature dynamics within a tree canopy. The proposed model offers opportunities for modelling effects of the within-crown architecture on fruit thermal responses in horticultural studies...|$|R

Salacca belongs to the subfamily Lepidocaryoideae of Palmae, which is distinguished by its large <b>fruit</b> <b>scales.</b> As one {{of the results of the}} present study I could observe that the early development of these scales takes place in the epidermal cells of the young ovaries. The Lepidocaryoideae are furthermore distinguished by the position of their ovules. In Palms there is one axillary basal ovule in each locule. Usually the ovules are ascendent and anatropous, the micropylae facing the dorsal walls of the locules. In Lepidocaryoideae, however, the micropylae face the central column of the ovary. Uhl & Moore (1971), who recently published a morphological study on the Palm gynoecium, think that the ovules in this group have turned 180 degrees. These authors studied Plectocomiopsis geminiflorus, and their results are very similar to mine in Salacca.

40|$|Fruit development, {{from its}} early stages, {{is the result}} of a complex network of {{interacting}} processes, at different scales. These include cell division, cell expansion but also nutrient transports from the plant and exchanges with the environment. In the presence of nutrients limitation, in particular, the plant reacts as whole, by modifying its architecture, metabolism and reproductive strategy, determining the resources available for fruits development, which in turn affects the overall source-sink balance of the system. Here we present an integrated model of tomato that explicitly accounts for early developmental changes (from cell division to harvest), and use it to investigate the impact of water deficit and carbon limitation on nutrient fluxes and fruit growth, in both dry and fresh mass. Variability in fruit response is analyzed at two different scales: among trusses, at the plant level and within the cells population, at the <b>fruit</b> <b>scale.</b> Results show that the effect of stress on individual cells strongly depends on their age, size and uptake capabilities and that the timing of stress application, together with the fruit position on the plant, is crucial to determine the final phenotypic outcome. Water deficit and carbon depletion impacted either source size, source activity or sink strength with contrasted effects on fruit growth. An important prediction of the model is the major role of symplasmic transport of carbon in early stage of fruit development, as a catalyst of cells and fruit growth...|$|R

40|$|Includes bibliographical {{references}} (pages 132 - 137) The {{history of}} the Japanese who lived in Placer County, California, is both similar to and {{very different from the}} story of other Japanese Americans {{in the first half of}} the twentieth century. Placer County Japanese Americans came early in the century and bought or leased the land on which they planted deciduous fruit trees. The nature of their crop gave them a large investment of time, labor, and capital in their farms. As a result, they were a more settled population early in the century than were most other Japanese Americans. The Placer County Japanese were known to their white neighbors and engaged in community activities to a degree uncommon in other locations. So when the anti-Japanese movement arose, it found less support among Placer County whites than in other parts of the state. When World War II came, Placer County whites were slow to call for the removal of their neighbors. Within months, however, the Japanese of Placer County were shipped off to concentration camps along with other Japanese Americans. Because their farms were so productive of key fruits for feeding the American people and the troops, the United States government spent huge sums to help white replacement farmers keep the farms going, to the point of helping white business people form corporations specifically to take over <b>Japanese</b> <b>fruit</b> orchards. After the war, the reaction that returning Japanese Americans found was mixed. Although they had been part of the fabric of Placer County life before they were interned, now they were the targets of several violent incidents.

40|$|In our {{previous}} chemical {{study of the}} production mechanism of black tea polyphenols, we demonstrated that <b>Japanese</b> pear <b>fruit</b> homogenate oxidizes green tea catechins bearing pyrogallol-type and catechol-type B-rings to produce theaflavins and dehydrotheasinensins. In contrast, unripe fruit homogenate of Citrus unshiu selectively oxidizes pyrogallol-type catechins to yield only dehydrotheasinensins. The difference in the selectivity of the two homogenates is probably related to the lower redox potential of pyrogallol-type catechins. The oxidation of epigallocatechin with C. unshiu homogenate gave two new compounds, including an ethanol adduct of an oolongtheanin precursor and epigallocatechin 4 ′-O-rutinoside, together with theasinensin C, dehydrotheasinensin E, and desgalloyl oolongtheanin.
