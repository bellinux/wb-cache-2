The 1st Battalion, 5th Infantry, never succeeded in gaining complete possession of the southern parts of Sobuk-san, which would have given observation into the valley below and into the North Koreans' rear areas. The instability of the 24th Infantry made it necessary for Kean to order Throckmorton to send his only regimental reserve, E Company, north into the 24th Infantry sector along the Haman road to protect the right flank of the 5th Regimental Combat Team. In this position, E Company collected stragglers from the 24th Infantry every night and the next morning sent them back to their units. The US Navy then entered the battle {{in this part of the}} line, its destroyers standing off the south coast gave illumination at night by directing their searchlights against low-hanging clouds on Sobuk-san.

A {{subset of}} neurons in the rat limbic system encodes head direction (HD) by selectively discharging when the rat points its {{head in a}} preferred direction in the horizontal plane. The preferred <b>firing</b> <b>direction</b> is sensitive {{to the location of}} landmark cues, as well as idiothetic or self-motion cues (i. e., vestibular, motor efference copy, proprioception, and optic flow).

This study repeated this experiment and manipulated the idiothetic cues available to the rat as it moved between the familiar and novel environment. Motor efference copy/proprioceptive cues were disrupted by passively transporting the animal between the familiar and novel environment.

40|$|Head {{direction}} (HD) cells signal HD in {{the horizontal}} plane in a body-external (allothetic) frame of reference, {{and are a}} critical neural component of spatial cognition. This thesis uses computational modelling to investigate their properties. HD cell preferred <b>firing</b> <b>directions</b> are influenced depending on the discrepancy between sources of directional information, with allothetic information dominating up to a critical discrepancy and body-internal (idiothetic) information dominating after this. A computational mechanism is outlined which is capable of replicating these discrepancy-dependent changes in preferred <b>firing</b> <b>direction.</b> This mechanism depends on dynamic changes in HD cell responses to allothetic information and is shown {{to be affected by}} salience, defined as {{the degree to which a}} landmark has been previously experienced as a stable source of directional information. This model is then built on by providing a mechanism explaining how the preferred <b>firing</b> <b>directions</b> of any two given HD cells maintain their angular separation following idiothetic-allothetic discrepancies, a property known as isomapping. The accuracy of HD system updating solely via idiothetic information (path integration) in examined a model system. Two major limiting factors are found: the time neurons take to respond to stimulation, and the presence of direct reciprocal connectivity between HD cells. Finally a neural network model, based on known physiology, which does not incorporate direct HD to HD connectivity is proposed. This model is demonstrated to be capable of extremely accurate path integration. </p...|$|R
25|$|Röth did {{not enjoy}} any success as a fighter pilot until he decided to {{concentrate}} his effort on observation balloons. He was a poor shot, and took up firing upon balloons because they were a large target. He also loaded his guns to maximize his effectiveness against balloons; his left-hand machine gun would be loaded with 80 percent incendiaries and 20 percent armor-piercing, and the right-hand gun vice versa. His decision meant he took upon himself {{one of the most}} hazardous duties of World War I fighter aviation. Because balloons flew at a known altitude, antiaircraft guns ringing them were extremely accurate. The balloons were low enough that an attacker was exposed to small arms fire as well. Protective fighters also lurked in the vicinity. The balloons were so well defended because they were {{an important part of the}} artillery <b>fire</b> <b>direction</b> systems of World War I.|$|E
25|$|An {{important}} {{advance in}} analog computing was {{the development of}} the first fire-control systems for long range ship gunlaying. When gunnery ranges increased dramatically in the late 19th century it was no longer a simple matter of calculating the proper aim point, given the flight times of the shells. Various spotters on board the ship would relay distance measures and observations to a central plotting station. There the <b>fire</b> <b>direction</b> teams fed in the location, speed and direction of the ship and its target, as well as various adjustments for Coriolis effect, weather effects on the air, and other adjustments; the computer would then output a firing solution, which would be fed to the turrets for laying. In 1912, British engineer Arthur Pollen developed the first electrically powered mechanical analogue computer (called at the time the Argo Clock). It was used by the Imperial Russian Navy in World War I. The alternative Dreyer Table fire control system was fitted to British capital ships by mid-1916.|$|E

40|$|Successful {{navigation}} {{requires a}} constantly updated neural representation of directional heading, which is conveyed by head direction (HD) cells. The HD signal is predominantly controlled by visual landmarks, but when familiar landmarks are unavailable, self-motion cues {{are able to}} control the HD signal via path integration. Previous studies of the relationship between HD cell activity and path integration have been limited to two or more arenas located in the same room, a drawback for interpretation because the same visual cues may have been perceptible across arenas. To address this issue, we tested the relationship between HD cell activity and path integration by recording HD cells while rats navigated within a 14 -unit T-maze and in a multiroom maze that consisted of unique arenas that were located in different rooms but connected by a passageway. In the 14 -unit T-maze, the HD signal remained relatively stable between the start and goal boxes, with the preferred <b>firing</b> <b>directions</b> usually shifting < 45 ° during maze traversal. In the multiroom maze in light, the preferred <b>firing</b> <b>directions</b> also remained relatively constant between rooms, but with greater variability than in the 14 -unit maze.

Work began on 6 January 1956. Although described as only an extended refit, the cost was substantial for this large middle aged cruiser, 5.5 million pounds [...] Changes included: providing the new twin MK 5 40mm and the twin 4-inch mount with individual MRS8 directors; the 4-inch guns training and elevation speed was increased to 20 degrees a second; and protecting key parts of the ship against nuclear, biological or chemical attack. This last consideration meant significantly enlarging and enclosing her bridge, creating a two-tiered, five-sided superstructure which radically altered her appearance. The most significant change was better accommodations for a smaller crew more fitting of post-war needs, her tripod masts replaced with lattice masts, and timber decking replaced with steel everywhere except the quarterdeck. The overall effect was to create a cruiser significantly more habitable but different internally and to a degree in external appearance from wartime cruisers but only marginally superior in capability from its late-war fit. Belfast recommissioned at Devonport on 12 May 1959.

40|$|Head {{direction}} cells {{signal the}} orientation of the head in the horizontal plane. This thesis shows how some of the known head direction cell response properties might develop through learning. The research methodology employed is the computer simulation of neural network models of head direction cells that self-organize through learning. The preferred <b>firing</b> <b>directions</b> of head direction cells will change in response to the manipulation of distal visual cues, but not in response to the manipulation of proximal visual cues. Simulation results are presented of neural network models that learn to form separate representations of distal and proximal visual cues that are presented simultaneously as visual input to the network. These results demonstrate the computation required for a subpopulation of head direction cells to learn to preferentially respond to distal visual cues. Within a population of head direction cells, the angular distance between the preferred <b>firing</b> <b>directions</b> of any two cells is maintained across different environments. It is shown how a neural network model can learn to maintain the angular distance between the learned preferred <b>firing</b> <b>directions</b> of head direction cells across two different visual training environments. A population of head direction cells can update the population representation of the current head direction, in the absence of visual input, using internal idiothetic (self-generated) motion signals alone. This is called the path integration of head direction. It is important that the head direction cell system updates its internal representation of head direction at the same speed as the animal is rotating its head. Neural network models are simulated that learn to perform the path integration of head direction, using solely idiothetic signals, at the same speed as the head is rotating.

After visual input was eliminated by blindfolding the rats, HD cells maintained direction-specific discharge, but their preferred <b>firing</b> <b>directions</b> became less stable. In addition, rotations of the behavioral apparatus indicated that some nonvisual cues (presumably tactile, olfactory, or both) exerted above chance stimulus control over a cell's preferred <b>firing</b> <b>direction.</b> However, a prominent auditory cue was not effective in exerting stimulus control over a cell's preferred direction.
