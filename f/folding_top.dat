25|$|For 1961 the American line added a four-door station wagon, {{as well as}} a two-door {{convertible}} for {{the first}} time since 1954. It featured a power-operated <b>folding</b> <b>top</b> with roll-down door glass, rather than the fixed side-window frames of the original design. Passenger room increased from five to six.|$|E
25|$|In 1896, {{managing}} director of the Lunéville plant, Adrien, Baron de Turckheim, bought the rights to a design by Amédée Bollée. This used a front-mounted horizontal twin engine with sliding clutches and belt drive. It had a <b>folding</b> <b>top,</b> three acetylene headlights, and, very unusual for the period, plate glass windshield. While the company started out using engines from Bollée, de Dietrich eventually produced the entire vehicle themselves.|$|E
25|$|Entry to most KR models {{except the}} KR201 Sport Roadster and a {{corresponding}} Tg500 version was through a canopy door hinged {{on the right}} side of the vehicle. The door included all the windows (windshield, window frames on all but the Roadster models, <b>folding</b> <b>top</b> on Roadster and Kabrio models, and acrylic bubble on other versions) and the frame in which it was set, extending from the right side of the monocoque tub to the left. On Sport Roadster models, the canopy was fixed and there was neither a top nor any windows at all, only a tonneau cover.|$|E

5000|$|Landaulet—the {{opposite}} {{with the}} rear convertible {{and the front}} closed. Landaulets de ville, or town landaulets, were similar to sedancas de ville but with <b>folding</b> <b>tops</b> on the passenger enclosure instead of fixed tops.|$|R
25|$|Except for the Sports Roadster model, {{entry to}} the Tg500 was through a canopy door hinged {{on the right side}} of the vehicle. The door {{included}} both the windows (windshield, window frames on all but the Roadster models, <b>folding</b> <b>top</b> on Roadster and Kabrio models, and acrylic bubble on other versions) and the frame in which it was set, extending from the right side of the monocoque tub to the left. On Sport Roadster models, the canopy was fixed and there was neither a top nor any windows at all, only a tonneau cover. The bubble top on the Tg500 was the same as the one used on the KR200.|$|E
25|$|A {{prototype}} convertible Sable {{was displayed}} at the 1988 North American International Auto Show, featuring a custom two-door body with a power <b>folding</b> <b>top</b> that was built off a production sedan chassis. It never reached production, and the convertible prototype was sold on eBay in 2006. A high-performance LTS model {{that would be a}} counterpart to the Taurus SHO was also planned but later shelved out of fears that it would create unnecessary internal competition. A special edition Sable commemorating the 50th anniversary of Mercury that was sold in 1989 used the performance chassis developed for the LTS; only 50 of these were produced. The Sable was also extensively used in Ford's Aluminum Intensive Vehicle (AIV) program, which built 20 aluminum-bodied Sables with Taurus SHO V6 engines in an engineering exercise for constructing all-aluminum unit bodies, like that which saw production by Audi in 1994.|$|E
2500|$|For the 1959 model, {{engines and}} {{horsepower}} ratings did not change. Interiors were revised slightly with different instrument graphics {{and the addition}} of a storage bin to the passenger side. A positive reverse lockout shifter with [...] "T" [...] handle was standard with 4-speed manual transmission. This was the only year a turquoise convertible top color could be ordered, and all 24-gallon fuel tank models through 1962 could not be ordered with convertible tops due to inadequate space for the <b>folding</b> <b>top</b> mechanism. Rare options: RPO 684 heavy-duty brakes and suspension (142), RPO 686 metallic brakes (333), RPO 276 15"×5.5" [...] wheels (214), RPO 426 power windows (547), RPO 473 power convertible top (661).|$|E
50|$|A smaller, side entrance, Model C with a {{detachable}} tonneau was {{priced at}} $2,000. It had a four-cylinder engine rated at 18-20 horsepower. The company also produced canopy and <b>folding</b> <b>tops</b> {{for an additional}} cost.|$|R

50|$|In {{molecular}} biology, the ASF1 like histone chaperone {{family of}} proteins includes the yeast and human ASF1 proteins. These proteins have histone chaperone activity. ASF1 participates {{in both the}} replication-dependent and replication-independent pathways. The three-dimensional structure has been determined as a compact immunoglobulin-like beta sandwich <b>fold</b> <b>topped</b> by three helical linkers.|$|R
2500|$|The 1975 {{model was}} advertised as [...] "a more {{efficient}} Corvette," [...] as service intervals were extended and electronic ignition and the federally mandated catalytic converter were introduced with [...] "unleaded fuel only" [...] warnings on the fuel gauge and filler door. Dual exhaust pipes were routed {{to a single}} converter, then split again leading to dual mufflers and tailpipes. Starting this year, tachometers were electronically driven. The Corvette began {{to be influenced by}} the metric system as speedometers now displayed small subfaces indicating kilometers-per-hour. 75's featured revised inner bumper systems with molded front and rear simulated bumper guards. The urethane rear bumper, now in its second year, reappeared as a one-piece seamless unit. This was the final year for Astro Ventilation. Power bottomed out this year — the base engine produced only [...] and the only remaining optional motor, the L-82, dropped an astonishing , managing to deliver [...] With no larger engine available, L-82 hood emblems began to appear on cars so equipped. Unchanged was the standard rear axle ratio for the base engine, which remained at 3.08 with automatic and 3.36 with manual transmission. This was the last convertible for the 1968-82 third-generation and only 12% of the cars were ordered as such. As in previous years, a <b>folding</b> <b>top</b> came standard with roadsters and a body color or vinyl covered hardtop was optional at additional cost. Anticipating further federal safety restrictions, Chevrolet believed it would be Corvette's last soft-top model ever but the convertible returned in 1986. Due to the state’s strict emissions standards, this was the last year Chevrolet installed the L-82 engine in a Corvette destined for California.|$|E
2500|$|For 1968, {{both the}} Corvette body and {{interior}} were completely redesigned. As before, {{the car was}} available in either coupe or convertible models, but coupe was now a notchback fitted with a near-vertical removable rear window and removable roof panels (T-tops). A soft <b>folding</b> <b>top</b> was included with convertibles, while an auxiliary hardtop with a glass rear window was offered at additional cost. Included with coupes were hold down straps {{and a pair of}} vinyl bags to store the roof panels, and above the luggage area was a rear window stowage tray. The enduring new body's concealed headlights moved into position via a vacuum operated system rather than electrically as on the previous generation, and the new hide-away windshield wipers utilized a problematic vacuum door. The door handles were flush with the top of the doors with a separate release button. Front fenders had functional engine cooling vents. Side vent windows were eliminated from all models, replaced with [...] "Astro Ventilation", a fresh air circulation system. In the cabin, a large round speedometer and matching tachometer were positioned in front of the driver. Auxiliary gauges were clustered above the forward end of the console and included oil pressure, water temperature, ammeter, fuel gauge, and an analog clock. A fiber-optic system appeared on the console that monitored exterior lights and there was no glove box. The battery was relocated from the engine area to one of three compartments behind the seats to improve weight distribution. New options included a rear window defroster, anti-theft alarm system, bright metal wheel covers, and an AM-FM Stereo radio. All cars ordered with a radio, like the C2 cars, continued to be fitted with chrome-plated ignition shielding covering the distributor to reduce interference.|$|E

50|$|The {{earliest}} roadster automobiles {{had only}} basic bodies without doors, windshields, or other weather protection. By the 1920s they were appointed similarly to touring cars, with doors, windshields, simple <b>folding</b> <b>tops,</b> and side curtains.

Among the last American-built cars with a rumble seat were the 1938 Chevrolet, the 1939 Ford and 1939 Dodge and Plymouth.The last British built car with a dickey seat was the Triumph 2000 Roadster made until 1949.|$|R
