Murdoch DSO, VCE with the public enquiry commencing on 30 October 1938. Because of the crash, regulations were passed which require <b>flight</b> <b>checking</b> officers to monitor the flights of aeroplanes and advise on such things as position, weather, and alternate landing options. Also implementation of a 33 MHz radio range system was recommended to provide pilots with accurate information on their course.|$|E
50|$|Cottesmore {{was officially}} handed {{back to the}} RAF on 1 July 1945. As a pre-war base with {{permanent}} buildings, {{it was inevitable that}} it would not remain vacant for long. Cottesmore again became a training station. In 1954 English Electric Canberras were moved in, the first time front-line combat aircraft had been based there, but all had left by the end of 1955.In 1957 it was announced that Cottesmore would become a base for aircraft of the V bomber force, carriers of Britain's nuclear deterrent. The squadrons carried out Quick Reaction Alert duties using Handley Page Victor and later Avro Vulcan bombers, until 1969. When they left the base was used by 90 Signals Group. <b>Flight</b> <b>Checking,</b> Trials and Evaluation Flight (FCTEF) used 98 Squadron (Canberras) and 115 Squadron (Varsity and Argosy) to provide ILS and radar trials and checking services to RAF airfields around the world. No. 231 Operational Conversion Unit moved into Cottesmore on 19 May 1969 equipped with Canberras, staying until 12 February 1976 when it moved to RAF Marham.|$|E

40|$|Operations {{control is}} one of the most {{important}} areas for an airline company. Through operations control mechanisms an airline company monitors all the <b>flights</b> <b>checking</b> if they follow the schedule that was previously defined by other areas of the company. Unfortunately, some problems may arise during this stage (Clausen et al., 2005). Those problems can be related with crewmembers, aircrafts and passengers. The Airline Operations Control Centre (AOCC) includes teams of experts specialized in solving the above problems under the supervision of an operation control manager. Each team has a specific goal contributing to the common and general goal of having the airline operation running under as few problems as possible. The process of solving these kinds of problems is known as Disruption Management (Kohl et al., 2004) or Operations Recovery...|$|R
50|$|Málaga Airport {{has three}} terminals, {{adjacent}} to each other. There {{is also a}} General Aviation Terminal and a Cargo Terminal. The Airport consists of three piers or docks used by airlines: Pier B (with 13 gates, 7 with airbridges), Pier C (with 10 gates, 7 with airbridges) and Pier D (with 20 gates, 12 with airbridges). Pier B is used for non-European traffic, Pier C is used by non-Schengen Traffic and Pier D is used for Schengen Traffic. Flights to the UK and Ireland use both Pier B and Pier C. EasyJet, EasyJet Switzerland & Ryanair <b>flights</b> <b>check</b> in at Terminal 2 whilst all others use Terminal 3.

During the 15 years of operation of this facility there have been various opportunities to compare wind tunnel and flight test results. Some of these opportunities arise from routine <b>flight</b> <b>checks</b> of the prototype, others from carefully designed comparative wind tunnel and flight experiments. Data obtained from various sources is presented. The topics covered are: gust and buffet response, control surface effectiveness, flutter, and active control of aeroelastic effects. Some benefits and shortcomings of Freon- 12 as a test medium are also discussed. Although areas of uncertainly are evident and there is a continuing need for improvements in model simulation and testing techniques, the results indicate that predictions from aeroelastic model tests are, in general, substantiated by full scale flight tests...|$|R
