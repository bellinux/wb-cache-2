Removable stove switch <b>knobs,</b> <b>locks</b> on kitchen cabinets, electric kettles with automatic shut-off, and adding lighting to eliminate shadows in the house can all help caregivers to reduce dangers to the person with Alzheimer disease. Other features that can improve the well-being of the elderly person can include marking doors with conspicuous and distinct signs or objects such as ribbons or wreaths, can assist memory. Adding a cot or bed to the main floor of the house to allow the elderly person to rest without climbing stairs to a bedroom can be helpful to the Alzheimer patient. Furniture and clutter can also be removed to make the house more safe for an elderly person inclined to pace or wander.|$|R

50|$|When in firing position, {{the mortar}} tube is {{attached}} to the bipod by a clamp. It then is fastened to the base plate by the insertion of the spherical knob on the base cap into the socket on the plate and rotating the mortar 90 degrees right or left. The tube is smooth bored, and its interior surface is carefully finished. Tolerance between the wall of the tube and the bourrelet of the shell is very close, thus preventing the shell from striking the firing pin with sufficient percussion to detonate the primer. On its outside surface the tube has a sighting line and quadrant seat at the muzzle end. The base cap of the tube is hollowed and threaded to screw onto the breech end of the tube which it thereby seals against gas leakage. The cap terminates in a spherical <b>knob,</b> which <b>locks</b> into the socket of the base plate and is bored and is threaded axially to receive the firing pin and the base cap plug.|$|R
50|$|Mindset had dual {{front-mounted}} ROM cartridge ports with a <b>locking</b> <b>knob</b> on {{the left}} side of the main computer module to lock the ROM modules into place. The Mindset had the option (through its System Configuration Utility) to be able to select whether the system booted from left or right ROM carts, or disk drive. Cartridges could also contain CMOS RAM, which would be retained when unplugged by a battery in the cartridge case. Cartridges were envisioned to be a primary medium for software distribution on the Mindset, but sales of the system were too low for cartridges to be economical, and software was distributed on disk instead.|$|R
5000|$|In {{addition}} to the Jazzmaster, the floating tremolo was used on the then top-of-the-line Fender Jaguar guitars, released in 1962, and also on the Fender Bass VI, released in 1961. Jaguar and Jazzmasters share the same bridge plate and string saddles, though Jaguar bridges (and the earliest Jazzmaster bridges) have taller [...] "legs". The two are functionally interchangeable and replacement parts for each {{are one and the}} same. The Bass VI bridge has a wider plate and longer intonation screws to allow the bass strings to be correctly intonated, and the saddles have threads cut for larger diameter strings. There have also been a small number of not very notable imitations by other makers, generally without the <b>locking</b> <b>knob.</b> Fender discontinued all floating tremolo models by 1980, but reintroduced both the Jazzmaster and Jaguar first as Japanese models in the mid 1980s, then as American-made reissues in the 1990s. The tremolo-equipped Bass VI was reintroduced as a US Custom Shop model in 2006.|$|R
2500|$|Because of {{the high}} {{centrifugal}} forces encountered during drifting, drivers are usually retained by a racing seat and five-point harness. This allows the hands to merely turn the wheel, instead of bracing {{the body in the}} seat. The same applies for the feet, which are free to move rapidly between clutch, brake and accelerator pedals. The steering wheel is usually relatively small, dished, and perfectly round, {{so that it can be}} released and allowed to spin through the hands as the caster returns the front wheels to center. The <b>locking</b> <b>knob</b> on the hand brake is usually replaced with a spin turn knob; this stops the hand brake locking on when pulled. Nearly all drivers move the hand brake location or add an extra hydraulic hand brake actuator for greater braking force. Additional gauges used to monitor boost levels, oil pressure and temperature, intake and coolant temperatures, air-fuel ratio (also called λ, or [...] "lambda" [...] ratio), etc. Some drivers, especially in larger cars, move the seating position for a better weight distribution, such as Daigo Saito's 2014 JZX100 Mk.II Chaser.|$|R

The wood was elaborately carved. I cannot recall the pattern. As I scrutinised it, the stock oscillated up and down, and crumpled up. The metallic plate sank inwards: and the stock contracted so that it looked not unlike a tuning-fork (2). I gave up the stock and proceeded cautiously to examine the lock. I got it well into view, but no more of the gun. It {{turned out to be}} an old-fashioned flint-lock. It immediately began to nod backwards and forwards in a manner suggestive of the beak of a bird pecking. Consequently it forthwith became converted into the head of a bird with a long curved beak, the <b>knob</b> on the <b>lock</b> (3) becoming the head of the bird.

40|$|A simple, effective, easy-to-use device <b>locks</b> {{a control}} <b>knob</b> {{in a set}} position. In the initial {{application}} for which this device was conceived, the control <b>knob</b> to be <b>locked</b> {{is that of a}} needle valve. Previously, in that application, it was necessary for one technician to hold the knob to keep the valve at the desired flow setting while another technician secured the valve with safety wire [...] a time-consuming procedure. After attachment of the wire, it was still possible to turn the knob somewhat. In contrast, a single technician using the present device can secure the knob in the desired position. in about 30 seconds, and the knob cannot thereafter be turned, even in the presence of harsh vibrations, which occur during space shuttle launch. The device includes a special-purpose clamp that fits around the control knob and its shaft and that can be tightened onto the knob, without turning the knob, by means of two thumbscrews. The end of the device opposite the clamp is a tang that contains a slot that, in turn, engages a bolt that protrudes from the panel on which the control knob and its shaft are mounted...|$|R
40|$|A {{device for}} {{attaching}} an experiment carrier to {{a space station}} handrail is provided. The device has two major components, a clamping mechanism for attachment to a space station handrail, and a pointing carrier on which an experiment package can be mounted and oriented. The handrail clamp uses an overcenter mechanism and the carrier mechanism uses an adjustable preload ball and socket for carrier positioning. The handrail clamp uses a stack of disk springs to provide a spring loaded button. This configuration provides consistent clamping force over a range of possible handrail thicknesses. Three load points are incorporated in the clamping mechanism thereby spreading the clamping load onto three separate points on the handrail. A four bar linkage is used to provide for a single actuation lever for all three load points. For additional safety, a secondary lock consisting of a capture plate and push lock keeps the clamp attached to the handrail {{in the event of}} main clamp failure. For the carrier positioning mechanism, a ball in a spring loaded socket uses friction to provide locking torque; however. the ball and socket are torque limited so that the ball ran slip under kick loads (125 pounds or greater). A lead screw attached to disk spring stacks is used to provide an adjustable spring force on the socket. A <b>locking</b> <b>knob</b> is attached to the lead screw to allow for hand manipulation of the lead screw...|$|R

In the history of thousand of years human beings, {{one of the most}} important objectives of is constructing the naturalhabitation based on their needs. Just like all the living things in nature, mankind also effort a lot to protect themselves from thenatural envoirement conditions. In the history of residence which originated with the humanitarian history, starting from thedwellings carved into the rocks, the residence culture brought from Central Asia survived at the residence of Ottoman era and thevery best samples of Turkish Residence Architecture builted during this age. Residental Architecture in late period of OttamanEmpire has gained a new dimension with the foreign decoration style. The traditional identity shaped by the cultural values brought from Central Asia that are melted togetwer with the severalcultures in Anatolia as well as the the influence of Islam. The urban architecture and ornamentation effected by the provincialcapital style has never been studied so far. The folk architecture has survived as a matter of distictive subject. Our study of OldTurkish Houses covers Ilvat and neighborhood villages also consist of the village houses in Buyuk Ilvat, Belen Ilvat, Bucak Ilvatand Sarihacilar. The regional houses,feature more traditional characteristic, are explored and evaluated for the first time with this studyemerged as the best samples of folk architectured displayed. The houses in our study evaluated by taking into considerataion the material, construction technique, project and ornamentstyles. The main raw material in the construction of these regional housed are stone and timber. Metals as raw metarial is notcommon. Metals can be seen on window fences, door <b>knobs,</b> <b>lock</b> and hinges. Brick almost never used at any houses explored. The top cover of the houses are Turkish Style roof tiles. The plaster used in coating the oven and the fixture of illuminant. The soil only used in grout which is no longer available. The building structures constructed by the matarials widely available in theregion. While all the walls in the house builted with the groutless dry wall technique that is wooden beams mounted between therubble stones and compressed peşdunavs, in the resort part of the houses wooden curtain walls can be seen. The upper cover ofthe house is pitched roof and coated with Turkish Style roof tiles. Carriers such as console units, hands in hips and wooden pillarsused in the ascent, eaves, restrooms and summerhouses. Soil and Stone furnishings can be seen in the courtyard and ground floorof the house whereas the upper floors completely made of timber. Almost all the doors of the houses in the region made ofwooden. The courtyard and main entences doors are double-winged, room doors are single and multilayer. The sighseeingwindows of the regional houses are latticed inside and shuttered outside. The room Windows ar evice versa (latticed outside andshuttered inside). The connection between the floors done by the wooden stairways. The houses in Akseki Ilvat and Sarihacilar village can be classified into three groups according to project types. As well as the climate and natural conditions the influential folk architecture has a great effect on formation of the projecttypes. The basic spaces form the project are hall and the rooms. The first type houses are the most comman ones with outer hall. Those houses are also divided into 2 groups as ouetr hall with eyvan and outer hall without eyvan. Ouetr hall with eyvan projecttype houses are generally constructed by highly welfared individuals and regulated for crowded families. Compared to the otherhouses the number of rooms and the ornamentary increased. Second type houses are the ones with iner halls. Third types are theones with middle hall. The last two types are not comman in practice in the region. The execution of those two project types areseen only in one sample. Generally the basic element forms the front-line in the region is the overhangs. These overhangs areembodied according the direction of the halls. Can be grouped as overhangs on the right, overhangs on the left and overhangs inthe middle acording to the location of the averhangs based on the enterence door. The overhangs are carried by wooden pillarsand hand in hips. The cover of the overhangs are laid with tiles regardless of the roof. The windows of the overhangs aregenerally latticed with outer shutter. The windows of the overhangs decareted with lattices are distinguished with different typesof lattices. Some lattices divided into four trays and an observation window is built. Some lattices are built complete and there areskylight windows above. Room windows are rectangular lattice form and shuttered inside. The double-wing and multilayerenterence door of the houses placed under the overhangs. Eaves of the houses is made of timber and the outside ornaments areplain. One of the important element in the front-line is the chimneys. The chimneys are squared stone masonry and conical hat. The summerhouses is another element that activates the front-line. The summerhouses are open air places that are carried bywooden pillars. In the explored houses the interior decoration has wider application area, the outside ornament is more modest. The outerornament is concentrated on overhangs and windows, the interior ornament can be seen on pavilion, room doors, ceilings,cupboards and wardrobes as an accurate samples. Almost every room of the regional houses has a cupboard closet. Generally the top of the cupboard and closets are divided bytimber trays and the inside of the trays left blank. The bigger houses constructed by higher income individuals the timber trays ofcupborad and closet are filled with herbal charesteristic decorative motives. In interior decoration specifically the room doors has accurate ornament features. These single-wing doors are divided bytimber trays on top. The insdie of the timber trays are decorated by geometric and herbal forms ornament motives. Just like in the cupboards there is timber tray ornament in the open cabinets in the top of the rooms. The inside of the traysare sometimes kept blank and sometimes decorated with rose motifs and four leaf clover. One of the most important areas in theornament of the room is ceilings. The room ceilings in the regional houses are generally flat timber with lower hammerset. A hubin the shape of eight or rarely six armed star form placed in the middle of the ceiling which is perpendicularly divided to squaresby timber laths. In the middle of the hub there are motives of eight armed star narrowing throught the center, branch and rarelystylized tulip. In the center heaven fruit pomegranate, the symbol of abundance and blessing, appliquied as embossed. It can beseen ellips and round ceilings in some houses, howevere the comman ones are the flat ceilings hubbed with eight armed star. Round ceilings generally filled with timber strips in a shape of sun disc motive. When compared to plain and sloppy constructed urban houses, the regional houses built highly ornate and elaborate. Althought the regional houses are a product of folk architecture, refletcs the capital fashion in project type, front line allignment,glamorious and ornaments. The main reason is because of the finacial power and the status of the owners. The local craftsmen,lived in the region and experinced the capital fashion, had a great role in evolving this synthesis architecture. Houses mostlyconstructed in early 20. Centuryare being restored along with the Akseki-Ibradi Disctrict Development Plan. The restored housedare really in good conditions. Only the repairs done by the owners do not resulted succesfully. Those repiars cause the loss oforiginality. Nowadays, those houses, especially the non resident ones, which have great importance in Traditional ResidentArchitecture are abandoned to the wild circumtances of nature...|$|R
