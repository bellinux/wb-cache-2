5|$|From left {{to right}} across the four blocks of the long- or 32-column form of the {{periodic}} table {{are a series of}} linking or bridging groups of elements, located approximately between each block. These groups, like the metalloids, show properties in between, or that are a mixture of, groups to either side. Chemically, the group 3 elements, scandium, yttrium, lanthanum and actinium behave largely like the alkaline earth metals or, more generally, s block metals but have some of the physical properties of d block transition metals. Lutetium and lawrencium, {{at the end of the}} end of the f block, may constitute another linking or bridging group. Lutetium behaves chemically as a lanthanide but shows a mix of lanthanide and transition metal physical properties. Lawrencium, as an analogue of lutetium, would presumable display like characteristics. The coinage metals <b>in</b> <b>group</b> 11 (copper, silver, and gold) are chemically capable of acting as either transition metals or main group metals. The volatile group 12 metals, zinc, cadmium and mercury are sometimes regarded as linking the d block to the p block. Notionally they are d block elements but they have few transition metal properties and are more like their p block neighbors <b>in</b> <b>group</b> 13. The relatively inert noble gases, <b>in</b> <b>group</b> 18, bridge the most reactive groups of elements in the periodic table—the halogens <b>in</b> <b>group</b> 17 and the alkali metals <b>in</b> <b>group</b> 1.|$|E
40|$|Recent theorizing and {{research}} {{has attempted to}} explicate the functions of moods and emotions within small <b>groups.</b> <b>In</b> this paper, we examine these areas and suggest that affect <b>in</b> <b>groups,</b> as well as specific mechanisms to regulate and maintain certain affective states <b>in</b> <b>groups,</b> have had important roles <b>in</b> promoting <b>group</b> survival over evolutionary history. Specifically, we suggest that affect <b>in</b> <b>groups</b> serves a coordination function, which can take one of two forms. First, affect <b>in</b> <b>groups</b> quickly provides information about the environment and group structure to other group members, thus coordinating group activity via a communication function. Second, shared affect <b>in</b> <b>groups</b> coordinates group activity through fostering group bonds and group loyalty. These two functions of affect <b>in</b> <b>groups</b> are closely related and mutually reinforcing. Current research and {{directions for future research}} within an evolutionary perspective are also discussed...|$|R

5|$|In 1871, Dmitri Mendeleev {{predicted}} {{the existence of}} an element between thorium and uranium. The actinide element group was unknown at the time.

For a long time chemists searched for eka-tantalum as an element with similar chemical properties to tantalum, making a discovery of protactinium nearly impossible. Tantalum's heavier analogue was later found to be the transuranic element dubnium.|$|E

40|$|Not only animals, {{plants and}} {{microbes}} but also humans cooperate <b>in</b> <b>groups.</b> The evolution of cooperation <b>in</b> a <b>group</b> is an evolutionary puzzle, because defectors always obtain a higher benefit than cooperators. When people participate <b>in</b> a <b>group,</b> they evaluate group member’s reputations and then {{decide whether to}} participate in it. <b>In</b> some <b>groups,</b> membership {{is open to all}} who are willing to participate <b>in</b> the <b>group.</b> <b>In</b> other <b>groups,</b> a candidate is excluded from membership if group members regard the candidate’s reputation as bad. We developed an evolutionary game model and investigated how participation <b>in</b> <b>groups</b> and ostracism influence the evolution of cooperation <b>in</b> <b>groups</b> when group members play the voluntary public goods game, by means of computer simulation. When group membership is open to all candidates and those candidates can decide whether to participate <b>in</b> a <b>group,</b> cooperation cannot be sustainable. However, cooperation is sustainable when a candidate cannot be a member unless all group members admit them to membership. Therefore, it is not participation <b>in</b> a <b>group</b> but rather ostracism, which functions as costless punishment on defectors, that is essential to sustain cooperation in the voluntary public goods game...|$|R
