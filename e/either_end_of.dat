5|$|Occasionally, Ganapati and {{his brother}} Kartikeya (Kumara, Subramanya) or the saktis, the female counterparts, {{can be found at}} <b>either</b> <b>end</b> <b>of</b> this carving. Carvings of the river Goddesses Ganga and Yamuna are found at <b>either</b> <b>end</b> <b>of</b> the foot of the doorway to the shrine in early temples.|$|E
5|$|At {{the final}} whistle, Barcelona manager Pep Guardiola offered his commiserations {{to each of}} Manchester United's players, while former Manchester United defender Gerard Piqué talked with his {{erstwhile}} teammates. Both teams then retreated to <b>either</b> <b>end</b> <b>of</b> the stadium to applaud their fans.|$|E
5|$|No light armor {{was fitted}} above the main belt or at <b>either</b> <b>end</b> <b>of</b> the ship. This made Texas highly {{vulnerable}} to rapid-fire guns using high-explosive shells. This {{was not considered}} a significant threat at the time Texas was designed but would become so within a few years.|$|E

5|$|The older {{part of the}} brick-built hall {{consists}} of seven bays, over two floors. There are projecting bays at <b>either</b> <b>end</b> <b>of</b> the building, dressed with ashlar quoins. A central doorway is flanked with plain pilasters, also of ashlar. The roof is of a hipped design, with a central octagonal bellcote, topped by a small dome.|$|E
5|$|M-34 was {{designated}} and {{signed with the}} beginning of the state highway system around July1, 1919, along a route that extended to <b>either</b> <b>end</b> <b>of</b> its current routing. These western and eastern extensions were added to other highways during the 1920s, shortening M-34 to roughly its current length. A few more changes were made in the mid-1950s and 1960s resulting in the modern routing. M-34 has a short, unsigned sibling, Connector 34, which is better known as Industrial Drive in the Adrian area.|$|E
5|$|Representations of the Virgin and John the Evangelist flank Christ {{in small}} {{rectangular}} panels at <b>either</b> <b>end</b> <b>of</b> his outstretched arms. Both are dark-skinned, and bear agonised and sorrowful expressions as they rest their heads {{on their hands}} and face inwards towards Christ. In keeping with the Franciscan idea, the gilding surrounding the mourning saints is kept to a minimum. The size and positions of the figures are reduced compared to usual Byzantine iconography to maintain sole focus on the passion of Christ.|$|E

50|$|Due to {{the unique}} {{configuration}} of the tracks on <b>either</b> <b>ends</b> <b>of</b> the station, trains can depart from any platform in any direction when necessary (mostly seen in peak time or disruptions).|$|R
50|$|The two big tanks Honnamanakere(formerly LakshmiSamudra) and Nachanahallikere(formerly KeshavaSamudra)situated at the <b>either</b> <b>ends</b> <b>of</b> {{the village}} also have {{historical}} importance. The annual cart festival for the Village deity Honnadevi takes place every {{year during the}} spring.|$|R
5|$|The {{building}} was substantially altered in 1835 by architect Sydney Smirke. In {{order to provide}} more space, he added blocks at <b>either</b> <b>end</b> <b>of</b> the frontage, and galleried wings {{on either side of}} the central portion. He also added a small single-storey lodge, still in existence, at the Lambeth Road gate. Later, between 1844–46, the central cupola was replaced with a copper-clad dome in order to expand the chapel beneath. The building also featured a theatre in a building to the rear of the site.|$|E
5|$|The highway {{was built}} in the 1850s as part of the Opeongo and Ottawa Colonization Road, {{providing}} access to Renfrew County for settlement in the Opeongo Hills. However, it did not become a provincial highway until 1956. Aside from the change in number of the highways at <b>either</b> <b>end</b> <b>of</b> the route, the route has remained the same since then.|$|E
5|$|After the US127 interchange, I-75 turns northward, {{and passes}} {{to the east}} of Grayling. There are a pair of {{interchanges}} on <b>either</b> <b>end</b> <b>of</b> town for BL I-75, and the southern one is a partial interchange; only northbound I-75 traffic may access the business loop and traffic entering the freeway may only access southbound I-75. There is no interchange further north for M-72; access to that highway is provided through the business loop. On the north side of Grayling, there is a full interchange for BL I-75/M-93 that provides the southbound I-75 connection to M-72 as well as access from both directions to the Hartwick Pines State Park.|$|E
50|$|CMBT {{station is}} one of the five {{stations}} in {{the first phase of the}} Chennai Metro project identified to be converted into commercial hubs, the others being Alandur, Arumbakkam, Ekkattuthangal, and Ashok Nagar.

5000|$|The {{station has}} two {{high-level}} side platforms. The north platform, {{next to the}} main track, is 12 cars long. The south platform, next to the siding, is eight cars long, and is not in use. There is also a pedestrian bridge connecting the two platforms. [...] On <b>either</b> <b>ends</b> <b>of</b> the station, the two tracks merge into one.|$|R
5|$|Casualties were {{heaviest}} {{among the}} troops landing at <b>either</b> <b>end</b> <b>of</b> Omaha. In the east at Fox Green and the adjacent stretch of Easy Red, scattered elements of three companies {{were reduced to}} half strength {{by the time they}} gained the relative safety of the shingle, many of them having crawled the 300 yards (270m) of beach just ahead of the incoming tide. Within 15 minutes of landing at Dog Green on the western end of the beach, A/116 had been cut to pieces, the leaders among the 120 or so casualties, the survivors reduced to seeking cover at the water's edge or behind obstacles. The smaller Ranger company to their right had fared a little better, having made the shelter of the bluffs, but were also down to half strength.|$|E
5|$|Due to its nature, {{the episode}} {{featured}} many dangerous stunts utilizing fire. In {{the scene where}} Mulder and L'Ively confront each other at <b>either</b> <b>end</b> <b>of</b> a corridor in the Marsden family home, and L'Ively sets fire to the entire hallway, Mark Sheppard, who played L'Ively, ducked out of the shot {{in order to protect}} himself from the intense heat. The only injury involved in the production was when David Duchovny burned his hand, leaving a small permanent scar. The character of Phoebe Green was considered as a recurring role, but this episode ended up being her only appearance.|$|E
5|$|Each driver {{cell in the}} LIFE {{baseline}} design contained two of the high-density diode arrays {{arranged on}} either side of a large slab of laser glass. The arrays were provided cooling via hook-up pipes at <b>either</b> <b>end</b> <b>of</b> the module. The initial laser pulse was provided by a preamplifier module similar to the one from the NIF, the output of which was switched into the main beamline via a mirror and Pockel's cell optical switch. To maximize the energy deposited into the beam from the laser glass, optical switches were used to send the beam to mirrors to reflect the light through the glass four times, in a fashion similar to NIF. Finally, focussing and optical cleanup was provided by optics {{on either side of}} the glass, before the beam exited the system through a frequency converter at one end.|$|E

The tag arms on this archwire pass on the lingual aspect and hold the retainer wire passively, thus, allowing easy and effective retainer wire stabilization...|$|R
5|$|Each {{platform}} has two same-level fare control areas, one at <b>either</b> <b>end</b> <b>of</b> the station, {{and there}} are no crossovers or crossunders. The full-time ones are at the north end and each has a turnstile bank, token booth, and two street stairs. The ones on the Manhattan-bound platform go up to the northeast and southeast corners of Bergen and Smith Streets while those on the Coney Island-bound platform go up to the northwest and southwest corners. The fare control areas on {{the south end of the}} platforms are unstaffed, containing full height turnstiles and one street stair to the northeast corner of Warren and Smith Streets on the Manhattan-bound platform and the northwest corner for the Coney Island-bound platform. The south fare control area is more heavily used.|$|E
5|$|In October 1963, London Transport ordered five {{double decker}} buses {{based on the}} Ford Thames Trader chassis for special duties, taking cyclists through the Dartford Tunnel. These had a lower deck {{purpose-built}} for carrying bicycles, with upper deck seats for cyclists. Access was via a stairwell to the upper deck starting several feet above {{the level of the}} road, accessible from special platforms built at <b>either</b> <b>end</b> <b>of</b> the tunnel; there was also a ladder built {{into the side of the}} bodywork for access elsewhere. The design was criticised for failing to protect any passenger from falling off the vehicle, and running costs were estimated at £2,550 per month, with only £45 revenue. The service was reduced to one bus in April 1964 and then cancelled in 1965, to be replaced by the current transfer service. One of these buses has been preserved.|$|E
5|$|Mir was {{authorized}} on a 17 February 1976 decree, to design an improved {{model of the}} Salyut DOS-17K space stations. Four Salyut space stations had been launched since 1971, with three more being launched during Mirs development. It was planned that the station's core module (DOS-7 and the backup DOS-8) would be equipped {{with a total of}} four docking ports; two at <b>either</b> <b>end</b> <b>of</b> the station as with the Salyut stations, and an additional two ports on either side of a docking sphere {{at the front of the}} station to enable further modules to expand the station's capabilities. By August 1978, this had evolved to the final configuration of one aft port and five ports in a spherical compartment at the forward end of the station.|$|E
5|$|Four large mosaic {{panels are}} {{installed}} on <b>either</b> <b>ends</b> <b>of</b> the station {{hall and the}} two escalator tunnels. On the side {{that leads to the}} exit to the city, a panel was installed depicting the patron saint of Kiev, Michael the Archangel. Meanwhile, at the very <b>end</b> <b>of</b> the station, Saint George is depicted, symbolizing Moscow, the Soviet Union's capital at the time. One of the mosaic panels at the <b>end</b> <b>of</b> the station near the escalators includes an inscription featuring a Ukrainian nationalist slogan, stating СЛАВА УКРАЇНІ, which is translated as Glory to Ukraine.|$|R

He was {{treated in a}} shoulder immobilizer. The mechanism of injury is postulated as pivoting of the clavicle on the first rib with shearing at <b>either</b> <b>ends</b> leading to a bipolar injury. The brachial plexus and subclavian vessels are at a risk of damage at the pivot as they lie in close vicinity to the first rib. In view of the intact periosteal sleeve as well as joint articulation at both ends, the fracture healed with no functional loss...|$|R

5|$|Opposite the Sir Alex Ferguson Stand is the Sir Bobby Charlton Stand, {{formerly}} Old Trafford's {{main stand}} and previously {{known as the}} South Stand. Although only a single-tiered stand, the Sir Bobby Charlton Stand contains most of the ground's executive suites, and also plays host to any VIPs who may come to watch the match. Members of the media are seated {{in the middle of}} the Upper South Stand to give them the best view of the match. The television gantry is also in the Sir Bobby Charlton Stand, so the Sir Bobby Charlton Stand is the one that gets shown on television least often. Television studios are located at <b>either</b> <b>end</b> <b>of</b> the Sir Bobby Charlton Stand, with the club's in-house television station, MUTV, in the East studio and other television stations, such as the BBC and Sky, in the West studio.|$|E
5|$|Swordfishs diving {{depth and}} time {{are not known}} because the records from her sea trials have not survived. Shutting down her boiler, {{retracting}} the funnel and sealing the boiler uptake required about {{a minute and a}} quarter, which included switching over to the electric motors. In marked contrast to contemporary Vickers designs much attention was paid to safety arrangements, including her extensive subdivision. Indicator and telephone buoys, which could be released from inside the submarine were provided together with external air connections and a charged high-pressure line which could provide air to any manned compartment or the living spaces. Furthermore, the main ballast tanks could be blown from <b>either</b> <b>end</b> <b>of</b> the ship.|$|E
5|$|The castle's {{original}} appearance {{differed significantly}} {{from that of}} today. The arrow-shaped Water Bastion facing into the Medway and the main block behind it {{were part of the}} original design. There were also towers at <b>either</b> <b>end</b> <b>of</b> the water frontage, though these were subsequently replaced by towers of a different design. The gatehouse and moat were later additions. A number of derelict buildings in Rochester Castle, Aylesford, and Bopley were pulled down to provide stone for the castle. The main structure had been completed by 1564, but it took another three years and an infusion of extra funds to finish the project. The total cost came to £4,349.|$|E
