25|$|In March 2010 {{the club}} was {{announced}} as a founder member of the FA WSL. The club's successful application was underwritten by Birmingham City's controversial new owner Carson Yeung. In December 2010, Birmingham City announced the signing of several international players to their WSL squad. In June 2011 the Centre of Excellence's future was secured with the allocation of a new FA licence for 2011–12 season onwards; which realigned the current <b>development</b> <b>pathway</b> for women's football in England.|$|E
25|$|Another floral {{feature that}} has been a subject of natural {{selection}} is flowering time. Some plants flower early in their life cycle, others require a period of vernalization before flowering. This decision is based on factors like temperature, light intensity, presence of pollinators and other environmental signals. In Arabidopsis thaliana it is known that genes like CONSTANS (CO), FRIGIDA, Flowering Locus C (FLC) and FLOWERING LOCUS T (FT) integrate the environmental signals and initiate the flower <b>development</b> <b>pathway.</b> Allelic variation in these loci have been associated with flowering time variations between plants. For example, Arabidopsis thaliana ecotypes that grow in the cold temperate regions require prolonged vernalization before they flower, while the tropical varieties and common lab strains, do not. Much of this variation is due to mutations in the FLC and FRIGIDA genes, rendering them non-functional.|$|E

2500|$|Similar {{capability}} {{was added}} to Tranche 2 aircraft on the main <b>development</b> <b>pathway</b> {{as part of the}} Phase 1 Enhancements. P1Ea (SRP10) entered service in 2013 Q1 and added the use of Paveway IV, EGBU16 and the cannon against surface targets. P1Eb (SRP12) added full integration with GPS bombs such as GBU-10 Paveway II, GBU-16 Paveway II, Paveway IV and a new real-time operating system that allows multiple targets to be attacked in a single run. This new system will form the basis for future weapons integration by individual countries under the Phase 2 Enhancements. The Storm Shadow and KEPD 350 (Taurus) cruise missiles, together with the Meteor Beyond Visual Range Air-to-Air missile flight trials have been successfully completed by January 2016. [...] The Storm Shadow and Meteor firings are part of the Phase 2 Enhancement (P2E) programme which will introduce a range of new and improved long range attack capabilities to Typhoon. Operational testing and evaluation of those capabilities is currently ongoing with the Royal Air Force ahead of entry into service in 2018. In addition to Meteor and Storm Shadow, the first live firing of MBDA’s Brimstone air-to-surface missile, part of the Phase 3 Enhancements (P3E) programme, was successfully completed in July 2017.|$|E

However, changes in <b>development</b> <b>pathways</b> can rarely be imposed from the top. On this basis, examples of energy efficiency opportunities to change <b>development</b> <b>pathways</b> toward lower emissions are presented in this paper. We review opportunities at the sectoral and macro level. The potential for action on nonclimate policies that influence energy use and emissions are presented. Examples are drawn from policies already adopted and implemented in the energy sector. The paper discusses relationships between energy efficiency policies and their synergies and tradeoffs with sustainable development and greenhouse gas emissions. It points to ways that energy efficiency could be mainstreamed into devel?opment choices...|$|R

40|$|Abstract: The {{climate change}} {{research}} community {{is developing a}} toolkit for creating new scenarios to explore and evaluate the extensive uncertainties associated with future climate change and <b>development</b> <b>pathways.</b> Components of the toolkit include pathways for greenhouse gas emissions over this century and their associated magnitude and pattern of climate change; descriptions {{of a range of}} possible socioeconomic <b>development</b> <b>pathways,</b> including qualitative narratives and quantitative elements; and climate change policies to achieve specific levels of radiative forcing and levels of adaptive capacity. These components are combined within a matrix architecture to create a scenario. Five reference socioeconomic <b>development</b> <b>pathways</b> have been described along axes describing increasing socioeconomic and environmental challenges to adaptation and to mitigation. This paper extends these global pathways to describe their possible consequences for public health and health care, and considers the additional elements that could be added to increase the relevance of the new scenarios to address a wider range of policy relevant questions than previously possible...|$|R

40|$|The role {{of energy}} {{sources in the}} c choice of {{industrial}} <b>development</b> <b>pathways</b> has not been widely acknowledged outside the energy literature. Indeed, as oil prices rise, traditional fossil fuel-intensive industrial <b>development</b> <b>pathways</b> now imperil <b>development</b> prospects around the world. As energy security becomes a major issue, developing countries have everything to lose by simply following fossil-fuel based industrialization, and everything to gain by recasting their development strategies around the prospects for renewable energies and biofuels. This paper argues that the time is therefore ripe for developing countries to re-evaluate their stance on renewable energy sources generally, and on biofuels in particular.

30|$|The {{difference}} in opportunity {{provided by the}} two road options {{is due to the}} assumed constraints of the minor road development. Referring to the pathway analysis in Figure  4, we are reminded that while the barrier and rail developments can be commissioned with only minor road developments, an airport would need more major developments to support the surface access demands of passengers. The minor road <b>developments</b> <b>pathways</b> therefore lack both the airport impacts and system effects from the airport interacting with the other elements, significantly changing its opportunity value compared to the major road <b>development</b> <b>pathways.</b>|$|R
