40|$|Abstract. Lymph nodes were {{collected}} at biopsy or necropsy from 18 cats with naturally acquired symp-tomatic feline immunodeficiency virus (FIV) infection and from 18 seronegative cats. Thirty-five of the cats were <b>domestic</b> <b>shorthairs</b> {{and one was}} a Persian cross. The cats ranged from 7 months to 16 {{years of age and}} were mainly obtained from California veterinary practitioners, a California cattery, and a Veterinary Teaching Hospital. Based on clinical signs present at tissue collection, ten FIV-infected cats fell into the acquired im-munodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) -related complex (ARC) clinical stage and eight in the terminal (AIDS) stage of FIV disease. All cats were FeLV negative by antigen ELISA. Histologic sections of lymph nodes from each cat were examined blindly and were categorized as hyperplastic, involuting, mixed hyperplastic and involuting, depleted, or normal based upon subjective evaluation of follicles and paracortex. The relative abundance of plasma cells was evaluated in methyl green pyronin (MGP) and hematoxylin and eosin-stained sections. Similar numbers of FIV-seropositive and-seronegative cats fell into each lymph node category. The only difference evident between FIV-infected cats and control cats was in the degree of plasmacytosis present; moderate to marked plasmacytosis was present in 13 / 18 FIV-infected cats but in only 3 / 18 control cats. Immunohisto-chemical staining of frozen lymph node sections from six FIV-infected cats and 12 control cats for CD 4, CD 8, Factor VIII-related antigen, and a B cell/follicular dendritic cell-specific (CD 2 1 -like) antigen revealed only...|$|R
50|$|In TICA outcrossing has mainly {{been with}} the {{domestic}} short-haired cat and domestic long-haired cat, although registration rules do allow other breeds to be used and bred down from towards the F3 generation which is eligible for entry in TICA cat shows. When undertaking outcross matings to non-pedigrees, reputable breeders seek out cats closely resembling the correct LaPerm body type with coats which are not overly thick. This practice continues {{the use of the}} kind of cats which composed much of the original foundation stock for the breed and helps to maintain genetic health by using the widest gene pool available. However, in some countries, such as the UK, it is illegal to sell the kittens from such matings as pedigrees because of the Trades Description Act 1968 through which it has been established that the legal definition of a pedigree cat in the UK is one with a fully recorded three-generation pedigree. After outcrossing to a cat of unknown parentage, at least three generations must be bred to establish a full pedigree record. In Cat Fanciers' Association (CFA) breeders used the Ocicat for a two-year period, terminating on 1 May 2002; LaPerms registered during this period were permitted to have an Ocicat parent, and by extension, one or two Abyssinian grandparents, as the Abyssinian is an approved outcross of the Ocicat. Currently CFA breeders may only use non-pedigree domestic cats and after 2020 no outcrosses will be permitted in CFA. However, CFA accepts LaPerms for both breeding and showing with other breeds in their pedigrees if they are imported from another registry.The GCCF has the most strict of the registration policies and only LaPerms with a full three generation pedigree (i.e. parents, grandparents and great-grandparents) of only LaPerm to LaPerm breeding are permitted on the full register. Only LaPerms or cats from a list of approved breeds are permmitted in the 4th and 5th generations. Cats with non-approved breeds anywhere within their five-generation pedigrees, particularly those with other rex genes or non-pedigree cats with unknown genotype, cannot be registered as LaPerms. In order not to cause any damaging restriction to the breed's genepool a supplementary register also exists for the registration of LaPerms bred as part of an outcross breeding program. LaPerms can only be registered on the supplementary register if within their five generation pedigrees only LaPerms and cats from the approved outcross list are present. In the GCCF this list comprises the Somali/Abyssinian, Asian/Tiffanie/(European)Burmese, Ocicat and Tonkinese. <b>Domestic</b> <b>Shorthairs</b> and <b>Domestic</b> Longhairs can be used in outcrossing but certain restrictions apply and the initial offspring are placed on the reference register and cannot be shown. There was also a rather small amount of use of the Old Style Siamese/Balinese/Oriental during the initial development phase of the UK breeding program, and a cutoff date for use of these breeds was built into the breeding and registration policies. In other registries the approved list (with some slight variations) is used for outcrossing and cats of unknown parentage are not permitted. In FIFe, which has its most active LaPerm breeders in Sweden and the Netherlands, outcrossing is done on a case by case basis. In antipodean countries, Somalis, Tiffanies and Orientals have also been used, but <b>Domestic</b> <b>Shorthairs</b> and <b>Domestic</b> Longhairs are now the preferred choice of outcross.|$|R

There are no longer any permitted domestic out-crosses for the Savannah breed now that TICA championship status has been achieved.

50|$|Although the official, {{permissible}} outcrosses for the Chausie breed are the Abyssinian and the <b>domestic</b> <b>shorthair</b> (no recognizable breed), {{in practice}} {{any kind of}} purely domestic outcross can be used. TICA rules only dictate that cats must be {{a certain number of}} generations removed from the jungle cat ancestors and have three generations of registered Chausie ancestors to be eligible for competition at shows. Consequently, a variety of breeds, albeit usually lively outgoing breeds (see below), were used to develop the Chausie breed and continue to be used occasionally as outcrosses. This has given the breed a diverse and healthy genetic foundation.|$|E
50|$|The {{effort to}} produce a Siamese-style pointed cat in colors other than the {{traditional}} four began in England and in America in the 1940s, carried out by breeders who used foundation crossings between the Siamese, Abyssinian, and the red <b>domestic</b> <b>shorthair.</b> The American Shorthair also {{became part of the}} matrix. Initially, the Colorpoint breeders experienced setbacks and failures; in the effort to achieve the proper colors in the proper places, the Siamese body type was often sacrificed.

The breed is accepted by all North American cat registries. Originally {{known as the}} <b>Domestic</b> <b>Shorthair,</b> the breed was renamed in 1906 to the [...] "American Shorthair" [...] to better represent its [...] "all-American" [...] origins and to differentiate it from other shorthaired breeds.

5000|$|The Governing Council of the Cat Fancy (GCCF) is a cat registry, {{established}} in 1910 {{and the largest}} organisation that registers pedigree cats in the United Kingdom. It was formed from {{a small number of}} cat clubs which were registering cats at the time when the modern cat fancy was in its first stages. It is considered to be the original prototype for cat fancy registries. It is an independent body with around 150 member clubs, including specialist breed clubs and area clubs covering particular regions. The GCCF became an incorporated company on 5 November 2010. It licenses cat shows put on by its affiliated clubs with about 135 shows per year. Pedigree cats shown at these shows can gain the titles Champion, Grand Champion, Imperial Grand Champion and Olympian. The latter having three levels, Bronze, Silver and Gold. The word Champion is replaced by Premier for neutered cats. The showing of non-pedigree cats (often referred to as <b>Domestic</b> <b>shorthair</b> and Domestic longhair) and Pedigree Pets is also popular at GCCF shows.|$|E
