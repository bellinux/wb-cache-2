40|$|Introduction. Multifocal choroidopathy syndromes are a {{group of}} rare disorders, which involve a primary {{pathologic}} process occurring {{at or near the}} level of the retinal pigment epithelium, with or without choriocapillaris involvement. The aetiology of multifocal choroidopathy syndrome is still unknown. A case report. We present a case of multifocal choroidopathy syndrome. A 54 -year-old woman was referred to our department with blurred vision on both eyes, mild ocular pain, accompanied by metamorphopsia, floaters, scotomas and photopsia. The anterior segment examination showed small to medium size keratic precipitates, posterior synechiae, and iris atrophy. Mild to moderate aqueous inflammation with cells and flair was present in the anterior chamber. The fundus examination showed multiple small yellow-white spots, round-shaped changes located {{at the level of the}} retinal pigment epithelium and choriocapillaris. According to the fluorescein angiography the active lesions exhibited blockage of the early choroidal fluorescence followed by late staining. The old inactive lesions corresponded to the retinal pigment epithelium windows defects. The laboratory examination showed high level of blood glucose, C reactive protein, cholesterol HDL, LDL, triglycerides. According to the immunological examination the C 3 component of complement was lower (0. 630), as well as the C 4 component of complement (0. 158), and the immunological complex in blood was elevated (171). ELIZA test on viral infection showed Citomegalo viruses IgG positive, Herpes Simplex Virus IgG positive, Varichela Zoster Virus IgG positive. The results of <b>human</b> <b>leucocyte</b> <b>antigen</b> typization were <b>human</b> <b>leucocyte</b> <b>antigen</b> A 1 :A 2, <b>human</b> <b>leucocyte</b> <b>antigen</b> A 2 :A 24 (9), <b>human</b> <b>leucocyte</b> <b>antigen</b> B 1 :B 44 (12), <b>human</b> <b>leucocyte</b> <b>antigen</b> B 2 :B 60 (40), <b>human</b> <b>leucocyte</b> <b>antigen</b> C 1 :Cw 3, <b>human</b> <b>leucocyte</b> <b>antigen</b> C 2 :Cw 5.

These studies used several hepatic tumour-derived cell lines as in vitro model systems. The cell lines included PLC/PRF/ 5 (Alexander cell line), Hep 3 B, HepG 2, TONG PHC, HA 22 T/VGH, HA 59 T/VGH and Mahlavu. The cell lines K 562 and Raji were used as negative and positive controls, respectively. K 562, a B lymphoid-derived cell line, was shown to express negligible amounts of human leucocyte antigens, while Raji, an erythromyeloid-derived cell line, expressed both class I and class II human leucocyte antigens {{as well as their}} respective invariant chains, beta 2 -microglobulin and Ii. Using an ELISA, experiments performed on these cell lines confirmed the natural expression of class I and class II antigens by the HA 22 T/VGH and HA 59 T/VGH cell lines, whereas PLC/PRF/ 5 displayed class II surface antigens only. The effects of modulating agents such as interferon-gamma sodium butyrate and clofazimine on <b>human</b> <b>leucocyte</b> <b>antigen</b> expression were investigated using the HA 22 T/VGH, HA 59 T/VGH and TONG PHC cell lines.

Selection from multiple pathogens simultaneously could explain why the evolutionary signatures of particular pathogens on HLAs have proved elusive. Here, we present an individual-based model of HLA evolution in the presence of two mortality-causing pathogens. We demonstrate that it is likely that individual pathogen species causing high mortality have left recognizable signatures on the HLA genomic region, despite more than one pathogen being present. Such signatures are likely to exist at the whole-population level, and involve haplotypic combinations of HLA genes rather than single loci...|$|R
50|$|General {{research}} in antibodies, agglutination, and anemia {{continued in the}} years following this 1958 paper. In 1962, Dausset published an examination of the correlation between leuco-agglutination and skin graft tolerance, his first observation of the antigens’ impact on histocompatibility. His next paper on the subject was published in 1964, when he observed a clear relationship between <b>leucocyte</b> <b>antigen</b> compatibility and antibody response to skin grafts. This finding sparked a flurry of {{research in}} the topic of histocompatibility, {{and by the end of}} 1965 Dausset had published over a dozen papers exploring <b>leucocyte</b> <b>antigens</b> and their relevance to histocompatibility. After identifying that a two-allele <b>leucocyte</b> <b>antigen</b> group had an influence on histocompatibility and observing the induction of hyper-sensitivity to skin grafts following injection of leucocyte fractions, Dausset developed a system for grouping <b>leucocyte</b> <b>antigens</b> on the basis of histocompatibility. Following this, he put forth the hypothesis that all known <b>leucocyte</b> <b>antigens</b> were part of a single complex, a complex which he named Hu-1. This complex would later become known as one of the Major Histocompatibility Complexes (MHC), specifically those termed <b>Human</b> <b>Leucocyte</b> <b>Antigens</b> (HLA). Dausset’s further work in 1965 examining the effects of Hu-1 antigen injection on skin graft rejection further confirmed the conclusion that this Hu-1 complex was indeed a transplantation antigen, a conclusion which would in time have profound effects on the transplantation process.|$|R
