25|$|The <b>hyperbaric</b> <b>atmosphere</b> in the {{accommodation}} {{chambers and}} the bell are controlled {{to ensure that}} the risk of long term adverse effects on the divers is acceptably low. Most saturation diving is done on heliox mixtures, with partial pressure of oxygen in accommodation areas kept around 0.40 to 0.48 bar, which is near the upper limit for long term exposure. Carbon dioxide is removed from the chamber gas by recycling it through scrubber cartridges. The levels are generally limited to a maximum of 0.005 bar partial pressure, equivalent to 0.5% surface equivalent. Most of the balance is helium, {{with a small amount of}} nitrogen and trace residuals from the air in the system before compression.|$|E
40|$|The {{hydrostatic}} {{hyperbaric chamber}} (HHC) represents {{the merger of}} several technologies in development for NASA aerospace applications, harnessed to directly benefit global health. NASA has significant experience developing composite hyperbaric chambers {{for a variety of}} applications, including the treatment of medical conditions. NASA also has researched the application of water-filled vessels to increase tolerance of acceleration forces. The combination of these two applications has resulted in the hydrostatic chamber, which has been conceived as a safe, affordable means of making hyperbaric oxygen therapy available in the developing world for the treatment of a variety of medical conditions. Specifically, hyperbaric oxygen therapy is highly-desired as a possibly curative treatment for Buruli Ulcer, an infectious condition that afflicts children in sub-Saharan Africa. Hyperbaric oxygen therapy is simply too expensive and too dangerous to implement in the developing world using standard equipment. The hydrostatic hyperbaric chamber technology changes the paradigm. The HHC differs from standard hyperbaric chambers in that the majority of its volume is filled with water which is pressurized by oxygen being supplied in the portion of the chamber containing the patient s head. This greatly reduces the amount of oxygen required to sustain a <b>hyperbaric</b> <b>atmosphere,</b> thereby making the system more safe and economical to operate. An effort was taken to develop an HHC system to apply HBOT to children that is simple and robust enough to support transport, assembly, maintenance and operation in developing countries. This paper details the concept for an HHC ventilation and pressurization system that will provide controlled pressurization of the system, and provide adequate washout of carbon dioxide while the subject is enclosed in the confined space during the administration of the medical treatment. The concept took into consideration operational complexity, safety to the patient and operating personnel, and physiological considerations. The simple schematic, comprised of easily acquired commercial hardware, supports sustainability...|$|E
40|$|To {{examine the}} weight loss of {{hyperbaric}} helium-oxygen habitation, {{the exchange of}} liquids and calories was measured in six men who lived in this atmosphere for 32 d. The maximum pressure was 49. 5 ATA. The men lost 3. 7 - 10. 1 kg, in spite of warm ambient (31 - 32 C) temperatures and adequate calories (2, 737 kcal/d) provided for the sedentary ways of chamber living. Weight loss and a calculated fluid deficit were accompanied by significant hemoconcentration, shown by increases in serum proteins. These changes were followed by a rise in urinary aldosterone and vasopressin, but not thirst. Weight loss in <b>hyperbaric</b> <b>atmospheres</b> is probably multifactorial, but the data suggests an uncoupling of normal osmoregulation may have occured in the present set of subjects. This {{may have been due}} to altered lung mechanics, increased catecholamines, or effects of high pressure on cellular responses to vasopressin...|$|R
40|$|Increase in air or oxygen {{pressure}} in microbial cell cultures can cause oxidative stress and consequently affect cell physiology and morphology. The behaviour of Saccharomyces cerevisiae grown under <b>hyperbaric</b> <b>atmospheres</b> {{of air and}} pure oxygen was studied. A limit of 1. 0 MPa for the air pressure increase (i. e. 0. 21 MPa of oxygen partial pressure) in a fed-batch culture of S. cerevisiae was established. Values of 1. 5 MPa air pressure and 0. 32 MPa pure {{oxygen pressure}} strongly inhibited the metabolic activity and {{the viability of the}} cells. Also, morphological changes were observed, especially cell-size distribution and the genealogical age profile. Pressure caused cell compression and an increase in number of aged cells. These effects were attributed to oxygen toxicity since similar results were obtained using air or oxygen, if oxygen partial pressure was equal to or higher than 0. 32 MPa. The activity of the antioxidant enzymes, catalase and superoxide dismutase (SOD) (cytosolic and mitochondrial isoformes) indicated that the enzymes have different roles in oxidative stress cell protection, depending on other factors that affect the cell physiological state...|$|R
40|$|This {{purpose of}} this {{investigation}} was to develop a methods for the determination of trace level VOCs present in offshore hyperbaric diving environments using Thermal Desorption Gas Chromatography-Mass Spectrometry. As the hyperbaric chambers would usually be onboard a ship, the sampling and transportation of samples would be in cylinders rather than canisters or sorbent tubes.   The sensitivity of the method had to be greater than methods for normobaric occupational exposure, as a chamber pressure was typically ten times normal atmospheric pressure and the divers were continuously exposed to all the VOCs present in the atmosphere. To reduce background contamination, cleaning procedures were put in place for both Tenax tubes and sampling cylinders.   The performance of the Tenax tubes, the recovery from cylinders and GC-MS were investigated systematically using standards, CRM and environmental samples. This ensured that results determined were both qualitative and quantitative. The cylinder sampling experiments had shown that electropolished cylinders were quantitative for all types of trace VOC gas mixtures, while the Teflon lined and sand-blasted cyclinders showed reasonable recoveries for humid samples, like those of hyperbaric but low recoveries for dry gas mixtures. The VOC concentrations present in <b>hyperbaric</b> <b>atmospheres</b> were typically ten times those found in normobaric work environments, in the range of 50 - 300 mg/m 3 for living chambers. Many compounds had been detected, including benzene, toluene, substituted aromatics, alkanes, chloroform, trichloroethylene and even compounds like pinene or limonene.   In general all locations showed levels well below their HOELs or OELs. The method was also adapted to determine VOCs present in atmospheres by Tenax tube diffusive sampling. These experiments showed clearly that the method could be used for detection of VOCs in occupational environments and also urban air environments if required.

40|$|The {{effect of}} {{hyperbaric}} hyperoxia on the acylation of membrane phospholipid was studied {{by measuring the}} rates of activation of exogenous tritiated oleic acid to acyl thioester and of transesterification of the thioester into membrane phospholipids in intact human erythrocytes obtained 1 h after an exposure of the subjects to a <b>hyperbaric</b> oxygen <b>atmosphere</b> (3. 5 h, 100 pct O 2, 3 ATA). Exposure to pure oxygen was found to inhibit both the acylation and transesterification reactions by more than 30 percent, with partial recovery detected 24 h later. On the other hand, no rate changes were observed when isolated membranes from the same batches of cells were used in similar experiments. It is suggested that the decrease in the incorporation of tritiated oleic acid after hyperbaric hyperoxia may reflect an early event in the pathogenesis of oxygen-induced cellular injury and {{that it may be}} a useful index for the assessment of the tolerance of tissues to hyperoxia...|$|R
40|$|When {{delivered}} to the corneal surface of rabbits or monkeys, 100 % oxygen can significantly increase the pO 2 in the aqueous humor. Under <b>hyperbaric</b> conditions (two <b>atmospheres),</b> an observed rise in the aqueous pO 2 in rabbits breathing room air can be increased further by exposing the rabbit cornea to 100 % oxygen. The high oxygen levels under hyperbaric conditions are mediated by intravascular and transcorneal delivery of oxygen. The increase in the pO 2 levels in the aqueous can prevent sickling of intracameral human erythrocytes containing sickle hemoglobin. Thus, oxygen therapy transcorneally or systemically could potentially be used to treat a sickle cell hyphema. The exposure of rabbit eyes to 100 % oxygen at the corneal surface is followed by autoregulation (constriction) of the iris vasculature. We could demonstrate no constriction {{in the eyes of}} two normal human volunteers or of four patients with chronic stable rubeosis iridis. Preretinal vitreous pO 2 levels can be significantly raised by exposing monkeys to hyperbaric 100 % oxygen. This procedure may be of value in treating acute, reversible ischemic inner retinal diseases. Transcorneal or vascular delivery of oxygen to the eye under normobaric or hyperbaric conditions may be effective in treating ischemic diseases of the anterior segment, such as anterior segment necrosis or rubeosis iridis, or ischemic inner retinal diseases...|$|R
40|$|The renal {{preservation}} with hypothermic (4 ℃) perfusion under normobaric or <b>hyperbaric</b> oxygen (2 <b>atmospheres)</b> {{has been}} performed. The preservation times were 6 hours and 12 hours. In order to study {{function of the}} preserved canine kidney, the extracorporeal circulation method was used. The normobaric preserved kidneys were compared with the hyperbaric preserved kidneys in respect to the direct renal blood flow (DRBF), PAH or STS extraction ratio (E-PAH or E-STS), PAH or STS clearance (C-PAH or C-STS), C-STS/C-PAH, the total renal resistance (TRR) and the histological findings. The pattern of renal blood flow during perfusion was investigated adding three nerve blocking agents to the perfusate by renal microangiography. Results: 1) DRBF of the normobaric preserved kidney {{was more than that}} of the hyperbaric preserved one. 2) E-P AH and E-STS of the hyperbaric preserved kidney were higher than that of the normobaric preserved one, however C-PAH and C-STS of the latter were higher than those of the former. 3) The tubular function decreased eminently compared with the glomerular function. 4) TRR of the normobaric preserved kidney was lower than that of the hyperbaric preserved one. 5) On histological findings, no difference between the normobaric and hyperbaric preserved kidney was observed at 6 hours, but the former had more severe damage compared with the latter at 12 hours. 6) Procaine was most effective to prevent the spasm of renal vessels during perfusion...|$|R
