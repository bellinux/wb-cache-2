40|$|Due to the {{interdisciplinary}} nature of <b>eco-labelling,</b> {{the sense of}} the phenomenon itself is lost when studied in isolation. With this consideration, a balance of research between practical and theoretical approaches, between environmental sociology, environmental economics, international trade relations, consumer society, sustainability and marketing theory was explored. <b>Eco-labelling</b> has far-reaching ramifications in society, not just in the commercial relationship between producer and consumer, but in socio-cultural norms and values. It combines economic and social forces via the marketplace. The research of this paper focuses on 1) the socio-cultural aspects of <b>eco-labelling,</b> 2) the economic incentive which drives <b>eco-labelling</b> and 3) the global institutional structures which influence the <b>eco-labelling</b> dimension. Chapter 1 provides an overview of <b>eco-labelling</b> and introduces ecological modernization, the theoretical foundation of this paper. Chapter 2 is a summary of interviews which were conducted with <b>eco-labelling</b> managers around the world. Chapter 3 analyses the economic impact of <b>eco-labelling,</b> the effects on international trade and the environment, and how <b>eco-labelling</b> affects consumers and producers. Chapter 4 deals with the social context of <b>eco-labelling,</b> and the social paradigms of consumer society and sustainability, merging in the case of ecological modernization. Chapter 5 looks at opportunities and challenges to <b>eco-labelling,</b> and concrete recommendations with respect to the design of <b>eco-labelling</b> programmes are made. <b>Eco-labelling</b> is the only tool which functions within the conflicting social forces of consumer society and sustainability. As a market-based instrument for environmental management that functions within the producer - consumer relationship, <b>eco-labelling</b> {{can be seen as the}} ecological marketisation of consumer society. Best practices in <b>eco-labelling</b> rely on accepting the fundamental market principles combined with social trends. (author´s abstract...|$|R

40|$|<b>Eco-labels</b> and {{certification}} {{are one of}} the many environmental policy tools that have been under scrutiny in recent years. This is because the damages of environmental degradation are becoming more apparent over time. Hence there is a pressure to come up with tools that help solve even small parts of the problem. <b>Eco-labels</b> have been around for over 30 years. However the market, the environment and <b>eco-labels</b> have changed drastically during this period. Moreover, in the last 5 years there has been a sudden increase in <b>eco-labels</b> making them more visible in the market and to the average consumer.

40|$|This article raises certain {{legal and}} policy issues {{arising from the}} use of {{labelling}} for environmental purposes (<b>eco-labels)</b> in international trade, and the implications for market access, particularly for developing country products. Of particular interest are transparency issues relating to the design and implementation of voluntary <b>eco-labelling</b> schemes; the criteria used in the design of <b>eco-labels</b> which increasingly reflects the life cycle of products; and the WTO treatment of <b>eco-labelling.</b> <b>Eco-labelling</b> was identified as a significant area in Agenda 21 (1992) and in Doha Declaration (2001). More recently, the Johannesburg Plan of Implementation (WSSD, 2002) recognises the importance of consumer information related to sustainable consumption and explicitly noted the need to continue work in this area. The financial cost of <b>eco-labelling</b> could be quite high. At the same time, <b>eco-labelling</b> is seen by some as an important element for gaining access to ‘green’ markets. <b>Eco-labels</b> may potentially enhance the terms of trade of those developing countries able to accurately translate the mood of industrialised country consumers into environmentally friendly product development. There are also hopes that <b>eco-labelling</b> could provide new opportunities for attracting capital investment and joint ventures in developing countries, such as Bangladesh. As a least developed country with a big emerging market, Bangladesh needs to {{have a better understanding of}} issues of <b>eco-labelling.</b> Therefore, this paper discusses the challenges and opportunities <b>eco-labelling</b> may create for Bangladesh. ...|$|R

40|$|In the United States and the United Kingdom, {{over the}} last decade major retail chains have {{increasingly}} publicized their efforts to supply sustainably sourced and <b>eco-labelled</b> seafood. Debate exists over the extent of consumer demand for this product. Seafood <b>eco-labels</b> purportedly resolve the information asymmetry between producer and consumer, allowing consumers who care about sustainability to easily find and purchase these products. This paper discusses the idealized model of seafood <b>eco-labelling</b> in promoting sustainability and presents results of US and UK case studies based on consumer interviews and surveys, which found that consumers had often seen one or more seafood <b>eco-labels.</b> Two well-established <b>eco-labels,</b> dolphin-safe and organic, drove these rates of sustainable seafood awareness. These rates are interpreted in the context of consumer’s understanding of sustainable. The Sustainable Seafood Movement’s efforts to increase the supply of <b>eco-labelled</b> seafood and elaborate corporate buying policies for sustainable seafood are influencing consumer’s recognition and purchase of certified sustainable seafood products. However, <b>eco-labels</b> are a means to communicate messages about sustainable fisheries to consumers, not an end.

40|$|<b>Eco-labels</b> {{emphasize}} information disclosure {{as a tool}} {{to induce}} environmentally friendly behaviors by both firms and consumers. The goal of <b>eco-labels</b> is to reduce information asymmetry between producers and consumers over the environmental attributes of a product or service. However, by focusing on this information asymmetry, rather than how the label meets consumer needs, <b>eco-labels</b> may send irrelevant, confusing or even detrimental messages to consumers. In this paper, we investigate how the environmental signal of <b>eco-labels</b> interacts with product characteristics such as brand, quality and price. In a discrete choice experiment the authors examine consumer response to two similar <b>eco-labels</b> for wine, one associated with a quality reduction and the other not. Our results show that respondents preferred both <b>eco-labeled</b> wines over otherwise identical conventional counterparts, when the price was lower and the wine was from a lower quality region. However they preferred conventional more expensive wine from a high quality region. This indicates that respondents obtain some warm glow value from <b>eco-labeled</b> wine, but also possibly interpret it as a signal of lower quality. This relationship held across both types of <b>eco-labels,</b> meaning that consumers did not understand the difference between them. Our research contribute...|$|R

40|$|<b>Eco-labels</b> {{and ethical}} labels are {{instruments}} used in national product-related {{environmental and social}} policies. Germany was the first country to introduce an <b>eco-labelling</b> scheme, called "Blue Angel", in 1978. Since then, <b>eco-labelling</b> programs have been developed in many other countries of the world. National <b>eco-labelling</b> programs are new instruments covered by policy research studies. After outlining the aims and effects of environmental and ethical labels this study goes on to analyse potential negative impacts of <b>eco-labels</b> for foreign producers {{in the context of}} the world trade treaty and its free trade obligations. A review of the world-wide dissemination (diffusion patterns) of <b>eco-labels</b> and policy-learning processes identifies how policy innovations spread from one country to another. But there is cause to inquire into environmental-policy competence as a precondition for successful implementation. Three case studies are made of the German, European and Indian <b>eco-labelling</b> programs. The key message obtained from this evaluation of the perspectives of <b>eco-labels</b> for environmentally and socially acceptable products: The globalisation of economic, environmental and social policies will lead to a greater dissemination of policy instruments such as <b>eco-labels.</b> However, especially in developing economies that are under high pressure to become competitive on the world market, the introduction of new policy instruments is far too rapid, and does not reflect the need to first improve overall environmental policy competence...|$|R
