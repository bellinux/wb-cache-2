40|$|This {{research}} {{will examine the}} different subjectivities of white jazz critics {{as compared with the}} reported standpoints of New Orleans <b>jazz</b> <b>musicians</b> themselves.

These constructions will be viewed against the oral records of <b>jazz</b> <b>musicians</b> who, I hypothesize, will discuss their work as highly contextualized and socially-constructed. Implications for discursive racism, cultural and social influences on jazz, and the increasing whitening of jazz will also accompany this primary analysis...|$|R

5|$|In {{addition}} to the instruments, the term taiko also refers to the performance itself, and commonly to one style called kumi-daiko, or ensemble-style playing (as opposed to festival performances, rituals, or theatrical use of the drums). Kumi-daiko was developed by Daihachi Oguchi in 1951. He is considered a master performer and helped transform taiko performance from its roots in traditional settings in festivals and shrines. Oguchi was trained as a <b>jazz</b> <b>musician</b> in Nagano, and at one point, a relative gave him an old piece of written taiko music. Unable to read the traditional and esoteric notation, Oguchi found help to transcribe the piece, and on his own added rhythms and transformed the work to accommodate multiple taiko players on different-sized instruments. Each instrument served a specific purpose that established present-day conventions in kumi-daiko performance.|$|E
