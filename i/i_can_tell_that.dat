500|$|Fans ask me all {{the time}} {{what it is like to}} be a rock star. <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>tell</b> <b>that</b> they are dreaming, as I dreamed, when I was a kid, of someday ruling the world with a rock band. I tell them the same thing I would tell any young rock-star-to-be [...] you will get lonely. You will meet two hundred people every night, but each {{conversation}} will generally last approximately thirty seconds, and consist of you trying to convince them that no, you do not want their underwear. Then you will be alone again, in your motel room. Or you will be on your bus, in your little space, trying to kill the nine hours it takes to get to the next city, whichever city it is. This is the life of a rock star.|$|E
500|$|By 2008, Cuomo had reconsidered the album, saying: [...] "Pinkertons great. It's super-deep, brave, and authentic. Listening to it, <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>tell</b> <b>that</b> I {{was really}} going for it when I wrote and {{recorded}} {{a lot of those}} songs." [...] In 2010, Bell told The Aquarian Weekly: [...] "Pinkerton has definitely taken {{on a life of its}} own and became more successful and more accepted ... As an artist, you just have to do what you believe in at the time, whether it’s accepted or not. You just have to keep going with it." [...] In 2015, following the Pinkerton reissue and the [...] "Memories" [...] tour, in which Weezer performed Blue and Pinkerton in their entirety, Cuomo said:The experience of learning those songs again, singing them every night, working on them with the guys, and then being in a relatively small venue with 1,000 of the most hardcore Weezer fans and hearing them sing every syllable, seeing them air-drum all the fills—it was such an amazing experience and so different from what we'd been doing the years before that ... So it was a great feeling of validation from the fans, for this album that was so personal to me and had been such a source of pain for years.|$|E

2500|$|Although {{activities}} like dumpster diving or gleaning are traditionally seen as subsistence {{strategies for the}} poor, most research on freegans finds that individuals come from middle-class and upper-class backgrounds and {{have high levels of}} education (even if their present lifestyles make them low-income). Freeganism has also been described as racially exclusive, because freegan's voluntary association of waste would seem to confirm a [...] "globally ubiquitous racial construction" [...] that people of color are dirty and polluted. As one freegan of color wrote, [...] "I am extremely embarrassed for people to see me diving, because <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>tell</b> <b>that</b> I’m not just me, I’m also a representation of black people in general...I got harassed by security several times while diving on my own campus, until my white friends pop their heads out of the dumpsters." [...] In contrast, the portrait of the gender balance of freeganism is more mixed, with some accounts saying groups are majority men and others majority women.|$|E

I never lend money--it is unphilosophical: but I introduced him to old Miriam, who dare {{do business with the}} devil himself; and by that move, whether he has the money or not, I cannot tell: but this <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>tell,</b> <b>that</b> we have his secret--and so have you now; and if you want more information, the old woman, who enjoys an intrigue as much as she does Falernian, will get it you.' ...|$|E

"My liege," [...] he said, [...] "must {{of course}} {{know it is}} Douglas who must answer to this heavy charge, for when was there strife or bloodshed in Scotland, but there were foul tongues to asperse a Douglas or a Douglas's man as having given cause to them? We have here goodly witnesses. I speak not of my Lord of Albany, who has only said that he was, as well becomes him, by your Grace's side. And I say nothing of my Lord of Rothsay, who, as befits his rank, years, and understanding, was {{cracking}} nuts with a strolling musician. He smiles. Here he may say his pleasure; I shall not forget a tie which {{he seems to have}} forgotten.

Bless you, Susan, I can see through a four-inch plank in thick weather without the aid of a gimlet hole. You may believe it or not, but I know that Miss Emma has falled in love with Dr Lawrence, but whether Dr Lawrence has failed in love with Miss Emma is more than <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>tell.</b> <b>That</b> plank is at least a six-inch one, an' too much for my wision. But have a care, Susan, don't mention wot I've said to a single soul--livin' or dead. Miss Emma is a modest young woman, she is, an' would rather eat her fingers off, rings and all, than let her feelin's be known. I see that 'cause she fights shy o' Dr Lawrence, rather too shy of 'im, I fear, for secrecy. Why he doesn't make up to her is a puzzle that I don't understand, for she'd make a good wife, would Miss Emma, an' Dr Lawrence may live to repent of it, if he don't go in and win." ...|$|E
