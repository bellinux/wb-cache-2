5|$|Originally, {{the club}} favoured the name Melbourne Mavericks with a gunslinger logo holding a <b>fistful</b> <b>of</b> dollars. The club {{officials}} were {{all set to}} go with this until News Limited's Lachlan Murdoch told them to go with something else because the Mavericks sounded too American. Trams and Flying Foxes were also some ideas that came up. However co-CEOs Chris Johns and John Ribot decided {{to go with the}} themes lightning, power and storm. The club then became known as the Melbourne Storm.|$|E
5|$|A <b>Fistful</b> <b>of</b> Dollars {{proved a}} {{landmark}} {{in the development}} of spaghetti Westerns, with Leone depicting a more lawless and desolate world than traditional westerns, and challenging American stereotypes of a western hero with a morally ambiguous antihero. The film's success made Eastwood a major star in Italy and he was re-hired to star in For a Few Dollars More (1965), the second of the trilogy. Through the efforts of screenwriter Luciano Vincenzoni, the rights to For a Few Dollars More and the final film of the trilogy (The Good, the Bad and the Ugly) were sold to United Artists for about $900,000.|$|E
5|$|In 1971, Steiger {{played a}} chauvinistic big game hunter, {{explorer}} and war hero opposite Susannah York in Mark Robson's Happy Birthday, Wanda June, before agreeing to star alongside James Coburn as Mexican bandit Juan Miranda in Sergio Leone's Duck, You Sucker!, which was alternatively titled A <b>Fistful</b> <b>of</b> Dynamite. Leone was initially dissatisfied with {{his performance in}} that he played his character as a serious, Zapata-like figure. As a result, tension grew between Steiger and Leone, including one incident that ended with Steiger walking off during the filming of the scene where Juan's stagecoach is destroyed. After the film's completion, Leone and Steiger were content with the final result, and Steiger praised Leone for his skills as a director. Steiger auditioned {{for the role of}} Michael Corleone in Francis Ford Coppola's The Godfather (1972), a film adaptation of Italian American author Mario Puzo's 1969 novel of the same name, but Puzo felt that Steiger was too old for the part and rejected him.|$|E

5|$|Yojimbo (The Bodyguard), Kurosawa Production's second film, {{centers on}} a masterless samurai, Sanjuro, who strolls into a 19th-century town ruled by two {{opposing}} violent factions and provokes them into destroying each other. The director used this work to play with many genre conventions, particularly the Western, {{while at the same}} time offering an unprecedentedly (for the Japanese screen) graphic portrayal of violence. Some commentators have seen the Sanjuro character in this film as a fantasy figure who magically reverses the historical triumph of the corrupt merchant class over the samurai class. Featuring Tatsuya Nakadai in his first major role in a Kurosawa movie, and with innovative photography by Kazuo Miyagawa (who shot Rashomon) and Takao Saito, the film premiered in April 1961 and was a critically and commercially successful venture, earning more than any previous Kurosawa film. The movie and its blackly comic tone were also widely imitated abroad. Sergio Leone's A <b>Fistful</b> <b>of</b> Dollars was a virtual (unauthorized) scene-by-scene remake with Toho filing a lawsuit on Kurosawa's behalf and prevailing.|$|E
25|$|Anthrax {{released}} {{their debut}} album <b>Fistful</b> <b>of</b> Metal in January 1984. However, tensions were building between Lilker {{and the rest}} of the band for various reasons and he was asked to leave before touring began. He would soon form the band Nuclear Assault with former Anthrax roadie John Connelly. Lilker was replaced by Benante's nephew and roadie Frank Bello. The band then went on a successful US tour opening for Raven and others to support <b>Fistful</b> <b>of</b> Metal.|$|E

40|$|During {{the course}} of a 3 -year {{ecological}} study on Cross River gorillas (Gorilla gorilla diehli) at the Kagwene Mountain in Cameroon, we observed three cases of tool use which may be unique to the gorillas of this region and possibly learned through interactions with humans. A non-habituated group of Cross River gorillas threw <b>fistfuls</b> <b>of</b> grass toward humans in display contexts. An individual gorilla was also observed to throw a detached branch toward researchers during another encounter. The third encounter occurred between the focal group and a local man, in which the man threw stones at the gorillas and they reacted by throwing <b>fistfuls</b> <b>of</b> grass back at him. We describe these observations and speculate that this sub-population of gorillas developed this display behavior as a response to particular local conditions. Am. J.

25|$|Subsequent re-releases {{have largely}} used the title A <b>Fistful</b> <b>of</b> Dynamite, {{although}} the DVD appearing in The Sergio Leone Anthology box set, released by MGM in 2007, used the original English language title of Duck, You Sucker!.|$|E
25|$|The {{most popular}} Spaghetti Westerns {{were those of}} Sergio Leone, whose Dollars Trilogy (A <b>Fistful</b> <b>of</b> Dollars, For a Few Dollars More, and The Good, the Bad and the Ugly), {{featuring}} Clint Eastwood and scores by Ennio Morricone, came to define the genre along with Once Upon a Time in the West.|$|E
50|$|A {{delicacy}} called ‘Chanda chakata’ {{is made up}} of ‘khaee’, jaggery, banana, coconut, ginger, sugarcane, talasajja, cucumber, ghee, {{honey and}} milk is laid out on a ‘kula’ (winnowing fan) {{in the shape of a}} half moon. This 'chanda chkata' is then offered to the moon. Later, it is rolled into <b>fistfuls</b> <b>of</b> balls and partaken of. This tasty delight is also distributed among neighbours.|$|R
50|$|Gameplay {{is similar}} to Risk, {{at least at the}} very bare bones. Each player has their own {{designated}} turn where they move, and then fight any combats that result from it. But there, the similarities end. Rather than randomly roll huge <b>fistfuls</b> <b>of</b> dice as Risk players do, fighting troops are transferred over to another, smaller board that simulates a battlefield, allowing for the game to be played on both a tactical and strategic level.|$|R
5000|$|One of Abbie Hoffman's {{well-known}} publicity stunts {{took place}} in 1967, when he led members of the Yippie movement to the Exchange's gallery.

Three months later the stock exchange enclosed the gallery with bulletproof glass. Hoffman wrote a decade later, [...] "We didn't call the press; {{at that time we}} really had no notion of anything called a media event." ...|$|R

25|$|The {{turning point}} in Morricone's career took place in 1964, {{the year in which}} his third child, Andrea Morricone, who would also become a film composer, was born.

[...] The success of this first bootleg may have {{prompted}} others to create illicit albums as well, including The Beatles' Kum Back, released later in 1969, and copies of the original album, released by different labels. However, each time the content was copied, there was a reduction in sound quality.|$|R

The monster billed from Polynesia in hopes that we would ignore geography and the limiting stretch of triangles across Oceana and concentrate on him—thick-nosed and stoic—a body so wide it looked as if it touched both guardrails as he lumbered away from something much more majestic than where he was hailed from: a certainty where there should be mystery, a forgetful scooping together as if grabbing <b>fistfuls</b> <b>of</b> salt, as if you mistook the granules for sugar. Him, eating the dough anyway: shoveling the mush into his mouth despite claims of it tasting terrible, despite having no need for any of this. Him, eater of men, swallower of everything...|$|R

5000|$|Safan {{has also}} {{composed}} extensively for television, notably the hit sitcom Cheers (1982-93), which won for him numerous ASCAP awards for his music.

25|$|Being period drama pieces, {{both the}} Western and samurai genre {{influenced}} {{each other in}} style and themes throughout the years. The Magnificent Seven was a remake of Akira Kurosawa's film The Seven Samurai, and A <b>Fistful</b> <b>of</b> Dollars was a remake of Kurosawa's Yojimbo, which itself was inspired by Red Harvest, an American detective novel by Dashiell Hammett.

25|$|As few Spaghetti Westerns had {{yet been}} {{released}} in the United States, many of the European cast and crew took on American-sounding stage names. These included Leone himself ("Bob Robertson"), Gian Maria Volontè ("Johnny Wels"), and composer Ennio Morricone ("Dan Savio"). A <b>Fistful</b> <b>of</b> Dollars was shot in Spain, mostly near Hoyo de Manzanares close to Madrid, but also (like its two sequels) in the Tabernas Desert and in the Cabo de Gata-Níjar Natural Park, both {{in the province of}} Almería.|$|E
25|$|The Western films {{directed}} by Sergio Leone were felt {{by some to}} have a different tone than the Hollywood Westerns. Veteran American actors Charles Bronson, Lee Van Cleef and Clint Eastwood became famous by starring in Spaghetti Westerns, although the films also provided a showcase for other noted actors such as James Coburn, Henry Fonda, Klaus Kinski, and Jason Robards. Eastwood, previously the lead in the television series Rawhide, unexpectedly found himself catapulted into the forefront of the film industry by Leone's A <b>Fistful</b> <b>of</b> Dollars.|$|E

50|$|The Cross River gorilla at the Kagwene Mountain in Cameroon {{has been}} {{observed}} using tools {{and it seems to}} be unique to the population in this region.

All the encounter had the gorillas in the group observe the researchers and react to their presence with vocalizations then led to calm behavior in the parts of the gorillas and finally an approach by the male gorillas and the throwing of grass at the researcher. The researchers have stated that this throwing behavior might have arisen due to human contact in the field and farms surrounding the mountain and the ambivalent nature of the gorillas is due to the surrounding people not hunting the gorillas due to the folklore about the gorillas.|$|R
5000|$|Yippies were {{famous for}} their sense of humor. Many direct actions were often satirical and {{elaborate}} pranks or put-ons. An application to levitate The Pentagon during the October, 1967 March on the Pentagon, and a mass protest/mock levitation at the building organized by Rubin, Hoffman and company at the event, helped to {{set the tone for}} Yippie when it was established a couple of months later. Another famous prank just before Yippie was coined was a guerrilla theater event in New York City in 1967.Abbie Hoffman and a group of future Yippies managed to get into a tour of the New York Stock Exchange, where they threw <b>fistfuls</b> <b>of</b> real and fake US$ from the balcony of the visitors' gallery down to the traders below, some of whom booed, while others began to scramble frantically to grab the money as fast as they could.
