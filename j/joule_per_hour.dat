5000|$|Basal {{metabolic}} rate (BMR) is the minimal rate of energy expenditure per unit time by endothermic animals at rest. It is reported in energy units per unit time ranging from watt (joule/second) to ml O2/min or <b>joule</b> <b>per</b> <b>hour</b> per kg body mass J/(h·kg). Proper measurement requires a strict set of criteria be met. These criteria include {{being in a}} physically and psychologically undisturbed state, in a thermally neutral environment, while in the post-absorptive state (i.e., not actively digesting food). In bradymetabolic animals, such as fish and reptiles, the equivalent term standard {{metabolic rate}} (SMR) is used. It follows the same criteria as BMR, but requires the documentation of the temperature at which the metabolic rate was measured. This makes BMR a variant of standard metabolic rate measurement that excludes the temperature data, a practice {{that has led to}} problems in defining [...] "standard" [...] rates of metabolism for many mammals.|$|E

500|$|For {{any given}} {{amount of light}} energy created, the diode lasers give off about [...] as much heat as a flashtube. Less heat, {{combined}} with active cooling {{in the form of}} helium blown between the diodes and the laser glass layers, eliminated the warming of the glass and allows Mercury to run continually. In 2008, Mercury was able to fire 10 times a second at 50 <b>joules</b> <b>per</b> shot for <b>hours</b> at a time.|$|R
50|$|The {{dimension}} {{of power is}} energy divided by time. The SI unit of power is the watt (W), which is equal to one <b>joule</b> <b>per</b> second. Other units of power include ergs per second (erg/s), horsepower (hp), metric horsepower (Pferdestärke (PS) or cheval vapeur (CV)), and foot-pounds per minute. One horsepower is equivalent to 33,000 foot-pounds per minute, or the power required to lift 550 pounds by one foot in one second, and is equivalent to about 746 watts. Other units include dBm, a relative logarithmic measure with 1 milliwatt as reference; food calories <b>per</b> <b>hour</b> (often referred to as kilocalories per hour); Btu <b>per</b> <b>hour</b> (Btu/h); and tons of refrigeration (12,000 Btu/h).|$|R
