50|$|A typical <b>humic</b> <b>substance</b> is {{a mixture}} of many molecules, some of which are based on a motif of {{aromatic}} nuclei with phenolic and carboxylic substituents, linked together; the illustration shows a typical structure.The functional groups that contribute most to surface charge and reactivity of humic substances are phenolic and carboxylic groups. Humic acids behave as mixtures of dibasic acids, with a pK1 value around 4 for protonation of carboxyl groups and around 8 for protonation of phenolate groups. There is considerable overall similarity among individual humic acids. For this reason, measured pK values for a given sample are average values relating to the constituent species. The other important characteristic is charge density. The molecules may form a supramolecular structure held together by non-covalent forces, such as Van der Waals force, π-π, and CH-π bonds.|$|E

40|$|<b>Humic</b> <b>substances,</b> the dark-colored, natural organic {{polyelectrolytes}} {{that are}} found in practically all soils, sediments, and natural water, strongly interact with both inorganic and organic pollutants. Inorganic cationic species generally undergo complexation reactions with <b>humic</b> <b>substances.</b> The binding of cations, such as cupric ions, by <b>humic</b> <b>substances</b> often markedly reduces their toxicity to aquatic organisms. Some inorganic anionic species, {{in the presence of}} metal ions, are sorbed by <b>humic</b> <b>substances.</b> In these instances the metal ions appear to form bridges between the <b>humic</b> <b>substances</b> and the anions. Several different types of interactions take place between organic compounds and humic materials. Hydrophobic organic species partition into either insoluble or soluble <b>humic</b> <b>substances.</b> The insoluble <b>humic</b> <b>substances</b> will remove hydrophobic organic compounds from the aqueous phase, thereby rendering them less mobile. However, soluble <b>humic</b> <b>substances</b> will solubilize hydrophobic organics, increasing their mobility. Other types of interactions between <b>humic</b> <b>substances</b> and organic compounds, such as adsorption and ion exchange, also have been observed. These various interactions between <b>humic</b> <b>substances</b> and pollutants are important in governing their fate and movement in natural water systems, and, for this reason, a detailed understanding of the mechanisms of the interaction is important.

The <b>humic</b> <b>substance</b> extracted from compost of agricultural waste is rarely conducted. Theobjective of research was to evaluate the effect of <b>humic</b> <b>substance</b> concentration and sources to pH and Al suspension. The research had been conducted in the Soil Laboratory of Agricultural Faculty of Jember University from April toJuly 2009. The <b>humic</b> <b>substance</b> used in these researches was extracted from compost of rice straw (RS), soybeanstraw (SS), cassava starch solid waste (CSSW), and empty bunch of oil palm tree (EBOPT). The humic substanceconcentration treatments were 0, 10, 20, 30, 40, 50, 75, 100, 150, 200, 250, and 300 ppm. Result of the analysisshowed that characteristic of <b>humic</b> <b>substance</b> was difference depending on the source material used. The humicsubstance extracted from SS contains total base cations (K, Na, Ca, Mg) higher (1. 17 %) compared with CSSW (1. 07 %),OPT (0. 87 %), and RS (0. 69 %). While the humic substances extracted from RS contain total organic acid (Acetic,Fumeric, Cetoglutamic, Sucsinic, Propionic, Butiric, Ocsalic, and Citric Acid) higher (157 ppm) compared with EBOPT(129 ppm), SS (115 %), and CSSW (108 %). Among these organic acids, acetic acid was highest concentration (> 34. 51 % of total acid). The addition of <b>humic</b> <b>substance</b> increased pH and decreased aluminum concentration of thesuspension.

Ultrafiltration, using filter MWCO size of 1 kDa and 100 kDa, showed an adsorption of pesticide to filter. Chlorpyrifos (1 kDa) had the highest bioconcentration factor on filter (BCF) of 208 ± 4. 0. There was an overall trend of loss of pesticide recovery. Lindane had the lowest recovery 62 ± 2. 3 % at 1 kDa. Fractionation using HPSEC gave different size-fractions of <b>humic</b> <b>substance</b> with recovered pesticide. However, HPLC/MS/MS showed that both carbofuran and chlorpyrifos fastened in the column. This was most likely the case for lindane also, although this could not be tested due to lindane’s volatility.

40|$|Although {{there have}} been many studies on soil humus since SPRENGEL (1826), the {{properties}} and formation of extractable humus-like substance from compost are as yet obscure. Besides, the suitable methods for investigation of them have not been sufficiently established. For the purpose of throwing light upon humus-like substance in compost, the titration curve method of TANFORD was introduced into determining of dissociation radicals in humuslike substance; a procedure of pH-T curve for developing flocculation-beginning point and a refining process of humus-like substance with ion-exchange resins and electrodialysis were deviced. It has been found that there are two fractions in extractable humus-like substance from well-rotted compost. One fraction is soluble, as well as soil true humic acid, in SIMON's pH 4 sodium acetate buffer solution, but the other is insoluble in the above solution, even after eliminating sesquioxides to below ca. 0. 4 % by treatment with neutral 0. 1 M sodium pyrophosphate. Therefore, the former was termed "true humic substance" for avoiding a confusion with soil true humic acid, and the latter "rotted product" arbitrarily by the author. When well-rotted straw compost was treated with mild extractants: e. g., 0. 1 M sodium pyrophosphate, N/ 4 sodium oxalate, or dilute solution of sodium hydroxide, true <b>humic</b> <b>substance</b> and fulvic acid were obtained. True <b>humic</b> <b>substance</b> sedimented in the middle room of the PAULI dialyzer after electrodialysis, in state of sol, due to its hydrophilic property. This character was also observed in the case of soil true humic acid, which was soluble in SIMON's pH 4 buffer solution. When the residue, from well-rotted compost, after exhaustive extractions of true <b>humic</b> <b>substance</b> with mild extractants was subsequently treated at a temperature of about 100 ℃ for 1 or 2 hours with 0. 5 % sodium hydroxide, rotted product and fulvic acid were extracted. Rotted product was hydrophobic as well as lignin obtained from straw, and it had less amount of acid radicals than true <b>humic</b> <b>substance.</b> Then, rotted product precipitated in the middle room of the dialyser in state of gel after electrodialysis, and it had a higher flocculation-beginning point than true <b>humic</b> <b>substance.</b> When true <b>humic</b> <b>substance</b> was treated, in order to know the degree of its denaturation, at a temperature of 100 ℃ with 5 % sodium hydroxide for 22 hours, <b>humic</b> <b>substance</b> which flocculated by adding mineral acid, was recovered in amount of only 20 % of the initial true <b>humic</b> <b>substance,</b> acid soluble compounds being found in amount of about 40 %, and the remainder was thought to have been released as gas during treatment. The absorption coefficient of the recovered <b>humic</b> <b>substance</b> became far less than the initial one, but the original property of solubility in SIMON's pH 4 buffer solution was still maintained; also the recovered <b>humic</b> <b>substance</b> sedimented in sol state after electrodialysis. So it is evident that the rotted product, which is insoluble in SIMON's pH 4 buffer solution, could not be produced by conversion from true <b>humic</b> <b>substance,</b> under the usual conditions of extraction from compost. Interaction between the purified humus-like substance of compost and the purified Hbentonite-colloid, being passed over columns of first IRA- 400 and then IR- 120, was not observed from the additive effect on the titration curve. It was recognized from the titration curve that co-ordination compound of humus-like substance with aluminum was easily formed, but humus-like substance required more time to combine with iron than with aluminum. The formation of complex compound of humus-like substance with boric acid was not found from the cumulative effect on the titration curve. Accordingly, even if humuslike substance had adjacent hydroxyl groups, the positions of them were presumed not to be held in cis or ortho form, but in trans, meta, or para form. The conditions which were able to accelerate the decomposition of straw compost were observed as follows: (1) sufficient supply of air, (2) addition of moderate amount of calcium and nitrogen, and (3) maintenance of temperature adequate to thermophilic microorganisms. Compared true <b>humic</b> <b>substance,</b> rotted product, fulvic acid, and nonextractable organic matter from each two or three months elapsed compost, with those from one month elapsed one, respectively, in yields to the initial air dry straw material, the following relations were found: non-extractable organic matter decreased, and rotted product generally decreased or remained unchanged, also fulvic acid decreased, nevertheless true <b>humic</b> <b>substance</b> remained unchanged or increased. Thus, it may be assumed that rotted product was formed from decomposition of non-extractable organic matter, and the rotted product gradually converted to true <b>humic</b> <b>substance</b> according to progress of decomposition, and fulvic acid participated with the formation of true <b>humic</b> <b>substance.</b> True <b>humic</b> <b>substance</b> was not obtained from the compost prepared under perfect anaerobic condition, but only rotted product was extracted with mild extractants, even from three months elapsed one. On the contrary, from the compost under the most aerobic condition, even without nitrogen supplied, true <b>humic</b> <b>substance</b> was obtained in comparatively higher yield. In accordance with KONONOVA's opinion on soil humic acid, the formation of humuslike substance is supposed to be due to condensation of polyphenol produced by depoly-merization of lignin, carbohydrate and etc., with protein, polypeptide, and uronic acid which are decomposed products or metabolic substances by microorganisms. Thus, rotted product in humus-like substance is considered to be at the preliminary stage of condensation products by microorganisms, and true <b>humic</b> <b>substance</b> is presumed to be in the more advanced stage by aerobic microorganisms. This is emphasized {{by the fact that the}} formation of true <b>humic</b> <b>substance</b> appeared to participate with aerobic fermentation, and the chemical equivalent of true <b>humic</b> <b>substance</b> became less than that of rotted product...|$|E

The results show that <b>humic</b> <b>substances</b> could enhance the degradation of chlorophylls, and the degree are humin>humic acid>fulvic acid. 腐植化物質是土壤、水體及底泥環境中抗分解且長久滯存之高含碳量的穩定聚合物。 腐植化物質依其於水中之溶解度而分為腐植酸（humic acid；HA）、黃酸（fulvic acid；FA）及腐植素（humin）。 光合作用產物之碳水化合物及相關物質為生態系環境中有機碳之重要來源亦為形成腐植化物質之部份先驅物質（precursors）。 此外，元素鎂及氮為葉綠素構造之必要元素，而環境中之可溶性腐植化物質對無機金屬元素（包括Mg）有很強之複合及/或鉗合能力，因此，腐植化物質與落葉中葉綠素分解之反應頗值得探討。 本研究擬選定兩個不同環境條件之森林生態系，探討其土壤中腐植化物質與綠色植物落葉之葉綠素反應。 試驗地點為台灣東北部鴛鴦湖自然保護區之森林以及台灣中部關刀溪水源地集水區之森林。 前者之試驗地有較高之平均海拔及較低之年平均溫。 實驗項目包括，測定土壤樣品之基本性質、萃取及測定不同林分有機質層土壤之腐植化物質與葉綠素，以期了解其中腐植化物質對落葉物質之葉綠素分解之影響。 根據傅立葉轉換紅外線光譜之結果，可知不同森林生態系之土壤腐植化物質的特性及其官能基含量之差異。 根據實驗結果可得，由試區土壤所分離純化的腐植化物質，腐植酸、黃酸、及腐植素，對於葉綠素分解反應有促進的效用。 其影響程度依序為腐植素、腐植酸、與黃酸。目 錄 頁 碼 摘要．．．．．．．．．．．．．．．．．．．．．．Ⅰ 目錄．．．．．．．．．．．．．．．．．．．．．．Ⅱ 表次．．．．．．．．．．．．．．．．．．．．．．Ⅳ 圖次．．．．．．．．．．．．．．．．．．．．．．Ⅴ 前言．．．．．．．．．．．．．．．．．．．．．． 1 前人研究 一、 腐植質界說．．．．．．．．．．．．．．．．． 4 二、 腐植質的性狀．．．．．．．．．．．．．．．． 6 三、 影響土壤腐植質的性狀的因子．．．．．．．．． 10 四、 森林生態系的穩定作用及其對土壤腐植化物質之影響．．．．．．．．．．．．．．．．．．．．． 13 目的．．．．．．．．．．．．．．．．．．．．．． 17 材料與方法 一、 樣點採集．．．．．．．．．．．．．．．．．． 18 二、 土壤性質分析．．．．．．．．．．．．．．．． 23 三、 腐植質之萃取與純化．．．．．．．．．．．．． 23 四、 腐植質特性分析．．．．．．．．．．．．．．． 27 五、 土壤腐植化物質對葉綠素分解影響之測定．．．． 28 結果與討論 一、 採樣地點簡介．．．．．．．．．．．．．．．． 34 二、 土壤性質分析．．．．．．．．．．．．．．．． 35 三、 腐植質特性分析．．．．．．．．．．．．．．． 38 四、 土壤腐植化物質對葉綠素分解的影響．．．．．． 45 結論．．．．．．．．．．．．．．．．．．．．．． 58 參考文獻．．．．．．．．．．．．．．．．．．．． 60 附錄 附錄一、鴛鴦湖自然保留區地理環境介紹．．．．．． 74 附錄二、關刀溪森林生態系地理環境簡介．．．．．． 7...|$|R

40|$|The e!ect of the {{addition}} of various humic substances on the adsorption of caesium on two mineral clays has been studied. All measurements were carried out in dilute suspension under controlled conditions of temperature and ionic strength. Only {{a small proportion of}} the <b>humic</b> <b>substance</b> was adsorbed on the clays (10 %). In general, the a$nity of the clay}humic complexes for caesium was less than that of the bare clay. The decrease was greater for illite than for montmorillonite, and greatest at trace concentrations of caesium and increased with increasing concentration of each <b>humic</b> <b>substance.</b> However, no correlation was found between the amount of <b>humic</b> <b>substance</b> adsorbed and the decrease in Cs adsorption when all complexes were considered. Neither size nor the origin of the humic substances could explain the extent of the adsorption decrease. Since neither steric hindrance nor {{decrease in the number of}} adsorp-tion sites was the driving force behind this phenomenon, it is hypothesized that the a$nity of the clay surface is modi"ed by the organic macromolecules. The highly selective frayed edge sites of illite are particularly sensitive to the adsorption of polyanions because of their proximity to anion adsorption sites. The observed decrease in Cs adsorption may contribute to the unexpectedly high bioavailability of Cs in organic soils. (1999 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved...|$|E

40|$|AbstractHumic {{substances}} {{extracted from}} compost materials were proven able to chelate heavy metals. While the waste from Palm oil {{as the source}} material of compost is increasing, consequently the humic substances production from palm oil waste is promising. On the other hand, agricultural lands that were treated with high input which caused heavy metal accumulation (pollutant) up to hazardous level also increasing. The aim {{of this research was}} {{to evaluate the effectiveness of}} <b>humic</b> <b>substance</b> extracted from Palm Oil compost as liquid fertilizer and bioremediation of copper (Cu). The experiment was designed to discover a product which effectively improved the characteristics of acid soils, bioremediation of heavy metals, and plants production. The results of the experiment revealed that the content of pure <b>humic</b> <b>substance</b> extracted from compost of Palm Oil empty bunches waste was very low, 2. 01 %. It also contained very low in N, P, and K, which were 0. 01 %, 0. 02 %, and 0, 11 % of N, P 2 O 5, and K 2 O respectively. The treatment of metal Cu as much as 300 mg Cu(OH) 2. kg- 1 into the media added with <b>humic</b> <b>substance</b> enriched with NPK (4. 38; 8. 24; and 9. 24) showed non significant differences on some cucumber plant variables. NPK enrichments to <b>humic</b> <b>substance</b> showed significant differences on some agronomic variables than that of control. The length of plant treated with 3 / 3 NPK enrichment revealed the longest average of 564. 2 cm, or increased by 38 %. The highest fresh weight was obtained by 4 / 3 treatment followed by 2 / 3 rate of NPK enrichment. Whie the longest cucumber fruit was obtained by 3 / 3 rate. Total soil N was very low, consequently the NPK sorption by cucumber was very low. While soil P availability was high, however the NPK enrichment lowered the fresh cucumber fruit P content instead. The ratio of NPK nutrients in plant and in soil was higher if treated with Cu addition compared to that of control...|$|E
40|$|A high {{molecular}} weight humic fraction (> 3, 500 Da) was characterized chemically by DRIFT and 1 H NMR spectroscopy, and was applied to Zea mays L. plants to evaluate its effect on phenylpropanoid metabolism. The activity and gene expression of phenylalanine (tyrosine) ammonia-lyase (PAL/TAL), and the concentrations of phenolics and their amino acid precursors phenylalanine and tyrosine were assayed. Maximum induction of PAL/TAL activity and expression was obtained when the concentration of added <b>humic</b> <b>substance</b> was 1 mg C/l hydroponic solution. Phenylalanine and tyrosine significantly decreased (− 16 % and − 22 %, respectively), and phenolic compounds increased in treated plants. The effects of the <b>humic</b> <b>substance</b> could be ascribed partly to indoleacetic acid (27 nmol/mg C) in the humic fraction. Our results suggest that this humic fraction induces changes in phenylpropanoid metabolism.

40|$|Various humic {{substances}} were {{reacted with}} a coarse loamy soil in both batch studies and column experiments. Solution pH was not buffered, rather monitored to more closely approximate a "real life" scenario. Humic substances were also reacted with soil {{that had been}} pre-saturated with various concentrations of cadmium nitrate solution. The batch experiments were characterized by interference from antecedent natural organic matter in the soil, causing high nonlinearity in the data. <b>Humic</b> <b>substance</b> sorption in the column experiments was characterized by early breakthrough of a small fraction, followed by long extended tailing. Complete breakthrough was never observed {{in any of the}} column studies. Sorption phenomena is believed to be primarily controlled by the structural configuration of the humic substances, with solution pH and the valence of cations in the electrolyte solution having the greatest effect on sorption.

40|$|Dissolved <b>humic</b> <b>substances</b> {{separated}} from soils {{play an important}} role in the material cycle because they adsorb nu-trients and contaminants and move with water. This study was conducted to investigate the influence of anionic surfac-tant, pH and electrolyte concentration on the dissolution of <b>humic</b> <b>substances</b> from a highly humic volcanic ash soil. The soil used in the experiment has a negative charge and the anionic surfactant, sodium dodecylbenzene sulfonate, has also the negative charge. The absorbance of supernatant of soil solution at different surfactant concentration and dif- ferent electrolyte concentration (0. 001 M, 0. 01 M, 0. 1 M & 0. 5 M) of NaCl at pH 4. 5 and 6. 5 was measured at the wave-length of 400 nm; this corresponds to the relative concentration of dissolved <b>humic</b> <b>substances.</b> The surfactant adsorption and its equilibrium concentration under the same solution condition of the absorbance measurement were also measured in order to get their effect on dissolved <b>humic</b> <b>substances.</b> The zeta potential of soil particles was meas-ured in order to evaluate the influence of electrostatic potential on dissolution of <b>humic</b> <b>substances.</b> The concentration of dissolved <b>humic</b> <b>substances</b> increased at higher surfactant concentration and adsorption, at higher pH and at lower electrolyte concentration, because the electrostatic repulsive force between the soil particles and the dissolving <b>humic</b> <b>substances</b> became larger.

40|$|Thermodynamic {{stability}} constants of {{the formation}} of complexes from the reactions of <b>humic</b> <b>substances</b> with various metals are usually used as parameters to judge the reactivities of both <b>humic</b> <b>substances</b> and metals. However, in calculating the thermodynamic stability constants, complicated processes for the acquisition of activities of components in reactions are absolutely inevitable. In this study, we investigated the average conditional concentration quotients of the complexes formed from the reaction of metals with <b>humic</b> <b>substances</b> and the relations of these quotients to thermodynamic stability constants. The characterized <b>humic</b> <b>substances</b> including HA (MW > 1000), FA (MW > 1000), and FA (MW 1000), FA (MW > 1000), and FA (MW FA (MW > 1000) > HA (MW > 1000), showing the relative reactivities of the fractions of swine compost-derived <b>humic</b> <b>substances.</b> The sequence of reacting metals with <b>humic</b> <b>substances</b> was Pb > Cu > Cd > Zn, which is in good agreement with the sequence reported by judging the thermodynamic stability constants. The average conditional concentration quotients of the formed complexes from the reaction of <b>humic</b> <b>substances</b> with metals were thus useful parameters that can be directly related to thermodynamic stability constants and other parameters.
