5|$|Machine Head {{was formed}} when Flynn felt musically {{unfulfilled}} with his bands Forbidden and Vio-lence and requested {{to start a}} side project. When his request was denied, he left the band and formed Machine Head in 1991 with Duce, Logan Mader and Tony Constanza. The band's first album, Burn My <b>Eyes,</b> <b>was</b> a big success in Europe where it garnered attention on MTV's Headbangers Ball. In America (with HBB taken off the air during the grunge movement) Machine Head would not have success until later albums.|$|E

5|$|The skin of E. rabborum was {{granular}} in {{texture and}} predominantly a mottled brown. The upper {{surfaces of the}} limbs was also mottled brown while the rear surfaces of the thighs were a pale yellow. The chin and upper chest was distinctively brown, though {{the rest of the}} underside of the body was mostly white speckled with irregular brown spots. The eyelids and upper surfaces of the limbs and back were studded with green flecks, the appearance and positions of which could be changed by the animal voluntarily (metachrosis). The irises of the <b>eyes</b> <b>was</b> uniformly reddish brown.|$|E
50|$|Odd-clawed spiders {{have eight}} eyes {{arranged}} in {{two rows of}} four. The front row curves slightly backward, while the back row curves slightly forward. The anterior and posterior lateral (left and right) <b>eyes</b> <b>are</b> clustered closely together, while the median <b>eyes</b> <b>are</b> spaced further from each other. In females, the anterior and posterior lateral <b>eyes</b> <b>are</b> the largest pairs, with a diameter of 0.35 mm. The anterior median <b>eyes</b> <b>are</b> the smallest with a diameter of 0.23 mm. The posterior median <b>eyes</b> <b>are</b> slightly smaller than the lateral eyes, at a diameter of 0.32 mm. In males, the anterior lateral <b>eyes</b> <b>are</b> the largest pair, with a diameter of 0.29 mm. Their posterior median eyes and posterior lateral <b>eyes</b> <b>are</b> about the same size, with a diameter of 0.25 mm. As with the female, the anterior median <b>eyes</b> <b>are</b> the smallest pair, with a diameter of only 0.15 mm. All of the <b>eyes</b> <b>are</b> white in color, except for the anterior median <b>eyes</b> which <b>are</b> black.|$|R

50|$|The non-{{dominant}} <b>eye</b> <b>is</b> {{covered and}} the dominant <b>eye</b> <b>is</b> opened and kept open by a speculum, the corneal flap is lifted and the laser correction is done - an ultra thin flap {{can be created}} for treatment of very high prescriptions. The flap is replaced and the speculum is removed. The dominant <b>eye</b> <b>is</b> treated next. The software data for each <b>eye</b> <b>is</b> stored in the Carl Zeiss Meditc MEL 80 laser and delivered by the eye-tracker controlled computer generated excimer laser pulses. The laser time for each <b>eye</b> <b>is</b> usually under 30 seconds. The dominant <b>eye</b> <b>is</b> mainly corrected for distance and intermediate vision and the non-dominant <b>eye</b> <b>is</b> corrected for intermediate and near vision, by increasing the depth of focus for each eye.|$|R
5|$|Cawthon {{posted a}} teaser on his {{official}} website in 2015 that announced he {{had plans to}} release his first novel called Five Nights at Freddy's: The Untold Story (that would later be renamed to Five Nights at Freddy's: The Silver Eyes) sometime in the near future, {{and that it was}} to be written separate-canon to the games. On June 20, 2016, Scholastic announced that it would be collaborating with Scott Cawthon on a multi-book deal. Five Nights at Freddy's: The Silver <b>Eyes,</b> <b>was</b> to be re-printed in paperback on October that year. It was then rescheduled for release on September in the same year.

5|$|June's {{body and}} {{clothing}} were heavily bloodstained; {{she was found}} in her nightdress with bare feet. The police believe she had been sitting up during part of the attack, based on the pattern of blood on her clothing. She was found {{lying on the floor}} by the door of the master bedroom. She had been shot seven times. One shot to her forehead, between her <b>eyes,</b> <b>was</b> fired from under one foot away. That and another shot to the right side of her head would both have caused her death quickly, the court heard. There were also shots to the right side of her lower neck, her right forearm, and two injuries {{on the right side of}} her chest and right knee.|$|E
5|$|The {{body of the}} Portuguese dogfish {{is thick}} and {{cylindrical}} except for the flattened belly. The two dorsal fins are small and of similar size and shape, each bearing a tiny grooved spine in front. The first dorsal fin originates well behind the pectoral fins, while the second dorsal originates over {{the middle of the}} pelvic fin bases. The pectoral fins are medium-sized with a rounded margin. There is no anal fin. The caudal fin has a short but well-developed lower lobe and a prominent ventral notch near the tip of the upper lobe. The very large dermal denticles change in shape with age: in juveniles, they are widely spaced and heart-shaped with an incomplete midline ridge and three posterior points, while in adults they are overlapping, roughly circular, smooth, and flattened with a round central concavity, superficially resembling the scales of bony fishes. Young sharks are a uniform blue-black in color, while adults are brown-black; there are no prominent fin markings. In 1997, a partially albino individual, with a pale body but normal <b>eyes,</b> <b>was</b> caught in the northeastern Atlantic. This represented the first documented case of albinism in a deep-sea shark.|$|E
50|$|Pupillary {{diameter}}. Light {{falling in}} one eye affects {{the diameter of the}} pupils in both eyes. One can easily see this by looking at a friend's eye while he or she closes the other: when the other <b>eye</b> <b>is</b> open, the pupil of the first <b>eye</b> <b>is</b> small; when the other <b>eye</b> <b>is</b> closed, the pupil of the first <b>eye</b> <b>is</b> large.|$|R
50|$|Aprusia veddah is {{only known}} from the female of the species. The females are 18.5mm long. The {{cephalothorax}} is pale orange and broadly oval in shape. The anterior lateral <b>eyes</b> <b>are</b> the largest and circular, the posterior median <b>eyes</b> <b>are</b> oval, as are the posterior lateral eyes; the posterior <b>eye</b> row <b>is</b> procurved from the front; the anterior lateral <b>eyes</b> <b>are</b> separated by less than their radius, the anterior lateral eye and the posterior lateral <b>eye</b> <b>are</b> separated by less than the anterior lateral eye's radius, the posterior median <b>eyes</b> <b>are</b> touching, the posterior lateral eye and posterior median <b>eye</b> <b>are</b> touching. The sternum is longer than wide. They have three spines on the prolateral side of the first femur.|$|R

25|$|The 1982 mold of Snake <b>Eyes</b> <b>was</b> used {{in several}} {{countries}} in various forms. In most countries, because he was different {{from all of the}} other G.I. Joe figures available at that time, he was treated as a member of Cobra. In Brazil, his head was recolored and used to create Cobra De AÃ§o, and the entire mold was used with a silver Cobra logo to create Cobra Invasor. The figure was also available without the Cobra logo as O Invasor. In Argentina, Snake <b>Eyes</b> <b>was</b> recolored in red and silver, and released as Cobra Mortal and as a different version of Cobra Invasor.|$|E

50|$|The {{relative}} {{strength of}} these two forces depends on which way the <b>eye</b> <b>is</b> looking. When the <b>eye</b> <b>is</b> adducted (looking toward the nose), the force of depression increases. When the <b>eye</b> <b>is</b> abducted (looking away from the nose), the force of intorsion increases, while the force of depression decreases. When the <b>eye</b> <b>is</b> in the primary position (looking straight ahead), contraction of the superior oblique produces depression and intorsion in roughly equal amounts.|$|R
25|$|The Opiliones have {{a single}} pair of eyes {{in the middle of the}} head, {{oriented}} sideways. A 305-million-year-old fossilized harvestman with two pairs of <b>eyes</b> <b>was</b> reported in 2014. However, some species are eyeless, such as the Brazilian Caecobunus termitarum (Grassatores) from termite nests, Giupponia chagasi (Gonyleptidae) from caves, and all species of the Guasiniidae.|$|E
