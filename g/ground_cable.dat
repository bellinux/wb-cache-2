5000|$|During {{the night}} of the 6-7 November 1918, the 64th Bgde marched from their billet at Berlaimont, across the Sambre River by the town bridge, and then across country via Aloyne to Bachant. That is about 10 km (6.25 miles) from billet to destination, with the march {{starting}} at 0415 hours. Forward Parties of the 15th Durham Light Infantry, under Captain Arthur Moore Lacelles VC, along with Ablitt and a forward Signals maintenance party from Division, then crossed the railway lines and advanced to Limont-Fontaine. However, heavy resistance was encountered at the ‘red line’, approximately 2 km west of Limont Fontaine at 0815 hrs, with significant Machine Gun fire from the left and an enemy artillery bombardment. The forward parties made good a trench-line 500m to the west of Limont Fontaine at about 1000hrs. Limont-Fontaine, along with Eclaibes to the south-east, were taken by 1650 hrs. The lines which Ablitt maintained ran from Brigade HQ 500m east of Bachant, across the railway line, and then across flat, open, ground to 15 DLI forward positions outside Limont Fontaine, a distance of some 5 km. Given the rapidity of the advance, the communications would have been by <b>ground</b> <b>cable,</b> laid by the [...] "Fast Cable" [...] method involving a minimum of 4 men. Notoriously susceptible to damage and failure, <b>ground</b> <b>cable</b> would have required continual maintenance throughout the action, as noted in the citation.|$|E

After PD or arcing is detected, {{the next step is}} to locate the fault area. Using the acoustic emission method (AE), 4 or more AE sensors are placed on the transformer shell where the AE and HFCT wavedata is collected at the same time.

5000|$|Another {{location}} of the Bock's stories was the early 17th century stone fort in Kajaani. According to Bock, a castle was situated in the place already in the 13th century, when a royal treasure of Kings of Finland, including a golden buck statue, was hidden in a well {{in the courtyard of}} the castle. Some excitement arose when ground-penetrating radar investigations made in 1996 and 2000 suggested that a sizable metal item was located at 4 meters depth of the courtyard of the fort. According to the state archaeologist Henrik Lilius the item was probably an old cannon that could have fallen into the well during the destruction of the fort in 1716. A new investigation made in 2006 was not able to verify the earlier observations. [...] During an archaeological excavation made later in 2006, it was noticed that an electric <b>ground</b> <b>cable</b> had been dug in the courtyard at 40 cm depth.

40|$|Four {{types of}} cable drawn farming systems, a single engine system, a double engine system, a {{perimeter}} system, and a double implement system, were analyzed {{to determine which}} was best suited for Arizona. The systems were compared in terms of relative cost, reliability/simplicity and field capacity. Field capacity computation variables were implement width, implement speed, tower travel speed, implement carrier travel speed, and implement rotation time. The analysis showed the single engine system was the least expensive, simplest system with a field capacity identical {{to that of the}} double engine system, eight percent lower than the double implement system, and approximately thirteen percent higher than the perimeter system. Based on these results, the single implement system was judged superior to the others. The parameters affecting single implement system performance were then examined to optimize performance. The evaluation yielded a recommendation that the system be designed to have a tower speed of 48 ft/min, and a rotation time of 7. 5 seconds. A positioning system for the mobile truss of a cable drawn farming system was also developed and tested. The system used a linear move irrigation system's above <b>ground</b> <b>cable</b> guidance system for steering, a wicket positioning system for stopping the machine at the indexing locations, and a wire-alignment system to control inner tower alignment. The system was tested over a length of 280 ft using a five tower, 575 ft long, linear move irrigation system. It was found that the above <b>ground</b> <b>cable</b> guidance system provided ± 0. 5 ft steering accuracy, the wicket positioning system controlled the power unit and end tower position within ± 0. 2 ft of the target destination, and that the wire alignment system controlled inner tower position within ± 0. 3 ft of the target destination.

This research is motivated {{by the fact that}} currently there are no widely accepted methods or models used to predict electric arc failure in cables exposed to thermal conditions or to determine whether an arc failure event was the cause or result of a fire. A variety of tests were performed at various temperatures {{to learn more about the}} arc failure of these cables. The cables were exposed to precise temperatures with a steady heating rate in a convection oven in order to best attempt to eliminate heat transfer through the cable. In order to explore the effect current may have on the time to arc failure of the cable, experiments at different temperatures were performed in both loaded and unloaded scenarios. During many of these tests, voltage and current measurements were collected during an arcing event. As part of the process of exploring the events leading up to arc failure, electrical resistance tests of the cable's insulation components were examined. A model was developed to predict time to arc failure at a variety of temperatures based on thermal degradation of the PVC insulation. The purpose of the developed model is to be able to predict cable failure based on known thermal conditions. The proposed values of the model developed are in examining a prior thermally induced electrical arcing incident or in determining the suitability of a cable in an abnormal thermal environment.
