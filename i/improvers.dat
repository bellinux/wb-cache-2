The Society of <b>Improvers</b> was founded in 1723, including in its 300 members dukes, earls, lairds and landlords. Before the eighteenth century English books on husbandry had been available or reprinted in Scotland, but {{in the eighteenth century}} there were increasing numbers of titles published by Scottish authors in Scotland.

25|$|Friday afternoon's {{qualifying}} session ran {{for half}} an hour. The drivers' fastest lap times determined the starting order for the first race. The driver who won the pole position was awarded four points that went towards the Drivers' and Teams' Championship races. Qualifying began under cloudy weather conditions and thus most of the field drove onto the track when the session started. Rain fell five minutes into qualifying but was not heavy enough to affect the track. Simon Trummer was the early pace setter but was soon eclipsed by his teammate Coletti, who in turn, was suppressed by Ericsson. Leimer then moved {{to the top of}} the time sheets with a new GP2 Series lap record of the Bahrain International Circuit and later lowered it to a of one minute and 39.427 seconds lap time and this secured him the pole position. Ericsson appeared to challenge Leimer for pole but eased off after losing time in the final sector to join the latter on the grid's front row with a time nearly a second off Leimer's pace. Nasr equalled his qualifying result from the previous year's race to start from third. Coletti improved on his own fastest lap which was good enough for fourth. Dillmann was best of the late <b>improvers</b> and qualified fifth. Richelmi was close in arrears in sixth position. Rossi was in the top three early in the session but fell to seventh by its conclusion.|$|E
25|$|In {{a number}} of cases, Mackworth was closely {{involved}} in moves to move aside opponents of the régime, who came from diverse standpoints and were treated in often very different ways. On 8 March {{he was one of}} a committee of three deputed to examine the case of the Levellers' leader John Lilburne, detained by the government the previous year, although acquitted of all charges. Eight days later they recommended he be sent to Mount Orgueil Castle on Jersey. On 23 March he was put on a committee to investigate the dispute between Elizabeth, Countess Dirletoun, and a group of <b>improvers</b> concerned {{in the construction of the}} River Wey Navigation, headed by James Pitson. Lady Elizabeth was the widow of William Hamilton, 2nd Duke of Hamilton, who was killed at the Battle of Worcester. She had refused the compensation offered by the developers for building on her land and had been breaking down the banks of the river, finally demolishing a building that had been in use as a government powder magazine, claiming that she feared for the lives of her family. As the scheme had been approved by Parliament and was clearly in the interests of trade, there was little chance that objectors would prevail, but the committee's recommendations were moderate. Pitson was granted an order protecting his investment and requesting the county authorities take more care to keep the peace. However, as Lady Dirlestoun would not accept £200, he was to pay her £10 10s. a year and then buy the land off her heirs. More generally, Mackworth was deputed to {{a number of}} committees dealing with censorship.|$|E

After scouting the area for three weeks, a site adjacent a deep and sheltered natural harbour was identified as being suitable for the settlement.|$|E

Smaller farms retained the linear outline of the longhouse, with dwelling house, barn and byre in a row, but in larger farms a three- or four-sided layout became common, separating the dwelling house from barns and servants quarters. Hundreds of thousands of cottars and tenant farmers from central and southern Scotland were forcibly moved from the farms and small holdings their families had occupied for hundreds of years. Many small settlements were dismantled. Of those that remained many were now crofters: poor families living on [...] "crofts"—very small rented farms with indefinite tenure used to raise various crops and animals, with kelping, fishing, spinning of linen and military service as important sources of revenue. Many lived in blackhouses with double thickness walls about [...] high, made of local stone and packed with rubble and earth and thatched with reeds. They were unfaced inside and were usually warmed by a peat fire on a slab floor, the smoke from which gave them their name. Others were forced either to the new purpose-built villages built by the landowners such as John Cockburn at Ormiston and Archibald Grant's Monymusk, to the new industrial centres of Glasgow, Edinburgh, northern England, or to Canada or the United States.|$|E

The houses were intended for sale to small landlords and owner occupiers with a provision for rental purchase and some renting. The Bradford firm Andrews and Pepper were appointed architects.
