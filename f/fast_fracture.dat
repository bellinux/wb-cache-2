50|$|In {{structural}} engineering and material science, <b>fast</b> <b>fracture</b> {{is a term}} given to a phenomenon in which a flaw (such as a crack) in a material expands quickly, and leads to catastrophic failure of the material. Stress acting on a material when <b>fast</b> <b>fracture</b> occurs {{is less than the}} material's yield stress. A very representative example of {{this is what happens when}} poking a blown up balloon with a needle, that is, <b>fast</b> <b>fracture</b> of the balloon's material.|$|E

A general objective is to provide quantitative relations between the measurable (and hopefully controllable) features of the materials' micro-scale structure and its macroscopic mechanical behavior. Ongoing research projects involve studies of ductile fracture and ductile-brittle transitions; crack growth in heterogeneous microstructures with particular emphasis {{on the role of}} interfaces; nonlocal and discrete dislocation plasticity; fatigue crack growth; and <b>fast</b> <b>fracture</b> in brittle solids.|$|E
5000|$|The {{derailment}} {{had been}} the result of a broken locomotive axle. Rankine's investigation of broken axles in Britain highlighted the importance of stress concentration, and the mechanism of crack growth with repeated loading. His and other papers suggesting a crack growth mechanism through repeated stressing, however, were ignored, and fatigue failures occurred at an ever-increasing rate on the expanding railway system. Other spurious theories seemed to be more acceptable, such as the idea that the metal had somehow [...] "crystallized". The notion was based on the crystalline appearance of the <b>fast</b> <b>fracture</b> region of the crack surface, but ignored the fact that the metal was already highly crystalline.|$|E
30|$|In both cases, {{correction}} was commenced late so as {{to ensure}} complete wound healing. We {{believe that it is}} not necessary to wait for 6  weeks provided the soft tissues are adequately healed. In a subsequent successful case, we were able to commence correction at 3  weeks. In delaying correction, we used distraction osteogenesis with manipulation of immature fracture callus at the fracture sites. The advantages of delaying the correction from 3 to 6  weeks may result in <b>faster</b> <b>fracture</b> union.|$|R

40|$|Background: With {{changing}} {{trends in}} treatment of displaced midshaft clavicle fractures (DMCF), plating remains the standard procedure for fixation. An attracting alternative method of fixation is the titanium elastic nailing (TEN). However, prospective randomized studies comparing the two methods of fixation are lacking. We assessed {{the effectiveness of}} minimally invasive antegrade TEN and plating technique {{for the treatment of}} DMCF. Materials and Methods: 80 unilateral displaced midclavicular fractures operated between October 2010 and May 2013 were included in study. This prospective comparative study was approved by the local ethical committee. Followups were at 2 nd and 6 th weeks and subsequently at 3, 6, 12, 18 and 24 months postoperatively. Primary outcome was measured by the Constant score, union rate and difference in clavicular length after fracture union. Secondary outcome was measured by operative time, intraoperative blood loss, wound size, cosmetic results and complications. Results: During analysis, we had 37 patients in the plate group and 34 patients in the TEN group. There {{was no significant difference in}} Constant scores between the two groups. However, <b>faster</b> <b>fracture</b> union, lesser operative time, lesser blood loss, easier implant removal and fewer complications were noted in the TEN group. Conclusion: The use of minimally invasive antegrade TEN for fixation of displaced midshaft clavicle fractures is recommended in view of <b>faster</b> <b>fracture</b> union, lesser morbidity, better cosmetic results, easier implant removal and fewer complications; although for comminuted fractures plating remains the procedure of choice...|$|R
5000|$|The crack initiates at KIscc and {{thereafter}} propagates {{at a rate}} governed by the slowest process, {{which most of the}} time is the rate at which corrosive ions can diffuse to the crack tip. As the crack advances so K rises (because crack length appears in the calculation of stress intensity). Finally it reaches KIc, whereupon <b>fast</b> <b>fracture</b> ensues and the component fails. One of the practical difficulties with SCC is its unexpected nature. Stainless steels, for example, are employed because under most conditions they are [...] "passive", i.e. effectively inert. Very often one finds a single crack has propagated {{while the rest of the}} metal surface stays apparently unaffected. The crack propagates perpendicular to the applied stress.|$|E

40|$|Four-point {{bend tests}} were {{performed}} on precracked single-crystal MgO and Mo specimens over a range of temperatures and strain rates. Etching was used to reveal dislocations around the crack tip and pre-existing dislocations in the bulk material. In both materials slow, stable crack growth was found to occur before <b>fast</b> <b>fracture,</b> the degree of which increased with temperature. A high dislocation density was revealed in the crack advance region. Different dislocation geometries were observed {{to be associated with}} the precrack, the crack advance region and the <b>fast</b> <b>fracture</b> zone. We propose that dislocation sources at or near the crack tip emit dislocation loops with both shielding and antishielding dislocations. The action of the antishielding dislocations promotes crack advance, while the shielding dislocations can retard <b>fast</b> <b>fracture</b> until substantial crack advance has occurred.

40|$|This {{study was}} {{conducted}} to assess the healing of transverse ulna fracture when fixed with external skeletal fixation (ESF) in pigeon. Ulna fracture was created under Isoflurane anesthesia in pigeons. A total of 12 pigeons were used in this study, and they were divided into three equal groups: Group- 1, Group- 2 and Group- 3. The birds of the three groups were sacrificed at 3, 6, and 12 weeks after successful fracture surgery. It was found that bone union occurred between three and six weeks in all groups. Bone alignment, and callus remodeling were evident at 12 weeks (p< 0. 05) post fracture fixation. There were no radiographic evidence of callus remodeling in any bird at 3 and 6 weeks post-surgery. The radiographic observations of fracture healing in this study have confirmed that ESF fixation is an effective method to stabilize ulna fracture in pigeons and results in <b>faster</b> <b>fracture</b> healing...|$|R

40|$|One of {{the major}} {{challenges}} involved {{in the use of}} ceramic materials is ensuring adequate strength and durability. This activity has developed methodology which can be used during the design phase to predict the structural behavior of ceramic components. The effort involved the characterization of injection molded and hot isostatic pressed (HIPed) PY- 6 silicon nitride, the development of nondestructive evaluation (NDE) technology, and the development of analytical life prediction methodology. Four failure modes are addressed: <b>fast</b> <b>fracture,</b> slow crack growth, creep, and oxidation. The techniques deal with failures initiating at the surface as well as internal to the component. The life prediction methodology for <b>fast</b> <b>fracture</b> and slow crack growth have been verified using a variety of confirmatory tests. The verification tests were conducted at room and elevated temperatures up to a maximum of 1371 {degrees}C. The tests involved (1) flat circular disks subjected to bending stresses and (2) high speed rotating spin disks. Reasonable correlation was achieved for a variety of test conditions and failure mechanisms. The predictions associated with surface failures proved to be optimistic, requiring re-evaluation of the components` initial <b>fast</b> <b>fracture</b> strengths. Correlation was achieved for the spin disks which failed in <b>fast</b> <b>fracture</b> from internal flaws.

40|$|Abstract. Ductile {{honeycombs}} under in-plane biaxial loads fail by elastic buckling, plastic yielding and <b>fast</b> <b>fracture</b> {{of solid}} cell edges, while brittle honeycombs fail by elastic buckling, brittle rupturing and <b>fast</b> <b>fracture</b> of solid cell edges. In the paper, {{we aim at}} summarizing the modeling and theoretical expressions for describing the failure surfaces of honeycombs with non-uniform thickness cell edges under in-plane biaxial loads. Hence, the failure surfaces of ductile honeycombs with plateau borders are generated and found {{to be dependent on}} the solid distribution in cell edges and the yielding strengths of solid cell edges. Also, the failure surfaces of brittle honeycombs with plateau borders are significantly affected by the cell-edge modulus of rupture and the solid distribution in cell edges...|$|E

With macrographic examination, SEM {{observation}} and fracture quantitative analysis technology, the fracture fractography of a spray tube {{with both the}} mechanical stress and the thermal stress in a boiler desuperheater of a power plant was interpreted, and the failure mode and the cause were researched. Results showed that rupture of the spray tube {{was due to the}} fatigue, and further, the thermal-mechanical fatigue. The alternating bending stress and thermal stress were main factors of the fracture failure. The shallow surface thermal fatigue cracks in tube inner wall were induced by thermal stress. When the thermal-mechanical fatigue crack grew up steadily to the shallow surface cracks zone, fast growth occurred and the local <b>fast</b> <b>fracture</b> zone generated which had different fractographies with final <b>fast</b> <b>fracture</b> zone of the normal fatigue fracture...|$|E
40|$|In {{tight gas}} reservoirs, gas well {{production}} is impaired after Hydraulic fracturing, that is mostly due to fracturing fluid (FF) invasion into matrix and fracture and poor clean-up efficiency. The {{scope of this}} study is to investigate the clean-up efficiency in short hydraulic fracture vertical wells and observe how the effect of pertinent parameters on gas production loss (GPL) changes with the hydraulic fracture length. The impact of 12 parameters including fracture permeability, matrix permeability, End point and Exponent of Corey gas and FF relative permeability curve in both matrix and fracture, and Interfacial Tension and Pore Size Index (capillary pressure) have been studied by developing a computer code. Interactive linear surface model describing the dependency of GPL to the pertinent parameters was used. The results indicate that as fracture length decreased the effect of fracture parameters (fracture permeability and End point and Exponent of Corey gas and FF relative permeability curve in fracture) on GPL decreased and the effect of those relevant parameters in matrix on GPL increased. The effect of capillary pressure in reducing GPL is less pronounced in shorter fractures. In shorter <b>fractures,</b> <b>faster</b> <b>fracture</b> clean-up was observed compare to the one for longer fracture...|$|R
40|$|Hepatocyte {{growth factor}} (HGF) was {{initially}} identified in cultured hepatocytes and subsequently reported to induce angiogenic, morphogenic, and antiapoptotic activity in various tissues. These properties suggest a potential influence of HGF on bone healing. We asked if gene transfer of human HGF (hHGF) into an osteotomy gap with a hemagglutinating virus of Japan-envelope (HVJ-E) vector promotes bone healing in rabbits. HVJ-E that contained either hHGF or control plasmid was percutaneously {{injected into the}} osteotomy gap of rabbit tibias on Day 14. The osteotomy gap was evaluated by radiography, pQCT, mechanical tests, and histology at Week 8. The expression of hHGF was evaluated by reverse transcriptase–polymerase chain reaction and immunohistochemistry at Week 3. Radiography, pQCT, and histology suggested the hHGF group had <b>faster</b> <b>fracture</b> healing. Mechanical tests demonstrated the hHGF group had greater mechanical strength. The injected tissues at 3  weeks expressed hHGF mRNA by reverse transcriptase–polymerase chain reaction. hHGF-positive immunohistochemical staining was observed in various cells at the osteotomy gap at Week 3. The data suggest delivery of hHGF plasmid into the osteotomy gap promotes fracture repair, and HGF could become a novel agent for fracture treatment...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{describes}} {{the investigation of}} the laser cleaving mechanism of brittle materials such as silicon wafer using experimental and computational methods. The applied laser energy produces a thermal stress that causes the wafer to split along the irradiation path. The wafer separation is similar to crack extension. In this study, the use of micro-groove was introduced, and the influences of groove length and depth were also examined. The temperature of the laser spot was measured using a two-colour pyrometer, while the fracture occurrences were observed by monitoring the acoustic emission signal. The relationships amongst laser power, temperature, fracture initiation, crack propagation, cleaved surface features and groove parameters are obtained from the experimental analysis. In order to understand the stress condition during laser irradiation, thermal stress distribution was analysed using the computational finite element method (FEM). The results indicate that the wafer separation occurred in two stages, fracture initiation and intermittent crack propagation. A higher temperature resulted in <b>faster</b> <b>fracture</b> initiation and higher repetition of the crack propagation signal. The wave mark on the cleaved surface was consistent with the AE signal. By using FEM, stress condition has bee...|$|R

40|$|The {{objective}} of the research was to provide theoretical and experimental backing for three concepts that will facilitate thedesign of structures capable of arresting cracks.

40|$|BACKGROUND: Maintenance of wire {{pretension}} in an Ilizarov {{external fixator}} {{is dependent on}} the torque applied to the fixation bolts. We therefore measured immediately after surgery the clinically applied torques. The median value was only 10 N m (range 8 - 14 N m). We wondered whether this value is appropriate to maintain the wire pretension and thereby to achieve sufficient fracture stability during dynamic loading of the device for a longer period. METHODS: A material testing machine dynamically loaded one wire mounted on one ring. Several configurations were tested. RESULTS: A quick decrease in wire tension to a steady state situation was seen. In the most stable configuration (20 N m wire fixation torque) 50 % of the initial 90 kg wire pretension remained after dynamic loading with 200 N. In the least stable configuration (10 N m torque) considerable wire slippage occurred even without loading and no tension remained after loading! No plastic deformation of the wires was observed so loss of wire tension was due to slippage of the wires through the fixation bolts. INTERPRETATION: With the small fixation torques used in clinical practice considerable wire tension is lost even after a few loading cycles. Further research should address the question whether preservation of a higher wire tension during long term loading promotes <b>faster</b> <b>fracture</b> healing...|$|R

40|$|A {{computer}} program {{was developed for}} calculating the statistical <b>fast</b> <b>fracture</b> reliability and failure probability of ceramic components. The program includes the two-parameter Weibull material fracture strength distribution model, using the principle of independent action for polyaxial stress states and Batdorf's shear-sensitive as well as shear-insensitive crack theories, all for volume distributed flaws in macroscopically isotropic solids.

40|$|ABSTRACT Aim: To {{compare the}} results of {{surgical}} treatment of Acute displaced midshaft clavicular fracture with those treated conservatively in terms of rate of fracture union, complications and functional out come. Background: Traditionally majority of mid shaft clavicular fractures unite with good functional outcome following conservative treatment, may be no longer valid for all mid shaft clavicular fractures. Many studies have shown a relatively high incidence of non union and limitation of shoulder function. Material & methods: 50 patients of Acute displaced mid shaft clavicular fractures were treated either by surgical methods (plate os-teo synthesis, n 25, group I) or conservative methods (n 25, group II). Patients were followed up on 3, 6, 12 weeks, 6 months, and 1 year, Time taken for fracture union, complications were compared and Functional outcome was assessed using DASH score and Constant shoulder score. Results: All the fractures in group I united with two cases of asymptomatic mol union (8 %) and one case of delayed union (4 %). Whereas in group II, 4 cases of nonunion (16 %), 6 cases of asymptomatic mol union (24 %) and delayed union in 2 cases (8 %) were observed. Time taken for fracture union was shorter in group I compared to group II. Functional outcome was significantly good in surgically treated group at follow-ups. Conclusions: In this study ORIF with plate osteosynthesis of acute displaced mid shaft clavicular <b>fractures</b> resulted in <b>faster</b> <b>fracture</b> union with less complications and good Functional outcome in group I {{compared to those who}} were treated conservatively.

In a given range of driving velocity, the peeling displays a multi-scale unstable dynamics, with two well-separated spatio-temporal scales, which corresponds to microscopic and macroscopic dynamical stick-slip instabilities. We show that the microscopic stick-slip dynamics [...] which presents very different characteristics than the well-known macroscopic instability [...] is related to a high-frequency periodic release of the elastic bending energy of the adhesive ribbon concentrated at {{the vicinity of the}} peeling front.

40|$|Positive {{effects of}} Capacitive Coupling Electric Field (CCEF) {{stimulation}} are described for several orthopedic indications {{such as the}} healing of recent fractures, non-unions and spinal fusion, due to the capacity to involve the up-regulation of osteopromotive factors. In vitro studies on MC 3 T 3 -E 1 bone cells showed that CCEF acts opening the plasma membrane voltage gated calcium channels, thus increasing the cytosolic calcium concentration and the phospholipase A 2 (PLA 2) activity. Cytosolic calcium activates the calmodulin pathway, thus resulting in an up-regulated expression of osteogenic genes, such as transforming growth factor-β superfamily genes (TGF-β 1, -β 2 -β 3, bone morphogenetic protein- 2 and - 4), fibroblast growth factor (FGF) - 2, osteocalcin (BGP) and alkaline phosphatase (ALP). PLA 2 acts increasing the synthesis of Prostaglandin E 2 (PGE 2), which promotes osteogenesis by raising the cellular L-ascorbic acid uptake through the membrane carrier sodium vitamin C transporter- 2 (SVCT- 2). In vivo, Brighton et al. in a castration-induced osteoporosis animal model, demonstrated that CCEF was able to restore bone mass/unit volume in the rat vertebral body. To investigate the role of CCEF stimulation in vertebral bone marrow edema (VBME) its percentage was assessed in 24 patients with 25 acute vertebral compression fractures (VCFs) conservatively treated with CCEF (group A) or without CCEF (group B) using serial MR imaging follow-up at 0, 30, 60, 90 days.

However, {{there is limited}} data available on the specific use of rhBMP- 2 in combination with unreamed nails for open tibia fractures. The intention {{of the current study}} was to analyse the medical and health-economic effects of rhBMP- 2 in Gustilo-Anderson grade III open tibia fractures treated with unreamed nails based on pooled data analysis of two previously published studies. Cox-regression analysis was performed on raw data of 90 patients that were either treated by standard of care with soft tissue management and unreamed nailing (SOC group) (n= 50) or with rhBMP- 2 in addition to soft tissue management and unreamed nailing (rhBMP- 2 group) (n= 40). For all types of revision, a significant lower percentage of patients (27. 5 %) of the rhBMP- 2 group had to be revised compared to 48 % of the patients of the SOC group (p= 0. 04). When only invasive secondary interventions such as bone grafting and nail exchange were considered, there was also a statistically significant reduction in the rhBMP- 2 group with a revision rate of 10. 0 % (4 of 40 patients) compared to the SOC group with a revision rate of 28. 0 % (14 of 50 patients) (p= 0. 01). Mean fracture healing time of 228 days in the rhBMP- 2 compared to 266 days in the SOC group was not statistically significant (p= 0. 24). Health-economic analysis based on a societal perspective with calculation of overall treatment costs after initial surgery and including productivity losses revealed savings of € 6, 239 for Germany and € 4, 752 for the UK in favor of rhBMP- 2 which was mainly driven by reduction of productivity losses due to <b>faster</b> <b>fracture</b> healing time.
