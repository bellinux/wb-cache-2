During {{an interview with the}} Daily Record's Polly Graham, Taylor stated [...] "Toyah's gobby and cocky and makes her parents' life a misery. But it's brilliant playing her, it's more fun than playing somebody nice." [...] Graham explained that both Toyah and her stepsister, Leanne (Jane Danson) were well known to the police for under-age drinking and burglary. Taylor said that she hated her character's clothes, as they were too revealing for her. She explained [...] "In the beginning, the clothes that Toyah wore were terrible. I was very conscious of my bum hanging out from these tiny mini-skirts. There are a lot of girls who wear those tarty skirts, but I never felt comfortable <b>in</b> <b>that</b> <b>sort</b> <b>of</b> thing." [...] Taylor also disliked Toyah's make-up, which was initially bright pink lipstick, a lot of black eyeliner and no foundation.|$|E

Taoiseach Brian Cowen also made known his disapproval later from New York: [...] "I didn't see what happened as the ref was leaving the pitch. But obviously none of that is justified. It was an exciting match obviously. But it doesn't justify anyone engaging <b>in</b> <b>that</b> <b>sort</b> <b>of</b> activity. So I wouldn't {{like to see it}} repeated anywhere". Cowen was also at the match.|$|E
2500|$|In an {{interview}} about Armageddon Sebastian spoke {{of how much}} The Memphis Album still influences his music, [...] "I headed across to Memphis and was very inspired by the music scene there. I got to work with some people who were instrumental in shaping the careers of artists who heavily influence me. Artists like Otis Redding, Sam & Dave and Sam Cooke. Being entrenched <b>in</b> <b>that</b> <b>sort</b> <b>of</b> environment really caused me to go 'You know what dude. Do {{what you want to}} do. Do what comes natural to you'." [...] Sebastian said it was a turning point for him, adding, [...] "From that Memphis thing a few years ago it's always going to start with me being true to who I want to be and what I enjoy singing." [...] Sebastian feels his soul roots remained even when he delved into electro dance music with the single [...] "Who's That Girl" [...] from his previous album, explaining it was an old school Sam Cooke type of melody, with modern lyrics, over a dance track. He said, [...] "I had that melody, and I could have gone so many ways with it. I could have produced an old-school soul song, but I went towards what you hear on the radio." ...|$|E

2500|$|The Daily Telegraph music editor Kathy McCabe said: [...] "Sometimes {{it takes}} four records, with a detour into [...] "concepts" [...] covers {{territory}} to find where you fit. Sebastian has found his niche with Like It Like That, which expertly balances {{the line between}} radio friendly pop and classic soul". Paul Cashmere from Undercover wrote: [...] "By covering the classics on The Memphis Album Guy Sebastian discovered Guy Sebastian. [...] If The Memphis Album was Guy's initiation into becoming a Soul Man then Like It Like That is the graduation." [...] In an interview {{for the release of}} his seventh album Armageddon, Sebastian spoke of how much The Memphis Album still influences his music: [...] "I got to work with some people who were instrumental in shaping the careers of artists who heavily influence me.
