2500|$|... "I {{began to}} read {{screenplay}}s that were being made, and <b>I</b> <b>hesitate</b> <b>to</b> say this, but I guess I read them and said: 'Christ, I could do that.'" [...] It took him [...] "four to five years to write my first screenplay writing at night, while I still had another day job." ...|$|E
2500|$|... "Sir/Ma'am, {{not being}} {{informed}} {{to the highest}} degree of accuracy <b>I</b> <b>hesitate</b> <b>to</b> articulate for fear that I may deviate from the true course of rectitude. In short Sir/Ma'am, I am a very dumb fish, and do not know, Sir/Ma'am!" [...] (given in response to any question to which the above four answers do not apply; this answer is recited as quickly as possible) ...|$|E
2500|$|At {{this time}} Kossowski began to pray, [...] " [...] … because when I was so deep in this {{calamity}} and nearly dead I promised myself that if I {{came out of}} this subhuman land I would tender my thanks to God. <b>I</b> <b>hesitate</b> <b>to</b> call it a vow, it was rather a promise to myself but later I used to think that it was my obligation …" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Because I've {{suddenly}} grown dignified, I suppose," [...] she said. [...] "And then, of course, <b>I</b> <b>hesitated</b> <b>to</b> intrude upon such {{a person}} of importance as you have become, Humphrey." ...|$|R
60|$|But {{when at last}} I {{had worked}} myself back to a firm {{position}} <b>I</b> <b>hesitated</b> <b>to</b> ascend, since <b>I</b> could not know that Thurid was not still awaiting me above.|$|R
6000|$|... "I'm begging your pardon," [...] replied Pan, hastily. [...] "But we'd {{never been}} pardners and <b>I</b> <b>hesitated</b> <b>to</b> draw {{you into a}} scrap that'll almost sure go to gun throwing." ...|$|R
2500|$|The {{number of}} {{transistors}} per chip cannot explain quality-adjusted microprocessor prices fully. Moore's 1995 paper does not limit Moore's law to strict linearity or to transistor count, [...] "The definition of 'Moore's Law' {{has come to}} refer to almost anything related to the semiconductor industry that when plotted on semi-log paper approximates a straight line. <b>I</b> <b>hesitate</b> <b>to</b> review its origins and by doing so restrict its definition." ...|$|E
60|$|There {{are those}} who have blamed the man for that, but until I know my own courage better, <b>I</b> <b>hesitate</b> <b>to</b> join their number.|$|E
6000|$|... "Exactly," [...] said Gys, {{his voice}} quiet and pleasant. [...] "I don't blame you and I'm not offended. Do you wonder <b>I</b> <b>hesitate</b> <b>to</b> meet strangers?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Oh, my dear, you know. What {{else have}} we been talking about? It costs you {{so much to be}} liked. That's why <b>I</b> <b>hesitated</b> <b>to</b> tell you of my letter." ...|$|R
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>hesitated.</b> <b>To</b> {{tell the}} truth, an idea, wild and extravagant in itself, had {{once or twice}} that morning flashed through my brain. I had {{rejected}} it as absurd, nevertheless it persisted.|$|R
60|$|The {{hour was}} crucial, though I knew it not. I stood at a parting of ways; yet {{for lack of}} courage <b>I</b> <b>hesitated</b> <b>to</b> take the road to which so invitingly he beckoned me.|$|R
6000|$|It {{made him}} moan, {{it made him}} groan, And almost wore him to a mummy. Why should <b>I</b> <b>hesitate</b> <b>to</b> own That pain was in his little tummy? ...|$|E
6000|$|... "That's the way {{the matter}} {{appeared}} to me," [...] said she; [...] "but the question would arise, if it were all right, why should <b>I</b> <b>hesitate</b> <b>to</b> tell the sisters?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "To Calvary," [...] {{he replied}} coldly, as {{he rose to}} leave the room. [...] "But <b>I</b> <b>hesitate</b> <b>to</b> ask you to come,--I am afraid you will not find a {{religion}} there that suits you." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "There is no need," [...] said Professor Ainslie Grey, {{stepping}} {{in through the}} open casement. [...] "I have overheard {{the latter part of}} your conversation. <b>I</b> <b>hesitated</b> <b>to</b> interrupt you before you came to a conclusion." ...|$|R
60|$|It {{is quite}} {{unnecessary}} {{to say that}} Marian's letter threatened me. Everybody threatens me. All sorts of horrors were to fall on my devoted head if <b>I</b> <b>hesitated</b> <b>to</b> turn Limmeridge House into an asylum for my niece and her misfortunes. <b>I</b> did <b>hesitate,</b> nevertheless.|$|R
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>hesitated</b> <b>to</b> {{tell her}} that it would {{probably}} be necessary for me to leave the country immediately, but she did not encourage me to go on, and, glancing round, I discovered that she was fast asleep.|$|R
6000|$|... "You {{have taken}} the ground from beneath my feet," [...] he declared. [...] "Your opinion of me is such that <b>I</b> <b>hesitate</b> <b>to</b> proceed {{at all in the}} matter which I desired to discuss with you." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "It {{has been}} so {{nice to have you}} here," [...] she said, [...] "but if you only knew how {{difficult}} it was to arrange, it, you'd understand why <b>I</b> <b>hesitate</b> <b>to</b> ask you to come again." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "One of the {{complainants}} forwarded it to me. He said he--obtained--it," [...] was the dry answer. [...] "Under the circumstances, <b>I</b> <b>hesitate</b> <b>to</b> make direct use of it, {{but by the}} firm's stamp it appears genuine." ...|$|E
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>hesitated</b> how <b>to</b> answer. To say {{the least}} of it, her request embarrassed me.|$|R
60|$|He rose, {{and began}} walking thoughtfully {{up and down the}} room. Twice, I was on the point of telling him that I had {{determined}} on seeing Rachel personally; and twice, having regard to his age and his character, <b>I</b> <b>hesitated</b> <b>to</b> take him by surprise at an unfavourable moment.|$|R
6000|$|The {{associations}} amid which I was {{now living}} had their softening effect on my heart, their elevating influence over my mind. I reproached myself, bitterly reproached myself, {{for not having}} written more fully and frankly to Eustace. Why had <b>I</b> <b>hesitated</b> <b>to</b> sacrifice to him my hopes and my interests in the coming investigation? He had not hesitated, poor fellow--his first thought was {{the thought of his}} wife! ...|$|R
60|$|That is {{the story}} of the {{assassination}} of Henry IV. re-told in the light of certain records which appear to me to have been insufficiently studied. They should suggest a train of speculation leading to inferences which, whilst obvious, <b>I</b> <b>hesitate</b> <b>to</b> define absolutely.|$|E
6000|$|... "You-you have omitted something, Sire," [...] I ventured, and I {{returned}} to the table. [...] "I am already so grateful that <b>I</b> <b>hesitate</b> <b>to</b> ask an additional favour. Yet it is but troubling you to add a few strokes of the pen, {{and it will not}} materially affect the sentence itself." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "'Divinest' {{is a large}} term, Bickley, and one {{to which}} <b>I</b> <b>hesitate</b> <b>to</b> subscribe, remembering as I do certain of the prophets and the Early Fathers with all their faults, not of course to mention the Apostles. But--" [...] here he paused, for {{suddenly}} {{all three of us}} became aware of Oro.|$|E
60|$|There was no answer. It {{was really}} rather mysterious, {{and it seemed}} to me that Stroeve, {{standing}} just behind, was trembling in his shoes. For a moment <b>I</b> <b>hesitated</b> <b>to</b> strike a light. I dimly perceived a bed in the corner, and I wondered whether the light would disclose lying on it a dead body.|$|R
60|$|I didn't relish hiding. But when I {{thought of}} the innumerable dangers which {{surrounded}} us and the comparatively small amount of ammunition that I had with me, <b>I</b> <b>hesitated</b> <b>to</b> provoke a battle with Buckingham and his warriors when, by flight, I could avoid them and preserve my cartridges against emergencies {{which could not be}} escaped.|$|R
6000|$|When {{it came to}} {{speaking}} to this great learned man, I began to fear that he would think me a weak fool, and Jonathan a madman, that journal is all so strange, and <b>I</b> <b>hesitated</b> <b>to</b> go on. But he was so sweet and kind, and he had promised to help, and I trusted him, so I said, ...|$|R
6000|$|... "It is {{not that}} I doubt you, Dunham, that <b>I</b> <b>hesitate</b> <b>to</b> reveal all I may happen to know; but from a strong {{reluctance}} to circulate an evil report concerning one of whom I have hitherto thought well. You must think well of the Pathfinder, or you would not wish to give him your daughter?" ...|$|E
60|$|What's the use {{to go into}} details? One or {{two will}} be enough. I {{remember}} Major Tallahassee Tucker playing on a jew's-harp, and Caligula waltzing with {{his head on the}} watch pocket of a tall baggage-master. <b>I</b> <b>hesitate</b> <b>to</b> refer to the cake-walk done by me and Mr. Patterson G. Coble with Colonel Jackson T. Rockingham between us.|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{remember}} it vividly," [...] Pym {{used to say}} when questioned in the after years about this his first sight of Tommy, [...] "and <b>I</b> <b>hesitate</b> <b>to</b> decide which impressed me more, the richness of his voice, so remarkable in a boy of sixteen, or his serene countenance, with its noble forehead, behind which nothing base could lurk." ...|$|E
6000|$|For {{some time}} <b>I</b> <b>hesitated</b> <b>to</b> take the Mahar back with me. She had been docile and quiet {{ever since she}} had {{discovered}} herself virtually a prisoner aboard the [...] "iron mole." [...] It had been, of course, {{impossible for me to}} communicate with her since she had no auditory organs and I no knowledge of her fourth-dimension, sixth-sense method of communication.|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{was afraid}} she would be--I knew she would be, in fact; and {{for that very reason}} <b>I</b> <b>hesitated</b> <b>to</b> do it, as <b>I</b> <b>hesitated</b> <b>to</b> dance with you the first time I met you, as soon as I knew who you really were. But I felt I ought to face it out. You know by this time, no doubt, Miss Hazleden, that my mother was once a slave on your grandfather's estate. Now, it is a theory of mine--a little Quixotic, perhaps, but still a theory of mine--that the guilt and the shame of slavery lay with the slave-owners (forgive me if I must needs speak against your own class), and not with the slaves or their descendants. We have nothing on earth to be ashamed of. Thinking thus, I felt it {{incumbent}} upon me to call at Palmettos, partly in defence of my general principles, and partly also because I wished to see whether you shared your mother's ideas on that subject." ...|$|R
60|$|We were in need {{of fresh}} meat, yet <b>I</b> <b>hesitated</b> <b>to</b> shatter the quiet and {{peaceful}} serenity of the view with the crack of a rifle {{and the death of}} one of those beautiful creatures before us. But it had to be done--we must eat. I left the work to Delcarte, however, and in a moment we had two antelope and the landscape to ourselves.|$|R
