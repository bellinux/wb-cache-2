40|$|Neighborhood walkability shows {{significant}} positive relationship with residents' <b>walking</b> <b>for</b> transport in cross-sectional studies. We examined prospective relationships of neighborhood walkability {{with the change}} in walking behaviors over 4 years among middle-to-older aged adults (50 - 65 years) residing in Adelaide, Australia. Methods: A baseline survey was conducted during 2003 - 2004, and a follow-up survey during 2007 - 2008. Walking <b>for</b> transport and <b>walking</b> <b>for</b> recreation were assessed at both times among 504 adults aged 50 - 65 years living in objectively determined high- and low-walkable neighborhoods. Multilevel linear regression analyses examined the associations of neighborhood walkability with changes over 4 years in <b>walking</b> <b>for</b> transport and <b>walking</b> <b>for</b> recreation. Results: On average, participants decreased their time spent in <b>walking</b> <b>for</b> transport (- 4. 1 min/day) and for recreation (- 3. 7 min/day) between the baseline and 4 -year follow-up. However, those living in high-walkable neighborhoods showed significantly smaller reduction (adjusted mean change: - 1. 1 min/day) in their time spent in <b>walking</b> <b>for</b> transport than did those living in low-walkable neighborhoods (- 6. 7 min/day). No such statistically-significant differences were found with the changes in <b>walking</b> <b>for</b> recreation. Conclusions: High-walkable neighborhoods may help middle-to-older aged adults to maintain their <b>walking</b> <b>for</b> transport...|$|R
40|$|INTRODUCTION: Assessing {{the contextual}} factors that {{influence}} <b>walking</b> <b>for</b> transportation is important to develop more walkable environments and promote physical activity. To advance previous research focused on residential environments and overall <b>walking</b> <b>for</b> transportation, {{the present study investigates}} objective environmental factors assessed around the residence, the workplace, the home [...] work itinerary, and the home [...] supermarket itinerary, and considered overall <b>walking</b> <b>for</b> transportation but also walking to work and to shops. METHODS: Data from the RECORD Study involving 7290 participants recruited in 2007 - 2008, aged 30 - 79 years, and residing in the Paris metropolitan area were analyzed. Multilevel ordinal regression analyses were conducted to investigate environmental characteristics associated with self-reported overall <b>walking</b> <b>for</b> transportation, <b>walking</b> to work, and walking to shops. RESULTS: High individual education was associated with overall <b>walking</b> <b>for</b> transportation, with <b>walking</b> to work, and walking to shops. Among workers, a high residential neighborhood education was associated with increased overall <b>walking</b> <b>for</b> transportation, while a high workplace neighborhood education was related to an increased time spent walking to work. The residential density of destinations was positively associated with overall <b>walking</b> <b>for</b> transportation, with <b>walking</b> to work, and with walking to shops, while the workplace density of destinations was positively associated with overall <b>walking</b> <b>for</b> transportation among workers. Environmental factors assessed around the itineraries were not associated with walking to work or to the shops. CONCLUSION: This research improves our understanding {{of the role of the}} environments on <b>walking</b> <b>for</b> transportation by accounting for some of the environments visited beyond the residential neighborhood. It shows that workers' walking habits are more influenced by the density of destinations around the workplace than around the residence. These results provide insight for the development of policies and programs to encourage population level active commuting...|$|R

5|$|Although fewer postcranial remains {{have been}} {{discovered}} for Hadropithecus than for Archaeolemur, what has been found indicates that both were adapted for a terrestrial or semi-terrestrial lifestyle, an unusual trait for lemurs. Both genera had short limbs and a powerful build.

40|$|Objective: To {{investigate}} {{the contribution of}} personal, social and environmental factors to mediating socioeconomic (educational) inequalities in women’s leisure-time <b>walking</b> and <b>walking</b> <b>for</b> transport. Methods: A community sample of 1282 women provided survey data on <b>walking</b> <b>for</b> leisure and transport; educational level; enjoyment of, and self-efficacy for, walking; physical activity barriers and intentions; social support for physical activity; sporting/recreational club membership; dog ownership; and perceived environmental aesthetics and safety. These data were linked with objective environmental data on the density of public open space and walking tracks in the women’s local neighbourhood, coastal proximity and street connectivity. Results: Multilevel modelling showed that different personal, social and environmental factors were associated with <b>walking</b> <b>for</b> leisure and <b>walking</b> <b>for</b> transport. Variables from all three domains explained (mediated) educational inequalities in leisure-time walking, including neighbourhood walking tracks; coastal proximity; friends’ social support; dog ownership; self-efficacy, enjoyment and intentions. On the other hand, few of the variables examined explained educational variations in <b>walking</b> <b>for</b> transport, exceptions being neighbourhood, coastal proximity, street connectivity and social support from family. Conclusions: Public health initiatives aimed at promoting, and reducing educational inequalities in, leisure-time walking should incorporate a focus on environmental strategies, such as advocating <b>for</b> neighbourhood <b>walking</b> tracks, as well as personal and social factors. Further investigation is required {{to better understand the}} pathways by which education might influence <b>walking</b> <b>for</b> transport. <br /...|$|R

5|$|Birds are {{tetrapods}} {{but though}} their hind limbs are used <b>for</b> <b>walking</b> or hopping, their front limbs are wings covered with feathers and adapted for flight. Birds are endothermic, {{have a high}} metabolic rate, a light skeletal system and powerful muscles. The long bones are thin, hollow and very light. Air sac extensions from the lungs occupy the centre of some bones. The sternum is wide and usually has a keel and the caudal vertebrae are fused. There are no teeth and the narrow jaws are adapted into a horn-covered beak. The eyes are relatively large, particularly in nocturnal species such as owls. They face forwards in predators and sideways in ducks.|$|E

5|$|It {{has been}} {{suggested}} that the evolution of the tetrapod limb from fins in lobe-finned fishes is related to expression of the HOXD13 gene or the loss of the proteins actinodin 1 and actinodin 2, which are involved in fish fin development. Robot simulations suggest that the necessary nervous circuitry <b>for</b> <b>walking</b> evolved from the nerves governing swimming, utilizing the sideways oscillation of the body with the limbs primarily functioning as anchoring points and providing limited thrust. This type of movement, as well as changes to the pectoral girdle are similar to those seen in the fossil record can be induced in bichirs by raising then out of water.|$|E

5|$|Larval ticks hatch {{with six}} legs, {{acquiring}} {{the other two}} after a blood meal and molting into the nymph stage. In the nymphal and adult stages, ticks have eight legs, {{each of which has}} seven segments and is tipped with a pair of claws. The legs are sometimes ornamented and usually bear sensory or tactile hairs. In addition to being used for locomotion, the tarsus of leg I contains a unique sensory structure, Haller's organ, which can detect odors and chemicals emanating from the host, as well as sensing changes in temperature and air currents. When not being used <b>for</b> <b>walking,</b> the legs remain tightly folded against the body.|$|E

40|$|Background: The {{physical}} attributes of residential neighborhoods, particularly the connectedness of {{streets and the}} proximity of destinations, can influence walking behaviors. To provide the evidence for public health advocacy on activity-friendly environments, large-scale studies in different countries are needed. Associations of neighborhood physical environments with adults 2 ̆ 7 <b>walking</b> <b>for</b> transport and <b>walking</b> <b>for</b> recreation must be better understood. Method: Walking <b>for</b> transport and <b>walking</b> <b>for</b> recreation were assessed with a validated survey among 2650 adults recruited from neighborhoods in an Australian city between July 2003 and June 2004, with neighborhoods selected to have either high or low walkability, based on objective measures of connectedness and proximity derived from geographic information systems (GIS) databases. The study design was stratified by area-level socioeconomic status, while analyses controlled for participant age, gender, individual-level socioeconomic status, and reasons for neighborhood self-selection. Results: A strong independent positive association was found between weekly frequency of <b>walking</b> <b>for</b> transport and the objectively derived neighborhood walkability index. Preference for walkable neighborhoods moderated the relationship of walkability with weekly minutes, but not the frequency of <b>walking</b> <b>for</b> transport-walkability was {{related to higher frequency}} of transport walking, irrespective of neighborhood self-selection. There were no significant associations between environmental factors and <b>walking</b> <b>for</b> recreation. Conclusions: Associations of neighborhood walkability attributes with <b>walking</b> <b>for</b> transport were confirmed in Australia. They accounted for a modest but statistically significant proportion of the total variation of the relevant walking behavior. The physical environment attributes that make up the walkability index are potentially important candidate factors for future environmental and policy initiatives designed to increase physical activity...|$|R
