5|$|His {{primary focus}} was gay-themed writing, though {{he also wrote}} about the {{entertainment}} industry. Mostly satirical, his writing was filled with increasingly clear anger and disdain for the Republican neo-con agenda, especially after the AIDS pandemic began to take a large toll on the <b>gay</b> <b>community.</b> A very strong voice in gay literature, Baker had admirers and detractors for his gay radical stance, both in the mainstream literary {{community as well as}} the <b>gay</b> <b>community</b> itself.|$|E
5|$|Congressman Phillip Burton, Assemblyman Willie Brown, {{and other}} California {{politicians}} recognized the growing clout {{and organization of}} homosexuals in the city, and courted their votes by attending meetings {{of gay and lesbian}} organizations. Brown pushed for legalization of sex between consenting adults in 1969 but failed. SIR was also pursued by popular moderate Supervisor Dianne Feinstein in her bid to become mayor, opposing Alioto. Ex-policeman Richard Hongisto worked for 10 years to change the conservative views of the San Francisco Police Department, and also actively appealed to the <b>gay</b> <b>community,</b> which responded by raising significant funds for his campaign for sheriff. Though Feinstein was unsuccessful, Hongisto's win in 1971 showed the political clout of the <b>gay</b> <b>community.</b>|$|E

50|$|Manalansan gives a {{detailed}} description of the topography of New York City in order to show the actual physical and cultural barriers that exists between the different boroughs and the <b>gay</b> <b>communities</b> that exist there. Outside of Manhattan, the <b>gay</b> <b>communities</b> are divided by cultural and racial barriers; the Latinx, Asian, and Black <b>gay</b> <b>communities</b> do not overlap and are also physically distanced from each other. Space is inherently racialized. The racialized <b>gay</b> <b>communities</b> and spaces in New York City only further alienate queer people of color and make them less valued and validated in gay culture.|$|R

5|$|When Dan White {{was found}} guilty of {{involuntary}} manslaughter, his successful diminished capacity defense enraged the <b>gay</b> <b>community.</b> That the police and fire departments had raised money for his defense gave their anger a focus, turning it against the city government and especially the SFPD.|$|E
5|$|With the 1979 {{municipal}} elections occurring only {{months after the}} riot, prominent gay leaders feared a backlash at the polls. The elections continued without incident, and the <b>gay</b> <b>community</b> fared better than expected, wielding unprecedented influence. Although the virtually unknown gay Mayoral candidate David Scott {{finished third in the}} election, his showing was strong enough to force Mayor Feinstein into a runoff election against conservative City Supervisor Quentin Kopp. Feinstein's promises to appoint more gay people to public office, and her heavy campaigning in the Castro, ensured that she won enough support from the <b>gay</b> <b>community</b> to give her a full term as Mayor.|$|E
5|$|Authors Joyce Murdoch and Deb Pryce {{say another}} {{effect of the}} case was a {{softening}} of the Court's attitude towards the <b>gay</b> <b>community.</b> Jacobson was the first such person to come before the Court to receive even the slightest empathy from it, {{and even a few}} years earlier his case might have been doomed from the start on that basis alone.|$|E
50|$|Bourne Free was {{originally}} {{set up in}} 2004 when a far right organisation was due to come to Bournemouth and preach that homosexuality was wrong. Many prominent figures and active members of the <b>gay</b> <b>communities</b> in the area came together to organise an event in the Lower Gardens to protect the <b>gay</b> <b>communities</b> from the homophobes and keep them together {{for a day of}} celebration, rather than of hostility.|$|R
50|$|Bears {{are almost}} always gay or {{bisexual}} men; transgender men (regardless of their sexuality) and those who shun labels for gender and sexuality are increasingly included within bear communities. The bear community has spread all over the world, with bear clubs in many countries. Bear clubs often serve as social and sexual networks for older, hairier, sometimes heavier gay and bisexual men, and members often contribute to their local <b>gay</b> <b>communities</b> through fundraising and other functions. Bear events are common in heavily <b>gay</b> <b>communities.</b>|$|R
40|$|Part I of this Article explores {{lesbian and}} gay {{interests}} and representational characteristics. Part II highlights the inadequacies of a single-member districting system in representing the interests of lesbian and <b>gay</b> <b>communities.</b> It concludes with {{an examination of the}} New York City Council 2 Ì† 7 s 1991 redistricting, where the mobilization of strong lesbian and <b>gay</b> <b>communities</b> in a receptive environment nonetheless failed to lead to effective representation of {{lesbian and gay}} interests in the City Council. Part III describes proportional representation systems and reveals how such systems would better serve lesbian and <b>gay</b> <b>communities.</b> Part IV acknowledges the political and legal obstacles to achieving proportional representation. Finally, Part V asserts that both the increasing disenfranchisement of people of color from the electoral process and the high degree of discontent with the system that has been expressed by the general electorate in recent years might facilitate the conversion to a proportional system. To promote a proportional representation system, lesbian and <b>gay</b> <b>communities</b> must form coalitions with other minority communities that remain underrepresented in a districting system. By struggling with others to achieve interest representation, lesbians and gay men will be engaged in the furtherance of a much broader goal of proportional representation [...] namely, the realization of a more complete democracy...|$|R
5|$|In the {{following}} days, gay leaders refused {{to apologize for}} {{the events of that}} night. This led to increased political power in the <b>gay</b> <b>community,</b> which culminated in the election of Mayor Dianne Feinstein to a full term {{the following}} November. In response to a campaign promise, Feinstein appointed a pro-gay Chief of Police, which increased recruitment of gay people in the police force and eased tensions.|$|E
5|$|LGBT, or GLBT, is an initialism {{that stands}} for lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender. In use since the 1990s, {{the term is}} an {{adaptation}} of the initialism LGB, which was used to replace the term gay {{in reference to the}} LGBT community beginning in the mid-to-late 1980s. Activists believed that the term <b>gay</b> <b>community</b> did not accurately represent all those to whom it referred.|$|E

5|$|Several {{days later}} Herb Caen, a {{columnist}} at The San Francisco Chronicle, exposed Sipple as gay {{and a friend}} of Milk's. The announcement was picked up by national newspapers, and Milk's name was included in many of the stories. Time magazine named Milk as a leader in San Francisco's <b>gay</b> <b>community.</b> Sipple, however, was besieged by reporters, as was his family. His mother, a staunch Baptist in Detroit, now refused to speak to him. Although he had been involved with the <b>gay</b> <b>community</b> for years, even participating in Gay Pride events, Sipple sued the Chronicle for invasion of privacy. President Ford sent Sipple a note of thanks for saving his life. Milk said that Sipple's sexual orientation was the reason he received only a note, rather than an invitation to the White House.|$|E

5|$|Although the June 28, 1969, Stonewall riots are {{generally}} considered {{the starting point}} of the modern gay liberation movement, a number of demonstrations and actions took place before that date. These actions, often organized by local homophile organizations but sometimes spontaneous, addressed concerns ranging from anti-gay discrimination in employment and public accommodations to the exclusion of homosexuals from the United States military to police harassment to the treatment of homosexuals in revolutionary Cuba. The early actions have been credited with preparing the <b>gay</b> <b>community</b> for Stonewall and contributing to the riots' symbolic power.|$|E
5|$|In 2004, Newsom gained {{national}} attention when he directed the San Francisco cityâ€“county clerk to issue marriage licenses to same-sex couples, {{in violation of}} the then-current state law. In August 2004, the Supreme Court of California annulled the marriages that Newsom had authorized, as they conflicted with state law at that time.

5|$|News of Chatwin's AIDS {{diagnosis}} first {{surfaced in}} September 1988. However, {{at the time}} of his death, obituaries referred to Chatwin's statements about a rare fungal infection. Following his death, members of the <b>gay</b> <b>community</b> criticised Chatwin for lacking the courage to reveal the true nature of his illness, which some people think would have raised public awareness of AIDS, as he was one of the first high-profile individuals in Great Britain known to have contracted HIV.|$|E

Upon its initial release, the film was critically panned due to violent content, but later received critical acclaim. The film did well at the box office, grossing over US$45 million domestically. Pacino earned a Golden Globe nomination for his role as Cuban drug lord Tony Montana.|$|E

40|$|International audienceWhile stigma {{associated}} with HIV infection is well recognised, {{there is limited}} information {{on the impact of}} HIV-related stigma between {{men who have sex with}} men and among members of <b>gay</b> <b>communities.</b> The consequences of HIV-related stigma can be personal and community-wide, including impacts on mood and emotional wellbeing, prevention, testing behaviour, and mental and general health. This review of the literature reports a growing division between HIV-positive and HIV-negative gay men, and a fragmentation of <b>gay</b> <b>communities</b> based along lines of perceived or actual HIV status. The literature includes multiple references to HIV stigma and discrimination between gay men, men who have sex with men, and among and between many <b>gay</b> <b>communities.</b> This HIV stigma takes diverse forms and can incorporate aspects of social exclusion, ageism, discrimination based on physical appearance and health status, rejection and violence. By compiling the available information on this understudied form of HIV-related discrimination, we hope to better understand and target research and countermeasures aimed at reducing its impact at multiple levels...|$|R
