Within {{the area of the}} Râmeţului Gorge {{and as a result of}} the interactions of all natural and antropic elements a great variety of geo-facets can be identified, starting with those in biostasy or rhexistasy, meagerly affected by the human intervention and continuing with the geo-facets in parastasy identified in the areas most affected by the human intervention. In a systemic perception, the Râmeţului Gorge, as well the entire unit of the Trascău Mountains is the result of an almost perfect synergy between the natural elements that marked the presence and the development of the current antropic ones...|$|E

40|$|Students' {{perspectives}} in jazz education have gone largely ignored. A modified analytic inductive design {{allowed me to}} look broadly at the students' jazz band experience while specifically investigating their views about playing <b>individualized</b> <b>parts,</b> improvising, and interpreting and articulating swing rhythms. A focus group procedure was altered (Krueger, 1995) and incorporated into my teaching of 19 students. Two 30 minute sessions per week over a 12 week period were video- and audiotaped. Audiotaped exit interviews provided data in a non-social environment. All data were transcribed and coded {{in order to identify}} major themes and trends. Conclusions were verified through member checks, several types of triangulation and other qualitative analysis techniques. Trustworthiness was determined through an audit. Cognitively and physically, students had to accommodate musical techniques as these differed from those used in concert band. Some students were confused by the new seating arrangement and the playing of <b>individualized</b> <b>parts.</b> While some students could perform distinctly different swing and straight interpretations of the same song without external cues, others could only perform this task with external cues. Some changes in articulation were well within the students' capabilities while other techniques were more difficult to accommodate. Several students felt 'uptight' while they improvised alone in front of their peers, noting group improvisation and rhythmic embellishment of familiar tunes as being helpful in assuaging these feelings. Students recognized the environmental differences between concert band and jazz band, and reported more freedom of expression in jazz band. Particularly enjoying this freedom, the more willing improvisors banded together as a clique. The students' learning was viewed as being situated in the context of jazz band. 'Musical perturbation' and cognitive apprenticeship described students' physical and cognitive accommodation of the new context. The instructional strategies students found to be most helpful were student-centered and derived from cognitive behavior modification and scaffolding theory...|$|R

40|$|Powder {{coatings}} provide {{several advantages}} over traditional coatings: environmental friendliness, freedom of design, robustness and resistance of surfaces, possibility to seamlessly all-around coating, fast production process, cost-effectiveness. In {{the last years}} these benefits of the powder coating technology have been adopted from metal to heat-sensitive natural fibre/ wood based substrates (especially medium density fibre boards- MDF) used for interior furniture applications. Powder coated MDF furniture parts are gaining market share already in the classic furniture applications kitchen, bathroom, living and offices. The acceptance of this product is increasing as reflected by excellent growth rates and an increasing customer base. Current efforts of the powder coating industry to develop new powders with higher reactivity (i. e. lower curing temperatures and shorter curing times; e. g. 120 °C/ 5 min) will enable the powder coating of other heat-sensitive substrates like natural fibre composites, wood plastic composites, light weight panels and different plastics in the future. The coating could be applied and cured by the conventional powder coating process (electrostatic application, and melting and curing in an IR-oven) or by a new powder coating procedure based on the in-mould-coating (IMC) technique which is already established in the plastic industry. Extra value could be added in the future by the functional powder toner printing of powder coated substrates using the electrophotographic printing technology, meeting the future demand of both individualization of the furniture part surface by applying functional 3 D textures and patterns and individually created coloured images and enabling shorter delivery times for these <b>individualized</b> <b>parts.</b> The paper describes the distinctiveness of powder coating on natural fibre/ wood based substrates, {{the requirements of the}} substrate and the coating powder...|$|R
40|$|We {{formulated}} five {{proposals to}} improve specifications of flood hazard reduction projects and five proposals {{to preserve the}} river ecosystem functions, based on literature and authors' experience. Starting from these, we established a conceptual approach using the notion of riverscape, with related function richness and bioassessment tools. Wedefined four riverscape types based on the gradient of artificialness, from type I (impervious bed) to type IV (less than 30 % or no artificial bed). To apply our approach to dry dam designs, we <b>individualized</b> different <b>parts</b> of dry dams and characterized them by an ideal riverscape type, according to the hydraulic constraints of each part. Type I is unavoidable in the bottom outlet, and types I or II {{at the foot of}} the dam. Types III (3050 % of artificial bed) and IV were recommended at upper and lower parts of the dam, according to the risk of bank erosion and need for bank reinforcements. The approach appeared efficient to help biologists and hydraulic practitioners work together, and find technical solutions complying with both flood protection and biodiversity preservation requirement...|$|R
40|$|Nowadays {{a lot of}} structures, like ships, aircrafts, wind {{turbines}} and engines are designed as lightweight structures. They are susceptible to disturbances caused by vibrations and other mostly unwanted excitations. Hence the performance, lifetime and system behavior of the structures are negatively influenced. One strategy to overcome these drawbacks might be an integration of actuators in such a system. As smart devices piezoceramic multilayer actuators (MLA) can be used. They offer the possibility of high level system integration and can generate strong forces. For low-cost system control, semi-passive or-active techniques can be used. The performances of both strategies depend mainly on the ratio of energy which can be transformed from the mechanical structure into electrical circuits. The generalized electromechanical coupling coefficient, a common measure describing this energy transfer, is highly influenced by the host structure's stiffness or the housing. Thus, a flexible and adjustable manufacturing technology is needed to optimize this generalized coupling factor. Emerging additive manufacturing technologies such as selective laser melting (SLM) are capable of a cost-efficient production of <b>individualized</b> <b>parts</b> in rather small production runs and to meet the manufacturing constraints of highly integrated components. In the presented research work SLM is used to manufacture active struts by fully integrating MLA into a metallic, monolithic housing. Besides the fulfillment of associated manufacturing constraints (e. g. low volume, individualization), a major objective {{of this study is}} to demonstrate the potential of SLM for application tailored smart components. A six cell truss structure is used as demonstration platform. Based on the numerical simulation of the truss structure and the application of the elastic strain intensity criterion the positioning of the active strut as well as the mode to be damped are determined. A numerical implementation of the active strut, specifically the piezoceramic actuator and corresponding housing, allows the dimensioning of the housing stiffness using the generalized electromechanical coupling factor criterion and are a starting point in the design of a resistive resonant shunt (RL-shunt). Using the results from the numerical simulation active struts with specific stiffness characteristics are manufactured via SLM. An experimental modal analysis of the truss structure is carried out. Measurements with connected RL-shunts using the active struts are performed and compared to the passive system. Results indicate an efficient damping of the desired mode by means of application tailored active struts. In addition, a good accordance between simulation and experimental results is obtained. This allows rapid design and positioning of active struts and corresponding RL-shunts for future work...|$|R

As <b>part</b> of an educational reform, all schools in Israel are obliged to implement small group instruction within the school curriculum. Novice teachers in their first year of teaching are part of the school staff from day one; therefore, they have to implement small group instruction in their teaching. Our objective is to present the results of research which aimed to clarify how novice Physical Education and EFL teachers understand and implement these individualized teaching hours and programs as they enter teaching in their first year, and what teacher education programs can do to enhance this process...|$|R
5000|$|The concerto has a {{duration}} of roughly 25 minutes and is composed in two numbered movements. The work is built upon techniques from two previous Carter's pieces: his String Quartet No. 2 (1959) and the Double Concerto for Harpsichord and Piano with Two Chamber Orchestras (1961). Carter elaborated {{on this in}} the score program notes, writing: As in these, there are variously graded sequential and simultaneous oppositions of dramatic character and material associated with the musical protagonists: here, a concertino of three winds and four solo strings mediates between the <b>individualized</b> solo piano <b>part</b> and the orchestral mass. As the work progresses through its two movements, the soloist becomes increasingly disassociated from and opposed to the orchestra, each developing its own musical expression and material in its own way. A unifying musical discourse, however, joins the conflicting elements into one artistic whole.|$|R
40|$|Nowadays, {{there exist}} various {{standards}} for individual management systems (MSs), at least, {{one for each}} stakeholder. New ones will be published. An integrated management system (IMS) aims to integrate some or all components of the business into one coherent and efficient MS. Maximizing integration {{is more and more}} a strategic priority in that it constitutes an opportunity to eliminate and/or reduce potential factors of destruction of value for the organizations and also to be more competitive and consequently promote its sustainable success. A preliminary investigation was conducted on a Portuguese industrial company which, over the years, has been adopting gradually, in whole or in <b>part,</b> <b>individualized</b> management system standards (MSSs). A research, through a questionnaire, was performed with the objective to develop, in a real business environment, an adequate and efficient IMS-QES (quality, environment, and safety) model and to potentiate for the future a generic IMS model to integrate other MSSs. The strategy and research methods have taken into consideration the case study. It was obtained a set of relevant conclusions resulting from the statistical analyses of the responses to the survey. Globally, the investigation results, by themselves, justified and prioritized the conception of a model of development of the IMS-QES and consequent definition and validation of a structure of an IMS-QES model, to be implemented at the small- and medium-sized enterprise (SME) where the investigation was conducted...|$|R
40|$|Pennsylvania {{requires}} its {{school districts}} {{to address the needs}} of its gifted students, but their duty is limited to the use of their existing educational resources. I suggest rejection of this limitation under a modified model that uses a subjective standard in evaluating whether the district has fulfilled its duty to provide a free and appropriate public education to the gifted student through an <b>Individualized</b> Education Program. <b>Part</b> II of this Comment discusses the right to a free public education and then moves on to the specific treatment of gifted public school students. Part III highlights the need for a reformulation of the definition of public education. More specifically, public education should focus on individualized progress rather than proficiency. Part IV outlines how reliance on an improper conception of education allows the persistence of inequities in the public school system, which results in the violation of gifted students' rights to equal protection. Part V suggests that states adopt a modified version of the Pennsylvania model, which would reject the Pennsylvania Supreme Court's limitation on the duty of the school district and instead require proof that the district's curricular offerings are reasonable. This would make a judicial remedy available to gifted students whose reasonable needs are not being addressed because of unjust allocations of or disparities in district resources. The availability of a judicial remedy is especially crucial for gifted students who are already disadvantaged by disparities in educational resources. Part VI lists several issues to keep in mind as we attempt to cure inequities in the public education system while also acknowledging the financial and pedagogical realities of that system...|$|R
40|$|Over {{the last}} couple of years a new type of media has emerged. Individualized news is growing ever more popular; iGoogle, Netvibes, the {{personal}} front page of BBC are all examples of this. In a traditional gatekeeping context, the power of the gatekeeper is centralized and kept with the media. But in individualized news on online newspapers the power of gatekeeping is sliding towards the user. The thesis first introduces a new concept called “News Filter”. The News Filter is intended for the websites of omnibus online newspapers. In short the News Filter is a profile based web application that based on the users profile, choices and a segment analysis of the individual user, filters out content that is not relevant for that specific user. Afterwards the impact of the phenomenon individualized news and therefore the News Filter is investigated in the thesis. Using a combined research method consisting of a survey and interviews with users, the idea is discussed in a theoretical context. Given the fact, that both the concept and the field of individualized news are rather new, the theory available is sparse. Therefore the theoretical approach is a combination of several theoretical approaches using various theories for different purposes. Described and used in the thesis is among others Zygmunt Bauman, Mark Deuze, Axel Bruns, Mikael Karlsson, Martin Engebretsen, Joseph Thurow and Terje Rasmussen. The theory is applied to the research data that is analyzed taking into account, the various user types of the internet. In this thesis three types of users is identified; heavy users, light users and non users of online newspapers. The three user types is both discovered and discussed in the analysis part of the thesis. The thesis concludes that <b>individualized</b> news redistributes <b>part</b> of the power over the agenda to the users. This has impact on the ability of the media to setting the agenda. Instead the media is forced to cover the agenda. The media also tends to cover tabloid news items in a larger degree due to the demand and expectations of the users. There is also a risk, that individualization has a negative impact on the cohesiveness of society, due to hyper-segmentation of the users. These risks should be considered when developing and implementing the News Filter...|$|R
40|$|Living in {{a dynamic}} and mobile {{environment}} being 2 ̆ 2 always on 2 ̆ 2 and 2 ̆ 2 always connected 2 ̆ 2, surrounded by smart devices and intelligent sensors, makes {{the vision of}} 2 ̆ 2 ambient assisted living 2 ̆ 2 in everyday life appear desirable and feasible. WebServices and the Semantic Web provide the technical means to find and use virtually offered relevant every day services pursuing the vision of developing personalized service-roadmaps. With 2 ̆ 2 personal information environments 2 ̆ 2 (PIE) Isbell and Pierce {{bridge the gap between}} virtual and physical worlds. This dissertation proposes dynamic adaptive planning of <b>individualized</b> tours as <b>part</b> of a PIE, an augmented reality connected to the real world with the need to navigate therein. It shows itself as alternative for navigating through a vast variety of physical signs providing unfiltered information for everyone. Introducing Frankfurt Airport as one representative of the problem domain clarifies the multi-dimensional orientation problem in dynamic environments. This formally corresponds to solving instances of Trip-Planning-Problems as has been outlined by Godard. Thus the very subject of this work is adaptive tour planning, which yields optimal personalized configuration of services {{and at the same time}} a spatially optimized order of services - an optimal tour. One the one hand, the complexity of the problem results from the combination of configuration and tour planning. On the other hand, it is due to the task of continual replanning in dynamic environments. In the first main part of this dissertation a new planning method has been developed, that computes personalized tours under time constraints and optimizes tours for maximum use and with respect to spatial criteria like locality and proximity. A hierarchical method consistently expands minimal tours and traces down the task to navigation planning between areas and configuration planning inside areas. The method plans minimal consistent tours for mandatory stages instantiating plan schemata taking the user context into account and iteratively extends these tours by areas of maximum use. It is shown that the method reduces the exponential planning problem to computationally feasible parts. Further on, for these parts an optimal and exact solution for the Trip-Planning-Problem is provided. Correctness and the computational complexity of methods and algorithms are proved. Spatial prerequisites - the building and route model - are also provided as a service and user model. In the second main part of this dissertation a dynamic and adaptive planning method has been developed, which supports users executing their tour plans and intervenes as soon as the plan execution appears to fail or may be optimized because of improving preconditions. The method integrates adhoc appearing, probably more relevant services into an existing plan, detects increasing or decreasing time quota during execution and adapts a plan to altering preconditions. Proactive and reactive plan monitoring strategies are introduced that continuously control preconditions during execution and act in advance with local corrections in order to defer expensive replanning tasks. In case of a user rejects a local correction, it is shown how replanning can be reduced to the incremental planning method introduced in the first main part. Comparing the results of the planning and replanning method of this dissertation with the results of an exact method shows that the method of planning maximum areas yields near optimal solutions and better solutions as far as the spatial optimization criteria are concerned...|$|R
