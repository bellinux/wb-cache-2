When Itchy and Scratchy are cancelled, the kids of Springfield resort to {{playing in a}} wholesome manner. The montage was a satirical point by saying {{the opposite of what}} the writers believed. For the episode, which handles a large issue, the writers tried not to have a point of view and looked at both sides, <b>despite</b> <b>what</b> <b>the</b> writers personally felt. The episode [...] "Itchy & Scratchy Land" [...] was written as a response to new, more stringent censorship laws that had been put in place. As a result, the Fox network tried to stop the writers from including Itchy & Scratchy cartoons in episodes. In response, the writers created this episode, which they decided would be as violent as possible. The network threatened that if the episode was produced, they would cut the Itchy & Scratchy parts out themselves, but relented when showrunner David Mirkin threatened to tell the media. Mirkin further tried to put [...] "as much blood and guts" [...] into the episode [...] "Treehouse of Horror V" [...] as he could. He had received several complaints by the United States Congress about the amount of violence on the show and he did not like their attempt to censor it. The episode was later described as [...] "the most [...] disturbing Halloween show ever" [...] by Mirkin. The episode begins with Marge warning that the episode that is about to air has so much guts and violence that Congress will not let them show it. The three main segments are linked with Groundskeeper Willie being killed in all three of them. The first segment has Homer attempting to kill the rest of the family, the second segment has Homer killing anything and everything in the prehistoric past, and the final segment revolves around Springfield Elementary eating children.
