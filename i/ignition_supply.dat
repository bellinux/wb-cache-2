The engine's <b>ignition</b> air <b>supply</b> began in an air filter canister below the seat and was pulled through a large plenum chamber just above the transmission and behind the cylinder head then downward into the two internal passages leading to the carburetor housing feeding the carburetors. The A1 had two Mikuni carburetors located on the engine's left and right sides and inline with the crankshaft. The carburetors were enclosed and protected from the elements by carburetor covers fixed to the crankcase. Inboard of each carburetor, and supporting each carburetor, was the disc cover. The rotary disc valve was housed inboard of that cover. The A1 Samurai motor was lubricated by the Superlube system, with 2-stroke oil directly injected in the intake tract.Previously equipped with points, the ignition system was equipped in 1969 with a Capacitor discharge ignition including thyristor-based switching system then increased the voltage to between 25,000 and 30,000 volts reducing the unburned fuel mixture within the cylinders.|$|R

40|$|AbstractThis paper {{presents}} {{experimental studies}} {{carried out on}} a modern direct injection compression <b>ignition</b> engine <b>supplied</b> {{with a range of}} straight vegetable oils to investigate the effect of oil fatty acid composition on combustion and emissions. Seven oils, those of corn, groundnut, palm, rapeseed, soybean, sunflower and the micro-algae species Chlorella protothecoides were tested, with all of the fuels heated to 60 °C, at constant injection timing and constant ignition timing at a constant engine speed of 1200 rpm. All of the vegetable oils exhibited a duration of ignition delay within ± 0. 6 CAD of that displayed by a reference fossil diesel, but displayed much reduced rates of peak heat release rate. The duration of ignition delay was found to increase with an increasing carbon to hydrogen ratio of the vegetable oils, implicating the fatty acid alkyl chain as the primary driver of low temperature reactivity. Peak heat release rates decreased with decreasing vegetable oil viscosity, suggesting a significant degree of fuel cylinder wall and piston bowl impingement. At both injection timings, emissions of NOx were lower for all of the vegetable oils relative to the reference fossil diesel, while those of CO, THC and particulate matter were higher and sensitive to the injection timing...|$|R

At first, tests {{were carried out}} on brand new lube oil having a viscosity of 32 mm 2. s− 1 at 40 °C (ISO VG 32) and a flashpoint higher than 200 °C. Experiments were performed in a vertical semi-open tube with a 0. 07 m-square cross section connected to <b>ignition</b> systems <b>supplying</b> energies ranging from 1 mJ to 5 kJ. The average droplet diameter, determined using a laser diffraction sensor, ranged from 4 to 60 μm depending on operating parameters. In the case of brand new mineral oil mists, the probability of ignition by a spark discharge {{can be considered as}} low, the minimum ignition energy (MIE) being 2 kJ for 5 μm droplets. The minimum explosive concentration is fairly high, in the order of 250 g. m− 3. For mists with droplet diameters around 60 μm, MIE slightly increases to reach 2. 5 kJ. The flammability of oil mists generated in case of maloperation (accidental fuel/lube mixing) was also studied. The ignition properties of used lube oil were not notably modified with regard to the brand new oil. However, the addition of organic volatiles compounds leads to a modification of mists flammability, nevertheless it is only perceptible for fuel contents greater than 20 %v...|$|R

The effects of the addition of two inert gases (N- 2 and CO 2) are experimentally studied. The added volumetric quantities are between 0 % and 25 % for N- 2 and between 0 % and 15 % for CO 2. The thermal efficiency and the emissions of the engine are very slightly affected by the addition, whereas a significant increase of the knock limited spark timing (KLST) is always measured. A twice-higher augmentation of KLST is noted when CO 2 is added compared to N 2 for an equivalent volumetric concentration. The overall augmentation varies between + 1 and + 6 degreesCA depending on engine operation. Finally, a law for predicting the KLST augmentation implied by the addition of inert gases is deduced from all the measurements. (C) 2003 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved...|$|R

We {{investigate}} {{the use of}} antiprotons to promote fast ignition in an ICF capsule and seek high gains with only modest compression of the main fuel. Unlike standard fast ignition where the <b>ignition</b> energy is <b>supplied</b> by an energetic, short pulse laser, the energy here is supplied through the ionization energy deposited when antiprotons annihilate {{at the center of}} a compressed fuel capsule. In the first of two candidate fast ignition schemes, the antiproton package is delivered by a low energy external ion beam.

40|$|The Centurion – Halite {{experiment}} {{demonstrated the}} feasibility of igniting a deuterium – tritium micro-explosion with an energy of not {{more than a few}} megajoule, and the Mike test {{the feasibility of}} a pure deuterium explosion with an energy of more than 10 6 megajoule. In both cases the <b>ignition</b> energy was <b>supplied</b> by a fission bomb explosive. While an energy of a few megajoule, to be released in the time required of less than 10 - 9 sec, can be supplied by lasers and intense particle beams, this is not enough to ignite a pure deuterium explosion. Because the deuterium-tritium reaction depends on the availability of lithium, the non-fission ignition of a pure deuterium fusion reaction would be highly desirable. It is shown that this goal can conceivably be reached with a “super Marx generator”, where a large number of “ordinary” Marx generators charge (magnetically insulated) fast high voltage capacitors of a second stage Marx generator, called a “super Marx generator”, ultimately reaching gigavolt potentials with an energy output in excess of 100 megajoule. An intense 10 7 Ampere-GeV proton beam drawn from a “super Marx generator ” can ignite a deuterium thermonuclear detonation wave in a compressed deuterium cylinder, where the strong magnetic field of the proton beam entraps the charged fusion reaction products inside the cylinder. In solving the stand-off problem, the stiffness of a GeV proton beam permits to place the deuterium target at a comparatively large distance from the wall of a cavity confining the deuterium micro-explosion. ...|$|R
40|$|Emissions from {{residential}} combustion appliances vary significantly {{depending on}} the firing behaviours and combustion conditions, in addition to combustion technologies and fuel quality. Although wood pellet combustion in residential heating boilers is efficient, the combustion conditions during start-up and stop phases are not optimal and produce significantly high emissions such as carbon monoxide and hydrocarbon from incomplete combustion. The emissions from the start-up and stop phases of the pellet boilers are not fully {{taken into account in}} test methods for ecolabels which primarily focus on emissions during operation on full load and part load.  The objective of the thesis is to investigate the emission characteristics during realistic operation of residential wood pellet boilers in order to identify when the major part of the annual emissions occur. Emissions from four residential wood pellet boilers were measured and characterized for three operating phases (start-up, steady and stop). Emissions from realistic operation of combined solar and wood pellet heating systems was continuously measured to investigate the influence of start-up and stop phases on total annual emissions. Measured emission data from the pellet devices were used to build an emission model to predict the annual emission factors from the dynamic operation of the heating system using the simulation software TRNSYS.  Start-up emissions are found to vary with <b>ignition</b> type, <b>supply</b> of air and fuel, and time to complete the phase. Stop emissions are influenced by fan operation characteristics and the cleaning routine. Start-up and stop phases under realistic operation conditions contribute 80 – 95 % of annual carbon monoxide (CO) emission, 60 – 90 % total hydrocarbon (TOC), 10 – 20 % of nitrogen oxides (NO), and 30 – 40 % particles emissions. Annual emission factors from realistic operation of tested residential heating system with a top fed wood pelt boiler can be between 190 and 400 mg/MJ for the CO emissions, between 60 and 95 mg/MJ for the NO, between 6 and 25 mg/MJ for the TOC, between 30 and 116 mg/MJ for the particulate matter and between 2 x 1013 and 4 x 1013 /MJ for the number of particles. If the boiler has the cleaning sequence with compressed air such as in boiler B 2, annual CO emission factor can be up to 550 mg/MJ. Average CO, TOC and particles emissions under realistic annual condition were greater than the limits values of two eco labels. These results highlight the importance of start-up and stop phases in annual emission factors (especially CO and TOC). Since a large or dominating part of the annual emissions in real operation arise from the start-up and stop sequences, test methods required by the ecolabels should take these emissions into account. In this way it will encourage the boiler manufacturers to minimize annual emissions.  The annual emissions of residential pellet heating system can be reduced by optimizing the number of start-ups of the pellet boiler. It is possible to reduce up to 85 % of the number of start-ups by optimizing the system design and its controller such as switching of the boiler pump after it stops, using two temperature sensors for boiler ON/OFF control, optimizing of the positions of the connections to the storage tank, increasing the mixing valve temperature in the boiler circuit and decreasing the pump flow rate. For 85 % reduction of start-ups, 75 % of CO and TOC emission factors were reduced while 13 % increase in NO and 15 % increase in particle emissions was observed...|$|R
40|$|Research Doctorate - Doctor of Philosophy (PhD) An {{experimental}} and theoretical {{study of the}} flow, mixing and ignition inside the divergent quarl of high swirl double-concentric jets is presented. The study considered two jets with the ratios of primary to secondary diameter at the nozzle that were characteristic of burner geometries for pulverized bituminous and brown coals. A nineth scale isothermal model burner was constructed and extensive measurements taken of the velocity field and the boundary of the central recirculation zone, defined as the zero axial velocity line. The {{size and shape of}} the recirculation zone were determined for a range of primary and secondary swirl numbers and momentum flux rations. A secondary recirculation vortex was formed inside the divergent quarl when the primary flow was no swirled. Primary swirl (cocurrent with the secondary) removed the vortex, significantly increasing the recirculated mass flow {{and the size of the}} recirculation zone. A finite-difference mathematical model was then used to examine the stability of the secondary vortex under combustion conditions and investigate the behaviours of the recirculation zone for different nozzle geometries. Combustion was shown to have only a small influence on the secondary vortex and the recirculation zone. Mixing behaviour and turbulence characteristics were examined in detail for two flow configurations found for the brown coal burner geometry - one having a secondary vortex and one at lower swirl which did not. A heating technique was developed to simulate the constant temperature back flow within the recirculation zone during combustion. The mixing characteristics of the primary, secondary and recirculation species were determined by heating each stream and measuring the resulting temperature field. A mathematical diffusion model was then developed to calculate the turbulent eddy diffusivity distribution for the two flow configurations. A modified four-position hot wire anenometer technique was used to measure the Reynolds stress components. Calculation of the turbulent viscosity components indicated that in the two flows, turbulence was highly non-isotropic. Viscosity component μ zz was found to be dominant and components μZ zθ and μ θθ were of the same order of magnitude as μ zz at high swirl. Components μ rθ and μ rr were negligible in both flows. The turbulent Schmidt Number was found to vary from 0. 2 to 7. 0. A mathematical combustion model was also developed to predict coal heating and ignition behaviour inside the divergent quarl of an industrial brown coal swirl burner on which measurements were available. Isothermal turbulent diffusivity data was scaled to represent diffusion in the full size burner and to enable comparison of predicted gas temperature profiles and the location of ignition. Calculations showed that ignition was established inside the quarl and the residence time within the quarl was important in determining the extent of coal particle combustion. A weight loss of 53. 6 % occurred adjacent to the divergent quarl in the secondary vortex flow configuration (mean residence time 0. 112 secs.) compared to a weight loss of 32. 6 % (0. 064 secs.) without the vortex present. A mean turbulent eddy diffusivity was found to be adequate in predicting heating and <b>ignition</b> characteristics. Energy <b>supplied</b> by turbulent diffusion from the central recirculation zone was shown to be significant in determining gas and coal particle heating within and downstream of the divergent quarl. Combustion energy release was found to be of secondary importance. It is concluded however that ignition within the quarl is necessary to maintain the thermal stability of the recirculation zone...|$|R
