40|$|Most {{people think}} of using large-display installa-tions for highly {{technical}} visualization work such as scientific visualization of a large data set, process control, or technical design. In {{the past several years}} at Alias, we have investigated these types of applications, 1 for example, using large displays that let automotive stylists view and design on <b>full-size</b> <b>displays</b> of auto-mobile exteriors. 2 Recently, however, we have begun extending our work with large-display technology into the domain of corporate meeting facilities. At our cor-porate headquarters in Toronto, we have designed and built the Alias Visualization Studio (the VizStudio), a unique meeting facility that makes use of large display technology to support digital visual communication and collaboration with corporate clients, future cus-tomers, employees, and corporate partners (see Figur...|$|R

40|$|Tablet devices can <b>display</b> <b>full-size</b> QWERTY {{keyboards}} {{similar to}} the physical ones. Yet, the lack of tactile feedback and the inability to rest the fingers on the home keys result in a highly demanding and slow exploration task for blind users. We present SpatialTouch, an input system that leverages previous experience with physical QWERTY keyboards, by supporting two-handed interaction through multitouch exploration and spatial, simultaneous audio feedback. We conducted a user study, with 30 novice touchscreen participants entering text under one of two conditions: (1) SpatialTouch or (2) mainstream accessibility method Explore by Touch. We show that SpatialTouch enables blind users to leverage previous experience as they do a better use of home keys and perform more efficient exploration paths. Results suggest that although SpatialTouch {{did not result in}} faster input rates overall, it was indeed able to leverage previous QWERTY experience in contrast to Explore by Touch...|$|R
40|$|Abstract—The {{selective}} {{suppression of}} the polymerase chain reaction and methods based upon it (construction ofcDNA libraries from low amounts of biological material, subtractive hybridization and differential display of mRNA, fast cloning of full-size cDNA, chromosome walking, cloning in vitro, and others) are reviewed. These methods display a high effectiveness and, taken together, enable intricate DNA analyses to be performed—from the search for nontrivial sequences to the total sequencing of the corresponding genes.

40|$|The {{science of}} {{computer}} graphics and visualization is intertwined {{in many ways}} with Cognitive Sciences. On the one hand, computer graphics can lead to virtual environments {{in which a person}} is exposed to a virtual scenario. Typically, 3 D-capable display technology combined with tracking systems, which are capable of identifying where the person is located at, are deployed to achieve maximal immersion in that the persons point of view is recreated in the virtual scenario. As a result, an impressive experience is created such that that person is navigating the virtual scenario as if it was real. On the other hand, visualization techniques can be utilized to present the results from a cognitive science experiment to the user such that it provides easier access to the data. This could range from simple plots to more sophisiticated approaches, such as parallel coordinates. In addition, results from cognitive sciences can feed back into the visualization to make the visualization more user-friendly. For example, more intuitive input devices, such as cyber gloves which track the position of a users fingers, could be used to intuitively make selections or view modifications. The Appenzeller Visualization Laboratory is in a perfect position to enable research in all of these areas mentioned above. Sophisticated display systems are available which provide full immersion, ranging from single screens and head-mounted <b>displays</b> to <b>full-size</b> CAVE-type <b>displays.</b> This presentation will illustrate some examples for visualizations of data from the cognitive science realm and showcase display systems and some of their use cases...|$|R
