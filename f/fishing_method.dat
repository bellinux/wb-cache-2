25|$|Gillnetters – On {{inland waters}} and inshore, {{gillnets}} can be operated from open boats and canoes. In coastal waters, they are operated by small decked vessels which {{can have their}} wheelhouse either aft or forward. In coastal waters, gillnetting is often used as a second <b>fishing</b> <b>method</b> by trawlers or beam trawlers, depending on fishing seasons and targeted species. For offshore fishing, or fishing on the high seas, medium-sized vessels using drifting gillnets are called drifters, and the bridge is usually located aft. The nets are set and hauled by hand on small open boats. Larger boats use hydraulic or occasionally mechanical net haulers, or net drums. These vessels can be equipped with an echosounder, although locating fish is {{more a matter of}} the fishermen's personal knowledge of the fishing grounds rather than depending on special detection equipment.|$|E
40|$|Present {{study on}} <b>fishing</b> <b>methods</b> {{in the upper}} Ganga River system was {{conducted}} during the period 2010 - 2012. Upper Ganga river system consists of two major rivers basins viz. Alaknanda and Bhagirathi rivers and number of their 1 st and 2 nd order tributaries which flows through Garhwal region (Central Himalaya). This large network of fluvial water resources harbours rich Ichthyofaunal diversity. The varied potential of fish resources from these water bodies permits the utilization of wide array of <b>fishing</b> <b>methods.</b> Most of the <b>fishing</b> <b>methods</b> of the Garhwal region are primitive, based on indigenous traditional knowledge and well suited to turbulent nature of the streams. In present study eighteen <b>fishing</b> <b>methods</b> and gears have been documented from the upper Ganga River system. Study observed season, habitat and species specificity of the <b>fishing</b> <b>methods.</b> The utilization of crude and unscientific <b>fishing</b> <b>methods</b> is frequent in the streams of remote areas resulting into decline in fish resource. All the <b>fishing</b> <b>methods</b> employed in upper Ganga River system are classified into four types. The classification is based on their utilisation up to the level which will allow the sustainable harvesting and proper management of valuable fish resources...|$|R

2500|$|The {{traditional}} Japanese {{method of}} fly-fishing {{is known as}} [...] "Tenkara" [...] ( [...] , literally: [...] "from heaven").

Primarily a small-stream <b>fishing</b> <b>method</b> that was preferred for being highly efficient, where the long rod allowed the fisherman to place the fly where the fish would be.|$|E

[...] Fishing vessels classified {{according to the}} area in which they operate, can be divided into local fishing vessels, coastal fishing vessels and long-distance fishing vessels. [...] The local fleet is mainly composed of small traditional vessels (less than 5 GRT), comprising, in 2004, 87% of the total fishing fleet and accounting for 8% of the total tonnage. These vessels are usually equipped to use more than one <b>fishing</b> <b>method,</b> such as hooks, gill nets and traps, and constitute the so-called polyvalent segment of the fleet.|$|E
2500|$|The Aleutian Islands, {{a series}} of over 300 rocky islands, stretch over [...] from {{southwest}} Alaska to Russia. They are home to the largest fishing port in the U.S., Dutch Harbor. The primary target species is pollock, but crabs, salmon and groundfish are also important. Between 1997 and 2001, groundfish were caught by bottom trawling, a <b>fishing</b> <b>method</b> which destroys the habitat of the groundfish, the ocean floor coral and sponge communities. In 2005, about 80,000km2 (30,000 sq mi) of seafloor around the Aleutian Islands were permanently closed to destructive fishing gears. In 2008, NOAA fisheries created the Aleutian Islands Habitat Conservation Area (AIHCA), most of which is closed to bottom trawling. At 725,000km2 (280,000 sq mi), the AIHCA is the largest marine protected area in the USA.|$|E

2500|$|Tenkara rods are {{a type of}} fly rod {{used for}} tenkara fishing in Japan. A mixture of the rods in the other categories, they are carbon rods, fly rods and {{telescopic}} rods all in one. These are ultra-light and very portable telescopic rods (read more about telescopic below). Their extended length normally ranges from 11 to 13 feet, {{and they have a}} very soft action. The action of tenkara rods has been standardized as a ratio of [...] "how many parts are stiffer : how many tip parts bend more easily". The standard actions are 5:5, 6:4, 7:3, and 8:2, with 5:5 being a softer/slower rod, and 8:2 being a stiffer rod. Similar to western fly-rods tenkara rods also have cork, and sometimes even wooden handles, with wooden handles (such as red-pine, and phoenix-tree wood) being the more prized rods due to their increased sensitivity to fish bites and the heavier feel that helps balance the rods. Tenkara rods have no guides. Tenkara is a fixed-line <b>fishing</b> <b>method,</b> where no reel is used, but rather the line is tied directly to the tip of the rod. Like the carbon rods mentioned above this allows for [...] "very precise positioning of the fly of which the which in turn enables huge catches of fish with accurate feeding". One of the most common flies used in tenkara fishing is the Sakasa Kebari. Tenkara fishing is very popular in Japan, where these rods can be found in every major tackle shop. In the US, tenkara is beginning to grow in popularity.|$|E
2500|$|Trolling is a <b>fishing</b> <b>method</b> {{of casting}} the lure or bait {{to the side}} of, or behind, a moving boat, and letting {{the motion of the}} boat pull the bait through the water. In theory, for light and medium {{freshwater}} gamefishing, any casting or spinning rod (with the possible exception of ultralight rods) can be used for trolling. In the last 30 years, most manufacturers have developed a complete line of generally long, heavily built rods sold as [...] "Trolling Rods", and aimed generally at ocean anglers and Great Lakes salmon and steelhead fishermen. A rod effective for trolling should have relatively fast action, as a very [...] "whippy" [...] slow action rod is extremely frustrating to troll with, and a fast action (fairly stiff) rod is generally much easier to work with when fishing by this method. Perhaps the extreme in this philosophy was reached during the 1940s and early 1950s, when the now-defunct True Temper corporation – a maker of garden tools – marketed a line of trolling rods of 4.5 to 5ft length made of tempered steel which were square in cross section. They acted as excellent trolling rods, though the action was much too stiff for sportsmanlike playing of fish once hooked. As Great Lakes sportfishing in particular becomes more popular with each passing year, all rod manufacturers continue to expand their lines of dedicated [...] "trolling" [...] rods, though as noted, for most inland lake and stream fishing, a good casting or spinning rod is perfectly adequate for trolling.|$|E
