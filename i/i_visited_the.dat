5|$|Sandgate was {{completed}} by the autumn of 1540; Henry may {{have come to the}} castle when he was visiting Folkestone in May 1542. Elizabeth <b>I</b> <b>visited</b> <b>the</b> fortification in 1573, and also used it to imprison the courtier Thomas Keyes for a period, after he married Lady Mary Grey against the Queen's wishes. In 1593, the castle was reported to be equipped with seven artillery pieces - one culverin, two demi-culverins, three sakers and one minion - along with muskets, bows and arrows.|$|E
5|$|Originally {{separated}} by market gardens and fields, the two areas merged over the years, with the docks becoming {{an important part}} of the Elizabethan exploration. Queen Elizabeth <b>I</b> <b>visited</b> <b>the</b> royal dockyard on 4 April 1581 to knight the adventurer Francis Drake. As well as for exploration, Deptford was important for trade - the Honourable East India Company had a yard in Deptford from 1607 until late in the 17th century, later (1825) taken over by the General Steam Navigation Company. It was also connected with the slave trade, John Hawkins using it as a base for his operations, and Olaudah Equiano, the slave who became {{an important part of}} the abolition of the slave trade, was sold from one ship's captain to another in Deptford around 1760.|$|E
5|$|The {{invasion}} threat {{passed and}} in 1553 {{all of the}} blockhouses were ordered to return their guns; Milton and Higham were demolished. In the summer of 1588, however, there was a fresh threat of invasion by the Spanish Armada. An army was mobilised to protect {{the mouth of the}} estuary and emergency improvements to the fortifications at Tilbury Blockhouse were made by Rober Dudley, the Earl of Leicester. Queen Elizabeth <b>I</b> <b>visited</b> <b>the</b> fort by barge on 8 August 1588 and rode in procession to the nearby army camp, where she gave a speech to the assembled forces. Fears of invasion continued even after the defeat of the Armada, and {{over the course of the}} next year the Italian engineer, Federigo Giambelli, reinforced the blockhouse with probably two concentric earthwork ramparts, with ditches and a palisade. A boom was stretched across the river to Gravesend at a cost of £305.|$|E

Charles I was welcomed into Hull to inspect the fortifications and arsenal in 1639. In April 1642 the King returned to Hull to secure the arsenal at Hull, but was refused admittance at Beverley Gate by John Hotham.|$|E

In 1577 the explorer Martin Frobisher arrived in the city with two ships and samples of ore, which proved to be worthless. [...] He also brought, according to Latimer [...] "three savages, doubtless Esqiumaux, clothed in deerskins, {{but all of them}} died within a month of their arrival." ...|$|E

500|$|De Burgh finally {{fell out}} of favour with Henry III; he was imprisoned and then finally {{stripped}} of Hadleigh Castle in 1239. For {{the rest of the}} century, Hadleigh was retained as a royal castle, as part of an estate containing [...] of agricultural land, the park and the castle mill. By the 1250s, the castle had fallen into neglect and, despite some investment after it was given to Queen Eleanor in 1273, it remained in relatively poor condition. Only the mill, vital for the operation of the wider estate, appears to have been well-maintained. A new 17-metre-wide by 9-metre-long (56 foot by 30 foot) hall and an adjacent solar complex were built at the castle around 1290, but collapsed due to subsidence shortly afterwards. In 1299 the castle was given to Queen Margaret, who complained {{about the quality of the}} building and insisted that repairs were carried out. Her husband, Edward <b>I,</b> <b>visited</b> <b>the</b> castle twice, using it as a base for hunting in the area.|$|E
500|$|Warwick Castle {{had fallen}} into decay due to its age and neglect, and despite his remarks Dudley did not {{initiate}} any repairs to the castle. Queen Elizabeth <b>I</b> <b>visited</b> <b>the</b> castle in 1566 during {{a tour of the}} country, and again in 1572 for four nights. A timber building was erected in the castle for her to stay in, and Ambrose Dudley, 3rd Earl of Warwick, left the castle to the Queen during her visits. When Ambrose Dudley died in 1590 the title of Earl of Warwick became extinct for the second time. A survey from 1590 recorded that the castle was still in a state of disrepair, noting that lead had been stolen from the roofs of some of the castle's buildings, including the chapel. In 1601 Sir Fulke Greville remarked that [...] "the little stone building there was, mightily in decay... so as in very short time there will be nothing left but a name of Warwick". Greville was granted Warwick Castle by King James I in 1604.|$|E
