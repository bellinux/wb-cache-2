40|$|The article reviews recent {{developments}} in European Community (EC) agricultural markets and in the Common Agricultural Policy (CAP). In particular, the process of shaping CAP reform is extensively documented and commented on. It {{is seen as a}} means not so much to comply with national economic and external political requirements, but rather to continue agricultural protection for internal political reasons and to attempt to impose the Community's new position on the ongoing General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GA 11) negotiation of the Uruguay Round. With regard to the latter, attention is paid to the GATT questionnaire (<b>Dunkel</b> <b>paper)</b> and to the EC's response. Finally, new developments in the process of European integration (Single Market, EC enlargement, European Monetary Union) are summarised in view of some broad impacts on EC agriculture and food industries.

Here we argue that the Gibbs entropy fails to satisfy a basic requirement of thermodynamics, namely that when two bodies are in thermal equilibrium, they {{should be at the}} same temperature. The entropy definition due to Boltzmann does meet this test, and moreover in the thermodynamic limit can be shown to satisfy Dunkel and Hilbert's consistency criterion. Thus, far from being forbidden, negative temperatures are inevitable, in systems with bounded energy spectra.
