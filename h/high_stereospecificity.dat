The analysis is based upon extended Hückel calculations performed on the model iron complexes (η 5 -C 5 H 5) Fe(CO) (PPhH 2) R [R = CH 3, C 2 H 5, CH(CH 3) 2, C(CH 3) 3, Sn(CH 3) 3, and Ph] and rhenium complexes (η 5 -C 5 H 5) Re(NO) (PPhH 2) R [R = C 2 H 5, CH 2 Ph, and CH 2 (2, 6 -C 6 H 3 Me 2) ]. For R groups in 1 and 2 with a single Cα substituent (e. g., C 2 H 5 and CH 2 Ph), the most preferred conformation places the Cα substituent between the cyclopentadienyl and the CO(NO) ligands. For R groups in 1 and 2 with two Cα substituents [e. g., CH(CH 3) 2], the most stable conformation has the two substituents straddling the cyclopentadienyl ligand.

5000|$|The {{cationic}} 2-aza-Cope rearrangement {{is characterized}} by its <b>high</b> <b>stereospecificity,</b> which arises from its high preference for a chair transition state. In their exploration of this rearrangement's stereospecificity, Overman and coworkers used logic similar to the classic Doering and Roth experiments, which showed that the Cope rearrangement prefers a chair conformation. [...] By using the cationic 2-aza-Cope/Mannich reaction on pyrrolizidine precursors, they showed that pyrrolizidines with cis substituents from E-alkenes and trans substituents from Z-alkenes are heavily favored, results that are indicative of a chair transition state. If a boat transition state was operative, the opposite results would have been obtained (detailed in image below). [...] As is the trend with many reactions, conversion of the Z-enolate affords lower selectivity due to 1,3 diaxial steric interactions between the enolate and the ring, {{as well as the}} fact that substituents prefer quasi-equatorial positioning. This helps explain the higher temperatures required for Z-enolate conversion.Interestingly, the boat transition state is even less favored by the cationic-2-aza-Cope rearrangement than it is for the Cope rearrangement: in analogous situations to where the Cope rearrangement takes on a boat transition state, the aza-Cope rearrangement continues in the chair geometry. [...] These results are in accord with computational chemistry results, which further assert that the transition state is under kinetic control.Significantly, these stereochemical experiments imply that the cationic 2-aza-Cope rearrangement (as well as Mannich cyclization) occur faster than enol or iminium tautomerization. If they were not, no meaningful stereochemistry would have been observed, highlighting the facility of this fast reaction.|$|E

Macromolecular crowding {{refers to the}} presence of inert molecules in close proximity to other reacting molecules, and is often discussed in the context of biochemical reactions in the cytoplasm. This phenomenon has been proposed to cause alterations in the intrinsic kinetics and thermodynamics of chemical reactions, which has led to certain undefined caveats when relating biochemical characteristics observed in vitro to those seen in vivo. In this work, the effects of macromolecular crowding were studied by means of a computational, Monte Carlo simulation using Brownian Dynamics, where generalized chemical association and dissociation reaction kinetics of varying degrees of stereospecificity were modeled both in the absence and presence of crowding molecules of different sizes. It was found that crowded environments impose energetic contributions to reactant pairs through depletion forces, which bias their translational and rotational diffusion {{in such a way that}} overall net assembly is favored, with stronger effects on reactants with higher degrees of stereospecificity than for those with low stereospecificity. These favorable forces are insufficient to overcome the slowing of translational diffusion by crowders for low stereospecificity reactions, but more than compensate for the translational slowing for <b>high</b> <b>stereospecificity</b> reactions. In general, the effects observed in the simulation are relatively modest, with k on decreasing by 2 -fold for low stereospecificity reactions, and increasing by 3 -fold for <b>high</b> <b>stereospecificity</b> reactions. In addition, k off decreases by ~ 30 - 60 % in the presence of crowders (depending on the strength of the bond between the reactant pair), so that the equilibrium constant is increased by at most ~ 3. 5 -fold (ΔΔ G o = - 1. 3 k B T). The moderate effects of crowding predicted in this work through strictly geometric constraints suggest that any effects observed in vitro larger than those found here are due to other energetic effects, such as solvent reordering. More generally, the results suggest that reactions in the cytoplasm are fundamentally insensitive to the physical presence of crowders over a large range of volume fractions (0 - 0. 3) ...|$|E

A stereoselective intramolecular arylation within lithiated thiocarbamates has been developed allowing the construction of quaternary stereocentres next to sulfur.

Amyloid β (Aβ) -mediated dysregulation of ionic homeostasis is the prevailing underlying mechanism leading to synaptic degeneration and neuronal death. Aβ-dependent ionic dysregulation most likely occurs either directly via unregulated ionic transport through the membrane or indirectly via Aβ binding to cell membrane receptors and subsequent opening of existing ion channels or transporters. Receptor binding is expected to involve a <b>high</b> degree of <b>stereospecificity.</b> Here, we investigated whether an Aβ peptide enantiomer, whose entire sequence consists of D-amino acids, can form ion-conducting channels; these channels can directly mediate Aβ effects even in the absence of receptor−peptide interactions. Using complementary approaches of planar lipid bilayer (PLB) electrophysiological recordings and molecular dynamics (MD) simulations, we show that the D-Aβ isomer exhibits ion conductance behavior in the bilayer indistinguishable from that described earlier for the L-Aβ isomer. The D isomer forms channel-like pores with heterogeneous ionic conductance similar to the L-Aβ isomer channels, and the D-isomer channel conductance is blocked by Zn 2 +, a known blocker of L-Aβ isomer channels. MD simulations further verify formation of β-barrel-like Aβ channels with D- and L-isomers, illustrating that both D- and L-Aβ barrels can conduct cations. The calculated values of th...|$|R

Purified nitrate reductase, on the other hand, exhibits 'A' stereospecificity for NADH and NADPH. The apparent switch of stereospecificity from the 'B' to the 'A' side of NADPH, which occurs after purification of the enzyme, is partly {{explained by the fact}} that in crude extracts nitrate is reduced completely to ammonia.

Compared to the previous method using (R,S) -equol combination, cross-reactivity with R-equol was reduced from 65 to 13 %, and that with daidzein from 0. 31 % to 0. 08 %, markedly increased in the specificity. This study {{is expected to be}} applied for both simple clinical researches, and stereospecific immunoassays in which specific antibody preparation is difficult...|$|E
40|$|Graduation date: 2005 The epoxide {{deoxygenation}} {{reaction is}} formally {{the reverse of}} the epoxidation reaction. Compared to epoxidation, which has reached its full maturity, epoxide deoxygenation {{has not been as}} intensively developed. Among the few deoxygenation reagents, a handful are catalytic in a metal complex, show <b>high</b> <b>stereospecificity</b> and operate under mild conditions. A common feature of all present deoxygenation reagents is that they do not perform asymmetric deoxygenation of racemic epoxides. Rhenium (VII) trioxo complexes are emerging as pliable catalysts for epoxide deoxygenation. Designing a chiral rhenium (VII) trioxo complex was our goal. Guided by the mechanism of rhenium (VII) trioxo catalyzed epoxide deoxygenation and the mechanism of the stereogenic information transfer, we have designed and prepared a chiral rhenium(VII) trioxo complex. This complex is void of stereogenic centers and the source of asymmetry is the restricted rotation around a carbon-carbon bond. Detailed conformational analysis of the new chiral complex was done by extensive NMR measurements and molecular modeling. The rotation barrier for the diolate was experimentally and computationally estimated to be 9. 72 kcal/mol and 8. 06 kcal/mol, respectively. Unsuccessful attempts were made to prepare a camphor based scorpionate because of the extreme steric congestion. A menthone based scorpionate was successfully prepared. The related rhenium () trioxo complex with this scorpionate revealed contradicting chemical and spectroscopic features...|$|E
40|$|The {{transport}} of neutral amino acids in marine pseudomonad B- 16 (ATCC 19855) has been investigated. From patterns of competitive inhibition, mutant analysis, and kinetic data, two active transport systems with overlapping substrate specificities were distinguished and characterized. One system (DAG) served glycine, D-alanine, D-serine, and alpha-aminoisobutyric acid (AIB) and, {{to a lesser}} extent, L-alanine and possibly other related neutral D- and L-amino acids. The other system (LIV) showed <b>high</b> <b>stereospecificity</b> for neutral amino acids with the L configuration and served primarily to transport L-leucine, L-isoleucine, L-valine, and L-alanine. This system exhibited low affinity for alpha-aminoisobutyric acid. Neither system was able to recognize structural analogues with modified alpha-amino or alpha-carboxyl groups. The kinetic parameters for L-alanine transport by the DAG and LIV systems were determined with appropriate mutants defective in either system. For L-alanine, Kt values of 4. 6 X 10 (- 5) and 1. 9 X 10 (- 4) M and Vmax values of 6. 9 and 20. 8 nmol/min per mg of cell dry weight were obtained for transport via the DAG and LIV systems respectively. alpha-Aminoisobutyric acid transport heterogeneity was also resolved with the mutants, and Kt values of 2. 8 X 10 (- 5) and 1. 4 X 10 (- 3) M AIB were obtained for transport via the DAG and LIV systems, respectively. Both systems required Na+ for activity (0. 3 M Na+ optimal) and in this regard are distinguished from systems of similar substrate specificity reported in nonmarine bacteria...|$|E
40|$|Diacylglycerol (DG) and its {{analogue}} phorbol 12 -myristate 13 -acetate (PMA) {{activate the}} ubiquitous phospholipid/Ca 2 (+) -dependent protein kinase, protein kinase C (PKC), and {{cause it to}} become tightly associated with membranes. DG is produced transiently as it is rapidly metabolized by DG kinase (DGK) to phosphatidic acid. Phorbol esters such as PMA are not metabolized and induced a prolonged membrane association of PKC. Until recently, PKC was the only known phorbol ester receptor. We have shown that a novel brain-specific cDNA, neuronal chimaerin (NC), expressed in Escherichia coli, binds phorbol ester with <b>high</b> affinity, <b>stereospecificity</b> and a phospholipid requirement [Ahmed, Kozma, Monfries, Hall, Lim, Smith & Lim (1990) Biochem. J. 272, 767 - 773]. The proteins NC, PKC and DGK possess a cysteine-rich domain with the motif HX 11 / 12 CX 2 CXnCX 2 CX 4 HX 2 CX 6 / 7 C (where n varies between 12 and 14). The partial motif, CX 2 CX 13 CX 2 C, is present {{in a number of}} transcription factors including the steroid hormone receptors and the yeast protein, GAL 4, in which zinc plays a structural role of co-ordinating cysteine residues and is essential for DNA binding (protein-nucleic acid interactions). The cysteine-rich domain of NC and PKC is required for phospholipid-dependent phorbol is required for phospholipid-dependent phorbol ester binding, suggesting an involvement of this domain in protein-lipid interactions. We have expressed recombinant NC, PKC and DGK glutathione S-transferase and TrpE fusion proteins in E. coli to investigate the relationship between the cysteine-rich motif, HX 11 / 12 CX 2 CX 10 - 14 CX 2 CX 4 HX 2 CX 6 / 7 C, zinc and phorbol ester binding. The cysteine-rich domain of NC, PKC and DGK bound 65 Zn 2 + but only NC and PKC bound [3 H]phorbol 12, 13 -dibutyrate. When NC and PKC were subjected to treatments known to remove metal ions from GAL 4 and the human glucocorticoid receptor, phorbol ester binding was inhibited. These data provide evidence for the role of a zinc-dependent structure in phorbol ester binding...|$|R
30|$|The {{assertion}} that natural products represent a huge potential for drugs and drug leads cannot be disputed [12]. This is because nature uses exquisite enzyme reaction sequences, conducts many chemical transformations with <b>high</b> regio- and <b>stereospecificity,</b> {{leading to the}} formation of secondary metabolites [13]. These secondary metabolites (originally designed by plants for their own defence mechanism and survival) could be used directly as drugs or further chemically modified to give drug molecules. A quick search of the literature (the main stream natural products journals and PhD theses from university libraries in Northern Africa) could give an estimate of > 3000 unique compounds which have been previously isolated from Northern African flora, algae and fauna. Although the database of natural compounds from Northern African sources is still under construction, a recent survey has been undertaken by two of us to investigate the correlation that exists between the biological activities of the isolated metabolites from Northern African floral matter {{and the use of the}} respective plant species in local traditional medicine [14, 15]. The current review paper represents a continuation of this survey, with plants belonging to families having names beginning with letters T to Z (34 species and 11 families). As in the two previous reviews, the plant families have been presented in alphabetical order. Wherever the biological activities of the isolated metabolites correlate with the ethnobotanical uses of the plant species, these are highlighted in bold in the Tables.|$|R
40|$|Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is {{the most}} common type of senile {{dementia}} in aging populations. Amyloid β (Aβ) -mediated dysregulation of ionic homeostasis is the prevailing underlying mechanism leading to synaptic degeneration and neuronal death. Aβ-dependent ionic dysregulation most likely occurs either directly via unregulated ionic transport through the membrane or indirectly via Aβ binding to cell membrane receptors and subsequent opening of existing ion channels or transporters. Receptor binding is expected to involve a <b>high</b> degree of <b>stereospecificity.</b> Here, we investigated whether an Aβ peptide enantiomer, whose entire sequence consists of d-amino acids, can form ion-conducting channels; these channels can directly mediate Aβ effects even in the absence of receptor–peptide interactions. Using complementary approaches of planar lipid bilayer (PLB) electrophysiological recordings and molecular dynamics (MD) simulations, we show that the d-Aβ isomer exhibits ion conductance behavior in the bilayer indistinguishable from that described earlier for the l-Aβ isomer. The d isomer forms channel-like pores with heterogeneous ionic conductance similar to the l-Aβ isomer channels, and the d-isomer channel conductance is blocked by Zn 2 +, a known blocker of l-Aβ isomer channels. MD simulations further verify formation of β-barrel-like Aβ channels with d- and l-isomers, illustrating that both d- and l-Aβ barrels can conduct cations. The calculated values of the single-channel conductance are approximately in the range of the experimental values. These findings are in agreement with amyloids forming Ca 2 + leaking, unregulated channels in AD, and suggest that Aβ toxicity is mediated through a receptor-independent, nonstereoselective mechanism...|$|R
