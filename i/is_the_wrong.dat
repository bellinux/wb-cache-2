5|$|The series {{focuses on}} the adventures of the dark-haired Valérian, a spatio-temporal agent, and his redheaded female colleague, Laureline, as they travel the {{universe}} through space and time. Valérian is a classical hero, kind, strong and brave who follows the orders of his superiors even if he feels, deep down, that it <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>wrong</b> thing to do. On the other hand, his partner Laureline combines her superior intelligence, determination and independence with sex-appeal. Influenced by classic literary science fiction, the series mixes space opera with time travel plots. Christin's scripts are noted for their humour, complexity and strongly humanist and left-wing liberal political ideas while Mézières' art is characterized by its vivid depictions of the alien worlds and species Valérian and Laureline encounter on their adventures. The series is considered a landmark in European comics and pop culture, and influenced other media as well: traces of its concepts, storylines and designs {{can be found in}} science fiction films such as Star Wars and The Fifth Element.|$|E

Steven Page has acted as a conduit between the CMCC and the press, urging the government {{to focus on the}} Canadian cultural scene. Page has said the formation of the CMCC was in response to what he believes <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>wrong</b> direction taken by the RIAA and the major labels, by suing fans for filesharing.|$|E

25|$|Nielsen {{believes}} {{that the question of}} origin <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>wrong</b> one to ask and can produce misleading results. Because of the widespread migration of numerous ethnic groups like the Celts and Teutonic peoples and events like Roman expansion and subsequent Romanization, {{it is highly unlikely that}} only one ethnic group was responsible for the development of the Gundestrup cauldron. Instead, the make and art of the cauldron can be thought of as the product of a fusion of cultures, each inspiring and expanding upon one another. In the end, Nielsen concludes that, based on accelerator datings from beeswax found on the back of the plates, the vessel was created within the Roman Iron Age at a location somewhere in Central Europe.|$|E
25|$|Danforth and Hale summon Elizabeth {{and ask her}} {{to persuade}} John to confess. She is bitter towards Hale, both for doubting her earlier and for wanting John to give in and ruin his good name, but agrees to speak with her husband, if only to say goodbye. She and John have a lengthy discussion, during which she commends him for holding out and not confessing. John says he is refusing to confess not out of {{religious}} conviction but through contempt for his accusers and the court. The two finally reconcile, with Elizabeth forgiving John and saddened {{by the thought that}} he cannot forgive himself and see his own goodness. Knowing in his heart that it <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>wrong</b> thing for him to do, John agrees to falsely confess to engaging in witchcraft, deciding that he has no desire or right to be a martyr.|$|E
25|$|By March 2011, {{the market}} share of OS X in North America had {{increased}} to slightly over 14%. Whether {{the size of the}} Mac's market share and installed base is relevant, and to whom, is a hotly debated issue. Industry pundits have often called attention to the Mac's relatively small market share to predict Apple's impending doom, particularly in the early and mid-1990s when the company's future seemed bleakest. Others argue that market share <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>wrong</b> way to judge the Mac's success. Apple has positioned the Mac as a higher-end personal computer, and so it may be misleading to compare it to a budget PC. Because the overall market for personal computers has grown rapidly, the Mac's increasing sales numbers are effectively swamped by the industry's expanding sales volume as a whole. Apple's small market share, then, gives the impression that fewer people are using Macs than did ten years ago, when exactly the opposite is true. Soaring sales of the iPhone and iPad mean that the portion of Apple's profits represented by the Macintosh has declined in 2010, dropping to 24% from 46% two years earlier. Others try to de-emphasize market share, citing that it is rarely brought up in other industries. Regardless of the Mac's market share, Apple has remained profitable since Steve Jobs' return and the company's subsequent reorganization. Notably, a report published {{in the first quarter of}} 2008 found that Apple had a 14% market share in the personal computer market in the US, with 66% of all computers over $1,000. Market research indicates that Apple draws its customer base from a higher-income demographic than the mainstream personal computer market.|$|E

500|$|The {{character}} {{has also been}} described by Carter and Spotnitz as the [...] "voice of reason" [...] within the Syndicate, who [...] "believes that violence <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>wrong</b> way to protect the secret" [...] which they guard. The Well-Manicured Man's suicide scene in the series' film adaptation went through several conceptual iterations, with outcomes being considered including an imploding car or suicide by concussion grenade, although ultimately a car bomb scene was decided upon.|$|E
500|$|According to National Center for Atmospheric Research (NCAR) senior {{climatologist}} Kevin E. Trenberth, [...] "The {{answer to}} the oft-asked question of whether an event is caused by climate change is that it <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>wrong</b> question. All weather events are affected by climate change because {{the environment in which}} they occur is warmer and moister than it used to be." [...] He illustrates by pointing out that steroids in a baseball player's system do not cause home runs all by themselves but do make home runs more likely. Meteorologist Kerry Emanuel stressed that no individual weather event, such as Hurricane Sandy, can be attributed to climate change, or any specific cause, for that matter.|$|E
500|$|Since 2005, Romney {{described}} himself as [...] "pro-life". In that year, he wrote: [...] "I believe that abortion <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>wrong</b> choice except in cases of incest, rape, and {{to save the life}} of the mother." [...] During his 1994 campaign for the senate, Romney had said, [...] "I believe that abortion should be safe and legal in this country," [...] a stance he reiterated during his 2002 campaign for governor. While Romney would prefer to see passage of a constitutional amendment that would outlaw abortion, he did not believe the public would support such an amendment; as an alternative, he promised to nominate Supreme Court justices who would help overturn Roe v. Wade, allowing each state to decide on the legality of abortion.|$|E

500|$|While Joe is at college, Jennie {{remains at}} home, and her wealthy father, Ned Brinker, who disapproves of Joe for {{spending}} {{so many years}} in school before earning a living, encourages her to find other boyfriends. [...] Jennie does not bother to conceal these romances in her letters; Joe is finally fed up, and goes on a double date with Charlie and two girls. [...] Beulah, Joe's date, is initially enthusiastic about the budding romance ("So Far") but walks away in disgust when Joe, who is unable to keep thoughts of Jennie from his mind, falls asleep after a passionate kiss. Jennie breaks up with the boy that Joe was afraid would marry her, and she is waiting for Joe when he returns home ("You Are Never Away"). [...] Marjorie Taylor is convinced that Jennie <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>wrong</b> girl for Joe, and after a confrontation with Jennie when she tells her this, Marjorie dies of a heart attack. [...] Despite the disapproval of both families ("What a Lovely Day for a Wedding"), Joe and Jennie marry, a wedding observed by the unhappy ghosts of Marjorie and Grandma ("Wish Them Well").|$|E
500|$|The {{critical}} {{recognition and}} renown of Astral Weeks came to overshadow Morrison's subsequent work, {{as well as}} Morrison himself. According to biographer Johnny Rogan, his recording career was [...] "all too often crystallized in a single moment. Like the Beach Boys' Pet Sounds, Astral Weeks was perceived as a one-off whose critical standing allowed little discussion for other equally fascinating musical forays that followed." [...] Morrison felt annoyed by the retrospective acclaim and claims about the record's significance. In agreement with Logan's original criticism, he later said he should have [...] "changed the arrangements because the arrangements are too samey ... four or five other songs {{should have had a}} change of mood." [...] Merenstein, on the other hand, still admires the album: [...] "To this day it gives me pain to hear it. Pain <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>wrong</b> word—I'm so moved by it." [...] In 2001, the album was certified gold by the Recording Industry Association of America, having shipped 500,000 copies in the US. Music historian Andrew Ford said the album's commercial performance, much like its musical aesthetic, is similar to classical music: [...] "Neither instant nor evanescent: Astral Weeks will sell as many copies this year as it did in 1968 and has every year in between".|$|E
500|$|The triumvirate {{secured the}} New Theatre {{for their first}} season and {{recruited}} a company. Thorndike was joined by, among others, Harcourt Williams, Joyce Redman and Margaret Leighton. It was agreed to open with a repertory of four plays: Peer Gynt, Arms and the Man, Richard III and Uncle Vanya. Richardson's roles were Peer, Bluntschli, Richmond and Vanya; Olivier played the Button Moulder, Sergius, Richard and Astrov. [...] The first three productions met with acclaim from reviewers and audiences; Uncle Vanya had a mixed reception. The Times thought Olivier's Astrov [...] "a most distinguished portrait" [...] and Richardson's Vanya [...] "the perfect compound of absurdity and pathos". Agate, on the other hand, commented, [...] "'Floored for life, sir, and jolly miserable' is what Uncle Vanya takes three acts to say. And I just cannot believe in Mr Richardson wallowing in misery: his voice <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>wrong</b> colour." [...] In 1945 the company toured Germany, where they were seen by many thousands of Allied servicemen; they also appeared at the Comédie-Française theatre in Paris, the first foreign company to be given that honour. The critic Harold Hobson wrote that Richardson and Olivier quickly [...] "made the Old Vic the most famous theatre in the Anglo-Saxon world." ...|$|E

500|$|The game's trivia {{is based}} on general {{knowledge}} from several fields including science, history, and geography, combined with contemporary entertainment, celebrities, and other news items; the game, {{as well as the}} series, is often described as [...] "high culture meets pop culture". For example, one question asks the players to identify which Jennifer Aniston film title would most likely have been suited for a hypothetical romantic comedy penned by Albert Einstein about the interactions between neutrons and electrons, the answer being [...] "He's Just Not That Into You". In addition to the usual questions, each episode typically features a [...] "Dis or Dat" [...] question. This question gives the players seven words or phrases which they have to identify as one of two possible classifications, or in some cases, both. For example, one Dis or Dat series asks the players to identify terms that would be features of a Nexus One phone, Nexxus shampoo, or both. In offline play, only one player participates, while other players try to steal by getting it right if the main player gets it wrong. [...] In online play, all players play the Dis Or Dat simultaneously. Players are also urged to look for the [...] "Wrong Answer of the Game", which is hinted at by the show's sponsor; for example, in an episode sponsored by a baby crib company, the answer [...] "Cat's Cradle" [...] <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>Wrong</b> Answer of the Game. Choosing the correct Wrong Answer does not penalize the player but instead rewards them with a large monetary bonus. Other questions are presented in the standard multiple choice format but use recurring concepts, such as questions based on a fortune cookie message, or ones read through Cookie's ventriloquist dummy incorporating a speech impediment that may make the question harder to understand.|$|E
