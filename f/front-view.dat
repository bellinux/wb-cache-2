40|$|A {{high quality}} 3 D display {{requires}} a high amount of optical information throughput, which needs an appropriate mechanism to distribute information in space uniformly and efficiently. This study proposes a <b>front-viewing</b> system which {{is capable of}} managing the required amount of information efficiently from a high bandwidth source and projecting 3 D images with a decent size and a large viewing angle at video rate in full colour. It employs variable gratings to support a high bandwidth distribution. This concept is scalable and the system can be made compact in size. A horizontal parallax only (HPO) proof-of-concept system is demonstrated by projecting holographic images from a digital micro mirror device (DMD) through rotational tiled gratings before they are realised on a vertical diffuser for <b>front-viewing.</b> This work was supported by Huawei Innovation Research Program FLAGSHIP (HIRP FLAGSHIP) project at University of Cambridge...|$|R
40|$|Reading facial {{emotion is}} {{disrupted}} by both psychopathology, such as autism, and altered function of neurotransmitter, such as serotonin. These effects could result from reduced sensitivity of emotional processing systems to facial emotion. The impact of facial expression is also greater when personally directed than when averted. We therefore hypothesized that brain activity associated with emotional representation, {{would be more}} susceptible to manipulation of serotonin function by Acute Tryptophan Depletion (ATD) for <b>front-viewed</b> than side-viewed faces, measured using functional imaging (fMRI). ATD reduced activity independent of face view in left superior temporal sulcus (STS) and anterior cingulate. In temporal pole, medial frontal cortex and orbitofrontal cortex, ATD also reduced activity, but specifically for <b>front-viewed</b> faces. In right STS, ATD increased activity, but specifically for side-viewed faces. Activity in the amygdalae depended on face view and emotion type. We suggest that engagement of empathic and associative learning functions when viewing faces is facilitated by direct facial view and intact serotonin transmission. Averted faces, and reduced serotonin function facilitate attention to the external goal of gaze. These changes could be adaptive in a threatening context and markedly affect empathic function in conditions associated with impaired serotonin function, such as depression and autism...|$|R

A recently developed ultrathin transnasal videoendoscope (TNE) is minimally invasive even for critically ill patients and can be performed without conscious sedation. Transnasal endoscopic biliary drainage (TNE-BD) is performed using a <b>front-viewing</b> TNE with approximately 5 mm outer diameter and 2 mm working channel diameter. Finally, 5 F naso-biliary tube or plastic stent are placed. Technical success rates are approximately 100 % and 70 % for post-endoscopic sphincterotomy or placement of self-expandable metallic stent, and intact papilla, respectively. There are no serious complications. In conclusion, although further cases should be accumulated, TNE-BD and in particular, one-step naso-biliary drainage using TNE may be a useful and novel technique {{for the treatment of}} acute cholangitis...|$|R

40|$|BACKGROUND: Body size {{scales are}} a common method for {{diagnosing}} body image disturbances and assessing the cultural valorisation of stoutness, a phenomenon that {{plays a role in}} the development of overweight, especially among African populations. Traditionally, body size scales present a front view. In this study, we evaluated a complementary model of representing body shape: the side view of body outlines. In particular, we examined the association between the side-view and a set of bio-anthropometric indices in men and women. METHODS: To cover the inter-ethnic variability in the Niger-Congo area, we selected a balanced sex-ratio sample of 80 Cameroonians and 81 Senegalese. Individuals wearing close-fitting clothes were photographed from the front-and side-view, and measured following a bio-anthropometric protocol synthesizing body shape variation: Body Mass Index, percentage body fat, somatotype profile, waist circumference, waist-to-hip ratio, mean blood pressure and glycaemia. The shape of each front and side body outline was extracted and characterised by Normalized Elliptic Fourier Descriptors (NEFD). Finally, we assessed associations between NEFD and bio-anthropometric indices. RESULTS: Variation in the shape of both front and side body outlines was associated with all bio-anthropometrics for at least one sex-population combination. Overall, the side view best captured body shape variation related to changes in almost all bio-anthropometrics in both sexes and populations, with the exceptions of female mesomorphy, male blood pressure and glycaemia (in both sexes). We found that the details of the relationship between bio-anthropometrics and body shape differed between the two male populations, a finding that was reflected in side-views for all criteria, but not <b>front-views.</b> CONCLUSIONS: Variation in body shape assessed by several bio-anthropometrics related to health and nutritional status was larger for side than front body outlines. Integrating side views in body size scales would improve the accuracy of body size assessment and thus, the assessment of behaviours leading to overweight, as well as symptoms of body image disturbances, in Africa and potentially in other populations...|$|R

50|$|RPG Maker XP, also {{referred}} to as RMXP, is the first RPG Maker which can use Ruby, making it the most powerful, programming-wise. However, many normal, simplified features present in RM2k(3) have been removed. Most of these features, however, have been programmed with Ruby, and distributed online. RMXP runs at 1024x768 resolution (though games made in it run at 640x480), while offering four times the playable area of its predecessors. Additionally, it allows greater user control over sprite size (there is no specific image size regulation for sprite sheets) and other aspects of game design. This more open-ended arrangement, coupled with the inclusion of the Ruby Game Scripting System (RGSS), makes RPG Maker XP more versatile than older versions in the series, at the cost of a steeper learning curve. Upon the release of Windows Vista, many users experienced compatibility problems, although the fix was relatively simple..XP used a <b>front-view</b> non-sprite battle system that allowed for the use of Battle backgrounds (Battlebacks). Both characters and enemies had static battle sprites, and the interface was quite simple.|$|E
40|$|Evolutionary {{accounts}} of the centrality of social interaction for our species might anticipate more efficient affective processing for faces. The current study assessed whether mere exposure to upright faces resulted in greater generalization of liking than mere exposure to inverted faces, as might be predicted by special-process views of face perception. We presented upright and inverted photographs of faces taken from three different horizontal angles (full <b>front-view,</b> 45 -degree, and full-profile), then asked participants to rate their liking for <b>front-view</b> photographs of the same faces. For inverted faces, but not upright faces, {{there was a significant}} linear trend for liking to decrease as presentation angle increased (from <b>front-view</b> through 45 -degree to full-profile). Thus, upright <b>front-view</b> faces that had previously been presented in full-or semi-profile were liked at equivalent levels to upright <b>front-view</b> faces that had previously been presented in <b>front-view.</b> These findings suggest that mere exposure for upright faces presented at any angle may easily generalize to other views of the face, but that generalization is less efficient for perceptually matched inverted faces. These findings are consistent with evolutionary arguments for enhanced affective discrimination. ...|$|E

30|$|As an {{emerging}} problem, image-based automatic classification {{of the refrigerator}} is of great importance because it can potentially provide a valuable tool for industrial automation of refrigerator. There have been various machine-learning-based image classification methods proposed in industrial automation. However, {{none of them was}} designed for the automatic classification of the refrigerator, which mainly relies on humanâs visual system at present. The machine-learning-based classification methods can be roughly divided into two categories, including classifier combined with handcrafted features and automatically extracted features. With experiments, we respectively testify the support vector machine (SVM)-based methods [5 â 8] and CNN-based methods, in which the <b>front-view</b> image of the refrigerator is exploited due to the rich information captured by this image in recognizing and differentiating refrigerators. Experimental results show that the CNN-based methods outperform the state-of-the-art SVM-based methods with handcrafted features. Both SVM-based methods and CNN-based methods are effective in the classification of refrigerator <b>front-view</b> images. However, we observe fundamental challenges in the <b>front-view</b> image of the refrigerator, including the dense clutter, varying backgrounds, large homogeneous areas, sparse salient regions, and the specular reflection.|$|E

40|$|Abstract â We {{present a}} new method for <b>front-view</b> gait {{biometrics}} {{which uses a}} single non-calibrated camera and extracts unique signatures from descriptors of a silhouetteâs deformation. The proposed approach is particularly suitable for identification by gait in the real world, where the advantages of completely unobtrusiveness, remoteness and covertness of the biometric system preclude the availability of camera information and where the CCTV images usually present subjects from an upper <b>front-view.</b> Tests on three different gait databases with subjects walking towards the camera have been performed. The obtained results, with mean CCR of 96. 3 %, show that gait recognition of individuals observed the front can be achieved without any knowledge of camera parameters. Moreover, the method {{has been applied to}} three different walking directions and the results have been compared with the algorithms found in literature. The performance of the proposed system is particularly encouraging for its appliance in surveillance scenarios. I...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. Face {{recognition}} under varying pose is {{a challenging}} problem, especially when illumination variations are also present. Under Lambertian model, spherical harmonics representation {{has proved to}} be effective in modelling illumination variations for a given pose. In this paper, we extend the spherical harmonics representation to encode pose information. More specifically, we show that 2 D harmonic basis images at different poses are related by close-form linear combinations. This enables an analytic method for generating new basis images at a different pose which are typically required to handle illumination variations at that particular pose. Furthermore, the orthonormality of the linear combinations is utilized to propose an efficient method for robust face recognition where only one set of <b>front-view</b> basis images per subject is stored. In the method, we directly project a rotated testing image onto the space of <b>front-view</b> basis images after establishing the image correspondence. Very good recognition results have been demonstrated using this method. ...|$|E
40|$|Prosopagnosia {{has largely}} been {{regarded}} as an untreatable disorder. However, recent case studies using cognitive training have shown {{that it is possible}} to enhance face recognition abilities in individuals with developmental prosopagnosia. Our goal was to determine if this approach could be effective in a larger population of developmental prosopagnosics. We trained 24 develop-mental prosopagnosics using a 3 -week online face-training program targeting holistic face processing. Twelve subjects with developmental prosopagnosia were assessed before and after training, and the other 12 were assessed before and after a waiting period, they then performed the training, and were then assessed again. The assessments included measures of <b>front-view</b> face discrimination, face discrimination with view-point changes, measures of holistic face processing, and a 5 -day diary to quantify potential real-world improvements. Compared with the waiting period, developmental prosopagnosics showed moderate but significant overall training-related improvements on measures of <b>front-view</b> face discrimination. Those who reached the more difficult levels of training (âbetter â trainees) showed the strongest improvements in <b>front-view</b> face discrimination and showed significantly increased holistic face processing to the point of being similar to that of unimpaired control subjects. Despite challenges in characterizing developmental prosopagnosics â everyday face recognition and potential biases in self-report, results also showed modest but consistent self-reported diary improvements. In summary, we demonstrate that by using cognitive training that targets holistic processing, it is possible to enhance face perception across a group of developmental prosopagnosics and further suggest that those who improved the most on the training task received the greates...|$|E

30|$|In this paper, {{we present}} {{a useful tool for}} {{classifying}} refrigerator based on images taken from its front view, which is accomplished by using a novel CNN architecture adapted to the specialty of refrigerator images. Our approach is data driven and free from handcrafted image features. It leverages a training process to automatically extract multi-scale image features which combine both the local and global characteristics of the refrigerator <b>front-view</b> image. The mapping between the refrigerator and its corresponding category, which is learned from these features, offers a function to automatically specify the classification of a refrigerator given a new input image. The proposed CNN architecture takes triple images as input, from which a triplet loss (similarity loss) is produced. Meanwhile, the traditional convolution layer is modified into a doubly convolutional layer in our proposed CNN architecture. The details of triplet loss and the doubly convolutional layer will be fully discussed in Section 2. Our experimental results from 31, 247 refrigerator <b>front-view</b> images of 30 categories show that the proposed CNN architecture produces an impressive classification accuracy of 99.96 %, which is considerably better than conventional classification techniques.|$|E

The global features integrated with local features form a layout for each category of refrigerators. The whole layout is utilized to establish the mapping between the input <b>front-view</b> image of the refrigerator and the output classification label.|$|E

40|$|Profile face silhouettes have {{recently}} been used to generate a behaviorally validated face space. An important method for studying perceptual spaces is the elicitation of aftereffects, shifts in perceptual judgments that occur after prolonged exposure to stimuli that occupy one locus in the perceptual space. Here we show that face silhouettes elicit gender aftereffects (changes in gender judgments following exposure to gendered faces) in a rapid, implicit adaptation paradigm. Further, we observe that these aftereffects persist across image transformations that preserve the perception of a silhouette as a face but not across transformations that disrupt it. Moreover, the aftereffects transfer between two-tone, profile-view silhouettes and gray-scale, <b>front-view</b> face photographs.

40|$|Active {{contours}} are {{an attractive}} choice {{to extract the}} head boundary, for deployment within a face recognition or model-based coding scenario. However, conventional snake approaches can suffer difficulty in initialisation and parameterisation. A dual active contour configuration using dynamic programming has been developed to resolve these difficulties by using a global energy minimisation technique and a simplified parameterisation, to enable a global solution to be obtained. The merits of conventional gradient descent based snake (local) approaches, and search based (global) approaches are discussed. In application to find head and face boundaries in <b>front-view</b> face images, the new technique employing dynamic programming is deployed to extract the inner face boundary, along with a conventional normal-driven contour to extract the outer (head) boundary.

This task is considerably more challenging than general <b>front-view</b> road detection, as the associated challenges widely range from low picture quality, fisheye distortion and large objects, to the ab-sence of useful priors such as vanishing points and road struc-ture.
