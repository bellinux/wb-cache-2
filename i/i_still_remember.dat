Colin Jacobsson of DVD Movie Guide called the episode one of the better installments from Season 13, referring to it as [...] "very good" [...] and saying that [...] "the series has milked Homer's rage [...] for years, but it does so in creative and satisfying ways here." [...] R.L. Shaffer of IGN described [...] "I Am Furious (Yellow)", along with [...] "Brawl in the Family" [...] and [...] "Half-Decent Proposal", as being [...] "cleverly written" [...] and the best episodes of the season.

I know as a listener that our fans can connect to our music in the same way — even with the language barrier." [...] When asked why they almost always use Japanese instead of English, which would give them more broad international appeal, he said that [...] "We consider our music [...] a piece of art. [...] The language is part of that artwork." [...] The guitarist explained that Kyo, who writes all of the lyrics, prefers [...] "the sensitivities that Japanese language offers. There are expressions and nuances that can only be conveyed in Japanese; he values that." [...] However, he noted that likewise there are some expressions that are only able to be shown in English, and they will use it if they feel the need. The lyrics deal with subjects such as society and mass media, as well as sexual obsessions and love, usually with negative implications. The vocabulary varies from subtle to explicit (though the use of profanity has greatly decreased as the band matured, last featuring on Uroboros), and several songs rely heavily on double entendres and other wordplay, often involving the multiple meanings of a kanji character.|$|E
