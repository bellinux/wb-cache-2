60|$|<b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>fascinating</b> {{and horrible}} to Ursula. The curious, unliving {{light in the}} room changed her character. She thought it was the rainy morning. Then she looked up again, because of the horrid feeling of being shut in a rigid, {{inflexible}} air, away from all feeling of the ordinary day; and she noticed that the windows were of ribbed, suffused glass.|$|E
60|$|Mr. Twelvemough sat {{looking as}} modest {{as he could}} under the praise, {{and one of the}} ladies said that in a novel she had lately read there was a {{description}} of a surgical operation that made her feel {{as if she had been}} present at a clinic. Then the author said that he had read that passage, too, and found it extremely well done. <b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>fascinating,</b> but it was not art.|$|E
6000|$|A soft {{rain had}} begun to fall, hissing gently on the leaves, but he had still a boy's love of getting wet, and stayed where he was, on the stone. Some people saw fairies in woods and down in water, or said they did; that {{did not seem to}} him much fun. What was really {{interesting}} was noticing that each thing was different from every other thing, and what made it so; you must see that before you could draw or model decently. <b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>fascinating</b> to see your creatures coming out with shapes of their very own; they did that without your understanding how. But this vacation he was no good--couldn't draw or model a bit! ...|$|E

60|$|It {{was about}} time of sunset, warm {{and still in}} the canon, with rosy lights fading upon the peaks. The men were all busy with one thing and another. Strange it was to see that Gulden, who Joan thought might be a shirker, did twice the work of any man, {{especially}} the heavy work. He seemed to enjoy carrying a log that would have overweighted two ordinary men. He was so huge, so active, so powerful that <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>fascinating</b> to watch him. They built the camp-fire for the night uncomfortably near Joan's position; however, remembering how cold the air would become later, she made no objection. Twilight set in and the men, through for the day, gathered near the fire.|$|E
60|$|He stood, {{tall and}} strong, in the {{sunshine}} at the window, with his brown hand upon the shoulder of Summerlee. I was lying back in an armchair, an extinguished cigarette between my lips, {{in that sort of}} half-dazed state in which impressions become exceedingly distinct. It may have been a new phase of the poisoning, but the delirious promptings had all passed away and were succeeded by an exceedingly languid and, at the same time, perceptive state of mind. I was a spectator. It {{did not seem to be}} any personal concern of mine. But here were three strong men at a great crisis, and <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>fascinating</b> to observe them. Challenger bent his heavy brows and stroked his beard before he answered. One could see that he was very carefully weighing his words.|$|E
60|$|Tom was out late, that night, {{and came}} to bed through the window. He was in a {{tremendous}} state of excitement. It was hours before he got to sleep. All the village flocked to the court-house the next morning, for {{this was to be}} the great day. Both sexes were about equally represented in the packed audience. After a long wait the jury filed in and took their places; shortly afterward, Potter, pale and haggard, timid and hopeless, was brought in, with chains upon him, and seated where all the curious eyes could stare at him; no less conspicuous was Injun Joe, stolid as ever. There was another pause, and then the judge arrived and the sheriff proclaimed the opening of the court. The usual whisperings among the lawyers and gathering together of papers followed. These details and accompanying delays worked up an atmosphere of preparation that was as impressive as <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>fascinating.</b>|$|E

60|$|One evening, {{about nine}} o'clock, I {{returned}} to the stable to go to bed, and found a crap game in full blast. It had been a market day, and all the negroes had money. It would be well to explain {{the lay of the}} land. The livery stable faced on two streets. I entered the front, passed through the office, and came to the alley between two rows of stalls that ran the length of the building and opened out on the other street. Midway along this alley, beneath a gas-jet and between the rows of horses, were about forty negroes. I joined them as an onlooker. I was broke and couldn't play. A coon was making passes and not dragging down. He was riding his luck, and with each pass the total stake doubled. All kinds of money lay on the floor. <b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>fascinating.</b> With each pass, the chances increased tremendously against the coon making another pass. The excitement was intense. And just then there came a thundering smash on the big doors that opened on the back street.|$|E
60|$|Dare {{uncovered}} the drawings, and young Somerset's brain-work {{for the last}} six weeks lay under their eyes. To Dare, who was too cursory to trouble himself by entering into such details, it had very little meaning; but the design shone into Havill's head like a light into a dark place. It was original; and <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>fascinating.</b> Its originality lay partly in the circumstance that Somerset had not attempted to adapt an old building to the wants of the new civilization. He had placed his new erection beside it as a slightly attached structure, harmonizing with the old; heightening and beautifying, rather than subduing it. His work formed a palace, with a ruinous castle annexed as a curiosity. To Havill the conception had more charm than it could have to the most appreciative outsider; for when a mediocre and jealous mind that has been cudgelling itself over a problem capable of many solutions, lights on the solution of a rival, all possibilities in that kind seem to merge in the one beheld.|$|E
60|$|With night {{came the}} coyotes. The carcass {{of the deer}} {{attracted}} them, and they approached from all directions. At first <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>fascinating</b> to hear one howl far off in the forest, and then to notice {{the difference in the}} sound as he came nearer and nearer. The way they barked and snapped out there in the darkness was as wild a thing to hear as any boy could have wished for. It began to be a little too much for me. I kept up a bright fire, and, though not exactly afraid, I had a perch picked out in the nearest tree. Suddenly the coyotes became silent. Then a low, continuous growling, a snapping of twigs, and the unmistakable drag of a heavy body over the ground made my hair stand on end. Gripping my rifle, I listened. I heard the crunch of teeth on bones, then more sounds of something being dragged down the hollow. The coyotes began to bark again, but now far back in the forest.|$|E
60|$|There is one {{beautiful}} {{sight in}} the East End, and only one, and <b>it</b> <b>is</b> the children dancing in the street when the organ-grinder goes his round. <b>It</b> <b>is</b> <b>fascinating</b> to watch them, the new-born, the next generation, swaying and stepping, with pretty little mimicries and graceful inventions all their own, with muscles that move swiftly and easily, and bodies that leap airily, weaving rhythms never taught in dancing school.|$|R
30|$|<b>It</b> <b>is</b> <b>fascinating</b> {{that the}} {{beneficial}} effect {{of an active}} moderator was found even though we only analysed the participants’ root comments. The analysed participant comments were affected only by the moderator’s comments made previously in response to other participants, not by moderator responses to their own comments. Consequently, the effect of an active moderator is clearly {{not limited to the}} interaction between each individual participant and the moderator.|$|R

60|$|<b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>fascinating</b> sport always, {{whether the}} trout were rising or not. One had to fish with his ears, and keep {{most of his}} wits in his hand, ready to strike quick and hard when the moment came, {{after an hour of}} casting. Half the time you would not see your fish at all, but only hear the savage plunge as he swirled down with your fly. At other times, as you struck sharply at the plunge, your fly would come back to you, or tangle itself up in unseen snags; and far out, where the verge of the firelight rippled away into darkness, you would see a sharp wave-wedge {{shooting}} away, which told you that your trout was only a musquash. Swimming quietly by, he had seen you and your fire, and slapped his tail down hard on the water to make you jump. That is a way Musquash has in the night, so that he can make up his mind what queer thing {{you are and what you}} are doing.|$|E
6000|$|... “Yes, it {{was always}} this colour. And I used to leave bits of my frock on thorns here and there. It was pretty thin, I can tell you. There wasn’t much at that time between my skin and {{the blue of the}} sky. My legs were as sunburnt as my face; but really I didn’t tan very much. I had plenty of {{freckles}} though. There were no looking-glasses in the Presbytery but uncle had a piece not bigger than my two hands for his shaving. One Sunday I crept into his room and had a peep at myself. And wasn’t I startled to see my own eyes looking at me! But <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>fascinating,</b> too. I was about eleven years old then, and I was very friendly with the goats, and I was as shrill as a cicada and as slender as a match. Heavens! When I overhear myself speaking sometimes, or look at my limbs, it doesn’t seem to be possible. And yet it is the same one. I do remember every single goat. They were very clever. Goats are no trouble really; they don’t scatter much. Mine never did even if I had to hide myself out of their sight for ever so long.” ...|$|E
60|$|When we went downstairs, we were {{presented}} to Mr. Skimpole, who was standing before the fire telling Richard how fond he used to be, in his school-time, of football. He was a little bright creature with a rather large head, but a delicate face and a sweet voice, {{and there was a}} perfect charm in him. All he said was so free from effort and spontaneous and was said with such a captivating gaiety that <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>fascinating</b> to hear him talk. Being of a more slender figure than Mr. Jarndyce and having a richer complexion, with browner hair, he looked younger. Indeed, he had more the appearance in all respects of a damaged young man than a well-preserved elderly one. There was an easy negligence in his manner and even in his dress (his hair carelessly disposed, and his neckkerchief loose and flowing, as I have seen artists paint their own portraits) which I could not separate from the idea of a romantic youth who had undergone some unique process of depreciation. It struck me as being not at all like the manner or appearance {{of a man who had}} advanced in life by the usual road of years, cares, and experiences.|$|E

40|$|Teaching crisis {{management}} <b>is</b> both <b>fascinating</b> and frustrating. <b>It</b> <b>is</b> <b>fascinating</b> because crises, {{by their very}} nature, are spectacular, dramatic, and intense; immediately arouse the individual and collective imagination; and because everyone seeks explanations for what, at first glance, appears inexplicable. <b>It</b> <b>is</b> also <b>fascinating</b> because educators <b>are</b> exposed to a transdisciplinary and transborder field of studies with wide-ranging ramifications. Yet <b>it</b> <b>is</b> frustrat-ing because educators must often deconstruct the popular perception that crises are rare, improbable, and unpredictable phenomena, often leading individuals to feel powerless and fatalistic. <b>It</b> <b>is</b> also frustrating {{because of the lack}} of knowledge in the field itself, at three levels: conceptual/theoretical, practical, and reflective. This article highlights the teaching challenges in this rich and diversified field at each of these three levels and examines three teaching tools to address them: case studies, crisis simulations, and the reflexive journal.

60|$|There {{had been}} in the first place the {{exquisite}} old house itself, early Jacobean, supreme in every part: it was a provocation, an inspiration, a matchless canvas for the picture. Then there had been her husband's sympathy and generosity, his knowledge and love, their perfect accord and beautiful life together, twenty-six years of planning and seeking, a long, sunny harvest of taste and curiosity. Lastly, she never denied, there had been her personal gift, the genius, the passion, the patience of the collector--a patience, an almost infernal cunning, that had enabled her to do it all with a limited command of money. There wouldn't have been money enough for any one else, she said with pride, but there had been money enough for her. They had saved on lots of things in life, and there were lots of things they hadn't had, but they had had in every corner of Europe their swing among the Jews. <b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>fascinating</b> to poor Fleda, who hadn't a penny in the world nor anything nice at home, and whose only treasure was her subtle mind, to hear this genuine English lady, fresh and fair, young in the fifties, declare with gayety and conviction that she was herself the greatest Jew who had ever tracked a victim. Fleda, with her mother dead, hadn't so much even as a home, and her nearest chance of one was that there was some appearance her sister would become engaged to a curate whose eldest brother was supposed to have property and would perhaps allow him something. Her father paid some of her bills, but he didn't like her to live with him; and she had lately, in Paris, with several hundred other young women, spent a year in a studio, arming herself for the battle of life by a course with an impressionist painter. She was determined to work, but her impressions, or somebody's else, were as yet her only material. Mrs. Gereth had told her she liked her because she had an extraordinary flair; but under the circumstances a flair was a questionable boon: in the dry places in which she had mainly moved she could have borne a chronic catarrh. She was constantly summoned to Cadogan Place, and before the month was out was kept to stay, to pay a visit of which the end, it was agreed, should {{have nothing to do with}} the beginning. She had a sense, partly exultant and partly alarmed, of having quickly become necessary to her imperious friend, who indeed gave a reason quite sufficient for it in telling her there was nobody else who understood. From Mrs. Gereth there was in these days an immense deal to understand, though it might be freely summed up in the circumstance that she was wretched. She told Fleda that she couldn't completely know why till she should have seen the things at Poynton. Fleda could perfectly grasp this connection, which was exactly one of the matters that, in their inner mystery, were a blank to everybody else.|$|E
