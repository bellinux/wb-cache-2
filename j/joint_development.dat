5|$|Following the {{dissolution}} of the Soviet Union in the early 1990s, the programme became a <b>joint</b> <b>development</b> between Russia and Ukraine. The former compounded the issue of a reduced market with its intermittent commitment to the project. Repeated attempts to start production have been unsuccessful. Western European countries, including Germany, at one stage assessed the aircraft for procurement but later decided against it.|$|E
5|$|HP {{believed}} that it was no longer cost-effective for individual enterprise systems companies such as itself to develop proprietary microprocessors, so it partnered with Intel in 1994 to develop the IA-64 architecture, derived from EPIC. Intel was willing to undertake a very large development effort on IA-64 in the expectation that the resulting microprocessor would be used by the majority of enterprise systems manufacturers. HP and Intel initiated a large <b>joint</b> <b>development</b> effort with a goal of delivering the first product, Merced, in 1998.|$|E
5|$|Juniper is {{the third}} largest market-share holder overall for routers and {{switches}} used by ISPs. According to analyst firm Dell'Oro Group, it is the fourth largest for edge routers and second for core routers with 25% of the core market. It is also the second largest market share holder for firewall products with a 24.8% share of the firewall market. In data center security appliances, Juniper is the second-place market-share holder behind Cisco. In WLAN, where Juniper holds a <b>joint</b> <b>development</b> and marketing agreement with Aruba Networks, it holds a more marginal market share. Juniper provides technical support and services through the J-Care program.|$|E

5|$|In 1977, the UK Ministry of Defence {{issued a}} {{requirement}} for an anti-submarine warfare (ASW) helicopter to replace the Royal Navy's Westland Sea Kings, which were becoming inadequate {{in the face of}} advances in Soviet submarine technology. Westland Helicopters put together a proposal, designated WG.34, for a three-engined helicopter of similar dimensions to the Sea King; the WG.34 was to feature more autonomy and a greater range than its predecessor. At the same time, the Italian Navy (Marina Militare) was also considering the replacement of its fleet of Sea Kings, which had been built by the Italian company Agusta; Westland and Agusta soon began talks regarding the <b>joint</b> <b>development</b> of a successor helicopter.|$|E

5|$|In August 2012, and as {{a result}} of Europe's debt crisis that {{resulted}} in PSA Peugeot Citroën (PSA) Group slow sales, Mitsubishi Motors announced the suspension of its supply of the i-MiEV electric vehicle to PSA, although the period for supplying vehicles under their contract as part of original equipment manufacturer agreements has not yet ended. The suspension is part of the decision of several Japanese manufacturers to suspend their <b>joint</b> <b>development</b> projects and contracts with several European partners. By early August 2012, PSA had sold a total of 6,575 Peugeot iOns and Citroën C-Zeros since their launch in Europe in 2010, while Mitsubishi had assembled almost 11,000 electric cars destined to PSA, leaving the French carmaker with more than 4,400 electric cars in unsold inventory. PSA only sold 50% of the sales target set for 2011 and according to PSA the supply was only temporarily interrupted.|$|E
5|$|Lockheed Martin, Thales, STN Atlas, and Raytheon were {{approached}} to provide tenders {{to design and}} assemble a new combat system for the submarines, with all four submitting proposals during early 2000. In May 2000, after the Defence Science and Technology Organisation tested operational versions of the proposed combat software packages, the Lockheed and Thales tenders were eliminated, despite the Thales proposal being rated better than Raytheon's. After indepth testing of the remaining systems and observations of the systems in action, the German STN Atlas ISUS 90-55 aboard an Israeli Dolphin-class submarine and the American Raytheon CCS Mk2 aboard a USN Los Angeles-class submarine, {{it was decided that}} the STN Atlas system was the best for the class. However, political pressure from both the United States and Australia, questions about the security problems and possible leaks involved with a European combat system linked to American weapons, and desires to increase the political and military ties between Australia and the United States resulted in the cancellation of the tender program in July 2001 and the decision to enter a <b>joint</b> <b>development</b> program with the United States, with a formal agreement signed on 10 September 2001 at the Pentagon.|$|E

25|$|The {{overlapping}} claim area of {{the continental}} shelf was designated as a <b>joint</b> <b>development</b> area by the two countries where all fossil fuel resources in the area is shared between Malaysia and Vietnam.

In 1999, all three countries agreed in principle to jointly develop this area using <b>joint</b> <b>development</b> principles.|$|E
25|$|Metro's {{efforts to}} develop the land at the Anacostia station have been {{strongly}} criticized. When Metro began operations in 1976, the transit agency created the <b>Joint</b> <b>Development</b> Program cooperatively promote retail, office, and residential development on land owned by Metro, by state or local governments, or private owners in order to boost bus and rail ridership on the system, generate operating income for Metro, and help {{state and local governments}} see a return on their investment in Metro (through revenues or increases in tax assessments). By 2007, Metro had signed 56 <b>joint</b> <b>development</b> projects generating $129 million (over 30 years) in income. At least one study showed that Metro-sponsored developments significantly outperformed developments built solely by the private sector. Nonetheless, Metro was only generating a rather small $4.3 million a year from its <b>joint</b> <b>development</b> projects, and anecdotal evidence indicated that Metro had a very mixed history in actually bringing development online.|$|E
