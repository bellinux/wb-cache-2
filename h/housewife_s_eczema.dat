The article proposes a new explanation: that increases in knowledge on the causes and transmission mechanisms of infectious diseases persuaded women that household members health depended on the amount of housework carried out. The article traces the origin of this knowledge in the scientific developments of the nineteenth century and describes the mechanisms by which households were persuaded to allocate more time and resources to housework.

The bacteriocin lysostaphin is secreted by Staphylococcus simulans biovar staphylolyticus and {{directed against the}} cell walls of competing S. aureus. LytM is produced by S. aureus as a latent autolysin and can be activated in vitro by the removal of an N-terminal domain and occluding region. Results We compared the efficacies of the lysostaphin and LytM catalytic domains using a newly developed model of chronic <b>S.</b> aureus infected <b>eczema.</b> Lysostaphin was effective, like in other models. In contrast, LytM was not significantly better than control. The different treatment outcomes could be correlated with in vitro properties of the proteins, including proteolytic stability, affinity to cell wall components other than peptidoglycan, and sensitivity to the ionic milieu. Conclusions Although lysostaphin and LytM cleave the same peptide bond in the peptidoglycan, the two enzymes have very different environmental requirements what is reflected in their contrasting performance in mouse eczema model. </p...|$|R

40|$|This article {{investigates the}} {{relationship}} between the lived experiences of <b>housewives</b> in 1950 <b>s</b> and early 1960 s Britain and their portrayal in The Feminine Mystique and popular women’s magazines. Through a study of four housewives’ associations, the Women’s Institutes, Mothers’ Union, Townswomen’s Guilds and the National Council of Women, it is argued that they rejected the prevailing ideology of domesticity and challenged the myth of the ‘happy housewife’. As a result housewives’ associations presented a modern interpretation of domesticity where wives and mothers not only cared for their husbands and children but also made an important contribution to wider society. As equal citizens women were entitled to state support and housewives’ associations were successful in articulating the demands of women as wives, mothers and paid employees. In doing so housewives’ associations presented a much more nuanced account of women’s everyday lives illustrating that not all women succumbed to the feminine mystique...|$|R
40|$|English-born, American {{television}} celebrity chef Dione Lucas, toured Australia in 1956, 1958 and 1960, {{each time}} sponsored by The Australian Women’s Weekly (AWW), {{a magazine that}} at that time boasted weekly sales of 750, 000 copies. On the surface, Lucas’s 1956 Australian visit {{is in line with}} the magazine’s practice of bringing high profile international guests to Australia to promote the magazine and increase sales. But there was a more compelling reason for her to travel to Australia. With the launch of television just weeks away, and the knowledge that women controlled 90 per cent of household spending, her cooking demonstrations were closely linked to the promotion of the sale of television sets and television viewing. This article uses a culinary lens along with archival material, magazine and newspaper articles and personal stories to add Lucas’s cooking demonstrations, and Australian women, and their interest in cooking, to the history of the start of television in Australia. It thus challenges the static narratives, about both this event and the 1950 <b>s</b> <b>housewife,</b> embedded in our popular memory...|$|R

My aim is for Richard Yates to be acknowledged as an author who can offer great insights into both the political, socio- historical and literary landscape of the 1950 s, and particularly the struggles of restrictive gender roles within a suburban context.

AD is an inflammatory skin disease primarily in infants and children with a personal or family history of atopy, such as dermatitis, seasonal rhinitis, allergies, or asthma (Figure 1). 1 Disease severity improves with age in most patients. The prevalence in highly developed socioeconomic societies has been increasing from 2 % to 15 % of children since the 70 <b>s.</b> 1, 2 <b>Eczema,</b> the meaning derived from “boiling, ” is used by many people interchangeably with dermatitis, however, it should be restricted to acute vesicular dermatitis. What are the diagnostic criteria? Atopic dermatitis has been called “the itch that rashes. ” Pruritus is primordial and leads to scratching or rubbing, which in turn creates acute excoriations or chronic lichenifi-cation. Characteristically, the face and extensor surfaces of the extremities are affected in infancy, whereas the flexures become involved in older children and adults. In this article: 1.

Her first mental breakdown happened at age 36. My {{grandmother was}} an immigrant's daughter and WWII Japanese code breaker turned 1950 <b>s</b> <b>housewife.</b> She received her bachelor's and master's degree before settling down to raise five kids. One day {{she woke up}} hearing voices. She lived with these voices {{for the rest of}} her life, building physical and mental boundaries between herself and the world. In some ways, her life unraveled little by little. In other ways, she lived happily to 89 -years-old. I'm 28. As I trudge towards the age when my grandmother first heard voices, I grapple with the elaborate façade of normalcy she constructed to protect herself and her family.

40|$|Abstract: Background: Topical {{antimicrobial}} {{drugs are}} indicated for limited superficial pyodermitis treatment, {{although they are}} largely used as self-prescribed medication {{for a variety of}} inflammatory dermatoses, including atopic dermatitis. Monitoring bacterial susceptibility to these drugs is difficult, given the paucity of laboratory standardization. Objective: To evaluate the prevalence of Staphylococcus aureus topical antimicrobial drug resistance in atopic dermatitis patients. Methods: We conducted a cross-sectional study of children and adults diagnosed with atopic dermatitis and S. aureus colonization. We used miscellaneous literature reported breakpoints to define S. aureus resistance to mupirocin, fusidic acid, gentamicin, neomycin and bacitracin. Results: A total of 91 patients were included and 100 S. aureus isolates were analyzed. All strains were methicillin-susceptible S. aureus. We found a low prevalence of mupirocin and fusidic acid resistance (1. 1 % and 5. 9 %, respectively), but high levels of neomycin and bacitracin resistance (42. 6 % and 100 %, respectively). Fusidic acid resistance was associated with more severe atopic dermatitis, demonstrated by higher EASI scores (median 17. 8 vs 5. 7, p=. 009). Our results also corroborate the literature on the absence of cross-resistance between the aminoglycosides neomycin and gentamicin. Conclusions: Our data, in a southern Brazilian sample of AD patients, revealed a low prevalence of mupirocin and fusidic acid resistance of <b>S.</b> aureus atopic <b>eczema</b> colonizer strains. However, for neomycin and bacitracin, which are commonly used topical antimicrobial drugs in Brazil, high levels of resistance were identified. Further restrictions on the use of these antimicrobials seem necessary to keep resistance as low as possible...|$|R
40|$|In {{the past}} 8 years {{a new breed}} of ‘crafting’ books and {{magazines}} have flooded the market: extremely seductive tomes filled with pretty, ‘vintage’ styled imagery of beautiful interiors littered with pretty ‘fun’ but also pretty useless home crafted projects; Felted macaroons, knitted apple covers, crocheted beach huts…are all photographed in suitably ‘shabby chic’ aspirational homes. On the surface this proliferation of attractive imagery of the end result of domestic craft endeavours suggests a shift in status for hobby culture in mainstream culture. However is this really so? This paper positions these publications, through visual analysis, {{as a part of a}} resurgence if not an amplification of patriarchal, white middle class, conservative discourse simply sold in a seductive new package. Instead of empowering women through making they promote the return of the 1950 <b>s</b> <b>housewife</b> with time and money to waste as a new/old ideal of appropriate femininity. Further more it questions the purpose of these books and argues that they operate as a Marxist joke: the commodification of ‘production’ that encourages the visual consumption of making rather than actual making and that they culturally operate as white middle class female pornography- the fetishisation and objectification of labour from a detached scopophilic perspective. Instead of offering alternative careers and thus independence through making skills during a global financial crises of which, arguably women have directly or indirectly been the biggest victims, they offer an ideological plaster on a gaping wound...|$|R
40|$|An {{in depth}} {{analysis}} of Iris, The Hours and Far From HeavenIris is a 2001 biographical film {{that tells the}} story of British novelist Iris Murdoch and her relationship with John Bayley. [1] The film contrasts the start of their relationship, when Murdoch (Kate Winslet) was an outgoing, dominant individual as compared to her timid and scholarly partner Bayley (Hugh Bonneville), and their later life, when Murdoch (Judi Dench) was suffering from Alzheimer's disease and tended to by a frustrated Bayley (Jim Broadbent) in their North Oxford home in Charlbury Road. The Hours is a 2002 British-American drama film directed by Stephen Daldry, and starring Nicole Kidman, Meryl Streep, Julianne Moore, and Ed Harris. The screenplay by David Hare is based on Michael Cunningham's 1999 Pulitzer Prize-winning novel of the same title. The plot focuses on three women of different generations whose lives are interconnected by the novel Mrs Dalloway by Virginia Woolf. These are Clarissa Vaughan (Streep), a New Yorker preparing an award party for her AIDS-stricken long-time friend and poet, Richard (Harris) in 2001; Laura Brown (Moore), a pregnant 1950 <b>s</b> California <b>housewife</b> with a young boy and an unhappy marriage; and Virginia Woolf (Kidman) herself in 1920 s England, who is struggling with depression and mental illness while trying to write her novel. Far from Heaven is a 2002 American drama film written and directed by Todd Haynes and starring Julianne Moore, Dennis Quaid, Dennis Haysbert, and Patricia Clarkson. The film {{tells the story of}} Cathy Whitaker, a 1950 <b>s</b> <b>housewife,</b> living in wealthy suburban Connecticut as she sees her seemingly perfect life begin to fall apart. It is done in the style of a Douglas Sirk film (especially 1955 's All That Heaven Allows and 1959 's Imitation of Life), dealing with complex contemporary issues such as race, gender roles, sexual orientation and class.

40|$|In this paper/performance I {{will explore}} the double (through the {{appearance}} of the identical twin, the alter ego, the shadow self) as an unpredictable, wilful and creative strategy to disrupt hetero-normalist discourse. I will furthermore explore the late theatre activist Augusto Boal’s notion of the stage as rehearsal site in the light of constructing new forms of queer identity. Boal demonstrated that audience intervention on stage can construct new ways of acting in the everyday. Using this as a model, performing self and its double opens up the possibility for imagined in-between and non-static spaces where queer identities unfold in relation to the duet (live and the double) on stage and can be assembled and cast off at will. I am a live artist. I establish the double in Spank performed at National Review of Live Art 2008 {{in the form of a}} recorded newsreader, or as high femme alter ego, Mertle, in the participatory art project Eating Secret (Tate Modern 2009 : international feminist art and the archive show Once More With Feeling). These doubles and other selves explore queer sexualities through an interplay of private and public realms; the live and the represented; high heels and sex toys played with on stage versus the corporate and banal space of the newsroom; high femme Mertle and the shadow of the remembered 50 <b>s</b> <b>housewife.</b> In destabilising notions of fixed identity by bringing selves into continual dialogue, a space in-between forms in the mind of the viewer or participant (this has previously been identified as a space where queer art can be located; erupting by necessity from the ‘cracks and rips’ of dominant discourse (Emmanuel Cooper). If we apply Boal’s notion, it is here that we can start to rehearse new possibilities, new queer identities for the everyday...|$|R
40|$|Mum’s lit is {{a popular}} {{literary}} form aimed primarily at middle-class mothers in the 30 - 40 age-bracket. It is marketed as both an offshoot and sequel to mainstream single-girl orientated ‘chick-lit’ and resembles the latter in its use of pastel dustjackets and {{the implementation of a}} chatty and informal first person narrative style. However, as my paper will argue, while mainstream ‘chick-lit’ blended conventional notions of female desire and behaviour with the new educational and employment aspirations of young women, ‘mum’s lit both reflects and reinforces the much more restrictive code of female behaviour expected of mothers of young children in the contemporary socio-political climate of the US and UK. Mum’s lit writers – such as Alison Pearson (I Don’t Know How She Does it) India Knight (My Life on A Plate) Lucy Cavendish (Samantha Smythe’s Modern Home Journal) and Fiona Gibson (Mummy Said the F-word) are journalists who had already established a niche as opinion makers and authorities on domestically life prior to publishing their first ‘mum’s’ lit novel. Through the voice of the heroine-mother (a character who’s lifestyle, attitudes and even appearance, bear an uncanny resemblance to the public mother/opinion maker author) such novels endorse what feminist critics have described as the ‘new mommist’ ideology of 24 hour attachment and intensive parenting. Although ‘mum’s lit’ is promoted as supportive to mothers by critiquing the culture of maternal perfectionism, it clearly perpetuates binary notions of good and bad motherhood but supplants an older, now outdated mode of domestic perfectionism and rigid child management regimes (associated with the Bowlby’s ‘refrigerator’ mother – the frosty 1950 <b>s</b> <b>housewife)</b> with a new ideology that forgives a small amount of domestic tardiness if this occurs in the service of creating a child-centred culture of continually fun and creativity which is accompanied by dizzying levels of emotional engagement and empathy. The paper will argue that the ‘new mommist’/intensive parenting orthodoxy portrayed in these novels is thus as demanding as the post-war domestic ideology and is equally invested in biologically essentialist attitudes towards parenting and motherhood...|$|R
