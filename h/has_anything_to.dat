5|$|Japanese {{animation}} studio Group TAC produced Twin Spicas anime adaptation, {{which was}} broadcast by NHK. The 20-episode series premiered on November 1, 2003, and aired until its conclusion on March 27, 2004. Tomomi Mochizuki directed the anime series, and Rika Nakase wrote its screenplay. Masako Goto designed the characters for animation. When the series reached its conclusion, only 30 {{chapters of the}} manga had been published. Chapter 25, which concludes the story of Asumi and her classmates undergoing a test of their survival skills, was the final chapter to be adapted for the anime. Consequently, the series concludes prematurely with Asumi's ghost companion Lion-san leaving when he no longer <b>has</b> <b>anything</b> <b>to</b> teach her and her friends. The manga, however, continues with Lion-san appearing in subsequent chapters until his eventual departure in chapter 88. The anime series also aired {{in other parts of}} Asia on Animax. It was released in VHS and DVD formats by King Records in five compilation volumes each. A special DVD collection containing the five flashback episodes—episodes 1, 5, 9, 12, and 16—was released on May 26, 2004, and a five-disc DVD box set was released on July 22, 2004. A two-part novelization of the anime and an official guide book to the adaptation were published in April 2004. The English-language dubbing of the Twin Spica anime premiered on Animax Asia on January 24, 2005.|$|E

25|$|In game theory, the Nash equilibrium, {{named after}} American {{mathematician}} John Forbes Nash Jr., {{is a solution}} concept of a non-cooperative game involving two or more players in which each player is assumed to know the equilibrium strategies of the other players, and no player <b>has</b> <b>anything</b> <b>to</b> gain by changing only his own strategy. If each player has chosen a strategy and no player can benefit by changing strategies while the other players keep theirs unchanged, then the current set of strategy choices and the corresponding payoffs constitutes a Nash equilibrium. The Nash equilibrium {{is one of the}} foundational concepts in game theory. The reality of the Nash equilibrium of a game can be tested using experimental economics methods.|$|E

500|$|Jonathan Miller asks: [...] "What {{are we to}} make of the blurred {{features}} of the royal couple? It is unlikely that it <b>has</b> <b>anything</b> <b>to</b> do with the optical imperfection of the mirror, which would, in reality, have displayed a focused image of the King and Queen". He notes that [...] "in addition to the represented mirror, he teasingly implies an unrepresented one, without which it is difficult to imagine how he could have shown himself painting the picture we now see".|$|E
500|$|Another {{example that}} {{mentions}} Ælfgar shows {{a different kind}} of unreliability in the Chronicle: that of omission. Ælfgar was Earl of Mercia by 1058, and in that year was exiled again. This time only [...] <b>has</b> <b>anything</b> <b>to</b> say: [...] "Here Earl Ælfgar was expelled, but he soon came back again, with violence, through the help of Gruffydd. And here came a raiding ship-army from Norway; it is tedious to tell how it all happened." [...] In this case other sources exist to clarify the picture: a major Norwegian attempt was made on England, but [...] says nothing at all, and [...] scarcely mentions it. It has sometimes been argued that when the Chronicle is silent, other sources that report major events must be mistaken, but this example demonstrates that the Chronicle does omit important events.|$|E
500|$|A {{day before}} Pinkerton {{was to be}} {{released}} on September 24, 1996, a restraining order was obtained against the band and Geffen by Encino, California-based security firm Pinkerton's Inc. The company sued Weezer and Geffen for alleged federal trademark infringement, claiming {{they were trying to}} capitalize on the company's reputation. Under the terms of the restraining order, which had Pinkerton's Inc seeking two million dollars in damages, Weezer would be kept from [...] "selling, distributing, or advertising an album with the name Pinkerton." [...] Geffen spokesman Dennis Dennehy defended the title, arguing that [...] "to Weezer, Pinkerton is a character in Puccini's opera Madama Butterfly...It was not meant to be aimed at any sort of corporate entity." [...] Cuomo wrote a six-page paper defending his choice of the title, explaining [...] "why I chose it, and how it works for the album, and how it's essential." [...] The case was thrown out of court after the judge determined that [...] "the hardship of not issuing the Pinkerton disc would be greater for Geffen than any hardship Pinkerton's Inc or its shareholders might incur from consumers who mistakenly presume the company <b>has</b> <b>anything</b> <b>to</b> do with the album." ...|$|E

500|$|Hochuli's {{presence}} {{on the football field}} has created a cult following. His rise in popularity {{is believed to have been}} started by Phil Simms, a former NFL quarterback and current color commentator for the NFL on CBS, who made reference to the size of Hochuli's arms during a telecast. [...] On the Internet, websites that sell Hochuli merchandise as well as blogs with his namesake exist. He is often affectionately referred to as [...] "Hochules", a portmanteau of his last name and [...] "Hercules", in homage to his large biceps. While he is aware of his celebrity status, Hochuli does not understand it. He said in a USA Today interview, [...] "I get a kick out of the notoriety, because I'm just a referee. I'm not the players. The players are the game. They're what this is all about. I get notoriety because I explain things, and I get notoriety because I have a decent physique, which is funny because I'm a shrimp, a peewee compared to those players. Neither one of those things <b>has</b> <b>anything</b> <b>to</b> do with whether I'm a good referee." [...] His recognition extends to the streets, in airports, and in the courtroom. He has been approached by notable athletes such as former National Basketball Association (NBA) player Charles Barkley at the airport. [...] "It never ceases to amaze me," [...] Hochuli told the Arizona Daily Star. [...] "The number of people that will just come up to me and recognize me." [...] He appreciates the attention, saying, [...] "I enjoy the fact that there are people who like me as a referee. I hear from a lot of people and I enjoy that. Like anybody, I like praise. Probably because of my personality, I thrive on that more than other people." ...|$|E

2500|$|Fearnley-Sander (1986) went {{one step}} further, {{defining}} Leibniz's characteristica {{as a combination}} of the algebra of logic (which Fearnley-Sander defined as the calculus ratiocinator) and the algebra of geometry (defined as the characteristica geometrica). Fearnley-Sander suggested that this combination had [...] "come to pass" [...] with the rise of universal algebra.

2500|$|Asghar Bukhari of the UK Muslim Public Affairs Committee {{said that}} both the British Government and the Muslim {{community}} were at fault in dealing with [...] "extremism". He criticised the British Government for being involved in wars in Iraq and Afghanistan while [...] "completely denying that it <b>has</b> <b>anything</b> <b>to</b> do with the political situation around the Muslim world", and said that Muslim organisations [...] "have failed their own community by not teaching these young, angry men {{how to get a}} democratic change to this policy that's ruining so many lives". He described Muslim leaders as unwilling to bring about change, focussing on points of theology, rather than the practical education of young people in ways to achieve political change.|$|E
2500|$|But some {{scholars}} {{do not believe}} Āryabhaṭa's sine table <b>has</b> <b>anything</b> <b>to</b> do with Hipparchus's chord table which does not exist today. Some scholars {{do not agree with}} this hypothesis that Hipparchus constructed a chord table. Bo C. Klintberg states [...] "With mathematical reconstructions and philosophical arguments I show that Toomer's 1973 paper never contained any conclusive evidence for his claims that Hipparchus had a 3438'-based chord table, and that the Indians used that table to compute their sine tables. Recalculating Toomer's reconstructions with a 3600' radius [...] i.e. the radius of the chord table in Ptolemy's Almagest, expressed in 'minutes' instead of 'degrees' [...] generates Hipparchan-like ratios similar to those produced by a 3438' radius. It is therefore possible that the radius of Hipparchus's chord table was 3600', and that the Indians independently constructed their 3438'-based sine table." ...|$|E

2500|$|Also in November 1943, Lecca conceded {{control over}} 15% of Jewish tax revenues. That money was {{returned}} to the CE, to be sent as humanitarian aid to the Jewish deportees and labor conscripts. Also then, allegedly with Killinger's consent, Lecca managed to obtain the reassignment of Gustav Richter from his post in Jewish affairs to more regular police work, proposing that: [...] "Richter no longer <b>has</b> <b>anything</b> <b>to</b> direct within the Central Jewish Office." [...] Although aware that Richter's network of spies was still at work within Jewish affairs departments, Lecca believed that Richter had since lost his motive for murder: [...] "He was a young man, he had a wife and child, {{and he knew that}} if he lost his position in the legation [...] he would have to leave straight for the front." [...] However, both Lecca and SSI director Eugen Cristescu recalled that, in his new capacity, Richter obtained the January 1944 arrest of several Zionist leaders (Filderman, Benvenisti etc.), whom he denounced as conspirators against Germany; all were freed the next month, when the International Red Cross pleaded in their favor.|$|E
2500|$|Ibrahimović {{was born}} to a Bosnian Muslim father, Šefik Ibrahimović, and a Croatian Catholic mother, Jurka Gravić; his parents were {{immigrants}} to Sweden from the Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia, and {{met for the first}} time in Sweden. Ibrahimović's parents divorced when he was a child, and although his upbringing was divided between them, he spent more time with his father: 'I had time with my mother but I really lived with my father.' He has said in an 2012 interview with PSG that: [...] "My father is Muslim, my mother is Catholic, but none of that <b>has</b> <b>anything</b> <b>to</b> do with football.

2500|$|Slash's {{friendship}} with GunsN'Roses frontman Axl Rose soured following his {{departure from the}} band. In 2006, Rose claimed that Slash had shown up at his house uninvited the previous year to offer a truce. He alleged that Slash had insulted his Velvet Revolver bandmates, telling Rose that he considered Scott Weiland [...] "a fraud" [...] and Duff McKagan [...] "spineless", and that he [...] "hated" [...] Matt Sorum. Slash denied the accusations. In his 2007 autobiography he admitted to visiting Rose's home with the intention to settle a longstanding legal dispute and make peace with his former bandmate. He claims, however, {{that he did not}} speak with Rose and instead merely left a note. Slash maintains that he had not spoken with Rose in person since 1996. In 2009, in response to a statement by Rose in which he referred to Slash as [...] "a cancer", Slash commented: [...] "It doesn't really affect me at all... It's been a long time.
