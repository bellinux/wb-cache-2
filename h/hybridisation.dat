5|$|<b>Hybridisation</b> {{between the}} Eurasian tree sparrow {{and the house}} sparrow has been {{recorded}} {{in many parts of}} the world with male hybrids tending to resemble the Eurasian tree sparrow while females have more similarities with the house sparrow. A breeding population in the Eastern Ghats of India, said to be introduced, may also hybridise with house sparrows. On at least one occasion a mixed pair has resulted in fertile young.

40|$|Rare <b>hybridisations</b> between deeply {{divergent}} {{animal species}} have been reported for decades {{in a wide range}} of taxa, but have often remained unexplained, mainly considered chance events and reported as anecdotal. Here, we combine field observations with long-term data concerning natural <b>hybridisations,</b> climate, land-use, and field-validated species distribution models for two deeply divergent and naturally sympatric toad species in Europe (Bufo bufo and Bufotes viridis species groups). We show that climate warming and seasonal extreme temperatures are conspiring to set the scene for these maladaptive <b>hybridisations,</b> by differentially affecting life-history traits of both species. Our results identify and provide evidence of an ultimate cause for such events, and reveal that the potential influence of climate change on interspecific <b>hybridisations</b> goes far beyond closely related species. Furthermore, climate projections suggest that the chances for these events will steadily increase in the near future...|$|R

5|$|Banksia robur and B.oblongifolia hybrids {{have been}} {{recorded}} at several locations along the eastern coastline. Field workers for The Banksia Atlas recorded 20 populations between Wollongong and Pialba in central Queensland. Locales include Calga north of Sydney, Ku-ring-gai Chase National Park, and Cordeaux Dam near Wollongong. A study of an area of extensive hybridization between the two near Darkes Forest on the Woronora Plateau south of Sydney revealed extensive <b>hybridisation</b> in mixed species stands but almost none in pure stands of either species there. Genetic analysis showed generations of crossing and complex ancestry. Morphology generally correlated with genetic profile, but occasionally plants that resembled one parent had some degree of genetic <b>hybridisation.</b> Furthermore, {{there were a few}} plants with morphology suggestive of a third species, B.paludosa, in their parentage, and requiring further investigation. A possible hybrid between B.oblongifolia and B.integrifolia was recorded near Caloundra by Banksia Atlas volunteers.|$|E
5|$|In 1889, Wallace {{wrote the}} book Darwinism, which {{explained}} and defended natural selection. In it, he proposed the hypothesis that natural selection could drive the reproductive isolation of two varieties by encouraging the development of barriers against <b>hybridisation.</b> Thus it might {{contribute to the development}} of new species. He suggested the following scenario. When two populations of a species had diverged beyond a certain point, each adapted to particular conditions, hybrid offspring would be less well-adapted than either parent form and, at that point, natural selection will tend to eliminate the hybrids. Furthermore, under such conditions, natural selection would favour the development of barriers to <b>hybridisation,</b> as individuals that avoided hybrid matings would tend to have more fit offspring, and thus contribute to the reproductive isolation of the two incipient species. This idea came to be known as the Wallace effect, later referred to as reinforcement. Wallace had suggested to Darwin that natural selection could play a role in preventing <b>hybridisation</b> in private correspondence as early as 1868, but had not worked it out to this level of detail. It continues to be a topic of research in evolutionary biology today, with both computer simulation and empirical results supporting its validity.|$|E

40|$|Seedlessness {{is one of}} {{the most}} {{important}} characteristics for mandarins for the fresh-fruit market, and mandarin triploid hybrids have this trait. Triploid citrus plants can be recovered by 4 x× 2 x <b>hybridisations</b> using non-apomictic genotypes as female parents. In this study, we characterise the type of seeds obtained in 4 x× 2 x <b>hybridisations</b> and the ploidy level of plants recovered from each type of seed. The majority of the plants recover were triploid (98. 3 %), but a few diploid, tetraploid and pentaploid plants were also produced and their genetic origin was analysed by simple sequence repeat (SSR) markers. We also analysed the influence of parents and environmental conditions on the efficiency of recovery triploid hybrids. In this work, we present an effective methodology to recover triploid hybrids from 4 x× 2 x <b>hybridisations</b> based on in vitro embryo rescue and determination of ploidy level by flow cytometry that allow us to recover more than 4, 400 triploid hybrids from more than 60 parental combinations.

50|$|Distribution {{of these}} phenotypes don't reflect exactly typical matting patterns. Mitochondria {{along with the}} mtDNA are {{inherited}} exclusively from the female. Since the primary <b>hybridisations</b> producing P. kl. esculentus occur between P. ridibundus females (large) and P. lessonae males (small) and later are maintained through backcrosses P. kl. esculentus females with P. lessonae males (L-E system), the expected mtDNA phenotype of P. kl. esculentus would be the phenotype of P. ridibundus. This unexpected phenotype distribution might be explained {{in such a way}} that most of P. kl. esculentus lineages might go through at least one backcross between P. kl. esculentus male with P. lessonae female. And such phenotype pattern suggests, that primary <b>hybridisations</b> are rare.|$|R
40|$|Real world search problems, characterised by nonlinearity, {{noise and}} multidimensionality, are often best solved by hybrid algorithms. Techniques embodying {{different}} necessary features are triggered at specific iterations, {{in response to}} {{the current state of the}} problem space. In the existing literature, this alternation is managed either statically (through pre-programmed policies) or dynamically, at the cost of high coupling with algorithm inner representation. We extract two design patterns for hybrid metaheuristic search algorithms, the All-Seeing Eye and the Commentator patterns, which we argue should be replaced by the more flexible and loosely coupled Simple Black Box (Two-B) and Utility-based Black Box (Three-B) patterns that we propose here. We recommend the Two-B pattern for purely fitness based <b>hybridisations</b> and the Three-B pattern for more generic search quality evaluation based <b>hybridisations...</b>|$|R

40|$|Adventitious embryony from nucellar {{cells is}} the {{mechanism}} leading to apomixis in citrus. However, singular cases of polyembryony {{have been reported}} in non-apomictic genotypes as a consequence of 2 x× 4 x <b>hybridisations</b> and in vitro culture of isolated nucellus. The origin of the plants obtained as a consequence of these two processes is still unclear. In this work, we systematically analyzed the genetic structure (ploidy and allelic constitution at SSR locus) of plants obtained from polyembryonic seeds arising from 2 x× 4 x sexual <b>hybridisations</b> or regenerated from nucellus culture in vitro of different non-apomictic citrus genotypes. Histological studies were also conduced to try to identify the initiation process of polyembryony in nonapomictic genotypes. We demonstrate that all plants obtained from the same undeveloped seed in 2 x× 4 x <b>hybridisations</b> resulted from fission of the original zygotic embryo. Also, the plants obtained from in vitro culture of nucellus were recovered by somatic embryogenesis from cells having the same genotype as the zygotic embryos of the same seed. It appears that in non-apomictic citrus, proembryos or embryogenic cells are formed by fission of the original zygotic embryo and that the development of these adventitious embryos, normally hampered, can take place in vivo or in vitro as result of two different mechanisms that prevent the dominance of the initial zygotic embryo.

40|$|EBV is {{associated}} with B-lymphocytes. It is, however, not clear whether spontaneous activation of EBV genomes in carrier lymphocytes, which {{are present in the}} lymphocyte rich area of the oropharynx, is responsible for lifelong persistence of antibody-titers directed against EBV related antigens and the shedding of virus into the oropharynx. Alternatively EBV could reside in specific sites of the body and be produced there resembling somehow the situation of Marek's disease virus of chicken. That virus is found in T-lymphocytes and produced and spread from the epithelium of featherfollicles. In situ <b>hybridisations</b> with frozen sections of tonsils and parotid glands reveiled that EBV genomes are present in the tissue of the parotid gland of healthy seropositive persons.

40|$|Abstract — This paper {{presents}} {{an application of}} a fuzzy programming approach for multiple objectives to the aggregate production planning (APP). The parameters levels have been applied via a case study from the SMEs company in Thailand. The proposed model attempts to minimise total production cost and minimise the subcontracting units. Conventional harmony search algorithm (HSA) with its <b>hybridisations</b> of the global best harmony search (GHSA) and the variable neighbourhood search of the HSA (VHSA) are applied for fine aggregate production planning. Based on the experimental results, {{it can be concluded}} that the proposed VHSA is more effective than the other approaches in terms of superiority of solution and required CPU time. The basic idea is the change of neighbourhoods during searching for a better solution. The <b>hybridisations</b> proceed by a descent method to a local minimum exploring then, systematically or at random, increasingly distant neighbourhoods of this local solution. The proposed model yields an efficient compromise solution and the overall levels of decision making satisfaction with the multiple objectives...|$|R

40|$|Background—A {{long time}} {{goal of the}} medical {{research}} community has been the identification of a reliable and valid marker for Crohn's disease.  Aim—To identify differences in the genetic expression patterns of healthy and diseased tissues.  Method—The RNA arbitrarily primed polymerase chain reaction (RAP-PCR) procedure was modified to improve its potential to identify clinical markers in heterogeneous RNA populations.  Results—With this procedure, a 1065 bp PCR product associated with the inflammation that occurs in Crohn's disease was identified, cloned and sequenced. Northern blot <b>hybridisations</b> showed that this novel sequence originates from a unique RNA species of 3. 1 kb. Dot blot <b>hybridisations</b> clearly showed that this RNA species was specific to Crohn's disease. Moreover, its abundance seemed to correlate with the severity of inflammation. Finally, this RNA species was also detected in macroscopically normal areas from Crohn's disease specimens, suggesting that it appears either early during the disease or at least before severe manifestations.  Conclusion—This finding of a 3. 1 kb RNA species permits the discrimination of Crohn's disease manifestations. Although further clinical work is required, this transcript appears to have definite potential as a diagnostic marker. ...|$|R
