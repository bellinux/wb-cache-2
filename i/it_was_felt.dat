5|$|Despite the accident, a {{pre-production}} {{batch of}} ten aircraft was ordered on 27 July 1945 as <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>felt</b> that mixed-power aircraft {{would be of}} some use easing the transition of pilots from piston-engine fighters to jet-engined ones. At the same time Sukhoi's Su-5 was cancelled as it was judged inferior to the I-250.|$|E
5|$|The film is Cooper's {{feature film}} debut.

5|$|Archer's visit precipitated {{a crisis}} in the colonial administration. <b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>felt</b> he had been far too {{friendly}} to Abd al-Rahman, who was viewed with suspicion by many administrators. Archer was forced to resign, replaced by Sir John Maffey. Abd al-Rahman was placed under restriction on travel outside Omdurman and Khartoum and was told to instruct his supporters to halt their political and religious activities.|$|E
5|$|As {{far as the}} Belgians were concerned, the Dyle Plan had advantages. Instead of {{the limited}} Allied advance to the Scheldt, or meeting the Germans on the Franco-Belgian border, the move to the Dyle river would reduce the Allied front in central Belgium by , freeing more forces {{for use as a}} {{strategic}} reserve. <b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>felt</b> it would save more Belgian territory, in particular the eastern industrial regions. It also had the advantage of absorbing Dutch and Belgian Army formations (including some 20 Belgian divisions). Gamelin was to justify the Dyle Plan after the defeat using these arguments.|$|E
5|$|Harmon was {{preceded by}} his two older brothers, Kenneth B. Harmon, {{of the class of}} 1910, and Millard F. Harmon, Jr., of the class of 1912. Hubert Harmon was ejected when it was {{discovered}} that he had two brothers at West Point, as <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>felt</b> that the taxpayers would not be getting their money's worth educating three sons of the same family. He was readmitted in June 1911 after his father lobbied numerous government officials. He now only had one brother at West Point, as Kenneth had graduated the year before. Both Millard Jr., and Hubert subsequently became three-star generals.|$|E

5|$|In 1933 the Metropolitan Railway {{was taken}} into public {{ownership}} and became the Metropolitan line of London Transport. The management of London Transport aimed to reduce goods services, and <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>felt</b> {{that there was little}} chance of the more distant parts of the former Metropolitan Railway ever becoming viable passenger routes. The line was closed on 30 November 1935, and all buildings and infrastructure at Brill associated with the line were sold at auction. Most of the infrastructure was subsequently demolished, though three station cottages survive.|$|E
5|$|In 1990, President F.W. de Klerk started {{negotiations}} to end apartheid in South Africa with Nelson Mandela's African National Congress (ANC). During negotiation, the white South African Rugby Board and the non-racial South African Rugby Union merged {{to create the}} South African Rugby Football Union. Rugby {{at the time was}} seen by black South Africans as a symbol of white supremacy. The ANC demanded that the new SARFU improve development of black players. This was because the Springboks team consisted solely of white players at the time, though black players were eligible for selection for the Springboks following the merger of the two governing bodies. Following the yes vote in the South African apartheid referendum in March 1992, the IRB lifted restrictions on tours of South Africa. It was announced that the return test would be against New Zealand. This was criticised in South Africa as the Springboks had not played full international rugby for 11 years and <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>felt</b> it would not be competitive however New Zealand were invited because <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>felt</b> appropriate after the events around the 1981 South Africa rugby union tour.|$|E
5|$|In {{a desperate}} attempt to improve the {{situation}} and hamper British operations, a number of experienced night fighter commanders and pilots suggested restarting intruder operations over England. In 1940–41, German night fighters, lacking airborne radar sets and a means to locate them over Germany, had flown to British bomber bases and attempted to destroy RAF bombers as they returned from their missions. Adolf Hitler had ordered a cessation of these activities for propaganda and practical reasons but these operations had met with reasonable success in 1941 and <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>felt</b> they may do so again.|$|E

5|$|Military bases {{repeatedly}} {{tried to}} call the Army Control Station in Hiroshima. The complete silence from that city puzzled the General Staff; they knew that no large enemy raid had occurred and that no sizable store of explosives was in Hiroshima at that time. A young officer was instructed to fly immediately to Hiroshima, to land, survey the damage, and return to Tokyo with reliable information for the staff. <b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>felt</b> that nothing serious had taken place and that the explosion was just a rumor.|$|E
5|$|On 23 January 2004 four protesters {{climbed onto}} the gantry over the Tamar Bridge to {{highlight}} {{the work of the}} group Fathers 4 Justice who promote the rights of fathers in child custody disputes. The protest caused rush-hour tailbacks {{on both sides of the}} bridge. Charges against the protesters were later dropped after <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>felt</b> there would not be a realistic chance of conviction.|$|E
5|$|The 1802 Vrancea {{earthquake}} {{occurred in}} the Vrancea Mountains of Romania on , on St. Paraskeva's Day.

5|$|The Boy Scouts Association {{was formed}} in 1910, {{in order to provide}} a {{national}} body in the United Kingdom which could organise and support the rapidly growing number of Scout Patrols and Troops, which had begun to form spontaneously following the publication of Scouting for Boys and The Scout magazine in 1908. It was also the wish of Baden-Powell to wrest control of Scouting from his book's publishers as <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>felt</b> the Scout Movement was not given the status it deserved as the publisher C. Arthur Pearson Limited controlled much of Scouting.|$|E
5|$|The Court reargued {{the case}} {{at the behest of}} Associate Justice Felix Frankfurter, who used reargument as a {{stalling}} tactic, to allow the Court to gather a consensus around a Brown opinion that would outlaw segregation. The justices in support of desegregation spent much effort convincing those who initially intended to dissent to join a unanimous opinion. Although the legal effect would be same for a majority rather than unanimous decision, <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>felt</b> that dissent could be used by segregation supporters as a legitimizing counter-argument.|$|E
5|$|The Legion spurred {{several million}} Roman Catholics across the U.S. {{to sign up}} for the boycott, {{allowing}} local religious leaders to determine which films to protest. Conservative Protestants tended to support much of the crackdown, particularly in the South, where anything relating to the state of race relations or miscegenation could not be portrayed. Although the Central Conference of American Rabbis joined in the protest, it was an uneasy alliance given the heavy presence of Jewish studio executives and producers, which, <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>felt</b> had inspired {{at least some of the}} vitriol from the Catholic groups.|$|E

5|$|The {{extent of}} the damage meant it was not {{possible}} to determine the exact source of ignition, but possibilities include an emergency generator and the depot's fire pump system. The investigators did not believe that it was caused either by the driver of a fuel tanker, as had been speculated, or by anyone using a mobile phone. <b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>felt</b> unlikely that the explosion had a widespread effect on air quality at ground level.|$|E
5|$|The {{match is}} largely remembered for the {{disaster}} that occurred before the kick-off. Liverpool fans breached a fence separating {{the two groups}} of supporters and charged the Juventus fans. The resulting weight of people caused a retaining wall to collapse, killing 39 people and injuring hundreds. Despite calls for an abandonment, the match went ahead because <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>felt</b> that further trouble would otherwise occur. The disaster prompted UEFA to ban English clubs from European football for five years.|$|E

Two of her superiors had discussed not taking her to Iraq; <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>felt</b> she was a risk to herself and possibly others, according to a statement later issued by the Army—but the shortage of intelligence analysts dictated their decision to take her.
