40|$|Bovine prion {{diseases}} {{are composed of}} two types of bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE), classical BSE and atypical BSE. Recent studies have identified one case of atypical BSE with an <b>E</b> <b>211</b> K mutation. <b>E</b> <b>211</b> K is homologous to the human E 200 K mutation, which is related to familial Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (CJD), one of the familial forms of human {{prion diseases}}. To date, familial forms of prion diseases have not been reported in non-human animals. Because the familial forms of human prion diseases {{account for more than}} 10 % of all human prion disease cases, the detection of the <b>E</b> <b>211</b> K mutation in healthy cattle is very important for verifying the role of this mutation as a familial form of BSE. To detect putative mutations related to familial BSE, specifically <b>E</b> <b>211</b> K in Korean native cattle (Hanwoo) and Korean dairy cattle (Holstein), we performed direct sequencing targeting codon 211 and the adjacent regions of the bovine prion protein (PRNP) gene in 384 Hanwoo and 152 Holstein cattle.

40|$|Abstract Background In 2006, an {{atypical}} U. S. case of bovine {{spongiform encephalopathy}} (BSE) was discovered in Alabama and later reported to be polymorphic for glutamate (E) and lysine (K) codons at position 211 in the bovine prion protein gene (Prnp) coding sequence. A bovine <b>E</b> <b>211</b> K mutation {{is important because it}} is analogous to the most common pathogenic mutation in humans (E 200 K) which causes hereditary Creutzfeldt – Jakob disease, an autosomal dominant form of prion disease. The present report describes a high-throughput matrix-associated laser desorption/ionization-time-of-flight mass spectrometry assay for scoring the Prnp <b>E</b> <b>211</b> K variant and its use to determine an upper limit for the K 211 allele frequency in U. S. cattle. Results The K 211 allele was not detected in 6062 cattle, including those from five commercial beef processing plants (3892 carcasses) and 2170 registered cattle from 42 breeds. Multiple nearby polymorphisms in Prnp coding sequence of 1456 diverse purebred cattle (42 breeds) did not interfere with scoring <b>E</b> <b>211</b> or K 211 alleles. Based on these results, the upper bounds for prevalence of the <b>E</b> <b>211</b> K variant was estimated to be extremely low, less than 1 in 2000 cattle (Bayesian analysis based on 95 % quantile of the posterior distribution with a uniform prior). Conclusion No groups or breeds of U. S. cattle are presently known to harbor the Prnp K 211 allele. Because a carrier was not detected, the number of additional atypical BSE cases with K 211 will also be vanishingly low. </p...|$|E
40|$|BACKGROUND: Bovine spongiform {{encephalopathy}} (BSE) is a transmissible {{spongiform encephalopathy}} (TSE) of cattle. Classical BSE is associated with ingestion of BSE-contaminated feedstuffs. H- and L-type BSE, collectively known as atypical BSE, differ from classical BSE by displaying a different disease phenotype {{and they have not}} been linked to the consumption of contaminated feed. Interestingly, the 2006 US H-type atypical BSE animal had a polymorphism at codon 211 of the bovine prion gene resulting in a glutamic acid to lysine substitution (<b>E</b> <b>211</b> K). This substitution is analogous a human polymorphism associated with the most prevalent form of heritable TSE in humans, and it is considered to have caused BSE in the 2006 US atypical BSE animal. In order to determine if this amino acid change is a heritable trait in cattle, we sequenced the prion alleles of the only known offspring of this animal, a 2 -year-old heifer. PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: Sequence analysis revealed that both the 2006 US atypical BSE animal and its 2 -year-old heifer were heterozygous at bovine prion gene nucleotides 631 through 633 for GAA (glutamic acid) and AAA (lysine). Both animals carry the <b>E</b> <b>211</b> K polymorphism, indicating that the allele is heritable and may persist within the cattle population. CONCLUSIONS: This is the first evidence that the <b>E</b> <b>211</b> K polymorphism is a germline polymorphism, not a somatic mutation, suggesting BSE may be transmitted genetically in cattle. In the event that <b>E</b> <b>211</b> K proves to result in a genetic form of BSE, this would be the first indication that all 3 etiologic forms of TSEs (spontaneous, hereditary, and infectious) are present in a non-human species. Atypical BSE arising as both genetic and spontaneous disease, in the context of reports that at least some forms of atypical BSE can convert to classical BSE in mice, suggests a cattle origin for classical BSE...|$|E
40|$|In 2006, {{a case of}} H-type bovine spongiform {{encephalopathy}} (BSE-H) was diagnosed in a cow that {{was associated with a}} heritable polymorphism in the bovine prion protein gene (PRNP) resulting in a lysine for glutamate amino acid substitution at codon 211 (called <b>E</b> <b>211</b> K) of the prion protein. Although the prevalence of this polymorphism is low, cattle carrying the K 211 allele may be predisposed to rapid onset of BSE-H when exposed or to the potential development of a genetic BSE. This study was conducted to better understand the relationship between the K 211 polymorphism and its effect on BSE phenotype. BSE-H from the US 2006 case was inoculated intracranially (IC) in one PRNP wild-type (EE 211) calf and one EK 211 calf. In addition, one wild-type calf and one EK 211 calf were inoculated IC with brain homogenate from a US 2003 classical BSE case. All cattle developed clinical disease. The survival time of the <b>E</b> <b>211</b> K BSE-H inoculated EK 211 calf (10 months) was shorter than the wild-type calf (18 months). This genotype effect was not observed in classical BSE inoculated cattle (both 26 months). Significant changes in retinal function were observed in H-type BSE challenged cattle only. Cattle challenged with the same inoculum showed similar severity and neuroanatomical distribution of vacuolation and disease-associated prion protein deposition in the brain, though differences in neuropathology were observed between <b>E</b> <b>211</b> K BSE-H and classical BSE inoculated animals. Western blot results for brain tissue from challenged animals were consistent with the inoculum strains. This study demonstrates that the phenotype of <b>E</b> <b>211</b> K BSE-H remains stable when transmitted to cattle without the K 211 polymorphism, and exhibits a number of features that differ from classical BSE in both wild-type and heterozygous EK 211 animals...|$|E

40|$|Between 2005 and 2007 Chikungunya virus (CHIKV) caused {{its largest}} outbreak/epidemic in {{documented}} history. An unusual {{feature of this}} epidemic is the involvement of Ae. albopictus as a principal vector. Previously we have demonstrated that a single mutation E 1 -A 226 V significantly changed {{the ability of the}} virus to infect and be transmitted by this vector when expressed in the background of well characterized CHIKV strains LR 2006 OPY 1 and 37997. However, in the current study we demonstrate that introduction of the E 1 -A 226 V mutation into the background of an infectious clone derived from the Ag 41855 strain (isolated in Uganda in 1982) does not significantly increase infectivity for Ae. albopictus. In order to elucidate the genetic determinants that affect CHIKV sensitivity to the E 1 -A 226 V mutation in Ae. albopictus, the genomes of the LR 2006 OPY 1 and Ag 41855 strains were used for construction of chimeric viruses and viruses with a specific combination of point mutations at selected positions. Based upon the midgut infection rates of the derived viruses in Ae. albopictus and Ae. aegypti mosquitoes, a critical role of the mutations at positions E 2 - 60 and <b>E</b> 2 - <b>211</b> on vector infection was revealed. The E 2 -G 60 D mutation was an important determinant of CHIKV infectivity for both Ae. albopictus and Ae. aegypti, but only moderately modulated the effect of the E 1 -A 226 V mutation in Ae. albopictus. However, the effect of the <b>E</b> 2 -I <b>211</b> T mutation with respect to mosquito infections was much more specific, strongly modifying the effect of the E 1 -A 226 V mutation in Ae. albopictus. In contrast, CHIKV infectivity for Ae. aegypti was not influenced by the E 2 - 1211 T mutation. The occurrence of the E 2 - 60 G and <b>E</b> 2 - <b>211</b> I residues among CHIKV isolates was analyzed, revealing a high prevalence of <b>E</b> 2 - <b>211</b> I among strains belonging to the Eastern/Central/South African (ECSA) clade. This suggests that the <b>E</b> 2 - <b>211</b> I might be important for adaptation of CHIKV to some particular conditions prevalent in areas occupied by ECSA stains.

40|$|Summary It {{has been}} {{reported}} that chloride–proton exchanger ClC- 5 and vacuolar-type H+-ATPase are essential for endosomal acidification in the renal proximal cells. Here, we found that ClC- 5 is expressed in the gastric parietal cells which secrete actively hydrochloric acid at the luminal region of the gland, and that it is partially localized in the intracellular tubulovesicles in which gastric H+,K+-ATPase is abundantly expressed. ClC- 5 was co-immunoprecipitated with H+,K+-ATPase in the lysate of tubulovesicles. The ATP-dependent uptake of 36 Cl− into the vesicles was abolished by 2 -methyl- 8 -(phenylmethoxy) imidazo[1, 2 -a]pyridine- 3 -acetonitrile (SCH 28080), an inhibitor of H+,K+-ATPase, suggesting functional expression of ClC- 5. In the tetracycline-regulated expression system of ClC- 5 in the HEK 293 cells stably expressing gastric H+,K+-ATPase, ClC- 5 was co-immunoprecipitated with H+,K+-ATPase, but not with endogenous Na+,K+-ATPase. The SCH 28080 -sensitive 36 Cl− transporting activity was observed in the ClC- 5 -expressing cells, but not in the ClC- 5 -non-expressing cells. The mutant (<b>E</b> <b>211</b> A-ClC- 5), which has no H+ transport activity, did not show the SCH 28080 -sensitive 36 Cl− transport. On the other hand, both ClC- 5 and its mutant (<b>E</b> <b>211</b> A) significantly increased the activity of H+,K+-ATPase. Our results suggest that ClC- 5 and H+,K+-ATPase are functionally associated and that they may contribute to gastric acid secretion...|$|E

40|$|The {{activity}} of voltage-gated K+ (KV) channels {{plays an important}} role in regulating pulmonary artery smooth muscle cell (PASMC) contraction, proliferation, and apoptosis. The highly conserved NH 2 -terminal tetramerization domain (T 1) of KV channels is important for proper channel assembly, association with regulatory KV β-subunits, and localization of the channel to the plasma membrane. We recently reported two nonsynonymous mutations (G 182 R and <b>E</b> <b>211</b> D) in the KCNA 5 gene of patients with idiopathic pulmonary arterial hypertension, which localize to the T 1 domain of KCNA 5. To study the electrophysiological properties and expression patterns of the mutants compared with the wild-type (WT) channel in vitro, we transfected HEK- 293 cells with WT KCNA 5, G 182 R, <b>E</b> <b>211</b> D, or the double mutant G 182 R/E 211 D channel. The mutants form functional channels; however, whole cell current kinetic differences between WT and mutant channels exist. Steady-state inactivation curves of the G 182 R and G 182 R/E 211 D channels reveal accelerated inactivation; the mutant channels inactivated at more hyperpolarized potentials compared with the WT channel. Channel protein expression was also decreased by the mutations. Compared with the WT channel, which was present in its mature glycosylated form, the mutant channels are present in greater proportion in their immature form in HEK- 293 cells. Furthermore, G 182 R protein level is greatly reduced in COS- 1 cells compared with WT. Immunostaining data support the hypothesis that, while WT protein localizes to the plasma membrane, mutant protein is mainly retained in intracellular packets. Overall, these data support a role for the T 1 domain in channel kinetics as well as in KCNA 5 channel subcellular localization...|$|E

40|$|Along history, {{hydrofoils}} have accompanied Men {{in their}} search for the perfect watercraft that would offer both efficiency and velocity, while assuring the user’s security and comfort. Several worldwide celebrated personalities have participated in this endless quest, and have aided hydrofoils to develop their capabilities towards their fully potential. Nevertheless, despite their many advantages, hydrofoils still occupy a secondary role in many sports like windsurfing, and are yet to reach plaid people who seem oblivious to their existence. However, this project states that many windsurfing companies – like AHD – are demonstrating a slow but constant interest in attaching hydrofoils to their boards, thus contributing to an enhancement of hydrofoils market. Due to their many benefits, hydrofoils have been the object of several studies over the years. This particular project is based on Laura Voltà and Júlia Solanes previous research report: Hidrodinàmica i Aplicacions dels Hydrofoils al Windsurf, whose objective was to demonstrate how hydrofoils increase the lift coefficient of a windsurfing board, and allow it to reach higher velocities. Therefore, the current project focused on extending the previous one, providing an optimization of the hydrofoil profile – the Eppler <b>E</b> <b>211</b> – by designing and attaching a winglet. The addition of the winglet was destined to ameliorate the behavior of the profile in terms of drag reduction. When travelling through water, hydrofoils cause a gradient of pressure between the upper and the lower section of the profile, which eventually translates into the generation of wingtip vortices similar to those that appear in many aircrafts. Therefore, these lift induced vortices produce Induced drag, which can be reduced by, for example, adding winglets to the profile. As it is stated in this project, in the previous research report the <b>E</b> <b>211</b> presented an induced drag of 0, 0206, which was calculated {{in order to be able}} to set the conditions that had to be met so a perceivable reduction of induced drag could be possible...|$|E

40|$|Genetic and phylogenetic {{analyses}} {{suggest that}} the pandemic H 1 N 1 / 2009 virus was derived from well-established swine influenza lineages; however, there is no convincing evidence that the pandemic virus was generated from a direct precursor in pigs. Furthermore, the evolutionary dynamics of influenza virus in pigs have not been well documented. Here, we subjected a recombinant virus (rH 1 N 1) with the same constellation makeup as the pandemic H 1 N 1 / 2009 virus to nine serial passages in pigs. The severity of infection sequentially increased with each passage. Deep sequencing of viral quasispecies from the ninth passage found five consensus amino acid mutations: PB 1 A 469 T, PA 1129 T, NA N 329 D, NS 1 N 205 K, and NEP T 48 N. Mutations in the hemagglutinin (HA) protein, however, differed greatly between {{the upper and lower}} respiratory tracts. Three representative viral clones with the five consensus mutations were selected for functional evaluation. Relative to the parental virus, the three viral clones showed enhanced replication and polymerase activity in vitro and enhanced replication, pathogenicity, and transmissibility in pigs, guinea pigs, and ferrets in vivo. Specifically, two mutants of rH 1 N 1 (PB 1 A 469 T and a combination of NS 1 N 205 K and NEP T 48 N) were identified as determinants of transmissibility in guinea pigs. Crucially, one mutant viral clone with the five consensus mutations, which also carried D 187 <b>E,</b> K <b>211</b> <b>E,</b> and S 289 N mutations in its HA, additionally was able to infect ferrets by airborne transmission as effectively as the pandemic virus. Our findings demonstrate that influenza virus can acquire viral characteristics that {{are similar to those of}} the pandemic virus after limited serial passages in pigs...|$|R
