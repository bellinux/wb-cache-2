500|$|The episode {{received}} mostly positive {{reviews from}} television critics. Noel Murray of The A.V. Club graded the episode with a B-, explaining that [...] "after four solid weeks of good-to-great episodes, Fringe delivered its first semi-dud of season three" [...] because the case-of-the-week was [...] "dull" [...] and [...] "twistless", and the dialogue was [...] "too flat and too earnest". Despite this, Murray thought the episode was [...] "essential viewing" [...] for Fringe fans due to certain revelations, {{such as how}} people are actually alive in the amber, and also because it moved the plot closer to an Olivia-Altlivia confrontation. Conversely, the Los Angeles Times Andrew Hanson {{thought it was a}} good episode, writing [...] "This is what I love about Fringe. Not only <b>do</b> <b>they</b> <b>have</b> <b>the</b> cool science, they also have the moral questions that go along". Ken Tucker from Entertainment Weekly thought the episode was [...] "enthralling," [...] and he enjoyed the brothers' [...] "nice emotional story," [...] and praised Anna Torv's acting. TV Squad reviewer Jason Hughes enjoyed the parallel universe, and in particular the character of Lincoln Lee, believing he was [...] "too rich a character to just abandon" [...] once the series stopped alternating between universes.|$|E
