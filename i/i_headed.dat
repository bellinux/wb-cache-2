5|$|Auschwitz II Birkenau was liberated by the Red Army {{at around}} 3:30 p.m. on 27 January 1945, {{and the main}} camp (Auschwitz I) two hours later. Military trucks loaded with bread arrived the next day. Volunteers began to offer first aid and improvised {{assistance}} the following week. In early February, the Polish Red Cross hospital opened in blocks 14, 21, and 22 at Auschwitz <b>I,</b> <b>headed</b> by Dr. Józef Bellert and staffed by 30 volunteer doctors and nurses from Kraków, along with around 90 former inmates. The critically injured patients – estimated at several thousands – were relocated from Birkenau and Monowitz to the main camp. Some orphaned children were immediately adopted by Oświęcim residents, while others were transferred to Kraków, where {{a number of them}} were adopted by Polish families. Others were placed in an orphanage at Harbutowice.|$|E
5|$|The kingdom {{was divided}} into Mandala or Rashtras (provinces). A Rashtra was ruled by a Rashtrapathi who on {{occasion}} was the emperor himself. Amoghavarsha I's empire had sixteen Rashtras. Under a Rashtra was a Vishaya (district) overseen by a Vishayapathi. Trusted ministers sometimes ruled more than a Rashtra. For example, Bankesha, a commander of Amoghavarsha <b>I</b> <b>headed</b> Banavasi-12000, Belvola-300, Puligere-300, Kunduru-500 and Kundarge-70, the suffix designating the number of villages in that territory. Below the Vishaya was the Nadu looked after by the Nadugowda or Nadugavunda; sometimes there were two such officials, one assuming the position through heredity and another appointed centrally. The lowest division was a Grama or village administered by a Gramapathi or Prabhu Gavunda.|$|E
25|$|On April 27, 1998, Abramoff wrote {{a letter}} to the editor of The Seattle Times rebutting an article {{critical}} of him and his alleged role as effectively a Public Relations puppet of the then-apartheid South African military. Abramoff rebutted: The IFF was a conservative group which <b>I</b> <b>headed.</b> It was vigorously anti-Communist, but it was also actively anti-apartheid. In 1987, it was one of the first conservative groups to call for the release of Nelson Mandela, a position for which it was roundly criticized by other conservatives at the time. While <b>I</b> <b>headed</b> the IFF, we accepted funding only from private individuals and corporations and would have absolutely rejected any offer of South African military funding, or any other kind of funding from any government – good or evil.|$|E

50|$|The Conference of Addis Ababa was {{a meeting}} of the Oriental Orthodox churches in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia in January 1965. This meeting was momentous as there has been no such {{collective}} meeting of the various Non-Chalcedonian churches since the 5th century. The meeting was attended by Pope Cyril VI (head of the Coptic Orthodox Church of Alexandria), Mor Ignatius Ya`qub III (head of the Syriac Orthodox Church), Vazgen <b>I</b> (<b>head</b> of the Armenian Apostolic Church), Khoren <b>I</b> (<b>head</b> of the Armenian Catholicosate of Cilicia), and Baselios Augen <b>I</b> (<b>head</b> of the Malankara Orthodox Syrian Church).|$|R

25|$|Unable {{to resist}} {{advancing}} Turkish troops during the Battle of Baku, Dunsterville ordered {{the evacuation of}} the city on September 14, after six weeks of occupation, and withdrew to Iran; most of the Armenian population escaped with the British forces. The Ottoman Army of Islam and its Azeri allies, led by Nuri Pasha, entered Baku on September 15 and slaughtered between 10,000 – 20,000 Armenians {{in retaliation for the}} March massacre of Muslims. The capital of the ADR was finally moved from Ganja to Baku. However, after the Armistice of Mudros between Great Britain and Turkey on October 30, Turkish troops were replaced by the Allies of World War <b>I.</b> <b>Headed</b> by British general William Montgomery Thomson, who had declared himself the military governor of Baku, 5,000 Commonwealth soldiers arrived in Baku on November 17, 1918. By General Thomson's order, martial law was implemented in Baku.|$|E
2500|$|One night I went to Q-Tip's {{solo album}} release party {{and at some}} point in the night, I ran into the guy everyone's been telling me is behind the bootleg. So I {{approached}} him. When I told him what I suspected, to my surprise, he got real loud with me right there in the middle of the club. It was strange. We separated and I went over to the bar. I was sitting there like, [...] "No the fuck this nigga did not....." [...] I was talking to people, but I was really talking to myself out loud, just in a state of shock. Before I even realized what I was doing, <b>I</b> <b>headed</b> back over to him, but this time I was blacking out with anger. The next thing I knew, all hell had broken loose in the club. That night the guy went straight to the police and I was indicted...|$|E

60|$|So <b>I</b> <b>headed</b> {{down the}} ravine, {{looking for a}} blunt, bold crag, which I had descried from camp.
