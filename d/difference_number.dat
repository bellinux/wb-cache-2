40|$|Pulsed-field gel {{electrophoresis}} (PFGE) {{has been the}} typing method of choice for strain identification in epidemiological studies of several bacterial species of medical importance. The usual procedure for the comparison of strains and assignment of strain type and subtype relies on visual assessment of band <b>difference</b> <b>number,</b> followed by an incremental assignment to the group hosting the most similar type previously seen. Band-based similarity coefficients, such as the Dice or the Jaccard coefficient, are then used for dendrogram construction, which provides a quantitative assessment of strain similarity. PFGE type assignment {{is based on the}} definition of a threshold linkage value, below which strains are assigned to the same group. This is typically performed empirically by inspecting the hierarchical cluster analysis dendrogram containing the strains of interest. This approach has the problem that the threshold value selected is dependent on the linkage method used for dendrogram construction. Furthermore, the use of a linkage method skews the original similarity values between strains. In this paper we assess the goodness of classification of several band-based similarity coefficients by comparing it with the band <b>difference</b> <b>number</b> for PFGE type and subtype classification using receiver operating characteristic curves. The procedure described was applied to a collection of PFGE results for 1, 798 isolates of Streptococcus pneumoniae, which documented 96 types and 396 subtypes. The band-based similarity coefficients were found to perform equally well for type classification, but with different proportions of false-positive and false-negative classifications in their minimal false discovery rate when they were used for subtype classification...|$|E

Both coherent scattering (where all the initial modes are coherent) and chaotic scattering (where initial phonon mode is chaotic {{and all the other}} modes are coherent) are studied. Nonclassical character of Raman process is observed by means of intermodal entanglement, single mode and intermodal squeezing of vacuum fluctuations, sub-shot noise and wave variances. Joint photon-phonon number and integrated-intensity distributions are then used to illustrate the observed nonclassicalities. Conditional and <b>difference</b> <b>number</b> distributions are also provided to illustrate the nonclassical character.

The proposed scheme uses the principle component analysis (PCA) algorithm to sort the codebook and to find two similar codewords of an image block. According to the secret to be embedded {{and the difference between}} those two similar codewords, the original image block is transformed into a <b>difference</b> <b>number</b> table. Finally, this table is compressed by entropy coding and sent to the receiver. The experimental results demonstrate that the proposed scheme can achieve greater hiding capacity, about five bits per index, with an acceptable bit rate. At the receiver end, after the compressed code has been decoded, the image can be recovered to a VQ compressed image. Keywords—Data Hiding, Steganography, Vector Quantization 1...|$|E

40|$|The {{title of}} this thesis is Translation Analysis on The Grammatical Cohesive Devices in The “The Adventures of Tintin: The Secret of The Unicorn” Comic by Herge. This {{research}} focuses on the translation analysis of the grammatical cohesive devices. The {{purpose of this study}} is finding the types of grammatical cohesive devices used in the comic in the source and target text and also types of equivalent used in translating the grammatical cohesive devices in the target text. The data was taken from “The Adventures of Tintin : The Secret of The Unicorn” comic by Herge that is translated in English version by Leslie Lonsdale-Cooper and Michael Turner and in Indonesian version by Dini Pandia. The source text (ST) is the English version and the target text (TT) is the Indonesian version. The research focused on the first page until the thirty fifth page. The result of this analysis shows that there are 788 words that belong to grammatical cohesive devices. Most of them belong to reference which consist of 638 words in the ST and 392 words in the TT. And the <b>difference</b> <b>number</b> is 49. 75 %. The <b>difference</b> <b>number</b> is caused by some changing types from the ST to TT that influence the result number on each type. Such as ellipsis from 10 reaches 321 in TT. This is because most of the grammatical cohesive devices that was found is changed into ellipsis in the target text. Although there are some changes in the grammatical cohesive devices, the main ideas of the sentences do not change and those are still readable and easily understood by the readers. The translation equivalent types that used in translating the grammatical cohesive devices are functional equivalent, reduction, and compensation. There are 467 data that are translated using functional equivalent, and reduction is used in translating 321 data while 1 data is translated using compensation...|$|E

Computer adaptive testing may offer advantages over non-adaptive testing, including reduction of numbers of items required for precise measurement. OBJECTIVE - Our aim was to compare the efficiency of non-adaptive (NAT) and computer adaptive testing (CAT) facilitated by Partial Credit Model (PCM) -derived calibration to estimate skin cancer risk. METHODS - We used a random sample from a population-based Australian cohort study of skin cancer risk (N= 43, 794). All 30 items of the skin cancer risk scale were calibrated with the Rasch PCM. A total of 1000 cases generated following a normal distribution (mean [SD] 0 [1]) were simulated using three Rasch models with three fixed-item (dichotomous, rating scale, and partial credit) scenarios, respectively.

40|$|Abstract: This {{article has}} carried out {{systematic}} {{research on the}} multi-tooth meshing problem of involute internal gear pairs with small tooth <b>number</b> <b>difference</b> of normal gear. It firstly establishes the entity assembly model of internal gear pairs with precise tooth profile, then determines the number of multi-tooth meshing teeth pairs with finite element software and finally analyzes the main factors and reason affecting the number of meshing teeth pairs. In the range of tooth number of internal gear equal to 40 - 200, the conclusion is that when tooth <b>number</b> <b>difference</b> equal to 1 the number of effective meshing teeth pairs is 3 - 15,when tooth <b>number</b> <b>difference</b> equal to 5 the number of effective meshing teeth pairs is 3 - 11. The main factors affecting the number of meshing teeth pairs are tooth number and tooth <b>number</b> <b>difference.</b> The fewer tooth number is and the greater tooth <b>number</b> <b>difference</b> is, the fewer the number of meshing teeth pairs is. The reason is that when tooth number is obviously reduced or tooth <b>number</b> <b>difference</b> is obviously increased, the clearance of adjacent gear surface will be greatly increased, which will cause the decrease {{of the number of}} meshing teeth pairs. Within the normal value scope of modification coefficient difference of involute internal gear pairs with small tooth <b>number</b> <b>difference,</b> the influence of modification coefficient difference and modification coefficient is very small. When the torque increases, the number of effective contacting teech pairs will keep unchanged.

40|$|Self-efficacy is a student’s {{belief in}} his or her own {{capabilities}} regarding the completion of a specific task. Students with high levels of self-efficacy are proven to be more effective learners. If serious games, intelligent tutoring systems and computer enhanced learning in general can diagnose self-efficacy, it could lead to improved tutoring strategies, consequently improving the learning experience and process of the student. This research investigated the diagnosis of self-efficacy levels at runtime using mouse and keyboard input, the default communication channels of computer enhanced learning. In an empirical experiment, small to medium significant correlations were found between mouse movement and self-efficacy levels for the variables Distance <b>difference,</b> <b>Number</b> of pauses, Time difference, Pause time and Question time. Linear multiple regression revealed that mouse movement variables were able to predict 17 % of the levels of self-efficacy, in which the Time difference was the largest and only significant contributor.

Thermodynamic parameters such as adsorption equilibrium constant (Kads) and free energy of adsorption (ΔGads) were also evaluated.
