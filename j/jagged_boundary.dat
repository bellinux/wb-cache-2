Morphology and optical properties of the ZnO/ZnS core-shell heterostructured NWs after different rapid thermal annealing (RTA) treatments are investigated. Transmission electron microscopy measurements show the gradual disappearing of the <b>jagged</b> <b>boundary</b> between ZnO and ZnS {{with the increase of}} RTA temperature, while a decrease of interfacial composition fluctuation and a formation of ZnOS phase can be found after a RTA treatment of 300 °C. Temperature-dependent photoluminescence exhibits the features of “S-shape” peak positions and a “valley shape” for the emission width, implying the existence of localized excitons in the core-shell NWs. Moreover, it is noted that the RTA treatments can lower the localized degree which is confirmed by optical measurement. The results indicate that the optical behavior of excitons in ZnO/ZnS core-shell heterostructured NWs can be manipulated by appropriate thermal treatments, which is very important for their practical device applications...|$|E

The {{results showed that}} the surface envelope of adrenal gland was covered with developed connective tissues whose average thickness was up to 210 μm. A large number of sinusoids were distributed between the neighboring cells. The zona glomerulosa of adrenal cortex was thin and composed of columnar and cubic cells. The columnar cells were close to the edge and the cubic cells were found in the deep zone. The two kinds of cells were arranged in irregular groups. The thickness of zona fasiculata was about 3 times as much as that of zona glomerulosa, and the boundary was not obvious. Cells were arranged in irregular cords. Some small lipid droplets were in the shape of small vacuolation, and distributed in the cytoplasm. The cells of zona reticularis were adjacent to medulla with which they formed a <b>jagged</b> <b>boundary.</b> Cells were in network or in enclose acini. Medullae were darkly stained and clearly distinct from the cortex. Cells were large with elliptical nuclei whose nucleoli were significant. Cytoplasm was basophilic and stained to give blue violet appearance. A small amount of sympathetic ganglion cells were distributed in the medulla. The above results suggested that the adrenal gland structures of African white rhinoceros compared with other animals have similarities..

The effects on W of transient thermal loads of high energy occurring in a tokamak under operative conditions have been simulated through a single laser pulse delivered by an Nd:YAG laser. Bulk and plasma-sprayed (PS) samples have been submitted to tests and successively examined via SEM (scanning electron microscopy) observations. In both types of materials, the laser pulse induces similar effects: (i) a crater forms in the spot central area; (ii) all around the area, the ejection {{and the movement of}} molten metal give rise to a ridge; (iii) in a more external area, the surface shows plates with <b>jagged</b> <b>boundaries</b> and cracks induced by thermal stresses; (iv) the pores present in the original material become preferred ablation sites.

30|$|Generally, {{the source}} depth map could be {{generated}} by fast stereo matching technique with subsample stereo images or captured by RGB-D cameras {{with a lower}} resolution than the color image. Thus, the source depth map produced by fast stereo matching and depth camera usually has a lower resolution than the corresponding color image and contains a lot of noisy pixels including unknown pixels due to occlusions. Thus, the source depth map will be first up sampled before depth enhancement. In the paper, the traditional bicubic interpolation [22] is applied to recover the resolution of the source depth map to that of the corresponding color image. After upsampling depth map, we assume that the original texture and corresponding depth map, which are respectively expressed by g(x, y) and d(x, y), are with the same spatial resolution and come with some undesired noisy pixels in depth maps and images. Specially, the foreground boundaries do not well match the corresponding color image and <b>jagged</b> <b>boundaries</b> are produced from the interpolated depth map after the bicubic interpolation. If the depth is estimated by stereo matching algorithms, there exist mismatched and occluded pixels due to singularity properties. On the other hand, we cannot generate virtual image precisely by depth image-based rendering (DIBR), if the image and its corresponding depth map cannot be matched successfully due to the noises and holes existed in depth maps. Hence, the enhancements of the image and its depth become very important in 3 D visualization.|$|R

40|$|Microscopy cell image {{analysis}} {{is a fundamental}} tool for biological research. This analysis is used in studies of different aspects of cell cultures. Visual inspection of individual cells is very time consuming, insufficient to detect or describe delicate changes in cellular morphology. The main challenges in segmenting nuclei in histometry are {{due to the fact}} that the specimen is a 2 -D section of a 3 -D tissue sample. The 2 -D sectioning can result in partially imaged nuclei, sectioning of nuclei at odd angles, and damage due to the sectioning process. Furthermore, sections have finite thickness resulting in aggregating or overlapping nuclei in planar images. Hence a set of image objects that differ considerably from the ideal of round blob-like shapes occur. Their sizes and shapes in images can be irregular. The classic methodology for cell detection is image segmentation, which is a fundamental and difficult problem in computer vision. Image segmentation is a fundamental and difficult problem in computer vision. The difficulty in automatic segmentation of images of cells is often uneven due to auto fluorescence from the tissue and fluorescence from out-of-focus objects. This unevenness makes the separation of foreground and background a non-trivial task. The intensity variations within the nuclei further complicate the segmentation as the nuclei may be split into more than one object, leading to over-segmentation. Due to the cell nuclei are often clustered, make it difficult to separate the individual nuclei. Hence an automatic segmentation of cell nuclei is an essential step in image histometry and cytometry. This paper presents a robust method to segment clustered overlapping or aggregating nuclei cells using priori information of shape markers and marking function in a watershed-like algorithm. The shape markers are extracted using adaptive H-minima transform and prior information about the usual shape of normal/pathological nuclei cells. A new marking function based on outer distance transform, to avoid <b>jagged</b> <b>boundaries</b> of segmented objects is created. Thus the right sets of markers and a marking function are used to accurately separate clustered nuclei...|$|R

Unlike types 1 and 3, domain walls move easily through type 2 twins—usually normal to the twin walls. Finally, type 3 twins are typically elongated in shape with straight twin walls. These are characterized by a 90 ^∘ rotation about this c-axis, so the a- and b-axes (the magnetic hard and intermediate axes, respectively) are interchanged. As with type 1 twins, the change in magnetic anisotropy means these crystallographic twin walls often align with magnetic domain walls.|$|R
40|$|Real-time {{rendering}} of high-quality, anti-aliased shadows is a challenging problem in shadow mapping. Filtering the shadow map reduces aliasing, but artifacts are still visible for low-resolution shadow maps or small kernel sizes. Moreover, the existing techniques suffer from light leaking artifacts. Shadow silhouette recovery reduces perspective aliasing {{at the cost}} of large memory footprint and high computational overhead for the shadow mapping. In this paper, we reduce aliasing with the revectorization-based shadow mapping. To effectively reduce the perspective aliasing, we revectorize shadow boundaries based on their discontinuity directions. Then, we take advantage of the discontinuity space to filter the shadow silhouettes, further suppressing the remaining artifacts. To control the filter kernel size, we incorporate percentage-closer filtering into the algorithm. This enables us to reduce <b>jagged</b> shadow <b>boundaries,</b> to simulate penumbra and to provide high-quality screen-space anti-aliasing. Compared to previous techniques, we show that shadow revectorization produces less artifacts, consumes less memory and offers real-time performance. The results show that our solution can be used in games and other applications in which real-time, high-quality shadows are desirable...|$|R

One way of avoiding this problem is to allow districts which share a border with a state border to replace that border with a polygon or semi-circle enclosing the state boundary as a kind of virtual boundary definition, but using the actual perimeter of the district whenever this occurs inside the state boundaries. Enforcing a minimum isoperimetric quotient would encourage districts with a high ratio between area and perimeter.|$|R

40|$|The {{goal of this}} {{research}} is to develop more efficient techniques for computing the visibility and shadows in real-time rendering of three-dimensional scenes. Visibility algorithms determine what is visible from a camera, whereas shadow algorithms solve the same problem from the viewpoint of a light source. In rendering, a lot of computational resources are often spent on primitives that are not visible in the final image. One visibility algorithm for reducing the overhead is occlusion culling, which quickly discards the objects or primitives that are obstructed from the view by other primitives. A new method is presented for performing occlusion culling using silhouettes of meshes instead of triangles. Additionally, modifications are suggested to occlusion queries in order to reduce their computational overhead. The performance of currently available graphics hardware depends on the ordering of input primitives. A new technique, called delay streams, is proposed as a generic solution to order-dependent problems. The technique significantly reduces the pixel processing requirements by improving the efficiency of occlusion culling inside graphics hardware. Additionally, the memory requirements of order-independent transparency algorithms are reduced. A shadow map is a discretized representation of the scene geometry as seen by a light source. Typically the discretization causes difficult aliasing issues, such as <b>jagged</b> shadow <b>boundaries</b> and incorrect self-shadowing. A novel solution is presented for suppressing all types of aliasing artifacts by providing the correct sampling points for shadow maps, thus fully abandoning the previously used regular structures. Also, a simple technique is introduced for limiting the shadow map lookups to the pixels that get projected inside the shadow map. The fillrate problem of hardware-accelerated shadow volumes is greatly reduced with a new hierarchical rendering technique. The algorithm performs per-pixel shadow computations only at visible shadow boundaries, and uses lower resolution shadows for the parts of the screen that are guaranteed to be either fully lit or fully in shadow. The proposed techniques are expected to improve the rendering performance in most real-time applications that use 3 D graphics, especially in computer games. More efficient algorithms for occlusion culling and shadows are important steps towards larger, more realistic virtual environments. reviewe...|$|R
40|$|This {{research}} {{focuses on}} developing efficient algorithms for computing shadows in computer-generated images. A distinctive feature of the shadow algorithms presented in this thesis is that they produce correct, physically-based results, instead of giving approximations whose quality is often hard to ensure or evaluate. Light sources that are modeled as points without any spatial extent produce hard shadows with sharp boundaries. Shadow mapping is a traditional method for rendering such shadows. A shadow map is a depth buffer computed from the scene, using a point light source as the viewpoint. The finite resolution of the shadow map requires that its contents are resampled when determining the shadows on visible surfaces. This causes various artifacts such as incorrect self-shadowing and <b>jagged</b> shadow <b>boundaries.</b> A novel method is presented that avoids the resampling step, and provides exact shadows for every point visible in the image. The shadow volume algorithm is another commonly used algorithm for real-time rendering of hard shadows. This algorithm gives exact results and does not suffer from any resampling problems, but it tends to consume a lot of fillrate, which leads to performance problems. This thesis presents a new technique for locally choosing between two previous shadow volume algorithms with different performance characteristics. A simple criterion for making the local choices is shown to yield better performance than using either of the algorithms alone. Light sources with nonzero spatial extent give rise to soft shadows with smooth boundaries. A novel method is presented that transposes the classical processing order for soft shadow computation in offline rendering. Instead of casting shadow rays, the algorithm first conceptually collects every ray that {{would need to be}} cast, and then processes the shadow-casting primitives one by one, hierarchically finding the rays that are blocked. Another new soft shadow algorithm takes {{a different point of view}} into computing the shadows. Only the silhouettes of the shadow casters are used for determining the shadows, and an unintrusive execution model makes the algorithm practical for production use in offline rendering. The proposed techniques accelerate the computing of physically-based shadows in real-time and offline rendering. These improvements make it possible to use correct, physically-based shadows in a broad range of scenes that previous methods cannot handle efficiently enough.

40|$|Previous {{perspective}} reparameterizations {{approximate the}} aliasing errors for the {{points in a}} 2 D space [...] -the points along the view direction (i. e. horizontal plane in view space), from a geometric intuition. There's no explicit way to qualitatively analyze the aliasing elsewhere. We thus derive the global representation of aliasing functions based on the solid mathematical analysis. Using the global representation, we propose the Direction-adaptive Perspective Shadow Maps (DirPSMs) to offer enhanced shadow rendering in real-time applications. Shadows are essential for the realism of computer-generated images, which dramatically enhance our perception of virtual scenes by providing useful visual hints. Even tremendous advances in graphics rendering algorithms and programmable GPUs have made real-time and photo-realistic rendering a reality, the synthesis of realistic shadowing effects is still challenging and computationally intensive. Shadow mapping {{is one of the}} most popular algorithms for real-time shadow rendering, which has been extensively adopted in real-time applications by its generality and efficiency. However, shadow mapping suffers from the inherent aliasing problems such as <b>jagged</b> shadow <b>boundaries</b> and incorrect self-shadowing due to the image-based nature. In this thesis, we present several shadow rendering techniques to render anti-aliased shadows via shadow mapping especially for large-scale and dynamic scenes. The Parallel-Split Shadow Maps (PSSMs) scheme is first proposed for realistic and real-time shadow rendering towards next generation of three-dimensional computer games. This scheme splits the view frustum into multiple parts using clip planes parallel to the view plane, and then generates multiple smaller shadow maps for the split parts. A fast and robust split strategy based on the analysis of shadow map aliasing is developed, to produce a moderate aliasing distribution over the whole depth range. Hardware-specific accelerations are also implemented and tested to remove the extra rendering passes caused by using multiple shadow maps. These techniques are intuitive to implement without using complex data structures. They are designed to improve both quality and performance of shadow rendering in large-scale and dynamic scenes. With the observation that the sampling density at the light in the post-perspective space better accommodates the requirements for the reconstruction of shadowed images, perspective reparameterization techniques warp shadow maps using the perspective transform to reduce aliasing errors for the objects near the viewer. One limitation in this line of research is that the approximated representation of aliasing errors is only valid for the ideal case in which the light and view directions are orthogonal. We thus establish the generalized perspective reparameterization functions to adaptively adjust the warping strength as the light and/or viewer moves. With the direction-dependent representations of aliasing errors, we subsequently develop three enhanced perspective reparameterizations to better handle general cases, including Generalized Linear Perspective Reparameterization (GLPR), Generalized Minimum-Norm Perspective Reparameterization (GMNPR) and Focus-preserving Trapezoidal Shadow Maps (FTSMs).

40|$|Flux {{reversal}} in Ni-Fe thin films {{has been studied}} {{with the use of}} 10 nsec exposure time Kerr magneto-optic photographs which depict the dynamic magnetization configuration with 10 µ resolution during the reversal process. The photographs show that at least five mechanisms are involved in the reversal of thin films: (1) domain wall motion, (2) coherent rotation, (3) diffuse boundary propagation, (4) nucleation and subsequent reversal of partially reversed regions, and (5) noncoherent rotation. The present investigation has been concerned mainly with the latter three mechanisms as they have either been previously unreported or poorly understood. Non-coherent rotation is a complex rotational reversal process wherein the rate of the magnetization rotation varies over the surface of the magnetic film. It occurs only when transverse fields are applied. The Kerr magneto-optic photographs show that initially there is a fast relaxation of the ripple and a coherent rotation of the magnetization during the risetime of the pulse field, followed by a breakup of the configuration after the field exceeds the Stoner-Wohlfarth threshold. With fields just exceeding the Stoner-Wohlfarth threshold, after the stripes form, regions of reversed magnetization nucleate throughout the stripes and complete the reversal process. With larger applied fields, the reversal is completed by the slow (as compared to coherent rotation) rotation of the magnetization which is accompanied by a gradual decrease in amplitude of the stripes. The angle at which the stripes form is dependent on the applied field and varies from film to film, but indicates that the magnetization rotates coherently to angles significantly greater (5 ° to 20 °) than the critical angle for reversal. The previously proposed fast relaxation models of Stein and Harte both predict that the coherent rotation should cease before the critical angle and therefore do not agree with the data. A model, based on ripple theory, has been constructed to show that after the magnetization rotates past the critical angle, an instability should occur in the ripple and cause a striped configuration at the observed angles. The nucleation and subsequent reversal of partially reversed regions is a reversal process occuring predominantly with zero or small transverse fields. During this process the magnetization reverses in small (0. 01 mm^ 2) regions of the film sequentially in time. With zero transverse field, the nucleation occurs with longitudinal fields exceeding a well defined nucleation threshold (>H_k) to fields greater than 2 H_k. Anisotropy dispersion and magnetostatic stray fields are believed to be important in the nucleation process. Diffuse boundary propagation involves a poorly defined, <b>jagged,</b> and diffuse <b>boundary</b> separating regions of anti-parallel magnetization. With zero transverse field the boundary lies transverse to the easy axis and propagates in the longitudinal direction [...] just the opposite of domain wall motion. When a transverse field is applied, the boundary propagates rapidly from diffuse tips pointing {{in the direction of the}} stripes which are observed during non-coherent rotation. The boundary velocity varies roughly as the fifth power of the field and ranges from 0. 033 cm/µsec at fields near H_c to 1. 25 cm/µsec at 1. 3 H_k which is one to three order of magnitude faster than domain wall motion. The high velocity is in part attributed to the large width of the boundary which widens from 0. 2 mm to 2 mm as the field is increased. Photographs taken when the drive field is terminated before saturation of the magnetic film show that the magnetization configuration continues to change for more than 200 nsec in the absence of an applied field. The diffuse boundaries become more sharply defined, though still quite jagged, and are found to change structure and propagate more slowly during subsequent pulses. Many of the partially reversed nucleated regions revert to the non-reversed state when the field is terminated. The striped partially rotated magnetization of the noncoherent rotation process, depending on the direction of the magnetization and the magnitude of the magnetostatic fields arising from the stripes, either relaxes to the non-reversed state or continues to reverse. Usually the static state shows no evidence of the stripes, and those which are observed are broken up by nucleated regions and frequently lie at different angles than the dynamic stripes. The large changes which occur after the field is terminated show that it is misleading to try to infer the dynamic state from the final static state as has been previously done. The long relaxation time is attributed to the sequential nature of the relaxation process. </p...|$|R
