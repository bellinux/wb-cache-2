25|$|Marcus {{had much}} {{love and respect}} for his adoptive father. The tribute he gives Pius in the first book of the Meditations is the longest of any. He would have more {{influence}} on the young Marcus than any other person.From my father: gentleness and unshaken resolution in judgments taken after full examination; no vainglory about external honours; love of work and perseverance; readiness to <b>hear</b> <b>those</b> who had anything {{to contribute to the}} public advantage; the desire to reward every man according to his desert without partiality; the experience that knew where to tighten the reign, where to relax. Prohibition of unnatural practices, social tact and permission to his suite not invariably to be present at his banquets nor to attend his progress from Rome, as a matter of obligation, and always to be found the same by those who had failed to attend him through engagements. Exact scrutiny in council and patience; not that he was avoiding investigation, satisfied with first impressions. An inclination to keep his friends, and nowhere fastidious or the victim of manias but his own master in everything, and his outward mien cheerful. His long foresight and ordering of the merest trifle without making scenes. The check in his reign put upon organized applause and every form of lip-service; his unceasing watch over the needs of the empire and his stewardship of its resources; his patience under criticism by individuals of such conduct. No superstitious fear of divine powers nor with man any courting of the public or obsequiousness or cultivation of popular favour, but temperance in all things and firmness; nowhere want of taste or search for novelty.|$|E
500|$|Mars {{said of the}} song, [...] "It took me {{months to}} come up with 'Just the Way You Are'... I wasn't {{thinking}} of anything deep or poetic. I was telling a story. Get ready to fall in love!" [...] He added, [...] "I'm a big fan of songs like Joe Cocker's 'You Are So Beautiful' and Eric Clapton's 'Wonderful Tonight' - songs that go straight to the point. You know, there's no mind-boggling lyrics or twists in the story - they just come directly from the heart. And to me 'Just The Way You Are' is one of those songs. There's nothing mind-blowing about it. I'm just telling a woman she looks beautiful the way she IS - and, let's be honest, what woman doesn't wanna <b>hear</b> <b>those</b> lyrics?!" ...|$|E
500|$|Steinman rejoined Meat Loaf and {{the band}} for a live {{performance}} in Toronto, Ontario, Canada in 1978 {{with the intention of}} going through the songs for Bat II after the show. However, someone broke into their dressing rooms during the show and stole several possessions, including the new lyric book. Then, Meat Loaf lost his voice and was unable to record Renegade Angel. Steinman says [...] "he sounded literally like the little girl in The Exorcist... like a dragon trying to sing—it was a horrifying sound." [...] Steinman [...] "kept writing the music to Bat Out of Hell part 2... my sequel." [...] Not being able to [...] "bear for people not to <b>hear</b> <b>those</b> songs," [...] Steinman recorded the album, retitled Bad for Good, as a solo project, although Rory Dodd contributed lead vocals on some songs. Four songs from Bad for Good were included on Bat Out of Hell II. In 1989, Steinman formed all-female vocal group Pandora's Box. The album, Original Sin, was a commercial flop, but featured two songs which would also appear on Bat II. Meat Loaf says [...] "Jim put [...] "It Just Won't Quit" [...] on Original Sin without telling me. I could have strangled him." ...|$|E

I used to <b>hear</b> <b>those</b> {{wonderful}} {{stories in the}} cutting room that Tom and Dick and Stuart would tell about Superman and that's how I kind of got the ideas for the plots of 'Taking Flight' and 'Making Superman'". Donner commented, [...] "There are a few shots where Chris 's costume looked green. We went in and cleaned that up, bringing the color {{back to where it}} should be." [...] Thau wanted to make the film shorter: [...] "I wanted to take out the damn poem where Lois is reciting a poem [...] when they're flying around. I also wanted to take out a lot of that car chase where it was just generic action… It was like a two-minute car chase. But Dick didn't want to take [...] out [...] the poem." [...] It was followed by a box set release in the same month, containing [...] "bare bones" [...] editions of Superman II, Superman III, and Superman IV: The Quest for Peace. In November 2006, a four-disc special edition was released, followed by an HD DVD release and Blu-ray.

2500|$|In 2000, {{journalist}} Brian Doherty, {{noting that}} political song lyrics are often either misunderstood or not understood {{at all by}} fans, wrote, [...] "But who's to say Reagan wasn't right to insist the song was an upper?

2500|$|Jazz critic Scott Yanow regards Marsalis as talented but {{has criticized}} his [...] "selective {{knowledge}} of jazz history" [...] and {{has said that}} he feels the fact that Marsalis considers [...] "post-1965 avant-garde playing to be outside of jazz and 1970s fusion to be barren" [...] to be the unfortunate result of the [...] "somewhat eccentric beliefs of Stanley Crouch". Bassist Stanley Clarke said [...] "All the guys that are criticizing—like Wynton Marsalis and those guys—I would hate to be around to <b>hear</b> <b>those</b> guys playing on top of a groove!" [...] But Clarke also said, [...] "These things I've said about Wynton are my criticism of him, but the positive things I have to say about him outweigh the negative.

2500|$|For most {{of these}} cases, the {{jurisdiction}} of the federal district courts is concurrent with that of the state courts. [...] In other words, a plaintiff can choose to bring these cases in either a federal district court or a state court. [...] Congress has established a procedure whereby a party, typically the defendant, can [...] "remove" [...] a case from state court to federal court, provided that the federal court also has original jurisdiction over the matter (meaning that the case could have been filed in federal court initially). [...] If the party that initially filed the case in state court believes that removal was improper, that party can ask the district court to [...] "remand" [...] the case to the state court system. [...] For certain matters, such as patent and copyright infringement disputes and prosecutions for federal crimes, {{the jurisdiction of the}} district courts is exclusive of that of the state courts, meaning that only federal courts can <b>hear</b> <b>those</b> cases.|$|E
2500|$|At four, Seeger {{was sent}} away to {{boarding}} school but came home two years later when his parents learned the school had failed to inform them he had contracted scarlet fever. He attended first and second grades in Nyack, New York, where his mother lived, before entering boarding school in Ridgefield, Connecticut. Despite being classical musicians, his parents did not press him to play an instrument. On his own, the otherwise bookish and withdrawn boy gravitated to the ukulele, becoming adept at entertaining his classmates with it while laying the basis for his subsequent remarkable audience rapport. At thirteen, Seeger enrolled in the Avon Old Farms School in Avon, Connecticut, from which he graduated in 1936. He was selected to attend Camp Rising Sun, the George E. Jonas Foundation's international summer leadership program. During the summer of 1936, while traveling {{with his father and}} stepmother, Pete heard the five-string banjo {{for the first time at}} the Mountain Dance and Folk Festival in western North Carolina near Asheville, organized by local folklorist, lecturer, and traditional music performer Bascom Lamar Lunsford, whom Charles Seeger had hired for Farm Resettlement music projects. The festival took place in a covered baseball field. There the Seegers:watched square-dance teams from Bear Wallow, Happy Hollow, Cane Creek, Spooks Branch, Cheoah Valley, Bull Creek, and Soco Gap; heard the five-string banjo player Samantha Bumgarner; and family string bands, including a group of Indians from the Cherokee reservation who played string instruments and sang ballads. They wandered among the crowds who camped out at the edge of the field, hearing music being made there as well. As Lunsford's daughter would later recall, those country people [...] "held the riches that Dad had discovered. They could sing, fiddle, pick the banjos, and guitars with traditional grace and style found nowhere else but deep in the mountains. I can still <b>hear</b> <b>those</b> haunting melodies drift over the ball park." [...] For the Seegers, experiencing the beauty of this music firsthand was a [...] "conversion experience". Pete was deeply affected and, after learning basic strokes from Lunsford, spent much of the next four years trying to master the five-string banjo. The teenage Seeger also sometimes accompanied his parents to regular Saturday evening gatherings at the Greenwich Village loft of painter and art teacher Thomas Hart Benton and his wife Rita. Benton, a lover of Americana, played [...] "Cindy" [...] and [...] "Old Joe Clark" [...] with his students Charlie and Jackson Pollock; friends from the [...] "hillbilly" [...] recording industry; as well as avant-garde composers Carl Ruggles and Henry Cowell. It was at one of Benton's parties that Pete heard [...] "John Henry" [...] for the first time.|$|E
