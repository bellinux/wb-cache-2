50|$|In {{the example}} of <b>holding</b> <b>rods</b> outstretched, the {{original}} experiment had subjects evaluate the width of apertures (intended to simulate doorways), then show this width on a ruler held by experimenters. The width was evaluated as narrower by those <b>holding</b> <b>rods</b> {{than those who were}} not. When Firestone and Scholl repeated this experiment, substituting rulers for a separate aperture that was adjusted by experimenters to the subjects instruction, the aperture was still evaluated as narrower. This narrowing effect was later implied to be a demand characteristic after another group was told that their <b>holding</b> a <b>rod</b> was an evaluation of balance abilities.|$|R
50|$|Chaz Firestone and Brian Scholl have {{alleged that}} this fallacy {{has been the}} cause for mistaken {{thinking}} in perception research, including in studies that presumed to show that wearing a heavy backpack makes hills literally appear steeper, or <b>holding</b> <b>rods</b> outstretched horizontally would make doorways look narrower.|$|R
40|$|Two clamps <b>hold</b> <b>rod</b> in fixed {{extension}} from cylinder {{even when}} power is off, converting actuator into stiff structural member. Locked actuator is useful as mechanical support or linkage or as fail-safe device {{in case of}} loss of hydraulic pressure. Potential applications include manufacturing processes and specialized handling and holding devices...|$|R

The panels shows three angels, a seated figure holding something unintelligible, and two other figures, one of {{which appears to be}} un-draped, <b>holding</b> <b>rods.</b> MacAlister proposed that this panel may represent the Scourging of Christ, but he was not satisfied with his guess.|$|R

Although it was predicted that at least one was risking his or her own life, no one died, and the Legion contingent returned to the 31st Century.|$|R
5000|$|In total, 25 km of {{cross-country}} ski runs {{have been}} laid, with winter hiking paths beside them. On the lake, areas for ice skating and curling are kept free of snow.

Holding the perca arsmatia (ritual staff) and the cringatro the arsfertur lights the fire then with the two assistants (prinovatus), who <b>hold</b> <b>rods</b> of pomegranate wood, marches with the victims along the Augural Way to the district of Acedonia. Proclamation is made expelling the alien enemies. The Iguvines are ordered to form in companies. The arsfertur and the assistants march about them thrice with the victims and the fire. At the end a prayer is made invoking misfortune upon the aliens and blessings upon the Iguvinians.|$|R

One of the women is <b>holding</b> up a <b>rod</b> with a fish hanging at the end of the string. Every person seems to be <b>holding</b> a fishing <b>rod</b> which creates a row of these over the edge of the boat.

25|$|There are two independent, {{fast-acting}} safety {{shutdown systems}} as well. Shutoff rods are held above the reactor by electromagnets, and drop under gravity {{into the core}} to quickly end criticality. This system works even {{in the event of}} a complete power failure, as the electromagnets only <b>hold</b> the <b>rods</b> out of the reactor when power is available. A secondary system injects a high-pressure gadolinium nitrate neutron absorber solution into the calandria.|$|R
