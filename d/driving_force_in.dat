5|$|Due to {{both the}} {{technological}} gap between civilisations and the centuries-long colonial era, Portugal was a <b>driving</b> <b>force</b> <b>in</b> the development and shaping of all Portuguese Africa since the 15th century. In the 1960s and early 1970s, to counter the increasing insurgency of FRELIMO forces and show to the Portuguese people and {{the world that the}} territory was totally under control, the Portuguese government accelerated its major development program to expand and upgrade the infrastructure of Portuguese Mozambique by creating new roads, railways, bridges, dams, irrigation systems, schools and hospitals to stimulate an even higher level of economic growth and support from the populace.|$|E
5|$|Postan {{argued that}} {{demography}} {{was the principal}} <b>driving</b> <b>force</b> <b>in</b> the medieval English economy. In a distinctly Malthusian fashion, Postan proposed that the English agrarian economy saw little technical development during the period and by the early 14th century was unable to support the growing population, leading to inevitable famines and economic depression as the population came back into balance with land resources. Postan began the trend towards stressing continuities between the pre- and post-invasion economies, aided by fresh evidence emerging {{from the use of}} archaeological techniques to understand the medieval economy from the 1950s onwards.|$|E

In March 2005, the Recording Industry Association of America {{certified}} the album double Platinum, selling five million copies worldwide. The Documentary received generally positive reviews, with critics praising the album's production. Since the album's release, The Game was credited as a <b>driving</b> <b>force</b> <b>in</b> reviving the West Coast hip hop scene that has been overshadowed by artists from the East, Midwest and South. The record remains as The Game's best-selling album to date. On June 16, 2014, the sequel to the album was announced, called The Documentary 2, which was released on October 9, 2015, followed by the release of The Documentary 2.5.|$|E

40|$|Background: The markets {{conditions}} are changing and recent research {{show that the}} era of offshoring manufacturing and jobs to foreign countries now {{is coming to an}} end. Nearshoring gives the possibility to overcome the challenges that offshoring causes. Furthermore, both the internal parameters and key <b>driving</b> <b>forces</b> <b>in</b> the environment is important to consider in the decision of where to locate the future supplier base. Purpose: The purpose for this thesis is to identify how the future supplier base for the glass lighting segment should be located, taken into consideration the internal parameters availability, sustainability, product quality and cost, and the key <b>driving</b> <b>forces</b> <b>in</b> the environment. Methodology: In this thesis a case study approach is used, with a positivistic perspective and an abductive approach. To identify the key <b>driving</b> <b>forces,</b> the methodology of a scenario analysis is used. Conclusions: Considering the internal parameters and the key <b>driving</b> <b>forces</b> <b>in</b> the environment a use of three nearshoring hubs, closely located to the sales markets, Asia, Europe and North America, is supported for the future supplier base for the glass lighting segment. ...|$|R
5|$|Henry's empire quickly {{collapsed}} {{during the}} reign of his youngest son John. Many of the changes Henry introduced during his long rule, however, had long-term consequences. Henry's legal changes are generally considered to have laid the basis for the English Common Law, while his intervention in Brittany, Wales and Scotland shaped the development of their societies and governmental systems. Historical interpretations of Henry's reign have changed considerably over time. In the 18th century, scholars argued that Henry was a <b>driving</b> <b>force</b> <b>in</b> the creation of a genuinely English monarchy and, ultimately, a unified Britain. During the Victorian expansion of the British Empire, historians were keenly interested in the formation of Henry's own empire, but they also expressed concern over his private life and treatment of Becket. Late-20th-century historians have combined British and French historical accounts of Henry, challenging earlier Anglo-centric interpretations of his reign.|$|E
5|$|In 2006, the {{sustained}} rise {{in oil prices}} had only a limited impact on demand. It was a good year across all segments of the tanker market segments, but {{not as good as}} 2004 and 2005. Amidst high oil prices, geopolitical tension, and fears of disruptions to the oil supply, growing demand was the main <b>driving</b> <b>force</b> <b>in</b> the tanker shipping market for the year. As demand grew moderately in the United States and Western Europe, expanding economies such as China fueled exponential growth in demand. Despite these strengths, each of the five tanker freight indices dropped during 2006. Product tanker demand increased in 2006 due to economic expansion in Asia, especially China and India, however, average time charter equivalent earnings for these ships decreased compared with the two prior years.|$|E
5|$|Born in Newport, Delaware, Evans {{received}} little formal education {{and in his}} mid-teens was apprenticed to a wheelwright. Going into business with his brothers, he worked {{for over a decade}} designing, building and perfecting an automated mill with devices such as bucket chains and conveyor belts. In doing so Evans designed a continuous process of manufacturing that required no human labor. This novel concept would prove critical to the Industrial Revolution and the development of mass production. Later in life Evans turned his attention to steam power, and built the first high-pressure steam engine in the United States in 1801, developing his design independently of Richard Trevithick, who built the first in the world a year earlier. Evans was a <b>driving</b> <b>force</b> <b>in</b> the development and adoption of high-pressure steam engines in the United States. Evans dreamed of building a steam-powered wagon and would eventually construct and run one in 1805. Known as the Oruktor Amphibolos, it was the first automobile in the country and the world's first amphibious vehicle, although it was too primitive to be a success as either.|$|E

5|$|The {{difference}} in gene frequencies between the original population and colony may also trigger {{the two groups}} to diverge significantly {{over the course of}} many generations. As the difference, or genetic distance, increases, the two separated populations may become distinct, both genetically and phenetically, although not only genetic drift but also natural selection, gene flow, and mutation contribute to this divergence. This potential for relatively rapid changes in the colony's gene frequency led most scientists to consider the founder effect (and by extension, genetic drift) a significant <b>driving</b> <b>force</b> <b>in</b> the evolution of new species. Sewall Wright was the first to attach this significance to random drift and small, newly isolated populations with his shifting balance theory of speciation. Following after Wright, Ernst Mayr created many persuasive models to show that the decline in genetic variation and small population size following the founder effect were critically important for new species to develop. However, there is much less support for this view today since the hypothesis has been tested repeatedly through experimental research and the results have been equivocal at best.|$|E

The analysis includes: (1) a classification of agricultural systems based on pesticide use intensity and safety, (2) {{an evaluation of the}} profitability of farming systems and identification of socio-economic factors that influence pesticide use and (3) formulation of policy recommendations. We find that for cereals and for fruit trees alike, crop yields are much higher for agricultural systems with high doses of pesticides. The safety of applied pesticides does not affect crop protection costs significantly. For cropping systems characterised by low-intensity in pesticide use, the application of safer products has a positive effect on reduction of crop protection costs. pesticide use, <b>driving</b> <b>forces</b> <b>in</b> crop protection, economic {{analysis of}} agricultural systems, Crop Production/Industries,...|$|R
