5|$|During {{the course}} of its investigation, the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) {{discovered}} that tower staffing levels at Blue Grass Airport violated an internal policy as reflected in a November 16, 2005, memorandum requiring two controllers during the overnight shift: one <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>tower</b> working clearance, ground, and tower frequencies, and another, either <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>tower</b> or remotely at Indianapolis Center, working TRACON (radar). At {{the time of the}} accident, the single controller <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>tower</b> was performing both tower and radar duties. On August 30, 2006, the FAA announced that Lexington, as well as other airports with similar traffic levels, would be staffed with two controllers <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>tower</b> around the clock effective immediately.|$|E
5|$|A {{wider variety}} of {{patterns}} were used from the 11thcentury. Abstract 6- and 8-point shapes appear <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Tower</b> of Kharaqan at Qazvin, Persia in 1067, and the Al-Juyushi Mosque, Egypt in 1085, again becoming widespread from there, though 6-point patterns are rare in Turkey.|$|E
5|$|Ambrose Dudley {{was imprisoned}} <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Tower</b> of London {{with his father}} and his four brothers. All were attainted and {{condemned}} to death, but only the Duke and Guildford Dudley, the second youngest brother, were executed. After the natural death of John, the eldest brother, in October 1554, Ambrose Dudley was the family's heir; he remained longest <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Tower,</b> being released late in 1554 after a plea by his wife, Lady Tailboys. On the whole, the brothers' release was brought about by their mother and their brother-in-law Henry Sidney, who successfully lobbied the Spanish nobles around England's new co-ruler and king consort, Philip of Spain. Out of prison, in December 1554 or January 1555, Ambrose and Robert Dudley took part in one of several tournaments held by Philip to celebrate Anglo-Spanish friendship.|$|E

5|$|Among those {{held and}} {{executed}} at the Tower was Anne Boleyn. Although the Yeoman Warders were once the Royal Bodyguard, by the 16th and 17thcenturies their main duty had become {{to look after}} the prisoners. The Tower was often a safer place than other prisons in London such as the Fleet, where disease was rife. High-status prisoners could live in conditions comparable to those they might expect outside; one such example was that while Walter Raleigh was held <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Tower</b> his rooms were altered to accommodate his family, including his son who was born there in 1605. Executions were usually carried out on Tower Hill rather than <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Tower</b> of London itself, and 112people were executed on the hill over 400years. Before the 20thcentury, there had been seven executions within the castle on Tower Green; {{as was the case with}} Lady Jane Grey, this was reserved for prisoners for whom public execution was considered dangerous. After Lady Jane Grey's execution on 12 February 1554, Queen MaryI imprisoned her sister Elizabeth, later Queen ElizabethI, <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Tower</b> under suspicion of causing rebellion as Sir Thomas Wyatt had led a revolt against Mary in Elizabeth's name.|$|E
5|$|Except for Æsthetic Club meetings, the Tower Building {{remained}} largely unoccupied for almost fifty years and suffered significant deterioration.

5|$|He {{was imprisoned}} <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Tower</b> of London, attainted, and {{condemned}} to death, as were {{his father and}} four brothers. His father went to the scaffold. <b>In</b> <b>the</b> <b>Tower,</b> Dudley's stay coincided with the imprisonment of his childhood friend, Mary's half-sister Elizabeth, who was sent there on suspicion of involvement in Wyatt's rebellion. Guildford Dudley was executed in February 1554. The surviving brothers were released in the autumn; working for their release, their mother (who died in January 1555) and their brother-in-law, Henry Sidney, had befriended the incoming Spanish nobles around Philip of Spain, Mary's husband.|$|E

50|$|Fire Department chiefs issued {{orders for}} the firefighters to evacuate. However, the order was issued over the radios that were not working <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>towers,</b> thus, <b>the</b> 343 firefighters inside <b>the</b> Twin <b>Towers</b> could not hear the {{evacuation}} order. They remained <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>towers</b> as <b>the</b> <b>towers</b> collapsed. However, when Giuliani testified before the 9/11 Commission {{he said that the}} firefighters ignored the evacuation order out of an effort to save lives.|$|R

5|$|A 2-octave Schulmerich {{electronic}} carillon {{of twenty-five}} bells was installed <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>tower</b> in June 1958. It was played from the organ console by a carillonneur on Sunday mornings {{before and after}} services, {{as well as on}} special occasions, such as Christmas Eve and as part of the traditional noontime nationwide peal of church bells on the Fourth of July. Hymns were also played daily on the carillon by a music roll until it was discontinued in the 1990s.|$|E
5|$|After {{the initial}} {{success of the}} Shakespeare Gallery, many wanted to take credit. Henry Fuseli long claimed that his planned Shakespeare ceiling (in {{imitation}} of the Sistine Chapel ceiling) had given Boydell {{the idea for the}} gallery. James Northcote claimed that his Death of Wat Tyler and Murder of the Princes <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Tower</b> had motivated Boydell to start the project. However, according to Winifred Friedman, who has researched the Boydell Gallery, it was probably Joshua Reynolds's Royal Academy lectures on the superiority of history painting that influenced Boydell the most.|$|E

5|$|As {{a result}} of the heavy security, {{businesses}} around the tower had seen decreased patronage due to less foot traffic around the heavily secured area. Protests around the tower subsided after his inauguration in January 2017, and by summer 2017, the security measures around the tower had been loosened somewhat, owing to the fact that most security measures were implemented only when Trump was actually <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>tower.</b> However, several businesses at the tower's base had closed by then because of a {{reduction in the number of}} customers.|$|E
5|$|Berrios {{was born}} on February 14, 1952, the oldest of seven children. His parents were Puerto Rican natives. When he was six, his family moved into the Cabrini-Green public housing high-rises.

5|$|By the 19th century, {{the tower}} was {{obscured}} by the surrounding buildings, and was accessed through the brick-built office in front of it, according to the antiquarian and engraver John Smith.

5|$|Charles's {{opposition}} to the Exclusion Bill angered some Protestants. Protestant conspirators formulated the Rye House Plot, a plan to murder him and the Duke of York as they returned to London after horse races in Newmarket. A great fire, however, destroyed Charles's lodgings at Newmarket, which forced {{him to leave the}} races early, thus, inadvertently, avoiding the planned attack. News of the failed plot was leaked. Protestant politicians such as Arthur Capell, 1st Earl of Essex, Algernon Sydney, Lord William Russell and the Duke of Monmouth were implicated in the plot. Lord Essex slit his own throat while imprisoned <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Tower</b> of London; Sydney and Russell were executed for high treason on very flimsy evidence; and the Duke of Monmouth went into exile at the court of William of Orange. Lord Danby and the surviving Catholic lords held <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Tower</b> were released and the king's Catholic brother, James, acquired greater influence at court. Titus Oates was convicted and imprisoned for defamation.|$|E
5|$|Exeter {{had been}} {{stripped}} of his armour and left for dead on the battlefield at Barnet, but he was alive—though gravely injured.

Exeter did not participate in the later battles of the Wars of the Roses. Edward sent him on a Yorkist expedition to France in 1475, and the duke was reported to have fallen overboard and drowned without any witnesses.|$|E
5|$|Few of the {{original}} windows survive <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>tower,</b> but those that remain are larger than {{in some of the}} other older peles, suggesting it may have been built with defence less in mind than in some earlier pele towers. The originals have mainly been replaced by 17th- and 18th-century versions. The original roof would have resembled that at nearby Yanwath Hall, but was replaced at a later date with the current hipped-roof design, probably during the late 16th or 17th centuries. The current roof was further restored in 1979.|$|E

5|$|Isolated {{inside the}} Tower, the royal {{government}} {{was in a}} state of shock at the turn of events.
