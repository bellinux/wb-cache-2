25|$|Teleoperated robots, or telerobots, are devices {{remotely}} operated {{from a distance}} by a human operator rather than following a predetermined sequence of movements, but which has semi-autonomous behaviour. They are used when a human cannot be present on site to perform a job because it is dangerous, far away, or inaccessible. The robot may be in another room or another country, or may be on a very different scale to the operator. For instance, a laparoscopic surgery robot allows the surgeon to work inside a human patient on a relatively small scale compared to open surgery, significantly shortening recovery time. They {{can also be used}} to avoid exposing workers to the hazardous and tight spaces such as <b>in</b> <b>duct</b> cleaning. When disabling a bomb, the operator sends a small robot to disable it. Several authors have been using a device called the Longpen to sign books remotely. Teleoperated robot aircraft, like the Predator Unmanned Aerial Vehicle, are increasingly being used by the military. These pilotless drones can search terrain and fire on targets. Hundreds of robots such as iRobot's Packbot and the Foster-Miller TALON are being used in Iraq and Afghanistan by the U.S. military to defuse roadside bombs or improvised explosive devices (IEDs) in an activity known as explosive ordnance disposal (EOD).|$|E

At the end of the film, JTRO takes BTRO's outfit, which required Trost to readjust it for the height difference between Jason Trost and Brandon Barrera, who portray JTRO and BTRO, respectively.

Measurements from a high resolution SODAR are used to show the complex structure and characteristics of elevated ducts. The ducts are shown to have very strong temperature gradients and to form in substantially the same range over long periods.

40|$|Noise {{transmission}} problems where sound propagates <b>in</b> flow <b>ducts</b> occur <b>in</b> {{a variety}} of contexts. The work in this paper is motivated by the turbofan aircraft engine application. Simulating the acoustics of turbofan duct systems is a challenging problem because this can necessitate the modelling of high-frequency sound propagation <b>in</b> <b>ducts</b> containing sheared mean flow and with acoustically-lined walls. The purpose of this work is to develop fast and efficient simulation methods, {{that can be used}} to calculate the propagation of sound <b>in</b> lined flow <b>ducts.</b> <b>In</b> this paper, preliminary results are presented obtained from a new finite element code which has been developed specifically to determine the pressure modes <b>in</b> <b>ducts</b> containing shear flow. The formulation of the finite element method is outlined. Preliminary results are shown which compare the duct modes with different boundary layer profiles.

40|$|<b>In</b> {{ventilation}} <b>duct</b> flow {{the turbulent}} flow profile is commonly disturbed or not fully developed and these conditions {{are likely to}} influence particle deposition to duct surfaces. Particle deposition rates at eight S-connectors, in two 90 {sup o} <b>duct</b> bends and <b>in</b> two <b>ducts</b> where the turbulent flow profile was not fully developed were measured <b>in</b> a laboratory <b>duct</b> system with both galvanized steel and internally insulated ducts with hydraulic diameters of 15. 2 cm. <b>In</b> the steel <b>duct</b> system, experiments with nominal particle diameters of 1, 3, 5, 9 and 16 {micro}m were conducted at each of three nominal air speeds: 2. 2, 5. 3 and 9. 0 m/s. <b>In</b> the insulated <b>duct</b> system, deposition of particles with nominal diameters of 1, 3, 5, 8 and 13 {micro}m was measured at nominal air speeds of 2. 2, 5. 3 and 8. 8 m/s. Fluorescent techniques were used to directly measure the deposition velocities of monodisperse fluorescent particles to duct surfaces. Deposition at S-connectors, in bends and <b>in</b> straight <b>ducts</b> with developing turbulence was often greater than deposition <b>in</b> straight <b>ducts</b> with fully developed turbulence for equal particle sizes, air speeds and duct surface orientations.

High deposition rates at S-connectors resulted from impaction and these rates were nearly independent of the orientation of the S-connector. Deposition rates in the two 90 {sup o} bends differed by more than an order of magnitude in some cases, probably because of the difference in turbulence conditions at the bend inlets. <b>In</b> straight steel <b>ducts</b> where the turbulent flow profile was developing, the deposition enhancement relative to fully developed turbulence generally increased with air speed and decreased with downstream distance from the duct inlet.
