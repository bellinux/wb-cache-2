40|$|Poor <b>insight</b> is {{associated}} with impaired cognitive function in psychosis. Whether poor clinical <b>insight</b> overlaps with other aspects of self-awareness in schizophrenia, such as cognitive self-awareness, is unclear. We investigated whether awareness of clinical state (?clinical <b>insight?)</b> and awareness of cognitive deficits (?cognitive <b>insight?)</b> overlap in schizophrenia {{in a sample of}} 51 stabilized patients with chronic schizophrenia. Cognitive <b>insight</b> was assessed in terms of the agreement between subjective self-report and neuropsychological assessment. Patients who show good cognitive <b>insight</b> did not necessarily show good clinical <b>insight.</b> By contrast, self-report and objective neuropsychological assessment only correlated for patients in the intact clinical <b>insight</b> group and not for those in the impairment clinical <b>insight</b> group. We conclude that while good cognitive <b>insight</b> may not be necessary for good clinical <b>insight,</b> good cognitive awareness is at least partly reliant on the processes involved in clinical <b>insight...</b>|$|R
40|$|Rather than {{duplicating}} {{biomedical research}} measuring <b>insight,</b> or suggesting models by which one could more reliably measure {{a person with}} dementia's <b>insight,</b> I turn {{to the notion of}} <b>insight</b> reflexively. Based on ethnographic research with four `intimate circles of care', I explore the consciousness of people with AIDS dementia's <b>insight,</b> the intentionality of <b>insight</b> in the phenomenological sense. Since <b>insight</b> is a capacity of all humans, I also include in my unit of analysis the meanings of <b>insight</b> for significant others. With intentionality, what matters most are the meanings made of and the positions taken towards <b>insight.</b> I do not address what we understand philosophically as knowledge or question the definitions of awareness or <b>insight.</b> I focus on the ethnographic description of the meanings and positions that informants had of <b>insight.</b> Intentionality is not necessarily truth or fact, but rather a position taken. From the meanings and positions taken by informants, four themes of the intentionality of <b>insight</b> emerged: <b>insight</b> as heart-wrenching; agency, control and purpose; the hope of losing insight; and <b>insight</b> as life-giving. Intentionality of <b>insight</b> emerged in relation to intimacy, emotions and relationships. <b>Insight</b> was experienced within and narrated through a liminal state...|$|R
40|$|Research on the {{relationship}} between <b>insight</b> and social cognition, in particular Theory of Mind (ToM), in schizophrenia has yielded mixed findings to date. Very few studies, however, have assessed both clinical <b>insight</b> and cognitive <b>insight</b> when examining their relationships with ToM in schizophrenia. The current study thus investigated {{the relationship}} between clinical <b>insight,</b> cognitive <b>insight,</b> and ToM in a sample of 56 patients with schizophrenia and 30 healthy controls. Twenty-seven patients were classified as low in clinical <b>insight</b> according to their scores on the &# 39;insight&# 39; item (G 12) of the Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS). Moreover, cognitive <b>insight</b> and ToM were assessed with the Beck Cognitive <b>Insight</b> Scale (BCIS) and the Yoni task, respectively. The results indicated that patients with poor clinical <b>insight</b> performed worse on taslcs of second-order cognitive and affective ToM, while the ToM performance of patients with high clinical <b>insight</b> was equivalent to that of healthy controls. Furthermore, while clinical <b>insight</b> was correlated with ToM and clinical symptoms, cognitive <b>insight</b> did not correlate with clinical <b>insight,</b> ToM, or clinical symptoms. Clinical <b>insight</b> thus appears to be an important factor related to ToM in schizophrenia. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved...|$|R

40|$|<b>Insight</b> in {{psychosis}} is a multi-dimensional phenomenon, and {{has been}} hypothesised {{to have some sort}} of neuropsychological basis. It is unclear to what extent specific neuropsychological abilities are able to predict <b>insight</b> beyond the effect of generalised cognitive ability. We aimed to test this, alongside the relationship of <b>insight</b> with illness duration and diagnosis, in a sample of first episode psychosis patients. We recruited 102 patients experiencing their first episode of psychosis and assessed their <b>insight,</b> symptoms, diagnosis as well as administering a full neuropsychological battery. Low <b>insight</b> was related to worse performance in a variety of neuropsychological tasks. Regression analysis tested whether any specific tasks were related to <b>insight</b> (or dimensions of <b>insight)</b> beyond the effect of IQ. Verbal memory had an effect on total <b>insight</b> and all dimensions of <b>insight</b> (except compliance) beyond the effect of IQ. <b>Insight</b> appeared to vary with diagnosis, with those diagnosed with depressive affective psychoses having better <b>insight</b> than those with manic affective psychoses. There was no relationship between <b>insight</b> and DUP, but there was a relationship between time spent in treatment before assessment and <b>insight,</b> even after controlling for severity of symptoms. The results taken together suggest a model of <b>insight</b> in early psychosis with a significant neuropsychological component, particularly with verbal memory but also with generalised cognitive ability. There is likely to be a social component to <b>insight</b> affected by initial time spent in contact with treatment, helping patients to understand and come to terms with their illness...|$|R
40|$|Abstract Introduction Affective {{state may}} {{influence}} <b>insight,</b> especially regarding mania. Nevertheless, studies {{have so far}} suggested that depression seems not to significantly impair <b>insight.</b> To {{the best of our}} knowledge, this study pioneers the evaluation of how <b>insight</b> variations in bipolar depression correlate with clinical variables. Method A group of 165 bipolar patients, 52 of whom had depressive episodes according to DSM- 5 criteria, were followed during a year. All patients underwent clinical assessment, and <b>insight</b> was evaluated through the <b>Insight</b> Scale for Affective Disorders (ISAD). Repeated-measures ANOVA was calculated comparing scores on the four ISAD factors (<b>insight</b> into symptoms, the condition itself, self-esteem and social relationships) in order to investigate differences in <b>insight</b> according to different objects. Correlational analysis explored which clinical symptoms were linked to reduced <b>insight.</b> Results Worse total <b>insight</b> correlated with suicide attempt/ideation and fewer subsyndromal manic symptoms such as mood elevation, increased energy and sexual interest. Worse self-esteem <b>insight</b> was associated with not only suicide ideation/attempt but also with activity reduction and psychomotor retardation. Worse symptom <b>insight</b> also correlated with psychomotor retardation. Better <b>insight</b> into having an affective disorder was associated with more intense hypochondria symptoms. Finally, worse <b>insight</b> into having an illness was associated with psychotic episodes. Conclusion Our study found that symptoms other than psychosis – suicide ideation, psychomotor retardation and reduction of activity and work – correlate with <b>insight</b> impairment in bipolar depression...|$|R

40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{examine the}} nature and {{clinical}} correlates of <b>insight</b> in first-episode schizophrenia, and how these differ from findings in established schizophrenia. METHOD: <b>Insight</b> (and <b>insight</b> dimensions), clinical symptoms, neurocognitive function and social function were assessed in 94 patients with first-episode schizophrenia or schizophreniform disorder according to DSM-IV criteria. RESULTS: Greater global <b>insight</b> was associated with more severe depression. Poor overall <b>insight</b> was associated significantly with more severe negative and disorganisation symptoms as well as poor working memory, and at a trend level with lower current IQ. Patients with poor <b>insight</b> perceived themselves {{to have a better}} level of independent performance at daily living activities. CONCLUSION: In first-episode psychosis, the clinical correlates of poor <b>insight</b> are similar to those reported for established schizophrenia. Those patients with greater <b>insight</b> may be at risk of depression.

40|$|Objective: Impaired <b>insight</b> is an {{important}} and prevalent symptom of psychosis. It remains unclear whether cognitive disturbances hamper improvements in <b>insight.</b> We investigated the neurocognitive, social cognitive, and clinical correlates of changes in <b>insight.</b> Method: One hundred and fifty-four patients with a psychotic disorder were assessed at baseline (T- 0) and after three years (T- 3) with the Birchwood <b>Insight</b> Scale, the Positive And Negative Syndrome Scale, measures of neurocognition and social cognition. Linear regression {{analyses were conducted to}} examine to what extend neurocognition, social cognition, clinical symptoms and phase of illness could uniquely predict <b>insight</b> change. Subsequently, changes in these factors were related to <b>insight</b> change. Results: Better neurocognitive performance and fewer clinical symptoms at baseline explained <b>insight</b> improvements. The additional effect of clinical symptoms over and above the contribution of neurocognition was significant. Together, these factors explained 10 % of the variance.

40|$|Introduction. Self-related {{processing}} (SRP) {{has been}} associated with clinical and cognitive <b>insight.</b> We investigated the relationship between implicit SRP (ISRP) and explicit SRP (ESRP) and <b>insight.</b> We first hypothesised that impaired <b>insight</b> is associated with the extent to which implicit feedback is incorporated in the self-image and subsequently influences behaviour. Second, we hypothesised that impaired <b>insight</b> is related to the way patients handle explicit feedback and use it to guide subsequent behaviour, therefore we expected to find a positive relationship between level of <b>insight</b> and the explicit self-related processing task. Methods. Thirty-four schizophrenia patients and 23 healthy controls participated in the study. Patients were assessed with the Schedule for the Assessment of Insight-Expanded and the Beck Cognitive <b>Insight</b> Scale. ISRP was measured using a working memory two-back priming task. ESRP was measured with an adapted version of the Wisconsin Card Sorting Task where patients received explicit feedback on their performance. Results. Cognitive <b>insight,</b> but not clinical <b>insight,</b> was positively associated with ISRP after implicit positive cues. Both clinical and cognitive <b>insight</b> were positively associated with the ability to adjust performance upon receiving explicit feedback, though cognitive <b>insight</b> was more strongly associated with overall task performance.
