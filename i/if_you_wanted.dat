25|$|Turn of {{the century}} {{baseball}} attendances were modest by later standards. The average for the 1,110 games in the 1901 season was 3,247. However the first 20 years of the 20th century saw an unprecedented rise in the popularity of baseball. Large stadiums dedicated to the game were built {{for many of the}} larger clubs or existing grounds enlarged, including Tiger Stadium in Detroit, Shibe Park in Philadelphia, Ebbets Field in Brooklyn, the Polo Grounds in Manhattan, Boston's Fenway Park along with Wrigley Field and Comiskey Park in Chicago. Likewise from the Eastern League to the small developing leagues in the West, and the rising Negro Leagues professional baseball was being played all across the country. Average major league attendances reached a pre World War I peak of 5,836 in 1909, before falling back during the war. Where there weren't professional teams, there were semi-pro teams, traveling teams barnstorming, company clubs and amateur men's leagues.

500|$|VanAirsdale {{cited the}} release date and {{screening}} {{as the third}} and fourth reasons; he said there was confusion about what day the film was going to debut in theaters, and that Toronto is [...] "a nation removed from the audience where the film's actual momentum had been accruing for at least a month" [...] and that [...] "this rarely works for early fall releases; not because news doesn’t travel, obviously, but because it peels away a layer of accessibility that accompanies New York and L.A. bows." [...] The final reason, he attributed to the critics, believing that the fusion of horror and teen comedy confused some of them. He mentioned Ty Burr's review in particular, and stated that the film could perhaps have used more horror and been funnier, but that the film is [...] "ultimately a movie about two teenage girls' misadventures in victimization" [...] and that [...] "he jokes are virtually incidental to the friction imposed on women who happen to be {{two sides of the same}} coin.

In the same year, Roxette recorded and released [...] "Almost Unreal", a song originally slated for the film Hocus Pocus starring Bette Midler. However, the song {{was moved to the}} soundtrack of the film based on the Nintendo video game Super Mario Bros. Supported by an expensive video and ultimately receiving respectable airplay, [...] "Almost Unreal" [...] managed to briefly reach {{the lower end of the}} Billboard Hot 100 but charted highest in the UK reaching the top 10, the group's first time there since [...] "Joyride" [...] two years before. Roxette themselves were dismissive about the song, with Fredriksson saying it was [...] "not one of our most inspired moments." [...] On the other hand, Gessle stated: [...] "I still like the song in a way... but <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>wanted</b> to make a parody of Roxette, it would probably sound something like this."

In his B– review, Kaiser asserted that [...] "Lisa Goes Gaga" [...] used a straightforward interpretation of the singer, and felt that Lady Gaga's appearance was superior to previous guest appearances. [...] "So many Simpsons celebrity voices," [...] he stated, [...] "show up for a few minutes at most, with Extras-style 'Wow, Chris Martin of Coldplay, what are you doing here?' Or they voice one-off characters without enough flair to be memorable. Instead, Gaga was the focus of the entire episode, to the point where <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>wanted</b> to call it a half-hour commercial for Lady Gaga, you probably wouldn’t be wrong. Fortunately for 'Lisa Goes Gaga', the celebrity at its heart is entertaining enough that it being her commercial isn’t a complete waste of time." [...] A writer for HLN avouched that The Simpsons managed to culminate its season [...] "with a lot of style"; David Greenwald of Billboard echoed similar sentiments. Gaga's performance was frequently mentioned in the critiques. Idolator's Becky Bain, Tracy Gilchrist of SheWired, and Caroline Westbrook of Metro issued favorable assessments of her acting: the latter affirmed that Gaga had many memorable moments throughout the episode.|$|E
500|$|Rendering lead Jessica McMackin {{spoke about}} the use of ray tracing on the film, saying: [...] "In {{addition}} to creating accurate reflections, we used ray tracing to achieve other effects. We were able to use this approach to create accurate shadows, like when there are multiple light sources and {{you want to get a}} feathering of shadows at the edges. Or occlusion, which is the absence of ambient light between two surfaces, like a crease in a shirt. A fourth use is irradiance. An example of this would be if you had a piece of red paper and held it up to a white wall, the light would be colored by the paper and cast a red glow on the wall." [...] Character supervisor Tim Milliron explained that the film uses a ground–locking system that kept the cars firmly planted on the road, saying: [...] "The ground-locking system is one of the things I’m most proud of on this film. In the past, characters have never known about their environment in any way. A simulation pass was required <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>wanted</b> to make something like that happen. On Cars, this system is built into the models themselves, and as you move the car around, the vehicle sticks to the ground. It was one of those things that we do at Pixar where we knew going in that it had to be done, but we had no idea how to do it." ...|$|E

Two weeks later he returned to the regions covered initially, gave copies to the photographers, and interviewed them about the meaning of their photos. [...] Zaltman realized just how powerful the use of images “owned” by those being interviewed were in gaining a deep understanding of their implicit or tacit assumptions and beliefs. Zaltman noticed, for example, that they often cut off the feet of people appearing in their images. [...] It was discovered that this was deliberate. The Nepalese did not want to embarrass their friends and neighbors by showing their bare feet, which was a sign of poverty, and for this reason deliberately chose to leave it out of the photographic record.|$|E

This form of challenge was illustrated in the movie Fearless, when Jet Li's character challenges another warrior to a fight. The book Ultimate Sparring: Principles & Practices comments, [...] "martial artists conducted ‘Challenge matches’ [...] to test each other's skills, because of a personal dispute, or to prove one martial system’s superiority over another system." [...] Either fighter lost the match and his credibility if he fell, was forced off or was knocked to the floor of the stage. As a result, no one would want to learn boxing from him. The winner of the bout became the [...] "owner of the platform" [...] and remained on stage unless he was forced off himself. If there were no more challengers, he became the champion and or established the dominance of his style in that area. Another way was to defeat an already established master on the lei tai and then take over his school.|$|E
