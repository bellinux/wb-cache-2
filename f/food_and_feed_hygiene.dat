40|$|Investigations on the <b>food</b> <b>and</b> <b>feeding</b> habits {{will throw}} more {{light on the}} migratory and {{shoaling}} habits of pelagic species of fish, and it is particularly important for a species of high commercial value such as the mackerel.

40|$|In this paper, DNA {{extraction}} {{methods have}} been evaluated to detect the presence of genetically modified organisms (GMOs) in maize <b>food</b> <b>and</b> <b>feed</b> products commercialised in Turkey. All the extraction methods tested performed well {{for the majority of}} maize <b>foods</b> <b>and</b> <b>feed</b> products analysed. However, the highest DNA content was achieved by the Wizard, Genespin or the CTAB method, all of which produced optimal DNA yield and purity for different maize <b>food</b> <b>and</b> <b>feed</b> products. The samples were then screened for the presence of GM elements, along with certified reference materials. Of the <b>food</b> <b>and</b> <b>feed</b> samples, 8 % tested positive for the presence of one GM element (NOS terminator), of which half (4 % of the total) also contained a second element (the Cauliflower Mosaic Virus 35 S promoter). The results obtained herein clearly demonstrate the presence of GM maize in the Turkish market, and that the Foodproof GMO Screening Kit provides reliable screening of maize <b>food</b> <b>and</b> <b>feed</b> products...|$|R
40|$|Aflatoxins are potent {{carcinogens}} {{and produced}} by almost all Aspergillus parasiticus isolates and about 35 % of Aspergillus flavus isolates. Chemical methods {{are used for}} detection of aflatoxins in <b>food</b> <b>and</b> <b>feed.</b> These methods cannot detect aflatoxinogenic fungi in samples, which contain undetectable amounts of aflatoxins. The objective of this research work was to ascertain the importance of molecular and microbiological methods in detection of aflatoxinogenic fungus A. parasiticus in <b>food</b> <b>and</b> <b>feed</b> samples in Jordan. Specific media {{for the detection of}} aflatoxins showed the prevalence of A. parasiticus (6 – 22 %) in contaminated <b>food</b> <b>and</b> <b>feed</b> samples.

40|$|Mycotoxins, {{secondary}} metabolites {{produced by}} some filamentous fungi during their growth on <b>food</b> <b>and</b> <b>feed</b> commodities, represent a serious health hazard {{due to their}} possible cytotoxic and genotoxic effects for human and animals. The presence of some mycotoxins in <b>foods</b> <b>and</b> <b>feeds</b> can induce tumours, immune suppression and lowering of animal production. The levels of different mycotoxins, like aflatoxins, ochratoxin A and fusarium toxins in <b>food</b> <b>and</b> <b>feed</b> commodities are limited by law. Up to day {{the control of the}} mycotoxins in <b>foods</b> <b>and</b> <b>feeds</b> is mainly achieved by the use of chemical compounds. This strategy could arise environmental problems and select fungal strains resistant to their effects. Some natural compounds like mushroom β-glucans and plant derived antioxidants have demonstrated the ability to provide a long lasting control of the biosynthesis of different mycotoxins, both in vitro and on stored maize and wheat seeds. Furthermore, mushroom' β-glucans have proven a significant immune-enhancing effects on human and animal cells. Thus, their use in a challenge against mycotoxins could provide not only the control of these secondary metabolites but also an improvement of animal well-being...|$|R

40|$|Systematic reviews are {{commonly}} used in human health research to provide overviews of existing evidence pertinent to clearly formulated specific questions, using pre-specified and standardised methods to identify and critically appraise relevant research, and to collect, report and analyse data from the studies that {{are included in the}} reviews. Formal systematic reviews have rarely been used in <b>food</b> <b>and</b> <b>feed</b> safety risk assessments and the existing systematic review methods in other disciplines may not be directly applicable in this field. This Guidance aims to assist the application of systematic reviews to <b>food</b> <b>and</b> <b>feed</b> safety risk assessments in support of decision making, by describing a framework for identifying the different types of question suitable for systematic review generated by the risk assessment process and for determining the need for systematic reviews when dealing with broad <b>food</b> <b>and</b> <b>feed</b> safety policy problems. The Guidance provides suggestions and examples for the conduct of eight key steps in the systematic review process (preparing a review, searching for studies, selecting studies for inclusion, collecting data from included studies, assessing the methodological quality of included studies, synthesising data from the studies, presenting data and results, and interpreting the results and drawing conclusions) for questions suitable for systematic reviews, taking into account issues that may be unique to <b>food</b> <b>and</b> <b>feed</b> safety. Due to its methodological rigor and its objective and transparent nature, systematic review methodology and its principles could provide additional value for answering well-formulated specific questions generated by the risk assessment process or other analytical frameworks in <b>food</b> <b>and</b> <b>feed</b> safety.
