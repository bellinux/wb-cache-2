40|$|There are an innumerable {{number of}} {{precision}} automotive assemblies which use pinned joints for alignment. Many of these suffer from poor performance and cost/quality issues because pinned joints are inherently over-constrained. This paper introduces the Quasi-Kinematic Coupling (QKC) {{as a solution}} for precision (better than 10 microns) automotive assemblies. For these applications, QKCs require fewer parts, have a lower total cost, and provide sub-micron repeatability. This paper covers design and manufacturing considerations for automotive QKCs. Proof of concept is demonstrated via a case study on the block-main bearing assembly of a Ford six cylinder engine. Repeatability tests yield average QKC <b>bearing</b> center <b>line</b> repeatability of 0. 65 microns at the outer journal bearings as compared to 4. 85 microns for pinned joints. This QKC uses 60 % fewer precision features, costs 36 % less, and allows feature size and placement tolerance ranges which are twice as wide {{as those of the}} previous pinned joints.

40|$|The fatigue {{initiation}} behaviour of two Al-based <b>bearing</b> <b>lining</b> alloys {{has been}} assessed by image analysis tessellation techniques and subsequent adaptive numerical classification approaches. Fatigue initiation occurs by decohesion at Si particles, {{and in the}} absence of Si particles decohesion occurs at Sn particles. In both cases, relatively unclustered, large particles initiate fatigue, and the relative position of the nearest neighbour particle seems to have significance. This can be explained qualitatively in terms of strain mismatch arising from differing elastic moduli between the particles and surrounding Al matrix and local stress concentration and superposition effects. The lining alloy containing no Si and high Sn content exhibits more directionality, and a heavier dependence on angular information is found by the classifier...|$|R

Bearings of different weight are taken into account by approximating the distance from each direction finder to the source. The result is general and may have wide application.

40|$|Fatigue {{initiation}} {{and subsequent}} {{short and long}} crack growth has been investigated in an typical automotive bearing system, focussing on the behaviour of the aluminium-tin-silicon lining material. Crack initiation appears {{to be associated with}} decohesion of the interface between the primary, globular silicon and the aluminium matrix. Short crack growth, and crack growth at low Delta K levels in the long crack case, appears to be tortuous and highly microstructurally dependent, deviating towards secondary phase/matrix interfaces. At higher Delta K levels crack growth occurs principally through the aluminium matrix, and classical striations are seen. Multiple crack initiation is seen in the multiphase <b>bearing</b> <b>lining</b> material and crack coalescence gives rise to the dominant crack. Uncoalesced cracks appear to arrest at a "critical" surface crack length, whose dimension has been linked to sub-surface crack deflection within the lining material once the crack reaches the steel backing...|$|R

Removal of one of the centralizers resulted in a loss of control of hole trajectory in the horizontal plane. Generally, holes tended to turn to the right, presumably because of right-hand rotation of the bit.

The secondary phases of such alloys comprise fi ne and relatively few Sn and Si particles {{as well as}} a large number of hard AlNi 3 -type intermetallics, frequently encapsulated within soft Sn layers.

Through elasto-plastic fi nite element analysis of ideal microstructures but with realistic geometric and mechanical property data, critical values of key stress and strain components within the matrix, the Sn layers, and the particles were predicted and linked to microstructural features associated with observed fatigue initiation. These modelling results indicate the extent to which either the hydrostatic stresses or plastic shear strains may be responsible for fatigue crack initiation in the Sn layers, as well as the optimum microstructural characteristics that would minimise tensile stresses, which are responsible for brittle particle fracture...|$|R
