40|$|The current ongoing {{evolution}} towards mass customization, {{resulting in}} the production of small lots or prototypes and single unique items, requires a different strategy compared to classic high volume manufacturing. In order to deal with the increasing product range and decreasing time to market, the flexibility of current manufacturing process chain needs to increase. A conventional manufacturing process of a high quality component consists of an initial machining step, for example a milling and/or turning operation, starting from bulk material (block, cylinder). In a next step, the part is unclamped, transported to a heat treatment facility in order to attain the required material properties (hardness, residual surface stresses, microstructure,…). This step introduces inevitably deformations to the component, which is why a finishing operation is performed after the component is transported, re-clamped and re-aligned. In this PhD thesis 2 alterations to this conventional process flow are investigated. A first innovation investigated in this thesis, is combining the machining, heat treatment and if required a hard finishing operation in 1 single machine and setup. This omits the need for logistics {{back and forth to the}} hardening facility. Re-clamping and re-aligning of the component is no longer needed for the hard finishing operation, which reduces the total lead time and errors introduced during these labor intensive operations. This is realized by integrating a laser into a machining center, allowing to perform both the machining operations as the heat treatment in one setup. In this thesis, 2 different setups are developed and described. The first setup, uses a 500 W Nd:Yag laser as a heat source. A fixed spot optical design is made using basic optics calculus and is updated using ray tracing simulation. A mechanical design is made and realized. The integration of the laser as a tool is done into a 5 -axis milling machine. A spotsize of 1. 2 mm diameter or more (if out of focus) is moved across the surface of the component by moving the machine’s axis. The process of integrated laser hardening is investigated on C 45 steel by performing a Design of Experiment, using 3 different feed rates and 4 different spotsizes. High hardness values, above 750 HV and a hardening depth of about 0. 2 mm are achieved. Thanks to the high cooling rate during the heat cycle in laser hardening, the hardness exceeds hardness values achieved by conventional hardening techniques. A second design of experiment, investigating multiple laser tracks next to each other, in order to cover a larger area, is performed. From these experiments, it is concluded it is impossible, no matter what overlap/inter-track distance is used, to achieve a uniform hardness along the cross section of multiple scan tracks. This effect is identified as a tempering/softening effect, in which the second track tempers a part of the first track. Finally, a die and mold component, prone to rapid wear, made of a high alloyed steel, is laser hardened using the developed setup, proving the industrial relevance of this work. In order to achieve a uniform hardness across a larger area, a new setup is developed on a 11 -axis machining center. Instead of using a fixed spot hardening strategy as in the previous setup, a very small spot (0. 8 mm in diameter) is scanned across the surface at high speed using a rotating mirror, while moving slowly in the feed direction by moving the machine’s axis. The optical and mechanical design and realization of this setup are described. A control system, controlling laser source (500 W diode laser), mirror actuator and auxiliary equipment, while monitoring the actual temperature and machine position, is developed. A software tool which allows to program the <b>hardening</b> <b>operation</b> of complex shaped components, is developed and the strategy is illustrated on an example. The process of integrated scanning laser hardening is investigated on a low alloyed steel (C 45) and a highly alloyed steel (40 CrMnMo 7). The samples showed no tempering effects, resulting in a uniform hardness across the scan width. The robustness of the process and control is verified by testing contaminated samples (oil, steel/aluminum chips, emulsion) and samples with varying scanning width. Two cases are described as an example of industrial applications for this technology. The second innovation tackles the machining of near net shapes, which is significantly different to machining from bulk material. In this thesis, 2 types of near net shape machining are investigated: the machining of gears from forgings and the finishing of large assemblies built by additive manufacturing. The machining of gears using the conventional processes requires dedicated, design specific tools. The lead time and cost of these tools are high, which is an issue for prototypes and small batch production. Three different alternative production technologies are investigated. A multi-axis milling strategy using standard end mills is developed and an automotive gearbox gear is made to high quality grinding specifications in less than 24 hours, while the lead time for conventional production is in the order of 13 weeks. This machining process is ideal to combine with the integrated laser hardening. Since the distortions introduced by laser hardening are limited, a hard finishing operation might be omitted, resulting in a hardened high accuracy gear manufactured in hours/days instead of weeks. The finishing of large assemblies, built using additive manufactured components, to a very high accuracy is quite different to machining a small component from bulk to the same accuracy. By investigating and reducing errors introduced by CAD/CAM, machining, in-machine mounting (clamping and aligning) and machine condition (position accuracy, flatness table and thermal stability), the achieved tolerance is reduced significantly. This is verified on a demonstrator part. nrpages: 254 status: publishe...|$|E

5000|$|Diffusion {{hardening}} {{can be done}} in {{many different}} ways to achieve different hardnesses and different surface finishes on metal parts. Some of the different diffusion <b>hardening</b> <b>operations</b> include: Carburizing, Nitriding, Carbonitriding, Nitrocarburizing, Boriding, Titanium-carbon diffusion, and Toyota diffusion. While diffusion hardening is performed mainly on steel parts and carbon is mainly the element used for diffusion, diffusion hardening can also be performed with other diffusion elements and with other metals. In nitriding, nitrogen is diffused into the surface of steel, but can also be used with metals such as Aluminum, Chromium, Molybdenum, and Vanadium. [...] Besides metals and diffusion elements used, diffusion hardening processes differ in the temperature required for diffusion, the phase of the diffusion element, and additional treatments such as quenching and tempering. These different factors greatly affect surface finish and dimensional accuracy of a part. A quenched and tempered part does not have the same dimensional accuracy as a part that has not undergone such a process. Also, they can affect the efficiency of the overall process. In carburizing, the carbon can be in any of the solid, liquid, or gas phases. Although using carbon in the solid phase is usually the safest and easiest of these to work with, the process is difficult to control and the heating is inefficient. All these things must come into consideration when choosing a diffusion hardening process.|$|R

The heavy duty gear wheels and pinions, used in various types of traction motors (viz 165, 253 BX/AZ, TM 4939 etc), are manufacture by BHEL. The manufacturing procedure of gear wheels include hardening to 415 HV minimum. The gear wheels were being hardened by conventional hardening process know as water Quenching process. This include heating of gear wheels quenching and tempering to achieve the required hardness. BHEL Bhopal at present is manufacturing 1500 to 1800 traction heavy duty gears per annum. Heavy duty gears usually work under most severe conditions as such the gears should possess high strength and good wear resistance. But in actual practices some difficulties arise while hardening process such as non-uniform hardness and hence cracking of gears, non-uniform temperature profile, distortion of teeth, etc. Optimization here refers to the experimental analysis according to which it was found economical and productive to switch over to induction hardening of gears instead of conventional hardening. The various pros and cons were analyses and finally induction machine has been imported and commissioned.

That way, BMEWS equipment could be utilized as early as 1961 and until the new Combat Operations Center was completed. NORAD said that the only initial active Advanced Intercontinental Ballistic Missile (AICBM) system that could be ready in sufficient numbers to be effective by 1964 was the Nike Zeus, which would integrate the use of radar, anti-missile missiles and atomic warheads. In December 1958, NORAD called for the hasty development of the anti-Intercontinental ballistic missile (ICBM) system, the WS-117L reconnaissance satellite. The Clear Air Force Station system in Alaska was scheduled to be completed in 1961, but the <b>hardened</b> Combat <b>Operation</b> Center would not be operations until sometime after that. So, an interim BMEWS central display facility was built as an annex to the Ent Combat Operation Center. It would not, though, have an interim satellite prediction computer, that that would be placed in the new Cheyenne Mountain facility. In the meantime, each radar site's computer would make its own calculations. The Ent Air Force Base COC annex would not be completed until December 1960, so an interim solution was to be implemented at Thule by September 1960 and until December 1960. SPADATS was transferred to NORAD and CONAD command in November 1960 and was activated at the Ent Air Force Base on February 14, 1961 by the 1st Aerospace Surveillance and Control Squadron, which was also responsible for the operation of the BMEWS Central Computer and Display Facility in the NORAD Operations Center. SPADATS was dedicated at Ent on July 3, 1961, just a few months after excavation began on Cheyenne Mountain.|$|R
40|$|Drilling plays a very {{influential}} role in machining since more than 40 % of material removal operations {{are associated with}} this type of action. Traditionally, it generates high temperature during drilling operation. Therefore, the drilling tool becomes dull and leads to a limited service life. Moreover, the workpiece materials have been <b>hardened</b> during drilling <b>operation</b> which makes the post operation troublesome.

40|$|Recently many {{works have}} been done in order to study the turning process of {{hardened}} steels, mainly concerning the lives of ceramic and PCBN tools. However, just few works deal with the problem of turning accuracy, comparing it with grinding accuracy, mainly when the lathe used has a conventional mechanical design. Therefore, it is important to evaluate the capability of these conventional machines to replace the grinding operation by turning and still maintain workpiece quality typical of grinding operations. This work tries to contribute to fill this gap. Several AISI E 52100 hardened steel workpieces (60 HRc) were turned using mixed ceramic and PCBN tool materials and different cutting speeds in a lathe of conventional design. Workpiece surface roughness and diameter variation were measured throughout the tool life test, in order to evaluate the quality of the workpiece. The length of the workpieces was also varied to analyze the influence of workpiece shape on its quality.

The authors also provide their recommendations in respect of the mounting of the proposed façade system. The façade system considered in the article is composed of wall foam concrete blocks reinforced by basalt fibers (bearing elements of the structure), cellular concrete polystyrene (thermal insulation), and porous concrete (fireproofing and thermal insulation). Retained shuttering (in the fireproofing sections) represents chrysolite cement sheets attached to the structures composed of glass-fiber plastic elements. The application of insulating porous concrete as a fireproofing material {{is based on the}} principle of adjustable stress-strained states of materials in the environment of variable pressure. This technology was developed at Moscow State University of Civil Engineering, and it was initially designated for the manufacturing of tailor-made products. The above concrete is also designated for retained shuttering and modified cavity masonry walls. Porous concrete that expands inside the fireproofing cavity ensures a tight contact both with the basic material and thermal insulation plates.

40|$|The {{economy of}} a {{developing}} nation like India depends on various sectors such as: Agriculture, Commerce and Industries, Finance, Communication and Information Technology, etc. The manufacturing industries {{play a key}} role in contributing to the economy of a nation. They mainly consist of industries like steel casting, automobiles and other heavy manufacturing. This research study is related to automobile industry and particularly the gear manufacturers. The automobile industry is an important industry from the manufacturing point of view. This is due to the fact that it has deep forward and backward linkages with several key segments of the economy and it has a strong multiplier effect. Hence, it is capable of being the driver of economic growth. The recent trend among the automobile manufacturing organizations is to outsource individual components to sub-contractors and conduct the sub-assemblies and assemblies in-house. Some components like gears are important in terms of quality. So in case of these components the automobile manufacturing organizations normally partially outsource the components. They carry out the important finishing operations in-house. Due to this practice, many micro to medium scale gear manufacturers have emerged as sub-contractors to different automobile manufacturing organizations. There is a high amount of competition among different gear manufacturers. To survive the competition any gear manufacturer must focus on the three major aspects: cost, quality and delivery. The focus in this study is on the delivery aspect. Precisely, this thesis attempts to address the scheduling problems in automobile gear manufacturing by proposing efficient solution methodologies in order to aid the gear manufacturers in the delivery of orders in the form of semi-finished gears, to the customers (i. e. automobile manufacturing organizations). The automobile gear manufacturing process can be broadly divided into three distinct stages, starting from the machining of the gear blanks. These three stages in automobile gear manufacturing are: pre heat treatment (pre-HT), heat treatment (HT) and post heat treatment (post-HT). Out of these three stages, the gear manufacturers carry out the first two stages namely pre-HT and HT, and deliver the semi-finished gears to the automobile manufacturing organizations. As most of the operations are carried out by the gear manufacturers, the real research problem lies in identifying bottleneck operations in both pre-HT and HT stages. By addressing the bottleneck operations, one can expect to have a competitive advantage among the gear manufacturers and in turn among the automobile manufacturing organizations. Since every gear manufacturer is involved in both: the pre-HT stage and the HT stage of gear manufacturing, they will always try to achieve both: throughput (from their own company’s perspective) and due date compliance (from the customer’s i. e. automobile manufacturing organizations’ perspective). In order to meet these two objectives for the gear manufacturer, there are two research problems identified in this thesis based on the bottleneck operations: one at the pre-HT stage and the other at the HT stage. The Research Problem 1, identified in the pre HT stage consists of a variety of machining operations. In all the pre-HT operations, one single gear is processed on a machine at a time. The machines used in these operations are essentially the discrete processors as known in the scheduling literature. Among the different operations carried out in the pre-HT stage, the gear shaving operation is the final operation which takes a relatively longer processing time compared to other operations in this stage. Hence this operation becomes the bottleneck operation and the Research Problem 1 is related to this operation. Normally, there are more than one machines available for carrying out the gear shaving operations. The processing time of a job is independent of the type of machine used (identical parallel machines). However, since automobile gears vary widely in terms of size, all the available machines may not be able to process a given job (machine eligibility restrictions). The jobs are made available for processing as and when the job orders are received from the automobile manufacturing organizations. Thus all the jobs may not be available for processing at the same time (unequal release times or dynamic job arrivals). After a job is completed on a machine, a setup is incurred before processing the next job. The setup operations involve cleaning of the machine, changing of cutting tools and toolings, setting of the machining parameters and fine tuning of the machining parameters. The amount of time required for the setup depends on both, the job that has been completed and the job that is to be processed (sequence dependent setup time). Different jobs will have different priorities depending on the nature of the job order, monetary value of the job and urgency for the next stage (job weights). Since the pre-HT stage is an upstream stage in gear manufacturing, particularly to the heat treatment (HT) stage, the aim of this stage will be to feed the downstream stage as quickly as possible. Hence, a completion time based scheduling objective is considered. Since the release times of jobs are unequal, the flowtime of a job is of interest in determining the throughput. Also, since the jobs have different weights, the weighted flowtime is of significance. Therefore, the scheduling objective for Research Problem 1 is taken as minimizing the total weighted flowtime of the jobs in a scheduling window. A vast amount of literature is available on scheduling of parallel machines. However, to the best of our knowledge, no study has simultaneously addressed the job characteristics: unequal release times, sequence dependent setup times and machine eligibility restrictions for identical parallel machines to minimize the total weighted flowtime. The Research Problem 2 was identified at the HT stage of gear manufacturing. The aim of the HT stage in the metallurgical terms is to achieve case hardening of gears. The types of machines used in the HT stage are essentially the batch processing machines (BPM) or simply batch processors (BP). A BP unlike the discrete processor, can process several different jobs at a time. The constituent jobs that are processed together form a batch in the BP. The different operations of this stage are: hardening and soaking, quenching, tempering and shot blasting. The <b>hardening</b> and soaking <b>operation</b> typically takes a longer processing time (6 - 18 hours) as compared to the other operations (15 minutes to 90 minutes). Also, being the first operation of the HT stage, once the <b>hardening</b> and soaking <b>operation</b> is completed, the other operations can be streamlined. Hence the scheduling of this bottleneck operation is of managerial importance. The jobs arrive at the <b>hardening</b> and soaking <b>operation</b> as and when they are completed at the pre-HT stage (unequal release times). Different jobs may have different processing requirements corresponding to time and temperature setting. Therefore, although a BP can process multiple jobs at a time, jobs with different processing requirements cannot be processed together. Jobs that can be processed together are grouped in job families. Since jobs of different families cannot be processed together we get the situation of incompatible job families. The BP has a fixed and finite capacity (expressed in terms of mass). Jobs will have different masses – which represents the size of jobs (non-identical job sizes). While constructing a batch, a job can be split in case there is a capacity violation for the BP (job splitting). The same priorities of the jobs (job weights) as in the pre-HT stage, will continue in this stage as well. As the Research Problem 2 deals with downstream stage of the gear manufacturing the objective of scheduling will be efficient delivery of the job to the automobile manufacturing organizations. The non-conformance to the due date will result in tardiness of the job. Also, since the jobs have different weights, the weighted tardiness of a job is of significance. Therefore, the scheduling objective for Research Problem 2 is taken as minimizing the total weighted tardiness (TWT) of the jobs in a scheduling window. Compared to the discrete processors, the scheduling of batch processors is a relatively new field (about two decades old). However, a review of literature reveals that no study has simultaneously addressed in any problem domain, the characteristics: unequal release times, incompatible job families, non-identical job sizes and job splitting for scheduling batch processors to minimize the total weighted tardiness. For Research Problem 1, an integer linear programming (ILP) model is developed. A suitable numerical example is developed and the workability of the proposed ILP model is validated for a small sized problem. The computational intractability of the proposed ILP model is verified empirically. Due to the computational intractability, real life large-size problems cannot be solved using the proposed ILP model. This has motivated us to propose simple heuristic algorithms. Accordingly, ten heuristic algorithms are proposed. Out of these ten proposed heuristic algorithms, five heuristic algorithms allow the use of unforced idleness and the remaining five heuristic algorithms do not allow the use of unforced idleness. In scheduling, unforced idleness is a situation when a machine is kept idle even if there are jobs available for processing. In order to understand the performance of the proposed heuristic algorithms, various factors that can affect the performance of the heuristic algorithms are identified based on the literature as well as based on the knowledge gained from the industry. An experimental design is developed based on the identified factors with different levels. A series of|$|R
