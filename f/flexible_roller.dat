50|$|In 1895 {{the company}} had about 25 {{employees}} and sold about $2,000 of bearings each month.That year Hyatt hired the 20-year-old Alfred P. Sloan as a draftsman.Sloan had recently obtained a degree from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.He had been struggling to find a job, and was recommended to Hyatt by John E. Searles, president of the American Sugar Refining Company, {{a friend of his}} father and a major investor in Hyatt.Sloan wrote later, Although the company was mismanaged and financially insecure, Sloan saw that the spirally-wound <b>flexible</b> <b>roller</b> bearing product had real potential.At that time machine parts did not have precise dimensions, so the flexibility of the Hyatt bearing was a valuable quality.However, Sloan left Hyatt in 1897 to take a better-paying job with which he could afford to marry his fiancée, Irene Jackson.He joined another start-up company named Hygienic Refrigerator, which was trying to develop an electric refrigerator.|$|E

40|$|Investigations into {{problems}} involving the vibration of conveyances in deep mining shafts {{have led to}} the identification of 'slamming' as a significant event in the initiation of large perturbations in the motion of the skip. Slamming occurs when the <b>flexible</b> <b>rollers</b> on the skip which normally act on the guides are inoperative. The primary concern is that this slamming event can give rise to large lateral loads on the shaft steelwork and is therefore a factor which limits the speed at which the skip can be drawn up the shaft. This study extends previous work to investigate the influence of compressive forces in the guides on the response of the skip and the steelwork. These forces are induced as a result of mining operations and lead to a decrease in the transverse stiffness of the guides. A mathematical model of the slamming event is formulated and a numerical solution for a specific case is performed. An alternative simplified solution is discussed and compared to the initial formulation, with the aim of facilitating the use of previous research results. A model to simulate the response of the skip when the skip rollers are functional is formulated, and numerical solutions of different examples are given. An important conclusion is that the compressive forces can significantly reduce the transverse stiffness of the guides, and should be taken into account in future designs.

40|$|DE 10108397 C UPAB: 20020621 NOVELTY - The {{cleaning}} method uses an elongate <b>flexible</b> cleaning <b>roller</b> (3) extending {{across the}} outer surface (1) of the free-standing structure (2) and displaced {{relative to the}} latter during the cleaning movement, with simultaneous application of tension in a direction perpendicular to the relative movement. The cleaning roller may be held under tension between a pair of winding devices (6, 7) mounted on respective vehicles (5 a, 5 b) used for the displacement relative to the outer surface of the free-standing structure. DETAILED DESCRIPTION - An INDEPENDENT CLAIM for a device for cleaning the outer surface of a free-standing structure is also included. USE - The method is used for cleaning the outside surface of a free-standing structure, e. g. a concert hall. ADVANTAGE - The cleaning method is suitable for free-standing structures of varying outer geometry...|$|R
40|$|In {{the process}} of {{composite}} resin prepreg tape winding, the presence of pores or voids among the layers of composite can result in reduced strength of winding. To alleviate this problem, it is required that the composite tape winding machines be designed such that the layers of composite are evenly wound on the previous one. The paper presents a novel design of flexible winding system for composite tape winding. Based on the analysis of errors in winding process, the novel winding system eliminates winding point error and winding angle error based on the speed controlled <b>flexible</b> <b>roller.</b> This paper also presents the kinetic analysis of the novel system and its controller design. Experiments are conducted on the novel winding system. The experimental results illustrate that the novel flexible winding system has a good performance in winding accuracy...|$|E
50|$|Some {{printers}} use a {{very thin}} <b>flexible</b> metal foil <b>roller,</b> so there is less thermal mass to be heated and the fuser can more quickly reach operating temperature. If paper moves through the fuser more slowly, there is more roller contact time for the toner to melt, and the fuser can operate at a lower temperature. Smaller, inexpensive laser printers typically print slowly, due to this energy-saving design, compared to large high speed printers where paper moves more rapidly through a high-temperature fuser with a very short contact time.|$|R
40|$|Thin-walled {{integrated}} {{flexible support}} structures {{are the major}} trend {{in the development of}} current rolling bearing technology. A thin-walled, integrated, squirrel-cage <b>flexible</b> support <b>roller</b> bearing, quasi-dynamic iterative finite element analysis (FEA) model is established in this paper. The FEA model is used to calculate the structural deformation of the thin-wall rings and support structures; the dynamic characteristics of the bearing are analyzed using the noncircular bearing modified quasi-dynamic model. The influence of the integrated flexible support structure on the internal load distribution and the dynamic characteristics of the roller bearing are analyzed. The results indicate that with the support of a flexible squirrel-cage, the maximum contact load is decreased by 14. 2 %, the loading region is enlarged by 25 %, the cage slide ratio is reduced by 24 %, and the fatigue life is increased by more than 50 %. In addition, as the ring wall thickness increased, the results increasingly approached those under a rigid assumption...|$|R
40|$|In this paper, a {{simulation}} tool {{is presented to}} support the design process of systems of <b>flexible,</b> rubber-covered <b>rollers.</b> A mathematical model is developed to determine the axial pressure variations in the nips of these systems. In the model the indentations of the rubber layers are coupled to the deflections of the rollers due to bending. The model is generic {{in the sense that}} the number of rollers in the system is not fixed, and rollers may have different lengths and be located asymmetrically with respect to each other. The rollers bend due to linear conditions applied at arbitrary positions along the roller axes. The rollers may have a surface profile and the rubber layer thicknesses may vary. In each nip paper can be present, located at any position. By an efficient numerical algorithm that solves the model, the effect of bending on the nip pressure distribution is determined. Crowning, use of an additional support roller, and internal bearings are examples shown as means to achieve a uniform pressure distribution...|$|R
50|$|John Wesley Hyatt was {{a printer}} by trade and a {{prolific}} inventor who secured over 250 patents, the first issued in 1861 for a knife grinder. His chemical experiments {{led to the}} invention of celluloid.In 1888 {{he was working on}} a mill for crushing sugar cane, but lacked adequate bearings. His solution was a roller bearing where the rollers were made from coiled strips of steel, and he patented his invention.The helical-shaped rollers made from flat spring steel were more <b>flexible</b> than solid-cylinder <b>rollers,</b> did not heat up and lock due to friction, and lasted longer.Later Hyatt introduced refinements, with the bearings assembled within a closed cage.|$|R
50|$|Body blading (also {{known as}} buggy rollin) {{is an extreme}} sport that {{involves}} descending down a slope while wearing a <b>flexible</b> aerodynamic plastic <b>roller</b> suit that has wheels on the feet, knees, torso, and arms. This suit was created by Jean-Yves Blondeau, and {{he is one of}} the premier body bladers. Body blading is similar to roller blading, and in fact a body blader often starts out using the rollers on their feet in the same fashion as roller blades in order to gain initial speed, but then the rider generally assumes a position lying on the stomach facing down the hill. A body blader is capable of reaching very high speeds. Maneuverability is achieved by moving the body into various positions to change direction.|$|R
