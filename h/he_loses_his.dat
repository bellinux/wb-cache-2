Looking after Sol takes a toll on Asher, however. Sol is loyal to his brother, but depends on him {{so much that he}} finds it difficult to function without him.

He gets into a few fights throughout the series, and makes situations worse by getting physical. Sol does not understand or think about what he is doing when <b>he</b> <b>loses</b> <b>his</b> temper.
