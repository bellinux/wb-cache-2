It was so large and heavy that it required the largest and most powerful aircraft to pull it off the airfield and subsequently tow it; four-engined bombers were used, most frequently the Handley Page Halifax. Both wing and cockpit were set above the fuselage to provide the greatest amount of room for the cargo compartment, and to ensure that they did not interfere with the loading of vehicles; the compartment measured approximately , [...] inches wide and between [...] and [...] inches in height. The nose of the glider was hinged and opened to the side for ease of loading vehicles and cargo, and the crew of two pilots were seated in tandem in a cockpit on the top of the fuselage, which was accessed via an internal ladder and was fifteen feet above ground; they were eventually protected by a bullet-proof windscreen and a plate of armour behind the second pilot. An intercom was also added to provide communication between the pilots and the personnel below them. An initial design feature, which was eventually removed prior to full-scale production, was the installation of an under-fuselage hatch which would allow the prone firing of a Bren light machine gun as the glider approached the landing zone.|$|E

40|$|<b>High</b> <b>grade</b> <b>steels,</b> {{particularly}} in flat products {{are associated with}} low levels of dissolved nitrogen. For deep drawing steels it is desirable to keep nitrogen levels below 50 ppm, where as a range of 120 to 150 ppm is acceptable for high strength structural steels (1). In EAF steelmaking, molten metal is often exposed directly to the air during the melt down. Ionisation of nitrogen by the arc is also thought to accelerate the rate of nitrogen pick up by the steel. In addition, scrap and ferro-alloys can contain significant dissolved nitrogen. As a result, whist steel produced from Oxygen steelmaking contains 30 to 40 ppm, nitrogen levels in steel produce from EAF is typically in the range 70 to 100 ppm...|$|R
