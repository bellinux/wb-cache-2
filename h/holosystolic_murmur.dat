Valsalva maneuver in mitral regurgitation associated with mitral valve prolapse will decrease left ventricular preload and move the murmur onset closer to S1, and isometric handgrip, which increases left ventricular afterload, will increase murmur intensity.

30|$|As many Down {{syndrome}} patients presenting to {{the emergency}} department, particularly those not accompanied by a parent or caregiver, {{may not be able}} to provide a detailed history, thorough physical examination is crucial for swift and appropriate diagnosis and disposition [16].

In the evening of presentation after eating her evening meal, she had a coughing fit that lasted 15 - 20 minutes and became very dyspneic. For immediate stabilization, the patient was placed in an oxygen cage and was given butorphanol, albuterol, and 2 doses of furosemide. After initial stabilization, orthogonal radiographs were performed and revealed left-sided cardiomegaly and pulmonary edema. Based on the patient's signalment, history, clinical signs, physical exam, and radiographs, the top differential diagnosis was congestive heart failure secondary to chronic valve disease. She was transferred to the Cardiology Service the next morning for further evaluation.

40|$|A 1 -year-old Welch Pony filly {{presented}} to the Medicine Service at Cornell University's Large Animal Hospital with a 3 -week history of intermittent fevers, lethargy, petechiae and shifting lameness. Prior antibiotic therapy failed to result in resolution of the clinical signs. Physical exam revealed left and right sided, grade III out of VI, apical, <b>holosystolic</b> heart <b>murmurs.</b> In addition, a grade IV out of VI "to and fro" murmur was auscultated over the left heart base. Clinical pathology identified a mild anemia, leukocytosis with a mature neutrophilia, and a severe thrombocytopenia. The presence of a fever of unknown origin, heart murmurs and leukocytosis led to a presumptive diagnosis of bacterial endocarditis. Other differential diagnoses considered included chronic inflammation, chronic infection, neoplasia, and immune mediated disease. Two-dimensional echocardiography identified severe vegetative lesions on the mitral, tricuspid, and aortic valves. Color flow Doppler showed mitral, tricuspid and aortic insufficiency, along with mild aortic stenosis. Due to the grave prognosis, the owners elected to have the pony euthanized. The diagnosis was confirmed with gross and histological post-mortem examination. This paper will discuss the pathogenesis of bacterial endocarditis and its potential consequences...|$|R
40|$|SummaryA 19 -year-old male was {{admitted}} to the emergency room of our hospital after a motor vehicle accident. During his first physical examination, a <b>holosystolic</b> <b>murmur</b> was heard at the fourth left parasternal border. Transthoracic echocardiography showed severe tricuspid insufficiency, but the cause of tricuspid insufficiency was unclear. Therefore, three-dimensional echocardiography was performed and demonstrated flail anterior, posterior and septal leaflets of the tricuspid valve. The diagnosis was tricuspid insufficiency due to papillary muscle rupture secondary to chest blunt trauma. Surgical repair of the tricuspid valve was performed in this patient. After surgery, the signs and symptoms of right ventricular heart failure were relieved. In this case, three-dimensional echocardiography was very useful for the evaluation of spatial destruction of the tricuspid valve and papillary muscle...|$|E
40|$|A 4 -month old, male castrated, Domestic Longhair kitten was {{presented}} to the Emergency Service in November 2008 for respiratory distress. Upon presentation, he was hypothermic, cyanotic, dyspneic, and coughing. Dull lungs sounds were ausculted bilaterally and a Grade III-IV/VI <b>holosystolic</b> <b>murmur</b> was ausculted at the left heart base. A diagnosis of left sided congestive heart failure secondary to a cardiac malformation was made following thoracic radiographs. Echocardiography disclosed severe bi-atrial dilation, an atrial septal defect, abnormal conformation of the mitral and tricuspid valves, and communication between all four heart chambers. Based on these findings, a diagnosis of incomplete endocardial cushion defect was made. Due to the grave prognosis associated with this condition and the severity of clinical signs, the kitten was euthanized. A necropsy followed and revealed a complete endocardial cushion defect...|$|E

The patient was initiated on appropriate antibiotic coverage, including nafcillin, resulting in steriliza-tion of blood cultures. Transesophageal echocardiography revealed a vegetation on the pacing wire, likely involving the tricuspid valve, necessitating removal of the pacing lead (online-only Data Supplement Movies I and II).

40|$|Abstract Background Subacute {{bacterial}} endocarditis (SBE) occasionally exhibits positive cytoplasmic anti-neutrophil cytoplasmic antibody (c-ANCA) of the anti-proteinase- 3 (PR- 3) type. Clinically, it mimics ANCA-associated vasculitis, such as Wegener's disease with glomerulonephritis. Lung abscesses {{are the most}} common manifestation of lung involvement. We herein report a case of culture-negative SBE strongly c-ANCA/PR 3 -positive accompanied by pulmonary involvement and glomerulonephritis. In this case, we took biopsies of both the lung and kidney, although renal biopsy is usually preferred over lung biopsy. The lung biopsy showed severe alveolar capillaritis, suggesting vasculitis consistent with polyangiitis. The renal biopsy revealed glomerulonephritis with a membranoproliferative pattern. To our knowledge, this is the first such reported case. Case presentation A 68 -year-old Chinese male patient presented to our hospital with a fever, cough, chest pain, and recurrent peripheral edema. He had a past medical history significant for treated schistosomiasis 20 years previously. Physical examination revealed palpable purpura, mild hypertension, hepatosplenomegaly, and a <b>holosystolic</b> cardiac <b>murmur</b> (Levine 2 / 6). Echocardiography showed tricuspid valve vegetations with moderate to severe regurgitation. Serum c-ANCA/PR 3 and cryoglobulin were strongly positive. Renal biopsy results indicated membranoproliferative glomerulonephritis with several crescents. Chest CT revealed multiple intraparenchymal and subpleural nodules, and lung biopsy showed polyangiitis. The patient’s ANCA titers, glomerulonephritis, and pulmonary injury all resolved after antibiotic therapy. Conclusion SBE may present with positive c-ANCA/PR 3, multiple pulmonary nodules, pulmonary polyangiitis, and glomerulonephritis clinically mimicking granulomatosis with polyangiitis (Wegener's granulomatosis). </p...|$|R
40|$|A 65 -year-old {{woman with}} a history of {{diabetes}} and a prior diagnosis of hypertrophic cardiomyopathy was admitted to the Department of Cardiology for palpitations. Cardiac examination revealed a 3 / 6 <b>holosystolic</b> <b>murmur</b> over the left parasternal area. Echocardiography showed that the aorta extended from the morphological systemic ventricle (RV), which was identified by the three-leaflet tricuspid valve (Fig. 1) that was inserted more apically than the mitral valve (Fig. 2). The pulmonary trunk, identified by its bifurcation, arose from the morphological “pulmonic ” ventricle (LV) (Fig. 3). The RV was mildly dilated, the septum wall was 18 mm thick, and systolic RV function was mildly reduced (ejection fraction 40 %). There was moderate atrioventricular (tricuspid) valve regurgitation.

Electrocardiographic examination findings were consistent with atrial fibrillation and tachycardia. Echocardiographic examination identified marked atrioventricular regurgitation and atrial dilation bilaterally, thickening of the mitral and tricuspid valves and dilation of the pulmonary artery consistent with pulmonary hypertension. No ventricular or atrial septal defect was present. Cardiomegaly and diffuse pulmonary oedema were evident on examination of lateral thoracic radiographs. Dysplasia of the mitral and tricuspid valves, eccentric cardiomegaly and pulmonary oedema were confirmed by post mortem examination.
