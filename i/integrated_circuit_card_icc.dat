5000|$|A smart card, chip card, or <b>integrated</b> <b>circuit</b> <b>card</b> (<b>ICC),</b> is any pocket-sized {{card with}} {{embedded}} integrated circuits which can process data. This implies {{that it can}} receive input which is processed [...] - [...] {{by way of the}} ICC applications [...] - [...] and delivered as an output. There are two broad categories of ICCs. Memory cards contain only non-volatile memory storage components, and perhaps some specific security logic. Microprocessor cards contain volatile memory and microprocessor components. The card is made of plastic, generally PVC, but sometimes ABS. The card may embed a hologram to avoid counterfeiting. Using smart cards is also a form of strong security authentication for single sign-on within large companies and organizations.|$|E

40|$|Smart cards, Chip <b>cards,</b> and <b>Integrated</b> <b>Circuit(s)</b> <b>Cards</b> (<b>ICC)</b> {{were invented}} and {{patented}} in the 70 s. A smart card is embedded {{with either a}} microprocessor and a memory chip or simply a memory chip with non-programmable logic. Today, there are three broad categories of smart cards: Microprocessor Cards, Memory Cards, and Optical Memory Cards. In the 90 s, the smart card prevailed, specifically, {{with the introduction of}} the smart-card-based Subscriber Identity Module (SIM) used in the Global System for Mobile Communications (GSM) mobile phone equipment in Europe. Since then smart cards proven to be the most efficient tools and rational solution for handling large and diverse transactions. The Smart Card proved applications are also constantly being extended with the increasing arithmetic power and storage capacity of available <b>integrated</b> <b>circuits.</b> Building a variety of functions and services in a single card is a key factor in successful implementation of smart-card applications. A multi-function smart-card application prototype that consists of a Health Card, an Electronic Purse and Access Control card is presented, with a focus on the Java Card Runtime Environment (JCRE), Object sharing, and the Applet firewalls. To demonstrate the Java Card Object Sharing Mechanism, sample codes are shown in this paper.

40|$|Abstract. <b>Integrated</b> <b>circuit</b> <b>cards</b> or {{smart cards}} are now well-known. Applications such as {{electronic}} purses (cash units stored in cards), subscriber identification cards used in cellular telephone or access keys for pay-TV and information highways emerge {{in many places}} with millions of users. More services are required by applications providers and card holders. Mainly, new <b>integrated</b> <b>circuit</b> <b>cards</b> evolve towards non-predefined multi-purpose, open and multi-user applications. Today, operating systems implemented into <b>integrated</b> <b>circuit</b> <b>cards</b> cannot respond to these new trends. They have evolved from simple operating systems defining an hardware abstraction level up to file management systems or database management systems where the card behavior was defined once at the manufacturing level or by the card issuer. The needs for open and flexible card life cycle enabling to accommodate executable code loaded by different service providers require {{a new generation of}} smart cards. Operating systems based on object-oriented technologies are key components for future <b>integrated</b> <b>circuit</b> <b>cards</b> applications...|$|R

In the first releases of IMS (before Release 7), the only authentication and key agreement (AKA) system which was specified by the 3 GPP was IMS-AKA.

The UMTS Subscriber Identity Module (USIM) and IMS Subscriber Identity Module (ISIM) are found on the Universal <b>Integrated</b> <b>Circuit</b> <b>Card</b> (UICC) of 3 G devices [28]. USIM-based IMS-AKA and ISIM-based IMS-AKA authentication require the phone to be equipped with the operator UICC card (i.e., a 3 G SIM card) with USIM or ISIM capability. In the absence of UICC (because of hardware limitation), ISIM can be provided as a software module on end devices (PCs).|$|R
