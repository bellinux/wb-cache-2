5|$|In {{addition}} to death occurring in pregnancy and childbirth, pregnancy {{can result in}} many non-fatal health problems including obstetrical fistulae, ectopic pregnancy, preterm labor, gestational diabetes, hyperemesis gravidarum, hypertensive states including preeclampsia, and anemia. Globally, complications of pregnancy vastly outway maternal deaths, with an estimated 9.5 million cases of pregnancy-related illness and 1.4 million near-misses (survival from severe life-threatening complications). Complications of pregnancy may be physical, mental, economic and social. It is estimated that 10–20 million women will develop physical or mental disability every year, resulting from complications of pregnancy or inadequate care. Consequently, <b>international</b> <b>agencies</b> have developed standards for obstetric care.|$|E
5|$|After {{the floods}} receded, Mexican President Ernesto Zedillo ordered the Department of National Defense to utilize all {{resources}} {{to assist the}} people affected by the floods. More than 94,000people stayed at 896shelters after being evacuated due to the floods. The federal government allocated $234million (2.34 billion pesos) in relief, which was smaller than the damage total. Widespread medical teams assisted {{tens of thousands of}} homes, and due to prevention measures, there were no outbreaks of diseases. Roads and electrical systems were gradually restored, and students returned to school after repairs were made. Residents throughout Mexico sent supplies to the Mexican Red Cross, including 500tons of food and water, and <b>international</b> <b>agencies</b> sent money and supplies to the flood victims.|$|E

5|$|Before Haruna struck Madagascar, a {{pre-existing}} system produced deadly flooding, {{and when}} the cyclone crossed the country, it added additional rainfall to the region. Flooding was worst in Toliara where a dyke burst, flooding much {{of the town and}} leaving residents without water or power. Many villages in southwestern Madagascar lost access to clean water, prompting various <b>international</b> <b>agencies</b> to deploy teams to decontaminate wells. Haruna destroyed 7,402houses, which left 13,882people homeless. Most of the displaced people were able to leave their shelters by early April. The cyclone damaged rice and maize crops along the coast, although there were extended residual effects when a locust outbreak occurred, affecting half of Madagascar's farmlands by July 2013. Throughout Madagascar, Haruna killed 26people and injured 127 directly, and there were outbreaks of various diseases in the storm's aftermath.|$|E
5|$|The Vietnamese {{leadership}} {{expected to}} reach these targets with economic aid from the Council for Mutual Economic Assistance (COMECON) and loans from <b>international</b> <b>agencies</b> of the capitalist world. The 4th National Congress {{made it clear that}} agriculture would be socialised; however, during the Second Five-Year Plan the socialisation measures went so badly that Võ Chí Công, a Politburo member and Chairman of the Committee for the Socialist Transformation of Agriculture, claimed {{it would be impossible to}} meet the targets set by the plan by 1980. An estimated 10,000 out of 13,246 socialist cooperatives, established during the plan, had collapsed in the South by 1980. Politburo member Lê Thanh Nghị attacked lower-level cadres for the failure of the socialist agriculture transformation. The collectivisation process led to an abrupt drop in food production in 1977 and 1978, leading the 6th Plenum of the Central Committee to completely overhaul the Party's agricultural policies.|$|E
5|$|Additional {{criticism}} continued even a {{week after}} the storm, especially over the scale of the disaster. The government claimed that only 27 people had been killed by Giri while numerous local and <b>international</b> <b>agencies</b> stated significantly higher totals. They were also blamed for downplaying the amount of damage, resulting in slower distribution of aid to areas in desperate need. Two weeks after Giri struck Myanmar, little attention was given to the ongoing disaster by the Junta. The Myanmar government continued to keep other countries out of the area and prevent them from knowing {{what was going on in}} the hardest hit areas. Thousands of survivors continued to suffer due to the insufficient relief making it into the region. On November8, local media discovered that the Junta was threatening to sever aid to the region if residents did not vote for them in the national election. According to Mizzima, the opposing party won landslide victories in numerous townships; however, in the cyclone affected areas, the Junta had complete victories.|$|E
