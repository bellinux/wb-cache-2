500|$|The Moche {{people of}} ancient Peru worshipped animals, and often {{depicted}} frogs in their art. In Panama, local legend held that good fortune {{would come to}} anyone who spotted a Panamanian <b>golden</b> <b>frog.</b> Some believed when one of these frogs died, it would turn into a golden talisman known as a huaca. Today, despite being extinct in the wild, Panamanian golden frogs remain an important cultural symbol and are illustrated on decorative cloth molas made by the Kuna people. They also appear [...] {{as part of the}} inlaid design on a new overpass in Panama City, on T-shirts, and even on lottery tickets.|$|E
500|$|The use of {{the common}} names [...] "frog" [...] and [...] "toad" [...] has no taxonomic justification. From a {{classification}} perspective, {{all members of the}} order Anura are frogs, but only members of the family Bufonidae are considered [...] "true toads". The {{use of the}} term [...] "frog" [...] in common names usually refers to species that are aquatic or semi-aquatic and have smooth, moist skins; the term [...] "toad" [...] generally refers to species that are terrestrial with dry, warty skins. There are numerous exceptions to this rule. The European fire-bellied toad (Bombina bombina) has a slightly warty skin and prefers a watery habitat whereas the Panamanian <b>golden</b> <b>frog</b> (Atelopus zeteki) is in the toad family Bufonidae and has a smooth skin.|$|E

The building's first curator was Raymond Lee Ditmars, who had kept 45 snakes in his attic before being hired at the zoo. The exhibit is a long hall with various terrariums situated on both sides. The exhibit also features a nursery area, which exhibits newborn herptiles born at the zoo, {{as well as a}} window into the off-show breeding and caring facilities. In the building, the zoo breeds and exhibits a wide range of endangered species, including Cuban crocodile, false gharial, yellow-headed day gecko, Mary River turtle, Fly River turtle, golden coin turtle, yellow-headed box turtle, Volcán Darwin giant tortoise (Chelonoidis nigra microphyes), Egyptian tortoise, pancake tortoise, Panamanian <b>golden</b> <b>frog,</b> and golden poison dart frog. The building also is home to the zoo's breeding population of Kihansi spray toads, which the zoo saved from extinction. Other species held include lace monitor, northern caiman lizard, Taylor's cantil, green anaconda, eyelash palm pitviper, giant snake-necked turtle, Chiapas giant musk turtle, and Solomon Island leaf frog. On March 25, 2011, a cobra escaped from its off-show enclosure, during which time the exhibit was closed to the public. Six days later, the animal was found elsewhere in the building. The zoo named the cobra [...] "MIA" [...] (Missing In Action) and placed it on-exhibit.|$|E
