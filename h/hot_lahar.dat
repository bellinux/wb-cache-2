2500|$|In {{the last}} 8,000 years, the Hotlum Cone has erupted {{at least eight}} or nine times. About 200 years ago the last {{significant}} Mount Shasta eruption came from this cone and created a pyroclastic flow, a <b>hot</b> <b>lahar</b> (mudflow), and three cold lahars, which streamed [...] down Mount Shasta's east flank via Ash Creek.

50|$|The 1893-94 Calbuco {{eruption}} {{was one of}} {{the largest}} ever to take place in southern Chile, with debris ejected to distances of eight kilometres, accompanied by voluminous <b>hot</b> <b>lahars.</b> In the strong explosions of April 1917, a lava dome formed in the crater accompanied by <b>hot</b> <b>lahars.</b> Another short explosive eruption in January 1929 also included an apparent pyroclastic flow and a lava flow.|$|R
2500|$|Calbuco is a {{stratovolcano}} {{in southern}} Chile, located southeast of Llanquihue Lake and northwest of Chapo Lake, in Los Lagos Region. The volcano {{and the surrounding}} area are protected within Llanquihue National Reserve. It is a very explosive andesite volcano that underwent edifice collapse in the late Pleistocene, producing a volcanic debris avalanche that reached the lake. [...] At least nine eruptions occurred since 1837, with the latest one in 1972. One of the largest historical eruptions in southern Chile took place there in 1893–1894. Violent eruptions ejected 30-cm bombs to distances of 8km from the crater, accompanied by voluminous <b>hot</b> <b>lahars.</b> Strong explosions occurred in April 1917, and a lava dome formed in the crater accompanied by <b>hot</b> <b>lahars.</b> Another short explosive eruption in January 1929 also included an apparent pyroclastic flow and a lava flow. The last major eruption of Calbuco, in 1961, sent ash columns 12–15km high and produced plumes that dispersed mainly to the southeast and two lava flows were also emitted. A minor, four-hour eruption happened on August 26, 1972. Strong fumarolic emission from the main crater was observed on August 12, 1996.|$|R
5000|$|In {{the last}} 8,000 years, the Hotlum Cone has erupted {{at least eight}} or nine times. About 200 years ago the last {{significant}} Mount Shasta eruption came from this cone and created a pyroclastic flow, a <b>hot</b> <b>lahar</b> (mudflow), and three cold lahars, which streamed 7.5 mi down Mount Shasta's east flank via Ash Creek.

50|$|Mount Shasta last {{erupted in}} 1786 {{and has been}} the most active volcano in California for about 4,000 years, erupting once every 300 years. The 1786 {{eruption}} created a pyroclastic flow, a lahar and three cold lahars, which streamed 7.5 mi down Shasta's east flank via Ash Creek. A separate <b>hot</b> <b>lahar</b> went 12 mi down Mud Creek.|$|E
40|$|This {{web page}} {{provides}} a first person {{account of a}} geologist's encounter with a lahar while surveying the Nima II river {{near the town of}} El Palmar in Guatemala, on August 14, 1989. Lahar is an Indonesian term that describes a hot or cold mixture of water and rock fragments flowing down the slopes of a volcano and (or) river valleys. While about 15 kilometers downstream from an active lava dome, Santiaguito (which is in the Santa Maria Volcano crater) the workers noticed a white steam cloud upriver. A very heavy rainstorm was passing through that area and they knew a <b>hot</b> <b>lahar</b> was likely to be on the way. They secured their equipment and were able to gain a perch on a nearby bridge with their cameras. After witnessing a <b>hot</b> <b>lahar</b> passing underneath they retreated to high ground. The account is illustrated with 4 photographs.

40|$|Electro-magnetic {{studies have}} been {{conducted}} to investigate the volcanic activity of Mt. Yakedake locating in the Norikura volcanic chain in central Japan. Preliminary results were obtained as follows; 1. The measurement was made on the total magnetic force and the surface resistivity at the Shiramizudani area, the half up of Mt. Yakedake. The analitical results obtained elucidate the spatial distribution of both volcanic sediments and mud flow deposits around this area. 2. The paleomagnetic method was developed to investigate the temperature conditions when the volcanic sediments were embeded. The method was applied to classify the volcanic sediments (originated from Nakao pyroclastic flow c. a. 2500 to 1500 years B. P.) into three types; pyroclastic flow deposit, <b>hot</b> <b>lahar</b> deposit and cold lahar deposit. 3. Three observatory stations were established for the continuous monitoring of electric self-potential, geomagnetic total force, ground temperature and steam temperature conditions around the Yakedake area. Preliminary data observed at Nakao Station, the foot of Mt. Yakedake, show that the short-term fluctuations of the electric potential correlate quite well with these of the temperature changes of steam rising from 300 m depth. During the period of the above fluctuation, small earthquakes were observed around the Yakedake area in most cases...|$|E
