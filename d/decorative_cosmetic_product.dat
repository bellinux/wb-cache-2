40|$|The {{cosmetic}} industry in Malaysia {{is proven to}} be one of the important economy sources. Lipstick is one of the <b>decorative</b> <b>cosmetic</b> <b>products</b> that command a unique market. The quality of lipstick is directly linked to the basic material used in the formulation. The ratio of the ingredients used determines the final product characteristics. In previous researches, statistical mixture design has been proved to be effective tool to investigate the relationship between variables in formulation work. Contour graphics were formed to assess the change in the response surface in order to understand the relationship between the product cost and consumer acceptance of the lipsticks. In this work, natural waxes, solvents and colorant were used to prepare lipstick formulation. Statistical mixture design has been applied for experimental setting for the components system. The effects of the mixture components on the physical properties and consumer acceptance of the lipstick have been investigated. The results indicate that the physical properties of the lipstick can be manipulated by changing the composition of the base ingredient used in the formulation. It was found that the variation of the mixture component affected the consumer acceptance on lipstick`s rub-off characteristic...|$|R
30|$|The classifications {{presented}} here {{tend to be}} under-classifications to outline the best case, not the worst case. As I {{did not have the}} comprehensive data base like the producers of the respective products, I deliberately made the following assumptions which may lead to less severe classifications: (1) Where self classifications of various companies differed in several H-statements, I used the classification which the majority of companies agreed upon, which was usually not the most severe classification. (2) In most basic recipes no specific chemical names were given for preservatives, colorants, pigments or fragrances. In these cases I did not consider them at all, although it is known that most of them are hazardous substances. (3) I did not consider any potential contaminations, impurities or stabilizers/preservatives as part of an ingredient as I assume that they are present below the cut off values ([1] Annex I 1.1. 4.1). (4) I pretended that all properties of all ingredients are known and did not make use of the possibility to subtract substances with unknown properties ([1] Annex I 3.1. 3.6. 2). However, when no information could be retrieved for more than 20 % of the total product, products were not considered further. Most <b>decorative</b> <b>cosmetic</b> <b>products</b> which contained up to 10 % of unnamed pigments reached this limit and could not be analyzed further. Also natural ingredients pose problems for the correct classification, as the available information is scanter than for synthetic ingredients. Some ingredients do not have a CAS or EC number and could not be investigated further. Products which contained more than 80 % water were not considered if half of the remaining ingredients were unclear. (5) I pretended that the pH values are in a medium range and not extremely low or high. Therefore, I did not consider pH-effects of mixtures. (6) I pretended that diluted ingredients are diluted with water and not with any other solvent. (7) I had no information about the physical properties like thermal stability, heat of combustion, flash point or boiling point of the mixtures. I assumed that these properties were not crucial for <b>cosmetic</b> <b>products</b> and considered only the physical hazards of aerosol dispensers. (8) When the components were heated to allow chemical reactions before preparation of the final product (e.g. for soap production) I considered neither the raw material nor the reaction products.|$|R

Objectives: To explore consumers' perspectives toward <b>cosmetic</b> <b>products.</b> Methods: An interview guide was developed with a set of 12 semistructured questions. Participants in Kuantan, Pahang were recruited via the purposive sampling, and they undergo in-depth face-to-face interviews. All of the interviews were audio-recorded, transcribed verbatim, and were analyzed via thematic content analysis. Results: For the awareness of <b>cosmetic</b> <b>products,</b> less aware about the <b>cosmetic</b> <b>products</b> in Malaysia were noted among the participants. In terms of perceptions about the <b>cosmetic</b> <b>products,</b> participants expressed positive perceptions toward natural <b>cosmetic</b> <b>products,</b> quality were seen as synonymous with branded products and halal certification. Next, for the attitude toward the use of <b>cosmetic</b> <b>products,</b> participants were influenced by ingredients, product brand, and halal certification. Based on personal experiences, they provide complaints and suggestions for the enhancement of cosmetic products' quality. Conclusions: Participants were found to have less awareness about the <b>cosmetic</b> <b>products</b> in Malaysia. Besides, they realized about the chemical ingredients and halal certification for the <b>cosmetic</b> <b>products.</b> Therefore, they held positive perceptions and practiced positive attitudes toward natural and halal <b>cosmetic</b> <b>products.</b> Finally, adverse reactions from the use of <b>cosmetic</b> <b>products</b> were commonly experienced by the participants, which contributed mainly by the ingredients. Thus, they hoped for serious approached to be enacted to solve this problem...|$|R

The aim of this project is to assist the shoppers to identify which the closest pharmacy that offer their desired <b>cosmetic</b> <b>products.</b> In this project, Rapid Application Development (RAD) methodology is used to develop this prototype because it provides faster development, gives high and maintain the quality of software and reduce development cost.

As the significance of this project, it helped the users to save their time searching for their preferred <b>cosmetic</b> <b>products.</b> In addition, it reduced their travelling time and cost as they know already the location of the pharmacy that sell their preferred <b>cosmetic</b> <b>products.</b> Besides, this project helped to reduce their stress because their <b>cosmetic</b> <b>products</b> are easily accessible at the pharmacy. The recommendation in the future is this project should cover other assortment sort of <b>cosmetic</b> <b>products.</b> Moreover, this project should expect to identify the closest pharmacy that offer different domains such as skincare, personal care and healthcare.

40|$|Background: The use of methylisothiazolinone (MI) in <b>cosmetic</b> <b>products</b> {{has caused}} an {{unprecedented}} epidemic of MI contact allergy. Current data concerning exposures at a European level are required. Objectives: To describe demographics and MI exposures for European patients with MI contact allergy. Methods: Eleven European dermatology departments from eight European countries prospectively collected data between 1 May and 31 October 2015 among consecutive {{patients who had}} positive patch test reactions to MI (2000 ppm aq.). Results: A total of 6. 0 % (205 / 3434; range 2. 6 - 13. 0 %) of patients had positive patch test reactions to MI. Dermatitis most frequently affected the hands (43. 4 %), face (32. 7 %), arms (14. 6 %), and eyelids (11. 7 %); 12. 7 % had widespread dermatitis. For 72. 7 % (149 / 205), MI contact allergy was currently relevant mainly because of exposure to <b>cosmetic</b> <b>products</b> (83. 2 %; 124 / 149). Of these 124 patients, 19. 5 % were exposed to leave-on and rinse-off <b>cosmetic</b> <b>products,</b> 24. 8 % only to leave-on <b>cosmetic</b> <b>products</b> and 38. 9 % only to rinse-off <b>cosmetic</b> <b>products</b> containing MI or methylchloroisothiazolinone/MI.

The information could contribute to the assessment of whether current EU legislation on cosmetics provides adequate protection. Patients/methods: General practitioners, dermatologists and consumers in The Netherlands completed questionnaires on reported undesirable effects of cosmetics.

Results: Between July 2009 and May 2011, the RIVM received more than 1600 reports. Severe undesirable effects were claimed in 1 – 4 % of the cases.
