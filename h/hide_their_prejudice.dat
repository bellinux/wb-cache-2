50|$|Although, {{research}} has shown that motivation and an opportunity to react carefully can affect how much implicit attitudes influence behavioral response, Fazio (2001). When individuals are highly motivated to control their responses and processing abilities are not lacking or preoccupied, behavioral responses tend to reflect intentional processes. In Towles-schwen and Fazio (2003) they measured anticipated willingness and discomfort of participants to interact with a black person. Individuals who were motivated to avoid interracial conflicts and where not concerned about seeming biased expressed their discomfort; whereas individuals who were concerned about not appearing biased reported less anticipated discomfort, in an attempt to <b>hide</b> <b>their</b> <b>prejudice.</b> Motivation to control our responses can minimize the influence of implicit attitudes on behavioral responses as shown by that example.|$|E

Giannozzo here, and I, I flatter myself, are able to overcome that suspicion; we have that power of concealment and finesse, without which a rational cultivated man, instead of having any prerogative, is really at a disadvantage compared with a wild bull or a savage. But, except yourself, I know of no one else on whom we could rely for the necessary discretion." ...|$|R

50|$|Accountability {{and value}} consistency.Some {{prejudice}} reduction strategies rely on creating {{a sense of}} internal conflict. One such strategy involves holding people accountable for <b>their</b> <b>prejudice.</b> Prejudice {{has been shown to}} decrease when people are asked to provide concrete reasons for prejudiced beliefs. The process of generating these reasons gets people to consider the irrational nature of <b>their</b> <b>prejudiced</b> beliefs. Another strategy is to get people to view prejudice as being inconsistent with their behaviors or valued attitudes. This creates cognitive dissonance, and people attempt to resolve this tension by reducing expressions of prejudice. For example, after agreeing to write a public statement advocating a policy that is beneficial to racial minorities but costly to whites, whites report more personal support for this policy than before being asked to write the public statement.|$|R

It was proposed that when people interact with the target of <b>their</b> <b>prejudice,</b> they will experience stress and the aftereffects of stress {{will lead to a}} decrement in Stroop task performance and a lower likelihood of helping someone in need.
