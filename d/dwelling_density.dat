40|$|Higher <b>dwelling</b> <b>densities</b> in low density {{cities such}} as Adelaide are being widely {{promoted}} by planners, policy-makers and academics to reduce travel time, increase accessibility and consolidate space within the existing urban area. This is largely {{in response to the}} negative impacts of 'urban sprawl' in suburban, car oriented cities in Australia and the United States. Mawson Lakes, in Adelaide, South Australia, has had a lot of marketing hype as the place to 'live, work and play', and the diverse housing options offered come in stark contrast to typical suburban housing developments constructed in the past. This research explored residents‟ level of satisfaction with this new urbanist development style, and drew comparisons to the similarly timed, suburban Blackwood Park development in the suburb of Craigburn Farm, South Australia. This study finds that higher density housing in Mawson Lakes delivered reduced levels of dwelling satisfaction, particularly in the areas of privacy, open space and value for money when compared with larger, detached homes in both developments. However, with respect to neighbourhood factors, this study finds that Mawson Lakes delivers greater levels of neighbourhood satisfaction, particularly in the areas of proximity to work, public transport services, shopping, and restaurants and cafés. This comes despite higher levels of residential dis-satisfaction in Mawson lakes, specifically in relation to concerns surrounding noise, pollution and safety. This project is significant because changes toward a focus of new urbanist development requires adjustments in beliefs and perceptions and will only be sustainable if higher density developments are places where the people of Adelaide want to live. Considering the strong focus toward increasing densities within the 30 Year Plan for Greater Adelaide, this project provides some insight into how changes to development influence subjective perceptions of Residential Satisfaction. In particular, this project demonstrates that while higher <b>dwelling</b> <b>densities</b> are not generally associated with the dream home that the people of Adelaide seek to achieve towards the end of their housing career; the improved accessibility associated with higher density establishes some positive outcomes in relation to neighbourhood satisfaction, despite greater awareness of the sources of dis-satisfaction.

40|$|BACKGROUND: Evidence of {{associations}} between neighborhood built environments and transport-related physical activity (PA) is accumulating, but {{few studies have}} investigated associations with leisure-time PA. OBJECTIVE: We investigated associations of five objectively measured characteristics of the neighborhood built environment-destination access, street connectivity, <b>dwelling</b> <b>density,</b> land-use mix and streetscape quality-with residents' self-reported PA (transport, leisure, and walking) and accelerometer-derived measures of PA. METHODS: Using a multicity stratified cluster sampling design, we conducted a cross-sectional survey of 2, 033 adults who lived in 48 New Zealand neighborhoods. Multilevel regression modeling, which was adjusted for individual-level (sociodemographic and neighborhood preference) and neighborhood-level (deprivation) confounders, was used to estimate associations of built environment with PA. RESULTS: We found that 1 -SD increases in destination access, street connectivity, and <b>dwelling</b> <b>density</b> were associated with any versus no self-reported transport, leisure, or walking PA, with increased odds ranging from 21 % [street connectivity with leisure PA, 95 % confidence interval (CI) : 0 %, 47 %] to 44 % (destination accessibility with walking, 95 % CI: 17 %, 79 %). Among participants who self-reported some PA, a 1 -SD increase in street connectivity {{was associated with a}} 13 % increase in leisure PA (95 % CI: 0, 28 %).

Urban density patterns were spatially explored using a 1 X 1 kilometre grid that reflects the spatial variability and levels of densification within the urban growth boundary. Two techniques were employed to capture {{the change in}} <b>dwelling</b> <b>density.</b> First, a buffer analysis is used to test the difference in the <b>dwelling</b> <b>density</b> patterns between different buffer zones generated around the Melbourne CBD and the &# 039;activity centres&# 039;.

Second, the densification proposed in the plan to encourage more multi-level/unit developments has been measured using a spatial autocorrelation measure. The results for this part reveal a decline in the Moran&# 039;s I computed for 2001 and 2006. This might suggest that densification is just not restricted to the target areas (e. g. activity centres) as the evidence of higher density housing development can be seen widely across the metropolis...|$|E
40|$|The {{incidence}} of change to existing houses and gardens within England's interwar residential areas is examined, the focus being on sample areas originally developed by private enterprise in Birmingham and London. Larger-scale changes, mostly subject to development control {{by the local}} authority, notably the building of additional houses within existing gardens, subdivisions and amalgamations of houses, changes of use, extensions and other significant structural works, are distinguished from changes initiated by households without planning permission, and often without building permission, such as changes to chimneys, reroofing, and changes to doors, windows, porches, and gardens. Changes subject to development control are negatively correlated, and smaller-scale changes are positively correlated, with the <b>dwelling</b> <b>density</b> at which the sample areas were originally developed. Among the factors responsible for this are the greater susceptibility of the areas of higher <b>dwelling</b> <b>density</b> to the contagious diffusion of minor and cosmetic changes. ...|$|E

40|$|Abstract – Spatial scale {{analysis}} for disparate geospatial data is facilitated by object-based reasoning and analysis. This paper introduces a wavelet transform-based approach for {{remotely sensed images}} and a variogram approach for areal census data; both stress objects as the core for performing scale analysis. By calculating a series of statistics from wavelet transform-based sub-images and energy signature images, {{it was found that}} with energy signature images, the approximate characteristic scale of scene variation can be suggested by the change rate of the standard deviation over two successive decomposition resolutions (∆SD/∆R). Four simulated fine spatial resolution images having different object specifications were analysed and in each case the method identified the approximate characteristic size of the salient objects in the image. An accurate result can be obtained more easily using the range of geostatistical variograms. For areal census data, we correlate census dwelling data and image structural information. By calculating variograms at individual areal units rather than at a whole scene level, high correlations exist between variogram sills and <b>dwelling</b> <b>densities</b> of individual areal units. Thus, dwelling attributes across arbitrary areal units can be interpolated and scaled. This paper concludes that such scale analyses in a modern, digital spatial analysis environment should still conform to the classical principle of cartographic scale transform; that is, scale association with object representation. Using geostatistics for examining the cognate relations between scale and objects holds promise...|$|R
40|$|Numerous {{studies have}} {{identified}} associations between the surface urban heat island (SUHI) effect (i. e., SUHI, hereinafter {{is referred to}} as UHI) and urban growth, particularly changes in land cover patterns. This research questions their causal links to answer a key policy question: If cities restrict urban expansion and encourage people to live within existing urban areas, will that help in controlling UHI? The question has been answered by estimating four models using data from Brisbane, Australia: - Model 1 — cross-sectional ordinary least square (OLS) regression —to examine the association between the UHI effect and land cover patterns in 2013; - Model 2 — cross-sectional geographically weighted regression (GWR) —to examine whether the outputs generated from Model 1 possess significant spatial variations; - Model 3 — longitudinal OLS —to examine whether changes in land cover patterns led to changes in UHI effects between 2004 and 2013, and; - Model 4 — longitudinal GWR —to examine whether the outputs generated from Model 3 vary significantly over space. All estimations were controlled for potential confounding effects (e. g., population, employment and <b>dwelling</b> <b>densities).</b> Results from the cross-sectional OLS and GWR models were consistent with previous findings and showed that porosity is negatively associated with the UHI effect in 2013. In contrast, population density has a positive association. Results from the longitudinal OLS and GWR models confirm their causal linkages and showed that an increase in porosity level reduced the UHI effect, whereas an increase in population density increased the UHI effect. The findings suggest that even a containment of population growth within existing urban areas will lead to the UHI effect. However, this can be significantly minimized through proper land use planning, by creating a balance between urban and non-urban uses of existing urban areas...|$|R

In particular, by applying spatial hedonic models at the census tract level, this study examines the association between house prices and three neighborhood characteristics: crime rates, subway ridership and <b>dwelling</b> <b>density.</b> House prices were first explored by cluster analysis at multiple listing service (MLS) district level and results showed a significant spatial clustering of the prices in Toronto. Spatial hedonic models were then conducted on census tract level to examine the role of neighborhood characteristics in explaining the spatial patterns. The spatial mode was applied both across the entire city and separately in three neighborhoods divided by income level. Findings indicate that on the citywide scale, crime rates and <b>dwelling</b> <b>density</b> do not significantly influence house prices, but subway ridership was positively associated with house prices. In the middle-income neighborhood, six types of crime were found to significantly decrease house prices. Densities of all types of dwelling were found to be positively associated with house prices while apartment density decreases house prices in the middle-income neighborhood. Findings from this research can be applied to inform housing and transportation policies, regarding neighborhood improvement, housing affordability and smart growth. 4 month...|$|E

40|$|Over {{the past}} decade there has been {{mounting}} evidence of the significant {{role played by the}} myriad attributes of our city's built environments in shaping our health and well-being. This thesis hypothesizes that the constituent components of the built environment, especially the configuration and design of land uses and street networks governs the distribution of resources and services, configures the neighbourhood activity space, and thereby influences individual physical activity behaviours, social interactions, weight outcomes as well as mental health and well being. Enhanced accessibility to health-promoting community resources improves local opportunities for physical activity, thereby enhancing mobility, social interactions and independence as well as reducing isolation. The first section of this thesis conceptualizes the urban health niche as a novel holistic and spatially-explicit paradigm in public health and proposes a health niche model of healthy city. Based on the proposed paradigm and gathered research evidence, multilevel data sets pertaining to health, socio-economic, built and natural environment have been produced and integrated together to constitute the high resolution database, spatial Design Network Analysis for Urban Health (sDNA-UH). sDNA-UH has been developed for the assembly constituency of Caerphilly, South Wales enabling operationalization of the spatial elements of the proposed urban health niche. State-of-the-art spatial and network analysis techniques have been employed upon the UK Ordnance Survey Mastermap data layers to quantify the various facets of urban built environment in the form of built environment morphological metrics (morphometrics) with the potential to influence individual's health. Based on the developed sDNA-UH, a series of three empirical studies comprising multilevel cross-sectional and longitudinal models have been presented which examine the association between specific attributes of a built environment and health outcomes. Firstly, a two-part multi-level regression model was employed to examine the impact of built environment configuration upon psychological distress. Land use mix, density of amenities, local street-network general accessibility (‘betweenness’) and slope variability were identified as significant predictors. Secondly, the first long-term longitudinal evidence relating the built environment to change in obesity in older people identified land use mix, density of amenities street network accessibility and slope variability as significant predictors. The third study examined the health effects of differential accessibility of an individual's dwelling with respect to multiple service and facility catchments at multiple spatial scales. <b>Dwelling</b> level <b>density,</b> <b>dwelling</b> type, <b>density</b> of community services, street network movement potential expressed in terms of betweenness index as well as neighbourhood-level deprivation were identified as the significant parameters. The study reported significant differences in point estimates and level of significance when comparing the two spatial scales of 0. 5 and 1. 0 mile street network catchments. The empirical evidence thus generated lends support to the thesis’ principal hypothesis that the built environment influences individual health behaviour and eventually health. The research concludes that optimized design and planning of urban built environments act as effective public health intervention in our goal of health-sustaining communities and a healthy city...|$|R
40|$|Objective: Many {{research}} papers {{examine the relationship}} of the built environment on transport behaviour using only one mode of transport. Yet to inform policy makers, a broader examination of transport mode choice across different transport modes is required. Here, associations between urban design attributes and transport mode choices including transport walking, transport cycling, public transport and private motor vehicle use were explored. Methods Secondary analysis was conducted on 16, 890 participants aged 18 years or older who participated in the Victorian Integrated Survey of Travel Activity 2009 - 2010 (VISTA 09) in metropolitan Melbourne, Australia. Adjusted multilevel logistic regression models were used to explore the relationship between urban design attributes and transport-walking, cycling, public transport and private motor vehicle use. Results Taking transport-walking, cycling or public transport trips was positively associated with the housing diversity score and gross <b>dwelling</b> <b>density.</b> Taking private motor vehicle trips was negatively associated with street connectivity, land use mix, local living score, housing diversity score, gross <b>dwelling</b> <b>density</b> and proximity to supermarkets.

40|$|The {{analysis}} of refugee and IDP (internally displaced persons) camps from VHSR (very high spatial resolution) satellite imagery can assist humanitarian relief organisations by providing population estimations and camp structure analysis based on automated dwelling extraction. Since smooth transferability of rulesets {{in a fine}} scale and high complexity environment is limited, we present an approach of developing and transferring master rulesets. The master ruleset aims to automate OBIA (object-based image analysis) tasks which {{can be seen as}} more or less independent from different sensors and geographic areas, such as adapted segmentations based on edge densities to delineate man-made structures or classifications based on shape and context. Only some steps within the classification process which are based on hard-coded values (size constraints, spectral thresholds) have to be adapted. This approach reduces the time required to analyse different IDP camps or the same camp at different times. In previous work, the master ruleset has been developed for the IDP camp Zam Zam in Darfur, Sudan, using QuickBird imagery. In the study presented, the transferability of object-based image analysis rulesets was tested in a demonstrator exercise according to a request posed by the World Food Program (WFP).

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study is to assess the {{strengths}} and weaknesses of the municipal ofﬁcial plans to protect provincially evaluated wetlands from activities causing non-point source pollution within the Grand River watershed. An integrated framework for policy analysis involving both an evaluative and normative approach assists in determining the value of wetland protection policies and recommends future actions to guide decision-making on development adjacent to wetlands. Speciﬁcally, the objectives include (a) to locate, identify and measure the total wetland area, class and number of wetlands in the Grand River watershed on an upper- and lower-tier municipal basis; (b) to evaluate the extent of adjacent areas contributing surface water contamination to the wetlands in the Grand River watershed on an upper- and lower- tier municipal basis and by individual municipalities, thus establishing the risk due to degradation from non-point source pollution; (c) to determine the pressures of development by examining the changes in population and <b>dwelling</b> <b>density</b> from 1986 - 1994; (d) to identify the strengths and weaknesses of municipal governments from the viewpoint of the staff to implement municipal policies on wetlands; (e) to review and assess municipal official plans for wetlands, natural areas or hazard land policies to determine whether the municipalities effectively protect wetlands; and (f) to provide insight, based on this research, to guide protection or rehabilitation of wetlands at risk from non-point source pollution. Mapping showed that 7. 2 % of the watershed is covered by 220 named and evaluated wetlands. Seventy-one percent are provincially signiﬁcant and distributed within three-quarters of the lower-tier municipalities, mainly towns townships. Large portions of these natural areas are shared by neighbouring municipalities. All municipalities within the watershed experienced a growth in population and an increase in <b>dwelling</b> <b>density</b> during the period of wetland policy implementation. The largest population and <b>dwelling</b> <b>density</b> increases occurred in cities and villages or their adjacent municipalities. Generally, official plans policies throughout the watershed needs some improvement. Regional municipalities had the most adequate, while villages tended to have the least effective policies, given the lack of wetlands in these municipalities. The Grand River Conservation Authority and the Ontario Ministry of Natural Resources are considered to be the agencies with the expertise and strength to protect wetlands. Half of all respondents to the municipal staff survey do not have the resources to effectively protect wetlands due to inadequate finances and a lack of staff expertise in environmental issues. Disinterested landowners and a lack of understanding the value of wetlands are also impediments to wetland protection. Education and awareness programs for the public were considered beneﬁcial. The thesis concludes with several recommendations which may assist the Province and municipalities to develop planning initiatives to effectively and efficiently protect the remaining wetlands in the Grand River watershed...|$|E

The data from the study are presented to investigate the relationship of these objectives to the reactions of residents living in neighborhoods of varying densities.

5000|$|The Undue Subdivision of Land Prevention Act 1885, {{introduced}} to avoid [...] "slum" [...] conditions {{in areas of}} medium <b>density</b> <b>dwellings,</b> effectively limited the construction of terraces in Queensland. The limit of a minimum size of 16 perches (405 m2) for allotment subdivisions firmly established the detached house as the standard dwelling. While some terrace houses were built by property speculators as rentals in Brisbane after 1885 (most notably The Mansions [...] ), these dwellings could not be sold individually. Other than Harris Terrace, only two other terrace houses constructed in the 1860s, Athol Place, Spring Hill and Princess Row, Petrie Terrace, survive in Brisbane.|$|R
40|$|In {{promoting}} urban consolidation, Australia’s strategic urban {{plans have}} the unintended consequence of reducing, if not eliminating, an individual household’s capacity to directly engage with new dwelling production. Contrasts {{exist between the}} production processes of a free-standing home, typically constructed to contract, and that of a multi-unit building, typically speculatively designed and sold off-the-plan; with the latter removing the capacity for future occupants to directly influence dwelling function or design. Hence, in providing a vision of higher-density urban communities, Australia’s strategic urban plans arguably contribute to a disjunction between the function of higher-density dwellings and the individual households who seek to call them home. In response, {{a small number of}} Australian households and industry professionals have proposed alternative production processes to realise multi-unit housing suited to future occupants’ collective needs. This thesis examines the relational network of social and technical actors in existing multi-unit housing development. Structures of housing provision are visualised through an actor-network lens, and network relations are analysed to identify which (or what) network actors (or actants) influence design decisions, particularly regarding dwelling function and cost. The existing actor-network is compared with those of four alternative Australian cases. Employing both network analysis and primary interview data, impediments to collective self-organised housing in Australia are identified. Comparison of the actor-networks of the alternative cases recognises different types of network change in each case, reflecting participants’ motivations and resources, with associated variation in outcomes. Means of addressing the impediments identified in the Australian cases are drawn from two international cases, building groups in Berlin, Germany and collective custom build in the United Kingdom. The thesis argues successful consolidation of the Australian Dream advocated by contemporary urban planning policies requires that future residents be provided with greater capacity to influence design decision-making within the multi-unit structure of housing provision. Drawing lessons from the alternative cases, it proposes reconfiguring the actor-network of multi-unit housing to enable this to occur. The comparison of Australian and international case studies builds knowledge applicable to the development of policies and programs promoting collective self-organised housing in Australia, with relevance also to other <b>dwelling</b> <b>densities.</b> The actor-network visualisations developed to represent the structures of housing provision under examination in this thesis provide unique insights in these cases and, with further development, may prove equally useful to other research examining the complex web of social and technical actors in housing systems.
