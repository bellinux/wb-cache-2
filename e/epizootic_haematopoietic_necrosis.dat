50|$|A {{main purpose}} of the CRL is {{to ensure the quality}} of {{diagnostics}} of fish diseases in EU Member States and to harmonise the procedures and methodologies applied. The work is mainly concerned with the exotic (<b>Epizootic</b> <b>Haematopoietic</b> <b>Necrosis</b> Virus and Epizootic Ulcerative Syndrome) and non-exotic (Viral hemorrhagic septicemia, Infectious hematopoietic necrosis virus, Koi herpes virus, and Infectious salmon anemia virus) diseases mentioned in Council Directive 2006/88/EC. The CRL co-ordinates those activities of the National Reference Laboratories (NRLs) for Fish diseases in EU that aim to harmonise diagnostic techniques and disseminate information of mutual interest. The work of the CRL also includes development of a database (Fishpathogens.eu) that aims to collect information on fish disease isolates and their sequences. Details of the work programme is decided at the Annual Meeting of the NRLs for Fish Diseases.|$|E
40|$|A {{quantitative}} real-time PCR (qPCR) {{based on}} a standard curve was developed for detection and quantitation of ranaviruses. The target gene for the qPCR was viral DNA polymerase (DNApol). All ten ranavirus isolates studied (<b>Epizootic</b> <b>haematopoietic</b> <b>necrosis</b> virus, EHNV; European catfish virus, ECV; European sheatfish virus, ESV; Frog virus 3, FV 3; Bohle iridovirus, BIV; Doctor fish virus, DFV; Guppy virus 6, GV 6; Pike-perch iridovirus, PPIV; Rana esculenta virus Italy 282 /I 02, REV 282 /I 02 and Short-finned eel ranavirus, SERV) were detected with the qPCR assay. In addition, two fish cell lines – epithelioma papulosum cyprini (EPC) and bluegill fry (BF- 2) – were infected with four of the isolates (EHNV, ECV, FV 3 and DFV), and the viral quantity was determined from seven time points {{during the first three}} days after infection.

40|$|Two iridovirus {{isolates}} {{recovered from}} cod (Gadus morhua) and turbot (Psetta maxima) in Denmark {{were examined in}} parallel with a panel of other ranaviruses including frog virus 3 (FV 3), the reference strain for the genus Ranavirus. The isolates were assessed according to their reactivity in immunofluoresent antibody tests (IFAT) using both homologous and heterologous antisera and their amplification in PCR using primers targeting five genomic regions. The corresponding PCR fragments were sequenced, and the sequences obtained were used in phylogenetic analysis. In addition, the pathogenicity to rainbow trout under experimental challenge conditions was investigated. The viruses were serologically and genetically closely related to highly pathogenic ranaviruses such as European catfish iridovirus (ECV), European sheatfish iridovirus (ESV) and <b>epizootic</b> <b>haematopoietic</b> <b>necrosis</b> virus (EHNV).

The model investigated intraperitoneal (IP), bath and cohabitation routes at 10, 15 and 20 C for 5 – 6 g fish and 15 C for 20 g perch. In the IP challenges of perch, significant mortality occurred at 15 C and 20 C. In challenge trials for rainbow trout, significant mortalities were observed in IP and bath challenges at 20 C. The mortality observed in IP challenged 20 g perch was {{not significantly different from}} that recorded for 6 g fish challenged IP. No significant mortality was observed in any other treatment groups. Re-isolation of ranavirus was confirmed by IFAT and was consistently associated with dead or moribund fish in the trial groups challenged with EHNV.

40|$|Ranaviruses are {{considered}} {{a serious threat to}} lower vertebrates, including fish, amphibians and reptiles. However, epidemiological data on these agents are lacking, and further investigations are needed to understand the role of carriers and to update the list of susceptible hosts. We carried out various experimental infections under controlled conditions to contribute to the current knowledge on the susceptibility of black bullhead Ameiurus melas to European catfish virus (ECV) and other ranaviruses. A panel of 7 ranavirus isolates was used to challenge duplicate groups of A. melas juveniles maintained in aquaria supplied with running dechlorinated tap water. The experiments were performed at 15 and 25 degrees C. The results confirmed the high susceptibility of A. melas to ECV infection. Furthermore, a significant mortality associated with the typical signs of systemic viral infections was observed in groups challenged with <b>Epizootic</b> <b>haematopoietic</b> <b>necrosis</b> virus (EHNV) at 25 degrees C, and to a lesser extent, at 15 degrees C.

40|$|Transcription {{in vitro}} by the RNA {{polymerase}} of infectious <b>haematopoietic</b> <b>necrosis</b> virus (IHNV), a salmonid rhabdovirus, was investigated using different reaction conditions to maximize RNA synthesis. The use of HEPES buffer rather than Tris buffer, {{and the addition}} of S-adenosyl-L-methionine to the reactions resulted in a sixfold increase in RNA synthetic activity to 6400 pmol UMP incorporated/mg viral protein/hour. The RNA transcripts produced in this system contained polyadenylated species which co-migrated with IHNV mRNA species 2, 3, 4 and 5 from IHNVinfected cells. The transcripts were shown to be functional mRNA species by their ability to direct the synthesis of viral proteins in vitro. Infectious <b>haematopoietic</b> <b>necrosis</b> virus (IHNV) is a rhabdovirus which infects salmon and trout and causes great economic losses in fish hatcheries in western North America (Pilcher & Fryer, 1978).

40|$|In {{order to}} study the {{pathogenicity}} of ranaviruses to a wild European freshwater fish species, pike Esox lucius fry were challenged with the following Ranavirus isolates: <b>epizootic</b> <b>haematopoietic</b> <b>necrosis</b> virus (EHNV), European sheatfish virus (ESV), European catfish virus (ECV), pike-perch iridovirus (PPIV), New Zealand eel virus (NZeelV) and frog virus 3 (FV 3). The fry were infected using bath challenge at 12 and 22 °C. Significant mortalities were observed at 12 °C for EHNV, ESV, PPIV and NZeelV. Background mortality was too high in the experiments performed at 22 °C for any conclusions about viral pathogenicity at this temperature to be drawn. Viruses could be re-isolated from samples from all challenged groups, and their presence in infected tissue was demonstrated using immunohistochemistry. The findings suggest that pike fry are susceptible to EHNV, ESV, PPIV and NZeelV and can be a vector for ECV and FV 3. Statistical analysis of the factors associated with positive virus re-isolation showed {{that the number of}} fish in the sample influenced the outcome of virus re-isolation. Moreover, the likelihood of positive virus re-isolation significantly differed among the 6 viral isolates.

Pike-perch fry were bath-challenged at 12 °C and 22 °C at 5 weeks post hatching, and the challenge was repeated with EHNV and PPIV in older fish (15 weeks post hatching) at higher densities. A third batch of fish was subjected to intraperitoneal (i. p.) and cohabitation challenge with EHNV, ESV, ECV and PPIV at 16 °C. Statistically significant mortality was observed in EHNV-challenged fish at both temperatures in the five week old fish. No mortalities were seen in older fish challenged with EHNV and PPIV. High mortalities were registered in i. p. -challenged fish, but not in cohabitated fish. Virus re-isolation was possible from the youngest bath-challenged fish in all challenge trials and the i. p. -challenged fish, but not from older fish or cohabitated fish.

A gene probe for Bohle iridovirus (BIV) based upon primers designed to detect <b>epizootic</b> <b>haematopoietic</b> <b>necrosis</b> virus (EHNV) was constructed. A PCR and dot-blot system was used successfully in screening {{for the presence of}} BIV nucleic acid in digested formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded amphibian tissues. Juvenile frogs were more susceptible to BIV than adults. In experimental challenges and epizootics in captive frogs, juvenile Litoria caerulea, L. alboguttata, Cyclorana brevipes and Pseudophryne coriacea were acutely susceptible. High mortality (at or near 100 %) resulted, usually occurring within 5 to 25 d depending on dose and method of exposure. Histopathological changes included mainly hepatic, renal and splenic necroses. Significant haemosiderosis was encountered in more chronically infected frogs. BIV could be reisolated from juvenile L. caerulea > 40 d after inoculation, and > 200 d after the first mortalities occurred in an epizootic in L. alboguttata. Adult L. rubella, L. inermis, L. caerulea, Cophixalus ornatus and Taudactylus acutirostris were less susceptible in trials ranging from 30 to > 100 d. There was some evidence of chronic infection, and BIV could be detected by PCR. Wild moribund adult L. caerulea from Townsville and captive juvenile Pseudophryne corieacea from Sydney undergoing mortality tested positive with the BIV PCR. PCR and dot blot was more sensitive than viral isolation. PCR could detect BIV in amphibians long after BIV challenge, and in amphibians which appeared healthy.

However, no studies on the occurrence of two other Office International des Epizooties-listed viruses, Taura Syndrome virus (TSV) or infectious hypodermal and <b>haematopoietic</b> <b>necrosis</b> virus (IHHNV), have been published. Therefore, a polymerase chain reaction (PCR) study on whether these two viruses {{could be found in}} frozen commodity prawns imported into Australia was undertaken. Amplicons indicative of TSV were found in 6 / 10 prawns collected at a retail outlet in Townsville and 10 / 10 prawns from Coff's Harbour using two different reverse transcriptase PCR protocols. Nucleotide sequences from the amplicons were between 97 % and 99 % similar to various TSV isolates from Asia. Amplicons indicative of the Philippine/American lineage of IHHNV were found in 5 / 5 and 5 / 6 prawns collected from Townsville and Coff's Harbour respectively. Clearly, frozen commodity Penaeus vannamei Boone from China can carry TSV and IHHNV with nucleic acid intact enough to be detected using PCR...|$|R
40|$|A {{total of}} 3 257 samples of diseased rainbow trout were {{examined}} {{for the presence}} of viruses from January 1983 to December 1987. A virus closely related to the VR 299 serotype of infectious pancreatic necrosis virus was isolated from 13 cases. An additional 7 228 viscera samples from asymptomatic fish were collected during the same period and a similar virus was isolated from 2 sites. During the same period 2 892 ovarian fluid samples were collected and a similar virus was isolated from 1 site. A similar virus was also isolated from one consignment of imported trout ova. A total of 5 550 ova was examined during this period. The viruses were identified by various tests as being closely related to the VR 299 serotype of infectious pancreatic necrosis virus. All these samples tested negative for infectious <b>haematopoietic</b> <b>necrosis</b> virus, viral haemorrhagic septlcaemia virus and herpesvirus salmonis.

40|$|Infectious hypodermal and <b>haematopoietic</b> <b>necrosis</b> virus (IHHNV) {{has been}} {{detected}} widely in penaeid culture facilities in Asia and the Americas. IHHNV infection on sub-adult and postlarvae {{of the giant}} freshwater prawn, Macrobrachium rosenbergii which had caused up to 80 % mortalities was first reported in Southeast Taiwan in 2006. In Malaysia, although, {{there has been no}} report on IHHNV infections in M. rosenbergii, preliminary work suggests that there is an urgent need to setup a screening protocol for IHHNV for both wild and cultured populations. In this study, polymerase chain reaction based screening was carried out on 30 randomly sampled berried wild M. rosenbergii before and after spawning. All samples did not showed any sign of IHHNV infection. However, the results showed that 20 % of the samples were IHHNV positive. Sequence analysis of the amplified band using NCBI-BLAST showed that the putative IHHNV sequence had 98 % nucleotide sequence (388 bp) identity with the IHHNV isolate AC- 05 - 005 non-structural protein 1 gene and seven other IHHNV strains in the data bank further affirming the suggestion on the presence of IHHNV in wild freshwater prawn populations in Malaysia...|$|R
40|$|Nine {{endogenous}} Brevidensovirus-like elements (EBreVE) {{were identified}} in redclaw freshwater crayfish Cherax quadricarinatus from different sources suggesting that these elements are widespread in redclaw in northern Queensland, Australia. These endogenous virus-like elements shared nucleotide identities (70 – 100 %) and amino acid similarities (34 – 100 %) with infectious hypodermal and <b>haematopoietic</b> <b>necrosis</b> virus (IHHNV) scientifically classified as Penaeus stylirostris densovirus (PstDNV). They may not have originated from IHHNV genomes, but could be derived from another uncharacterised member of the genus Brevidensovirus that share nucleotide similarities with IHHNV. The most striking feature of EBreVEs was that in each case, the segment (portion) of viral sequences inserted into the host genomes was from the same region of the viral genome and most likely derived from non-structural protein regions of ancestral virus, but they cannot be assembled into one consensus sequence. The EBreVEs may be inserted into the redclaw genomes following chronic or persistent infection by a corresponding virus that may have occurred as multiple independent integration events years ago leading to the accumulation of several integrated elements in their genomes. Histological examination and polymerase chain reaction (PCR) suggested that these insertions may have a protective function to their host...|$|R
40|$|The mRNA {{transcribed}} {{from the}} N gene of {{viral haemorrhagic septicaemia}} virus (VHSV) of salmonids has been cloned in Escherichia coli and expressed. Fusion proteins were recognized by monoclonal antibody directed against the N protein from the viral particle. A 1212 bp long open reading frame (ORF) coding for 404 amino acids with a calculated Mr of 44 590 was deduced from the nucleotide sequence. The ORF was preceded by a 93 bp segment including in position 42 the AACAC pentanucleotide which is presumed to be the start signal for transcription by analogy with other rhabdoviral mRNAs. The upstream 41 bp region could correspond to the covalently linked positive polarity leader RNA as also found on the N mRNA from infectious <b>haematopoietic</b> <b>necrosis</b> virus (IHNV). This may be a characteristic of fish lyssaviruses. The AAACC sequence, {{which is part of}} the leader, was not found. Amino acids 44 to 359 from IHNV and 45 to 360 from VHSV are 45. 3 % homologous. A strong homology which could reflect functional importance was also found for potential phosphorylation sites and hydrophobic peaks despite the fact that the two viruses evolved on different continents...|$|R
