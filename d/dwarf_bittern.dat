50|$|The <b>dwarf</b> <b>bittern</b> occurs year-round {{in much of}} {{tropical}} and sub-tropical Africa, with the most southern habitats only visited during the breeding season. It has been reported from Angola, Benin, Botswana, Burkina Faso, Burundi, Cameroon, Central African Republic, Chad, Republic of the Congo, Democratic Republic of the Congo, Ivory Coast, Equatorial Guinea, Ethiopia, Gabon, Gambia, Ghana, Guinea, Guinea-Bissau, Kenya, Liberia, Malawi, Mali, Mauritania, Mozambique, Namibia, Niger, Nigeria, Rwanda, Senegal, Sierra Leone, Somalia, South Africa, Spain, Sudan, Swaziland, Tanzania, Togo, Uganda, Zambia, and Zimbabwe.|$|E
50|$|It nests {{along the}} margins of flood plains, usually when the water inundates the forests. It appears to prefer thicket {{vegetation}} in which it nests solitarily or in small groups. Although not usual, they have been seen to nest near squacco heron and rufous-bellied heron. The nest is a platform of twigs lined with coarse grass, 23 x 38 cm across and 7 cm deep. The nest is placed near the central trunk of the tree, on a branch or in bushes overhanging the water, at a height of over 0.5 - 4 m above the water. They often use thorn bushes for nesting. The <b>dwarf</b> <b>bittern</b> builds its nest quickly (Tarboton 1980).|$|E
50|$|<b>Dwarf</b> <b>bitterns</b> feed solitarily or in pairs, hunting {{by night}} and, {{especially}} if it is cloudy, by day. This it does silently and unobtrusively by standing and by walking slowly. This daily schedule overlaps availability of frogs (Tarboton 1980, Hustler and Williamson 1985). <b>Dwarf</b> <b>bitterns</b> sometimes prefer to sneak through vegetation and reeds rather than climb or perch on them. When disturbed, they stay put at the water's edge in an exaggerated version of the bittern posture or it often fly up into trees moving only short distances. It is likely that individuals defend feeding territory, and its use of a forward display has been described (Riddell 1987). Insects, such as grasshoppers and water bugs, spiders, small fish, crabs, snails and frogs form the main items of the diet. Local populations specialize in grasshoppers and frogs, and {{can take advantage of}} seasonal prey availability such as frogs in fishless seasonal pans.|$|R
6000|$|The laws of {{inheritance}} can alone {{account for}} the following cases, in which the female by acquiring at a late period of life certain characters proper to the male, ultimately comes to resemble him in {{a more or less}} complete manner. Here protection can hardly have come into play. Mr. Blyth informs me that the females of Oriolus melanocephalus and of some allied species, when sufficiently mature to breed, differ considerably in plumage from the adult males; but after the second or third moults they differ only in their beaks having a slight greenish tinge. In the <b>dwarf</b> <b>bitterns</b> (Ardetta), according to the same authority, “the male acquires his final livery at the first moult, the female not before the third or fourth moult; in the meanwhile she presents an intermediate garb, which is ultimately exchanged for the same livery as that of the male.” So again the female Falco peregrinus acquires her blue plumage more slowly than the male. Mr. Swinhoe states that with one of the Drongo shrikes (Dicrurus macrocercus) the male whilst almost a nestling, moults his soft brown plumage and becomes of a uniform glossy greenish-black; but the female retains for a long time the white striæ and spots on the axillary feathers; and does not completely assume the uniform black colour of the male for the first three years. The same excellent observer remarks that in the spring of the second year the female spoonbill (Platalea) of China resembles the male of the first year, and that apparently it is not until the third spring that she acquires the same adult plumage as that possessed by the male at a much earlier age. The female Bombycilla carolinensis differs very little from the male, but the appendages, which like beads of red sealing-wax ornament the wing-feathers, are not developed in her so early in life as in the male. The upper mandible in the male of an Indian parrakeet (Palæornis Javanicus) is coral-red from his earliest youth, but in the female, as Mr. Blyth has observed with caged and wild birds, it is at first black and does not become red until the bird is at least a year old, at which age the sexes resemble each other in all respects. Both sexes of the wild turkey are ultimately furnished with a tuft of bristles on the breast, but in two-year-old birds the tuft is about four inches long in the male and hardly apparent in the female; when, however, the latter has reached her fourth year, it is from four to five inches in length.[226] ...|$|R

50|$|The {{least bittern}} {{is one of}} the {{smallest}} herons in the world, with perhaps only the <b>dwarf</b> <b>bittern</b> and the black-backed bittern averaging smaller in length. This tiny bittern can measure from 28 to 36 cm in length, and the wingspan ranges from 41 to 46 cm. Body mass is from 51 to 102 g, with most birds between 73 and 95 g, making this perhaps the lightest of all herons. Yet, a recent manual of avian body masses, cites yet another species in this genus, the stripe-backed bittern, as having a mean body mass slightly lower than the least bittern, which is credited with a mean mass of 86.3 g. This bird's underparts and throat are white with light brown streaks. Its face and the sides of the neck are light brown; it has yellow eyes and a yellow bill. The adult male is glossy greenish black on the back and crown; the adult female is glossy brown on these parts. They show light brown parts on the wings in flight.|$|E
