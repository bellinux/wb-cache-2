The {{aim of this}} study is to investigate the performance of the injection process into a confined cross-flow of a round pipe using a single piston injection pump. A computational fluid dynamics (CFD) analysis has been carried out to investigate the effect of the locations of the maximum velocity and minimum pressure on the confined cross-flow process. The <b>jet</b> <b>trajectory</b> is analyzed and related to the injection pump shaft angle of rotation during the injection duty cycle by focusing on the maximum instant injection flow of the piston action. Results indicate a low effect of the <b>jet</b> <b>trajectory</b> within the range related to the injection pump operational conditions. Constant cross-flow was used and injection flow is altered to vary the jet to line flow ratio (QR). The maximum <b>jet</b> <b>trajectory</b> exhibits low penetration inside the cross-flow. The results showed three regions of the flow ratio effect zones with different behaviors. Results also showed that getting closer to the injection port causes a significant decrease on the locations of the maximum velocity and minimum pressure...|$|E
40|$|This work {{presents}} {{a comparison between}} an isolated and a non-isolated curved liquid jet emerging from a rotating nozzle through centrifuge spinning system. In the centrifugal spinning process, a polymer solution has been pushed by the centrifugal force through small nozzle of a rapidly rotating cylindrical drum. Thereby thin fibers are formed and collected on a collector {{in the form of a}} web. Centrifuge spinning suffered from a strong air resistance which leads to a more deflected jet as well as its rapidly solvent evaporation resulting in thicker nanofibers. In this work, centrifuge spinning has been equipped by a rotating collector, whereas the fabrication process was skillfully sealed from ambient airflow. A comparison was drawn between the trajectory of Newtonian liquid jets fabricated by centrifuge spinning and air-sealed centrifuge spinning. The captured images of the liquid <b>jet</b> <b>trajectory</b> using a high speed camera showed that non-isolated liquid jets were more curved than isolated liquid jets due to air resistance. A pre-presented non-linear analysis of the Navier-Stokes equations was carried out and the numerical solutions were compared with the experiments. There was fairly good agreement between the isolated <b>jet</b> <b>trajectory</b> and the model-predicted one, but there were differences between the non-isolated <b>jet</b> <b>trajectory</b> and the simulation results. The non-isolated jet curved more compared to the others due to air drag. Also, the diameter of polymeric nanofibers was predicted and compared with experiments. Some qualitative agreement was found...|$|E

This behavior is explained by the radially inward velocity component necessary to support irrotational flow through the turn. Comparison between experimental results and model calculations showed poor agreement due to the model's not including the radial velocity component.

40|$|International audienceLarge Eddy Simulations (LES) of a lean swirl-stabilized {{gas turbine}} burner {{are used to}} analyze {{mechanisms}} triggering combustion instabilities. To separately study the effect of velocity and equivalence ratio fluctuations, two LES of the same geometry are performed: one where the burner operates in a "technically" premixed mode (methane is injected by holes in the vanes located in the diagonal passage upstream of the chamber) and the second one where the flow is fully premixed in the diagonal passage. The inlet is acoustically modulated and the mechanisms affecting the dynamic flame response are identified. LES reveals that both cases provide similar averaged (non-) pulsated flame shapes. However, even though the mean flames are only slightly modified, the delays change when mixing is not perfect. LES fields and a simple model for the methane <b>jets</b> <b>trajectories</b> show that mixing in the diagonal passage {{is not sufficient to}} damp heterogeneities induced by unsteady fuel flow rate and varying fuel <b>jet</b> <b>trajectories.</b> These mixing fluctuations are phased with velocity oscillations and modify the flame response to forcing.

40|$|International audienceThis {{paper is}} devoted to the {{analysis}} of the jet trajectories, obtained using computational fluid dynamics (CFD), at two different scales (laboratory and industrial) with application to quenching of runaway reactions. One of the goals was to describe how the jet penetrates the fluid in the stirred vessel and to build an easy to use correlation for research and industrial purposes. A model of the <b>jet</b> <b>trajectory</b> based on the analogy with a jet in a cross-flow has been used to predict the <b>jet</b> <b>trajectory</b> at the pilot and industrial scales. The correlation, built using a statistical analysis, has shown that the jet in a cross-flow model performs very well to describe the jet trajectories. A very interesting conclusion is that the correlation constants were found to be independent of scale.

40|$|This study {{presents}} an experimental investigation of hydraulic characteristics of submerged offset jets. The instantaneous velocity {{was captured by}} an acoustic Doppler velocimeter (ADV). A total of 20 runs were carried out by varying different parameters: Reynolds number (28475 − 80730), offset ratio (3. 16 − 6. 2), jet Froude number (1. 9 − 3), submergence parameter (0. 65 − 2. 82) and sluice gate openings (3, 3. 5, 4, 4. 5 and 5 cm). It is observed that {{the length of the}} reattachment depends on the relative offset height and the tail water depth. A mathematical formulation is developed for the submerged offset jet assuming a submerged jump in a drop structure to find the back-up depth and subcritical sequent depth by applying the momentum and continuity equations at the inlet and at tail water depth respectively. A mathematical equation is also developed for the back-up depth at the efflux section, which is experimentally verified for the range of supercritical Froude numbers from 1. 1 to 10 and submergence factor.

40|$|A {{comprehensive}} experimental {{investigation for}} an inclined (to vertical) dense jet in perpendicular crossflow-with a three-dimensional trajectory-is reported. The detailed tracer concentration {{field in the}} vertical cross-section of the bent-over jet {{is measured by the}} laser-induced fluorescence technique {{for a wide range of}} jet densimetric Froude number and ambient to jet velocity ratios. The <b>jet</b> <b>trajectory</b> and dilution determined from a large number of cross-sectional scalar fields are interpreted by the Lagrangian model over the entire range of jet-dominated to crossflow-dominated regimes. The mixing during the ascent phase of the dense jet resembles that of an advected jet or line puff and changes to a negatively buoyant thermal on descent. It is found that the mixing behavior is governed by a crossflow Froude number. For, the mixing is jet-dominated and governed by shear entrainment; significant detrainment occurs and the maximum height of rise is under-predicted as in the case of a dense jet in stagnant fluid. While the <b>jet</b> <b>trajectory</b> in the horizontal momentum plane is well-predicted, the measurements indicate a greater rise and slower descent. For the dense jet becomes significantly bent-over during its ascent phase; the jet mixing is dominated by vortex entrainment. For, the detrainment ceases to have any effect on the jet behavior. The <b>jet</b> <b>trajectory</b> in both the horizontal momentum and buoyancy planes are well predicted by the model. Despite the under-prediction of terminal rise, the jet dilution at a large number of cross-sections covering the ascent and descent of the dense jet are well-predicted. Both the terminal rise and the initial dilution for the inclined jet in perpendicular crossflow are smaller than those of a corresponding vertical jet. Both the maximum terminal rise and horizontal lateral penetration follow a dependence in the crossflow-dominated regime. The initial dilution at terminal rise follows a dependence...|$|E

40|$|The aim of {{this paper}} is to {{investigate}} the characteristics of the atomization process of a liquid jet injected into a high-pressure air cross-flow, i. e. in condition similar to that occurring in the inlet duct of a LPP gas-turbine burner. The influences of controlling parameters such as air velocity, liquid velocity and diameter of the nozzle are considered. The main features of the spray morphology were determined by means of a tomographic visualization technique and the general evolution of the spray in some typical cases is presented in the paper. It is shown as the jet evolution is significantly influenced by the onset of a stripping atomization mechanism marked by the peculiar morphology of the spray cross-section. This is also evident from the observation of the jet trajectories determined by using a shadowgraphic technique. The different behavior of the atomization process induced by the stripping mechanism led to a bi-stable evolution of <b>jet</b> <b>trajectory</b> in dependence of the prevalence of the liquid or air velocities effects. This feature can be hardly modeled by the interpolating function proposed in the literature. As a consequence, a stronger effort to gain a deeper understanding of the fluid dynamic, involved in the jet break-up in presence of an air cross-flow, is still required in order to build-up a more realistic model of the <b>jet</b> <b>trajectory</b> evolution.

40|$|A reactor {{has been}} {{designed}} {{for the study of}} the nucleation and growth of an ammonium chloride aerosol starting from ammonia and hydrogen chloride in the gas phase at ambient conditions. The reactor configuration was derived from other aerosol reactors used for the production of ultrafine ceramic particles: two opposed jets containing one reactant discharging into a cross stream containing the second reactant. The fluid flow was in a transition state from laminar to fully turbulent. The reactor had essentially a two-dimensional configuration. Three types of measurements were performed to characterize the reactor: velocity, tracer concentration and aerosol particle size distribution (PSD) measurements. A mathematical model was developed to simulate the experimental reactor. The measurements demonstrated that the flow could be divided into two important regions: the principal <b>jet</b> <b>trajectory</b> and the main recirculation downstream of the jet along the reactor wall. Most of the mixing between the two jets and the main flow occurred along the principal <b>jet</b> <b>trajectory,</b> the recirculation zone was well mixed in most cases. Higher jet velocities increased the extent of mixing in the reactor. The nucleation of aerosol particles occurred close to the reactor inlets. In the recirculation zone, larger particles were found and in a lower concentration compared to the aerosol along the principal <b>jet</b> <b>trajectory.</b> The numerical computations showed that neither a laminar nor a turbulent flow model were able to accurately reproduce the experimental fluid flow. A good agreement with measurements was nevertheless obtained for the modeling of the mixing of a tracer. For the nucleation and growth of the aerosol, a model based on the residence time distribution of the reactor gave a good agreement with experiments for certain values of the rate constant and surface free energy of formation. However, this model neglects key features of the reactor behavior because it assumes well mixed reactants at the entrance and that particles of different ages are not mixed together. Another model using spatial transport of the species failed to reproduce the experimental aerosol measurements. It nevertheless emphasized the role of the recirculation zone in the reduction of the nucleation by favoring condensation onto existing particles...|$|E

Such jets arise when brine is discharged from desalination plants and improved knowledge of their behavior is required for designing discharge systems that cause a minimum of environmental impact on the receiving waters. In the present study, a turbulent jet with a specific salinity was discharged through a circular nozzle {{at an angle to}} the horizontal into a tank with fresh water and the spatial evolution of the jet was recorded. In total, 72 experimental cases were carried out where four different initial jet parameters were changed, namely the nozzle diameter, the initial jet inclination, the jet density (or salinity), and the flow rate (or exit velocity). The measurements of the jet evolution in the tank included five geometric quantities describing the <b>jet</b> <b>trajectory</b> that are useful in the design of brine discharge systems.
