40|$|This {{article is}} based on the {{theoretical}} framework developed within a research project on the construction of Eurocentrism and, more specifically, on the analysis of Portuguese history textbooks. We propose that the textbooks’ master narrative constitutes a power-evasive discourse on history, which naturalizes core processes such as colonialism, slavery and racism. Showing the limits of an approach that merely proposes the compensation or rectification of (mis) representations, we argue for the need to unbind the debate on Eurocentrism from a perspective that fails to make problematic the ‘very idea of Europe’. Accordingly, our analysis of Portuguese history textbooks focuses on three core narrative devices: (1) the chronopolitics of representation; (2) the paradigm of the (democratic) national state; and (3) the <b>definitive</b> <b>bond</b> between concepts and historical processes...|$|E
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this in vitro study was to {{evaluate}} the marginal fit of pressed IPS e. max copings fabricated from a computer-aided designed and milled PMMA acrylic resin burnout coping of various cement spacer thicknesses. Three groups of ten PMMA acrylic burnout copings were designed and milled utilizing computer-aided software for a total sample size of thirty copings. Each group differed only by the die-spacer parameters indicated within the design software. Group 1, Group 2, and Group 3 were digitally designed with 25, 40, and 60 ?m of die-spacer respectively. All acrylic resin copings were pressed with IPS e. max lithium disilicate and adhesively bonded to thirty identical epoxy resin dies. Cross-sections of each specimen were obtained and viewed with a scanning electron microscope. Direct measurements were obtained at five pre-determined locations and data analyzed using statistical analysis software. An analysis of variance (ANOVA) followed by a Mann-Whitney {{test was used to}} indicate significant differences between groups (p ? 0. 017). A statistically significant difference was found between groups for each measured location: buccal margin (p= 0. 005), buccal-axial (p= 0. 013), mid-occlusal (p= 0. 030), lingual-axial (p= 0. 022), lingual margin (p= 0. 005). When 60 ?m of die spacer was utilized in the fabrication of the milled acrylic resin coping, the <b>definitive</b> <b>bonded</b> ceramic coping yielded the best marginal fit. Cement thickness was greatest, and marginal fit was poorest when 25 ?m of die spacer was utilized. Observed differences between groups {{can be attributed to the}} utilization of acrylic resin patterns in the fabrication of pressed IPS e. max copings. The obtained results suggest that appropriate die spacer parameters indicated within computer-aided design software are critical in the fabrication of clinically acceptable indirect restorations...|$|R
40|$|The {{impact of}} the {{projects}} on people’s lives and experiences are without doubt positively contributing to their social capital in terms of extending social networks, trust, civic engagement, power to achieve things, and the bridges {{they are able to}} build with individuals and groups within and outwith their communities. The research confirms that community based learning can create a stronger sense of personal and social efficacy. There are clear and <b>definitive</b> changes in <b>bonding</b> and bridging social capital as well as civic engagement. The positive experience of involvement and enhanced confidence and skills is likely to encourage greater participation in other civic groups and community activities. We need to qualify this, however, by recognising what works for some people may not work for all. Also an unintended outcome is that the experience of involvement can lead to more selective forms of participation through a more astute awareness of the tokenistic exercise of power...|$|R
40|$|The medieval Alcázar (fortress) of Madrid was {{transformed}} into the residential palace of the Austrian dynasty in Spain from the reign of Charles I through that of Charles II. On Christmas Eve 1734, {{during the reign of}} the Bourbon king Philip V, the palace suffered a devastating fire, resulting in {{the construction of a new}} Royal palace, already baroque, on the same site. This research reconstructs the history – until now fragmented – of this lost medieval castle, contributing new source materials concerning the successive interventions carried out on the building. Specifically, this investigation focuses on the improvements realized during the period of the Catholic Monarchs and the first works commissioned by Charles V, prior to the <b>definitive</b> royal <b>bond</b> of 1536. This document marks the beginning of a new chapter in the constructive history of the building, when the old castle {{was transformed}} definitively into a residential palace, while highlighting the symbolic value of the Sala Rica and the rooms of protocol constructed during the Trastámara period. El alcázar medieval de Madrid se convirtió en la gran residencia de los Austrias desde la llegada de Carlos I al reinado de Carlos II. En la Nochebuena de 1734, reinando ya Felipe V de Borbón, el palacio sufrió un devastador incendio, resultado del cual se inicia la construcción del nuevo Palacio Real, ya barroco, sobre su solar. En esta investigación nos ocupamos de reconstruir la historia –hasta ahora fragmentada– de ese castillo medieval, aportando nuevos datos documentales acerca de las sucesivas intervenciones sufridas en el edificio. Nos centramos de forma especial en las obras realizadas en el período de los Reyes Católicos y en las primeras encargadas por Carlos V, antes de la definitiva real cédula de 1536 que marca el comienzo de un nuevo capítulo en la historia constructiva del edificio al transformarse de manera definitiva el viejo castillo en un palacio residencial, pero subrayando al tiempo el valor simbólico de la “Cuadra Rica” y las salas de aparato de la época Trastámara...|$|R
