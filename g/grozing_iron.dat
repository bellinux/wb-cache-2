5000|$|In the Middle Ages, {{glass was}} {{cut with a}} heated and sharply pointed iron rod. The red hot point was drawn along the {{moistened}} surface of the glass causing it to snap apart. Fractures created in this way were not very accurate and the rough pieces had to be chipped or [...] "grozed" [...] down to more exact shapes with a hooked tool called a <b>grozing</b> <b>iron.</b> Between the 14th and 16th centuries, starting in Italy, a diamond-tipped cutter became prevalent which allowed for more precise cutting. Then in 1869 the wheel cutter was developed by Samuel Monce of Bristol, Connecticut, which remains the current standard tool for most glass cutting.|$|E

5000|$|The manor {{was called}} [...] "Stowford" [...] during the mediaeval era, and {{was held for}} many generations by a gentry family of unknown origins named Kelloway (or Kellaway, etc.). The canting arms of this family display an ancient variety of pear from France called {{variously}} Caillou, Cailloel, Cailhou, etc., Anglicised as [...] "Kelway pear". This is combined, for reasons unknown, with <b>grozing</b> <b>irons,</b> tools used by glaziers for cutting and shaping stained-glass panes. In the 16th century, for reason unknown, this family adopted the surname [...] "Stowford" [...] (later [...] "Stafford") in place of [...] "Kelloway", but retained the arms of Kelloway.|$|R
5000|$|Henry Cooke married Jone Thorne, heiress of Thorne, and his {{descendants}} remained {{seated at}} Thorne {{until the time}} of Pole (d.1635). The arms of Thorne (Argent, a fess gules between three lions rampant sable) appear as {{the second of the}} nine quarters on an escutcheon on top of the mural monument to John Cooke (d. 1632) of Thorne in St Mary's Church, Ottery St Mary. The Cooke family subsequently married various further heiresses, one of whom was Mary Keloway, one of the daughters and co-heiresses of John Keloway (alias Kelloway,, etc.) of Cullompton, Devon, a widespread and prominent Devonshire family the senior line of which was seated at Stafford, Dolton. The arms of Kelloway (Argent, two <b>grozing</b> <b>irons</b> in saltire sable between four Kelway pears proper a bordure engrailed of the second) appear as the fourth of nine the quarters on an escutcheon on the mural monument to John Cooke (d. 1632) of Thorne in St Mary's Church, Ottery St Mary. Mary Kelloway's mother was Jane Tregarthyn, a daughter and heiress of Tredruffe Tregarthyn of Bremwell in Cornwall. The arms of Mary Kelloway's parents appear on the monument in Branscombe Church, Devon, to Joan Tregarthin (d.1583) widow successively of John Kelloway of Cullompton, and of John Wadham (d.1578) of Merifield, Ilton, Somerset and of Edge, Branscombe.|$|R
5000|$|In the Stafford Chapel (South Aisle Chapel) of St Edmund's Church, Dolton (the parish {{church of}} Stafford), survive three bench-ends {{commissioned}} in 1581 by John Stafford (d.1599) of Stafford. The northernmost (left-most) displays on an escutcheon {{the arms of}} Stafford (Argent, two <b>grozing</b> <b>irons</b> in saltire sable between four Kelway pears proper) between the date [...] "1581" [...] in chief and the initials [...] "IS" [...] in base (Latin: [...] "Iohannes/Johannes Stafford"). The middle one shows the arms of Stafford (unusually shown twice in pale, an apparently unheraldic usage, not quartering) impaling Copplestone (Argent, a chevron engrailed gules between three leopard's faces azure), with the chevron charged with cadency mark of a mullet to denote a third son. The right-most shield shows Stafford (again twice) impaling Prouse (Sable, three lions rampant argent). These represent heraldically the marriages of some of John Stafford's ancestors. His great-grandfather was Thomas Stafford/Stowford alias Kelloway (d.1502/3) of Stafford, who married Anne Coplestone, third daughter of Thomas Coplestone of Luccombe, Somerset, younger brother of John Coplestone (d.1433) lord of the manor of Copleston, Devon. His great-great-great-great grandfather was Thomas Kelloway who married the daughter of .... Prouse, and heiress of her brother Hugh Prouse of Gatcombe, ( [...] ? in the parish of Collyton ?), Devon. Below the arms are Renaissance grottoesque motifs with human and animal heads. The benches to which these bench-ends are affixed were originally the [...] "squire's pew" [...] (or [...] "manorial pew") a private area where the most important family of the parish sat, with their household servants. The manor of Dolton was however never owned by the Stafford family, but by non-resident lords of the manor. The benches are today located against the east wall of the Stafford Chapel (south aisle chapel), {{on the floor of}} which survive three inscribed ledger-stones of the Stafford family, including that of John Stafford himself (whose stone is inscribed: [...] "Here lieth the body of John Stafford , Esquier, who dyed the xxiith (sic) of J.... (Anno) Dom 1599. As you are so were wee, as wee bee so shall ye: erth. Sic transit gloria mundi") and that of his wife Margery Arscott (d.1589) (whose ledger stone is inscribed: Here lyes the body of Margery, daughter to John Arscott (of) Dunsland & wife to John Stafford of Stafford Esquier. Shee d(ye)d the xviith of March 1589. Disce quid es, q(uid er)is ("learn what you are, what you will become")) This is not the original position of the benches as a pre-Reformation altar used to exist against this wall, as is evidenced by a piscina surviving in the wall.|$|R
