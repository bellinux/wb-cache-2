5|$|Even before Adolf Hitler {{seized control}} of Germany in 1933, the {{problems}} with the Minority Treaties were evident.

5|$|On January 10, 1931, the Bureau {{made the}} bid {{documents}} available to <b>interested</b> <b>parties,</b> at five dollars a copy. The government {{was to provide}} the materials; but the contractor was to prepare the site and build the dam. The dam was described in minute detail, covering 100pages of text and 76drawings. A $2million bid bond was to accompany each bid; the winner would have to post a $5million performance bond. The contractor had seven years to build the dam, or penalties would ensue.|$|E
5|$|The {{attack on}} Pi Jove in 2010 {{prompted}} activists {{to complain about}} perceived ongoing lack of action by the authorities, and prompted the local municipality of Castellar del Riu to start work with <b>interested</b> <b>parties</b> {{to develop a plan}} to secure the site. In 2012 the mayor announced plans to take over the maintenance of the land around the two trees and develop facilities for visitors, including a car park and information panels.|$|E
5|$|In 1976, the BWB decided after {{a meeting}} with local councils that the Forth and Clyde Canal, {{fragmented}} by various developments, was to have its remaining navigability preserved by building new bridges with sufficient headroom for boats and continuing to maintain the existing locks. Restoration of sea-to-sea navigation was deemed too expensive at the time, but {{there were to be}} no further restrictions on its use. A 1979 survey report documented 69 obstructions to navigation, and sought the opinions of twenty <b>interested</b> <b>parties</b> to present the Forth and Clyde Local (Subject) Plan in 1980.|$|E

40|$|Many {{situations}} {{arise in}} which an <b>interested</b> <b>party’s</b> utility {{is dependent on the}} actions of an agent; e. g., a teacher is interested in a student learning effectively and a firm is interested in a consumer’s behavior. We consider an environment in which the <b>interested</b> <b>party</b> can provide incentives to affect the agent’s actions but cannot otherwise enforce actions. In value-based policy teaching, we situate this within the framework of sequential decision tasks modeled by Markov Decision Processes, and seek to associate limited rewards with states that induce the agent to follow a policy that maximizes the total expected value of the <b>interested</b> <b>party.</b> We show value-based policy teaching is NP-hard and provide a mixed integer program formulation. Focusing in particular on environments in which the agent’s reward is unknown to the <b>interested</b> <b>party,</b> we provide a method for active indirect elicitation wherein the agent’s reward function is inferred from observations about its response to incentives. Experimental results suggest that we can generally find the optimal incentive provision in a small number of elicitation rounds...|$|R

5|$|In 2001, the Cotswold Canals Partnership was established, drawing {{together}} people {{representing the}} Proprietors, the Cotswold Canals Trust, councils at district and county level, {{and a number}} of other <b>interested</b> <b>parties.</b> This provided a suitable structure to drive the restoration forwards. In 2002, the waterway was identified as being of high priority in the Association of Inland Navigation Authorities report entitled Vision for Strategic Enhancement of Britain's Inland Navigation Network, and was one of several new projects highlighted at British Waterways' Unlocked and Unlimited conference held in March. The estimated cost of the project to restore both the Stroudwater Navigation and the Thames and Severn Canal was £82 million.|$|E
5|$|<b>Interested</b> <b>parties</b> on {{both sides}} filed amici. A group of {{conservative}} Republicans {{in both houses of}} Congress, including Newt Gingrich, Dick Armey, Henry Hyde and Rick Santorum, and the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children both argued for affirming the conviction, pointing to the invaluable nature of undercover investigations in fighting child pornography, worrying that requiring reasonable suspicion beforehand could make such operations impossible. Americans for Effective Law Enforcement said there had been no entrapment and that reasonable suspicion was not required before starting investigations such as Looking Glass. The American Civil Liberties Union, its Nebraska chapter and the National Association of Criminal Defense Lawyers weighed in on Jacobson's behalf.|$|E

40|$|Consider {{a setting}} in which an agent selects an action in each time period {{and there is an}} <b>interested</b> <b>party</b> who seeks to induce a {{particular}} action. The <b>interested</b> <b>party</b> can associate incentives with actions to perturb their value to the agent. The agent’s decision problem is modeled as a multi-armed bandit process where the intrinsic value for an action updates independently of the state of other actions and only when the action is selected. The agent selects the action in each period with the maximal perturbed value. In particular, this models the problem of a learning agent with the <b>interested</b> <b>party</b> as a teacher. For inducing the goal action as soon as possible, or as often as possible over a fixed time period, it is optimal for an <b>interested</b> <b>party</b> with a per-period incentive budget to assign the budget to the goal action and wait for the agent to learn to want to make that choice. Teaching is easy in this case. In contrast, with an across-period budget, no algorithm can provide good performance on all instances without knowledge of the agent’s update process, except in the particular case in which the goal is to induce the agent to select the goal action once...|$|R
5|$|Longleat Estate has fenced off a {{large part}} of its land and has {{introduced}} goats, as part of a programme to encourage the biodiversity of the area; the goats were intended to replace the sheep that grazed in the gorge until the 1970s. The National Trust announced in March 2007 that it plans to release a flock of sheep on its side of the gorge for the same purpose, but will first consult local residents and <b>interested</b> <b>parties</b> on whether to fence off the gorge or introduce cattle grids to prevent the sheep from straying. There is already a small flock of feral Soay sheep in the gorge.|$|E

5|$|The {{purchase}} of the diaries continued, and by June 1982 Gruner + Jahr possessed 35 volumes. In early 1983 the company took the decision to work towards a publication date for the diaries. To ensure wide readership and to maximise their returns, Stern issued a prospectus to potentially <b>interested</b> <b>parties,</b> Newsweek, Time, Paris Match and a syndicate of papers owned by Murdoch. Stern rented a large vault in a Swiss bank. They filled the space with Nazi memorabilia and displayed various letters and manuscripts.|$|E
5|$|Late 13th-century {{politics}} in the Eastern Mediterranean were complex, {{with a number of}} powerful <b>interested</b> <b>parties.</b> Baibars had three key objectives: to prevent an alliance between the Latins and the Mongols, to cause dissension between the Mongols particularly between the Golden Horde and the Persian Ilkhanate, and to maintain access to a supply of slave recruits from the Russian steppes. In this he developed diplomatic ties with Manfred, King of Sicily, supporting him against the Papacy and LouisIX's brother Charles of Anjou. The Crusader states were fragmented, and various powers were competing for influence. In the War of Saint Sabas, Venice drove the Genoese from Acre to Tyre where they continued to trade happily with Baibars' Egypt. Indeed, Baibars negotiated free passage for the Genoese with Michael VIII Palaiologos, Emperor of Nicaea, the newly restored ruler of Constantinople.|$|E
5|$|Following {{the failure}} of the REO bid to develop the site, in February 2012, Battersea Power Station was put up for sale on the open market {{for the first time in}} its history. The sale was {{conducted}} by commercial estate agent Knight Frank on behalf of the site's creditors. In May 2012, several bids were received for the landmark site, which was put on the market after Nama and Lloyds Banking Group called in loans held by Treasury Holdings' Real Estate Opportunities (REO). Bids were received from Chelsea F.C. with other <b>interested</b> <b>parties</b> including a Malaysian interest, SP Setia, London & Regional, a company owned by the London-based Livingstone brothers and housebuilder Berkeley. If sold, the new owner would have to pay £500 million for the power station, including £325 million to cover the debts held by Nama and Lloyds, and a £100 million contribution to the Northern line extension. If the sale is unsuccessful, the agent would have a duty to maintain and preserve the site in line with its listed status.|$|E

5|$|On April 6, 2008, {{a seven-year-old}} boy accidentally started {{a fire in}} a nearby {{campground}} while playing with matches. The fire moved up the riverbank and destroyed the bridge's wooden deck and rails. The county funded a study to determine the feasibility and cost of reconstructing the bridge. The engineers determined that the steel cables and towers most likely did not suffer structural damage and could be reused. The study estimated reconstruction costs at $850,000. The engineers determined the original blueprints, preserved in a museum, were of sufficient quality that only minimal engineering work would be required. The county agreed to direct the effort, but will not fund it with taxpayer money. As replicas do not qualify for historical status, historians are debating if using the original towers and cable is enough for the structure to qualify as historical. Grand County has set up an account for <b>interested</b> <b>parties</b> to donate to the reconstruction effort.|$|E
5|$|Once {{the draft}} order had been issued, {{the locus of}} the process moved from the Potteries to London with the Local Government Provisional Order (No. 3) Bill {{introduced}} in the House of Commons in July 1908 by the Select Committee on Private bills chaired by Sir George White. The bill received its third reading on 31 July 1908 but had undergone significant amendment during its passage through the House of Commons, most notably in {{the introduction of a}} complex, differential rating system for a period of 10 years. Few of the <b>interested</b> <b>parties</b> were pleased with the proposal and, although the differential system was welcomed, a period of 20 years was preferred with the complicated valuation required of all public assets proving unpopular. As a result, Tunstall withdrew its support for the order leaving only Hanley and Longton to promote the bill in the House of Lords. Neither council was particularly in favour of the financial settlement but felt honour bound to promote the bill, having been the initial instigators of the scheme. Petitions objecting to the bill were submitted to the House of Lords by Staffordshire County Council, Burslem, Fenton, Stoke, and Tunstall councils, the Longton Justices, the North Staffordshire Railway Company, and individual Tunstall ratepayers.|$|E
5|$|URBED (the Urban and Economic Development Group), a not-for-profit urban {{regeneration}} consultancy, designed and developed the {{master plan for}} the scheme {{on behalf of the}} New England Consortium. This is a group of companies and <b>interested</b> <b>parties</b> which together have the overall responsibility for the scheme, including Network Rail Infrastructure Ltd, J. Sainsbury Developments Ltd and Quintain Estates and Development (QED). The land was originally owned by British Rail, but passed to Railtrack when the railway system was privatised in the mid-1990s. It was sold to the New England Consortium in 1997. An initial planning application, including a new Sainsbury's supermarket, was rejected by the council in November 1997; the rejection was subsequently upheld on appeal in September 1998. URBED were then asked to develop a new master plan for the site. This design statement was published in July 2001, and was granted planning permission by Brighton & Hove City Council at the end of 2002. Construction work on the site began on 19 July 2004.|$|E
