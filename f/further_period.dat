5|$|Braithwaite had a <b>further</b> <b>period</b> {{in command}} of the {{division}} while Russell was on sick leave in late October and in early December led his brigade in attacks on Polderhoek Chateau. The brigade suffered heavy losses and the attack was regarded as a failure. At this stage of the war, Braithwaite was one of the longest serving brigade commanders of the NZEF. Worn down by stresses of command, his health was so poor it forced his evacuation to England.|$|E
5|$|Invasion by Magnus Barefoot in {{the late}} 11th century {{resulted}} in {{a brief period of}} direct Norwegian rule over the kingdom, but soon the descendants of Godred Crovan re-asserted a <b>further</b> <b>period</b> of largely independent overlordship. This came to an end with the emergence of Somerled, on whose death in 1164 the kingdom was split in two. Just over a century later the islands became part of the Kingdom of Scotland, following the 1266 Treaty of Perth.|$|E

30|$|NIV {{following}} {{a period of}} mechanical ventilation was given for 31 patients. In this cohort, NIV was administered for a median duration of 21 hours (range 1 - 617 hours). 13 / 31 patients (42 %) required re-intubation and <b>further</b> <b>periods</b> of mechanical ventilation.|$|R
5|$|Bristol Bridge, {{the only}} way of {{crossing}} the river without using a ferry, was rebuilt between 1764 and 1768. The earlier medieval bridge was too narrow and congested to cope with the amount of traffic that needed to use it. A toll was charged to pay for the works, and when, in 1793, the toll was extended for a <b>further</b> <b>period</b> of time the Bristol Bridge Riot ensued. Eleven people were killed and 45 injured, {{making it one of the}} worst riots of the 18th century.|$|E
5|$|Taunton Town F.C. are a {{football}} club, who play at Wordsworth Drive in the town. They were formed in 1947 {{by a few}} local businessmen as Taunton F.C., changing to the current name in 1968, and played their first friendly fixture in 1948. For most of their history, Taunton {{were members of the}} Western League. They spent a six-season spell in the Southern League from 1977, and after a <b>further</b> <b>period</b> in the Western League, returned to the Southern League in 2002, after winning the FA Vase in 2001. After the latest re-organisation of the English football league system, the club are currently members of the Southern League Division One South & West.|$|E
5|$|Following the {{evacuation}} from Gallipoli, the AIF was re-organised in Egypt. This saw the splitting of the veteran battalions to provide cadres for new battalions as the AIF's infantry divisions in Egypt were doubled. As {{a part of}} this process, the 15th Battalion provided personnel to the 47th Battalion, and the 4th Brigade became part of the Australian 4th Division. After a <b>further</b> <b>period</b> of training, in June 1916 the battalion sailed for France aboard the transport Transylvania. After landing at Marseilles, the 15th Battalion moved to northern France via rail to Beilleul, moving into the line around Bois Grenier for a brief period on 15 June. Amidst the carnage of the Battle of the Somme which was launched in July, the following month, the 15th Battalion was committed to fighting on the Western Front for the first time, entering the line around Pozières on 5 August, as the 4th Division relieved the shattered 2nd.|$|E

5|$|Harvey was not {{embroiled in}} the {{political}} arguments surrounding the action, as he had resigned his commission on 23 May 1809, before the attack went ahead, in protest at Cochrane's preferment. Returning to the Navy a year later on 21 March 1810, Harvey was never again called to active service, Gambier blocking his efforts to obtain gainful employment. Despite his failure {{to return to the}} sea, Harvey's seniority brought more promotions; he made vice-admiral in 1810 and finally became a full admiral in 1819. He was also made a Knight Commander of the Order of the Bath in 1815 when the order was reformed, becoming a Knight Grand Cross in 1825. Harvey's retirement included a <b>further</b> <b>period</b> in politics, returning to his seat as MP for Essex between 1820 and 1830.|$|E
5|$|Michael Tippett {{was born}} in London in 1905, to well-to-do though {{unconventional}} parents. His father, a lawyer and businessman, was a freethinker, his mother a writer and suffragette. He received piano lessons as a child, but first showed his musical prowess while a pupil at Stamford School in Lincolnshire, between 1920 and 1922. Although the school's formal music curriculum was slight, Tippett received private piano tuition from Frances Tinkler, a noted local teacher whose most distinguished pupil had been Malcolm Sargent, himself a former pupil at Stamford. Tippett's chance purchase in a local bookshop of Stanford's book Musical Composition led to his determination to be a composer, and in April 1923 he was accepted {{as a student at}} the Royal College of Music (RCM). Here he studied composition, first under Charles Wood (who died in 1926) and later, less successfully, with Charles Kitson. He also studied conducting, first under Sargent and later under Adrian Boult. He left the RCM in December 1928, but after two years spent unsuccessfully attempting to launch his career as a composer, he returned to the college in 1930 for a <b>further</b> <b>period</b> of study, principally under the professor of counterpoint, R. O. Morris.|$|E
5|$|The {{battalion}} {{arrived in}} Egypt on 18 May 1940, {{and joined the}} 17th Brigade's other two infantry battalions in camp at Beit Jirja. A <b>further</b> <b>period</b> of training in Palestine followed before the battalion {{took part in the}} fighting against the Italians in Libya in January–February 1941, during which the 2/5th was involved in attacks on Bardia and Tobruk, as the Australians went into battle for the first time. During the fighting around Bardia, the battalion's commander, Wrigley, was seriously wounded in an artillery bombardment, and was temporarily replaced by Major George Sell, as the battalion was committed to the fighting in {{the second phase of the}} assault, advancing through the bridgehead that had been established towards the railway switchline. Later, during the assault on Tobruk, the 2/5th was tasked with conducting a diversionary attack to the east of the Italian perimeter. The battalion's time in Libya cost it 32 killed, and 60 wounded.|$|E
50|$|The {{criteria}} were {{for a minimum}} of 12 years service in the Territorial Army with war service counting double. Bars for <b>further</b> <b>periods</b> of 12 years were not awarded because they were not possible, given that this medal was superseded after 9 years by the Efficiency Medal. The medal {{is referred to as the}} TEM.|$|R

5|$|The siege {{began in}} May 1648. The Ottomans spent three months {{investing}} the city, which included {{cutting off the}} water supply. Eventually, it would last until 1669, the second longest siege in history after the Siege of Ceuta (1694-1727) by the Moors under Moulay Ismail. The Ottoman besiegers were adversely affected by the bad supply situation caused by {{the activity of the}} Christian fleets in the Aegean, who intercepted Ottoman convoys carrying supplies and reinforcements to the island. In addition, the overall Ottoman war effort was severely hampered by increased domestic instability caused by Sultan Ibrahim's erratic policies and his summary execution of leading state officials. It ultimately led to his deposition in favor of his son Mehmed IV, ushering in a <b>further</b> <b>period</b> of confusion within the Ottoman government.|$|E

Inscriptions from the 17th century testify to Japanese settlements alongside those of the remaining Khmer. The best-known inscription tells of Ukondayu Kazufusa, who celebrated the Khmer New Year there in 1632. However, in following decades the Japanese community was absorbed into the local Khmer community, owing {{to the lack of}} new Japanese arrivals and very little possibility of renewing their community.|$|E
