50|$|<b>Indacrinone</b> is a loop diuretic. It {{can be used}} in {{patients}} of gout with hypertension as an antihypertensive because it decreases reabsorption of uric acid, while other diuretics increase it.|$|E
5000|$|The first {{reported}} {{example of this}} type of catalysis is attributed to Dolling, Davis & Grabowski who in 1984 used a chiral cinchonidine based phase transfer catalyst in the synthesis of <b>indacrinone.</b> Important chiral cation scaffolds are quaternary ammonium cations and quaternary phosphonium cations. The {{first reported}} example of asymmetric cation-binding catalysis originates from Cram and Sogah who in 1981 used a chiral crown ether in combination with a potassium base in an enantioselective Michael addition. The development of chiral anionic catalysists is a more recent research field. In 2000 Llewellyn, Adamson & Arndtsen used a chiral borate anion in olefin aziridination and cyclopropanation. Another regularly encountered scaffold is a chiral phosphate anion together with iminium, carbocationic or oxocarbenium counterions. Chiral anion phase-transfer catalysis was introduced by Toste in 2007.|$|E
40|$|<b>Indacrinone</b> is a loop {{diuretic}} {{which also has}} uricosuric, kaliuretic, saliuretic and natriuretic effects. Since {{it has been reported}} that this drug has several actions in different organs, we decided to evaluate its mechanism of action on the rat jejunum smooth muscle. After preparation of the tissues, different concentrations of <b>indacrinone</b> were applied. Doses of 8. 2 &times; 10 ^- 6 M, 2. 7 &times; 10 ^- 5 M, 8. 2 &times; 10 ^- 5 M and 2. 7 &times; 10 ^- 4 M were all effective in a dose dependent manner to relax the muscle. Increase in the drug concentration resulted in much faster reduction in twitch amplitude. The jejunum is innervated by adernergic, cholinergic, serotonergic and histaminergic systems. To find the mechanism of action of <b>indacrinone</b> in rat jejunum, experiments were conducted by appropriate receptor agonists and antagonists of the above systems. There was a marked increase in muscle contraction tone and ampliture by the use of histamine, while <b>indacrinone</b> prevented the increase induced by histamine. It was concluded that <b>indacrinone</b> may be a competitive antagonist for histamin receptors in rat jejunum muscle...|$|E
40|$|Purpose. The phenoxyacetic acid, ethacrynic acid (ECA), has {{potential}} use in glaucoma therapy because it acts to increase aqueous outflow in vivo and in vitro. In human trabecular meshwork (HTM) cell culture, ECA acts to change cell shape and attachment, effects {{that have been}} correlated with microtubule (MT) alterations and chemical sulfhydryl (SH) reactivity. To further explore these actions, we evaluated two non-SH reactive phenoxyacetic acids, <b>indacrinone</b> and ticrynafen, and the MT-disrupting drug vinblastine. Methods. Excised bovine and porcine eyes were perfused and outflow facility measured. Calf pulmonary artery endothelial and HTM cells were grown in culture and cytoskeletal effects evaluated after drug treatment. Results. <b>Indacrinone,</b> ticrynafen, and vinblastine all caused an increase in outflow facility. In contrast with ECA, the outflow effects of <b>indacrinone</b> and ticrynafen were not blocked by excess cysteine. Although <b>indacrinone</b> and ticrynafen produced changes in cell shape in vitro, the / 3 -tubulin staining pattern of treated cells was not altered. Vinblastine caused cell shape change and the expected MT disruption. Conclusions. Phenoxyacetic acids can increase aqueous outflow facility and alter HTM cel...|$|E
40|$|<b>Indacrinone,</b> a drug {{chemically}} {{related to}} ethacrynic acid, usually stimulated reversibly {{short circuit current}} and sodium influx when applied to the epithelial surface of amphibian skin. Concomitantly, transepithelial conductance, gt, decreased, provided chloride was the main anion in the incubation fluid. Electrophysiological analysis including microelectrode impalement indicated that the drug increased the sodium-conductance at the apical border of the impaled (most likely granular) cells. The decrease in gt thus points at shunt conductance being reduced with <b>indacrinone,</b> sometimes drastically. Decrease of transepithelial chloride flux with the drug as well as lack of effect of the drug on gt {{in the absence of}} chloride on the epithelial side demonstrate the influence of <b>indacrinone</b> on a chloride specific pathway. Whether this is along a paracellular route or through a cellular compartment not coupled to granular cells (mitochondria-rich cells?) cannot be decided {{on the basis of the}} present data. info:eu-repo/semantics/publishe...|$|E
40|$|The {{transepithelial}} flux of chloride {{was increased}} by aldosterone treatment of amphibian skin and bladder {{and this was}} reflected by increased "shunt" conductance. The hormonal effect depended {{on the presence of}} chloride on the epithelial side of the preparation. These changes in tissue conductance and chloride permeability appear to be a direct effect of aldosterone as they did not occur when sodium transport was stimulated with vasopressin or hypotonicity. Chloride efflux was reduced in magnitude by <b>indacrinone</b> and DIDS, as well as after removal of chloride from the solution on the epithelial side of the preparations. These results suggest that, rather than merely diffusing along (a) paracellular pathway(s), chloride flows through (a) cellular structure(s), notably mitochondria-rich cells. These cells can therefore be considered as targets for aldosterone. Â© 1986 Springer-Verlag. info:eu-repo/semantics/publishe...|$|E
40|$|When {{amphibian}} {{skin was}} incubated under {{conditions in which}} transepithelial sodium transport was abolished, a conductive transepithelial Cl- flux arose when Cl- was removed {{from one of the}} compartments. This flux was matched by short-circuit current and it accounted entirely for transepithelial conductance. Cl- influx was larger than efflux; it was linearly related to the magnitude of transepithelial Cl- concentration difference. When applied to the epithelial surface of the tissue, divalent metal cations such as Co 2 +, and the ethacrynic acid derivative, <b>indacrinone,</b> reduced rapidly and reversibly both transepithelial Cl- (in) flux and short-circuit current. Frog skin proved to be more sensitive to these inhibitors than toad skin. Further characterization of transepithelial Cl- pathway(s) should benefit from the fact that Cl- across amphibian skin can easily be monitored by the short-circuit current method, and from the availability of agents which inhibit this passive flux rapidly and reversibly...|$|E
40|$|The {{effects of}} <b>indacrinone</b> (IND) have been {{investigated}} in a two part study. First, a total of 36 clearance studies have been performed in 14 healthy volunteers, under conditions of either maximal hydration or hydropenia, to compare the renal sites of action of single oral doses of IND, 20 mg, ethacrynic acid (EA), 100 mg, and hydrochorothiazide (HCTZ), 100 mg. Under conditions of maximal water hydration, IND increased fractional Na+ excretion from a mean of 1. 19 +/- 0. 05 to 4. 93 +/- 0. 67 % of GFR. This {{was similar to the}} response seen with HCTZ, which increased fractional Na+ clearance up to 3. 16 +/- 0. 17 % of GFR; EA increased fractional Na+ excretion up to 14. 5 +/- 2. 5 % of GFR. The mean reduction in fractional free-water clearance (CH 2 O/GFR X 100 %) invoked by IND, (delta = - 34. 8 % of control) was similar to that produced by EA, (delta = - 27. 2 % of control), and by HCTZ, (delta = - 26. 6 % of control). During hydropenia with superimposed mannitol diuresis, both IND and EA caused a fall in fractional free-water reabsorption (TcH 2 O/GFR X 100 %), delta IND = - 20. 3 % of control, delta EA = - 70. 1 % of control. HCTZ produced a significant increase in fractional free-water reabsorption, delta HCTZ = - 20. 7 % of control. In all studies, single doses of IND were both uricosuric and hypouricaemic. Fractional urate excretion increased from a mean 6. 7 +/- 0. 1 to 15. 2 +/- 2. 1 % of GFR whilst plasma urate concentration fell from a mean of 0. 36 +/- 0. 03 to 0. 34 +/- 0. 03 mM (P less than 0. 05) within 2 - 3 h post drug. HCTZ and EA, in single doses, had little effect on urate excretion. In {{the second part of the}} study, a total of 16 healthy volunteers received either IND, 10 mg, or HCTZ 50 mg, orally for 8 days, whilst on a diet of controlled electrolyte content. Both drugs were well tolerated by both sets of subjects with no adverse clinical or pathological findings. Both IND and HCTZ caused a significant reduction in weight and standing systolic blood-pressure during the first 48 h of therapy. At the doses administered, IND and HCTZ displayed similar diuretic responses with respect to water, Na+, Cl-, Ca 2 + and PO 4 (3 -) excretion. IND produced less kaliuresis than HCTZ during the first treatment day but cumulative K+ loss was similar for both drugs over the eight days of therapy. Fractional urate excretion after IND remained elevated throughout the 8 days of therapy and the subjects remained isouricaemic for 7 days. (ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS...|$|E
