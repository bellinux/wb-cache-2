Though Cooper opened by setting forth the reasons <b>for</b> <b>his</b> <b>resignation</b> and Churchill spoke harshly against the pact, no Conservative {{voted against the}} government.

5|$|Day's {{leadership}} of the Canadian Alliance became increasingly troubled throughout the summer of 2001, as several party MPs called <b>for</b> <b>his</b> <b>resignation.</b> In June, the National Post newspaper reported that former Reform MP Ian McClelland was organizing a possible leadership challenge on Harper's behalf. Harper announced his resignation from the NCC presidency in August 2001, to prepare a campaign.|$|E
5|$|The {{immediate}} {{effect of the}} rebels' success helped convince Porfirio Díaz {{to agree to the}} revolutionaries' demand <b>for</b> <b>his</b> <b>resignation.</b> Prompted by Limantour, two days {{after the end of the}} battle Díaz signed the Treaty of Ciudad Juárez with Madero, and ten days after the battle he resigned and went into exile in France. This ended the first stage of the Mexican Revolution, and at the same time made it clear that even well-garrisoned troops were not invulnerable to guerrilla armies.|$|E

5|$|A {{week before}} the start of the Grand Prix weekend, the News of the World alleged that Max Mosley, the {{president}} of Formula One's governing body, the Fédération Internationale de l'Automobile (FIA), had engaged in sexual acts with five prostitutes. While Mosley denied the allegations, he cancelled his scheduled appearance at the Bahrain Grand Prix. Several teams condemned Mosley's alleged actions and asked <b>for</b> <b>his</b> <b>resignation,</b> and while for a time the controversy threatened to overshadow the race, Mosley eventually retained his position and successfully sued the News of the World for the report.|$|E
5|$|Following {{his term}} as governor, Powell {{was elected to}} the U.S. Senate. Before he could assume office, President James Buchanan {{dispatched}} Powell and Major Benjamin McCulloch to Utah to ease tensions with Brigham Young and the Mormons. Powell assumed his Senate seat on his return from Utah, just prior to the election of Abraham Lincoln as president. Powell became an outspoken critic of Lincoln's administration, {{so much so that the}} Kentucky General Assembly asked <b>for</b> <b>his</b> <b>resignation</b> and some of his fellow senators tried to have him expelled from the body. Both groups later renounced their actions.|$|E
5|$|Protests erupted {{soon after}} the release of the video, and on Black Friday protesters shut down part of the city's Magnificent Mile. Public calls for {{resignation}} grew steadily over this period, including a well-circulated op-ed published in The New York Times. By early December, Emanuel's approval rating had sunk to 18%, with 67% of Chicagoans disapproving of his job performance and slightly more than half of those polled calling <b>for</b> <b>his</b> <b>resignation.</b> During the week of December 10, protestors blocked streets and continued to call for Emanuel to resign. Additional protests against Emanuel and Chicago's Police Department were held on the city's busy Michigan Avenue shopping area on December 24, 2015.|$|E

5|$|Chapman {{returned}} to Leeds City from Barnbow after hostilities had ended, but resigned suddenly in December 1918, eventually moving to Selby {{to take up}} a position as a superintendent at an oil and coke works. No reason was given <b>for</b> <b>his</b> <b>resignation,</b> but as football resumed in 1919–20, Leeds City were accused by a former player of financial irregularities, involving illegal payments to guest players during wartime matches. No documentary evidence was produced, but Leeds' refusal to allow the authorities access to their financial records was deemed a sign of guilt, and they were expelled from the Football League in October 1919 and five club officials, including Chapman, were banned from football for life. The club was dissolved, with the players auctioned off and their Elland Road ground taken over by the newly formed Leeds United.|$|E
5|$|Following the sacking of Graeme Souness as Newcastle {{manager in}} February 2006, Bruce was again {{linked with the}} job, which {{ultimately}} went to Glenn Roeder. By {{this stage of the}} 2005–06 season, Birmingham were struggling in the league, and on 21 March 2006 were beaten 7–0 at home by Liverpool in the FA Cup quarter-finals. Some supporters of the club began to call <b>for</b> <b>his</b> <b>resignation,</b> but Bruce insisted that he would fight on as manager. The team managed to climb out of the relegation zone {{for the first time in}} nearly six months after a win over Bolton Wanderers in early April 2006. However, they were soon overtaken by Portsmouth, whose victory over Wigan Athletic on 29 April left Birmingham mathematically unable to match their points total and therefore relegated.|$|E
5|$|In December 2009, the Supreme Court {{ruled that}} the National Reconciliation Ordinance amnesty was unconstitutional, which {{cleared the way for}} the revival of {{corruption}} cases against Zardari. Though Zardari had immunity from prosecution because he was President, the end of NRO and his earlier corruption cases challenged the legality of his presidency. Calls <b>for</b> <b>his</b> <b>resignation</b> escalated. Zardari, who rarely left the Aiwan-e-Sadr presidential palace, responded with a nationwide spurt of speeches in January 2011. In January 2010, the Supreme Court ordered Pakistan's government to reopen Zardari's corruption charges in Switzerland. However, Zardari prevented the MQM-leaning Attorney General, Anwar Mansoor, from filing charges, so Mansoor resigned in protest in early April. That same month, Zardari won a key victory against the judiciary over his corruption trials when Geneva Attorney General Daniel Zappelli stated that Zardari can not be prosecuted under international laws because of his presidential immunity. Zardari was supported by Prime Minister Gilani, who defied the Supreme Court order.|$|E

5|$|Midway {{through his}} {{four-year}} term, Meisdalshagen was appointed Minister of Finance in Gerhardsen's Second Cabinet. He served from 6 December 1947 to 19 November 1951, when Torp's Cabinet was formed. Prime Minister Einar Gerhardsen and former party secretary Martin Tranmæl were the architects behind his appointment. Ultimately, Meisdalshagen's {{opposition to the}} Labour Party's foreign and defence policy in general, and extraordinary monetary grants for defence measures specifically, was cited as the reason <b>for</b> <b>his</b> <b>resignation</b> from the cabinet, and even for the entire cabinet shift. During his period as minister, Meisdalshagen's parliamentary seat was occupied by Gunnar Kalrasten until June 1948 and then by Thorvald Ulsnæs. He was succeeded as Minister of Finance by Trygve Bratteli; other candidates were discussed but rejected, including Meisdalshagen's old acquaintance Klaus Sunnanå.|$|E
5|$|Murphy {{took the}} party into the 2015 United Kingdom general election, which saw a {{majority}} {{win for the}} Conservatives, and Labour's worst-ever election result in Scotland. There was a landslide shift towards the SNP, which took 56 of the 59 Scottish seats at Westminster, while Labour lost 40 of the 41 Westminster seats it was defending. Notable losses included Murphy's constituency of East Renfrewshire and Brown's former constituency of Kirkcaldy and Cowdenbeath, previously Labour's safest seat in Scotland. Other high-profile figures such as Sarwar, Clark, Curran, Ian Davidson, and Shadow Foreign Secretary Douglas Alexander also lost their seats. Following his defeat, Murphy spoke of his intention to stand for a Holyrood seat in 2016. However, the result prompted Labour figures {{and those in the}} trade union movement to question the future of his leadership. Ian Davidson suggested that {{it would be difficult for}} Murphy to remain as Scottish Labour leader without a parliamentary seat and in the wake of such a heavy defeat. Rafferty, and Kevin Lindsay of ASLEF, called <b>for</b> <b>his</b> <b>resignation,</b> while Findlay, and Labour's local government spokesman Alex Rowley, expressed their concerns about the party's future under Murphy's leadership and resigned from his shadow cabinet.|$|E

50|$|In {{theology}} he {{upheld the}} Arminian doctrines of free will, universal redemption and general atonement, against the Calvinist doctrines of unconditional election and limited atonement. His Arminian theology is most clearly outlined {{in his famous}} Checks to Antinomianism. He attempted to confront his (and John Wesley's) theological adversaries with courtesy and fairness, although some of his contemporaries judged him harshly <b>for</b> <b>his</b> writings. <b>His</b> <b>resignation</b> on doctrinal grounds of the superintendency (1768-1771) of the countess of Huntingdon's college at Trevecca left no unpleasantness. Fletcher was characterized by saintly piety, rare devotion, and blamelessness of life, and the testimony of his contemporaries to his godliness is unanimous.|$|R
