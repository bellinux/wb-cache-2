50|$|The LMR {{operated}} {{two sets}} of six first-class cars, the WR three sets of eight cars with first- and second-class seating. Withdrawal of the Midland Pullman allowed operation of 12-car formations. The seating in {{the full length of}} the parlour cars was augmented by seated sections in the motor and <b>kitchen</b> <b>cars,</b> and motor cars also had a passenger compartment. <b>Kitchen</b> <b>cars</b> and Midland Pullman power cars had had one toilet, parlour cars two.|$|R
50|$|The {{sets were}} formed from three basic types of car: motor <b>car,</b> <b>kitchen</b> <b>car</b> and parlour car. The cars were {{permanently}} coupled and hermetically sealed for {{maintenance of the}} air-conditioning settings. The sets were symmetrical with a motor car at each end, and two <b>kitchen</b> <b>cars</b> serving their respective halves of the train. In an emergency, the buffers {{on the front of}} the sets were used in conjunction with a normally concealed coupling hook.|$|R

50|$|Most coaches ran on two four-wheel bogies {{which were}} of a 9 ft 0 in {{wheelbase}} single bolster design which hardly changed {{for the whole of}} the company's life. Some special vehicles ran on twelve wheel chassis and the six-wheel bogie on these vehicles was of 12 ft 6 in wheel-base, based on the London and North Western Railway design. All coaches except <b>kitchen</b> <b>cars</b> were electrically lit and normally fitted with vacuum brake as standard.|$|R

50|$|With the {{original}} stock scrapped, {{they had to}} provide a new fleet, which consisted of a rake of air-conditioned Mk.2 coaches fitted with Pullman style lighting, topped and tailed by Class 47 diesel locomotives. As no Mk.2 <b>kitchen</b> <b>cars</b> had been built, two Mk.1 coaches were inserted into the set. The Mk.2s were painted in {{the original}} livery of Nanking Blue with a white band around the windows, but, as the Mk.1 vehicles had much larger windows, they were simply painted in plain blue. This unfortunately broke up {{the lines of the}} train somewhat.|$|R
5000|$|The GWR was {{reluctant}} to use Pullman Carriages, considering its own carriages luxurious enough. However, in 1928 the GWR board approved the lease from Pullman Company of seven <b>cars</b> - four <b>Kitchen</b> <b>Cars</b> and three Parlour Cars, No's 252-258 - with construction subcontracted to Metropolitan Cammell in Birmingham.

50|$|The train's two dining {{cars have}} been {{replaced}} over the years. Dining Car 1, {{which used to be}} a Gresley <b>kitchen</b> <b>car,</b> was damaged in a shunting incident on depot and, as a wooden (Teak) bodied vehicle was deemed unsafe to continue passenger operations, it was withdrawn from mainline service. It was followed in 1992 by Pullman car Raven, acquired {{at the same time as}} the others in the train. Dining Car 2 used to be 99131, an ex-LNER SC1999 c0ach named Victory.

The five-coach Royal Train was pulled by a Maunsell E1 class 4-4-0 No. 31067, Her Majesty using a Pullman car named Malaga, which was flanked by two corridor composites; there was a corridor third brake {{at each end of}} the train. Malaga was one of six twelve-wheel first-class <b>kitchen</b> <b>cars</b> which had been built in 1920–1; and following an extensive refit in late 1949, was occasionally used in the Royal Train.

50|$|During February 2011, Driving Car 88 was {{displayed}} on the Brighton seafront to celebrate the acquisition of the Trust's fifth car. The fifth 5BEL car required was Pullman First Doris, then based at the Bluebell Railway for the Bluebell's pullman rake, and thus a swap was arranged. The 5-BEL Trust had purchased Golden Arrow Pullman <b>Kitchen</b> <b>Car</b> Carina and supplied this to the Bluebell railway in exchange for Doris, allowing the Bluebell Railway to complete a five-car all-Pullman Golden Arrow rake. Carina is of considerable heritage importance, having formed part of Winston Churchill's funeral train which carried the principal mourners from London to Bladon on 30 January 1965.|$|R

50|$|The 5-in-1 was {{developed}} in 1942 by the Subsistence Research Laboratory (SRL) of the U.S. Army's Quartermaster Corps to fulfill {{a need for a}} pre-packaged field ration for use by small motorized combat groups. The 5-in-1 allowed small groups of soldiers or large groups divided into multiple units to cook meals without the need of complex kitchen utensils or cooking skill. Another objective was to furnish sufficient food to take care of five men for one day. The U.S. Quartermaster Corps' Subsistence Branch originally planned for the rations to be used by troops without immediate kitchen facilities, such as trains without <b>kitchen</b> <b>cars,</b> motorized infantry, armored vehicle crews, or gun crews.|$|R

The rural resort hotels were located in areas served by the CPR which had unique scenery, allowing these properties to be marketed as tourist destinations for passenger train travellers. Some of these resort hotels also served as [...] "stationary dining cars", where en route passengers were fed and housed, without the train having to carry heavy dining and <b>kitchen</b> <b>cars</b> over difficult terrain.|$|R
