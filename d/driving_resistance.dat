40|$|Abstract. The {{purpose of}} this study is to provide a simple method for {{estimating}} the <b>driving</b> <b>resistance</b> of rubber conveyer belts. The <b>driving</b> <b>resistance</b> of a rubber belt running on the carrier roller was estimated by a resistance force acting on a roller moving on the rubber conveyer belt while the belt was fixed on an aluminum channel. Four types of conveyor belts were tested to confirm the present technique is useful for grading rubber conveyer belts from a viewpoint of energy dissipation on the carrier rollers of the conveyer system. The effects of normal force acting on the roller and driving speed of the roller on the resistance force were investigated. Four belts were fabricated with different rubber types of rubber, respectively. It was confirmed from the experiments that the estimated resistance force varied with respect to the rubber characteristics, which was consistent to the experience from the existing belt conveyer systems for energy consumption. The resistance force of the carrier roller increases with an increase of roller speed. It also decreases when a lower damping rubber is used while the belt rigidity does not affect the resistance force when low resistance rubber is used. The proposed method is applicable to estimate the total energy loss of rubber conveyer belts on the carrier rollers...|$|E
40|$|The Hiley formula {{underestimates}} <b>driving</b> <b>resistance</b> of long piles. Methods using affected pile length {{have been}} suggested, {{but have been}} found to be inapplicable for high-capacity piles. The impact compression behaviors of about 4700 high-capacity H-piles that were 14 - 80 m long at final set were studied. Measured data revealed that maximum impact forces are very scattered, but their means are independent of the hammer type, ram weight, ram drop, impact velocity, and pile length. Maximum impact compression of pile and affected pile length exist in both long and short piles. The affected pile length in turn is significant to the blow efficiency, hammer constant, and energy transfer ratio. This length is governed by the impact momentum and impact energy, and can be estimated by an energy-based equation. If the affected pile length determined by this equation is substituted into the Hiley formula to back-analyze the <b>driving</b> <b>resistance,</b> predictability of the driving formula can be improved by about 8 %. This improvement is significant enough to reduce the number of hammer blows required at very hard driving conditions and reduce pile damage. Furthermore, this proposed equation is simple to use in the field and is more economical compared with stress-wave monitoring techniques...|$|E

40|$|About 92 % of all <b>driving</b> <b>resistances</b> {{in cities}} are {{influenced}} by the mass of a vehicle [3]. Therefore, the optimization of a vehicle‘s weight is essential for its driving characteristics and its ecological footprint. Starting a lightweight car body design from scratch is a good opportunity to rethink a conventional approach and rather take a look at nature‘s designs, which have been successful for millions of years. Experienced automotive developer Arno Jambor had the idea {{to take a closer look}} at the skull of prehistoric Simosaurus gaillardoti (H. v. Meyer, 1842). There are several analogies between the skull and a car body in terms of impact protection, bending- and torsion stress. Nevertheless, both structures need to be light.

The skull shows elements of Mattheck‘s thinktools according to nature, like the axiom of constant stress and shear stress elimination [6]. The upper jaw aligns to a parabola, spreading the load planar along the skull [4]. These perceptions form the principles to convert the saurian skull to a roadster body. With a package to fulfill and the principles derived from nature, a roadster body was created that showed positive results in various Euro NCAP crash simulations.

The optimum size of this energy store, {{often referred to as the}} battery capacity measured in ampere-hours (Ah) or kilowatt-hours (kWh), depends on the specific application, design limitations, costs and the degradation of the particular battery pack. Validated by 'real-world' driving data from the Imperial College Racing Green Endurance (RGE) flagship electric supercar, the SRZero, a software model following a quasi-steady, backward-forward facing and equivalent circuit approach is introduced. This model is also supported by the results of the 2010, 2011 and 2012 RAC Future Car Challenges as well as by battery life testing from a lab environment. Furthermore, travel surveys from the United Kingdom (UK), Germany and the United States (US) have been analysed and then converted into input parameters for this algorithm.
