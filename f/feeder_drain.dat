40|$|Cirsoid {{aneurysm}} of scalp {{is a rare}} {{arteriovenous malformation}} (AVM) of external carotid branches and scalp veins. This malformation of scalp is also synonymously called as plexiform angioma, aneurysma racesomsum, and aneurysm cirsoide, aneurysma serpentinum. This AVM can be congenital or acquired; a congenital form will be present at birth, however, becomes overt only after puberty. Superficial temporal artery is the feeder in approximately 70 - 80 % of the cases, followed by occipital and supraorbital artery. Multidetector computed tomography angiography reconstructed images can provide excellent detail of the <b>feeders,</b> <b>draining</b> veins and their soft tissue relations. Volume rendering data sets in computer workstations we can actually perform virtual dissection layers of the lesion for operative planning. Well planned surgical excision can have least surgical recurrence rates and complications...|$|R
40|$|Pial {{arteriovenous}} fistulae (AVF) {{are rare}} vascular lesions comprising single or multiple arterial <b>feeders</b> <b>draining</b> {{directly into the}} venous channel without intervening tangle of blood vessels as in brain AV malformations. In our present paper, we describe three cases of pial AVF in the pediatric age group with different presentations treated successfully with endovascular and surgical methods. Two patients underwent treatment for pial AVF by the endovascular technique and one by surgical clipping. The treatments were successful with good clinical outcome. We did not encounter any peri-procedural complications {{in any of the}} cases. Pial AVF is a rare entity and high degree of suspicion and adequate clinical and imaging knowledge is required to make the diagnosis. Exclusion of the fistula from the cerebral circulation should be done at the earliest to prevent devastating complications that result during the natural course of the disease...|$|R
50|$|The {{drainage}} of {{the wetlands}} was organised into {{a combination of}} river and manmade drainage, aiding the passing of upland water through the region with internal drainage of the land between existing rivers. The internal drainage {{was designed to be}} organized by levels or districts each of which includes the fen parts of one or several parishes. The details of the organisation varies with the history of their development, but Keal Cotes falls within the Witham Fourth District: (East, West and Wildmore Fens and the Townland from Boston to Wainfleet). The manmade East Fen Catchwater Drain passes close to Keal Cotes ensuring that, although low lying, the possibility of flooding is almost non existent. Minor problems have occurred in recent years through farmers and householders failing to properly complete the expected annual clearing of minor <b>feeder</b> <b>drains</b> around their properties. Additionally many householders have chosen to pipe the drains through and around their gardens, greatly reducing their ability to handle higher levels of land drainage in heavy rain.|$|R
2500|$|In {{order to}} improve the gravity {{discharge}} {{of water from the}} district, the sluice into the River Nene at Peters Point was rebuilt in 1937. Its width was reduced slightly to , but the cill was lowered to [...] below Ordnance Datum. In order to cope with the silty sub-soil in which the foundations had to be built, well point dewatering equipment was used {{for the first time in}} England. This consists of inserting small tubes into the ground and pumping them with a high-efficiency vacuum pump to lower the ground water levels, creating a dry and stable working environment. The need to grow more food during the Second World War led to large areas of low-lying grassland being ploughed up for crops, and this required improved drainage. The Main Drain Improvement Scheme was drawn up in 1942, and widening and deeping of the Main Drain and other channels was carried out. Ten new bridges were required, to accommodate the wider channels, and old brick structures were demolished and replaced by open span bridges. <b>Feeder</b> <b>drains</b> were improved, and the area served by the drainage board increased to [...]|$|R
40|$|Background: Polypoidal choroidal vasculopathy (PCV) is {{characterized}} by the presence of polyps with or without a branching vascular network and more prevalent among Asians. The aim {{of this study was to}} compare the outcomes of conbercept therapy between two different angiographic subtypes of PCV. Methods: Fifty-eight patients of PCV were classified into two phenotypes according to indocyanine green angiography (ICGA). In Type 1, both <b>feeder</b> and <b>draining</b> vessels are visible on ICGA and network vessels are numerous. In Type 2, neither <b>feeder</b> nor <b>draining</b> vessels are detectable, and the number of network vessels is small. The patients were treated with intravitreal conbercept (IVC) for 3 months. Additional IVC was given at subsequent monthly visits, if needed. The patients were followed up for 12 months, and changes in mean best-corrected visual acuity (BCVA), central retinal thickness (CRT), subretinal fluid (SRF) thickness, pigmented epithelial detachment (PED), hemorrhage, and number of polypoidal lesions were evaluated. Results: The mean BCVA in Type 2 PCV (15. 92 ± 9. 76 letters) achieved a significantly greater improvement than that in the Type 1 (14. 10 ± 9. 07 letters) at month 12 (t = 2. 37, P 0. 05). Conclusion: Classification systems for PCV will show differences in presentation, natural history, or response to anti-vascular endothelial growth factor treatment and might, therefore, provide a new key to the choice of treatment for the disease...|$|R
40|$|An {{investigation}} of metamorphic high electron mobility transistor stability at cryogenic temperature {{is presented in}} this paper. Unlike {{in the case of}} two-finger transistors, the measurements of cooled four-finger devices with large gate widths exhibit unstable behavior in the form of steps in the current voltage characteristics, discontinuities in the transconductance, and reduced gain. This unstable behavior has hampered the reliable realization of low-noise amplifiers for cryogenic applications. We study different gate-width devices with a multiport transistor model, allowing the separation of gate and <b>drain</b> <b>feeder</b> structures from the active part of the transistor. The simulation reveals the presence of resonances in the frequency region of several hundreds of gigahertz. We demonstrate that the resonances disappear when an air bridge is placed across the fingers of the <b>drain</b> <b>feeder</b> structure, and confirm the stabilizing effect of the air bridge both on device and circuit level by cryogenic measurements...|$|R

40|$|Purpose: To {{report a}} case of retinal {{capillary}} hemangioma treated with verteporfin photodynamic therapy combined with intravitreal triamcinolone acetonide. Methods: A 15 -year-old female presented with metamorphopsia in the left eye for 7 days. Examination showed peripheral endophytic retinal capillary hemangioma, macular edema, and a best-corrected visual acuity of 20 / 50. The hemangioma and macular edema were treated with verteporfin photodynamic therapy and intravitreal triamcinolone acetonide. Results: After 5 months of follow-up, involution of the hemangioma, reduction of macular edema, decrease of the <b>feeder</b> and <b>draining</b> vessel diameter, and improvement of best-corrected visual acuity to 20 / 25 was seen. Conclusions: This verteporfin photodynamic therapy combined with intravitreal triamcinolone acetonide appeared to cause involution of the hemangioma with reduction in macular edema and improvement in visual acuity...|$|R

30|$|The {{abnormal}} {{communications between}} arteries and veins outside the capillary level are called arteriovenous malformations (AVMs) and {{result from a}} failed embryologic vascular development process. The dysplastic connection may be between a single arterial <b>feeder</b> and a <b>draining</b> vein that is usually enlarged, {{and this is the}} case of the arteriovenous fistulas or AVFs, or between a conglomerate of arterial branches and tortuous channels forming a nidus and one or more draining veins. Both types may be present in the renal vasculature in the form of either congenital renal arteriovenous fistulas (CRAVFs) or renal arteriovenous malformations (RAVMs).|$|R
40|$|Purpose: The complex angioarchitecture of spinal dural {{arteriovenous}} fistulas (SDAVFs) sometimes preclude angiographic analyses or superselective procedures. Therefore, {{the effectiveness}} of 3 dimensional rotational angiography (3 DRA) as a detailed imaging technique for SDAVFs was evaluated. Materials and Methods: Of 57 patients with spinal vascular malformations, recent 13 SDAVF patients underwent 3 DRA. The advantage of 3 DRA compared to digital subtraction angiography (DSA) in imaging SDAVF was assessed. Angioarchitecture of SDAVF was focused on location, number, and course of <b>feeders</b> and <b>draining</b> vein. Appropriate angled views were also selected to reveal the segmental artery and feeders. Results: 3 DRA technique provided additional information for imaging evaluation of SDAVFs compared to DSA; the presence of multiple feeders, including their transdural portions, {{as well as their}} courses. The contralaterally angled anterior-oblique-caudal (spider) view showed the radicular feeder by separating the intercostal artery and the dorsal muscular branch. The bottom-to-up (tunnel) view was useful for revealing the location (ventral vs. dorsal) including sharp medial turn of the dural feeder. The dual mode, which displays both vessels and bones, revealed the course of the feeders and the fistula related to the spinal bony column...|$|R
40|$|Anterior cranial fossa dural {{arteriovenous}} fistulae (DAVFs) {{are very}} rare and the bleeding rate is very high, {{especially in the}} presence of leptomeningeal draining vein and aneurysmal varix formation. A 85 -year-old male patient presented with subdural hematoma (SDH). Magnetic resonance image (MRI) and transfemoral carotid angiography (TFCA) disclosed DAVF at the anterior cranial fossa with bilateral arterial <b>feeders</b> and leptomeningeal <b>draining</b> vein with varix formation. The lesion was treated by simple ligation of pial connecting vein using low frontal craniotomy. In comparison with DAVFs of the other sites, the anterior cranial fossa DAVF is difficult to manage by endovascular treatment due to not only the difficulty of transvenous access but the risk of visual impairment when using transarterial route. Surgical ligation of pial connecting vein is feasible and effective treatment...|$|R
40|$|PURPOSE: To {{describe}} the clinical, angiographic and {{optical coherence tomography}} (OCT) findings of a patient with a large retinal capillary hemangioma who was treated by indocyanine green-mediated photothrombosis. DESIGN: Interventional case report. METHODS: An 18 -year,old male patient was treated at a tertiary referral center with a novel laser-dye procedure that uses low-irradiance 810 -nm laser and intravenous indocyanine green injection and was prospectively evaluated with fluorescein and indocyanine green angiography, as well as OCT. RESULTS: Vision improved from 20 / 125 to 20 / 32 + 1 at 1 -year follow-up. Fundus photography showed marked reduction of a 3 disk diameters retinal capillary hemangioma. Both fluorescein and indocyanine green angiography demonstrated reduced tumor perfusion and narrowing of the lesion <b>feeder</b> and <b>draining</b> vessels, as early as 5 days after indocyanine green-mediated photothrombosis; OCT showed immediate decrease in retinal elevation and complete resolution of subretinal fluid within 2 months of treatment. Minimal laser,induced effects were noted {{in the vicinity of}} the tumor. CONCLUSIONS: Photothrombosis using low,intensity, 810 -nm light to direct laser energy continuously at the tumor after intravenous indocyanine green infusion was effective in restoring macular architecture and improving vision in a patient with a large peripheral retinal capillary hemangioma by means of substantial occlusion of the tumor vasculature and resolution of subretinal fluid.

40|$|BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: 4 D MRA {{has been}} {{evolving}} as a noninvasive supplement for DSA. The {{purpose of this}} study was to evaluate the feasibility of a newly developed blood flow visualization technique for the classification of cerebral AVMs. We hypothesized that 4 D-hMRA allows detection of different flow patterns within the nidus as well as differentiation of <b>feeders</b> and <b>draining</b> veins and has very good agreement with DSA regarding the Spetzler-Martin grade. MATERIALS ANDMETHODS: Thirty-one consecutive patients with AVMswere evaluated by using 4 D-hMRA andDSA by 2 blinded raters. Rating criteria included Spetzler-Martin score and other morphologic variables together with a new scale for 3 intranidal flow patterns (homogeneous 1, unidirectional 2, heterogeneous 3). RESULTS: The Spetzler-Martin grades were rated different from DSA in 5 cases by rater 1 and in 3 cases by rater 2 with an excellent interrater reliability of 0. 96 (4 / 31, 1 by size and 3 by drainage). Each reader missed 5 feeders on 4 D-hMRA. Draining veins were distinguished in the temporal course in 7 on DSA but in 8 and 12 on 4 D-hybrid-MRA (raters 1 and 2 respectively), with 0. 79. A type 1 intranidal flow pattern was recognizable in 9 (30 %) patients; type 2, in 19 (60 %); and type 3, in 3 (10 %). CONCLUSIONS: 4 D-hMRA allows reliable Spetzler-Martin grading and detection of brain arteriovenous malformation feeding arteries and draining veins, with the drawback that for small vessels DSA is still needed. Draining veins might even be detected with higher sensitivity than on DSA. Discrimination of different intranidal flow patterns is possible, but their relevance for hemorrhage risk assessmen...|$|R
40|$|BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Cerebral {{arteriovenous}} malformations (AVMs) are occa-sionally {{associated with}} hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia (HHT), which {{is characterized by}} the presence of multiple mucocutaneous telangiectasia, epistaxis, and familial inheritance. We analyzed the angiographic and clinical characteristics of patients with cerebral AVMs related to HHT. METHODS: Among 638 patients with cerebral AVMs, we identified 14 patients with HHT. The AVMs were classified as those with nidi of 1 cm or less (micro AVMs), those with nidi between 1 and 3 cm (small AVMs), and those of the fistulous type (arteriovenous fistulas [AVFs]). RESULTS: A total of 28 AVMs were found; seven of 14 patients had multiple AVMs. The 28 AVMs were categorized as 12 micro AVMs, eight small AVMs, and eight AVFs. All except one micro AVM were asymptomatic, whereas all small AVMs were symptomatic. Three of eight AVFs were asymptomatic. All 28 AVMs were located on the cortex. All micro AVMs and AVFs had single <b>feeders</b> and single <b>draining</b> veins, whereas the small AVMs had multiple feeders in all lesions and single draining veins in six of eight lesions...|$|R
40|$|Springer-Verlag 2011 Sir, We {{report a}} case of 40 -year-old sportsman {{admitted}} to our department for a generalized seizure associated with bladder and bowel incontinence occurred during exercise. The patient quickly regained consciousness without postcritical deficits. Neurological examination appeared completely normal. A head computer tomography (CT) scan showed a midline arteriovenous malformation (AVM) without the evidence of bleeding (Fig. 1 a, b). A digital subtraction angiography revealed a dysplastic nidus fed by branches of bilateral internal–external carotid and vertebrobasilar arteries, and draining both in the superficial and deep venous system, which showed varicose dilatation with Galen’s vein stenosis (Fig. 1 c–g). Cerebral varix is defined as an ectasia which doubles vein diameter. It can be due to an arteriovenous shunt and appears more common in patients with direct fistulas, than in cerebral AVM with dysplastic nidi [1]. Differently from those associated with Galen’s vein fistulae, huge intracranial varix associated with cerebral AVMs were seldom reported. Headache, bruit, focal mass effect and hydrocephalus are common presentation symptoms [2]. Intracranial haemorrhage has been instead less often reported at clinical onset [3]. In {{the most of the}} cases of giant varix, direct arteriovenous communications in the context of nidus were observed, especially between feeding arteries and the varicose veins [4]. This discrete angiographic finding separate these vascular malformations from the classical and more common AVMs in which an abnormal vascular network is identified between the arterial <b>feeders</b> and <b>draining</b> veins [4]. Venous hypertension with retrograde drainage often results in focal neurological deficits and seizures [1]. Although it is commonly assumed that venous ectasia increases the bleeding risk, varix haemorrhagic presentation has been rarely reported [4]. It is {{may be due to the}} progressive thickening of the arterialized veins wall, with intimal proliferation of synthetic smoothmuscle cells and disappearance of the internal elastic lamina, that make arterialized veins not greatly prone to rupture [1, 4]. On the other hand, instead, the presence of venous varix on the draining veins has been recognized as a factor increasing the risk of haemorrhage in dural arteriovenous fistulae [5]. In the case reported here, the presence of multiple feeders causing high flow shunt rate, direct drainage in a cisternal venous system, and an impaired venous outlet due to the Galen’s vein stenosis, may have contributed to the varix formation. Prolonged sporting activity, instead, has not been a factor influencing AVM rupture...|$|R

40|$|Proceedings of the 2007 Georgia Water Resources Conference, March 27 - 29, 2007, Athens, Georgia. The Vernon River basin drains 16, 000 {{acres of}} densely populated, {{urbanized}} area that includes {{portions of the}} City of Savannah and Chatham County {{and all of the}} City of Vernonburg. The upper reaches of the basin are comprised of several urban storm water drainage canals, including Casey Canal, which discharge into Hayners Creek, one of many small <b>feeder</b> creeks <b>draining</b> to the Vernon River. Hayners Creek and Casey Canal are listed on Georgia’s 303 (d) list as not supporting their designated Fishing classification due to fecal coliform, dissolved oxygen, and fish consumption guideline water quality criteria. Conventional methods to determine the source of fecal coliform bacteria have been unsuccessful to date. Stakeholders within the Vernon River Watershed, including the Skidaway Institute of Oceanography, the cities of Savannah and Vernonburg, the Chatham County Heath Department, and Integrated Science & Engineering, Inc, understand that is critically important to identify the sources of fecal contamination in order to develop a workable management plan to eliminate the identified sources. Through Georgia Environmental Protection Division 319 grant funding assistance, the Vernon River Stakeholders’ Project Team will utilize Assessing Multiple Antibiotic Resistance (MAR) and Ribosomal RNA (rRNA) Fingerprinting to track and identify the source of bacterial contamination in the Vernon River basin. This project will also evaluate viral tagging of fecal bacteria in septic systems as an effective indicator of septic functionality. Once the source(s) of fecal contamination are identified through the bacterial source tracking program, the Project Team will develop best management practices to address and eliminate those identified sources. Once established, these BMPs will likely be incorporated into the future TMDL Implementation Plan for the Vernon River basin. Because this basin is typical of coastal communities in the region, the BMPs developed through this project will likely be applicable on a regional scale. Sponsored and Organized by: U. S.
