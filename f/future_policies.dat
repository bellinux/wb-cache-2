500|$|Operation Barbarossa and the {{subsequent}} German failure to achieve their objectives changed the political landscape of Europe dividing it into Eastern and Western blocs. The political vacuum left in {{the eastern half of}} the continent was filled by the USSR when Stalin secured his territorial prizes of 1944–1945 and firmly placed his Red Army in Bulgaria, Romania, Hungary, Poland, Czechoslovakia, and the eastern half of Germany. Stalin's fear of any resurgence of German power and his distrust in the former Allied powers contributed to Soviet pan-Slavic initiatives and a subsequent alliance of Slavic states. Historians David Glantz and Jonathan House reference Operation Barbarossa's influence not only on Stalin but subsequent Soviet leaders, claiming it [...] "colored" [...] their strategic mindsets for the [...] "next four decades" [...] and instigated the creation of [...] "an elaborate system of buffer and client states, designed to insulate the Soviet Union from any possible future attack." [...] As a consequence, Eastern Europe became communist in political disposition and Western Europe fell under the democratic sway of the United States, a nation uncertain about its <b>future</b> <b>policies</b> in Europe.|$|E

Jazz's potential for being linked with the down-trodden minorities and pariahs of German society - the blacks and Jews - rendered it suspect. The <b>future</b> <b>policies</b> emerging against Jazz were encouraged by German musicologists and radio spokesmen. In 1935, attempting to widen the perceived gap between [...] "Nigger-Jew Jazz" [...] and [...] "German Jazz", Hans Otto Fricke used his prominent status {{as the director of}} [...] "Radio Frankfurt", giving a two-part lecture series on the subject. To a great extent, Jazz shared a similar fate with other postwar modernist art such as atonal music. It wasn't until 1931 that many crucial British and American jazz players began to leave the country as they faced increasing xenophobic harassment from colleagues and authorities. [...] Many thought that the death of Jazz was upon them, but little did they anticipate that it would be reborn into vitality and health under a dictatorship.|$|E

Each year the World Future Council chooses one topic on which policy progress is particularly urgent. In 2009, the <b>Future</b> <b>Policy</b> Award highlighted exemplary policies for food security.

2500|$|A 2011 report [...] "China's Rare-Earth Industry", {{issued by}} the US Geological Survey and US Department of the Interior, {{outlines}} industry trends within China and examines national policies that may guide {{the future of the}} country's production. The report notes that China's lead in the production of rare-earth minerals has accelerated over the past two decades. In 1990, China accounted for only 27% of such minerals. In 2009, world production was 132,000 metric tons; China produced 129,000 of those tons. According to the report, recent patterns suggest that China will slow the export of such materials to the world: [...] "Owing to the increase in domestic demand, the Government has gradually reduced the export quota during the past several years." [...] In 2006, China allowed 47 domestic rare-earth producers and traders and 12 Sino-foreign rare-earth producers to export. Controls have since tightened annually; by 2011, only 22 domestic rare-earth producers and traders and 9 Sino-foreign rare-earth producers were authorized. The government's <b>future</b> <b>policies</b> will likely keep in place strict controls: [...] "According to China's draft rare-earth development plan, annual rare-earth production may be limited to between 130,000 and 140,000 [...] during the period from 2009 to 2015. The export quota for rare-earth products may be about 35,000 [...] and the Government may allow 20 domestic rare-earth producers and traders to export rare earths." ...|$|E
2500|$|The Scottish {{government}} {{proposed that}} all British citizens {{who had been}} born in Scotland would automatically become Scottish citizens on the date of independence, {{regardless of whether or not}} they were then living in Scotland. British citizens [...] "habitually resident" [...] in Scotland would also be considered Scottish citizens, even if they already held the citizenship of another country. Every person who would automatically be considered a Scottish citizen would be able to opt out of Scottish citizenship provided they already held the citizenship of another country. The Scottish government also proposed that anyone with a Scottish parent or grandparent would be able to apply for registration as a Scottish citizen, and any foreign national living in Scotland legally, or who had lived in Scotland for at least 10 years at any time and had an ongoing connection to Scotland, should be able to apply for naturalisation as a Scottish citizen. UK Home Secretary Theresa May said <b>future</b> <b>policies</b> of an independent Scottish government would affect whether Scottish citizens would be allowed to retain British citizenship. An analysis paper published by the UK government in January 2014 stated that it was likely that Scots would be able to hold dual citizenship; however, the duality was considered with respect to all other countries, not specifically to the rest of the UK. The possibility of holding dual UK–Scotland citizenships could be subject to the [...] "proof of affinity".|$|E

In response to shifts in the <b>future</b> <b>policy</b> context, while policy changes can manifest as increments to status quo over time, policymakers may also need to face the possibility of making major policy shifts to enable the transition into more appropriate policy regimes. In the context of socio-technical transitions, the switch to new policy alternatives can be facilitated by incorporating new policy actions into the suite of current policy strategies early on, which can also help accommodate the long lead-times on some decisions and actions. This paper is a conceptual piece that focuses on integrating policy design thinking into the crafting of conscious policy choices and mixes to enable socio-technical transitions while considering the likely changes in the <b>future</b> <b>policy</b> context...|$|R
