Owing to poor circumstances, he had an {{elementary}} school education in which he learnt {{to read and write}} in simple English and <b>keep</b> <b>accounts.</b> After his father's death, Gan, then 16 years old, was involved in the nutmeg business on a very small scale.|$|E

The next year he was transferred to nearby York Factory, and {{over the next few years}} spent time as a clerk at Cumberland House, Saskatchewan, and South Branch House before arriving at Manchester House in 1787. During those years he learned to <b>keep</b> <b>accounts</b> and other records, calculate values of goods and furs, track supplies and other duties.|$|E
2500|$|In 1791 Lawrence {{was elected}} an {{associate}} of the Royal Academy and the following year, {{on the death of}} Sir Joshua Reynolds, King George III appointed him [...] "painter-in-ordinary to his majesty". His reputation was established, and he moved to a studio in Old Bond Street. In 1794 he became a full member of the Royal Academy. Although commissions were pouring in, Lawrence was in financial difficulties. His debts would stay with him for the rest of life: he narrowly avoided bankruptcy and had to be bailed out by wealthy sitters and friends, and died insolvent. Biographers {{have never been able to}} discover the source of his debts; he was a prodigiously hard worker (once referring in a letter to his portrait painting as [...] "mill-horse business") and didn't appear to live extravagantly. Lawrence himself said: [...] "I have never been extravagant nor profligate in the use of money. Neither gaming, horses, curricles, expensive entertainments, nor secret sources of ruin from vulgar licentiousness have swept it from me". This has generally been accepted, with biographers blaming his financial problems on his generosity towards his family and others, his inability to <b>keep</b> <b>accounts</b> (in spite of advice from his friend the painter and diarist Joseph Farington), and his magnificent but costly collection of Old Master drawings.|$|E

2500|$|Beyond union {{governance}} {{through the}} vote and elections, members have five main statutory rights. First, although statute asserts that a union is [...] "not a body corporate", in every practical sense it is: it can make contracts, commission torts, hold property, sue and be sued. The union's executives and officials carry out actions on its behalf, and their acts are attributed to it by ordinary principles of agency. However, if any union official acts ultra vires, beyond the union's powers, every member {{has a right to}} claim a remedy for the breach. For example, in Edwards v Halliwell a decision of the executive committee of the National Union of Vehicle Builders to increase membership fees was restrained, because the constitution required a two-third vote of members first. Second, TULRCA 1992 section 28 requires unions to <b>keep</b> <b>accounts,</b> giving a [...] "true and fair" [...] view of its financial affairs. Records are kept for six years, members have a right to inspect them, they are independently audited and overseen by the Certification Officer. Third, members have a right to not give contributions to the trade union's political fund, if there is one. Since the early success of the UK Labour Party in promoting working people's welfare through Parliament, both courts and Conservative governments attempted to suppress unions' political voice, particularly compared to funding by employers through control of corporations. Under TULRCA 1992 sections 72, 73 and 82, a union must hold a separate fund for any [...] "political object" [...] (such as advertising, lobbying or donations), members must approve the fund by ballot at least every 10 years, and individual members have a right to opt-out of it (unlike shareholders in companies). Unions must also have political objects in the constitution. In 2010, just 29 from 162 unions had political funds, though 57 per cent of members contributed. This generated £22m. Consolidated statistics on corporate political spending, by contrast, are not available.|$|E
