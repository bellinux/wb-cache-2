New medals were instituted: the Military Cross {{was created in}} December 1914 for warrant officers and officers up to captain, the Military Medal for enlisted men in March 1916 (although to the regret of some men, it did not carry a cash bounty like the Distinguished Conduct Medal). The Order of the British Empire (of which the MBE is one <b>grade)</b> <b>was</b> instituted in 1917.

5|$|When {{talks to}} find an American {{broadcaster}} for Thunderbirds fell through in July 1966, production for the series' second season ended with the completion of just six episodes {{at the behest of}} ITC financier Lew Grade.

5|$|After {{replacing}} drummer Niklas Lundgren with Tomas Haake in 1990, Meshuggah {{signed a}} contract with German heavy metal record label Nuclear Blast and recorded its debut full-length album, Contradictions Collapse. The LP, originally entitled (All this because of) Greed, was released in 1991. The album received positive reviews, but was not a commercial success. Soon after, Kidman decided to concentrate on vocals, and rhythm guitarist Mårten Hagström, who had already played in a band with Haake when they were in sixth <b>grade,</b> <b>was</b> recruited. The new lineup recorded the EP None at Tonteknik Recordings in Umeå in 1994 for release later that year. A Japanese version was also released, including lyrics printed in Japanese.|$|E
5|$|By {{the time}} of Catherine's ukase of 1788, just as other nations were {{entering}} the maritime fur trade, the Russians had spent over 40 years establishing and expanding their maritime operations in North America. A number of colonies were being established over a large region stretching from the Aleutian Islands to Cook Inlet and Prince William Sound. Many ships sailed from Kamchatka to Alaska each year. The Russians not only had an early start, but they also controlled the habitats {{of the most valuable}} sea otters. The Kurilian, Kamchatkan, and Aleutian sea otters' fur was thicker, glossier, and blacker than those on the Northwest Coast and California. The four grades of fur were based on color, texture, and thickness. The most prized furs were those of Kurilian and Kamchatkan sea otters, Aleutian furs were second grade, those of the Northwest Coast third, and the poorest <b>grade</b> <b>was</b> those of Californian sea otters. Russia also controlled the sources of sable furs, the most valuable fur-bearing land mammal.|$|E
5|$|In the 2008-2009 year, 1,001 {{students}} {{were enrolled in}} Dougherty.

5|$|Percy Lavon Julian {{was born}} in Montgomery, Alabama, as the first child of six born to James Sumner Julian and Elizabeth Lena Julian, née Adams. Both of his parents were {{graduates}} {{of what was to}} be Alabama State University. His father, James, whose own father had been a slave, was employed as a clerk in the Railway Service of the United States Post Office, while his mother, Elizabeth, worked as a schoolteacher. Percy Julian grew up in the time of racist Jim Crow culture and legal regime in the southern United States. Among his childhood memories was finding a lynched man hanged from a tree while walking in the woods near his home. At a time when access to an education beyond the eighth <b>grade</b> <b>was</b> extremely rare for African-Americans, Julian's parents steered all of their children toward higher education.|$|E
5|$|Modular {{system of}} architecture, eight {{standard}} grades: Although other texts preceded it, {{such as the}} 'National Building Law' of the Tang Dynasty (618–907) which was partially preserved in other texts, the Yingzao Fashi published in 1103 by the Song Dynasty (960–1279) scholar-official Li Jie (1065–1110) is the oldest known Chinese architectural treatise that has survived fully intact. It contains descriptions and illustrations detailing the cai fen system (材份制) of eight standard dimensions for module components of timber architecture and structural carpentry. The eight standard grades of module timber components in the Yingzao Fashi, with grade I being the largest and grade VIII the smallest, {{were used to determine}} the ultimate proportions and scale of a building as a whole, as all timber hall types—palaces, mansions, ordinary houses, and pavilions—were hierarchically categorized along the lines of which cai fen <b>grade</b> <b>was</b> employed. For example, palace type buildings used only grades I through V, while mansion type buildings never used components larger than grade III and no less than grade VI. In this system of structural carpentry, the smallest grade of VIII is represented by one cai; one cai is equal to the modern equivalent of 15cm (5.9in), while one cai is also divided into fifteen fen (hence the title of this modular system).|$|E

40|$|This study {{aimed to}} analyze the quality of English summative test taken by the {{students}} of MAN Boarding School Meulaboh I in terms of validity, reliability, difficulty index, discrimination index, {{and the effectiveness of}} distractors. Content analysis was employed in this study. Two techniques were carried out to collect the data, namely checklist and document analysis. The data from checklist were analyzed by using a statistical procedure in percentage form and the data from document analysis were analyzed by using Anates Software version 4. The results showed that English summative test in the context of content analysis of the first grade has sufficient validity, the second grade has poor validity, and the third grade has a very poor validity. However, in terms of construct validity the first grade and the third grade have poor construct validity, while the second grade has sufficient construct validity. Meanwhile, in terms of validity coefficient, the first grade and the third <b>grade</b> <b>is</b> 60 % and the second <b>grade</b> <b>is</b> 44 %. Secondly, English summative test of MAN Boarding School has a consistent degree of reliability. The reliability index of the first grade and the second <b>grade</b> test <b>is</b> 0. 70 and the third <b>grade</b> <b>is</b> 0. 88. Thirdly, 60 % of the test in the first grade test, 48 % of which in the second grade, and 8 % of which in the third <b>grade</b> test <b>are</b> accepted. It means that the third grade has a very poor difficulty index. Fourthly, a good discrimination index of the test in the first <b>grade</b> <b>is</b> 76 %, second <b>grade</b> <b>is</b> 56 %, and the third <b>grade</b> <b>is</b> 72 %.
