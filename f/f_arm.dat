40|$|The escape {{transition}} of a polymer "mushroom" (a flexible chain grafted to a flat non-adsorbing substrate surface {{in a good}} solvent) occurs when the polymer is compressed by a cylindrical piston of radius R, that by far exceeds the chain gyration radius. At this transition, the chain conformation abruptly changes from a two-dimensional self-avoiding walk of blobs (of diameter H, {{the height of the}} piston above the substrate) to a "flower conformation", i. e. stretched almost one-dimensional string of blobs (with end-to-end distance ≈ R) and an "escaped" part of the chain, the "crown", outside the piston. The extension of this problem to the case of star polymers with <b>f</b> <b>arms</b> is considered, assuming that the center of the star is grafted to the substrate. The question is considered whether under compression the arms escape all together, or whether there occurs an arm by arm escape under increasing compression.

The polymer linear dimensions parallel and perpendicular {{to the surface and}} the corresponding partition functions as well as the behavior of monomer density profiles and the fraction of adsorbed monomers at the surface and in the interior are studied on the basis of renormalization group field theoretical approach directly in d= 3 dimensions up to two-loop order for the semi-infinite |ϕ|^ 4 n-vector model.

40|$|The {{objective}} s of {{this research}} w ere to evaluate (1) the performance of soybean mutant lines under drought stress condition s, and (2) the genetic diversity and relationship among the mutant lines using SSR markers. The field evaluation was conducted {{during the dry season}} of 2011 and 2012 at the experimental <b>F</b> <b>arm</b> of Mataram University, West Nusa Tenggara, Indonesia. The field experiment was set up in a randomized block design. Ten mutant lines and two control varieties were evaluated in four replications. Genetic distance among evaluated lines were determined based on allelic diversity analysis using 40 s imple sequence repeat (SSR) loci. Under drought stress conditions, two mutant lines, K dl 3 and K dl 8, showed a better performance compared to the other ones. The h igh yielding mutant lines were K dl 3 and K dl 8, which yielded 1. 75 t ha - 1 and 1. 69 t ha - 1, respectively, compared to the parent and national control, Panderman 1. 43 t ha - 1 and Muria 1. 32 t ha - 1. These mutant lines required 30. 75 to 32 days to flower and 79. 75 to 83. 75 day to harvest with relatively short plant height 28. 25 and 23. 35 cm respectively. T hose mutant characters were better than those of the other three mutants, the original parents, and the control soybean species. Since the evaluated soybean mutant lines yielded more under drought stress conditions than the standard varieties, t he y can be used and registered as drought-tolerant soybean mutant s. Moreover, the evaluated soybean accessions showed a wide genetic distance. The accessions were clustered into two groups according to their genetic background, namely group I (the Panderman with three mutant lines) and group II (the Muria with two mutant lines). Twenty-three out of 40 evaluated SSR loci, including AW 31, BE 806, CMAC 7 L, S 080, S 126, S 57, S 171, S 224, S 285, S 294, S 393, S 294, S 383, S 511, S 511, S 5 20, S 5 40, S 547, S 551, S 571, S 577, and S 578, provided polymorphic alleles between the parents and their mutants and could be used to differentiate mutants from their parents.
