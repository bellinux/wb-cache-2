5000|$|Victoria has had {{an active}} abalone fishery since the late 1950s. The state is {{sectioned}} into three fishing zones, Eastern, Central and Western, with each fisher required a zone-allocated licence. Harvesting is performed by divers using surface-supplied air [...] "hookah" [...] systems operating from runabout-style, outboard-powered boats. While the diver seeks out colonies of abalone amongst the reef beds, the deckhand operates the boat, known as working [...] "live" [...] and stays above where the diver is working. Bags of abalone pried from the rocks are brought to the surface by the diver or by way of [...] "shot line", where the deckhand drops a weighted rope for the catch bag to be connected then retrieved. Divers measure each abalone before removing from the reef and the deckhand remeasures each abalone and removes excess weed growth from the shell. Since 2002, the Victorian industry has seen a significant decline in catches, with the total allowable catch reduced from 1440 to 787 tonnes for the 2011/12 <b>fishing</b> <b>year,</b> due to dwindling stocks and most notably the abalone virus ganglioneuritis, which is fast-spreading and lethal to abalone stocks.|$|E

40|$|After {{the samples}} of {{vertebral}} compositions from 1951 to 1953 were classified into two types applying the X²-method to each sample as reported formerly, {{the movements of}} sardine shoals were deduced owing to the relations between each type, by discussing them in each sea region and in each year class using the X²-comparison. On the other hand, the deduction of the movements was tried to find from the catch of each year in each sea region from 1951 to 1954, and it was compared with the above mentioned deduction. The results obtained from the X²-comparison are as follows. 1. In each year: (1) the year class of 1951 and 1952 are both intimate in "Saikai with Nankai," in "Saikai with Tokai", but not the year class of 1953 in" Saikai with Nankai", in O <b>year</b> <b>fish.</b> (2) the <b>year</b> class of 1950 and 1951 are both intimate in" Saikai with Nankai", in" Nankai with Tokai," in 1 <b>year</b> <b>fish.</b> (3) {{the movement of the}} year class of 1950 is different from that of 1951 in 2 ≤ <b>year</b> <b>fish.</b> 2. In the same year classes: (1) growing from year to 1 <b>year</b> <b>fish,</b> there are movement from Saikai to Nankai and the stay at Nankai and Tokai. (2) growing from 1 year to 2 ≤ <b>year</b> <b>fish,</b> there is movement from Nankai to Saikai. 3. The points of agreement with both methods to deduce from the X²-comparison and from the catches are as follows: (1) in the year class of 1951, the movements from Nankai to Saikai, is found between 1 and 2 ≤ <b>year</b> <b>fish.</b> (2) in the year class of 1952, the movemen t from Saikai to Nankai is noticed between O and 1 <b>year</b> <b>fish.</b> (1) O年魚は昭和 26 ・ 27 年級では西海:南海,西海:東海が近縁,昭和 28 年には西海:南海が疎縁。(2) 1 年魚は昭和 25 ・ 26 年級では西海:南海,南海:東海が近縁。(3) 2 年魚は昭和 25 年級と 26 年級とは異る。 2. 異年同年級間では,(1) 0 年魚から 1 年魚にかけては,西海から南海へ移動,東海・南海では滞留する。(2) 1 年魚から 2 年魚以上にかけては,南海から西海に移動する。 3. 漁獲尾数からの推定とx 2 比較の結果との一致点は次の様である。(1) 昭和 26 年級では, 1 年魚から 2 年以上魚にかけて南海から西海へ移動し,(2) 昭和 27 年級では, 0 年魚から 1 年魚にかけて西海から南海へ移動する...|$|R
