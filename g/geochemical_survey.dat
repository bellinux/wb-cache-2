Exmoor was created by semi-metamorphosed sedimentary lithologies, which contain a range of iron ore sources. The Romano-British iron smelting site at Sherracombe Ford was one of several production complexes to exploit these ores and excavation demonstrated evidence of iron smelting and primary iron smithing. Site investigation strategies utilised a range of techniques including <b>geochemical</b> <b>survey,</b> gradiometer survey and excavation.

40|$|ABSTRACT: A {{series of}} {{regional}} pilot <b>geochemical</b> <b>survey</b> {{projects have been}} carried out in Australia over recent years. These pilot projects targeted a number of landscape and climate settings that are challenging for geochemical mapping, and applied increasingly lower sampling densities, from c. 1 site/ 300 km 2 to c. 1 site/ 2100 km 2. Selected results are presented from pilot geochemical surveys in the Riverina, Gawler and Thomson regions, as well as results from modelling aimed at testing the robustness of ultra-low sampling densities in Australia. The salient conclusions are that: (1) geochemical surveys sampling surface and near-surface transported regolith are capable of identifying major lithologies and mineralization below the cover; and (2) a sampling strategy targeting outlet sediments of large catchments allows the application of ultra-low sampling densities in Australia. These findings overcome the main hurdles met by earlier attempts at designing a nation-wide <b>geochemical</b> <b>survey.</b> The strategy for the resulting National <b>Geochemical</b> <b>Survey</b> of Australia (NGSA) project, recently approved for funding under the Australian Government’s Onshore Energy Security Initiative, is outlined.

Within the framework of India Hydrocarbon Vision – 2025 and New Exploration Licensing Policy, there is a continuous increase in area under active exploration.

40|$|Archaeological {{science and}} archaeological field {{investigations}} are making {{greater use of}} multi-element <b>geochemical</b> <b>survey</b> {{as a tool for}} site prospection and intra-excavation analysis. This increasing use of <b>geochemical</b> <b>survey</b> is allowing a new field of geoprospection to develop, a technique that has specific relevance to the investigation of sites containing archaeometallurgical evidence, due to the high geochemical loadings within archaeological contexts produced from past metalworking activities. Correspondingly, there have been relatively few published examples that compare the results of these geochemical surveys against excavation data. This study reports the use of geochemical data to investigate a multi-period mining site-scape at Alderley Edge, Cheshire, UK. The geochemical data is analysed using Principle Components Analysis, which facilitates the identification of a number of geochemical anomalies. The site taphonomy and stratigraphic evolution of this mining site-cape is complex, with naturally occurring areas of lead and copper mineralisation’s that have been previously been mined. The geochemical anomalies were compared to the results of excavation within the survey area and this combination of excavation and prospection data allowed the reasons for the different geochemical anomalies to be explained.

40|$|Several {{studies in}} the field of archaeological {{prospection}} have suggested that multi-element soil <b>geochemical</b> <b>survey</b> holds potential as an archaeological survey method, complementing more common techniques such as magnetometry and fieldwalking. Despite this, only limited research regarding this topic has been carried out. In this study, a <b>geochemical</b> <b>survey</b> was conducted in the Eastern Suburbium of the Roman to Byzantine city of Sagalassos, with the aim of investigating the possibilities and limitations of the technique in facilitating the interpre- tation of magnetic survey data. To explore the multivariate patterns present within the chemical dataset, the data were statistically analysed using a contiguity-constrained spatial clustering algorithm. The resulting spatial clusters revealed that an area characterized by high-frequency magnetic anomalies was spatially associated with a chemical cluster rich in Cu, K, P, Pb and Zn. This is interpreted as resulting from the accumulation and decomposition of occupational debris. Enhancements of Al, As and Ba helped to interpret an area with a low magnetic signal as a region where limestone bedrock was located close to the soil surface. Finally, two zones of enhanced magnetization were shown to spatially overlap with two clusters of soils containing elevated levels of Co, Cr, Mg, Mn, Ni and (Fe) and Ti, V and (Fe), respectively, indicating the presence of two different types of mafictoultramaficophiolitic bedrock near the soil surface. This study confirms that multi-element geochemistry has potential as a survey technique, because it offers direct information on soil bedrock or ancient human disturbance, thereby adding an extra dimension to the interpretation of geophysical survey data. It is shown that soil chemical data are particularly valuable for distinguishing anthropogenic and natural impacts creating geophysical anomalies.

A major part of the remaining project will focus on using surface geochemistry to delineate prospects. A Niagaran reef field <b>geochemical</b> <b>survey,</b> the Bagley Prospect area in Otsego County, Michigan is scheduled to take place this summer. Previous wells drilled in Bagley Prospect area in the early 1970 's and in place in late 2002 and early 2003 resulted in discoveries and numerous hydrocarbon shows in the Brown Niagaran reservoir interval. The Bagley region is still considered an area of interest by the industry and appears ripe for a <b>geochemical</b> <b>survey.</b> Our industry partner is interested in a possible test in the Bagley prospect because subsurface geophysical and geological interpretation indicates the presence of structures. Anomalous production and pressure data further suggest the region is not yet well understood and should not be considered mature. The most recent well, the Bagley 1 - 22 A sidetrack, was unsuccessful at locating a new reef culmination to the south of the original vertical well and did not encounter hydrocarbon shows. The sidetrack and well were plugged and abandoned. The proposed <b>geochemical</b> <b>survey</b> will concentrate on areas away from the Bagley 1 - 22 A to the north and west but will include the entire prospect so that the existing data can be used in interpretations. Bagley appears to offer a unique combination of potential and data for a geochemical study that focuses on looking for new oil in an area that has exhausted traditional geologic and geophysical methods.

A decision to resample over that point is pending, but drilling has been postponed for the time being. The main news this reporting period is that in the Bear Lake area, northwest Michigan, Federated Oil & Gas Properties' Charlich-Fauble 2 - 9 HD horizontal lateral, has cumulative production of more than 72, 000 barrels of oil and is still producing 50 to 75 bopd from a Silurian Niagaran reef reservoir eighteen months after the well was completed.
