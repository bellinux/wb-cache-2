40|$|The paper {{provides}} an analytical formulation {{to investigate the}} thermomechanical behavior of thick composite shells subjected to a temperature distribution which varies arbitrarily in the radial direction. For illustrative purposes, shells under uniform temperature change are presented. It is found that thermal twist would occur even for symmetric laminated shells. Under uniform temperature rise, results for off-axis graphite/epoxy shells show that <b>extensional-shear</b> <b>coupling</b> can cause tensile radial stress throughout the shell and tensile hoop stress in the inner region. Laminated graphite/epoxy shells can exhibit negative effective thermal expansion coefficients in the longitudinal and transverse directions. Finally, the stacking sequence has a strong influence on the thermal stress distributions...|$|E
40|$|A {{method is}} {{presented}} to predict theoretical buckling loads of long, rectangular flat and curved laminated plates with arbitrary orientation of orthotropic axes each lamina. The plate is subjected to combined inplane normal and shear loads. Arbitrary boundary conditions may be stipulated along the longitudinal sides of the plate. In the absence of inplane shear loads and <b>extensional-shear</b> <b>coupling,</b> the analysis is also applicable to finite length plates. Numerical results are presented for curved laminated composite plates with boundary conditions and subjected to various loadings. These results indicate some of the complexities involved in the numerical solution of the analysis for general laminates. The results also show that the reduced bending stiffness approximation when applied to buckling problems could lead to considerable error in some cases and therefore must be used with caution...|$|E
