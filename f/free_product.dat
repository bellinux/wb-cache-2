5|$|With {{the release}} of Windows 95 in August 1995, Delrina was now {{competing}} directly against Microsoft in the fax/electronic communications marketplace, as Windows 95 included a basic faxing application as an accessory, along with a licensed version of Hilgraeve's HyperTerminal communication package, (which was also {{used as the basis}} for Delrina's own WinComm program). While these applications offered only rudimentary fax and online communication services in comparison to the mature Delrina products, Microsoft was perceived as a potentially serious future competitor in the communications market space. The release of the initial version of Microsoft's Internet Explorer in late 1995 as a <b>free</b> <b>product</b> effectively killed off the early emerging market for non-free browsers, creating a market where Delrina's Cyberjack browser could not hope to compete.|$|E

25|$|Mathematically, Bass–Serre theory {{builds on}} {{exploiting}} and generalizing {{the properties of}} two older group-theoretic constructions: <b>free</b> <b>product</b> with amalgamation and HNN extension. However, unlike the traditional algebraic study of these two constructions, Bass–Serre theory uses the geometric language of covering theory and fundamental groups. Graphs of groups, which are the basic objects of Bass–Serre theory, {{can be viewed as}} one-dimensional versions of orbifolds.|$|E
25|$|Bass–Serre {{theory is}} a part of the {{mathematical}} subject of group theory that deals with analyzing the algebraic structure of groups acting by automorphisms on simplicial trees. The theory relates group actions on trees with decomposing groups as iterated applications of the operations of <b>free</b> <b>product</b> with amalgamation and HNN extension, via the notion of the fundamental group of a graph of groups. Bass–Serre theory can be regarded as one-dimensional version of the orbifold theory.|$|E

The link group of the n-component unlink is the free group on n generators, F'n, as the link group of a single link is the knot group of the unknot, which is the integers, and the link group of an unlinked union is the <b>free</b> <b>product</b> of the link groups of the components.|$|E
