40|$|Abstract: The paper {{deals with}} a {{numerical}} study of complex 3 D unsteady flow in the impeller and spiral casing of the <b>forward</b> <b>curved</b> <b>blade</b> of the centrifugal stage. Aerodynamic characteristics of eight different geometrical configurations of the impeller for squirrel cage and high pressure centrifugal fans are investigated. The CFD codes ANSYS 13 and OpenFoam are applied. In this study impact of the blade geometry to compressor characteristic is investigated and possibilities of efficiency, pressure coefficient and working range increasing of centrifugal fan are presented...|$|E
40|$|A {{sirocco fan}} is a {{centrifugal}} fan with a <b>forward</b> <b>curved</b> <b>blade.</b> It {{is used for}} low pressure but has a large discharge use. In this paper, at first, nine impellers with various blade shapes were tested in the same casing. The measurements of the three-dimensional time variant velocity at the outlet of the impeller were done using four impellers having better performances among them. The relations between fan performance and outlet velocity were considered. The effects of the blade shape on the performance were considered. The blade inlet and outlet angles and blade inclination angles which have the best performance were considered. The design parameters of designing a sirocco fan impeller was described...|$|E
50|$|The {{cross-flow}} or tangential fan, sometimes {{known as}} a tubular fan, was patented in 1893 by Paul Mortier, and is used extensively in the HVAC industry. The fan is usually long {{in relation to the}} diameter, so the flow approximately remains two-dimensional away from the ends. The CFF uses an impeller with <b>forward</b> <b>curved</b> <b>blades,</b> placed in a housing consisting of a rear wall and vortex wall. Unlike radial machines, the main flow moves transversely across the impeller, passing the blading twice.|$|R
40|$|In this study, 2 D {{simulations}} {{were performed}} on the airflow in {{a new type of}} heat exchanger, the so-called Fine Wire Heat Exchanger. The heat exchanger consists of a centrifugal fan with <b>forward</b> <b>curved</b> <b>blades</b> and a circular set of slighly curved wire-cloths that are surrounding the fan. The project was issued by Fiwihex Technology, which is developing this heat exchanger and is interested in understanding the basic phenomena behind the heat transfer. The 2 D simulations on airflow through the fan are validated against experimental results from literature. The fan simulations depend on the distance between the pressure-inlet boundary and the pressure-outlet boundary and show a flow field somewhat different from that found in experiments. Increasing the performance of the fan could be realized by slightly t i l t ing the fan blades by some 20 degrees. Two models were set up to correlate the heat transfer in the wire-cloth with the air-speed. The 2 D simulations and the heat transfer models were validated with experimental results. The models provide a basis in understand-ing the experimental observations, such as the high heat transfer in combination with a description of the wire-cloth as a plate. ...|$|R
40|$|<b>Forward</b> and {{backward}} <b>curved</b> <b>blade</b> centrifugal fans as noise sources {{were subjected to}} an analysis employing the matched acoustic waveguide measuring technique. There are three major findings: 1. The noise output from homologous series of fans can be defined by one V - shaped specific noise power vs. log specific curve, with minimum close to maximum static efficiency. Fan noise "laws" differ as {{the slope of the}} branches of this curve. 2. Fan outlet noise power at maximum fan efficiency approximates 10 ^- 5 times the input fan power...|$|R
40|$|Present work {{compares the}} mass {{transfer}} coefficient (kLa) and power draw capability of stirred tank employed with Rushton and <b>curved</b> <b>blade</b> impeller using {{computational fluid dynamics}} (CFD) techniques in single and double impeller cases. Comparative analysis for different boundary conditions and mass transfer model {{has been done to}} assess their suitability. The predicted local kLa has been found higher in <b>curved</b> <b>blade</b> impeller than the Rushton impeller, whereas stirred tank with double impeller does not show variation due to low superficial gas velocity. The global kLa predicted has been found higher in <b>curved</b> <b>blade</b> impeller than the Rushton impeller in double and single cases. <b>Curved</b> <b>blade</b> impeller also exhibits higher power draw capability than the Rushton impeller. Overall, stirred tank with <b>curved</b> <b>blade</b> impeller gives higher efficiency in both single and double cases than the Rushton turbin...|$|R
50|$|Though <b>curved</b> <b>blades</b> are {{as old as}} {{the sword}} itself, they did not become {{widespread}} in Asia and the Middle East until after the dominance of the Mongol Empire.
