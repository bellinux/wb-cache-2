5|$|Three {{camera angles}} were used during Lorne's {{scene in the}} F-302. To save costs, one of the camera angles was {{operated}} by Kavan Smith himself, who held it on his lap. Elsewhere, the producers {{wanted to make the}} control chair rotate as Sheppard flies the city to make it <b>different</b> <b>than</b> <b>any</b> <b>other</b> actions involving the control chair. A stunt {{towards the end of the}} episode was used where Weir gets thrown after the beam grazes the tower. The stunt was not originally approved by the producers. A stuntwoman doubled Higginson as Weir during the sequence. The scene was rehearsed several times before filming the actual sequence. During the actual sequence, the stuntwoman wore a plastic mask to prevent the flying glass from injuring her face.|$|E
25|$|On {{the other}} hand, the spoken {{language}} suffered {{none of the}} constraints that applied to the written language and Brazilian Portuguese sounds very <b>different</b> <b>than</b> <b>any</b> <b>other</b> derivative of Portuguese. Brazilians, when concerned with pronunciation, look up to what is considered the national standard variety, and never the European one, specially {{after a lot of}} tension between Portugal and the settlers (immigrants) in Brazil since the country's de-facto settlement, as immigrants were forbidden of speaking freely on their native languages in Brazil by fear of severe punishment by the Portuguese law enforcers. Lately, Brazilians in general have had some exposure to European speech, through TV and music. Often one will see Brazilian actors working in Portugal, and Portuguese actors working in Brazil, despite the differences on spoken language.|$|E
25|$|Yet {{there are}} Dhakis like Dhaki Gokul Chandra Das,of Maslondopur and Ashutosh Colony Habra, North 24 parganas,believs that the Dhak {{is similar to}} any other {{percussion}} instrument played in a concert or a stage performance, such as the Tabla,Pakhwaj,or Mridangam. If a Tabalchi can show case his talent on stage {{in front of a}} large audience, so can a Dhaki....He believes that the dhak can be played in accompaniment to any kind of music,including songs (Rabindra Sangeet), similar to the Tabla,and not just for the Durga Puja or any other puja; and he has proved it. He now participates in stage performances with Pandit Tanmoy Bose and his group of talented musicians. Recently he also performed in a reality TV show,(Sa re Ga Ma Pa,) on Z Bangla, in accompaniment to songs.So it is hard time the Dhakis learnt to use their inheritant music in other ways, to make a living {{and at the same time}} to keep the art of playing the Dhak alive and enchant the world with their magical rhythms at times other than the Durga Puja. People need to recognise the Dhak as a percussion instrument no <b>different</b> <b>than</b> <b>any</b> <b>other</b> percussion instrument that can be seen on stage.|$|E

Gastaldi felt the script was no <b>different</b> <b>than</b> <b>any</b> <b>others</b> he had worked on, with the only new element being vampires. Gastaldi commented that since Dracula starring Christopher Lee {{had been such a}} big hit in Italy, producers and distributors were eager to make their own vampire films.|$|R

The spiders were {{designed}} by Castuera and Moynihan to purposely look <b>different</b> <b>than</b> <b>any</b> <b>other</b> type of cartoon spider. Castuera later said that their designs reminded her of [...] "stuff I find at thrift stores". Two of the bugs that are trapped on the spider web with Finn and Jake are voiced by series storyboard artist Cole Sanchez and voice actor Tom Kenny. There was a minor controversy with the studio {{in regards to the}} sound of Barb's silk-spinner. Originally, it was planned for there to be a [...] "gooier, fartier [...] sound", but this was later cut and replaced with a more tame sound effect.|$|E
500|$|Peter Hunt, who {{had worked}} on the five {{preceding}} films had impressed Broccoli and Saltzman enough to earn his directorial debut as they believed his quick cutting had set the style for the series; {{it was also the}} result of a long-standing promise from Broccoli and Saltzman for a directorial position. Hunt also asked for the position during the production of Chitty Chitty Bang Bang, and he brought along with him many crew members, including cinematographer Michael Reed. Hunt was focused on putting his mark – [...] "I wanted it to be <b>different</b> <b>than</b> <b>any</b> <b>other</b> Bond film would be. It was my film, not anyone else's." [...] On Her Majesty's Secret Service was the last film on which Hunt worked in the series.|$|E

"Blood Ties" [...] {{featured}} the first appearances of Peter Gerety, Jon Seda and Callie Thorne as regular cast members on [...] Thorne portrayed Laura Ballard, a former Seattle homicide unit detective, marking the character's {{first appearance in}} the series. Gerety and Seda each previously played their respective characters in guest appearances on the show; Seda's character Paul Falsone {{first appeared in the}} two-part [...] finale. Stuart Gharty, Gerety's character, is described as a transplant from the department's internal affairs department. Executive producer Tom Fontana said he thought the new cast additions would create drama and tension between the characters: [...] "It's stimulating to add new people, because you're not feeling like you're writing or acting the same scene for the thousandth time, and I think all three of them are very <b>different</b> <b>than</b> <b>any</b> <b>other</b> characters we've had on the show." ...|$|E

500|$|Chen {{felt that}} the reason that Cloud had been so warmly {{received}} was because the emotions it sparked in players were <b>different</b> <b>than</b> <b>any</b> <b>other</b> game available at the time, and {{believed that it was}} his [...] "calling" [...] to make more games that changed what people saw video games as. Chen went on to do his master's thesis the following year in the concept of dynamic difficulty adjustment, where the game adjusts how it reacts to the player based on the past and present actions of that player. Chen illustrated his ideas with Flow, a Flash game made with Nicholas Clark. The game involves the player guiding an aquatic microorganism through various depths of the ocean, consuming other organisms and evolving in the process. It was released in March 2006; it received 100,000 downloads in its first two weeks and by July had been downloaded over 650,000 times. A PlayStation 3 version was announced in May 2006 as a downloadable game via the PlayStation Store, and was released in February 2007. A version for the PlayStation Portable, developed by SuperVillain Studios, was released in March 2008. Flow became the most downloaded game on the PlayStation Network in 2007, and won Best Downloadable Game at the Game Developers Choice Awards.|$|E

2500|$|With {{the advent}} of shaped projectiles, such as the First Strike, and the {{resulting}} development of magazine fed markers, a considerable increase in range, accuracy and MILSIM realism was gained. [...] Functionally speaking, magazine-fed markers are no <b>different</b> <b>than</b> <b>any</b> <b>other</b> paintball marker, with one exception. [...] Instead of paintballs being gravity fed from a bulky hopper, which sits above the marker, shaped projectiles (or paintballs) are fed from a spring-loaded magazine {{from the bottom of}} the marker. [...] The caliber of both the gravity fed and magazine fed markers are the same (.68 caliber) and the velocities are also generally the same. [...] The increased range and accuracy of the shaped projectile comes from the higher ballistic coefficient that the shaped projectile has, and the gyroscopic spin imparted onto the projectile from a rifled barrel and fins on the projectile itself. [...] Magazine fed markers and shaped projectiles have allowed marker designs to more closely approximate the styling and functionality of actual (real steel) firearms, which intern has given paintball a better avenue to compete with Airsoft in the MilSiM environment.|$|E
2500|$|Vallejos {{herself was}} again unable to attend court. Her counsel Gladys Li responded to Pannick's {{arguments}} {{by stating that}} Vietnamese refugees were not given identity cards and had to live in government-specified refugee centres; she thus argued that Vietnamese refugees did not fall within the definition of [...] "ordinarily resident". She also argued that the case of Vietnamese refugees was of no value as a precedent, since unlike before 1997 when the colonial government was free to make any immigration laws without limitation, the Hong Kong government today is bound by the Basic Law. Li contrasted the treatment of Vietnamese refugees with that of FDHs: while FDHs' work contracts limited their place of residence, they were issued with identity cards, could have ordinary social lives outside of work. She described their position as comparable to foreign civil servants. She also argued that the standard FDH contract's requirement that an FDH return {{to his or her}} country of origin every two years did not affect Vallejos' ordinary residence in Hong Kong, because she was offered a renewal of contract prior to departure each time, and her departure from Hong Kong was little <b>different</b> <b>than</b> <b>any</b> <b>other</b> category of employee required by his or her employer to take a compulsory leave. However, Justice Stock did not seem convinced by this argument, stating that Vallejos' absence from Hong Kong was [...] "enforced", while Justice Tang pointed out that Vallejos could not return to Hong Kong as she wished during such absences, further bringing into doubt the idea that she could be considered [...] "ordinarily resident" [...] during such absences.|$|E
