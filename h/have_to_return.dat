Her original complement of aircraft consisted of a Short Folder, two Wight Pushers, three Sopwith Type 807 seaplanes and two to four Sopwith Tabloid wheeled aircraft.|$|E
5|$|In {{the weeks}} leading up to the Independence Bowl, the game {{received}} as much or more coverage than the incipient national championship game due to the controversial status of Tech star Bruce Smith, who was embroiled in a legal battle with the NCAA about his participation in the game. Spread bettors favored Air Force to win the game by four points. Ticket sales were slow in the {{weeks leading up}} to the bowl, and Virginia Tech was faulted for failing to sell its entire allotment of 12,000 tickets. Tech representatives said they might <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>return</b> as many as 8,000 tickets due to the difficulty of selling tickets for a game more than 20 hours away by car.|$|E

5|$|On November 17, 2008, Aliferi {{returned}} {{yet again}} to the Old Bridge Township Council. The council this time gave the go-ahead for construction {{to begin with a}} condition. The council set that if Aliferi wants to construct it, he has to include commercial development before constructing residential homes to minimize community impact. Also before construction would begin, Aliferi would also <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>return</b> for a new General Development Permit (GDP). The proposal for the hotel that Aliferi brought up, was held off due to the location, which was on depressed elevation. There was no official decision for a new train station, which was proposed several times during Aliferi's plans.|$|E
5|$|The initial {{reaction}} of Branham's followers {{to his death}} was one of shocking disbelief. In the confusion immediately following his death, expectations developed that he would rise from the dead. His funeral was held on December 29, 1965, but his burial was delayed indefinitely. The press surmised {{that this was a}} result of Branham's expected resurrection. He was finally buried on April 11, 1966, the day after Easter Sunday, which was accepted reluctantly by his followers. Most believed that he would <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>return</b> to fulfill a vision that he had regarding future tent meetings.|$|E

5|$|At about eleven o'clock, Cox began urging Ashford to leave. When the two did leave, it {{was with}} Thornton, who {{accompanied}} Ashford closely, while Cox walked behind them. Instead of returning to Erdington, Ashford announced that {{she would go to}} her grandfather's house, stating that it was closer to work. This was true, but ignored the fact that she would <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>return</b> to Erdington to obtain her working clothes in the morning. Cox journeyed to Erdington, while Ashford and Thornton went off together. At about a quarter to three, a labourer saw Thornton leaving a friend's house with a woman, and greeted Thornton, but the woman (undoubtedly Ashford) held her bonnet over her face. Just before 4a.m., Cox was awakened by Ashford, seeking her working clothes. Ashford changed and hurried off, stating that she needed to be home before her uncle left for market. A returning reveller from Tyburn House saw her walking quickly. He was the last person known to see her alive.|$|E
5|$|Cooke {{resolved}} to kill Sharp herself. The next time Sharp was in Bowling Green on business, she {{sent a letter}} to him that denounced Beauchamp's actions and claimed she had broken off all contact with him. She asked Sharp to visit her at her plantation before he left town. Sharp questioned the messenger who delivered the letter, as he suspected a trap. He replied to her, saying he would visit at the time appointed. Beauchamp and Cooke awaited the visit, but Sharp never arrived. When Beauchamp rode to Bowling Green to investigate, he learned that Sharp had left for Frankfort two days earlier, leaving substantial unfinished business. Beauchamp concluded that Sharp would eventually <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>return</b> to Bowling Green to finish his business there. Determined to await Sharp's return, Beauchamp opened a legal practice in the city. Throughout 1822 and 1823, Beauchamp practiced law and waited for Sharp to return. He never did.|$|E
5|$|Giovanni Verga's 1871 novel Storia di una capinera, {{according}} to its author, {{was inspired by a}} story of a blackcap trapped and caged by children. The bird, silent and pining for its lost freedom, eventually dies. In the book, a nun evacuated from her convent by cholera {{falls in love with a}} family friend, only to <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>return</b> to her confinement when the disease wanes. The novel was adapted as films of the same name in 1917, 1943 and 1993. The last version was directed by Franco Zeffirelli, and its English-language version was retitled as Sparrow. In Saint François d'Assise, an opera by Messiaen, the orchestration is based on bird song. St Francis himself is represented by the blackcap.|$|E

5|$|However, SERN learns of {{the time}} machine and sends a group to {{retrieve}} it, killing Mayuri in the process. Using Kurisu's time leap machine, Rintarō travels back in time numerous times {{to try to save}} Mayuri, but to no avail. As Rintarō reaches wit's end, he is approached by Suzuha Amane, a girl from a future ruled by SERN due to their possession of a time machine, who tells him that he needs to return to a Beta world line in which Mayuri won't die. By undoing the effects of the D-Mails that caused shifts in the time line, Rintarō regains possession of an IBN 5100 PC that they lost earlier, allowing them to crack into SERN's systems and delete the evidence of Rintarō's original D-Mail. However, Rintarō realizes that by doing so, he would <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>return</b> to a world line in which Kurisu is dead. After realizing their feelings for each other, Kurisu tells Rintarō to save Mayuri. Reluctantly, Rintarō agrees and deletes the evidence of his D-Mail from SERN's database, returning him to the Beta world line.|$|E

They also said they would not let him go to the United States unless the Houston Rockets would take him first overall. After assurances from Team Yao that the Rockets would draft Yao with their number one pick, the CBA gave permission {{on the morning of the}} draft for Yao to play in the U.S. When the Rockets selected Yao with the first pick of the draft, he became the first international player ever to be selected first overall without having previously played U.S. college basketball.|$|E

25|$|Transport to {{the island}} is {{provided}} by C-130 Hercules military transport planes operated by the Royal Norwegian Air Force that land at Jan Mayensfield's gravel runway. The planes fly in from Bodø Main Air Station eight times a year. Since the airport {{does not have any}} instrument landing capabilities, good visibility is required, and {{it is not uncommon for}} the planes to <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>return</b> to Bodø, two hours away, without landing. For heavy goods, freight ships visit during the summer, but since there are no harbours, the ships must anchor.|$|E

This resulted in Australia and Sri Lanka having to play out three unnecessary overs in near darkness since they had been told they would otherwise <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>return</b> and play out the overs on the following day. In the aftermath Crowe apologised on behalf of the playing control team.|$|E
25|$|Algirdas Brazauskas {{proposed}} Bronislovas Lubys, {{the managing}} director of “Azotas” (later Achema), as the Prime Minister of the fifth government. His candidacy {{was approved by the}} parliament with 87 votes in favor. It was understood that the government was to be short-lived, as it would <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>return</b> its mandate after the presidential elections early in 1993. The government included only three members of LDDP, while nine ministers retained their positions from the previous Sąjūdis-led government. In late 1992 and early 1993 the Seimas adopted the laws implementing the position of the President of Lithuania and governing the elections.|$|E

The spring of 1192 saw continued negotiations and further skirmishing between the opposing forces.
