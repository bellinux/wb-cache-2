500|$|Multiple reactor sensors at the North Anna Nuclear Generating Station, located [...] {{northeast}} of the epicenter, detected a slight power reduction {{as a result of}} vibrations in the reactor or monitoring devices. This caused the two nuclear reactors to shut down automatically seconds before off-site power was lost. The Nuclear Regulatory Commission sent additional inspectors to the Virginia plant after preliminary measurements suggested that the <b>ground</b> <b>shook</b> more than the two reactors were designed to handle. The damage was minimal and the NRC advised that further inspections should not be interpreted to mean that the plant was not safe. After a $21 million inspection, engineers stated that they only found cosmetic damage. On November 11, 2011, the NRC gave its approval for restarting the reactors.|$|E

As the <b>ground</b> <b>shook</b> and a high-pitched roar issued from the well, the mud {{was followed by a}} great, dirty plume of oil and gas that splattered the snow-covered ground. Drillers pumped several tons of drilling mud down the hole, and after thirty-eight hours the wild flow was sealed off, but not for long. Some [...] below the surface, the drill pipe had broken off, and through this break the pressure of the reservoir forced oil and gas into shallower formations.

40|$|Earthquake Alarms Systems, ElarmS, is a {{methodology}} for providing warning of forthcoming <b>ground</b> <b>shaking</b> during earthquakes. The approach uses {{a network of}} seismic instruments to detect the first-arriving energy at the surface, the P-waves, and translate {{the information contained in}} these low amplitude waves into a prediction of the peak <b>ground</b> <b>shaking</b> that follows. The instruments closest to the epicenter are the first to detect the seismic energy, and by using a seismic network this information can be integrated to produce a map of future <b>ground</b> <b>shaking</b> everywhere. The ElarmS methodology uses the frequency content of the P-wave arrival to estimate earthquake magnitude, arrival times to determine location, and then predicts the <b>ground</b> <b>shaking</b> using a radial attenuation relation. All data is gathered continuously and the hazard map updated every second. As observations of peak <b>ground</b> <b>shaking</b> are also made close to the epicenter they are integrated into the hazard assessment. Here, th...|$|R

30|$|In {{order to}} assess the equivalent-linear model for seismic wave propagation, a {{comparison}} between the actual and computed <b>ground</b> <b>shaking</b> of a nearby measuring station is conducted. A complete analysis involving backward propagation of shear waves to obtain the bedrock acceleration at a measuring station site is carried out, and thereafter a forward propagation is calculated to obtain the computed <b>ground</b> <b>shaking</b> at another measuring station site based on the latter’s soil profile. Under ideal situations, the computed <b>ground</b> <b>shaking</b> should be identical to the actual recorded shaking at the latter’s station. But as the equivalent-linear method is a simplified approach, some differences are expected.|$|R

30|$|Earthquakes cause <b>ground</b> <b>shaking</b> and static crustal deformation, {{which has}} led to the theory that these events cause earthquake-related {{groundwater}} changes. According to the poroelastic theory (Biot, 1941; Roeloffs, 1996), stress, strain, pore pressure, and water content are related to each other. Based on these relationships, Montgomery and Manga (2003) pointed out that there are two main causes of earthquake-related groundwater changes: static volumetric strain change and <b>ground</b> <b>shaking,</b> with the latter including dynamic volumetric strain change.|$|R

From this a map showing areas of likely damage can be prepared within minutes of an actual earthquake.|$|R

5000|$|A seismic {{scale is}} used to {{describe}} the strength or [...] "size" [...] of an earthquake.

The intensity and nature of <b>ground</b> <b>shaking</b> depends on the local geology; at a given locality the intensity of shaking depends on the magnitude and distance of the seismic event.|$|R

In the din of the struggle none heard or heeded their cries, each man was occupied solely with the thought of flight or slaughter. Some half-dozen of the fugitives, seeing the two men were making their way across the swamp, had followed in their footsteps.|$|E

There he was--perhaps the very specimen which the American artist had encountered. The <b>ground</b> <b>shook</b> beneath his tremendous weight, and his gulpings of water resounded through the still night.

At one end the cascade had scooped out a small basin and the deer's hind quarters were in the pool. Jimmy seized its fore legs, and bracing his feet against a stone, began to pull. He pulled hard, but although he felt he moved, the deer did not. Then his foot went down, and letting go the animal, he threw himself back.|$|E
30|$|There {{have been}} ideas to {{forecast}} strong <b>ground</b> <b>shaking</b> {{at a site}} from an earthquake that occurs at a distance. The system would rely on signals from an earthquake detected at a nearby site, and transmit an alarm to affected areas at a further distance before strong <b>ground</b> <b>shaking</b> arrives. This kind of idea for front alarming already existed in the nineteenth century, and was presented by J. D. Cooper in San Francisco in 1868. However, the idea could not be implemented due to technical limitations at that time (Nakamura and Tucker 1988). Late in the twentieth century, dedicated on-site real-time monitoring systems were developed for specific facilities to detect an event and take necessary actions before strong shaking arrives. Research and development into how to forecast strong <b>ground</b> <b>shaking</b> at a given site has been carried out, independent of the big network installation and prediction research in Japan.|$|R
40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{the case for}} the significant elongation of the period of vibration of reinforced concrete (RC) buildings during strong <b>ground</b> <b>shaking</b> due to earthquakes. This viewpoint is substantiated by the results of experimental tests on RC structures and the strong ground-motion measurements obtained from damaged RC buildings during earthquakes, wherein a large increase in the period of vibration is observed during <b>ground</b> <b>shaking.</b> The increase in the fundamental period is obviously dependent on the level of shaking and the associated extent of non-linearity that is attained within the structure and/or foundation; this behaviour has been more frequently observed in experimental tests than in the field {{due to the lack of}} instrumented buildings that have been subject to large strong <b>ground</b> <b>shaking.</b> Analytical models which replicate the results of the experimental tests are introduced and additional studies on the elongation of the period during seismic action are presented...|$|R
50|$|The primary hazard or {{danger that}} can be brought by an {{earthquake}} {{is the effect of}} <b>ground</b> <b>shaking.</b> Buildings or properties can be damaged by the shaking itself or by the ground beneath them settling to a different level than it was before the earthquake. Santa Maria is fortunate to be free from fault lines. The nearest fault line is found at San Jose del Monte City which is just 17 kilometers away from its city proper. However, <b>ground</b> <b>shaking</b> can still be experienced by the town which can pose hazard to properties. Using the Rapid Earthquake Damage Assessment System (REDAS), the planning team was able to simulate the effect of <b>ground</b> <b>shaking</b> at Santa Maria if the nearest fault line located at San Jose del Monte City would move at magnitude 7 and 5 meter depth earthquake. The side effect is estimated to incur slight damage.|$|R
60|$|And now {{a perfect}} tornado burst upon me. The <b>ground</b> <b>shook</b> as though {{thousands}} of horses thundered across it; {{and this time}} the storm bore on its icy wings, not snow, but great hailstones which drove with such violence that they might have come from the thongs of Balearic slingers--hailstones that beat down leaf and branch and made the shelter of the cypresses of no more avail than though their stems were standing-corn. At the first I had rushed to the nearest tree; but I was soon fain to leave it and seek the only spot that seemed to afford refuge, the deep Doric doorway of the marble tomb. There, crouching against the massive bronze door, I gained a certain amount of protection from the beating of the hailstones, for now they only drove against me as they ricocheted from the ground and the side of the marble.|$|E

At first we expected that Sorais was going to attack us at once, as the clouds of cavalry which hung upon her flanks executed some threatening demonstrations, but she thought better of it, {{and there was no}} fight that day. As for the formation of her great forces I cannot now describe it with accuracy, and it would only serve to bewilder if I did, but I may say, generally, that in its leading features it resembled our own, only her reserve was much greater.|$|E
60|$|At last, {{their feet}} sore with poison-needles, which {{sometimes}} pierced clean through their thick skins, their eyes aching with the darkness, the three travellers, {{on the eighth}} day, broke out of the dense forest into broad daylight and shining snow again. Down and down they descended into a frozen swampy valley. And about noon, half hidden in the fume and steam of their own breath, they saw a great herd or muster of Ephelantoes feeding. They stood in a line beyond Nod's counting--big, middling-sized, and little--tearing down the rime-laden branches of the trees, whose leaves and fruits they first warmed with their bellows-breath before stuffing them into their mouths.
