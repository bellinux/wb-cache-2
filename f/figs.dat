5|$|<b>Figs</b> {{flower and}} fruit asynchronously. Flowering and fruiting is {{staggered}} throughout the population. This fact {{is important for}} fig wasps—female wasps {{need to find a}} syconium in which to lay their eggs within a few days of emergence, something that would not be possible if all the trees in a population flowered and fruited at the same time. This also makes <b>figs</b> important food resources for frugivores (animals that feed nearly exclusively on fruit); <b>figs</b> {{are one of the few}} fruit available at times of the year when fruit are scarce.|$|E
5|$|<b>Figs</b> have an obligate {{mutualism}} with fig wasps, (Agaonidae); <b>figs</b> {{are only}} pollinated by fig wasps, and fig wasps can only reproduce in fig flowers. Generally, each fig species {{depends on a}} single species of wasp for pollination. The wasps are similarly dependent on their fig species in order to reproduce. Ficus aurea is pollinated by Pegoscapus mexicanus (Ashmead).|$|E
5|$|<b>Figs</b> have {{complicated}} inflorescences called syconia. Flowers {{are entirely}} contained within an enclosed structure. Their only {{connection with the}} outside is through a small pore called ostiole. Monoecious <b>figs</b> like F. aurea have {{both male and female}} flowers within the syconium. Female flowers mature first. Once mature, they produce a volatile chemical attractant. Female wasps squeeze their way through the ostiole into the interior of the syconium. Inside the syconium, they pollinate the flowers, lay their eggs in some of them, and die. The eggs hatch and the larvae parasitise the flowers in which they were laid. After four to seven weeks (in F. aurea), adult wasps emerge. Males emerge first, mate with the females, and cut exit holes through the walls of the fig. The male flowers mature around {{the same time as the}} female wasps emerge. The newly emerged female wasps actively pack their bodies with pollen from the male flowers before leaving through the exit holes the males have cut and fly off to find a syconium in which to lay their eggs. Over the next one to five days, <b>figs</b> ripen. The ripe <b>figs</b> are eaten by various mammals and birds which disperse the seeds.|$|E

5|$|The {{interaction}} between <b>figs</b> and fig wasps is especially well-known (see section on reproduction, above).

5|$|Although <b>figs</b> flower asynchronously as a population, in {{most species}} {{flowering}} is synchronised within an individual. Newly emerged female wasps must {{move away from}} their natal tree {{in order to find}} <b>figs</b> in which to lay their eggs. This is to the advantage of the fig, since it prevents self-pollination. In Florida, individual F. aurea trees flower and fruit asynchronously. Within-tree asynchrony in flowering is likely to raise the probability of self-pollination, but it may be an adaptation that allows the species to maintain an adequate population of wasps at low population densities or in strongly seasonal climates.|$|E

5|$|Flowering {{phenology}} in Ficus {{has been}} characterised into five phases. In most <b>figs,</b> phase A is followed almost immediately by phase B. However, in F. aurea immature inflorescences can remain dormant {{for more than}} nine months.|$|E
5|$|The Agaonidae (fig wasps) are {{the only}} pollinators of nearly 1000 species of <b>figs,</b> and thus are crucial to the {{survival}} of their host plants. Since the wasps are equally dependent on their fig trees for survival, the coevolved relationship is fully mutualistic.|$|E
5|$|Theophrastus {{writes that}} plants can grow spontaneously, from seed, or from {{vegetative}} {{parts of the}} plant. Plants with bulbs grow from those. Soil and climate influence growth. Some plants change into others unless care is taken, so bergamot turns into mint, and wheat turns into darnel. He reports that if celery is trodden after sowing, it will become curly, and that <b>figs</b> are the easiest trees to propagate, whereas date palms have to be grown from several seeds together, and they like irrigation, dung, salt (at the age of one year) and being transplanted. Other kinds of palm have different habits and fruits. He notes that gall insects come out of wild <b>figs</b> and make the cultivated <b>figs</b> swell, which helps to prevent premature shedding of the fruit. The male spathe of the date palm is cut off and brought to the female, and its dust is shaken over the female tree to make it fruit.|$|E
