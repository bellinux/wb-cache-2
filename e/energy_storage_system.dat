500|$|Just to the north, the Rockaway Line gains {{two extra}} non-revenue tracks {{straddling}} the two revenue tracks. The western track {{is a test}} track, installed in 2001 and called the Far Rockaway Test Track, while the eastern track is used to relay shuttle trains. The western track extends around [...] or nearly 2 miles, while the eastern track is long enough for one full-length train (...) and ends at a bumper block. The test track was installed in 2001 by New York City Transit's Maintenance of Way Department to ensure that new cars have undergone necessary acceleration and braking tests before being put into revenue service.

2500|$|It is also {{important}} to take losses due to fuel production, transportation, and storage into account. Fuel cell vehicles running on compressed hydrogen may have a power-plant-to-wheel efficiency of 22% if the hydrogen is stored as high-pressure gas, and 17% if it is stored as liquid hydrogen. Fuel cells cannot store energy like a battery, except as hydrogen, but in some applications, such as stand-alone power plants based on discontinuous sources such as solar or wind power, they are combined with electrolyzers and storage systems to form an <b>energy</b> <b>storage</b> <b>system.</b> Most hydrogen, however, is produced by steam methane reforming, and so most hydrogen production emits carbon dioxide. The overall efficiency (electricity to hydrogen and back to electricity) of such plants (known as round-trip efficiency), using pure hydrogen and pure oxygen can be [...] "from 35 up to 50 percent", depending on gas density and other conditions. While a much cheaper lead–acid battery might return about 90%, the electrolyzer/fuel cell system can store indefinite quantities of hydrogen, and is therefore better suited for long-term storage.|$|E
2500|$|The SEGS is a {{collection}} of nine plants with a total capacity of 354MW and has been the world's largest solar power plant, both thermal and non-thermal, for many years. A newer plant is Nevada Solar One plant with a capacity of 64MW. The 150 MW Andasol solar power stations are in Spain with each site having a capacity of 50MW. Note however, that those plants have heat storage which requires a larger field of solar collectors relative {{to the size of the}} steam turbine-generator to store heat and send heat to the steam turbine at the same time. [...] Heat storage enables better utilization of the steam turbine. [...] With day and some nighttime operation of the steam-turbine Andasol 1 at 50MW peak capacity produces more energy than Nevada Solar One at 64MW peak capacity, due to the former plant's thermal <b>energy</b> <b>storage</b> <b>system</b> and larger solar field.

The potential applications of grid-integrated <b>energy</b> <b>storage</b> <b>systems</b> cover the entire electric power delivery supply chain, from generation to end-use, and potential benefits range from improved frequency regulation and dynamic stability to superior utilization of renewable and distributed energy resources. This thesis investigates the optimal planning and operation of <b>energy</b> <b>storage</b> <b>systems</b> in the power distribution system from the consumer’s perspective.
