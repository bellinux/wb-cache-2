5|$|During the English Civil War, the Royal Fort was {{considered}} the strongest part of Bristol's defences, and <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> fort that the Royalists retreated when they found themselves under siege from the Parliamentarians. It fell to the parliamentary forces in 1645 and was subsequently demolished. St Nicholas's Almshouses were built in 1652 to provide care for the poor. Several public houses were also built in this period, including the Llandoger Trow on King Street and the Hatchet Inn. More churches were built, including St Michael on the Mount Without. It served the St Michaels hill area, {{one of the first}} areas outside the city walls to be colonised by the wealthy merchants who were by then trying to escape the overcrowded and unhealthy conditions in the city centre. The city was by this time beginning to expand rapidly beyond its traditional city walls, and the surrounding villages were starting to become suburbs, such as the villages of Horfield and Brislington. Both had their own churches, the Church of the Holy Trinity with St Edmund and St Lukes respectively.|$|E
5|$|For two years, Bahá'u'lláh {{lived alone}} in the {{mountains}} of Kurdistan. He originally lived as a hermit, dressed like a dervish and used the name Darvish Muhammad-i-Irani. At one point someone noticed his penmanship, which brought the curiosity of the instructors of the local Sufi orders. As he began to take guests, he became noted for his learning and wisdom. Shaykh `Uthmán, Shaykh `Abdu'r-Rahmán, and Shaykh Ismá'íl, leaders of the Naqshbandíyyih, Qádiríyyih, and Khálidíyyih Orders respectively, began to seek his advice. <b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> second of these that the Four Valleys was written. Bahá'u'lláh wrote several other notable books during this time.|$|E
5|$|The Chinese {{victory at}} Unsan {{was as much}} of a {{surprise}} to the Chinese leadership as <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> UN forces. The accidental encounter between the Chinese and US forces at Unsan eased the fear of the Chinese leadership about intervening in Korea, while the performance of the US 1st Cavalry Division was studied in great detail by Chinese commanders. For the UN forces, on the other hand, despite the heavy losses suffered by the US Eighth Army at Unsan, the unexpected Chinese withdrawal made the United Nations Command believe that China did not intervene in Korea on a large scale. PVA Commander Peng Dehuai incorporated the lessons from Unsan for the upcoming Second Phase Campaign, while General Douglas MacArthur launched the Home-by-Christmas Offensive under the assumption that only a weak Chinese force was present in Korea, resulting in the decisive battles at the Ch'ongch'on River and the Chosin Reservoir later that year.|$|E

5|$|The {{location}} {{and history of}} Sarawak {{has resulted in a}} broad diversity of ethnicity, culture and languages. Among the indigenous peoples of Sarawak, outside influences have led to many changes over time. The Iban tribal culture in Sarawak centred on the concept of the warrior and the ability to take heads from other tribes in battle. This practice, central as <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Iban people, was made illegal under James Brooke's rule and ultimately faded away although reminders of the practice are still seen in some long houses. Two other tribal peoples of the Sarawak Highlands, the Kelabit and Lun Bawang, have seen fundamental changes to their ethnic identities {{as a direct result of}} their conversion to Christianity. One major change was the shift in the focal point of their social interactions from the traditional long house to the local church. Their religious devotion has also helped shape their worldview outside of their village, particularly in response to change. For the Penan people, one of the last tribes to still be practising a nomadic lifestyle within the jungle, outside influence, particularly education, has resulted in a significant decline in the population that practice the nomadic lifestyle. Others settle down after intermixing with members of different tribes, such as the Orang Ulu. One direct result of this diversity in cultures, engendered by a policy of tolerance to all races, is the increasing numbers of tribal peoples marrying not only other Sarawakian tribes, but also to Chinese, Malays as well as citizens of European or American descent.|$|E

25|$|As {{with all}} dominions, {{provision}} {{was made for}} an Oath of Allegiance. Within dominions, such oaths were taken by parliamentarians personally towards the monarch. The Irish Oath of Allegiance was fundamentally different. It had two elements; the first, an oath to the Free State, as by law established, the second part a promise of fidelity, to His Majesty, King George V, his heirs and successors. That second fidelity element, however, was qualified in two ways. <b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> King in Ireland, not specifically to the King of the United Kingdom. Secondly, <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> King explicitly {{in his role as}} part of the Treaty settlement, not in terms of pre-1922 British rule. The Oath itself came from a combination of three sources, and was largely the work of Michael Collins in the Treaty negotiations. It came in part from a draft oath suggested prior to the negotiations by President de Valera. Other sections were taken by Collins directly from the Oath of the Irish Republican Brotherhood (IRB), of which he was the secret head. In its structure, it was also partially based on the form and structure used for 'Dominion status'.|$|E

Sir Alan subsequently fired Jenny when she returned to the boardroom, after she attempted to change the story on the Kosher chicken incident a second time so as to shift the blame on Michael and get him fired.|$|E

25|$|On {{graduation}} {{he gained}} Associate Membership of the Institution of Mechanical Engineers, but his professional development was interrupted {{when he was}} called up for two years' National Service in Germany. After demobilisation Maddock went home to Surrey, and returned to Kingston Tech in April 1948 to complete a refresher course to maintain his AMIMechE status. As {{a part of this}} course he was required to spend eighteen months in a commercial workshop. At the time, Surrey was home to quite a few of the UK's smaller road and competition automobile manufacturers – including AC, Alta and HWM – and <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> automobile industry that Maddock directed his attention.|$|E
25|$|Jourdan's {{left wing}} was {{in serious trouble}} because it had to retreat through Altenkirchen.

Fortunately for Jourdan, Marceau and Bernadotte capably held off the Austrian advance guards {{long enough for the}} French left wing to barely get away. Meanwhile, Castelverd withdrew into Neuwied's {{bridgehead}} where his troops were secure behind prepared fortifications. On 19 September, as the last French columns were still filing through Altenkirchen, Jourdan ordered Marceau to hold on a little longer with Poncet's division. During the fighting Marceau was fatally hit by a bullet and died early the next morning.|$|E
25|$|Les Baigneuses—as Robert Delaunay's 1912 City of Paris, and to {{some extent}} Jean Metzinger's 1913 Meudon Landscape—juxtaposes sharply {{contrasting}} elements. On the one hand the artist includes elements from a society in the process of inexorable industrialization, and on the other, the sereneness of timeless classical nude figures (something rarely painted by Gleizes, as Brooke points out). Yet the relationships between the two are formally resolved. This aspect of simultaneity—the optimistic reconciliation of classical tradition and contemporary life—was of particular interest to Gleizes, as <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Section d'Or group of Cubists (also known as the Passy group, or Puteaux group).|$|E

25|$|What, by contrast, can be {{established}} is that from 1911 onwards the term became commonplace and, initially confined as <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> painters of Room 41, it was afterwards attributed to those who seemed, nearly or at a distance, to approach them, in appearance if not in spirit. Apollinaire himself was initially reticent about this label {{and it was not}} until later, after this opening at the Indépendants, during an exhibition which we held at Brussels, that he accepted definitively on his own and our behalf, the name 'Cubist' by which all sorts of people had designated us in irony.

Rechristened the Tsarevich Alexey Nikolayevich Hospital, from October 1915, the palace was a fully {{equipped}} hospital, its staterooms transformed into hospital wards. The Fieldmarshals' Hall became a dressing station, the Armorial Hall an operating theatre. The small throne room became a doctor's mess room, while more lowly staff were accommodated in the Nicholas Hall and the Anteroom. Nurses were housed in the more intimate apartments once reserved for members of the extended Romanov family. The 1812 Gallery became a store room, the vestibule of the Jordan staircase the hospital's canteen, and its landings offices.|$|E

Although {{more than a month}} passed after Roanoke Island fell before Burnside could mount an attack on the city, the local command received no reinforcements. One of General Branch's aides estimated that the lines would need at least 6,130 men to hold them, but he had only about 4,000 at his disposal, a number often reduced by sickness. Furthermore, many of the men were poorly armed militiamen. The disparity between necessity and reality persuaded Branch to draw his lines in, abandoning some of the strong breastworks erected by his predecessor. The principal defense would be the line based on Fort Thompson.|$|E

25|$|In May 2005, {{scientists}} in California recovered and sequenced the nuclear DNA of a cave bear that lived between 42,000 and 44,000 years ago. The procedure used genomic DNA extracted {{from one of}} the animal's teeth. Sequencing the DNA directly (rather than first replicating it with the polymerase chain reaction), the scientists recovered 21 cave bear genes from remains that did not yield significant amounts of DNA with traditional techniques. This study confirmed and built on results from a previous study using mitochondrial DNA extracted from cave bear remains ranging from 20,000 to 130,000 years old. Both show that the cave bear was more closely related to the brown bear and polar bear than <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> American black bear, but had split from the brown bear lineage before the distinct eastern and western brown bear lineages diversified and before the split of brown bears and polar bears. The divergence date estimate of cave bears and brown bears is about 1.2–1.4 Mya.|$|E
