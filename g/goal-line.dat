5|$|On 6 June 2014, Benzema {{was named}} in France's squad for the 2014 FIFA World Cup, making his {{debut in the}} tournament. In the team's first match, a 3–0 win against Honduras in Porto Alegre on 15 June, he scored a goal in each half, the first from a penalty kick. He also {{assisted}} the team's second goal when his shot rebounded off the post and was fumbled over the <b>goal-line</b> by Honduran goalkeeper Noel Valladares for an own goal, the first World Cup goal given by <b>goal-line</b> technology. He was named by FIFA as man of the match for his performance. In the second group fixture, he scored and had a penalty saved in a 5–2 defeat of Switzerland, as Les Bleus all but secured qualification to the knockout stage. France were later knocked out by Germany in the quarter-final stage of the tournament.|$|E
5|$|Brugge now {{needed to}} score, but they only created one more chance. Ten {{minutes before the}} end of the match, Sørensen intercepted a Hansen backpass and shot. His shot was blocked by Clemence, and a <b>goal-line</b> {{clearance}} by Phil Thompson prevented Brugge from equalising. The match remained at 1–0 and Liverpool won their second consecutive European Cup, becoming the first British team to retain the trophy.|$|E
5|$|In 2011, the Eskimos {{utilized}} {{a committee}} of running backs, with McCarty, Daniel Porter, and Jerome Messam all receiving significant playing time. McCarty was used mostly in short-yardage situations on the ground, while also being active as a receiver and on special teams. He played in 18 games, made eight starts, and finished with 209 yards on 52 carries with no touchdowns. He also caught 22 passes for 150 yards and a touchdown. McCarty played in both of the Eskimos' playoff games. In the West Semi-Finals against the Stampeders, he rushed for a <b>goal-line</b> touchdown, in addition to making three receptions and two special-teams tackles. McCarty played a more limited role in the West Finals against the BC Lions, where he was given only one carry for six yards, made one tackle on special teams, and caught two passes {{for a total of}} four yards.|$|E
50|$|Two {{boundary}} lines, {{which are}} curved {{around the edge}} of the field and connect the two <b>goal-lines.</b> Together, the boundary-lines and the <b>goal-lines</b> mark out the playing area, in a slightly truncated oval.|$|R
50|$|The <b>goal-lines</b> are {{the parts}} of the back-lines between the goal-posts.|$|R

5|$|With 2:19 to {{play and}} nursing a one-point lead, Texas was in {{position}} to win if they could run out the clock. They began with a 12-yard rush {{on the left side}} by Jamaal Charles for a first down. Charles then carried again up the middle for a two-yard gain to the Ohio State 7. OSU called a time-out to stop the clock at 1:36. On second-and-goal, Vince Young kept the ball and gained threeyards before being tackled by A. J. Hawk. The Buckeyes again called time-out with 1:23 left. Young carried again for threeyards before being brought down by B. Carpenter and A. J. Hawk just one yard short of the <b>goal-line.</b> This time, Texas took a time-out with 29seconds left to play. Following the time-out, Young handed off to Henry Melton who was stopped for no gain. Ohio State took over on downs.|$|E
5|$|Hearts {{started the}} match as the {{brighter}} {{of the two}} teams. Rudi Skácel headed wide early on from an Andrew Driver cross. Hearts took the lead through Darren Barr in the 15th minute, scoring from close range. Hearts continued to control the match and Pa Kujabi picked up a booking for fouling Suso Santana. Skácel then doubled Hearts' lead after receiving {{the ball on the}} edge of the area and turning to hit a shot which deflected off James McPake before going in. Hibs then had an opportunity as Kujabi's cross came to Garry O'Connor, but he hit his shot over the bar. McPake then made a <b>goal-line</b> clearance from a Suso shot which had beaten Hibs' keeper Mark Brown. McPake got Hibs back into the game from a corner. Tom Soares' initial delivery was cleared but he got the ball back out on the wing and put in a low cross which McPake converted.|$|E
5|$|The Triangles' opening {{game against}} the Columbus Panhandles is {{considered}} by football historians {{to be the first}} football game between two APFA teams. Since kickoff times were not standardized in 1920, it is unknown if this game or the Muncie–Rock Island game is the first game played. The Triangles won 13–0. The Triangles' defense made a <b>goal-line</b> stand in the second quarter while the Panhandles had the ball on the 3-yard line. Before halftime, the Triangles' back Al Mahrt completed a 30-yard pass to end Dutch Thiele to give the Triangles possession on the 5-yard line. The Triangles failed to convert, however, as time ran out. Early in the third quarter, the Triangles started a possession on their own 35-yard line. Four consecutive run plays carried them to midfield. Soon after, back Lou Partlow had a succession of runs which resulted in a touchdown. The other Triangle score came {{in the middle of the}} fourth quarter when end Frank Bacon returned a punt for a 60-yard touchdown. After both touchdowns, George Kinderdine was responsible for the extra points.|$|E
50|$|The wooden {{stands behind}} the <b>goal-lines</b> were standing-room only. The {{south-west}} stands were sitting-room, being separated from 1st Avenue by {{a row of}} linden (tilia) trees. The opposite (north-east) side was roofed and used {{to have the best}} seating arrangements.|$|R
50|$|Jorge Luis Hirschi Stadium {{is located}} on 1st Avenue, between 55th and 57th Streets, in La Plata. In its {{previous}} incarnation, it had room for 23,000. The wooden stands behind the <b>goal-lines</b> were standing-room only. The stands next to the avenue were sitting-room, and were separated from the avenue by a row of tile trees. The opposite side was roofed and had the best seating arrangements. The noisiest fans used to occupy the 55th Street popular, while visiting fans were often directed to the 57th St. popular, opposite a technical high school (whose inconvenient location {{was responsible for the}} relatively small size of the pitch, at 105 x 68 m).|$|R
2500|$|Other rules {{regard the}} scrum-halves {{and how they}} throw in the ball. The scrum must be stable, {{stationary}} and parallel to the <b>goal-lines</b> when they feed the ball; otherwise a free kick is awarded to the non-offending team. If the scrum is acceptable then the scrum-half must feed {{the ball into the}} scrum without delay. The referee will often warn a team and if the warning is not heeded the opposition is awarded a free kick. The ball must be fed {{into the middle of the}} tunnel with its major axis parallel to the ground and touchline. The ball must be thrown in quickly and in a single movement [...] this means that a feed cannot be faked. Once the ball has left the hands of the scrum-half the scrum has begun.|$|R
5|$|The game {{started with}} both teams exchanging several punts {{in the first}} quarter. Maryland gained good field {{position}} after Lauricella kicked a short punt. Running backs Ed Modzelewski and Ed Fullerton then led an 11-play, 56-yard rushing drive for a touchdown. On the kickoff, Bob Ward hit Lauricella and forced a fumble that Maryland recovered on Tennessee's 13-yard line. After four plays, Jack Scarbath pitched to Fullerton who then threw a six-yard forward pass to Bob Shemonski {{in the end zone}} and expanded the Maryland lead to 14–0. Scarbath then engineered a 48-yard drive and ran it in himself for the Terrapins' third touchdown within seven minutes. Late in the second quarter, Tennessee back Bert Rechichar caught a four-yard pass for a touchdown, but the extra point was no good. At {{the end of the first}} half, Maryland had stunned Tennessee by gaining a 21–6 lead. In the fourth quarter, Fullerton intercepted a pass and returned it 46 yards for a touchdown. In the final minutes, Tennessee's <b>goal-line</b> quarterback Herky Payne ran it in from the one-yard line. Maryland won the game with a final result of 28–13.|$|E
5|$|The {{game was}} played on 18 November on an icy pitch (straw had not been spread over the pitch the night before), which nearly caused the game to be cancelled. The All Blacks kicked off, and had {{the best of the}} first ten minutes. Scotland {{eventually}} got a scrum near the All Blacks <b>goal-line,</b> and after winning the scrum, passed to Ernest Simson, who dropped a goal to put Scotland ahead 4–0. It {{was the first time the}} All Blacks had been behind on tour. The All Blacks replied with a try under the posts, which was unconverted. A second try was then scored, by Smith; again it went unconverted. Scotland then scored an unconverted try, to lead at half time 7–6. With less than ten minutes to go the score remained 7–6 and it looked like the All Blacks might lose their first match on tour. However, with four minutes to go the All Blacks had a scrum on halfway; the resulting movement finished with George Smith crossing for a try. Bill Cunningham then scored a try with seconds remaining, and the All Blacks were victorious 12–7.|$|E
5|$|In {{the second}} quarter, Maryland {{advanced}} to the Oklahoma 20-yard line, and Tatum elected for a field goal attempt. Now against the wind, the kick failed, with the ball going wide right. The Sooners took over on downs and halfback Jack Ging completed a pass to end Max Boydston for a five-yard gain. Ging then rushed for threeyards. On the next play, Calame pitched to Grigg who ran {{to the left and}} picked up 12yards for a first down. Calame then completed a pass to back Bob Burris for sixyards. Grigg faked a pass and ran to the right for a gain of 12yards and a first down on the Maryland 39-yard line. The Terrapins stopped two Sooner rushing attempts before Calame connected with Burris again for an 11-yard gain. Burris then rushed for threemore yards to advance to the Maryland 25. Tatum called a time-out. On third down with oneyard to go, Calame faked a handoff to Ging and executed an option run to the left. He pitched to Grigg and threw a block. Grigg was tackled at the <b>goal-line</b> but managed to extend his body into the endzone. Buddy Leake made the extra point. Shortly before halftime, Calame suffered a separated collarbone. With back-up Pat O'Neal also injured, only third-string quarterback Jack Van Pool remained, and he had little game experience.|$|E
2500|$|A ruck {{is formed}} when {{at least one}} player from each side bind onto each other with {{the ball on the}} ground between them. A ruck often ensues {{following}} a tackle. This physical contact, or binding, is generally by locking shoulders while facing each other. Additional players may join the ruck, but must do so from behind the rearmost foot of the hindmost teammate in the ruck; this {{is often referred to as}} [...] "coming through the gate". In a ruck, no player may use their hands to win the ball; instead each side attempts to push the other side off the ball or use their feet to hook it back towards their own side; an action known as rucking. [...] Any player not taking part in the ruck and maul must retreat behind the offside line, a notional line that runs parallel to the <b>goal-lines</b> through the rearmost foot of their hindmost teammate in the ruck or maul.|$|R
50|$|There are a {{large number}} of rules {{regarding}} the specifics of what can and cannot be done during a scrum. Front rowers must engage square on, rather than bore in on an angle. Front-rowers are also banned from twisting their bodies, pulling opponents, or doing anything that might collapse the scrum. The back row must remain bound until the ball has left the scrum. For flankers, this means keeping one arm, up to the shoulder, in contact with the scrum. The scrum must be stable, stationary and parallel to the <b>goal-lines</b> when they feed the ball; otherwise a free kick is awarded to the non-offending team. By strict letter of the law, the ball must be fed {{into the middle of the}} tunnel with its major axis parallel to the ground and touchline; however this is becoming less strictly enforced as the photo in this article illustrates. The ball must be thrown in quickly and in a single movement — this means that a feed cannot be faked. Once the ball has left the hands of the scrum-half the scrum has begun.|$|R
5|$|On 11 October 2013, Benzema scored {{his first}} {{goal for the}} France {{national}} team since June 2012 in a friendly against Australia, thus ending a scoring drought for his national team which had lasted 1,222 minutes. In that match played at the Parc des Princes stadium in Paris, which France won 6–0, Benzema scored France's sixth and final goal in the 50th minute after turning home Franck Ribéry's left-wing cross. In the second leg of the 2014 World Cup qualification play-off against Ukraine held on 19 November 2013 at the Stade de France, Benzema scored France's second goal in the 34th minute to level the aggregate score at 2–2. Benzema scored his goal when he side-footed home after a huge scramble in the Ukrainian penalty box, although he was shown on television replays to be offside by almost one metre when the ball took a final touch off Mathieu Valbuena's chest. Benzema had four minutes earlier been denied a legitimate goal, the offside flag wrongly raised when he turned in Ribéry's low cross into the net with his torso a metre from the Ukrainian <b>goal-line.</b> Ukraine had won {{the first leg of}} the play-off 2–0 in Kiev just four days earlier. France would eventually win the second leg 3–0 to advance to the 2014 World Cup finals in Brazil with a 3–2 aggregate scoreline.|$|E
5|$|The {{next game}} was against Cardiff on 26 December. It {{was billed as}} a virtual second Test against a side that boasted several Test players. The match was played at Cardiff Arms Park in front of 50,000 spectators. After a missed drop goal and missed penalty Cardiff scored with a try to Nicholls that {{was set up by}} Gabe. The {{conversion}} was successful giving Cardiff a 5–0 lead. about 20 minutes into the match Jim O'Sullivan broke his collarbone after being tackled heavily; as a result the All Blacks played the rest of the match with only 14 men. The All Blacks attacked with every opportunity they could and before half time Mona Thomson scored in the corner for the All Blacks. Wallace converted the try to leave the scores 5–5 at half time. For the first 30 minutes of the second half the two teams attacked one after the other. After Cardiff captain Percy Bush failed to force down a ball behind his own <b>goal-line</b> George Nicholson dived on the ball to score a try. Wallace converted to give the All Blacks a 10–5 lead. Cardiff responded by scoring a try themselves, but Winfield failed to convert it and the All Blacks won 10–8. The loss was Cardiff's only loss of the season, and the next year they defeated the touring South Africans 17–0.|$|E
25|$|Pushover tries are rare, however, because scrums {{are awarded}} {{a minimum of}} five metres (16.4 ft) from either <b>goal-line,</b> and either touchline. This means for a pushover try to occur, the scrum must be forced several metres in one {{direction}} without collapsing.|$|E
25|$|The offside rule {{effectively}} {{limits the}} ability of attacking players to remain forward (i.e. closer to the opponent's <b>goal-line)</b> of the ball, the second-to-last defending player (which can include the goalkeeper), and the half-way line. This rule is in effect just like that of soccer.|$|E
25|$|In an {{incredible}} Olympic final, the evenly matched US and Australian sides were tied 3–3 with 1.3 seconds {{remaining on the}} clock, when Yvette Higgins blasted in a nine-metre shot from a free throw. The ball crossed the <b>goal-line</b> 0.2s from the final hooter to give Australia a 4–3 win, and the gold medal.|$|E
25|$|An {{incident}} {{during a}} second-round {{game in the}} 2010 FIFA World Cup between England and Germany, where a shot by Englishman Frank Lampard, which would have leveled the scores at 2–2 in a match that ultimately ended in a 4–1 German victory, crossed the line but was not seen {{to do so by}} the match officials, led FIFA officials to declare that they will re-examine the use of <b>goal-line</b> technology.|$|E
25|$|California came in as 14-point {{favorites}} {{and came}} out struggling against Colorado State. Colorado State {{came out with a}} 7–0 lead early, as Cal's defense failed to stop the run. California answered with a huge play by DeSean Jackson, scoring on a 78-yard run play, and then scored on a Justin Forsett <b>goal-line</b> touchdown. The Rams scored another touchdown, as the Golden Bears added a field goal, to go into halftime with a 17–14 lead.|$|E
25|$|Up {{until this}} point, for an attacking player to be onside, {{there had to}} be at least three {{opposing}} players closer to their <b>goal-line</b> than the attacker. In the 1920s, the offside rule was changed so that only two opposing players were required between the attacker and the <b>goal-line</b> for the attacker to still be onside. This made it easier for attackers to score against the two-man defences of the day. To combat this, Arsenal manager Herbert Chapman devised a system that utilised three defenders as opposed to the usual two. This system was complemented by a strict man-marking regime, whereby the centre-half – who had now retreated to the centre of the three man defence – would stick as close to the opposing centre-forward as possible, while the full-backs – who had moved further wide to accommodate the centre-back – would mark the wingers. This left two mid-fielders in a slightly less advanced position than before to act as wing-halves who would have the dual responsibility of loosely marking the inside forwards and providing the forwards with the ball. This was helped by the slight withdrawal of the inside forwards from the front line. Chapman's formation was referred to as the W–M formation due to its appearance on the field with all the players in their described positions.|$|E
25|$|Grounding {{the ball}} in-goal or putting {{the ball into}} touch are {{considered}} last-ditch defensive techniques that prevent the attacking side from scoring. These two moves effectively force a stoppage of play, which means the opposition cannot score. Both of these measures result in a <b>goal-line</b> drop-out, meaning the attacking team retains possession of the ball. Thus, even if an attacking team is unable to score they can regain another set of chances to score by forcing the defending team to perform either of the above two moves; accomplish by placing a kick into the in-goal area.|$|E
25|$|Shoot-out {{competition}} between two teams {{is similar to}} the ice hockey penalty shootout. Each team has five penalty shoot-outs where 5 players are nominated. Each player, with the ball on the 23 m line, the goalkeeper/defending player on or behind the <b>goal‐line</b> between the goal posts, starts with the umpire's signal and has a maximum of 8 seconds to score a goal with only the goal keeper defending the goal. The player can take as many shots possible within the stipulated 8 secs. A penalty stroke is awarded in case of intentional foul by the goal-keeper. The shoot-outs are used only in the knockout stage.|$|E
25|$|Different {{positions}} require different passing skills. The fake pass {{should be}} mastered by every position. The centre pass should be mastered by the Centre. The Centre should also master any pass {{that must be}} made on the run. Both the Goal Attack and Wing Attack should be familiar with the long passes and the lob and drop pass. The Goal Attack should also be familiar with all styles of passing. The Goal Shooter should know how to do penalty passes. The Wing Defence should also be comfortable making lob passes. The Goal Defence should know how to make <b>goal-line</b> passes. The Goal Keeper should be comfortable making penalty passes and inbounding the ball.|$|E
25|$|Some controversies arose {{during the}} qualifications. In the second {{leg of the}} {{play-off}} between France and the Republic of Ireland, French captain Thierry Henry, unseen by the referee, handled {{the ball in the}} lead up to a late goal, which enabled France to qualify ahead of Ireland, sparking widespread comment and debate. FIFA rejected a request from the Football Association of Ireland to replay the match, and Ireland later withdrew a request to be included as an unprecedented 33rd World Cup entrant. As a result, FIFA announced a review into the use of technology or extra officials at the highest level, but decided against the widely expected fast-tracking of <b>goal-line</b> referee's assistants for the South African tournament.|$|E
25|$|The 40/20 rule is a {{relatively}} new rule created to reward excellence in kicking for touch. When a player on the attacking team kicks the ball from behind his 40-metre line and it goes into touch between the opposition's 20-metre line and <b>goal-line</b> after bouncing at least once within the field of play, a 40/20 is awarded. The usual decision to give the head and feed of the scrum to the non-kicking team when the ball enters touch is reversed if the kick is a 40/20. As scrums are rarely competitive, a successful 40/20 virtually guarantees possession in an attacking position by effectively moving the team from their own 40-metre line to the position where the ball went out.|$|E
25|$|Hawk-Eye {{is one of}} the <b>goal-line</b> {{technology}} (GLT) systems authorised by FIFA. Hawk-eye {{tracks the}} ball, and informs the referee if a ball fully crosses the goal line into the goal. The purpose of the system is to eliminate errors in assessing if a goal was scored. The Hawk-eye system was one of the systems trialed by the sport's governors prior to the 2012 change to the Laws of the Game that made GLT a permanent part of the game, and it has been used in various competitions since then. GLT is not compulsory. and, owing to the cost of Hawk-Eye and its competitors, systems are only deployed in a few high-level competitions.|$|E
25|$|Suárez is Uruguay's all-time leading goalscorer. At the 2010 FIFA World Cup, {{he played}} an {{important}} role in Uruguay's fourth-place finish, scoring three goals, as well as controversially blocking a goal-bound extra time header with his hands during the quarter-final against Ghana. At the 2011 Copa América, Suárez scored four goals as Uruguay won a record fifteenth Copa América, and he was named Player of the Tournament. At the 2014 FIFA World Cup in Brazil, Suárez scored his 40th international goal. Suárez has been a source of controversy throughout his career. As well as his <b>goal-line</b> handball, he has also bitten opponents on three separate occasions. He has also been accused of and admitted to diving, and in 2011, the FA found him guilty of racially abusing Patrice Evra, a decision Suárez disputes.|$|E
25|$|If a minor {{infringement}} occurs a scrum or free kick {{is awarded}} to the non-offending team. For more serious misdemeanors the referee awards a penalty. If the non-offending team gains an advantage the referee can allow play to continue. The referee has wide discretion on whether any advantage has occurred; with penalty advantages needing a greater gain than scrum advantages. If no advantage is gained play is taken back to where the infringement occurred. The penalty or free kick is taken where the infringement occurred, or moved out five metres if it {{is close to the}} goal line. The ball can be kicked in any direction and played at again by the person kicking it. The rest of the team must stay behind the kicker until the ball has been kicked. The opposition must retire ten metres or to their <b>goal-line.</b>|$|E
25|$|In 1954 (even with Cassady now a {{seasoned}} junior) the Buckeyes were picked to finish {{no higher than}} 5th in the Big Ten. Athletic Director Dick Larkins, a Hayes defender, hired Lyal Clark back from Minnesota, where he had gone with Fesler, to coach the Buckeye defense, allowing Hayes to concentrate on offense and easing the pressure Hayes inevitably put on his assistants. That season no opponent scored more than two touchdowns on the Buckeyes, and seven of the ten were held to a touchdown or less. An 88-yard interception return by Cassady against second-ranked Wisconsin and a 4th quarter <b>goal-line</b> stand inside its own one-yard line against Michigan propelled Ohio State to a perfect season that included a 20–7 victory over USC in the Rose Bowl. Woody Hayes won his first and the team's second national championship.|$|E
25|$|Newly {{acquired}} Packers receiver John Jefferson fell on {{his rear}} end while showing off for the crowd during pregame introductions, a display that inspired the Buccaneer defense. After the Packers took an early 7–0 lead on a Gerry Ellis touchdown run, the Buccaneers scored 21 unanswered points. Doug Williams completed 15 of 23 passes for 199 yards, a career-best 65.2% completion percentage. Green Bay attempted a late rally, as George Cumby's 68-yard return of a James Wilder <b>goal-line</b> fumble set up a field goal to bring the score to 21–10. After the Buccaneers were forced to punt on the following possession, the Packers drove {{all the way to}} the Tampa Bay 7-yard line before Scot Brantley intercepted a Lynn Dickey pass to kill the drive. Dickey, under the pressure of a constant pass rush, was also intercepted by Hugh Green, Cecil Johnson, and Neal Colzie.|$|E
25|$|The Cowboys had {{a chance}} to score in the third quarter with the ball on LSU's one-yard line on first down. However, the Tigers came up with another <b>goal-line</b> stand, this time by the White Team with a fumble recovery. In the fourth quarter, Hardin-Simmons had another chance as it drove down to the LSU 14-yard line, but turned the ball over on downs after an {{incomplete}} pass on fourth down. The game featured much more passing than LSU had seen in the previous two games. Hardin-Simmons, whose head coach Baugh was a former star quarterback in the National Football League, was a passing-minded team. While LSU rushed for 204 yards, Hardin-Simmons passed for 201 yards on 19 completions. Warren Rabb, who was playing despite {{the death of his father}} that morning, completed six passes for 88 yards. For the third game in a row, Cannon was the leading rusher with 83 yards and a touchdown on eleven carries.|$|E
