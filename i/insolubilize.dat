40|$|The extensin {{component}} of primary cell walls {{has generally been}} {{considered to be an}} intrinsically insoluble cell wall glycoprotein. Recent data have established that cell wall extensin is in fact secreted in a soluble monomeric form which slowly becomes insolubilized in the cell wall probably through the oxidative formation of isodityrosine cross-links. We now show that isolated cell walls from aerated root slices of Daucus carota have the capacity to <b>insolubilize</b> extensin through the formation of isodityrosine. This in vitro cross-linking is specific for the extensin glycoprotein, as other wall proteins are not cross-linked by the isolated wall system. Although extensin can be cross-linked in solution by peroxidase and H 2 O 2, dityrosine and not isodityrosine is the phenolic cross-link formed. Wall-catalyzed cross-linking of soluble extensin is inhibited by l-ascorbate, and both the initial rate and total extent of cross-linking are inhibited by acidic pH in the physiological range (pH 4 to 6). We suggest several mechanisms by which acid might inhibit cross-linking and propose that cytoplasmic factors (ascorbate and/or hydrogen ions) may regulate the solubility of extensin in vivo...|$|E

40|$|Background: Leucine-rich repeat extensins (LRXs) are {{extracellular}} proteins {{consisting of}} an N-terminal leucine-rich repeat (LRR) domain and a C-terminal extensin domain containing the typical {{features of this}} class of structural hydroxyproline-rich glycoproteins (HRGPs). The LRR domain is likely to bind an interaction partner, whereas the extensin domain has an anchoring function to <b>insolubilize</b> the protein in the cell wall. Based on {{the analysis of the}} root hair-expressed LRX 1 and LRX 2 of Arabidopsis thaliana, LRX proteins are important for cell wall development. The importance of LRX proteins in non-root hair cells and on the structural changes induced by mutations in LRX genes remains elusive. Results: The LRX gene family of Arabidopsis consists of eleven members, of which LRX 3, LRX 4, and LRX 5 are expressed in aerial organs, such as leaves and stem. The importance of these LRX genes for plant development and particularly cell wall formation was investigated. Synergistic effects of mutations with gradually more severe growth retardation phenotypes in double and triple mutants suggest a similar function of the three genes. Analysis of cell wall composition revealed a number of changes to cell wall polysaccharides in the mutants. Conclusions: LRX 3, LRX 4, and LRX 5, and most likely LRX proteins in general, are important for cell wall development. Due to the complexity of changes in cell wall structures in the lrx mutants, the exact function of LRX proteins remains to be determined. The increasingly strong growth-defect phenotypes in double and triple mutants suggests that the LRX proteins have similar functions and that they are important for proper plant development...|$|E
40|$|This thesis {{focuses on}} the {{investigation}} of two strategies for stabilizing the photovoltaic performance of polymer solar cells. Polymer solar cells (PSC) fabricated using solution processable conjugated polymers offer the potential for high-speed production of solar cell modules at low cost. However, achieving high power conversion efficiency (PCE) and long lifetime remains a challenge for PSCs. Photoexcitation of a conjugated polymer generates tightly bound electron-hole pairs (i. e., excitons) that require an electron acceptor (e. g., fullerene) for the dissociation of excitons into free charges. An interpenetrating network of conjugated polymer and fullerene (i. e., bulk heterojunction) is ideal for efficient charge generation due {{to the existence of}} a high interfacial area. However, such a morphology is not thermodynamically stable and is subject to large phase segregation in the form of fullerene aggregation provoked by the build-up of excessive heat during the operation of PSCs. Consequently, the PCE of PSCs degrades over time. In this thesis, two strategies for morphological stabilization are investigated using derivatives of poly(benzo[1, 2 -b: 4, 5 -b′]dithiophene-thieno[3, 4 -b]thiophene) (PTB). In one strategy, a derivative of PTB having thermally-cleavable tetrahydropyran (THP) sidechains (PTB(THP)) is synthesized. Removal of the THP sidechains by thermal annealing reduces the mobility of PTB, thus retarding the diffusion of fullerene through the polymer matrix to form large aggregates. Photovoltaic (PV) devices made from PTB(THP) after thermal-cleavage of the sidechains exhibited stable PCE over prolonged thermal annealing, which is attributed to the thermally-stable morphology observed by microscopic studies. In the second strategy, a series of PTB derivatives bearing photocrosslinkable chlorooctyl sidechains (PTB-Cl) are synthesized. Photocrosslinking initiated by deep UV is able to <b>insolubilize</b> thin films of PTB-Cls. PV devices having stable PCE over prolonged thermal annealing were demonstrated using photocrosslinked PTB-Cls. However, high-number of photocrosslinkable sidechains and prolonged UV irradiation pose negative effects on the PCE and stability of PV devices made from PTB-Cls. In addition, accurate PCE measurement is of importance for the research of PSC. In Chapter 4, measurement errors of PCE using a simple xenon arc lamp are discussed. Improvements of measurement accuracy are demonstrated following simple modifications of the instruments and the measurement procedure...|$|E
40|$|Strict {{anti-pollution}} {{laws have}} drastically changed how pharmaceutical manufacturers operate. Increased environmental awareness has forced {{changes in the}} way that sustained release pharmaceuticals are manufactured. Coatings which were once applied from organic solutions have been reformulated into water based polymeric dispersions that, although effective, cannot equal the performance of their predecessors. Research has led to updated coatings composed of three time tested polymers; cellulose acetate, ethylcellulose and methacrylic acid copolymer. Additionally, new coatings have been manufactured from custom polymers which provide excellent sustained release. Unfortunately, their development has not progressed beyond the laboratory since regulatory bodies worldwide are reluctant to approve new polymers for use in vivo. Clearly there exists a need for new coating materials that are 2 ̆ 2 environmentally friendly, 2 ̆ 2 approvable for in vivo use, and effective. An attempt was made to identify materials which, in addition to imparting sustained release, could be used safely, without organic solvents. The crosslinking of a water soluble polymer was decided to be the most feasible means of achieving that goal. Hence hydroxyethylcellulose (HEC), a water soluble, GRAS (generally recognized as safe) polymer was identified and evaluated under various conditions. The ability to <b>insolubilize</b> films of HEC was demonstrated when films containing riboflavin- 52 ̆ 7 -phosphate were exposed to visible or ultraviolet light. The drug release controlling potential of those films was demonstrated by their application to tablets containing model drugs, and their subsequent insolubilization via visible light exposure. Release rates of tablets with crosslinked coatings were determined in vitro and found to be nearly zero order and well controlled, in both water and 0. 1 N HCI. The ((shortcomings of this technique lie in the difficulties in quantitatively assaying the crosslinked polymer. Since the crosslinked polymer is largely water and organo-insoluble, attempts were made to differentiate between crosslinked and uncrosslinked polymer. To date none of the techniques evaluated provides a means to differentiate between the HEC 2 ̆ 7 s. While analysis of the crosslinked polymer has proven difficult, a system capable of providing for the sustained release, composed entirely of GRAS materials and not requiring organic solvents, has been realized...|$|E

40|$|Piezoelectric Quartz crystal {{has been}} used as {{transducer}} in biosensor research for years. Protein immobilization is the major concern of this quartz crystal microbalance (QCM) type of biosensor. In this research, different kind of physical and chemical protein immobilization methods were studied and compared with respect to their performance as well as the processes involved in the preparation. Among chemical methods, the use of 11 -mercaptoundecanol for gold electrode surface activation followed by carbodiimide condensation presents the bast responses when human serum albumin, HSA, used as insolubilized material for anti-HSA anti-HSA antibody detection. At anti-HSA concentration of 0. 5 mg/ml the change of frequency was 245 Hz which was better than when the short chain mercaptans were used as activation agents. Pyrrole based electro-induced polymerization was used for insolubilizing HSA on electrode surface. This novel immobilization approach in QCM study offers better sensitivities than the results from short chain mercaptans activation methods and is slightly inferior than the use of eleven-carbon mercaptan. The use of electro-induced polymerization to <b>insolubilize</b> protein on QCM electrode surface presents the advantages of simple, fast and easily scaled-up in its preparation which in turn favors the practical utilization of QCM in practical application. In this study, the feasibility of using both sides of the quartz crystal for anti-HSA determination was examined. The results showed the responses were almost double when a flow cell design was uptaken which diverted the flow to other side after the sample flowed thru the first side of the electrode. The results indicate that double-side flow cell design offers not only the increase of sensitivity but also the possibility of determining dual analystes in one sample flow. 壓電晶體生物感測器是一種以質量變化做為感測依據的檢測方法。製作壓電生物感測器時，最主要的是如何固定蛋白質於晶體表面上。本論文中，主要探討物理性吸附法、化學共價鍵結法及電聚合高分子法等各種蛋白質固定法，進一步探討壓電晶體生物感測器在免疫分析上之應用。其中化學共價鍵固定法中的C 11 /EDC/HSA是利用長鏈 11 -mercaptoundecanol作表面活化，再以 1 -ethyl- 3 -(3 -dimethylaminopropyl) carbodiimide作架接固定HSA的結果較佳，在檢測Anti-HSA濃度 0. 5 mg/ml時頻率約為 245 Hz左右，不過其製作手續繁雜且時間需要較久。而電聚合pyrrole固定HSA的頻率變化約為 210 Hz左右，固定方法簡便又快速，應有實用於針對臨床診斷之潛力。 另外本論文亦開發晶片雙面之檢測，在使用物理性吸附固定法時，雙面檢測的頻率約可增加兩倍，在檢測Anti-HSA濃度 0. 5 mg/ml時頻率可降至 280 Hz。故未來除了可應用於增強頻率變化以提高靈敏度外，亦可發展同時檢測兩種不同被測物的檢測晶片上。摘要 I 英文摘要 II 目錄 III 表目錄 VI 圖目錄 VII 第一章、緒論 1 第二章、研究背景 3 2 - 1 、生物感測器 3 2 - 1 - 1 、生物感測器之原理 3 2 - 1 - 2 、生物感測器之組成 3 2 - 2 、壓電晶體生物感測器 8 2 - 2 - 1 、壓電晶體材料 9 2 - 2 - 2 、壓電晶體感測原理[林, 1998] 10 2 - 2 - 3 、壓電晶體生物感測器之應用 12 2 - 2 - 4 、壓電免疫感測器 13 2 - 3 、晶體電極表面蛋白質固定法 18 2 - 3 - 1 、物理性吸附法 18 2 - 3 - 2 、化學法 18 2 - 3 - 3 、包埋法 20 第三章、實驗 23 3 - 1 、實驗設備 23 3 - 1 - 1 、壓電感測裝置系統 23 3 - 1 - 2 、電鍍金之設備 23 3 - 1 - 3 、電鍍電聚合高分子之設備 23 3 - 1 - 4 、其他設備 24 3 - 2 、實驗藥品 27 3 - 3 、藥品配製 29 3 - 3 - 1 、鍍金液 29 3 - 3 - 2 、POD(PERIODATE-OXIDIZED DEXTRAN) 之製作 29 3 - 3 - 3 、PYRROLE之純化 30 3 - 3 - 4 、其他 30 3 - 4 、實驗步驟 32 3 - 4 - 1 、晶體電極之鍍金 32 3 - 4 - 2 、清潔電極 33 3 - 4 - 3 、物理性吸附固定法 33 3 - 4 - 4 、化學共價鍵固定法 33 3 - 4 - 5 、包埋法 44 3 - 4 - 6 、晶片之量測 45 3 - 4 - 7 、晶片雙面檢測(使用物理性吸附) 46 第四章、結果與討論 47 4 - 1 、物理性吸附固定法 47 4 - 1 - 1 、重覆使用性及濃度與頻率變化關係 47 4 - 1 - 2 、物理性固定法吸附現象之探討 47 4 - 2 、化學共價鍵固定法 56 4 - 2 - 1 、再生緩衝液之選擇 56 4 - 2 - 2 、以CYSTAMINE與CYSTEAMINE做表面修飾之探討 56 4 - 2 - 3 、自身聚集單分子膜(SAM) 之鏈長比較 64 4 - 2 - 4 、物理性吸附及短鏈分子固定法之比較 67 4 - 3 、電聚合高分子固定法之探討 69 4 - 3 - 1 、以掃環伏的方式電聚合固定HSA 69 4 - 3 - 2 、以定電壓的方式電聚合固定HSA 70 4 - 4 、雙面檢測結果及討論 75 第五章、結論 78 第六章、未來展望 81 參考文獻 8...|$|E

After three washes, {{the amount of}} <b>insolubilized</b> MVs was measured by prothrombinase assay in standardized medium containing human coagulation factors (1.2  μM FII, 33.3  pM FVa, 11.2  pM FXa, 2.2  mM CaCl 2). Variations of absorbance of pNAPEP 0216, a thrombin chromogenic substrate (1.52  mM final concentration, Cryopep, Montpellier, France), were detected in kinetic mode using a thermostated spectrophotometer set at 405  nm (VersaMax Molecular Devices, Sunnyvale, CA, USA). The absorbance values were converted into nanomolar phosphatidylserine equivalent (PhtdSer eq.) by reference to a calibration curve using synthetic vesicles (33 % w/w PhtdSer and 67 % w/w PhtdChol). In the prothrombinase assay, PhtdSer exposed by MVs is the rate-limiting factor of the reaction leading to thrombin generation [26].|$|R
