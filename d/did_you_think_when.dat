The senator was in a grave mood; when asked how he thought the White House might accommodate a family as large as his, he responded, [...] "Do you think {{that is going to be}} my biggest problem?" [...] When Paar more seriously asked if jobs would solve the problems of urban ghettos, Kennedy replied that while job opportunity was important, it needed to be accompanied by [...] "compassion for one's fellow human beings."

6000|$|... "Of course! <b>Did</b> <b>you</b> <b>think,</b> <b>when</b> {{everybody}} else knew, you could {{keep it from}} me? Still, that isn't what I asked you. I {{want you to be}} careful." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "So {{they told}} her; but no,--she insisted {{she knew the}} difference,--it was a baby. Well, what <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>think,</b> <b>when</b> the storm cleared off, they found a baby's cradle washed ashore sure enough!" ...|$|R
6000|$|... ‘Pardon me, Colonel,’ {{said the}} Prince; ‘I readily acquit you of any design of offence, but your words bite like satire.

The war was to go on till victory was won.. They died happily, believing that those who had spoken for England would keep their word. You're very soft-hearted in that article, sir, about the living. <b>Did</b> <b>you</b> <b>think,</b> <b>when</b> you sat down to write it, about the dead?--about that wilderness of white crosses out in France?

40|$|The {{majority}} of employers {{of students from}} the Department of Agricultural and Biosystems Engineering at Iowa State University use behavioral-based interviewing (BBI) techniques. This process focuses on past behaviors (what <b>did</b> <b>you</b> <b>do?)</b> rather than opinions (what <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>think?).</b> <b>When</b> students interview for full-time employment and internships, {{they are expected to}} relate experiences showing how they’ve developed and demonstrated competencies important to the employer. The STAR (Situation, Task, Action, Result) is a technique for describing actions related to specific competencies. Competency development and demonstration are also critical components of our departmental outcomes assessment plan. This paper discusses BBI, the relationship between BBI and STARs, how we are integrating STARs into our curriculum from freshman to senior years, how our students successfully use STARs, and how STARs contribute to our overall outcome assessment plan...|$|R

"And {{it will be}} well if he {{have not}} done so as a man. <b>Do</b> <b>you</b> <b>think</b> that <b>when</b> people hear that these changes have been made with my {{assistance}} they will stop to unravel it all, and to see that I have been only a fool and not a knave?

5000|$|The song {{exists in}} two versions. One is {{found on the}} {{explicit}} editions, in which lead singer Pierre Bouvier sings the word fucks in the second verse (and <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>think</b> about me <b>when</b> he fucks you). In the music video and for radio play, the word is omitted and sometimes replaced with touches (and <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>think</b> about me <b>when</b> he touches you). This is the second song in which Simple Plan uses fuck, after the demo version of [...] "I'm Just a Kid" [...] (changed to hell in the final studio version, though they still use fuck in live performances). The verses' chord progressions are similar to Green Day's [...] "Boulevard of Broken Dreams" [...] and Oasis' [...] "Wonderwall".|$|R
