25|$|<b>Frank</b> <b>Rich,</b> {{for many}} years the chief drama critic for The New York Times, had first {{garnered}} attention, while an undergraduate at Harvard University, with a lengthy essay for the Harvard Crimson about the show, which he had seen during its pre-Broadway run in Boston. He predicted that the show eventually would achieve recognition as a Broadway classic. Rich later wrote that audiences at the original production were baffled and restless.|$|E

25|$|In a 1995 Washington Post article, Jim Marks cited Bawer's {{observation}} that (in Marks's paraphrase) “it gets harder {{to claim that}} {{gay men and lesbians}} are outside mainstream culture, when so much of mainstream culture—the Mona Lisa and Moby-Dick, to use Bawer's examples—is seen as the product of gay and lesbian minds.” In a 1996 piece on gay marriage, New York Times columnist <b>Frank</b> <b>Rich</b> cited Bawer's view that there existed “a gentlemen's agreement” among Washington conservatives. He quoted Bawer as saying: “They say 'We'll socialize with you and your significant other and we'll all be charming, as long as you don't mention it in public, and we get to say anything we want in public.'” A 1997 Washington Post article about an upcoming episode of Ellen DeGeneres's sitcom, “Ellen,” on which her character would come out of the closet, mimicking DeGeneres's own recent coming out, ended with a quote from Bawer. “People used to do courageous things without having a publicist around to tell the world,” he said.|$|E

50|$|Near {{the opening}} of the show, the cast {{explains}} to the audience that some of the characters are loosely based on actual figures, while others are composites of multiple figures. The story hews closely to historical accounts of the period, particularly Bob Drogin's book Curveball: Spies, Lies, and the Con Man Who Caused a War (2007) and <b>Frank</b> <b>Rich's</b> book The Greatest Story Ever Sold: The Decline and Fall of Truth in Bush's America (2006).|$|R
500|$|In 1982, Peters {{returned}} to the New York stage after an eight-year absence {{in one of her}} few non-musical stage appearances, the Off-Broadway Manhattan Theatre Club production of the comedy-drama Sally and Marsha, for which she was nominated for a Drama Desk Award. She then {{returned to}} Broadway as Dot/Marie in the Stephen Sondheim–James Lapine musical Sunday in the Park with George in 1984, for which she received her third Tony Award nomination. The New York Times theatre critic <b>Frank</b> <b>Rich</b> called her performance [...] "radiant". She recorded the role for PBS in 1986, winning a 1987 ACE Award. Her next role was Emma in Andrew Lloyd Webber's Song and Dance on Broadway in 1985, winning her first Tony Award for Best Leading Actress in a Musical. <b>Frank</b> <b>Rich</b> wrote in an otherwise negative review of the show that Peters [...] "has no peer in the musical theater right now." ...|$|E

The film was a major success; Stanley Kauffmann of The New Republic praised it as [...] "crystalline cinema" [...] and <b>Frank</b> <b>Rich</b> of Time described it as [...] "cool, cinematic grace".|$|E
500|$|For the 2007 dinner, the White House Correspondents' Association {{brought back}} the less {{controversial}} Rich Little. Arianna Huffington reported that Colbert {{told her he had}} specifically avoided reading any reviews of his performance, and remained unaware of the public's reaction. On June 13, 2007, he was presented with a Spike TV Guys' Choice Award for [...] "Gutsiest Move". He accepted the award via video conference. Six months later, New York Times columnist <b>Frank</b> <b>Rich</b> called Colbert's after-dinner speech a [...] "cultural primary", christening it the [...] "defining moment" [...] of the United States' 2006 midterm elections. Three and a half years after the speech, <b>Frank</b> <b>Rich</b> referenced it again, calling it [...] "brilliant" [...] and [...] "good for the country", while columnist Dan Savage referred to it as [...] "one of the things that kept people like me sane during the darkest days of the Bush years". The editor of The Realist, Paul Krassner, later put Colbert's performance in historical context, saying that it stands out among contemporary US satire as the only example of the spirit of the satire of Lenny Bruce, George Carlin, and Richard Pryor, which took risks and broke barriers to free speech, [...] "rather than just proudly exercising it as comedians do now." ...|$|E

500|$|New York Times critic <b>Frank</b> <b>Rich</b> {{said of the}} 1992 London production: [...] "What is {{remarkable}} about Mr. Hytner's direction, aside from its unorthodox faith in the virtues of simplicity and stillness, {{is its ability to}} make a 1992 audience believe in Hammerstein's vision of redemption, which has it that a dead sinner can return to Earth to do godly good." [...] The Hytner production in New York was hailed by many critics as a grittier Carousel, which they deemed more appropriate for the 1990s. [...] Clive Barnes of the New York Post called it a [...] "defining Carousel—hard-nosed, imaginative, and exciting." ...|$|E
500|$|He went on {{to direct}} and choreograph the 1970 Broadway musical The Rothschilds, {{starring}} Hal Linden, and [...] directed The Goodbye Girl, with Bernadette Peters and Martin Short, a 1993 adaptation of the 1977 Neil Simon film that was his final Broadway play. Although he {{was nominated for a}} Tony Award for best director, reviews were mixed. In The New York Times, <b>Frank</b> <b>Rich</b> said that [...] "Kidd, who did much to define slam-bang Broadway and Hollywood musical-comedy style in the 1950s, directs 'The Goodbye Girl' in a mechanical reduction of that style: everything is fast, furious, loud and downstage center. Not that any director could overcome this musical's physical production." ...|$|E
500|$|In the 1984 Broadway {{production}} of The Three Musketeers at The Broadway Theatre, Taylor played Porthos, {{one of the}} three title characters. After fifteen preview performances, the show ran just nine times before closing. <b>Frank</b> <b>Rich</b> wrote that the musketeers were [...] "professionally played" [...] by Taylor and his co-stars Brent Spiner and Chuck Wagner but felt the three had [...] "little dialogue and often seem like interchangeable stand-ins for the Three Stooges." [...] A similar view was held by William B. Collins of the Philadelphia Inquirer who said they [...] "speak as in one voice and behave like comedians who have been stranded without good material." ...|$|E
5000|$|In <b>Frank</b> <b>Rich's</b> New York Times {{review of}} the Broadway production, he wrote: [...] "Miss Peters is more than talented: As an actress, singer, comedienne and {{all-around}} warming presence, she has no peer in the musical theater right now. In her half of Song & Dance, she works so hard you'd think she were pleading for mercy before a firing squad. Yet for all the vocal virtuosity, tempestuous fits and husky-toned charm she brings to her one-woman musical marathon, we never care if her character lives or dies.." ...|$|R

5000|$|In Hot Seat, <b>Frank</b> <b>Rich's</b> {{annotated}} book of his New York Times theatre reviews, {{he recalled}} that Prince of Central Park was [...] "laughed off by all the critics and quickly disappeared" [...] and that Variety had accused him of tricking his readers [...] "by supplying his own, ostensibly superior libretto for the show" [...] in his review. Rich wrote that Hirschfeld went on to purchase the New York Post for two weeks (nearly destroying it) and later served time in jail and that in retrospect, the flop {{was one of the}} finer achievements of his career.|$|R
500|$|Once {{filming of}} Breezy had finished, Warners {{announced}} that Eastwood {{had agreed to}} reprise his role as Callahan in Magnum Force (1973), a sequel to Dirty Harry, {{about a group of}} rogue young officers (among them David Soul, Robert Urich and Tim Matheson) in the San Francisco Police Department who systematically exterminate the city's worst criminals. Although the film was a major success after release, grossing $58.1million in the United States (a record for Eastwood), it was not a critical success. The New York Times critic Nora Sayre panned the often contradictory moral themes of the film, while the paper's <b>Frank</b> <b>Rich</b> called it [...] "the same old stuff".|$|E
500|$|In the January 22, 2006 issue, {{columnist}} <b>Frank</b> <b>Rich</b> {{used the}} term seven times, with credit to Colbert, in a column titled [...] "Truthiness 101: From Frey to Alito", to discuss Republican portrayals of several issues (including the Samuel Alito nomination, the Bush administration's response to Hurricane Katrina, and Jack Murtha's Vietnam War record). Rich emphasized {{the extent to which}} the word had quickly become a cultural fixture, writing, [...] "The mock Comedy Central pundit Stephen Colbert's slinging of the word 'truthiness' caught on instantaneously last year precisely because we live in the age of truthiness." [...] Editor & Publisher reported on Rich's use of [...] "truthiness" [...] in his column, saying he [...] "tackled the growing trend to 'truthiness,' as opposed to truth, in the U.S." ...|$|E
500|$|As part of Obama's {{call for}} responsibility, he said [...] "what is {{required}} of us now is {{a new era of}} responsibility—a recognition, on the part of every American" [...] and [...] "those of us who manage the public's dollars will be held to account." [...] Obama quoted the lyrics of the Jerome Kern and Dorothy Fields song [...] "Pick Yourself Up" [...] from the musical comedy Swing Time, saying that [...] "starting today, we must pick ourselves up, dust ourselves off, and begin again the work of remaking America." [...] In an article for The New York Times, columnist and former drama critic <b>Frank</b> <b>Rich</b> noted the link to the lyric in Field's song from the movie, writing that Obama offered in his address [...] "one subtle whiff of the Great Depression".|$|E

5000|$|<b>Frank</b> <b>Rich's</b> {{critique}} of the original production had been positive, [...] but New York Times policy prohibited re-reviewing shows unless they were changed substantially, so his earlier comments were overshadowed by those damaging ones made more recently by Clive Barnes, among others. The general consensus was that The Human Comedy, with its intimate story staged in a semi-oratorio style with no scenery save for rear projections used to define each scene's locale, was not suited for a large venue with a conventional proscenium stage. Following Dude and Via Galactica, it was MacDermot's third critical and commercial failure, and proved to be his last attempt at a Broadway musical.|$|R
500|$|<b>Frank</b> <b>Rich</b> {{referenced}} truthiness {{again in}} The New York Times in 2008, describing {{the strategy of}} John McCain's presidential campaign as being [...] "to envelop the entire presidential race in a thick fog of truthiness", Rich explained that the campaign was based on truthiness because [...] "McCain, Sarah Palin and their surrogates keep repeating the same lies over and over not just to smear their opponents {{and not just to}} mask their own record. Their larger aim is to construct a bogus alternative reality so relentless it can overwhelm any haphazard journalistic stabs at puncturing it." [...] Rich also noted, [...] "You know the press is impotent at unmasking this truthiness when the hardest-hitting interrogation McCain has yet faced on television came on [...] 'The View'. Barbara Walters and Joy Behar called him on several falsehoods, including his endlessly repeated fantasy that Palin opposed earmarks for Alaska. Behar used the word 'lies' to his face." ...|$|E
500|$|In 1979, Streep began workshopping Alice in Concert, {{a musical}} version of Alice's Adventures in Wonderland, with writer and {{composer}} Elizabeth Swados and director Joseph Papp; {{the show was}} put on at New York's Public Theater from December 1980. <b>Frank</b> <b>Rich</b> of The New York Times referred to Streep as the [...] "one wonder" [...] of the production, but questioned why she had devoted so much energy to it. By 1980, Streep had progressed to leading roles in films. She was featured {{on the cover of}} Newsweek magazine with the headline [...] "A Star for the 80s", with Jack Kroll commenting, [...] "There's a sense of mystery in her acting; she doesn't simply imitate (although she's a great mimic in private). She transmits a sense of danger, a primal unease lying just below the surface of normal behavior". Streep denounced the fervent media coverage of her at this time as [...] "excessive hype".|$|E
500|$|Colbert {{received}} a chilly {{response from the}} audience. His jokes were often met with silence and muttering, apart from the enthusiastic laughter of a few in the audience. The major media outlets {{paid little attention to}} it initially. Washington Post columnist Dan Froomkin and Columbia University Graduate School of Journalism professor Todd Gitlin claimed that this was because Colbert's routine was as critical of the media as it was of Bush. Richard Cohen, also writing for The Washington Post, responded that the routine was not funny. The video of Colbert's performance became an internet and media sensation, while, in the week following the speech, ratings for The Colbert Report rose by 37% to average just under 1.5million total viewers per episode. In Time magazine James Poniewozik called it [...] "the political-cultural touchstone issue of 2006".
