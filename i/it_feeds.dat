5|$|Because <b>it</b> <b>feeds</b> in flight, {{the storm}} petrel is less {{affected}} by oil pollution than other seabirds, {{and may be}} able to use its good sense of smell to avoid slicks, although a large spill near a breeding colony could have serious consequences.|$|E
5|$|Established clearfelling {{practices}} {{have been shown}} to favour the Pindi moth, and could lead to it being considered a pest due to opportunistic proliferation of the species. The resulting damage caused to the trees on which <b>it</b> <b>feeds</b> may be considered significant.|$|E
50|$|<b>Its</b> <b>feeding</b> {{sites on}} plants are flower buds, flowers and young pods. In some cases early instars feed on flower peduncles and young stems.|$|R

50|$|<b>It</b> {{typically}} <b>feeds</b> on dung, {{but also}} carrion and decaying fungi. <b>It</b> mainly <b>feeds</b> on human dung, but also dog, cattle, horse, goat, sheep and pig dung.|$|R
5|$|Its {{impedance}} is 1.8ohms at 20kHz, to over 60ohms at 150Hz, and its load {{is highly}} capacitive. It does not consume {{large amounts of}} power so much as <b>it</b> <b>feeds</b> {{it back to the}} amplifier in opposition at some points during each cycle. This is very demanding on amplifiers' stability.|$|E
5|$|This widely {{distributed}} neritid snail species occurs from Europe to Central Asia. It has a thick shell with a calcified operculum. The coloration {{pattern on the}} shell is very variable. Theodoxus fluviatilis lives in freshwater and in brackish water, in rivers and lakes on stones. <b>It</b> <b>feeds</b> mainly by grazing on biofilms and diatoms.|$|E
5|$|Adults have neutral grey heads, brown necks, brown-sepia striped backs, and grey-white bellies, breasts, and throats. Males {{have some}} buff {{markings}} on their breasts, and less sharp brown spots on their napes than females. The Perijá tapaculo is a secretive bird and therefore difficult to observe; {{as a result}} its ecology is poorly known. <b>It</b> <b>feeds</b> on insects and reproduces between April and July. Its range is partially within Chamicero de Perijá Bird Reserve in Colombia and the Sierra de Perijá National Park in Venezuela.|$|E
50|$|The larvae feed on Dacrydium and Podocarpus species. The {{adult is}} day-flying. <b>It</b> <b>feed</b> on the nectar flowers of Leptospermum flavescens in the {{mountains}} of Peninsular Malaysia.|$|R
50|$|The females {{lay their}} eggs into leaf litter {{substrate}} and rotten wood. Larvae build their cave system and stay inside <b>it,</b> <b>feeding</b> for several years on rotting wood.|$|R
50|$|Viskeon: Huge, muscled {{humanoid}} creatures, when part {{of their}} body is cut off, a fetus forms from <b>it,</b> <b>feeding</b> off its nutrients to eventually become a fully formed Viskeon.|$|R
5|$|C. longimanus feeds {{mainly on}} pelagic {{cephalopods}} and bony fish. However, its diet can {{be far more}} varied and less selectiveit is known to eat threadfins, stingrays, sea turtles, birds, gastropods, crustaceans, and mammalian carrion. The bony fish <b>it</b> <b>feeds</b> on include lancetfish, oarfish, barracuda, jacks, dolphinfish, marlin, tuna, and mackerel. Its feeding methods include biting into groups of fish and swimming through schools of tuna with an open mouth. When feeding with other species, it becomes aggressive. Peter Benchley, author of Jaws, observed this shark swimming among pilot whales and eating their faeces.|$|E
5|$|Inhabiting {{continental}} {{margins and}} oceanic waters at depths of , the {{bigeye sand tiger}} may make vertical and horizontal migratory movements. <b>It</b> <b>feeds</b> on bony fishes and squid, and its sizable eyes and dark coloration suggest that it may spend most of its time in the mesopelagic zone. Reproduction is probably viviparous with oophagous embryos like in other mackerel shark species. This shark is caught incidentally by commercial fisheries, though so infrequently that the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) cannot yet determine its conservation status.|$|E
5|$|Its {{inaccessible}} {{habitat and}} retiring nature {{mean that the}} snoring rail is rarely seen and little is known of its behaviour. Only the adult plumage has been described, and the breeding behaviour is unrecorded. <b>It</b> <b>feeds</b> on small crabs and probably other small prey such as lizards. Although protected under Indonesian law since 1972, the rail is threatened by habitat loss (even within nature reserves), hunting for food and predation by introduced species; it is therefore evaluated as Vulnerable on the IUCN Red List of Threatened Species.|$|E
50|$|<b>It</b> {{typically}} <b>feeds</b> in flocks, foraging on {{the ground}} or amongst low vegetation. <b>It</b> mainly <b>feeds</b> on seeds such as those of weeds, grasses and figs. <b>It</b> also <b>feeds</b> on other plant material and small insects. It has also been found that canaries need gravity to swallow, thus leading to death from dehydration in zero gravity conditions such as space.|$|R
5000|$|This species {{lives on}} rocks {{very high in}} the {{intertidal}} zone. [...] It can tolerate a lot of sun. Feeding is primarily nocturnal. <b>It</b> <b>feed</b> on several species of algae.|$|R

5|$|Leotia lubrica favours damp {{deciduous}} woodland, but {{can also}} be found under conifers. Particular favoured habitats include path sides and underneath bracken, while favoured substrates include soil, moss and plant waste, where <b>it</b> <b>feeds</b> as a saprotroph. Fruit bodies are typically encountered from late summer to late autumn in Europe, and from late spring to autumn in North America, where it is the most common Leotia species. It has also been recorded in eastern Asia, in China and Tibet, as well as in New Zealand and Australia.|$|E
5|$|Like most Old World warblers, {{this small}} species is insectivorous, moving restlessly though foliage or briefly hovering. It has been {{recorded}} as taking insects, mainly flies, from more than 50 families, along with other small and medium-sized invertebrates. It will take the eggs and larvae of butterflies and moths, particularly those of the winter moth. The chiffchaff has been estimated to require about one-third of its weight in insects daily, and <b>it</b> <b>feeds</b> almost continuously in the autumn to put on extra fat as fuel for the long migration flight.|$|E
5|$|Like {{other members}} of its family, the onefin {{electric}} ray can defend itself with a strong electric shock produced {{from a pair of}} kidney-shaped electric organs beside its head. <b>It</b> <b>feeds</b> mainly on polychaete worms, and likely gives birth to live young. The International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) presently lacks enough information to assess the conservation status of this species. It is often caught incidentally by bottom trawl fisheries off South Africa, and may also be impacted by pollution from coastal development.|$|E

6000|$|... "I'm {{looking for}} the cause of <b>it.</b> <b>It's</b> <b>feeding,</b> Billy. <b>It's</b> port and stimulants where there is no scope for action. It's idleness. I begin to see now how much fatter you are, how much coarser." ...|$|R
50|$|<b>Its</b> <b>feeding</b> style {{consists}} of a side-to-side movement of the bill as the bird walks forward with its head down. This species nests in June-July on coastal areas in the tundra, choosing locations with grass close to freshwater pools.|$|R
5|$|Meanwhile, H.A.R.M. starts infecting {{and killing}} {{innocent}} people using Dr. Schenker's biological explosive development. The chemical is {{injected into the}} living host, and <b>it</b> <b>feeds</b> on organic material until it culminates in a massive explosion. H.A.R.M. states that if their ransom demands are not met, {{they will continue to}} use human time bombs to cause destruction around the world. Cate embarks on a train ride to Washington State, where Dr. Schenker is believed to be located. Cate finds him and manages to escort him to safety using an underground base.|$|E
5|$|Millepora alcicornis, or sea ginger, is {{a species}} of colonial fire coral with a {{calcareous}} skeleton. It is found on shallow water coral reefs in the tropical west Atlantic Ocean. It shows {{a variety of different}} morphologies depending on its location. <b>It</b> <b>feeds</b> on plankton and derives part of its energy requirements from microalgae found within its tissues. It is an important member of the reef building community and subject to the same threats as other corals. It can cause painful stings to unwary divers.|$|E
5|$|Phellinus ellipsoideus {{has been}} {{recorded}} growing on the fallen wood of oaks of the subgenus Cyclobalanopsis, {{as well as the}} wood of other flowering plants. The species favours the trunks of trees, where <b>it</b> <b>feeds</b> as a saprotroph, causing white rot. P.ellipsoideus fruit bodies are perennial growers, allowing them to, in the correct circumstances, grow very large. The species is found in the tropical and subtropical areas of China; it {{has been recorded}} in Fujian Province and Hainan Province. It is not a common species, and fruit bodies are only occasionally encountered.|$|E
50|$|In {{greyhound}} racing, {{a trainer}} prepares a greyhound for races, {{with responsibility for}} exercising <b>it,</b> <b>feeding</b> <b>it,</b> getting it race-ready and determining which races it should enter. In {{the majority of cases}} they train the greyhound for an owner and look after the greyhound 24/7 at their race kennels. Greyhound trainers charge the owner a kennel fee for training the greyhound. Prize money goes to the owner.|$|R
50|$|The {{white-faced ibis}} eats {{a variety of}} organisms, {{including}} many invertebrates such as insects, leeches, snails and earthworms. It may also eat vertebrates such as fish, crayfish, newts, and frogs. <b>Its</b> <b>feeding</b> style is to use its bill to probe for prey.|$|R
50|$|Stigmella floslactella {{occurs in}} Ireland {{where it is}} known to feed on various {{hornbeam}} and hazel species, including Corylus advenella.

5|$|Some {{intraspecific}} brood parasitism occurs, and {{instances of}} unusually {{large numbers of}} eggs in a nest {{may be the result}} of females laying eggs in the nests of their neighbours. Such foreign eggs are sometimes recognised and ejected by females. The house sparrow is a victim of interspecific brood parasites, but only rarely, since it usually uses nests in holes too small for parasites to enter, and <b>it</b> <b>feeds</b> its young foods unsuitable for young parasites. In turn, the house sparrow has once been recorded as a brood parasite of the American cliff swallow.|$|E
5|$|The American {{black duck}} is an {{omnivorous}} species with a diverse diet. <b>It</b> <b>feeds</b> by dabbling {{in shallow water}} and grazing on land. Its plant diet primarily includes {{a wide variety of}} wetland grasses and sedges, and the seeds, stems, leaves and root stalks of aquatic plants, such as eelgrass, pondweed and smartweed. Its animal diet includes mollusks, snails, amphipods, insects, mussels and small fishes.|$|E
