40|$|This paper {{investigates the}} {{potential}} use of lower <b>grade</b> <b>coals</b> in an IGCC-CCS plant that generates electricity and produces hydrogen simultaneously with {{carbon dioxide capture}} and storage. The paper underlines {{one of the main}} advantages of gasification technology, namely the possibility to process lower <b>grade</b> <b>coals,</b> which are more widely available than the high <b>grade</b> <b>coals</b> normally used in European power plants. Based on a proposed plant concept that generates about 400 MW net electricity with a flexible output of 0 - 50 MWth hydrogen and a carbon capture rate of at least 90 %, the paper develops fuel selection criteria for coal fluxing and blending of various types of coal for optimizing plant performance e. g. oxygen consumption, hydrogen production potential, specific syngas energy production per tonne of oxygen consumed, etc. These performance indicators were calculated for a number of case studies through process flow simulations. The main conclusion is that blending of coal types of high and lower grade is more beneficial in terms of operation and cost performance than fluxing high <b>grade</b> <b>coals.</b> JRC.

40|$|Large {{amounts of}} waste fi ne coals are very diffi cult {{to be treated}} due to the {{presence}} of ash and inorganic sulphur compounds. In order to use waste fi ne coal effi ciently, a retrieval technique is necessary for the recov-ery of combustible contents of coal from fi ne waste coals. Nowadays, a fl otation process has been used for the treatment, but it is impractical for developing countries due to its higher costs. Therefore, oil agglomera-tion process has been used to deal with these problems. In this study, the factors affecting the coal cleaning effi ciency of the oil agglomeration process were investigated with the element contents and chemical structure of three different <b>grade</b> <b>coals.</b> Chemical contents in three different <b>grade</b> <b>coals</b> were determined by proximate and ultimate analyses and the differences in chemical structure of carbonaceous contents of different <b>grade</b> <b>coals</b> were investigated by a Fourier transform-infrared spectrometry. In free coals or their mixed samples, the ratio of ash and carbonaceous contents were maintained to make it homogeneous. From the results of oil agglomeration experiments, it was concluded that the characteristics of agglomerate and the coal cleaning effi ciency of oil agglomeration were not only infl uenced by the type of oils but also by the oxygen contents and the aromatic and aliphatic chemical structures in different <b>grade</b> <b>coals.</b> The oxygenic functional groups of carbonaceous contents in coal samples prevented oil from attaching the carbonaceous surface and form th...|$|R

30|$|Low <b>grade</b> high ash <b>coals</b> with {{difficult}} physical washability characteristics require chemical cleaning {{techniques such as}} solvent extraction to obtain super clean coal with lower ash contents. Kedla, an Indian low <b>grade</b> <b>coal</b> has ash content around 44 %– 50 % {{and there is a}} need to maximize its solvent extraction yield so as to make this power <b>grade</b> <b>coal</b> industrially useful. This paper highlights the use of definitive screening design and response surface methodology to extract the maximum organic matter from Kedla coal using ethylenediammine (EDA) and N-methyl pyrollidone (NMP) as solvents under mild atmospheric pressure conditions. The coal was pre-treated with acetic acid before extractions were carried out. The parameters such as the acid pre-treatment time, acid concentration, particle size, the co-solvent concentration and the solvent concentration were optimized in this paper. With this design of experiments technique about 40 % of the organic matter with minimal ash (less than 2 %) content was rendered extractable unlike the already postulated designer solvent system—e, N system (i.e. NMP containing small amount of EDA) that uses coal to solvent ratio as 1 : 17 (wt/vol) and coal to co-solvent ratio as 1 : 1 (wt/vol) thus only giving 19 % extraction yield. Therefore, the present design of experiments technique helps in conserving the number of experiments for process intensification.|$|R
