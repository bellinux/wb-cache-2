30|$|In a {{functional}} magnetic resolution imaging (fMRI) study {{of patients with}} implants, it was demonstrated that punctate mechanical stimulation of oral implants activates both primary and secondary cortical somatosensory areas and was suggested that brain plasticity occurs when extracted teeth are replaced by endosseous implants [28]. In another fMRI study, {{it was suggested that}} the time after tooth extraction may affect neural plasticity, which in turn can influence osseoperception, with the amount of time possibly being an indicator for prosthetic treatment planning [23]. The lack of peripheral feedback mechanisms in patients with implant-supported full fixed prostheses may lead to a lack of control over the biting force [3, 29]. Such control is needed for refinement and control of the biting force for various types of food [7, 30 – 32]. While patients with <b>implant-supported</b> <b>bridges</b> are able to bite food with varying levels of hardness, it could be questioned whether they are able to differentiate between the hardness variations and thus apply an adapted chewing pattern [33]. Although some studies have demonstrated the tactile function of patients with oral implants [18, 19], the perception of food hardness is yet another sensory function that should be evaluated in order to obtain more information on modulation and masticatory adaptation. However, there have been few studies on this issue. Although adaptation to food texture during mastication by dentate subjects has been tested [34], it has not yet been followed up in patients receiving implant placement. In a recent cross-sectional study, mastication adaptability in patients with <b>implant-supported</b> <b>bridges</b> was assessed with soft and hard food models using an electromyogram (EMG) [7]. Patients with implants showed a significantly weaker increase in EMG activity with increased food hardness. In addition, muscular work performance (bite-force ratio and muscle activity) was found to be lower in patients with implants [35]. Furthermore, less coordinated masticatory muscle activity was found in patients with implant-supported prostheses [36].|$|R

40|$|In {{order to}} control oral motor behavior, such as biting and chewing, {{we rely on}} {{information}} provided {{by a variety of}} sense organs, including periodontal mechanoreceptors (PMRs). The PMRs, located among the collagen fibers in the periodontal ligament that attaches the root of the tooth to the alveolar bone, send signals to the central nervous system when the surrounding collagen fibers are stretched by loading of the tooth. The information they provide is particularly important for sensorimotor regulation of the forces exerted during manipulative actions in mastication. Various types of dental status and treatment might affect the functioning of these receptors. For example, reduction of support by periodontal tissue is associated with a {{decrease in the number of}} PMRs, as well as enhanced mobility of the tooth. Connecting several teeth together with fixed bridges attenuates the mobility of each tooth and individuals with <b>implant-supported</b> <b>bridges</b> lack PMRs. The general aim of the work presented here has been to improve our understanding of the role played by PMRs in regulation of normal jaw function and to elucidate how disturbance of the sensory information they provide, by disease or dental treatment, influences masticatory behavior. In this latter context special focus was directed towards prosthetic treatments, i. e., tooth- and <b>implant-supported</b> fixed <b>bridges.</b> The subjects performed two motor behavioral tasks – a hold-and-split task (Study I-IV) and a novel manipulation-and-split task (Study V). In the first of these, holding and splitting morsels of food of differing hardness between the teeth was employed to examine the regulation of small holding forces and of the rate of increase in bite force during the split (the “split force rate”). The participants were instructed to hold the morsel (a piece of peanut or biscuit) between their teeth and not use more force than necessary to control it and then, approximately 3 - 4 seconds later, to split the morsel. In the latter task, motor behavior during food manipulation and the accuracy of the split were evaluated. These participants placed a spherical piece of candy in their mouth, moved it thereafter with their tongue to a position between their front teeth and finally attempted split it into two equal sized parts. Custom-made equipment was used to monitor changes in bite forces, jaw movements and muscle activity with time during these tasks. VI The holding forces exerted by individuals with reduced support from periodontal tissue were almost 3 -fold higher and more variable than those exerted by the healthy matched controls (Study I). In Study II, where different types of teeth were used to perform the same task, the holding force increased distally along the dental arch, being almost 3 - fold higher for the molars than the incisors. Application of a local anesthetic to the teeth to block the sensory signals from the PMRs resulted in an approximately 2 - 3. 5 -fold elevation in holding forces (Studies II and III). In Study IV individuals with tooth- or <b>implant-supported</b> <b>bridges</b> were found to use holding forces approximately 2 - and 2. 5 - fold higher, respectively, than the control subjects with natural teeth. Although the splitting forces where the same for all of the groups, the rate at which this force was generated was higher when splitting harder food if periodontal sensibility was normal (Studies III and IV), an adaptation that was eliminated by periodontal anesthesia (Study III). This adaptation was also attenuated in periodontally affected individuals (Study I), as well as in the participants with tooth- or implant supported bridges (Study IV). In connection with the manipulation-and-split task the latter two groups demonstrated altered motor behavior, with a shorter contact phase prior to the split and a lower capacity than the dentated control group to split the candy into two equal parts (Study V). The present findings demonstrate that sensory signals from PMRs play an important role in fine-tuning the amplitude and direction of bite forces during actions such as positioning and holding food between the teeth for biting. Furthermore, adjustment of the rate of increase in bite force to the hardness of food is carried out by individuals in whom this signaling is intact. In individuals with disturbed PMR signaling due to loss of support by periodontal tissue or bimaxillary full-arch splinting of the teeth (toothsupported bridges) and in those lacking PMRs (i. e., with bimaxillary <b>implant-supported</b> <b>bridges),</b> regulation of these oral sensorimotor functions is impaired...|$|R
40|$|Implant-supported fixed restorations {{are widely}} used in {{practice}} {{with the aim of}} prosthetic rehabilitation of edentulous patients; however, in Ukraine, the aforementioned methods are currently not completely lawful due to the absence of departmental standards of time needed for orthopedists to manufacture such types of dentures. In prosthetic dentistry, labor inputs are determined based on the average standard working time for professionals that not always correspond to the actual time expenditures which must be taken into consideration when determining the appropriate units of labor input.   The objective of the research was to determine the units of labor input of orthopediststo manufacture implant-supported fixed restorations. Materials and methods.  The object of the research involved clinical processes of manufacturing implant-supported fixed restorations. The units of labor input were determined based on the average time standards obtained in the result of timing measurements of clinical processes of providing appropriate care. The conversion of the obtained time standards (TS) to the units of labor input (ULI) was performed according to the formula: ULI = Tts / T 1 uli Results and discussion.  Clinical processes of manufacturing 69 single implant-supported restorations by 15 orthopedists were studied. There were manufactured 13 crowns with screw-retained solid abutments, 21 crowns with screw-retained abutments, 17 single abutments, 18 screw-retained crowns with burn-out plastic abutments or abutments with a platform for attaching and pressing. In addition, the work of 18 orthopedists who manufactured 30 <b>implant-supported</b> <b>bridges</b> including 8 prosthetic dentures with screw-retained solid abutments, 10 prosthetic dentures with screw-retained abutments, 12 screw-retained dentures with burn-out plastic abutments or abutments with a platform for attaching and pressing was investigated and timed. The results of the research showed that the initial values of the labor input indicators when manufacturing single implant-supported fixed restorations were within the range of 1. 5 - 1. 5 ULI (the average values) and 3. 3 - 3. 5 ULI (the actual values) depending on the prosthetic construction.

40|$|Backgrund: Prosthetic {{rehabilitation}} of the edentulous patient with <b>implant-supported</b> <b>bridges</b> is today a routine and predictable treatment modality. The original protocol prescribed a healing period of 3 to 6 months prior to loading {{which means that the}} total treatment time can be extensive and that the patients often need to wear removable provisional prostheses during healing and treatment. The use of immediate implant loading protocols would significantly reduce treatment time. Aims: The aim of this thesis was to clinically and radiographically evaluate different protocols for immediate loading of dental implants with regard to implant survival and marginal bone resorption. Material & Methods: Paper I. The use of provisional implants (PIs) for support of a fixed temporary bridge during the healing of permanent implants was evaluated in 45 patients with either partially (19 patients) or totally (26 patients) edentulous maxillae. The patients were followed from implant surgery to abutment connection of the permanent implants. Paper II. The primary implant stability of 905 implants in 267 consecutive patients treated with implant-supported fixed prostheses was assessed using resonance frequency analysis (RFA) measurements (implants stability quations, ISQ) at implant placement surgery. The results were correlated with parameters related to the patient, implant site and the implant components. Paper III. A total of 96 patients were evaluated for immediate loading of <b>implant-supported</b> <b>bridges</b> in the posterior mandible (insertion torque > 30 Ncm, ISQ > 60). 77 patients (85 %) met with the criteria and a total of 257 implants were placed, 77 with a turned and minimally rough surface and 180 with an oxidized and moderately rough surface. A total of 111 FPDs were made. The bridges were supported by one implant and tooth or were freestanding constructions supported by 2, 3 or 4 implants. The patients were followed for at least one year with clinical and radiographic examinations. Paper IV. Twenty (20) patients treated with immediately loaded <b>implant-supported</b> <b>bridges</b> in the edentulous maxilla participated in the study group. Inclusion criteria for immediate loading were a minimum insertion torque of 30 Ncm and an implant stability value of 60 ISQ for the two posterior fixtures and a total sum of 200 (mean ISQ 50) for the four anterior fixtures was required. A group of 20 patients previously treated with <b>implant-supported</b> <b>bridges</b> in the maxilla by the same team following a two-stage protocol was used as a reference group. The patients were followed for one year with clinical and radiographic examinations. Paper V. A total of 115 one-piece implants (OPIs) with a moderately rough surface all the way up through the mocosa, were placed in 48 patients for immediate loading of single crowns and partial bridges in the mandible and the maxilla. A group of 97 patients previously treated by the same team under identical conditions with 380 two-piece implants (TPIs) for immediate loading was used as a control group. The patients were followed for one year with clinical and radiographic examinations. Results: Paper I. Seven (3. 6 %) PIs failed owing to infection or pain during the observation period and were removed. Seventeen (9 %) of 192 provisional implants showed mobility at the second-stage surgery, although they had served as support for the provisional bridge without clinical symptoms during the follow-up time. Five (2. 2 %) of the 230 permanent implants placed did not integrate and were subsequently removed at the second-stage surgery. Paper II. The mean primary stability for the 905 implants was 67. 4 ISQ (SD 8. 6) where 582 (64. 3 %) showed an ISQ value of 65 or higher and 761 (84. 1 %) implants an ISQ value of 60 or higher. Male patients showed higher ISQ values than females, mandibular implants were more stable than maxillary ones. Implants placed in posterior regions were more stable than in anterior sites, wide platform implants were more stable than regular/narrow platform ones. There was a correlation between bone quality and primary stability, with lower ISQ values with softer bone. A lower stability was seen with increased implant length. Paper III. A total of four (1. 6 %) of the 257 implants placed did not integrate and were subsequently removed. The overall cumulative survival rate was 98. 4 % after 1 year follow-up, 96. 1 % and 99. 4 % for turned and oxidized implants, respectively. The average bone loss was 0. 7 (S. D. 0. 8) mm after one year of follow-up. Paper IV. One (0. 8 %) of 123 immediately loaded implants placed did not integrate. In the control group, no implants were lost. The overall cumulative survival rates after 1 year were 99. 2 % for the study group and 100 % for the reference group. The mean change of marginal bone level was 0. 78 mm (SD 0. 90 mm) for immediately loaded implants and 0. 91 mm (SD 1. 04 mm) for reference group implants. The differences were not significantly different. Paper V. Six OPIs (5. 2 %) were removed during the follow -up period because of extensive bone resorption and subsequent soft tissue problems. After 1 year, the mean marginal bone loss was 2. 1 mm (SD 1. 3) for OPIs and 0. 8 mm (SD 1) for TPIs. 20 % of OPIs showed more than 3 mm of bone loss compared with 0. 6 % for TPIs. When compensating for vertical placement depth, OPIs still showed a lower marginal bone level and thus more exposed threads than TPIs. Depending on the criteria used, the success rate for OPIs was 46. 1 % or 72. 2 % compared with 85 % or 91. 6 % for TPIs. Conclusion: It is concluded that immediate loading of two-piece dental implants results in good clinical outcomes if high primary stability is achieved and a rigid splinting with well controlled occlusion is applied. Provisional implants can be used as support of a provisional bridge during submerged healing of permanent two-piece implants. Moreover, it is concluded that one-piece implants show more bone resorption and higher failure rates than two-piece implants after one year in function.

Impact {{forces in}} implant {{supported}} FDP (fixed dental prosthesis) {{are higher than}} that of tooth supported FDPs and the compositions used in frameworks also has a paramount role for biomechanical reasons. The aim {{of this study was to}} evaluate the flexural strength of two different zirconia frameworks. MATERIALS AND METHODS. Two implant abutments with 3. 8 mm and 4. 5 mm platform were used as premolar and molar. They were mounted vertically in an acrylic resin block. A model with steel retainers and removable abutments was fabricated by milling machine; and 10 FDP frameworks were fabricated for each Biodenta and Cercon systems. All samples were thermo-cycled for 2000 times in 5 - 55 ˚C temperature and embedded in 37 ˚C artificial saliva for one week. The flexural test was done by a rod with 2 mm ending diameter which was applied to the multi-electromechanical machine. The force was inserted until observing fracture. The collected data were analyzed with SPSS software ver. 15, using Weibull modulus and independent t-test with the level of significance at α=. 05. RESULTS. The mean load bearing capacity values were higher in Biodenta but with no significant differences (P>. 05). The Biodenta frameworks showed higher load bearing capacity (F 0 = 1700) than Cercon frameworks (F 0 = 1520) but the reliability (m) was higher in Cercon (m= 7. 5). CONCLUSION.

40|$|In use, {{since the}} 1960 ´s, dental {{implants}} {{have been reported}} to allow chewing that is as efficient as with natural dentition. However, input from periodontal mechanoreceptors (PMRs) around the tooth is important for sensorimotor regulation of biting and chewing. Since there is no periodontal ligament between osseointegrated implants and the alveolar bone, there are no mechanoreceptors in close proximity and, consequently, for individuals with such implants the sensory information sent to the central nervous system concerning chewing forces should be different than with natural teeth. The present thesis was designed to characterize the regulation of mastication in individuals with bimaxillary <b>implant-supported</b> <b>bridges</b> and to compare this to chewing with natural teeth, in order to gain new insights into the role of PMRs in this connection. In the first study participants with natural dentition or fixed bimaxillary implant-supported prostheses chewed and swallowed two model foods of differing hardness while the electromyographic activity of the jaw-closing muscles and the position of the mandible were monitored. Those with implants exhibited impaired sensory-motor regulation during chewing, with less elevation of jaw muscle activity in response to hard food and attenuated adaptation of this activity as the masticatory sequence progressed. Next, we characterized the temporal profile of masseter muscle activity during natural chewing by young adults and the influence of food hardness on this profile. The excitatory drive of the masseter muscle was found to be biphasic, demonstrating an early component prior to tooth-food contact and a late component during this contact. To test our hypothesis that sensory input from the PMRs is required to achieve this later increase we finally investigated the effects of the absence of sensory input from PMRs in subjects with fixed bimaxillary implant-supported prostheses on activation of the masseter muscle during the jaw-closing phase of a chewing cycle. Dentate participants exhibited a biphasic muscle drive during jaw-closing and throughout the masticatory sequence, with a component that starts just before the jaw-closing phase and is based on information from preceding chewing cycles, with no need for input from PMRs; and a late component that starts upon contact with the food, which is signaled by the PMRs. In contrast, participants with dental implants showed no such biphasic drive {{in the beginning of the}} masticatory sequence. Adaptation of muscle activity during jaw-closing by the latter appeared to involve modifying the rate of the early component; while the more pronounced adaptation by dentate individuals seemed to reflect additional modification of the late, post-contact component, presumably in response to signals from the PMRs. However, later during the masticatory sequence, implant participants did show a biphasic drive during jaw-closing, probably achieved by prediction based on the gradually changing properties of the bolus during chewing. Moreover, the temporal profile of muscle activity during chewing was the same regardless of the hardness of the food. In conclusion, sensory information provided by the PMRs appears to be most critical during the beginning of the masticatory sequence, when initial food contact occurs, whereas prediction of food properties based on information from other mechanoreceptors is utilized more effectively later on...|$|R

Forty patients (20 males and 20 females, mean age = 42. 7 ± 9. 6 years) with an implant-supported fixed prosthetic rehabilitation on one side and dentate on the other side were recruited into this study. Participants' MBF were measured bilaterally at the first molar region using a digital hydraulic occlusal force gauge (GM 10). The measurements were repeated three times (with 45 s intervals between times) for each side, and the highest value of the bite force (MBF) was recorded for each side. The mean MBF was 577. 9 N at the implant-supported prosthesis side and 595. 1 N at the dentate side. The average MBF was higher at the dentulous side (P < 0. 05). Maximum occlusal bite force was higher in males and participants with higher weight and height. However, BMI was not significantly related to MBF values.

50|$|In primary occlusal trauma, the cause, of the {{mobility}} was the excessive force being {{applied to a}} tooth with a normal attachment apparatus, otherwise known as a periodontally-uninvolved tooth.

This could involve removing a high spot on a recently restored tooth, or even a high spot on a non-recently restored tooth that perhaps moved into hyperocclusion. It could also involved altering one's parafunctional habits, such as refraining from chewing on pens or biting one's fingernails. For a bruxer, treatment of the patient's primary occlusal trauma could involve selective grinding of certain interarch tooth contacts or perhaps employing a nightguard to protect the teeth from the greater than normal occlusal forces of the patient's parafunctional habit.

40|$|Introduction: A dental {{impression}} {{is a negative}} imprint of an oral structure {{that can be used}} to produce a positive cast of a patient's teeth as a permanent record. The accuracy of the impression affects the accuracy of the cast, and a precise impression is needed in order to create prosthesis with optimal fitting. Minimization of misfit is an important aim in prosthesis science and dental implants. The aim of this study was to evaluate the effects of the materials and techniques used to take an impression on the vertical misfit of <b>implant-supported,</b> screw-retained, three-unit <b>bridges.</b> Materials and Methods: The principal model used was an acrylic block with two ITI implants. A 1. 5 -mm abutment was attached to fixtures with torque of 25 N. cm. A base-metal framework was built on the abutment in the acrylic block. The abutments of the acrylic model were unscrewed and fixture-level impressions were made. The impression techniques included open/closed-tray techniques and the impression materials were polyether and polyvinyl siloxane. Forty acrylic custom trays were built for each impression. The marginal gap in the framework at three points (buccal, lingual, and distal) was measured using an optical microscope with × 250. Results: It is demonstrated that in all 360 evaluated samples, the mean vertical misfit in polyether samples of molar and premolar teeth was significantly lower than in polyvinyl siloxane (P < 0. 001 and P = 0. 017, respectively) in all three locations of the molar and lingual premolar examined (buccal, lingual, and distal), the mean vertical misfit of the polyether samples was significantly lower than those of polyvinyl siloxane (P < 0. 01). On the other hand, although the mean vertical misfit using the open-tray technique in the molar teeth was significantly lower than with the closed-tray method (P = 0. 002), no statistical difference was seen between the open-tray and closed-tray technique in general (P = 0. 87). Conclusion: Within the limitations of this study, the following conclusions can be drawn: The impression method had no effect on marginal discrepancy of 3 -unit screw retained fixed partial dentures. A higher marginal accuracy was obtained using polyether impression material compared to polyvinyl siloxane...|$|R
