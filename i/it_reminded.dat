5|$|In 1790, Manuel Quimper of the Spanish Navy {{set sail}} from Nootka, a {{temporary}} settlement on Vancouver Island, with orders {{to explore the}} newly discovered Strait of Juan de Fuca. Accompanying Quimper was first-pilot Gonzalo Lopez de Haro, who drew detailed charts during the six-week expedition. Although Quimper's journal of the voyage does not refer to the mountain, one of Haro's manuscript charts includes a sketch of Mount Baker. The Spanish named the snowy volcano , as <b>it</b> <b>reminded</b> them of the white-clad monks of the Carmelite Monastery.|$|E
5|$|It's {{definitely}} riskier {{than something}} a bit more... simple. I {{just heard the}} track and loved {{that it was so}} different: it felt a bit African, a bit electronic and futuristic. <b>It</b> <b>reminded</b> me of what I love, which is mixing different cultures and eras — things that typically don't go together — to create a new sound. I can never be safe; I always try and go against the grain. As soon as I accomplish one thing, I just set a higher goal. That's how I've gotten to where I am.|$|E
5|$|The role of Lord W. C. Jackson {{was portrayed}} by C. R. Parthiban, while M. R. Santhanam played the minister, Thanapathi Sivasubramaniam Pillai. Kattabomman's {{daughter}} in the film, Meena, was a fictional character created by Krishnasamy. She was based on Krishnasamy's own daughter, Mynavathi, who {{died when she was}} five years old. Krishnasamy initially refused to include the scene involving Meena's death as <b>it</b> <b>reminded</b> him of his daughter, but finally did so reluctantly. The character was played by Baby Kanchana.|$|E

5|$|After his expulsion, Soedjatmoko {{moved to}} Surakarta and studied Western history and {{political}} literature, {{which led to}} an interest in socialism. Some figure that affected him besides Karl Marx were Ortega y Gasset and Jan Romein. While in Surakarta he also worked at his father's hospital. After Indonesia proclaimed its independence, Soedjatmoko was asked to become Deputy Head of the Foreign Press Department in the Ministry of Information. In 1946, {{at the request of}} Prime Minister Sjahrir, he and two friends established a Dutch-language weekly, Het Inzicht (Inside), as a counter to the Dutch-sponsored Het Uίtzicht (Outlook). The next year, they launched a socialist-oriented journal, Siasat (Tactics), which was published weekly. During this period Soedjatmoko dropped the name Mangoendiningrat, as <b>it</b> <b>reminded</b> him of the feudal aspects of Indonesian culture.|$|E
5|$|Editor Vanessa Whitburn told Chris Arnot of The Independent {{that the}} climax to the storyline was planned three {{months prior to}} the show's anniversary. When Ruth listened to a {{voicemail}} from her daughter, <b>it</b> <b>reminded</b> her of home and she called Sam to say she could not be with him. Ruth then turned to Usha for support, before returning home to David, who observed Ruth's emotional state. After Sam quit his job, Ruth eventually told David the truth about what happened. Bentinck explained that when he and Finch finished recording the scene, they were both crying as it had been very distressing. David was initially unable to forgive Ruth for her actions, but after speaking to Usha and gaining some perspective, over time things between himself and Ruth became easier.|$|E
5|$|After departing New Richmond, {{the tornado}} moved {{on toward the}} northeast, {{continuing}} along a course almost parallel to the Omaha Railroad line, with most of its destruction after that point confined to rural areas, with only two fatalities occurring north of town. The tornado struck several farms in the Stanton area, passing barely a mile north of the village of Deer Park before crossing into Polk County. The storm came within two miles of the village of Clear Lake, {{proving to be a}} great scare for its residents as <b>it</b> <b>reminded</b> many of a similar tornado which struck Clear Lake in September 1884. A large number of farms in the area suffered considerable damage, and many families were left homeless. One farmer, Sam Olson was killed instantly when the tornado flattened his farmstead, leaving his wife and son gravely injured. Northeast of Clear Lake, the tornado tore through the logging community of Pineville, where another farmer, Michael Kennetz, was killed when his home was swept away. Several homes and farms {{in the vicinity of the}} hamlet of Richardson and the village of Clayton were blown away, leaving several families destitute. The storm continued east into Barron County, where the farming community of Arland sustained a direct hit, with virtually the entire settlement being demolished, but no fatalities or serious injuries being reported. The tornado dissipated a few miles southwest of the city of Barron, although the storm was still strong enough to cause a considerable amount of damage to the town.|$|E

In a subsequent article for The Guardian he elaborated upon {{his reaction to}} learning about being considered for the award and his reasons for rejecting it: [...] "Me? I thought, OBE me? Up yours, I thought.

25|$|Trolley is an American word {{derived from}} the {{electric}} current pickup mechanism in early systems. The first successful electric streetcars in the United States used a system devised by Frank J. Sprague, in which a spring-loaded trolley pole pushed a small trolley wheel up against an overhead wire to collect electricity for the motors. Although not the first overhead collection system, it was far more reliable than its predecessors, and eventually became used by almost all streetcars. Some authorities believe that the vehicle became known as a trolley car because <b>it</b> <b>reminded</b> people (particularly on the West Coast) of a boat trolling for fish. Others believe it derived from a dialect word for a wheeled cart.|$|E
25|$|Interest in and {{the study}} of Amazon dark earths was {{advanced}} with the work of Wim Sombroek. Sombroek's interest in soil fertility came from his childhood. He was born in the Netherlands and lived through the Dutch famine of 1944. His family subsided on a small plot of land that had been maintained and improved for generations. Sombroek's father, in turn, improved the land by sowing it with the ash and cinders from their home. Sombroek came across Terra preta in the 1950s and <b>it</b> <b>reminded</b> him of the soil from his childhood, inspiring him to study it further. Soil biologist from the University of Kansas William W. Woods is also a major figure in Terra preta research. Woods has made several key discoveries and his comprehensive bibliography on the subject doubles in size every decade.|$|E
25|$|After {{the bike}} shop closes, Mark decides {{to move to}} Minnesota. Becky decides to go with him, and they elope. Jackie and Roseanne each get a check for $10,000 from their mother after she and their father divorce. They, along with Nancy, decide to open a diner but can only get the money they need after Bev agrees to become a partner as well. Nancy comes out as a lesbian. The Tildens, a single father and his two daughters around Becky and Darlene's ages (Wings Hauser, Mara Hobel, Danielle Harris), move in next door. Jackie dates Fisher (Matt Roth), a much younger man. When Roseanne discovers he is {{physically}} abusive, Dan confronts him, beats him up, and is arrested. Roseanne and Jackie's father dies, and Roseanne confronts his longtime secret mistress only to find her father blamed his daughters for his abuse towards them. Roseanne's rich, estranged cousin Ronnie (Joan Collins) visits and persuades Darlene to get her GED and apply to art school. David applies as well. Darlene asks her parents if David can move in, because his mother is moving away {{and they want to}} stay together. Roseanne and Dan initially refuse, but when Roseanne sees David's mother being verbally and emotionally abusive, she decides to let him stay because <b>it</b> <b>reminded</b> her of her own troubled childhood with her equally abusive father. Roger (Tim Curry) offers Dan a deal to renovate and sell a small fixer-upper house, then runs off before the deal is complete; Jackie decides to buy the house, saving Dan from financial ruin. David gets a rejection letter from art school, while Darlene gets an acceptance. At the end of the season, Roseanne fears Darlene will run away to school, although Darlene has already decided not to go. Realizing she was wrong, Roseanne persuades Darlene to not give up on her goals just to stay with David.|$|E

Adstock is the mathematical manifestation of this behavioral process.|$|R
