40|$|AbstractTo {{evaluate}} the {{unconfined compressive strength}} (UCS) of rocks from drilling data is a promising in-situ method and has been studied by many researchers. In most studies, experimental methods {{have been used to}} determine the relationship between UCS and drilling data. In this paper, an analytical model is proposed to describe rock drilling processes using drag bits and rotary drills, and to deduce the relations among rock properties, bit shapes, and drilling parameters (rotary speed, thrust, torque, and stroke). In this model, a drilling process is divided into cycles, each of which includes two motions: feeding and cutting. Feeding is treated as an indentation motion. There is a linear relation between indentation pressure (thrust) and the indentation depth (penetration rate). The cutting forces and friction forces of both the rake surface and the flank surface are examined. Also, a virtual base is set to the model to simulate the contact surface between the flank surface of the bit and the rock. According to this model, drilling torque consists of four parts respectively generated from cutting, <b>friction,</b> <b>feeding,</b> and idle running. Torque caused by friction and idle running is ineffective for drilling, whereas that caused by cutting and indentation is effective. Similar to torque, specific energy also has four parts respectively from cutting, <b>friction,</b> <b>feeding,</b> and idle running. For the purposes of this study, effective specific energy is defined as the sum of specific energy consumed by cutting and feeding. Effective specific energy is independent of the penetration rate. Since it is proportional to the UCS of the rocks, it is not influenced by the penetration rate, and is more useful in the evaluation of UCS than other parameters. Some laboratory and field tests were conducted, and the results verified the usefulness and effectiveness of the proposed model...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. This paper proposes an {{analytical}} model to describe rock drilling processes using drag bits and rotary drills, and to induce relations among rock properties, bit shapes, and drilling parameters (rotary speed, thrust, torque, and stroke). In this model, a drilling process {{is divided into}} successive cycles. Each cycle includes two motions: feed and cutting. According to this model, drilling torque includes four components generated from cutting, <b>friction,</b> <b>feed,</b> and idle running respectively, the first three items are all proportional to {{the uniaxial compressive strength}} (UCS) when the penetration rate is constant. Laboratory tests verified the correctness and effectiveness of the proposed model qualitatively. Especially, the influence of friction on the flank face and the idle running was confirmed. Field experiments were performed. The results showed good correlation between the torque, penetration rate, and UCS.

40|$|In high {{precision}} motion control, performance is often {{limited by the}} presence of nonlinearities. In this study, the presence of nonlinear influences in a {{high precision}} transmission electron microscope stage is investigated using broadband multisine signals. These measurements yield the nature and level of nonlinearities as well as the best linear approximation of the dynamics. By quantitatively measuring the level of nonlinear influences, this method indicates the relevance of improved modeling. Next, the nonlinear influences are modeled explicitly by measuring the higher order sinusoidal input describing functions (HOSIDF) of the system which describe the 'direct' response of the system at the input frequency as well as at harmonics of the input frequency. Application of this technique yields a structured way to design Coulomb <b>friction</b> <b>feed</b> forward in the presence of nonlinearities. This procedure linearizes the input-output dynamics by applying feed forward and measuring the HOSIDFs which indicate the remaining nonlinear effects.

40|$|An {{analytical}} model for drilling process was proposed {{to describe the}} relations among physical properties of the rocks and mechanical data. Based on this model, a drilling system was developed. This drilling system can measure the mechanical drilling data and predict the geological conditions. 1) Development of the {{analytical model}} for rock drilling. In this analytical model, a drilling process is divided into continuous cycles, each of which includes two motions: feeding and cutting. Feeding is treated as an indentation motion. A linear relation exists between indentation pressure (thrust) and the indentation depth (penetration rate). Cutting forces and frictions of both the rake face and the flank face are examined. Especially, a virtual base is set to the model to simulate the contact surface between the flank face of the bit and the rock. Some relations among rock properties, bit shapes, and drilling parameters (rotary speed, thrust, torque, and stroke) were deduced. According to this model, drilling torque consists of four parts generated from cutting, <b>friction,</b> <b>feeding,</b> and idle running respectively. Similar to torque, specific energy also has four parts from cutting, <b>friction,</b> <b>feeding,</b> and idle running respectively. For this study, the effective specific energy {{is defined as the}} sum of specific energy consumed by cutting and feeding. It is more useful to evaluate uniaxial compressive strength (UCS) than other parameters are. 2) Development of the drilling system. The hardware of this system consists of a drilling machine (Trussmaster Series) and some instruments to measure mechanical data. The software can analyze the data from the mechanical data and predict the geostructure of roadways, rock physical properties and discontinuities of the strata. 3) Laboratory and field experiments. Some laboratory tests and field experiments were performed to verify the usefulness and effectiveness of the proposed model and the drilling system. With the mechanical data, the rock physical properties were evaluated. Meanwhile, the specimens taken from the fields were tested in laboratory to get their physical properties. The predicted values were agreed with the measured values. 4) Visualization of the geostructure. An application of VRML (virtual reality modeling language) was developed to display the predicted geostructure of roadway in 3 D. The strata and the discontinuities (cracks, boundary faces, etc.) can be displayed. The results of this study show that the drilling system is useful and feasible. Our future work is to improve the prediction precision and to apply the drilling model to other types of drilling machines. 室蘭工業大学 (Muroran Institute of Technology) 博士（工学...|$|R
50|$|With {{the advent}} of {{flexible}} film, Thomas Alva Edison quickly set out on his invention, the Kinetoscope, which was first shown at the Brooklyn Institute of Arts and Sciences on 9 May 1893. The Kinetoscope was a film loop system intended for one-person viewing. Edison, along with assistant W. K. L. Dickson, followed that up with the Kinetophone, which combined the Kinetoscope with Edison's cylinder phonograph. Beginning in March 1892, Eastman and then, from April 1893 into 1896, New York's Blair Camera Co. supplied Edison with film stock. At first Blair would supply only 40 mm (1-9/16 in) film stock that would be trimmed and perforated at the Edison lab to create 1-⅜ inch (34.925 mm) gauge filmstrips, then {{at some point in}} 1894 or 1895, Blair began sending stock to Edison that was cut exactly to specification. Edison's aperture defined a single frame of film at 4 perforations high. Edison claimed exclusive patent rights to his design of 35 mm motion picture film, with four sprocket holes per frame, forcing his only major filmmaking competitor, American Mutoscope & Biograph, to use a 68 mm film that used <b>friction</b> <b>feed,</b> not sprocket holes, to move the film through the camera. A court judgment in March 1902 invalidated Edison's claim, allowing any producer or distributor to use the Edison 35 mm film design without license. Filmmakers were already doing so in Britain and Europe, where Edison had failed to file patents.|$|R

40|$|The glandular {{regions of}} the upper {{digestive}} tract in the emu were non-pigmented (except for the tongue in most specimens) and invested by a non-keratinised stratified squamous epithelium. The glands found in these regions were exclusively simple in nature and composed of tubular secretory units lined by Periodic Acid Schiff Stain-positive mucus-secreting cells. The naming of the various glandular fields was based on previously identified anatomical features and on nomenclature modified from previous studies on birds. The glands were classified into two main types, namely, simple tubular and simple branched tubular mucus-secreting glands. Simple branched tubular glands were {{a feature of the}} regions exposed to the greatest amount of <b>friction</b> during <b>feeding,</b> whereas simple tubular glands were a feature of regions exposed to less friction. The saliva produced by the salivary glands in birds functions to moisturize and lubricate food boli.

Conventional data extraction requires a connection to a working source system, suitable connectivity standards or an API, and usually complex querying. By using the source system's standard reporting options, and directing the output to a spool file instead of to a printer, static reports can be generated suitable for offline analysis via report mining. This approach can avoid intensive CPU usage during business hours, can minimise end-user licence costs for ERP customers, and can offer very rapid prototyping and development of custom reports. Whereas data scraping and web scraping involve interacting with dynamic output, report mining involves extracting data from files in a human readable format, such as HTML, PDF, or text.

During rolling process the ring may be collapsed or deformed unexpectedly under the pressure of guide roll because the stiffness condition is not met. The force of guide roll to ring was obtained by analyzing the forces to ring. The stiffness condition expressions of ring during rolling were shown after constructing the mechanical model.

5000|$|The Sterling submachine gun is {{constructed}} entirely {{of steel and}} plastic and has a shoulder stock, which folds underneath the weapon. There is an adjustable rear-sight, which can be flipped between 100 and 200 yard settings. Although of conventional blowback design firing from an open bolt, there are some unusual features: for example, the bolt has helical grooves cut into the surface to remove dirt and fouling {{from the inside of}} the receiver to increase reliability. There are two concentric recoil springs which cycle the bolt, as opposed to the single spring arrangement used by many other SMG designs. This double-spring arrangement significantly reduces [...] "bolt-bounce" [...] when cartridges are chambered, resulting in better obturation, smoother recoil and increased accuracy. Additionally, the Sterling uses a much-improved (over the Sten) 34-round curved double-column feed box magazine, which is inserted into {{the left side of the}} receiver.

40|$|The {{operation}} of the Breakring vertical shaft impactor was investigated mathematically and experimentally. In particular, {{the performance of the}} crusher, the action of solids and air in the impeller and the mechanism responsible for the localised abrasion of the impeller wear parts were investigated. Computer programs were developed, which modelled the performance of the Breakring for impellers having simple, idealised wear part profiles. Contour plots were produced, which illustrated the dependence of impeller power, absolute particle exit speed and anvil angle for normal impact on the wear part sweep angle and the coefficient of <b>friction</b> between the <b>feed</b> material and the wear part. The significance of the contours was investigated. A computer program was developed, which modelled the action of a single particle in the Breakring impeller for wear parts having various complex profiles. The results indicated that the cause of the localised wear part abrasion was the reattachment of feed material to the wear part, following separation at the downstream end of the depression caused by action of material after entry to the impeller. The accuracy of the results was confirmed by the profiles of abraded wear parts and various other factors. A full-scale model impeller was constructed. The flow of air in the model and, following failure of the model, the flow of air and solids in a prototype impeller were investigated by a surface flow visualisation technique and high speed cinematography.

40|$|Friction is a {{nonlinear}} {{phenomenon that}} {{is present in}} almost all motion systems. Friction often limits systems performance by causing tracking and positioning errors and limit cycles. When these errors are unacceptable, the effect of friction needs to be compensated by the system controller, which estimates the <b>friction</b> force and <b>feed</b> this estimate back to the drives. Both model-free and model-based friction force estimation approaches exist. This thesis focuses on the modeling of friction and model-based friction estimation. Accurate model-based friction estimation is obtained provided that the friction model structure includes all major physical characteristics, and accurate real-time estimation of the model states and parameters is performed. This thesis presents a novel advanced friction model and a moving horizon estimator that allows to estimate model parameters and states in real-time. Moving horizon estimation (MHE) is an optimal control approach aiming to find the states and parameters {{of the system that}} are most consistent with current and past input-output data and the available system model. Moreover, real-time MHE is a gradient-based estimation technique that greatly benefits from a model that is differentiable with regards to state and parameter. Accurate friction models, which include all essential friction characteristics, as the generalized Maxwell-slip (GMS) model, are hybrid models with switching state conditions between presliding and sliding motion. To overcome these switching conditions, a smoothed version of the GMS model, called S-GMS, which consists of a set of differential equations well suited for gradient-based estimation is developed. Similar to the GMS model, the S-GMS model is a multi-state model that also describes all essential friction characteristics. A MHE friction observer is implemented for both the S-GMS model and the standard single-state LuGre model. Experimental state and parameter estimation shows the benefit of the multi-state S-GMS in presliding regime, where complex hysteresis behavior occurs. Moreover, a real-time embedded MHE friction observer is implemented for the S-GMS model via the automatic code generation tool ACADO and validated on a high-precision direct-drive linear motor. A sampling time in the millisecond range is achieved. nrpages: 150 status: publishe...|$|R
40|$|Ultrafine-grained metals {{produced}} by severe plastic deformation processes are distinguished with many outstanding mechanical properties {{such as a}} combination of high strength and ductility or improved fatigue behavior and thus {{can be used to}} meet the high strength requirements of the metal forming industry. Although several severe plastic deformation processes have been developed over the last three decades, the industrial utilization of such materials is still in an early stage. Production of bulk UFG materials is still expensive. Therefore, the few applications are limited to the sports goods, biomedical parts or sputtering targets where the price of the parts mostly doesn’t {{play a major role in}} the buying decision. To overcome the efficiency problems of current SPD methods, a new process, called “Equal Channel Angular Swaging” has been proposed which is based upon the combination of the conventional ECAP and the incremental bulk metal forming method of infeed rotary swaging. In the current study, firstly, mechanics of the process is investigated by using slip line field approach. It is determined that unlike conventional ECAP, due to the kinematics of the process, the friction forces help the deformation by drawing the samples into the forming operation. Accordingly, the loads in the feeding direction are relatively low. Therefore, ECAS has a great potential as a continuous and so economical SPD process. Secondly, in order to validate the slip line solution, a tool system has been developed. By the development, a thermo-mechanical coupled finite element simulation approach is utilized to investigate the effect of the geometrical parameters on material flow and temperature formation as well as process loads. It is determined that both, channel length and outer corner radius has a significant effect on the process. Accordingly, a middle channel length of 15 mm and an outer corner radius of 5 mm have been selected for the tool system of the model experiments. First experiments with the developed tool system prove the feasibility of ECAS process. The deformation of round bars from two different materials, commercially pure copper and low carbon steel was possible. Moreover, the deformation on the samples follows predominantly a simple shear pattern. Developed thermo-mechanical coupled finite element models are capable of representing the deformation as well as the process loads required to form the materials. However, due to the highly idealized assumptions by the slip line field approach, defined analytical formulas overestimate the real process forces. Nonetheless, the analytical theory is capable of representing the load correlations. The materials deformed by ECAS process are distinguished by an increased tensile strength compared to their as-received state. Moreover, microstructural investigations reveal that an average grain size under 1 µm can be achieved even after a single pass with the developed SPD process. Although model experiments prove the feasibility of ECAS and the process loads, especially in the feeding direction are low which demonstrate the potential for a continuous and economical processing, the investigated feed rate of 1 mm/s isn’t appropriate for a wide commercial implementation. Therefore, in the last step of investigations, the effect of the most important process parameters of <b>friction,</b> temperature, <b>feeding</b> speed and feeding type is investigated by means of finite element simulations. These simulations reveal that a discontinuous feeding is inevitable for the speed-up of ECAS process. Moreover, an active cooling is definitely necessary to keep the temperatures at acceptable levels and to ensure an efficient grain refinement...|$|R
