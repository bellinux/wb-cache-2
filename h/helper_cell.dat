5|$|After the {{processed}} antigen (peptide) is complexed to the MHC molecule, {{they both}} migrate together {{to the cell}} membrane, where they are exhibited (elaborated) as a complex that can be recognized by the CD 4+ (T helper cell)– a type of white blood cell. This is known as antigen presentation. However, the epitopes (conformational epitopes) that are recognized by the B cell prior to their digestion {{may not be the}} same as that presented to the T <b>helper</b> <b>cell.</b> Additionally, a B cell may present different peptides complexed to different MHC-II molecules.|$|E
5|$|Antibodies are {{secreted}} by B {{cells of}} the adaptive immune system, mostly by differentiated B cells called plasma cells. Antibodies can occur in two physical forms, a soluble form that is secreted from the cell to be free in the blood plasma, and a membrane-bound form that {{is attached to the}} surface of a B cell and {{is referred to as the}} B-cell receptor (BCR). The BCR is found only on the surface of B cells and facilitates the activation of these cells and their subsequent differentiation into either antibody factories called plasma cells or memory B cells that will survive in the body and remember that same antigen so the B cells can respond faster upon future exposure. In most cases, interaction of the B cell with a T <b>helper</b> <b>cell</b> is necessary to produce full activation of the B cell and, therefore, antibody generation following antigen binding. Soluble antibodies are released into the blood and tissue fluids, as well as many secretions to continue to survey for invading microorganisms.|$|E
5|$|Helper T cells express T {{cell receptors}} (TCR) that {{recognize}} antigen bound to Class II MHC molecules. The MHC:antigen complex is also {{recognized by the}} helper cell's CD4 co-receptor, which recruits molecules inside the T cell (e.g., Lck) {{that are responsible for}} the T cell's activation. Helper T cells have a weaker association with the MHC:antigen complex than observed for killer T cells, meaning many receptors (around 200–300) on the helper T cell must be bound by an MHC:antigen in order to activate the <b>helper</b> <b>cell,</b> while killer T cells can be activated by engagement of a single MHC:antigen molecule. Helper T cell activation also requires longer duration of engagement with an antigen-presenting cell. The activation of a resting helper T cell causes it to release cytokines that influence the activity of many cell types. Cytokine signals produced by helper T cells enhance the microbicidal function of macrophages and the activity of killer T cells. In addition, helper T cell activation causes an upregulation of molecules expressed on the T cell's surface, such as CD40 ligand (also called CD154), which provide extra stimulatory signals typically required to activate antibody-producing B cells.|$|E

25|$|Classically, {{two types}} of {{effector}} CD4+ T <b>helper</b> <b>cell</b> responses can be induced by a professional APC, designated Th1 and Th2, each designed to eliminate different types of pathogens. The factors that dictate whether an infection triggers a Th1 or Th2 type response are not fully understood, but the response generated does {{play an important role}} in the clearance of different pathogens.|$|E
25|$|Once the two-signal {{activation}} {{is complete}} the T <b>helper</b> <b>cell</b> (Th) then allows itself to proliferate. It achieves this by releasing a potent T cell growth factor called interleukin 2 (IL-2) which acts upon itself in an autocrine fashion. Activated T cells also produce the alpha sub-unit of the IL-2 receptor (CD25 or IL-2R), enabling a fully functional receptor that can bind with IL-2, {{which in turn}} activates the T cell's proliferation pathways.|$|E
25|$|Two {{commonly}} used CD molecules are CD4 and CD8, which are, in general, used as markers for helper and cytotoxic T cells, respectively. These molecules are defined {{in combination with}} CD3+, as some other leukocytes also express these CD molecules (some macrophages express low levels of CD4; dendritic cells express high levels of CD8). Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) binds CD4 and a chemokine receptor {{on the surface of}} a T <b>helper</b> <b>cell</b> to gain entry. The number of CD4 and CD8 T cells in blood is often used to monitor the progression of HIV infection.|$|E
50|$|The key {{association}} between IFNγ and granulomas is that IFNγ activates macrophages {{so that they}} become more powerful in killing intracellular organisms. Activation of macrophages by IFNγ from Th1 <b>helper</b> <b>cells</b> in mycobacterial infections allows the macrophages to overcome the inhibition of phagolysosome maturation caused by mycobacteria (to stay alive inside macrophages). The first steps in IFNγ-induced granuloma formation are activation of Th1 <b>helper</b> <b>cells</b> by macrophages releasing IL-1 and IL-12 {{in the presence of}} intracellular pathogens, and presentation of antigens from those pathogens. Next the Th1 <b>helper</b> <b>cells</b> aggregate around the macrophages and release IFNγ, which activates the macrophages. Further activation of macrophages causes a cycle of further killing of intracellular bacteria, and further presentation of antigens to Th1 <b>helper</b> <b>cells</b> with further release of IFNγ. Finally, macrophages surround the Th1 <b>helper</b> <b>cells</b> and become fibroblast-like cells walling off the infection.|$|R

30|$|Once {{the tumor}} cells are identified, the immune {{response}} begins. Then tumor cells are caught by macrophages, {{which can be}} found in all tissues in the body and circulate in the blood stream. Macrophages absorb tumor cells, eat them, and release a series of cytokines which activate T <b>helper</b> <b>cells</b> (i.e., a subpopulation of T lymphocytes). Activated T <b>helper</b> <b>cells</b> coordinate the counterattack. T <b>helper</b> <b>cells</b> can also be directly stimulated to interact with antigens. These <b>helper</b> <b>cells</b> cannot kill tumor cells, but they send urgent biochemical signals to a special type of T lymphocytes called natural killers (NKs). T cells begin to multiply and release other cytokines that further stimulate more T cells, B cells, and NK cells. As the number of B <b>cells</b> increases, T <b>helper</b> <b>cells</b> send a signal to start the production of antibodies. Antibodies circulate in the blood and are attached to tumor cells, which implies that the tumor cells are more quickly engulfed by macrophages or killed by NK cells. Like all T cells, NK cells are programmed to identify one specific type of infected cell or cancer cell. NK cells are lethal and constitute a vital line of the defense.|$|R
25|$|It {{is unknown}} what role the {{relatively}} bulky extracellular region of CD45 plays during cell interactions, but CD45 has various isoforms that change in size {{depending on the}} Th cell's activation and maturation status. For example, CD45 shortens in length following Th activation (CD45RA+ to CD45RO+), but whether this change in length influences activation is unknown. It has been proposed that the larger CD45RA+ may decrease the accessibility of the T cell receptor for the antigen-MHC molecule, thereby necessitating {{an increase in the}} affinity (and specificity) of the T cell for activation. Once the activation has occurred however, CD45 shortens, allowing easier interactions and activation as an effector T <b>helper</b> <b>cell.</b>|$|E
25|$|Increasingly, {{there is}} strong {{evidence}} from mouse and human-based scientific studies of a broader diversity in CD4+ effector T <b>helper</b> <b>cell</b> subsets. Regulatory T (Treg) cells, {{have been identified as}} important negative regulators of adaptive immunity as they limit and suppresses the immune system to control aberrant immune responses to self-antigens; an important mechanism in controlling the development of autoimmune diseases. Follicular helper T (Tfh) cells are another distinct population of effector CD4+ T cells that develop from naive T cells post-antigen activation. Tfh cells are specialized in helping B cell humoral immunity as they are uniquely capable of migrating to follicular B cells in secondary lymphoid organs and provide them positive paracrine signals to enable the generation and recall production of high-quality affinity-matured antibodies. Similar to Tregs, Tfh cells also play a role in immunological tolerance as an abnormal expansion of Tfh cell numbers can lead to unrestricted autoreactive antibody production causing severe systemic autoimmune disorders.|$|E
500|$|Complete {{stimulation}} of T helper cells requires the B7 molecule {{present on the}} antigen presenting cell to bind with CD28 molecule present on the T cell surface (in close proximity with the T cell receptor). Likewise, a second interaction between the CD40 ligand or CD154 (CD40L) present on T cell surface and CD40 present on B cell surface, is also necessary. The same interactions that stimulate the T <b>helper</b> <b>cell</b> also stimulate the B cell, hence the term costimulation. The entire mechanism ensures that an activated T cell only stimulates a B cell that recognizes the antigen containing the same epitope as recognized by the T cell receptor of the [...] "costimulating" [...] T <b>helper</b> <b>cell.</b> The B cell gets stimulated, apart from the direct costimulation, by certain growth factors, viz., interleukins 2, 4, 5, and 6 in a paracrine fashion. These factors are usually produced by the newly activated T <b>helper</b> <b>cell.</b> However, this activation occurs only after the B cell receptor present on a memory or a naive B cell itself would have bound to the corresponding epitope, without which the initiating steps of phagocytosis and antigen processing would not have occurred.|$|E
40|$|Antigen-specific T-helper {{cells for}} IgA {{responses}} arise in Peyer's patches (PP) following their immunization by subserosal injection of keyhole limpet haemocyanin (KLH).

KLH-specific <b>helper</b> <b>cells</b> can be detected subsequently in the intraepithelial lymphocyte population and also among lamina propria lymphocytes. The <b>helper</b> <b>cells</b> also relocate to PP distant to their site of origin where they are retained only when antigen is present. While i. p. p. immunization is an efficient route for the induction of IgA <b>helper</b> <b>cells</b> in gut-associated lymphoid tissue, it differs from oral immunization in that concomitant induction of antigen-specific splenic suppressor cells does not occur, indicating a role for epithelial antigen processing in this phenomenon...|$|R
40|$|Antigen-specific T <b>helper</b> <b>cells</b> {{present in}} {{peripheral}} blood {{at very low}} frequencies are capable of rapid clonal expansion during antigenic challenge. The exquisite specificity of this response provides for activation and expansion of a very select cohort of T cells, a feature we have used to directly identify and quantify human epitope-specific T <b>helper</b> <b>cells</b> from peripheral blood. Soluble tetramerized class II MHC molecules, loaded with an immunodominant peptide from hemagglutinin (HA) and labeled with fluorescent dyes, were constructed and used to directly identify antigen-specific T cells from influenza-immune individuals. After 7 days of proliferation in response to stimulation by HA peptide or whole influenza vaccine, cells staining positive with the HA tetramer had undergone between 6 and 9 divisions and were CD 3 +, CD 4 +, CD 25 +, and CD 8 –, characteristic of activated T <b>helper</b> <b>cells</b> responding to antigen.

This study was undertaken to investigate the role of the CTLA- 4 /CD 28 axis in the local application of CTLA- 4 Ig in the synovial fluid (SF) of RA patients. METHODS: Quantitative polymerase chain reaction was used to analyze the expression of proinflammatory and antiinflammatory cytokines in ex vivo fluorescence-activated cell sorted CTLA- 4 + and CTLA- 4 - T <b>helper</b> <b>cells</b> from the peripheral blood and SF of RA patients. T <b>helper</b> <b>cells</b> were also analyzed for cytokine expression in vitro after the blockade of CTLA- 4 by anti-CTLA- 4 Fab fragments or of B 7 (CD 80 /CD 86) molecules by CTLA- 4 Ig. RESULTS: CTLA- 4 + T <b>helper</b> <b>cells</b> were unambiguously present in the SF of all RA patients examined, and they expressed increased amounts of interferon-γ (IFNγ), interleukin- 17 (IL- 17), and IL- 10 as compared to CTLA- 4 - T <b>helper</b> <b>cells.</b> The selective blockade of CTLA- 4 in T <b>helper</b> <b>cells</b> from the SF in vitro led to increased levels of IFNγ, IL- 2, and IL- 17.
