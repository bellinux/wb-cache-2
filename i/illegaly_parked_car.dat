40|$|An {{investigation}} {{was carried out}} to establish the effectiveness of <b>parked</b> <b>cars</b> in urban street canyons as passive controls on pedestrian pollutant exposure. A numerical model of a generic street canyon was developed using a large eddy simulation (LES) model to compare personal exposure on the footpath with and without the presence of <b>parked</b> <b>cars.</b> Three configurations of <b>car</b> <b>parking</b> systems were investigated (parallel, perpendicular & 45 o parking) {{in addition to the}} influence of wind speed, wind direction and <b>car</b> <b>parking</b> occupancy. A tracer gas (CO 2) was used as a representative pollutant from vehicular sources within the street canyon models. The results indicated that <b>parked</b> <b>cars</b> may act as a temporary baffle plate between traffic emissions and pedestrians on the footpath. Reductions in exposure of up to 35 % and 49 % were attained on the leeward and windward footpaths in perpendicular wind conditions, with parallel winds allowing up to 33 % pollutant reduction on both footpaths for parallel parking. The perpendicular and 45 o <b>car</b> <b>parking</b> configurations investigated proved less successful as passive controls on air pollution exposure and an increase in pollutant concentration occurred in some models. An investigation of parking space occupancy rates was carried out for parallel <b>parked</b> <b>cars.</b> The fraction of <b>parked</b> <b>cars</b> influenced the level of reduction of pollutants on the footpaths with steady reductions in perpendicular winds, yet reductions were only evident for occupancy rates greater than approximately 45 % in parallel wind conditions. One negative impact associated with the <b>parked</b> <b>cars</b> study was the increase of pollutant levels on the roadway as the <b>parked</b> <b>cars</b> acted as a baffle wall, which trapped pollutants in the road. The paper underlines the potential of on-street <b>car</b> <b>parking</b> for reducing the personal exposure of pollutants by pedestrians and the optimum parking layout to achieve maximum health protection...|$|R
