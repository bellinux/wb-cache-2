2500|$|The Pension Reform Law (1972) {{guaranteed}} all retirees {{a minimum}} pension {{regardless of their}} contributions and institutionalized the norm that the standard pension (of average earners with forty years of contributions) should not fall below 50% of current gross earnings. The 1972 pension reforms improved <b>eligibility</b> <b>conditions</b> and benefits for nearly every subgroup of the West German population. The income replacement rate for employees who made full contributions was raised to 70% of average earnings. The reform also replaced 65 as the mandatory retirement age with a [...] "retirement window" [...] ranging between 63 and 65 for employees {{who had worked for}} at least thirty-five years. Employees who qualified as disabled and had worked for at least thirty-five years were extended a more generous retirement window, which ranged between the ages of 60 and 62. Women who had worked for at least fifteen years (ten of which had to be after the age of age 40) and the long-term unemployed were also granted the same retirement window as the disabled. In addition, there were no benefit reductions for employees who had decided to retire earlier than the age of 65. The legislation also changed the way in which pensions were calculated for low-income earners who had been covered for twenty-five or more years. If the pension benefit fell below a specified level, then such workers were allowed to substitute a wage figure of 75% of the average wage during this period, thus creating something like a minimum wage benefit. According to one study, the 1972 pension reform “enhanced” the reduction of poverty in old age.|$|E

40|$|In most countries, the {{unemployed}} {{are entitled to}} unemployment benefits only if they have previously worked a minimum period of time. This institutional feature creates a sharp change at eligibility in the disutility from unemployment and may distort the duration of jobs. In this paper, we evaluate this eligibility effect using a regression discontinuity approach. Our evidence is based on longitudinal social security data from Portugal, where {{the unemployed}} are required to work a relatively long period to collect benefits. We find that monthly transitions from employment to unemployment increase by 10 % {{as soon as the}} <b>eligibility</b> <b>condition</b> is met. This result is driven entirely by transitions to subsidised unemployment, which increase by 20 %, as non-subsidised unemployment is not affected. The effects are even larger for the unemployed with high replacement ratios or those who meet the <b>eligibility</b> <b>condition</b> from multiple short employment spells...|$|R
40|$|A highly skewed {{microdata}} {{contains some}} sensitive attribute values that occur far {{more frequently than}} others. Such data violates the “eligibility condition ” assumed by existing works for limiting the probability of linking an individual to a specific sensitive attribute value. Specifically, if the frequency of some sensitive attribute value is too high, publishing the sensitive attribute alone would lead to linking attacks. In many practical scenarios, however, this <b>eligibility</b> <b>condition</b> is violated. In this paper, we consider how to publish microdata under this case. A natural solution is “minimally ” suppressing “dominating ” records to restore the <b>eligibility</b> <b>condition.</b> We show that the minimality of suppression may lead to linking attacks. To limit the inference probability, we propose a randomized suppression solution. We show that this approach has the least expected suppression in a large family of randomized solutions, for a given privacy requirement. Experiments show that this solution approaches the lower bound on the suppression required for this problem. ...|$|R

On the assumption that elderly poverty rates are higher than the general population, the minimum <b>eligibility</b> <b>condition</b> is set for 60 �+ in most states. Our analysis using 52 nd and 60 th round household-level National Sample Survey data, however, suggests that households with targeted elderly members 60 �+ do not necessarily have higher poverty rates than non-elderly households. Further analysis suggests that there is an expenditure-mortality link so that the poor tend to die younger and are therefore under-represented among those aged 60 �+ in most states. ...|$|R

40|$|We {{study the}} effects of {{attribution}} criteria of unemployment benefits in an equilibrium model of unemployment where search intensities and wages are endogenous. Taking full account of an <b>eligibility</b> <b>condition</b> requiring a given work duration in order to benefit from unemployment insurance allow us to qualify the role of wages in the definition of the optimal sequence of unemployment benefits. At a given tax rate, numerical exercises suggest that the fall of the ineligible employees' wages contribute to the efficiency of a declining sequence of unemployment benefits. It is also shown that a stricter eligibility requirement could enhance the employment rate and the welfare of all workers when wages are negotiated. Finally, for the same unemployment rate, the optimal profile setting of unemployment benefits implies that wage flexibility is associated to an utilitarian welfare criterion, whereas wage rigidity is more convenient for a rawlsian one. ...|$|R

30|$|We {{can see in}} Table  2 that, for Spanish men, {{the policy}} proves the {{existence}} of the substitution effect as it decreases exits from employment into disability benefits for individuals that have contributed between 15 + and 25 years to the Social Security system. The results also show that the income effect due to the policy goes in the wrong direction as the coefficient for the <b>eligibility</b> <b>condition</b> is negative (and we expected it to be positive) although the coefficient becomes insignificant when we restrict the sample to exclude the years after the reform in 2002. Furthermore, when we include in the model the interactions between the policy and the business cycle variables, we find the correct sign for the income effect and the coefficient is very significant. We interpret this as evidence of the existence of an income effect conditional on business cycle conditions. The coefficient for the unemployment exit for individuals that have contributed between 15 + and 25 years is not significant.|$|R
