50|$|The Victoria Bridge {{remained}} in use until 2002, when a wider concrete girder bridge built {{parallel to the}} old bridge was completed {{to take over the}} role of <b>handling</b> <b>rail</b> traffic. The new bridge is significantly wider, with room to support a second track, but in its early life it was only required to handle a single track until double tracking and electrification was conducted between the Ipoh-Padang Besar line during the late-2000s and early-2010s.|$|E
50|$|With the {{absorption}} of Veneto into Italy in 1866, the Milan-Verona-Venice Railway came under the management of Upper Italian Railways. The size of Porta Vescovo was no longer sufficient in <b>handling</b> <b>rail</b> traffic; Porta Nuova was therefore designated as the main station of Verona. In 1900, the building was temporarily enlarged with a central wooden building, while projects were being developing for the new station. Architects initially envisaged the station comprising six platforms with additional tracks for the storage of rolling stock and for freight train operations.|$|E
50|$|Maine Eastern was a {{subsidiary}} of the Morristown & Erie Railway of New Jersey, who won the bid to operate the line in 2003. MERR provided freight service year-round, and passenger service seasonally between Brunswick and Rockland with former New Haven/Amtrak EMD FL-9 locomotives and stainless steel streamlined passenger cars. Maine Eastern was the successor to Safe <b>Handling</b> <b>Rail,</b> which took over operation of the MaineDOT-owned line when the Maine Coast Railroad chose not to bid on a new contract. In September 2015, the Maine Department of Transportation selected the Central Maine and Quebec Railway to operate the line beginning on January 1, 2016.|$|E

50|$|Installations added {{after the}} opening of the dock {{included}} a graving dock, and facilities for <b>handling</b> <b>rail</b> born coal shipments. The two coal drops and rail lines were built over {{the far end of the}} dock on timber piers. the first was completed by 1856 at a cost of £3,435, the second, at £3,500, soon after. The 350 ft graving dock was built east of the dock's lock, with an entrance of 70 ft. The design was by Adam Smith, and was contracted to James Taylor (Manchester) for £32,000 in 1855, the work was completed by 1858. Initially a Cornish engine from Perran Foundry (Cornwall) was installed to fill the dock with water from wells, but its use ended when the well's water supply failed.|$|E
5000|$|On 30 January 2015, the Supreme Court of Canada {{ruled that}} there is a {{constitutional}} right to strike. In this 5-2 majority decision, Justice Rosalie Abella ruled that [...] "along with their right to associate, speak through a bargaining representative of their choice, and bargain collectively with their employer through that representative, the right of employees to strike is vital to protecting the meaningful process of collective bargaining..." [...] 24. This decision adopted the dissent by Chief Justice Brian Dickson in a 1987 Supreme Court ruling on a reference case brought by the province of Alberta. The exact scope of this right to strike remains unclear and will no doubt be subject to further litigation. Prior to this Supreme Court decision the federal and/or provincial governments would introduce [...] "back to work legislation", a special law that blocks the strike action (or a lockout) from happening or continuing on further. Canadian governments would also impose binding arbitration or a new contract on the disputing parties. Back to work legislation was first used in 1950 during a railway strike, and as of 2012 has been used 33 times by the federal government for those parts of the economy that are regulated federally (grain <b>handling,</b> <b>rail</b> and air travel, and the postal service), and in more cases provincially. In addition certain parts of the economy can be proclaimed 'essential services' in which case all strikes are illegal.|$|E
5000|$|The [...] "SS-463L" [...] {{project was}} {{developed}} by a U.S. Air Force committee in 1957 and awarded to the Douglas Aircraft Company in 1959. The [...] "SS-463L Pallet Cargo Handling System" [...] specifications for aircraft (aka [...] "463L") included a [...] "Master Pallet" [...] design to meet {{a component of the}} material handling specifications of this system. The [...] "Master Pallet" [...] was contracted to the AAR Cadillac Manufacturing Corporation, at one time AAR Cadillac Corp, and now AAR Corporation. In the 1950s, the U.S. Air Force used a standard designation system for all awarded projects. The [...] "SS" [...] represents (Support System), the [...] "463" [...] represents an assigned general system category, 400-499 series for [...] "Support Systems", and the suffix [...] "L" [...] also represents [...] "Support Systems". Thus, [...] "463L" [...] {{is the name of the}} system. The standard HCU-6/E pallet in the [...] "463L" [...] system was designed and finalized in the early 1960s by the AAR Cadillac Corp. to implement the [...] "SS-463L Pallet Cargo Handling System" [...] now known as [...] "Materials Handling Support System [...] "463L"". The original design of the HCU-6/E pallet met the standards of the Universal Cargo <b>Handling</b> <b>Rail</b> System design in 1962 for the C-130 and C-141 transport aircraft. The new sturdy HCU-6/E pallet was a drastic improvement to the older lightweight balsa wood pallets used by the Air Force in previous years.It has often been thought that the 463L stands for the year that the pallet was initiated April 1963. Each HCU-6/E pallet is 88 inches (224 cm) wide, 108 inches (274 cm) long, and 2-1/4 inches (5.7 cm) high. The usable space is 84 in (213 cm) by 104 in (264 cm). It can hold up to 10,000 lb (4,500 kg) of cargo (not exceeding 250 lb per square inch) at 8 g. Empty, each pallet weighs 290 lb (130 kg), or 355 lb (160 kg) with two side nets and a top net.|$|E

40|$|Development of the {{diagnostics}} for ITER tokamak, {{which is}} presently under construction by several international partners at Cadarache in France, {{is a major}} challenge because of severe environment, strict engineering requirements, {{and the need for}} high reliability in the measurements. The diagnostic systems in the upper, equatorial and lower port cells on ITER are designed to be integrated within the interspace and port cell support structures. These structures are interfacing with remote <b>handling</b> <b>rail</b> system for the cask operations, thus facilitating the removal and installation of the diagnostics in the port and hence minimizing time for working close to the tokamak. In this paper, the challenges associated with the integration of the diagnostics in the port interspace and port cell, as well as their solutions will be addressed and presented. The interspace and the port cell support structures, as well as their interfaces with the biological shield, will be discussed...|$|E
50|$|Increase in {{wheel loads}} has {{important}} implications for the rail infrastructure needed to accommodate future grain hopper car shipments. The weight of the car is transmitted to the rails and the underlying track structure through these wheel loads. As wheel loads increase, track maintenance expenses increase and the ability of a given rail weight, ballast depth, and tie configuration to <b>handle</b> prolonged <b>rail</b> traffic decreases. Moreover, the ability of a given bridge to <b>handle</b> prolonged <b>rail</b> traffic also decreases as wheel loads increase.|$|R
