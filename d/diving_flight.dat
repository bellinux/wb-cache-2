5000|$|Flight is {{described}} in three stages: <b>dive</b> <b>flight,</b> glide flight, and ascent flight or landing phase. <b>Dive</b> <b>flight</b> occurs when the lizard launches itself from a tree {{and there is a}} steep downward glide at an angle of 45 degrees. The kinetic energy that develops during the <b>dive</b> <b>flight</b> is utilized in the second phase of glide flight. During glide flight, the lizard's body axis and tail are straightened to maximize flight distance. Finally, the third phase, ascent flight occurs. The trajectory of D. mindanensis rises so that the lizard can swoop upwards as it lands on its target. Rotation of the lizard's tail {{plays an important role in}} maintaining position in the air ...|$|R

50|$|In 1963 the Pitt Meadows Airport was opened. There are height {{restrictions}} on buildings {{due to the}} proximity of the Pitt Meadows Airport to the southeast, although the recent development of a 10 story building less than 2 kilometres from the East-West runways puts those restrictions in doubt. In 2003, the airport was undergoing expansion to support scheduled passenger service for short-haul prop-driven planes. The airport is also home to a skydiving school, {{as well as a number}} of other businesses. On August 3, 2008, a Beech 65-A90 King Air took off from Pitt Meadows Airport, B.C., with the pilot and seven parachutists for a local sky <b>diving</b> <b>flight.</b> The pilot reported an engine failure and turned back towards Pitt Meadows Airport, which could not be reached and a forced landing was carried out in a cranberry field, 400 m west of the airport. Four of the parachutists received serious injuries and the aircraft was substantially damaged although there was no fire and the occupants were evacuated. Pitt Meadows Water Aerodrome, (TC LID: CAJ8), is located 1 nautical mile (1.9 km; 1.2 mi) southwest of Pitt Meadows.|$|E
40|$|Based on our {{preceding}} {{studies on}} the aerodynamics of a falcoperegrinus in <b>diving</b> <b>flight</b> along a vertical dam {{it is known that}} even when the body shape of the bird is rather streamlined in V-shape some feathers tips may elevate in certain regions of the body. These regions were identified in wind tunnel tests for typical <b>diving</b> <b>flight</b> conditions as regions of locally separated flow. A life-size model in V-shape of a falcoperegrinus with artificial feathers fixed along the body was studied in a wind tunnel to focus on the fluid-structure interaction of feathers located in this sector. The distal ends of the feathers show flow-induced vibrations at typical flight conditions which grow linear in amplitude with increasing angle of incidence until incipient separation. In light of the proven existence of vibration-sensitive mechanoreceptors in the follicles of secondary feathers in birds it is hypothesized that this linear amplitude response offers the bird to sense the angle of incidence during the <b>diving</b> <b>flight</b> using the vibration magnitude as sensory stimulus. Thus the bird in streamlined shape has still a good measure to control its attitude to be in the narrow window of safe angle of incidence. This might have implications also for other birds or technical applications of airfoil sensors regarding incipient separation detection...|$|E

50|$|The {{handling}} changed {{according to}} the amount of fuel carried; using the fuselage tank alone, fuel consumption had no appreciable effect on handling because the tank was at the centre of gravity, but with full wing tanks, directional control was compromised, especially in a <b>dive.</b> The <b>flight</b> controls were well harmonized and the aircraft was easy to control at high speed. The maximum dive speed tested was 830 km/h with no buffeting and excellent stability both in the dive (depending on fuel load) and as a gun platform.|$|R

2500|$|The New Zealand pigeon is a large, , {{arboreal}} fruit-pigeon {{found in}} forests from Northland to Stewart Island/Rakiura, ranging in habitats from coastal to montane. [...] The general morphology {{is that of}} a typical pigeon, in that it has a relatively small head, a straight soft-based bill and loosely attached feathers. It also displays typical pigeon behaviour, which includes drinking by suction, a wing-threat display, hitting with the wing when threatened, a <b>diving</b> display <b>flight,</b> a 'bowing' display, ritualised preening and 'billing' during courtship. New Zealand pigeons build flimsy, shallow, twiggy nests and feed crop milk to hatchlings.|$|R

50|$|Beebes {{meeting with}} Piccard {{gave him an}} idea about how to obtain funding for {{additional}} <b>dives.</b> Piccards <b>flights</b> had been funded by the National Geographic Society, in return for Piccard having written an article describing them for National Geographic. Thinking that the society might feel similarly about descents into the ocean to how they did about ascents into the sky, Beebe {{wrote a letter to}} Gilbert Hovey Grosvenor proposing a similar sponsorship for his Bathysphere dives. Grosvenor wrote back offering to provide $10,000 for additional dives in return for Beebe keeping his promise to descend a half mile, and writing two articles for National Geographic describing the experience. Despite his reluctance over Grosvenors terms, Beebe accepted this offer.|$|R
60|$|It {{was on the}} Tuesday, {{after the}} close of the last Newmarket meeting, and just getting dusk, when Life opened the door and walked in. She wore a dark-red dress, a new one, and surely her face--her figure--were very {{different}} from what he had remembered! They had quickened and become poignant. She was no longer a child--that was at once plain. Cheeks, mouth, neck, waist--all seemed fined, shaped; the crinkly, light-brown hair was coiled up now under a velvet cap; only the great grey eyes seemed quite the same. And at sight of her his heart gave a sort of <b>dive</b> and <b>flight,</b> as if all its vague and wistful sensations had found their goal.|$|R
5|$|The terns are {{birds of}} open {{habitats}} that typically breed in noisy colonies and {{lay their eggs}} on bare ground {{with little or no}} nest material. Marsh terns construct floating nests from the vegetation in their wetland habitats, and a few species build simple nests in trees, on cliffs or in crevices. The white tern, uniquely, lays its single egg on a bare tree branch. Depending on the species, one to three eggs make up the clutch. Most species feed on fish caught by <b>diving</b> from <b>flight,</b> but the marsh terns are insect-eaters, and some large terns will supplement their diet with small land vertebrates. Many terns are long-distance migrants, and the Arctic tern may see more daylight in a year than any other animal.|$|R
5000|$|On 23 May 2012 Connery {{made his}} wingsuit jump from a {{helicopter}} flying at {{a height of}} 2400 ft over Ridge Wood in Buckinghamshire near his hometown of Henley-on-Thames, Oxfordshire. Coming back from California (Perris Valley) in 2003, where he did his first wingsuit flight, he said: [...] "that could be landed!" [...] and he went for a week to do wingsuit flight training at Empuriabrava {{on the coast of}} Spain, the largest dropzone in Europe. Before the final attempt, he had made two test flights landing with a parachute. He had also trained for weeks in Italy and Switzerland in preparation for the jump. He had to obtain permission from the Civil Aviation Authority for the <b>dive.</b> The <b>flight</b> was filmed by Mark Sutton.|$|R
50|$|With Flight 773 {{minutes from}} landing, Gonzales, seated {{directly}} behind the cockpit, burst into the cockpit and shot both pilots twice. Gonzales's first bullet hit a tiny section of the frame tubing from Captain Clark's seat. His second bullet killed Clark instantly. He then shot First Officer Andress, critically wounding him. Flying at its assigned altitude of 5,000 feet, Flight 773 went into a steep dive of 2,100 feet per minute at an airspeed of nearly 400 mph. The wounded Andress made a last frantic transmission {{as he tried to}} pull the plane out of the <b>dive.</b> The <b>flight</b> data recorder showed a sharp climb back to 3,200 feet. Gonzales most likely shot him again, fatally, before shooting himself, causing the plane to go into a final dive.|$|R

40|$|DECOMPRESSION ILLNESS (DCI) CAN OCCUR in {{a variety}} of contexts, {{including}} scuba <b>diving</b> and <b>flight</b> in nonpressurized aircraft. It is characterized by joint pain, neurologic injury, and respiratory or constitutional symptoms. To prepare flight crews for accidental decompression events, the Canadian Armed Forces regularly conducts controlled and supervised depressurization exercises in specialized chambers. We present the cases of 3 Canadian Armed Forces personnel who successfully completed such decompression exercises but experienced DCI after they took a 3 -hour commercial flight 6 hours after the completion of training. All 3 patients were treated in a hyperbaric oxygen chamber. The pathophysiology, diagnosis and management of DCI and the travel implications for military personnel who have undergone such training exercises are discussed. Although DCI is relatively uncommon, physicians may see it and should be aware of its presentation and treatment...|$|R
50|$|Buller's shearwater feeds {{mainly on}} fish, squid, and {{crustaceans}} {{such as the}} krill Nyctiphanes australis. It does occasionally follow ships such as fishing trawlers, and {{may be part of}} a mixed-species feeding flock. Food is caught mainly at a head's length below the surface at most, the bird either picking it up with the bill only, often out of flight, or briefly inserting the entire head, usually while swimming. It neither <b>dives</b> out of <b>flight</b> very often, nor in a plunge off the water's surface.|$|R
50|$|The DH 110's design {{shared the}} twin-boom {{layout of the}} de Havilland Vampire and Venom, had an {{all-metal}} structure, a 45° swept wing and an armament of four 30 mm ADEN cannons.

5|$|Anatomical dissections of two brown {{pelicans}} in 1939 {{showed that}} pelicans have {{a network of}} subcutaneous air sacs under their skin situated across the ventral surface including the throat, breast and undersides of the wings, as well as having air sacs in their bones. The air sacs {{are connected to the}} airways of the respiratory system, and the pelican can keep its air sacs inflated by closing its glottis, {{but it is not clear}} how air sacs are inflated. The air sacs serve to keep the pelican remarkably buoyant in the water and may also cushion the impact of the pelican's body on the water surface when they <b>dive</b> from <b>flight</b> into water to catch fish. Superficial air sacs may also help to round body contours (especially over the abdomen where surface protuberances may be caused by viscera changing size and position) to enable the overlying feathers to form more effective heat insulation and also to enable feathers to be held in position for good aerodynamics.|$|R
2500|$|Retiring in her {{task group}} to refuel, she {{returned}} to the Leyte action on 27 October, her planes concentrating on a heavy cruiser and two destroyers south of Mindoro.

40|$|The authors {{discuss the}} effect of reduced {{pressure}} at the final decompression station on nitrogen excretion from the organism of a diver.

40|$|One of the {{difficulties}} in determining constituent trends from the ER- 2 flight data is {{the large amount of}} day to day variability generated by the motion of the polar vortex. To reduce this variability, the observations have been transformed into the conservative (Lagrangian) reference frames consisting of the coordinate pairs, potential temperature (PT) and potential vorticity (PV), or PT and N 2 O. The requirement of only two independent coordinates rests on the assumption that constituent distributions and their chemical processes are nearly zonal in that coordinate system. Flight data is used everywhere for these transformation except for potential vorticity. Potential vorticity is determined from level flight segments, and NMC PV values during <b>flight</b> <b>dives</b> and takeoffs are combined with flight data in a smooth fashion...|$|R
40|$|Results {{are given}} of pressure-distribution {{measurements}} made over two different horizontal tail surfaces {{and the right}} wing cellule, including the slipstream area, of an observation-type biplane. Measurements were also taken of air speed, control-surface positions, control-stick forces, angular velocities, and accelerations during various abrupt maneuvers. These maneuvers consisted of push-downs and pull-ups from level <b>flight,</b> <b>dive</b> pull-outs, and aileron rolls with various thrust conditions. The results from the pressure-distribution measurements over the wing cellule are given on charts showing the variation of individual rib coefficients with wing coefficients; {{the data from the}} tail-surface pressure-distribution measurements are given mainly as total loads and moments. These data are supplemented by time histories of the measured quantities and isometric views of the rib pressure distributions occurring in abrupt maneuvers...|$|R
25|$|Leaving the MAEE in 1935, Stainforth spent a {{short period}} as Adjutant aboard HMS Glorious.

In February 1939, he returned to CFS Upavon (as Officer Commanding Examining and Handling Flight). On 12 January 1940, {{he was promoted to}} Wing Commander and commanded No 600(F) Squadron. In June 1940, Stainforth and Stanford Tuck, the Battle of Britain ace, were posted to Farnborough in south central England. His task was to take part in comparison trials of a captured Me-109E and a Spitfire Mark II.

50|$|During 1956 the 4925th Test Group (Atomic) {{worked on}} {{equipment}} testing to provide single Mk-15 and Mk-21 capabilities for the B-52. Both configurations were in {{use by the}} end of 1956, and successful flight and drop tests continued into February 1957. The group also began testing the TX-28 with the swept-wing F-84F “Thunderstreak.” Aircraft modifications included pylon and weapon loading and compatibility, proper functioning of the units, clearances, and complete electrical checks of the special weapons control. Flights determined aerodynamic loads, vibration, stability and control affects in straight and level, <b>flight</b> <b>dive</b> and LABS maneuvers. A new technological innovation in the early 1950s, LABS was a component of the flight control system; it controlled an aircraft automatically during low-altitude bombing. These testmaneuvers were made at various true airspeeds, altitudes, and release and dive angles.|$|R
