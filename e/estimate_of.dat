5|$|An <b>estimate</b> <b>of</b> a horse's age can be {{made from}} looking at its teeth. The teeth {{continue}} to erupt throughout life and are worn down by grazing. Therefore, the incisors show changes as the horse ages; they develop a distinct wear pattern, changes in tooth shape, and changes in the angle at which the chewing surfaces meet. This allows a very rough <b>estimate</b> <b>of</b> a horse's age, although diet and veterinary care can also affect the rate of tooth wear.|$|E
5|$|An f-deck is a {{data file}} that {{contains}} {{a record of the}} fixes of a storm's location and/or intensity. A location fix is any position <b>estimate</b> <b>of</b> the storm center.

Various methods that use satellite imagery or other remote sensing can also provide location and intensity fixes.|$|E

RESULTS: Despite different methods and very different <b>estimates</b> <b>of</b> prevalence, these 2 methods led to very similar <b>estimates</b> <b>of</b> 173, 000 and 163, 000 excess deaths.
