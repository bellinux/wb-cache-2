This article presents estimates of direct wind energy employment in all EU countries, gathered for the first time. By using a thematic survey, the authors {{have been able to}} analyse aspects such as gender distribution, company profiles and the shortage of skilled workers reported by wind energy companies. The outcomes show that wind energy deployment creates a significant number of jobs (over 104, 000 in 2008), and does so at a time when other energy sectors are shrinking. There is a clear relationship between MW installed and number of jobs, but the use of a single EU job/MW ratio is not feasible, due to differences in the export/import capacity. Wind turbine manufacturers [...] including major sub-components [...] are responsible for the lion's share of the jobs, and there is a marked prevalence of males in the workforce. The scarcity of specialist roles [...] project managers, engineers and O&M technicians [...] {{is not likely to be}} solved unless a series of educational, mobility and <b>dissemination</b> <b>measures</b> are put into practice.

40|$|In {{the last}} decade digital devices and {{services}} have permeated many aspects of everyday life. They generate massive amounts of data that provide insightful information about how people move across geographic areas and how they interact with others. By analysing this detailed information, {{it is possible to}} investigate aspects of human mobility and interaction. Therefore, the thesis of this dissertation is that the analysis of mobility and interaction traces generated by digital devices and services, at different timescales and spatial granularity, can be used {{to gain a better understanding}} of human behaviour, build new applications and improve existing services. In order to substantiate this statement I develop analytical models and applications supported by three sources of mobility and interaction data: online social networks, mobile phone networks and GPS traces. First, I present three applications related to data gathered from online social networks, namely the analysis of a global rumour spreading in Twitter, the definition of spatial <b>dissemination</b> <b>measures</b> in a social graph and the analysis of collaboration between developers in GitHub. Then I describe two applications of the analysis of country-wide data of cellular phone networks: the modelling of epidemic containment strategies, with the goal of assessing their efficacy in curbing infectious diseases; the definition of a mobility-based measure of individual risk, which can be used to identify who needs targeted treatment. Finally, I present two applications based on GPS traces: the estimation of trajectories from spatially-coarse temporally-sparse location traces and the analysis of routing behaviour in urban settings...|$|E

A program promoting the active intergenerational use of IZ {{has been developed}} {{as part of a}} large lexical documentation effort with a botany subcomponent. Beginning in 2012, this program has, from the outset, included community participation, retention of research results, and creation of learning materials, leading to an on-going effort to facilitate a year-long program of language learning opportunities. In this paper we describe strategies adopted to encourage active IZ use both within and around the documentation project. We present results of these approaches and argue that attention to language practices among all participants in revitalization and documentation initiatives is an important step towards improved program planning. Strategies within the program include privileging IZ in the research instruments and practices, and scaffolding language teaching through the creation of interdisciplinary workshops for children. The language practices of program participants resulting from these strategies are reported through analysis of recordings, ethnographic observation and interview data. Strategies outside the program activities include dissemination of bilingual learning materials and outreach to schools and cultural centers. Results are presented based on quantitative <b>dissemination</b> <b>measures</b> as well as ethnographic and interview data. We discuss how opportunities and motivations for speaking, comprehending, reading and/or writing IZ were created among participants, including the team of facilitators consisting of speakers with varying degrees of language competence, the student participants in education initiatives, outside researchers, and the wider community. Examples include speakers engaging more actively with text and intergenerational communication, passive bilinguals producing language in both spoken and written forms, and Spanish-dominant bilinguals using IZ in new domains. We also explain that the use of IZ has extended to outside researchers through their use of research tools in IZ and that the public visibility of the program has led at least some local residents to take notice of the relevance of IZ. We conclude with a discussion of the on-going challenges in making these program-induced shifts in language practice more significant and sustainable. As a series of leveled workshops are developed, current language practices will be considered as a base for new strategies aiming to maximize IZ use while drawing on the participation and varying competencies of all participants...|$|E

40|$|Includes bibliographical {{references}} (leaves 99 - 119). The HIV/AIDS epidemic {{has become}} a serious health, social and economic problem in Zimbabwe. Almost 30 {{percent of the population}} had been infected by AIDS (Acquired immune Deficiency Syndrome) by 2004. The epidemic has also affected almost the entire population {{in one way or another}} - domestically, socially and economically. Zimbabwe faces a long-term development disaster because of the effects of the disease across the societal spectrum. AIDS is threatening every fibre of the nation from food supply to economic productivity, and not least human resource development. Many households have lost their principal source of income to the disease and have become impoverished. The national budget is increasingly under pressure as scarce resources are channelled to fight the HIV/AIDS pandemic. Despite a multitude of interventions aimed at preventing the scourge of the epidemic on the health system, the economy and human development, HIV/AIDS still presents a problem of enormous magnitude in Zimbabwe. It is argued that a major limitation of the various interventions to fight the pandemic has been the failure to extensively and effectively harness knowledge and disseminate information relating to all aspects of HIV/AIDS in Zimbabwe. The NGO sector, because of its grassroots involvement with the disease, is particularly well placed to fulfil such a role. The main aim of this study was to explore information and knowledge management and dissemination by HIV/AIDS NGOS in Zimbabwe. A further objective was to identity in the literature strategies that have been used, vis-a-vis modern information and knowledge management practice, in cognate sectors of development in Zimbabwe and other countries. It is argued that by applying appropriate information and knowledge management practices valuable knowledge and information that relate to how communities experience the problems and the impact associated with HlV/AIDS can be gathered and disseminated. Information and knowledge management is recommended by the United Nations' UNAIDS as the best way to harness both tacit and explicit information related to all aspects of the epidemic. A survey was conducted amongst 64 HIV/AIDS NGOs based in Harare, Zimbabwe. Data was collected using questionnaires, key informant interviews, and observation methods, and this was further supported by data collected from documentary and electronic sources. The main outcome of the study indicates that information and knowledge management is generally not well practised in the HIV/AIDS NGO sector in Zimbabwe. This is despite the fact that 75 % of the NGOs had information services in place. Far too few qualified staff have been appointed to manage information services and this lack of professional skills has had a negative impact on HIV/AIDS information dissemination. It is argued that in a society such as in Zimbabwe, effective information <b>dissemination</b> <b>measures</b> are needed to assist social, economic and scientific interventions. It was further established that a sound information and knowledge management policy, and information technology developments were needed to address the information service challenges. The other main outcome showed that NGOS were not networking effectively among themselves, with government and other role players such as the private sector, educational institutions and churches, etc. Lastly, there was a strong indication that information technology, i. e., computers and accessories, the Internet, intranets, databases and audio-visuals, etc [...] were not fully utilised, this is despite the fact that in other countries they have been very effective to assist in the creation, generation, gathering and diffusion of information. Based on the research outcomes, the researcher thus proposes that information and knowledge management practices should be set in place in the HIV/AIDS sector of Zimbabwe. NGOs should ensure that information services are run and manned by skilled and trained information officers. It is also suggested that government should be encouraged to become more involved and complement the work done by NGOs by reviewing the 1985 NLDS Act and other policy instruments. The study further recommends that, HIV/AIDS NGOs should work towards networking and providing a single shared dissemination source to the public, such as a national database, which would be hosted via a web-based internet portal. This would also enable NGOs to explore further networking efforts such as communities of practice (expert forums), a national HIV/AIDS bibliography and electronic publishing...|$|E

The SBN started an educational program for the prevention of traffic accidents, adapted from the American model ""Think First"" to the Brazilian environment, since 1995, with special effort devoted to the prevention of TBI by using seat belts and motorcycle helmets. The objective {{of the present study was}} to set up a traffic accident prevention program based on the adapted Think First and to evaluate its impact by comparing epidemiological variables before and after the beginning of the program. Methods: The program was executed in Maringa city, from September 2004 to August 2005, with educational actions targeting the entire population, especially teenagers and young adults. The program was implemented by building a network of information facilitators and multipliers inside the organized civil society, with widespread population <b>dissemination.</b> To <b>measure</b> the impact of the program, a specific software was developed for the storage and processing of the epidemiological variables. Results: The results showed a reduction of trauma severity due to traffic accidents after the execution of the program, mainly TBI. Conclusions: The adapted Think First was systematically implemented and its impact measured for the first time in Brazil, revealing the usefulness of the program for reducing trauma and TBI severity in traffic accidents through public education and representing a standardized model of implementation in a developing country.

40|$|BACKGROUND: The time of {{infection}} is rarely known in human cases; thus, {{the effects of}} delaying the initiation of antiretroviral therapy (ART) on the peripheral viral load {{and the establishment of}} viral reservoirs are poorly understood. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: Six groups of macaques, infected intravenously with SIV(mac 251), were given placebo or antiretroviral therapy to explore reservoir establishment; macaques were treated for 2 weeks, with treatment starting 4 hours, 7 or 14 days after infection. Viral replication and <b>dissemination</b> were <b>measured</b> in the gut (rectum), in the lung and in blood and lymphoid tissues (peripheral lymph nodes), by quantifying viral RNA, DNA and 2 LTR circles. We used immunohistochemistry (CD 4 and CD 68) {{to assess the impact of}} these treatments on the relative amount of virus target cells in tissue. Treatment that was started 4 hours post-infection (pi) decreased viral replication and dissemination in blood and tissue samples, which were assessed on day 14 (RNA/DNA/ 2 LTR circles). The virus remained detectable and lymphoid tissues were activated in LN and the gut in both placebo- and ART-treated animals. Viral RNA in plasma continued to be lower in macaques treated seven days after infection; however, this was not the case for viral DNA in peripheral blood mononuclear cells. There was a small but significant difference in RNA and DNA levels in tissues between placebo- and ART-treated animals on day 21. When started 14 days after infection, treatment resulted in a limited decrease in the plasma viral load. CONCLUSIONS: Treatment that was started 4 hours after infection significantly reduced viral replication and dissemination. When started 7 days after infection, it was of slight virological benefit in peripheral blood and in tissues, and treatment was even less effective if started 14 days pi.

40|$|The {{frequency}} with which condoms are used in sex relations by subjects with HIV was determined by interviewing 132 individuals, 82 men and 50 women, most of them from São Paulo state and some from {{other regions of the}} country, all of them seen at an outpatient clinic of the School of Medicine in Botucatu. The women were younger, were of lower educational level and had poorer professional qualification than men. Also, a greater proportion of women were widowed, separated or divorced. We observed that 43. 9 % of men and 72 % of women had been contaminated by the sexual route, but only 41. 2 % of the men and 31. 8 % of the women reported the use of a condom after the diagnosis of infection, with most men and women preferring sexual abstinence. The results enable the conclusion that there is still a need to continue to provide information about the use of condoms and to guarantee their free-of-charge distribution due to the low levels of education and professional qualification of the individuals studied. The data also suggest that campaigns for the <b>dissemination</b> of preventive <b>measures</b> should consider the social and cultural differences of infected women...|$|R
40|$|Abstract Background The {{association}} between lower socioeconomic status and poorer health outcomes {{has been observed}} using both individual-level and aggregate-level measures of income and education. While both are predictive of health outcomes, previous research indicates poor agreement between individual-level and aggregate-level measures. The {{purpose of this study}} was to determine the level of agreement between aggregate-level and individual-level measures of income and education among three distinct patient groups, specifically asthma, diabetes, and rheumatoid patients. Methods Individual-level measures of annual household income and education were derived from three separate surveys conducted among patients with asthma (n = 359), diabetes (n = 281) and rheumatoid arthritis (n = 275). Aggregate-level measures of income and education were derived from the 2001 Canadian census, including both census tract-and <b>dissemination</b> area-level <b>measures.</b> Cross-tabulations of individual-level income by aggregate-level income were used to determine the percentage of income classifications in agreement. The kappa statistic (simple and weighted), Spearman's rank correlations, and intra-class correlation coefficient (ICC) were also calculated. Individual-level and aggregate-level education was compared using Chi-Square tests within patient groups. Point biserial correlation coefficients between individual-level and aggregate-level education were computed. Results Individual-level income was poorly correlated with aggregate-level measures, which provided the worst estimations of income among patients in the lowest income category at the individual-level. Both aggregate-level measures were best at approximating individual-level income in patients with diabetes, in whom aggregate-level estimates were only significantly different from individual-level measures for patients in the lowest income category. Among asthma patients, the proportion of patients classified by aggregate-level measures as having a university degree was significantly lower than that classified by individual-level measures. Among diabetes and rheumatoid arthritis patients, differences between aggregate and individual-level measures of education were not significant. Conclusions Agreement between individual-level and aggregate-level measures of socioeconomic status may depend on the patient group as well as patient income. Research is needed to characterize differences between patient groups and help guide the choice of measures of socioeconomic status. </p...|$|R
40|$|Globally, {{almost three}} billion people rely on biomass (wood, charcoal, crop residues, and dung) and coal {{as their primary}} source of {{domestic}} energy. Exposure to indoor air pollution from the combustion of solid fuels has been implicated, {{with varying degrees of}} evidence, as a causal agent of of disease and mortality in developing countries. We review the current knowledge on the relationship between indoor air pollution and disease, and on the assessment of interventions for reducing exposure and disease. Our review takes an environmental health perspective and considers the details of both exposure and health effects that are needed for successful intervention strategies. We also identify knowledge gaps and detailed research questions that are essential for successful design and <b>dissemination</b> of preventive <b>measures</b> and policies. In addition to specific research recommendations, we conclude that given the central role of housing, household energy, and day-to-day household activities in determining exposure to indoor smoke, research and development of effective interventions can benefit tremendously from integration of methods and analysis tools from a range of disciplines—from quantitative environmental science and engineering, to toxicology and epidemiology, to the social sciences.

40|$|The CERES Flight Model 1 and 2 {{instruments}} were launched aboard NASA's Earth Observing System (EOS) Terra Spacecraft on December 18, 1999 into a 705 Km sun-synchronous orbit with a 10 : 30 a. m. equatorial crossing time. These instruments supplement measurements {{made by the}} CERES Proto Flight Model (PFM) instrument launched aboard NASA's Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission (TRMM) spacecraft on November 27, 1997 into a 350 Km, 38 -degree mid-inclined orbit. An {{important aspect of the}} EOS program is the rapid archival and <b>dissemination</b> of datasets <b>measured</b> by EOS instruments to the scientific community. On September 22, 2000 the CERES Science Team voted to archive the Edition 1 CERES/Terra Level 1 b and Level 2 and 3 ERBE-Like data products. These products consist of instantaneous filtered and unfiltered radiances through temporally and spatially averaged TOA fluxes. CERES filtered radiance measurements cover three spectral bands including shortwave (0. 3 to 5 micron), total (0. 3 to less than 100 microns) and an atmospheric window channel (8 to 12 microns). The current work summarizes both the philosophy and results of validation efforts undertaken to quantify the quality of the Terra data products as well as the level of agreement between the Terra and TRMM datasets...|$|R
