30|$|Finally, both Warrick et al. (2013) and Steel et al. (2016) {{invoked the}} origin of sands <b>in</b> the <b>Santa</b> <b>Barbara</b> Channel studies to hyperpycnal flows. But they totally ignored the {{significance}} of tidal currents. Tidal currents <b>in</b> the <b>Santa</b> <b>Barbara</b> Channel had been well documented (Münchow 1998). Boyd et al. (2008) convincingly documented that at high sea-level, southeast Australian deep-water sands are delivered by a wave-driven coastal transport system, interacting with estuarine ebb tidal flows that transport sand over the shelf edge. Therefore, one could explain deposition of the so-called “hyperpycnites” <b>in</b> the <b>Santa</b> <b>Barbara</b> Channel by tidal current activities as well.|$|R

5|$|The {{estimate}} of $74 million financial impact {{over three years}} to the county includes approximately $37 million in lost property taxes, $32 million in lessened worker income and $5 million in reduced federal royalties. This {{is the result of}} the region’s oil and gas industry being heavily dependent on Lines 901 and 903. Prior to the spill, Exxon, which was the region’s biggest oil operator at the time, was on pace to generate approximately $636 million in revenue <b>in</b> <b>Santa</b> <b>Barbara</b> County during 2015 but as of November 5, 2015 had only generated an estimated $216.6 million. The offshore oil platforms that rely on the lines were forced to shut down when onshore storage tanks were filled. , no timetable had been established to restart the rigs. Truck transport of continuing production from the offshore platforms was not allowed by local agencies. Exceptions have been closely scrutinized by local officials such as allowing Venoco in August 2015 to transport crude oil that was already onshore by truck for a limited period. The oil had been evacuated from tanks and pipelines to allow maintenance of the onshore Ellwood facility in Goleta that serves Platform Holly.|$|E
5|$|Although {{meant to}} take place <b>in</b> <b>Santa</b> <b>Barbara,</b> California, the installment, like the {{majority}} of Psychs episodes, was filmed {{in and around the}} Vancouver area of British Columbia. According to the show's creator Steve Franks, about half of the scenes in each episode are filmed in the suburb town of White Rock. Several of the sets, like the Psych office and Henry Spencer's house, are located along the coast in the White Rock area. Because of the differences between Vancouver and Santa Barbara, the show's producers were forced to bring in props for each episode, such as nine fake palm trees which had to be trucked to the set every day. The scripts for each Psych episode had to go through several reviews, and often were cut down by as much as a few dozen pages. A large portion of show's dialogue consists of on-the-spot improvisation by the actors, specifically Roday and Hill. The writers noted that much of the humor in the installments came from improvisation. The episode also included several reoccurring gags on the show, such as an introductory flashback and the inclusion of a pineapple; both gags were created by the action of one of the actors.|$|E
