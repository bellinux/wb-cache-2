5|$|After the United States {{occupation}} of Veracruz on 21 April 1914 (which found six American-Hawaiian ships <b>in</b> <b>Mexican</b> ports), the Huerta-led Mexican government closed the Tehuantepec National Railway to American shipping. This loss of access {{coupled with the}} fact that the Panama Canal was not yet open, caused American-Hawaii to return in late April to its historic route of sailing around South America via the Straits of Magellan. With the opening of the Panama Canal on 15 August, American-Hawaiian ships switched to taking that route.|$|E
5|$|Due to the {{intensity}} of the situation, Texas put to sea on 13 May and headed directly to operational duty without benefit of the usual shakedown cruise and post-shakedown repair period. After a five-day stop at Hampton Roads from 14–19 May, she joined Rear Admiral Fletcher's force off Veracruz on 26 May. She remained <b>in</b> <b>Mexican</b> waters for just over two months, supporting the American forces ashore. On 8 August, she left Veracruz and set a course for Nipe Bay, Cuba, and from there steamed to New York, where she entered the Navy Yard on 21 August.|$|E

At the end of the year, she joined the Great White Fleet on its circumnavigation of the globe, which ended in early 1909. Peacetime training followed for the next five years, and in 1914 she cruised <b>in</b> <b>Mexican</b> waters to protect American interests during the Mexican Revolution. In early 1916, the ship was temporarily decommissioned.|$|E
5|$|Knowledge of {{the gold}} find seems to have {{remained}} largely within Mexican territory. John Sutter, who sided with Gov. Manuel Micheltorena during the governor's power struggle with former Gov. Alvarado, was imprisoned after the californio insurrectionists won the Battle of Providencia in 1845.

40|$|Dyslipidemia {{and obesity}} are {{especially}} prevalent in populations with Amerindian backgrounds, such as Mexican-Americans, which predispose these populations to cardiovascular disease. Here we design an approach, {{known as the}} cross-population allele screen (CPAS), which we conduct prior to a genome-wide association study (GWAS) in 19, 273 Europeans and <b>Mexicans,</b> <b>in</b> order to identify Amerindian risk genes <b>in</b> <b>Mexicans.</b> Utilizing CPAS to restrict the GWAS input variants to only those differing in frequency between the two populations, we identify novel Amerindian lipid genes, receptor-related orphan receptor alpha (RORA) and salt-inducible kinase 3 (SIK 3), and three loci previously unassociated with dyslipidemia or obesity. We also detect lipoprotein lipase (LPL) and apolipoprotein A 5 (APOA 5) harbouring specific Amerindian signatures of risk variants and haplotypes. Notably, we observe that SIK 3 and one novel lipid locus underwent positive selection <b>in</b> <b>Mexicans.</b> Furthermore, after a high-fat meal, the SIK 3 risk variant carriers display high triglyceride levels. These findings suggest that Amerindian-specific genetic architecture leads to {{a higher incidence of}} dyslipidemia and obesity <b>in</b> modern <b>Mexicans.</b> © 2014 Macmillan Publishers Limited.

5|$|Besides these {{international}} initiatives, {{some countries}} {{are taking their}} own actions. New Zealand has banned the taking of manta rays since {{the introduction of the}} Wildlife Act in 1953. In June 1995, the Maldives banned the export of all ray species and their body parts, effectively putting a stop to manta fishing as there had not previously been a fishery for local consumption. The government reinforced this in 2009 with the introduction of two marine protected areas. In the Philippines, the taking of mantas was banned in 1998, but this was overturned in 1999 under pressure from local fishermen. Fish stocks were surveyed in 2002, and the ban was reintroduced. The taking or killing of mantas <b>in</b> <b>Mexican</b> waters was prohibited in 2007. This ban may not be strictly enforced, but laws are being more rigidly applied at Isla Holbox, an island off the Yucatán Peninsula, where manta rays are used to attract tourists.|$|E
5|$|Concord resumed her patrol {{on station}} in August 1898, but {{returned}} to the Philippines on 19 December to assist in putting down the insurrection. Her duty consisted of patrolling the coast to restrict insurgent movements and shipping; bombarding various strongholds; and aiding United States Army operations. Except for a voyage to Guam in March 1900 to deliver stores, and a brief voyage to Hong Kong for repairs, Concord remained in Philippine waters until June 1901, when she sailed by way of Alaskan waters to San Francisco, arriving 28 September 1901. She cruised with the Fleet <b>in</b> <b>Mexican</b> waters, then went out of commission on 26 February 1902 at Mare Island.|$|E
5|$|Encountered singly or in groups, the thornback {{guitarfish}} {{feeds on}} small, benthic invertebrates and bony fishes. It is aplacental viviparous, with the developing young drawing sustenance from a yolk sac. Females {{give birth to}} 1–15 pups annually in late summer, following a roughly year-long gestation period. The International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) has listed the thornback guitarfish under Least Concern {{because the majority of}} its range lies within United States waters, where it is common since it has no commercial value and is not heavily fished commercially or recreationally. The status of this species <b>in</b> <b>Mexican</b> waters is inadequately known but may be more precarious.|$|E

25|$|The Hispanic {{population}} is rapidly growing in Freehold Borough, making up 4.6% (0.2% <b>Mexican)</b> <b>in</b> the 1980 Census, 11.3% (2.8% <b>Mexican)</b> <b>in</b> the 1990 Census, 28.0% (17.3% <b>Mexican)</b> <b>in</b> 2000 and recently 42.9% (29.6% <b>Mexican)</b> <b>in</b> 2010. On the contrary, the Black or African American population has decreased in recent decades: 17.1% in 1970, 19.8% in 1980, 18.2% in 1990, 15.8% in 2000 and 12.6% in 2010.|$|R
5|$|Following the battle, Santa Anna was {{alternately}} {{viewed as}} a national hero or a pariah. Mexican perceptions of the battle often mirrored the prevailing viewpoint. Santa Anna had been disgraced following his capture at the Battle of San Jacinto, and many Mexican accounts of the battle were written by men who had been, or had become, his outspoken critics. Petite and many other historians believe {{that some of the}} stories, such as the execution of Crockett, may have been invented to further discredit Santa Anna. <b>In</b> <b>Mexican</b> history, the Texas campaign, including the Battle of the Alamo, was soon overshadowed by the Mexican–American War of 1846–48.|$|E
5|$|For the {{remainder}} of 1913, Yorktown conducted local operations out of San Diego and San Francisco. In January 1914, though, the gunboat returned to Mexican waters and investigated local conditions at Ensenada between 3 and 6 January before moving, in subsequent months, to a succession of Mexican ports: Mazatlán, San Blas, Miramar, Topolobampo, and La Paz. Following an overhaul at Mare Island from 24 June to 2 September 1914, Yorktown served <b>in</b> <b>Mexican</b> waters again into June 1915. From that point until the entry of the United States into World War I in April 1917, Yorktown continued her routine of patrols off Mexican, Nicaraguan, and Honduran ports with occasional repairs at Mare Island and maneuvers out of San Diego.|$|E
5|$|Harmless and docile, the thornback {{guitarfish}} can {{be readily}} approached underwater, and fares well in public aquariums. Off the United States, this ray is common and faces no substantial threats: it is only occasionally caught incidentally by commercial and recreational fishers, and has no economic value. As most of its range lies within US waters, the species has been assessed as Least Concern overall by the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN). However, <b>in</b> <b>Mexican</b> waters the thornback guitarfish population is small and fragmented, {{and the degree to}} which it is affected by fishing is uncertain. There, the IUCN has listed it locally under Data Deficient while noting its susceptibility to inshore lagoon fisheries and shrimp trawlers, and the urgent need for additional information to ensure its long-term regional survival.|$|E
