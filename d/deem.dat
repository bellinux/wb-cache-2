5|$|It {{is not a}} far {{stretch to}} imagine that if Agnew had contested {{corruption}} charges half as hard as Nixon denied culpability for Watergate – as Goldwater and several other stalwart conservatives wanted him to – today we might be speaking of Agnew-Democrats and Agnewnomics, and <b>deem</b> Agnew the father of modern conservatism.|$|E

5|$|The {{character}} {{has received a}} divisive response.

5|$|On 16 November 1936, Edward invited British Prime Minister Stanley Baldwin to Buckingham Palace and {{expressed}} {{his desire to}} marry Wallis Simpson when she became free to remarry. Baldwin informed him that his subjects would <b>deem</b> the marriage morally unacceptable, largely because remarriage after divorce was opposed by the Church of England, and the people would not tolerate Simpson as queen. As king, Edward was the titular head of the Church of England, and the clergy expected him to support the Church's teachings.|$|E

5|$|The {{last known}} {{observation}} of the frog in the wild {{was that of a}} single male heard calling (but not seen) in 2007. At the time of its last survey in 2009, the IUCN classified E. rabborum as Critically Endangered. More recent estimates <b>deem</b> the species effectively extinct in the wild. A single adult male named Toughie at the Atlanta Botanical Garden was the last known survivor of the species until his death.|$|E
5|$|In North America and elsewhere, some Heathen {{communities}} have formalized such values into an ethical code, the Nine Noble Virtues (NNV), {{which is based}} largely on the Hávamál from the Poetic Edda. There are different forms of the NNV, with the number nine having symbolic associations in Norse mythology. Opinion is divided on the NNV; some practitioners <b>deem</b> them too dogmatic, while others eschew them for not having authentic roots in historical Germanic culture, negatively viewing them {{as an attempt to}} imitate the Judeo-Christian Ten Commandments. The NNV are not universal among Heathens, and it has for instance been noted that they are rare among Swedish practitioners.|$|E

5|$|Kind of Blue is {{a studio}} album by American jazz trumpeter Miles Davis. It is {{regarded}} by many critics as jazz's greatest record, Davis's masterpiece, {{and one of}} the best albums of all time. Its influence on music, including jazz, rock, and classical genres, has led writers to also <b>deem</b> it one of the most influential albums ever recorded. The album was one of fifty recordings chosen in 2002 by the Library of Congress to be added to the National Recording Registry, and in 2003 it was ranked number 12 on Rolling Stone magazine's list of the 500 greatest albums of all time.|$|E
5|$|Some bioethicists <b>deem</b> it {{reasonable}} {{for parents to}} select a child who would have the highest well-being. One criticism of this reasoning is that it often values those with disabilities less. Some parents argue that Down syndrome shouldn't be prevented or cured and that eliminating Down syndrome amounts to genocide. The disability rights movement {{does not have a}} position on screening, although some members consider testing and abortion discriminatory. Some in the United States who are pro-life support abortion if the fetus is disabled, while others do not. Of a group of 40 mothers in the United States who have had one child with Down syndrome, half agreed to screening in the next pregnancy.|$|E
5|$|The {{concession}} conferred on the grantees {{the sole}} rights to mine throughout Lobengula's country, {{as well as}} the power to defend this exclusivity by force, in return for weapons and a regular monetary stipend. Starting in early 1889, the king repeatedly tried to disavow the document on the grounds of alleged deceit by the concessionaires regarding the settled terms; he insisted that restrictions on the grantees' activities had been agreed orally, and apparently considered these part of the contract even though the written text had been translated and repeatedly explained to him just before he signed it. He attempted to persuade the British government to <b>deem</b> the concession invalid, among other things sending emissaries to meet Queen Victoria at Windsor Castle, but these efforts proved unsuccessful.|$|E

5|$|We earnestly {{recommend}} a longer recess from labour at noon, {{and a more}} early dismission from it in the evening, {{to all those who}} work in the cotton mills: but we <b>deem</b> this indulgence essential to the present health, and future capacity for labour, of those who are under the age of fourteen; for the active recreations of childhood and youth are necessary to the growth, vigour, and the right conformation of the human body. And we cannot excuse ourselves, on the present occasion, from suggesting to you, who are the guardians of the public weal, this further very important consideration, that the rising generation should not be debarred from all opportunities of instruction at the only season of life in which they can be properly improved.|$|E
5|$|The {{number of}} hoplites is {{accepted}} as reasonable (and possible); the Athenians alone had fielded 10,000 hoplites at the Battle of Marathon. Some historians {{have accepted the}} number of light troops and used them as a population census of Greece at the time. Certainly these numbers are theoretically possible. Athens, for instance, allegedly fielded a fleet of 180 triremes at Salamis, manned by approximately 36,000 rowers and fighters. Thus 69,500 light troops {{could easily have been}} sent to Plataea. Nevertheless, the number of light troops is often rejected as exaggerated, especially in view of the ratio of seven helots to one Spartiate. For instance, Lazenby accepts that hoplites from other Greek cities might have been accompanied by one lightly armoured retainer each, but rejects the number of seven helots per Spartiate. He further speculates that each Spartiate was accompanied by one armed helot, and that the remaining helots were employed in the logistical effort, transporting food for the army. Both Lazenby and Holland <b>deem</b> the lightly armed troops, whatever their number, as essentially irrelevant to the outcome of battle.|$|E
5|$|The plant {{witnesses}} {{a drop in}} {{its revenue}} due to lower sales of pesticides, {{and in order to}} reduce the loss the officials neglect safety and maintenance. Questioning the chemicals used in the plant, Motwani (Kal Penn), a tabloid reporter publishes reports in his makeshift printing press which are disregarded by most of the officials and workers. Roy (Joy Sengupta), the in-charge for the safety of the plant expresses his concerns. The officials however ignore his warnings, and a worker is killed when a drop of methyl isocyanate leaking from a pipeline lands on his arm. The officials <b>deem</b> the worker's irresponsibility as the cause of the accident and the plant continues to function. Dilip is given a better-paying vacant job in the plant despite lacking the skill to operate machinery. A gas leak is prevented by Roy when water is mixed with methyl isocyanate, and in an attempt to stop people from panicking, the official in the plant sabotages the warning siren.|$|E

5000|$|Under current legislation, all {{middle schools}} must be <b>deemed</b> either primary or secondary.

For statistical purposes, such schools are often included under primary and secondary categories [...] "as deemed". Notably, most schools also follow teaching patterns in line with their <b>deemed</b> status, with most deemed-primary schools offering a primary-style curriculum taught by one class teacher, and most deemed-secondary schools adopting a more specialist-centred approach. Legally all-through schools are also considered middle schools (<b>deemed</b> secondary), although they are rarely referred to as such.|$|R
25|$|Inadmissible oppositions and oppositions {{which are}} <b>deemed</b> {{not to have}} been filed are not substantively {{examined}} (no examination on the merits).

If an opposition is <b>deemed</b> {{not to have been}} filed, an already paid opposition fee is refunded. In contrast, if an opposition is rejected as inadmissible, an already paid opposition fee is not refunded.|$|R
