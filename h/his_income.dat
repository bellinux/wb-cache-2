5|$|Although Adams has {{experimented with}} {{painting}} with watercolor and oil paints (his 1989 covers for Appleseed were rendered {{with a combination}} of ink, watercolor and color pencil), his color work is so sporadic that he says he has to relearn what he has forgotten in the interim each time, and is usually dissatisfied with the results. Because a significant portion of <b>his</b> <b>income</b> is derived from selling his original artwork, he is reluctant to learn how to produce his work digitally.|$|E

5|$|Born in Florida, Cox {{struggled}} in school due to severe dyslexia. His teachers {{advised him to}} get a job in which he worked with his hands, so he studied sculpture at the University of South Florida, and majored in art. Cox took a job as an insurance agent after college, but <b>his</b> <b>income</b> disappointed him, and he sought out higher-paying work.|$|E
5|$|Brosnan {{supplemented}} <b>his</b> <b>income</b> {{by working}} in West End productions {{and in a}} television film about Irish horse racing.

5|$|By 1900, Rodin's artistic {{reputation}} was entrenched. Gaining exposure from a pavilion of his artwork set {{up near the}} 1900 World's Fair (Exposition Universelle) in Paris, he received requests to make busts of prominent people internationally, while his assistants at the atelier produced duplicates of his works. <b>His</b> <b>income</b> from portrait commissions alone totaled probably 200,000 francs a year. As Rodin's fame grew, he attracted many followers, including the German poet Rainer Maria Rilke, and authors Octave Mirbeau, Joris-Karl Huysmans, and Oscar Wilde.|$|E

The cost of maintaining the SEP-IRA is much less, so he would benefit more from that plan.|$|R

Anna left with the children and moved to Paris where van Meegeren visited his children from time to time. He now dedicated himself to portraiture and began producing forgeries to increase <b>his</b> <b>income.</b>|$|E
5|$|Despite {{questions}} about <b>his</b> <b>income,</b> no scandal ever touched Sunday. He was sincerely {{devoted to his}} wife, who also managed his campaigns, but his three sons disappointed him. His audiences grew smaller during the 1920s as Sunday grew older, religious revivals became less popular, and alternative sources of entertainment appeared. Nevertheless, Sunday continued to preach and remained a stalwart defender of conservative Christianity until his death.|$|E
5|$|During the campaign, Corzine {{refused to}} release <b>his</b> <b>income</b> tax return records.

He was the first Corsican to graduate from the École Militaire. He was examined by the famed scientist Pierre-Simon Laplace.|$|E
5|$|The new territories which David {{controlled}} were {{a valuable}} supplement to <b>his</b> <b>income</b> and manpower, increasing {{his status as}} one of the most powerful magnates in the Kingdom of the English.

5|$|Thomas {{came to be}} {{appreciated}} as a popular poet during his lifetime, though he found earning {{a living as a}} writer difficult.

5000|$|On April 16, 1981, Lombardozzi {{was indicted}} {{on charges of}} failing to report <b>his</b> loansharking <b>income</b> in <b>his</b> federal <b>income</b> tax returns. [...] His {{headquarters}} for this racket was a Kiwanis clubhouse in Mill Basin, Brooklyn. He used to meet with Salvatore Stagnate. Lombardozzi and his son Cosmo were close friends of 'Mr Stan', the notorious Serbian criminal Vojislav Stanimirovic responsible for the Vizcaya heist. This connection with the rare non-Italian businessman was Lombardozzi's entry to New York's Diamond District. He was a mentor to the Serbian authority's son Pavle Stanimirović.Fruitless recording efforts by the FBI yielded much discussion of activities that weren't illegal; Lombardozzi prized his Rolls-Royce and wine cellar, though not in that order. 'The Doctor' was considered a class act and Italian elder statesman. With friends and family he avoided the subject of crime but told tales of mafia legends like Lucky Luciano, Meyer Lansky, and his own experience at Apalachin. On April 16, 1981, Lombardozzi was indicted on charges of failing to report <b>his</b> loansharking <b>income</b> in <b>his</b> federal <b>income</b> tax returns.

To supplement <b>his</b> <b>income</b> Brunner began to take on architectural commissions.|$|E
5|$|At {{the same}} time, the emperor Nikephoros Botaneiates tried to {{forestall}} the capital's {{fall to the}} Komnenoi by sending for Melissenos and asking him to enter the city and assume imperial authority. His envoys, however, were obstructed by George Palaiologos and never reached Melissenos. Constantinople fell to the Komnenian forces, and on 8 April 1081, Melissenos too entered the imperial capital. True to his word, Alexios I raised him to Caesar and gave him authority over Thessalonica, as well as allotting the city's revenues to <b>his</b> <b>income.</b> At the same time, however, Alexios raised his brother Isaac Komnenos to the newly created dignity of sebastokrator, which he placed above that of Caesar, bypassing Melissenos.|$|E
5|$|Before long, Chadwick gave Rotblat a {{fellowship}} (the Oliver Lodge Fellowship), doubling <b>his</b> <b>income,</b> {{and in that}} summer of 1939 the young Pole returned home, intending to bring Tola back with him. When {{the time came to}} leave Warsaw in late August, however, she was ill following an operation for appendicitis, and remained behind, expecting to follow within days; but the outbreak of war brought calamity. Tola was trapped, and desperate efforts in the ensuing months to bring her out through Denmark (with the help of Niels Bohr), Belgium, and finally Italy came to nothing, as each country in turn was closed off by the war. He never saw her again; she died in the Holocaust at the Belzec concentration camp. This affected him deeply {{for the rest of his}} life, and he never remarried.|$|E
