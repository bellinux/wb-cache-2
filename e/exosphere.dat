40|$|<b>Exospheres</b> are {{relatively}} {{common in the}} outer solar system among the moons of the gas giant planets. They span the range from very tenuous, surface-bounded <b>exospheres</b> (e. g., Rhea, Dione) to quite robust <b>exospheres</b> with exobase above the surface (e. g., lo, Triton), and include many intermediate cases (e. g., Europa, Ganymede, Enceladus). The <b>exospheres</b> of these moons exhibit an interesting variety of sources, from surface sputtering, to frost sublimation, to active plumes, and also well illustrate another common characteristic of the outer planet satellite <b>exospheres,</b> namely, that the primary species often exists both as a gas in atmosphere, and a condensate (frost or ice) on the surface. As described by Yelle et al. (1995) for Triton, "The interchange of matter between gas and solid phases on these bodies has profound effects on the physical state of the surface and the structure of the atmosphere.

40|$|The {{planetary}} coronae (or <b>exospheres)</b> {{are poorly}} known in their outer parts, since neutraldensities are low {{compared with the}} instruments detection capabilities. The exospheric models are thus often {{the main source of}} information at such high altitudes. We investigate here the importance of a specific exospheric population, i. e. satellite particles, which are usually neglected in the models. These particles are indeed produced through rare collisions in the <b>exospheres,</b> and may either be negligible or dominate the <b>exospheres</b> of all planets with dense atmospheres in our solar system, depending on their production and losses. Here we present a numerical model for estimating the satellite particle density in the planetary <b>exospheres,</b> which is based on the rigorous calculation of the balance between the possible sources and losses of these particles in the outer layers of the atmosphere. As a first step, we applied this model to the Titan environment and to the outermost layers of the terrestrial atmosphere. We also discuss in detail the results of this modeling.

5|$|Due to {{the lack}} of the {{intrinsic}} magnetic field on Venus, the solar wind penetrates relatively deep into the planetary <b>exosphere</b> and causes substantial atmosphere loss. The loss happens mainly via the magnetotail. Currently the main ion types being lost are O+, H+ and He+. The ratio of hydrogen to oxygen losses is around 2 (i.e. almost stoichiometric) indicating the ongoing loss of water.|$|E
5|$|Above the troposphere, the {{atmosphere}} is usually divided into the stratosphere, mesosphere, and thermosphere. Each layer has a different lapse rate, defining {{the rate of change}} in temperature with height. Beyond these, the <b>exosphere</b> thins out into the magnetosphere, where the geomagnetic fields interact with the solar wind. Within the stratosphere is the ozone layer, a component that partially shields the surface from ultraviolet light and thus is important for life on Earth. The Kármán line, defined as 100km above Earth's surface, is a working definition for the boundary between {{the atmosphere}} and outer space.|$|E
40|$|Pickup ions {{formed from}} ionized neutral <b>exospheres</b> in flowing plasmas have phase space {{distributions}} that reflect their source's spatial distributions. Phase space distributions of the ions {{are derived from}} the Vlasov equation with a delta function source using three. dimensional neutral <b>exospheres.</b> The ExB drift produced by plasma motion picks up the ions while the effects of magnetic field draping, mass loading, wave particle scattering, and Coulomb collisions near a planetary body are ignored. Previously, one. dimensional <b>exospheres</b> were treated, resulting in closed form pickup ion distributions that explicitly depend on the ratio rg/H, where rg is the ion gyroradius and H is the neutral scale height at the exobase. In general, the pickup ion distributions, based on three. dimensional neutral <b>exospheres,</b> cannot be written in closed form, but can be computed numerically. They continue to reflect their source's spatial distributions in an implicit way. These ion distributions and their moments are applied to several bodies, including He(+) and Na(+) at the Moon, H(+ 2) and CH(+ 4) at Titan, and H+ at Venus. The best places to use these distributions are upstream of the Moon's surface, the ionopause of Titan, and the bow shock of Venus...|$|R

Thus by studying surface bounded <b>exospheres</b> it is possible to develop insight into the composition and processes that are taking place on the surface and interiors of these objects.

5|$|It {{is thought}} {{that this type of}} {{atmosphere}} loss may be common to all planets orbiting Sun-like stars closer than around 0.1 AU. HD 209458 b will not evaporate entirely, although it may have lost up to about 7% of its mass over its estimated lifetime of 5 billion years. It may be possible that the planet's magnetic field may prevent this loss, because the <b>exosphere</b> would become ionized by the star, and the magnetic field would contain the ions from loss.|$|E
5|$|The {{hydrodynamic}} wind {{within the}} upper {{portion of a}} planet's atmosphere allows light chemical elements such as hydrogen to move up to the exobase, the lower limit of the <b>exosphere,</b> where the gases can then reach escape velocity, entering outer space without impacting other particles of gas. This type of gas loss from a planet into space is known as planetary wind. Such a process over geologic time causes water-rich planets such as the Earth to evolve into planets like Venus. Additionally, planets with hotter lower atmospheres could accelerate the loss rate of hydrogen.|$|E

However, some rings are optically thin: the broad and faint 1986U2R/ζ, μ and ν rings are made of small dust particles, while the narrow and faint λ ring also contains larger bodies. The relative lack of dust in the ring system may be due to aerodynamic drag from the extended Uranian <b>exosphere.</b>|$|E

5|$|The {{opening scene}} is a three-minute computer-generated sequence, {{beginning}} {{with a view of}} Earth from high in the <b>exosphere</b> and listening in on numerous radio waves of modern programming emitting from the planet. The camera then starts zooming backward, passing the Moon, Mars, and other features of the solar system, then to the Oort cloud, interstellar space, the Local Bubble, the Milky Way, other galaxies of the Local Group, and eventually into deep space. As this occurs, the radio signals start to drop out and reflect older programming, representing the distance these signals would have traveled at the speed of light, eventually becoming silent as the distance becomes much greater. The sequence eventually resolves into the iris of young Ellie's eye as she is listening on her amateur radio set. This scale view shot of the entire universe was inspired by the short documentary film Powers of Ten (1977). At the time, it was the longest continuous computer-generated effect for a live-action film, eventually surpassed by the opening sequence from The Day After Tomorrow (2004).|$|E
25|$|The {{upper part}} of the thermosphere, where the mean free path of the {{molecules}} exceeds the scale height, is called the <b>exosphere.</b> The lower boundary of the Uranian <b>exosphere,</b> the exobase, is located at a height of about 6,500km, or 1/4 of the planetary radius, above the surface. The <b>exosphere</b> is unusually extended, reaching as far as several Uranian radii from the planet. It is made mainly of hydrogen atoms and is often called the hydrogen corona of Uranus. The high temperature and relatively high pressure {{at the base of the}} thermosphere explain in part why Uranus's <b>exosphere</b> is so vast. The number density of atomic hydrogen in the corona falls slowly with the distance from the planet, remaining as high a few hundred atoms per cm3 at a few radii from Uranus. The effects of this bloated <b>exosphere</b> include a drag on small particles orbiting Uranus, causing a general depletion of dust in the Uranian rings. The infalling dust in turn contaminates the upper atmosphere of the planet.|$|E

In this first paper, we present the complete solutions of particles trajectories, which are not conics, {{under the influence of the}} solar radiation pressure with some assumptions. This problem is similar to the classical Stark problem (Stark, J. [1914]. Ann. Phys. 348, 965 – 982).

40|$|International audienceWe use {{a simple}} {{analytic}} model {{to examine the}} spatial distribution of a volatile species in a surface-bounded atmosphere on a rotating object that is tidally-locked to its parent body. Spatial asymmetries in such atmospheres have recently been observed via ultraviolet auroral emissions from the <b>exospheres</b> of the icy satellites Europa and Ganymede. The Hubble Space Telescope observations indicate that these satellites host unique, surface-bounded O 2 <b>exospheres</b> which bulge towards dusk. Using a simple 1 -D mass conservation balance we examine {{the nature of the}} volatile source, the surface temperature profile, the spatial morphology of the loss process, and the adsorption and desorption properties of the surfaces to understand the spatial distribution of the surface-bounded atmosphere for a number of objects. Since the ballistic hop distances are much smaller than the satellite radii, we show that the observed asymmetries at Europa and Ganymede can be simply due to a strongly thermally-dependent source, although asymmetries in the plasma-induced loss could contribute. A key condition for these atmospheric bulges that are shifted towards dusk is the relationship between the rotation rate and the atmospheric loss rate...|$|R

25|$|The {{temperature}} of the Mercury's <b>exosphere</b> depends on species as well as geographical location. For exospheric atomic hydrogen, the temperature appears to be about 420K, a value obtained by both Mariner 10 and MESSENGER. The temperature for sodium is much higher, reaching 750–1500K on the equator and 1,500–3,500K at the poles. Some observations show that Mercury {{is surrounded by a}} hot corona of calcium atoms with temperature between 12,000 and 20,000K.|$|E
25|$|The fourth species {{detected}} in Mercury's <b>exosphere</b> was sodium (Na). It {{was discovered in}} 1985 by Drew Potter and Tom Morgan, who observed its Fraunhofer emission lines at 589 and 589.6nm. The average column density of this element is about 1cm−2. Sodium is observed to concentrate near the poles, forming bright spots. Its abundance is also enhanced near the dawn terminator {{as compared to the}} dusk terminator. Some research has claimed a correlation of the sodium abundance with certain surface features such as Caloris or radio bright spots; however these results remain controversial. A year after the sodium discovery, Potter and Morgan reported that potassium (K) is also present in the <b>exosphere</b> of Mercury, though with a column density two orders of magnitude lower than that of sodium. The properties and spatial distribution of these two elements are otherwise very similar. In 1998 another element, calcium (Ca), was detected with column density three orders of magnitude below that of sodium. Observations by the MESSENGER probe in 2009 showed that calcium is concentrated mainly near the equator—opposite to what is observed for sodium and potassium.

Applying new technologies, the mass spectrometers have become increasingly more sensitive. In this study, we show that spacecraft outgassing, which can never be completely prevented, will be the limiting factor in future missions that investigate very tenuous atmospheres and <b>exospheres</b> of moons, asteroids, or comets at large heliocentric distances. The Rosetta Orbiter Spectrometer for Ion and Neutral Analysis (ROSINA) instrument on the European Space Agency Rosetta mission has monitored spacecraft outgassing for 6 years during the cruise phase with unprecedented instrument sensitivity. It is shown that diffusion of gas from materials and from the spacecraft interior {{plays an important role}} in maintaining a relatively permanent thin gas cloud around the spacecraft for many years. The density and composition of this gas cloud depends on location on the spacecraft, maneuvers, and payload activity. The main contaminants are water, which is adsorbed on cold surfaces, and organics from the spacecraft structure, electronics, and insulations.

40|$|The <b>exospheres</b> of Mercury and the Earth's Moon are {{fundamentally}} similar, but {{the differences that}} do exist between them can help us to develop {{a better understanding of}} the processes at work on the two bodies that produce and remove volatiles.

The first difference, surface composition, is the most intractable problem, but the most challenging part of that problem, the composition of the Hermean regolith, may be at least partially addressed as the MESSENGER mission completes work over the next year. Much progress has been made with respect to exploring the second difference above [...] spacecraft such as Helios, Ulysses, WIND, and ACE have measured the solar wind and its composition both in Earth orbit and at distances encompassing the orbit of Mercury. While our knowledge of the solar wind is incomplete, again it is far more detailed than a simple 1 /R(sup 2) law would predict. Another problem is that of the flux of charged particles to the surfaces. While Mercury's magnetosphere is the subject of current study with MESSENGER, the influx of charged particles on the Moon has gone beyond a cos (psi) picture, where psi is the solar zenith angle. We know that the influx of ions at the Moon is affected by magnetic anomalies, by craters, and by surface charging. The third external difference is the differing flux of interplanetary dust incident on the two surfaces. In this talk we will consider: (1) the species that one can compare now for these two <b>exospheres</b> (Na, K, and He); (2) the species that you might be able to compare with future measurements (Ca and Mg); arid (3) how intensive ground-based observations of the easiest lunar species to observe from the ground, Na and K, might help us address source processes at work on both surfaces.
