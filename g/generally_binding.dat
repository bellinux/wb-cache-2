50|$|Most of the {{collective}} agreement policy of IG BAU is centralized. Many of the national collective agreements have been declared <b>generally</b> <b>binding</b> by the German federal government and so apply to all employers and workers in certain sectors like e.g. construction and the building cleaning trades. Because there is no general legal minimum wage in Germany yet the IG BAU lobbied from 1990 onwards for the introduction of sectoral legal minimum wages based on the loewest categories of sector-wide collective agreements and succeeded in 1996. Since that time IG BAU - together with sectoral national employer organisations - has created legal sectoral minimum wages for general construction http://ecmin.efbww.org/default.asp?issue=emwn&language=EN&CID=DEU, demolition, painting, scaffolding, roofing and building cleaning incl hotel cleaning and janitors by collective agreements, which have been declared <b>generally</b> <b>binding</b> by a federal order of the federal labor ministry.

More and more people are questioning the limits of human intervention in nature. What is ethically allowed and what should be prohibited? The WBGU offers some answers to these difficult questions. At the same time it has drawn up a number of principles, which should not be violated, even where there are big economical gains. In addition, in a democratic and culturally diverse society it is the task of ethics to lay down <b>generally</b> <b>binding</b> criteria for balancing between nature-related and, for example, economic matters.

Under traditional fraudulent conveyance law, such a sale was not void against creditors unless it was made in bad faith for insufficient consideration.

5000|$|According {{to present}} doctrine, that of [...] "treaty monism", {{treaties}} {{are in the}} Dutch legal system in principle self-executing; no special transformation is needed by implementing special law, as in countries with a [...] "dualistic" [...] system (such as the United Kingdom). However, when the present articles covering this subject were last revisioned, in 1953, doctrine was divided and some defended a more dualistic position, that of [...] "limited monism". They demanded the constitution to be neutral on this issue and {{this has led to}} some infelicitous results. Government originally intended that Article 93, stating that treaties of a <b>generally</b> <b>binding</b> nature would only have such binding force after they had been published, to be simply a safeguard, protecting the citizen against duties imposed on him by such treaty. However, the [...] "limited monists" [...] held that only such published treaties are self-executing and that thus Article 93 is the basis for all treaty monism; to appease them government stated that the article should in any case be read as covering also the treaties conferring rights on the citizen and imposing duties upon government. The unintended result was that government might thus in principle withhold rights to the citizen by not publishing the treaty. Article 94 determines that legal prescripts are inapplicable if they conflict with treaties of a <b>generally</b> <b>binding</b> nature. This means that laws can be tested against treaty norms and obligations. Dutch courts have however been very reluctant to do so, limiting this to cases where government has been left no freedom of policy at all by the treaty,or to severe formal and procedural defects. The case law is very complex and contradictory, {{complicated by the fact that}} the phrase [...] "generally binding nature" [...] is assumed to have exactly the same meaning in both articles. Article 95 states that law regulates the publication of treaties or (binding) decisions of international organisations; delegation is allowed.|$|E

2500|$|Galectins {{essentially}} bind to glycans featuring galactose and its derivatives. However, physiologically, {{they are}} likely to require lactose or N-aceyllactosamine for significantly strong <b>binding.</b> <b>Generally,</b> the longer the sugar the stronger the interactions. For example, galectin-9 binds to polylactosamine chains with stronger affinity than to an N-acetyllactosamine monomer. This is because more Van der Waals interactions can occur between sugar and binding pocket. Carbohydrate binding is calcium independent, unlike C-type lectins.|$|R

The goal of this thesis is the creation of a meaningful manual for <b>generally</b> <b>binding</b> municipal decree formation, especially how to proceed with GBD formation, what issues can be modified by GBD, GBD functions, and things that should be avoided while forming and approving decree. GBD is a very important legal instrument for regulating municipal administrative matters, residents' conduct, possibly GBD could set the duties that influence the village activities.
