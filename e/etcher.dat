5|$|Stackpole {{was part}} of the foursome that founded, early in 1913, the California Society of Etchers (CSE). The other founders were Robert B. Harshe, an <b>etcher</b> and art {{professor}} at Stanford University, <b>etcher</b> and educator Pedro Lemos, who taught at the San Francisco Institute of Art, and Gottardo Piazzoni, an Italian-American painter and muralist who was Stackpole's master in France. The CSE exhibited twice in 1913, and grew to 78 artist members and five associate after two years. In 1926, the annual publication listed 46 artist members and 156 associate members: Stackpole was still a member. Decades later, the CSE merged with another group to become the California Society of Printmakers.|$|E

50|$|Early 20th century printmaking {{societies}} {{were the}} very influential Chicago Society of <b>Etchers</b> (1910), begun and promoted by Bertha Jaques.

5|$|Other artists {{influenced}} by modernism included James McIntosh Patrick (1907–98) and Edward Baird (1904–49).

They focused on landscape, {{as can be seen in}} McIntosh Patrick's Traquair House (1938) and more overtly Baird's The Birth of Venus (1934). Before his success in painting, McIntosh Patrick gained a reputation as an <b>etcher.</b> Leading figures in the field in the inter-war period included William Wilson (1905–72) and Ian Fleming (1906–94).|$|E

50|$|American print clubs or printmaking {{societies}} were prolific in the 19th century. Their impetus {{was primarily}} exhibition, technical exchange, shared equipment, {{and the promotion}} of printmaking as a fine art, as opposed to a method of reproducing images. The invention of photography meant that reproduction of art works could be achieved photographically instead of through the graphic arts of etching, engraving, and lithography. Thus, these methods of printmaking were freed from their reproducing role to develop as pure fine arts. In addition to the rise of printmaking societies/clubs, individual printmaking artists also sought to distinguish their work as a fine art, as opposed to a craft. Generally these artists from the 19th century were referred to as painter-etchers. Nineteenth century printmaking societies in the United States were the New York <b>Etchers</b> Club (1877), Boston <b>Etchers</b> Club (1880?), Philadelphia Society of <b>Etchers</b> (1880), Brooklyn <b>Etchers</b> Club (1881), Brooklyn Scratchers Club (1882), Society of American <b>Etchers</b> (1888), Cincinnati <b>Etchers</b> Club (circa 1890).|$|R
50|$|In 1909, to popularize {{the medium}} of etching, Bertha Jaques and other <b>etchers</b> in Chicago formed the Needle Club, an {{informal}} collective of <b>etchers</b> passionate about reintroducing the American public {{to the art of}} etching. In 1910 it became the Chicago Society of <b>Etchers.</b> The organization was primarily responsible for showing members’ etchings at the Art Institute of Chicago. It attracted international members and was successful at popularizing etching in 20th-century America.|$|R
5000|$|The California Society of <b>Etchers</b> (CSE) {{merged with}} Bay Printmakers Society in 1968 {{when the current}} name, California Society of Printmakers (CSP), was adopted. Throughout the 1950s and well into the 1980s short {{histories}} of the society penned by various elected officers always referred to CSE/CSP as [...] " [...] the second oldest" [...] continuous operating club in the United States. However, these historians failed to mention what the oldest society was. A little research revealed that the oldest American society of printmakers was the Chicago Society of <b>Etchers.</b> The California Society of <b>Etchers</b> was very aware of its Chicago predecessor, as the Chicago founder Bertha Jaques encouraged printmakers to establish their own local societies. Jaques also joined the California Society of <b>Etchers</b> in 1913, when non-resident members were first admitted. The Chicago Society of <b>Etchers</b> ceased operations in 1956, leaving California Society of Printmakers as the longest lived printmakers' society in the U.S.|$|R

25|$|Kollwitz's {{second major}} cycle of works was the Peasant War, which, subject to many {{preliminary}} drawings and discarded ideas in lithography, occupied her from 1902 to 1908. The German Peasants' War was a violent revolution {{which took place}} in Southern Germany {{in the early years of}} the Reformation, beginning in 1525; peasants who had been treated as slaves took arms against feudal lords and the church. As was The Weavers, this subject, too, might have been suggested by a Hauptmann drama, Florian Geyer. However, the initial source of Kollwitz's interest dated to her youth, when she and her brother Konrad playfully imagined themselves as barricade fighters in a revolution. The artist identified with the character of Black Anna, a woman cited as a protagonist in the uprising. When completed, the Peasant War consisted of pieces in etching, aquatint, and soft ground: Plowing, Raped, Sharpening the Scythe, Arming in the Vault, Outbreak, After the Battle (which, eerily premonitory, features a mother searching through corpses in the night, looking for her son), and The Prisoners. In all, the works were technically more impressive than those of The Weavers, owing to their greater size and dramatic command of light and shadow. They are Kollwitz's highest achievements as an <b>etcher.</b>|$|E
