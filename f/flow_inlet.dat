40|$|Oval {{substrates}} {{are widely}} used in automobiles to reduce the exhaust emissions in Diesel oxidation Catalyst of CI engine. Because of constraints in space and packaging Oval substrate is preferred rather than round substrate. Obtaining the flow uniformity is very challenging in oval substrate comparing with round substrate. In this present work attempts are made to optimize the inlet cone design to achieve the optimal flow uniformity {{with the help of}} CATIA V 5 which is 3 D design tool and CFX which is 3 D CFD tool. Initially length of inlet cone and mass flow rate of exhaust stream are analysed to understand the effects of flow uniformity and pressure drop. Then short straight cones and angled cones are designed. Angled cones have been designed by two methodologies. First methodology is rotating <b>flow</b> <b>inlet</b> plane along the substrate in shorter or longer axis. Second method is shifting the <b>flow</b> <b>inlet</b> plane along the longer axis. Large improvement in flow uniformity is observed when the <b>flow</b> <b>inlet</b> plane is shifted along the direction of longer axis by 10, 20 and 30  mm away from geometrical centre. When the inlet plane is rotated again based on 30  mm shifted geometry, significant improvement at rotation angle of 20 ° is observed. The flow uniformity is optimum when second shift is performed based on second rotation. This present work shows that for an oval substrate flow, uniformity index can be optimized when inlet cone is angled by rotation of <b>flow</b> <b>inlet</b> plane along axis of substrate...|$|E

40|$|The {{intention}} {{of this paper}} is to research the <b>inlet</b> <b>flow</b> distortion influence on overall performance of turboshaft engine and put forward a method called Distortion Factor Item (DFI) to improve the fuel supply plan for surge-preventing acceleration when turboshaft engine suddenly encounters <b>inlet</b> <b>flow</b> distortion. Based on the parallel compressor theory, steady-state and transition-state numerical simulation model of turboshaft engine with sub-compressor model were established for researching the influence of <b>inlet</b> <b>flow</b> distortion on turboshaft engine. This paper made a detailed analysis on the compressor operation from the aspects of performance and stability, and then analyzed the overall performance and dynamic response of the whole engine under <b>inlet</b> <b>flow</b> distortion. Improved fuel supply plan with DFI method was applied to control the acceleration process adaptively when encountering different <b>inlet</b> <b>flow</b> distortion. Several simulation examples about extreme natural environments were calculated to testify DFI method’s environmental applicability.

Encountering <b>inlet</b> <b>flow</b> distortion has many adverse influences such as sudden rotor acceleration, turbine inlet temperature rise and power output reduction.

40|$|In this work, a {{two-dimensional}} mathematical model is developed {{to study the}} flow patterns and volumetric flow penetrations in the flow channel over the porous electrode layered system in vanadium flow battery with serpentine flow field design. The flow distributions at the interface between the flow channel and porous electrode are examined. It is found that the non-linear pressure distributions can distinguish the interface flow distributions under the ideal plug flow and ideal parabolic <b>flow</b> <b>inlet</b> boundary conditions. However, the volumetric flow penetration within the porous electrode beneath the flow channel through the integration of interface flow velocity reveals that this value is identical under both ideal plug flow and ideal parabolic <b>flow</b> <b>inlet</b> boundary conditions.
