5|$|George's mother, the Electress Sophia, died on 28 May 1714 {{at the age}} of 83. She had {{collapsed}} in the gardens at Herrenhausen after rushing to shelter from a shower of rain. <b>George</b> <b>was</b> now Queen Anne's direct heir. He swiftly revised the membership of the Regency Council that would take power after Anne's death, as it was known that Anne's health was failing and politicians in Britain were jostling for power. She suffered a stroke, which left her unable to speak, and died on 1 August 1714. The list of regents was opened, the members sworn in, and <b>George</b> <b>was</b> proclaimed King of Great Britain and Ireland. Partly due to contrary winds, which kept him in The Hague awaiting passage, he did not arrive in Britain until 18 September. <b>George</b> <b>was</b> crowned at Westminster Abbey on 20 October. His coronation was accompanied by rioting in over twenty towns in England.|$|E
5|$|In February 1685, King Charles II died without {{legitimate}} issue, and George's father-in-law, the Roman Catholic Duke of York, became king as James II in England and Ireland and James VII in Scotland. <b>George</b> <b>was</b> {{appointed to}} the Privy Council and invited to attend Cabinet meetings, although he had no power to alter or affect decisions. William of Orange refused to attend James's coronation largely because George would take precedence over him. Although they were both sons-in-law of King James, <b>George</b> <b>was</b> also the son and brother of a king and so outranked William, who was an elected stadtholder of a republic.|$|E

5|$|As a Protestant, <b>George</b> <b>was</b> {{considered}} a suitable partner for the niece of King Charles II of England, Lady Anne. Although they were distantly related (second cousins once removed; {{they were both}} descended from King Frederick II of Denmark), they had never met. <b>George</b> <b>was</b> hosted by Charles II in London in 1669, but Anne had been in France {{at the time of}} George's visit. Both Denmark and Britain were Protestant countries, and Louis XIV was keen on an Anglo-Danish alliance to contain the power of the Dutch Republic. Anne's uncle Laurence Hyde, 1st Earl of Rochester, and the English Secretary of State for the Northern Department, Robert Spencer, 2nd Earl of Sunderland, negotiated a marriage treaty with the Danes in secret, to prevent the plans leaking to the Dutch. Anne's father, James, Duke of York, welcomed the marriage because it diminished the influence of his other son-in-law, Dutch Stadtholder William III of Orange, who was naturally unhappy with the match.|$|E

5|$|<b>George</b> <b>was</b> born in Hanover and {{inherited}} the titles and {{lands of the}} Duchy of Brunswick-Lüneburg from his father and uncles.

At the age of 54, {{after the death of}} his second cousin Queen Anne of Great Britain, George ascended the British throne as the first monarch of the House of Hanover. Although over 50 Roman Catholics were closer to Anne by primogeniture, the Act of Settlement 1701 prohibited Catholics from inheriting the British throne; <b>George</b> <b>was</b> Anne's closest living Protestant relative. In reaction, Jacobites attempted to depose George and replace him with Anne's Catholic half-brother, James Francis Edward Stuart, but their attempts failed.|$|E
