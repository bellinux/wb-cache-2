5|$|Williams {{returned}} with The Hawk Is Dying (2007), also starring Michael Pitt. It {{tells the story}} of George (played by Paul Giamatti), trying to find meaning in his life by training a wild red-tailed hawk. Williams portrayed Pitt's girlfriend, the only person who understands George's growing obsession. The film earned $7,000 domestically playing at one theater. Five months after giving birth, Williams was back, appearing in The Hottest State, a film by Ethan Hawke, adapted from his 1996 book. Critics panned it for being too pretentious and self-aware. Variety writer Leslie Felperin believed the film underused Williams as a former lover of one of the main characters. <b>It</b> <b>did</b> <b>a</b> limited theatrical run beginning August 24, ultimately grossing $137,340. Williams played Edie Sedgwick, muse of Andy Warhol, {{as a part of the}} biographical ensemble piece I'm Not There, inspired by the musician Bob Dylan.|$|E

While a General Contact Unit (GCU) does not strictly need a crew (and could construct artificial avatars when <b>it</b> <b>did),</b> <b>a</b> real human crew adds richness to its existence, and offers distraction during otherwise dull periods. In Consider Phlebas it is noted that Minds still find humans fascinating, especially their odd ability to sometimes achieve similarly advanced reasoning as their much more complex machine brains.|$|E

25|$|The {{decline in}} mining {{here in the}} mid-20th century had {{disastrous}} effects on the city. Many of the abandoned houses and other buildings {{were in danger of}} collapse. Under ownership of the Mexican government, mining came to a near standstill. During this time Pachuca’s economy began to shift from mining to industry. The old Instituto Científico Literario Autónomo de Hidalgo was converted to the Universidad Autónoma del Estado in 1961, which would become one of the impetuses to the growth of the city in the following years, turning out as <b>it</b> <b>did</b> <b>a</b> better-educated and more technical workforce in areas such as law, engineering, business and medicine. In the late 1950s and through the 1960s, some growth was seen in the way of suburban developments for workers in newly built factories.|$|E
25|$|Stephen van Rensselaer {{established}} the Rensselaer School on November 5, 1824 {{with a letter}} to the Rev. Dr. Samuel Blatchford, in which Van Rensselaer asked Blatchford to serve as the first president. Within the letter he set down several orders of business. He appointed Amos Eaton as the school's first senior professor and appointed the first board of trustees. The school opened on Monday, January 3, 1825 at the Old Bank Place, a building {{at the north end of}} Troy. Tuition was around $40 per semester (equivalent to $800 in 2012). The fact that the school attracted students from as far as Ohio and Pennsylvania is attributed to the reputation of Eaton. Fourteen months of successful trial led to the incorporation of the school on March 21, 1826 by the state of New York. In its early years, the Rensselaer School strongly resembled a graduate school more than <b>it</b> <b>did</b> <b>a</b> college, drawing graduates from many older institutions.|$|E
25|$|The {{development}} of Anglo-Saxon kingship is little understood but the model proposed by Yorke, considered the {{development of}} kingdoms and writing down of the oral law-codes {{to be linked to}} a progression towards leaders providing mund and receiving recognition. These leaders who developed in the sixth century, were able to seize the initiative and to establish a position of power for themselves and their successors. Anglo-Saxon leaders, unable to tax and coerce followers instead extracted surplus by raiding and collecting food renders and 'prestige goods'. The later sixth century saw the end of a 'prestige goods' economy, as evidenced by the decline of accompanied burial, and the appearance of the first princely graves and high-status settlements. These centres of trade and production reflect the increased socio-political stratification and wider territorial authority which allowed seventh-century elites to extract and redistribute surpluses with far greater effectiveness than their sixth-century predecessors would have found possible. Anglo-Saxon society, in short, looked very different in 600 than <b>it</b> <b>did</b> <b>a</b> hundred years earlier.|$|E

[...] Nonetheless, she commented that it [...] "... was nowhere near as intense as 'Reciprocity'." [...] IGN writer Ramsey Isler did not think there was anything [...] "particularly remarkable about the core elements of this story – it's the same old formula that both Fringe and The X-Files used frequently – but the episode has a generous helping of little revealing character elements sprinkled throughout." [...] Isler praised the final ten minutes for [...] "provid some really interesting action" [...] with Olivia's ending of the case, and the revelation of Simon's note in conjunction with Sam's knowledge of the First People. He ultimately graded the episode 7.5/10.|$|E
500|$|A {{court of}} enquiry praised the {{surviving}} crew and their dead captain and authorised the award of the Victoria Cross posthumously to Thomas Crisp and Distinguished Service Medals to his son and {{another member of the}} crew. On 29 October 1917, David Lloyd George made an emotional speech in the House of Commons citing Crisp's sacrifice as representative of the Royal Navy's commitment [...] "from the icy waters of the Arctic Ocean to the stormy floods of Magellan", which promoted Crisp into an overnight celebrity whose story ran in all the major London papers for nearly a week, containing as <b>it</b> <b>did</b> <b>a</b> story of personal sacrifice, filial devotion and perceived German barbarity. The medal presentation was made to Tom Crisp Jr. at Buckingham Palace on 19 December 1917, shortly before he was promoted to Skipper in his own right.|$|E
500|$|The PTC {{called on}} the United States Department of Justice and the Judiciary Committees of both houses of Congress to {{investigate}} whether MTV violated child pornography laws in casting teenaged actors in Skins, a remake of the British TV series of the same name. MTV rated Skins [...] "TV-MA", meaning the show is not suitable for audiences under 17. The Los Angeles Times responded in an editorial: [...] "...looking for government remedies is ineffective and unwise; we suspect the network's editors are smart enough to skirt prosecution. The Federal Communications Commission doesn't regulate the content of cable networks, and even if <b>it</b> <b>did,</b> <b>a</b> crackdown on shows like [...] "Skins" [...] would be a bad idea, because adults {{should be able to}} watch whatever they like on cable and federal attempts to protect kids from adult programming have never been successful." ...|$|E

It’s about Snow and thwarted love this week, and that’s always compelling." [...] Oliver Sava of The A.V. Club was more critical of the episode and gave it a C+. He felt that it was [...] "the strongest episode of the series since Rumpelstiltskin’s first" [...] flashback in [...] "Desperate Souls" [...] because <b>it</b> <b>did</b> <b>a</b> better job handling the fairytale storyline. However, Sava faulted it for containing predictable elements, having many of the characters acting stupidly, and for being [...] "painfully obvious while trying to be clever, aiming for poignancy but getting laughs instead." [...] Sava praised Griffiths' performance for [...] "min her wooden dialogue for some real emotional weight." ...|$|E
500|$|The episode {{received}} a polarized critical reaction. Eric Goldman, writing for IGN, gave the episode an 8.5 out of 10, indicating {{that it was}} [...] "great". He called it [...] "the best so far of season three, as <b>it</b> <b>did</b> <b>a</b> nice job of {{going back and forth}} between the mystery of the week, the ongoing rape storyline, and Veronica's personal issues, with each aspect well-represented. While displeased with Hearst's acting, he called the storyline [...] "good, fun stuff". He also enjoyed the emotional advancement of Veronica and Logan's relationship, writing that he showed genuine emotion in the episode, in contrast to his usual sarcastic demeanor. Reviewer Alan Sepinwall, on his blog What's Alan Watching, called it [...] "one of the season's strongest episodes." [...] He elaborated, [...] "With Diane Ruggiero on script, you know there's going to be the funny [...] [...] Plus, we did get a Veronica/Keith team-up, just on the Mystery of the Week instead of the rape arc." [...] Television Without Pity gave the episode a [...] "B".|$|E
500|$|GoldenEye 007 {{introduced}} stealth elements {{not seen}} in previous first-person shooter games. Doak explained how this was implemented: [...] "Whenever you fired a gun, it had a radius test and alerted the non-player characters within that radius. If you fired the same gun again within {{a certain amount of}} time, <b>it</b> <b>did</b> <b>a</b> larger radius test and I think there was a third even larger radius after that. It meant if you found one guy and shot him in the head and then didn't fire again, the timer would reset". Windows throughout the game were programmed so that enemies cannot see through them while the player can. Though decidedly unrealistic, this was an intentional feature made to encourage the player to use windows to covertly spy on enemies. The game's multiplayer mode was added late in the development process; Martin Hollis described it as [...] "a complete afterthought". According to David Doak, the majority of the work on the multiplayer mode was done by Steve Ellis, who [...] "sat in a room with all the code written for a single-player game and turned GoldenEye into a multiplayer game." ...|$|E

500|$|In 2011, Chasen {{was cast}} as Lydia Simmonds, Janine Butcher (Charlie Brooks)'s {{maternal}} grandmother and Norman Simmonds' (George Layton) mother, in the BBC soap opera EastEnders, {{after the original}} actress Margaret Tyzack had {{to pull out of}} the role due to personal reasons. Two episodes featuring Tyzack had already been broadcast, and she featured in a further one on 14April. The producers wanted to keep Lydia in the show as they had plans for her, so Chasen was cast and she replaced Tyzack in the role, beginning filming on 15April [...] for scenes broadcast from 21April. EastEnders executive producer, Bryan Kirkwood, added: [...] "In order to continue the current storyline we've taken the decision for Heather Chasen to take over the role of Lydia." [...] The character died on-screen and Chasen made her last appearance on 13June2011, and, though not credited for <b>it,</b> <b>did</b> <b>a</b> voice-over for the 14and 28 June episodes. Kirkwood later said [...] "Lydia's storyline was perfect" [...] and that Chasen had made the part her own after Tyzack's departure.

500|$|Alan Sepinwall of The Star-Ledger {{said after}} six episodes, he felt [...] "Rock Show" [...] was the episode where the Parks and Recreation {{found the right}} tone for the series and Leslie Knope character. Sepinwall said all the {{characters}} were very likable, the jokes seemed natural and the awkwardness of the show was turned down enough to work properly. The Hollywood Reporter writer Tim Goodman said while the first five episodes of the season had been disappointing, [...] "Rock Show" [...] marked an improvement in which [...] "the characters were more defined, their quirks and rhythms understood". Matt Fowler of IGN {{said he did not}} find the episode especially funny but that <b>it</b> <b>did</b> <b>a</b> good job of fleshing out the characters. He said Chris Pratt was especially funny, and that his band's song [...] "The Pit" [...] was stuck in his head after the episode. The A.V. Club writer Keith Phipps, who had mixed feelings about Parks and Recreation throughout the season, said [...] "Rock Show" [...] was very funny and restored his faith in the potential of the series. Phipps said he believed the show would become very popular in the second season, and that people would later claim to like the first season more than they did the first time they saw it. In October 2009, while reviewing the second season episode [...] "Sister City", A.V. Club writer Leonard Pierce said he believed Parks and Recreation showed a streak of vast improvement that started with [...] "Rock Show" [...] and continued into the second season.|$|E
500|$|On Metacritic, {{the season}} scored 59 out of 100 based on 22 reviews, {{indicating}} [...] "mixed or average reviews". The review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes reported a 69% approval rating {{with an average}} rating of 6.8/10 based on 13 reviews. The website's consensus reads, [...] "Despite some too-hip dialogue and familiar thematic elements, Supernaturals vigilante brothers manage to stir up some legitimate scares." [...] Tanner Stransky of Entertainment Weekly gave the first season a B, saying the show [...] "comes off as weekly installments of a horror movie series", but that [...] "Adding to the show's cred are the '67 Chevy Impala the boys rumble around in and their kick-ass soundtrack". Tom Gliatto of People Weekly ranked the show at number five on his list of the Best TV Shows of 2005. Peter Schorn of IGN gave the season a score of 7 out of 10. While he found the self-enclosed episodes to be [...] "passably entertaining", he enjoyed the story arcs introduced later in the season. Schorn also deemed the [...] "stormy relationship between Sam and his father" [...] to be [...] "compelling", and noted that the lead stars have [...] "good chemistry together". Rick Porter of Zap2it felt that while the season had its [...] "share of emotional moments", it also [...] " [...] the pants off" [...] of viewers [...] "surprisingly well". He also believed that <b>it</b> <b>did</b> <b>a</b> good job at balancing mythology episodes with self-enclosed ones, comparing it to the early seasons of The X-Files. However, Eric Neigher of Slant Magazine highly criticized the self-enclosed episodes for being [...] "almost totally linear, without any B- or C-stories", and felt that the episodes were mainly [...] "watered-down rehashes of classic weird fiction or popular urban legends".|$|E
