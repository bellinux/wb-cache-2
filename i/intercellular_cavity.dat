50|$|An {{amphibian}} embryo in the 128- cell {{stage is}} considered a blastula as the blastocoel in the embryo becomes apparent during this stage. The fluid-filled cavity forms in the animal hemisphere of the frog. However, the early formation of the blastocoel has been {{traced back to the}} very first cleavage furrow. It was demonstrated in the frog embryo that the first cleavage furrow widens in the animal hemisphere creating a small <b>intercellular</b> <b>cavity</b> that is sealed off via tight junctions. As cleavage continues, the cavity expands to become the developed blastocoel. The blastocoel is a crucial component of amphibian embryo development. It permits cell migration during gastrulation and prevents the cells beneath the blastocoel from interacting prematurely with the cells above the blastocoel. For instance, the blastocoel prevents the vegetal cells destined to become endoderm from coming in contact with those cells in the ectoderm fated to give rise to the skin and nerves.|$|E
50|$|Meristematic {{cells are}} incompletely {{or not at}} all differentiated, and are capable of {{continued}} cellular division (youthful). Furthermore, the cells are small and protoplasm fills the cell completely. The vacuoles are extremely small. The cytoplasm does not contain differentiated plastids (chloroplasts or chromoplasts), although they are present in rudimentary form (proplastids). Meristematic cells are packed closely together without <b>intercellular</b> <b>cavities.</b> The cell wall is a very thin primary cell wall.|$|R
40|$|Possible {{mechanisms}} {{behind the}} light-induced wilting of dark-germinated pea (Pisum sativum L.) epicotyls were studied. Illumination with {{photosynthetically active radiation}} caused a fast turgor loss and wilting in the middle segments of the epicotyls accompanied by accumulation {{of water in the}} <b>intercellular</b> <b>cavities.</b> During this process, room temperature fluorescence emission spectra showed gradual bleaching of porphyrin-type pigments, which was lessened by incubating the epicotyls with excess ascorbate before illumination. Detection of singlet oxygen and lipid peroxidation products in the illuminated epicotyls suggested the occurrence of porphyrin-photosenzitized membrane damage as a cause of disordered water status and sequential wilting...|$|R
50|$|The lateral plate {{mesoderm}} splits into parietal (somatic) and visceral (splanchnic) layers. The {{formation of}} these layers {{starts with the}} appearance of <b>intercellular</b> <b>cavities.</b> The somatic layer depends on a continuous layer with mesoderm that covers the amnion. The splanchnic depends on a continuous layer that covers the yolk sac. The two layers cover the intraembryonic cavity. The parietal layer together with overlying ectoderm forms the lateral body wall folds. The visceral layer forms the walls of the gut tube. Mesoderm cells of the parietal layer form the mesothelial membranes or serous membranes which line the peritoneal, pleural and pericardial cavities.|$|R
50|$|Cells or {{organizations}} of cells which produce {{a variety of}} secretions. The secreted substance may remain deposited within the secretory cell itself or may be excreted, that is, released from the cell. Substances may be excreted {{to the surface of}} the plant or into <b>intercellular</b> <b>cavities</b> or canals. Some of the many substances contained in the secretions are not further utilized by the plant (resins, rubber, tannins, and various crystals), while others take part in the functions of the plant (enzymes and hormones). Secretory structures range from single cells scattered among other kinds of cells to complex structures involving many cells; the latter are often called glands.|$|R
40|$|Seagrasses are {{the only}} seed plants to have invaded marine environments successfully. Seagrass fossils are both rare and have {{received}} scant attention so far. However, among {{the limited number of}} plant fossils from marine strata in the Maastrichtian type area, remains of seagrasses are relatively common. The present paper provides {{a detailed description of the}} morphology and anatomy of the stems and attached roots of Thalassocharis bosquetii Debey ex Miquel, 1853, mainly on the basis of silicified material. This has enabled an interpretation of features of the abundant imprints (external moulds) among the specimens studied, inclusive of the type material. Contrary to the outcome of earlier studies, the internodes have been found to constitute leaf scars. T. bosquetii is considered to have been a seagrass, but has a complex stem anatomy, including a substantial central stele with numerous sheathed vascular bundles, an inner cortex with many small <b>intercellular</b> <b>cavities,</b> a middle cortex with distinct fibre strands, and an outer cortex with conspicuously thickened vascular bundles, each of which constricts into a thin vascular strand just below a furrow/pit on the leaf scar. The last-named feature underlies the characteristic stem surface pattern seen in Thalassocharis. The stem anatomy of T. bosquetii is clearly more complex than that of extant seagrasses, which, due to prolonged adaptation to their aquatic habitat, show a more or less reduced anatomy. As far as the complexity of the stele is concerned, T. bosquetii reminds more of some non-marine Alismatales, such as the pondweed family Potamogetonaceae and the monotypical peat bog family Scheuchzeriaceae...|$|R
40|$|Measurements of {{the stable}} carbon isotope ratio (delta C- 13) on annual tree rings offer new {{opportunities}} to evaluate mechanisms of variations in photosynthesis and stomatal conductance under changing CO 2 and climate conditions, especially {{in conjunction with}} process-based biogeochemical model simulations. The isotopic discrimination {{is indicative of the}} ratio between the CO 2 partial pressure in the <b>intercellular</b> <b>cavities</b> and the atmosphere (c(i) /c(a)) and of the ratio of assimilation to stomatal conductance, termed intrinsic water-use efficiency (iWUE). We performed isotope-enabled simulations over the industrial period with the land biosphere module (CLM 4. 5) of the Community Earth System Model and the Land Surface Processes and Exchanges (LPX-Bern) dynamic global vegetation model. Results for C 3 tree species show good agreement with a global compilation of delta C- 13 measurements on leaves, though modeled C- 13 discrimination by C 3 trees is smaller in arid regions than measured. A compilation of 76 tree-ring records, mainly from Europe, boreal Asia, and western North America, suggests on average small 20 th century changes in isotopic discrimination and in c(i) /c(a) and an increase in iWUE of about 27 % since 1900. LPX-Bern results match these century-scale reconstructions, supporting the idea that the physiology of stomata has evolved to optimize trade-offs between carbon gain by assimilation and water loss by transpiration. In contrast, CLM 4. 5 simulates an increase in discrimination and in turn a change in iWUE that is almost twice as large as that revealed by the tree-ring data. Factorial simulations show that these changes are mainly in response to rising atmospheric CO 2. The results suggest that the downregulation of c(i) /c(a) and of photosynthesis by nitrogen limitation is possibly too strong in the standard setup of CLM 4. 5 or that there may be problems associated with the implementation of conductance, assimilation, and related adjustment processes on long-term environmental changes...|$|R
40|$|The pull {{of water}} from the soil to the leaves causes water in the {{transpiration}} stream to be under negative pressure decreasing the water potential below zero. The osmotic concentration also contributes to the decrease in leaf water potential but withmuch lesser extent. Thus, the surface tension force is approximately balanced by a force induced by negative water potential resulting in concavely curved water-air interfaces in leaves. The lowered water potential causes a reduction in the equilibrium water vapor pressure in internal (sub-stomatal/ <b>intercellular)</b> <b>cavities</b> in relation to that over water with the potential of zero, i. e., over the flat surface. The curved surface causes a reduction also in the equilibrium vapor pressure of dissolved CO 2, thus enhancing its physical solubility to water. Although the water vapor reduction is acknowledged by plant physiologists its consequences for water vapor exchange at low water potential values have received very little attention. Consequences of the enhanced CO 2 solubility to a leaf water-carbon budget have not been considered at all before this study. We use theoretical calculations and modeling to show how the reduction in the vapor pressures affects transpiration and carbon assimilation rates. Our results indicate that the reduction in vapor pressures of water and CO 2 could enhance plant water use efficiency up to about 10 % at a leaf water potential of - 2 MPa, and much more when water potential decreases further. The low water potential allows for a direct stomatal water vapor uptake from the ambient air even at sub- 100 % relative humidity values. This alone could explain the observed rates of foliar water uptake by e. g., the coastal redwood in the fog belt region of coastal California provided the stomata are sufficiently open. The omission of the reduction in the water vapor pressure causes a bias in the estimates of the stomatal conductance and leaf internal CO 2 concentration based on leaf gas exchange measurements. Manufactures of leaf gas exchange measurement systems should incorporate leaf water potentials in measurement set-ups...|$|R
40|$|It {{has been}} claimed by many {{investigators}} {{that there is}} protoplasmic continuity between adjacent ceils in certain botanical forms (3). Characteristic of the organisms which have been claimed to exhibit such connections is the red marine alga C-riffithsia globulifera. Practically all adjacent cells of Griffitksia appear to be connected by broad cytoplasmic strands, the plasmodesmae, which traverse pit <b>cavities</b> in the <b>intercellular</b> junction. It has been proposed that this continuity {{is important in the}} transportation of food material and in conduction of stimuli (3). Other authors have suggested that the <b>intercellular</b> pit <b>cavities</b> are closed by a delicate membrane which permits an easier passage of substances from cell to cell, but that unbroken connections are not to be found (2). All such previous studies have been entirely of a morphological nature and were based on microscopic and histological findings. Recently Curtis and Travis (1) have found positive evidence of a physiological nature indicating protoplasmic continuity between adjacent cells in the Purkinje tissue of the ox heart. The present work is an attempt to obtai...|$|R
