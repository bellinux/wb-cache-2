During the air rest, fans are run to supply fresh oxygen and to remove excess CO₁ {{produced}} by <b>grain</b> <b>respiration.</b> The temperature of the air supplied is important as it shouldn't impact on the grain temperature during steeping (10 to 15 °C). The aeration requirements (cubic metres per ton per minute) are higher {{in the second and third}} air rests as the grain metabolic activity is higher. (Air flow rate: 300m3/ton per hour).|$|E

They consider {{different ways in which}} water may leave the grain. A new equation has been developed to take the hysteresis phenomenon into account. The loss of energy through the bin walls, the variation of air pressure in the bin and the <b>grain</b> <b>respiration</b> have been considered. All these concepts can be modelled with a single parameter to give a simple and accurate model which does not need a powerful computer...|$|E
40|$|High {{respiration}} rate of a grain indicates faster degradation of its dry matter. Proper grain management requires chronological and precise measurements {{of carbon dioxide}} evolved from <b>grain</b> <b>respiration</b> during the postharvest storage duration. Therefore the main goal {{of this research was}} to develop a new technique that evaluates temporal corn {{respiration rate}} using pressure sensors. It was based on measuring pressure drop associated with the <b>grain</b> <b>respiration</b> in a closed container and using it to calculate the <b>grain</b> <b>respiration</b> rates. Dry corn (Zea Mays L.) was procured from a local farmer and stored at 4 ºC. Corn rewetting technique was applied A set of eighteen pressure sensor modules were used throughout the course of this study. These modules determine gas productivity for various biological cultures through measuring and recording the cumulative pressure as well as temperatures. A 150 -gram subsample from each moisture level was placed in a glass bottle along with two NaOH vials as well as one silica gel vial. The effects of corn storage temperature (23, 35, and 45 oC) and initial moisture content (12. 9, 14. 8, 17. 0, 18. 8, and 20. 7 % w. b) on the cumulative respiration and respiration rate were studied for duration of nine days. The pressure sensor method was found to be reliable in measuring corn respiration rate as affected by the tested parameters. The highest cumulative respiration of 2. 625 g-CO 2 /kg-corn was observed at the moisture content of 18. 8 % and the medium temperature level of 35 oC after nine days. It was also observed that the respiration rate increased with increases in temperature and peaked out at a temperature of 35 °C. Respiration rates reached their maximum values of 0. 199, 0. 755, 0. 987, and 1. 147 g-CO 2 /kg-corn. d under the medium temperature level of 35 oC and the moisture contents of 14. 8 % (5 th day), 17. 0 % (5 th day), 18. 8 % (3 rd day), and 20. 9 % (2 nd day), respectively. Additionally, an empirical equation to predict the cumulative respiration of corn as affected by storage temperature, moisture content, and storage duration with an adjusted coefficient of determination value of 0. 80. This study recommended that respiration of freshly harvested corn exposed to natural air drying samples should be evaluated...|$|E
40|$|The {{relative}} {{contributions of}} different photosynthetic sites to the filling of the grain in grain sorghum (Sorghum vulgare cv. Brolga) were estimated {{by measuring the}} C in the grain after exposing various leaves and the head to radioactive carbon dioxide. Methods for preventing photosynthesis were also used. Of the grain yield, 93 % was due to assimilation by the head and upper four leaves. The head contribution of 18 % was due equally to direct assimilation of atmospheric carbon dioxide and to reassimilation of carbon dioxide released within the <b>grain</b> by <b>respiration</b> of material translocated from the leaves. The remaining 75 % was equally assimilated by the upper four leaves, the flag leaf being the most efficient contributor per unit area and the third uppermost leaf the least efficient. The percentage contributions to the grain by the flag leaf and fourth leaf, estimated from the decrease in grain yield when they were shaded, agreed closely with the estimates obtained by using CO...|$|R
40|$|Warmth accelerates {{the rate}} of grain growth in wheat, but the {{temperature}} coefficient expressed as Q 10 decreases gradually between 10 and 25 °C. The rate of protein deposition responds more to temperature than the total grain dry matter accumulation rate. Warmth shortens the post-floral phase in cereals. The relation can be approximated by a direct log-linear relationship between temperature and duration, or by a heat sum above a minimum temperature. The proportion of the final amount of nitrogen in the shoot {{taken up by the}} roots after anthesis declines upon increase in the concentration of nitrogen in shoot dry matter at anthesis. The component shoot organs contribute to the total amount of nitrogen relocated from the shoot to the grains in amounts proportional to the amounts of nitrogen present in these organs at anthesis. Instantaneous effects of change in temperature on the apparent photosynthesis rate per plant were small. Differences in apparent photosynthesis per plant, which developed in time between temperature treatments or nitrogen treatments, were primarily attributable to the impact of these factors on {{the rate of}} leaf senescence. Measured respiration rates were compared with theoretically expected rates. There was agreement between calculated and observed growth <b>respiration</b> of <b>grains.</b> Measured <b>respiration</b> rates of non-grain organs (respiration related with maintenance and transport mainly) were considerably greater than theoretically expected rates, especially in roots. A dynamic simulation model is presented that describes and interrelates post-floral gross photosynthesis, <b>respiration,</b> <b>grain</b> growth, uptake and redistribution of nitrogen, and leaf senescence. According to model predictions final grain yield in the field (for Dutch climate and crop management) decreases by 30 - 40 g. m - 2 per degree centigrade rise in temperature throughout grain filling (other input data fixed). This adverse effect of temperature can be offset by a concomitant increase in daily radiation of 130 - 180 J. cm - 2 (PhAR). Yield differences between crops that differ in amount of shoot nitrogen at anthesis only are predicted to be 15 - 20 %. ...|$|R
40|$|The {{effects of}} {{increasing}} rates of Pb, Zn and Cu on extractable heavy metal levels, barley yields, basal respiration and {{the activities of}} catalase, urease, invertase and acid phosphatase were investigated in two soils in a 2 -year greenhouse experiment. In the first year, barley yields were decreased by increasing additions of Pb, Zn and Cu. In the second year, increased yields were recorded at lower rates of addition of all three metals in both the chestnut and chernozem soils. Yield depressions were most marked for added Cu and least marked for Pb but, in contrast, accumulation of heavy metals in grain, in excess of recommended limits, was most pronounced for Pb and did not occur for Cu. Increasing rates of all three metals caused a decrease in basal respiration; the degree of inhibition was generally greater in the second than in the first year. After 1 year of incubation, increasing rates of addition of metals reduced all tested enzyme activities. However, after 2 years, the pattern of response was more complex, with increases in enzyme activities being noted at lower rates of addition of all three metals. In general, invertase and urease activities were more markedly inhibited by heavy metal contamination than those of catalase and phosphatase. Ammonium acetate-extractable heavy metal concentrations in soils were less after 2 years than 1 years reaction time due to their transformation into less labile forms. Significant negative correlations between <b>grain</b> yield, basal <b>respiration</b> and enzyme activities were observed in both years...|$|R
40|$|Reducing grain {{temperature}} is a safe, effective and economic way to minimize damage to grain. It suppresses {{the activity of}} all life forms in a grain storage ecosystem. As a result, it stabilizes the grain during storage, reduces loss and keeps freshness. We conducted trials on grain storage facilities (2800 - 8000 t) in Tianjin, China. The technologies {{are based on the}} following factors: the characteristics of local climate (cold dry winters and hot humid summers), large scale storage structure and grain special requirements. Based on these factors, the researchers devised comprehensive and targeted solutions. For example, the insulation of existing large flat top storage was increased, by using various insulation materials in exterior roofing, interior ceiling, walls, vents, windows and doors, using efficient yet economic insulation material in new storage construction. In winter, we used ventilation by natural and forced aeration to maintain low temperatures. In summer, we used insulation and cooling to achieve temperature control. The technology can effectively reduce grain losses and maintain quality by reducing <b>grain</b> <b>respiration,</b> insect and microbial activities. At the same time, it reduces and avoids chemical pollution, protects the grain and the environment from pollution. It achieves low grain loss, low environmental impact, lower cost; high grain quality, high grain nutrient and high efficiency. It is becoming a new direction in scientific grain storage...|$|E
40|$|The paper {{presents}} the results of a study on the process of moisture diffusion during barley grain storage in a grain storage silo. The moisture migration was caused by concentration gradient. The study was conducted using a model test station and consisted in the measurement of barley grain moisture and temperature in a silo, and in measuring the pressure exerted by the grain bulk on the silo wall. Analysis of the results showed that none of the parameters studied was stable. It was found that when the grain moisture content applied was 16 % in the bottom layer and 10 % in the upper layer the average value of grain moisture content in the silo increased from 13. 2 % to 14. 1 % over the ten days of the process, while with reverse positioning of the layers in the silo the corresponding increase reached 13. 8 %. This was due to additional precipitation of water {{in the course of the}} process of <b>grain</b> <b>respiration.</b> Moisture diffusion caused an increase in the temperature of the grain within the silo (up to 33 Ã‚Â°C at ambient temperature of 16 Ã‚Â°C). Another important effect of the moisture diffusion was the swelling of grains, which caused an increase in the pressure of the barley grain bulk against the silo wall. The highest increase in the wall load was observed at the boundary line between layers of grain of different moisture content levels. The changes in the values of the parameters under study were described by means of regression equations...|$|E
40|$|Large and {{small-scale}} respirometry apparatus {{were developed}} and optimised {{to measure the}} respiration of 25 g and 10 kg seed samples stored under a range of environmental conditions, from 0. 80 to 0. 95 water activity (~) and 15 to 35 °C in all combinations. Respiration of wheat and barley grains was greater, than that of rapeseed and linseed. Oxygen consumption was linear with time for naturally contaminated wheat grain over the range 0. 90 - 0. 95 aw/ 15 - 25 °C and 0. 80 - 0. 95 ~/ 30 - 35 °C, in sterile wheat grain at 0. 90 ~ 125 °C, and in barley and rapeseed at 0. 90 ~ 120 °C but was non-linear in wheat grain at 0. 80 - 0. 85 ~/ 15 - 25 °C, linseed at 0. 88 ~ 120 °C and in autoclaved, reinoculated wheat <b>grain.</b> <b>Respiration</b> of naturally contaminated wheat grain was determined over {{the whole range of}} environmental conditions. Oxygen consumption increased with water activity and temperature. Respiration was comparable whether measured from 25 g or 10 kg samples, allowing the data to be suitable for mathematical modelling. Respiratory quotients (RQ) were generally < 1. 0 and closest to 1. 0 at 0. 95 aw 120 - 35 °C but at 15 °C they exceeded 1. 0 and were closest to 1. 0 at 0. 80 aw • Respirometry was more sensitive than direct weighing for determining dry matter loss (DML) because fungal biomass was not measured. DML values associated with visible moulding, as calculated by oxygen consumption by wheat and barley, were smaller than those considered acceptable for safe storage. During 7 days storage at 0. 85 ~ 125 °C and 0. 90 aw/ 15 °C, conditions usually regarded as safe for short term storage, visible moulding and germination loss occurred with, respectively, as little as 0. 130 % and 0. 085 % DML. A dose of 10 kGy gamma-radiation destroyed all fungal contamination from wheat grain without affecting percentage germination, although seed vigour and respiration were decreased. Using a new dry spore inoculation method, it was shown that Eurotium amstelodami caused more DML in autoclaved than Penicillium aurantiogriseum over 28 days at 0. 85 - 0. 90 ~ 120 °C...|$|E
40|$|Fungal {{spoilage}} of stored grains {{may occur}} when activity of water (aw) in cereal grain exceeds a critical limit enabling mould growth. Because {{it is not}} feasible to maintain all parts of large grain bulks below this critical moisture limit during prolonged storage time, an infection by seed-borne fungi is not rare in cereal grain stored under humid temperate or hot climates, inducing irreversible qualitative losses. Additionally, some fungal species produce harmful mycotoxins. The most harmful toxigenic species belong {{to the group of}} xerophilic species (genera Aspergillus and Penicillium). Because mycotoxin contamination of cereal grain is a worldwide issue for public health and a permanent concern for cereal-food industries facing the challenge of a permanent monitoring mycotoxin content in their primary matters, tolerable levels of mycotoxins are severely regulated worldwide. Mycotoxin-producing species growth is closely dependent of grain moisture levels enabling biological activity in grain ecosystem. Consequently, mould growth in stored grain bulks can be anticipated through early detection of <b>grain</b> and mould <b>respiration.</b> The prevention of mycotoxigenic fungi spoilage of stored grain can be managed by a preventive strategy. The main objective of the review was to describe the different methods, material and practices combined in such an integrated preventive approach. Some solutions potentially acceptable for the decontamination of moderately contaminated grain are also discussed. Integrated management of mould spoilage risks in stored grain is based on five pillars: i/Prevention of mould development by keeping grain moisture below the critical limit of fungal growth; ii/Accurate monitoring of grain aw and temperature changes during the storage period, associated to the monitoring of early indicators of respiration activity of storage fungi; iii/Reduction of grain bulk moistening trends by physical intervention means; iv/Use of physical treatments (ozone, grain peeling or abrasion) to limit mycotoxin contamination transfer to processed cereal products; v/Possible use of bio-competitive strains of fungi or bacteria to prevent the development of mycotoxigenic fungi in grain bulks. The future research needs on this topic are also evocated...|$|R
40|$|Although the {{beneficial}} effects of compost on soil properties are well known, {{there are few}} systematic studies comparing the effects of composts on soils of different textures. The aim of this pot study {{was to assess the}} effects of a single application as mulch of two types of composts derived from different feedstocks, namely C 1 (from garden waste) and C 2 (from agricultural residues and manures) on three soils with different clay contents (46 %, 22 % and 13 %, hereafter referred to as S 46, S 22 and S 13) in terms of their physical, chemical and biological properties as well as on plant growth and nutrient uptake. The composts were placed as 2. 5 -cm-thick mulch layer on the soil surface, and wheat plants were grown for 35 days and to grain filling (70 days). The composts reduced the soil pH by 0. 3 – 0. 7 units, slightly increased total organic C, but increased soil electrical conductivity compared to unamended soil. Soil respiration was significantly higher in S 13 than S 46 in all treatments after 5 weeks. At <b>grain</b> filling, soil <b>respiration</b> was higher in S 13 than in the other two soils and higher with C 2 than with C 1 and in the non-amended soil. The addition of compost significantly increased soil cation exchange capacity (CEC) in S 22 and S 46, but not in S 13 which also had the lowest CEC among the soils. C 2 increased the available P concentration and macro-aggregate stability in all soils compared to C 1 and the unamended soil. Compost addition increased available N in S 46 and S 22 compared to the unamended soil with a stronger effect by C 1. Both composts increased wheat growth and shoot P concentrations with the effect of C 2 being greater than that of C 1. It is concluded that the effect of composts varies with soil type as well as compost type and that this interaction needs {{to be taken into account}} when composts are applied to improve specific soil properties.
