5|$|The {{death of}} an {{individual}} – signified by the tolling of the bell – is thus a treasure buried {{at the bottom of}} a mine: only of value if it is given to someone who makes good use of it. In this he refers to the work of Augustine of Hippo, specifically On Christian Doctrine, in which Augustine describes the knowledge of pagans as gold and silver: something that can be involved in Christian purposes if appropriated properly. Donne, twisting this idea, <b>is</b> <b>arguing</b> that the {{death of an}}y individual is something others can learn from, should they understand it properly.|$|E
5|$|The video {{begins with}} Swift {{entering}} the coffee shop. As she sits down, she notices that couple, opposite {{where she is}} sitting, <b>is</b> <b>arguing,</b> reminding Swift about her parents arguing when she was very young. Then the waiter (Toby Hemingway) comes by, just to take Swift's order, who looks up and she infatuates him, resulting in a romantic relationship between the two. They are seen moving in together and unpacking boxes. After some time of dating, he proposes to her on a rowboat and she cheerfully accepts. Later, the two are seen arguing, resulting in Swift running away from the house, crying, just like she did {{when she was younger}} as she saw her parents arguing. The boyfriend follows her, and the two reconcile the relationship. They get married and have two sons. In the end, time returns to when Swift was ordering her food at the coffee shop. Throughout the video, there are some scenes of Swift singing the verses of the song while walking barefoot on a green pasture amongst photos of her and her family. The photos are hanging on a white string in between two large trees. Swift is seen with her hair loose and wearing a white dress with a thin belt around the waist.|$|E
25|$|Bourdieu's {{ambition}} to unite these sociological traditions, {{which had been}} widely thought to be incompatible, was and remains controversial. The most important concept to grasp is habitus. Crudely put, the habitus is the system of dispositions which individuals have. Sociologists very often look at either social laws (structure) or the individual minds (agency) in which these laws are inscribed. Great sociological arguments have raged between {{those who argue that}} the former should be sociology's principal interest (structuralists) and those who argue the same for the latter (phenomenologists). When Bourdieu instead asks us to consider dispositions, he is making a very subtle intervention in sociology. He has found a middle ground where social laws and individual minds meet and <b>is</b> <b>arguing</b> that our proper object of analysis should be this middle ground: dispositions.|$|E

Similarly, [...] "The Beehive" [...] could <b>be</b> <b>argued</b> to equal 60000 points, as there {{would be at least}} 10,000 bees in a beehive; conversely it could <b>be</b> <b>argued</b> to gain twelve points as the number of bees are not specified.

25|$|In Slattery (Meritor Savings) v. U.S., {{after losing}} before {{a three-judge panel}} of the Federal Circuit, the {{government}} petitioned for a rehearing en banc. The court has agreed to review whether the trial court had the appropriate jurisdiction to hear the breach of contract dispute. The government is further arguing that the FDIC is Non-Appropriated Fund Instrumentality (NAFI), an agency created by the executive branch that receives no funding, and will not receive any funding, from the government. The FDIC receives funding by charging banks fees to member banks. If the en banc court agrees and finds that appropriated funds {{may not be used}} to pay judgments against NAFI's, then any judgment in the Meritor Savings case will be produced by the banks regulated by the FDIC and not by Treasury dollars. In other words, the FDIC could be found to be in breach, but it would be entitled to recover the judgment by member banks. In order to find the FDIC a NAFI, the government <b>is</b> <b>arguing</b> that Congress has no obligation to honor its promises to back deposits with the full faith and credit of the United States.|$|E
25|$|The {{protection}} of photographs in this manner has been criticised on two grounds. Firstly, {{it is argued that}} photographs should not be protected as artistic works, but should instead be protected {{in a manner similar to}} that of sound recordings and films. In other words, copyright should not protect the subject matter of a photograph as a matter of course as a consequence of a photograph being taken. It is argued that {{protection of}} photographs as artistic works is anomalous, in that photography is ultimately a medium of reproduction, rather than creation. As such, it is more similar to a film, or sound recording than a painting or sculpture. Some photographers share this view. For example, Michael Reichmann described photography as an art of disclosure, as opposed to an art of inclusion. Secondly, it is argued that the {{protection of photographs}} as artistic works leads to bizarre results. Subject matter is protected irrespective of the artistic merit of a photograph. The subject matter of a photograph is protected even when it is not deserving of protection. For copyright to subsist in photographs as artistic works, the photographs must be original, since the English test for originality is based on skill, labour and judgment. That said, it is possible that the threshold of originality is very low. Essentially, by this, Arnold <b>is</b> <b>arguing</b> that whilst the subject matter of some photographs may deserve protection, it is inappropriate for the law to presume that the subject matter of all photographs is deserving of protection.|$|E

The paper gives a short outline of human rationality {{as a matter of}} following plans and it <b>is</b> <b>argued</b> how this perspective is mirrored in some of the dominant conventional learning theories. Inspired by Lave and Wenger’s (1991) approach to situated learning the heterogeneous aspect of practice is highlighted and it <b>is</b> <b>argued</b> that we analytically need to distinguish between learning to master specific elements in various communities of practice and to orient oneself in a multiple-contextual practice.

She also discusses the breakdown she had during the tour. After the interlude, the singer {{is back on the}} stage wearing a yellow dress, performing [...] "Unfaithful" [...] on a platform. Then, she sings [...] "Hate That I Love You" [...] while sitting on a chair and then [...] "California King Bed" [...] as the last song from the set. Scenes of Rihanna having fun with her fans and making a birthday party for her manager Jay Brown is shown. Scenes of the singer in Madrid, one week before Christmas are shown; she takes a tour in the bus with which they are traveling around Europe. Rihanna is then shown getting ready for the show before starting to perform [...] "What's My Name?" [...] in daisy duke accompanied with four female dancers. She performs [...] "Rude Boy" [...] and is accompanied with male dancers wearing colorful outfits. Before performing [...] "Cheers (Drink to That)" [...] she takes a shot of a drink. The set is followed with [...] "Don't Stop the Music" [...] and finishes with Rihanna performing [...] "Take a Bow" [...] together with the audience. Before the encore starts, scenes of Rihanna preparing for the show are shown. She <b>is</b> <b>arguing</b> with the tour director how the set should arranged, because she wants to add [...] "We Found Love" [...] to it. She then rehearses for the choreography of the latter song alongside with her dancers and explains how she learned the whole dance for 30 minutes. Her choreographer Tunisha praises and calls her [...] "a dope". Then, the last set starts with a man who wears glasses performing on a piano. Rihanna then emerges and sits on the top of it. At one point of the performance the piano started levitating and when the songs ends the piano is again on the background. The music then transitions to [...] "Umbrella"; the performance features golden drops on the LED screens. Loud Tour Live at the O2 finishes with Rihanna performing [...] "We Found Love" [...] as the final song; the end of the performance features red confetti flying around.|$|E

[...] According to Vendler, [...] "Each quatrain introduces a new and important modification in concept and tone, while the couplet—here a [...] "reversing" [...] couplet contradicting {{the body of the}} sonnet—adds yet a fourth dimension". [...] In other words, Vendler <b>is</b> <b>arguing</b> that each section of the poem offers new insight and content; therefore, there are four distinct parts or [...] "dimensions" [...] of the sonnet—each quatrain is not merely expressing the same idea, while the couplet is not simply summarizing the quatrains.|$|E

2500|$|Paul's letters {{contain a}} {{substantial}} amount of criticism of [...] "works of the law". The radical difference in these two interpretations of what Paul meant by [...] "works of the law" [...] is the most consistent distinguishing feature between the two perspectives. The historic Lutheran and Reformed perspectives interpret this phrase as referring to human effort to do good works in order to meet God's standards (Works Righteousness). In this view, Paul <b>is</b> <b>arguing</b> against the idea that humans can merit salvation from God by their good works alone (note that the [...] "new" [...] perspective agrees that we cannot merit salvation; the issue is what exactly Paul is addressing).|$|E
40|$|It <b>is</b> <b>argued</b> that Husserl <b>was</b> an “externalist” in {{at least}} one sense. For it <b>is</b> <b>argued</b> that Husserl held that {{genuinely}} perceptual experiences—that is to say, experiences that are of some real object in the world—differ intrinsically, essentially and as a kind from any hallucinatory experiences. There is, therefore, no neutral “content” that such perceptual experiences share with hallucinations, differing from them only over whether some additional non-psychological condition holds or not. In short, it <b>is</b> <b>argued</b> that Husserl <b>was</b> a “disjunctivist”. In addition, it <b>is</b> <b>argued</b> that Husserl held that the individual object of any experience, perceptual or hallucinatory, is essential to and partly constitutive of that experience. The argument focuses on three aspects of Husserl’s thought: his account of intentional objects, his notion of horizon, and his account of reality...|$|R

Also, there is an implication, never quite stated, that Abernethy's motive might be venal; that jealousy (for example) might be revealed by [...] "a consideration of the real motives" [...] (phrase from his long initial footnote). It is absolutely clear that the conflict predates the publication of Lawrence's book.|$|E
2500|$|A {{slightly}} different issue involving a cross {{on a military}} base—but erected separately from a chapel as a memorial to marines killed in Afghanistan—involves a 13-foot cross erected {{on top of a}} hill at Marine Corps Base Camp Pendleton, in California. The American Center for Law & Justice <b>is</b> <b>arguing</b> {{on the part of those}} who erected the cross that it should be allowed to stay because [...] "crosses are used as a widespread and universal symbol of remembrance," [...] not just as religious symbols, while other groups, such as the Military Association of Atheists and Freethinkers, are arguing that the cross should not be allowed to remain. A similar cross was erected in 2003, but was destroyed in a fire, so the new cross has been created with [...] "fire-retardant" [...] material.

Do I get to be rude then?", and shuts the door in her face. Andrew repeatedly breaks the rules during Season 1, infuriating Bree, who eventually humiliates him by turning up at the strip club he is visiting with his friends while grounded. Bree does later apologize to Andrew (who also admits how much he misses his father) for lying to him, but removes the door to his room in punishment for him smoking marijuana.|$|E

2500|$|Hume {{explains}} {{his theory of}} Causation and causal inference by division into three different parts. In these three branches he {{explains his}} ideas, in addition to comparing and contrasting his views to his predecessors. These branches are the Critical Phase, the Constructive Phase, and Belief. In the Critical Phase, Hume denies his predecessors' theories of causation. Next, Hume uses the Constructive Phase to resolve any doubts the reader may have while observing the Critical Phase. “Habit or Custom” mend the gaps in reasoning that occur without the human mind even realizing it. Associating ideas has become second nature to the human mind. It “makes us expect for the future, a similar train of events with those which {{have appeared in the}} past” [...] However, Hume says that this association cannot be trusted because the span of the human mind to comprehend the past is not necessarily applicable to the wide and distant future. This leads Hume to the third branch of causal inference, Belief. Belief is what drives the human mind to hold that expectancy of the future based on past experience. Throughout his explanation of causal inference, Hume <b>is</b> <b>arguing</b> that the future is not certain to be repetition of the past {{and the only way to}} justify induction is through uniformity.|$|E
2500|$|Feyerabend {{was also}} {{critical}} of falsificationism. He argued that no interesting theory is ever consistent {{with all the}} relevant facts. This would rule out using a naïve falsificationist rule which says that scientific theories should be rejected {{if they do not}} agree with known facts. Feyerabend uses several examples, but [...] "renormalization" [...] in quantum mechanics provides an example of his intentionally provocative style: [...] "This procedure consists in crossing out the results of certain calculations and replacing them by a description of what is actually observed. Thus one admits, implicitly, that the theory is in trouble while formulating it in a manner suggesting that a new principle has been discovered" [...] Feyerabend is not advocating that scientists do not make use of renormalization or other ad hoc methods. Instead, he <b>is</b> <b>arguing</b> that such methods are essential to the progress of science for several reasons. One of these reasons is that progress in science is uneven. For instance, in the time of Galileo, optical theory could not account for phenomena that were observed by means of telescopes. So, astronomers who used telescopic observation had to use ad hoc rules until they could justify their assumptions by means of optical theory.|$|E
2500|$|David Bindman classifies All Religions are One as [...] "a rather {{abstract}} {{dialogue with}} conventional theology," [...] {{and in this}} sense, it is often interpreted as Blake's earliest engagement with deism and dualism. Similarly, Northrop Frye argues that Blake's theory that all religions are one is a [...] "visionary tolerance" [...] {{at odds with the}} [...] "rational tolerance" [...] of deism [...] "which holds that all religions are equally an attempt to solve an insoluble mystery." [...] Working along the same lines, Florence Sandler argues that in these texts Blake [...] "set himself to the task of separating true religion from its perversions in his own age and in the Bible itself." [...] Also concentrating on the refutation of deism, Alicia Ostriker refers to the series as a [...] "mockery of rationalism and an insistence on Man's potential infinitude." [...] S. Foster Damon suggests that what Blake has done in All Religions are One is [...] "dethroned reason from its ancient place as the supreme faculty of man, replacing it with the Imagination." [...] Damon also argues that [...] "Blake had completed his revolutionary theory of the nature of Man and proclaimed the unity of all true religions." [...] Harold Bloom reaches much the same conclusion, suggesting that Blake <b>is</b> <b>arguing</b> for the [...] "primacy of the poetic imagination over all metaphysical and moral systems." [...] A similar conclusion is reached by Denise Vultee, who argues that [...] "the two tractates are part of Blake's lifelong quarrel with the philosophy of Bacon, Newton, and Locke. Rejecting the rational empiricism of eighteenth-century deism or [...] "natural religion", which looked to the material world for evidence of God's existence, Blake offers as an alternative the imaginative faculty or [...] "Poetic Genius"." ...|$|E
