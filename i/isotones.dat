40|$|AbstractThe {{solution}} of the complementarity problem defined by a mapping f:Rn→Rn and a cone K⊂Rn consists of finding the fixed points of the operator PK∘(I-f), where PK is the projection onto the cone K and I stands for the identity mapping. For the class of <b>isotone</b> projection cones (cones admitting projections <b>isotone</b> {{with respect to the}} order relation they generate) and f satisfying certain monotonicity properties, the solution can be obtained by iterative processes (see G. Isac, A. B. Németh, Projection methods, <b>isotone</b> projection cones, and the complementarity problem, J. Math. Anal. Appl. 153 (1) (1990) 258 – 275 and S. Z.

In this note it is shown that the projection of an arbitrary point onto an <b>isotone</b> projection cone in Rn can be obtained by projecting recursively at most n- 1 times into subspaces of decreasing dimension.
