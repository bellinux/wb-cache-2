5|$|Mephedrone {{is often}} {{consumed}} with alcohol. A study in mice investigated the interrelation {{between these two}} substances, focusing on the psychostimulant and rewarding properties of mephedrone.

This effect was mediated {{by an increase in}} synaptic dopamine, as haloperidol, but not ketanserin, was able to block the potentiation by alcohol. Similarly, the rewarding properties of mephedrone were <b>enhanced</b> <b>by</b> a low non-rewarding dose of alcohol.|$|E
