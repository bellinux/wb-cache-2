Paul. [...] Paul, a convicted drug dealer who would soon after be convicted on stock fraud charges after being extradited from Brazil, stated that he spent $1.2 million to produce the August 12, 2000 Hollywood Gala Salute to President William Jefferson Clinton event, which was both a tribute to honor President Clinton and a fundraiser for the First Lady's 2000 Senate campaign. The Justice Department indictment charged Rosen with filing false reports with the Federal Election Commission by reporting only $400,000 in contributions. On May 27, 2005, the jury acquitted Rosen on all counts. [...] On January 5, 2006 {{it was reported that}} Clinton's campaign group agreed to pay a $35,000 fine related to the underreporting of the fundraiser's expenses.|$|E
2500|$|The Truth in Lending Act of 1968 (TILA) {{resulted}} in honest reporting of effective APRs {{for more than}} a decade. [...] Then in the 1980s, auto makers (and providers of some other durable goods) began to exploit a loophole in the Act and its implementing regulations. Since the Act does not precisely define [...] "Finance Charge" [...] or [...] "Total Sale Price" [...] (terms used in the TILA disclosures), auto makers found they could reduce <b>Finance</b> <b>Charges</b> and increase car price as much as they wanted, provided Total Sale Price was not changed. APRs calculated with the reduced, or eliminated, finance charge became the [...] "below market rate" [...] and [...] "Zero percent APR' loans that were commonly advertised for the next 30 years. [...] "Zero percent APR or $1,000 rebate" [...] is {{the most common form of}} these deceptive loans. [...] The [...] "rebate" [...] is the hidden finance charge, reclassified to car price. [...] If the consumer doesn't accept the [...] "zero percent loan," [...] then he or she does not accrue the extra $1,000 interest on that loan, and this $1,000 is represented as a [...] "rebate." [...] In reality, there is no rebate and no [...] "zero percent loan." ...|$|E
50|$|For a 12-month loan, 12/78s of the <b>finance</b> <b>charge</b> is {{assessed}} as {{the first}} month’s portion of the <b>finance</b> <b>charge,</b> 11/78s of the <b>finance</b> <b>charge</b> is assessed as the second month’s portion of the <b>finance</b> <b>charge</b> and so on until the 12th month at which time 1/78s of the <b>finance</b> <b>charge</b> is assessed as that month’s portion of the <b>finance</b> <b>charge.</b> Following the same pattern, 24/300 of the <b>finance</b> <b>charge</b> is assessed {{as the first}} month’s portion of a 24-month precomputed loan.|$|R
50|$|The Rule of 78s {{deals with}} precomputed loans, which are loans whose <b>finance</b> <b>charge</b> is {{calculated}} before the loan is made. <b>Finance</b> <b>charge,</b> carrying charges, interest costs, {{or whatever the}} cost of the loan may be called, can be calculated with simple interest equations, add-on interest, an agreed upon fee, or any disclosed method. Once the <b>finance</b> <b>charge</b> has been identified, the Rule of 78s is used to calculate the amount of the <b>finance</b> <b>charge</b> to be rebated (forgiven) in the event that the loan is repaid early, prior to the agreed upon number of payments. It should be understood that with precomputed loans, a borrower not only owes the lender the principal amount borrowed, but the borrower owes the <b>finance</b> <b>charge</b> as well. If $10,000 is lent and the precomputed <b>finance</b> <b>charge</b> is $3,000, the borrower owes the lender $13,000 at the time the loan is made, whereas a simple interest borrower owes the lender only the $10,000 principal and monthly interest on the unpaid principal.|$|R

40|$|The {{payday loan}} {{industry}} is a highly debated provider of alternative financial services (AFS). The varied regulations implemented across states which include <b>finance</b> <b>charge</b> regulation, loan term regulation, loan amount regulation, and bans attempt to shift consumers away from this industry to mainstream credit options that increase consumer welfare in the long-run. Using the Current Population Survey Unbanked/Underbanked Supplement from 2009 and 2011, I analyze the effectiveness of each type of legislation that exists across states in these years. Looking at payday loan use, alternative financial service use to cash checks, and alternative financial service use {{to take out a}} money order within the year preceding the survey, I find that <b>finance</b> <b>charge</b> regulations are most effective in shifting consumers away from payday loans and maximum loan term and fee regulations are most effective in shifting consumers away from AFS for money orders. Looking at demand side effects, I find that <b>finance</b> <b>charge</b> regulations are effective because they reduce the probability that a consumer finds payday loans more comfortable, more convenient, or easier to get than bank loans...|$|R
