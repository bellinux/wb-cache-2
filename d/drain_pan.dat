50|$|Ceiling {{protection}} switches {{are installed}} in secondary condensate <b>drain</b> <b>pan</b> in split system HVAC applications. The switch has a buoyant component that floats when the secondary condensate <b>drain</b> <b>pan</b> fills {{with water from}} the primary <b>drain</b> <b>pan</b> and shuts down the HVAC system to avoid overflowing. The ceiling protection switch is mainly used in applications where a piece of HVAC equipment is located in an attic or interior space where water damage is likely to occur. The switch does not guarantee the prevention of overflow, but may reduce the amount. Overflow water occurs when the condensate drain line becomes clogged restricting the flow of condensation from the interior to {{the exterior of the}} space. Overflow also occurs when an indoor HVAC coil becomes frozen, which when thaws creates excess water.|$|E

Representative bacterial colony types recovered from heterotrophic plate count cultures on R 2 A medium were identified to the genus level. Budding bacteria belonging to the genus Blastobacter dominated the supply surface of the coil fins, the <b>drain</b> <b>pan</b> water, and the postcoil air. These data and independent scanning electron microscopy indicated that a resident population of predominantly Blastobacter bacteria was present as a biofilm on the supply-side cooling coil fins...|$|E

40|$|This study {{developed}} a fungal biosensor {{to verify the}} germicidal effect of ultraviolet germicidal irradiation (UVGI) systems in the field from a biosensor originally developed to assess indoor climate. A UVC ray was irradiated on the fungal spores of the biosensors at various doses, and the differences in hyphal length after subsequent incubation were observed to verify the susceptibility of the fungal biosensor to C-band ultra-violet (UVC). The results showed reasonable correla-tions between UVC dosage and hyphal length. These fungal biosensors were thereafter attached to the coil and the <b>drain</b> <b>pan</b> of an air handling unit with a UVGI system installed and exposed to UVC for 1 h to test {{the effectiveness of the}} biosensors on the UVGI systems in the field. The hyphal lengths observed after incubation corresponded with UVC doses of 468 – 1620 Jm 2 at each sampling point as shown in the previous suscept-ibility experiments. The extended experiments to con-firm the susceptibility of the fungal spores showed that the spores were more sensitive to UVC ray than those of the fungal biosensor and had similar susceptibility to the same UVC doses even at different UVC intensities...|$|E
40|$|HVAC Heating Ventilation and Air {{conditioning}} is {{the largest}} consumer of energy in commercial and industrial buildings. HVAC systems account for an approximated 50 of energy use in buildings. The sources of contamination and odour comes from the growth of bacteria mold and fungus that accumulate and develop on wet surfaces of HVAC coils and drain pans causing respiratory infection cough tight chest and wheezing. Besides the effects on human health Fungal contamination that adheres to the fins of cooling coil of air handling unit AHU cause {{a significant increase in}} pressure drop across the coil and decrease in heat exchange efficiency which Leeds to loss of cooling capacity and additional energy use. To prevent the fungal and microorganism growth on the cooling coil and <b>drain</b> <b>pan</b> of HVAC systems many studies conducted but not all these solutions were sufficient to remove microbial organism from the HVAC 100. The UV-C light options through a process known as UVGI Ultraviolet germicidal irradiation is a technology showed a significant impact to produce clean air and improve indoor air quality 16. UVGI lights produce short wavelength light kills microorganisms including viruses bacteria mold and many other fungi by disrupting their DNA. The effectiveness of UVGI installed inside HVAC systems depends on many factors and the application Methods in HVAC systems. A few studies showed whether the use of UVGI results in energy saving. The objective {{of this study is to}} find the effect of fungal growth on the cooling coil surface by using field measurements at actual operating conditions of heat transfer and air flow for a non-irradiated coil in comparison to irradiated coil. Hence evaluate if there would be an enthalpy change at the coil and document the effectiveness of UVGI coil cleaning on restoring cooling capacity and save energy...|$|E
2500|$|UVGI {{can be used}} to {{disinfect}} air with prolonged exposure. Disinfection is a function of UV intensity and time. For this reason, it is not as effective on moving air, or when the lamp is perpendicular to the flow, as exposure times are dramatically reduced. Air purification UVGI systems can be free-standing units with shielded UV lamps that use a fan to force air past the UV light. Other systems are installed in forced air systems so that the circulation for the premises moves microorganisms past the lamps. Key to this form of sterilization is placement of the UV lamps and a good filtration system to remove the dead microorganisms. [...] For example, forced air systems by design impede line-of-sight, thus creating areas of the environment that will be shaded from the UV light. However, a UV lamp placed at the coils and <b>drain</b> <b>pans</b> of cooling systems will keep microorganisms from forming in these naturally damp places.|$|R
40|$|Copper {{and copper}} alloy metal {{surfaces}} have an intrinsic ability to inhibit {{the growth of}} algae, fungi/molds, viruses and bacteria. Studies confirm that these surfaces are effective antimi-crobial agents that kill microbes within hours. In today’s modern buildings, concerns about exposure to toxic microorganisms have created a dire need to improve the hygienic conditions of heating, ventila-tion and air conditioning (HVAC) systems, which {{are believed to be}} factors in over 60 % of all sick building situations (Collet and Associates). The combination of copper’s superior resistance to mold growth and excellent thermal conductivity can improve the energy efficiency of the systems in which it is installed. Using antimicrobial copper and copper alloy metals instead of biologically inert materials in heat exchanger tube, fins, filters and condensate <b>drain</b> <b>pans</b> is recommended as a viable and cost-effective means to help control the growth of fungi and bacteria that thrive in these dark and damp components of HVAC systems. The antimicrobial properties of un-coated copper and copper alloy metals are continuously effective and do not diminish over time. In fact, they are enhanced with the natural formation of a self-protective corrosion film (tarnish) (Michels 2005). Improvements to indoor air quality are also anticipated. Prominent pathogenic risks in HVAC systems include Legionella, sp, and molds, such as Aspergillus niger...|$|R

40|$|The authors {{assessed}} {{relationships between}} health symptoms in office workers and risk {{factors related to}} moisture and contamination, using data collected from a representative sample of U. S. office buildings in the U. S. EPA BASE study. Methods: Analyses assessed associations between three types of weekly, workrelated symptoms-lower respiratory, mucous membrane, and neurologic-and risk factors for moisture or contamination in these office buildings. Multivariate logistic regression models were used to estimate the strength of associations for these risk factors as odds ratios (ORs) adjusted for personal-level potential confounding variables related to demographics, health, job, and workspace. A number of risk factors were associated (e. g., 95 % confidence limits excluded 1. 0) significantly with small to moderate increases in one or more symptom outcomes. Significantly elevated ORs for mucous membrane symptoms were associated with the following risk factors: presence of humidification system in good condition versus none (OR = 1. 4); air handler inspection annually versus daily (OR = 1. 6); current water damage in the building (OR = 1. 2); and less than daily vacuuming in study space (OR = 1. 2). Significantly elevated ORs for lower respiratory symptoms were associated with: air handler inspection annually versus daily (OR = 2. 0); air handler inspection less than daily but at least semi-annually (OR= 1. 6); less than daily cleaning of offices (1. 7); and less than daily vacuuming of the study space (OR = 1. 4). Only two statistically significant risk factors for neurologic symptoms were identified: presence of any humidification system versus none (OR = 1. 3); and less than daily vacuuming of the study space (OR = 1. 3). Dirty cooling coils, dirty or poorly <b>draining</b> <b>drain</b> <b>pans,</b> and standing water near outdoor air intakes, evaluated by inspection, were not identified as risk factors in these analyses, despite predictions based on previous findings elsewhere, except that very dirty cooling coils were associated with a nonsignificant increase in lower respiratory symptoms. These preliminary findings suggest that some factors that indicate risks for moisture or contamination in office buildings may have adverse effects on respiratory or neurologic health of office workers. More refined analyses are underway that will include these risk factors in simultaneous multivariate models along with additional risk factors that may be confounders, such as ventilation rate and indoor temperature. Future analyses will also use more refined metrics for both health outcomes and environmental risks, as well as assess risk in susceptible sub-groups...|$|R
40|$|Nonspecific building-related {{symptoms}} among {{occupants of}} modern office buildings worldwide are common {{and may be}} associated with important reductions in work performance, but their etiology remains uncertain. Characteristics of heating, ventilating, and air-conditioning (HVAC) systems in office buildings that increase risk of indoor contaminants or reduce effectiveness of ventilation may cause adverse exposures and subsequent increase in these symptoms among occupants. We analyzed data collected by the U. S. EPA from a representative sample of 100 large U. S. office buildings [...] the Building Assessment and Survey Evaluation (BASE) study [...] using multivariate logistic regression models with generalized estimating equations adjusted for potential personal and building confounders. We estimated odds ratios (ORs) and 95 % confidence intervals (CIs) for associations between seven building-related symptom outcomes and selected HVAC system characteristics. Among factors of HVAC design or configuration: Outdoor air intakes less than 60 m above the ground were associated with approximately doubled odds of most symptoms assessed. Sealed (non-operable) windows were associated with increases in skin and eye symptoms (ORs= 1. 9, 1. 3, respectively). Outdoor air intake without an intake fan was associated with an increase in eye symptoms (OR= 1. 7). Local cooling coils were associated with increased headache (OR= 1. 5). Among factors of HVAC condition, maintenance, or operation: the presence of humidification systems in good condition was associated with an increase in headache (OR= 1. 4), whereas the presence of humidification systems in poor condition was associated with increases in fatigue/difficulty concentrating, as well as upper respiratory symptoms (ORs= 1. 8, 1. 5). No regularly scheduled inspections for HVAC components was associated with increased eye symptoms, cough and upper respiratory symptoms (ORs= 2. 2, 1. 6, 1. 5). Less frequent cleaning of cooling coils or drip pans was associated with increased headache (OR= 1. 6). Fair or poor condition of duct liner was associated with increased upper respiratory symptoms (OR= 1. 4). Most of the many potential risk factors assessed here had not been investigated previously, and associations found with single symptoms may have been by chance, including several associations that were the reverse of expected. Risk factors newly identified in these analyses that deserve attention include outdoor air intakes less than 60 m above the ground, lack of operable windows, poorly maintained humidification systems, and lack of scheduled inspection for HVAC systems. Infrequent cleaning of cooling coils and <b>drain</b> <b>pans</b> were associated with increases in several symptoms in these as well as prior analyses of BASE data.

50|$|The Nata River or Manzamnyama River is {{a natural}} {{watercourse}} in Southern Africa. It is an ephemeral river flowing in Zimbabwe and Botswana. It has a length of 330 km from its source to mouth, 210 km in Zimbabwe and 120 km in Botswana. Its total catchment area is 24,585 km2. The river originates in Sandown (S20.425036˚, E28.180660˚), a small farming town located on the Zimbabwean central watershed 50 km south west of Bulawayo and ends in the Makgadikgadi Pans (S20.348816˚, E26.240166˚) in Botswana. There is no outlet from the salt pans which {{can be considered as}} the “dead sea” of the south. The upper reaches of the river are located in a commercial farming area where good environmental and farming practices have resulted in the river experiencing very little siltation/sedimentation. Impressive sedimentation starts occurring about 65 km along the river course marking the beginning of a 90 km stretch in Zimbabwe where the river passes through communal farming areas. It is on this stretch where the sand-abstraction potential of the river is realised and communities rely on the sand river water for domestic, farming and livestock purposes. Within the country of Botswana the Nata River is a source of water to the ephemeral wetlands of the Makgadikgadi Pans, where a number of species of limited distribution thrive.

40|$|A {{recently}} abandoned artesian bore drain in south-western Queensland was sampled {{to investigate}} soil morphology and chemistry under, and adjacent to, the drain. Such drains are supplied with alkaline, sodium-rich artesian groundwater and {{they provide a}} long-term example of the impacts of these waters on soils. A Red Kandosol and a Grey Vertosol were sampled, in the drain and at 2, 4 and 25 m perpendicular to the drain. Morphological attributes indicative of long-term saturation, such as mottling, were evident around the drains, but were absent at the control sites (25 m away). At the Kandosol location, pH and exchangeable sodium were elevated within 4 m of the drain, and salinity data suggested a horizontally displaced wetting front at ∼ 4 m from the drain. In the Grey Vertosol, which was naturally saline and sodic below 0. 5 m, substantial leaching of salts had occurred around the drain, but a horizontal wetting front was also evident and exchangeable sodium was increased within 4 m of the drain. A thin, weak pan was detected in the subsoil of the Red Kandosol under the <b>drain</b> bank, but <b>pans</b> were otherwise absent under the drains. The results indicate that deep drainage is a feature {{not only of the}} Red Kandosol, but also the Grey Vertosol, despite it being sodic and despite the application of sodic, alkaline water. The findings reiterate the importance of investigating soil and water chemistry interactions when designing channels, storages and irrigation systems, in particular those using sodic-saline waters...|$|R

The new lubricant is poured into the transmission through the filler hole, located at the right hand side of the transmission tcase. Pour sufficient lubricant in unti lit reaches the level of the filler hole.; Lubricating the Differential, Every 5000 miles the lubricant in the differential should be drained and the housing flushed with kerosene. New lubricant should then be added until it reaches the level of the oil filler hole in the housing. In the truck the lubricant in the differential must be kept up {{to the level of the}} filler plug oppening at all times.; Engine Lubrication, All parts of the engine are lubricated from the oil reservoir in the oil pan by the Ford Pump, Splash and Gravity Feed. Only high grade engine oil should be used in the engine. Oil of this kind reaches the bearing surfaces with greater east and cuts down frictional heat. It should have sufficient body so that the pressure between the two bearing surfaces will not force out the oil and allow the metal to come in actual contact. Inferior oils have a tendency to carbonize quickly, also "gu m up" the piston rings, valve stems and bearings. In cold weather a light grade of oil having a low cold test is absolutely essential for the proper lubrication of the car. In general an oil having the body S. A.
