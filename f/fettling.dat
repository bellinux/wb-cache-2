60|$|But Ursula {{was with}} her father. As she became adolescent, thirteen, fourteen, she set more and more against her mother's {{practical}} indifference. To Ursula, there was something callous, almost wicked in her mother's attitude. What did Anna Brangwen, in these years, care for God or Jesus or Angels? She was the immediate life of to-day. Children were still being born to her, she was throng with all the little activities of her family. And almost instinctively she resented her husband's slavish service to the Church, his dark, subject hankering to worship an unseen God. What did the unrevealed God matter, when a man had a young family that needed <b>fettling</b> for? Let him attend to the immediate concerns of his life, not go projecting himself towards the ultimate.|$|E

He is getting his saddle altered: <b>fettling</b> about this and that; does not {{consider}} what danger he is in. This same Sunday, his Major met him on the street of Berlin; said, in a significant tone, [...] "You still HERE, Katte!"--"I go this night," [...] answered Katte; but he again put it off, did not go this night; and the order for his arrest did come in. On the morrow morning, Colonel Pannewitz, hoping now he was not there, went with the rhadamanthine order; and finding the unlucky fellow, was obliged to execute it. Katte lies in ward, awaiting what may be prepared for him.|$|E
60|$|But the Epic of Reality cares {{nothing for}} such considerations; {{and the time}} {{allowable}} for capture of Dresden is very brief. Had Daun, on getting warning, been as prompt to return as he was to go, frankly fronting at once the chances of the road, {{he might have been}} at Dresden again perhaps within a week,--no Siege possible for Friedrich, hardly the big guns got up from Magdeburg. But Friedrich calculated there would be very considerable <b>fettling</b> and haggling on Daun's part; say a good Fortnight of Siege allowed;--and that, by dead-lift effort of all hands, the thing was feasible within that limit. On Friedrich's part, as we can fancy, there was no want of effort; nor on his people's part,--in spite of his complainings, say Retzow and the Opposition party; who insinuate their own private belief of impossibility from the first. Which is not confirmed by impartial judgments,--that of Archenholtz, and others better. The truth is, Friedrich was within an inch of taking Dresden by the first assault,--they say he actually could have taken it by storm the first day; but shuddered at the thought of exposing poor Dresden to sack and plunder; and hoped to get it by capitulation.|$|E

50|$|The {{process begins}} by {{preparing}} the puddling furnace; this involves bringing the furnace {{to a low}} temperature and then <b>fettling</b> it. <b>Fettling</b> {{is the process of}} painting the grate and walls around it with iron oxides, typically hematite; this acts as a protective coating keeping the melted metal from burning through the furnace. Sometimes finely pounded cinder was used instead of hematite. In this case the furnace must be heated for 4-5 hours to melt the cinder and then cooled before charging.|$|E

50|$|The {{existing}} {{track was}} extremely maintenance heavy, consuming {{a great deal}} of time and effort on basic <b>fettling</b> and alignment works to keep the track in a good condition. The desire was to lay the extension to a standard whereby it would be considerably more hardwearing, therefore requiring less maintenance in general. The use of large hardwood jarrah sleepers along with the 30lb rail, large lipped plates and large coach screws gave a very chunky track form, and has generally performed well over the years.|$|E

50|$|Stone {{quarrying}} {{was a major}} {{industry in}} Grenoside from a very early date until it ceased in 1939. The stone quarried in Grenoside varied in quality and was put to several uses. The finer grained, hard stones were much in demand as grindstones for the cutlery trade and for fine <b>fettling</b> and finishing in iron foundries. Coarse grained stone was used for furnace lining and from these were hewn the stone boxes used in the Cementation process of steelmaking. In 1860 the following are named as quarry owners in Grenoside - Thomas Beever, George Broadhead, George Firth, Thomas Lint, Joseph Swift and Charles Uttley.|$|E

He became accepted as the elder statesman of British racing journalists due to his closeness to the teams and drivers, his conversational writing style and his obvious and enduring passion for the sport.|$|E

Following World War II a new laboratory block was added adjacent to the Sheffield Road entrance.

50|$|The 0-4-0ST {{locomotive}} preserved at Beamish Museum is {{the former}} Seaham Harbour Dock Company No.18. It was built in 1877 (Works No.683) as a well tank, later modified with side 'wing' tanks and in 1936 outshopped as a saddle tank after extensive rebuilding at the Seaham Harbour Engine Works.The above dates {{are a result of}} new research by the curator currently charged with restoring the locomotive to working order (as a saddle tank) and can be verified against assumptions made in some established texts. The locomotive was supplied to the Londonderry Railway, who operated Seaham Harbour, transferring to the SHDC in 1899 upon the latter's incorporation. Withdrawn from service in 1969/70, the locomotive was condemned as a working engine, later being transferred to the collection at Beamish (The North of England Open Air Museum). In 1977 it was 'restored' to its as-built appearance by Laings of Hartlepool, returning to Beamish where it was operated for four years. It was later loaned to a group based at Padiham Power Station, though their restoration attempt failed. Returned to Beamish it was placed on display with some work to restore it being completed before a serious bid was commenced in 2005. Now returned to steam, the loco has run a few times at Beamish, with some <b>fettling</b> still to do. It made a brief visit back to its former home of Seaham in 2011.|$|E
