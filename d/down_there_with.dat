500|$|The Rangers {{decided that}} Feldman would begin 2009 as a middle reliever, and Kris Benson {{would be a}} starter. [...] "Feldman makes us a better team in the bullpen", {{explained}} Washington. [...] "He goes <b>down</b> <b>there</b> <b>with</b> better stuff than he had before."

500|$|The {{following}} morning Kennedy and Edelman met with Secretary of Agriculture Orville Freeman, and angrily criticized the food stamp program for charging families {{that had no}} income. Freeman deflected, [...] "Bob, there isn't anyone in America who has no income." [...] Kennedy replied, [...] "I'll tell you what. I'll send Peter [...] here back <b>down</b> <b>there</b> <b>with</b> some of your people... Will you agree that you'll change the regulations if your people are convinced there really are people in Mississippi who have no income?" [...] Freeman agreed, and was eventually persuaded by incoming evidence to open up access to food stamps.|$|E
500|$|Co-showrunner Wyman {{also served}} as episode director, marking his {{television}} directorial debut. He noted his love of the experience, as it permitted him to grow closer with the series' actors and [...] "actually work with them on a level that [...] before and really get <b>down</b> <b>there</b> <b>with</b> them." [...] Wyman was originally supposed to direct several episodes the previous year and earlier in the season, but found he was too busy. He explained, [...] "Then an episode was coming up that we were thinking about writing and I really felt close to it. [...] The opportunity came up where somebody had fallen out and I felt {{that this is the}} perfect time because everything was completely under control. [...] It allowed me to go and do it. [...] It's an episode that's really close to me. [...] It's about love and it's about all the great things that we talk about on Fringe." ...|$|E

500|$|By general {{critical}} consent the libretto of [...] {{is a work}} of poor quality. The weak plot, as Bizet's biographer Winton Dean observes, {{turns on}} the unlikely coincidence regarding Leila's necklace, and no real effort is made in the text to bring any of the characters to life: [...] "They are the regulation sopranos, tenors, etc., with their faces blacked". Mina Curtiss, in her book on Bizet, dismisses the text as banal and imitative. Donal Henahan of The New York Times, writing in 1986, said that the libretto [...] "rank right <b>down</b> <b>there</b> <b>with</b> the most appallingly inept of its kind". The writers themselves admitted its shortcomings: Cormon commented later that had they been aware of Bizet's quality as a composer, they would have tried harder. Carré was worried about the weak ending, and constantly sought suggestions for changing it; Curtiss records that in exasperation, the theatre manager Carvalho suggested that Carré burn the libretto. This facetious remark, Curtiss asserts, led Carré to end the opera with the fishermen's tents ablaze as Leila and Nadir make their escape.|$|E
500|$|In {{preparation}} for the 2012–13 season, Gannon signed defenders Sean Newton and James Tunnicliffe, and took back Paul Turnbull on loan once again. However, he was disappointed to lose striker Tom Elliott, who rejected a contract offer to switch to Cambridge United. He also appointed long-time associate Alan Lord as his assistant. However County found themselves struggling in the league, and Gannon blamed the predicament on the board's decision to slash the wage budget in the summer. An angry Lord Snape told the press that [...] "I'm getting pretty fed up of watching part-time teams beat Stockport County. Changes {{are going to be}} made unless things improve. Jim Gannon's pretty good at telling me how this club should be run. Well I'm going to tell him that I'm not impressed by the way the team is being run. If we lose a couple of our next games, we're in a relegation battle with a much bigger budget than most of the teams <b>down</b> <b>there</b> <b>with</b> us, which quite frankly is not good enough." [...] Fourteen months into his second spell at Edgeley Park and with County sitting in the relegation zone, Gannon was relieved of his duties as Stockport manager on 16 January 2013 following the 3–1 home defeat by Mansfield Town.|$|E
2500|$|New Jersey Governor Chris Christie, {{who flew}} back to the state from New Hampshire during his presidential campaign, left to resume campaigning shortly after the storm passed. He was criticized for his quick {{departure}} and heated responses to questions about why he left the state. He stated that while there was some locally significant flood damage in Southern New Jersey, the overall effects across the state did not warrant his presence. He responded to one person by saying, [...] "I don’t know what {{you expect me to}} do. You want me to go <b>down</b> <b>there</b> <b>with</b> a mop?" [...] A Stockton University graduate started up a fund to provide 1,000mops to Christie in response to his comment. On January26, Christie apologized to North Wildwood Mayor Patrick Rosenello for calling him [...] "crazy" [...] during his response to criticism the day prior. Christie also requested that Rosenello apologize on his behalf to first responders, residents, and business owners.|$|E

2500|$|Mozart also {{supervised}} the Vienna {{premiere of the}} work, which took place on 7 May 1788.

He also made some cuts in the Finale {{in order to make}} it shorter and more incisive, the most important of which is the section where Anna and Ottavio, Elvira, Zerlina and Masetto, Leporello reveal their plans for the future (""). In order to connect [...] "" [...] ("It must have been the ghost she met") directly to the moral of the story [...] "" [...] ("This is the end which befalls to evildoers"), Mozart composed a different version of [...] "" [...] ("So the wretch can stay <b>down</b> <b>there</b> <b>with</b> Proserpina and Pluto!").

Spin ranked the record third in its list of the [...] "50 Best Albums of 2011", concluding that [...] "It doesn't feel hyperbolic to suggest that someone somewhere needed to hear this music just as badly as Anderson needed to make it." [...] Anthony Carew from About.com named it the fourth best album of 2011. Corey Beasley of PopMatters ranked the record sixth in his list of the best indie rock albums of 2011.

50|$|NCAA and NFL rules, plus {{high school}} {{football}} in Massachusetts and Texas, dictate that when a safety occurs during a two-point conversion or point-after kick (officially known in the rulebooks as a try), it is worth one point. It can be scored by the offense {{in all of the}} above organisations (following an NFL rule change in 2015) if the defense obtains possession of a live ball in the field of play, propels the ball (by carrying it or fumbling it) into its own end zone, and then is <b>downed</b> <b>there</b> <b>with</b> the defense in possession of the ball. This event has only occurred twice in NCAA Division I history. Before 2015, the only scenario in which a one-point safety could have been scored in the NFL would have involved the defense kicking or batting a loose ball out the back of the end zone without taking possession of it.|$|R
