Above the altar is a painting by Andrea dell'Asta of The Martyrdom of St. Andrew. The boxed ceiling dates to 1702 and its artwork includes the Flagellation, the Crucifixion of the Apostle, and the Dell'Asta's 1710 Miracle of the Manna. The triumphal arch is held up by two Egyptian granite columns. There are two additional twisted columns and two pulpits {{that were part of}} the 12th century ambo.

50|$|Glass {{may be used}} {{which is}} transparent, {{translucent}}, or opaque, or in varying degrees thereof. Transparent glass usually refers to vision glass in a curtain wall. Spandrel or vision glass may also contain translucent glass, which could be for security or aesthetic purposes. Opaque glass is used in areas to <b>hide</b> a <b>column</b> or spandrel beam or shear wall behind the curtain wall. Another method of hiding spandrel areas is through shadow box construction (providing a dark enclosed space behind the transparent or translucent glass). Shadow box construction creates a perception of depth behind the glass that is sometimes desired.|$|R

50|$|American {{architect}} Francis Swales, {{who trained}} at the École Nationale Supérieure des Beaux-Arts in Paris, was briefed to design the frontispiece. Aided by British architects R. Frank Atkinson and Thomas Smith Tait, the final design was highly influenced by John Burnet's 1904 extension to the British Museum. The steel supporting <b>columns</b> are <b>hidden</b> behind Ionic <b>columns,</b> to create a facade which present a visually uniform, classical, Beaux-Arts appearance. The distinctive polychrome sculpture above the Oxford Street entrance {{is the work of}} British sculptor Gilbert Bayes. The final frontage, through use of cast iron window frames to a maximum size of 19 ft by 12 ft, means that both the Oxford Street and Duke Street frontages are made up of more glass than stone or iron works.|$|R

5000|$|The {{basic model}} which {{inspired}} building most Holy Trinity columns is the Pestsäule or Dreifaltigkeitssäule ("Plague or Holy Trinity column") in the Grabenplatz, Vienna, built after the 1679 plague; in this monument the column has entirely disappeared in marble clouds and colossal saints, angels and putti. The era of these religious structures culminated with the outstanding Holy Trinity Column in Upper Square (Horní náměstí) in Olomouc. This monument, built {{shortly after the}} plague which struck Moravia (nowadays in the Czech Republic) between 1714 and 1716, was exceptional because of its monumentality, rich decoration and unusual combination of sculptural material (stone and gilded copper). Its base was made so big that even a chapel was <b>hidden</b> inside.

40|$|During my Internship at NASA in {{the summer}} of 2016, I was {{assigned}} to a project which dealt with developing a web-server that would display telemetry and other system data using HTML 5, JavaScript, and CSS. By doing this, {{it would be possible to}} view the data across a variety of screen sizes, and establish a standard that could be used to simplify communication and software development between NASA and other countries. Utilizing a web- approach allowed us to add in more functionality, as well as make the displays more aesthetically pleasing for the users. When I was assigned to this project my main task was to first establish communication with the current display server. This display server would output data from the on-board systems in XML format. Once communication was established I was then asked to create a dynamic telemetry table web page that would update its header and change as new information came in. After this was completed, certain minor functionalities were added to the table such as a <b>hide</b> <b>column</b> and filter by system option. This was more for the purpose of making the table more useful for the users, as they can now filter and view relevant data. Finally my last task was to create a graphical system display for all the systems on the space craft. This was by far the most challenging part of my internship as finding a JavaScript library that was both free and contained useful functions to assist me in my task was difficult. In the end I was able to use the JointJs library and accomplish the task. With the help of my mentor and the HIVE lab team, we were able to establish stable communication with the display server. We also succeeded in creating a fully dynamic telemetry table and in developing a graphical system display for the advanced modular power system. Working in JSC for this internship has taught me a lot about coding in JavaScript and HTML 5. I was also introduced to the concept of developing software as a team, and exposed to the different types of programs that are used to simplify team coding such as GitLab. While in JSC, I took full advantage of and attended the lectures that were held here on site. I learned a lot about what it is NASA does and about the interesting projects that are conducted here. One of the lectures I attended was about the selection process and the criteria that is used to select future astronauts for flight missions. This truly had an impact on my future plans as it showed me that this path was a viable option for me. After this internship I plan on completing my undergraduate course work and plan to move on for a masters degree. However, during the time in which I will be completing my masters course work, I would like to apply for the NASA pathways graduate program and, if I am accepted, eventually move on to being a full time civil servant. Working in NASA has not only been enjoyable, but full of information and great experiences that have motivated me to seek a full time employment here in the near future...|$|R

As {{part of a plan}} to remove aging, blighted buildings, a demolition crew was contracted to tear down the old building with a wrecking ball. It was soon obvious that something unusual was present when the wrecking ball could tear right through the front wall at some places, but the heavy ball bounced off other spots. The invincible spots were found to be the five limestone <b>columns</b> <b>hidden</b> behind bricks for generations. (A few of the columns still carry wrecking ball scars.)

40|$|I {{review the}} {{progress}} {{made on the}} physics of black hole systems {{in the context of}} the analogy between AGN and microquasars that was proposed one decade ago. If the emerging empirical correlations between the observational properties of stellar and supermassive black holes will become more robust, we will use them to determine the mass and spin of black holes, independently of theoretical models. Microquasars are fossils of sources of Gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) of long duration, and their kinematics provides observational clues on the physics of collapsars. If jets in GRBs, microquasars and AGN are due to a unique universal magnetohydrodynamic mechanism, synergy between the research on these three different classes of cosmic objects will lead to further progress in black hole physics and astrophysics. The potential contributions with INTEGRAL in this field of research are also discussed. It is shown that the Galactic Plane Survey (GPS) with INTEGRAL is unraveling new extragalactic sources of hard x-rays behind the Milky Way, as well as new black hole high-mass binaries that were <b>hidden</b> by large <b>columns</b> of gas and dust.

5000|$|Birnbaums use of deconstructed {{television}} footage to make Technology/Transformation: Wonder Woman {{has been}} noted for its potential criticism of television and its modalities. The videos reception at time of release read as a [...] "paragon of feminist critique," [...] in opposition to mass medias gendered stereotypes. Technology/Transformation: Wonder Woman has remained relevant, however, as its fast paced, repetitive aesthetic with a woman subject resonates with contemporary aesthetics. The videos reception shifted from one of subversive deconstruction towards an affirmative image making of the female body. Another way the video constructs positive body politics is through its representations of the male figure juxtaposed with the woman. In an interview with BOMB magazine from 2009, Birnbaum says: [...] "...A purposeful strategy that I have not talked about previously, that {{is the image of}} men included in works….

50|$|The Heine-Velox V12 had a low-slung {{appearance}} {{because the}} body was mounted to the frame from the sides, instead of the top, which also provided more structural rigidity and a low center of gravity. The two headlights, mounted high on the fenders (giving a kind of bug-eyed look), contained both high and low beams, operated by a switch. Rather than roll up or down, Heine windows pivoted and could be locked in position. Luggage could be stored in lockable boxes on the running boards, {{as well as in}} places on all sides of the car. An easy to spot interior innovation was the tilting of the dashboard to 45 degrees, which was supposed to be more comfortable for the driver and would <b>hide</b> the steering <b>column,</b> as well as positioning of the handbrake and gear selector which did not require leaning. Heine demonstrated his car to Chevrolet and demanded to see the head engineer. He was pointed in his direction, leaving the car unattended, and the car was stolen. The following year Chevrolet released a car with pivoting windows. Heine's car had many other innovations, including an oil level automatically maintained by gravity, and a cold-weather start system operated from the dash. The Blackhawk Collection claims the cars were as powerful as the Duesenbergs of the day.|$|R
50|$|The 1900 Exposition was {{the largest}} and most {{successful}} of them all, occupying most of the space along the Seine from the Champs-de-Mars and Trocadero to the Place de la Concorde. The Grand Palais, the largest exhibition hall, was designed by architect Henri Deglane, assisted by Albert Louvet. Deglane had been an assistant to Dufert, the builder of the Palace of Machines. The new building contained an enormous gallery, whose arches converged to create a monumental glass dome. Though its visible iron framework made it appear very revolutionary and modern, much of its iron work purely decorative; the gothic iron columns which seemed to support the dome did not carry any weight; the weight was actually distributed to reinforced <b>columns</b> <b>hidden</b> behind the balconies. The facade was massive and neoclassical, with towering rows of columns supporting two sculptural ensembles. It served both to give a strong vertical element to balance the great width of the building, and to conceal the glass and steel structure behind. It was also designed to be in harmony with the historic buildings nearby, including the buildings around the Place de la Concorde and the 17th century church of Les Invalides {{on the other side of}} the Seine. The facade was greatly admired and widely imitated; a similar facade was given to the New York Public Library in 1911.|$|R
5000|$|The saga of 1st Lt. J. T. Williams from Garland, TX, {{was typical}} of the Oflag 64 POWs who decided to go it alone rather than stay with the column as it headed west. Lt.

He and a sergeant were the only survivors. He was captured two days later trying to get back to American lines. On January 21, 1945, Lt. Williams was one of the POWs who departed Oflag 64. After covering about 80 miles by January 29, he found a place to <b>hide</b> when the <b>column</b> marched out. He remained in a recently evacuated POW camp for Polish and French officers and dodged German patrols for five days until [...] "recaptured" [...] by Russian troops. Lt. Williams may have no longer been a POW but he was not out of danger. The day of his liberation, German artillery shelled the camp killing a number of Polish and Yugoslav ex-POWs that had collected at the camp. On his own, he made is way toward Warsaw over the next 10 days on foot, truck, train and wagon. Depending on handouts of food and clothing from Polish civilians and Russian soldiers, he at one point shared a boxcar with Jewish refugees recently released from nearby death camps. In his diary, he described Warsaw as [...] "...a pitiful sight. Not a soul living here. Absolutely flat." [...] He spent a week outside Warsaw where he was finally able to connect with other Americans including some who had been at Oflag 64. After a week, he was able to board a train for Odessa, Russia, arriving on March 1, where they were immediately placed under Russian armed guard in a warehouse. Lt. Williams departed Odessa a week later on a British freighter after delivering Lend-Lease supplies. After transferring ships in Istanbul, Port Said, Egypt, and Naples, Italy, he arrived in Boston aboard the SS Mariposa on April 8, 1945.|$|R
