The package implements random generation of contingency tables over individuals with or without <b>intraclass</b> <b>correlations</b> under various sampling plans.

40|$|Twin {{studies of}} child {{temperament}} using objective measures consistently suggest moderate heritability for most dimensions.

The 'too low' DZ correlations {{can be explained by}} parent-rating biases that either exaggerate the differences between DZ twins (contrast effects) or that inflate the similarity of MZ twins (assimilation effects), or by the presence of non-additive genetic variance. To evaluate the three possible explanations, we used model-fitting procedures applied to parent-rating data averaged across 14, 20, 24, and 36 months of age in a sample of 196 twin pairs participating in the MacArthur Longitudinal Twin Study.

The known determinants of left ventricular hypertrophy only partially explain its variability. The {{purpose of this study was}} to estimate heritability of left ventricular mass. The study sample included adults in the original Framingham Heart Study and the Framingham Offspring Study who were not receiving antihypertensive medications and who were free of coronary heart disease, congestive heart failure, diabetes mellitus, renal insufficiency, valvular heart disease, and severe left ventricular hypertrophy. <b>Intraclass</b> <b>correlations</b> for left ventricular mass among first-degree relatives, second-degree relatives, and unrelated spouse pairs were calculated to determine the contribution of heredity to the variability in left ventricular mass. After adjustments for age, height, weight, and systolic blood pressure, the <b>intraclass</b> <b>correlations</b> between first-degree relatives were. 15 (parent-child, P<. 001) to. 16 (siblings, P<. 001), between second-degree relatives the correlation was. 06 (P=NS), and between spouses it was. 05 (P=NS). The estimated heritability of adjusted left ventricular mass was between. 24 and. 32. The proportion of the variance in sex-specific left ventricular mass explained by age, height, weight, and systolic blood pressure was. 26 in men and. 34 in women. On the basis of <b>intraclass</b> <b>correlations</b> for left ventricular mass, incorporation of adjusted left ventricular mass of a parent or sibling would increase the explained variance by an additional. 02 to. 03. Heredity explains a small, but discernible proportion of the variance in left ventricular mass.
