40|$|In undulating landscapes erosion {{is largely}} {{responsible}} for the spatial distribution of C stocks in agricultural soils. Whether these stocks contribute to global atmospheric CO 2 concentrations as source or sink of CO 2 is under constant debate. Periodic CO 2 measurements were carried out at a hummocky ground moraine site grown with maize, <b>fodder</b> <b>rye</b> and sorghum using dynamic non-steady-state transparent and opaque chambers. Flux calculation for CO 2 was conducted using the empirical gap-filling model of Hoffmann et al. (2015 b), which uses temperature and radiation to simulate ecosystem respiration (Reco) and gross primary production (GPP) and to calculate net ecosystem CO 2 exchange (NEE). This model was compared with a process-based agro-ecosystem simulation model, MONICA, which was tested for its ability to simulate Reco, GPP and NEE, using the empirical model as benchmark. Both models simulated GPP and Reco in the same order of magnitude, with MONICA simulating a considerably higher amount of CO 2 produced by photosynthesis for maize and less deviating CO 2 produced by photosynthesis for the other crops and CO 2 consumed by respiration for all crops as compared to the empirical model. Both models largely agree in CO 2 flux patterns, but show considerable differences directly after harvest and during bare soil periods. Strengths and weaknesses of both approaches were discussed and synergies of applying both approaches in conjunction were identified in a way that (i) MONICA may act as an independent method to identify significant deviations from the optimum crop growth pattern and thus point at times during which assumptions of the empirical model for simulating NEE may be violated and that (ii) the empirical model may act as a calibration benchmark for MONICA flux simulations...|$|E

50|$|Local people mostly work in agriculture. There is {{a variety}} of soils around the village {{with a mixture of}} clay and sandy soils towards hills {{to the north of the}} {{settlement}} and lime-rich marlstone mixed with sandy soils in the flatlands to the south. Crops cultivated in the area include wheat, barley, hybrid corn, <b>fodder</b> plants, <b>rye,</b> and sugar beets. Potatoes for domestic use, as well as pumpkins, from which locals extract pumpkin seed oil, are also grown in the fields and fruit trees are maintained in gardens in the village.|$|R
40|$|This study {{relates the}} leaf CO 2 {{assimilation}} and leaf dynamics of nitrogen catch crops to environmental conditions. Winter rye (Secale cereale) and fodder radish (Raphanus sativus) were grown as catch crops in an outdoor pot experiment at two rates of nitrogen supply (N 2 higher than N 1) in Wageningen, Netherlands, from August 1993 until April 1994. Biomass increased with increasing N supply. There was no net growth after mid-November. The number of tillers in rye and of appeared leaves in radish were higher in N 2 than in N 1. Leaf appearance rate increased with temperature in <b>fodder</b> radish and <b>rye.</b> Tillering in rye ceased in mid-October. Leaf lifespan {{was related to}} the temperature sum between leaf emergence and leaf death. Leaf lifespan was 478 or- 68 degrees C day in <b>fodder</b> radish. In <b>rye,</b> the leaf lifespan gradually decreased from 592 or- 66 to 389 or- 25 degrees C day and from 545 (1 observation) to 401 or- 64 degrees C day in N 1 and N 2, respectively. In young leaves, Amax (light-saturated CO 2 assimilation rate) was approximately 1. 2 mg CO 2 m- 2 leaf s- 1 in September and 0. 5 mg CO 2 m- 2 leaf s- 1 later on, independent of species and N supply, N supply affected the organic N concentrations only in the older leaves. Amax was not dependent on temperature at measurement (range: 12 - 19 degrees C in September, 5 - 15 degrees C from November until March), but, in contrast, strongly related to temperature and irradiance during the preceding growth period. Leaf nitrate concentrations increased with N supply. Water-soluble carbohydrate concentrations were higher in N 1 than in N 2 and higher in <b>rye</b> than in <b>fodder</b> radish. They fluctuated during the season. It is concluded that overall growth rates were limited by process rates other than that of leaf CO 2 assimilation per unit leaf area in both N 1 and N 2...|$|R
40|$|Perennial grass-clover leys promote wireworms. For this reason, a {{perennial}} cultivation of grass-clover ley {{should be avoided}} {{if there is any}} indication of wireworm infestation. •	After ploughing the meadows or the perennial grass-clover ley, wait until the third or, if possible, even fourth year to plant susceptible crops like potatoes, carrots, onions or salad. •	In general, a diverse crop rotation promotes various beneficial organisms and lowers the infestation of wireworms. •	No cultivation of potatoes in strongly affected areas! •	<b>Rye,</b> <b>fodder</b> radish and vetch are a possible green manure for overwintering. A low infestation of wireworms was observed in crop rotations with peas and lupines. •	The cultivation of legumes (peas, field beans, bush beans) and Brassicas (white cabbage, fodder radish, mustards) can reduce damage from wireworms. •	Grain legumes but also cereals are ideal preceding crops for potatoes. •	Keep the soil moist whilst allowing the potatoes to mature. •	Harvest the potatoes on time because the longer the tubers are in the soil, the more risk of an infestation increases •	Control couch grass (Elymus repens) because its roots can promote the metamorphosis of the wireworm larvae...|$|R
40|$|In {{southern}} Brazil {{several small}} farmers developed an innovative organic conservation tillage system (OCT) {{that does not}} depend on herbicides for weed control but relies instead on the use of cover crop mixtures (including various combinations of rye, vetch and raphanus) that leave a thick residue mulch layer on which traditional grain crops are directly planted, suffering very little weed interference during the growing season and reaching agronomically acceptable yield levels. Our research showed that the <b>rye,</b> <b>fodder</b> radish and vetch mixture effectively suppressed emergence of summer annual weeds in OCT systems. Because of the allelopathic effect of phytotoxins associated with the cover crops residues, farmers avoid toxic effects by placing crop seeds below the toxic layer (allelopathic zone) formed by the phytotoxins leached a short distance (5 - 10 cm) from the mulch into the soil. In addition to weed suppression, residues also have positive effects on subsequent crops from increased soil quality parameters, improved crop nutrition, and in some cases suppression of soil-borne pathogens. Yields in most cases are 5 - 10 % lower in OCT systems when compared to CT systems, but such differences are easily offset by the lower costs of production and the environmental benefits of OCT systems. In our trials the combination of grass and legumes enhanced biomass production and therefore mulch thickness, weed suppression, and organic matter inputs...|$|R
40|$|Catch crops {{can reduce}} NO 3 losses from leaching, but {{little is known}} about the {{importance}} of deep rooting for the efficiency of NO 3 depletion. In a field experiment, we investigated the N uptake and root growth of three types of catch crops using minirhizotrons (glass tubes of 70 -mm o. d.) reaching 2. 4 m. Our purpose was to evaluate minirhizotron methodology and the importance of deep rooting in the ability of catch crops to take up NO 3 from deep soil layers. Nitrogen uptake was studied over a 6 -d period at the end of October by injection of 15 NO 3 at four depths in the ranges: 0. 4 to 1, 0. 5 to 1. 4, and 1 to 2. 5 m under Italian ryegrass (Lolium multiflorum Lam.), winter rye (Secale cereale L.), and fodder radish (Raphanus sativus L. var. oleiformis Pers.), respectively. The root depth of the three species were 0. 6, 1. 1, and more than 2. 4 m, respectively. No 15 N was taken up from placements below root depth, and linear relationships were found between root density and 15 N uptake from different depths. Residual soil NO 3 of 18, 59, and 87 kg N ha− 1 was left under <b>fodder</b> radish, winter <b>rye,</b> and ryegrass, respectively. The measurements obtained with the minirhizotron method were highly relevant for evaluating N uptake from different soil layers, and root depths of the catch crops were important for N depletion. Knowledge about root growth and N uptake in deep soil layers may be utilized when designing crop rotations with improved N use efficiency. Where N has been left by a preceding crop and leached to deeper soil layers, it may be recycled by deep-rooted catch crops...|$|R
