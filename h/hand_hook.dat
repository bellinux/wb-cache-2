His opponent was Northern Ireland boxer Gordon Ferris, who had taken the belt from Billy Aird in March that year. The fight, shown live on British television, lasted less than a round. The contest began slowly, with both boxers trading searching shots at range with little contact made. With just less than thirty seconds to go before the bell Meade connected with a left jab to Ferris left temple; as Ferris recovered and began moving back into position, Meade was already following up with a right <b>hand</b> <b>hook.</b> Meade's hook landed {{on the left side of}} Ferris' jaw and Ferris dropped to the canvas. The referee began the count but quickly realised that the prone Ferris would not recover and so ended the fight, making Meade the new British Heavyweight champion.|$|E
5000|$|What does it {{mean when}} one uses the phrase [...] "hooking up"? The term's {{definition}} can {{vary depending on the}} person or on the age group. It can range from acts that involve kissing, oral sex, or intercourse. The term [...] "hooking up," [...] meaning an instance of casual sex, differs from hook up culture. A hook up is an act that involves sexual intimacy, claimed by many to be a sexually liberating act. On the other <b>hand,</b> <b>hook</b> up culture is thought to be oppressive and monolithic, with intimacy only occurring within a specific context. Jennifer Aubrey and Siobhan Smith have found that between genders there are minimal differences when it comes to behavior and frequency in hookups; on the other hand, women still face a harder social stigma, on account of the fact that their social status decreases with increased sexual partners, while men's social status increases with more sexual partners. [...] In a study conducted by Danielle M. Currier, she explores how the phrase [...] "hooking up" [...] conveys different meanings depending on whether a man or woman uses it when describing their sexual encounters; furthermore, Currier notes that men use [...] "hooking up" [...] to emphasize their masculinity and heterosexuality whereas women use the phrase to preserve their femininity by being strategically ambiguous in order to downplay their sexual desires.|$|E
40|$|Professor and c o n r s p o w {{addressee}} **Graduate student A multiple {{degrees of}} freedom prosthetic hand, NTU Hand, was developed in our laboratory. This paper {{is focused on the}} development of a myoelectric discrimination system for a multi-degree prosthetic hand. The discrimination system uses two surface electrodes to acquire the electromyography (EMG) signal from the flexor digitorum superficialis muscle and the extensor pollicis brevis muscle. Since eight types of hand movements, such as three-jaw chuck, lateral <b>hand,</b> <b>hook</b> grasp, power grasp, cylindncal grasp, centralized grip, flattened hand and wrist flexion are often used in daily life, they are used as key movements in the discrimination system. In order to distinguish those hand movements, the techniques of variance, bias zero-crossings, autoregressive model and spectral estimation are employed for preprocessing of features. Then, an error backpropagation neural network is applied to discriminate among the feature sets. Finally, an analysis interface system based on PC environment is constructed to verify the idea. Besides, a 3 -D graphic interface program based on programmer’s hierarchical interactive graphic system (PHIGS) is applied to simulate the prosthetic movement of the NTU hand. The discrimination system can achieve a success rate of 85 % for off-line test and of 71 % for on-line test. 1...|$|E

The studies involved three boxers: age 18. 1 ± 0. 4 years, body height 186. 7 ± 6. 1 cm, weight 81. 3 ± 0. 6 kg (Measurement I), 80. 9 ± 3. 3 kg (Measurement II), 80. 7 ± 5. 6 kg (Measurement III), training experience 3. 5 ± 1. 8 years. Body weight did not change significantly during training season. Measurements of maximal punching force and reaction time was carried out on a boxing dynamometer. Each participants performed five punches of rear and lead <b>hand</b> (<b>hook</b> and straight punches) from a typical for himself boxing position and test of simulated boxing fight lasts 60 seconds. Three measurements were carried out: Measurement I – before first starting period, Measurement II – after first starting period, Measurement III – before second preparation period. The maximal straight punching forces were 1634. 7 ± 674. 0 N for lead hand, and 2899. 7 ± 457. 9 N for rear hand. The maximal hook punching forces were 2645. 0 ± 1122. 4 N for lead hand, and 2820. 7 ± 766. 5 N for rear hand. Significant differences were observed between lead and rear hands for straight (all measurements) and hook (Measurement III during the simulated boxing fight) punches. Force of the blow inflicted on the rear limb changed significantly between the first and third and the second and third measurement in the training season. In conclusion, in the analyzed training period occurred insignificant prolongation of reaction time, accompanied by a significant increase in force of the blow hit the rear limb during the test of simulated 60 -seconds of the fight...|$|E
