25|$|The {{smaller the}} roundabout, the more such {{mitigation}} measures {{are likely to}} be abused – the less effective they will be. In the UK the minimum size for roundabouts with raised islands is 28 metre diameter ICD with a 4-metre diameter island. This threshold being driven primarily by vehicle geometry – which is globally relatively consistent – rather than <b>driver</b> <b>behaviour,</b> it is adopted in other jurisdictions too. Below this minimum size, the mini-roundabout prevails.|$|E
40|$|Risky <b>driver</b> <b>behaviours</b> such as sudden braking, swerving, and {{excessive}} acceleration {{are a major}} risk to road safety. In this study, we present a learning method to recognize such behaviours from smartphone sensor input which {{can be considered as}} a type of multi-channel time series. Unlike other learning methods, this Genetic Programming (GP) based method does not require pre-processing and manually designed features. Hence domain knowledge and manual coding can be significantly reduced by this approach. This method can achieve accurate real-time recognition of risky <b>driver</b> <b>behaviours</b> on raw input and can outperform classic learning methods operating on features. In addition this GP-based method is general and suitable for detecting multiple types of <b>driver</b> <b>behaviours...</b>|$|R

40|$|Road safety {{has become}} a major concern due to the {{increased}} rate of deaths caused by road accidents. For this purpose, intelligent transportation systems are being developed {{to reduce the number of}} fatalities on the road. A plethora of work has been undertaken on the detection of different styles of behaviour such as fatigue and drunken behaviour of the drivers; however, owing to complexity of human behaviour, a lot has yet to be explored in this field to assess different styles of the abnormal behaviour to make roads safer for travelling. This research focuses on detection of a very complex driver’s behaviours: ‘tafheet’, reckless and aggressive by proposing and building a <b>driver’s</b> <b>behaviour</b> detection model in the context-aware system in the VANET environment. Tafheet behaviour is very complex behaviour shown by young drivers in the Middle East, Japan and the USA. It is characterised by driving at dangerously high speeds (beyond those commonly known in aggressive behaviour) coupled with the drifting and angular movements of the wheels of the vehicle, which is similarly aggressive and reckless driving behaviour. Thus, the dynamic Bayesian Network (DBN) framework was applied to perform reasoning relating to the uncertainty associated with <b>driver’s</b> <b>behaviour</b> and to deduce the possible combinations of the <b>driver’s</b> <b>behaviour</b> based on the information gathered by the system about the foregoing factors. Based on the concept of context-awareness, a novel Tafheet <b>driver’s</b> <b>behaviour</b> detection architecture had been built in this thesis, which had been separated into three phases: sensing phase, processing and thinking phase and the acting phase. The proposed system elaborated the interactions of various components of the architecture with each other in order to detect the required outcomes from it. The implementation of this proposed system was executed using GeNIe 2. 0 software, resulting in the construction of DBN model. The DBN model was evaluated by using experimental set of data in order to substantiate its functionality and accuracy in terms of detection of tafheet, reckless and aggressive behaviours in the real time manner. It was shown that the proposed system was able to detect the selected abnormal <b>behaviours</b> of the <b>driver</b> based on the contextual data collected. The novelty of this system was that it could detect the reckless, aggressive and tafheet behaviour in sequential manner, based on the intensity of the <b>driver’s</b> <b>behaviour</b> itself. In contrast to previous detection model, this research work suggested the On Board Unit architecture for the arrangement of sensors and data processing and decision making of the proposed system, which can be used to pre-infer the complex behaviour like tafheet. Thus it has the potential to prevent the road accidents from happening due to tafheet behaviour...|$|R
30|$|The AIDE {{concept is}} thus {{to create a}} sort of “real time virtual {{awareness}} layer” gathering all relevant information about the context, the vehicle dynamic and the <b>driver’s</b> <b>behaviour</b> and status to close the loop and to put the driver into the loop itself. In this way the subsequent communication channel selection and information prioritisation is a powerful mean to increase driving comfort and safety.|$|R
30|$|Although the {{numerical}} sizes are usually different, and as such, absolute validity cannot be claimed, {{this has not}} hindered a series of researchers {{to claim that the}} <b>drivers</b> <b>behaviour</b> in simulator is in general similar to their on-road behaviour [5, 11 – 13].

40|$|This paper {{describes}} a basic architecture of an intelligent {{driver warning system}} which embodies an adaptive driver model for indirect collision avoidance. In this study, the driver modelling objective is focused only on longtitudinal car-following, and the model inputs are chosen to be the past history of throttle angle, controlled vehicles's speed, range and range rate to the front vehicle whereas the model output is chosen to be the current throttle angle. An artificial neural network called CMAC and a conventional linear model are independently applied to model the real driver data taken from test track and motorway environments. The CMAC model is chosen because of its nonlinear modeling capability, on-line learning convergence and minimum learning interference characteristics, whereas the linear model is chosen as a control benchmark to examine the nonlinear characteristics of the <b>driver's</b> <b>behaviour.</b> The modeling capabilities are then evaluated based on one-step ahead prediction error performances over the training and testing sets, learning curves and correlation based model validation techniques. Modeling {{results suggest that the}} past history of the throttle dynamics plays a critical role in reducing the deviation of the error correction, which in turn suggest that the throttle dynamics is generally slow for road driving. Also, the time scale dependency of the model on the <b>driver's</b> <b>behaviour</b> varies significantly from the test track to motorway environment. In the driver modeling expermient, the time scale was chosen such that the deviation of the error correlation was minimised. The test track results suggest that the chosen inputs are indeed relevant variables for modeling the <b>driver's</b> <b>behaviour.</b> Unlike that of the CLM, the degree of error deviation was found to be acceptable for the test track scenario, implying a significant nonlinear coupling of the throttle output with the speed, range and range rate data. Whereas for the motorway data, the modeling performance for both models is comparable, and the time scale of the driver model is approximately three times longer than that used in the test track data...|$|R
