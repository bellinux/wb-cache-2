5|$|I hope I {{have not}} exaggerated <b>in</b> <b>talking</b> <b>about</b> Liszt; he won't make me {{anything}} wonderful, so that I can {{come home and}} set the Thames on fire—not at all, so don't expect it; but—his readings or interpretations are greater and higher than anyone else's; if I can {{spend some time with}} him and go through a good deal of music with him, I shall pick up at least a great deal of his ideas;... The two or three lessons I had of him this summer showed me what an immensity I might learn.|$|E
5|$|Social pragmatic theories, also in {{contrast}} to the constraints view, focus on the social context in which the infant is embedded. According to this approach, environmental input removes the ambiguity of the word learning situation. Cues such as the caregiver's gaze, body language, gesture, and smile help infants to understand the meanings of words. Social pragmatic theories stress the role of the caregiver <b>in</b> <b>talking</b> <b>about</b> objects, actions, or events that the infant is already focused-in upon.|$|E
5|$|Milk's {{early career}} {{was marked by}} {{frequent}} changes; in later years he would take delight <b>in</b> <b>talking</b> <b>about</b> his metamorphosis from a middle-class Jewish boy. He began teaching at George W. Hewlett High School on Long Island. In 1956, he met Joe Campbell, at the Jacob Riis Park beach, a popular location for gay men in Queens. Campbell was seven years younger than Milk, and Milk pursued him passionately. Even after they moved in together, Milk wrote Campbell romantic notes and poems. Growing bored with their New York lives, they {{decided to move to}} Dallas, Texas, but they were unhappy there and moved back to New York, where Milk got a job as an actuarial statistician at an insurance firm. Campbell and Milk separated after almost six years; it would be his longest relationship.|$|E

Navarro also filed a complaint against Van der Sloot's translator, insisting that he misrepresented himself as an official translator of the Dutch embassy. Chinchay rejected the claims against her, stating that Van der Sloot had selected her as a private attorney after declining another defense attorney appointed by the state. She contradicted his claims that he did not understand what he was signing by stating {{that she was able to}} speak with him in perfect Spanish. She said that Van der Sloot was interested <b>in</b> <b>talking</b> <b>about</b> the Holloway case, thinking that it might get him extradited to Aruba. Chinchay also said that when she told Van der Sloot that she noticed he was signing various documents with very different signatures, he signaled for her to be quiet.|$|E

25|$|Kurchatov's speech made it {{apparent}} that the three countries were all working on the same basic concepts and had all encountered the same sorts of problems. Cockcroft missed Kurchatov's visit because he had left for the US to press for declassification of the fusion work to avoid this duplication of effort. There was a widespread belief {{on both sides of}} the Atlantic that sharing their findings would greatly improve progress. Now that it was known the Soviets were at the same basic development level, and that they were interested <b>in</b> <b>talking</b> <b>about</b> it publicly, the US and UK began considering releasing much of their information as well. This developed into a wider effort to release all fusion research at the second Atoms for Peace conference in Geneva in September 1958.|$|E

[...] Ezra Lefko of What Weekly, another Baltimore-based publication, praised the special. In particular, he expressed his approval of seeing [...] "success and national exposure for these talented artists." [...] Lea McLellan of Mountain Xpress called it [...] "hilarious" [...] and [...] "a good representation of their bizarre comedic stylings." ...|$|E

[...] According to Johnson, Adolf said he was already wanted for other crimes, so it [...] "wouldn't matter if he killed Obama". Johnson also claimed Adolf said he would never be taken alive and wanted to [...] "go down in a blaze of glory". Law enforcement sources told KCNC-TV that one of the suspects [...] "was directly asked if they had come to Denver to kill Obama. He responded in the affirmative." [...] Johnson said Gartrell came to Denver to help Adolf execute the plan, and Gartrell later admitted to police that <b>in</b> <b>talking</b> <b>about</b> Obama, they referred to [...] "shooting on a grassy knoll," [...] a reference to the assassination of John F. Kennedy.

[...] However, Johnson also told the reporter he {{came to the conclusion that}} there was assassination plot only after being questioned by the Federal Bureau of Investigation multiple times, adding, “I told them I had no idea there was a plot, a plan, a conspiracy or anything like that ...
