40|$|An {{attempt is}} made to {{establish}} possible relationships between the quantity of oxides and hydroxides of the alloying elements on the outer interstitial-free steel surface after the annealing process and {{the characteristics of the}} galvanneal coating formed. XPS measurements reflect a clear influence of the alloying element contents and the water vapour content or dew point (DP) of the atmosphere on the oxide and hydroxide coverage of the steel surface. In general, much less Fe–Zn intermetallic formation is seen on the Ti steel substrate than on the Ti–Nb steel. The reason for this may be related with the higher oxide/(Fe + Mn) atomic ratio on the external surface of the Ti steel substrate. With the Ti–Nb–P steel, an absence of Fe was observed in the coatings obtained on the surface of this steel annealed in atmospheres with a DP of − 45 or − 10 °C. A clear direct relationship has been found between the inhibition of growth of Fe–Zn intermetallic compounds and the fraction of the steel substrate surface covered by manganese oxides {{as a result of the}} annealing process. For the Ti–Nb–P steel the increase in the DP of the <b>galvannealing</b> atmosphere to 10 °C resulted in the incorporation of a significant Fe content in the coating.

40|$|Ultra-high {{strength}} {{steel sheets}} {{have been subjected}} to heat treatments that simulate the thermal cycles in hot-dip galvanising and <b>galvannealing</b> processes and evaluated with respect to their resulting mechanical properties and microstructures. The steels contained suitable contents of carbon (∼ 0. 2 %), manganese (1. 2 %) and chromium (0. 4 %) to ensure that they could be fully transformed to martensite after austenitisation followed by rapid cooling in a continuous annealing line, prior to galvanising. Different contents of vanadium (0 – 0. 1 %) and nitrogen (0. 002 – 0. 012 %) were used to investigate the possible role of these microalloying elements on the strength of the tempered martensite. Vanadium, especially when in combination with a raised nitrogen content, helps to resist the effect of tempering so that a larger proportion of the initial strengthening is preserved after the galvanising cycle, giving tensile strength levels exceeding 1000  MPa. Different deoxidation practices using aluminium or silicon have also been included. These showed similar strength levels at corresponding carbon contents but the bendability of the Si-killed steel sheet was considerably superior. Microstructural examinations have been made on the annealed steels but the reason for the beneficial effect of vanadium is still not fully explained.

40|$|Interstitial Free (IF) steels have {{excellent}} deep drawing capabilities and non-ageing properties. These steel grades {{still have some}} disadvantages such as a generally weak mechanical strength and high reactivity in the grain boundaries during <b>galvannealing,</b> which produces brittle Fe-Zn-intermetallic compounds. Furthermore the resistance to secondary work embrittlement is rather low due {{to the absence of}} soluble interstitials in grain boundaries. A good remedy is the insertion of a defined amount of carbon into the surface after recrystallization started. The possibilities and limits of a change in surface properties of Ti-IF sheet steel by a short time annealing in reactive atmospheres (CO, H 2, N 2) were evaluated: The introduction of carbon interstitials during continuous annealing increases mechanical strength associated with bake hardening and moderate age hardening and a good formability. However, to achieve fully recrystallized grains with a favourable (111) -texture the carburizing treatment should start after new grains have nucleated. A short carburizing treatment during continuous annealing can significantly improve the resistance of Ti-IF and P-Ti/Nb-IF steel against secondary work embrittlement (SWE). The r-value was slightly influenced by the added carbon atoms, the r-values were in the range between 3 and 2. The higher the carbon potential of a carburizing atmosphere, the higher is the carbon pickup.

Secondly, a careful analysis of all available phase diagram data allowed identifying those investigations in which the equilibrium state of the system was unquestionably achieved.

40|$|MasterThe overall {{performance}} of galvanized steel {{has been greatly}} improved by different surface treatments, various bath chemical compositions and application of organic coatings. In spite of improved surface corrosion resistance, the sheared edges of the steel sheet still suffer from corrosion attack. Since the involved mechanism in the cut edge corrosion {{is different from that}} of general surface, the approach of minimizing this problem has to be adjusted in order to satisfy both surface and edge resistance. When the cut edge corrosion resistance is evaluated, it can be interpreted by three main characteristics such as the time of corrosion commencement, degree of galvanic protection, and initiation site which gives an insight of further corrosion propagation. Therefore, the effect of the coating manufacturing method, aluminum addition, and phosphate pretreatment was investigated by employing potentiostatic polarization test to reveal coating dissolution behavior along with the initiation site of cut edge corrosion. The results of coating resistance were obtained from exposure to simulated marine environment in cyclic corrosion chamber. The following analysis of the coating deterioration caused by cut edge corrosion was performed with the aid of scanning electron microscope and Energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy. Consequently, it has been revealed that <b>galvannealing</b> process resulted in substantially reduced cut edge corrosion resistance due to the high iron content at the outer surface and presence of innate cracks in the coating. On the other hand, 55 % of aluminum addition showed good corrosion resistance owing to slow degradation rate of the coating. Further, phosphate was found to inhibit zinc dissolution from the surface of electrogalvanized steel, which led to the accelerated zinc dissolution from the edges. In addition, the geometry of the sheared edge of organic coated specimen was shown to affect cut edge corrosion resistance through initial adhesion loss caused by cutting process...|$|E

An attempt is made to establish possible relationships between the degradation of the lacquered surface during its exposure and {{the presence or absence of}} alloying elements on the original zinc-based substrate. With the galvanised steel and galfan coatings, 60 days of exposure to the UVCON test are necessary for a slight reduction in the lacquer content to be observed. Removal of the lacquer leaves the Cr(III) formed on the surface of the zinc-based substrate exposed. With the galfan coating, the chromate layer grows on the initial aluminium oxide film. With the <b>galvanneal</b> coating, in contrast to the lacquered galvanised steel and galfan, 15 days are sufficient for detachment of the lacquer to be observed. Longer exposure times lead to an appreciable increase in the percentage of lacquer removed. Surprisingly, the chromate layer remains on the surface of the <b>galvanneal</b> coating, preventing its corrosion, even after 60 days of exposure. XPS data suggest the presence of Cr-O-C type bonds at the interface, due to the oxidation of the lacquer surface associated with the reduction of Cr(VI) to Cr(III), which contribute significantly to the increase in lacquer adhesion. © 2003 Elsevier B.

40|$|Augmentation of the {{internal}} software of a commercial x-ray fluorescence gauge is shown to enable the instrument to extend its continuous on-line real-time measurements of a <b>galvanneal</b> coating's total elemental content to encompass similar measurements of the relative thickness of the coating's three principal metallurgical phases. The mathematical structure of this software augmentation {{is derived from the}} theory of neural networks. The empirical basis for the numerics embedded in the software's decision logic is presented. The performance of the augmented gauge is validated by comparing the gauge-implied real-time phase distribution with the phase distribution independently measured off-line on time-tagged samples drawn from the <b>galvanneal</b> production line where the measurement gauge had been installed. The performance validation is shown to demonstrate good agreement between the gauge and laboratory measurements and to suggest preferred approaches to be followed in future applications of the augmented gauge...|$|R
