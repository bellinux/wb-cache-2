50|$|After {{the trade}} and before settlement, {{the rights of the}} {{purchaser}} are contractual and therefore personal. Because they are merely personal, their rights are at risk in the event of the insolvency of the vendor. After settlement, the purchaser owns securities and their rights are proprietary. Settlement is the <b>delivery</b> <b>of</b> <b>securities</b> to complete trades. It involves upgrading personal rights into property rights and thus protects market participants from the risk of the default of their counterparties.|$|E

50|$|The {{integration}} of a gender in SSR contributes to different {{objectives of the}} reform process: better <b>delivery</b> <b>of</b> <b>security</b> and justice services; more representative institutions; respect for human rights; strengthened oversight and accountability and local ownership of the SSR process itself. The {{integration of}} gender perspectives is generally pursued through two complementary strategies: gender mainstreaming, and measures to promote the equal participation {{of men and women}} in security sector institutions and SSR processes. Gender perspectives can be included in both the SSR process itself (e.g. by consulting men and women on SSR, or training personnel responsible for SSR policy on gender issues) and in the institutions undergoing reform (e.g. in efforts to recruit more women, pursue gender-sensitive service delivery or provide gender training to new recruits).|$|R

40|$|Central Bank. 1. Securities lending (borrowing) {{consists}} of the <b>delivery</b> <b>of</b> <b>securities</b> for a given time period. Usually the borrowers (e. g. brokers) subsequently on-sell the securities outright to other clients. The ability of the borrower to on-sell the securities reflects that legal ownership is transferred to the borrower, while the economic {{risks and benefits of}} ownership remain with the original owner. In return, the “lender ” receives a fee from the “borrower ” {{for the use of the}} security. 2. Gold loans consist of the delivery of gold for a given time period. As in the previous case, legal ownership of the gold is transferred (the temporary borrower may on-sell the gold to a third party), but the risks and benefits of changes in the gold price remain with the lender. Gold borrowers (usually market dealers/brokers) often use these transactions to cover their sales to third parties in periods of (temporary) gold shortage. A comparable fee is paid to the original owner for the use of the gold. 3. In both types of transactions, the fee is justified by the transfer of the use of the financial instrument/gold from the original owner to the borrower. No exchange of cash takes place. Occasionally, some provision of collateral to the lender may guarantee that, when the transaction matures, the borrower will return the financial instrument to its original owner plus a fee previously agreed. 2 The amount of the fee is determined by the value of the underlying asset and the duration of the reversible transaction...|$|E
50|$|A typical ready {{forward deal}} {{involved}} two banks brought {{together by a}} broker {{in lieu of a}} commission. The broker handles neither the cash nor the securities, though that wasn't the case in the lead-up to the scam. In this settlement process, <b>deliveries</b> <b>of</b> <b>securities</b> and payments were made through the broker. That is, the seller handed over the securities to the broker, who passed them to the buyer, while the buyer gave the cheque to the broker, who then made the payment to the seller. In this settlement process, the buyer and the seller might not even know whom they had traded with, either being known only to the broker. This the brokers could manage primarily because by now they had become market makers and had started trading on their account. To keep up a semblance of legality, they pretended to be undertaking the transactions on behalf of a bank.|$|R
50|$|Non-DvP {{settlement}} processes typically {{expose the}} parties to settlement risk.

FOP settlement involves <b>delivery</b> <b>of</b> the <b>securities</b> without a simultaneous transfer of funds - hence 'free of payment'. Funds may either be remitted by other, mutually agreed means, or payment may not be made at all. This is the case in the transfer <b>of</b> <b>securities</b> gifted or inherited, or, in a country retaining paper securities certificates, in the dematerialisation <b>of</b> such <b>securities,</b> by transfer FOP into the name of the electronic custodian, with beneficial ownership retained by the transferor.|$|R

2500|$|There is {{no single}} {{globally}} accepted definition <b>of</b> <b>security</b> sector reform (SSR), but it generally refers to a process to reform or rebuild a state's security sector towards good security sector governance (SSG). Good SSG {{can be defined as}} a number of idealized principles and good practices <b>of</b> a healthy <b>security</b> sector servicing its people. Likewise, the objective of SSR can be defined as the application of the same principles of good governance to the security sector as to any other public sector service delivery, such as public health or education. For example, the Development Assistance Committee (DAC) of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) has defined four standards that SSR should strive for:1. Establishment of effective governance, oversight and accountability in the security system; 2) improved <b>delivery</b> <b>of</b> <b>security</b> and justice services; 3) development of local leadership and ownership of the reform process; and 4) sustainability <b>of</b> justice and <b>security</b> service delivery.The target <b>of</b> <b>security</b> sector reform (SSR) are the components of the state that uphold national security. Although the security sector is therefore a wide term open to interpretation, it is generally used to describe the structures, institutions and personnel responsible for the management, provision and oversight <b>of</b> <b>security</b> in a certain country.

40|$|Security {{functions}} are usually deployed on proprietary hardware, {{which makes the}} <b>delivery</b> <b>of</b> <b>security</b> service inflexible and of high cost. Emerging technologies such as software-defined networking and network function virtualization go {{in the direction of}} executing functions as software components in virtual machines or containers provisioned in standard hardware resources. They enable network to provide customized security service by deploying Security Service Chain (SSC), which refers to steering flow through multiple security functions in a particular order specified by individual user or application. However, SSC Deployment Problem (SSC-DP) needs to be solved. It is a challenging problem for various reasons, such as the heterogeneity of instances in terms of service capacity and resource demand. In this paper, we propose an SSC-based approach to deliver security service to users without worrying about physical locations <b>of</b> <b>security</b> functions. For SSC-DP, we present a three-phase method to solve it while optimizing network and security resource allocation. The presented method allows network to serve a large number of flows and minimizes the latency seen by flows. Comparative experiments on the fat-tree and Waxman topologies show that our method performs better than other heuristics under a wide range of network conditions...|$|R

40|$|Thesis (Ph. D. (Development and Management)) [...] North-West University, Vaal Triangle Campus, 2007. The main aim of {{this study}} was to {{investigate}} whether powers, functions and responsibilities decentralized by the national sphere of government to the provincial and local units of government enable the latter to deliver safety and security services optimally in the Free State. To facilitate research, focus was subdivided into the following four research objectives: To provide a theoretical exposition of what governmental relations and decentralization entail; To assess the structures that coordinates and oversees the <b>delivery</b> <b>of</b> safety and <b>security</b> services, To examine the impact of the relationship between the provincial minister or the member of executive council (MEC) for safety and security and the provincial police commissioner on the <b>delivery</b> <b>of</b> safety and <b>security</b> services in the province. To determine empirically the extent to which the public participate in the <b>delivery</b> <b>of</b> safety and <b>security</b> services in the province. The hypothesis for the study was as follows: The safety and security powers, functions and responsibilities decentralised by the national sphere of govemment to both the provincial and local spheres were not adequate to ensure effective and efficient crime prevention in the Free State. The research methods involved a literature study of primary and secondary sources, as well as an empirical research of public perceptions on the <b>delivery</b> <b>of</b> safety and <b>security</b> services. The primary sources comprised official government reports, records and policy documents. The secondary sources comprised books, journals, workshop papers and academic research reports. The empirical research comprised the use of a questionnaire to examine public perception on safety and security service delivery in municipal district areas served by nineteen (19) priority police stations in the Free State. A convenience sample of two-thousand five hundred (2 500) participants was selected. Focus group interviews were conducted with elected members of the Provincial Police Board. The research findings reveal that: Intergovernmental and bureaucratic politics at the national sphere of government have a negative effect on the <b>delivery</b> <b>of</b> decentralised safety and security services in the Free State. The coordination of the public safety and security oversight policy is beset with implementation gaps at the national provincial and local spheres of government. The Free State Provincial legislature and the Member of Executive Council (MEC) for Safety and Security (who is the political head of policing in the province) have limited and or indirect political and administrative priority over the provincial police commissioner as compared to the national sphere of government and the Minister <b>of</b> Safety and <b>Security.</b> While the theoretical focus of intergovernmental relations is on the decentralisation of powers, functions and responsibilities from national to sub national units of government, empirical research indicates that decentralisaticm has not been matched by effective and convincing public participation in the <b>delivery</b> <b>of</b> safety and <b>security</b> services in the Free State.
