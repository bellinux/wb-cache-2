25|$|In 2006, due {{to years}} of wear and tear, the {{original}} concert stage floor was replaced {{at a cost of}} $250,000. In order to avoid any change {{to the sound of the}} hall, the new floor was built using same methods and materials as the original. These included tongue-in-groove, three-quarter inch, <b>hard</b> <b>maple</b> boards, a compressed wool underlayment and hardened steel cut nails, hammered in by hand. The vertical grain fir subfloor from 1899 was in excellent shape and was left in place. The nails used in the new floor were hand cut using the same size and construction as the originals and the back channelling on the original maple top boards was replicated as well.|$|E
25|$|Despite {{the fact}} that of itself Florida Maple is not {{employed}} as a commercial timber species, it is used with associated commercial species when the products are pulpwood, sawtimber, or wood veneer stock. It is considered a <b>hard</b> <b>maple</b> and as high quality individuals are suitable for producing furniture, flooring, paneling, and shoe lasts. However, its relative scarcity, small size, and fairly poor shape generally confine its use to only factory and box lumber, and even this is only an occasional occurrence. It has, however, been experiencing growing popularity as an ornamental or shade tree, especially in the southern United States due to its high heat resistance. It is also a source of maple syrup, though again its size and rarity limit its use in this regard, {{especially in light of}} the Sugar Maple's established popularity within the business.|$|E
500|$|In {{the lumber}} {{industry}} Acer rubrum {{is considered a}} [...] "soft maple", a designation it shares, commercially, with silver maple (A. saccharinum). In this context, the term [...] "soft" [...] is more comparative, than descriptive; i.e., [...] "soft maple", while softer than it's harder cousin, sugar maple (A. saccharum), is still a fairly hard wood, being comparable to Black Cherry (Prunus serotina) in this regard. [...] Like A. saccharum, the wood of red maple is close-grained, but its texture is softer, less dense, and has not as desirable an appearance, particularly under a clear finish. [...] However, the wood from Acer rubrum while being typically less expensive than <b>hard</b> <b>maple,</b> also has greater dimensional stability than that of A. saccharum, and also machines and stains easier. Thus, high grades of wood from the red maple can be substituted for <b>hard</b> <b>maple,</b> {{particularly when it comes}} to making stain/paint-grade furniture. Red maple lumber also contains a greater percentage of [...] "curly" [...] (aka [...] "flame"/"fiddleback") figure, which is prized by musical instrument/custom furniture makers, as well as the veneer industry. [...] As a soft maple, the wood tends to shrink more during the drying process than with the hard maples.|$|E

60|$|Thick flakes beat on the windows, and icy {{draughts}} {{swept through}} the car, while the big stove in a boxed-in corner hummed with a drowsy roar. With half-closed eyes I {{leaned back against the}} <b>hard</b> <b>maple</b> while the preceding scenes of the long journey rolled like a panorama before me. Twelve days it took the ancient steamer, which swarmed like a hive, to thrash through mist and screaming gale across the Atlantic, while fifteen hundred emigrants below wished themselves dead. Then there followed an apparently endless transit in the lurching cars, where we slept as best we could on uncushioned seats and floor, through dark pine forests, with only an occasional tin-roofed hamlet to break the monotony. After that there were wooden cities in Ontario very much like the hamlets of a larger growth; and when at last sickened by the vibration, we sped out on to the long-expected prairie, the prospect was by no means inviting. Spring, I was told, was very late that year, and the plains rolled before us to the horizon a dreary white wilderness streaked by willow-swale, with at first many lonely lakes rippling a bitter steely-blue under the blasts, while crackling ice fringed their shores. Then several of my companions, who were young and romantic Britons with big revolvers strapped about them under their jackets, grew suspiciously quiet, and said no more about the strange adventures they had looked for in the West. There was nothing romantic about this land, which lacked even the clear skies Grace Carrington spoke of. It looked a hard country, out of which only a man with the power of stubborn endurance could wrest a living.|$|E

5|$|Red maple is {{also used}} for the {{production}} of maple syrup, though the <b>hard</b> <b>maples</b> Acer saccharum (sugar maple) and Acer nigrum (black maple) are more commonly utilized. One study compared the sap and syrup from the sugar maple with those of the red maple, {{as well as those of}} the Acer saccharinum (silver maple), Acer negundo (boxelder), and Acer platanoides (Norway maple), and all were found to be equal in sweetness, flavor, and quality. However, the buds of red maple and other soft maples emerge much earlier in the spring than the sugar maple, and after sprouting chemical makeup of the sap changes, imparting an undesirable flavor to the syrup. This being the case, red maple can only be tapped for syrup before the buds emerge, making the season very short.|$|R

40|$|I {{examined}} foliar {{traits of}} sugar maple (Acer saccharum Marsh.) and black maple (Acer saccharum Marsh. ssp. nigrum Desm. or Acer nigrum Michx. f.) indigenous near 43 °N latitude from 70 ° to 94 °W longitude. Laminae from 90 ° to 94 °W {{had the highest}} surface area and a slightly higher percentage of their area in the proximal portion of the blade than leaves from further east. Up to 800 trichomes/cm 2 were on the abaxial surface of laminae from west of 85 °W longitude, whereas laminae from further east had fewer than 200 trichomes/cm 2. Westerly laminae had relatively high stomatal frequency, and stomatal apertures of laminae west of 91 °W longitude were particularly narrow. Principal component analysis showed that trees west of 93. 1 °W longitude in Iowa formed a distinct cluster, while trees from the remaining locations clustered into a second group. In another experiment, I compared water relations, growth, and foliar traits of frequently irrigated and drought-stressed <b>hard</b> <b>maples</b> from central Iowa, eastern Iowa, and the eastern United States. Seedlings irrigated frequently had higher xylem diameter, lamina area, lamina dry mass, root dry mass, shoot:root dry mass ratio, and lamina area:xylem diameter ratio than plants subjected to drought. Although drought reduced predawn leaf water potential, midday water potentials were higher for seedlings subjected to drought (- 1. 44 MPa) than for frequently irrigated plants (- 1. 92 MPa). Specific lamina mass and trichome frequency were highest for leaves from central Iowa, for which means were 5. 97 mg·cm- 2 and 531 trichomes/cm 2, respectively. Averaged over regions, drought-stressed plants had 483 abaxial stomates/mm 2, while plants irrigated more frequently had 596 stomates/mm 2. Interactions of seedling origin and irrigation treatment affected stem length, shoot and total dry masses, and stomatal conductance, which was reduced during drought only among plants from central Iowa. Restriction site patterns in chloroplast DNA for plants from central Iowa, eastern Iowa, and the eastern United States were determined. Analysis of the ndhA intron revealed that TaqI gave a polymorphic site that showed chloroplast types were not geographically localized. My results could impact the selection and evaluation of <b>hard</b> <b>maples</b> for use in managed landscapes prone to drought...|$|R

50|$|While all the specs {{from the}} {{original}} RG550 are mirrored in the 20th Anniversary run, Ibanez have addressed one important issue. The original RG550 models sometimes suffered from catastrophic neck warpage, owing to the ultra-slim carve of the neck - {{the very thing that}} made the RG550 such a unique instrument in the first place. Instead of recreating the 2- or 3-piece neck of the late 1980s, which usually had a head piece and a longer neck piece glued together obliquely just behind the nut, Ibanez have revised the entire neck construction with the 20th Anniversary model. The neck on the new RG550 is a 5-piece laminate, with three strips of <b>hard</b> rock <b>maple</b> and two thin strips of walnut. The maple strips are arranged so that the grain on the outer two pieces is parallel, while the grain of the center strip is perpendicular to the other two, thereby granting the neck far more resistance to warping than the originals had. They also feature 2 titanium rods going down each side of the truss rod for added strength and rigidity.|$|R
