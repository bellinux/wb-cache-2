The test structure was intended to represent one floor of an office building 12 m × 18 m in plan with a height of 4 m. Wooden cribs totalling 35.5 kg/m 2 {{were used for the}} fire load and plastic bags filled by ‘road-metal’ were used to apply gravity loads representing a typical office occupancy.|$|E
40|$|Abstract—We {{prove the}} duality of {{solutions}} for the problem of determining the boundary conditions on two opposite sides of a rectangular plate from the frequency spectrum of its bending vibrations. A method for determining the boundary conditions on two opposite sides of a rectangular plate from nine natural frequencies is obtained. The results of numerical experiments justifying the theoretical conclusions of the paper are presented. Rectangular plates are widely used in various technical fields. They serve as printed circuit boards and <b>header</b> <b>plates,</b> bridging plates, aircraft and ship skin, and parts of various mechanical struc-tures [1 – 4]. If the plate fixing cannot be inspected visually, then one can use the natural bending vibration frequencies to find faults in the plate fixing. For circular and annular plates, methods for testing the plate fixing were found in [5 – 7], where it was shown {{that the type of}} fixing of a circular or annular plate can be determined uniquely from the natural bending vibration frequencies. The following question arises: Is it possible to determine the type of fixing of a rectangular plate on two opposite sides of the plate from the natural bending vibration frequencies if the other two sides are simply supported? Since the opposite sides of the plate are equivalent to each other, a plate with “rigid restraint–free edge ” fixing will sound exactly the same as a plate with “free edge–rigi...|$|R
40|$|Graduation date: 2011 Microreactors offer {{high rates}} of heat {{transfer}} able to intensify highly endothermic biomass reforming reactions in supercritical water. In this study, two continuous flow microreactor configurations were used to gasify biomass constituents in supercritical water. The first reactor configuration was a micro diameter stainless steel or Hastelloy tube (508 µm – 762 µm) imbedded into a reactor block. The reactor provided {{high rates of}} heat transfer to the reacting fluid to sustain an isothermal reaction temperature and was used to elucidate interactions between phenol, a lignin model compound, and xylose, a hemicellulose model compound, during co-gasification. In addition, a reaction mechanism and kinetics for phenol and xylose gasification by supercritical were estimated. The second microreactor configuration studied was a parallel channel Hastelloy microreactor. The reactor consisted of 14 parallel rectangular microchannels (1000 µm by 127 µm) integrated into a single contiguous reactor block by diffusion bonding a series of shims between two <b>header</b> <b>plates.</b> Fabrication of the reactor from Hastelloy C- 276, a high nickel content alloy, substantially intensified biomass gasification reactions and promoted the water gas shift and methanation reactions due to its high catalytic activity and the large surface {{area to volume ratio}} in the microchannel. The dispersion and channel flow distribution in the microchannel reactor was characterized experimentally and modeled using computational fluid dynamics by a tracer pulse study. Furthermore, computational fluid dynamics were used to investigate the effect of endothermic biomass reforming reactions and the average fluid Reynolds number on the reaction temperature. Lastly, xylose was completely gasified to hydrogen and carbon dioxide in the parallel channel microreactor at 650 °C and 250 bar within a 1. 4 second residence time...|$|R

50|$|The {{most common}} types of {{aftermarket}} headers {{are made of}} mild steel or stainless steel tubing for the primary tubes along with flat flanges and possibly a larger diameter collector made of a similar material as the primaries. They may be coated with a ceramic-type finish (sometimes both inside and outside), or painted with a heat-resistant finish, or bare. Chrome <b>plated</b> <b>headers</b> are available but these tend to blue after use. Polished stainless steel will also color (usually a yellow tint), but less than chrome in most cases.|$|R

5000|$|Flat plate {{collectors}} are {{an extension}} of the idea to place a collector in an 'oven'-like box with glass directly facing the Sun. Most flat plate collectors have two horizontal pipes at the top and bottom, called headers, and many smaller vertical pipes connecting them, called risers. The risers are welded (or similarly connected) to thin absorber fins. Heat-transfer fluid (water or water/antifreeze mix) is pumped from the hot water storage tank or heat exchanger into the collectors' bottom header, and it travels up the risers, collecting heat from the absorber fins, and then exits the collector out of the top <b>header.</b> Serpentine flat <b>plate</b> collectors differ slightly from this [...] "harp" [...] design, and instead use a single pipe that travels up and down the collector. However, since they cannot be properly drained of water, serpentine flat plate collectors cannot be used in drainback systems.|$|R
