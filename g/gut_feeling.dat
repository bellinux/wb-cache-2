40|$|BACKGROUND: General {{practitioners}} sometimes base clinical {{decisions on}} <b>gut</b> <b>feelings</b> alone, {{even though there}} is little evidence of their diagnostic and prognostic value in daily practice. Research into these aspects {{and the use of the}} concept in medical education require a practical and valid description of <b>gut</b> <b>feelings.</b> The goal of our study was therefore to describe the concept of <b>gut</b> <b>feelings</b> in general practice and to identify their main determinants METHODS: Qualitative research including 4 focus group discussions. A heterogeneous sample of 28 GPs. Text analysis of the focus group discussions, using a grounded theory approach. RESULTS: <b>Gut</b> <b>feelings</b> are familiar to most GPs in the Netherlands and play a substantial role in their everyday routine. The participants distinguished two types of <b>gut</b> <b>feelings,</b> a sense of reassurance and a sense of alarm. In the former case, a GP is sure about prognosis and therapy, although they may not always have a clear diagnosis in mind. A sense of alarm means that a GP has the feeling that something is wrong even though objective arguments are lacking. GPs in the focus groups experienced <b>gut</b> <b>feelings</b> as a compass in situations of uncertainty and the majority of GPs trusted this guide. We identified the main determinants of gut feelings: fitting, alerting and interfering factors, sensation, contextual knowledge, medical education, experience and personality. CONCLUSION: The role of <b>gut</b> <b>feelings</b> in general practice has become much clearer, but we need more research into the contributions of individual determinants and into the test properties of <b>gut</b> <b>feelings</b> to make the concept suitable for medical education...|$|R
40|$|Background: General {{practitioners}} (GPs) {{are often}} faced with complicated, vague problems {{in situations of}} uncertainty {{that they have to}} solve at short notice. In such situations, <b>gut</b> <b>feelings</b> seem to play a substantial role in their diagnostic process. Qualitative research distinguished a sense of alarm and a sense of reassurance. However, not every GP trusted their <b>gut</b> <b>feelings,</b> since a scientific explanation is lacking. Objective: This paper explains how <b>gut</b> <b>feelings</b> arise and function in GPs' diagnostic reasoning. Approach: The paper reviews literature from medical, psychological and neuroscientific perspectives. Conclusions: <b>Gut</b> <b>feelings</b> in general practice are based on the interaction between patient information and a GP's knowledge and experience. This is visualized in a knowledge-based model of GPs' diagnostic reasoning emphasizing that this complex task combines analytical and non-analytical cognitive processes. The model integrates the two well-known diagnostic reasoning tracks of medical decision-making and medical problem-solving, and adds <b>gut</b> <b>feelings</b> as a third track. Analytical and non-analytical diagnostic reasoning interacts continuously, and GPs use elements of all three tracks, depending on the task and the situation. In this dual process theory, <b>gut</b> <b>feelings</b> emerge as a consequence of non-analytical processing of the available information and knowledge, either reassuring GPs or alerting them that something is wrong and action is required. The role of affect as a heuristic within the physician's knowledge network explains how <b>gut</b> <b>feelings</b> may help GPs to navigate in a mostly efficient way in the often complex and uncertain diagnostic situations of general practice. Emotion research and neuroscientific data support the unmistakable role of affect in the process of making decisions and explain the bodily sensation of <b>gut</b> <b>feelings.</b> The implications for health care practice and medical education are discussed.

[...] Rolling Stones David Fricke, reviewing Doolittle, said [...] "Monkey Gone to Heaven" [...] was [...] "a corrosive, compelling meditation on God and garbage." [...] The critical success of [...] "Monkey Gone to Heaven" [...] was also reflected commercially; the song reached number five on the Billboard Modern Rock Tracks chart, marking the Pixies' debut in the American charts.

500|$|Mullally {{revealed}} that the show's writing team was [...] "notorious for tinkering with the script's laugh lines", even during the actual taping of the episodes.

Change this line to this. Now we're locked – go.'" [...] Prior to the live episode, the cast had shot the second, third and fourth episodes of the season. Shortly before this episode, Mullally injured her foot {{and was unable to}} walk without crutches. The writers therefore had to put Mullally's character, Karen, in a cast and a motorized scooter, ostensibly because the character was recovering from an operation to correct a webbed toe.|$|E

In 2007, when Steffy suffered a concussion against 10th-ranked Rutgers, the relatively untested Turner took over and led Maryland to an upset victory. He then started the remainder of the season, compiled a 4–5 record in games he started, and led another upset against eighth-ranked Boston College. In comparing the practice performances of Steffy, Turner, and third-stringer Josh Portis, offensive coordinator James Franklin said:It gets hard if one quarterback all through spring and all through summer camp was statistically better in almost every single category, it's hard to rationalize not making him the starter ... because your <b>gut</b> <b>feeling</b> is one thing and the statistics are another. Jordan led by a pretty large amount in completion percentage ... the least interception percentage. He didn't lead in yards per ... percentage of explosive plays. I consider an explosive play a play of 16yards or more ... Portis led in that and Turner was second and Jordan was third.|$|E

It was like finding a needle in a haystack. I spent months chasing false leads and implacable bureaucracy but I was not prepared to accept this, as instinct told me that the samples would be somewhere.

40|$|Introduction: Gut feelings; {{the uncomfortable}} feeling that {{something}} is wrong while specific indications are lacking, are a common feature among general practitioners (GPs) and are often related to a suspicion of cancer. Although there is little evidence of the prognostic value of these feelings, it is known that such sense of alarm can activate the GPs’ diagnostic behaviour. Studies show that early recognition of symptoms may contribute to early detection of cancer and is an important factor for prognosis and survival. In this way, one might expect that <b>gut</b> <b>feelings</b> can help predict and prevent serious disease and it will be of great value to assess the evidence of these feelings. Objective: To examine the causes of cancer-related <b>gut</b> <b>feelings</b> amongst GPs in the Netherlands, to describe the therapeutic actions that were driven by these feelings and to investigate whether the symptoms that caused the <b>gut</b> <b>feelings</b> have ultimately lead to a cancer diagnosis. Methods: Data were collected via the Dutch Sentinel General Practice Network; a network of 42 general practices, nationally representative by age, gender, regional distribution and population density. From January 2010, all GPs were asked to fill in questionnaires for each patient causing a gutfeeling that he/she may have cancer. After three months, the GPs were asked to complete a second questionnaire, evaluating patient’s final diagnosis. Results: A total of 124 questionnaires were completed in 2010. The GPs indicated that the <b>gut</b> <b>feelings</b> were caused by: unexplained weight loss, consultation of a patient who rarely visits the GP, smoking, a palpable tumor (especially in the breast), icterus, an irregular hematogram or extension of symptoms. Preliminary results show that the <b>gut</b> <b>feelings</b> lead to a diagnosis in 63 % of the cases and in 60 % of the cases this was a diagnosis of cancer. However in the majority of cases (56 %) it was not the diagnosis anticipated initially. Conclusions: The study confirms that <b>gut</b> <b>feelings</b> may be a useful although not a precise instrument in the early diagnosis of cancer in general practice. Further studies in triggers of <b>gut</b> <b>feelings</b> are recommended. (aut. ref. ...|$|R

40|$|Abstract Background General {{practitioners}} sometimes base clinical {{decisions on}} <b>gut</b> <b>feelings</b> alone, {{even though there}} is little evidence of their diagnostic and prognostic value in daily practice. Research to validate the determinants and to assess the test properties of <b>gut</b> <b>feelings</b> requires precise and valid descriptions of <b>gut</b> <b>feelings</b> in general practice which {{can be used as a}} reliable measuring instrument. Research question: Can we obtain consensus on descriptions of two types of gut feelings: a sense of alarm and a sense of reassurance? Methods Qualitative research including a Delphi consensus procedure with a heterogeneous sample of 27 Dutch and Belgian GPs or ex-GPs involved in academic educational or research programmes. Results After four rounds, we found 70 % or greater agreement on seven of the eleven proposed statements. A "sense of alarm" is defined as an uneasy feeling perceived by a GP as he/she is concerned about a possible adverse outcome, even though specific indications are lacking: There's something wrong here. This activates the diagnostic process by stimulating the GP to formulate and weigh up working hypotheses that might involve a serious outcome. A "sense of alarm" means that, if possible, the GP needs to initiate specific management to prevent serious health problems. A "sense of reassurance" is defined as a secure feeling perceived by a GP about the further management and course of a patient's problem, even though the doctor may not be certain about the diagnosis: Everything fits in. Conclusion The sense of alarm and the sense of reassurance are well-defined concepts. These descriptions enable us to operationalise the concept of <b>gut</b> <b>feelings</b> in further research. </p...|$|R
40|$|A {{sense of}} alarm, {{which is a}} form of "gut feeling" {{sometimes}} plays a part in the decisions of medical disciplinary tribunals in The Netherlands. Since these judgments are regarded as setting standards for professional attitudes in The Netherlands, the question arises how Dutch tribunals have evaluated <b>gut</b> <b>feelings,</b> and how tribunals in other European countries deal with them. An exploratory study searched two Dutch digital databases (2000 - 2008) and asked 26 national representatives of the European General Practice Research Network for information about the role of <b>gut</b> <b>feelings</b> in tribunals' decisions. A sense of alarm was mentioned in judgments in 34 Dutch cases. Defendants were hardly ever reproached for missing the correct diagnosis, but mostly for not acting in a professional manner. The sense of alarm was referred to as a diagnostic tool to assess a patient's situation, although the judgments indicate that it must be followed by further diagnostic steps. The role of <b>gut</b> <b>feelings</b> in decisions of disciplinary tribunals in Europe is unclear. The authors conclude that the sense of alarm as a diagnostic tool has been taken seriously by Dutch tribunals.

The timing of the firing came as somewhat of a surprise, as it was announced hours after San Jose defeated Real Salt Lake 2–1 at home.

40|$|Diagnostic {{reasoning}} {{is considered to}} be based on the interaction between analytical and non-analytical cognitive processes. <b>Gut</b> <b>feelings,</b> a specific form of non-analytical reasoning, play a substantial role in diagnostic reasoning by general practitioners (GPs) and may activate analytical reasoning. In GP traineeships in the Netherlands, trainees mostly see patients alone but regularly consult with their supervisors to discuss patients and problems, receive feedback, and improve their competencies. In the present study, we examined the discussions of supervisors and their trainees about diagnostic reasoning in these so-called tutorial dialogues and how <b>gut</b> <b>feelings</b> feature in these discussions. 17 tutorial dialogues focussing on diagnostic reasoning were video-recorded and transcribed and the protocols were analysed using a detailed bottom-up and iterative content analysis and coding procedure. The dialogues were segmented into quotes. Each quote received a content code and a participant code. The number of words per code was used as a unit of analysis to quantitatively compare the contributions to the dialogues made by supervisors and trainees, and the attention given to different topics. The dialogues were usually analytical reflections on a trainee's diagnostic reasoning. A hypothetico-deductive strategy was often used, by listing differential diagnoses and discussing what information guided the reasoning process and might confirm or exclude provisional hypotheses. <b>Gut</b> <b>feelings</b> were discussed in seven dialogues. They were used as a tool in diagnostic reasoning, inducing analytical reflection, sometimes on the entire diagnostic reasoning process. The emphasis in these tutorial dialogues was on analytical components of diagnostic reasoning. Discussing <b>gut</b> <b>feelings</b> in tutorial dialogues seems to be a good educational method to familiarize trainees with non-analytical reasoning. Supervisors need specialised knowledge about these aspects of diagnostic reasoning and how to deal with them in medical education...|$|R
