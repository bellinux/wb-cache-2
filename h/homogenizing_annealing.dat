We use HfO 2 and Al 2 O 3 layers prepared by atomic layer deposition to cover some of our flakes. We clearly observe a suppression of the low-energy luminescence peak observed for as-prepared flakes at low temperatures, indicating that this peak originates from excitons bound to surface adsorbates. We also observe different temperature-induced shifts of the luminescence peaks for the oxide-covered flakes. This effect stems from the different thermal expansion coefficients of the oxide layers and the MoS 2 flakes. It indicates that the single-layer MoS 2 flakes strongly adhere to the oxide layers and are therefore strained. Comment: 3 pages, 2 figure...|$|R

40|$|Transition {{metal oxide}} memristors, or {{resistive}} random-access memory (RRAM) switches, are under intense development for storage-class memory {{because of their}} favorable operating power, endurance, speed, and density. Their commercial deployment critically depends on predictive compact models based on understanding nanoscale physico-chemical forces, which remains elusive and controversial owing to the difficulties in directly observing atomic motions during resistive switching, Here, using scanning transmission synchrotron x-ray spectromicroscopy to study in-situ switching of hafnium oxide memristors, we directly observed {{the formation of a}} localized oxygen-deficiency-derived conductive channel surrounded by a low-conductivity ring of excess oxygen. Subsequent thermal <b>annealing</b> <b>homogenized</b> the segregated oxygen, resetting the cells towards their as-grown resistance state. We show that the formation and dissolution of the conduction channel are successfully modeled by radial thermophoresis and Fick diffusion of oxygen atoms driven by Joule heating.

40|$|This thesis {{deals with}} the concept of ECAP applied to a {{commercial}} Al Mg-Si alloy (AA 6082. 50). A detailed analysis of the strains introduced by ECAP in a single passage through the die has been made, based on direct measurements on partially pressed samples. Further, the mechanical properties of ECAP’ed samples have been investigated. The effect of initial material temper and post-ECAP artificial aging was investigated in addition to the effect of strain accumulation and processing route. Finally, a detailed study of the textural and microstructural development was made. The continuous evolution of texture and microstructure was followed through the ECAP deformation zone up to an accumulated strain of 2 (2 passes) by route A, and linked to strain measurements from the same zone. Strain measurements on sectioned samples have validated the plane strain assumption for ECAP. The shear angle has been measured and some typical features of ECAP have been corroborated, i. e. friction and material temper affect the strain distribution, the strain homogeneity and the workpiece corner angle, friction being the most significant here. Also, new conclusions have been drawn. The analysis of material element deformation histories along path lines reveals that ECAP can be interpreted as the combination of shearing and stretching (i. e. tension and/or compression). Furthermore, the final shear strain angle obtained in ECAP appears to be friction and material temper independent in the zone of homogeneous deformation. The 6082 alloy has been successfully processed by ECAP at room temperature to strains ε = 6 to ε = 8. The alloy has been pressed in the solutionized, T 4, <b>homogenized</b> and soft <b>annealed</b> states. The highest tensile strength was obtained from the solutionized material, followed by T 4, <b>homogenized</b> and soft <b>annealed.</b> This behaviour is linked to the solid solution content prior to ECAP and the potential for dynamic precipitation during ECAP processing. The tensile elongation to failure drops to a constant level between 4 % and 9 % after ECAP and is highest for the soft annealed and lowest for the solutionized material. The ductility in the solutionized material can, however, recover to ~ 18 % elongation to failure (i. e. an increase by a factor 2 - 3) by low temperature heat treatment with only a small drop in tensile strength. Soft annealed and ECAP’ed material has been compared to cold rolling to similar strains. The tensile strength response to accumulated strain is similar, but the ductility and post uniform deformation is different. However, the ECAP’ed material can be processed to higher strains and, thus, achieving higher strength. The tensile yield strength behaviour of the homogenized and ECAP’ed material can be described by a simple relation to the grain size and the fraction high and low angle boundaries. The typical texture components related to ECAP of aluminium, pressed by route A, have been identified. The typical ECAP texture starts to develop already at ~ 25 % strain and increases in intensity during the first pass. In the second pass, two of the stable texture components continue to increase in intensity, while the other texture components decrease. The microstructural development during the first pass is dominated by deformation banding leading to grain-subdivision. The average linear intercept distance (grain size) is reduced from ~ 80 μm to ~ 4 μm for high angle boundaries and from ~ 10 μm to ~ 0. 7 μm for low angle boundaries. During the second pass, the linear intercept distance is further reduced to ~ 1. 8 μm for high angle and ~ 0. 3 μm for low angle boundaries. Deformation twins are observed during the second pass and are believed {{to play an important role}} in severe plastic deformation when the grains reach the sub-micron or nano-metre scale. The deformation banding have been explained in terms of the low energy dislocation structure (LEDS) theory, and has been shown to be an important mechanism in the early stages of grain subdivision, and is further believed to be the main source of high angle grain boundary formation by grain subdivision down to a grain size of approximately ~ 0 6 μm, when other deformation mechanisms may be energetically more favourable. dr. ing. dr. ing...|$|R

40|$|In the {{laboratory}} stage thixocasting of steels {{has shown a}} great potential as a modern method for making thin-walled and complex parts. Surface defects, incomplete form filling and strong inhomogeneous component characteristics were common manufacturing defects for the components manufactured in the semi-solid state. The present work was configured to improve component quality, to test low-carbon steels tested to their suitability for thixocasting and to carry out calculations and attempts to apply the process to a real component made of steel. In addition to the average temperature, the distribution of temperature in the inductively heated bolt material largely determines {{the accuracy of the}} components. A sufficiently homogeneous temperature distribution could be achieved by an cartridge concept in additition to adapted energy-time programs for the inductive heating system. The fire-resistant lining of the cartridge made from vacuum-fiber material is highly insulating and ensures a virtually airtight that effectively suppressed scaling. The data required for the heating programs of induction heating for the steel alloys 100 Cr 6, 42 CrMo 4 and X 46 Cr 13 have been prepared {{solely on the basis of}} thermo-chemical DTA experiments and calculations. Even with steel alloy X 46 Cr 13 the biggest measurable temperature difference between front and interior was always less than 10 Kelvin. The suitability of the steel alloys X 210 CrW 12, 100 Cr 6 and 42 CrMo 4 was tested in terms of thixocasting a thin walled part. These alloys showed a decreasing flow- and mold filling behavior toward low carbon contents with its origin in the different solidification morphology. The results obtained in the meandering part were reduced by half for 42 CrMo 4 compared to X 210 CrW 12. The parts made from steel 42 CrMoV 4 showed a very clear segregation tendency. The microstructure was highly dependent on wall thickness and could not be <b>homogenized</b> by <b>annealing</b> treatments. For thixoforming of steel a number of solid metals, ceramic coatings and massive ceramics are in question as tool material. Temperature measurements of tool inserts made of different materials and coatings were carried out using infrared thermography. A comparison with the results of simulations showed a viable heat transfer coefficient of about 3000 W/(m 2 K 1). Despite very long cycle times only tools made from Si 3 N 4 ceramic and the hardened copper-base alloy CuCo 1 NiBe (2. 1293) convinced. In order to confirm the transferability of the data to the process window and to validate the collected experiences a knife of the German company BÖKER BAUMWERK was redesigned after the thixocasting requirements works. It is a 265 mm long diving knife of 6 mm thickness with an as cast thickness of 0. 8 mm at the blades. Using the simulation software MAGMAsoft® two variants were developed and manufactured for different tool materials. A casting tool from hot-work steel was designed with a bulky ingate section at the handle to reduce premature solidification. The experiments showed, however, that a comparatively high piston speed of more than 0. 5 m/s is necessary for a complete filling of the thin walled knife parts at a liquid phase concentrations of fl= 55 %. The metallographic analysis showed parts of the knife according to a clear enrichment with liquid phase of the outer regions and the blade tip. A reduction of this macroscopic segregation could not be achieved by the choice of process parameters. Preliminary tests with a ceramic tool heated to temperatures of more than 1000 °C had confirmed that the thermal shock to the tools in contact with the semisolid steel is so low that - even with the oxide-ceramic tool material Al 2 O 3 - no failure occurred. The second casting tool for the diving knife was designed as an actively heated oxide ceramic tool. The numerical simulation showed a laminar filling of the mold in 1420 milliseconds because of a very slow piston velocity vp= 0. 05 m/s and because of the low thermal conductivity of the ceramic. Accordingly in the microscopic analysis, the component actually showed only little difference in globulitic structure between the tip and the handle as well as between core and surface, which was also confirmed by EDS line scans. As the only significant structural defect shrinkage porosity was found at the calculated hotspots because of the lack of a dwell pressure phase. The components had virtually no surface flaws and showed in the reproduction of the tools milling structure the ability to generate functional surfaces with typical sizes of the structure of > 30 microns with high accuracy. For production-based processes with short cycle times (< 60 s) and the associated very high temperatures, this tool system is certainly well suited...|$|R
