[...] As he rode into town to supervise his men, Union prisoners lined the roadside, eager <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> the famous Stonewall. One of them observed Jackson's dirty, seedy uniform and remarked, [...] "Boys, he isn't much for looks, but if we'd had him we wouldn't have been caught in this trap." [...] By early afternoon, Jackson received an urgent message from General Lee: Get your troops to Sharpsburg as quickly as possible. Jackson left A.P. Hill at Harpers Ferry to manage the parole of Federal prisoners and began marching to join the Battle of Antietam.|$|E

60|$|Later in {{the winter}} while the snow still lay in the Green Forest, and the ice still bound the Laughing Brook, Peter made a {{surprising}} discovery.

Out of idle curiosity Peter ran over <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> that old nest. Imagine how surprised he was when just as he came within sight of it, he saw a great bird just settling down on it. Peter's heart jumped right up in his throat.

It's perfectly plain that the thief {{took advantage of the}} reception at Patsy Cooper's when all the neighbors were in her house and all their niggers hanging around her fence <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> the show, to raid the vacant houses undisturbed. Patsy is miserable about it; miserable on account of the neighbors, and particularly miserable on account of her foreigners, of course; so miserable on their account that she hasn't any room to worry about her own little losses." ...|$|E

It seems in his case likely to be kept under, but (as I have said before) I cannot feel uneasy and anxious about him, be the accounts what they may. It is partly selfish, for I am spared the sight of his suffering, but then I do long <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> his dear face and for the sound of his voice. Five years of absence has of course made so much change in my mind in this respect, that I do not now find myself dreaming of home, constantly thinking of it; the first freshness of my loss is not felt now.

60|$|The {{next morning}} {{the three of us}} were off early <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> the contested property. It was a twenty-mile drive, and the last eight miles wound down the boiling Washita, still high with the melting snows of the pine lands. And even here the snows yet slept in the deeper hollows. {{unconscious}} of the budding green of the slopes. How heartily I wished Mr. Farquhar Fenelon Cooke back in Philadelphia! By his eternal accounts of his Germantown stables and of the blue ribbons of his hackneys he killed all sense of pleasure of the scene, and set up an irritation that was well-nigh unbearable. At length we crossed the river, climbed the foot-hills, and paused on the ridge. Below us lay the quaint inn and scattered cottages of Asquith, and beyond them the limitless and foam-flecked expanse of lake: and on our right, lifting from the shore by easy slopes for a mile at stretch, Farrar pointed out the timbered lands of Copper Rise, spread before us like a map. But the appreciation of beauty formed no part of Mr. Cooke's composition,--that is, beauty as Farrar and I knew it.|$|E

'I must confess, I smoke a great deal: but that's not my fault, it's {{the fault of}} the chimneys. They keep it up all day, and I have to take it; just as you poor ladies have to take cigar smoke, {{whether you like it or}} not. My amusements are of a wholesome kind. I usually begin by taking a long flight down the harbour, <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> the lighthouses, the islands, the shipping, and the sea. My friends, the gulls, bring their reports to me; for they are the harbour-police, and I take notes of their doings. The school-ship is an object of interest to me, and I often perch on the mast-head, to see how the lads are getting on. Then I take a turn over the city, gossip with the weathercocks, pay my compliments to the bells, inspect the fire-alarm, and pick up information by listening at the telegraph wires. People often talk about [...] "a little bird" [...] who spreads news; but they don't know how that figure of speech originated. It is the sparrows sitting on the wires, who receive the electric shock, and, being hollow-boned, the news go straight to their heads; they then fly about, chirping it on the housetops, and the air carries it everywhere. That's the way rumours rise and news spread.' ...|$|E
6000|$|Here they {{dispersed}} {{themselves over}} the limited area, scarcely half an acre, with {{the freedom of}} escaped school children. They were secure in their woodland privacy. They were overlooked by no high road and its passing teams; they were safe from accidental intrusion from the settlement; indeed they {{went so far as}} to effect the exclusiveness of [...] "clique." [...] At first they amused themselves by casting humorously defiant eyes at the long low Ditch Reservoir, which peeped over the green wall of the ridge, six hundred feet above them; at times they even simulated an exaggerated terror of it, and one recognized humorist declaimed a grotesque appeal to its forbearance, with delightful local allusions. Others pretended to discover near a woodman's hut, among the belt of pines at the top of the descending trail, the peeping figure of the ridiculous and envious Sparrell. But all this was presently forgotten in the actual festivity. Small as was the range of the valley, it still allowed retreats during the dances for waiting couples among the convenient laurel and manzanita bushes which flounced the mountain side. After the dancing, old-fashioned children's games were revived with great laughter and half-hearted and coy protests from the ladies; notably one pastime known as [...] "I'm a-pinin'," [...] in which ingenious performance the victim was obliged to stand in the centre of a circle and publicly [...] "pine" [...] for a member of the opposite sex. Some hilarity was occasioned by the mischievous Miss [...] "Georgy" [...] Piper declaring, when it came to her turn, that she was [...] "pinin'" [...] <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> the face of Tom Sparrell just now! ...|$|E
6000|$|I rejoice to hear, by your liberal letter, {{that the}} pile of books held {{together}} and have appeared, on reaching you, to make a decent show. Also I'm very glad that it's come in your way {{to have a look}} at Nohant--though I confess that I ask myself what effect the vulgarization of places, [...] "scientifically" [...] speaking, by free and easy (and incessant) motor approach may be having on their once comparatively sequestered genius. Well, that is exactly what you will tell me after you have constaté the phenomenon in this almost best of all cases for observing it. For Nohant was so shy and remote--and Nohant must be now (handed over to the State and the Public as their property) so very much to the fore. Do read L'Histoire at any rate first--that is indispensable, and the lecture of a facility! Yes, I am liking it very much here in these beautiful midsummer coolnesses--though wishing we weren't so losing our Bloom of mystery by the multitudinous assault. However, I hug whatever provincial privacy we may still pretend to at this hour of public uproar--so very horrible is the bear-garden of the outer world to my sense, under these threatened convulsions. I cravenly avert my eyes and stop my ears--scarcely turning round even <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> the Caillaux family. What a family and what a trial--and what a suggestion for us, of complacent self-comparisons! I clutch at these hungrily--in the great deficiency of other sources of any sort of assurance for us. May we muddle through even now, though I almost wonder if we deserve to! That doubt is why I bury my nose in my rose-trees and my inkpot. What a judge of the play you will be becoming, with the rate at which Alfred and his typist keep you supplied! Be sure to see the little Nohant domestic theatre, by the way--and judge what a part it played in that discomfortable house.
