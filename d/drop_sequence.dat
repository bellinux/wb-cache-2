40|$|This paper {{proposes a}} novel method {{to study the}} {{modelling}} problem of a networked control system. We first identify the minimum packet <b>drop</b> <b>sequences</b> for a given plant or controller using {{the dynamics of the}} plant or controller.

40|$|Abstract: The {{stability}} {{and performance of}} a networked control system are strongly influenced by the network delay and packet drops. In this paper, we consider that late arrived sampling data are dropped, so that we only focus on {{the analysis of the}} impact of packet <b>drop</b> <b>sequences</b> on the control loop {{stability and}} performance. For any <b>dropping</b> <b>sequence</b> specified by (m,k) -firm model, and considering a simple mono-variable linear system with a proportional controller and zero control action in case of sampling data drop, we derived the stability conditions based on the upper bound of the plant state variance. It has been shown that the stability only depends on the values of m and k but not the pattern of the <b>dropping</b> <b>sequence.</b> In case of network overload, this gives much freedom to actively dropping some packets while still keeping the system stable. An analytic method to determine the optimal control gain for any given packet drop pattern is also derived, providing thus a guideline for optimal control and network resource scheduling co-design.

2500|$|The [...] "air drop" [...] {{sequence}} {{was conceived}} by stunt coordinator, Spiro Razatos, who also supervised on the franchise's two previous installments; Fast Five and Fast & Furious 6. Razatos told Business Insider {{that he wanted}} to rely more on real stunts rather than CGI because he wanted the whole sequence to [...] "feel real" [...] and fulfill audience's expectations. The stunt took months of prep-solving problems. Cameras needed to be mounted onto cars {{in a way that they}} would not be destroyed when the cars landed, and the crew had to figure out a safe way to get the cars out of the plane. They performed a dry run with a single car falling out of a plane and did this six times. Cars were dropped from a Lockheed C-130 Hercules high above the Arizona desert, but close up shots that show the cars landing on a mountain road were filmed in Colorado. There were two airplanes, flying at a height of 12,000 feet, each dropping two cars apiece. BRS parachutes enabled with GPS were secured to each of the cars before dropping off the C-130 plane. At about 5,000 feet, the parachutes deployed. Over 10 cameras were used for the sequence. In addition to cameras on the ground, there were cameras remotely operated inside the plane and another three mounted outside each car. Additional cameras were on a helicopter, where Razatos was stationed watching monitors. Three skydivers used in the shoot wore helmet cameras to help shoot the sequence from multiple angles. Sky divers would either jump out before cars or after them. While all the cars landed on their drop zones, 70% landed perfectly and 30% didn't. For the close-up scenes which show the actors inside their cars, a giant gimbal with a 360-degree range of movement were attached to each of the cars and was filmed against a green screen to reproduce their tumble through the sky. The last part of the scene, which shows the cars hitting the road was shot separately. To get that right, the team set up a pulley system that had cars six to ten feet above the ground. When they were dropped from the cranes, the stuntmen who were sitting in the driver's seats raced their engines at about 35 to 40 miles per hour and slid to the ground at full speed. Those cranes were then later removed from the film with computers. Razatos admits that the air <b>drop</b> <b>sequence</b> was [...] "all real" [...] and that it would be [...] "hard to top".|$|E

40|$|Delay Tolerant Networks (DTNs) are a {{class of}} {{emerging}} networks where disconnections may occur frequently due to propagation phenomena, node mobility, and power outages. Delay is inevitable in DTNs, thus, making better use of buffer space to maximize the packet delivery rate {{is more important than}} concentrating on how to decrease the delay. In this paper, we improve the buffer scheme of Epidemic Routing, which is a well-known routing protocol in DTNs. Epidemic Routing utilizes the FIFO buffer management scheme to manage the queuing. However, Epidemic Routing is still very sensitive to the buffer size. Epidemic Routing, furthermore, can only achieve good performance with respect to infinite buffer size due to that a node may have enough space to store lots of messages in its buffer and carry them along for long periods of times until appropriate forwarding opportunities arise. Once there is not enough buffer size, then the performance of Epidemic Routing will fall down hastily. We propose a new buffer scheme in Epidemic Routing, named Location and Direction Aware Drop Scheme (LDDS). LDDS utilizes the location and moving direction information of nodes to determine the <b>drop</b> <b>sequence.</b> A node can get the location and moving direction information of other nodes by receiving beacon packets periodically from anchor nodes and referring to received signal strength indicator (RSSI) for the beacon. In particular, LDDS is able to guarantee the high packet delivery ratio under small buffer size...|$|E
