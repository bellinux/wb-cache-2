40|$|The <b>basic</b> <b>package</b> {{of health}} {{services}} is {{a key component of}} a public and private mix in health care. But to develop a <b>basic</b> <b>package</b> is a difficult task due to all constraints of public demand, health budget, and the population ability to pay. There are some elements that have to be taken into consideration and balanced in the evaluation of the health services. Universality, comprehensiveness, and type of services are the most critical, and within a given budget these components are difficult to be increased all at once. Therefore there are services that need to be left outside the <b>basic</b> <b>package</b> and to be covered with private schemes. In this evaluation the elasticity {{of health services}} can be used to define the behaviour of health services consumption and refine the decision...|$|R

40|$|With the {{introduction}} of the Health Insurance Act in 2006 in the Netherlands, the <b>basic</b> <b>package</b> of the former sickness funds became valid for all citizens. The <b>basic</b> benefit <b>package</b> has been subject to change, responding to increasing health care expenditures, medical innovations and the economic crisis. In this paper we address the decision criteria used to assess the package annually since 2006 and describe some developments that do not follow the criteria, leading to a yo-yo effect. We discuss the formation of the decision for in- or exclusion and why some treatments seem to follow an, at first sight, arbitrary in- and exclusion pathway. We first describe the official way of establishing the <b>basic</b> benefit <b>package</b> and than will describe why some treatments follow a deviated path. We conclude that political pressure and pressure from interest groups may lead to inclusion or postponement of exclusion. Reform of the organization of certain forms of health care (in our example mental care) may lead to seemingly inconsequent changes. The yo-yo effect of some treatments or pharmaceuticals may have negative effects on health care providers, insurers and patients. The seemingly well defined criteria available for defining the <b>basic</b> <b>package</b> appear to be broadly interpretable and other influences may determine the final decision of inclusion or exclusion...|$|R
