50|$|Amphimallon solstitiale, {{also known}} as the summer chafer or <b>European</b> <b>june</b> <b>beetle,</b> is a beetle similar to the {{cockchafer}} but much smaller, approximately 20 mm in length. They are declining in numbers now, but where found they are often seen in large numbers. At dusk they actively fly around tree tops looking for a mate and can often be found drowning in pools of water the following morning. They are also attracted to light and come in through open, lit windows and fly around lamps, making quite a racket while bumping into lights. They are found throughout the Palearctic region, commonly seen from June to August, living in meadows, hedgerows, and gardens, and eating plants and tree foliage.|$|E
50|$|Cotinis nitida, {{commonly}} known as the green <b>June</b> <b>beetle,</b> <b>June</b> bug or <b>June</b> <b>beetle,</b> is a beetle of the family Scarabaeidae. It is found in the eastern United States, where it is most abundant in the south. It is sometimes confused with the related southwestern species figeater beetle Cotinis mutabilis, which is less destructive.|$|R

40|$|Precise {{information}} about endangered species, in particular identifying their resources requirements, {{is needed to}} identify areas that might support populations. Little {{is known about the}} endangered Mount Hermon <b>June</b> <b>Beetle</b> (Polyphylla barbata) found only within Zayante soils region of Santa Cruz County, California. We investigated the beetle’s host plant selection, habitat association and mating behavior between June 2004 and September 2005. We identified angiosperm and Pteridophyta phyla, and fungi within the frass pellets of Mount Hermon <b>June</b> <b>Beetle</b> larvae demonstrating that they are not specialist feeders but are microhabitat specialists. Larval species was confirmed by DNA analysis. Significant differences were found in vegetation assemblages between regions where the Mount Hermon <b>June</b> <b>Beetle</b> did and did not occur for Chorizanthe pungens var. hartwegiana, and bare ground...|$|R
5000|$|The larval cycle for {{the species}} is likely 1 year, based on the absence of larvae (grubs) in burrows during the adult flight season. The food source for Casey's <b>June</b> <b>beetle</b> larvae while {{underground}} is unknown, but other species of <b>June</b> <b>beetle</b> are known to eat [...] "plant roots or plant detritus and associated decay organisms". [...] stated, [...] "June beetle exhibits no specific host preferences, and larvae likely consume any available organic resources— including organic debris— encountered within the alluvial habitat." [...] Specific host plant associations for Casey’s <b>June</b> <b>beetle</b> are not known. Although visual surveys have detected a concentration of emergence burrows {{in the vicinity of}} a number of species of woody shrub in Palm Canyon Wash, {{this may be due to}} low soil disturbance by vehicles, foot traffic, and horses near woody vegetation.|$|R

The hunting {{behaviour}} of the Barn Owl Tyto alba of <b>June</b> <b>Beetles</b> Polyphylla fullo is hereby described from the finding of a pellet containing a high level of remains of this Coleopteran. The exploitation of this resource appears to be opportunistic and may be caused by the superabundance of this beetle from May to July in the area of S’Albufera known as Ses Puntes...|$|R

50|$|Phyllophaga is a {{very large}} genus (more than 260 species) of New World scarab beetles in the {{subfamily}} Melolonthinae. Common names for this genus and many other related genera in the subfamily Melolonthinae are May <b>beetles,</b> <b>June</b> bugs, and <b>June</b> <b>beetles.</b> They range in size from 12 to 35 mm and are blackish or reddish-brown in colour, without prominent markings, and often rather hairy ventrally. These beetles are nocturnal, coming to lights in great numbers.|$|R
50|$|Females burrow into {{ground in}} search of grubs, {{particularly}} those of the green <b>June</b> <b>beetle,</b> Cotinis nitida, and the Japanese beetle, Popillia japonica. The wasp stings the grub and frequently burrows farther down to construct a cell and lay an egg on the host. The larva pupates and overwinters inside {{the body of the}} host.|$|R
50|$|The Death Valley <b>June</b> <b>beetle</b> (Polyphylla erratica) is a scarab beetle in the {{subfamily}} Melolonthinae. It is {{only known}} {{to occur in}} the drainage basin of the Amargosa River in the southwestern United States.Saltgrass communities, such as those at Saratoga Springs in Death Valley, provide habitat for the insect at all stages of its life.|$|R
50|$|The Zayante sandhills {{ecosystem}} is {{not only}} home to the endangered Zayante band-winged grasshopper, but also to other unique species, {{many of which are}} on the endangered species list, including the Mount Hermon <b>June</b> <b>beetle,</b> Santa Cruz wallflower, Ben Lomond buckwheat, Bonny Doon manzanita, Ben Lomond spineflower, and the Santa Cruz kangaroo rat (Donald J. Barry 2000).|$|R
50|$|Polyphylla barbata is a {{rare species}} of beetle known by the common name Mount Hermon <b>June</b> <b>beetle.</b> It is endemic to California, where it occurs only in Santa Cruz County. There is only a single {{occurrence}} of the beetle on a stretch of territory of under 1500 acre. This is a federally listed endangered species of the United States.|$|R
50|$|The grapevine beetle, Pelidnota punctata, {{also known}} as the spotted <b>June</b> <b>beetle</b> or the spotted pelidnota, is a species of beetle, a member of the {{subfamily}} Rutelinae of the Scarab beetle family. Grapevine beetles are common in the north and central United States and Eastern Canada, but do relatively little damage to their host plants. The beetles fly at a fast speed, usually in a curving flight.|$|R
50|$|The green <b>June</b> <b>beetle</b> {{is active}} during {{daylight}} hours. The adult is usually 15 - 22 mm long with dull, metallic green wings; its sides are gold and the head, legs and underside are very bright shiny green. Their habitat extends from Maine to Georgia, {{and as far}} west as Kansas, with possible population crossover in Texas with their western cousin, the figeater beetle.|$|R
50|$|There are {{nineteen}} species {{endemic to}} the Santa Rosa and San Jacinto Mountains National Monument area. These species require or {{are restricted to}} a small geographical area which makes them vulnerable to habitat disturbance. A few of these species are Johnston's rockcress, Casey's <b>June</b> <b>beetle,</b> Coachella Valley round-tailed ground squirrel, Munz's mariposa lily, San Jacinto bush snapdragon, Santa Rosa Mountain linanthus, Tahquitz ivesia, and Ziegler’s aster.|$|R
5000|$|Phyllophaga nebulosa is {{a species}} of <b>june</b> <b>beetle</b> endemic to Jones Lake State Park in North Carolina. This species was {{discovered}} by Maxi Polihronakis at Jones Lake State Park when she could not recognize some of the beetles she had collected for her research. This beetle is nocturnal and was discovered living in sandy soil near conifers, which is unusual for members of its genus.|$|R
50|$|The San Vicente Redwoods land is home {{to several}} species of wild animals {{threatened}} by the destruction of old-growth forest in the Santa Cruz Mountains. Native animals of particular interest include the California red-legged frog, a federally listed threatened species, and the endangered Marbled murrelet. The endangered Mount Hermon <b>June</b> <b>beetle</b> and Zayante band-winged grasshopper are both endemic to this area.The Santa Cruz Puma Project uses the area for research on North American cougar.|$|R
40|$|Phyllophaga adults (<b>June</b> <b>beetles)</b> were {{surveyed}} from 1984 through 1987 at five locations in Wisconsin using black light traps. Data were collected at each location for three consecutive years. A total of 9, 259 specimens representing 13 species were {{collected during the}} survey. Species captured, sex ratios, and flight periods for abundant species were recorded for each location. Species abundance differed from previous surveys of Phyllophaga in Wisconsin. Possible reasons for observed shifts in species abundance are discussed...|$|R
5000|$|The species M. pectoralis looks similar, but its pygidium is rounded. The {{cockchafer}} {{should not}} be confused with the similar European chafer (Rhizotrogus majalis), which has a completely different life cycle, nor with the <b>June</b> <b>beetles</b> (Phyllophaga spp.), which are native to North America, nor with the summer chafer (or [...] "European June bug", Amphimallon solstitiale), which emerges in June and has a two-year life cycle. (All of these are Scarabaeidae, have white grubs, and are turf pests.) ...|$|R
40|$|Immature grubs of the tenlined <b>June</b> <b>beetle</b> are {{establishment}} pests of poplar. Cuttings used {{to propagate}} and establish hybrid poplars on land used previously for pasture or irrigated crops often fail due to grub feeding behavior. Loss of one cutting {{is of no}} consequence because adjacent trees will fill in the canopy; however, grub populations are grouped, and loss of nine or more adjacent trees can cause {{an opening in the}} canopy for years or {{the entire length of the}} rotation...|$|R
5000|$|Pelecinus polyturator {{is a large}} (up to 7 cm) glossy black wasp, {{the most}} common and {{familiar}} species in the family Pelecinidae. The adults drink nectar. They live in crop fields, woods, and suburban gardens throughout North, Central, and South America. Their antennae are long and the females have an elongated, cylindrical, articulated metasoma. They are parasitoids that lay their eggs directly into grubs of the <b>June</b> <b>beetle</b> (genus Phyllophaga) buried in the soil. The adults {{can be found in the}} late summer.|$|R
50|$|The beetle has {{a two-year}} {{development}} cycle. The larvae feed on plant roots and humus. The larvae pupate in late May. In late <b>June,</b> adult <b>beetles</b> surface from the soil.|$|R
50|$|The ten-lined <b>June</b> <b>beetle</b> (Polyphylla decemlineata), {{also known}} as the {{watermelon}} beetle, is a scarab beetle, living in the western United States and Canada. The adults are attracted to light and feed on foliage. They can make a hissing sound when touched or otherwise disturbed, which can resemble the hissing of a bat. This sound is made by their wings pushing down, forcing the air out between their wings and back. They can be an agricultural pest affecting a wide range of crops because their larvae feed on plant roots and can weaken or kill the plants.|$|R
50|$|There are {{two species}} endemic to the Sandhills that are federally listed as endangered: the Zayante band-winged {{grasshopper}} and the Mount Hermon <b>June</b> <b>beetle.</b> Also {{occurring in the}} Sandhills is the narrow-faced kangaroo rat. The rodent's name comes from the jumping style of movement, resembling the Australian kangaroo. Bird species observed include the long-eared owl, pileated woodpecker and Townsend's warbler. Other wildlife are the species common to forested mountain terrains like the coyote, black-tailed deer, mountain lion and raccoon. There are several species of bat, including the big brown bat, one of several species of bat afflicted with the white nose fungus.|$|R
50|$|Cotinis mutabilis, {{also known}} as the figeater beetle (also green fruit beetle or fig beetle), {{is a member of the}} scarab beetle family. It belongs to the {{subfamily}} Cetoniinae, comprising a group of beetles commonly called flower chafers since many of them feed on pollen, nectar, or petals. Its habitat is primarily the southwestern United States and Mexico. Figeater beetles are often mistaken for green <b>June</b> <b>beetles</b> (Cotinis nitida) and occasionally Japanese beetles (Popillia japonica), which occur in the eastern US; however, they are not considered to be an important pest because they do not damage lawns as larvae and trees as much as their eastern cousins.|$|R
50|$|Saratoga Springs is {{a desert}} oasis located in {{southern}} Death Valley National Park in California. The wetland {{lies at the}} southern tip of the Ibex Hills, on the floor of Death Valley and just northeast of the Amargosa River. Several springs overflow into pools totaling 6.6 acres (2.7 ha) in area, making the site the third largest marsh in the park. The pools provide habitat for several endemic species, including the Saratoga Springs pupfish. Other rare species present include the Amargosa tryonia snail, the Amargosa springsnail, the Saratoga Springs belostoma bug, the Amargosa naucorid bug, and the Death Valley <b>June</b> <b>beetle.</b> Plant life includes common reeds, bulrush and saltgrass.|$|R
