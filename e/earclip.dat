Preliminary arguments have been advanced which suggest that the modes of action are not identical, although, by a mobilization of sugar and glycogen, oestrone may be assisted in its action by the starch effect. In the present paper an attempt is made to distinguish further between the mitosis-stimulating actions of these two substances. In {{the course of the}} investigation it became obvious that the epidermal mitosis rate of the female mouse differs markedly from that of the male, and an analysis of this related point is also included. MATERIAL AND METHODS The animals used were all adults of the Kreyberg's white label and Strong's CBA strains, and no obvious differences were found between them. The details of the methods of feeding, heating and lighting are given in a paper by Bullough [1946] in which are also described the vaginal smear technique, the oestrone injection technique, the <b>earclip</b> technique, and the method of estimating the epidermal mitosis rate. In the course of the present experiments colchicine was also used in conjunction with the <b>earclip</b> technique. OBSERVATIONS The action of starch In studying the mitogenic effect of starch injections, it was an advantage to use mice which were in the first day of dioestrus, since at this time the mitotic activity of the whole body is at a minimum [Bullough, 1946]. In Table 1 and Fig. 1 are recorded the details of the changes in the epidermal mitosis rate of ten control mice which were untreated, and of ten mice which each received a subcutaneous injection of 20 mg. starch dissolved in 0 - 4 ml. normal saline. The injection was given at 10. 00 hr. when the first earclips were also removed. Further clips were taken at hourly intervals until 16. 00 hr. This 6 hr. period covered the waking time about 10. 00 hr., when the animals were accustomed to being fed, and the resting time about 14. 00 hr., when they were normally asleep. The results show that a pronounced reaction to the starch injection had already developed after only 2 hr. The maximum response appeared after 3 hr., and the mitosis rate continued above normal {{until the end of the}} experiment. A compariso...|$|E
