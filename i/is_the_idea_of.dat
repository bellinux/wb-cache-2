5|$|Another popular view among {{critics of}} the bombings, {{originating}} with Gar Alperovitz in 1965 and becoming the default position in Japanese school history textbooks, <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>idea</b> <b>of</b> atomic diplomacy: that the United States used nuclear weapons in order to intimidate the Soviet Union {{in the early stages}} of the Cold War.|$|E

50|$|These two mid-18th-century {{schools of}} thought — one seeing {{perfection}} in nature and in the past, {{and the other in}} civilization and in the future — represented a reaction not against <b>the</b> <b>idea</b> <b>of</b> perfection, but against its transcendental interpretation: as, earlier, the measure <b>of</b> perfection had <b>been</b> <b>the</b> <b>idea</b> <b>of</b> God, so now it <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>idea</b> <b>of</b> nature or of civilization. It <b>was</b> <b>the</b> latter <b>idea</b> that ultimately gained the upper hand and passed into the 19th century as the legacy of the Enlightenment.|$|R

25|$|One {{version of}} this <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>idea</b> <b>of</b> {{promoting}} international understanding between nations through the international mobility of students - an idea most powerfully advanced by Cecil Rhodes {{in the creation of}} the Rhodes Scholarships, and his successors such as J.

25|$|One {{traditional}} {{aspect of}} classical music that Hindemith retains <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>idea</b> <b>of</b> dissonance resolving to consonance. Much of Hindemith's music begins in consonant territory, progresses rather smoothly into dissonance, and resolves at the end in full, consonant chords. This is especially apparent in his Concert Music for Strings and Brass.|$|E
25|$|In some service industries, {{especially}} health care, {{dispute resolution}} and social services, a popular concept <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>idea</b> <b>of</b> the caseload, {{which refers to}} {{the total number of}} patients, clients, litigants, or claimants for which a given employee is responsible. Employees must balance the needs of each individual case against the needs of all other current cases as well as their own needs.|$|E

25|$|The three escallop shells upon a fess {{were taken}} from the armorial {{bearings}} of the La Trobe family and signify the La Trobe name. What is also important about the escallops is that they are a sign of a pilgrim and the journey that an individual must undertake to achieve spiritual, {{or in the case of}} the university, intellectual enlightenment. It <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>idea</b> <b>of</b> the journey that is particularly significant within the university's arms, as evidenced by the escallop shell clasped by the eagle in the crest.|$|E
25|$|Another {{evolutionary}} hypothesis for {{vulnerability to}} pre-eclampsia <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>idea</b> <b>of</b> ensuring pair-bonding between {{the mother and}} father and paternal investment in the fetus. Researchers posit that pre-eclampsia is an adaptation for the mother to terminate investment in a fetus that might have an unavailable paternal donor, as determined by repeated semen exposure of the paternal donor to the mother. Various studies have shown that women who frequently had exposure to partners’ semen before conception had a reduced risk of pre-eclampsia. Also, subsequent pregnancies by the same paternal donor had a reduced risk of pre-eclampsia while subsequent pregnancies by a different paternal donor had a higher risk of developing pre-eclampsia.|$|E
25|$|One major {{expression}} of that, {{which is the}} first clear Reform doctrine to have been formulated, <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>idea</b> <b>of</b> universal Messianism. The belief in redemption was unhinged from the traditional elements of return to Zion and restoration of the Temple and the sacrificial cult therein, and turned into a general hope for salvation. This was later refined when the notion of a personal Messiah who would reign over Israel was officially abolished and replaced by the concept of a Messianic Age, of universal harmony and perfection. The considerable loss of faith in human progress around World War II greatly shook this ideal, but it endures as a precept of Reform.|$|E

25|$|Schleiermacher's {{doctrine}} of knowledge accepts the fundamental principle of Kant {{that knowledge is}} bounded by experience, but it seeks to remove Kant's scepticism as to knowledge of the ding an sich (the noumenon) or Sein, as Schleiermacher's term <b>is.</b> <b>The</b> <b>idea</b> <b>of</b> knowledge or scientific thought as distinguished from the passive form of thought — of aesthetics and religion — is thought which is produced by all thinkers in the same form and which corresponds to being. All knowledge {{takes the form of}} the concept (Begriff) or the judgment (Urteil), the former conceiving the variety of being as a definite unity and plurality, and the latter simply connecting the concept with certain individual objects.|$|E
25|$|The core of {{the concept}} of runaway climate change <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>idea</b> <b>of</b> a large {{positive}} feedback within the climate system. When a change in global temperature causes an event to occur which itself changes global temperature, this is referred to as a feedback effect. If this effect acts {{in the same direction as}} the original temperature change, it is a destabilising positive feedback (e.g. warming causing more warming); and if in the opposite direction, it is a stabilising negative feedback (e.g. warming causing a cooling effect). If a sufficiently strong net positive feedback occurs, it is said that a climate tipping point has been passed and the temperature will continue to change until the changed conditions result in negative feedbacks that restabilise the climate.|$|E
25|$|Smoothing, or spatial filtering, <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>idea</b> <b>of</b> {{averaging}} the intensities {{of nearby}} voxels to produce a smooth spatial map of intensity change across the brain or region of interest. The averaging is often done by convolution with a Gaussian filter, which, at every spatial point, weights neighboring voxels by their distance, with the weights falling exponentially following the bell curve. If the true spatial extent of activation, that is {{the spread of the}} cluster of voxels simultaneously active, matches the width of the filter used, this process improves the signal-to-noise ratio. It also makes the total noise for each voxel follow a bell-curve distribution, since adding together a large number of independent, identical distributions of any kind produces the bell curve as the limit case. But if the presumed spatial extent of activation does not match the filter, signal is reduced.|$|E

25|$|In this schema, {{three main}} {{prerequisites}} are posited for globalization to occur. The first <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>idea</b> <b>of</b> Eastern Origins, which shows how Western states have adapted and implemented learned principles from the East. Without the traditional {{ideas from the}} East, Western globalization would not have emerged the way it did. The second is distance. The interactions amongst states were not {{on a global scale}} and most often were confined to Asia, North Africa, the Middle East, and certain parts of Europe. With early globalization, it was difficult for states to interact with others that were not within close proximity. Eventually, technological advances allowed states to learn of others' existence and another phase of globalization was able to occur. The third has to do with interdependency, stability, and regularity. If a state is not dependent on another, then there is no way for either state to be mutually affected by the other. This is one of the driving forces behind global connections and trade; without either, globalization would not have emerged the way it did and states would still be dependent on their own production and resources to function. This is one of the arguments surrounding the idea of early globalization. It is argued that archaic globalization did not function in a similar manner to modern globalization because states were not as interdependent on others as they are today.|$|E
500|$|Executive {{producer}} Frank Spotnitz {{was inspired}} to write the episode after watching the 1972 American thriller film Deliverance. Spotnitz recounted, [...] "the idea of being stranded in a hostile environment is very interesting to me and so <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>idea</b> <b>of</b> something moving the brush that you can't see." [...] Series writer Vince Gilligan contributed to the [...] "team builder" [...] exercise bit. The ending was left intentionally ambiguous. Spotnitz explained, [...] "it's scarier if you think [...] could still be out there." ...|$|E
500|$|Sometimes emergentists use {{the example}} of water having a new {{property}} when Hydrogen H and Oxygen O combine to form H2O (water). In this example there [...] "emerges" [...] a new property of a transparent liquid {{that would not have}} been predicted by understanding hydrogen and oxygen as gases. This is analogous to physical properties of the brain giving rise to a mental state. Emergentists try to solve the notorious mind–body gap this way. One problem for emergentism <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>idea</b> <b>of</b> [...] "causal closure" [...] in the world that does not allow for a mind-to-body causation.|$|E

500|$|According to Ganesan, {{the main}} theme of Andha Naal is patriotism; {{for him the}} film {{suggests}} that if a country does not appreciate its talented young men's efforts, they could turn against the nation. Regarding the more personal undertones, Ganesan said that the film tells how unemployment and desolation can lead young people to become traitors. Rajan becomes a traitor by selling Indian secrets to Japan because his idea {{was rejected by the}} Indian government. According to Guy, Andha Naal reuses the thematic line of the 1946 Tamil film Chitra: [...] "a person sending secret messages to the enemy through radio". Swarnavel Eswaran Pillai compared Pandari Bai's [...] "ideologically driven" [...] character Usha in the film to her character in Parasakthi, but in the former, [...] "it <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>idea</b> <b>of</b> the Indian nation that she pledges her allegiance to." [...] The Times of India compared Andha Naal to Citizen Kane (1941) for its similar lighting and camera angles.|$|E
500|$|Casting Crowns' lead vocalist Mark Hall {{has stated}} that the band's songs [...] "have always come from our {{ministry}} in the church. They start as messages on Wednesday night, things we're teaching our teenagers and their families"; Until the Whole World Hears retains that same formula. Hall also stated that the musical sound of their songs is written {{so as not to}} conflict or detract from the lyrics, comparing the musical elements of his songs to a plate that the 'meat', the lyrics, are served on. A philosophy that [...] "fuels" [...] the album <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>idea</b> <b>of</b> putting [...] "faith in action"; Hall stated that he wanted believers to become more active in their faith, and to [...] "get out of their pews and get involved in what God is doing". [...] "Always Enough" [...] was written when a member of Hall's church was killed in Afghanistan; the band was unable to attend his funeral, as they were {{on the other side of}} the United States and couldn't cancel their tour dates. Another song on the album, the title track, was inspired by the Biblical character of John the Baptist. Several songs on the album are reinventions of hymns, which Hall enjoyed experimenting with; Hall retained the lyrics of the songs while reworking their melodies.|$|E
500|$|In December 2009, Gaga {{revealed}} that {{she planned to}} cancel {{the concept of the}} original shows of The Monster Ball Tour and start afresh. She felt that the revamp of the show was needed as the original tour was constructed in a very short span of time. Gaga recalled that after West and she split up for this tour, she was unsure if she could get a show together in time, but nevertheless wanted to promote The Fame Monster. Hence she was able to put together [...] "something that, in truth, I never would have done if I had a longer amount of time". The revamp of the tour was planned from the arena shows in the United Kingdom from February 2010. [...] "My team thinks I'm completely psychotic. But I don't fucking care what they think. [...] Well, just to give you an idea, the stage is about four {{times the size of the}} one we're on now and conceptually, it's completely different. One thing that has been lost over the past 10-15 years, in pop music, <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>idea</b> <b>of</b> showbiz. And this is definitely going to bring that back", clarified Gaga. According to James Montgomery of MTV, the show recalled the film musicals The Wizard of Oz (1939) and West Side Story (1961), the science-fiction film Metropolis (1927), and the television mini-series Angels in America (2003).|$|E
