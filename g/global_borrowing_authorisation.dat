40|$|This {{presentation}} {{deals with}} the Pentecostal cosmopolitanism as expressed in Kinshasaâs popular culture, in particular in locally produced evangelising TV serials. These reference Nigerian witchcraft films, American soaps, Biblical tales, rumours, local epic tales, and Congolese rumba (urban dance music). Despite the various cultural influences, the television serials present a very local, urban lifeworld, one which is very familiar both for the television actors and their audiences. I take the different layers of the evangelising teleserials and the various cultural borrowings {{that make up the}} fictive worlds of television drama as a starting point to reflect on the design of Kinshasaâs Pentecostal popular culture. African Pentecostalism is said to be utterly <b>global,</b> <b>borrowing</b> from Western, capitalist worlds while diabolising and thus jettisoning local, âtraditionalâ realities. The forceful rejection of ancestral and âoldâ ways of being-in-the-world is nevertheless also a way of recuperating these practices, be it in the negative. Although Pentecostalism promotes a particular lifestyle based on âPentecostal universalsâ, in each society where Pentecostalism is being practiced, it blends with local beliefs and lifestyles, thus allowing the emergence of historical and vernacular versions of Pentecostalism. Kinshasaâs Pentecostal popular culture upholds a cosmpolitanism inspired by Western, Congolese and Nigerian images and sounds. It is this interplay of local and global, African and non-African texts and images, religious and cultural, that will be scrutinized in this presentation in order to further our knowledge of African types of Pentecostalism and also the hybridity of contemporary African media products. status: publishe...|$|R

40|$|Globalization, {{some legal}} {{scholars}} suggest, {{is a force}} that makes increasing convergence among different countries 2 ̆ 7 constitutions more or less inevitable. This Essay explores this hypothesis by analyzing both the logic – and potential limits – to four different mechanisms of constitutional convergence: first, changes in global “superstructure”; second, comparative learning; third, international coercion; and fourth, global competition. For each mechanism, it shows, quite special conditions will in fact be required before global convergence is likely even {{at the level of}} legal policy. At a constitutional level, it further suggests, it will be even rarer for these mechanisms to create wholesale convergence. This also has direct implications for ongoing debates over the desirability of constitutional decision-makers seeking to engage in <b>global</b> learning or <b>borrowing...</b>|$|R
40|$|This paper {{focuses on}} the problem of {{choosing}} a prior for an unknown random effects distribution within a Bayesian hierarchical model. The goal is to obtain a sparse representation by allowing a combination of <b>global</b> and local <b>borrowing</b> of information. A local partition process prior is proposed, which induces dependent local clustering. Subjects can be clustered together for a subset of their parameters, and one learns about similarities between subjects increasingly as parameters are added. Some basic properties are described, including simple two-parameter expressions for marginal and conditional clustering probabilities. A slice sampler is developed which bypasses the need to approximate the countably infinite random measure in performing posterior computation. The methods are illustrated using simulation examples, and an application to hormone trajectory data. Copyright 2009, Oxford University Press. ...|$|R
40|$|In {{spite of}} Ping Chong¡¯s {{reputation}} in the American theatre scene, little {{has been done to}} explore his artistic works from a fully theorized perspective. In this dissertation, I propose a category of ¡°cultural narrative texts¡± to investigate cultural and historical themes of ¡°culture and the other¡± in Chong¡¯s fascinating ethno-historiographic fables. The poetics and politics of Chong¡¯s narrative texts are the subject of this dissertation. The frames of myth and narratology in their constructive aspects (how the mythic narratives are expressed) provide the poetics part. I adopt the literary approaches of Northrop Frye and Kenneth Burke for their intense studies on image (narrative unit), rhetoric (narrative signification), and emplotment (narrative sequence). In a connective linkage from poetics, the politics part engages the cultural and historical thematics through which I read what is expressed in Chong¡¯s (counter-) myths on people, cultures, and histories. For this complex thematic part, I construe a theoretical bricolage of a broad range of disciplines and methodologies, from psychoanalysis, cognitive science, anthropology, historiography, sociology, to poststructuralism, postcolonialism, and feminism. This dissertation deals with Chong¡¯s ethno-historiographic fables throughout his theatrical career over three decades, examining how his deconstructive myth-making wrestles with the problematic notion of ¡°the other¡± in both local (national) and <b>global</b> aspects. <b>Borrowing</b> Julia Kristeva¡¯s socially informed psychoanalysis, I approach Chong¡¯s concept of ¡°the other¡± as ¡°social abject¡± inhibiting at the margins. I argue that through Chong¡¯s (counter-) myth-making which destabilizes the authority of hegemonic narratives of the incompatible split between the self and the other, multiple voices of the marginalized return, and the monologue of the hegemonic culture is interrupted. In this dissertation, I demonstrate how the performance of Chong¡¯s (counter-) narratives, what I call ¡°voicing back,¡± resist the silence, enabling the marginalized abject to become the subjects of their own desires and histories. This ¡°voicing back¡± in its shared political languages of respect, equality, and justice (toward the others) prepares for the performance of a democracy which is based on the complete modes of speech acts, speaking and listening...|$|R
40|$|International Framework Agreements (IFAs) {{constitute}} a significant attempt {{for the global}} governance of labour. IFAs are negotiated documents between global union federations and multinational companies that stipulate compliance with core labour rights and whose application extends to company operations worldwide. IFAs are a rather novel phenomenon. The first agreement was signed in 1988 while {{the overwhelming majority of}} the current total of 75 have been concluded since 2002. Although literature on IFAs is increasing, there are significant gaps on their impact in the host countries and supplier sites of the signatory companies. The thesis examines the local impact of three IFAs analyzing and assessing processes and outcomes of implementation, enforcement of compliance and monitoring. The empirical focus is on Latin America and the telecoms, energy and apparel sectors. Methodologically, the thesis adopts a comparative case study design with embedded cases while employing different methods: a small-scale survey, face-to-face interviews and internal documentation. Conceptually, the study adopts a <b>global</b> governance perspective <b>borrowing</b> notions largely established in international political economy and applying them to an industrial relations problem. The thesis finally draws a number of policy implications for global unions, multinationals and the International Labour Organization. EThOS - Electronic Theses Online ServiceAlexander S.

40|$|Sub-Saharan African {{countries}} {{as a group}} showed a considerable reduction in public and external indebtedness in the early 2000 s {{as a result of}} debt relief programs, higher economic growth and improved fiscal management for some countries. More recently, however, vulnerabilities in some countries are on the rise, including a few with very rapid debt accumulation. This paper looks at the heterogeneous experiences across Sub-Saharan African countries and the detailed dynamics that have driven changes in public debt since the <b>global</b> financial crisis. <b>Borrowing</b> to support fiscal deficits since 2009, including through domestic markets and Eurobond issuance, has driven a net increase in public debt for all countries except oil exporters benefitting from buoyant commodity prices and fragile states receiving post- 2008 HIPC relief. Current account deficits and FDI inflows drove the external debt dynamics, with high balance of payments problems associated with very rapid external debt accumulation in some cases. Pockets of increasing vulnerabilities of debt financing profiles and sensitivity of debt burden indicators to macro-fiscal shocks require close monitoring. Specific risks that policy-makers in Sub-Saharan Africa need to pay attention to going forward include the recent fall in oil prices, the slowdown in China and the sluggish recovery in Europe, dependence on non-debt creating flows and accounting for contingent liabilitie...|$|R
40|$|By way of overview, {{we set out}} in this Foreword some core {{elements}} {{of the concept of}} Global Administrative Law that animates this symposium; these ideas are developed in greater detail in the framing paper by Kingsbury, Krisch and Stewart. 2 We then note briefly some of the many elements that are developed in the other nine papers in the symposium. Taken together, these symposium contributions provide substantial evidence that a Global Administrative Law is emerging within a global administrative space, and that this field of law and practice is worthy of study, theorizing, and more systematic and reflective development. The contributions also confirm that this emerging field is highly variegated: Global Administrative Law is emerging in different ways in different settings involving different types of regimes and subjects of regulation, building different structures and procedures of accountability, to suit different needs, in response to different actors and incentives. Global Administrative Law is evolving through observation, critique, and borrowing across national legal systems that are increasingly interdependent. Different systems of national administrative law are also furnishing concepts for <b>global</b> regimes to <b>borrow.</b> Those regimes are also developing independent and novel responses to their specific institutional setting and accountability issues. This symposium represents a first effort to survey the different {{elements of}} these important trends and pose questions for further analysis and development of the field of Global Administrative Law...|$|R
40|$|In {{this paper}} I examine the role Greece {{has played in}} the recent global {{financial}} crisis, specifically {{as it relates to}} their own current account predicament. I will identify the causes of the Greek debt crisis, as well as analyze empirically several main components of the decline in the current account. I will also put to use some basic econometric models to forecast potential long-run outcomes of the situation. Greece has {{been at the forefront of}} the global financial crisis since it became evident in 2009 that the country’s public debt was not sustainable. In the years leading up to the <b>global</b> recession, Greece <b>borrowed</b> heavily to finance the government budget. However, because of weak enforcement of revenue collection, inflexible economic structures and a number of other issues, the debt began to accumulate. In addition, the European Union’s (EU) weak enforcement of rules concerning deficit ceilings has also contributed to what has become a serious sovereign debt crisis involving other Eurozone countries. After several attempted bailouts by the EU and IMF, numerous other rescue plans have been proposed, all with varying degrees of success. I will study these policy adjustments to identify the potential consequences the Greek crisis will have on other Eurozone countries, the United States, and the rest of the world. B. S.

40|$|Although Europe in the {{aggregate}} is a not {{a major contributor to}} global current account imbalances, its trade and financial linkages {{with the rest of the}} world mean that it will still be affected by a shift in the current configuration of external deficits and surpluses. We assess the macroeconomic impact on Europe of global current account adjustment under alternative scenarios, emphasizing both trade and financial channels. Finally, we consider heterogeneous exposure across individual European economies to external adjustment shocks.
