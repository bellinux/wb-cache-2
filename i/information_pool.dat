50|$|Cultural Schema Theory {{is often}} {{compared}} and {{contrasted with the}} Cultural Consensus Theory. Both theories present distinct perspectives {{about the nature of}} individual and cultural knowledge. However, unlike the Cultural Schema Theory, the Cultural Consensus Theory helps to describe and mathematically measure the extent to which cultural beliefs are shared. The central idea is the use of the pattern of agreement or consensus among members of the same culture. Essentially, the more knowledge people have, the more consensus is observed among them. Unfortunately, the Cultural Consensus Theory does not help others to better understand intracultural variability or how cultural knowledge is interrelated at a cognitive level. Cultural Consensus Theory anticipates intracultural variation but views variation as analogous to performance on a cultural test, with certain individuals functioning as better guides than others to the cultural <b>information</b> <b>pool</b> (Garro, 2000).|$|E

The database defines functional elements into ten types: promoter regions, CpG islands,5' untranslated regions (5'-UTRs), translation start sites, splice sites, coding exons, introns, translation stop sites, polyadenylation signals, and 3' UTRs. People may reference this database for haplotype information or obtain a flanking sequence for genotyping. This may help in finding mutations that contribute to common and polygenic diseases. Researchers can manually choose a group of SNPs of special interest for certain functional elements along with their corresponding sequences. [...] The database combines information from sources such as HapMap, UCSC GoldenPath, dbSNP, OMIM, and TRANSFAC. Users can obtain information about tagSNPs and simulate LD blocks for each gene.

The core of the Management Middleware is an <b>information</b> <b>pool</b> in which specific decision relevant information of the entire corporation are stored. In contrast to a data warehouse, the <b>information</b> <b>pool</b> is not a read-only data store, but a read-write information junction which allows for information input by decentralized units and, at the same time, allows the access to information stored by headquarters or other limits. Only a two way information center supports the creation of management information and at the same time enables a decentralized, but integrated decision-making and corporate management. The decentralized business units own data marts which contain specific decision relevant information adapted to their individual decision problems. ...|$|E

40|$|Organizational {{research}} {{argues that}} under relational forms of governance {{a high degree}} of both <b>information</b> <b>pooling</b> and physical interaction are necessary for inter-organizational knowledge creation. Yet, recent studies of information and communication technologies (ICTs) suggest that both practices at the same time are sometimes unnecessary. We address this discrepancy by developing a framework whereby the intensity and proportion of these inter-organizational practices are affected by the object world congruence between designers within and across partnering firms, and the level to which a common information technology platform is embedded in their activity. Through a multi-level case study of a Frank Gehry construction project we illustrate how designers with highly congruent object worlds, due to a strongly embedded common information technology platform, could jointly create knowledge despite decreased physical interaction. Conversely, designers from firms with incongruent object worlds or with congruent object worlds lacking a strongly embedded common ICT platform demanded a higher degree of physical interaction for effective knowledge creation. Our research suggests a dynamic, evolutionary model of inter-organizational knowledge creation influenced by variation in object world congruence and the levels of embedding a common ICT platform.
