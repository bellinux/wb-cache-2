40|$|Antitrust {{concern about}} {{keiretsu}} shareholding ties is misplaced and {{at odds with}} economic reasoning and with empirical investigation. Holding stock <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>trading</b> partner slants the bargaining over product market variables {{in favor of the}} trading partner. Divesting such a stock interest accomplishes the reverse. The firm holding shares <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>trading</b> partner can credibly threaten to divest should the trading partner behave opportunistically. Divesting withdraws the bargaining advantage that the equity position had conferred. Therefore, a firm may establish a partial equity position <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>trading</b> partner to deter opportunism. Additionally, Japanese banks' shareholding in the companies to which they lend resolves agency problems and lowers borrowing costs. Organizing firms into cross-shareholding groups magnifies these favorable effects by assuring that direct shareholding by banks gives rise to indirect shareholding as well. Keiretsu shareholding ties impede U. S. exports to Japan because they lower the keiretsu members' costs of transacting with one another and not because they raise rivals' costs".

5|$|Several {{changes to}} the roster were made before the 2007–08 {{campaign}} as Toronto sought to reproduce the same form as the previous campaign.

Despite being defending division champions, the Raptors were widely tipped as outside contenders for the division and conference titles.
