5|$|Images 4 and 5 assume an {{overhead}} stream {{that is totally}} condensed into a liquid product using water or air-cooling. However, in many cases, the tower overhead is not easily condensed totally and the reflux drum must include a vent gas outlet stream. In yet other cases, the overhead stream may also contain water vapor because either the feed stream contains some water or some steam is injected into the <b>distillation</b> <b>tower</b> (which {{is the case in}} the crude oil distillation towers in oil refineries). In those cases, if the distillate product is insoluble in water, the reflux drum may contain a condensed liquid distillate phase, a condensed water phase and a non-condensible gas phase, which makes it necessary that the reflux drum also have a water outlet stream.|$|E
25|$|Industrial towers use reflux {{to achieve}} a more {{complete}} separation of products. Reflux refers to {{the portion of the}} condensed overhead liquid product from a distillation or fractionation tower that is returned to {{the upper part of the}} tower as shown in the schematic diagram of a typical, large-scale industrial <b>distillation</b> <b>tower.</b> Inside the tower, the downflowing reflux liquid provides cooling and condensation of the upflowing vapors thereby increasing the efficiency of the <b>distillation</b> <b>tower.</b> The more reflux that is provided for a given number of theoretical plates, the better the tower's separation of lower boiling materials from higher boiling materials. Alternatively, the more reflux that is provided for a given desired separation, the fewer the number of theoretical plates required. Chemical engineers must choose what combination of reflux rate and number of plates is both economically and physically feasible for the products purified in the distillation column.|$|E
500|$|Large-scale {{industrial}} fractionation towers use reflux {{to achieve}} more efficient separation of products. Reflux {{refers to the}} portion of the condensed overhead liquid product from a <b>distillation</b> <b>tower</b> that is returned to {{the upper part of the}} tower as shown in images 3 and 4. Inside the tower, the downflowing reflux liquid provides cooling and partial condensation of the upflowing vapors, thereby increasing the efficacy of the <b>distillation</b> <b>tower.</b> The more reflux that is provided, the better is the tower's separation of the lower boiling from the higher boiling components of the feed. [...] A balance of heating with a reboiler at the bottom of a column and cooling by condensed reflux at the top of the column maintains a temperature gradient (or gradual temperature difference) along the height of the column to provide good conditions for fractionating the feed mixture. Reflux flows at the middle of the tower are called pumparounds.|$|E

500|$|Image 3 {{depicts a}} simple {{continuous}} fractional <b>distillation</b> <b>tower</b> for separating a feed stream into two fractions, an overhead distillate product and a bottoms product. The [...] "lightest" [...] products (those {{with the lowest}} boiling point or highest volatility) exit {{from the top of}} the columns and the [...] "heaviest" [...] products (the bottoms, those with the highest boiling point) exit from the bottom of the column. [...] The overhead stream may be cooled and condensed using a water-cooled or air-cooled condenser. The bottoms reboiler may be a steam-heated or hot oil-heated heat exchanger, or even a gas or oil-fired furnace.|$|E
500|$|Another way of {{improving}} the separation in a distillation column {{is to use a}} packing material instead of trays. [...] These offer the advantage of a lower pressure drop across the column (when compared to plates or trays), beneficial when operating under vacuum. [...] If a <b>distillation</b> <b>tower</b> uses packing instead of trays, the number of necessary theoretical equilibrium stages is first determined and then the packing height equivalent to a theoretical equilibrium stage, known as the height equivalent to a theoretical plate (HETP), is also determined. [...] The total packing height required is the number of theoretical stages multiplied by the HETP.|$|E

25|$|In {{addition}} to heating up or cooling down fluids {{in just a}} single phase, heat exchangers can be used either to heat a liquid to evaporate (or boil) it or used as condensers to cool a vapor and condense it to a liquid. In chemical plants and refineries, reboilers used to heat incoming feed for <b>distillation</b> <b>towers</b> are often heat exchangers.|$|R
2500|$|Design and {{operation}} of a <b>distillation</b> <b>tower</b> depends on the feed and desired products. Given a simple, binary component feed, analytical methods such as the McCabe–Thiele method or the Fenske equation can be used. For a multi-component feed, simulation models are used both for design {{and operation}}. Moreover, the efficiencies of the vapor–liquid contact devices (referred to as [...] "plates" [...] or [...] "trays") used in distillation towers are typically {{lower than that of}} a theoretical 100% efficient equilibrium stage. Hence, a <b>distillation</b> <b>tower</b> needs more trays than the number of theoretical vapor–liquid equilibrium stages. A variety of models have been postulated to estimate tray efficiencies.|$|E

50|$|Vapor horns {{often find}} {{application}} on the inlet to crude oil vacuum <b>distillation</b> <b>towers,</b> where liquid entrainment {{can be quite}} detrimental to tower performance. It has been noted that in high vapor rate vacuum services, vapor horns have low levels of entrainment relative to similar technologies. In some cases, refiners have removed vapor horns within vacuum towers to reduce coking. While this does work as intended, {{it also has the}} unintended consequence of increasing carryover into heavy vacuum gas oil, thereby lowering its quality.|$|R

40|$|This work {{presents}} the mathematical formulation of a nonlinear programming (NLP) model which optimizes simultaneously crude oil blending and operating {{conditions for a}} system of several crude oil distillation units (CDUs) at a Colombian refinery. The CDU system consists of three industrial units processing a blending of five extra-heavy crude oils and producing two commercial fuels, Jet- 1 A and Diesel. The NLP model involves typical restrictions (e. g., flow rate according to capacity of pumps, distillation columns, etc.) and the heat integration of streams from atmospheric <b>distillation</b> <b>towers</b> (ADTs) and vacuum <b>distillation</b> <b>towers</b> (VDTs) with the heat exchanger networks for crude oil preheating. A metamodeling approach is used so as to represent the ADTs. Preheating networks are modeled with mass, energy balances, and design equations of each heat exchanger. The NLP model has been implemented in GAMS using CONOPT as solver. Different cases are solved by the NLP model such that the optimal case with less profit increment had an economical benefit of 13 % with respect to its case without optimization. In each optimal case the extra-heavy crude oils in the feed blending of each CDU required more severe operating conditions such as higher temperature of the crude oil {{at the entrance to}} the towers, greater flow rate of stripping steam at the bottom, and minor pressure of the tower tops...|$|R
