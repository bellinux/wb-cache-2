40|$|This report {{provides}} an overview of travel surveys, including literature review and background, as well as the motivation for the research and development of the Global Positioning System Automated Travel Diary (GPS-ATD). The system requirements and specifications for the device development are presented and discussed. In addition, the detailed architecture, hardware, software, and user interface design are included. Vehicular and personal GPS-ATD systems were developed to support comprehensive traveler behavior studies. The GPS-ATD {{provides an}} intuitive user interface to capture trip activity <b>information</b> (<b>trip</b> purpose, travel mode, etc.), with minimal user input and burden during travel surveys. Each survey participant interacts with their own personal GPS-ATD, and information is automatically coordinated between personal and vehicular GPS-ATD units via ZigBee wireless. The system captures and logs data from the High-Sensitivity GPS (HSGPS) receiver, allowing subsequent identification of corridors, route lengths, and regional and inter-regional trips. The primary sensor is the HSGPS receiver. For the vehicular GPS-ATD, inertial sensing (MEMS gyro and accelerometers) is also provided to fill in the gaps during GPS outages and cold starts. To obtain vehicle sensor information, the GPS-ATD uses ZigBee wireless communications to the car computer On-Boar...|$|E

40|$|Measurement of individuals’ driving {{exposure}} {{has traditionally}} relied on subjective self-report methods, {{which tend to}} be inaccurate and require substantial effort for the individuals volunteering for the study. The development of Global Positioning System (GPS) technology has provided a new option for accurately and objectively measuring exposure. However, some exposure <b>information</b> (<b>trip</b> purpose and driver identification) can most easily be obtained with self-report methods. Therefore, {{the purpose of this study}} was to evaluate the concurrent use of GPS data loggers and telephone-based travel diaries for measuring driving exposure. The driving of 54 participants (aged ≥ 75) was monitored for a period of one week. The GPS data loggers provided standard exposure measures (distance driven, time spent driving, number of trips), as well as measures that cannot be obtained through self-report (travelling speed, driving route) for all participants. The distance measured by GPS corresponded with distances obtained from the odometers in the vehicles, which indicated that the GPS measurements were accurate. Furthermore, the trips that were recorded by GPS were matched to the information reported in the travel diaries and, therefore, the purpose and driver of a majority (95. 2 %) of the trips could be identified. Also, a subset of the participants who were interviewed (n = 16) provided favourable feedback regarding the data collection process. The findings indicate that GPS technology will advance the measurement of driving exposure but that self-report methods are still useful for obtaining certain exposure information. Therefore, GPS technology may not replace traditional methods but complement them. Thompson, J. P., Baldock, M. R. J., Mathias, J. L., Wundersitz, L. N. [URL]...|$|E
40|$|Abstract The article {{presents}} {{development of a}} closed-form corridor choice model under hypothetical variable message sign (VMS) based traffic information. A single VMS board is assumed to display traffic information at a junction of two alternative and competitive traffic corridors connecting two catchment areas in Kolkata city, India. The corridor choice models are developed by combining revealed preference (RP) and stated preference (SP) data sources. The development of a combined RP-SP model is a challenging task as different data sources have their respective error terms. In this work, the data sources are combined by exploiting their respective merits; while discarding their respective de-merits. Here a procedure of developing composite utility function is presented, which is constituted of estimates of attributes from SP data source and alternative specific constant term of alternatives calibrated from RP data source, while fixing all coefficients of attributes at SP estimates. The construction of corridor choice models is demonstrated for two types of VMS based traffic information, which differs {{in terms of the}} content displayed on VMS board and also for two types of trip maker- namely private car and taxi. Under the influence of VMS-based traffic <b>information,</b> <b>trip</b> makers are found to take corridor choice decision based on the rational trade-off between travel time information and direct travel cost of alternative traffic corridors. The alternative-specific-constant term of choice models indicates that in presence of VMS-based information, private car trip makers are likely to be less biased to choose comparatively longer but almost free-flow traffic corridor (thereby less travel time corridor); while taxi trip makers {{are likely to be more}} biased to choose longer but almost free-flow traffic corridor to arrive at their destination...|$|E
40|$|Global Positioning System (GPS) or Smartphone {{technology}} has been increasingly used in travel data collection. Although GPS devices can directly record spatial and temporal <b>information,</b> <b>trip</b> ends, travel modes and trip purposes are not recorded. So GPS data processing becomes a critical procedure to produce these results, {{which can be used}} in transport planning. It has been proved that GPS records are more reliable than travel diaries; however, the quality of GPS data processing work usually influences the quality of results. Researchers have been engaging in the improvement of GPS data processing for the past decade. Traditionally, data processing for GPS records (from dedicated GPS loggers and Smartphones) includes three steps, namely trip identification, mode detection and purpose imputation. However, the results of mode and purpose detection are entirely based on the result of trip identification. Hence, the total accuracy of a GPS survey would be the product of the accuracy of each step. This thesis focuses on the improvement of travel data quality by improving data collection and processing. In this study, a new procedure is introduced which combines the process of trip identification and mode detection. Some general rules (i. e., a threshold of dwell time and the time interval for recording data) are tested. This research also firstly applies a new technology, a life-logging camera, to travel data collection. Images are used to help to pursue ground truth [...] especially recorded trips in which GPS data were missing [...] and detect some types of travel modes in order to improve the accuracy of data processing. An automating image processing procedure is proposed and tested in this study. In addition, a concept of “mode-point-chain” is discussed to identify the cases of mode change and modify incorrect mode detection results. For the process of purpose imputation, more travel information is suggested {{to be used in the}} process. This thesis also uses tour-based information in trip purpose imputation to improve the results. By using the new procedure, the trip identification accuracy was increased by almost 30 percent, taking the missing trips into account. Since trip identification and mode detection were combined, this increase also benefits mode detection results. With the help of image processing and the new procedure of mode change detection, the accuracy of mode detection increased by 7...|$|E
