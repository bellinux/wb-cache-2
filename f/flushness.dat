40|$|The {{installation}} <b>flushness</b> {{of pressure}} transducers {{has been found}} to strongly influence the quality of fluctuating surface pressure data in supersonic-attached turbulent boundary-layer flow. A systematic investigation of the effects of <b>flushness</b> on surface pressure fluctuations beneath a 4 -in. -thick boundary layer was conducted in a supersonic wind tunnel at Mach numbers of 1. 68, 2. 0, and 2. 5. <b>Flushness</b> effects on transducer signal amplitude, power spectral density, coherence, and narrowband convection velocity was evaluated. Results show that a very slightly protruding transducer produces adverse effects on the desired pressure fluctuation measurements, whereas a submerged transducer produces small effects. Indications are that a more viable method for enhancing the uniformity and spatial correlation of fluctuating surface pressure data can be achieved by deliberately submerging transducers beneath a surface orifice about 0. 010 in. deep...|$|E
40|$|AbstractFor a customer, one of {{the most}} {{appealing}} areas aesthetically in a passenger vehicle is the frontal and side closure of the vehicle. Especially the way the precision tolerances are achieved in cars. Hence the precision tolerance gives the aesthetic appeal for gap and <b>flushness.</b> It plays a vital role in the saleability of the vehicle. There are three priority areas of a passenger car which influences the prospective customer. The priority 1 includes the front-rear door and headlamp-hood interfaces. The priority 2 includes the A pillar to roof and front wind shield interfaces. The priority 3 includes door to rocker moulding and hood to grille interfaces. Here the importance is given to the customer's view perspective. For example, in a side closures (car door assembly), the front-rear door interfaces which lies between the B pillar and the rear door region is given importance since it has the high priority as seen by the customer (Priority 1). Whereas the door to rocker moulding interfaces which lies on the bottom surface of the car is given low priority (Priority 3). Based on these priorities the gap and <b>flushness</b> effectively achieved through the tolerance management. This research paper aims to investigate the influences of tolerancing methods and aspects of perceived quality on the side closures with respect to computer aided tolerancing, hinge positioning, Striker and hinge adjustments and hemming. These influences in turn gives the side closures superior aesthetic appeal, loyal customers and winning edge in the saleability of luxury cars in the global market...|$|E

Moreover, in present paper is experimentally investigated the influence of pressure transducer installation method on the measurement results. In results, the levels of the time-averaging result of wall pressure and rms value of the fluctuating wall pressure show lower value in the submergence case than <b>flushness</b> installation of pressure transducer. Its influential degree of time-averaging value mainly becomes low as increasing the diameter of pressure measuring hole size, however, {{it becomes clear that}} the rms value is almost independent of the installation method of transducer...|$|E

Present designs of scarf repairs are based on two-dimensional analyses of scarf joints, assuming a uniform stress distribution along the scarf. This report presents an improve design methodology for designing scarf repairs to composite laminates. With the aid of elastic-plastic analyses, a critical assessment of the current design methods has been carried out, with major emphasis being placed on the stress/strain concentration along the bondline. It is proposed to replace the shear stress criterion with the maximum strain criterion.

In order to benchmark {{the ability of}} engineering tools to predict water landing loads, test programs are underway for scale model and full-scale water impacts. These test programs are predicated on the reliable measurement of impact pressure histories. Tests have been performed {{with a variety of}} pressure transducers from various manufacturers. Both piezoelectric and piezoresistive devices have been tested. Effects such as thermal shock, pinching of the transducer head, and <b>flushness</b> of the transducer mounting have been studied. Data acquisition issues such as sampling rate and anti-aliasing filtering also have been studied.

Present designs of scarf repairs are based on two-dimensional analyses of scarf joints, assuming a uniform stress distribution along the scarf. The purpose of this investigation is to first critically assess {{the adequacy of the}} current design method, and then to develop an improved design methodology. Strain concentrations in the adhesive and the composite laminates are determined using the elastic-plastic finite element method, taking into account of the influence of stacking sequence, laminate thickness, and adhesive yielding. Three series of experiments have been carried out, involving joints between metallic and composite adherends, with matched and un-matched lay-ups. Based on the experimental findings of joints and the computational analyses of joints and repairs, an improved method has been proposed that accounts for local peak plastic strains due to non-uniform shear strain distribution.

40|$|This {{follow-on}} flight {{experiment on}} the TU- 144 LL Supersonic Flying Laboratory, {{conducted during the}} period September 1998 to April 1999, was a continuation of previous Structure/Cabin Noise Experiment 2. 1. Data was obtained {{over a wide range}} of altitudes and Mach numbers. Measured were: turbulent boundary layer pressure fluctuations on the fuselage over its length; structural response on skin panels using accelerometers; and flow direction over three windows using 'flow cones'. The effect of steps in the flow was also measured using two window blank pairs; each pair bridged by a plate which created small sharp forward and aft facing steps. The effect of transducer <b>flushness</b> with the exterior surface was also measured during flight. Height test points were chosen to cover much of the TU- 144 's flight envelope, as well as to obtain as large a unit Reynolds number range as possible at various Mach numbers: takeoff, subsonic, transonic, and supersonic cruise conditions up to Mach 2. Data on engine runups and background noise were acquired on the ground. The data in the form of time histories of the acoustic signals, together with auxiliary data and basic MATLAB processing modules, are available on CD-R disks...|$|E
40|$|Characterization of {{launch vehicle}} {{unsteady}} aerodynamics {{is a field}} best studied through experimentation, which is often {{carried out in the}} form of large scale wind tunnel testing. Measurement of the fluctuating pressures induced by the boundary layer noise is customarily made with miniature pressure transducers installed into a model of the vehicle of interest. Literature shows that noise level increases between two to five decibels (dB referenced to 20 micropascal) can be induced when the transducer surface is not mounted perfectly flush with the model outer surface. To reduce this artificially induced noise, special transducer holders have been used for aeroacoustic wind tunnel testing by NASA. This holder is a sleeve into which the transducer fits, with a cap that allows it to be mounted in a recessed hole in the model. A single hole in the holder allows the transport of the tunnel medium so the transducer can discriminate the fluctuating pressure due to the turbulent boundary layer noise. The holder is first dry fitted into the model and any difference in height between the holder and the model surface can be sanded flush. The holder is then removed from the model, the transducer glued inside the holder, and the holder replaced in the model, secured also with glue, thus eliminating the problem of noise level increases due to lack of <b>flushness.</b> In order to work with this holder design, special transducers have been ordered with their standard screen removed and the diaphragm moved as close {{to the top of the}} casing as possible to minimize any cavity volume. Although this greatly reduces induced noise due to the transducers being out of flush, the holders can also induce a cavity resonance that is usually at a very high frequency. This noise is termed transducer mount induced noise (XMIN). The peak of the mode can vary with the cavity depth, boundary layer noise that can excite the mode, tunnel flow medium, and the build of the transducers. Because the boundary layer flow interaction with the microphone holder seems to have some effect on the cavity resonance response, the NASA/Marshall Space Flight Center (MSFC) aeroacoustic team postulated that changing the design of the holder might reduce the cavity resonance response. An experiment was performed at the MSFC Trisonic Wind Tunnel comparing a new holder design with the traditional MSFC holder. The new holder design is intended to mimic the Kulite Semiconductors, Inc. B-screen, where the single hole of the traditional MSFC holder is replaced by a series of ten 0. 007 inch diameter holes. This particular design serves to protect the transducer diaphragm as in the manufacturer's B-screen, but also increases the frequency of the XMIN such that it is not apparent in the data collected from aeroacoustic wind tunnel tests. MSFC compared the two holder designs by installing two transducers in standard holders on one side of a ten inch long ten degree cone, and two transducers in B-screen holders on the opposite side for a series of runs at different conditions. Over 11 - 13 February, 2013, the model was run at Mach numbers between 0. 80 and 1. 96 at angles of attack at 0 deg, plus or minus 1 deg, plus or minus 2 deg, plus or minus 4 deg, and plus or minus 8 deg. Model roll attitudes at 0 deg, 90 deg, and 180 deg were tested to isolate potential tunnel bias. This paper presents results from the test showing that the proposed holder design significantly reduces the influence of XMIN on measured fluctuating pressure levels...|$|E
