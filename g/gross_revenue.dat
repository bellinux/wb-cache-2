5|$|After his death, MGM {{tried to}} {{continue}} with Romance of the Pink Panther and offered the role of Clouseau to Dudley Moore, who turned it down. The studio subsequently turned back to Blake Edwards, who was adamant not to recast the character, feeling certain {{that no one could}} adequately replace Sellers. In 1982 Edwards released Trail of the Pink Panther, which was composed entirely of deleted scenes from his past three Panther films. Frederick sued, claiming the use of the clips was a breach of contract; the court awarded her $1million ($ million today), plus 3.15 per cent of the film's profits and 1.36 per cent of its <b>gross</b> <b>revenue.</b>|$|E

Its general release in traditional theaters followed on June 16, 2000. Some critics praised the film while others singled out its uneven quality.

5|$|In 1994, the Delaware General Assembly {{approved}} {{slot machines}} for the state's three racetracks, {{and the first}} racino opened in December 1995. This helped the horse racing industry in Delaware, as approximately 10 percent of all <b>gross</b> <b>revenue</b> is used to increase the purses. This drew competition away from Maryland. Rosecroft could not fill up a 12-race card for its opening night during the 1996 season. An estimated $80 million in wagering was lost in 1996 from the effect of Delaware's casinos. Throughout the years, various politicians tried to bring slot machines or table games to Rosecroft, but all were unsuccessful.|$|E
5|$|Mughal-e-Azam was {{released}} on 5 August 1960 in 150cinemas across the country, establishing a record for the widest release for a Bollywood film.

Mughal-e-Azam also experienced a long theatrical run, screening to full capacity at the Maratha Mandir for three years. The film thus became the highest-grossing Bollywood film of all time by surpassing Mother India (1957), and retained this record until Sholay (1975) surpassed its net revenue. In terms of <b>gross</b> <b>revenue,</b> Mughal-e-Azam earned 110million.|$|E

5|$|Since the {{congestion}} charge introduction in 2003, over £1.2 billion has been invested in transport through December 2013, including £960 million on {{improvements to the}} bus network; £102 million on roads and bridges; £70 million on road safety; £51 million on local transport/borough plans; and £36 million on sustainable transport and the environment. There has been criticism because during the first ten years since the scheme was implemented, <b>gross</b> <b>revenue</b> reached about £2.6 billion, but only £1.2 billion has been invested, meaning that 54% of gross revenues have been spent in operating the system and administrative expenses.|$|E
5|$|Bommarillu was {{released}} worldwide with 72 prints. Owing {{to the success}} of the film, the number of reels grew to about hundred.

5|$|Sony Pictures Home Entertainment {{released}} {{the film in}} a DVD and Blu-ray disc combo pack in the United States on March 20, 2012.

The following week, the film sold an additional 144,000 copies generating $2.59 million in <b>gross</b> <b>revenue.</b> As of January 2014, 1,478,230 units had been sold, grossing $22,195,069.|$|E
5|$|Because {{of release}} schedules—especially {{in the case}} of films {{released}} {{towards the end of the}} year—and different release patterns across the world, many films can do business in two or more calendar years; therefore the grosses documented here are not confined to just the year of release. Grosses are not limited to original theatrical runs either, with many older films often being re-released periodically so the figures represent all the business a film has done since its original release; a film's first-run gross is included in brackets after the total if known. Because of incomplete data it cannot be known for sure how much money some films have made and when they made it, but generally the chart chronicles the films from each year that went on to earn the most. In the cases where estimates conflict both films are recorded, and in cases where a film has moved into first place because of being re-released the previous record-holder is also retained. At least one film every year has generated $100 million in <b>gross</b> <b>revenue</b> at the box office since 1967, and from 2008 each year has succeeded in producing a billion dollar grossing film.|$|E
