A supply chain is a system of organizations, people, activities, information, and resources involved in moving a product or service from supplier to customer.

Supply chains link value chains. Supply and demand can be very fickle, depending on factors such as the weather, consumer demand, and large orders placed by multinational corporations.|$|E

The Popes based their fame on a heavy, proud type of vehicle, which the increasing luxury and triviality of the age tended to replace by lighter forms of carriage, carriages with diminutive and apologetic names.

40|$|The main {{objectives}} {{of this study}} are to find out which brand attributes have most value to <b>end</b> <b>customers</b> when they purchase high-technology products in business market, and are there differences in brand attribute preferences between different company sizes and lines of business. A case company operating in high-technology industry is involved in the study, and consequently, end customers’ assessment of the case company’s current brand performance is included in the study. During the past decades, the role of brands has increased also in business markets. In addition, the manufacturers of high-technology products have acknowledged the importance of branding in differentiating their offerings. Furthermore, previous research suggests that instead of organizational buyers making purely rational choices, they can also be influenced by emotional values. Importance of different brand attributes to <b>end</b> <b>customers</b> is studied by distributing a web-based questionnaire to case company’s <b>end</b> <b>customers</b> in Finland. The role of different brand attributes and case company’s brand performance are evaluated by using quantitative methods, and based on seven factors obtained from a factor analysis, three customer clusters are formed. The results of this research support the previous researches. Brand choices in business market are not done based on purely rational, or tangible, attributes but intangible attributes are important as well. This research found that technical product support and product features are essential to <b>end</b> <b>customers,</b> and furthermore, machine price is less important than the operating cost of the machine.
