25|$|One {{interesting}} {{exception was}} a horizontal seven inch turntable. Although made in 1886, {{the machine was}} a duplicate of one made earlier but taken to Europe by Chichester Bell. Tainter was <b>granted</b> <b>Patent</b> No. 385886 for it on July 10, 1888. The playing arm is rigid except for a pivoted vertical motion of 90 degrees to allow removal of the record or a return to starting position. While recording or playing, the record not only rotated but moved laterally under the stylus which thus described a spiral, recording 150 grooves to the inch.|$|E
25|$|The {{procedure}} for granting patents, requirements {{placed on the}} patentee, {{and the extent of}} the exclusive rights vary widely between countries according to national laws and international agreements. Typically, however, a <b>granted</b> <b>patent</b> application must include one or more claims that define the invention. A patent may include many claims, each of which defines a specific property right. These claims must meet relevant patentability requirements, such as novelty, usefulness, and non-obviousness. The exclusive right granted to a patentee in most countries is the right to prevent others, or at least to try to prevent others, from commercially making, using, selling, importing, or distributing a patented invention without permission.|$|E
25|$|Patent {{infringement}} typically {{is caused}} by using or selling a patented invention without permission from the patent holder. The scope of the patented invention or the extent of protection is defined in {{the claims of the}} <b>granted</b> <b>patent.</b> There is safe harbor in many jurisdictions to use a patented invention for research. This safe harbor does not exist in the US unless the research is done for purely philosophical purposes, or in order to gather data in order to prepare an application for regulatory approval of a drug. In general, patent infringement cases are handled under civil law (e.g., in the United States) but several jurisdictions incorporate infringement in criminal law also (for example, Argentina, China, France, Japan, Russia, South Korea).|$|E

25|$|As {{municipalities}} {{expanded their}} {{water supply and}} sewerage networks, there was a growing need for pipes, but a diminishing need for reservoir tanks. Monier was obliged to go further from urban areas in search of clients. In 1886, he was <b>granted</b> <b>Patent</b> 175513 for a system applicable to housing. The technique is recorded in photographs of a demonstration house which is shown under construction; completed; and in course of demolition. Monier described the house as proof against earthquakes, ice, humidity, heat, and fire and received a commission to build such a house in Nice, possibly {{as a result of a}} recent earthquake. Monier's second son Paul asked to work on this project. On 24 November 1887, Paul was killed when he fell from the scaffolding. As Monier's eldest son, Pierre, had severed his relationship with his father over a family argument, Joseph found himself with no sons of working age to help him in the business.|$|E

Ithaca bought the patent in 1907 and upgraded the design to allow for mass production. With the Flues designed Ithaca double, which became the best selling American double of all time with more than 223,000 produced between 1908 and 1926, Ithaca effectively drove Remington out of the double gun market.|$|E

40|$|This study aims to {{investigate}} the relation between GDP of countries and patent applications issued by the United States Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO), the World Intellectual property Organisation (WIPO), and European Patent Office (EPO) through 2002 - 2005.

40|$|This paper investigates whether patent subsidy {{programs}} aimed at promoting regional innovations have aroused {{a large number of}} low-quality applications in China and created biased patent statistics as an indicator for innovations. We found that patent filing fee subsidies encouraged filing of low-quality patent, resulting in a decreased grant rate. Though reward conditioned on <b>grants</b> increased <b>patent</b> <b>grant</b> rate, it also brought patents with narrow claim breadth. Our empirical results confirmed a general concern that patent subsidies have side effects in encouraging patent applications of low quality or low value. However, the patent subsidy programs does not affect the trend of <b>granted</b> <b>patents,</b> particularly for those applied by firms. Therefore, while the surge of patent applications has upward biases as an innovation indicator, increases in <b>granted</b> <b>patents</b> can be explained by uprising of technological capability at enterprise sector in China. ...|$|R
