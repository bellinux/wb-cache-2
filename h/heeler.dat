He was the capo elettore (ward <b>heeler)</b> of Domenico De Michele Ferrantelli, the mayor of Burgio and member of Parliament for the district of Bivona, as well as on good terms with the Baron Inglese. He exercised influence over several Mafia cosche (clans) in the towns of Bisacquino, Burgio, Campofiorito, Chiusa Sclafani, Contessa Entellina, Corleone, and Villafranca Sicula, as well as some districts in the city of Palermo.|$|E
500|$|The Texas <b>Heeler</b> is a {{cross between}} the Australian Cattle Dog and the Australian Shepherd that was first {{registered}} with the Animal Research Foundation (ARF) in 1970. The ARF has registered Australian Cattle Dogs without papers as [...] "Australian Cattledog Queensland Heelers" [...] since 1965 {{and was the first}} organisation to recognise the Australian Shepherd. Although originally bred for its ability to work cattle, the Texas <b>Heeler</b> is increasingly used as a pet and a companion in dog sports. As with most cross breeds, the Texas Heeler's size and appearance is a variable combination of the parent breeds.|$|E
500|$|Through the 1890s, Cattle Dogs of Halls <b>Heeler</b> derivations {{were seen}} in the kennels of exhibiting Queensland dog breeders such as William Byrne of Booval, and these were a {{different}} population from those shown in New South Wales. Little Logic was bred in Rockdale, New South Wales, however Sydney exhibitors saw Little Logic {{for the first time}} after the dog had been added to the Hillview kennels of Arch Bevis in Brisbane. The show records of Little Logic and his offspring created a demand in New South Wales for Queensland dogs. By the end of the 1950s, there were few Australian Cattle Dogs whelped that were not descendants of Little Logic and his best known son, Logic Return. The success and popularity of these dogs led to the growth of the nickname [...] "Queensland Heeler".|$|E

2500|$|The Koolie (also {{known as}} the Australian Koolie or by the misnomer German Coolie) is an Australian dog breed. The Koolie is a working or herding dog which has existed in Australia since the early 19th century when it was bred from {{imported}} British working dogs. Robert Kaleski, in an article on Cattle Dogs in the August 1903 issue of the Agricultural Gazette of New South Wales, describes the [...] "Welsh <b>heeler</b> or merle, erroneously {{known as the}} German collie," [...] as a [...] "blue-gray dog about the size and build of a smooth-haired collie, generally with wall eyes." [...] The British background predominated in the dogs {{that came to be}} associated with the [...] "German collie" [...] name.|$|E
2500|$|Blue Heelers creator/producer, Hal McElroy, {{conceived}} {{the idea of}} Blue Heelers when he heard that an eighteen-year-old friend was planning to become a police officer. Intrigued, he inquired as to why this young boy, fresh out of school, would {{want to become a}} police officer, as opposed to the many other opportunities he had open to him. McElroy soon discovered that, at the time, a staggering 60% of Australian police officers were under the age of 26. This, coupled with McElroy's desire to create a country cop show, formed the basis of the programme. When this same young officer left the force only a year later due to the shooting death of his colleague, McElroy was even more intrigued to learn about the very fickle, yet rewarding job of policing the community. McElroy continued his quest by asking ex-police officer Michael Winter to write down {{what it was like to}} be a city cop who transferred to a country town. These became the ideas that Blue Heelers was based around. Michael Winter also {{conceived the}} name of the programme by recounting the common names for a country police officer: [...] "tyre-biters"—referring to the fact that country cops are often involved in car chases—and [...] "blue heelers"—referring to their blue uniforms and overall similar appearance and persona to a Blue <b>Heeler</b> dog, a protective and intuitive breed of Australian dog. From the time that McElroy's idea was initially conceived, to the time the programme was ready to air, three years passed.|$|E

500|$|This season also {{marked the}} time when Blue <b>Heelers</b> matched the record for [...] "most episodes {{produced}} in an Australian weekly primetime drama", equalling Homicide's record, which was set in 1977. Blue <b>Heelers</b> did not, however match the [...] "total airtime on television" [...] record. This record was also set by Homicide in 1977. This record stands at 516 hours whilst Blue <b>Heelers</b> is just shy of the record at 511 hours.|$|R

6000|$|I {{was always}} regretting that I got {{at the people}} so little, and that only chance hints {{of what they were}} {{thinking}} and feeling reached me. Now and then, a native observer said something about them which seemed luminous. [...] "We are frightfully feudal," [...] such an observer said, [...] "especially the poor." [...] He did not think it a fault, I believe, and only used his adverb intensifyingly, for he was of a Tory mind. He meant the poor among the country people, who have at last mastered that principle of the feudal system which early enabled the great nobles to pay nothing for the benefits they enjoyed from it. But my other friend, the plumber, was not the least feudal, or not so feudal as many a lowly ward- <b>heeler</b> in New York, who helps to make up the muster of some captain of politics, under the lead of a common boss. The texture of society, in the smarter sense, the narrower sense, is what I could not venture to speak of more confidently. Once I asked a friend, a very dear and valued friend, whether a man's origin or occupation would make any difference in his social acceptance, if he were otherwise interesting and important. He seemed not to know what I would be at, and, when he understood, he responded with almost a shout of amazement, [...] "Oh, not the least in the world!" [...] But I have my doubts still; and I should say that it might be as difficult for a very cultivated and agreeable man servant to get on in London society, as for an artist or poet to feel at home in the first circles of New York. Possibly, however, London society, because of its almost immeasurable vastness, can take in more of more sorts of people, without the consciousness of differences which keeps our own first circles so elect. I venture, somewhat wildly, somewhat unwarrantably, the belief that English society is less sensitive to moral differences than ours, and that people with their little taches would find less anxiety in London than in New York lest they should come off on the people they rubbed against. Some Americans, who, even with our increasing prevalence of divorces, are not well seen at home, are cheerfully welcomed in England.|$|E
