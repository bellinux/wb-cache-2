500|$|The title Wildlife is not {{derived from}} lyrics from the album, but from themes that connect the songs. Dreyer regards {{wildlife}} as [...] "an all-encompassing word to sum everything up", {{and he has}} said that [...] "we all witness tragedy and change. It's the summation of our existence." [...] On the inside of the album cover the words [...] "To – for everything" [...] are written as a dedication with a word being crossed out. It has been speculated by some that the word is the name 'Helen'. Drummer Brad Vander Lugt when asked about the dedication replied [...] "That’s Jordan’s story to tell, and not mine. [...] It does have significance to a story he is telling. You will probably <b>hear</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> bit more about that in future work, Jordan has been known to continue stories or themes onto future albums." ...|$|E
2500|$|In January 2015 Clarkson shared {{excerpts}} of lyrics of nine {{songs from the}} album on her website. From February 23, 2015 to February 27, 2015, RCA released [...] "Invincible", [...] "Piece by Piece", [...] "Run Run Run", [...] "Take You High", and [...] "Someone" [...] as promotional singles. Clarkson commented on the campaign: [...] "I can't remember {{who came up with}} it, but it's the most genius idea. The album as a whole, it's such a singles world, it's nice to have some way of building anticipation around the full album. It's just nice that they're getting to <b>hear</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> bit of the whole record, and then they can make an assessment of the album not based on just one single." [...] From February 26, 2015 to March 2, 2015, RCA, The Hershey Company, and Viacom Media Networks launched a campaign to premiere the tracks [...] "Let Your Tears Fall", [...] "Tightrope", [...] "War Paint", [...] "Dance with Me", and [...] "Good Goes the Bye" [...] on Viacom's music channels MTV, VH1, and CMT.|$|E
2500|$|Tinderbox {{would be}} later hailed by Jean-Benoît Dunckel of Air. He {{selected}} Tinderbox for his [...] "5 albums forever" [...] list, saying, [...] "They played so well together; I saw them in concert and I never forgot that moment". Billy Howerdel of A Perfect Circle rated {{it as his}} all-time favourite album [...] Howerdel described it as [...] "one of the spookiest records I've ever heard. Some of the songs on there have such a dense atmosphere. Sometimes when I'm stuck, I'll listen to that. It's like sometimes when you have no inspiration and {{you go out and}} look at the moon, that's kind of what that record is for me". Jenny Lee Lindberg [...] of Warpaint cited the band among her influences, as well as the song [...] "Umbrella", initially included in the track listing of the 1986 CD version. She said: [...] "This is a song that my husband and I bonded over – we’d definitely heard it individually before, but one day we were just playing the album and that song stopped us in our tracks… played it on repeat for the whole night. I understand why some people can <b>hear</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> Siouxsie in what we do." ...|$|E
6000|$|... [Footnote 31: Until the {{revolution}} of 1830, the writer never met but one noisy woman in Paris. Since that period, however, one <b>hears</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> {{more of the}} tintamarre of the comptoir.] ...|$|R
50|$|During {{the fateful}} {{night when he}} prepares to {{implement}} his plan, he <b>hears</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> child's cries. His humanity overtakes his thirst for revenge. He takes the child, a girl named Papa, under his wings. Papa {{is the daughter of}} Manohar (Jaggaiah) and Santa (Jamuna). The child's mother dies after giving birth to her. Manohar, the father, remarries.|$|R
6000|$|... "Oh, you greedy child!" [...] cries Theo. But here, <b>hearing</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> exclamatory noise outside, {{she ran out}} of the room, {{closing the}} door behind her. And we will not pursue her. The noise was that sob which broke from Hester's panting, {{overloaded}} heart; and, though we cannot see, I am sure the little maid flung herself on her sister's neck, and wept upon Theo's kind bosom.|$|R
60|$|HON. Well then, pray let us <b>hear</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> of him, and how {{he managed}} himself under your conduct.|$|E
6000|$|... "No," [...] Pinney readily acquiesced, [...] "and I presume you'd {{be glad to}} <b>hear</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> English, {{after all}} the French you have around." ...|$|E
60|$|Ant. Did {{one ever}} <b>hear</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> moppet argue so perversely against so good a cause! Come, pr'ythee, let me {{anticipate}} {{a little of}} my revenue.|$|E
6000|$|At {{the same}} moment, Mrs. Sowler reiterated her request in more {{peremptory}} language. [...] "Do you hear, Jervy--do you <b>hear?</b> Sit <b>a</b> <b>little</b> closer." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Ah, there now! That's the style! That's what I like to <b>hear</b> from <b>a</b> <b>little</b> lady in bed because she's cut her knee. That's the style--' ...|$|R

6000|$|... "Julia, my dear," [...] said he, [...] "Mr. Mountjoy {{would like}} to <b>hear</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> music from your harp; let us hear, too, the sound of your voice." ...|$|E
60|$|And now, my friends, {{with these}} few remarks, and again {{returning}} my thanks for this compliment, and expressing {{my desire to}} <b>hear</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> more of your good music, I bid you good-night.|$|E
6000|$|... "Do let us <b>hear</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> more of him!" [...] said Edward; [...] "not that I {{admire him}} so much as many other characters; but he {{interests}} me, {{because he was a}} Yankee boy." ...|$|E
60|$|As for Bishop Helmsdale himself, his {{instincts}} {{seemed to be}} to allude in a debonair spirit to the incidents of the past day--to the flowers in Lady Constantine's beds, the date of her house--perhaps with <b>a</b> view of <b>hearing</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> more about their owner from Louis, who would very readily have followed the Bishop's lead had the parson allowed him room. But this Mr. Torkingham seldom did, and about half-past nine they prepared to separate.|$|R
60|$|Discipline did {{not permit}} even <b>a</b> darling like <b>little</b> Phil to speak at dinner-time; but he fidgeted, and the tears came into his eyes, and Anne <b>hearing</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> grunt behind Sir Philip's chair, looked up, and was aware that old Ralph was mumbling what to her ears sounded like: 'Knew too well.' But his master, being {{slightly}} deaf, did not hear, {{and went on to}} talk of his lambs and of how Sedley had joined them on the road, but had not come back to dinner.|$|R
60|$|By {{this time}} all my {{nervousness}} was gone. I felt {{a kind of}} pleasant excitement as if I were at a dance or a frolic of some sort. The lights were all out in the coaches, and, as Tom and Ike gradually quit firing and yelling, {{it got to be}} almost as still as a graveyard. I remember <b>hearing</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> bird chirping in a bush {{at the side of the}} track, as if it were complaining at being waked up.|$|R
6000|$|... "Well, well, boy, cussin' won't do any good. Now {{lay still}} an' let me work. You've {{had lots of}} good news this mornin'. So I think you can stand to <b>hear</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> bad news." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Tom? Well, look here, Tom! D--n it all! Can't you {{see that}} when a man is stuck here alone, as I am, {{he wants to know}} what's going on outside, and <b>hear</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> fresh talk?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "And pray {{what came}} {{of her at}} last?" [...] said I, for I was willing to <b>hear</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> (seeing she would talk of it) {{what she had to}} say, as well of Amy as of myself.|$|E
5000|$|The film {{comes to}} the present time where elderly Ravi is at the factory. He <b>hears</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> girl and her {{grandmother}} in the courtyard. He starts talking to them and finds out that the grandmother is Masha, who is still waiting for Ravi to come; because this was {{the place where they}} first met. Ravi is astounded, but in the end he decides to walk away. The little girl asks her grandmother who he was, to which she replies, [...] "It was Ravi".|$|R
6000|$|But she {{was very}} much {{surprised}} to <b>hear</b> <b>an</b> odd <b>little</b> voice cry out: [...] "Oh! I am half killed!" [...] and could not tell where it came from, because cabbages do not generally speak.|$|R
60|$|The only {{reply that}} he could <b>hear</b> for <b>a</b> <b>little</b> while was the smack of the horse's hoofs on the {{moistening}} road, and the cluck of the milk in the cans behind them.|$|R
6000|$|... "Evidently {{you suppose}} {{me to have}} meant more than I really did. However, that does not matter. You are still an enigma to me. Had we not better try to <b>hear</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> of Madame Szczymplica's performance?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{sometimes}} think I <b>hear</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> bird," [...] said Gerard, [...] "who sings {{that the long}} frost may yet break up. I have a friend, him of whom I was speaking to you the other day, who has his remedies." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "'Well, it ain't anyways in the {{neighbourhood}} of a {{third of}} what you are worth,' I told her. 'And I don't think Uncle Cal is too sick to <b>hear</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> agitation of the piano-keys just to christen the machine.|$|E
6000|$|... "Certainly. That {{was only}} business. I quoted him special terms and all for your sake, gentlemen. I was {{thinking}} of my regular customers. There's nothing {{to do in the}} evenings in this town. I think, gentlemen, you were all pleased at the opportunity of <b>hearing</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> good music; and where's the harm of offering a grenadine, or what not, to a lady artist? But that fellow--that Swede--he got round the girl. He got round all the people out here. I've been watching him for years. You remember how he got round Morrison." ...|$|R
5000|$|They {{leave the}} train and begin walking out of town, once again <b>hearing</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> girl's laughter. <b>A</b> shadow falls over them, and they flee, only to be scooped up by {{the hand of a}} {{gigantic}} child. The little girl's mother says, [...] "Be careful with your pets, dear--your father brought them all the way from Earth." [...] At her mother's bidding, the little girl drops the couple back into the town, which is now revealed to be a model village with a miniature railway running around it.|$|R
60|$|Still, {{in the end}} the bow did {{not come}} amiss, for one evening, <b>hearing</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> noise in <b>a</b> big tree under which I was about to pass that {{reminded}} me of the purring of a cat, I looked up and saw a great beast of the tiger sort lying on the bough of the tree and watching me. Then I drew the bow and sent an arrow through that beast, piercing it from side to side, and down it came roaring and writhing, and biting at the arrow till it died.|$|R
6000|$|... "Well," [...] she said, [...] "I have {{discovered}} {{at any rate}} one subject on which you can be fluent. Now I have had enough of building properties, please, and house building. I should like to <b>hear</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> about Beatrice." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Would you like," [...] {{interrupted}} the inflexible guide, [...] "to {{have them all}} roused up at this early hour to <b>hear</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> farewell speech from you, explaining the absolute necessity for your going away, and your extreme regret at leaving them?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "It is the same, doubtless. Many {{consider}} him wild, {{because he is}} original, and dares act for himself. As it is well known, I may {{tell you the truth}} of the duel and the betrothal, if you care to <b>hear</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> romance." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Lillian, Lillian, I've such {{news for}} you! Come and <b>hear</b> <b>a</b> charming <b>little</b> romance, {{and prepare to}} see the hero of it!" [...] cried Maud Churchill, rushing into her friend's pretty boudoir {{one day in the}} height of the season.|$|R
6000|$|... "Bessie, {{you must}} make a note of that," [...] said Mrs. Westgate. [...] "My sister," [...] she added, [...] "is a model traveler. She writes down all the curious facts she <b>hears</b> in <b>a</b> <b>little</b> book she keeps for the purpose." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Have you so, by God!" [...] he roared, stung {{suddenly}} to anger. [...] "You shall <b>hear</b> yet <b>a</b> <b>little</b> more. The truth will prevail, {{you have said}} yourself; and prevail the truth shall since this sweet lady so desires it." ...|$|R
