Understanding and controlling the solid-state chemistry of APIs is therefore an important aspect of the drug development process. APIs can exist in a variety of distinct solid forms, including polymorphs, solvates, hydrates, co-crystals and amorphous solids. Each form displays unique physicochemical properties that can profoundly influence the bioavailability, manufacturability, stability and other performance characteristics of the drug. Most APIs are purified and isolated by crystallisation from an appropriate solvent during the final step in synthetic process. The main objective of a crystallisation process is to produce crystals with desired properties such as particle size distribution (PSD), shape and purity. All pharmaceutical dosage forms must be produced in uniform units, and good content of uniformity is only possible when the size of the active component is carefully controlled.

40|$|The {{process of}} {{preferential}} crystallization {{is controlled by}} crystallization kinetics. Thus a key to run the process satisfactorily is using a process monitoring system eventually combined with a process model. In this context information of the liquid phase composition {{as well as the}} time resolved particle size distributions are usually desired. In contrast to measuring the liquid phase composition the inline measurement of particle size distributions is often difficult. The <b>Focused</b> <b>Beam</b> <b>Reflectance</b> <b>Measurement</b> probe (Lasentec, Mettler-Toledo GmbH) is an inline monitoring tool that is capable of measuring so-called chord-length distributions (CLDs). However these CLDs are different to the desired particle size distributions (PSDs). In the presented study this problem is overcome using a recent rigorous mathematical model of the measurement technology to transform PSDs into CLDs. The study shows how the probe model can be adopted to the investigated system using a series of initial validation experiments. Chord-splitting seems to occur when using the <b>Focused</b> <b>Beam</b> <b>Reflectance</b> <b>Measurement</b> probe. A simple modification of the particle geometry is incorporated into the probe model in order to simulate the chord-splitting. The simulated CLDs are then compared to the measured CLDs of different preferential crystallization runs performed for the system d,l-threonine/water. More specifically, measured moments of the chord length distributions along with optical rotation trajectories are compared to calculated moments of a population balance model in order to estimate the kinetic model parameters.

40|$|Application of {{ultrasound}} during crystallization can efficiently inhibit agglomeration. However, {{the mechanism}} is unclear and sonication is usually enabled {{throughout the entire}} process, which increases the energy demand. Additionally, improper operation results in significant crystal damage. Therefore, the present work addresses these issues by identifying the stage in which sonication impacts agglomeration without eroding the crystals. This study was performed using a commercially available API that showed a high tendency to agglomerate during seeded crystallization.

The use of ultrasound as a post-treatment can break some of the agglomerates, but resulted in fractured crystals.

Laboratory scale batch aqueous crystallization system containing in situ monitoring probes for particle vision measurement (PVM), UV–vis <b>measurement</b> and <b>focused</b> <b>beam</b> <b>reflectance</b> <b>measurements</b> (FBRM) was adapted using pre-defined formulation and process parameters. Pure ibuprofen showed nucleation domain between 25 and 64  °C, producing minicrystals with onset of melting at 76  °C and enthalpy of fusion (ΔH) of 26. 22  kJ/mol. On the other hand Ibu-Ddex crystanules showed heterogeneous nucleation which produced spherical core-shell structure. PVM images suggest that internalization of ibuprofen in Ddex corona occurred during the melting phase (before nucleation) which inhibited crystal growth inside the Ddex corona. The remarkable decrease in ΔH of the crystanules from 26. 22 to 11. 96  kJ/mol and the presence of broad overlapping DSC thermogram suggests formation of ibuprofen-Ddex complex and crystalline-amorphous transformation. However Raman and FTIR spectra did not show any significant chemical interaction between ibuprofen and Ddex. A significant increase in dissolution efficiency from 45 to 81 % within 24  h and reduced burst release provide evidence for potential application of crystanules in controlled drug delivery systems.

Furthermore, the solvation of these components in the system consisting of the ionic liquid (IL) 1 -ethyl- 3 -methylimidazolium acetate (EMIMAc) in a novel combination with the co-solvent 1 -methylimidazole (MIM) is investigated. <b>Focused</b> <b>beam</b> <b>reflectance</b> <b>measurement</b> (FBRM) particle characterization in combination with microscopic analysis and molecular weight determinations (xylan) shows that cellulose and xylan can be most efficiently solvated using only 3 to 4 % IL (n/n anhydro-glucose units and n/n anhydro-xylose units) and 9 % IL, respectively, while still avoiding any significant polymer degradation. A model for a two-step process of cellulose solvation in the present system is proposed...|$|E

The focus of these experiments was to analyze the accuracy of chord length distribution (CLD) measured by <b>focus</b> <b>beam</b> <b>reflectance</b> <b>measurement</b> (FBRM technology) {{in comparison with the}} droplet size distribution (DSD) measured by a particle video microscope (PVM technology). A beaker ? batch test and a flow loop test were employed for a variety of oils spanning over an order of magnitudes in viscosity. The PVM was found to be a useful and accurate measurement device for determining the real droplet sizes and as a calibration method for the FBRM. In the beaker test, The Sauter mean diameter d 32 was found to be proportional to the maximum (99 th percentile) droplet size for both oil-water emulsions and water-oil emulsions. Since the CLD values were underestimating the size in comparison with DSD values, an empirical correlation was developed based on a log-normal distribution to improve the predictive power of the CLD. The dynamic properties of both FBRM and PVM probes were evaluated in beaker tests and flow loop tests. The beaker tests were found to be a reliable and reasonable alternative to flow loop tests. The simplicity of both testing and data collection, combined with the reduced effect of distance between the probes, allow the beaker tests to provide a good estimate of the uncertainty of the FBRM measurement for the water-oil flow in the pipe. </p...|$|R
40|$|Ionic liquids are of {{potential}} {{interest in the}} processing of lignocellulosic biomass, and/or its components, {{for the purpose of}} producing renewable and value-added biomaterials. An understanding of how solvation can be achieved {{and the way in which}} the feedstock biopolymers are affected, however, needs to be gained prior to a viable implementation. In this thesis, the solvation of the wood biopolymers cellulose, xylan and lignin in the ionic liquid (IL) 1 -ethyl- 3 -methylimidazolium acetate (EMIMAc) in a novel combination with the second system component 1 -methylimidazole (MIM) have been investigated: The solvation of dissolving pulp, beech xylan and LignoBoost lignin model materials, was studied using FBRM (<b>focused</b> <b>beam</b> <b>reflectance</b> <b>measurements)</b> particle characterization in combination with microscopic analysis (cellulose and xylan), determination of molecular weights (xylan and lignin) and 13 C- and 31 P-NMR (nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy) of lignin. It was concluded that the most efficient solvation of cellulose and xylan occurred using 3 - 4 % and 9 % IL (n/n anhydroglucose units and n/n anhydroxylose Units), respectively, while polymer integrity was maintained. Cellulose solvation was found to be greatly dependent on the IL to AGU ratio whereas xylan solvation varied greatly with temperature. Moreover, a theoretical model was developed for the solvation of cellulose in the present system. The solvation of lignin was achieved at ~ 20 % lignin loading (w/w), in any combination of MIM/EMIMAc. Regeneration of lignin resulted in two sets of fractions; one exhibiting a general and higher apparent molecular weight (Mw) along with an enrichment of condensed/aliphatic ether linkages and aliphatic hydroxyls, and the other exhibiting a lower apparent Mw and an enrichment of carboxylic and phenolic groups. The knowledge of biopolymer solvation gained in the present solvent system provides future opportunities of tuning extraction and/or fractionation processes to suite the specifications of a particular biomass-derived product...|$|R
40|$|International audienceHydrate {{formation}} and remediation in oil flowlines facilities represent {{a major concern}} for oil industry in respect of capital and operational costs. It is necessary {{to have a better}} understanding on the hydrate formation process to be more efficient in hydrate prevention, especially in respect to additive dosage. This work is a contribution to enhance the knowledge of hydrate formation at high water cuts, by introducing new techniques of analysis in the Archimede flow loop: a <b>Focus</b> <b>Beam</b> <b>Reflectance</b> <b>Measurement</b> (FBRM) probe and a Particle Video Microscope (PVM) probe. These results will be supported by Pressure Drop, Flow Rate, Density and Temperature probes. From experimental observations, a method to determine the continuous phase (water or oil) of the system under flowing is proposed. It is based on the time evolution of the most representative chord class measured by the FBRM. In order to predict morphology and size of hydrates, a topological model was developed. It represents hydrate crystallization from different emulsion systems with and without low dosage of hydrate inhibitor additive (anti-agglomerant type). The key parameters are the gas transfer rate at the gas/liquid interface and at the hydrocarbon/water interface, {{and the role of the}} hydrocarbon as gas transfer phase. Gas/liquid transfer is low as water phase remains the continuous phase, but is enhanced as hydrocarbon content is increased. Hydrocarbon gas transfer property is depleted as continuous and rigid crust is formed around droplets, especially in well dispersed emulsions. This behavior is highlighted for experiments without anti-agglomerant additive (AA-LDHI) and at high water cut, as a small fraction of hydrocarbon is well dispersed in the water continuous phase. The maximum hydrate plugging risk is in between 70 % and 30 % water cut (intermediate and low water cut). In this work, experiments at high water cuts (more than 80 %) never plug. In order to prevent agglomeration, the AA-LDHI works better if it shows a secondary surfactant benefit, well-dispersing the droplets (and later the formed hydrates) in the continuous phase, which was identified as being preferentially the hydrocarbon phase...|$|R
