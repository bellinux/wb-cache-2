5|$|The greater {{adjutant}} breeds {{during winter}} in colonies that may include other large waterbirds {{such as the}} spot-billed pelican. The nest is a large platform of twigs placed {{at the end of}} a near-horizontal branch of a tall tree. Nests are rarely placed in forks and an unobstructed top canopy allows the birds to fly easily from and to the nests. In the Nagaon nesting colony in Assam, tall Alstonia scholaris and Anthocephalus cadamba were favourite nest trees. The beginning of the breeding season is marked by several birds congregating and trying to occupy a tree. While crowding at these sites, male birds mark out their nesting territories, chasing away others and frequently pointing their bill upwards while clattering them. They may also arch their body and hold their wings half open and drooped. When a female perches nearby, the male plucks fresh twigs and places it before her. The male may also grasp the tarsus of the female with the bill or hold his bill close to her in a preening gesture. A female that has paired holds the bill and head to the breast of the male and the male locks her by holding his bill over her neck. Other displays include simultaneous bill raising and lowering by a pair. The clutch, usually of three or four white eggs, is laid at intervals of one or two days and incubation begins after the first egg is laid. Both parents incubate and the eggs hatch at intervals of one or two days, each taking about 35 days from the <b>date</b> <b>of</b> <b>laying.</b> Adults at the nest have their legs covered with their droppings and this behaviour termed as urohidrosis is believed to aid in cooling during hot weather. Adults may also spread out their wings and shade the chicks. The chicks are fed at the nest for about five months. The chicks double in size in a week and can stand and walk on the nest platform when they are a month old. At five weeks, the juveniles leap frequently and can defend themselves. The parent birds leave the young along for longer periods at nest at this stage. The young birds leave the nest and fly around the colony when about four months but continue to be fed occasionally by the parents.|$|E
40|$|Data on {{aspects of}} the {{breeding}} biology of a colony of Kittiwakes in North East England, in which all breeding adults are individually colour-marked, have been collected annually since 1954. The inter-relationships between different factors have been investigated and year-to-year changes in the breeding biology of the colony, related to changes in population structure. Date of return to the colony is shown to be primarily determined by age. Synchrony of return between {{the members of a}} breeding pair is associated with the maintenance of the pair bond. Other factors influencing the duration of the pair bond are investigated, including the prior association between the members of the pair, breeding success in the previous year and mortality rates in different years. As birds get older, the main cause of the break-up of the pair bond changes from 'divorce' to bereavement. Time of breeding is related to the location of the nest site (centre or edge of the colony) and the breeding experience of the two members of the pair. There is a tendency for breeding to become more synchronised amongst older age groups, with females laying progressively closer to the mean <b>date</b> <b>of</b> <b>laying</b> for the colony as a whole. The possible interactions between environmental cues, stimulus from the mate and stimulus {{from the rest of the}} colony are discussed. Clutch size is shown to be independently influenced by breeding experience, <b>date</b> <b>of</b> <b>laying,</b> location of the nest site and the status of the pair (retention of the same mate as in the previous year, or change). Variations in the size and shape of eggs laid by different females are investigated with respect to many of the above factors...|$|E
40|$|Experiments on {{free-living}} and captive Kestrels {{were set}} up to investigate the effect of food and condition on laying date and clutch size, and {{to distinguish between the}} income and capital models. Kestrels showed the same seasonal decrease in clutch size in different areas (Flevoland and Lauwersmeer) and in different years (early and late). Juveniles and adults had the same distribution of laying dates and laid the same number of eggs in any particular date interval. The seasonal decline in clutch size found between individuals was also found within individuals, breeding in different years. Feeding experiments in the field, early and late in the breeding season, advanced the mean <b>date</b> <b>of</b> <b>laying</b> by 10 and 6 days respectively, compared with controls. However, the advance depended on the actual food situation: in low vole years experimental birds laid three weeks earlier than controls, in high vole years experimental and control birds had no significant difference in laying date. The advance in laying date was associated with a change in the number of eggs, and clutch size did not deviate from the expected size for the date. Food experiments in the laboratory supported these findings: food supply had a direct effect on the <b>date</b> <b>of</b> <b>laying</b> but not on the number of eggs. Body mass of laying females with surplus food was higher than in their controls (specially of late breeders) and did not vary with date over two months, still late surplus fed breeders laid smaller clutches. The data do support neither the income model (rate of energy supply during laying determines clutch size) nor the capital model (condition of the laying female determines clutch size). We propose that food availability determines the laying date and the number of eggs is determined by date itself. Whether body mass as an indicator of condition is causally involved in determining laying date or is merely correlated with food supply can not presently be established. ...|$|E

40|$|The {{number of}} eggs birds lay (clutch size) varies between species. Such {{variations}} have been considered, since Lack (1954), as evolutionary adaptions {{to maximize the}} number of offspring. Clutch size also varies within species (Klomp 1970), depending on age of the female, latitude, time of year, temperature, feeding conditions, etcetera. In many singlebrooded species there is a decline in clutch size with progressive time of laying (laying date). Such variations in laying date and clutch size ask for an evolutionary or functional and for a physiological explanation, in other words: which ultimate factors in de environment make reproductive patterns adaptive {{and what are the}} proximate factors triggering the reproductive decisions?

40|$|Avian {{breeding}} generally {{coincides with}} seasonal peaks in food supply, but detailed {{studies suggest that}} birds may breed on either the rising or the declining slopes of food availability. Nonetheless, a seasonal decline in clutch size appears general for single-brooded altricial species, except those laying {{only one or two}} eggs. Surplus-feeding experiments suggest that food in spring affects laying date and thereby clutch size in those species {{in which there is a}} decline. Survival indices for offspring, both in the nest and after fledging, generally decline with the progress of season. These effects of date of birth can be summarized in the reproductive value of eggs as a function of <b>date</b> <b>of</b> <b>laying.</b> It is shown that with constraints on parental investment, optimal clutch sizes should decline with season when egg reproductive value declines, independent of assumptions on the nature of the constraining and proximate control mechanisms.

Of 1397 observed copulation attempts, fr 7 % were extra-pair copulations. Ten of the 13 focal pairs showed a seasonally bimodal pattern of daily copulatory rates. On average, the peaks occurred 65 and 5 days before the <b>laying</b> <b>of</b> the first egg. The mean number of copulations per female per clutch was 3262.

Frequent copulations in the lesser kestrel might have several functions: the early peak would be almost certainly outside the females’ fertile period and would be related to pair bonding and sexual stimulation of the pair members. The peak closer to egg layingeould be related to sperm competition since most extra-pair copulation attempts occurred close to the <b>date</b> <b>of</b> <b>lay.</b> Male lesser kestrels followed a mixed reproductive strategy, but the success of the extra-pair copulation attempts depended on the females (the larger sex) and their pairing status.

40|$|Abstract Timing and {{duration}} of the breeding cycle of the Cape petrel Daption capense were studied during two breeding seasons (1990 / 1991 and 1991 / 1992) at Nelson Island, South Shetland Islands, Antarctica. In 1991 / 1992 the copulatory period extended over 53 days, with median date and a peak about 28 and 19 days respectively, before the median <b>date</b> <b>of</b> <b>laying.</b> Laying began 85 days after arrival, with mean (median) date on 2 December (SD 2 : 5 days). The distributions of laying, hatching and fledging dates showed a similar degree of synchrony and did not differ between years. Incubation and chick period were equally long (46 days), the former being less variable (coefficient of variation 2 : 8 % and 4. 6 %, respectively). Mean com-pleted nesting cycle (92 days) was about 2 days shorter at Nelson Island than elsewhere and tended to shorten as the breeding season progressed. Its mean length represented 86 % of the whole nesting period (107 days), which in turn represented 56 % of the period of con-tinuous colony attendance.

40|$|Many animals use {{photoperiod}} cues to synchronize reproduction {{with environmental}} conditions and thereby improve their reproductive success. The circadian clock, which creates endogenous behavioral and physiological rhythms typically entrained to photoperiod, is well characterized {{at the molecular}} level. Recent work provided evidence for an association between Clock poly-Q length polymorphism and latitude and, within a population, an association with the <b>date</b> <b>of</b> <b>laying</b> {{and the length of}} the incubation period. Despite relatively high overall breeding synchrony, the timing of clutch initiation has a large impact on the fitness of swallows in the genus Tachycineta. We compared length polymorphism in the Clock poly-Q region among five populations from five different Tachycineta species that breed across a hemisphere-wide latitudinal gradient (Fig. 1). Clock poly-Q variation was not associated with latitude; however, there was an association between Clock poly-Q allele diversity and the degree of clutch size decline within breeding seasons. We did not find evidence for an association between Clock poly-Q variation and date of clutch initiation in for any of the five Tachycineta species, nor did we found a relationship between incubation duration and Clock genotype. Thus, there is no general association between latitude, breeding phenology, and Clock polymorphism in this clade of closely related birds...|$|E
40|$|A common {{feature of}} many birds {{breeding}} in seasonal environments is that fitness-related parameters such as nestling mass or survival decline as the breeding season progresses. Consequently, {{there is a}} tendency for early breeders to have better reproductive performance than individuals breeding later in the season. This variation could be caused by factors associated with the <b>date</b> <b>of</b> <b>laying,</b> such as changing environmental conditions (date hypothesis), or by differences in parental quality between early and late breeders (parent quality hypothesis). To evaluate the relative importance of both hypotheses, we manipulated hatch dates of Blue Tits Cyanistes caeruleus by exchanging clutches with different incubation stages and assessed the impact on nestling mass, nestling diet and provisioning rates. Mean nestling mass declined significantly over the season. This was the combined result of differences in parental quality, which dominated {{in the early part of}} the season, and the influence of hatching date (date effect per se), which prevailed later in the season. Nestling diet composition was apparently uninfluenced by the manipulation, suggesting that deteriorating food supplies are the primary reason for the seasonal variation in the nestling diet. Counter to the date hypothesis, delayed parents did not feed their young less than control pairs did, but in fact exhibited higher provisioning rates. Our results suggest that in this population, parental quality seems to constrain post-hatching reproductive performance and such intrinsic limitations may help to explain why certain individuals breed later.

It is based on several different nestbox studies; the oldest one starting in 1969. During 1969 to 2012, mean spring temperatures in the study area increased by between 0. 06 and 0. 08 °C per year, depending on the period considered. Great tits Parus major, blue tits Cyanistes caeruleus and marsh tits Poecile palustris, which generally start egg laying between the last week of April and the first week of May, all advanced laying date at a similar rate during the study period (0. 25 d yr– 1).

40|$|International audienceHatching {{asynchrony}} in avian species generally {{leads to}} a size hierarchy among siblings, favouring the first-hatched chicks. Maternally deposited hormones affect the embryo and chick's physiology and behaviour. It has been observed that progesterone, a hormone present at higher levels than other steroid hormones in egg yolks, is negatively related to body mass in embryos, chicks and adults. A differential within-clutch progesterone deposition could therefore {{be linked to the}} size hierarchy between siblings and to the resulting brood reduction. We tested whether yolk progesterone levels differed between eggs according to future parental ability to feed the entire clutch in wild rockhopper penguins Eudyptes chrysocome. This species presents a unique reversed egg-size dimorphism and hatching asynchrony, with the larger secondlaid egg (B-egg) hatching before the smaller first-laid egg (A-egg). Yolk progesterone levels increased only slightly with female body mass at laying. However, intra-clutch ratios were not related to female body mass. On the other hand, yolk progesterone levels increased significantly with the <b>date</b> <b>of</b> <b>laying</b> onset for A-eggs while they decreased for B-eggs. Early clutches therefore had proportionally more progesterone in the B-egg compared to the A-egg while late clutches had proportionally less progesterone in the B-egg.

40|$|ABSTRACT. Most Arctic-breeding passerines raise {{a single}} brood in a season, presumably because the short Arctic summer {{does not provide}} {{sufficient}} time to raise a second brood. Here we document the first cases of two broods being raised or attempted, after successful fledging of a first brood, in an Arctic-breeding population of Northern Wheatears Oenanthe oenanthe, at Iqaluit, Nunavut, Canada, in 2010 and 2011. In one case, the same pair was involved in raising both broods. In a second case, the female that raised the first brood was mated to a different male for her second brood. In a third case, it was not known whether the same male {{was involved in a}} female’s attempt to raise two broods. The three females that attempted to raise two broods started their first clutches four to six days earlier than the estimated median <b>date</b> <b>of</b> <b>laying</b> first eggs and represented about 6 % of all females in the study population. Potential constraints on raising two broods include not only the shortness of the summer season but also the nature and abundance of the food supply, trade-offs between the success of the first brood and that of the second brood, and effects of the one- and two-brood strategies on the survival and future reproductive output of the adults.

40|$|In a {{stimulating}} analysis, Lack (1967, 1968 a) reviewed waterfowl clutch {{size and}} egg size data, {{and concluded that}} interspecific variations in average clutch size are generally inversely related to those of relative egg size. Thus, he suggested that the average clutch size of each waterfowl species has evolved {{in relation to the}} average availability of food to the female around the time of nesting. He hypothesized that in waterfowl, relatively large eggs have probably evolved to provide the newly-hatched young with a large food supply (an idea he subsequently (1968 b) questioned) or with an adequate insulating layer of fat. He also suggested that, since annual, seasonal, and local variations in clutch size exist, proximate factors, such as the food supply of individual females, {{may be more likely to}} influence a bird 2 ̆ 7 s <b>date</b> <b>of</b> <b>laying</b> than either its egg size or clutch size.

Klomp considered the problems posed by the Anatidae in some detail, and generally agreed that the food supplies available to the female are probably the ultimate factor influencing clutch size in this group. Because of the large amount of information available for waterfowl, and since Lack did not concern himself with proximate influences on clutch sizes of individuals, I have given these matters some attention and have reached somewhat different conclusions. No simple single explanation for inter- and intraspecific variations in clutch sizes seems possible at present, but a summary of the evidence relating to these phenomena nevertheless appears worthwhile...|$|E

40|$|In {{seasonal}} environments, {{the main}} selection {{pressure on the}} timing of reproduction (the ultimate factor) is synchrony between o¡spring requirements and food availability.

Since the colony's formation in 1931 the nest count has increased from 308 in 1937 to 5768 in 1992.

40|$|The thermal and hydric {{environment}} during incubation of turtle eggs influences hatchling size, sex, {{energy reserves}} and thus their quality, Information {{on the natural}} nest environment of flatback turtles (Natator depressus) is lacking. Therefore, the current study investigated the thermal and hydric environment of their nest chambers and nesting beach (at Peak Island, east coastal Queensland during the 1996 / 1997 and 1997 / 1998 nesting seasons), The temperature of nest chambers and the nesting beach showed temporal and spatial variation. Beach temperature increased through the nesting season as summer progressed and showed significant vertical and lateral variation. The temperature {{in the core of}} nest chambers increased as incubation progressed (all average 7 C) apparently because of both metabolic heating and the natural seasonal increase in sand temperature. The temperature range of nests was 25. 5 - 36. 5 C, with many nests exposed to temperatures above 35 C for extended periods. Water content of sand surrounding nest chambers at the beginning of incubation ranged from 2. 6 - 7. 8 % (w/w), varying with <b>date</b> <b>of</b> <b>laying</b> and location on the beach. Natator depressus eggs may be more tolerant of high incubation temperatures and severe moisture stress than those of most other sea turtle species.

Neither nest success nor clutch size varied significantly between subsequent clutches of an individual female. Hatchling sex ratio on this beach possibly depends on the date of egg laying. Because high density nesting occurs when beach temperature appears to produce almost all female hatchlings, the hatchling sex ratio at Peak Island is likely to be biased toward females, Data gathered in the current study will assist in the development of management strategies to protect this endemic species...|$|E

I {{investigated}} die effect of mate change (due to divorce or mate death) on reproductive performance. Below average productivity {{in the year of}} divorce and in the preceding year, coupled with a low adult survival rate in the year following divorce, suggested birds which divorced were poorer quality individuals than birds which retained their mate. Productivity was reduced if one or both members of a pair were in their last year of life and was indicative of a decline m fitness. Dispersal, breeding and the importance of nest site tenacity to mate retention were studied when kittiwakes were prevented from returning to their original nest sites in 1991. In 1991, extensive non-breeding (57 %) and low productivity resulted. Of die birds which bred, 54 (83 %) nested in the immediate colony area and only 11 moved to other colonies. Despite moving site, many birds retained their mate of the previous breeding season. In the following year, a further 61 kittiwakes moved and nested at other colonies and about a third retained theu" mate. This, and other evidence, suggests that individual recognition is important in mate retention. Reproductive performance, in relation to nest position in the colony and proxunity to other nesting pairs, was compared with a kittiwake colony at Marsden, NE England.

As a consequence, we expected increases in clutch size with advancement in lay date; however, we detected no such trend over time. The distributions <b>of</b> egg-laying <b>dates</b> were more constricted in the warmest (and earliest) years, suggesting that changes in mean clutch size might be constrained by changes in the distribution <b>of</b> <b>laying</b> <b>dates.</b> If spring temperatures continue to increase, we predict further reductions <b>of</b> variance in <b>laying</b> <b>dates</b> and relatively small increases in clutch size. Such constraints on life-history variation probably are common and need to be considered when modeling the effects of climate change on reproduction in natural populations. Predicting the long-term effects of constraints and interpreting changes in life-history traits require a better understanding of both adaptive and demographic effects of climate change...|$|R
40|$|In {{continuing}} and {{completing the}} significant {{reforms of the}} Ambrosian Church introduced by his cousin Carlo during his bishopry, Federico Borromeo showed much regard for the new religious institutions – the Schools of Brera, the Seminario Maggiore, the Collegio Elvetico, to mention just a few – and even intervened on their buildings. This mod-ern cultural project also encompassed the Ambrosian Library, founded {{to serve as a}} bridge between lay and religious culture and currently housing vast and rich collections of books and manuscripts. The Library is hosted in a building which was certainly devised and planned by Federico Borromeo who, though consulting the most eminent architects and scientists of the time, was personally involved in the definition of the main design choices, adapting them as the building site advanced. Thus, even if the construction of the building – between June 30, 1603, the <b>date</b> <b>of</b> the <b>laying</b> <b>of</b> the foundation stone, and December 8, 1609, the <b>date</b> <b>of</b> the inauguration of the Library – was in charge of Francesco Maria Ricchino, who became the executor of the design plans and of their realization, it was Federico Borromeo who acted as a supervisor, making decisions and finding solutions. This also thanks to Federico’s architectural knowledge and to his interests in the field, developed ever since his studies in Pavia, where he had met and had become acquainted with Pellegrino Pellegrini, the architect of the Collegio Borromeo and of several other works patronised by Carlo Borromeo. Pellegrini’s ideal and cultural legacy was ever to be present in Federico’s architectural choices which, even {{in the case of the}} Ambrosian Library, provide a model of severe and rigorous classicism which adheres to the reformed conception of art...|$|R
40|$|Octopus digueti Perrier and Rochebrune, 1894 was reared {{through its}} life cycle at 25 °C {{in a closed}} {{seawater}} system using artificial sea water. Two field-collected females produced 231 hatchlings: 193 hatchlings were groupcultured while 24 were isolated at hatching and grown individually to allow precise analyses of growth in length and weight over the life cycle. All octopuses were fed primarily live shrimps. Maturing adults fed {{at a rate of}} 4. 7 % of body weight per day and had a gross growth efficiency of 48 %. Growth in weight was exponential for the first 72 days and described best by the equation: WW(g) =. 0405 e• 0646 t. The mean growth rate over this period was 6. 4 % increase in body weight per day (%/d), with no significant difference between male and female growth. From 72 to 143 days, growth was logarithmic and described best by the equation: WW(g) = (6. 78 x 1 O- 6) t 3. 13. Females grew slightly faster than males over this growth phase. During the exponential growth phase, mantle length increased at a mean rate of 2. 1 % per day, declining to 1. 1 % per day over the logarithmic phase. No attempt was made to describe mathematically the period of declining growth rate beyond day 143. The primary causes of early mortality in group culture were escapes and cannibalism. Survival was good despite high culture density: 73 % survival to <b>date</b> <b>of</b> first egg <b>laying</b> (day 111). Survival was better among the isolated growth-study octopuses: 88 % to the <b>date</b> <b>of</b> first egg <b>laying</b> (day 130). Mean life span was 199 days in group-reared octopuses and 221 days in the growth-study octopuses. There {{was no significant difference between}} male and female life span. Progeny of the group culture were reared at similar stocking densities and fed predominantly fresh dead shrimp and crab meat. This diet resulted in cannibalism, with only 6 % survival to first egg laying on day 128. Fecundity in this group was lower. Octopus digueti is a good candidate for laboratory culture and biological experimentation because of its small size, rapid growth, short life span, and good survival in group culture...|$|R
40|$|A {{study of}} the herring gull Larus argentatus emphasising interrelationships of {{population}} ecology, social behaviour and breeding biology was undertaken on the Isle of May, Scotland, with some comparative work in a moorland gull colony on Mallowdale Fell in the Pennines. A cull of the herring gull population, which had hitherto been increasing at 13 % per annum, has been practised by the Nature Conservancy Council on the Isle of May yearly since 1972, and special attention was given in this study to the biological effects of culling. The population trends were followed in detail up to 1977, and it was shown that the annual, recruitment rate has been very variable since 1972 {{and there has been}} a shortfall in the number of young gulls predicted to join the breeding population. These have presumably moved and some ringed gulls were located breeding in other colonies. The population has been held at about 20 - 25 % of its 1972 level since 1975. With many of the older gulls having been culled, the average age of the population had been reduced, so that by 1977 about 50 % of the population was breeding for the first time. Despite a strong correlation between parental age and percentage breeding success, the average number of chicks fledged per pair in control areas was 0. 82, which was as high as that recorded in a previous study by Parsons (1971, unpublished Ph. D. thesis, Durham University) on the Isle of May in the late 1960 s. In addition, it was found that the median <b>date</b> <b>of</b> <b>laying</b> was the same as that estimated by Parsons, and that egg size (positively correlated with chick survival) had increased significantly. Experiments on recruitment by manipulating breeding density showed that at the highest densities recorded the annual recruitment rate was close to the average annual mortality rate. In areas where density had been greatly reduced, the recruitment rate was insufficient to replace annual adult mortality, and in some areas no recruitment was recorded. There was a broad, optimal breeding density of between 2 and 10 nests/l 00 m(^ 2) where highest recruitment rates took place. Much of the Isle of May was found to be at this density as a result of culling. Birds which spread their nests most uniformly were the most successful breeders, and the majority of nests were thus spaced. Aggression was found to increase with density. The rationale of gull culling has been discussed for the Isle of May, together with recommendations for future culls on the island and elsewhere...|$|E
40|$|Traditionally, {{investigation}} {{of the dynamics of}} avian migration has been heavily biased towards the autumn return trip to the wintering quarters. Since the migratory prelude to breeding has direct fitness consequences, the European Science Foundation recently redressed the balance and sponsored a workshop on spring travels. We here survey the findings elucidating the complications arising during migration directed towards the breeding quarters. The evidence that early nesting confers advantage is overwhelming, hence demands of reproduction pose a constraint on both time and energy resources during spring. Both during migration and upon arrival there must therefore be strong selection in favour of saving time. Experimental results (e. g. using supplementary feeding) show that the <b>date</b> <b>of</b> <b>laying</b> is generally proximately constrained by the inability of the female to find sufficient nutrients. A key question thus concerns the implementation of the 'capital' strategy for breeding, the female accumulating nutrient stores along the way to bridge periods of shortage upon arrival on the breeding grounds. Eight studies on waterfowl (geese and eiders) and shorebirds (turnstones and knots) nesting in the arctic combine tracking of individuals (satellite telemetry) with direct observation (marked birds) and reconstruction of the origin of nutrients laid down in the eggs or in the form of body stores of the female parent (stable isotope signatures of tissues compared to potential food sources). The consensus emerges that in most cases a mixed strategy prevails, with nutrients garnered locally supplementing 'imported' body stores. The species concerned face a shortage of feeding time during incubation and suffer an energy deficit. Successful breeding thus depends on adequate fat depots that form part of the 'capital' the parents bring with them. Some headway has been made in predicting the extent of dependence on body stores for breeding in relation to body mass and length of migration from rates of fat deposition during stopover and fat consumption during flight for waterfowl. This work poses a challenge to refine field studies accordingly. The pressure to save time en route highlights the need to effectively exploit rich food resources. Several case studies underline the crucial significance of a very limited set of stopover sites, each with a narrow time window of optimal harvest. The influence of man at such sites often verges on the disastrous, and ongoing climate change may unhinge the finely tuned timing long-distance migrants depend on. There is a real need to extend this work to provide the scientific basis to underpin adequate conservation actions...|$|E
40|$|Under our {{supervision}} were {{on average}} 450 artificial nesting in different years. Studies {{were conducted in}} 2006 – 2014 in the conditions ofoak forestin national natural park “Homilshanski forests” (Kharkiv region) (49 ° 38 ' north latitude, 36 ° 18 ' east longitude), pine forests in National natural park “Hetmansky” (50 ° 22 ' north latitude, 35 ° 01 ' east longitude) and broadleaf forest natural boundary Vakalivschyna (Sumyregion) (51 ° 01 ' north latitude, 34 ° 55 ' east longitude). We investigated 164 layings of great tits and 38 laying of blue tits. Terms of breeding of birds were determined by the <b>date</b> <b>of</b> <b>laying</b> of the first egg. It was found that tits began to lay eggs at steady transition of the average daily temperature over + 4 ºC. Maximum amount of started layings was observed in great tits and blue tits in {{the conditions of the}} national natural park “Homilshanski forests” (average size – 12. 3 ± 1. 50 and 12. 8 ± 1. 75 eggs, respectively) at + 15 ºC, with the size of laying gradually decreasing with higher temperatures. Sizes of full layings in great tits (n = 164) and blue tits (n = 38) inSumyand Kharkiv regions were found. With regard to the great tit, it varies from 5 to 15 eggs being on average 10. 8 ± 1. 93 inthe conditions of NNP “Homilshanski forests”, at natural boundary Vakalivschyna – 9. 3 ± 2. 33 and at NNP “Hetmansky” – 9. 1 ± 2. 28, while for blue tits it is equal to 5 – 15 eggs, i. e. 11. 4 ± 2. 09 on average in the conditions of NNP “Homilshanski forests”, at natural boundary Vakalivschyna – 9. 3 ± 2. 81 and at NNP “Hetmansky” – 10. 5. Size of laying for great tits and blue tits, which prevails for each territory, has been established. The largest sizes for great tits are: 11 -egg laying (10. 9 %) in the conditions of NNP “Homilshanski forests”, 11 -egg laying (12. 7 %) dominating at the natural boundary Vakalivschyna and 9 - and 10 -egg laying (by 3. 0 %) at NNP “Hetmansky”. 12 -egg laying (21. 0 %) was often found in the nests of blue tits in conditions of NNP “Homilshanski forests”, size of laying which would be dominating in blue tits at the natural boudary Vakalivschyna and NNP “Hetmansky” was not found. The largest number of laying by great tits was started at NNP “Homilshanski forests” in the second decade of April (n = 28), at natural boundary Vakalivschyna – in early May (n = 25), while blue tits started laying eggs at NNP “Homilshanski forests” in the third decade of April (n = 17), at natural boundary Vakalivschyna – in the first (n = 2) and second (n = 2) week in May. Overwhelming number of layings were started by great tits and blue tits at NNP “Hetmansky” in the third week of April...|$|E
40|$|We {{explored}} the breeding biology of the Northern Pygmy-Owl (Glaucidium gnoma) from 2007 to 2009 in a forested reserve in Portland, Oregon. Large body size is often assumed to give animals reproductive advantages, and we tested whether body size affected timing of breeding and examined variation in diet, breeding date, clutch size, and reproductive success to explore whether the presumed benefits of large body size {{are evident in}} this species. The average size of 13 clutches was 5. 8, and nest success was high (92 %); 22 successful nests fledged an average of 5. 2 young. <b>Dates</b> <b>of</b> first <b>laying</b> varied over an 18 - or 19 -day period in each year and averaged 3 weeks earlier in 2008 than in 2009. Early breeders laid larger clutches. After the effect of breeding site was controlled for, small rather than large female pygmy-owls bred earliest. The same pattern of small size was evident in all years. Diet varied by year in regard to whether mammals (2008) or birds (2007 and 2009) were the dominant prey taken, and the owls bred earlier in 2008 occurred when mammals dominated their diet. Although small females tended to breed earlier in all years, {{it was only in}} 2009 when pairs bred very late and birds dominated their diet that small females also laid larger clutches and fledged more young. These data suggest that the merits of small or large body size may vary with stages of the breeding cycle and ecological conditions...|$|R
40|$|Most animals {{reproduce}} seasonally. They {{time their}} reproduction {{in response to}} environmental cues, like increasing photoperiod and temperature, which are predictive for the time of high food availability. Although individuals of a population use the same cues, they vary in their onset of reproduction, with some animals reproducing consistently early or late. In avian research, timing of reproduction often refers to the <b>laying</b> <b>date</b> <b>of</b> the first egg, which is a key determinant of fitness. Experiments measuring temporal patterns of reproductive hormone concentrations or gonadal size under controlled conditions {{in response to a}} cue commonly assume that these proxies are indicative of the timing <b>of</b> egg <b>laying.</b> This assumption often remains untested, with few studies reporting both reproductive development and the onset <b>of</b> <b>laying.</b> We kept in total 144 pairs of great tits (Parus major) in separate climate-controlled aviaries over 4 years to correlate pre-breeding plasma luteinizing hormone (LH), prolactin (PRL) and gonadal growth with the timing <b>of</b> <b>laying.</b> Individuals varied consistently in hormone concentrations over spring, but this was not directly related to the timing of gonadal growth, nor with the <b>laying</b> <b>date</b> <b>of</b> the first egg. The timing of gonadal development in both sexes was similarly not correlated with the timing <b>of</b> <b>laying.</b> This demonstrates the female’s ability to adjust the onset <b>of</b> <b>laying</b> to environmental conditions irrespective of substantial differences in pre-laying development. We conclude that stages of reproductive development are regulated by different cues, and therefore egg laying dates need to be studied to measure the influences of environmental cues on timing of seasonal reproduction. ...|$|R
50|$|The {{stage at}} which eggs are laid is {{variable}} across North America. In Southern Florida, eggs may be laid {{as early as}} late November to as late as early January, the earliest laying known in North America. In the southeast, from south Texas to Georgia, egg laying may begin from late December to early February. From Southern California to northern Louisiana, egg laying is from early February to late March. The largest swath of egg-laying owls from central California to South Carolina to {{as far north as}} Ohio and Massachusetts is from late February to early April. In the Rocky Mountains, Northwestern United States, northern New England and eastern Canada, egg laying is from early March to late April. In the rest of Canada and Alaska, egg laying may be from late March to early May. The latest known <b>date</b> <b>of</b> egg <b>laying</b> was in mid-June in Saskatchewan and the Yukon Territory. In northwestern Utah and north-central Alberta, egg-laying can be 3-4 weeks earlier than usual when food is abundant and weather is favorable. For owls found in more tropical climates, the <b>dates</b> <b>of</b> the breeding season are somewhat undefined. There are usually 2 eggs per clutch, but clutches range in size from 1 to 6 eggs (over 3 is uncommon, over 4 is very rare), depending on environmental conditions. The average egg width is 46.5 mm, the average length is 55 mm and the average weight is 51 g, although mass could be slightly higher elsewhere because this figure is from Los Angeles County, CA where the owls are relatively small. The incubation period ranges from 28 to 37 days, averaging 33 days. The female alone usually does all the incubation and rarely moves from the nest, while the male owl captures food and brings it to her, with the first nightly food delivery typically occurring soon after dark.|$|R
