25|$|The {{story of}} the Battle of Ballantyne Pier {{can be traced back}} to 1912 when the International Longshoremen’s Association (ILA), began {{organizing}} amongst waterfront workers in Canada, and alongside the Lumber Handlers’ Union in Vancouver. Going <b>head</b> <b>to</b> <b>head</b> <b>with</b> the employers association, the Shipping Federation, several strikes resulting in wage increases were won by workers in the coming years. Victories on the waterfront increased over the next decade, and by 1923 the Shipping Federation became determined to break the power of the ILA.|$|E

Glory thrashed Adelaide United in the {{preliminary}} final and faced Parramatta at Parramatta Stadium to try and go for back to back victories. In pouring rain, Parramatta were brought down {{to the level of}} their opponents and scrapped for every ball in a match devoid of many chances. Mori wasted two sitters before young striker Nick Mrđa nailed a shot past Clint Bolton to claim the golden goal and win the match for Glory and their second NSL title.|$|E

On that night the Steiner Brothers won, but Fire and Ice were not deterred. After a pre-PPV loss to The Rock 'n' Roll Express at Bash at the Beach, dissension started to appear between the two, a dissension that turned into battle as Norton attacked Ice Train after another team loss. Norton defeated the Ice Train at Hog Wild in a submission match, but lost to Ice Train in a rematch a month later.|$|E

25|$|The {{next two}} Blues games {{would see the}} team go <b>head</b> <b>to</b> <b>head</b> <b>with</b> other Premier League teams in trouble {{at the foot of}} the table. Newcastle were first up at St Andrew's, where a James McFadden goal in the first half was {{cancelled}} out by an early goal in the second half by Michael Owen. Then it was a trip to the Madejski Stadium, where Reading were able to capitalise on poor defending from set plays to earn a 2–1 victory, leaving the Blues only a point from 18th placed Bolton. The only highlight of the game was a goal for Mauro Zárate. The last game of the month saw Manchester City visit St Andrew's. Two Zárate goals and a penalty by Gary McSheffrey were enough to overcome the Manchester team, who scored with a penalty of their own from Elano.|$|E
25|$|Luke and Butch {{stayed with}} the SWCW {{through the rest of}} 1983 and into 1984. There, the two again came <b>head</b> <b>to</b> <b>head</b> <b>with</b> the Fabulous Ones; this time the prize was the SWCW World Tag Team Championship. The Fabulous Ones had {{supposedly}} won the titles in Australia, which is generally believed to be a fictitious tournament invented by the SWCW. The Sheepherders defeated the Fabs on 4 March and held the titles until the SWCW abandoned the tag team titles in September 1984. The next major stop for the Sheepherders was a return to Puerto Rico and the WWC, this time competing as “The Sheepherders” instead of “Los Pastores”. On 6 January 1985, the team defeated Invader I and Invader III for the WWC North American Tag Team Championship in Bayamón, Puerto Rico. Butch and Luke lost and then regained the titles from Invaders I & III in March and held on to the gold until August when the Invaders won the tag team title back for good.|$|E
25|$|After {{dealing with}} Jimmy Hart's stable the Fabulous Ones {{suddenly}} {{got a whole}} different team challenging them for the gold. Luke Williams and Jonathan Boyd (The Sheepherders) had entered the CWA {{in the fall of}} 1982 and soon came <b>head</b> <b>to</b> <b>head</b> <b>with</b> the Fabulous Ones. The Fabulous Ones / Sheepherder feud stands {{as one of the most}} memorable and bloody feuds. A feud that would rage on in several promotions between 1982 and 1987. The “pretty boy”, well polished Fabulous Ones and the ugly, brawling savage Sheepherders made for the perfect opponents and repeatedly drew big gates all over the country. The matches started out pretty evenly with the Fabulous Ones and the Sheepherders splitting the decisions but soon turned brutal and often without a definite winner. In December, 1982 the Sheepherders won the Southern Tag Team Championship from Lane and Keirn which only turned the intensity of the matches up a notch. Between late December and Mid February the two teams traded the belts back and forth 4 times with the Fabulous Ones ending up with possession of them in the end. On March 28 the Sheepherders wrestled their last match in the Mid-South Coliseum before leaving the CWA giving the Fabulous Ones (Kayfabe) credit for running them out of Memphis.|$|E

In the first fall Villano IV pinned El Galeno del Mal ("the bad Doctor"; Dr. Wagner Jr.) and then team captain Villano III pinned Blue Panther to claim the first fall for their team. In the second fall Dr. Wagner Jr. won the fall for his team by defeating team captain Villano III by pinfall. The third fall of the match, which was also the longest of the three falls by far, saw Villano IV force team captain Dr. Wagner Jr. {{to give in to}} the pain of a submission hold. In the fourth match of the night Los Guapos ("The Hansome Ones"), the team of Shocker and Emilio Charles Jr. teaming up with Tarzan Boy from Los Guerreros del Infierno. On the opposite side El Satánico, continued his feud with Los Guerreros after they turned on Satánico and Los Infernales, teamed up with the clear cut tecnicos of Atlantis and Mr. Niebla. In the first fall Tarzan Boy pinned his rival Satánico while Shocker pinned Atlantis to gain the first fall. In the second fall Satánico reversed his fortune when he pinned Tarzan Boy moments after Atlantis had pinned Shocker, tying the match at one fall apiece. In the third fall Tarzan Boy caused his team the match when he was disqualified for excessive violence against Satánico, ignoring the referee's instructions to stop on more than one occasion. With the disqualification Satánico, Atlantis and Mr. Niebla won the fall and the match.|$|E

5000|$|The MORT gene {{is located}} on human {{chromosome}} 19, at position 56,989,000-57,007,000 (hg19) inside a cluster of zinc finger genes (ZNF genes).

A {{large portion of the}} second MORT exon is formed by repetitive elements - two LINEs and an LTR element. [...] The MORT promoter is located in a CpG island and is shared with the ZNF667 gene; the two genes residing in a <b>head</b> <b>to</b> <b>head</b> orientation <b>with</b> one another.

500|$|After redshirting his {{freshman}} year in 1980–81 {{because he could not}} yet get clearance from the NCAA to play, Olajuwon played sparingly as a redshirt freshman in 1981–82, and the Cougars were eliminated in the Final Four by the eventual NCAA champion, North Carolina Tar Heels. Olajuwon sought advice from the coaching staff about how to increase his playing time, and they advised him to work out with local Houston resident and multiple NBA MVP winner, Moses Malone. Malone, who was then a center on the NBA's Houston Rockets, played games every off season with several NBA players at the Fonde Recreation Center. Olajuwon joined the workouts and went <b>head</b> <b>to</b> <b>head</b> <b>with</b> Malone in several games throughout the summer. Olajuwon credited this experience with rapidly improving his game: [...] "The way Moses helped me is by being out there playing and allowing me to go against that level of competition.
