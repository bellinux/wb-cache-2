50|$|Dryas octopetala (common names include <b>mountain</b> <b>avens,</b> eightpetal mountain-avens, white dryas, {{and white}} dryad) is an Arctic-alpine {{flowering}} {{plant in the}} family Rosaceae. It is a small prostrate evergreen subshrub forming large colonies. The specific epithet octopetala derives from the Greek octo (eight) and petalon (petal), referring to the eight petals of the flower, an unusual number in the Rosaceae, where five is the normal number. However, flowers with up to 16 petals also occur naturally.|$|R

5|$|The three coves to {{the east}} of Helvellyn are all {{important}} sites for remnant populations of arctic-alpine plants. Species such as downy willow (Salix lapponum), <b>mountain</b> <b>avens</b> (Dryas octopetala), alpine mouse-ear (Cerastium alpinum), alpine meadowgrass (Poa alpina) and others have been able to survive in these coves since the last glaciation through a combination of rocks rich in basic minerals, a harsh micro-climate, and inaccessibility to grazing sheep on cliff ledges. However, these populations are small and are not reproducing well. Natural England has introduced a recovery plan for them.|$|R
50|$|Its {{breeding}} {{habitat is}} alpine tundra, preferably rocky ridges dominated by scree, rock fields, lichens, dwarf shrubs and Dryas (<b>mountain</b> <b>avens),</b> and less commonly in tundra with mosses and sedges. It is generally found away from suitable habitat that {{is close to}} forest. In the non breeding season, it is a rocky shore specialist, feeding on rocky shores, reefs, and ledges on the coast. It will feed from the spray zone on the water's edge to just above the tide line. In some circumstances, it will feed on sandy beaches and mudflats near rocky areas.|$|R

50|$|Conival {{is part of}} the Ben More Assynt Site of Special Scientific Interest {{because of}} its {{outstanding}} geological features, it displays the Moine Thrust Belt clearly on its slopes, this is an upthrust of rocks caused by tectonic plate collision during the Silurian period. There are good examples of limestone pavement on the lower western flank of the mountain in the valley of the River Traligill. Conival also lies within the UNESCO endorsed North West Highlands Geopark and the Inchnadamph National Nature Reserve. The underlying limestone within the reserve creates ideal conditions for rare plants like <b>mountain</b> <b>avens,</b> frog orchid and holly fern.|$|R
50|$|This herbivorous bird's diet varies seasonally. Nitrogen-rich snow {{buttercup}} {{leaves are}} favored {{in the spring}} season, while willow catkins, <b>mountain</b> <b>avens</b> flowers, and chickweed blooms, other flowers and leaves, lichens and berries form {{the majority of the}} ptarmigan's diet in the summer. Once fall and winter arrive in the region, the ptarmigan feeds on pine needles, seeds, willow and alder buds and twigs. Winter food sources have a much higher cellulose content than does summer forage, so the ptarmigan relies on bacteria-aided digestion in the cecum to extract essential nutrients. During the summer, the ptarmigan eats grit to assist in digesting plant material.|$|R
