40|$|This report {{reviews the}} use of {{stepwise}} testing approaches for the prediction of skin and <b>eye</b> <b>irritation</b> and <b>corrosion</b> in a regulatory context. It is published as a companion report to the "Review of Literature-Based Models for Skin and <b>Eye</b> <b>Irritation</b> and Corrosion", an ECB report which reviewed the state-of-the-art of in silico and in vitro dermal and ocular <b>irritation</b> and <b>corrosion</b> human health hazard endpoints. In the former review, the focus was placed on reviewing alternative in silico approaches to assess acute local toxic effects, such as QSARs, SARs, chemical categories, and read-across and analogue approaches. Special {{emphasis was placed on}} literature-based (Q) SAR models for skin and <b>eye</b> <b>irritation</b> and <b>corrosion</b> and expert systems. In the present review, the emphasis is on different schemes (testing strategies) that have been conceived for the integrated use of different approaches, including in silico, in vitro and in vivo methods.

40|$|The {{proposed}} REACH regulation {{within the}} European Union (EU) aims to minimise {{the number of}} laboratory animals used for human hazard and risk assessment while ensuring adequate protection of {{human health and the}} environment. One way to achieve this goal is to develop non-testing methods, such as (quantitative) structure -activity relationships, suitable for identifying toxicological hazard from chemical structure and physicochemical properties alone. A database containing data submitted within the EU New Chemicals Notification procedure was compiled by the German Bundesinstitut für Risikobewertung (BfR). On the basis of these data, the BfR built a decision support system (DSS) for the prediction of several toxicological endpoints. For the prediction of <b>eye</b> <b>irritation</b> and <b>corrosion</b> potential, the DSS contains 31 physicochemical exclusion rules evaluated previously by the European Chemicals Bureau (ECB), and 27 inclusion rules that define structural alerts potentially responsible for <b>eye</b> <b>irritation</b> and/or <b>corrosion.</b> This work summarises the results of a study carried out by the ECB (Eurpoean Chemical Bureau) to assess the performance of the BfR structural rulebase. The assessment included: a) evaluation of the structural alerts by using the training set of 1341 substances with experimental data for <b>eye</b> <b>irritation</b> and corrosion; and b) external validation by using an independent test set of 199 chemicals. Recommendations are made for the further development of the structural rules in order to increase the overall predictivity of the DSS. JRC. I. 3 -Toxicology and chemical substance...|$|R

40|$|Purpose: The {{purpose of}} this study was to explore a {{possible}} mechanism of <b>eye</b> <b>irritation</b> by constructing a corresponding general quantitative structure-activity relationship (QSAR) model using a genetic algorithm. The model was derived from a subset of diverse chemical structures found in the Draize <b>eye</b> <b>irritation</b> ECETOC data set. Methods: Molecular dynamic simulation (MDS) was used to generate intermolecular membrane-solute interaction properties. These intermolecular properties were combined with intramolecular physicochemical properties and features of the solute (irritant) to construct QSAR models using multi-dimensional linear regression and the Genetic Function Approximation (GFA) algorithm. Results: Significant QSAR models for estimating <b>eye</b> <b>irritation</b> potential were constructed in which solute aqueous solvation free energy and solute-membrane interaction energies are the principle correlation descriptors. These physicochemical descriptors were selected from a trial set of 95 descriptors. Conclusion: Combining intermolecular solute-membrane interaction descriptors with intramolecular solute descriptors yields statistically significant <b>eye</b> <b>irritation</b> QSAR models. The resultant QSAR models support an <b>eye</b> <b>irritation</b> mechanism of the action in which increased aqueous solubility of the irritant, and its strength of binding to the membrane, both increase <b>eye</b> <b>irritation...</b>|$|R
30|$|For <b>eye</b> <b>irritation,</b> the {{situation}} is essentially quite similar. The replacement of the Draize test for <b>eye</b> <b>irritation</b> again was achieved by two methods. The ex vivo Bovine Corneal Opacity and Permeability (BCOP; [51, 52]) <b>eye</b> <b>irritation</b> test is used to identify strong <b>eye</b> <b>irritation</b> potential and the in vitro EpiOcular™ <b>eye</b> <b>irritation</b> test (EIT) is {{used to evaluate the}} irritation potential of compounds to the eye. The BCOP and similar ex vivo tests utilize slaughterhouse material to assess the severe <b>eye</b> <b>irritation</b> potential of a test substance through its ability to induce opacity and increased permeability in, for example, an isolated bovine cornea. In contrast, the EIT and similar tests use the commercially available reconstructed human cornea-like epithelium (RhCE), which closely mimics the histological, morphological, biochemical and physiological properties of the human corneal epithelium to determine if a test substance is an eye irritant based on its ability to induce cytotoxicity in RhCE tissue, as measured by the MTT assay. These tests, and alternatives, are again used {{within the context of a}} simple testing strategy and described in further detail elsewhere [52 – 56].|$|R

5000|$|Several {{suspected}} causal {{factors in}} our environment {{have been studied}} so far. One hypothesis is that indoor air pollution may cause <b>eye</b> and airway <b>irritation.</b> [...] <b>Eye</b> <b>irritation</b> depends somewhat on destabilization of the outer-eye tear film, in which the formation of dry spots on the cornea, resulting in ocular discomfort. [...] Occupational factors {{are also likely to}} influence the perception of <b>eye</b> <b>irritation.</b> Some of these are lighting (glare and poor contrast), gaze position, reduced blink rate, limited number of breaks from visual tasking, and a constant combination of accommodation, musculoskeletal burden, and impairment of the visual nervous system. [...] Another factor that may be related is work stress. [...] In addition, psychological factors have been found in multivariate analyses to be associated with an increase in <b>eye</b> <b>irritation</b> among VDU users. [...] Other risk factors, such as chemical toxins/irritants (e.g. amines, formaldehyde, acetaldehyde, acrolein, N-decane, VOCs, ozone, pesticides and preservatives, allergens, etc.) might cause <b>eye</b> <b>irritation</b> as well.|$|R
50|$|Certain {{volatile}} organic compounds that are both chemically reactive and airway irritants may cause <b>eye</b> <b>irritation.</b> Personal factors (e.g. use of contact lenses, eye make-up, and certain medications) may also affect destabilization of the tear film and possibly result in more eye symptoms. Nevertheless, if airborne particles alone should destabilize the tear film and cause <b>eye</b> <b>irritation,</b> their content of surface-active compounds must be high. An integrated physiological risk model with blink frequency, destabilization, and break-up of the eye tear film as inseparable phenomena may explain <b>eye</b> <b>irritation</b> among office workers in terms of occupational, climate, and eye-related physiological risk factors.|$|R

5000|$|There are {{two major}} {{measures}} of <b>eye</b> <b>irritation.</b> One is blink frequency which can be observed by human behavior. The other measures are break up time, tear flow, hyperemia (redness, swelling), tear fluid cytology, and epithelial damage (vital stains) etc., which are human beings' physiological reactions. Blink frequency {{is defined as the}} number of blinks per minute and it is associated with <b>eye</b> <b>irritation.</b> Blink frequencies are individual with mean frequencies of < 2-3 to 20-30 blinks/minute, and they depend on environmental factors including the use of contact lenses. Dehydration, mental activities, work conditions, room temperature, relative humidity, and illumination all influence blink frequency. Break-up time (BUT) is another major measure of <b>eye</b> <b>irritation</b> and tear film stability. [...] It is defined as the time interval (in seconds) between blinking and rupture. BUT is considered to reflect the stability of the tear film as well. In normal persons, the break-up time exceeds the interval between blinks, and, therefore, the tear film is maintained. Studies have shown that blink frequency is correlated negatively with break-up time. This phenomenon indicates that perceived <b>eye</b> <b>irritation</b> is associated with an increase in blink frequency since the cornea and conjunctiva both have sensitive nerve endings that belong to the first trigeminal branch. Other evaluating methods, such as hyperemia, cytology etc. have increasingly been used to assess <b>eye</b> <b>irritation.</b>|$|R

40|$|The general {{aim of this}} PhD {{project was}} to {{investigate}} the integrated use of physicochemical and in vitro data for predicting the toxicological hazard of chemicals in animals. This was achieved in two stages: firstly, by developing two types of model for acute dermal and ocular toxicity - structure-activity relationships (SARs) based on easily calculated physicochemical properties, and prediction models (PMs) based on experimentally derived physicochemical or in vitro data; and secondly, by evaluating the tiered testing approach to hazard classification, in which different classification models (CMs) are applied sequentially before animal testing is conducted. The thesis therefore reports the development and assessment of CMs for skin <b>irritation,</b> skin <b>corrosion</b> and <b>eye</b> <b>irritation,</b> as well as the outcome of simulations in which these models were incorporated into tiered testing strategies for these toxicological endpoints. The results show that the tiered testing approach to hazard classification provides a reliable means of reducing and refining the use of animals, without compromising the ability to classify chemicals. In addition to developing the above-mentioned CMs, regression models for corneal permeability were developed, and the relationship between corneal permeability and <b>eye</b> <b>irritation</b> was investigated. The thesis also describes the development and assessment of a novel statistical method called embedded cluster modelling (ECM), which generates elliptic models of biological activity from embedded data sets. The combined use of this method with the existing method of cluster significance analysis (CSA) is illustrated through the development of SARs for <b>eye</b> <b>irritation</b> potential. Finally, novel applications of the bootstrap resampling method were investigated. In particular, algorithms based on this method are shown to provide a means of assessing: a) the minimal variability associated with the Draize rabbit tests for skin and eye irritation; and b) the variability in Cooper statistics (commonly used to summarise the performance of two-group CMs) that arises from chemical variation...|$|R

40|$|Most of the {{cosmetic}} compounds with preservative properties {{available in}} the market pose some risks concerning safety, such as the possibility of causing sensitization. Due {{to the fact that}} there are few options, the proper development of new molecules with this purpose is needed. Xylitol is a natural sugar, and the antimicrobial properties of xylitol-derived compounds have already been described in the literature. C- 8 xylitol monoester and xylitol phosphate esters may be useful for the development of skincare products. As an initial screen for safety of chemicals, the combination of in silico methods and in vitro testing can aid in prioritizing resources in toxicological investigations while reducing the ethical and monetary costs that are related to animal and human testing. This study was designed to evaluate the safety of C- 8 xylitol monoester and xylitol phosphate esters regarding carcinogenicity, mutagenicity, skin and eye irritation/corrosion and sensitization through alternative methods. For the initial safety assessment, quantitative structure-activity relationship methodology was used. The prediction of the parameters carcinogenicity/mutagenicity, skin and eye irritation/corrosion and sensitization was generated from the chemical structure. The analysis also comprised physical-chemical properties, Cramer rules, threshold of toxicological concern and Michael reaction. In silico results of candidate molecules were compared to 19 compounds with preservative properties that are {{available in the}} market. Additionally, in vitro tests (Ames test for mutagenicity, cytotoxicity and phototoxicity tests and hen's egg test - chorioallantoic membrane for irritation) were performed to complement the evaluation. In silico evaluation of both molecules presented no structural alerts related to <b>eye</b> and skin <b>irritation,</b> <b>corrosion</b> and sensitization, but some alerts for micronucleus and carcinogenicity were detected. However, by comparison, C- 8 xylitol monoester, xylitol phosphate esters showed similar or better results than the compounds available in the market. Concerning experimental data, phototoxicity and mutagenicity results were negative. As expected for compounds with preservative activity, xylitol-derived substances presented positive result in cytotoxicity test. In hen's egg test, both molecules were irritants. Our results suggested that xylitol-derived compounds appear to be suitable candidates for preservative systems in cosmetics...|$|R
40|$|We {{measured}} thresholds for <b>eye</b> <b>irritation</b> and odor in {{homologous series}} of alcohols (ethanol, 1 -butanol, 1 -hexanol, and 1 -octanol), ketones (2 -propanone, 2 -pentanone, 2 -heptanone, and 2 -nonanone), and alkylbenzenes (toluene, ethyl benzene, and propyl benzene). <b>Eye</b> <b>irritation</b> thresholds were well above odor thresholds for all series. Both sensory thresholds declined with carbon chain length, {{a trend that}} has implicated lipophilicity in the potency of these and related stimuli. <b>Eye</b> <b>irritation</b> thresholds were remarkably close to nasal pungency thresholds obtained previously in persons lacking olfaction (i. e., anosmics). The agreement between the two thresholds implies that, despite differences in the mucus layer at the two sites and in the epithelial tissue itself, there is remarkable similarity {{at the site of}} stimulation. As a practical matter, the eyes could serve as the sites to assess potency for induction of nasal pungency, an assessment previously limited to testing anosmics. Presumably — for our brief stimulus presentations (1 - 3 sec) — the differences between ocular and nasal mucosae have little relevance to chemical sensitivity. Studies of the ability of homologous chemical series to evoke threshold <b>eye</b> <b>irritation,</b> nasal pungency, and odor not only have practical value but also can help to define the physicochemical properties of the receptor and perireceptor biophases...|$|R

40|$|We tested four normosmics {{and four}} anosmics in {{detection}} thresholds for six terpenes commonly found indoors: cumene, p-cymene, delta- 3 -carene, linalool, 1 - 8 cineole, and geraniol. Normosmics provided odor thresholds and anosmics provided nasal pungency thresholds. All subjects provided nasal localization (i. e., right/left nostril) and <b>eye</b> <b>irritation</b> thresholds. Each type of threshold was measured eight times per subject-stimulus combination. Stimuli were presented from squeeze bottles in a two-alternative forced-choice procedure via an ascending method of limits. Odor thresholds ranged between 0. 1 and 1. 0 ppm. Nasal pungency thresholds lay about three {{orders of magnitude}} above odor thresholds. Nasal localization and <b>eye</b> <b>irritation</b> thresholds did not differ between normosmics and anosmics, and fell close to nasal pungency thresholds. Olfactory thresholds could be obtained for all stimuli in all repetitions using the criterion of five correct choices in a row. Trigeminal thresholds (i. e., pungency, localization, and <b>eye</b> <b>irritation)</b> could be obtained on all repetitions only for some terpenes using that same criterion. Carene and cineol produced nasal pungency and <b>eye</b> <b>irritation</b> on all repetitions. None of the terpenes could be localized on all repetitions, but cineol was localized {{a higher percentage of}} instances than were the other stimuli. At the other extreme, geraniol failed to evoke any of the three trigeminal responses in most instances. Overall, the results indicate that the three trigeminal thresholds produce a uniform view of the potency of these terpenes, with nasal pungency and <b>eye</b> <b>irritation</b> being slightly more sensitive than nasal localization. Furthermore, application of a previously-derived linear solvation energy relationship to the results reinforced the view that physicochemical properties can predict the chemesthetic impact of volatile organic compounds...|$|R

This may have obscured the role airborne particles play. Based on previously published semi-empirical models, the paper describes the influence of turbulence, gravitational settling, electrical fields, and thermophoresis on deposition velocity. A probabilistic approach was used to determine percentile ranges in deposition velocity when the magnitude of these parameters varied within typical ranges. The calculations suggest that differences in external factors other than particle size may cause differences in the deposition velocity of one order of magnitude or more.

The <b>eye</b> <b>irritation</b> test was performed according to the toxicity testing regulation of the Korea Food & Drug Administration (2009. 8. 24, KFDA 2009 - 116). After SPS had been applied on the left eye of the rabbits, <b>eye</b> <b>irritation</b> in the cornea, iris and conjunctiva was observed on the 1 st, 2 nd, 3 rd, 4 th & 7 th day. After SPS had been dropped on bacterial species that cause keratitis, the minimum inhibition concentration {{and the size of the}} inhibition zone were measured. The anti-bacterial potency was also measured by taking the size of inhibition zone. Results: After SPS had been administered on the left eye of the rabbits, none of nine rabbits were found to show abnormal signs or weight changes. After SPS had been administered on the left eye of the rabbits, no <b>eye</b> <b>irritation</b> in the cornea, iris and conjunctiva was observed on the 1 st, 2 nd, 3 rd, 4 th & 7 th day.
