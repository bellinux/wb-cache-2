40|$|A physics-based {{model is}} {{developed}} for analysing the coupled phenomena of fission gas swelling and release in UO 2 fuel during irradiation. The model is featured by {{a level of}} complexity suitable for application to integral fuel rod analysis and consistent with the uncertainties pertaining to some parameters.

The applicability of the new model to integral fuel rod analysis is verified through implementation and testing in the TRANSURANUS fuel rod analysis code.

40|$|To {{investigate}} {{the phenomenon of}} high burn-up fuel pellet material potentially disintegrating into powder under a rapid temperature transient, such as in a LOCA-type accident scenario, two independent scoping studies were commissioned. The first was to {{investigate the}} effect of hydrostatic restraint pressure on Fission Gas Release (FGR) from small samples of highly irradiated fuel (71 MWd/kgU) during a series of rapid temperature ramps. Experimentally, when the FGR increased rapidly during the temperature transients, the fuel was assumed to be "pulverized", i. e., fragmented into powder. In the second series of experiments, laser heating of small samples was used to investigate the temperature at which fuel pulverization was initiated. Subsequent to fuel disintegration, there was always a spectrum of particle sizes present. The significance of this observation was recognized in the context of <b>extended</b> <b>burn-up</b> operation in commercial reactors. Based on the observation from these investigations, a fuel fragmentation threshold has been discussed and developed. We conclude that fuel disintegration could be of potential importance in limiting the performance and productive lifetime of nuclear fuel. However, since only fuel closely adjacent to ballooned or ruptured cladding would be released in a LOCA-type transient, expulsion of pulverized fuel from the ruptured fuel rod is not considered a safety issue; cooling of the defected assembly remains possible and there is no issue with respect to local criticality.

40|$|The {{objective}} of this research program is to address major nuclear fuels performance issues for the design and use of oxide-type fuels in the current and advanced nuclear reactor applications. Fuel performance is a major issue for <b>extending</b> fuel <b>burn-up</b> which has the added advantage of reducing the used fuel waste stream. It {{will also be a}} significant issue with respect to developing advanced fuel cycle processes where {{it may be possible to}} incorporate minor actinides in various fuel forms so that they can be 'burned' rather than join the used fuel waste stream. The potential to fission or transmute minor actinides and certain long-lived fission product isotopes would transform the high level waste storage strategy by removing the need to consider fuel storage on the millennium time scale...|$|R
40|$|AbstractPressurised and {{boiling water}} {{reactors}} contain zirconium alloys, {{which are used}} as nuclear fuel cladding. Oxidation of these alloys, and the associated hydrogen pick-up, is a limiting factor in the lifetime of the fuel. To <b>extend</b> the <b>burn-up</b> of nuclear fuel requires control of the oxidation, and therefore development of a mechanistic understanding of the cladding corrosion process. Synchrotron X-ray diffraction (S-XRD) {{has been used to}} analyse oxide layers formed during in-situ air oxidation of Zircaloy- 4 and ZIRLO™. Analysis shows that as the oxide thickness increases over time there is a relaxation of the stresses present in both the monoclinic and meta-stable tetragonal phases, and a reduction in the tetragonal phase fraction. To better understand the mechanisms behind stress relaxation in the oxide layer, finite element analysis has been used to simulate mechanical aspects of the oxidation process. This simulation was first developed based on stress relaxation in oxides formed in autoclave, and analysed ex-situ using S-XRD. Relaxation mechanisms include creep and hydrogen-induced lattice strain in the metal substrate and creep in the oxide layer. Subsequently the finite element analysis has been extended to stress relaxation observed by in-situ S-XRD oxidation experiments. Finite element analysis indicates that the impact of creep in the oxide is negligible, and the impact of both creep and hydrogen-induced lattice strain in the metal substrate metal is small. The implication is that stress relaxation must result from another source such as the development of roughness at the metal–oxide interface, or fracture in the oxide layer...|$|R
40|$|In this paper, {{fuel rod}} {{performance}} analyses are presented for the Italian 80 MWth XADS (eXperimental Accelerator Driven System). This sub-critical system is cooled by Lead-Bismuth Eutectic (LBE), which rises on average from 300 °C to 400 °C {{at the core}} exit, and is fuelled with UO 2 -PuO 2 mixed oxides. Both the ferritic-martensitic T 91 and the austenitic AISI 316 L steels have been considered as cladding materials, and the overall fuel rod behaviour has been simulated in normal operation conditions {{from the beginning to}} the end of life. In order to point out some critical issues related to the two steels, thermo-mechanical analyses have been accomplished also at <b>extended</b> <b>burn-up.</b> Moreover, a sensitivity study has allowed to evaluate the role of some significant aspects on fuel rod performance. Calculations have been carried out by means of the TRANSURANUS code, which has been recently adapted for modelling the behaviour of T 91 and AISI 316 L in LBE environment (with in situ oxide layer protection), and three different coolant channels representative of the XADS core have been considered. For the demanding operating conditions of the Hot Channel (HC), the analysis has indicated that corrosion effects would significantly degrade the whole thermo-mechanical performance of fuel rods without the adoption of appropriate protective coatings. The HC fuel rod with T 91 cladding exhibits a better performance with respect to the AISI 316 L rod in terms of swelling strain, maximum fuel temperature, fission gas release and inner pressure, but the resistance of T 91 to radiation embrittlement and creep requires further investigation, especially under closed gap conditions (FCMI - Fuel Cladding Mechanical Interaction) ...|$|E
40|$|This {{work is a}} {{study of}} changes in coolant {{activity}} due to corrosion products of <b>extended</b> <b>burn-up</b> cycles of 18 - 24 months duration, in a typical pressurized water reactor, under pH and boric acid variations. It deals with non-linearly changing corrosion rates coupled with pH effects. The CPAIR-P computer program was modified to accommodate for time-dependent rising corrosion and effects of coolant chemistry. These simulations suggest {{that the effect of}} an increase in pH value for an extended 24 -month cycle on a specific activity, {{in the form of a}} decrease in the said activity, is smeared by the rising corrosion. The new saturation values for activity at the end-of-cycle are lower than with a reactor operated at constant low pH/natural boric acid in the coolant. For a non-linear rise in the corrosion rate coupled with a pH rise from 6. 9 to 7. 4 and the use of enriched boric acid (30 %- 40 %), coolant activity first rises to a peak value during the cycle and then approaches a much smaller saturation value at the end of the cycle, when compared with the activity for the system having a constant low pH value (6. 9) in the coolant. In this work, we have shown that the use of enriched boric acid as a chemical shim actually lowers primary coolant activity when higher pH values, rather than natural boric acid, are employed in the coolant. For multiple long-term operating cycles, the saturation value of corrosion product activity increases in the first two cycles and becomes constant in subsequent ones, due to the high operational pH value for enriched boric acid (40 %) as a chemical shim...|$|E
