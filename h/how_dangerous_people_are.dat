50|$|Teja (Akkineni Nagarjuna) is {{an orphan}} {{in the city}} who studies law. He {{falls in love with}} Vijayashanti who's also a law student in his college. He one day sees Delhi Ganesh who takes a picture of him as he follows him to his village. He finds out that Delhi Ganesh is his father. He was a thief until a police officer raped and killed his wife. He wanted Nagarjuna to become a {{successful}} person and not end up like him. Unable to raise him himself, he sends his son to an orphanage. Nagarjuna experiences the life in his village as he knows <b>how</b> <b>dangerous</b> <b>people</b> <b>are</b> and that they're forced to become thieves. He one day meets Chandra Mohan who gets arrested for a robbery he was framed in as Nagarjuna tries to stop the cops. They arrest Nagarjuna as Delhi Ganesh forces the villains who rule the village to let him go. Delhi Ganesh worried about how Nagarjuna will end up tells him {{to go back to the}} city.

They all think of Nagarjuna as a great man as the villains try to stop him. How Nagarjuna protects and saves everyone in the village forms the rest of the story.|$|E
5000|$|On 30 November, Malimali {{accused the}} {{military}} {{of being in}} contempt of court when it refused to release former CRW soldier Ropate Nakau on bail to visit his father over weekends, as the High Court had ordered on 11 November, and after Commodore Bainimarama had not replied to two letters she had sent. In response, Major Tuinaosara replied that the soldiers facing mutiny charges were dangerous {{and should not be}} released. [...] "The offence deals with firearms and the military will not risk redeploying them. <b>People</b> <b>are</b> forgetting why we are having a retrial. People died in the mutiny. They <b>are</b> forgetting <b>how</b> <b>dangerous</b> these <b>people</b> <b>are</b> and they should not forget the mutiny shook the security of the nation and these people speak of rights," [...] Tuinaosara said. Malimali rejected this, saying that the ten soldiers in remand were citizens, and had a right to be presumed innocent until convicted.|$|R

25|$|This twelve-day period used to {{be called}} the unbaptized days, during which the demonic forces of all kinds were {{considered}} to be more than usually active and <b>dangerous.</b> <b>People</b> <b>were</b> cautious not to attract their attention, and did not go out late at night. The latter precaution was especially because of the demons called karakondžula, imagined as heavy, squat, and ugly creatures. When a karakondžula found someone outdoors during the night of an unbaptized day, it would jump on his back, and make him carry it wherever it wanted. This torture would end only when roosters announced the dawn; at that moment the creature would release its victim and run away.|$|R
50|$|In 1982, Slovák was {{sentence}}d to 15 {{years in prison for}} his first murder. He started to serve his sentence in Leopoldov Prison but was released on probation March 10, 1990 because of a wide-ranging amnesty by president of Czechoslovakia Václav Havel. Almost two-thirds of Czechoslovak criminals at that time were released from prison practically at the same time. Many murderers, career criminals and <b>dangerous</b> <b>people</b> <b>were</b> released from prisons on probation or parole. Without the amnesty, Slovák would have been released in 1997. From 1990 to 1991 Slovák murdered at least 4 women, committing his second murder just four months after being released from prison.|$|R

5000|$|There {{have been}} {{concerns}} amongst {{mental health professionals}} that the 2007 amendments have been based more upon tabloid stories on the danger presented by mentally disordered people, especially people with personality disorder such as Michael Stone, than on the practical shortcomings of the unamended Act. Critics asserted that it would mean mental health professionals being [...] "suborned as agents of social control". Supporters of more restrictive legislation insisted that <b>dangerous</b> <b>people</b> must <b>be</b> detained in hospital by doctors in their own interests and for public protection, {{regardless of whether they}} can be treated.|$|R

Internet is a perfect environment for children, for exploring the world, learning and having fun. However, access to illegal sites that contain violence and sexuality, and contact <b>dangerous</b> <b>people</b> <b>are</b> among the particular risks for children using the internet. It is a known fact that, internet and developing technology make the production and distribution of child pornography cheaper and easier.

5000|$|Out of {{all animals}} apes and monkeys have the strongest {{physical}} and behavioral resemblance to humans. In circus acts and comedy films {{they are often}} dressed up and made to perform tricks that mimick human behaviour. Especially chimpanzees and little monkeys are popular with children because of this stereotypical portrayal. However, simians can be unpredictable and therefore <b>dangerous.</b> When <b>people</b> <b>are</b> caught off guard they can easily create mayhem by climbing on top of things, grab stuff away or even attack people.|$|R

40|$|Experienced legal {{academics}} {{and mental health}} professionals explore the current approaches to “dangerousness” and preventive detention. The defining characteristics of those deemed dangerous by society vary according to culture, place, and time, and the contributors to this text have gathered to analyze the policies and practices related to current out-groups such as sex offenders, suspected terrorists, and young offenders in the United States, Scotland, England, and Australia. <b>Dangerous</b> <b>People</b> <b>is</b> the result of their research, workshopping, and writing.

The section on Practice focuses on recent schemes to prevent re-offending. This text is indispensible as a resource that deals with the practical issues surrounding preventive detention and supervision schemes, the assessment of the risk of future harm in offenders, and different programs and sentencing options for high-risk offenders with mental illnesses. It contains case examples that bring real-life issues to light and sets forth an agenda to provide effective ways to protect communities from harm...|$|R

40|$|A new Brady {{report shows}} <b>how</b> <b>dangerous</b> loopholes allow criminals to buy guns easily online without a {{background}} check. This report demonstrates why Brady {{background checks on}} gun purchases are an effective policy that prevents gun crime and saves lives by keeping guns {{out of the hands}} of <b>dangerous</b> <b>people</b> prohibited from owning guns. It also makes the case for why Oregon needs to pass legislation to close the "Internet loophole" by expanding Brady background checks to all gun sales. Every year, gun violence kills more than 400 Oregonians. From 2004 to 2013, more than 4, 000 <b>people</b> <b>were</b> killed with guns.

50|$|The {{original}} estuary of the Afon Glaslyn was a <b>dangerous</b> place; many <b>people</b> <b>were</b> said to {{have died}} in the quicksands trying to cross the Traeth Mawr.

25|$|The {{disadvantage}} of the MRI scan {{in the face}} of aortic dissection is that it has limited availability and is often located only in larger hospitals, and the scan is relatively time-consuming, which may <b>be</b> <b>dangerous</b> in <b>people</b> who <b>are</b> already very unwell.

40|$|This article {{considers}} the constitutional and moral {{implications of the}} distinction the law draws between different classes of <b>dangerous</b> <b>people,</b> depending upon their status as mentally ill or mentally well. Those who are mentally well benefit from the right to freedom from incarceration unless and until they commit a crime. By contrast, <b>dangerous</b> <b>people</b> who <b>are</b> mentally ill are subject to potentially indefinite 2 ̆ 2 civil 2 ̆ 2 preemptive confinement. In a relatively recent case, Kansas v. Hendricks, the United States Supreme Court upheld the post-prison civil confinement of Leroy Hendricks, {{a man who had}} served prison time after pleading guilty to child molestation. This decision calls into serious question the continuing vitality of the line drawn between criminal and civil confinements. The article argues that this move is an appropriate one, though it carries with it the risk of generalized preventive detention. In safeguarding our liberty, the article concludes that we must tighten the qualitative and quantitative dimensions of the 2 ̆ 2 dangerousness 2 ̆ 2 criterion for civil confinement rather than relying upon the status of mental illness to protect our liberty from incarceration...|$|R

Brown is serving her sentence at the Tennessee Prison for Women. The film, which addresses harsh sentencing of minors, ends as Brown adjusts to life in prison.|$|R

500|$|In November 2006, {{more than}} 30 {{restaurant}} patrons, including {{a group of}} tourists and Democratic Alliance councillor Masizole Mnqasela, were arrested in a police raid for drinking in public. The restaurant did not sell alcohol, but Ngcawuzele explained {{that he could not}} stop people from bringing their own. [...] The incident generated controversy in the local press. Tour operator Ryan Hunt claimed that police swore at the patrons and threatened people for asking questions. [...] "The police created a <b>dangerous</b> situation. <b>People</b> <b>are</b> always encouraged to visit township attractions, but now they are turned away with that kind of situation," [...] he said. Mnqasela, a member of Cape Town's economic development committee, added, [...] "Mzoli's is internationally acclaimed and is key to township tourism. What kind of message is the police sending?" [...] The African National Congress approved the police actions, citing a need to curtail public drunkenness.|$|R
50|$|Winter {{swimming}} can <b>be</b> <b>dangerous</b> to <b>people</b> who <b>are</b> {{not used}} to swimming in very cold water. After submersion in cold water the cold shock response will occur, causing an uncontrollable gasp for air. This is followed by hyperventilation, {{a longer period of}} more rapid breathing. The gasp for air can cause a person to ingest water, which leads to drowning. As blood in the limbs is cooled and returns to the heart, this can cause fibrillation and consequently cardiac arrest. The cold shock response and cardiac arrest are the most common causes of death related to cold water immersion.|$|R
5000|$|Overcrowding is a {{huge problem}} many prisons face [...] because {{handling}} so many short-fused inmates at once can lead to many altercations. The combination of “…overcrowding, inadequate supervision, and inmate access to weapons- can create opportunities for…offenses”. [...] Trying to assert authority and strict rules on these violent offenders is extremely difficult {{due to the fact}} that these people do not respond well to restrictions and being told what to do. Having to focus on so many <b>dangerous</b> <b>people</b> at once <b>is</b> just not possible because there will always be someone not being watched over at any given moment; this is most likely when inmates choose to strike. Overcrowding is a very common issue in American prisons that leads to prison violence because the prisons will be understaffed.|$|R
50|$|Psychological {{assessment}} {{also has}} {{a role in the}} legal setting. Psychologists might be asked to assess the reliability of a witness, the quality of the testimony a witness gives, the competency of an accused person, or determine what might have happened during a crime. They also may help support a plea of insanity or to discount a plea. Judges may use the psychologist's report to change the sentence of a convicted person, and parole officers work with psychologists to create a program for the rehabilitation of a parolee. Problematic areas for psychologists include predicting <b>how</b> <b>dangerous</b> a person will be. There are currently no accurate measure for this prediction, however there is often a need for this prediction to prevent <b>dangerous</b> <b>people</b> from returning to society.|$|R

The problem of conflicts of interest becomes especially acute if a celebrity doctor endorses some specific product or approach to health when they deliver content about health, and also sells related products. Sometimes the content <b>is</b> <b>dangerous</b> because <b>people</b> who <b>are</b> sick waste time following poor or irrelevant advice and their illness advances and becomes more difficult to manage.|$|R
