40|$|The {{economic}} growth in Malaysia {{has a number of}} benefits for downstream industries including <b>jig</b> <b>and</b> <b>fixture</b> manufacturers. The nature of <b>jig</b> <b>and</b> <b>fixture</b> manufacturer as small manufacturer enterprise (SME) with relatively less resource less focus on the importance of factors that affecting project management. Therefore, this research aims to identify the important factors that affect <b>jig</b> <b>and</b> <b>fixture</b> project management <b>and</b> to assess the degree of project management performance in a <b>jig</b> <b>and</b> <b>fixture</b> manufacturer, with the focus on South Johor region. In addition, the research also aims to obtain the correlation between factors affecting project management and project management performance, as well as to develop a prediction model for project management performance. In line with this, a quantitative approach was chosen with the population consisted of all <b>jig</b> <b>and</b> <b>fixture</b> manufacturers in South Johor, Malaysia. Simple random probability sampling was used to include 53 <b>jig</b> <b>and</b> <b>fixture</b> manufacturers. Data were collected through self administered questionnaires. Descriptive analysis, correlation analysis, and regression analysis was used. Findings from the study revealed that factor that perceived as important by respondents are human factor, followed by financial, organizational, technological supply chain relationship and physical factor. In term correlation, all factors were positively correlated with project management performance except human factor where regression model suggested that two strongest predictor are technological and supply chain relationship factor. Finding from the study suggested that factor that perceived as the most important is not correlated with project management performance, and the two strong predictors were perceived at medium important level. As such, further study could be conducted to study the implementation of those factors to identify the top of importance level, the effectiveness of the implementation, the focus level of the implementation and at once analyze the challenges and problem thus obtains the remedial strategies...|$|R

40|$|Abstract — The {{successful}} {{running of}} any mass production {{depends upon the}} interchangeability to facilitate easy assembly and reduction of unit cost. Mass production methods demand a fast and easy method of positioning work for accurate operations on it. <b>Jigs</b> <b>and</b> <b>fixtures</b> are production tools used to accurately manufacture duplicate <b>and</b> interchangeable parts. <b>Jigs</b> <b>and</b> <b>fixtures</b> are specially designed so {{that large numbers of}} components can be machined or assembled identically, and to ensure interchangeability of components. The activity which we are considering is the “Stirrup Manufacturing”. Stirrups are the rectangular or square shaped frame which bounds the rods in the foundation pillars and beams. Traditionally stirrups are manufactured on a wooden platform provided with pins with respect to which the rod is bent with the help of lever. The force is applied in the form of torque and the pin works as a fulcrum point for the torque. So a special platform is being designed with <b>jig</b> <b>and</b> <b>fixtures</b> to improve the production rate, accuracy and comfort of the activity...|$|R

50|$|A good, simplistic way to {{summarize}} the change in ideas is to compare {{the making of a}} certain product in different time periods. In 1750, a rifle was made in a workshop by a craftsman using hand tools, and if he needed a new tool, it is likely that he would make it himself using the same tools and methods that he would use to make his product, the rifle (smithy, files, woodcarving knives, etc.) This type of craftsmanship can still be done today, but it is expensive in terms of skilled labor time per unit of output, and therefore it implies small total output volume and high unit price. However, today the way to make rifles in large quantity with low unit price is to first do the tool-and-die work (toolroom work) (that is, make, or have someone else make, machine tools, <b>jigs,</b> <b>and</b> <b>fixtures),</b> <b>and</b> then use those specialized tools to mass-produce the rifles in an automated way that involves no toolroom methods.|$|R
40|$|A <b>jigs</b> <b>and</b> <b>fixtures</b> {{system is}} a {{critical}} device in manufacturing. It provides guidance for tooling and keeps the workpiece at the desired position and orientation in machining processes. It is important to ensure a product satisfying design requirement and to stabilize the product quality. <b>Jig</b> <b>and</b> <b>fixture</b> design is a complex activity that needs extensive information and deep understanding about design, manufacturing, assembly and inspection. With the development of manufacturing technology, more and more flexible manufacturing systems and computer numerical controlled machine centers are used in industry. This causes a strong demand in computer-aided fixture design to shorten manufacturing cycle time and reduce cost. This thesis presents an object-oriented concurrent engineering system using an integrated semantic feature-based approach for automated <b>jig</b> <b>and</b> <b>fixture</b> design. A user may interactively design or modify a part model using the design-by-feature technique to specify all engineering properties such as material, hardness, dimension, dimensioning, tolerancing and surface finishing. A process plan will be generated for the part and it includes process details such as the machining methods, machining parameters and machining sequence arrangement. For each machining setup, a feature-based workpiece is generated from the process plan. A set of fixtures for the machining setup will be constructed based on the workpiece model and the derived cutter path. The cutter path is translated to G-code for manufacturing. The feature-based concurrent engineering system covers most application domains in production, i. e., design domain, manufacturing domain, assembly domain and inspection domain. To represent various information involved, a hierarchical structure with semantic feature definition is proposed. Semantic feature {{is defined as a}} group of abstract data with attributes not necessarily inclusive of geometric information. As sub-classes of feature, design_feature, manufacturing_feature, assembly_feature and inspection_feature are constructed to represent information in corresponding domains. Five operators used in feature transformation, namely [italic]equality, [italic]grouping, [italic]comparison, [italic]reference and [italic]reasoning, are identified and their operations within the system framework are defined. These feature classes and operators contain the vocabulary of the semantic feature-based language for information description. The concept of feature transformation is introduced. Rules for representing feature transformation in the semantic feature-based language, as the grammar of the language, are defined. The information manipulations within and across different application domains are described by feature transformations. The applications in generative process planning <b>and</b> automated <b>fixture</b> design for prismatic and cylindrical workpiece are developed. The validity of the system is verified by both simulating the cutting path on a workstation and machining the actual part on a CNC machine...|$|R
