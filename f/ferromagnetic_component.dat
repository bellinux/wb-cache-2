40|$|Experimental {{investigations}} are presented which {{demonstrate that the}} weak ferromagnets are special materials of a larger group of magnets which exhibit two magnetic ordering structures. In weak ferromagnets the main order is anti ferromagnetic with a small <b>ferromagnetic</b> <b>component</b> existing in addition. On the other hand, materials in which other {{combinations of the two}} basic ordering structures coexist are also known. Common to all these non-collinear spin structures is that the moment components of the two magnetic structures are orthogonal. In the weak ferromagnets this orthogonality manifests already in the paramagnetic phase as a crossover from an isotropic to an anisotropic susceptibility with respect to the applied magnetic field: at high temperatures the antiferromagnetic Curie-Weiss law of the total moment is observed while for T [...] > T-c crossover to a second Curie-Weiss law due to the weak <b>ferromagnetic</b> <b>component</b> occurs. For T [...] > T-c the <b>ferromagnetic</b> <b>component</b> is, of course, parallel to the field and the anti <b>ferromagnetic</b> <b>component</b> is perpendicular to the field, Arguments will be given that in isotropic magnets with a half-integer spin the two magnetic ordering structures can be identified as different order parameters.

40|$|Very thick {{films of}} BiCrO_ 3 have been grown on a SrTiO_ 3 substrate, {{maintaining}} a tetragonal lattice up to thicknesses of 14, 000 Å. Assuming we can treat films of this thickness as bulk crystals, we first calculated the experimentally undetermined atomic positions within the unit cell with the measured lattice constant of the film, then relaxed the lattice constants {{along with the}} atomic positions. All the calculations result in an antiferroelectric crystal with the Pnma space group with noncollinear Bi displacements.

40|$|Many devices, {{for example}} {{contactors}} and solenoid actuated valves, rely on <b>ferromagnetic</b> <b>components</b> moving {{under the influence}} of electromagnetic force for their operation. The popularity of this technology {{stems from the fact that}} it is an elegant, cost effective and robust way to convert electrical energy into mechanical work. From a product design point of view it is very important to quantify the magnitude of the electromagnetic force and to predict the behaviour of <b>ferromagnetic</b> <b>components</b> {{under the influence of}} this force. In most cases these forces are estimated by means of first order calculations or Finite Element Methods. It is plausible, as this dissertation shows, that direct measurement can be used to replace or supplement theoretical methods to obtain these forces. However, limited previous work describing methods and techniques for the measurement of these electromagnetic forces, are available in the public domain. In general, prior work in this field [12] is very specialised and limited with respect to the range of forces that can be measured, and not easily adaptable to a product design environment. This thesis proposes a novel piece of equipment for the measurement of electromagnetic forces acting on <b>ferromagnetic</b> <b>components,</b> and a method to predict product performance based on these measurements. The measurement equipment, and product performance prediction, is described and evaluated for the case of low voltage hydraulic magnetic circuit breakers. Low voltage hydraulic magnetic circuit breakers are a particularly interesting subject as it contains one source of electromagnetic force acting on two <b>ferromagnetic</b> <b>components.</b> The two <b>ferromagnetic</b> <b>components</b> have different equations of motion, with dramatically different damping coefficients. A further complication in the operation of hydraulic magnetic circuit breakers is that these <b>ferromagnetic</b> <b>components</b> can move separately or simultaneously. The motion of the components is influenced by the magnitude of the applied electromagnetic force and their position relative to each other. Low voltage hydraulic magnetic circuit breaker performance is subject to the combined motion of these two <b>ferromagnetic</b> <b>components.</b> This work concludes that the method for measuring electromagnetic forces with the aim of predicting device performance is feasible, and that it produces good results where electromagnetic forces need to be known to high accuracies...|$|R

40|$|BiFeO_ 3 (BFO) shows both {{ferroelectricity}} {{and magnetic}} ordering {{at room temperature}} but its <b>ferromagnetic</b> <b>component,</b> {{which is due to}} spin canting, is negligible. Substitution of transition-metal atoms such as Co for Fe is known to enhance the <b>ferromagnetic</b> <b>component</b> in BFO. In order to reveal the origin of such magnetization enhancement, we performed soft x-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS) and soft x-ray magnetic circular dichroism (XMCD) studies of BiFe_ 1 -xCo_xO_ 3 (x = 0 to 0. 30) (BFCO) thin films grown on LaAlO_ 3 (001) substrates. The XAS results indicated that the Fe and Co ions are in the Fe^ 3 + and Co^ 3 + states. The XMCD results showed that the Fe ions show ferromagnetism while the Co ions are antiferromagnetic at room temperature. The XAS and XMCD measurements also revealed that part of the Fe^ 3 + ions are tetrahedrally co-ordinated by oxygen ions but that the XMCD signals of the octahedrally coordinated Fe^ 3 + ions increase with Co content. The results suggest that an impurity phase such as the ferrimagnetic γ-Fe_ 2 O_ 3 which exists at low Co concentration decreases with increasing Co concentration and that the <b>ferromagnetic</b> <b>component</b> of the Fe^ 3 + ion in the octrahedral crystal fields increases with Co concentration, probably reflecting the increased canting of the Fe^ 3 + ions.

The first order like magnetostructural distortion established in this material is found to result in a martensitic like scenario wherein the kinetic arrest controls the field/temperature dependence of physical properties such as heat capacity and magnetoresistance.

40|$|Interventional devices with <b>ferromagnetic</b> <b>components</b> can be {{manipulated}} remotely using forces induced by the MRI gradients. To deflect the tip of an endovascular catheter, large ferromagnetic spheres of 2 mm diameter are required to exert sufficiently high magnetic forces; however, tracking of these devices is difficult due to the large image artifacts. In this study, a new dual-echo technique is proposed to improve the stability of localizing and tracking medical devices with <b>ferromagnetic</b> <b>components.</b> MR tracking methods with selective off-resonant excitation and phase compensation with a rephasing gradient can detect ferromagnetic spheres up to a diameter of 1 mm only. In this work, a dual-echo technique is used with two rephasing gradients to stabilize the off-set localization. With rephasing being applied in orthogonal directions, an SNR of 5 was achieved in the signal projections. Compared to a single-echo acquisition the dual-echo method reduces the position error in a phantom from 8 mm to 1. 6 mm.

The profile samples of virgin dark-grey forest light-clayey soil {{derived from a}} siltstone of the Kazan layer of the Upper Permian and virgin leached medium-thick fertile light-clayey chernozem derived from a Quaternary heavy deluvial loam have been considered. Both soils are characterized by the accumulative type of magnetic susceptibility and F-factor values distribution patterns with depth. In the humus part of the soil profile, magnetics are present pre-dominantly in the < 2. 5 µm fraction. The coercivity spectra allowed to determine the contribution of dia-/paramagnetic and <b>ferromagnetic</b> <b>components</b> to magnetic susceptibility.

Using the method of thermomagnetic analysis of the < 2. 5 µm fraction, it has been found that the magnetic susceptibility enhancement in the profiles of forest-steppe soils took place due to the formation of maghemite-magnetite associations.

40|$|International audienceWe report {{complete}} {{information on}} a structural model (involving two perovskite phases with a slight different chemical composition and magnetic ordering temperatures) that is introduced in order to interpret powder neutron diffraction (PND) and magnetic measurement on Nd 0. 93 MnO 2. 96 manganites. The magnetic structure derived from PND data shows that the Mn magnetic sub-lattice for both phases become ordered below T-N = 80 K corresponding to a canted ferromagnet with a spin arrangement (Cx, Fy, 0). The Nd magnetic sub-lattice for both phases becomes polarized below T = 19 K having a unique <b>ferromagnetic</b> <b>component</b> parallel to the <b>ferromagnetic</b> <b>component</b> Fy of the Mn sub-lattice. Magnetic measurement can be interpreted considering that whereas the ferromagnetic components of Mn magnetic sub-lattice of both phases are antiferromagnetically coupled in the temperature range 19 - 80 K, {{they appear to be}} ferromagnetically coupled below 19 K.

40|$|<b>Ferromagnetic</b> <b>components</b> used in mechanical, {{automotive}} {{and civil}} engineering are mostly subject to high mechanical loads. Cracks, which may form during manufacture or in use, {{may lead to}} a complete failure of the component in the worst case. Flaw detection directly after the production or a regular inspection of the components (especially in civil engineering) is necessary. In industrial production of <b>ferromagnetic</b> <b>components</b> predominantly magnetic particle testing is used. This testing method is indeed nondestructive, but its implementation is associated with high personnel expenses. Automation of the process is {{complicated by the fact that}} the magnetic powder accumulates in any existing indents. This degrades the contrast and makes an automatic detection of the flaw indication more difficult. The automotive industry needs alternative testing methods for process-oriented crack detection. However, in civil engineering there is a lack of nondestructive testing methods for fracture detection and localization. Even if the critical areas are known, the construction currently has to be damaged to expose the elements which have to be tested. The probe-assisted magnetic flux leakage (MFL) testing method is used for the detection of cracks and fractures in ferromagnetic materials. The magnetic flux leakage testing uses the same physical principle as magnetic particle testing; in magnetized components an increased magnetic field strength (flux leakage) occurs at the crack mouth. Manual or manipulator-operated highly sensitive magnetic field sensors with or without contact to the test surface are suitable to detect the magnetic flux leakage. Sensor rows or matrices thereby enable rapid testing of complex components (e. g. gearing). The process can be fully automated and integrated into the production process.
