25|$|A {{plane mirror}} forms a virtual image {{positioned}} behind the mirror. Although {{the rays of}} light seem to come from behind the mirror, light from the source only exists in <b>front</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>mirror.</b> The image in a plane mirror is not magnified (that is, the image is {{the same size as}} the object) and appears to be as far behind the mirror as the object is in <b>front</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>mirror.</b>|$|E
25|$|For flat mirrors, {{the law of}} {{reflection}} implies that images of objects are upright and the same distance behind the mirror as the objects are in <b>front</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>mirror.</b> The image size {{is the same as}} the object size. The law also implies that mirror images are parity inverted, which we perceive as a left-right inversion. Images formed from reflection in two (or any even number of) mirrors are not parity inverted. Corner reflectors retroreflect light, producing reflected rays that travel back in the direction from which the incident rays came.|$|E

Beyoncé and the dancers perform a dance routine together, and soon she meets a man, who dances with her.

[...] The bridge starts, and the video moves to Beyoncé in a red room, where she and her dancers dance in short skirts, fishnets and black sparkling dresses.

500|$|The {{music video}} was principally at shot at Wrest Park in Bedfordshire and {{directed}} by Nez. It premiered on Channel 4 on 4 December 2008. It starts off with Allen singing from a caravan window, while a clothes line on the right has underwear and a teddybear hanging from it. As she exits, her clothes are revealed to be a smock dress with a big bow and high heels; upon returning through the caravan door, the interior changes {{to that of a}} luxurious mansion, in reality an English country estate. The chorus starts and she walks down the hall, surrounded by butlers, all making synchronised moves and starting a choreography with Allen. Afterwards, she climbs the stairs and the camera cuts to the next scene, where she is sitting down in <b>front</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>mirror</b> in an extravagant bedroom, with dresses, lamps, toys and cupcakes. The scene changes once again, with Allen walking into a room with giant, brightly coloured presents. They suddenly stand up, having two human legs, and begin to spin around, with the singer joining them. After descending the stairs and walking through the same hall she entered, she exits the estate, and the video takes down a darker, more serious tone, while the verse [...] "Forget about guns and forget ammunition/'Cause I'm killing them all on my own little mission/Now I'm not a saint but I'm not a sinner/Now everything is cool as long as I'm getting thinner" [...] is sung. The euphoric visual effects appear once again soon after, as the chorus takes place. Allen walks down the estate stairs, being surrounded by dancing balloons, hopping butlers and coloured fog. The camera zooms out showing the estate tied in a giant ribbon, but also grey, melancholic clouds, which contrast the cheerful party from before. Allen stated that she hoped the music video would convey parts of the song's sarcasm.|$|E
40|$|Visual stimuli and {{socialization}} influence exploratory behaviour in crayfish. <b>The</b> predominant components <b>of</b> spontaneous exploratory behaviour {{were determined by}} observing <b>the</b> activity <b>of</b> solitary adult crayfish (Procambarus clarkii) in a glass aquarium containing fresh water and no objects. Five distinct behaviours were observed: rearing up (climbing on the wall), turning around, cornering (facing the comer), backward walking, and crossing (crossing <b>the</b> midline <b>of</b> <b>the</b> aquarium). <b>The</b> frequency <b>of</b> rearing up, cornering and turning around decreased when reflection from the glass wall was blocked with black cardboard, black paint or non-reflective transparent plastic. In a tank containing mirrors {{on one side and}} non-reflective plastic on the other, crayfish cornered, reared up, and turned around more in <b>front</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>mirrors.</b> Socialization was necessary for crayfish to respond to the reflection. Crayfish that were housed in pairs for two weeks exhibited more rearing up, turning around and cornering in <b>front</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>mirrors</b> than in <b>the</b> non-reflective side. Crayfish isolated for two weeks did not show these differences. Socialized crayfish also exhibited more rearing up, turning around and cornering than did isolated crayfish. Thus, crayfish respond to visual stimuli provided by a glass tank, but the responds depends on socialization...|$|R

One day I opened a drawer and found amid the clutter, three Filmfare trophies. I dusted them and realized they were Meena Kumari's Filmfare trophies. I had never held a trophy and a Filmfare trophy was akin to the Oscar in India. There were big mirrors in the room. In the evenings I would come back and lock myself in the costume room and hold the trophies in <b>front</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>mirror,</b> acting how I would accept it if I were to receive it.

In an effort to cheer her up, Ullman, along with her sister, created and performed a nightly variety show on the windowsill in their mother's bedroom. “It was originally the Patti Ullman Show. So I’m a spin-off of my sister’s show, as she likes to point out.” In the show, Ullman would mimic neighbours, teachers, family members, and celebrities such as Julie Andrews and Édith Piaf. [...] "Some kids can play the piano or kick a football; I could just impersonate everyone." [...] She would also perform alone for herself after everyone had gone to bed. [...] "I'd stand in <b>front</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>mirror</b> and talk to myself until I fell asleep. I'd interview myself as women with problems. Women in documentaries who had three kids and chain-smoked and husbands in prison that hit them." [...] Her mother would eventually remarry to a man who Ullman has described as a maniac who drove a London taxi and had a son who stole. [...] "We weren't the Brady Bunch, let me tell you!" [...] The marriage brought an end to the children's late night antics. [...] "There was a new person in her bed now and I couldn't do my nightly performance anymore. I was nine years old and my show had been cancelled." [...] Alcoholism and domestic violence became a common occurrence in the household. The marriage also resulted in the family moving around the country, with Ullman attending numerous state schools. Her flair for mimicry helped with the transitions as her new classmates didn't take to her upper crust accent. [...] "I had to talk like them to avoid being beaten up." ...|$|E
