5|$|During one {{period of}} {{rotation}} for PSR B1937+21, there are two peaks observed, known as the pulse and interpulse. PSR B1937+21 is unusual among pulsars in that it occasionally produces pulses far brighter than an average pulse. Until 1995, the sole other pulsar known to produce giant pulses was the Crab pulsar, and by 2006, there were 11 pulsars that had been observed to produce giant pulses {{out of more than}} 1500 known pulsars. The giant pulses of PSR B1937+21 were first observed in 1984, shortly after its discovery, but difficulty in observing single pulses of PSR B1937+21 due to its fast period meant that the pulses were not studied <b>in</b> <b>more</b> <b>depth</b> until a decade after they were first observed. In more recent follow up observations, more giant pulses have been found. These giant pulses have been observed to occur at the trailing edge of both the pulse and interpulse. The duration of these giant pulses is short compared to the period of the pulsar, lasting on the order of 10 nanoseconds. The flux density of observed pulses is somewhat variable, but has been observed to be as high as 6.5 Wm−2Hz−1 (6.5 janskys). The brightness temperature of a pulse with such high flux density and such low duration exceeds 5 kelvins, making the pulses of PSR B1937+21 the brightest radio emission ever observed. PSR B1937+21 is intrinsically the most luminous millisecond pulsar. In addition to the radio pulses observed, pulses have been detected at x-ray wavelengths, which show the same pulse and interpulse pattern.|$|E

25|$|Set in {{the fictional}} town of Star City, California, The series Malcolm in the Middle {{is about a}} boy named Malcolm Wilkerson and his {{dysfunctional}} family. The show stars Frankie Muniz as Malcolm, the third of four and later five boys, his brothers, and their parents, Lois (Jane Kaczmarek) and Hal (Bryan Cranston). Their first child, Francis (Christopher Masterson), was sent away to military school, leaving his three younger brothers at home, Reese (Justin Berfield), Malcolm, and Dewey (Erik Per Sullivan) with Malcolm being the middle child still living at home. In season four, the character Jamie (James and Lukas Rodriguez) {{was added to the}} show as the fifth son of Hal & Lois. The show's early seasons centered on Malcolm dealing with the rigors of being an adolescent and enduring the eccentricities of his life. Later seasons gradually explored {{the other members of the}} family and their friends <b>in</b> <b>more</b> <b>depth,</b> including others such as Craig Feldspar, Lois' coworker at the Lucky Aide drugstore, Malcolm's friend Stevie Kenarban, and Stevie's dad Abe.|$|E

500|$|Reviewers quickly {{identified}} Killer7 as a cult {{game with}} limited appeal. IGN lamented that its experimental style was {{not conducive to}} high sales, naming it GameCube's Best Game No One Played in their 2005 awards. IGN's Casamassina later placed it fourth in his Top 10 Tuesday: Underrated and Underappreciated Games feature. Despite modest sales, Killer7s cult success prompted the development of remakes of Suda51's older Japan-only games, The Silver Case and Flower, Sun, and Rain. In 2007, Grasshopper Manufacture released Suda51's No More Heroes to critical and commercial success. In addition to an original soundtrack and comic book adaptation, Capcom published [...] Hand in killer7, a companion book that explains the plot <b>in</b> <b>more</b> <b>depth.</b> Kinetic Underground, the company that handled the comic book, also released a number of figurines depicting characters from the game.|$|E

In addition to poetry and prose fragments, Vinea was assigned a regular column about life in Bucharest. Joining them as a contributor on film and theater, Mihail Sorbul (also known as G.

Also published by Seara was the Symbolist George Bacovia, with poetry pieces such as [...] "Winter Lead", [...] "Autumn Nerves" [...] and [...] "Poem in the Mirror"—generally second editions, previously published in Noua Revistă Română and other reviews; they were later included in Bacovia's lionized collection Plumb.|$|E

Anderson describes the book <b>in</b> <b>more</b> <b>depth</b> in a footnote, calling it a complete and thorough academic reference book. He goes on to criticize the perspective of the book for describing and then rejecting objections by the United States to arguments addressed in the work. Anderson writes that the book is both one scholars must have to educate themselves on the subject, while simultaneously lamenting its advocacy for U.S. legal positions.

500|$|In 1980, Larkin {{was invited}} by the Poets' Audio Center, Washington, {{to record a}} {{selection}} of poems from {{the full range of}} his poetic output for publication on a Watershed Foundation cassette tape. The recording was made in February 1980 (at Larkin's own expense) by John Weeks, a sound engineer colleague from the University of Hull. Although negotiations between Larkin, his publishers and the Watershed Foundation collapsed, the recording (of Larkin reading 26 poems selected from his four canonical volumes of poetry) was sold – by Larkin – to Harvard University's Poetry Room [...] in 1981. In 2004, a copy of this recording was uncovered in the Hornsea garage studio of the engineer who had made the recording for Larkin. (Subsequently, Larkin's own copy of the recording was found in the Larkin Archive at the University of Hull) News of the “newly discovered” recording made the headlines in 2006, with extracts being broadcast in a Sky News report.
