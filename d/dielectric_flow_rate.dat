By understanding the material removal process behind near-dry EDM milling, its performance can further be improved using a machine with five degrees of freedom. Three major research areas are investigated: (1) effect of electrode orientation in five-axis milling, (2) the trajectory planning for five-axis near-dry EDM milling, and (3) a new gap control strategy for five-axis near-dry EDM process. Computational fluid dynamics (CFD) model is developed {{to predict the}} <b>dielectric</b> fluid <b>flow</b> <b>rate</b> for various electrode inclinations and qualitatively compared with the experimentally measured material removal rate. The study shows that the material removal rate is linearly proportional to the mass <b>flow</b> <b>rate</b> of air and kerosene mixture, the tool electrode wear ratio is inversely related to the mass <b>flow</b> <b>rate</b> {{of the air and}} kerosene mixture, and the average surface roughness is not correlated with the <b>flow</b> <b>rate</b> of the mixture.

Experimental verifications of the proposed path planning strategy yielded higher material removal rate compared with that of standard path planning. A new gap control strategy for five-axis near-dry EDM is proposed and experimentally investigated. The new gap controller retracts the electrode in the direction of electrode orientation.

30|$|Wire {{electrical}} {{discharge machining}} is a thermo-electrical process in which material is eroded from the workpiece {{through a series of}} discrete sparks occurring between the workpiece and the wire electrode (tool). The tool is separated by a thin film of dielectric fluid which is continuously fed to the area being machined in order to flush away the eroded particles. The movement of the wire is numerically controlled to achieve the desired three-dimensional shape and accuracy of the workpiece. The most important performance factors effecting WEDM are discharge current, pulse duration, pulse frequency, wire speed, wire tension, type of die electric fluid and <b>dielectric</b> <b>flow</b> <b>rate.</b> However, wire EDM owing a large number of variables and the stochastic nature of the process, even a highly trained operator will still find it difficult to attain an optimal processing and avoid wire breakage.|$|E

40|$|Wire {{electrical}} {{discharge machining}} (WEDM) is a specialized thermal machining process capable of accurately machining parts with varying hardness or complex shapes, which have sharp edges that {{are very difficult to}} be machined by the main stream machining processes. This practical technology of the WEDM process is based on the conventional EDM sparking phenomenon utilizing the widely accepted non-contact technique of material removal. Since the introduction of the process, WEDM has evolved from a simple means of making tools and dies to the best alternative of producing micro-scale parts with the highest degree of dimensional accuracy and surface finish quality.

30|$|Wire {{electric}} discharge machining (WEDM) process {{has opened a}} new swing in the manufacturing sector. Non-traditional machining processes changed the whole scenario of manufacturing industries. Traditional machining processes are rapidly replaced by non-traditional methods for achieving better production rates and quality. One of the successful methods is WEDM, {{which is based on}} the conventional {{electric discharge}} machining (EDM). The principle remains the same for WEDM as in conventional EDM, a thermo-electrical process. WEDM process involves the erosion effect by rapid repetitive and discrete spark discharges between the wire tool electrode and work piece in a liquid dielectric medium. Manufacturing the parts of high quality at high production efficiency is the main objective of WEDM process. Selecting the appropriate machining parameter for high quality product is very difficult. Much research is not found in the field of WEDM to find the optimum parameter; in the present research, GRA is used to find the response variable of WEDM. An attempt is made by Majhi et al. (2013) for the determination of the optimal process parameters material removal rate, surface roughness and tool wear rate for EDM process. Modelling and optimisation of WEDM were given by Kumar and Kumar (2013). To find the optimum surface roughness, they used to input parameters such as Time On, Time Off, Wire Speed and Wire Feed. Taguchi techniques have been used for optimisation of minimizing the SR. Due to multiple variables, an extremely trained operator with a modern WEDM is rarely to achieve the optimal performance. Pasam et al. (2010) conducted research to solve this problem to determine the relation among the responses and its parameter. The most important responses in WEDM are metal removal rate, workpiece’s surface finish, and kerf width. Discharge current, pulse duration, pulse frequency, wire speed, wire tension, and <b>dielectric</b> <b>flow</b> <b>rate</b> are some of the machining parameters which affect the responses. The gap between the wire and work piece is also an important in wire EDM and it usually ranges from 0.02 to 0.075  mm given by Mahapatra and Patnaik (2007). Taguchi-based Grey relational analysis, to find the optimal process parameter setting for multi-matrix composite using molybdenum wire of 0.18  mm diameter, as electrode is applied by Lal et al. (2015). Similar technique for optimisation was used by Shivade and Shinde (2014) for D 3 tool steel material. Nayak and Mahapatra (2016) applied an artificial neural network (ANN) model to determine the relationship between input parameters and performance characteristics for taper cutting of deep cryo-treated Inconel 718 with cryo-treated coated Bronco cut-W. In wire electrical discharge machining process 0.2 mm diameter wire electrode was used. Jaganathan et al. (2012) optimised the wire EDM parameter and responses MRR and surface finish for EN 31 is done by Taguchi L 27 orthogonal array (OA). Singha and Pradhan (2014) conducted experiment through Taguchi method and response surface methodology is applied to estimate the optimum machining condition within the experimental constraints. Varun and Venkaiah (2014) used an optimisation strategy by coupling Grey relational analysis (GRA) with genetic algorithm (GA) to optimise the response parameters. Experiments were conducted on EN- 353 work material to study the effects of input parameters. Zinc-coated copper wire with 0.25 mm diameter is used as an electrode. The response parameter such as material removal rate (MRR), the surface roughness (SR), and kerf width is observed. Saha and Mondal (2016) applied an optimisation technique combining Grey relational analysis with principal component analysis to identify the optimal combination of process parameters in WEDM for machining nanostructured hard facing materials. Sinha et al. (2015) used Taguchi method for single objective optimisation and then the signal-to-noise (S/N) ratios obtained from Taguchi method have been further used in principal component analysis (PCA) for multi-objective optimisation. Huang and Liao (2003) applied Grey relational analyses with L 18 mixed orthogonal array to determine the optimal selection of machining parameters for the wire electrical discharge machining process. Baig and Vankaiah (2001) applied Taguchi and Grey relation analysis to find the optimal parameter settings for WEDM for a nickel-based alloy.|$|E

Liao et al. (1997) established mathematical models relating the machining performances with various machining parameters, and then determined the optimal parametric settings for the WEDM processes using feasible-direction method of non-linear programining. Ahmad et al. (2001) studied machinability of aluminum matrix composite (AMC). The full factorial design of experimental approach with two levels {{were used to determine}} the combination of machining parameter based on pulse-off time, servo voltage and wire tension. They concluded that the servo voltages have significant influence on the MRR. Mahapatra and Patnaik (2006) established the relationship between various process parameters and responses using non-linear regression analysis and then employed genetic algorithm to optimize the WEDM process. Singh and Garg (2009) machined hot die steel (H- 11) on WEDM. They studied the effects of process parameters on MRR using one variable at a time approach. Finally conclude that by increasing the pulse on time the MRR also increases and vice versa. Jangra et al. (2011) investigated the Influence of taper angle, peak current, pulse-on time, pulse-off time, wire tension and <b>dielectric</b> <b>flow</b> <b>rate</b> for MRR and surface roughness during machining of WC–Co composite. In order to optimize MRR and surface roughness GRA is used along with Taguchi method. Durairaj et al. (2013) examined the effect of process parameters on surface roughness and kerf width on WEDM using SS 304. For experimentation Taguchi L 16 OA has been used. By using multi-objective optimization technique GRA theory, the optimal value is obtained for surface roughness and kerf width and by using Taguchi optimization technique, optimized value is obtained separately. Shivade and Shinde (2013) proposed different approaches which may also be quite useful for multi-objective optimization of WEDM processes. Chiang and Chang (2006) optimized the surface roughness and MRR of a WEDM process for Al 2 O 3 particle reinforced material based on GRA method. Ramakrishna and Karunamoorthy (2006) used multi-objective optimization method using Taguchi’s robust design approach for WEDM. Each experiment had been performed under different cutting conditions of pulse on time, wire tension, delay time, wire feed speed and ignition current intensity. Three responses, namely MRR, surface roughness and wire wear ratio had been considered. It was observed that the Taguchi’s parameter design is a simple, systematic, reliable and more efficient tool for optimization of the machining parameters. It was identified that the pulse on time and ignition current had influenced more than the other parameters. Sarkar et al. (2005) presented an approach to select the optimum cutting condition with an appropriate wire offset setting {{in order to get the}} desired surface roughness and dimensional accuracy for machining of γ-titanium aluminide alloy. The process has been modeled using additive model in order to predict the response parameters, i.e., cutting speed, surface roughness and dimensional deviation. Muthu et al. (2011) investigated experimentally the influence of the machining parameter on the kerf width, metal removal rate and the surface roughness of the machined workpiece surface using Taguchi method. Jangra et al. (2012) proposed integrated approach for multi-objective optimization for WC- 5.3  %Co composite on WEDM using Taguchi, GRA and entropy method. Hewidy et al. (2005) developed a mathematical model based on response surface methodology for correlating the relationships of various WEDM parameters of Inconel 601 material such as peak current, duty factor, wire tension and water pressure on the MRR, wear ratio and surface roughness. Rao and Pawar (2009) highlighted the development of mathematical models using response surface modeling for correlating the relationships of various WEDM parameters such as pulse on-time, pulse off-time, peak current, and servo feed setting on the machining speed and surface roughness. ABC algorithm was then applied to find the optimal combination of process parameters with an objective of achieving maximum machining speed for a desired value of surface finish. Datta and Mahapatra (2010) derived a quadratic mathematical model to represent the process behavior of WEDM operation. Experiments have been conducted with six process parameters: discharge current, pulse duration, pulse frequency, wire speed, wire tension and dielectric flow rate; to be varied in three different levels. Process responses such as Material Removal Rate, surface finish and kerf have been measured. These data have been utilized to fit a quadratic mathematical model (response surface model) for each of the responses.GRA has been adopted to convert this multi-objective criterion into an equivalent single objective function; Optimal setting has been verified through confirmatory test; showed good agreement to the predicted value. Kumar et al. (2013) investigated effect of various WEDM parameters on four response variables, i.e., machining rate, surface roughness, dimensional deviation and wire wear ratio on pure titanium (Grade- 2) using RSM. The experimental plan is based on Box–Behnken design. The six parameters, i.e., pulse on time, pulse off time, peak current, spark gap voltage, wire feed and wire tension have been varied to investigate their effect on output responses. The ANOVA has been applied to identify the significance of developed model. Shandilya et al. (2011) used a RSM and artificial neural network based mathematical modeling for average cutting speed of SiCp/ 6061 Al metal matrix composite during WEDM. Four WEDM parameters namely servo voltage, pulse-on time, pulse-off time and wire feed rate were chosen as machining process parameters. They developed a back propagation neural network to establish the process model. The performance of the developed artificial neural network models was compared with the RSM mathematical models of average cutting speed. Sharma et al. (2013) investigated the effect of parameters on metal removal rate for WEDM using high strength low alloy as work-piece and brass wire as electrode. They observed that material removal rate and surface roughness increase with increase in pulse on time and peak current. RSM is used to optimize the process parameter for Material removal rate and surface roughness. They developed a mathematical model which correlates the independent process parameters with the desired metal removal rate and Surface Roughness. The central composite rotatable design has been used to conduct the experiments.|$|E
