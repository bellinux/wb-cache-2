2500|$|Founded in 2006, Algenol Biofuels is a global, {{industrial}} biotechnology {{company that is}} commercializing its patented algae technology for production of ethanol and other fuels. [...] Based in Southwest Florida, Algenol's patented technology enables {{the production of the}} four most important fuels (ethanol, gasoline, jet, and diesel fuel) using proprietary algae, sunlight, carbon dioxide and saltwater for around $1.27 per gallon and at production levels of 8,000 total gallons of liquid fuel per acre per year. Algenol's technology produces high yields and relies on patented photobioreactors and proprietary downstream techniques for low-cost fuel production using carbon dioxide from industrial sources. The company originally intended on producing commercially by 2014, but was set back when Florida Governor Rick Scott signed a bill in 2013 eliminating the state's mandate of a minimum of 10% ethanol in commercial gasoline. This caused Algenol CEO Paul Woods to scrap a plan for a US $500 million plant to produce commercial amounts of algae biofuels and pursue other job sites. Currently, Algenol is a partner of the US Department of Energy's Bioenergy Technologies Office, and in 2015 began smaller-scale commercial sales of E15 and E85 ethanol blends to Protec Fuel, a Florida-based <b>fuel</b> <b>distributor.</b>|$|E

50|$|Fuel {{is pumped}} from the tank {{to a large}} control valve called a <b>fuel</b> <b>distributor,</b> which divides the single fuel supply line from the tank into smaller lines, one for each injector. The <b>fuel</b> <b>distributor</b> is mounted atop a control vane through which all intake air must pass, and the system works by varying fuel volume {{supplied}} to the injectors based on {{the angle of the}} air vane in the air flow meter, which in turn is determined by the volume of air passing the vane, and by the control pressure. The control pressure is regulated with a mechanical device called the control pressure regulator (CPR) or the warm-up regulator (WUR). Depending on the model, the CPR may be used to compensate for altitude, full load, and/or a cold engine. The injectors are simple spring-loaded check valves with nozzles; once fuel system pressure becomes high enough to overcome the counterspring, the injectors begin spraying.|$|E

The work conducted field interviews with 25 distribution companies, which account for approximately 80 % of domestic sales of gasoline and ethanol. The results suggest that the governance structures differ by asset specificity and that hybrid governances are the most frequent. The conclusions also indicate that the size of distributors is decisive in the choice of coordination mechanisms used and that the delay in enforcing contracts is the main cause of the emergence of complementary mechanisms, their use being primarily directed to the protection of specific assets in transactions...|$|R
40|$|This work {{studies the}} {{appearance}} of non exclusive fuel resaling firms, unbranded resale firms, which don't carry any connections to <b>fuel</b> <b>distributors.</b> In this sense, a simple strategic model was consolidated, in which the only asymmetric information relates to the contracts settled among unbranded resale firms and disbributors and branded resale firms and distributors. The model evaluates the strategic relations between the upstream and downstream sectors, considering a partial vertical relation, such that de branded resale firms bounded by contracts with the distributor, are integrated by an exclusive contract with the distributor. On the other hand, the unbranded resale firm continues with no vertical integration. Consequently, {{it is observed that}} the existence of unbranded resale firms in the market allows an optimal and lower price with larger supply in equilibrium. ...|$|R
