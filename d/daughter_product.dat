5|$|Even {{before the}} Hanford Site {{started up the}} B Reactor, {{the first of its}} three reactors, on September 15, 1944, Wheeler had been {{concerned}} that some nuclear fission products {{might turn out to be}} nuclear poisons, the accumulation of which would impede the ongoing nuclear chain reaction by absorbing many of the thermal neutrons that were needed to continue a chain reaction. In an April 1942 report, he predicted that this would reduce the reactivity by less than one percent so long as no fission product had a neutron capture cross section of more than 100,000 barns. After the reactor unexpectedly shut down, and then just as unexpectedly restarted about fifteen hours later, he suspected iodine-135, with a half life of 6.6 hours, and its <b>daughter</b> <b>product,</b> xenon-135, which has a half life of 9.2 hours. Xenon-135 turned out to have a neutron capture cross-section of well over 2 million barns. The problem was corrected by adding additional fuel rods to burn out the poison.|$|E
25|$|Tc-99m {{remained}} a scientific curiosity until the 1950s when Powell Richards realized {{the potential of}} technetium-99m as a medical radiotracer and promoted its use among the medical community. While Richards {{was in charge of}} the radioisotope production at the Hot Lab Division of the Brookhaven National Laboratory, Walter Tucker and Margaret Greene were working on how to improve the separation process purity of the short-lived eluted <b>daughter</b> <b>product</b> iodine-132 from tellurium-132, its 3.2-days parent, produced in the Brookhaven Graphite Research Reactor. They detected a trace contaminant which proved to be Tc-99m, which was coming from Mo-99 and was following tellurium in the chemistry of the separation process for other fission products. Based on the similarities between the chemistry of the tellurium-iodine parent-daughter pair, Tucker and Greene developed the first technetium-99m generator in 1958 (see photo of this generator at the beginning of the article). It was not until 1960 that Richards became the first to suggest the idea of using technetium as a medical tracer.|$|E

A widely applied {{method of}} {{supported}} lead estimation in sediments using gamma spectrometric 226 Ra determination via 222 Rn short lived <b>daughter</b> <b>products</b> relies on radioactive equilibrium between 226 Ra and 222 Rn being established after sealing the samples.

An equilibrium experiment was performed using test samples and in one case radioactive equilibrium was not reached.

Solid radon <b>daughter</b> <b>products</b> 214 Po and 218 Po transform by α-decay and influence measurement of radon volume activity in soil gas.

Experimental measurement demonstrates that both of applied filters have near {{the same effect on}} measured values of radon volume activity in soil gas. The difference between radon volume activity values got by measuring without filter and with filters is low, in order of measurement error. Experiment did not evidence necessity of using filter for measuring radon volume activity in soil gas. Radon volume activity measurement error is in order of several kBq. m- 3.
