50|$|This {{points to}} the major role trade credit {{insurance}} plays in facilitating international trade. Trade credit is offered by vendors to their customers {{as an alternative to}} prepayment or cash on <b>delivery</b> <b>terms,</b> providing time for the customer to generate income from sales to pay for the product or service. This requires the vendor to assume non-payment risk. In a local or domestic situation as well as in an export transaction, the risk increases when laws, customs communications and customer's reputation are not fully understood. In addition to increased risk of non-payment, international trade presents the problem of the time between product shipment and its availability for sale. The account receivable is like a loan and represents capital invested, and often borrowed, by the vendor. But this is not a secure asset until it is paid. If the customer's debt is credit insured the large, risky asset becomes more secure, like an insured building. This asset may then be viewed as collateral by lending institutions and a loan based upon it used to defray the expenses of the transaction and to produce more product. Trade credit insurance is, therefore, a trade finance tool.|$|E

40|$|Businesses are {{increasingly}} interested in improving their operations {{with the purpose}} of boosting company performance, which can be impacted through enhanced working capital management. Inventory management is one area that can help release working capital to other investments. In particular, the inventories in the end of supply chain are a potential phase for improvements, because these mostly tie up capital. In international trade, the commonly accepted trade terms, Incoterms, determine where the main risks and responsibilities are exchanged between the trade parties, and the companies can recognize their sales as revenue at this point. Therefore, one opportunity for decreasing the tied-up capital is to select the <b>delivery</b> <b>terms,</b> Incoterms, differently in the supply chain. The Incoterms are defectively studied in the academic literature, and there are {{only a small number of}} papers deepening the knowledge surrounding the topic. The relationship between the <b>delivery</b> <b>terms</b> and working capital management seems to be unobserved in these previous studies and hence this thesis examines if the amount of the goods-in-transit inventories is dependent on the <b>delivery</b> <b>terms</b> used in inter- and intra-organizational contracts. This thesis is conducted as a single case study and a mixed methods approach was selected as the applied research strategy as it enables reaching a wider perspective in the topic. The quantitative data describes the potential correlation between the choices of the <b>delivery</b> <b>terms</b> and the inventories, while the qualitative data from the interviews brings a practical approach to this research. The study found that the relation between the goods-in-transit inventories and the <b>delivery</b> <b>terms</b> was not significant, but rather the flow of information and the internal process reasons seemed to determine the inventory time in the case company...|$|E

Its use varies depending on business environments, countries and companies involved. The most common factors affecting the choice of <b>delivery</b> <b>terms</b> from Incoterms 2000 are volume/value of the consignment, control over delivery, common practice, legislation obstacles, etc. Countries participating in seafood trade have different practices in the use of terms of delivery that can be stipulated by various factors such as location of the country itself and its suppliers, economical and legal regulations, and others. Seafood importers in each country have a unique set of factors that are crucial for the choice of <b>delivery</b> <b>terms.</b> Accordingly, identifying these factors is important for understanding the relationships and the decision making processes in the exporter-importer dyads. Relationship quality may be also associated with the choice of Incoterms 2000, because it plays a significant role in decision making. This is especially important when the decisions concern risk distribution and risk transfer from the exporter to the importer in supply chains, in other words the choice of <b>delivery</b> <b>terms.</b> This paper deals with investigating the factors influencing the choice of terms of delivery in seafood export from Norway to Japan and Russia.
