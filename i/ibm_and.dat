50|$|The IBM 711 was a {{punched card}} reader {{used as a}} {{peripheral}} device for IBM mainframe vacuum tube computers and early transistorized computers. The 711's read mechanism {{was based on the}} <b>IBM</b> 402's <b>and</b> could read 150 cards per minute (250 cards per minute on the IBM 7090). Announced on May 21, 1952, it was first sold with the IBM 701. Later IBM computers that used it were the IBM 704, the <b>IBM</b> 709, <b>and</b> the transistorized <b>IBM</b> 7090 <b>and</b> 7094.

5000|$|While the IBM 7030 was not {{considered}} successful, it spawned many technologies incorporated in future machines that were highly successful. The Standard Modular System transistor logic {{was the basis for}} the IBM 7090 line of scientific computers, the <b>IBM</b> 7070 <b>and</b> 7080 business computers, the <b>IBM</b> 7040 <b>and</b> <b>IBM</b> 1400 lines, <b>and</b> the <b>IBM</b> 1620 small scientific computer; the 7030 used about [...] transistors. The IBM 7302 Model I Core Storage units were also used in the IBM 7090, <b>IBM</b> 7070 <b>and</b> <b>IBM</b> 7080.

5|$|Approval {{was given}} on 26 January 1973 for {{full-scale}} {{development of the}} AWACS system. To allow further development of the aircraft's systems, orders were placed for three preproduction aircraft, {{the first of which}} performed its maiden flight in February 1975. To save costs, the endurance requirements were relaxed, allowing the new aircraft to retain the four JT3D (US Military designation TF33) engines. <b>IBM</b> <b>and</b> Hazeltine were selected to develop the mission computer and display system. The IBM computer receiving the designation 4PI, and the software is written in JOVIAL. A Semi-Automatic Ground Environment (SAGE) or back-up interceptor control (BUIC) operator would immediately be at home with the track displays and tabular displays, but differences in symbology would create compatibility problems in tactical ground radar systems in Iceland, Europe, and Korea over Link-11 (TADIL-A).|$|E

Approximately 185,000 to 230,000 people use the Cascades Shopping Centre each week. Recent redevelopment has created new shopping areas, including the upmarket Gunwharf Quays—a redevelopment of the HMS Vernon naval shore establishment— containing fashion stores, restaurants, and a cinema, and the Historic Dockyard, which caters to the tourist sector and holds an annual Victorian Christmas market. Ocean Retail Park sits on the north-eastern side of Portsea Island and was built on land previously occupied by a Metal Box factory in September 1985.|$|E
