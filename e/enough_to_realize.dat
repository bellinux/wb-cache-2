[...] Ewing also compared the relationship between Spears and Blackout with American television series Twin Peaks, saying that what made the show [...] "so great wasn't the central good-girl-gone-bad story, it was the strangeness that story liberated.

Music critic Stephen Thomas Erlewine of allmusic {{notes that the}} song is narrated {{by a man who}} imagines a relationship with the woman he loves but is canny <b>enough</b> <b>to</b> <b>realize</b> that his daydreams are fiction, yet is overwhelmed by them. The lyrics capture his resignation to his fantasies. The song as a whole captures their full emotional effect on him. [...] The first two verses establish the theme and explore the narrator's daydreams, in which he and the object of his affections are lovers preparing to be married, to [...] "raise a family" [...] and build [...] "a cozy little home / out in the country / with two children, maybe three." [...] In the bridge, the narrator prays that he will never lose her love to another, or he will surely die." [...] By introducing this doubt, the musical bridge simultaneously bridges the movement from dream to reality, completed when the final lines shift from imagery to bald statement: [...] "But in reality / she doesn't even know me." [...] For Erlewine, [...] "the Temptations' performance has a dream-like quality, quietly drifting through the singer's hopes and desires." [...] We must add that just as the lyrics track the movement from dream to reality, the chorus goes on to anchor the drifting melody in a robust and highly memorable rhythm.|$|E

The jury foreman was Louis B. Seltzer, an editor of the Cleveland Press who had retired early in 1966. On August 9, 1966, the grand jury issued its 17-page report, blaming the riots on black nationalists and communist organizations. The grand jury reported that [...] "This jury finds that the outbreak of lawlessness and disorder was both organized, precipitated, and exploited by a relatively small group of trained and disciplined professionals of this business. They were aided and abetted willingly or otherwise by misguided people of all ages and colors, many of whom are avowed believers in violence and extremism, and some of whom are either members of, or officers in the Communist Party." [...] At a press conference on July 26, Seltzer stated, [...] "The grand jury saw <b>enough</b> <b>to</b> <b>realize</b> the violence was organized and planned because of specific targets singled out for burning and looting." [...] The report strongly praised the Cleveland Police for their courage and restraint during the crisis. [...] Although it issued no indictments, the grand jury specifically named Lewis G. Robinson, director of JFK House and organizer of the Medgar Evers Rifle Club; Harllel Jones, a city sewer department employee; and Albert D. Ware-Bey, a member of several clubs to which Robinson and Jones belonged. Chief Wagner said he was not surprised that no indictments were forthcoming, since Ohio lacked an anti-criminal syndicate law.|$|E

2500|$|Another {{speculation}} {{is that the}} separate worlds remain weakly coupled (e.g., by gravity) permitting [...] "communication between parallel universes". A possible test of this using quantum-optical equipment is described in a 1997 Foundations of Physics article by Rainer Plaga. It involves an isolated ion in an ion trap, a quantum measurement that would yield two parallel worlds (their difference just being in the detection of a single photon), and the excitation of the ion from {{only one of these}} worlds. If the excited ion can be detected from the other parallel universe, then this would constitute direct evidence in support of the many-worlds interpretation and would automatically exclude the orthodox, [...] "logical", and [...] "many-histories" [...] interpretations. The reason the ion is isolated is to make it not participate immediately in the decoherence which insulates the parallel world branches, therefore allowing it to act as a gateway between the two worlds, and if the measure apparatus could perform the measurements quickly enough before the gateway ion is decoupled then the test would succeed (with electronic computers the necessary time window between the two worlds would be in a time scale of milliseconds or nanoseconds, and if the measurements are taken by humans then a few seconds would still be enough). R. Plaga shows that macroscopic decoherence timescales are a possibility. The proposed test is based on technical equipment described in a 1993 Physical Review article by Itano et al. and R. Plaga says that this level of technology is <b>enough</b> <b>to</b> <b>realize</b> the proposed inter-world communication experiment. The necessary technology for precision measurements of single ions already exists since the 1970s, and the ion recommended for excitation is 199Hg+.
