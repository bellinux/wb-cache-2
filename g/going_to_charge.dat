25|$|Over {{the next}} couple of days the {{situation}} tensed. Several compromises were suggested from various parts but they were all rejected by the city council. At the same time the police were beginning to prepare for a final assault against the defenders. This plan involved breaking through the barricades with armoured bulldozers acquired from the military. Several units of police were then <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>charge</b> the squat, some of them armed with submachine guns. About 1500 police had been drafted in for the assault. The police commanders stated that this assault would most likely result in the death of several people.|$|E
25|$|When Dean becomes {{increasingly}} controlling over Roxy, Ronnie asks Linda's {{help to get}} rid of him. Linda turns her away, but her fiancé, Dean's brother Mick Carter (Danny Dyer), later visits Ronnie and agrees to help her. However, he cannot go through with the plan at the last minute. Dean and Roxy decide to move away, upsetting Ronnie, so she gets Billy to rob his salon. However, Dean realises she was behind it, so proposes to Roxy in front of Ronnie. She tries to pay him off to leave, but he realises she is recording their conversation, so plays it to Roxy at their engagement party. They argue, and Ronnie smashes up the Albert bar, before she tells her relative Billy Mitchell (Perry Fenwick) she is going to kill Dean. He warns Mick, and eventually Dean's parents Buster Briggs (Karl Howman) and Shirley, who arrive after Ronnie has given him a drink full of crushed up drugs. She reveals it was only a plan to scare him, but it is enough to make Roxy confess to Dean that Ronnie is a murderer, so he convinces Roxy to go to the police. Ronnie is seemingly arrested during a family dinner with the Mitchells. However, Ronnie realises they aren't police, and they drop her off in a wasteland, only for her to be picked up by Vincent. He tells her the police are <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>charge</b> her for Carl's murder, and she needs {{to get out of the}} country. She decides to confess to the police, but Vincent admits that he is a police informant, and Ronnie agrees to leave. However, Fatboy (Ricky Norwood) gives her a file he found in Vincent's safe, revealing he is working to take down the Mitchells. Vincent tries to blackmail her into framing Phil for drug trafficking, using a confession of her admitting to killing Carl. Phil, who has returned to drinking, disowns Ronnie, but she still protects him when Vincent plants a gun on him and calls the police. After, Ronnie destroys the copies of her confession and keeps the gun, threatening to kill Vincent if he threatens her again.|$|E
2500|$|While recuperating {{from his}} wounds, Hardin {{decided he wanted}} to settle down. After {{surrendering}} to Sheriff Reagan (brother of John Henninger Reagan) of Cherokee County, Texas, he was wounded in the right knee by an accidental gunshot from a nervous deputy. Hardin made a sick-bed surrender to authorities, handing over his guns to Sheriff Reagan and asking to be tried for his past crimes in order [...] "to clear the slate". However, when Hardin learned of how many murders Reagan was <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>charge</b> him with, he changed his mind. A relative smuggled a hacksaw to Hardin, who escaped after cutting through the bars of a prison window. In November 1872 Hardin escaped from the Gonzales County, Texas jail despite a guard of six men; a $100 reward was offered for his arrest.|$|E
5000|$|Do {{you think}} so? Good, you arrange things militarily; you {{take charge of}} that. For me, I'm <b>going</b> <b>to</b> take <b>charge</b> of eating {{vegetables}} and pumping oils. -Louis Charbonnier ...|$|R
6000|$|... "No, I have not!" [...] exclaimed Mr. Archibald, with animation. [...] "I {{have heard}} {{something}} about him, {{and before we}} start I should {{like to see the}} man who is <b>going</b> <b>to</b> take <b>charge</b> of us in camp." ...|$|R

6000|$|At {{that moment}} the surgeon came up. [...] "Are we <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>charge</b> again, major? because if so, these men, with the others badly wounded, had better be sent across at once to the infantry. There are too many of these Arab scoundrels about {{for them to be}} left behind here. But if we are not <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>charge</b> I will give their wounds a first {{dressing}} at once." ...|$|E
60|$|HECTOR. My good sir, {{you must}} work out your {{salvation}} at somebody else's expense. Nobody here is <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>charge</b> you.|$|E

The preferred high-mileage customer might commute 130 km each way {{between home and}} office. Lower distance customers might only need their home charging spot, with battery switching being infrequent.|$|R

6000|$|... "That {{reminds me}} of a {{question}} I was going to ask you," [...] Jacob went on. [...] "What price are we <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>charge</b> for the electric light?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{am going}} to swear out a warrant for your arrest," [...] Dorety {{answered}} quietly. [...] "I am <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>charge</b> you with murder, and I {{am going to}} see you hanged for it." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "It is {{all very}} well {{to talk about a}} charge; but how are you <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>charge</b> through the bush, where every step has to be cut? However, I suppose our fellows can get through as well as they can." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Mr. Vardon?" [...] {{she said}} interrogatively, {{as she held}} out her hand to the new tutor. Harry bowed assent. [...] "I'm glad you have such a lovely day to make your first {{acquaintance}} with Colyford. It's a pretty place, isn't it?

6000|$|... 'I am <b>going</b> <b>to</b> own {{my sister}} while {{yet there is}} time,' said Lucilla. 'While you are meditating how to make her a deserted outcast, death is more merciful.

I am <b>going</b> <b>to</b> take <b>charge</b> of her child, and stand by my brother.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Mother {{says you}} are <b>going</b> <b>to</b> take <b>charge</b> of my {{education}}, Stephen," [...] said Betty, {{as soon as}} she could speak. [...] "I'm glad, because I think that, for an old person, you have a good deal of sense.

6000|$|... "And I should tackle those fellows at once, if I were you," [...] Dauncey added. [...] "No good {{letting the}} matter drag on. Ask them what they're <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>charge.</b> Say {{that one or}} two of the tenants have been making enquiries." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "See!" [...] the boy interrupted, [...] "they are <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>charge</b> again.

Let us stop till we {{see the end of}} it." ...|$|E
60|$|With a mad cry of pain {{the bull}} backed out. At first I {{thought he was}} <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>charge</b> me again, but evidently the blow {{was too much for}} him, for with several moans he turned, and with his head hanging down, he {{staggered}} across the garden to the alley and disappeared.|$|E

6000|$|After {{giving this}} order he rode rapidly away, but {{returned}} {{in two or}} three minutes. [...] "We are not <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>charge</b> again, doctor," [...] he said; [...] "they are mustering too strongly for us to attempt it.

6000|$|... "He {{has sunk}} {{to the bottom}} of the pool," [...] Amuba replied. [...] "He gave me a start, I can tell you.

60|$|Will {{you let me}} {{see that}} volume of Gregory which {{contains}} the 'Christus Patiens'?
