5|$|Bradford City Association Football Club—also known informally as Bradford City—are an English {{football}} club founded in Bradford in 1903 {{to introduce the}} sport to the West Riding of Yorkshire, which until then had been almost entirely inclined towards rugby league. Before they <b>had</b> <b>even</b> played their first game, City were elected to the Football League to replace Doncaster Rovers in Division Two, and took over the Valley Parade stadium, which has been their permanent home ground ever since. The club won the Division Two title in 1908 and the FA Cup in 1911, both under the management of Peter O'Rourke, before they were relegated from Division One in 1921–22.|$|E
