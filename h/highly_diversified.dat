40|$|Genetic {{variability}} in a subdivided population under stabilizing and diversifying selection was investigated at three levels: neutral markers, QTL coding for a trait, and the trait itself. A quantitative model with additive effects {{was used to}} link genotypes to phenotypes. No physical linkage was introduced. Using an analytical approach, we compared the diversity within deme (H(S)) and the differentiation (F(ST)) at the QTL with the genetic variance within deme (V(W)) and the differentiation (Q(ST)) for the trait. The difference between F(ST) and Q(ST) was shown {{to depend on the}} relative amounts of covariance between QTL within and between demes. Simulations were used to study the effect of selection intensity, variance of optima among demes, and migration rate for an allogamous and predominantly selfing species. Contrasting dynamics of the genetic variability at markers, QTL, and trait were observed {{as a function of the}} level of gene flow and diversifying selection. The highest discrepancy among the three levels occurred under <b>highly</b> <b>diversifying</b> selection and high gene flow.

40|$|Abstract. Design of {{distributed}} architectures for content-based publish-subscribe (pub-sub) service networks {{has been}} a challenging problem. To best support the <b>highly</b> dynamic and <b>diversified</b> content-based pub-sub communication, we propose a new architectural design called MEDYM-Match-Early with DYnamic Multicast. MEDYM follows the End-to-End distributed system design principle. It decouples a pub-sub service into two functionalities: complex, application-specific matching at network edge, and simple, generic multicast routing in the network. This architecture achieves low computation cost in event matching and high network efficiency and flexibility in event routing. For higher scalability, we describe a novel approach to extend MEDYM to a hierarchy structure called H-MEDYM, which effectively balances the trade-off between event delivery efficiency and server states maintenance. We evaluate MEDYM and H-MEDYM using detailed simulations and real-world experiments, and compare them with major existing design approaches. Results show that MEDYM and H-MEDYM achieve high event delivery efficiency and system scalability, and their advantages are most prominent when user subscriptions are <b>highly</b> selective and <b>diversified...</b>|$|R

25|$|A {{defining}} {{characteristic of}} a modern economy is diversification and an advanced division of labor. By the mid-17th century under 40 percent {{of the labor force}} was employed in agriculture, whereas 30 percent was engaged in a <b>highly</b> <b>diversified</b> industrial sector, the balance of the labor force being engaged in commerce and other service industries. The numerous cities formed a complex web of interdependencies, with the lesser ports performing specialized functions to the major ones; the industrial towns specializing in specific types of production; the countryside becoming highly differentiated by agricultural specialization, with the villages evolving into service centers (or later sometimes centers of outsourced industrial production). However, the integration of specialized agriculture and industry with the growing entrepôt functions of the ports (at least before these functions became disaggregated again in the 18th century) imparted a special dynamism to the Dutch economy during the Golden Age economy.|$|E
25|$|Not all {{arable land}} in Greece was yet under {{cultivation}} in the Archaic period. Farms {{appear to have}} been small, cohesive units, concentrated near settlements. They were <b>highly</b> <b>diversified,</b> growing a wide variety of crops simultaneously, in order to make consistent use of human resources throughout the year and to ensure that the failure of any one crop was not too much of a disaster. Crop rotation was practiced, alternating between legumes and cereals (barley and durum), and the land was left fallow every other year. Alongside these, farmers cultivated vines, olives, fruit, and vegetables as cash crops for sale in local centres and abroad. Livestock were of secondary importance. Sheep and goats, in particular, were kept for meat, milk, wool, and fertiliser, but they were difficult to sustain and large herds were a sign of exceptional wealth. A team of oxen could increase agricultural output significantly, but were expensive to maintain. Horses and large herds of cattle were the preserve of the mega-rich.|$|E

40|$|Lactobacilli, {{the most}} {{commonly}} used probiotics, show strain specific immunostimulatory effects. The strain specificity is related to the structure of cell-wall components such as lipoteichoic acids (LTAs), ligands for TLR 2. In contrast, the role of exopolysaccharides (EPSs), the major components of lactobacilli biofilm, in the “cross-talk” between bacteria and the immune system is poorly documented. In this study, we have tested immunomodulating potential of lactobacilli derived EPSs, by their ability to modulate in vitro production of cytokines by murine peritoneal macrophages. We have examined EPSs of three lactobacilli strains (L. reuteri, L. johnsonii, L. animalis/murinus) isolated from colitic mice. The effect was compared with that of whole bacteria and LTA. All three nonviable Lactobacillus strains induced high amounts of cytokines with a strain specific profile. In contrast, the tested exopolysaccharides, exert low, albeit <b>highly</b> strain <b>diversified</b> stimulatory activities. The immunostimulatory potential of EPSs was correlated with the interaction strength between EPS and macrophage receptors as measured by atomic force spectroscopy...|$|R
