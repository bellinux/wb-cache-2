5|$|Grand Theft Auto clones allow {{players to}} freely explore the game world, which is {{typically}} {{on the scale}} of an entire city. Some games base their level design on real world cities, such as London, New York City, and Los Angeles. Players are usually able to navigate by vehicle or on foot. Some games put greater emphasis on leaping, climbing, and even swimming. Exploring the world is not just necessary to complete objectives, but also to gain valuable items, weapons, and vehicles. Different parts of the game world may be controlled by different enemy factions, who will attempt to stop the player in a variety of ways. However, more recent games in this genre allow players to acquire their own territory. The freedom of navigating a huge game world may be overwhelming or confusing for new players. Game designers <b>have</b> <b>come</b> <b>up</b> with a variety of navigational aids to solve this problem. A mini-map feature is common, while Saints Row and Grand Theft Auto IV {{go so far as to}} offer a GPS service. Games without these navigation tools are sometimes criticized as confusing.|$|E

25|$|In the {{principles}} and parameters theory, a head-directionality parameter is proposed {{as a way of}} classifying languages.

It is found, however, that very few, if any, languages are entirely one direction or the other.

Bread, produced in cottage bakeries, is available, as is locally grown and imported rice, although neither of these products is comparable to cassava in popularity.|$|E

25|$|As {{a part of}} the {{creation}} of the Seneca Niagara Casino in Niagara Falls, an agreement was reached to give a percentage of the slot machine revenue to the City of Niagara Falls each year to spend on local tourism projects and projects relating to hosting the casino. Money was allocated for 2003, but disputes <b>have</b> <b>come</b> <b>up</b> since then. Part of the dispute is a claim by Niagara County to receive a share of the money for county government projects and another part had to do with restructuring the local commission charged with allocating the money. Pataki has called for the money to be given to a state entity he created to spur economic development in Niagara Falls, thus leaving the money under his control, a decision that is opposed by local leaders.|$|E
25|$|Education {{institutions}} in Colombo {{have a long}} history. Colombo has many of the prominent {{public schools in the}} country, some of them government-owned and others private. Most of the prominent schools in the city date back to the 1800s when they were established during the British colonial rule, such as the Royal College Colombo established in 1835. Certain urban schools of Sri Lanka have some religious alignment; this is partly due to the influence of British who established Christian missionary schools. These include the Anglican, Bishop's College(1875); the Methodist, Wesley College Colombo (1874); the Buddhist, Ananda College (1886); the Muslim, Zahira College (1892); the St.Benedict's College (1985), the Catholic, St. Joseph's College (1896). The religious alignments do not affect the curriculum of the school except for the demographics of the student population. Colombo has many International Schools that <b>have</b> <b>come</b> <b>up</b> in the recent years.|$|E
25|$|The {{leader of}} Islington borough council, Margaret Hodge, had chaired {{the meeting of}} the Labour london boroughs in June 1984 at which the {{strategy}} of setting no rate had been decided upon, and according to Ken Livingstone, claimed to <b>have</b> <b>come</b> <b>up</b> with the idea. Hodge was one of the public leaders of the campaign and on the evening of Thursday 7 March the council organised a people's festival in the civic auditorium while the council formally voted not to set a rate. On 22 April the council published the results of an opinion poll it had commissioned which showed that 57% of people in Islington supported the council in the struggle, with 20% supporting the Government. Asked what the council should do, the poll found 37% wanted the council to continue not to set a rate, 27% wanted the council to resign and force an election on the issue, and 21% wanted the council to set a legal rate.|$|E

25|$|Classical {{figures have}} not {{discussed}} {{the subject as}} it has only {{come up in the}} 19th century. Contemporaries <b>have</b> <b>come</b> <b>up</b> with several distinct stances. One stance is that adaptation, or evolution on a micro scale, is accepted within a species, but cross-species evolution, that is evolution from one species into another species, is not as the human beginning is considered to be miraculous. However, this traditional thought would not conflict with the view that human-like beings could have been created around the same time as human beings, which, in this view, would explain the fossil records that look human but are not. Another stance is that since evolution is the simplest explanation it is the most reasonable to accept under the condition that it is not random but occurs only with the permission of God every step of the way. One particular argument that supports the idea that evolution is possible is the one stating that in that the stages of human development in evolution are akin to the distinct stages of development acknowledged in the Koran. The final stance completely rejects cross-species evolution across all organisms, but approves of adaptation (micro evolution).|$|E
25|$|The Akola MIDC Industrial Area is {{the largest}} and most {{economical}} industrial area in the division. It has four prominent industrial zones {{on the outskirts of the}} city. Cotton and jowar are the predominant crops grown in the district. Oil and dal mills are also rampant. The economy is mostly agriculture based. Nowadays, the soyabean crop is an important crop as major soyabean plants <b>have</b> <b>come</b> <b>up</b> in the area. The total land under Akola MIDC Industrial area is 6.25 km2. There are about 25 factories (3 large factories and 22 small factories) currently in production and another 10 small factories are in the process of being constructed. Maharashtra Government has sanctioned growth centres close to Akola MIDC area. An application of the Maharashtra Industrial Development Corporation (MIDC) for setting up an agro-processing Special Economic Zone (SEZ) in Akola district has been approved. Maharashtra State Seeds corporation (Mahabeej) has head office at Akola. There is a growing demand for setting up divisional MIDC office at Akola to cater to Akola, Washim and Buldhana districts which are away from the current divisional office and also lack good industrial growth.|$|E
25|$|A {{little before}} 5:00p.m. as the {{artillery}} fight began to wane, Confederate Brig. Gen. Charles S. Winder fell mortally wounded. He had been ill {{that day and}} was taken onto the field in an ambulance wagon. While attempting to direct his troops, {{he was struck by}} a shell fragment. Winder's left arm and side were torn to pieces, and he died a few hours later. As a result, command of the division devolved on William Taliaferro, who was completely ignorant of Jackson's battle plan. Dispositions on his part of the field were still incomplete; Garnett's brigade was isolated from the main Confederate line, with its flank dangerously exposed to the woods. The Stonewall Brigade was to <b>have</b> <b>come</b> <b>up</b> to support them, but remained a half mile distant behind the artillery. Before leadership could properly be restored to the division the Union attack began. Geary and Prince were sent against the Confederate right. The Federal advance was swift and threatened to break the Confederate line, prompting Early to come galloping to the front from Cedar Mountain where he was directing troop dispositions. Early's stabilizing presence and the raking fire of the Confederate guns halted the Union advance on the Confederate right. On the left Crawford attacked Winder's division, sending one brigade directly at the Confederate line and another brigade through the woods on a flanking movement. The Federals came from the woods directly into the flank of the 1st Virginia Infantry, who under the pressure from attack on two fronts broke for the rear. The Federals pushed on, not waiting to reform their lines, rolling through the outflanked 42nd Virginia until they found themselves in Taliaferro's and the artillery's rear. The Stonewall Brigade came up and was swept aside by Crawford's troops before it had a chance to react. Jackson ordered the batteries withdrawn before they were captured, but Taliaferro and Early's left were hit hard by the Union advance and threatened to break.|$|E
