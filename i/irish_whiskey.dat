5|$|Ireland once {{dominated}} the world's market for whiskey, producing 90% of the world's whiskey {{at the start}} of the 20th century. However, as a consequence of bootleggers during the prohibition in the United States (who sold poor-quality whiskey bearing Irish-sounding names thus eroding the pre-prohibition popularity for Irish brands) and tariffs on <b>Irish</b> <b>whiskey</b> across the British Empire during the Anglo-Irish Trade War of the 1930s, sales of <b>Irish</b> <b>whiskey</b> worldwide fell to a mere 2% by the mid-20th century. In 1953, an Irish government survey, found that 50 per cent of whiskey drinkers in the United States had never heard of <b>Irish</b> <b>whiskey.</b>|$|E

Alcoholic drinks associated with Ireland include Poitín and the world-famous Guinness, {{which is a}} dry stout that originated in the brewery of Arthur Guinness at St. James's Gate in Dublin. <b>Irish</b> <b>whiskey</b> is also popular throughout the country, and comes in various forms, including single malt, single grain and blended whiskey.|$|E
25|$|Originally {{one of the}} six main Dublin Whiskeys, Jameson is now {{distilled}} in Cork. In 2013, {{annual sales}} topped 4.7 million cases (56.4 million bottles). Jameson is by far the best selling <b>Irish</b> <b>whiskey</b> in the world, as it has been sold internationally since the early 19th century. The United States is the largest market for Jameson Whiskey, with consumption during 2013 up by 12%.|$|E
25|$|The John Jameson and Son <b>Irish</b> <b>Whiskey</b> {{company was}} {{formally}} established in 1810 when John Jameson {{and his son}} (also John Jameson) took ownership of the Bow Street Distillery in Dublin which had originally been built by his wife's cousins the Steins in 1780. Jameson was a Scottish lawyer from Alloa in Clackmannanshire who had married Margaret Haig, a sister of the Haig brothers who owned the Haig distilleries. Margaret Haig was a first cousin of the Steins, a Scottish distilling family, also from Clackmannanshire, with significant distilling interests in Scotland and Dublin. On his marriage to Margaret Haig in 1786, John Jameson moved with his new wife to Dublin to manage the Stein's Bow Street Distillery (which had been established in 1780) for Margaret's Stein uncle. This explains {{the use of the}} year 1780 in Jameson marketing as the Bow Street Distillery was where Jameson <b>Irish</b> <b>Whiskey</b> was born. Portraits of John and Margaret Jameson by Sir Henry Raeburn are {{in the collection of the}} National Gallery of Ireland.|$|E
50|$|In {{addition}} {{to the introduction of}} blended <b>whiskey,</b> and the <b>Irish</b> distillers failure to account for its appeal to changing tastes, {{there were a number of}} additional issues which placed further pressure on the Irish distillers: the Irish War of Independence, the subsequent civil war, and trade war with Britain (which cut off whiskey exports to Britain and all Commonwealth countries, then <b>Irish</b> <b>whiskey's</b> biggest market); prohibition in the United States (1920-1933), which severely curtailed exports to <b>Irish</b> <b>whiskey's</b> second biggest market; widespread counterfeiting of <b>Irish</b> <b>whiskeys</b> in America and Britain; protectionist policies introduced by the Irish Free State Government which significantly capped whiskey exports in the hope of taxing domestic consumption; and finally over-expansion and mismanagement at several Irish distilleries. Together, these factors greatly hampered exports and forced many distilleries into economic difficulties and out of business, and by the early 20th century, Scotland had surpassing Ireland to become the World's largest whiskey producer.|$|R
50|$|The {{distillery}} features both column stills and pot stills for distillation. Unlike {{most other}} <b>Irish</b> <b>whiskeys,</b> {{which are usually}} distilled three times, Cooley's products are generally distilled twice, as the third distillation is thought to {{remove some of the}} flavor components.|$|R
5000|$|Connemara — a peated single malt whiskey, Connemara is double-distilled {{rather than}} the more usual triple-distillation process that most <b>Irish</b> <b>whiskeys</b> undergo. It is aged in Bourbon casks. Several {{versions}} are found; single-cask, cask-strength, 12-year, and a high-peat version called [...] "Turf Mór." ...|$|R
25|$|According to Fitzpatrick, in 1963 while {{a teenage}} student at Gormanston College he worked {{a summer job}} at the Marine Hotel pub in Kilkee, the remote town of his mother's birth. One morning Che Guevara walked in with two Cubans and ordered an <b>Irish</b> <b>whiskey.</b> Fitzpatrick {{immediately}} recognized {{him because of his}} interest in the Cuban Revolution. Knowing about the Irish diaspora and history in Argentina, Fitzpatrick asked Che vaguely about his roots. Che told Fitzpatrick that his grandmother was Irish and that his great-grandmother, Isabel, was from Galway, with other family being from Cork.|$|E
25|$|Irish whiskeys are {{normally}} distilled three times, Cooley Distillery being the exception as they also double distill. Though traditionally distilled using pot stills, the column still is now {{used to produce}} grain whiskey for blends. By law, <b>Irish</b> <b>whiskey</b> must be produced in Ireland and aged in wooden casks {{for a period of}} no less than three years, although in practice it is usually three or four times that period. Unpeated malt is almost always used, the main exception being Connemara Peated Malt whiskey. There are several types of whiskey common to Ireland: single malt, single grain, blended whiskey and pure pot still whiskey.|$|E
25|$|As alchemy {{evolved into}} the science of chemistry, vessels called retorts became used for distillations. Both alembics and retorts are forms of {{glassware}} with long necks pointing to the side at a downward angle which acted as air-cooled condensers to condense the distillate and let it drip downward for collection. Later, copper alembics were invented. Riveted joints were often kept tight by using various mixtures, for instance a dough made of rye flour. These alembics often featured a cooling system around the beak, using cold water for instance, which made the condensation of alcohol more efficient. These were called pot stills. Today, the retorts and pot stills have been largely supplanted by more efficient distillation methods in most industrial processes. However, the pot still is still widely used for the elaboration of some fine alcohols such as cognac, Scotch whisky, <b>Irish</b> <b>whiskey,</b> tequila and some vodkas. Pot stills made of various materials (wood, clay, stainless steel) are also used by bootleggers in various countries. Small pot stills are also sold for the domestic production of flower water or essential oils.|$|E
50|$|These {{low wines}} {{can be further}} {{distilled}} a second time in a pot still to yield a distillate with a higher concentration of alcohol. In the case of many <b>Irish</b> <b>whiskeys,</b> the spirit is further distilled a third time. However, Cognac and most single malt scotch whiskys are only distilled twice.|$|R
50|$|A key {{attraction}} to the Rose and Crown is the selection of ales and stouts including Boddingtons, Bass, Harp, and Guinness (from the Republic of Ireland), as well as Stella Artois (despite being Belgian, {{it is one of}} the UK's most popular lagers). Also extremely popular is the selection of quality Scotch and <b>Irish</b> <b>whiskeys</b> served in the bar and restaurant.|$|R
50|$|In July 1975, {{operations}} ceased at the Old Midleton Distillery {{and began}} anew {{the next day}} at {{the next day at}} New Midleton Distillery, with the Jameson Bow Street Distillery and Powers John's Lane Distillery shutting a year later.

500|$|After turning {{ten years}} old, Stan was {{diagnosed}} with [...] "cynicism", which in the series is treated as a serious medical disorder where the sufferer sees nothing but feces instead of people and animals and hear flatulence noises during music and voices. Stan's friendships with the other main characters ended, his parents divorced and he moved out of his home. This episode formed a cliffhanger and set off widespread speculation that the series {{was coming to an}} end, but the premiere of {{the second half of the}} season resolved the arc as Stan was erroneously diagnosed with Asperger's syndrome and discovers Jameson <b>Irish</b> <b>Whiskey</b> cures cynicism. After struggling to repair his life, he finally explains he doesn't want things to go back to normal, when his parents get back together and his life is repaired, although the end of the episode implies Stan may be permanently bound to whiskey to continue an everyday life.|$|E

2500|$|<b>Irish</b> <b>whiskey</b> {{was once}} the most popular spirit in the world, though {{a long period of}} decline from the late 19th century to the late 20th century greatly damaged the industry. So much so that {{although}} Ireland boasted over 30 distilleries in the 1890s, a century later, this number had fallen to just three. However, <b>Irish</b> <b>whiskey</b> has seen a great resurgence in popularity since the late twentieth century, and has been the fastest growing spirit in the world every year since 1990. With exports growing by over 15% per annum in recent years, existing distilleries have been expanded and a number of new distilleries constructed. As of late 2016, Ireland now has sixteen distilleries in operation, with at least a further fourteen in the planning stages.
