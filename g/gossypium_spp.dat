40|$|In Peru the agro-export boom has {{determined}} {{a major shift}} of large farmers from traditional agro-industrial crops (coffee and cotton) to new agribusinesses (asparagus, oranges, avocados, apples). These dynamics have left room for the small farmers to enter the traditional agro-industrial sector, or into new niche markets {{as in the case}} of native cotton. On the North coast of Peru the cultivation of the native and naturally coloured cotton (<b>Gossypium</b> Barbadense <b>spp.</b> locally called algodón El País) is part of the Moche indigenous culture (a local pre-Inca population). Since 1949 the Peruvian legal prohibition to produce native cotton, linked to the risk of genetic contamination of the industrial white cotton cultivations, made the keeping of these traditional varieties very difficult. Nevertheless the situation has totally changed since 2008 due to Regulation n° 29224 declaring native cotton as a genetic, ethnic and cultural heritage of the country. This study analyses the economic feasibility of re-inserting the native cotton as part of the agricultural production of 50 farmers on the North coast of Peru, proposing a farm economic data analysis, scenario analysis and sensitivity analysis based on OFAT (One Factor at A Time) methodology: the results attest that in all the productive scenarios proposed (10 %, 25 % and 50 % of the farm agricultural surface growing native cotton) the average farm incomes are going to increase. Moreover the sensitivity analysis attests that also in the worst conditions of a 10 % decrease in the native cotton price, the average farm incomes with native cotton are higher compared to the business as usual scenario in all three productive scenarios proposed...|$|R
40|$|Three {{distinct}} plant viruses, {{transmitted by}} the tobacco whitefly Bemisia tabaci Genn., {{were associated with}} diseased food or fiber crops grown in the southwestern deserts of Arizona. The cotton leaf crumple virus (CLCV), thought to affect only cotton <b>Gossypium</b> (L.) <b>spp.,</b> is now known to infect other malvaceous plants {{and members of the}} Convolvulaceae and Leguminosae. Results of an experimental host range study suggest that potential virus-vector reservoirs may exist in cotton growing regions which include both weeds and cultivated plants. Geminivirus-like (GVL) particles of ∼ 18 x 30 nm were isolated for the first time from CLCV-infected bean, Phaseolus vulgaris (L.), 'Red Kidney', a plant which was a better purification host than cotton. Studies of CLCV-vector relationships indicated that the acquisition- and inoculation-access times, latent period and length of retention by whitefly vectors were {{similar to those of the}} original isolate reported in California in 1954. When growth chamber temperatures of 26, 32, and 37 C were used in virus-vector studies, optimal acquisition and transmission occurred at 32 C while temperatures of 37 C were lethal to whitefly adults. Two additional virus-like agents were isolated from single and mixed infections of lettuce or melons, respectively. The virus-like agent from lettuce infected primarily members of the Chenopodiaceae, Compositae and Cucurbitaceae, and was whitefly but not mechanically transmissible. Long flexuous closterovirus-like rods of ∼ 10 x 1400 - 2000 nm were visualized in extracts prepared from plants inoculated with the lettuce isolate. The isolate was similar to the lettuce infectious yellow virus (LIYV) based upon host range, transmission characteristics and unique particle morphology. Both long flexuous rods like those associated with the lettuce isolate and GVL particles of 18 x 30 nm were associated with diseased melons. The host range of the GVL agent was confined to the Cucurbitaceae and Leguminosae and the agent was separated from the mixed infection by mechanical transmission to a non-LIYV host. The GVL-agent was distinct from previously described cucurbit viruses including the squash leaf curl virus, based upon host range and transmission characteristics and was tentatively designated as the watermelon curly mottle virus (WCMV) ...|$|R

The rats from the VG cohort were injected with gossypol–BSA associated with Freund’s incomplete adjuvant, and the animals from the CG and CO groups were injected with saline solution. After 21 days, the rats from the VG and CG cohorts were treated with 30 mg/kg of gossypol by intraperitoneal injection, whereas the rats from the CO group received corn oil. After 24 h, the rats were evaluated for clinical signs of pathology, and their serum was biochemically analyzed.

40|$|Gossypol is a {{phenolic}} compound produced by pigment glands in cotton stems, leaves, seeds, and flower buds (<b>Gossypium</b> <b>spp.).</b> Cottonseed meal is {{a by-product of}} cotton that is used for animal feeding because it is rich in oil and proteins. However, gossypol toxicity limits cottonseed use in animal feed.

However, the most common toxic effects is the impairment of male and female reproduction. Another important toxic effect of gossypol is its interference with immune function, reducing an animal’s resistance to infections and impairing the efficiency of vaccines. Preventive procedures to limit gossypol toxicity involve treatment of the cottonseed product to reduce the concentration of free gossypol with the most common treatment being exposure to heat. However, free gossypol can be released from the bound form during digestion. Agronomic selection has produced cotton varieties devoid of glands producing gossypol, but these varieties are not normally grown because they are less productive and are more vulnerable to attacks by insects...|$|E

Nucleotide distance in non-coding regions was about three times that of coding regions. As expected, distances were smaller within than among genome groups. Phylogenetic topologies based on nucleotide and indel data support for the resolution of the 8 genome groups into 6 clades. Phylogenetic analysis of indel distribution among the 19 genomes demonstrates contrasting evolutionary dynamics in different clades, with a parallel genome downsizing in two genome groups and a biased accumulation of insertions in the clade containing the cultivated cottons leading to large (for Gossypium) chloroplast genomes. Divergence time estimates derived from the cpDNA sequence suggest that the major diploid clades had diverged approximately 10 to 11 million years ago. The complete nucleotide sequences of 6 cpDNA genomes are provided, offering a resource for cytonuclear studies in Gossypium...|$|E
