5|$|During {{development}} {{and construction of}} the park, many structures were added, redesigned or modified. These changes often resulted in budget increases. For example, the bandshell's proposed budget was $10.8million. When the elaborate, cantilevered Gehry design required extra pilings to be <b>driven</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> bedrock to support the added weight, {{the cost of the}} bandshell eventually spiraled to $60.3million. The cost of the park, as itemized in the following table, amounted to almost $500million.|$|E
5|$|In mid-1955, {{the tide}} {{turned against the}} various sects, as Prime Minister Ngô Đình Diệm of the State of Vietnam and his VNA began to {{consolidate}} their grip on the south.

5|$|Sprint was {{the primary}} weapon of Nike-X as {{originally}} conceived; {{it would have been}} placed in clusters around the targets being defended by the MAR system. Each missile was housed in an underground silo and was <b>driven</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> air before launch by a gas-powered piston. The missile was initially tracked by the local MSR, which would hand off tracking to the MAR as soon as it became visible. A transponder in the missile could respond to signals from either the MAR or MSR for accurate tracking.|$|E
5|$|When the Orange Line was {{originally}} constructed in 1977, foundations for the bridges {{to carry the}} Silver Line over I-66 to the median of the Dulles Access Road were built up to ground level. These foundations included steel piles that were <b>driven</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> ground and capped with concrete. However, detailed records for these original foundations were lost. As a result, engineers asked for the foundations to be inspected by digging around them to determine the condition of each pile under the concrete foundation caps.|$|E
5|$|As {{the novel}} progresses, Raskolnikov is {{introduced}} to the detective Porfiry, who begins to suspect him of the murder purely on psychological grounds. At the same time, a chaste relationship develops between Raskolnikov and Sonya. Sonya, though a prostitute, is full of Christian virtue and is only <b>driven</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> profession by her family's poverty. Meanwhile, Razumikhin and Raskolnikov manage to keep Dunya from continuing her relationship with Luzhin, whose true character is exposed to be conniving and base. At this point, Svidrigaïlov appears on the scene, having come from the province to Petersburg, almost solely to seek out Dunya. He reveals that his wife, Marfa Petrovna, is dead, {{and that he is}} willing to pay Dunya a vast sum of money in exchange for nothing. She, upon hearing the news, refuses flat out, suspecting him of treachery.|$|E

5|$|Brown faced a major prime-ministerial {{challenge}} {{two days}} after entering office, when two unexploded car bombs were discovered in London on 29 June. The following day, a car was <b>driven</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> entrance of the main terminal of Glasgow International Airport in a second apparent terrorist attack, causing a fire and considerable damage to the building. Brown was born in Glasgow, leading to speculation that the attacks were motivated against him. As a result of both the London and Glasgow incidents, Brown chaired emergency COBRA meetings to review plans to protect the British public. He also spoke to the First Minister of Scotland Alex Salmond regarding the incidents.|$|E
5|$|Buffalo's {{opponent}} in the 2008 MAC Championship Game would be the No.12-ranked Ball State Cardinals, who had gone undefeated in winning the MAC West. Ball State was a two-touchdown favorite entering the game; Buffalo in its history was 0–5 against the Cardinals. The Bulls struck first with a touchdown {{late in the first}} quarter; Ball State responded with a touchdown and a field goal in the second quarter to take a 10–7 lead at the half. The two teams traded touchdowns early in the third quarter. Disaster then struck for Ball State: on two consecutive possessions late in the third quarter, after having <b>driven</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> red zone, the Cardinals fumbled the ball. Buffalo returned both of these fumbles for touchdowns and took a lead they would not surrender. The Bulls won the game 42–24, earning their first-ever MAC Championship as well as their first-ever win over a ranked {{opponent in}} nine attempts.|$|E
5|$|Construction was of crossed wooden poles, <b>driven</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> {{waterlogged}} soil {{to support}} a walkway that consisted mainly of planks of oak, laid end-to-end. The track was used {{for a period of}} only around ten years and was then abandoned, probably due to rising water levels. Following its discovery in 1970, most of the track has been left in its original location, with active conservation measures taken, including a water pumping and distribution system to maintain the wood in its damp condition. Some of the track is stored at the British Museum and at the Museum of Somerset in Taunton. A reconstruction has been made on which visitors can walk, on the same line as the original in Shapwick Heath National Nature Reserve.|$|E

5|$|Himmler {{notified}} Fegelein by telegram on 1 August {{that the}} numbers killed were far too low. A few days later, Himmler issued regimental order no. 42, which called for all male Jews {{over the age of}} 14 to be killed. The women and children were to be <b>driven</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> swamps and drowned. Thus Fegelein's units were among the first in the Holocaust to wipe out entire Jewish communities. As the water in the swamps was too shallow and some areas had no swamps, it proved impractical to drown the women and children, so they were shot. Fegelein's final report on the operation, dated 18 September 1941, states that they killed 14,178 Jews, 1,001 partisans, 699 Red Army soldiers, with 830 prisoners taken and losses of 17 dead, 36 wounded, and 3 missing. The historian Henning Pieper estimates the actual number of Jews killed was closer to 23,700.|$|E
5|$|The lungs are {{the primary}} organs of the {{respiratory}} system in humans and many other animals including a few fish and some snails. In mammals and most other vertebrates, two lungs are located near the backbone {{on either side of}} the heart. Their function in the respiratory system is to extract oxygen from the atmosphere and transfer it into the bloodstream, and to release carbon dioxide from the bloodstream into the atmosphere, in a process of gas exchange. Respiration is driven by different muscular systems in different species. Mammals, reptiles and birds use their different muscles to support and foster breathing. In early tetrapods, air was <b>driven</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> lungs by the pharyngeal muscles via buccal pumping, a mechanism still seen in amphibians. In humans, the main muscle of respiration that drives breathing is the diaphragm. The lungs also provide airflow that makes vocal sounds including human speech possible.|$|E
5|$|These {{are used}} when the casting alloy {{cannot be used}} in hot-chamber machines; these include aluminium, zinc alloys with a large {{composition}} of aluminium, magnesium and copper. The process for these machines start with melting the metal in a separate furnace. Then a precise amount of molten metal is transported to the cold-chamber machine where it is fed into an unheated shot chamber (or injection cylinder). This shot is then <b>driven</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> die by a hydraulic or mechanical piston. The biggest disadvantage of this system is the slower cycle time due {{to the need to}} transfer the molten metal from the furnace to the cold-chamber machine.|$|E

5|$|Three {{attempts}} to sabotage the ship {{were discovered in}} 1904. On 31 March, rivets on the keel plates were found bored through. On 14 September, a 1⅜in (3.5cm) bolt was found <b>driven</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> launching way, where it protruded some 5in (11cm). Shortly after the Connecticut was launched on 29 September, a hole 1in (2.5cm) in diameter was discovered drilled through a ⅝in (1.6cm) steel keel plate. The ship's watertight compartments and pumps prevented her from sinking, and all damage was repaired. The incidents prompted the Navy to post armed guards at the shipyard, and an overnight watch was kept by a Navy tug manned by Marines who had orders to shoot to kill any unauthorized person attempting to approach the ship.|$|E
5|$|To {{eliminate}} the threat these isolated frigates posed, Hood ordered a squadron under Rear-Admiral John Gell {{to investigate the}} harbour at Genoa. The squadron arrived on 5 October and discovered Modeste and two smaller warships at anchor. Later in the day, three ships of the squadron launched their ship's boats and instigated a boarding action against the anchored ships, in defiance of Genoese neutrality. The French crews resisted, but the British boarding parties successfully captured all three vessels without suffering any casualties. Six days later the detached HMS Captain also seized the abandoned Impérieuse, which had fled to La Spezia. The action had strategic consequences: the Republican faction in Genoa was strong and they successfully barred Austrian reinforcements from sailing to join the Allied garrison at the developing Siege of Toulon. The outnumbered defenders of the port were overwhelmed and <b>driven</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> sea by a Republican assault on 17 December.|$|E
5|$|On 14 November 1991, Sihanouk {{returned}} to Cambodia {{to participate in}} the elections, followed by Son Senn, a Khmer Rouge official, who arrived a few days later to set up the organisation's electoral campaign office in Phnom Penh. On 27 November 1991, Khieu Samphan also {{returned to}} Cambodia on a flight from Bangkok; initially he had expected his arrival to be uneventful, but as soon as Khieu Samphan's flight landed at Pochentong Airport, he was met by an angry crowd which shouted insults and abuse at him. As Khieu Samphan was <b>driven</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> city, another crowd lined the route towards his office and threw objects at his car. As soon as he arrived at his office, Khieu Samphan entered and immediately telephoned the Chinese Government to save him. Shortly afterwards, an angry mob forced its way into the building, chased Khieu Samphan up the second floor and tried to hang him from a ceiling fan. Eventually, Khieu Samphan was able to escape from the building by a ladder with his face bloodied, and was immediately taken to Pochentong Airport, where he flew out of Cambodia. With the departure of Khieu Samphan, the Khmer Rouge’s participation in the election seemed doubtful.|$|E

The boom was connected to the radial anchor lines, which extended from the anchors at the island to the 610 specially made anchors, spaced at 15.3meter (50ft) intervals, 76meters (250ft) beyond the perimeter of each island, <b>driven</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> limestone {{at the bottom of the}} Bay. Earth anchors were <b>driven</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> land, near the foot of the trees, to secure the inland edge of the fabric, covering the surface of the beach and disappearing under the vegetation.|$|E
