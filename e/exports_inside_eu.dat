In order to analyze the level of real convergence <b>inside</b> <b>EU,</b> the concepts of σ and β convergence are used. I have taken into consideration the level of GDP/capita (PPS euro) for the member states, during 2000 - 2007.

40|$|This paper gives a {{quantitative}} assessment of possible trade and welfare effects resulting from different trade liberalization scenarios within the EU. First, we econometrically estimate the existing services trade barriers in the <b>EU</b> (<b>inside</b> the <b>EU</b> and {{with respect to the}} third countries). Then we run simulations to estimate effects of the currently achieved liberalization of cross-border trade in services <b>inside</b> the <b>EU,</b> and of the elimination of the remaining trade barriers. The simulations are based on the GTAP model, a computable general equilibrium model. We use the GTAP database V 7 (pre-release, benchmarked to 2004) and own estimates of protection in the services sector. Our findings point towards larger gains from more comprehensive cuts in trade barriers. We further observe a reinforcement of specialization patterns, with the new members intensifying their position as EuropeÕs manufacturing base and the old members specializing increasingly in services. trade restrictions, trade liberalization, computable general equilibrium modelling, services trade. ...|$|R

The author also {{emphasizes the importance of}} specific psychological-cultural aspects of an ongoing “Islamic-Christian” discourse both <b>inside</b> <b>EU</b> and beyond its borders, noting that in the specific case of Turkey, psychological-cultural issues are most likely to turn into serious security concerns...|$|R
40|$|The main {{objective}} of this report is to evaluate the employment effects <b>inside</b> <b>EU</b> based on supply of seafood products from Norway. Based on available statistical data we find that Norway accounts for approx. 10 % of the total resource base for the EU fish processing sector.   This gives a direct employment effect of 12. 000 FTE (Full Time Equivalents). Additional the spin-off effects of Norwegian seafood export to related industries within EU summaries to 8. 600 FTE. In total we conclude the employment effect of Norwegian seafood to EU to 20. 600 FTE based on data for 2011.

These asymmetric fluxes are represented according to the AATM in (Fig.  1 A).

30|$|These results {{indicated}} that depending on the subregion, {{the origin of the}} imports can have a positive or negative effect on the sophistication level of the machinery <b>exports</b> <b>inside</b> Latin America. In general, imports from EA and the ROW had positive effects, while imports from North America and China had negative impacts. However, when we consider all Latin American countries, we verify positive contributions from North American imports. The results indicate {{that in the case of}} imports from China, the effect on the intra-bloc exports sophistication level were not positive as expected, revealing that its exports to Latin America were still composed of cheaper and less sophisticated parts and components. The exception is in the specific case of electric machinery, where imports from China increased the sophistication of the intra-bloc exports of parts and components.|$|R

40|$|AbstractThe {{main purpose}} of the paper is {{analytical}} research of taxation of hybrid instruments in context of the EU parent-subsidiary directive. Efforts to harmonize taxation <b>inside</b> <b>EU</b> created negative side effects, which were unforeseen. The taxation of hybrid instruments became of the great importance as it created possibilities for development of schemes inside cross-border groups, which are somewhere in between of tax avoidance and tax evasion. This situation was recognized and the EU parent-subsidiary directive was amended in the year 2014. Member states are required to transpose amendments to national law {{by the end of}} the year 2015. Possible problems of implementation of amendments are presented on the example of Lithuania. Lithuanian local GAAP were too simplified in case of hybrid instruments and ways of adopting the Lithuanian legal system to the requirements of the amended EU directive are highly uncertain...|$|R

An other more critical approach has been developed in a long debate inside UN institutions and tend {{to take into consideration}} threats multipliers and threat minimizers. The paper conclusion deals with some questions arising from the document analysis and the recognition in this recent debate of a classic confrontation between a maltusian (deterministic) approach and a developmental (or possibilistic) approach...|$|R

40|$|Every {{country has}} adopted a certain law pattern. This {{has an impact on}} the {{language}} expression and the relevant adopted terminology. It can be tracked by examining and describing the lexical choices and the use of featuring structures, which form parallelisms in similar systems. Before proceeding with their linguistic description, it is necessary to explain the differences that exist between Greek-, French-, German-, Albanian law systems. It will be evident that they have some points in common, {{but at the same time}} they differ at a great extent in the way of conceptualizing the system. I shall use the Constitution as the basic law and a safe reference point for an explicit comparison. Terminology plays an important role in explaining these systems. The law & language are interactive patterns. We already have a European legal language, but it is time for a more coherent European wide legal language. The linguistic matters have a direct contact with judicial cases. <b>Inside</b> <b>EU</b> the usage of different languages is one of the main obstacles of the integration process. Then again according to EU it creates a specific problem for the European judges, translators and interpreters. So in order to achieve a co-usage of the language we need to develop a curriculum, in order to use a coherent terminology and linguistic patterns. To put a standard for the law language, used in the EU, we should follow a legal harmonization that is achieved through harmonized terminology <b>inside</b> <b>EU.</b> The right usage of the language and its terminology should be understood as a standardization process. Also European Union policy is of great importance because it informs us about language policy and how to deal with it. At last we must know that EU consists of 450 million people from different cultures and backgrounds. In this sense it can be said that EU is truly a multilingual institution that reinforces the ideal of a single community with different languages and different cultures...|$|R

40|$|The paper {{starts from}} the {{hypothesis}} that the viability of emerging territorial units depends on the way their members reach a converging approach towards issues of common concern. Based on previous results, we rank ten selected cross-border cooperation structures (CBCS) according to their institutional strength as a measure of assessment of their viability as polity. Data are then collected for each CBCS for three areas of cooperation, i. e. economy, society, and environment, in the form of policy documents. The analysis uses text mining techniques to explore the content of documents on each selected region and on each areas of cooperation. The results are further explored inside a thematic mapping of clusters, which is analysed through content analysis. The goal is to investigate and assess what is the cross-border cooperation level of policy convergence <b>inside</b> <b>EU</b> selected case studies, based on the emerging themes...|$|R

40|$|AbstractThe global {{financial}} crisis has affected almost all {{countries in the}} world. The crisis has hit European economies unprecedentedly hard and its effects have occurred in two phases. The first phase is the economic recession following the global economic downturn. The second phase is the so-called sovereign debt crisis which started in Greece firstly and then appeared in Ireland and Portugal. Like many other countries and organizations, European Union (EU) has also developed strategies in order to tackle {{the challenges of the}} crisis. This paper attempted to investigate the strategic initiatives of EU for the economic recovery in Europe. The results of this investigation show that EU's recovery strategies have been executed in two ways: the preservation of Member States’ financial stability and the enhancement of economic governance <b>inside</b> <b>EU.</b> Nevertheless the lack of a political union, in particular the supranational governance of economy policy is delaying the recovery of the EU's economy and causing the contagion of sovereign debt problems in Member States of euro...|$|R
