It allows quantified examination of a notion that formerly could only be described with adjectives. Quantification of these properties is of great importance to those whose work is color critical.

25|$|This IPL {{concept is}} <b>device</b> <b>independent.</b> It {{is capable of}} IPL-ing from a card deck, from a {{magnetic}} tape, or from a hard disk. For this purpose, the normal X'02' command, which is simulated by the CPU, is taken to be a standard sequential read command on card and tape media (which are inherently sequential access in nature), but a special Read-IPL command on hard disks (which are inherently random access in nature; hard disks use a related, but different, read-type command, X'06', and others, for sequential, non-IPL reads).|$|E
25|$|Hard disk {{controllers}} (IBM 2844, 3830, among others, and compatibles) {{accept the}} X'02' command, but first cause a seek to cylinder X'0000', and head X'0000', and {{a search for}} record X'01', before executing the sequential read command {{as if it was}} a X'06'. Without this special hard disk controller behavior, <b>device</b> <b>independent</b> IPL would not be possible. On a hard drive, the IPL Text is contained on cylinder X'0000', track X'0000', and block X'01' (24 bytes), and cylinder X'0000', track X'0000', and block X'02' (fairly large, certainly somewhat more than 3,000 bytes). The volume label is always contained on cylinder X'0000', track X'0000', and block X'03' (80 bytes). The volume label always points to the VTOC, with a pointer of the form HHHH (that is, the VTOC must reside within the first 65,536 tracks). The VTOC's Format 4 DSCB defines the extent (size) of the VTOC, so the volume label only needs a pointer to the first track in the VTOC's extent, and as the Format 4 DSCB, which describes the VTOC, is always the very first DSCB in the VTOC, HHHH also points to the Format 4 DSCB.|$|E

2500|$|This {{might be}} in a file myfile.tex, as [...]tex is a common file {{extension}} for plain TeX files. By default, everything that follows a percent sign on a line is a comment, ignored by TeX. Running TeX on this file (for example, by typing texmyfile.tex in a command-line interpreter, or by calling it from a graphical user interface) will create an output file called myfile.dvi, representing the content of the page in a <b>device</b> <b>independent</b> format (DVI). A DVI file could then either be viewed on screen or converted to a suitable format for any of the various printers for which a device driver existed (printer support was generally not an operating system feature at the time that TeX was created). Knuth has said that there is nothing inherent in TeX that requires DVI as the output format, and later versions of TeX, notably pdfTeX, XeTeX and LuaTeX, all support output directly to PDF.|$|E

After exploring special device boot modes and Android’s partitioning schema we detail the composition of an Android bootable image and discuss the creation of such an image designed for forensic collection. The major contribution of this paper is a general process for data collection of Android devices and related results of experiments carried out on several specific devices...|$|R

By modifying the etching conditions equi-concentration lines covering more than four orders of magnitude of concentrations can be made visible.
