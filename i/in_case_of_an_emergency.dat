5|$|Landing the {{aircraft}} required {{the extension of}} the retractable landing skid and the deployment of a braking drogue parachute. As pilots could access the plane only from a hatch above the cockpit, the pilot would have to enter the E.381 before it could be attached to the carrier Ar 234C and had no way to escape <b>in</b> <b>case</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> <b>emergency,</b> while attached to the carrier.|$|E

5|$|To enable spacewalks, Salyut 6 was {{equipped}} with an inward-opening EVA hatch {{on the side of}} the forward transfer compartment, which could be used as an airlock in a similar way to the system used on Salyut 4. This compartment contained two new semi-rigid spacesuits which allowed much greater flexibility than earlier suits, and could be donned within five minutes <b>in</b> <b>case</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> <b>emergency.</b> Finally, the station offered considerable improvements in living conditions over previous outposts, with machinery being soundproofed, the crews being provided with designated 'cots' for sleeping and the equipping of the station with a shower and extensive gymnasium.|$|E

25|$|<b>In</b> <b>case</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> <b>emergency</b> in the {{condition}} of a particular road, men of influence and liberality were appointed, or voluntarily acted, as curatores or temporary commissioners to superintend the work of repair. The dignity attached to such a curatorship is attested by a passage of Cicero. Among those who performed this duty in connection with particular roads was Julius Caesar, who became curator (67 BC) of the Via Appia, and spent his own money liberally upon it. Certain persons appear also to have acted alone and taken responsibility for certain roads.|$|E
25|$|Since 1948, the Dutch {{police forces}} have had {{different}} forms of voluntary police officers. In 1948, shortly after WWII, the Reserve Police was established. First, their job was to 'come into service' <b>in</b> <b>case</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> <b>emergency.</b> With World War II {{only a few years}} behind the country, this seemed a very logical choice. The Reserve Police, as it was called from 1948 until 1994, consisted of men (and later women) who worked as fully armed and equipped police officers. Similar to their full-time colleagues they were equipped with a pistol, short baton, and handcuffs.|$|E
25|$|The Klapmeier brothers, Alan Lee Klapmeier (born October 6, 1958) and Dale Edward Klapmeier (born July 2, 1961), are American {{aircraft}} designers, aviation businessmen, {{and entrepreneurs}} who together founded the Cirrus Aircraft Corporation in 1984. Under {{the leadership of}} the Klapmeiers, Cirrus was the first aircraft manufacturer to install a whole-plane parachute recovery system as a standard on all its models—designed to lower the airplane (and occupants) safely to the ground <b>in</b> <b>case</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> <b>emergency.</b> The device is attributed with saving over 140 lives to date. Cirrus was also the first to use all-composite airframe construction and glass panel cockpits on production aircraft, which many say revolutionized general aviation for light aircraft pilots.|$|E

25|$|The {{fundamental}} {{decision in}} choice of cylinders {{is whether the}} entire gas supply for the dive is to be carried in one set, or is to be divided into more than one set for {{different parts of the}} dive. Diving with a single cylinder is logistically simple, and makes all the gas available for breathing throughout the dive, but can not take advantage of optimising the breathing gas for decompression, or having an independent emergency supply that does not rely on the presence of a dive buddy where and when needed. A single cylinder puts the diver in a position of dependence on the buddy for alternative breathing gas <b>in</b> <b>case</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> <b>emergency</b> cutting off the main air supply, unless the option of a free ascent is acceptable.|$|E
25|$|The {{threat of}} a {{sustained}} high altitude campaign by the Luftwaffe did not materialise and only 100 of the Mk VIs were built by Supermarine. Only two units, 124 Squadron and 616 Squadron, were fully equipped with this version, although several other units used them in small numbers as a stop-gap. More often than not, the Spitfire VIs were used at lower altitudes where it was outperformed by conventional Spitfires. At high altitudes {{it was discovered that}} modified Spitfire Vs could perform almost as well as the Mk VI. At low levels, especially, pilots were often forced to fly with the canopy removed because the cockpit would get uncomfortably hot and they were not confident {{it would be possible to}} jettison the canopy <b>in</b> <b>case</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> <b>emergency.</b>|$|E
25|$|A further unique {{feature of}} heavy-water {{moderation}} is the greater {{stability of the}} chain reaction. This {{is due to the}} relatively low binding energy of the deuterium nucleus (2.2 MeV), leading to some energetic neutrons and especially gamma rays breaking the deuterium nuclei apart to produce extra neutrons. Both gammas produced directly by fission and by the decay of fission fragments have enough energy, and the half-lives of the fission fragments range from seconds to hours or even years. The slow response of these gamma-generated neutrons delays the response of the reactor and gives the operators extra time <b>in</b> <b>case</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> <b>emergency.</b> Since gamma rays travel for meters through water, an increased rate of chain reaction {{in one part of the}} reactor will produce a response from the rest of the reactor, allowing various negative feedbacks to stabilize the reaction.|$|E

25|$|Henry Clay Frick led a {{group of}} speculators, {{including}} Benjamin Ruff, from Pittsburgh to purchase the abandoned reservoir, modify it, and convert it into a private resort lake for their wealthy associates. Many were connected through business and social links to Carnegie Steel. Development included lowering the dam to make its top wide {{enough to hold a}} road, and putting a fish screen in the spillway (the screen also trapped debris). These alterations are thought to have increased the vulnerability of the dam. Moreover, a system of relief pipes and valves, a feature of the original dam, previously sold off for scrap, was not replaced, so the club had no way of lowering the water level in the lake <b>in</b> <b>case</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> <b>emergency.</b> The members built cottages and a clubhouse to create the South Fork Fishing and Hunting Club, an exclusive and private mountain retreat. Membership grew to include more than 50 wealthy Pittsburgh steel, coal, and railroad industrialists.|$|E
25|$|Police {{used to have}} blue-colored {{emergency}} lights {{but after}} a recent restock of vehicles, now the use of both blue and red color is usual. Fire Departments make use of red only emergency light while ambulances either use red or both colors. Regulation also states that the Military as well as vehicles carrying politicians can make use of a single rotating blue light at the roof. Every other individual and/or company may use yellow lights for either warning or emergency. Special groups like Emergency Response teams and agents may also include emergency lights on their private vehicles <b>in</b> <b>case</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> <b>emergency</b> when not in active duty. All utility vehicles such as construction related, tow trucks must be equipped with a yellow-colored emergency light bar on the top, clearly visible from {{the front and rear}} side.

25|$|From {{the outside}} it is {{difficult}} to differentiate between the first three types of LRVs. There are, however, distinct features that one can use to tell them apart; Phase III LRVs still retain their original green electronic displays while all other LRVs have new orange electronic displays. Phase I cars also have a wide window at the rear that can be opened <b>in</b> <b>case</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> <b>emergency,</b> while Phase II cars have a door at the back. The interior of the phase three cars has a greenish look and the doors are also green. The Phase IV LRVs have a completely different appearance in contrast to the older phase. It has a white exterior livery with olive green and purple line on the side. The shape of the front of the LRV is more streamlined than the older phases. The door opening and closing mechanism was similar to the ones from the K-class cars used in the Tseung Kwan O line and Tung Chung line. The Phase IV has 3 surveillance cameras in each vehicle. Seat belts and wheelchair positions were also available in the Phase IV. On older-generation LRVs there is a poach seat but the Phase IVs do not maintain this feature. The Phase IV LRV has orange electronic display. The refurbished Phase I LRVs have rounded rectangular windows while Phase IV LRVs have square ones.|$|E
