Surgeons then removed a grapefruit-size tumor from his intestines and discovered he had colon cancer. In a letter to ministers, dated September 6, Tkach {{announced that he was}} also diagnosed with bone cancer. He elected not to undertake radiation treatments. As Armstrong had done before him, Tkach named a successor to become pastor general in the event of his death. In that case, it was Tkach's son, Joseph Tkach Jr.|$|E
5|$|Chopra {{also had}} to learn jazz dance {{for one of the}} characters. For another song {{featuring}} all twelve characters, Chopra had to shoot for 22 hours to keep the continuity of the whole musical sequence. She had to change the costumes and makeup for each of the twelve characters while filming the song. At one point, Chopra fainted on the set and Gowariker wanted to postpone the filming, but she insisted on finishing the scenes. Her heavy workloadfilming for several productions, travelling for endorsements, and performing at live showstook its toll; she was admitted to <b>hospital</b> <b>because</b> of exhaustion and was kept under observation. After spending three days in hospital, she was discharged and immediately resumed filming to avoid delaying her other projects. Filming was completed by the first week of May 2009.|$|E
5|$|On {{the night}} of Tommy's fight with Kane, Tommy and Marty plan to force Kane to exhaust himself {{pursuing}} Tommy until the seventh round and then put him away. The plan works and Tommy knocks out Kane in round seven. After the fight Marty plans to take everyone out for a celebratory dinner but Bob Silver (Paul Raci), a big-time promoter, has watched the fight and, impressed, invites them all out. Marty declines and goes home, but later that night is taken to the hospital. Tommy rushes {{to the hospital and}} finds Diane there. He asks if Marty is in the <b>hospital</b> <b>because</b> of what happened at the cabin. Diane tells him that when Marty was a fighter, people threatened to expose Marty's homosexuality, so he ended his career by putting his hand through a window and damaging it. He became a teacher and his influence led Diane to make herself a success. When Marty is released, Tommy moves in with him temporarily to help him recuperate.|$|E

5|$|In 2009, the World Health Organisation (WHO) {{recommended}} that rotavirus vaccine {{be included in}} all national immunisation programmes. The incidence and severity of rotavirus infections has declined significantly in countries that have acted on this recommendation. A 2014 review of available clinical trial data from countries routinely using rotavirus vaccines in their national immunisation programs found that rotavirus vaccines have reduced rotavirus hospitalisations by 49-92 percent and all cause diarrhoea hospitalisations by 17-55 percent. In Mexico, which in 2006 {{was among the first}} countries in the world to introduce rotavirus vaccine, diarrhoeal disease death rates dropped during the 2009 rotavirus season by more than 65 percent among children age two and under. In Nicaragua, which in 2006 became the first developing country to introduce a rotavirus vaccine, severe rotavirus infections were reduced by 40 percent and emergency room visits by a half. In the United States, rotavirus vaccination since 2006 has led to drops in rotavirus-related hospitalisations by as much as 86 percent. The vaccines may also have prevented illness in non-vaccinated children by limiting the number of circulating infections. In developing countries in Africa and Asia, where the majority of rotavirus deaths occur, a large number of safety and efficacy trials as well as recent post-introduction impact and effectiveness studies of Rotarix and RotaTeq have found that vaccines dramatically reduced severe disease among infants. In September 2013, the vaccine was offered to all children in the UK, aged between two and three months, and it is expected to halve the cases of severe infection and reduce the number of children admitted to <b>hospital</b> <b>because</b> of the infection by 70 percent. In Europe, hospitalisation rates following infection by rotavirus have decreased by 65% to 84% following the introduction of the vaccine.|$|E

50|$|However, {{criticism}} {{has been directed}} against private <b>hospitals,</b> <b>because</b> although {{most of them are}} equipped with state-of-art medical devices, if any serious medical emergency occurs (e.g. massive internal bleeding), the patient is transferred to a public hospital.

A psychiatrist from Glenside Mental Health Service, a campus of the Royal Adelaide Hospital, was told about Anna's behaviour, and said that her problems were behavioural, and not mental-health related. The Rural and Remote Mental Health Service (RRMHS) offered a videoconference, but Baxter officials instead wanted Anna to be admitted to a <b>hospital,</b> <b>because</b> they believed that she would not cooperate with a video assessment.

25|$|Death {{in those}} with a GI bleed is more {{commonly}} due to other illnesses (some of which {{may have contributed to}} the bleed, such as cancer or cirrhosis) than the bleeding itself. Of those admitted to a <b>hospital</b> <b>because</b> of a GI bleed, death occurs in about 7%. Despite treatment, re-bleeding occurs in about 7‚Äì16% of those with upper GI bleeding. In those with esophageal varices, bleeding occurs in about 5‚Äì15% a year and if they have bled once, there is a higher risk of further bleeding within six weeks. Testing and treating H. pylori if found can prevent re-bleeding {{in those with}} peptic ulcers. The benefits versus risks of restarting blood thinners such as aspirin or warfarin and anti-inflammatories such as NSAIDs need to be carefully considered. If aspirin is needed for cardiovascular disease prevention, it is reasonable to restart it within seven days in combination with a PPI for those with nonvariceal upper GI bleeding.|$|E

25|$|On August 30, a new fire {{broke out}} {{on the island of}} Kornat, part of the Kornati National park. A team of 23 firemen was sent on an Mi-8 {{helicopter}} on what they thought would be just a routine mission. Upon arrival, they split into two teams, one with 6 firemen and the other with 17. The latter split up one more time when three firemen lost their communication gear and again when the fourth one went checking for the signal, while trying to call his superiors. The remaining 13 were stranded between two hills with no water whatsoever, since the large water canister landed 500 meters away from them. While searching for it, they got encircled by a wall of fire. Although the burning grass was only 10cm tall, the firemen didn't have the necessary equipment and had nowhere to run. In only a minute, six of them were killed instantly, while the other seven remained lying on the ground, badly burned, waiting for help more than two hours. After the rescue, they were sent to the hospital in Zadar and then transferred to hospitals in Zagreb and Split. Six of them died in <b>hospital</b> <b>because</b> of serious burns covering large areas of their bodies. The fire itself had nowhere to spread, and was soon naturally extinguished, bringing up many questions about the necessity of the intervention.
