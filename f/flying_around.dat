5|$|All of Van Dormael's films contain surreal elements. In {{his first}} two films, these moments were few, like dancing flowers in Toto le héros or Georges <b>flying</b> <b>around</b> the room in Le huitième jour. Mr. Nobody makes much more {{extensive}} use of surreal imagery throughout the film.|$|E
5|$|The {{first test}} for the flying {{sequences}} involved simply catapulting a crash test dummy out of a cannon. Another technique had a remote control cast of Superman <b>flying</b> <b>around.</b> Both were discarded {{due to lack of}} movement. High-quality, realistic-looking animation was tried, with speed trails added to make the effect more convincing.|$|E
5|$|Because of the {{difficulty}} and risk of meeting the Huaorani on the ground, the missionaries chose to drop gifts to the Huaorani by fixed-wing aircraft. Their drop technique, developed by Nate Saint, involved <b>flying</b> <b>around</b> the drop location in tight circles while lowering the gift from the plane on a rope. This kept the bundle in roughly {{the same position as}} it approached the ground. On October 6, 1955, Saint made the first drop, releasing a small kettle containing buttons and rock salt. The gift-giving continued during the following weeks, with the missionaries dropping machetes, ribbons, clothing, pots, and various trinkets.|$|E
5000|$|In June 1987 a Gulfstream IV set 22 {{world records}} in its class in <b>flying</b> west <b>around</b> {{the world in}} 45 hr 25 min. The next year another GIV set 11 world records <b>flying</b> east <b>around</b> the world. [...] In 1990, Gulfstream CEO Allen Paulson and a Gulfstream flight crew set 35 {{international}} records for around-the-world flight in a GIV.|$|R

5|$|Launching a fresh assault, Pit {{succeeds in}} {{injuring}} Hades, but the Great Sacred Treasure is badly damaged {{during the battle}} leaving only its cannon intact. Hades attempts to launch a massive attack, but a revived Medusa injures him further, giving Palutena the chance to charge the Great Sacred Treasure's cannon with her power. Pit then uses the cannon to obliterate Hades' body, saving the world. At {{the start of the}} credits, Pit and Dark Pit are <b>flying</b> <b>around</b> as Palutena and Viridi have a brief argument.|$|E
5|$|A {{modified}} version of the spacecraft was proposed, which would have included a cargo module attached to the back of a modified equipment module. The spacecraft would have approached the station, and docked backwards using a port on the rear of the cargo module. If one of the forward docking configurations had been used for the Gemini itself, the docking would have been controlled remotely from the station, with the Gemini then separating from the cargo module and <b>flying</b> <b>around</b> the station to dock normally on a different port. The rear-docking Gemini would have simply remained attached to the cargo module, with the crew boarding the station through it. Its docking would have been controlled by its own crew, from a station {{at the back of the}} cargo module.|$|E
5|$|Mike Walsh {{was worried}} about filming the moment when a beam breaks inside the Luthor mansion, from the wind {{generated}} by the storm, and lands on top of Lionel. His crew already knew which beam was going to fall, {{but they did not}} know where to cut the beam because they were not sure how Beeman intended to shoot the scene. When the day of shooting came around everything worked out well. They used a stunt double for the initial impact of the beam, and then John Glover stepped back into the scene and fell down with the beam on top of him. The wind effects also created potential danger for the cast and crew. As Eric Johnson recalls, even the smallest piece of debris <b>flying</b> <b>around</b> at such high speeds can cause damage. Annette O’Toole had a similar experience for her scenes in the storm cellar. When Jonathan races into the storm after Nixon, the special effects crew used one of their jet fans and some dry leaves to simulate the winds that were coming from outside; the dry leaves were smacking O’Toole in the face, smothering her.|$|E
50|$|The design {{called for}} <b>flying</b> buttresses <b>around</b> the {{mechanical}} penthouse, which were eventually dropped. Early on, {{the building was}} envisioned as much taller in order to house a Mandarin Oriental hotel, but a deal was never struck.|$|R
50|$|New Pillow Fight, also titled Daughters' Pillow Fight, is {{the name}} of a very early short comedy film, {{released}} in 1897. This scene shows four little girls indulging in a pillow fight. Eventually, the feathers are <b>flying</b> all <b>around.</b>|$|R
5000|$|Flyability has a {{presence}} {{at a number}} of <b>flying</b> events <b>around</b> the UK. Recent events have included Farnborough 2016 and Flyer Live 2016 on the Aerobility stands. Flyability also attended and was a beneficiary of the Richard Westgate Memorial Fly-in in 2013 ...|$|R
5|$|Tomb Raider: Underworld {{continued}} the plot line established in Legend. Crystal Dynamics used {{new technology to}} improve the character for seventh generation consoles, focusing on improving realism. The dirt accumulation and water cleansing mechanic from Legend was altered to be a real-time mechanic that can involve the entire game environment. To achieve a more natural appearance, the developers added spherical harmonics to provide indirect lighting to in-game objects like Lara Croft. Crystal Dynamics made the character model more complex and detailed than previous instalments, featuring more texture layers that determine the appearance of shadows and reflective light on it, and using skeletal animation to portray believable movement. The number of polygons in the model increased to 32,000. The developers enhanced Croft's facial model by {{increasing the number of}} polygons, bones used in the animation skeleton, and graphical shaders in the face to add more detail and expressive capabilities. The hair was created as a real-time cloth simulation to further add realism to its shape and movement. The developers kept Croft's hair tied back because they felt a real person would not want it <b>flying</b> <b>around</b> while performing dangerous manoeuvres. The character's body size was increased and breast size reduced to portray more realistic proportions.|$|E

25|$|A pair of {{peregrine}} falcons nest {{on top of}} the building. These {{birds are}} rare, but they are often seen <b>flying</b> <b>around</b> Woking. The Royal Society for the Protection of Birds requested that people should not disturb the pair of falcons.|$|E
25|$|On 28 March 2014, C-130J-30 KC-3803 crashed near Gwalior, India, {{killing all}} 5 {{personnel}} aboard. The aircraft was conducting low level penetration training by <b>flying</b> at <b>around</b> 300ft when it ran into wake turbulence from another {{aircraft in the}} formation, which caused it to crash.|$|R
50|$|Steve Fossett {{planned a}} second circumnavigation in the GlobalFlyer in 2006, this time {{taking off from}} the Kennedy Space Center in Florida, <b>flying</b> {{eastbound}} <b>around</b> the world then crossing the Atlantic a second time and then landing at Kent International Airport in Kent, England.|$|R
50|$|The main {{producer}} of the type was Manfred Weiss in Hungary, who built the design to equip the Hungarian Air Force, which {{was at that time}} masquerading as civil <b>flying</b> clubs. <b>Around</b> 30 aircraft were purchased, making this the most significant user of the type.|$|R
25|$|In 1908, {{a renewed}} railway station was opened. The station was elevated, so {{traffic in the}} city was no longer {{hampered}} by railway crossings. In 1911, Anthony Fokker showed his plane, de Spin to the audience in Haarlem by <b>flying</b> <b>around</b> the Sint-Bavokerk on Queen's Day.|$|E
25|$|King was an FAA {{certified}} {{private pilot}} {{and learned to}} fly in 1963 at what was then Chicago Hammond Airport in Lansing, Illinois. He frequently flew to gigs but in 1995 his insurance company and manager asked him to fly only with another certified pilot. As a result, he stopped <b>flying</b> <b>around</b> the age of 70.|$|E
25|$|The female uses both ovaries and births one pup. It breeds {{once every}} year – the females are monoestrous and only produce one offspring. The females all give birth {{at about the}} same time every year. To mate, these bats swarm, <b>flying</b> <b>around</b> objects, and the males perform courting rituals in the air. It is thought that during flight, the sacs on the males release fragrances.|$|E
60|$|But, {{early the}} next morning, before any one else was astir, he resumed his journey, and at {{precisely}} ten o'clock of this day, which was Saturday, he completed his <b>flying</b> trip <b>around</b> the world by alighting unobserved upon the well-trimmed lawn of his own home.|$|R

25|$|Elan Vital {{states that}} the only {{effective}} way of {{reaching out to the}} over 80 countries where his message is now promoted is by leased private jet, which Rawat self-pilots, <b>flying</b> <b>around</b> a quarter million miles a year. In 2007 during a two-month tour of India, Sri Lanka and Nepal, Rawat spoke at 36 events, addressing over 800,000 people, and by live satellite broadcasts reached an additional 2.25 million.|$|E
25|$|The Piper Cub {{quickly became}} a {{familiar}} sight. First Lady Eleanor Roosevelt took a flight in a J-3 Cub, posing {{for a series of}} publicity photos to help promote the CPTP. Newsreels and newspapers of the era often featured images of wartime leaders, such as Generals Dwight Eisenhower, George Patton and George Marshall, <b>flying</b> <b>around</b> European battlefields in Piper Cubs. Civilian-owned Cubs joined the war effort as part of the newly formed Civil Air Patrol, patrolling the Eastern Seaboard and Gulf Coast in a constant search for German U-boats and survivors of U-boat attacks.|$|E
25|$|Normally only {{occurring}} when {{a resident}} male {{of a primary}} territory is challenged by an intruding male, intra-species conflict is often fleeting, typically lasting 60 seconds or less. Both males typically engage each other by <b>flying</b> <b>around</b> each other, occasionally bumping, within 0.5 to 1.0 m circles. No actual grappling would occur, and this behavior would continue until one male, typically the intruder, leaves. Male E. imperialis typically ignore members of other species, both bees and animals, in the immediate area of their perch and vicinity of their territories. However, Solenopsis ants have a parasitic relationship with E. imperialis, since they enter some of the cells from below the nest and rob the cell contents.|$|E

50|$|The Japanese had {{intended}} to swing the <b>flying</b> division <b>around</b> the right flank of the Chinese line in an encirclement, but the timely arrival of the Kuang Ping and Pingyuan, along with the torpedo boats Fu Lung (built at Schichau) and Choi Ti (a Yarrow-built vessel), diverted this maneuver.|$|R
25|$|Loerzer was out {{of contact}} with Reichenau's command post for three days, while Richthofen was soon {{complaining}} to Löhr about the former's ignorance. Because he was impetuous {{and wanted to be}} in the thick of the action, Richthofen began <b>flying</b> <b>around</b> over the frontline in a Fieseler Fi 156 Storch, as air-ground liaison collapsed. His claims were not always believed, and these personal operations were a waste of time and needlessly exposed him to danger. Indeed, Major Spielvogel was shot down over Warsaw in his Storch on 9 September, and killed. While the operational situation was not good, Löhr took command of Fliegerführer z.b.V., giving the unit virtual autonomy and allowing Richthofen to build a personal empire of six Gruppen (Groups).|$|E
25|$|Males of V. maculifrons tend to form loose aggregations, {{resembling}} leks, during mating. In one area, hundreds {{to thousands}} of males patrol prominent trees and bushes by constantly <b>flying</b> <b>around</b> them. Males typically patrol large areas randomly, rather than limiting to a few trees. If a male sees a female while patrolling, he flies closer to the female in a zigzag fashion and stops on a nearby leaf. This then allows the male to climb onto the female’s gaster from behind. Other males {{do not try to}} approach an ongoing copulation, but a male might try to copulate immediately after. If a second mating occurs, sperm competition may favor the second male. As a result, males can prevent competition from another male by elongating copulation.|$|E
25|$|A new {{section of}} Stammheim Prison was built {{especially}} for the RAF and {{was considered one of}} the most secure prison blocks around the world at the time. The prisoners were transferred there in 1975 (three years after their arrest). The roof and the courtyard was covered with steel mesh. During the night the precinct was illuminated by fifty-four spotlights and twenty-three neon bulbs. Special military forces were guarding the roof, including snipers. Four hundred police officers along with the Federal Office for the Protection of the Constitution patrolled the building. The mounted police officers oscillated on a double shift. One hundred more GSG-9 units reinforced the police during the trial. BKA agents guarded the front of the court area. Finally there were helicopters <b>flying</b> <b>around</b> the area.|$|E

60|$|This fact, {{as far as}} it {{symbolizes the}} moral fact of the Unattainable, the <b>flying</b> Perfect, <b>around</b> which the hands of man can never meet, at once the inspirer and the condemner of every success, may {{conveniently}} serve us to connect many illustrations of human power in every department.|$|R
