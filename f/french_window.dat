25|$|A French door {{consists}} of a frame around one or more transparent or translucent panels (called lights or lites) that may be installed singly, in matching pairs, or even as series. A matching pair of these doors is called a <b>French</b> <b>window,</b> as it resembles a door-height casement window. When a pair of French doors {{is used as a}} <b>French</b> <b>window,</b> the application does not generally include a central mullion (as do some casement window pairs), thus allowing a wider unobstructed opening. The frame typically requires a weather strip at floor level and where the doors meet to prevent water ingress. An espagnolette bolt may allow the head and foot of each door to be secured in one movement. The slender window joinery maximizes light into the room and minimizes the visual impact of the doorway joinery when considered externally. The doors of a <b>French</b> <b>window</b> often open outward onto a balcony, porch, or terrace and they may provide an entrance to a garden.|$|E
25|$|A garden door {{resembles a}} <b>French</b> <b>window</b> (with lites), but is more secure because only one door is operable. The hinge of the {{operating}} door is next to the adjacent fixed door and the latch {{is located at the}} wall opening jamb rather than between the two doors or with the use of an espagnolette bolt.|$|E

On the front elevation, <b>French</b> <b>windows</b> with fanlights {{on either side of}} the portico open onto the porch. Casement windows with lattice lights above sit on the second story above the <b>French</b> <b>windows.</b> On the east side, there are two <b>French</b> <b>windows</b> with casements above and a porte-cochère below a small balcony. Windows on the west elevation are one-over-one double-hung sash windows, except for casements on a sleeping porch off the rear of the house.|$|R

25|$|French {{doors are}} derived from an {{original}} French design called the casement door. It is a door with lites where all or some panels {{would be in a}} casement door. A French door traditionally has a moulded panel {{at the bottom of the}} door. It is called a <b>French</b> <b>window</b> when used in a pair as double-leaved doors with large glass panels in each door leaf, and in which the doors may swing out (typically) as well as in.|$|E
25|$|All guests retire for bed except Lord Charles and Sir George. Mr. Carlile {{is sent to}} get {{the plans}} for the fighter from the safe, so he set off for the study, colliding with Mrs. Vanderlyn who wants to {{retrieve}} her handbag. The two men walk along the terrace, when Lord Charles is startled by a figure leaving the study by the <b>French</b> <b>window,</b> although Sir George sees nothing. When they enter the study, Mr. Carlile has the papers out but Lord Charles quickly sees that the plans of the fighter itself are gone. Carlile is adamant that they were in the safe and he put them on the table. He was distracted when he heard a woman's scream in the hallway and ran out to find Leonie, Mrs. Vanderlyn's maid, who claimed that she had seen a ghost. Carlile had not otherwise left the study. Sir George suggests calling in Hercule Poirot immediately.|$|E
2500|$|It is {{difficult}} not to ascribe enormous weight to this experience for the direction his work took from that time on. Two pictures he saw there reverberate in almost every Ocean Park canvas. View of Notre Dame and <b>French</b> <b>Window</b> at Collioure, both painted in 1914, were on view {{for the first time}} in the US.|$|E

2500|$|Post Impressionism {{as practiced}} by Paul Gauguin, Georges Seurat, Vincent van Gogh and Paul Cézanne had an {{enormous}} impact on 20th-century art and led to the advent of 20th-century abstraction. The heritage of painters like Van Gogh, Cézanne, Gauguin, and Seurat was essential for the development of modern art. At the beginning of the 20th century Henri Matisse and several other young artists including the pre-cubist Georges Braque, André Derain, Raoul Dufy and Maurice de Vlaminck revolutionized the Paris art world with [...] "wild", multi-colored, expressive landscapes and figure paintings that the critics called Fauvism. With his expressive use of color and his free and imaginative drawing Henri Matisse comes very close to pure abstraction in <b>French</b> <b>Window</b> at Collioure (1914), View of Notre-Dame (1914), and The Yellow Curtain from 1915. The raw language of color as developed by the Fauves directly influenced another pioneer of abstraction, Wassily Kandinsky (see illustration).|$|E
2500|$|The painterly {{legacy of}} 20th-century {{painting}} {{is a long}} and intertwined mainstream of influences and complex interrelationships. The use of large opened fields of expressive color applied in generous painterly portions, accompanied by loose drawing (vague linear spots and/or figurative outline) can first {{be seen in the}} early 20th-century works of both Henri Matisse and Joan Miró. Matisse and Miró as well as Pablo Picasso, Paul Klee, Wassily Kandinsky and Piet Mondrian directly influenced the Abstract Expressionists, the Color Field painters of Post-Painterly Abstraction and the Lyrical Abstractionists. Late 19th-century Americans like Augustus Vincent Tack and Albert Pinkham Ryder along with early American Modernists like Georgia O'Keeffe, Marsden Hartley Stuart Davis, Arthur Dove and Milton Avery's landscapes also provided important precedents and were influences on the Abstract Expressionists, the Color Field painters and the Lyrical Abstractionists. Henri Matisse paintings <b>French</b> <b>Window</b> at Collioure, and View of Notre Dame both from 1914 exerted tremendous influence on American Color Field painters in general (including Robert Motherwell's Open Series) and on Richard Diebenkorn's Ocean Park paintings specifically. According to art historian Jane Livingston, Diebenkorn saw both Matisse paintings in an exhibition in Los Angeles in 1966 and they had an enormous impact on him and his work. Jane Livingston says about the January 1966 Matisse exhibition that Diebenkorn saw in Los Angeles: ...|$|E
2500|$|It {{is set in}} a Grade II listed pink painted Georgian townhouse named Ivy House, in a small seaside town, {{and takes}} its name from the medieval Celtic sport of Cnapan, {{although}} there is little to connect the two today. Dated to the early 19th century, architecturally Ivy House, two-storeys with attic, is described as [...] "painted roughcast, with panelled doorcase and fanlight, the porch with the etiolated, debased classical columns popular all over the region". There are 3 bays on each floor at the front, with a <b>French</b> <b>window</b> on each floor on the western wing, where the restaurant is located. Next door is Sessions House, dated to 1900, but with a stucco front with windows in the late 18th-century style. As of 2001 it had 5 double rooms, a bar, and a restaurant; it is the restaurant for which it has earned its reputation. The interior consists of traditional Welsh oak furnishings. In the hallway is a traditional heavy oak Welsh dresser which contains items belonging to the owners. In the sitting room is a wood-burning stove and books and magazines, and in the dining room is a large stone fireplace, with pictures and pieces of armour on the walls and lace-covered tables. The bedrooms are small, with pine furniture and bright hues, with a [...] "tiny shower". The hotel has been run by the Coopers since 1984; Judith Cooper and her daughter are the chief cooks. [...] It became a Grade II listed building on 14 April 1992.|$|E

2500|$|Framton Nuttel, {{a nervous}} man, {{has come to}} stay in the country for his health. His sister, who thinks he should socialise while he is there, has given him letters of {{introduction}} to families in the neighbourhood whom she got to know when she was staying there a few years previously. Framton goes to visit Mrs Sappleton and, while he is waiting for her to come down, is entertained by her fifteen-year-old, witty niece. The niece tells him that the <b>French</b> <b>window</b> is kept open, even though it is October, because Mrs Sappleton believes that her husband and her brothers, who were drowned in a bog three years before, will come back one day. When Mrs Sappleton comes down she talks about her husband and her brothers, and how they are going to come back from shooting soon, and Framton, believing that she is deranged, tries to [...] distract her by talking about his health. Then, to his horror, Mrs Sappleton points out that her husband and her brothers are coming, and he sees them walking towards the window with their dog. He thinks he is seeing ghosts and runs away. Mrs Sappleton cannot understand why he has run away and, when her husband and her brothers come in, she tells them about the odd man who has just left. The niece explains that Framton Nuttel ran away because of the spaniel: he is afraid of dogs since he was hunted by a pack of stray dogs in India and had to spend a night in the newly dug grave with creatures grinning and foaming just above him. The last line summarizes the story, saying of the niece, [...] "Romance at short notice was her speciality." ...|$|E
