40|$|In {{a number}} of econometric models, rules of large-sample {{inference}} require a consistent estimate <b>of</b> <b>f(0),</b> where f (?) is the spectral density matrix of yt = ut?xt, for covariance stationary vectors ut, xt. Typically yt is allowed to have nonparametric autocorrelation, and smoothing {{is used in the}} estimation <b>of</b> <b>f(0).</b> We give conditions under which f(0) can be consistently estimated without smoothing. The conditions are relevant to inference on slope parameters in models with an intercept and strictly exogenous regressors, and allow regressors and disturbances to collectively have considerable stationary long memory and to satisfy only mild, in some cases minimal, moment conditions. The estimate <b>of</b> <b>f(0)</b> dominates smoothed ones {{in the sense that it}} can have mean squared error of order n- 1, where n is sample size.

40|$|Background & Purpose:  T 1 AM is a thyronamine {{derivative}} of thyroid hormone {{acting as a}} signalling molecule via non-genomic effectors and can reach intracellular targets. In light of the importance <b>of</b> <b>F(0)</b> F(1) -ATPsynthase as a target in drug development, T 1 AM interaction with the enzyme is demonstrated by its effects on the activity and a model of binding locations is depicted. Experimental Approach:  Kinetic analyses were performed on F(0) F(1) -ATPsynthase in sub-mitochondrial particles and soluble F(1) -ATPase. Activity assays and immunodetection of the inhibitor protein IF(1) were used and combined with molecular docking analyses. In situ respirometric analysis of T 1 AM effect was investigated on H 9 c 2 cardiomyocytes. Key Results:  T 1 AM is a non-competitive inhibitor <b>of</b> <b>F(0)</b> F(1) -ATPsynthase whose binding is mutually exclusive {{with that of the}} inhibitors IF(1) and aurovertin B. Distinct T 1 AM binding sites are consistent with results from both kinetic and docking analyses: at low nanomolar concentrations, T 1 AM binds to a high affinity-region likely located within the IF(1) binding site, causing IF(1) release; at higher concentrations, T 1 AM binds to a low affinity-region likely located within the aurovertin binding cavity and inhibits enzyme activity. Low nanomolar concentrations of T 1 AM elicit in cardiomyocytes an increase in ADP-stimulated mitochondrial respiration indicative for an activation <b>of</b> <b>F(0)</b> F(1) -ATPsynthase consistent with displacement of endogenous IF(1,) thereby reinforcing the in vitro results. Conclusions & Implications:  The T 1 AM effects upon F(0) F(1) -ATPsynthase are twofold: IF(1) displacement and enzyme inhibition. By targeting F(0) F(1) -ATPsynthase within mitochondria T 1 AM might affect cell bioenergetics with a positive effect on mitochondrial energy production at low endogenous concentration. T 1 AM putative binding locations overlapping with IF(1) and aurovertin binding sites are depicted...|$|R
