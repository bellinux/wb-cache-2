Generally, the harmonic minimization problem complexity is influenced by the number of <b>harmonic</b> <b>orders</b> to be minimized. This paper presents the utilization of genetic algorithm (GA) to solve harmonic minimization problem in multilevel inverter. The objective is to find relationship between the number of minimized <b>harmonic</b> <b>orders</b> and the results of total harmonic distortion (THD). The inverter to investigate is 11 -level, but it is also applicable to multilevel inverters with any number of levels. The results show that harmonic contained in the output voltage has a small dependence on the number of <b>harmonic</b> <b>orders</b> that are minimized.

50|$|Harmonic {{generation}} in dielectric solids is well understood andextensively used in modern laser physics (see second harmonic generation). In 1967 New et al. observed the first third harmonic{{generation in}} a gas. In monatomic gases it is onlypossible to produce odd numbered harmonics for reasons ofsymmetry. Harmonic generation in the perturbative (weak field)regime is characterised by rapidly decreasing efficiency withincreasing <b>harmonic</b> <b>order.</b> This behaviour can beunderstood by considering an atom absorbing n photonsthen emitting a single high energy photon. The probability ofabsorbing n photons decreases as n increases, explaining the rapiddecrease {{in the initial}} harmonic intensities. Nevertheless, harmonics up to the 11th order havebeen observed under these conditions.|$|E
5000|$|The Kerr {{effect can}} be {{described}} as a [...] as well. At high peak powers the Kerr effect can cause filamentation of light in air, in which the light travels without dispersion or divergence in a self-generated waveguide. [...] At even high intensities the Taylor series, which led the domination of the lower orders, does not converge anymore and instead a time based model is used. When a noble gas atom is hit by an intense laser pulse, which has an electric field strength comparable to the Coulomb field of the atom, the outermost electron may be ionized from the atom. Once freed, the electron can be accelerated by the electric field of the light, first moving away from the ion, then back toward it as the field changes direction. The electron may then recombine with the ion, releasing its energy {{in the form of a}} photon. The light is emitted at every peak of the laser light field which is intense enough, producing a series of attosecond light flashes. The photon energies generated by this process can extend past the 800th <b>harmonic</b> <b>order</b> up to a few KeV. This is called high-order harmonic generation. The laser must be linearly polarized, so that the electron returns to the vicinity of the parent ion. High-order harmonic generation has been observed in noble gas jets, cells, and gas-filled capillary waveguides.|$|E
5000|$|Shaw {{is also a}} {{journeyman}} jazz saxophonist, chiefly on tenor (with clarinet), sometimes alto and, unusually, c-melody. His {{approach to}} tone and harmony derived from the later, less influential style of Lester Young. (His teachers included Hotel Leofric bandleader and tenorman, Barry Phelps, whose virtuosity on the clarinet had been honed in the Central Band of the Royal Air Force, and [...] "cool school" [...] tenormen Pete Warner and Brian Gray, who originated in Coventry and seemed ever present in the touring [...] "name" [...] big bands of the fifties.) He had had a youthful, essential jazz education in the influential rehearsal big band of top trumpeter, Cyril Narbeth. It was then almost inevitable that he should experiment in combining poetry with jazz in public performance. However, Shaw's role in the poetry&jazz project - {{he was the only}} poet - was originator, director and poet, as well as performer of poems. He hired musicians, discussed the poems with them, and sketched the possible jazz responses but left the final musical detail to them. He wanted their improvisation, the defining characteristic of jazz, to interact with his [...] "readings" [...] in public performance. (This was in contrast to much contemporary fusion which used pre-arranged jazz [...] "settings" [...] for the poems.) He was not, though occasionally categorised as such, a [...] "performance poet" [...] in the modern narrow sense of creating [...] "spontaneous" [...] ditties. His poems were composed with an eye to dramatic projection of the words, to The Event, but equally they {{had to be able to}} work as poems. (The poems ranged from those influenced by jazz forms like the [...] "blues" [...] and the ballad to complex literary structures.) Similarly the jazz sought the <b>harmonic</b> <b>order</b> of jazz -it was not a [...] "freak-out"! The poetry and the jazz had to fuse but at the same time retain their intrinsic identities - a sensitive balance. The jazzmen were drawn from leading modern jazz groups like those of Ronnie Scott, John Dankworth and Mike Westbrook and the British band of Maynard Ferguson. (Bassist Jeff Clyne, who played a number of engagements with the poetry&jazz touring outfit in 1974, was a member of the Stan Tracey Quartet which made the 1965 classic jazz album inspired by Under Milk Wood.) Shaw also brought into the limelight some jazzmen who were [...] "local legends", like Bradford's [...] "cool school" [...] altoist, Joe Markey. A typical programme included straight jazz, poems on their own and, the major ingredient, poetry&jazz fusion. The package broadcast and played a variety of arts and jazz venues, touring Britain extensively from 1972 to 1983, as New Poetry&Jazz (in London, The South and Midlands) and Northern Poetry&Jazz (in The North and Scotland) attracting new followers to both forms. The most settled collaboration was the two years with the Dick Hawdon Quintet. A representative performance (which received three stars in The Virgin Encyclopedia of Jazz) can be heard on The Yorkshire Arts Association LP, Poetry&Jazz on Record - The Dick Hawden (sic) Quintet with Pete Morgan and Robert Shaw. (Pete Morgan was a guest on the recording.) During a brief revival of touring in the East Midlands 2000-2002 a recording was made of new material, a sequence of verse portraits by Shaw of great jazzmen set against a duo performance of a number associated with each. The duo consisted of Shaw on reeds and Angharad Griffiths on keyboard. A limited edition CD of this,Take a Jazz Journey, was sold at live venues. In the early 80's Leeds College of Music recorded an Electro-Acoustic Setting by Bill Charleson of 3 Poems by Robert Shaw. Subsequently it was used as part of a thesis presented at the University of York by Charleson.|$|E

40|$|Multiphase {{induction}} motor (MIM) drives are {{popular in the}} area of high power traction and ship propulsion for their advantages of higher efficiency, lower torque pulsations and greater fault tolerance. Further, using pole-phase modulation (PPM) for these MIM drives widens the speed-torque ranges effectively. But, using multiphase space vector pulse width modulation (SVPWM) to control these MIM drives yield lesser dc link voltage utilization (DLVU) compared to their three-phase (3 -φ) counter parts. This is because the offset value added to the sine references in multiphase SVPWM is always lesser compared to the third <b>harmonic</b> <b>order</b> offset value in case of 3 -φ SVPWM. Adding third <b>harmonic</b> <b>order</b> offset value even for multiphase sine references yields extra DLVU same as 3 -φ SVPWM.
