25|$|What he has <b>got</b> <b>to</b> <b>understand</b> {{is that we}} were {{speaking}} the truth for 23 years and apologies have only started to come today from them because of yesterday. It's too little, too late. It's fine to apologise afterwards. They just don't want their names in any more sleaze. No, his apology doesn't mean a thing to me.|$|E
25|$|I was {{lobbying}} at the Council of Europe and at Parliament; I {{was over}} in Washington, in Jo'burg, in South America. It was 'let's get guns for the Contras', that sort of stuff. I was enjoying it immensely, I got to go with these guys and fire off AK-47s. I always like to go where the action is, and for that period in the Reagan/Thatcher days, it was great fun, it was all expenses paid and I {{got to see the}} world. I used to think that World Briefing was a bit funny. The only scary thing about those publications was the mailing listpeople like George Bushand the fact that Hart would talk to the head of British Intelligence for an hour. I used to think it was us having a laugh, putting some loony right-wing sell in, and that somebody somewhere was taking it seriously. You've <b>got</b> <b>to</b> <b>understand</b> that we had a sense of humour about this.|$|E
25|$|In the 1970 constitution, {{the electoral}} system was {{changed with the}} 'B' roll being abolished. Instead, the {{electorate}} were segregated by race with European, Asian and mixed citizens meeting certain income and property qualifications – an annual income of 1,800 dollars or more {{for the past two}} years or immovable property worth 3,600 dollars or more, with either demand lowered by a third if the person had completed four years of secondary education – voting in 50 constituencies, with Africans meeting lower qualifications – an annual income of 600 dollars or more for the two past years or immovable property worth 1,200 dollars or more, with either demand lowered by a third if the voter had completed two years of secondary education – voting in eight. In addition, there were eight seats elected by an electoral college of African tribal chiefs. Prime Minister Ian Smith justified this setup on the grounds that the vast majority of black Rhodesians had no experience with the democratic system. White Rhodesians feared that rapid transition to majority rule might yield similar hardships to those experienced by the other newly independent African states such as Ghana, Tanzania, Uganda, and Nigeria. Smith proposed a gradual inclusion of Africans, increasing as the African population <b>got</b> <b>to</b> <b>understand</b> the system. This was based on the contributions to the fisc, hence the 50-16 split in the 66-seat chamber, with a new Rhodesian Senate being instated as well. Critics counter that this was simply a strategy to perpetuate European settler rule for as long as possible, and whether this transition would have happened over the next few decades is unclear.|$|E

No words, now, you've <b>got</b> <b>to</b> stop. <b>Understand?</b> You know as well as I, perhaps better, the {{character}} of your so-called inn. You'll get but one more chance." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "The position's <b>got</b> <b>to</b> be <b>understood,</b> though," [...] {{returned}} Nares, {{perhaps a}} trifle mollified. [...] "My position, I mean. I'm {{not going to}} ship sailing-master; it's enough {{out of my way}} already, to set a foot on this mosquito schooner." ...|$|R
500|$|In 2008, an old video {{surfaced}} of Mills {{wearing a}} mink coat she had owned in 1989, but explained to reporters {{that she had}} bought it years before becoming involved in animal rights organisations or vegetarianism. Although she had separated from McCartney, Mills said: [...] "It's only since I met Paul [...] that I really <b>got</b> <b>to</b> <b>understand</b> how vegetarianism not only benefits your health massively but also makes a huge difference to the planet, to animals, and to feeding the world." [...] In August 2008, she was honoured by the organisation Farm Animal Rights Movement (FARM), with the Celebrity Animal Activist Award, presented at the Animal Rights National Conference.|$|E
500|$|... "Stay Together for the Kids" [...] {{is written}} about divorce {{from the point}} of view of a {{helpless}} child. Its heavier sound was inspired by bands the group's members were listening to in the two weeks they wrote their fourth album, Take Off Your Pants and Jacket, such as Fugazi and Refused. Primarily written by guitarist Tom DeLonge, the song is biographical in nature. He and bassist Mark Hoppus were growing up when their parents divorced. For Hoppus, he was eight years old when he was sent to live with his father. [...] "The thing you realize as you get older is that parents don’t know what the hell they’re doing and neither will you when you get to be a parent. You’ve just <b>got</b> <b>to</b> <b>understand</b> that people are human and they make mistakes," [...] he said. DeLonge remembered learning of his parents' divorce when he discovered scrape marks on the driveway of their home. [...] "Right then, I knew my dad had dragged out his furniture single-handedly," [...] he recalled. He spoke on the song's inspiration in 2001: ...|$|E
2500|$|During the South Carolina Democratic Debate in Myrtle Beach, Edwards {{sought to}} {{distinguish}} himself from Senators Obama and Clinton, and criticized {{them for their}} attacks and [...] "big city" [...] politics. As soon {{as he began to}} question how the attacks helped, he was widely cheered by the audience for in what many people thought was what distinguished Edwards from negative campaigning. Saying [...] "This kind of squabbling, how many children are going to get healthcare? How many {{people are going to get}} an education from this? How many kids are going to be able to go to college because of this? We have <b>got</b> <b>to</b> <b>understand</b> and I respect both of my fellow candidates, but we have <b>got</b> <b>to</b> <b>understand</b> that this is not about us personally, it is about what we are trying to do for this country and what we believe in", Edwards began to get applause from several members of the audience.|$|E
5000|$|Subsequent {{independent}} research by Phil Birnbaum, Clifford Blau and Tom Tippett confirmed Wright's findings, but Wright still praises McCracken as [...] "... 'the' guy who really <b>got</b> people <b>to</b> <b>understand</b> that most folks overestimate the pitcher's {{ability to influence}} the number of hits that result from balls batted into the field of play." ...|$|R
60|$|Here {{the young}} man {{explained}} to the attentive Bumpus the course {{that he was to}} follow, and having <b>got</b> him thoroughly <b>to</b> <b>understand</b> his part, he sent him away to execute it.|$|R
6000|$|... "As long as I {{know that}} you understand," [...] he whispered. [...] "But of course you do. It's a great {{satisfaction}} <b>to</b> have <b>got</b> somebody <b>to</b> <b>understand.</b> You seem <b>to</b> have been there on purpose." [...] And in the same whisper, as if we two whenever we talked had to say things to each other which were not fit {{for the world to}} hear, he added, [...] "It's very wonderful." ...|$|R
2500|$|On July 7, 2008, McCain {{criticized the}} {{traditional}} pay-as-you-go financing of Social Security, saying: [...] "Americans have <b>got</b> <b>to</b> <b>understand</b> {{that we are}} paying present-day retirees with the taxes paid by young workers in America today. And that's a disgrace." [...] The next day, he reiterated that Social Security uses current workers' tax payments to fund current retirees' benefits, and he said, [...] "That’s why it’s broken, that’s why we can fix it." ...|$|E
2500|$|Jonathan transcends into {{a society}} where all the gulls enjoy flying. He is only capable of this after {{practicing}} hard alone {{for a long time}} and the first learning process of linking the highly experienced teacher and the diligent student is raised into almost sacred levels. They, regardless of the all immense difference, are sharing something of great importance that can bind them together: [...] "You've <b>got</b> <b>to</b> <b>understand</b> that a seagull is an unlimited idea of freedom, an image of the Great Gull." [...] He realizes that you have to be true to yourself: [...] "You have the freedom to be yourself, your true self, here and now, and nothing can stand in your way." ...|$|E
2500|$|... "That's a funny story. I {{was with}} this fella down in Alices Springs and I'd been {{playing by the}} river. We were walking back when we noticed this mob of blackfellas in a circle about a hundred yards to our right. They motioned me to play without speaking. I sat down and played {{a little bit and}} they started laughing. I'd always had this {{reservation}} about my first encounter with top dog players and I thought they were rubbishing me, but with traditional black people communication always happens very slowly and that's how it was. After a while I <b>got</b> <b>to</b> <b>understand</b> that they were pleased at seeing it being played by a whitefella with his own spirit. Aboriginal people say I play walla walla didgeridu. very fast, attack style." ...|$|E
6000|$|His grip on {{her wrist}} tightened. From {{the other side of}} the door came the muffled sound of blows on the solid oak. 'Oh?' said Earl Dorm. 'You can't, eh? Well, listen <b>to</b> me.

5000|$|Kellaway {{played a}} wide variety of roles for Ken Hall, ranging from a gay floorwalker in Dad and Dave Come to Town (1938) to a magician in Let George Do It (1938). Hall wrote in his memoirs that the actor [...] "was never Alec Kellaway in any of them - a {{contrast}} to many actors, who play themselves in whatever part you give them. Alec always studied the part, <b>got</b> <b>to</b> really <b>understand</b> the person he was to play, then worried about how he would walk, talk, think." ...|$|R
500|$|Director Terry Gilliam would {{praise the}} film as [...] "a work of genius. It <b>got</b> people <b>to</b> <b>understand</b> what toys are about. They're true to their own character. And that's just brilliant. It's got a shot that's always stuck with me, when Buzz Lightyear discovers he's a toy. He's sitting on this landing {{at the top of}} the {{staircase}} and the camera pulls back and he's this tiny little figure. He was this guy with a massive ego two seconds before... and it's stunning. I'd put that as one of my top ten films, period." ...|$|R

6000|$|... "I means wot I says," [...] replied Joe, with a stern {{expression}} of countenance, as he relighted his pipe with the burnt {{end of a}} piece of stick. [...] "I means that it beats 'em both ways;--if ye haven't <b>got</b> schoolin' enough <b>to</b> <b>understand</b> plain English, you'd better go home again an' get your edicashun completed." ...|$|R
50|$|The {{resulting}} crisis {{threatened to}} bring about even more bloodshed. To defuse the situation, a young anthropologist, Donald Thomson, offered to investigate {{the causes of the}} conflict. He travelled to Arnhem Land, on a mission that many said would be suicidal, and <b>got</b> <b>to</b> know and <b>understand</b> the people who lived there. After a seven months’ investigation, he persuaded the Federal Government to free the three men convicted of the killings and returned with them to their own country, living for over a year with their people, documenting their culture.|$|R
6000|$|... "Settin' a {{fine example}} to the children," [...] Mr. Higginbotham snorted, suddenly, in the silence for which his wife was {{responsible}} and which he resented. Sometimes he almost wished she would oppose him more. [...] "If he does it again, he's <b>got</b> <b>to</b> get out. <b>Understand!</b> I won't put up with his shinanigan--debotchin' innocent children with his boozing." [...] Mr. Higginbotham liked the word, which was a new one in his vocabulary, recently gleaned from a newspaper column. [...] "That's what it is, debotchin'--there ain't no other name for it." ...|$|R
6000|$|After this I <b>got</b> <b>to</b> <b>understand</b> {{that when}} a Londoner says, [...] "Have you seen the Tower of London?" [...] the answer is, [...] "No, and neither have you." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "Well, we'll {{go through}} the rigmarole," [...] Power {{continued}} gruffly. [...] "We've <b>got</b> <b>to</b> <b>understand</b> one another. There's my cheque book in that safe. A million dollars if you leave this country--alone--within twenty-four hours, and stay away {{for the rest of}} your life." ...|$|E
6000|$|Having been thus introduced, Jack {{mounted the}} trunk of the fallen tree, and Makarooroo got up beside him to interpret. He began, like a wise diplomatist, by complimenting King Jambai, and spoke at some length on courage in general, and on the bravery of King Jambai's warriors in particular; which, of course, he took for granted. Then he came to particulars, and {{explained}} as much of his intended movements as he deemed it good for them to know; and wound up by saying that he had three words of command to teach them, which they must learn <b>to</b> <b>understand</b> and act upon that very night. They were, [...] "Forward!" [...] "Halt!" [...] and [...] "Fire!" [...] By saying the first of these words very slow and in a drawling voice, thus, [...] "Forw-a-a-a-a-a-rd!" [...] and the second in a quick, sharp tone, and the third in a ferocious yell that caused the whole band to start, he actually <b>got</b> them <b>to</b> <b>understand</b> and distinguish the difference between the commands, and to act upon them in the course of half an hour.|$|R
6000|$|... "Although {{knowing that}} Colonel Allen {{is in charge}} of this force, he [...] claimed the right to take command, and, so the {{corporal}} says, made [...] display of a commission signed by the Massachusetts Committee of [...] Safety, declaring that it entitled him to take charge of all the [...] troops. Now, although I'm not a soldier--the corporal says I never [...] will be--I've <b>got</b> sense enough <b>to</b> <b>understand</b> that if I enlisted under [...] Colonel Easton, and was willing he should give way to Colonel Allen so [...] we might have the Green Mountain Boys with us, the Massachusetts [...] Committee of Safety have <b>got</b> nothing <b>to</b> do with saying who shall lead [...] in the battle--though I hope to goodness we shan't see one.|$|R
6000|$|... "As long as I {{know that}} you understand," [...] he whispered. [...] "But of course you do. It's a great {{satisfaction}} <b>to</b> have <b>got</b> somebody <b>to</b> <b>understand.</b> You seem <b>to</b> have been there on purpose." [...] And in the same whisper, as if we two whenever we talked had to say things to each other which were not fit {{for the world to}} hear, he added, [...] "It's very wonderful." [...] We remained side by side talking in our secret way--but sometimes silent or just exchanging a whispered word or two at long intervals. And as usual he stared through the port. A breath of wind came now and again into our faces. The ship might have been moored in dock, so gently and on an even keel she slipped through the water, that did not murmur even at our passage, shadowy and silent like a phantom sea.|$|R
60|$|FANNY [flares up]. Look here, uncle, you and I have <b>got</b> <b>to</b> <b>understand</b> one another. I may put up {{with being}} bullied myself--if I can't see any help for it--but I'm {{not going to stand}} my friends being insulted. You show Mr. Newte up here.|$|E
6000|$|She whirled away {{toward the}} stairs, {{but her father}} caught her by the arm. [...] "Marcia!" [...] he shouted, in his old raucous voice, [...] "You've <b>got</b> <b>to</b> <b>understand!</b> This"--he hesitated, as if running over all terms of opprobrium in his mind, and he resumed {{as if he had}} found them each too feeble--"Bartley hasn't acted under any mistake." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Toto isn't a brute," [...] replied Dorothy; [...] "but at home Uncle Henry has to whip him {{sometimes}} for chasing the chickens. Now, look here, Toto," [...] she added, holding up her finger and speaking sternly to him, [...] "you've <b>got</b> <b>to</b> <b>understand</b> that Billina {{is one of}} my dearest friends, and mustn't be hurt--now or ever." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Look here, Lou," [...] he said quietly, [...] "I have <b>got</b> <b>to</b> go and that's {{all about}} it. I have <b>got</b> <b>to,</b> do you <b>understand?</b> The {{consequences}} of this crime cannot be faced--not by any one--not by me. There's Uncle Rad to think of first. He is broken and ill; {{he has more than}} one foot in the grave. The trial and the scandal couldn't be kept from him; it would be bound to leak out sooner or later. It would be too big a scandal, and it would kill him outright. Then, you see, Lou, it would never do! I should be Earl of Radclyffe and a felon--it wouldn't do, now would it? Who has ever heard of a peer undergoing a life sentence--or being hanged? It wouldn't do--you know it wouldn't do----" ...|$|R

6000|$|... "She <b>got</b> me <b>to</b> <b>understand</b> {{that she}} knew where she was; that the current set {{westerly}} along shore and in two hours would drift us abreast of a spot where we could land. I swear I either slept or was unconscious most of those two hours; and I swear she was in one state or the other when I chanced to come to and noted {{the absence of the}} roar of the surf. Then {{it was my turn to}} claw and maul her back to consciousness. It was three hours more before we made the sand. We slept where we crawled out of the water. Next morning's sun burnt us awake, and we crept into the shade of some wild bananas, found fresh water, and went to sleep again. Next I awoke it was night. I took another drink, and slept through till morning. She was still asleep when the bunch of kanakas, hunting wild goats from the next valley, found us." ...|$|R
