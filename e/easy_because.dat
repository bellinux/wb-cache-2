5|$|According to Cooney and O'Dell, the 1980s were a {{problematic}} {{period for the}} Workshop. Other than Sesame Street, many of its productions were not successful. 3-2-1 Contact premiered during 1980, and were broadcast in various forms until 1988. The CTW found that finding funding for this series and other science-oriented series like Square One Television, which was broadcast from 1987 to 1992, was <b>easy</b> <b>because</b> the National Science Foundation and other foundations were interested in funding science education. A series of poor investments in video games, motion picture production, theme parks, and other business ventures hurt the organization financially. Cooney brought in Bill Whaley during the late 1970s {{to work on their}} licensing agreements, but he was unable to compensate for the CTW's losses until 1986, when licensing revenues stabilized and its portfolio investments increased.|$|E
5|$|After being {{stripped}} of the victory in previous year's race {{because of an}} underweight car, Audi Sport ABT team principal Hans-Jurgen Abt said his team's objective was to get onto the podium. He acknowledged that getting the victory would not be <b>easy</b> <b>because</b> of the competitiveness of the field. After retiring from the preceding Buenos Aires ePrix, Bird stated that he would enter the Mexico City race with a positive attitude and affirmed his belief in his team and he felt {{there was a possibility}} of getting onto the podium in the event they perform well in qualifying. Mitch Evans reiterated that despite his team Jaguar not scoring points in the season's opening three races, the Buenos Aires race showed that he was becoming more confident and wanted to carry over his momentum from the four-month break. He also said he was excited to compete in the Mexico City event.|$|E

25|$|Until 1911, Prime Ministers had {{to guide}} {{legislation}} through the Commons and the Lords and obtain majority approval {{in both houses}} for it to become law. This was not always <b>easy,</b> <b>because</b> political differences often separated the chambers. Representing the landed aristocracy, Lords Temporal were generally Tory (later Conservative) who wanted {{to maintain the status}} quo and resisted progressive measures such as extending the franchise. The party affiliation of members of the Commons was less predictable. During the 18th century its makeup varied because the Lords had considerable control over elections: sometimes Whigs dominated it, sometimes Tories. After the passage of the Great Reform Bill in 1832, the Commons gradually became more progressive, a tendency that increased with the passage of each subsequent expansion of the franchise.|$|E
25|$|Ingle was a well-liked captain, {{according}} to David Foot's history of Somerset cricket, and unlike some Somerset amateurs got on {{well with the}} limited numbers of professionals the county employed. The life of a Somerset captain in the inter-war years was rarely <b>easy,</b> <b>because</b> the county rarely had {{more than half a}} dozen professionals, and the team was perennially made up of an itinerant band of amateurs of variable talent. In one of Ingle's more successful seasons, 1936, Somerset played 34 different cricketers in the County Championship matches. Ingle himself missed some games most seasons because of chronic hay fever which, {{according to}} Foot, he maintained was made worse by long train journeys: he told Foot that he would travel in the luggage rack to get some sleep and some respite from the dust.|$|E

25|$|However, {{the appalling}} summer of 1924 brought a setback with Staples {{averaging}} 23 runs a wicket on very favourable pitches. In 1925, though his average was {{much higher than}} the other Nottinghamshire bowlers (Richmond, Larwood and Barratt) his workload was a vital factor in the team's success, and this trend continued throughout 1926, when Staples took 113 wickets. 1927, with Nottinghamshire missing the Championship due to a remarkable loss in their last game to previously winless Glamorgan, saw Staples have his best season with 132 wickets including 9 for 141 against Kent in a game where Carr put Kent into bat but the pitch proved <b>easy.</b> <b>Because</b> the matting wickets were suited to a medium-paced, but flat trajectory, off-spinner like Staples, he was chosen to visit South Africa but did only moderately. However, in 1928 Staples bowled so well that his persistence and accuracy were seen as great assets on the cast-iron Australian pitches, but illness prevented him touring and restricted his cricket somewhat in 1929, when he only just reached 100 wickets.|$|E

[...] "It made quarterbacking so <b>easy</b> <b>because</b> I just get in the huddle and call anything and you have three Hall of Fame running backs ready to carry the ball," [...] Tittle reminisced in 2006. The team had aspirations for a championship run, but injuries, including McElhenny's separated shoulder in the sixth game of the season, ended those hopes and the 49ers {{finished third in the}} Western Division. Tittle starred in his second straight Pro Bowl appearance as he threw two touchdown passes, including one to 49ers teammate Billy Wilson, who was named the game's MVP.|$|E

[...] In December 2011, Timberlake admitted that he had written [...] "Cry Me a River" [...] after an argument with Spears: [...] "I was on a phone call that was not the most enjoyable phone call.

She told the teenager that she must be polite to the servants, who looked after her well and did their best for her, and she should not make her nurse [...] "nervous" [...] when she was tired and not feeling well. Olga responded on January 12, 1909 that she would try to do better but it wasn't <b>easy</b> <b>because</b> her nurse became angry and cross with her for no good reason. However, Ersberg, one of the maids, told her niece that the servants sometimes {{had good reason to}} be cross with Olga because the eldest grand duchess could be spoiled, capricious, and lazy.

Nevertheless, he was happy that he had begun the new season with a victory after having ended the previous campaign badly. He later confessed that luck played a role in him securing the win as his car was not set-up to his preferences but reserved praise to his strategist. Second-place finisher di Grassi spoke of his delight with the result and that his race had been [...] "crazy" [...] which demonstrated that this team they did not stop and it was [...] "a great start" [...] to his season. He praised his mechanics for helping him remain on the same lap as the leaders and believed that he was targeting the fastest lap award but his team instructed him to keep pushing. Heidfeld, who finished in third, stated that he was happy to achieve a podium position in the first race of the season and hoped that his team could finish their forward progress in the championship.|$|E
500|$|Suppose Crusoe {{decides to}} stop being a {{producer}} and consumer simultaneously. He decides he will produce one day and consume the next. His two roles of consumer and producer are being split up and studied separately to understand the elementary form of consumer theory and producer theory in microeconomics. For dividing his time between being a consumer and producer, he must set up two collectively exhaustive markets, the coconut market and the labour market. He also sets up a firm, of which he becomes the sole shareholder. The firm will want to maximise profits by deciding how much labour to hire and how many coconuts to produce according to their prices. As a worker of the firm, Crusoe will collect wages, as a shareholder, he will collect profits and as a consumer, he will decide {{how much of the}} firm's output to purchase according to his income and the prevailing market prices. Let's assume that a currency called [...] "Dollars" [...] has been created by Robinson to manage his finances. For simplicity, assume that PriceCoconuts = $1.00.

Fässler said it had been [...] "a riveting race" [...] and the slower traffic made it more unpredictable. Tréluyer described the win as [...] "the best way to open a season as you can imagine." [...] Jani felt he would have had a possibility to challenge for the victory had he not been delayed by his late-race puncture. Dumas was satisfied with his early race battle with Jarvis and revealed that Porsche's target was to remain with their rivals. Sarrazin stated although his team still need improvements they were already closer than they had been the previous season and they were motivated to battle {{at the front of the}} field. Conway said the team's result was a [...] "a cool way to start the year" [...] but had not been <b>easy</b> <b>because</b> Toyota still needed to work on their car's pace to get closer to their opposition. Kobayashi said his first race in LMP1 was [...] "a positive start" [...] and was excited about the No. 6 car's development.|$|E
500|$|The Martian was {{directed}} by Scott and based on a screenplay by Drew Goddard that was adapted from Weir's 2011 novel of same name. 20th Century Fox optioned the novel in March 2013, and producer Simon Kinberg was attached to develop the novel into a film. The following May, Goddard entered negotiations with the studio to write and direct The Martian. Goddard wrote a screenplay for the film, and Matt Damon expressed interest in starring under Goddard's direction. Goddard then pursued an opportunity to direct Sinister Six, a comic book film about a team of supervillains. Kinberg then brought the book to Scott's attention. In May 2014, Scott entered negotiations with the studio to direct the film with Damon cast as the film's stranded astronaut. Scott said he was attracted by the emphasis on science and thought a balance could be struck between entertainment and learning. Damon said he was attracted by the novel, the screenplay {{and the opportunity to}} work with Scott. Following Scott's commitment, the project picked up the pace and was quickly approved.

500|$|For three seasons, {{the backfield}} {{challenged}} opposing defenses with Tittle's arm, Johnson's power, {{the speed of}} Perry, and the elusiveness of McElhenny. [...] "There was no greater running backs than Hugh McElhenny, John Henry Johnson and Joe Perry in the same backfield," [...] Tittle reminisced. [...] "It made quarterbacking so <b>easy</b> <b>because</b> I just get in the huddle and call anything and you have three Hall of Fame running backs ready to carry the ball." [...] They achieved their greatest success during their first year together, in 1954, in which they shattered the team record for rushing yards in a season. The 49ers led the league with 2,498 rushing yards and 28 rushing touchdowns, and averaged 5.7 yards per carry and 208.2 rushing yards per game. Perry, McElhenny, and Johnson each finished the season in the top ten in rushing yards, with Perry and Johnson finishing first and second, respectively. McElhenny ranked eighth despite playing in only six games before being sidelined by a season-ending shoulder injury. Tittle, Perry, Johnson, and Detroit Lions halfback Doak Walker comprised the starting backfield in the 1955 Pro Bowl, and Perry was deemed the NFL's Player of the Year by the United Press. With the highly potent offense, many thought San Francisco was due to win a NFL championship, but defensive problems landed the 49ers in third place behind the Lions and Bears in 1954. Moreover, the offense struggled after McElhenny's injury.|$|E
