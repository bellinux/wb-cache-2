As a result, the <b>insurance</b> <b>period</b> and other {{variables}} {{occurring in the}} pension formula are known exactly {{at the point of}} retirement, which makes it possible to perform exact modelling of pension formula non-linearities in extreme lines, see e.g. ("Pojistné rozpravy 28/2011").|$|E
30|$|It {{takes longer}} to process cross-national pension {{applications}} than national pensions. Frequent delays occur during {{the confirmation of}} the extent of <b>insurance</b> <b>periods</b> in Morocco and Turkey, as local institutions must generate individual insurance data from documents provided in paper form by regional offices. The list of <b>insurance</b> <b>periods</b> is collected only at the time of a pension application, and account clearances with yearly entitlement announcements do not exist. Thus, for example, the pension application for the Austrian or German part is processed very quickly as the domestic insurance file is essentially ready at the time of application, but in Turkey, the process may take many months (for details see Holzmann et al. 2016 a, 2016 b). Similar experiences are also reported for the west corridors.|$|R

30|$|The {{processing}} of an application from Morocco and Turkey with <b>insurance</b> <b>periods</b> in Europe only is facilitated by full informatization of insurance records {{in most of}} these countries. As a result, applications to the east corridor countries once received by postal communication can be responded in normal cases, by Austria and Germany, with a preliminary approval within days and a definite approval within weeks. If additional written records are required (as may be the case in the western corridor countries), the weeks will become months. If <b>insurance</b> <b>periods</b> were acquired in the sending countries before or after returning home, then their collection and verification can be time-consuming, particularly if the date of birth or name is unclear. If benefit information from the sending country is required to establish totalization or the level of top-ups when residing in the host country, the delay can be substantial as is the loss of benefit disbursement or delayed payment of top-ups.|$|R

50|$|Simplification or {{averaging}} {{is necessary}} in cases where non-linear life path dependencies occur in the pension formula (e.g. minimum pension, minimum numbers of years of work, etc.). Some extreme situations can be addressed by establishing a new status, but that makes the model more complex and again, the calculation is only approximate. With proper availability of data, {{it is possible to}} use the whole structure for selected parameters (primarily <b>insurance</b> <b>period),</b> but it is both calculation- and memory-consuming.|$|E
50|$|Care {{services}} in elderly care centres were compensated additionally. Furthermore, {{the claim of}} the short-term care was also raised gradually in care level III and in cases of hardship. Short-term care for children needing help from institutions for the disabled expanded. Benefits for day and night care were improved, higher subsidies were offered, and performances got index-linked. Also, the <b>insurance</b> <b>period</b> has been shortened to two years. In addition, care funds had a shortened review period so they must provide results within five weeks to the submitted application. For a hospital stay, the review period has to occur by the medical service of health insurance within a week.|$|E

30|$|The host institution/country has an {{incentive}} to avoid any responsibility for pension payment as this triggers full responsibility for health care outlays. This {{is the case in}} Turkey, where current or former Turkish nationals may cover <b>insurance</b> <b>periods</b> outside Turkey with an additional voluntary lump-sum contribution payment upon return to the social insurance pension scheme. Turkey claims that this payment is for life insurance and thus does not trigger health care responsibility, but this position is reportedly under consideration.|$|R
50|$|Transfers between statuses (e.g. between employment, unemployment, {{exit from}} the labour market, etc.) are all {{modelled}} simultaneously. The life path of one modelled individual or group of individuals gradually branches out. The result (e.g. <b>insurance</b> <b>period,</b> newly awarded pension) is achieved by averaging across all life paths. In such case {{it is not possible}} to explore extreme life paths and it is also not possible to satisfactorily identify e.g. the number of pensioners threatened by poverty. With a large number of model points, the model is only able to identify a poverty threat caused by a low income. A poverty threat caused by interrupting the work career (insufficiently long period of insurance) cannot be modelled without additional information and adjustments made to the model.|$|E
40|$|This paper {{critically}} {{discusses the}} proposals by the Law Commission of England and Wales and the Scottish Law Commission for {{reform of the}} law of warranties, examines the doctrine of alteration of risk as an alternative approach for risk management during the <b>insurance</b> <b>period,</b> and considers the possibility for the promissory warranty to be replaced by the doctrine of alteration of risk. It is argued that the Law Commissionsâ�� proposals for reform of the law are insufficient in terms of mitigating the harshness and unfairness of remedies for breach of warranty. The remedies in the doctrine of alteration of risk are much fairer than those for breach of a warranty. An appropriate model to deal with increase of risk during <b>insurance</b> <b>period</b> is proposed...|$|E
40|$|We {{analyze the}} effect of deposit {{insurance}} on the risk-taking behavior of banks {{in the context of}} a quasi-natural experiment using detailed credit registry data. Using the case of an emerging economy, Bolivia, which introduced a deposit insurance system during the sample period, we compare the risk-taking behavior of banks before and after the introduction of this system. We find that in the post-deposit <b>insurance</b> <b>period,</b> banks are more likely to initiate riskier loans (i. e., loans with worse internal ratings at origination). These loans carry higher interest rates and are associated with worse ex-post performance (i. e., they have higher default and delinquency rates). Banks do not seem to compensate for the extra risk by increasing collateral requirements or decreasing loan maturities. We also find evidence that the increase in risk-taking is due to the decrease in market discipline from large depositors. Finally, differences between large (too-big-to-fail) and small banks diminished in the post-deposit <b>insurance</b> <b>period.</b> ...|$|E

30|$|The pseudo {{insurance}} {{nature of}} benefit determination, {{which does not}} allow a straightforward split of acquired rights into (i) a contemporaneous insurance component that is consumed in any period and hence incurs no portability issue; (ii) a pre-savings component that all benefits have to some extent {{and that could be}} made portable if its value could be easily established; and (iii) a redistributive component within and between benefit cohorts that can be huge (as in the case of traditional defined pension benefit schemes or health care benefits based on income-related contributions). The redistributive character of benefits is responsible for long vesting periods that internationally mobile workers may not fulfill in a single country but could easily if the <b>insurance</b> <b>periods</b> in all countries were added up (that is, totalized).|$|R
30|$|The {{timeliness}} of {{the benefit}} calculation depends on how records of <b>insurance</b> <b>periods</b> are prepared within individual schemes and on the presence or degree of electronic exchange between schemes. Timely preparation and electronic exchange exist in Austria and Germany, are absent in Belgium and France, and are also lacking in Turkey and Morocco. In the latter two countries, information is only put on paper when an application arrives and the exchange between the different funds also takes place in paper form. This substantially lengthens the application process. Turkey plans to apply an electronic format as of 2017. No plans for electronic exchange exist in Morocco. However, since 2013, Caisse Nationale de Securite Sociale (CNSS) has developed electronic forms, for instance, for birth and death certificates. Thus, electronic formats have been partially implemented in Morocco (CNSS) but not to facilitate portability.|$|R

40|$|AbstractThis study {{investigates the}} {{performance}} of a flexible index design for weather index-based insurances using farm-level panel data on wheat production from Kazakhstan. The proposed flexible design is a generic framework that uses Growing Degree Days to determine annual variable start and end dates for the insured period. This approach reflects the progress of phenological plant growth phases more accurately than fixed periods and hence is expected to reduce the basis risk of the index insurance. In addition, we develop an economic framework that focuses on the role of downside risks and apply Quantile Regression to tailor optimal insurance specifications. This framework is then used to compare the downside risks {{associated with the use of}} flexible and fixed <b>insurance</b> <b>periods.</b> The results show that the introduction of flexibility in the index design leads to a reduction in farmers’ downside risk exposure and to a more efficient contract design...|$|R

40|$|The {{paper to}} be {{presented}} discusses the default in policy coordination or harmonisation in European Social Policy and the emerging private cost borne by migrating individuals. The different designs of national social security schemes imply administrative hurdles and incompatibilities. The latter may also discourage labour movements between EU - countries since migration could bring about a reduction or a loss of social security rights acquired {{on the basis of}} past employment and past contributions. The access to new benefits may be hampered as long as some national social security insurance programs demand a minimum coverage period as a prerequisite for benefit claims and disregard preceding <b>insurance</b> <b>periods</b> in other countries. Taking present EU law into account, we design case studies to identify barriers to entry resp. to exit for individuals or households when migrating from one social security scheme to another. Within these scenarios, movements between national systems in Bismarckian tradition and Beveridge systems are of great interest.

3000|$|The Danish UI {{system is}} {{specifically}} designed {{in terms of}} relatively short “passive” income <b>insurance</b> <b>periods,</b> after which activation is {{the rule of the}} game. This is sometimes referred to as the “right-and-duty-principle” (or the “mutual obligation principle”). The idea is that an unemployed job seeker has the right to assistance in the form of income insurance, placement services, and (if necessary) skills upgrading, {{but at the same time}} a duty to participate in ALMP’s and other activities when offered. If the claimant is below 30 years, the “passive” period is limited to 3 months; for older job seekers it is 9 months. Existing evidence indicates that many job seekers find work as they approach the end of the “passive” period. 4 Geerdsen and Holm (2007), for example, who take advantage of legislative changes in the lengths of the passive and active periods to identify their causal effects, show that the threat effect of activation is considerable. According to their estimates, a 50 percentage point increase in the risk of program enrolment results in an approximately 50 percent increase in the hazard out of unemployment. Rosholm and Svarer (2008) report similar findings, although they also identify a tendency for the threat effects to decrease with the duration of unemployment. 5 [...]...|$|R
