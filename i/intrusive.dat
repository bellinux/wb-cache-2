40|$|Metamorphosed {{dolerite}} <b>intrusives</b> in ultramafic tectonites, cumulates, and metagabbros {{are first}} described from the Western Zone of the Hidaka Metamorphic Belt. The dolerite <b>intrusives</b> {{ranging from a}} few cm to 30 m in thickness occur as a dyke or sheet. Most of the dolerite <b>intrusives</b> are metamorphosed into amphibolite or metadolerite in various degrees. The metamorphic grade attains generally up to the amphibolite facies, and partly to the hornblende granulite facies in the ultramafic tectonites. Primary textures and minerals are well preserved in some metamorphosed <b>intrusives.</b> After mylonitization of the ultramafic tectonite the dolerite magma is considered to have intruded into the tectonites and into the already consolidated cumulate and gabbro complexes. Petrochemical and mineralogical data indicate {{that all of the}} dolerite <b>intrusives</b> are co-magmatic and are formed by crystallization of an olivine tholeiite magma which is highly undersaturated in silica and less differentiated...|$|R
40|$|During {{crystallization}} of a granitic magma, copper {{is shown}} to prefer octahedral sites, be they in the melt or in crystalline phases. Burns and Fyœe (1964) showed that the AleOa/(KeOq- Na. _,O q-CaO) ratio of the magma {{is proportional to the}} number of octahedral sites available in the melt. A relatively large alumina/alkali ratio will mean more octahedral sites in the melt, a higher retention of copper in the melt, and, thus, a greater likelihood of porphyry-type mineralization, as the copper will still be in the melt at the hydrothermal stage. A comparison of this alumina/alkali ratio for mineralized and barren <b>intrusives</b> in the southwestern U. S. porphyry belt and in the Caribbean indicates that this relationship holds true. Generally speaking, for Laramide <b>intrusives,</b> mineralized stocks have a normative corundum content 2. 5 weight percent greater than that of barren <b>intrusives.</b> This result suggests that in composite <b>intrusives</b> the more aluminous ones are better targets for porphyry mineralization and that early formed ferromagnesian minerals from mineralized <b>intrusives</b> should be copper deficient compared to barren systems (Kesler et al., 1975 a) ...|$|R

According to Pappe, it was an attempt to reinforce the Syrian front in face of Muhammad Ali's invasion. Two years later, Palestine was conquered by Muhammad Ali's Egypt, but Egyptian rule was challenged in 1834 by a countrywide popular uprising against conscription and other measures considered <b>intrusive</b> by the population.

5|$|Metagreywackes and metapelites {{from two}} areas {{traversing}} {{one of these}} aureoles near Yellowknife have been studied. Most of the Slave province rocks are granitic with metamorphosed Yellowknife metasedimentary and volcanic rocks. Isotopic ages of these rocks is around , {{the time of the}} Kenoran orogeny. Rocks comprising the Slave province represent a high grade of metamorphism, intrusion and basement remobilization typical of Archean terranes. Migmatites, batholithic <b>intrusive</b> and granulitic metamorphic rocks show foliation and compositional banding; the rocks are uniformly hard and so thoroughly deformed that little foliation exists.

5|$|Silverthrone {{is part of}} the Pemberton Volcanic Belt, {{which is}} {{circumscribed}} by a group of epizonal intrusions. At another deeply eroded caldera complex called Franklin Glacier Volcano, the Pemberton Volcanic Belt merges with the Garibaldi Volcanic Belt, a northwest-trending belt of volcanic cones and fields extending from near the Canada–United States border east of Vancouver on the British Columbia Coast. The intrusions are thought to be subvolcanic bodies associated with a volcanic front that was active in the Miocene, during early stages of subduction of the Juan de Fuca Plate. With the notable exception of King Island, all the <b>intrusive</b> and eruptive rocks are calc-alkaline, mainly granodioritic bodies and dacite ejecta.|$|E

The near-circular structure of 1. 13 km diameter exhibits a well-preserved, uptilted granite rim.

The coincidence of the spacial occurrence of the crater with respect to various alkaline and ultramafic <b>intrusives</b> has been the main argument put for yard against an impact origin for the structure. Detailed mapping of the crater rim exposures and the crater environs was carried out and revealed many occurrences of <b>intrusives</b> in the whole region.

5|$|Because {{molecular}} diagnostics {{methods can}} detect sensitive markers, these tests are less <b>intrusive</b> than a traditional biopsy. For example, because cell-free nucleic acids exist in human plasma, a simple blood sample can {{be enough to}} sample genetic information from tumours, transplants or an unborn fetus.

The detection of the marker might use real time PCR, direct sequencing, or microarray chipsprefabricated chips that test many markers at once. The same principle applies to the proteome and the genome. High-throughput protein arrays can use complementary DNA or antibodies to bind and hence can detect many different proteins in parallel.|$|E

5|$|Ficus rubiginosa {{was first}} {{cultivated}} in the United Kingdom in 1789, {{where it is}} grown in glasshouses. It is commonly used as a large ornamental tree in eastern Australia, in the North Island of New Zealand, and also in Hawaii and California, where it is also listed as an invasive species in some areas. It is useful as a shade tree in public parks and on golf courses. Not as prodigious as other figs, F. rubiginosa is suited to slightly more confined areas, such as lining car parks or suburban streets. However, surface roots can be large and <b>intrusive</b> and the thin bark readily damaged when struck. Tolerant of acid or alkaline soils, it is hardy to US Hardiness Zones 10B and 11, reaching 10m (35ft) high in 30 years. Planting trees 8–12m (30–40ft) apart will eventually result in a continuous canopy. The trees are of great value in providing fruit for birds and mammals, though drop large quantities of fruit and leaves, leaving a mess underfoot.|$|E

40|$|The Barrington Tops Batholith (BTB) is an Early Permian, granodioritic suite intruding the Tamworth Belt in the Southern New England Fold Belt (SNEFB), {{as shown}} in Fig. 1. It is {{composed}} of three plutons of two comagmatic compositions: the two larger plutons, Omadale Brook and Barrington River, are augitehypersthene granodiorite, while the Gummi Plain pluton, to the north-east is a hornblende-biotite granodiorite (Mason and Kaverlieris 1984; Eggins and Hensen 1987). In addition to the granodiorites, Eggins (1984) notes the presence of several phases of dyke and stock intrusion. Two phases of mafic dykes {{are associated with the}} plutons, one intruding before the plutons, and one after. In addition, aplitic and microgranodioritic dykes of similar mineralogy to the main suite are known. These felsic <b>intrusives</b> are noted on the margins of the intrusions and are seen in both the granodiorites and their surrounding aureole.
