25|$|To {{achieve a}} {{low-cost}} net shape forging for demanding applications that {{are subject to}} {{a high degree of}} scrutiny, i.e. non-destructive testing by way of a <b>dye-penetrant</b> <b>inspection</b> technique, it is crucial that basic forging process disciplines be implemented. If the basic disciplines are not met, subsequent material removal operations will likely be necessary to remove material defects found at non-destructive testing inspection. Hence low-cost parts will not be achievable.|$|E
40|$|This paper {{examines}} the problems encountered {{in assessing the}} reliability of <b>dye-penetrant</b> nondestructive <b>inspection</b> (NDI) techniques in preventing failures due to undetected surface flaws, {{as well as from}} flaw acceptance (Fitness-For-Purpose). A Monte Carlo simulation procedure which includes the major variables of the problem is presented as a means of quantifying reliability. Some issues associated with distribution selection are examined. A methodology for selecting the penetrant type and flaw acceptance size for the specific components analyzed using the simulation is proposed. Current methodology limitations are discussed along with possible future effort. Penetrant selection and acceptable sizes of detected flaws are based on a probabilistic assessment of the effect of component and dye-penetrant system variables on structural reliability...|$|R
