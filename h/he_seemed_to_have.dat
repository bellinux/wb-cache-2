5|$|During {{the early}} months of 1930 Aiello {{arranged}} several unsuccessful assassination attempts against Capone bodyguards, including Jack McGurn, Phil D'Andrea and Rocco De Grazia. Aiello hoped to leave Capone vulnerable by depleting his security, and Capone began to suspect Aiello had spies within the Chicago Outfit because <b>he</b> <b>seemed</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> inside knowledge about where his targets would be and when. In August 1930, two months before Aiello's death, the state's attorney conducted a raid on Aiello's home, obtaining records as part of a series of raids by the United States government to fight against gangland activities in Chicago.|$|E
5|$|On May 7, 2010, a Brendan Casey (also {{known as}} scient) {{released}} an unofficial patch, which fixes bugs in Alpha Centauri. His project began in February 2009 at Apolyton's Alpha Centauri site, {{and moved in}} June 2009 to the Civilization Gaming Network, where he planned to continue developing further patch versions. <b>He</b> <b>seemed</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> resumed work in March 2013 at the http://alphacentauri2.info fan site. Currently, the subsequent patches of other modders generally build upon scient's original 1.0 patch. There is a graphics update, Artificial Intelligence update, and an additional modifications patch amongst others there.|$|E
5|$|Djedkare {{was buried}} in a pyramid in Saqqara named Nefer Djedkare ("Djedkare is perfect"), which is now ruined owing to theft of stone from its outer casing during antiquity. The burial chamber still held Djedkare's mummy when it was {{excavated}} in the 1940s. Examinations of the mummy revealed that he died in his fifties. Following his death, Djedkare was {{the object of a}} cult that lasted at least {{until the end of the}} Old Kingdom. <b>He</b> <b>seemed</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> been held in particularly high esteem during the mid-Sixth Dynasty, whose pharaohs lavished rich offerings on his cult. Archaeological evidence suggests the continuing existence of this funerary cult throughout the much later New Kingdom period (c. 1550–1077 BC). Djedkare was also remembered by the Ancient Egyptians as the king of vizier Ptahhotep, the purported author of The Maxims of Ptahhotep, one of the earliest pieces of philosophic wisdom literature.|$|E

5|$|During the 2013 preseason, Hemingway led the Chiefs in receptions and touchdowns. <b>He</b> <b>seemed</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> {{moved into}} the fourth wide {{receiver}} position behind Dwayne Bowe, Donnie Avery, and Dexter McCluster. In the 2013 Chiefs season opener, he caught a touchdown against the Jacksonville Jaguars, who had his college freshman season quarterback Chad Henne and his redshirt senior season quarterback Denard Robinson on their roster. The reception, which came from Alex Smith, was Hemingway's first in the NFL. Hemingway had a three-reception game that included the game's opening score on December 1 against the Denver Broncos. In {{the final game of}} the season, he had 5 receptions for 45 yards, giving him 13 receptions and 125 yards for the season. Hemingway also posted 2 receptions for the Chiefs in the 2013–14 NFL playoffs against Indianapolis.|$|E
5|$|From Ravenna, Diocletian {{left for}} the Danube. There, {{possibly}} in Galerius' company, he {{took part in a}} campaign against the Carpi. He contracted a minor illness while on campaign, but his condition quickly worsened and he chose to travel in a litter. In the late summer he left for Nicomedia. On 20 November, he appeared in public to dedicate the opening of the circus beside his palace. He collapsed soon after the ceremonies. Over the winter of 304–5 he kept within his palace at all times. Rumors alleging that Diocletian's death was merely being kept secret until Galerius could come to assume power spread through the city. On 13 December, <b>he</b> <b>seemed</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> finally died. The city was sent into a mourning from which it was only retrieved by public declarations of his survival. When Diocletian reappeared in public on 1 March 305, he was emaciated and barely recognizable.|$|E
5|$|Orme and La Fleche {{met again}} in the Gordon Stakes at Goodwood with two other opponents, Watercress and Royal Harry. Starting favourite, Orme had La Fleche in trouble {{with more than a}} quarter of a mile still to run. <b>He</b> <b>seemed</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> the race won, but then veered left forcing Morny Cannon to pull him back and {{allowing}} La Fleche to draw level. However Orme pulled away again and won by a neck, with Watercress a further six lengths back in third. Orme's final race came in the Limekiln Stakes where he had to carry 10 stone. He finished second to Childwick, who was receiving 33 pounds. During the autumn Orme's legs had started to give him trouble and during the Limekiln a suspensory ligament gave way. This injury brought an end to his racing career, and he was retired to stud. Throughout his racing career he won a total of £32,528 in prize money.|$|E

5|$|Immediately {{following}} {{the cancellation of}} county cricket in 1914, Fender enlisted in the army, joining the Inns of Court Regiment. Commissioned as a lieutenant in the Royal Fusiliers, Fender disliked the routine of army life. With {{the help of the}} cricketer Pelham Warner, who worked in the War Office, he was transferred to the Royal Flying Corps in 1915. Fender was initially stationed in London, where he was involved in work repelling Zeppelin attacks, before being sent to India in 1916. Soon after his arrival, he became ill with dysentery, possibly cholera and several other diseases. He returned to England to recover but was left weak for much of the following two years. Army doctors were unsure what exactly was wrong with Fender and he remained in their care until 1918. He played some charity cricket in 1917 and 1918, but did not return to light duties with the Royal Flying Corps until the latter year. Just as <b>he</b> <b>seemed</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> recovered fully, he fractured his left leg in five places playing football at the end of 1918. He remained on crutches throughout the remainder of 1918 and 1919, missing the resumption of county cricket in 1919. While incapacitated, Fender attempted to gain a place at Caius College, Cambridge, but was turned down owing to the restriction his injury placed upon his cricket, and his desire to concentrate on academic interests to further his business career—the interviewing panel only wanted him as a cricketer. Although he recovered in time to play in the 1920 season, his leg troubled him for the remainder of his career; he was left with a minor limp, and long spells of fielding left him in pain.|$|E

25|$|These results {{caught the}} eye of Count Domenico Agusta who signed Agostini to ride for his MV Agusta squad as Mike Hailwood's teammate. Agostini then fought a season-long battle with Honda's Jim Redman for the 1965 350cc world championship. <b>He</b> <b>seemed</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> the title won when he led the final round in Japan at Suzuka when his bike failed him, handing the title to Redman.|$|E

25|$|Hostage Martin Cherry, an old {{platelayer}} of the district, {{was found}} dying from a groin {{wound in the}} outhouse or kitchen, immediately behind the main building. He was promptly taken from the burning hotel and laid on the ground, where Father Gibney administered the last sacrament. Cherry was insensible, and barely alive. He succumbed within half an hour. He was fortunate to not have burned alive. <b>He</b> <b>seemed</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> been unintentionally shot by the attacking force.|$|E
25|$|One night, Pu Tong Seal {{was very}} tired from his all-day journey on foot, {{and began to}} fall asleep in the jungle. The moment he dozed off, a tiger {{attacked}} him. <b>He</b> <b>seemed</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> a sixth sense, even when resting. The warlord never took chances, day or night, but was always alert for the unexpected ambush whether by human or animal. He bent the tiger's body so hard that the spinal cord broke, and the tiger died on the spot.|$|E
25|$|Even {{after the}} FA Cup final {{victory in the}} {{previous}} season, some still had doubts about Ferguson's ability to succeed where all the other managers since Matt Busby had failed– to win the league title. They were runners-up in the League Cup, losing 1–0 to Sheffield Wednesday. They also reached {{the final of the}} European Cup Winners' Cup, beating that season's Spanish champions Barcelona 2–1. After the match, Ferguson vowed that United would win the league the following season, and at long last <b>he</b> <b>seemed</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> won over the last of his sceptics after nearly five years in the job.|$|E

25|$|As in {{the case}} in World War I, Hillman used the {{influence}} of the federal government to advance both labor's social goals and its immediate organizing needs. Hillman was not able to persuade the Board to debar labor law violators, but did help introduce arbitration as an alternative to strikes in defense industries. At times, however, Hillman identified so closely with the government that <b>he</b> <b>seemed</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> lost sight of his roots in the labor movement; his denunciation of the UAW members who struck North American Aviation in 1941, only to face troops sent by the Roosevelt administration to guard the plant, brought down a great deal of criticism from others within the CIO.|$|E
25|$|Comín {{appreciated}} Larramendi following {{works of}} the Zaragoza group; he suggested that the Madrid lawyer becomes his replacement. Don Jaime acknowledged Larramendi’s loyalty during the strife for control of El Correo. Moreover, as a young militant deprived of own political basis <b>he</b> <b>seemed</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> posed no threat to royal leadership; his location in Madrid and profession of a lawyer offered additional advantages. Lack of experience was a disadvantage; Melgar dissuaded the choice also due to pro-German Larramendi’s leaning during the war. Don Jaime’s special envoy to Madrid returned with good news and in August 1919 the claimant appointed Larramendi his key representative in Spain and effectively the party leader, though not with the title of Jefe Delegado, but as a Secretario General.|$|E
25|$|Hopkins studied {{classics}} at Balliol College, Oxford (1863–67). He {{began his}} time in Oxford as a keen socialite and prolific poet, but <b>he</b> <b>seemed</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> alarmed himself with the changes in his behaviour that resulted. At Oxford he forged a lifelong friendship with Robert Bridges (eventual Poet Laureate of the United Kingdom), which would be of importance in his development as a poet and in establishing his posthumous acclaim. Hopkins was deeply impressed {{with the work of}} Christina Rossetti and she became one of his greatest contemporary influences, meeting him in 1864. During this time he studied with the eminent writer and critic Walter Pater, who tutored him in 1866 and who remained a friend until Hopkins left Oxford in September 1879.|$|E
