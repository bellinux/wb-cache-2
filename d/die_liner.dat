5000|$|Part of {{the failure}} of the Virgin-DCT {{relationship}} can be laid at the label's attempt to renovate the band into something the American audiences could relate to. Yoshida took the stage name [...] "Miwa", Nakamura became [...] "King Masa," [...] but Nishikawa remained the same, and only received a passing mention on Sing or <b>Die's</b> <b>liner</b> notes. Musically, the album veered away from the classic DCT formula and deeper into the hip-hop dance theme begun on Delicious and Love Unlimited. The combination was not well received by American audiences, nor DCT's legion of loyal Japanese fans.|$|R
