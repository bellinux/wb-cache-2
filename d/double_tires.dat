50|$|Pow Wow is a rope tow, {{built out}} of an old dump truck, the rope runs between the <b>double</b> <b>tires,</b> and over old car wheel rims mounted on old {{telephone}} poles. The lift was originally powered by the truck's diesel engine, but was later converted to run on an electric motor. This lift has two ropes that run parallel over both truck wheels, and is considered as two separate lifts, however both ropes are powered by the same motor, so they start and stop at the same times.|$|E
5000|$|Second {{generation}} LiteAce van/wagons {{and trucks}} were {{released to the}} Japanese market in October 1979. Widely exported for the first time, the M20 included seating for up to eight in the wagon with a 2/3/3 arrangement, including fully reclining seatbacks for {{the second and third}} rows. Options included dual-zone air conditioners, a four-speaker audio system, and aluminum wheels. The high-roof GXL wagon grade also offered a moonroof option. Truck versions now included a [...] "just low" [...] model—created by fitting 10-inch <b>double</b> <b>tires</b> to the rear wheels (as opposed to 13-inch for the front wheels) to lower the bed floor further.|$|E
50|$|Asen Yordanov's {{airplane}} {{was at a}} {{first look}} similar to the planes of that time. It was a biplane with relatively short wings, to decrease the body weight and with increased spacing between them to improve the aerodynamic effect of the lower wing. The wing section {{was similar to that}} of Albatros. The cockpit and the fuselage were conceived with great care to diminish drag. The landing gear was reinforced with <b>double</b> <b>tires</b> for stability and safety when landing. The tail, vertical and horizontal stabilizers and the ailerons were similar to those built by Louis Blériot. The innovation that helped at landing and at recovery from stalls was something like contemporary flaps, added between the wings.|$|E

50|$|Instead of {{a single}} engine, the Siemens MMT 500 drive system is powered by two MTU 65-litre 16-cylinder four stroke diesel engines, each with 2,300 horsepower. These are coupled to two AC alternators and four AC {{traction}} motors (two in each axle). Fuel consumption (according to company data) is 198 g/kWh per engine, with option to run on only one if carrying less than capacity loads. Maximum speed is 64 km/h, and economy maximum speed (when fully loaded and on a 10% gradient) is 40 km/h. The complex propulsion system, {{in addition to the}} shallow bed, <b>doubled</b> <b>tires,</b> and very heavy empty weight, has led to concerns about operating efficiency.|$|R
5000|$|Truck {{body styles}} {{were added to}} the lineup in October 1978 (having entered {{production}} the previous month), including low-deck, high-deck, and [...] "just low" [...] models—these further lowered the bed floor by employing radial tires which had smaller diameters despite the identical 13-inch wheel size. Each of the three models offered standard- and long-wheelbase versions, the latter with as much space as the larger HiAce truck (albeit with a lower payload) and carrying the RR20/RR21 chassis codes—confusing, since the R20-series was generally reserved for the second generation TownAce. At first, trucks received the 1587 cc 12R-J engine (...) , until October 1979 when emission standards compliance necessitated the fitment of the 1770 cc 13T-U motor shared with the wagon. At the same time, the [...] "just low" [...] model adopted 10-inch <b>double</b> <b>tires</b> for the rear wheels, lowering the bed floor to the same level as that of light trucks.|$|E
50|$|The Solaris Alpino 8.9 LE is {{extended}} {{by more than}} 30 cm from the low-floor variant Solaris Alpino. It has a longer wheelbase and longer rear overhang, which resulted {{in an increase in}} weight. Just like the base model it is structurally related to the third generation Solaris Urbino buses. It is equipped with Cummins ISBe4 250B engine (with a capacity of 6.7 dm3 and 250 HP in power) centrally mounted at the back and a Voith Diwa 854.5 automatic gearbox. Optionally the bus can be mounted with a 6-speed automatic ZF 6HP-504 gearbox. This engine meets the standard Euro 4 using SCR technology, which requires AdBlue. The front suspension can be installed independently or alternatively with the IFS Voith ZF RL 75 EC. At the rear, it has a standard RS ArvinMeritor axle 24 on <b>double</b> <b>tires.</b> The width was reduced by 15 cm when compared with the Solaris Urbino series, and the desire to preserve adequate headroom {{in the rear of the}} bus without unduly increasing the height of the whole bus resulted in the need for the rear tires to have a reduced size. To ensure a broad aisle, on the one side of the bus instead of double seats there are 1 + 1/2 type seats on the rear axle. The cab is fitted as standard with a dashboard designed by Solaris, there is an optional dashboard by Siemens VDO or Multibus Actia.|$|E
5000|$|The <b>Double</b> Fabric <b>Tire</b> Company {{was started}} in Auburn, Indiana, in 1913. At the outset, <b>Double</b> Fabric made <b>tires</b> for the Auburn Automobile Company. In the 1920s, the company {{changed its name to}} the Auburn Rubber Company, phased out its {{production}} of tires and introduced new products such as rubber sheets for shoe soles. In 1935, it began making rubber toys, including a variety of toy cars, trucks, tractors and animals. Most vehicles were four to eight inches in length and cast in a variety of colors. During World War II, the company continued to make soles - now for combat boots - and also gaskets for so-called [...] "jerry cans." ...|$|R
50|$|In 2004, he lost {{consciousness}} and collapsed due to hydration problems after practicing hard in Colombo, Sri Lanka. Hutchins was hospitalised 20 times {{which was one}} of the reasons he gave up singles and turned to less <b>tiring</b> <b>doubles</b> in 2007.|$|R
50|$|CTIS also extends truck, tire, {{and drive}} train life, by {{significantly}} reducing vibration and shock loading. Feedback from Australian logging contractors show {{a doubling of}} transmission and differential life. <b>Tire</b> life can <b>double,</b> with drive <b>tire</b> life increasing from 27,000 km to 45,000 regularly shown. Even in flatter areas, drive tire life increased from 90,000 to 135,000.|$|R
50|$|Besides the cost, {{which can}} be more than <b>double</b> other <b>tires</b> of {{comparable}} size, run-flat tires can not be run flat if the flat is due to sidewall damage, a common cause of flats. Also, under the best circumstances, the speed and range that the run-flat tires can be run flat is very limited. Run-flat tires cannot be driven over 50 miles per hour and usually offer only up to 50 miles of extended mobility. These limitations lower {{the value of the}} extra expense for many buyers. In certain applications, depending on the vehicle, specific tire design, and driving surface, a run-flat tire can provide from 25 miles to 200 miles driving while flat with limited speed.|$|R
50|$|Stars of the Lid then {{released}} their first <b>double</b> album, The <b>Tired</b> Sounds of Stars of the Lid, in late October 2001. Nearly six years later, the duo released their second double album, And Their Refinement of the Decline, in April 2007 to widespread critical acclaim. Stars of the Lid toured worldwide throughout 2007 and 2008 {{in support of}} the album; throughout their European tour, they were joined live by a string trio featuring Lucinda Chua of Felix on cello, Noura Sanatian on violin, and Ela Baruch on viola. Their North American line-up included Julia Kent on cello.|$|R
50|$|A third caution period {{came out}} when David Brabham once again spun his Highcroft Acura, this time making light {{contact with a}} wall. While Peugeot still led in the eighth hour of the race, Audi began to <b>double</b> stint their <b>tires</b> {{for the first time}} when Lucas Luhr brought the third place Audi in for a {{scheduled}} stop but did not change tires. This aided Audi in retaking the lead from Peugeot during the race's ninth hour. Peugeot #08 then suffered a small leak in a rear tire, requiring the team to make an unscheduled pit stop to replace it. The two LMP1 Acuras meanwhile suffered mechanical problems, eventually leading to the retirement of both de Ferran and Highcroft.|$|R
5000|$|A {{post office}} was {{established}} in 1839. [...] In 1841, malaria ran through the town, and in 1843 a terrible storm wreaked havoc on cabins and crops. The Church of God was built by the Presbyterians in 1846. The Village of Auburn was incorporated in 1849, divided into wards, and governed under a town board and constable. By {{the end of the}} American Civil War, the town included over 700 inhabitants. The storm of September 29, 1872, destroyed Odd Fellow's Hall and damaged the Methodist Episcopal church. A few months later (April 6, 1873), the new brick block of Seventh Street (Snyder's Building) collapsed, also destroying the Ensley Building. [...] Auburn water and lights was constructed in 1898. The change in status to the City of Auburn on March 26, 1900 followed a referendum. Notable citizen Charles Eckhart erected a public library and a YMCA building. The Auburn Automobile Company founded in 1900 produced its first automobile in 1903. [...] William Wrigley, Jr. and Errett Lobban Cord controlled interests in the company that eventually acquired Duesenberg, Lexington, and Lycoming. The company failed in August 1937. The Auburn Rubber Company was started in 1913 as the <b>Double</b> Fabric <b>Tire</b> Company, making tires for Auburn Automobile Company. In the 1920s as Auburn Rubber, it became a large manufacturer of rubber toys, leaving Auburn in 1959.|$|R
40|$|In {{the present}} work it is {{intended}} to show the positive modifications in a farm located in the Alentejo region in the south of Portugal after 4 years of direct drilling system implantation. The soils in the study area are Luvisols, characterized by a poor structure, bad internal drainage and cumulative negative effects of conventional soil tillage used before direct drilling. The effects after 4 years of direct drilling resulted in reduction of erosion and soil compaction and improved physical, chemical and biological characteristics of the soil mainly by: increment of biological porosity and soil structural improvement and stability. The improved soil conditions allowed a deeper root growth and higher infiltration rate and a better soil bearing capacity. This has improved the opportunity for applying nitrogen and herbicides. All together enhanced crop growth. Additionally it was registered a significant reduction not only in the number of tractors and soil tillage equipment in the farm, but also in the maintenance and repair costs and in labor costs. Pulses (chickpea and peas) where introduced in the rotation with winter cereals, and the farm adopted other practices with direct drill such as the maintenance of straw at the soil surface and the utilization of special equipment for soil conservation (lighter tractors with <b>double</b> rear <b>tires</b> and straw dispersion equipment in the harvester). Despite the complete change regarding the soil management system (change of the whole farm to direct drilling), it was possible to maintain the perfect integration of animal (sheep) and crop production in the farming system, using only partially crop residues for animal feeding...|$|R
5|$|A {{person with}} MS can have almost any {{neurological}} symptom or sign, with autonomic, visual, motor, and sensory problems {{being the most}} common. The specific symptoms {{are determined by the}} locations of the lesions within the nervous system, and may include loss of sensitivity or changes in sensation such as tingling, pins and needles or numbness, muscle weakness, blurred vision, very pronounced reflexes, muscle spasms, or difficulty in moving; difficulties with coordination and balance (ataxia); problems with speech or swallowing, visual problems (nystagmus, optic neuritis or <b>double</b> vision), feeling <b>tired,</b> acute or chronic pain, and bladder and bowel difficulties, among others. Difficulties thinking and emotional problems such as depression or unstable mood are also common. Uhthoff's phenomenon, a worsening of symptoms due to exposure to higher than usual temperatures, and Lhermitte's sign, an electrical sensation that runs down the back when bending the neck, are particularly characteristic of MS. The main measure of disability and severity is the expanded disability status scale (EDSS), with other measures such as the multiple sclerosis functional composite being increasingly used in research.|$|R
40|$|International audienceHigh {{sensitivity}} of spectroscopic ellipsometry and reflectometry for {{the characterization of}} thin films can strongly decrease when layers, typically metals, absorb a significant fraction of the light. In this paper, we propose a solution to overcome this drawback using total internal reflection ellipsometry (TIRE) and exciting a surface longitudinal wave: a plasmon-polariton. As in the attenuated total reflectance technique, TIRE exploits a minimum in the intensity of reflected transversal magnetic (TM) polarized light and enhances the {{sensitivity of}} standard methods to thicknesses of absorbing films. Samples under study were stacks of three films, ZnO[*]:[*]Al/Ag/ZnO[*]:[*]Al, deposited on glass substrates. The thickness of the silver layer varied from sample to sample. We performed measurements with a UV-visible phase-modulated ellipsometer, an IR Mueller ellipsometer and a UV-NIR reflectometer. We used the variance-covariance formalism to evaluate {{the sensitivity of the}} ellipsometric data to different parameters of the optical model. Results have shown that using <b>TIRE</b> <b>doubled</b> the sensitivity to the silver layer thickness when compared with the standard ellipsometry. Moreover, the thickness of the ZnO[*]:[*]Al layer below the silver layer can be reliably quantified, unlike for the fit of the standard ellipsometry data, which is limited by the absorption of the silver layer...|$|R
