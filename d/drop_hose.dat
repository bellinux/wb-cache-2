40|$|Inoculation {{of plant}} {{pathogenic}} bacteria in field plots has been improved {{by the use}} of organosilicone surfactants. Factors, such as cul-tivars, number of applications, crop stage, plant density, concentration of bacteria, and irrigation application method (overhead spray versus <b>drop</b> <b>hoses),</b> that may affect field screening of cotton cultivars for resistance to bacterial blight caused by Xanthomonas axonopodis pv. malvaceaum (Xam) were tested. Plants were inoculated with Xam (race 18) plus the organosilicone non-ionic wetting agent, Silowet L- 77 (0. 25 % v/v). Disease incidence (DI) was similar for plants inoculated with Xam 1, 2, and 3 times. DI was not affected by Xam concentration when applied at 106 to 108 cfu/ml. DI was affected by the number of leaves at the time of inoculation for a susceptible cultiva...|$|R

The Houston Fire Department responded, where the fire fighters <b>dropped</b> a <b>hose</b> into the swimming pool to extinguish the flame. School was dismissed for four days. Churches and other businesses throughout the community offered their facilities so the high school students could complete the school year.|$|R
40|$|Mobile drip {{irrigation}} (MDI) technology adapts driplines to the <b>drop</b> <b>hoses</b> of moving sprinkler systems to apply water as the drip lines are pulled across the field. There is {{interest in this}} technology among farmers in the Texas High Plains region to help sustain irrigated agriculture. However, information {{on the performance of}} this system and its benefits relative to common sprinkler application technologies in the region are limited. A two-year study was conducted in 2015 and 2016 to compare grain yields, crop water use (ETc) and water use efficiency (WUE) of corn (Zea Mays L.) irrigated with MDI, low elevation spray application (LESA) and low energy precision application (LEPA) methods. Irrigation amounts for each application method were based on weekly neutron probe readings. In both years, grain yield and yield components were similar among application treatment methods. Although WUE was similar for the MDI treatment plots compared with LEPA and LESA during the wet growing season (2015), MDI demonstrated improved WUE during the drier year of 2016. Additional studies using crops with less than full canopy cover at maturity (sorghum and cotton) are needed to document the performance of MDI in the Texas High Plains region...|$|R
30|$|It {{has been}} {{revealed}} that irrigation type significantly influenced disease severity. Disease severity means were 5.8 and 2.8 in fields with overhead sprinkler irrigation and furrow irrigation, respectively using the standard {{system for the}} evaluation of bean germplasm with 1 as “no visible disease symptoms” and 9 as “very severe disease symptoms”(Schoonhoven and Pastor-Corrales 1994; Akhavan et al. 2009 a). In addition to dispersing bacterial cells and helping them to reach healthy plants as the key factor, and promoting release of leaf nutrients to the microbial community, overhead sprinkler irrigation can generate a film of water over the leaf surface including stomata, providing the symptomless epiphytic populations with a bridge to enter the plant resulting in disease symptoms development (Carvalho et al. 2011). Previously, it has also been shown that Asiatic citrus canker was more severe when applying overhead irrigation system which also increased the incidence of this disease caused by Xanthomonas axonopodis pv. citri (Pruvost et al. 1999). In contrast, Wheeler et al. (2007) showed that overhead irrigation increased disease incidence of cotton bacterial blight by Xanthomonas axonopodis pv. malvacearum in a partially resistant cultivar; PM 2200 RR compared with <b>drop</b> <b>hoses,</b> while irrigation method did not influence disease incidence for the susceptible cultivar; PM 2326 RR.|$|R

Moved to El Monte, California, its name was changed back to Fletcher and then Sargent Fletcher in 1964 before abandoning aircraft manufacturing in 1966, with rights to the FU-24 going to Pacific Aerospace.|$|R
50|$|The fourth {{event is}} the hose advance. This simulates a {{firefighter}} running from a fire engine towards a close fire. The competitor sprints 140 feet {{and picks up}} a 1.75 in. diameter charged (pressurized with water) hose, sprints five more feet with the hose, then drags it an additional 75 feet. Once at the 75 ft line and through the swinging doors, the competitor must then open the hose nozzle, releasing water onto a small target. After hitting the target, they must close the nozzle and <b>drop</b> the <b>hose,</b> which completes the event. The hose nozzle may only be opened once the nozzle opens the swinging doors, if the nozzle is opened earlier a 2 second penalty is added to the final time. If the competitor does not close the nozzle, they must come back close the nozzle and then resume the final event.|$|R
50|$|In {{the early}} morning hours of February 17, 1882, a massive fire {{destroyed}} much of the city's mill section, in a blaze that encompassed over 10 acre. Firefighting efforts were hampered by not only the primitive fire fighting equipment of the period, but also high winds and freezing temperatures. The nearby water source - the Merrimack River - was frozen, and <b>hoses</b> <b>dropped</b> through the ice tended to freeze as well. A New York Times report the next day established the damage at 300 businesses destroyed and damage worth approximately $2M (in 1882 dollars).|$|R
40|$|The Darcy-Weisbach {{equation}} {{is considered one}} of the most suitable equations to estimate pressure drop in trickle irrigation lines for its accuracy. On the other hand, Hazen-Williams equation, is more simple to apply, therefore, it became the common formula to use for trickle irrigation lateral design. To improve the accuracy of Hazen-Williams equation, proper values of the Hazen-Williams coefficient should be selected corresponding to each lateral diameter. The results of this study on plain and emitter polyethylene laterals confirmed that the Hazen-Williams coefficient is not constant and varies with pipe diameter and flow regime. The results have also demonstrated that the presence of emitters in pipes affects lateral pressure drop and the friction faction factor in Darcy-Weisbach equation. To estimate pressure <b>drop</b> in <b>hoses</b> with connected emitters, some formulas were developed based on Darcy-Weisbach and Hazen-Williams equations. In addition, empirical formulas were developed based on the statistic analysis of the data, one for plain pipe and the other for emitters. The obtained empirical equations can predict pressure losses in the specified hoses with good accuracy...|$|R
50|$|The Blue Hose {{kicked off}} the 2016 season with three away games: they fell to Central Michigan and #6 Chattanooga to open 0-2, but rebounded with a 31-14 win against Campbell. The Blue Hose's first home game ended with a shock upset as Presbyterian fell 7-28 to D-II Florida Tech. They {{traveled}} to Gardner-Webb next, losing by 21. Their second win of the season came at home against Monmouth, as a late goal line stand helped them win 17-13. That game proved to be Presbyterian's last win, however, as the Blue <b>Hose</b> <b>dropped</b> five straight against Charleston Southern, Coastal Carolina, Liberty, Kennesaw State, and South Alabama. On December 20, just over {{a month after the}} Blue Hose concluded a 2-9 season, head coach Harold Nichols resigned, and several days later Tommy Spangler was promoted for his second stint as PC head coach.|$|R
5000|$|A - Air : Fully open {{cylinder}} valve. The {{practice of}} closing by a quarter-turn is recommended by some instructors as {{it leaves the}} valve easy to turn, which allows a quick check to ensure it is not closed. A fully open valve may be damaged if the cylinder is empty and someone tries to open it, thinking it is tightly closed, as may happen if the cylinder is empty. However, this practice has been widely discouraged, after several fatalities, including that of famous cave diver Sheck Exley, were attributed to divers mistakenly closing the valve and then opening a quarter turn. (This means that adequate airflow may be delivered at the surface, but restricted at depth due to increased air density.) Breathe the air through the regulators {{to ensure that it}} is fresh and dry: impure air is extremely dangerous underwater, but can usually be recognized through an unpleasant, often oily, taste or smell. Test operation of primary and secondary regulators. Both should breathe comfortably, and not 'free-flow' when purged. Make sure you check SPG when test breathing through regulators when breathing the air pressure gauge should not <b>drop.</b> Check <b>hoses</b> for damage. Ensure that the secondary regulator (the 'octopus') is attached in the triangle between the chin and the base of the ribs, and can be released easily: this ensures easy access for a buddy {{in the event of an}} emergency.|$|R
30|$|The {{pressure}} drop {{of the water}} varies depending {{on the state of}} the hose. Consequently, the pressure <b>drop</b> in the <b>hose</b> does not have a steady value. Since it is not feasible to obtain a unique friction factor for the hose, we aim to calculate the highest possible value. In order to calculate this value, most of the hose was gathered in a coil of approximately 0.15  m of diameter. We consider that this condition generates one of the highest friction factors that the system could present due to the continuous changes of direction of the flow of water. These changes generate secondary flows along the hose and these augment the friction. The only moment this condition is presented is when the device is collected before being deployed. During the deployment, it is unlikely that this situation happen. Therefore, it is unlikely to generate larger {{pressure drop}} values than those calculated on this condition.|$|R
50|$|Stardust the Super Wizard {{learned that}} the Mad Giant {{experimenter}} of the Gobi Desert wanted {{to put an end}} to the civilization that ruined his power over savage slaves. He bored a hole to the center of the Earth into which he planned to pump a powerful chemical that would increase the thermal pressure within the planet and cause volcanic eruptions all over the world. The Mad Giant and his assistant Kamet dropped the powerful chemical through a hose from his private plateau laboratory in the desert. The increased pressure on the Earth's core caused a volcanic crater to rise out of Lake Michigan, close enough to threaten the city of Chicago. The Mad Giant and Kamet pumped in additional chemical, causing the Lake Michigan volcano to violently erupt. Stardust arrived at Lake Michigan and destroyed the rocks that were threatening to rain down on Chicago. In the meantime, the volcano erupted again and continued to grow. Stardust flew to the Gobi Desert via tubular spacial. Detecting Stardust’s approach, the Mad Giant fired anti-ray rockets at him causing him to lose control of his ray belt. In desperation, Stardust threw out a float screen of dust and flew out of range. As the Mad Giant prematurely celebrated, Stardust flashed into the laboratory and ordered the giant to shut off the chemical at once. The Mad Giant then turned his chemical hose on Stardust. Seeing Stardust weakened, the Mad Giant <b>dropped</b> his <b>hose</b> and charged the super wizard. Stardust, who had only feigned weakness, knocks the giant to the ground and proceeds to destroy the deadly chemical outfit. Seeing the giant down, Kamet fired an anti-ray gun at Stardust, once again disabling his radiation belt. Stardust was able to dash out of the range of the anti-ray gun and destroy the device with its own energies. He then proceeded to destroy the entire chemical plant with his fusing ray. The enraged giant charged Stardust only to get knocked through a wall. Stardust arrested the Mad Giant and delivered him to the asteroid headquarters of the Interplanetary Police.|$|R
50|$|According to the arson investigation, {{the fire}} {{originated}} inside building 74, {{which was a}} sign shop. This building backed up to an entertainment venue and was located on Kansas Street across from the sound stage. A show had just finished at this venue and the crowd was heading south on Front Street, being escorted by the actors from the show. Within minutes, flames were discovered inside the sign shop and security radioed the front gate. The front gate immediately called 911. In the mean time, someone pulled a fire hose from just north of this location (located outside the Rio Bravo Jail building). When {{it was discovered that}} the hose was not long enough, it was <b>dropped</b> and another <b>hose</b> was pulled from the area of Chinese Alley. However, the original hose was not turned off, which bled off the pressure to the second hose. 300 guests and employees were forced to evacuate the park. Tucson Estates Fire Department arrived in less than 10 minutes with one truck and two firemen. However, by this time the fire had progressed too quickly to be suppressed by this basic equipment. A multiple alarm call was put out to dispatch as many fire units as possible. This began the deployment of 100 pieces of equipment and over 200 firefighters from every fire department in the Tucson metro area, including Davis Monthan Air Force Base and the Arizona National Guard.|$|R
40|$|This final thesis {{work was}} {{performed}} at Volvocars, Gothenburg. The thesis was developed under Linköping University supervision and the complete duration {{of this work}} was 20 weeks. This work consists on building a model in GT Software, which would represent each of the components in the Diesel Distribution System and the interaction among them. These components include: the fuel tank, the filter, supply and return pipes and high pressure pump. In addition, experiments have been done to measure the pressure drops along the system components. These data {{will be used to}} support the software model in some components which complex geometry is more difficult to describe using the software. The experiments were developed using different viscosity fuels at different temperatures. It will be required to study the relation between diesel viscosity, temperature and its effects on pressure drops. The aim was building a model which will permit us to test different scenarios representing the real system. This model will be used as a tool to perform specific simulations and these simulation results would support the process of decision making. This model will be a useful tool to make simulations in a cost effective way, it enables simulating several driving conditions which implies significant cost reduction compared to the real simulation. For instance if it is known the vehicle consumption under certain conditions and the load, the simulation can be set to the precise flow rate and the model would yield the pressure drop for the complete temperature range and for any diesel viscosity. The main conclusions reached during this thesis work were:  Simple models can be built {{in a very short time}} for different final objectives. For instance to test many design parameters which value slight variation might lead to a consequential impact in the system total pressure loss. GT Software can be used to build very simple models consisting on just one meter length pipe and allow us to build pressure drop graphs as a function of flow rate, temperature and diameter size. These graphs would be used for any pipe length by just multiplying the pressure drop by the actual length.  Identification of the hose in the return flow circuit imposing the highest pressure <b>drops,</b> <b>hose</b> number 4 in the “Return Flow Simple Model”.  After running different simulations varying the pipe length and the pipe diameter at different flows and temperatures it was concluded that the design parameter with a higher influence was the diameter dimension. The Y-connector angle in the steel return pipe does not have any influence on pressure drops for any flow rate or temperature value within the operating range. Past tests developed to verify its effect on pressure peaks meant a waste of resources which could have been avoided by using GT Software tool.  A model representing the back flow circuit produced plots showing pressure values for the complete flow rate and temperature range. These plots will be used to see the different operating points, at a certain temperature and flow pumped the precise pressure values would be obtained. Thanks to the viscosity versus temperature plots it will be easy to determine the pressure values it would be obtained not just for the diesel samples used in this work but for any diesel viscosity in the market.  A complete circuit model from the fuel tank to the filter and high pressure pump returning back to the fuel tank showing the pressure versus flow rate, temperature plots. This model would provide the pressure values at the different components and those hoses should be focused on to solve over pressure situations.  Sensitive analysis of the deviation between the pressure drop values obtained during the real experiments and the pressure drop values produced by the model. Also it has been done a sensitive analysis of the deviation between pressure drop values when considering simple model return flow in comparison to the values produced when the 3 D data was imported to the model (the model accounts for the bends and changes in diameters). The highest pressure difference value found was 9 Kpa. Since the aim of the simulation was not obtaining absolute values but comparative values which would identify the main hoses that should be worked on, the simple model was concluded to be suitable for this purpose.  The graph showing the total pressure drop through the complete circuit results from the real experiments, adjusts to the 3 D Model pressure curve as it can be observed in the previous graph. There is not measurement data from the test for flow rate values over 165 l/h so this graph does not lead any conclusions regarding higher flow rate values.  In the case of the Simple Complete circuit Model, the pressure drop values yield by the model are lower values, the reason for this is that the Simple Complete Model is including less information regarding changes in diameter and curves.
