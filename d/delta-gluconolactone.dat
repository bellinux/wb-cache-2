40|$|Reduction {{reactions}} {{are an important}} area of study in organic synthesis and are used to synthesize a variety of compounds. In particular, the reduction of lactones to their respective lactols or hemiacetals {{is important for the}} synthesis of biologically active modified carbohydrates which are often used in drug design. The reduction of the sugar-based lactones to their respective lactols with lithium triethyl borohydride (LiEt 3 BH) will be the focus of this project. The efficiency of this reagent to reduce sugar lactones to sugar hemiacetals (lactols) will be studied under different reaction parameters to develop an efficient protocol for its uses. The parameters will include temperature, solvent, time and amount of reducing agent for the reductions using the LiEt 3 BH. The lactones that will be used in this project are D(-) -gulonic acid γ-lactone, D-(+) -ribonic γ-lactone, and <b>delta-gluconolactone.</b> These lactones will then be modified by introducing protecting groups at their free hydroxyl sites. The protecting groups that will be used in this project are isopropylidene, benzoyl, benzyl, acetyl, trityl, and silyl based (TMS and TBDMS). (download pdf for full abstract...|$|E
40|$|The midgut caecal {{cells from}} Rhynchosciara {{americana}} larvae possess a plasma-membrane-bound beta-D-glucosidase (cellobiase, EC 3. 2. 1. 21), which is recovered (75 - 95 %) in soluble form both after treatment with Triton X- 100 and after treatment with papain. The Triton X- 100 -solubilized beta-D-glucosidase displays Mr 106000 and pI 5. 4, whereas the papain-released beta-D-glucosidase shows Mr 65000 and pI 4. 7. Thermal inactivations of the detergent-solubilized and the papain-released forms of beta-D-glucosidase both follow apparent first-order kinetics with similar half-lives. The papain-released beta-D-glucosidase, after being purified by density-gradient centrifugation, hydrolyses beta-D-glucosides, beta-D-galactosides and beta-D-fucosides {{at the same}} active site, as inferred from experiments of competition between substrates. The beta-D-glucosidase seems to operate in accordance with rapid-equilibrium kinetics, since the Km (0. 61 mM) for the enzyme is constant {{over a wide range}} of pH. The hydrolysis of the beta-D-glucosidic bond catalysed by the beta-D-glucosidase occurs without inversion of configuration, <b>delta-gluconolactone</b> is a strong (Ki 0. 5 microM) inhibitor of the enzyme and substituents in the substrate aglycone affect the catalytic constant of the reaction. These data support the assumption that the mechanism of the reaction catalysed by the beta-D-glucosidase involves the intermediary formation of a carbonium ion, rather than a glucosyl-enzyme intermediate...|$|E
40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to investigate the inhibitory effect of naturally occurring flavonoids on individual stage of protein glycation in vitro using the model systems of <b>delta-Gluconolactone</b> assay (early stage), BSA-methylglyoxal assay (middle stage), BSA-glucose assay, and G. K. peptide-ribose assay (last stage). In the early stage of protein glycation, luteolin, qucertin, and rutin exhibited significant inhibitory activity on HbA 1 C formation (p < 0. 01), which were more effective than that of aminoguanidine (AG, 10 mM), a well-known inhibitor for advanced glycation endproducts (AGEs). For the middle stage, luteolin and rutin developed more significant inhibitory effect on methylglyoxal-medicated protein modification, and the IC 50 's were 66. 1 and 71. 8 microM, respectively. In the last stage of glycation, luteolin was found to be potent inhibitors of both the AGEs formation and the subsequent cross-linking of proteins. In addition, phenyl-tert-butyl-nitron served as a spin-trapping agent, and electron spin resonance (ESR) was used to explore the possible mechanism of the inhibitory effect of flavonoids on glycation. The results indicated that protein glycation was accompanied by oxidative reactions, as the ESR spectra showed a clear-cut radical signal. Statistical analysis showed that inhibitory capability of flavonoids against protein glycation was remarkably related to the scavenging free radicals derived from glycoxidation process (r = 0. 79, p < 0. 01). Consequently, the inhibitory mechanism of flavonoids against glycation was, at least partly, due to their antioxidant properties...|$|E
40|$|The {{incorporation}} of the specialized carbohydrate affinity ligand methacrylamido phenylboronic acid in polyacrylamide gels for SDS-PAGE analysis has been successful for the separation of carbohydrates and has here been adapted {{for the analysis of}} post-translationally modified proteins. While conventional SDS-PAGE analysis cannot distinguish between glycated and unglycated proteins, methacrylamido phenylboronate acrylamide gel electrophoresis (mP-AGE) in low loading shows dramatic retention of <b>delta-gluconolactone</b> modified proteins, while the mobility of the unmodified proteins remains unchanged. With gels containing 1 % methacrylamido phenylboronate, mP-AGE analysis of gluconoylated recombinant protein Sbi results in the retention of the modified protein at a position expected for a protein that has quadrupled its expected molecular size. Subsequently, mP-AGE was tested on HSA, a protein that is known to undergo glycation under physiological conditions. mP-AGE could distinguish between various carbohydrate-protein adducts, using in vitro glycated HSA, and discriminate early from late glycation states of the protein. Enzymatically glycosylated proteins show no altered retention in the phenylboronate-incorporated gels, rendering this method highly selective for glycated proteins. We reveal that a trident interaction between phenylboronate and the Amadori cis 1, 2 diol and amine group provides the molecular basis of this specificity. These results epitomize mP-AGE as an important new proteomics tool for the detection, separation, visualization and identification of protein glycation. This method will aid the design of inhibitors of unwanted carbohydrate modifications in recombinant protein production, ageing, diabetes, cardiovascular diseases and Alzheimer's disease...|$|E
40|$|Graduation date: 1965 Numerous {{investigations}} {{have been made}} on the contribution of butter cultures to the flavor of cultured cream butter, but production of uniform cultured cream butter has not been possible in industry. Therefore, it was desirable to investigate in detail the qualitative and quantitative chemistry of the flavor of high quality butter cultures, and to examine more closely some of the aspects of flavor production by butter culture organisms. Volatile flavor components of high quality butter culture and control heated milk were isolated from intact samples {{by means of a}} specially designed low-temperature, reduced-pressure steam distillation apparatus. Most of the flavor compounds present in the resulting distillate fractions were tentatively identified by gas chromatographic relative retention time data. Flavor concentrates obtained by ethyl ether extractions of aqueous distillates were also separated by temperature-programmed, capillary column gas chromatography, and the effluent from the capillary column was analyzed by a fast- scan mass spectrometer. Many of the flavor compounds in the flavor concentrates were positively identified by correlation of mass spectral and gas chromatographic data. In addition, supporting evidence for the identification of some flavor components was obtained through the use of qualitative functional group reagents, derivatives and headspace gas chromatography. Compounds that were positively identified in butter culture include ethanol, acetone, ethyl formate, methyl acetate, acetaldehyde, diacetyl, ethyl acetate, dimethyl sulfide, butanone, 2 -butanol, methyl butyrate, ethyl butyrate, methane, methyl chloride, carbon dioxide and methanol; also included were 2 -pentanone, 2 -heptanone, acetoin, formic acid, acetic acid, lactic acid, 2 -furfural, 2 -furfurol, methyl hexanoate, ethyl hexanoate, 2 -nonanone, 2 -undecanone, methyl octanoate and ethyl octanoate. Compounds that were tentatively identified in butter culture include hydrogen sulfide, methyl mercaptan, n-butanal, n-butanol, 2 -hexanone, n-pentanal, n-pentanol, 2 -mercaptoethanol, n-butyl formate, n-butyl acetate, 2 -methylbutanal, 3 -methylbutanal, methylpropanal, methyl heptanoate, n-octanal, 2 -tridecanone, methyl benzoate, methyl nonanoate, ethyl nonanoate, ethyl decanoate, methyl dodecanoate, ethyl dodecanoate, delta-octalactone and delta-decalactone. Compounds that were positively identified in control heated milk include acetaldehyde, ethyl formate, ethyl acetate, 2 -heptanone, 2 -furfural, 2 -furfurol, 2 -nonanone, 2 -undecanone, ethyl octanoate and methyl decanoate. Compounds that were tentatively identified in control heated milk include dimethyl sulfide, hydrogen sulfide, ammonia, methyl mercaptan, methyl acetate, acetone, methanol, butanone, butanal, n-butanol, methyl butyrate, ethyl butyrate, 2 -pentanone, 2 -hexanone, 2 -mercaptoethanol, 2 -furfuryl acetate, ethyl hexanoate, methyl heptanoate, 2 -tridecanone, ethyl decanoate, ethyl dodecanoate, delta-octalactone and delta-decalactone. The data indicated that the qualitative flavor composition of control heated milk and butter culture were very similar. Diacetyl, ethanol, 2 -butanol and acetic acid were noted to be consistently absent in the data for the control heated milk. Other compounds were not observed in the heated milk fractions, but were also absent from some of the culture fractions. This was attributed to their presence in low concentrations, chemical instability or inefficient recovery. A modified 3 -methyl- 2 -benzothiazolone hydrazone spectrophotometric procedure was adapted for the determination of acetaldehyde produced in lactic starter cultures. The procedure was applied in conjunction with diacetyl measurements in studying single- and mixed-strain lactic cultures. The diacetyl to acetaldehyde ratio was found to be approximately 4 : 1 in desirably flavored mixed-strain butter cultures. When the ratio of the two compounds was lower than 3 : 1 a green flavor was observed. Acetaldehyde utilization at 21 °C by Leuconostoc citrovorum 91404 was very rapid in both acidified (pH 4. 5) and non-acidified (pH 6. 5) milk cultures. The addition of five p. p. m. of acetaldehyde to non-acidified milk media prior to inoculation greatly enhanced growth of L. citrovorum 91404 during incubation at 21 °C. Combinations of single-strain organisms demonstrated that the green flavor defect can result from excess numbers of Streptococcus lactis or Streptococcus diacetilactis in relation to the L. citrovorum population. Diacetyl, dimethyl sulfide, acetaldehyde, acetic acid and carbon dioxide were found to be "key" compounds in natural butter culture flavor. Optimum levels of these compounds in butter culture were ascertained by chemical or flavor panel evaluations. On the basis of these determinations, a synthetic butter culture prepared with heated whole milk and <b>delta-gluconolactone</b> (final pH 4. 65) was flavored with 2. 0 p. p. m. of diacetyl, 0. 5 p. p. m. of acetaldehyde, 1250 p. p. m. of acetic acid, 25. 0 p. p. b. of dimethyl sulfide and a small amount of sodium bicarbonate for production of carbon dioxide. The resulting synthetic butter culture exhibited the typical aroma, flavor and body characteristics found in natural high quality butter cultures, except that the <b>delta-gluconolactone</b> was found to contribute an astringent flavor...|$|E
