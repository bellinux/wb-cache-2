500|$|In July 1906 {{grazing land}} on Vatersay was raided by landless cottars from Barra and its isles, {{including}} three families from Mingulay. They were followed in 1907 by eight more raiders from Mingulay led by Micheal Neill Eachainn. Lady Gordon Cathcart took legal action but the visiting judge took {{the view that}} she had neglected her duties as a landowner and that [...] "long indifference to the necessities of the cottars had gone far to drive them to exasperation". Vatersay has sheltered anchorages and was only 300 metres (330yd) from Barra (until {{the construction of a}} causeway in 1990) and Neil MacPhee wrote [...] "it is better a thousand times to <b>die</b> <b>here</b> than to go through the same hardships which were our lot" [...] on Mingulay.|$|E

2500|$|Sometime before 1563 Basque fishermen, who {{had been}} fishing cod shoals off Newfoundland's coasts since the {{beginning}} of the sixteenth century, founded Plaisance (today Placentia), a seasonal haven which French fishermen later also used. In the Newfoundland will, now in an archive in Spain, of the Basque seaman Domingo de Luca dated 1563 de Luca asks “that my body be buried in this port of Plazençia in the place where those who <b>die</b> <b>here</b> are usually buried.” [...] This will is the oldest known civil document written in Canada.|$|E
2500|$|Taking {{advantage}} of the enemy's retreat, the Wei general Zhuge Dan ordered his subordinate Jiang Ban (蔣班) to lead 4,000 troops to pursue and attack Liu Zan. As Liu Zan was ill at the time, {{he could not get}} up and direct the troops to fight the enemy. Knowing that they would lose the battle, he passed his ceremonial umbrella and his official seal to his subordinate(s) and told him, [...] "As a commander, I have defeated enemies and captured their flags, but I have never lost a single battle. Now, I am sick and outnumbered by the enemy. You should quickly leave while you still can. It won't do our State any good if all of us <b>die</b> <b>here</b> today; it'll only benefit the enemy." [...] When his subordinate(s) refused to leave, he drew his sword and threatened to kill him; only then did his subordinate(s) leave.|$|E
2500|$|... "The Enemy {{are driving}} us", Bee exclaimed to Jackson. Jackson, a former U.S. Army officer and {{professor}} at the Virginia Military Institute, {{is said to have}} replied, [...] "Then, Sir, we will give them the bayonet." [...] Bee exhorted his own troops to re-form by shouting, [...] "There is Jackson standing like a stone wall. Let us determine to <b>die</b> <b>here,</b> and we will conquer. Rally behind the Virginians." [...] This exclamation was the source for Jackson's (and his brigade's) nickname, [...] "Stonewall". There is some controversy over Bee's statement and intent, which could not be clarified because he was mortally wounded almost immediately after speaking and none of his subordinate officers wrote reports of the battle. Major Burnett Rhett, chief of staff to General Johnston, claimed that Bee was angry at Jackson's failure to come immediately to the relief of Bee's and Bartow's brigades while they were under heavy pressure. Those who subscribe to this opinion believe that Bee's statement was meant to be pejorative: [...] "Look at Jackson standing there like a stone wall!" ...|$|E

2500|$|Jackson rose to {{prominence}} and earned {{his most famous}} nickname at the First Battle of Bull Run (First Manassas) on July 21, 1861. As the Confederate lines began to crumble under heavy Union assault, Jackson's brigade provided crucial reinforcements on Henry House Hill, demonstrating the discipline he instilled in his men. Brig. Gen. Barnard Elliott Bee Jr. exhorted his own troops to re-form by shouting, [...] "There is Jackson standing like a stone wall. Let us determine to <b>die</b> <b>here,</b> and we will conquer. Rally behind the Virginians!" [...] There is some controversy over Bee's statement and intent, {{which could not be}} clarified because he was killed almost immediately after speaking and none of his subordinate officers wrote reports of the battle.

2500|$|The {{lowering}} of Boat 9 at 1:30a.m. with about 56 aboard was supervised by Murdoch, possibly with Moody assisting. [...] Boatswain's mate Albert Hames {{was put in}} charge with Able-Bodied Seaman George McGough at the tiller. Most passengers were women, with two or three men who entered when no more women came forward. One elderly woman refused to board, making a great fuss, and retreated below decks. May Futrelle, the wife of novelist Jacques Futrelle, was likewise initially reluctant to board; but after her husband told her, [...] "For God's sake, go! It's your last chance! Go!", an officer forced her into the boat. The millionnaire Benjamin Guggenheim brought Léontine Aubart, his French mistress, and her maid, Emma Sägasser, to Boat 9 before retiring to his stateroom with his valet, Victor Giglio. Both men removed their life jackets and put on their evening clothes. Guggenheim told a steward, [...] "We've dressed in our best, and are prepared to go down like gentlemen. There is grave doubt that the men will get off. I am willing to remain and play the man's game if there are not enough boats for more than the women and children. I won't <b>die</b> <b>here</b> like a beast. Tell my wife I played the game out straight and to the end. No women shall be left aboard this ship because Ben Guggenheim was a coward." ...|$|E
