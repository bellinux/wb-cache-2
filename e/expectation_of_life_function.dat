40|$|Evidence on {{trends in}} {{prevalence}} of disease and disability can clarify whether countries are experiencing a compression or expansion of morbidity. An expansion of morbidity as indicated by disease have appeared in Europe and other developed regions. It is likely that better treatment, preventive measures and increases in education levels {{have contributed to the}} declines in mortality and increments in life expectancy. This paper examines whether there has been an expansion of morbidity in Catalonia (Spain). It uses trends in mortality and morbidity from major causes of death and links of these with survival to provide estimates <b>of</b> <b>life</b> expectancy with and without diseases and functioning loss. We use a repeated cross-sectional health survey carried out in 1994 and 2011 for measures of morbidity; mortality information comes from the Spanish National Statistics Institute. Our findings show that at age 65 the percentage <b>of</b> <b>life</b> with disease increased from 52 % to 70 % for men, and from 56 % to 72 % for women; the <b>expectation</b> <b>of</b> <b>life</b> unable to <b>function</b> increased from 24 % to 30 % for men and 40 % to 47 % for women between 1994 and 2011. These changes were attributable to increases in the prevalences of diseases and moderate functional limitation. Overall, we find an expansion of morbidity along the period. Increasing survival among people with diseases can lead to a higher {{prevalence of disease}}s in the older population. Higher prevalence of health problems can lead to greater pressure on the health care system and a growing burden of disease for individuals...|$|R

40|$|OBJECTIVE—To {{investigate}} the sampling distribution and usefulness <b>of</b> <b>expectation</b> <b>of</b> <b>life</b> in comparisons <b>of</b> mortality at health district level or below.  DESIGN—Derivation of {{a formula for}} the variance <b>of</b> the <b>expectation</b> <b>of</b> <b>life,</b> confirmation <b>of</b> the result and generation of the sampling distribution by Monte Carlo simulation; comparison <b>of</b> <b>expectation</b> <b>of</b> <b>life</b> with standardised mortality ratio (SMR) and other summary indices of mortality.  SETTING—A health district in Trent Region, England.  SUBJECTS—Routinely available mortality statistics at electoral ward level and above.  MAIN RESULTS—Given reasonable and simple assumptions the sampling distribution <b>of</b> the <b>expectation</b> <b>of</b> <b>life</b> is approximately normal. <b>Expectation</b> <b>of</b> <b>life</b> shows a high negative correlation with SMR even if the oldest age band for the SMR is open ended.  CONCLUSIONS—Where sampling error is an issue, inference concerning differences in mortality rates between populations can be based on <b>expectation</b> <b>of</b> <b>life,</b> which is better for illustrative purposes than SMR. The formula for the variance <b>of</b> the <b>expectation</b> <b>of</b> <b>life</b> is more complex however. If the final age band is open ended, its lower bound should {{be as high as}} possible to avoid misleading results caused by hidden differences in age structure.    Keywords: life expectancy; sampling distribution; Monte Carlo metho...|$|R

40|$|BACKGROUND: To {{demonstrate}} how assessment <b>of</b> <b>life</b> expectancy and loss in <b>expectation</b> <b>of</b> <b>life</b> {{can be used}} to address a wide range of research questions of public health interest pertaining to the prognosis of cancer patients. METHODS: We identified 135, 092 cases of colon adenocarcinoma diagnosed during 1961 - 2011 from the population-based Swedish Cancer Register. Flexible parametric survival models for relative survival were used to estimate the life expectancy and the loss in <b>expectation</b> <b>of</b> <b>life.</b> RESULTS: The loss in <b>expectation</b> <b>of</b> <b>life</b> for males aged 55 at diagnosis was 13. 5 years (95 % CI 13. 2 - 13. 8) in 1965 and 12. 8 (12. 4 - 13. 3) in 2005. For males aged 85 the corresponding figures were 3. 21 (3. 15 - 3. 28) and 2. 10 (2. 04 - 2. 17). The pattern was similar for females, but slightly greater loss in <b>expectation</b> <b>of</b> <b>life.</b> The loss in <b>expectation</b> <b>of</b> <b>life</b> is reduced given survival up to a certain time point post diagnosis. Among patients diagnosed in 2011, 945 life years could potentially be saved if the colon cancer survival among males could be brought to the same level as for females. CONCLUSION: Assessment <b>of</b> loss in <b>expectation</b> <b>of</b> <b>life</b> facilitates the understanding of the impact of cancer, both on individual and population level. Clear improvements in survival among colon cancer patients have led to a gain in life expectancy, partly due to a general increase in survival from all causes. Peer-reviewedPublisher Versio...|$|R

40|$|We {{examine the}} {{associations}} between nutrition and mortality {{at the national}} level. Altogether four aspects of this association are explored: (1) total calories with <b>expectation</b> <b>of</b> <b>life,</b> (2) dietary composition with <b>expectation</b> <b>of</b> <b>life,</b> (3) total calories with the age patterns of mortality, and (4) dietary composition with the age patterns of mortality. The data consist <b>of</b> <b>life</b> tables and national food balance sheets for 341 populations from 96 countries. A preliminary principal components analysis conducted on the dietary composition data yields three dietary components: (1) the overall {{quality and quantity of}} the diet, (2) the relative contribution of carbohydrates versus fats, and (3) the relative contribution of fats versus proteins. The results indicate that <b>expectation</b> <b>of</b> <b>life</b> at birth increases with total calories, with overall quality and quantity of the diet, and with the ratio of fats to proteins. The ratio of carbohydrates to fats is negatively associated with level of mortality. However, evidence indicates that the main effect of the ratio of fats to proteins is reversed when diets are high in quality and that all the effects tend to saturate at high nutrient availability. Variation in nutrition is also strongly associated with the international variation in age patterns of mortality. For example, when <b>expectation</b> <b>of</b> <b>life</b> is held constant, populations with higher quality diets tend to have lower childhood mortality and higher adult mortality. The results indicate that nutritional patterns are highly correlated with much of the world wide variation in mortality and may be a useful criterion for selecting or predicting the best suited model life table for use on a particular population...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{measures of}} differential mortality in Italy by educational level. The results {{refer to the}} year 2001 because the census is the only source providing data about population by level of education; as to deaths the data are provided by death certificates. As often happens, in order to compute differential mortality using these period frequencies {{it was necessary to}} confront problems both in the use of unlinked records and in relation to limitations in statistical documents; that is why we classified the population in only two groups: one with a low level of education and the other with a high level. We used a logit relational method to build life tables according to the levels of education. Particular attention was given to <b>expectation</b> <b>of</b> <b>life</b> at the ages from 35 to 65. At 35 years <b>of</b> age the <b>expectation</b> <b>of</b> <b>life</b> for a person with a low level of education is about 7. 5 years less than for a person of a higher level in case of a male, and 6. 5 years less in case of a female.

40|$|Cancer patient {{survival}} {{is the single}} most important measure of cancer patient care. By quantifying cancer patient survival in different ways further insights can be gained in terms of temporal trends and differences in cancer patient survival between groups. The objective of this thesis is to develop and apply methods for estimating the cure proportion and loss in <b>expectation</b> <b>of</b> <b>life</b> for cancer patients. In paper I, a cure model was used to study temporal trends in survival of patients with acute myeloid leukaemia in Sweden. Cancer patient survival was estimated in a relative survival setting and quantified as the proportion cured and the median survival time of uncured for different age groups and by calendar time of diagnosis. We found a dramatic increase in the cure proportion for the age group 19 - 40, although almost no improvement was seen for patients aged 70 - 79 at diagnosis. In paper II, a flexible parametric cure model was developed to overcome some limitations with standard parametric cure models. This model is a special case of a non-mixture cure model, using splines instead of a parametric distribution for the modeling. The fit of the flexible parametric cure model was compared to the fit of a Weibull non-mixture cure model, and shown to be superior in cases when the standard non-mixture cure model did not give a good fit or did not converge. Software was developed to enable use of the method. In paper III, the possibility of using a flexible parametric relative survival model for estimating life expectancy and loss in <b>expectation</b> <b>of</b> <b>life</b> was evaluated. Extrapolation of the survival function is generally needed, and the flexible parametric relative survival model was shown to extrapolate the survival very well. The method was evaluated by comparing survival functions extrapolated from 10 years past diagnosis to observed survival by the use of data with 40 years of follow-up. Software was developed to enable use of the method. In paper IV, the life expectancy and loss in <b>expectation</b> <b>of</b> <b>life</b> was estimated for colon cancer patients in Sweden. Even though relative survival was similar across age for colon cancer patients, the loss in <b>expectation</b> <b>of</b> <b>life</b> varied greatly by age, since young patients have more years to lose. We also found that the <b>life</b> expectancy <b>of</b> colon cancer patients improved over time. However, the improvement has to a large extent mimicked the improvement seen in the general population, and therefore there were no large changes in the loss in <b>expectation</b> <b>of</b> <b>life.</b> In conclusion, the methods presented in this thesis are additional tools for estimating and quantifying population-based cancer patient survival, that can lead to an improved understanding of different aspects of the prognosis of cancer patients...|$|R
