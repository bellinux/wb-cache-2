40|$|This paper investigates {{coordination}} of {{a supply chain}} consisting of one manufacturer and one retailer facing consumer return. We integrate consumer returns policy and manufacturer buyback policy within a modeling framework and explicitly model {{the positive effect of}} <b>refund</b> <b>amount</b> on demand and its negative effect on the probability that consumers keep the products. We design a buyback/markdown money contract to coordinate the supply chain under partial refund policy and find that the <b>refund</b> <b>amount</b> {{plays an important role in}} the decisions and profitability of the players. In the coordinated setting with given buyback price, the <b>refund</b> <b>amount</b> first increases the players' expected profits/quantity, and then decreases them. When the risk (variance) of the consumer's valuation increases, the manufacturer may raise the unit wholesale price to achieve a higher unit profit. The supply chain is better off using full refund policy if the risk is very small; otherwise, the supply chain prefers no returns policy. The results of this paper are robust to distribution form.

40|$|The Earned Income Tax Credit (EITC) is {{the largest}} anti-poverty fiscal policy program for working, low-wealth {{families}} administered through the tax code. For the 2004 tax season, US-Mexico border county receipts of the EITC <b>refund</b> <b>amounted</b> to $ 1. 9 billion while the total <b>refund</b> <b>amount</b> for low-income Borderlands families was $ 2. 6 billion. For the nation, $ 38 billion in EITC refunds were disbursed to eligible working families in tax year 2003. The National Survey of America’s Families indicatess that Latino families have the lowest EITC knowledge rate at 27. 1 % compared to non-Hispanic white families (73. 5 %) and Black families (68. 0 %), (Maag, Tax Notes, 2005). This implies that many qualifying Latino families {{do not participate in}} nor receive the EITC refund. Clearly, families and single workers that qualify for the EITC who do not participate in this fiscal policy are missing an opportunity to increase their financial well-being as well as building assets for the future. My paper chronicles the Frontera Family Asset Building Coalition and provides empirical analysis of a new data source that documents the financial behaviors of Latino low-income and working poor families filing tax returns for the tax years 2004 (Tax Season 2005) and 2003 (Tax Season 2004). The surveys were administered along the Southwest Border counties in Texas, New Mexico, Arizona and California in both metropolitan and rural areas. Over 7, 000 respondents were canvassed about their financial behaviors and needs. Additionally, the survey captures tax refund expenditures on micro-businesses and self-employment activities while providing information on the financial behaviors of the micro-business owners.

40|$|In this paper, we {{investigate}} the optimal selling scheme for a capacity-constrained seller who faces both aggregate demand and individual valuation uncertainties. As each consumer privately observes an initial estimate {{prior to the}} transactions and an updated information postpurchase, the problem exhibits the sequential screening feature and return policy emerges {{as part of the}} optimal selling scheme. We show that the optimal selling scheme nicely resembles the classical multiunit auction design, and the product is returned too often compared to the efficient scenario. Furthermore, even though the postpurchase information update is privately observed by the individual consumers, the seller does not give away additional surplus to the consumers. Our general framework can accommodate various heterogeneities and uncertainties regarding hassle costs, shipping costs, salvage values, and reservation values. Our results go through even if the seller cannot commit to the <b>refund</b> <b>amounts,</b> the seller has flexible capacity, or consumers have multiunit demands...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{develops}} {{a model of}} consumer returns policies. In our model, consumers face valuation uncertainty and realize their valuations only after purchase. There is also aggregate demand uncertainty, captured using the conventional newsvendor model. In this environment, consumers decide whether to purchase and then whether to return the product, whereas the seller sets the price, quantity, and <b>refund</b> <b>amount.</b> Using our model, we study the impact of full returns policies (e. g., using 100 % money-back guarantees) and partial returns policies (e. g., when restocking fees are charged) on supply chain performance. Next, we demonstrate that consumer returns policies may distort incentives under common supply contracts (such as manufacturer buy-backs), and we propose strategies to coordinate the supply chain {{in the presence of}} consumer returns. Finally, we explore several extensions and demonstrate the robustness of our findings. consumer returns, supply chains, valuation uncertainty, newsvendor model, supply contracts...|$|R

A Heckman selection model shows that the Nature Fund and Child Fund are normal goods, with income elasticities of contribution of 0. 20 and 0. 14. With values of- 0. 58 and- 0. 29, the tax price elasticities of contribution are even greater.

40|$|To {{understand}} whether retailers {{should consider}} consumer returns when merchandising, we study how the optimal assortment of a price-taking retailer {{is influenced by}} its return policy. The retailer selects its assortment from an exogenous set of horizontally differentiated products. Consumers make purchase and keep/return decisions in nested multinomial logit fashion. Our main finding is that the optimal assortment has a counterintuitive structure for relatively strict return policies: It is optimal to offer a mix {{of the most popular}} and most eccentric products when the <b>refund</b> <b>amount</b> is sufficiently low, which {{can be viewed as a}} form of risk sharing between the retailer and consumers. In contrast, if the refund is sufficiently high, or when returns are disallowed, optimal assortment is composed of only the most popular products (a common finding in the literature). We provide preliminary empirical evidence for one of the key drivers of our results: more eccentric products have higher probability of return – conditional on purchase. In light of our analytical findings and managerial insights, we conclude that retailers should take their return policies into account when merchandising. 1...|$|R
