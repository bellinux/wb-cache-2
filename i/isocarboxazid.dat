50|$|<b>Isocarboxazid</b> is {{primarily}} {{used to treat}} mood and anxiety disorders. It has also been investigated {{in the treatment of}} Parkinson's disease and other dementia-related disorders. Although efficacious, <b>isocarboxazid</b> produces many side effects, which may include headaches, jaundice, chest pain, weight gain, orthostatic hypotension, fainting, dizziness, and tremors. <b>Isocarboxazid,</b> as well as other MAOIs, increase the levels of the monoamine neurotransmitters serotonin, dopamine, and norepinephrine in the brain. Classical MAOIs, including <b>isocarboxazid,</b> are used only very rarely in the present day due to prominent food and drug interactions and have been largely superseded by newer, safer, and more tolerable antidepressants such as the selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs). The cause of the interactions is because MAOIs inhibit the metabolism of dietary amines (e.g., tyramine) and the monoamine neurotransmitters. In combination with other drugs that increase the levels of the monoamine neurotransmitters such as the SSRIs, or with certain foods high in dietary amines such as aged cheeses, MAOIs can produce dangerous elevations of monoamine neurotransmitters resulting in potentially life-threatening syndromes such as hypertensive crisis and serotonin syndrome.|$|E
50|$|Iproniazid is {{no longer}} used because it caused an {{unacceptable}} incidence in jaundice. Nevertheless related agents such as phenelzine and <b>isocarboxazid</b> {{are still on the}} market.|$|E

50|$|It is {{contraindicated}} {{in people}} with convulsive disorders, those that have received treatment with irreversible monoamine oxidase inhibitors such as phenelzine, tranylcypromine or <b>isocarboxazid</b> within the past 30 days and those with myocardial infarction pain, mostly {{due to a lack}} of safety data in these conditions.|$|E
50|$|Monoamine oxidase inhibitors (MAOIs) are {{effective}} for anxiety, but their dietary restrictions, {{side effects and}} availability of newer effective drugs, have limited their use. First generation MAO inhibitors include: phenelzine, <b>isocarboxazid</b> and tranylcypromine. Moclobemide, a reversible MAO-A inhibitor, lacks the dietary restrictions associated with classic MAOI's. The drug is used in Canada, the UK and Australia.|$|E

50|$|Iproniazid was {{originally}} {{developed for the}} treatment of tuberculosis, but in 1952, its antidepressant properties were discovered when researchers noted that patients given isoniazid became inappropriately happy. Subsequently N-isopropyl addition led to development as an antidepressant and was approved for use in 1958. It was withdrawn a few years later in 1961 due to a high incidence of hepatitis, and was replaced by less hepatotoxic drugs such as phenelzine and <b>isocarboxazid.</b>|$|E

50|$|Phenelzine (Nardil, Nardelzine) is a non-selective and {{irreversible}} {{monoamine oxidase}} inhibitor (MAOI) of the hydrazine class {{which is used}} as an antidepressant and anxiolytic. Along with tranylcypromine and <b>isocarboxazid,</b> phenelzine {{is one of the}} few non-selective and irreversible MAOIs still in widespread clinical use. It is typically available in 15 mg tablets and doses usually range from 30-90 mg per day, with 15 mg every day or every other day suggested as a maintenance dose following a successful course of treatment.|$|E
50|$|It {{has been}} {{described}} as a 'slow binding inhibitor', whereby conformational changes to either moclobemide or the enzyme to MAO-A slowly form a more tightly bound complex, resulting in the non-competitive MAO inhibition by moclobemide. With three times daily dosing the inhibition on MAO-A was relatively constant with moclobemide. The MAO inhibition of moclobemide lasts about 8-10 hours and wears off completely by 24 hours after dosing. The inhibition of MAO-A by moclobemide is 10 times more potent than the irreversible MAOIs phenelzine and approximately equivalent to tranylcypromine and <b>isocarboxazid.</b>|$|E
50|$|In {{spite of}} its {{atypical}} nature and different profile of activity, trimipramine {{has been shown in}} head-to-head clinical studies to possess equivalent effectiveness to other antidepressants, including but not limited to other TCAs (e.g., amitriptyline, imipramine, doxepin, amineptine), tetracyclic antidepressants (TeCAs) (e.g., maprotiline), monoamine oxidase inhibitors (MAOIs) (e.g., phenelzine, <b>isocarboxazid),</b> and selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (e.g., fluoxetine). In addition, trimipramine has been found to possess greater anxiolytic effects than other TCAs such as amitriptyline and doxepin in head-to-head comparisons. Indeed, its prominent anxiolytic effects have been said to distinguish it from most other TCAs. The atypicality of trimipramine in relation to its lack of monoamine reuptake inhibition is described as challenging the monoamine hypothesis of depression.|$|E

40|$|Several known inhibitors of mono-amine oxidase (iproniazid, <b>isocarboxazid,</b> nialamide, phenelzine, {{pheniprazine}} and tranylcypromine) {{were tested}} {{for their ability}} to (i) inhibit the mono-amine oxidase activity of a rat brain mitochondrial preparation in vitro; (ii) potentiate the action of tryptamine on the isolated rat fundal strip preparation; and (iii) potentiate the acute toxicity of tryptamine in mice. There was some correlation between the order of potency of the drugs in the three tests, particularly in inhibiting the enzyme activity in the Warburg and in the tryptamine toxicity test in mice. Exceptions to this were <b>isocarboxazid</b> which had unexpectedly high activity on the rat fundal strip preparation, and tranylcypromine which was devoid of tryptamine-potentiation action on the rat fundus preparation although it inhibited rat brain mono-amine oxidase in vitro and potentiated the action of tryptamine in vivo. Tranylcypromine was considerably less active in inhibiting the mono-amine oxidase of rat fundus than rat brain tissue in vitro, while iproniazid and <b>isocarboxazid</b> had about the same potency on the enzyme from the two tissues...|$|E
40|$|DESCRIPI 10 N: There {{have been}} {{numerous}} case reports of adverse reactions involving monoamine oxidase inhibitors (MAOIs), including reactions that developed when one MAOI was substituted for another. Although most reports have usually described a switch from <b>isocarboxazid</b> or phenelzine to tranylcypromine, we report a case of acute central nervous system toxicity possibly associated with a switch from phenelzine to <b>isocarboxazid.</b> SYMYfOMATOLOGY: Predominant symptoms included stuporous sensorium, hypertension, tachycardia, tremor, and urinary retention. Onset of symptoms began within 48 hours after the abrupt MAOI switch. CONCLUSIONS: Clinicians must allow a sufficient washout period before adding any agent that has a known potential to interact adversely with MAOIs. In addition, patients who are unusually sensitive to one type of MAOI may also be at increased risk fo...|$|E
40|$|The {{concentrations}} of 5 -hydroxytryptamine (5 HT), noradrenaline, and dopamine were estimated post mortem in brain stem, hypothalamus, and caudate nucleus in 33 {{patients who had}} been treated with <b>isocarboxazid,</b> clorgyline, or tranylcypromine and 11 controls. Similar and highly significant increases in 5 HT and noradrenaline concentration occurred with all three drugs.

40|$|Among {{different}} heterocyclic chemotypes incorporating two nitrogen atoms, pyrazolines {{could be}} considered a valid pharmacophore for the synthesis of selective monoamine oxidase (MAO) inhibitors because they were developed by the cyclization of the early hydrazine derivatives such as <b>isocarboxazid.</b> Substituted pyrazolines, decorated with different functional groups, are important lead compounds endowed with a large amount of biological activities. As a matter of this, most of them were also evaluated as dual inhibitors with a synergistic action towards different classes of enzymes (ciclooxygenase, acetylcholinesterase, butyrylcholinesterase). Moreover due to the direct correlation with the recognized MAO inhibition, this scaffold displayed antidepressant and anticonvulsant properties in animal models...|$|E
40|$|A {{study was}} carried out in which 135 mildly or {{moderately}} depressed outpatients were randomly allocated to one of five groups receiving six weeks' treatment weith antidepressant drugs. The groups received a tricyclic antidepressant (trimipramine; mean dose 106 mg at night) or a monoamine oxidase inhibitor (MAOI) (phenelzine or isocarboxazid; mean doses 45 and 32 mg/day respectively), or {{a combination of the two}} (phenelzine plus trimipramine or <b>isocarboxazid</b> plus trimipramine). Various scales were used to measure depression before and at one, three, and six weeks of treatment, and results were assessed blindly. The tricyclic antidepressant was found to be consistently superior to the MAOIs and the combined treatments. Some differential indicators of response to the various antidepressants were found [...] for example, patients with initial complaints of dizziness, suicidal ideas, irritability, and insomnia and a longer duration of illness were more likely to respond to trimipramine [...] but these were of only modest significance. Side effects were not troublesome in any group. It is concluded that neither MAOIs nor MAOIs combined with tricyclic antidepressants are the treatment of first choice in unselected outpatients with mild or moderate depression...|$|E
40|$|Plasma {{growth hormone}} (GH), insulin, cortisol, and glucose were {{measured}} during sleep on 38 nights in eight young adults. Blood {{was drawn from}} an indwelling catheter at 30 -min intervals; EEG and electrooculogram were recorded throughout the night. In seven subjects, a plasma GH peak (13 - 72 mμg/ml) lasting 1. 5 - 3. 5 hr appeared {{with the onset of}} deep sleep. Smaller GH peaks (6 - 14 mμg/ml) occasionally appeared during subsequent deep sleep phases. Peak GH secretion was delayed if the onset of sleep was delayed. Subjects who were awakened for 2 - 3 hr and allowed to return to sleep exhibited another peak of GH secretion (14 - 46 mμg/ml). Peak GH secretion was not correlated with changes in plasma glucose, insulin, and cortisol. The effects of 6 -CNS-active drugs on sleep-related GH secretion were investigated. Imipramine (50 mg) completely abolished GH peaks in two of four subjects, whereas chlorpromazine (30 mg), phenobarbital (97 mg), diphenylhydantoin (90 mg), chlordiazepoxide (20 mg), and <b>isocarboxazid</b> (30 mg) did not inhibit GH peaks. Altered hypothalamic activity associated with initiation of sleep results in a major peak of growth hormone secretion unrelated to hypoglycemia or changes in cortisol and insulin secretion...|$|E
40|$|Twenty-one {{patients}} with disabling spontaneous, reflex, or action myoclonus due to various causes, who had shown apparent clinical improvement on introduction of piracetam, entered a placebo-controlled double-blind crossover trial of piracetam (2. 4 - 16. 8 g daily). All but one patient had electrophysiological evidence of cortical myoclonus. Patients were randomly allocated to a 14 -day course of piracetam followed by identical placebo, or placebo followed by piracetam. Nineteen patients received piracetam/placebo {{in addition to}} their routine antimyoclonic treatment (carbamazepine, clonazepam, phenytoin, primidone, sodium valproate, or tryptophan plus <b>isocarboxazid,</b> alone or in combination) and two received piracetam/placebo as monotherapy. All patients were rated {{at the end of each}} treatment phase using stimulus sensitivity, motor, writing, functional disability, global assessment, and visual analogue scales. Ten of the 21 patients had to be rescued from the placebo phase of the trial because of a severe and intolerable exacerbation of their myoclonus. No patients required rescue from the piracetam phase of the double-blind trial. When the 21 patients were considered together, there was a significant improvement in motor, writing, functional disability, global assessment, and visual analogue scores during treatment with piracetam compared with placebo. The total rating score also improved significantly with piracetam, by a median of 22 %. Piracetam, usually in combination with other antimyoclonic drugs, is a useful treatment for myoclonus of cortical origin...|$|E
40|$|BACKGROUND: Depression is {{a common}} {{condition}} that has been frequently treated with psychotropics. AIMS: To review systematically the evidence of efficacy and acceptability of antidepressant and benzodiazepine treatments for patients with minor depression. METHOD: A systematic review and meta-analysis of double-blind randomised controlled trials comparing antidepressants or benzodiazepines v. placebo in adults with minor depression. Data were obtained from MEDLINE, CINAHL, EMBASE, PsycInfo, Cochrane Controlled Trials Register and pharmaceutical company websites. Risk of bias was assessed for the generation of the allocation sequence, allocation concealment, masking, incomplete outcome data, and sponsorship bias. RESULTS: Six studies met inclusion criteria. Three studies compared paroxetine with placebo; fluoxetine, amitriptyline and <b>isocarboxazid</b> were studied in one study each. No studies compared benzodiazepines with placebo. In terms of failures to respond to treatment (6 studies, 234 patients treated with antidepressants and 234 with placebo) {{no significant difference between}} antidepressants and placebo was found (relative risk (RR) 0. 94, 95 % CI 0. 81 - 1. 08). In terms of acceptability, data extracted from two studies (93 patients treated with antidepressants and 93 with placebo) showed no statistically significant difference between antidepressants and placebo (RR= 1. 06, 95 % CI 0. 65 - 1. 73). There was no statistically significant between-study heterogeneity for any of the reported analyses. CONCLUSIONS: There is evidence showing there is unlikely to be a clinically important advantage for antidepressants over placebo in individuals with minor depression. For benzodiazepines, no evidence is available, and thus {{it is not possible to}} determine their potential therapeutic role in this condition...|$|E
