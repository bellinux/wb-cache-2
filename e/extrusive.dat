The transitional crust of volcanic margins is composed of basaltic igneous rocks, including lava flows, sills, dykes, and gabbro.|$|R
25|$|<b>Extrusive</b> igneous rocks, {{also known}} as {{volcanic}} rocks, are formed at the crust's surface {{as a result of}} the partial melting of rocks within the mantle and crust. <b>Extrusive</b> igneous rocks cool and solidify quicker than intrusive igneous rocks. They are formed by the cooling of molten magma on the earth's surface. The magma, which is brought to the surface through fissures or volcanic eruptions, solidifies at a faster rate. Hence such rocks are smooth, crystalline and fine-grained. Basalt is a common <b>extrusive</b> igneous rock and forms lava flows, lava sheets and lava plateaus. Some kinds of basalt solidify to form long polygonal columns. The Giant's Causeway in Antrim, Northern Ireland is an example.|$|E

25|$|When magma cools {{it begins}} to form solid mineral phases. Some of these settle {{at the bottom of}} the magma chamber forming cumulates that might form mafic layered intrusions. Magma that cools slowly within a magma chamber usually ends up forming bodies of {{plutonic}} rocks such as gabbro, diorite and granite, depending upon the composition of the magma.

40|$|Newly sampled basaltic andesites and andesites {{from the}} tholeiitic Ferrar Supergroup of {{northern}} Victoria Land and George V Land, Antarctica, {{are attributed to}} the known low-Ti and high-Ti series. Aside from known sparsely distributed high-Ti <b>extrusives,</b> a high-Ti sill {{was found in the}} Alamein Range outside the Rennick Graben. Low-Ti lavas, sills and dikes display wide petrographical, mineral and geochemical variations, reflecting extensive in-situ differentiation. High-Ti rocks from Litell Rocks are homogeneous with respect to mineralogy and geochemistry, minor deviations are shown by the sampled sill. Chilled margins of low-Ti sills, dikes and lava flows exhibit nearly constant bulk-rock chemistry (mg# ~ 60) within the studied area. Compared to chilled margins from Tasmanian sills, the striking uniformity of the pre-emplacement chemistry of Ferrar magmas over large distances supports the magma transport model of Elliot et al. (1999, doi: 10. 1016 /S 0012 - 821 X(99) 00023 - 0). In the area investigated, compositional variations within the low-Ti series, caused by in-situ differentiation, increase towards the Wilson-Bowers Terrane boundary, possibly displaying the asymmetrical distribution of outcrops over this area. Absence of Ferrar occurrences east of the Bowers Terrane remains a matter of palaeo-geodynamic discussion. Besides, the secondary mineralogy of <b>extrusives</b> from Litell Rocks and Monument Nunataks exhibits noticeable differences, which indicates an elevated thermal gradient in the vicinity of Litell Rocks compared to Monument Nunataks during the Cretaceous...|$|R
40|$|Four dismembered massifs {{belonging}} to the Nain-Baft ophiolitic belt (Central Iran) stretch in a NW-SE direction parallel to the fossil active margin of the Iranian Continental Block (Sanandaj-Sirjan Zone). They are separated by huge transcurrent faults. The Nain, Dehshir, Shahr-e-Babak and Baft massifs are composed of associated slices of harzburgites, small bodies of gabbros and dike swarm complexes, accompanied by various <b>extrusives</b> from basaltic-andesitic lava flows and breccias to dacites and rhyolites. Trace element geochemistry of these lavas displays calc-alkaline and arc-tholeiite signatures, suggesting a back-arc origin for these ophiolites. This is {{in accordance with the}} position of these massifs, to the North of the Mesozoic Magmatic Arc crosscutting the Sanadaj-Sirjan Zone. Conventional K-Ar datings on amphibole within amphibolite and gabbros deliver ages between 93 Ma and 67 Ma. These ages are in good agreement with the stratigraphic age of the conformably Cenomanian to Maastrichtian sedimentary cover of the <b>extrusives.</b> The closure of these back-arc basins occurred in the Middle Paleocene as testified by the presence of neritic limestones, sealing all the tectonic contacts. The general geological setting of the Nain-Baft belt suggests that these massifs generated in a transtensional small back-arc basins separated by transcurrent faults.

40|$|Metal-oxide and {{sulphide}} deposits, chemically {{similar to}} the hydrothermal deposits of modern and ancient oceanic spreading axes, occur of the two areas of the Argolis Peninsula of the Peloponnesus, Greece. In the first, in northeastern and central Argolis, manganese ores immediately overlie MORB-type <b>extrusives</b> of mid-Jurassic age. After Triassic rifting this oceanic crust formed during Jurassic time and was then tectonically emplaced over the adjacent continental margin in the Late Jurassic. The manganese ores (Palea Epidavros) were precipitated from low-temperature hydrothermal vent waters on the axis of a relatively unrifted ocean ridge, which was possibly slow-spreading. The deep-sea sediment cover comprises pelagic carbonate accumulated on the ridge flanks, then ribbon radiolarites deposited on the abyssal plain below the CCD, located close enough to a continental margin to allow deposition of shallow water-derived calciturbidites. In the second area, Ermioni, in the southern Argolis Peninsula (Adheres), massive sulphides and metalliferous oxide sediments occur with mafic <b>extrusives</b> and terrigenous turbidites. Although previously regarded as a single stratigraphical succession (""Shale-sandstone Formation""), the mafic lavas and metal deposits are interpreted here as ophiolitic slices that were incorporated into the turbidites by thrusting, possibly as a trench-accretionary complex. The massive sulphides were precipatated from high-temperature vents sited near the axis of a relatively unrifted spreading ridge which was possibly fast-spreading. Ferruginous (ochres) and ferromanganiferous (umbers) oxide sediments were dispersed around these vents, whereas strongly fractionated manganese ores precipitated from separate low-temperature hydrothermal sites.

25|$|Pumice is {{composed}} of highly microvesicular glass pyroclastic with very thin, translucent bubble walls of <b>extrusive</b> igneous rock. It is commonly, but not exclusively of silicic or felsic to intermediate in composition (e.g., rhyolitic, dacitic, andesite, pantellerite, phonolite, trachyte), but basaltic and other compositions are known. Pumice is commonly pale in color, ranging from white, cream, blue or grey, to green-brown or black. It forms when volcanic gases exsolving from viscous magma form bubbles that remain within the viscous magma as it cools to glass. Pumice is a common product of explosive eruptions (plinian and ignimbrite-forming) and commonly forms zones in upper parts of silicic lavas. Pumice has an average porosity of 90%, and initially floats on water.|$|E

25|$|Age {{relations}} among structural features are not readily apparent. In the Bach region, the youngest craters cut by a scarp are of c4 age; the oldest crater to superpose a scarp is a c3. These relations suggest that scarp formation occurred in c3 to c4 time. Very smooth plains material flanks some scarps and ridges and, if {{the material is}} ponded <b>extrusives</b> or mass-wasted products, may postdate the structures. Scarps and ridges are abundant in intercrater, intermediate, and smooth plains units, {{but they are not}} embayed by intermediate and intercrater plains materials. These relations suggest that the structures began to form after emplacement of these two oldest plains units. Some of the oldest craters and basins, such as Cervantes, have polygonal shapes at least as marked as more recent craters, suggesting that some structural lineaments are older than c1 craters.|$|R
25|$|The Spratly Islands {{consist of}} islands, reefs, banks and shoals that consist of {{biogenic}} carbonate.

25|$|The geology of Duluth {{demonstrates}} the Midcontinent Rift, formed as the North American continent (Laurentia) began to split apart about 1.1 billion years ago. Continental rifting is a recurring {{process in the}} history of the earth that leads to break-up of continents and the formation of ocean basins. In the Lake Superior region, the upwelling of molten rock may have been the result of a hot spot that produced a dome over the Lake Superior area. As the earth's crust thinned, magma rose toward the surface. When insulated by overlying roof rock, the upwelling magma cooled slowly, and is therefore coarse-grained. These intrusions formed a sill some 16km thick, primarily of gabbro, which is known as the Duluth Complex. In the areas where the rising magma erupted to the surface and cooled rapidly, basalt, the <b>extrusive</b> equivalent of gabbro, was formed.|$|E
25|$|Exposed {{within the}} {{interior}} of the Richat Structure are a variety of intrusive and <b>extrusive</b> igneous rocks. They include rhyolitic volcanic rocks, gabbros, carbonatites and kimberlites. The rhyolitic rocks consist of lava flows and hydrothermally altered tuffaceous rocks that are part of two distinct eruptive centers, which are interpreted to be the eroded remains of two maars. According to field mapping and aeromagnetic data, the gabbroic rocks form two concentric ring dikes. The inner ring dike is about 20m in width and lies about 3km from the center of Richat Structure. The outer ring dike is about 50m in width and lies about 7 to 8km from the center of this structure. Thirty-two carbonatite dikes and sills have been mapped within the Richat Structure. The dikes are generally about 300m long and typically 1 to 4m wide. They consist of massive carbonatites that are mostly devoid of vesicles. The carbonatite rocks have been dated as having cooled between 94 and 104million years ago. A kimberlitic plug and several sills have been found within {{the northern part of the}} Richat Structure. The kimberlite plug has been dated to around 99million years old. These intrusive igneous rocks are interpreted as indicating the presence of a large alkaline igneous intrusion that currently underlies the Richat Structure and created it by uplifting the overlying rock.|$|E
2500|$|Ridges {{may have}} been formed by several processes, {{including}} tectonism and extrusion, {{or they may be}} buried crater-rim segments.
