5|$|Based on the {{analysis}} of rat and human urine by gas chromatography and mass spectrometry, mephedrone {{is thought to be}} metabolised by three phase 1 pathways. It can be demethylated to the primary amine (producing compounds 2, 3 and 5), the ketone <b>group</b> <b>can</b> be reduced (producing 3) or the tolyl <b>group</b> <b>can</b> be oxidised (producing 6). Both 5 and 6 are thought to be further metabolised by conjugation to the glucuronide and sulfate derivatives. Knowledge of the primary routes of metabolism should allow the intake of mephedrone to be confirmed by drug tests, as well as more accurate determination of the causes of side effects and potential for toxicity.|$|E

Symbols of <b>grouping</b> <b>can</b> be removed using the associative and distributive laws, also they can be removed if the expression inside the symbol of grouping is sufficiently simplified so no ambiguity results from their removal.|$|R
5|$|Alcohols do not {{normally}} behave as acids in water, but {{the presence of}} a double bond adjacent to the OH <b>group</b> <b>can</b> substantially decrease the pKa by the mechanism of keto–enol tautomerism. Ascorbic acid is an example of this effect. The diketone 2,4-pentanedione (acetylacetone) is also a weak acid because of the keto–enol equilibrium. In aromatic compounds, such as phenol, which have an OH substituent, conjugation with the aromatic ring as a whole greatly increases the stability of the deprotonated form.|$|E
5|$|Given a {{set with}} an {{addition}} operation, one cannot always define a corresponding subtraction operation on that set; {{the set of}} natural numbers is a simple example. On the other hand, a subtraction operation uniquely determines an addition operation, an additive inverse operation, and an additive identity; for this reason, an additive <b>group</b> <b>can</b> {{be described as a}} set that is closed under subtraction.|$|E
5|$|Legally, the ACLU {{consists}} of two separate but closely affiliated nonprofit organizations: the American Civil Liberties Union, a 501(c)(4) social welfare group, and the ACLU Foundation, a 501(c)(3) public charity. Both organizations engage in civil rights litigation, advocacy, and education, but only donations to the 501(c)(3) foundation are tax deductible, and only the 501(c)(4) <b>group</b> <b>can</b> engage in unlimited political lobbying. The two organizations share office space and employees.|$|E

5|$|Riemannian {{manifolds}} are manifolds whose tangent {{spaces are}} endowed with a suitable inner product. Derived therefrom, the Riemann curvature tensor encodes all curvatures of a manifold in one object, which finds applications in general relativity, for example, where the Einstein curvature tensor describes {{the matter and}} energy content of space-time. The tangent space of a Lie <b>group</b> <b>can</b> be given naturally {{the structure of a}} Lie algebra and can be used to classify compact Lie groups.|$|E
5|$|The Lorentz {{group is}} a Lie group and has as such a Lie algebra, The Lie algebra is a vector space of {{matrices}} {{that can be said}} to model the group near the identity. It is endowed with a multiplication operation, the Lie bracket. With it, the product in the <b>group</b> <b>can</b> near the identity be expressed in Lie algebraic terms (but not in a particularly simple way). The link between the (matrix) Lie algebra and the (matrix) Lie group is the matrix exponential. It is one-to-one near the identity in the group.|$|E

5|$|A {{variety of}} psychoactive {{drugs and alcohol}} have notable effects on consciousness. These range from a simple dulling of {{awareness}} produced by sedatives, to increases in the intensity of sensory qualities produced by stimulants, cannabis, empathogens–entactogens such as MDMA ("Ecstasy"), or most notably by the class of drugs known as psychedelics. LSD, mescaline, psilocybin, Dimethyltryptamine, and others in this <b>group</b> <b>can</b> produce major distortions of perception, including hallucinations; some users even describe their drug-induced experiences as mystical or spiritual in quality. The brain mechanisms underlying these effects are not as well understood as those induced by use of alcohol, but there is substantial evidence that alterations in the brain system that uses the chemical neurotransmitter serotonin play an essential role.|$|E
5|$|For finite-dimensional representations, the {{presence}} of semisimplicity means that the Lorentz <b>group</b> <b>can</b> be dealt with {{the same way as}} other semisimple groups using a well-developed theory. In addition, all representations are built from the irreducible ones, since the Lie algebra possesses the complete reducibility property. But, the non-compactness of the Lorentz group, in combination with lack of simple connectedness, cannot be dealt with in all the aspects as in the simple framework that applies to simply connected, compact groups. Non-compactness implies, for a connected simple Lie group, that no nontrivial finite-dimensional unitary representations exist. Lack of simple connectedness gives rise to spin representations of the group. The non-connectedness means that, for representations of the full Lorentz group, time reversal and space inversion has to dealt with separately.|$|E
5|$|Hydrogen cyanide is a {{poisonous}} gas that interferes with cellular respiration. Cyanide prevents the cell from producing adenosine triphosphate (ATP) by binding {{to one of}} the proteins involved in the electron transport chain. This protein, cytochrome c oxidase, contains several subunits and has ligands containing iron groups. The cyanide component of Zyklon B can bind at one of these iron groups, heme a3, forming a more stabilized compound through metal-to-ligand pi bonding. As a result of the formation of this new iron-cyanide complex, the electrons that would situate themselves on the heme a3 <b>group</b> <b>can</b> no longer do so. Instead, these electrons destabilize the compound; thus, the heme group no longer accept them. Consequently, electron transport is halted, and cells can no longer produce the energy needed to synthesize ATP. In a human weighing , death occurs within two minutes of inhaling 70mg of hydrogen cyanide.|$|E

5|$|The clade Neoceratopsia {{includes}} all ceratopsians more derived than psittacosaurids. Another subset of neoceratopsians is called Coronosauria, which currently {{includes all}} ceratopsians more derived than Auroraceratops. Coronosaurs show the first {{development of the}} neck frill and the fusion of the first several neck vertebrae to support the increasingly heavy head. Within Coronosauria, three groups are generally recognized, although the membership of these groups varies somewhat from study to study and some animals may not fit in any of them. One <b>group</b> <b>can</b> be called Protoceratopsidae and includes Protoceratops and its closest relatives, all Asian. Another group, Leptoceratopsidae, includes mostly North American animals that are {{more closely related to}} Leptoceratops. The Ceratopsoidea includes animals like Zuniceratops, which are more closely related to the family Ceratopsidae. This last family includes Triceratops and all the large North American ceratopsians and is further divided into the subfamilies Centrosaurinae and Ceratopsinae (also known as Chasmosaurinae).|$|E
5|$|When the Kindred escort {{the agents}} {{out of the}} village, Mulder {{comments}} {{on the lack of}} children in the community and states that he recognizes some of the faces from photographs taken in the 1930s. Curious, he returns to the village that night, and hears chanting as a procession of the Kindred moves to a barn. Scully is led off by Brother Andrew, who claims {{to be able to give}} her information about the murderer, whom he calls Brother Martin. Downstairs in the barn, the <b>group</b> <b>can</b> be seen bathing Brother Aaron's body in watery clay. Mulder hides in a crevice, where he discovers that the sick man has been buried alive and has begun to take on feminine features. Meanwhile, Brother Andrew uses his power to seduce Scully. She is unable to resist, and is on the verge of succumbing before Mulder comes to her aid. The agents are again escorted out of the village.|$|E
5|$|The Returners set out {{to search}} for Terra and {{eventually}} trace her {{to the city of}} Zozo, though they are still shocked by her apparent existence as an esper. There, they also meet the esper Ramuh, who tells them that if they free various other espers from the Magitek Research Facility in the Empire's capital, Vector, they may find one who can help Terra. Vector is on the southern continent, to which the Empire does not allow maritime access, so the Returners go to the Opera House and recruit Setzer Gabbiani, who {{is believed to be the}} owner of the Blackjack, the only airship in the world. They then travel to Vector and attempt to rescue several espers, including Maduin, who is revealed to be Terra's father. However, the espers are already dying from the experiments at Vector, and choose instead to give their lives to transform into magicite—the crystallized remains of the espers' essences that form when they die and allow others to use their powers. The dying espers bestow their magicite upon the Returners. Before the <b>group</b> <b>can</b> then escape, Kefka arrives and causes the Returners, including Locke, to momentarily doubt Celes' loyalty, much to her anguish. However, she provides proof to them of her support by covering for the group while the rest escape. The rest of the group then returns to Zozo, where Terra reacts to the magicite of her father, prompting her to gain knowledge of her past and accept herself as the half-human, half-esper child of Maduin and a human woman.|$|E
