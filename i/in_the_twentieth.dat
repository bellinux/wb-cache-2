5|$|During {{the nineteenth}} century, The Fairchild Family was {{renowned for its}} {{realistic}} portrayal of childhood and its humor, but Sherwood's book fell from favor as Britain became increasingly secularized and new fashions in children's literature came to dominate the literary scene, represented by works such as Lewis Carroll's Alice's Adventures in Wonderland. <b>In</b> <b>the</b> <b>twentieth</b> century the books have most often been viewed as quintessential examples of the didactic style of children's writing popular before Alice.|$|E

5|$|In 1900, {{only one}} in five American {{families}} had a Christmas tree. While America never lacked for real trees, the time and expense of retrieving them from the wild was significant.

In the 1920s, real trees became commonplace, supplanting artificial trees in American homes.|$|E

5|$|In {{the nineteenth}} century Białystok was an {{important}} center for light industry, which {{was the reason for}} the substantial growth of the city's population.

However, after the fall of communism in 1989 many of these factories faced severe problems and subsequently closed down.|$|E

5000|$|Though the [...]25 ACP was {{designed}} for semi-automatic pistols, various [...]25 ACP revolvers were produced <b>in</b> <b>the</b> early <b>twentieth</b> century by Belgian, French, and German gunmakers such as Adolph Frank and Decker. <b>In</b> <b>the</b> late <b>twentieth</b> century, Bowen Classic Arms produced a custom Smith & Wesson revolver in [...]25 ACP.|$|R
5|$|<b>In</b> <b>the</b> <b>twentieth</b> {{century the}} {{distinctive}} Scottish use of stone architecture declined {{as it was}} replaced by cheaper alternatives such as Portland cement, concrete, and mass-production brick. Stone would however be retained as a material for some housing stock in Edinburgh, Aberdeen and Dumfries, and would undergo revivals. <b>In</b> <b>the</b> <b>twentieth</b> century private architecture was increasingly client driven. James Robert Rhind (1854–1918), the son of David Rhind, was successful in the competition for new libraries to be constructed in Glasgow following Andrew Carnegie's gift of £100,000 to the city in 1901. His designs were selected for seven libraries, allowing him to demonstrate his individual interpretation of Edwardian Baroque architecture. Rhind's libraries were all built with locally quarried sandstone, which blended in with the existing tenement neighbourhoods. His landmark buildings were greatly enhanced by his liberal use of columns, domes and sculpted features. James Miller (1860–1947) is noted for his Scottish railway stations, such as his 1901–05 extensions to Glasgow Central railway station, and the spectacular Wemyss Bay railway station on the Firth of Clyde.|$|E
5|$|<b>In</b> <b>the</b> <b>twentieth</b> century, new {{building}} methods, particularly concrete and steel were used, and the exterior was essentially facing.

5|$|The Ama are Japanese skin divers, {{predominantly}} women, who traditionally {{dive for}} shellfish and seaweed {{wearing only a}} loincloth and {{who have been in}} action for at least 2,000 years. Starting <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>twentieth</b> century, they have increasingly been regarded as a tourist attraction. They operate off reefs near the shore, and some perform for sightseers instead of diving to collect a harvest. They have been romanticized as mermaids.|$|E
5|$|The German {{occupation}} of Luxembourg in World War I {{was the first}} of two military occupations of the Grand Duchy of Luxembourg by Germany <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>twentieth</b> century. From August 1914 until the end of World War I on 11 November 1918, Luxembourg was under full occupation by the German Empire. The German government justified the occupation by citing the need to support their armies in neighbouring France, although many Luxembourgers, contemporary and present, have interpreted German actions otherwise.|$|E
5|$|There {{are three}} {{principal}} {{approaches to the}} design of the heat sinks that collect the moisture in air wells: high mass, radiative and active.
