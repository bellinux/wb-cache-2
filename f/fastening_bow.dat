60|$|They {{turned around}} and found a man {{standing}} {{on the floor in}} the center of the cave, who bowed very politely when he saw he had attracted their attention. He was a very old man, bent nearly double; but the queerest thing about him was his white hair and beard. These were so long that they reached to his feet, and both the hair and the beard were carefully plaited into many braids, and the end of each braid <b>fastened</b> with a <b>bow</b> of colored ribbon.|$|R
60|$|The {{first thing}} that the victor did was to send for the knight {{to thank him for}} his timely help, and to ask what gift he could bestow on him in token of gratitude. 'Your Majesty's ear,' {{answered}} the knight; and as the king could not go back from his word, he cut it off and gave it to him. Paperarello <b>bowed,</b> <b>fastened</b> the ear inside his surcoat and rode away. In the evening, when they all returned from the battle, there he was, sitting in the road, making clay dolls.|$|R
60|$|The mode of {{proceeding}} {{having been}} settled, all hands {{went to work}} without delay. The goods were carried {{to the top of}} the fall, which was about fifteen feet high, then the canoe was shouldered by Waller and Bounce, and soon it floated in a calm eddy near the head of the cataract. Having replaced the cargo, a strong line or rope was <b>fastened</b> to the <b>bows,</b> and Redhand and Bounce proceeded to take their places in the canoe, in order to guide it through the rapid, while the others were engaged in hauling on the track-line.|$|R
60|$|He {{always wore}} round his neck a stiff-starched deep white handkerchief, not <b>fastened</b> with a <b>bow</b> in front, the ends being tucked in {{so as to}} be invisible. This cravat not only covered his throat but his chin also, so that his head seemed to grow forth from it without the aid of any neck; and he had a trick of turning his face round within it, an inch or two to the right or to the left, in a manner which seemed to {{indicate}} that his cranium was loose and might be removed at pleasure.|$|R
60|$|He {{went to the}} <b>bow,</b> <b>fastened</b> two logs of wood by {{long lines}} to the cables outside the bow, {{so that he could}} find and recover the anchors on his return, then a very small jib was hoisted, and as it filled two blows with an axe severed the cables inboard. The logs {{attached}} to them were thrown over, and the skipper ran aft and put up the helm as the boat's head payed off before the wind. As she did so a wave struck her and threw tons of water on board, filling her deck nearly up to the rails. It was well Joe had shouted to the boys to hold on, for had they not done so they would have been swept overboard.|$|R
60|$|At {{the proper}} word of command, the boys {{got into the}} boat and took their several stations. Marco took his place forward to act as bowman. It {{is the duty of}} the bowman to keep a lookout forward, that the boat does not run into any danger; and also, when the boat comes to land, to step out first and hold it by the painter, that is, the rope which is <b>fastened</b> to the <b>bow,</b> while the others get out. Marco had a pole, with an iron spike and also an iron hook in the end of it, which he used to fend off with, as they called it, when the boat was in danger of running against any obstacle. This was called a boat-hook.|$|R
50|$|Daniel W. Voorhees is a plaster {{sculpture}} {{that has}} been painted white. The bust measures 31 in by 27 in by 18 in. Voorhees gazes slightly upward to his proper left, and his proper right eyebrow is raised. His hair is combed away from a side part on the proper left of his scalp. His handlebar moustache obscures his mouth and reaches his chin in length. A frock coat with a notched lapel is worn over a vest and a high-collared shirt buttoned up to the neck, where a stock-tie is <b>fastened</b> into a <b>bow.</b> The bust sits upon a pedestal of olive branches that partially envelope a coat of arms or crest, which feature eleven stars and seven stripes.|$|R
5000|$|The {{so-called}} [...] "manual-means-of-execution", the Ustaše's favorites, were executions {{that took}} part in utilizing sharp or blunt craftsmen tools: knives, saws, hammers, etc. The preferred manual-weapon of many Ustaše guards was the Srbosjek (or Serbcutter). This knife was originally a type of agricultural knife manufactured for wheat sheaf cutting. The {{upper part of the}} knife was made of leather, as a sort of a glove, designed to be worn with the thumb going through the hole, so that only the blade protruded from the hand. It was a curved, 12 cm long knife with the edge on its concave side. The knife was <b>fastened</b> to a <b>bowed</b> oval copper plate, while the plate was fastened to a thick leather bangle.|$|R
60|$|In {{spite of}} his fatigue, the prince slept badly, and {{directly}} it was light he rose, and bidding Becasigue remain where he was, as he wished to be alone, he strolled out into the forest. He walked on slowly, just as his fancy led him, till, suddenly, {{he came to a}} wide open space, and in the middle was the white doe quietly eating her breakfast. She bounded off {{at the sight of a}} man, but not before the prince, who had <b>fastened</b> on his <b>bow</b> without thinking, had let fly several arrows, which the fairy Tulip took care should do her no harm. But, quickly as she ran, she soon felt her strength failing her, for fifteen years of life in a tower had not taught her how to exercise her limbs.|$|R
60|$|So soon as ever {{they were}} seated {{side by side}} in the stern it was pushed off, and rowed away rapidly into the darkness, while one of the sailors lit a lantern which he <b>fastened</b> to the <b>bow,</b> and far out on the river, as though in answer to the signal, another star of light appeared, towards which they headed. Now Margaret, {{speaking}} through the gloom, asked the rowers of her father's state; but the sailor, their guide, prayed her not to trouble them, as the tide ran very swiftly and they must give all their mind to their business lest they should overset. So she was silent, and, racked with doubts and fears, watched that star of light growing ever nearer, till at length it hung above them.|$|R
60|$|The task which Glynn had {{undertaken}} to perform {{turned out to}} be more dangerous and difficult than at first he had anticipated. When he stood at the lee <b>bow,</b> <b>fastening</b> a small cord round his waist, and looking at the turmoil of water into which he was about to plunge, his heart well-nigh failed him, and he felt a sensation of regret that he had undertaken what seemed now an impossibility. He did not wonder that the men had one and all shrunk from the attempt. But he had made up his mind to do it. Moreover, he had said he would do it, and feeling that he imperilled his life in a good cause, he set his face as a flint to the accomplishment of his purpose.|$|R
5000|$|The {{construction}} was originally {{a type of}} wheat sheaf knife, manufactured prior to and during World War II by the German factory Gebrüder Gräfrath from Solingen-Widdert, under the trademark [...] "Gräwiso". The {{upper part of the}} knife was made of leather, as a sort of a glove, designed to be worn with the thumb going through the hole, so that only the blade protruded from the hand. It was a curved, 12 cm knife with the edge on its concave side. The knife was <b>fastened</b> to a <b>bowed</b> oval copper plate, while the plate was fastened to a thick leather bangle. Its agricultural purpose was to enable field workers to cut wheat sheaves open before threshing them. The knife was fixed on the glove plate to prevent injuries and to increase work speed.|$|R

5000|$|In the Middle Ages {{the wearing}} of a hood {{was a sign that}} the woman was married. Their forms were {{subjected}} to their respective fashions. Old Bavaria developed the Rococo cap that was in its original form made from white linen and had the hair almost entirely enclosed in a small, circular cap form and <b>fastened</b> with a <b>bow</b> on the top. The ribbon bow at the neck gradually evolved from a functional bow to a mere symbol of a bow, as is typical of a Riegelhaube. With the abolition of the feudal dress code {{at the end of the}} 18th century citizens were allowed in the open streets to wear textiles made with silver and gold. Caps were now being made with precious brocade and velvet fabrics and embroidered with beads and threads of precious metals. The size of the head cover at the same time grew smaller and smaller, becoming held with only [...] "hood pins" [...] made of silver.|$|R
60|$|I {{sprang up}} burning with eager excitement. I heard the shrieks of the ill-fated victims, as {{one by one}} they walked the plank, which, {{fortunately}} for the success of my design, was thrust out {{on the other side of}} the ship. A crowbar enabled me to wrench off the grappling-irons. Two cuts of a large axe severed the cable that had been <b>fastened</b> to the <b>bow,</b> and the vessel's head fell slowly off. As it did so, all the sails filled with a sudden clap. This was observed: I heard a shout, and saw the pirates spring on the bulwarks of the prize. I flew rather than ran to the stern, where the cable that held the vessel was rigid as a bar of iron. One blow cut it, and the rope recoiled violently in the faces of the men who laid hold of it. Next moment the pirate ship was heading away before a stiff breeze which was quickly freshening to a gale. As I sprang to the helm, a shower of musket and pistol bullets tore up the deck round me, and I heard the captain's voice give the order to load the guns.|$|R
60|$|Two {{days later}} the mules were brought round to the door at sunrise, and Harry and his brother sallied out from the hotel, dressed {{for the first time}} in the Peruvian costume. They were both warmly clothed. On their heads were felt hats with broad brims, which could be pulled down and tied over the ears, both for warmth and to prevent their being blown away by the fierce winds that sweep down the gorges. A thick poncho of llama wool fell from their {{shoulders}} to their knees, and loosely tied round their necks were thick and brightly-coloured scarves. They wore high boots, and carried large knives stuck in a strap below the knee. The rifles were <b>fastened</b> at the <b>bow</b> of their saddles, and their wallets, with provisions for the day, were strapped behind. By the advice of Dias each had in his pocket a large pair of green goggles, to protect their eyes from the glare of sun and snow. They tied these on before coming downstairs, and both agreed that had they met unexpectedly in the street they would have passed each other without the slightest recognition.|$|R
2500|$|The bow {{section of}} the Hasholme logboat has a most {{original}} design. It is made of two parts, lower and upper bow timbers, which together formed a front enclosure to the log.

5000|$|The {{coat of arms}} of Haarlem {{consists}} of a red shield with a silver sword with golden handle under a white Jerusalem cross and flanked by 4 white six-pointed stars. Above the shield is the Imperial Crown of Austria under barren branches holding two Damiate bells, all held up by two golden lions standing on the motto of Haarlem. Several heraldic elements have their basis {{in the history of}} Haarlem.The motto of Haarlem is Vicit vim virtus (Latin for virtue conquered violence). The barren branches refer to the burned trees in the Haarlemmerhout, which were burned again and again during various sieges, most notably during the siege by the army of Jacqueline, Countess of Hainaut in 1428. Haarlem had taken side with the Cods in the Hook and Cod wars, and thus against Jacoba of Bavaria. The bells refer to the damiaatjes. Two bells were given to the city of Haarlem's St. Bavochurch to commemorate the heroic cutting of the harbour chain during the Siege of Damietta (1218) with a [...] "saw ship", a legendary ship equipped with an iron saw <b>fastened</b> along the <b>bow</b> and front keel. This ship sawed through the harbour chain and allowed the fleet to attack the city, which was a success.|$|R
60|$|I {{doubt if}} any man could tell how any woman was dressed ten minutes {{after he had}} left her. He recollected a blue skirt, {{and then there was}} {{something}} that carried the dress on, as it were, up to the neck. Possibly, this may have been a blouse; he retained a dim vision of a belt; but what sort of a blouse? Was it green, or yellow, or blue? Had it a collar, or was it <b>fastened</b> with a <b>bow?</b> Were there feathers in her hat, or flowers? Or was it a hat at all? He dared not say, for fear of making a mistake and being sent miles after the wrong party. The two young women giggled, which in his then state of mind irritated Harris. The young man, who appeared anxious to get rid of him, suggested the police station at the next town. Harris made his way there. The police gave him a piece of paper, and told him to write down a full description of his wife, together with details of when and where he had lost her. He did not know where he had lost her; all he could tell them {{was the name of the}} village where he had lunched. He knew he had her with him then, and that they had started from there together.|$|R
50|$|The bow {{section of}} the Hasholme logboat has a most {{original}} design. It is made of two parts, lower and upper bow timbers, which together formed a front enclosure to the log. The lower bow piece is 60 cm long and 2 cm thick. On {{both sides of this}} timber there are symmetrical rebates which match similar rebates on the main hull as well as series of cleats with transverse holes through which the second and third transverse timbers passed. Those transverse timbers, three in total, not only <b>fasten</b> the lower <b>bow</b> timber to both sides of the hull, but also strengthened and linked the bow section. Forward of the groove for the foremost timber, there were three large vertical holes. The upper bow piece is also around 60 cm long and has a rather complex shape.

Those tree-nails were approximately 35 cm long and 0.6 cm (¼ in) thick.|$|R
5000|$|The Damiaatjes {{refer to}} two bells in the St. Bavochurch of Haarlem that ring every night between nine and nine thirty, {{to signal the}} closing of the city's gates and commemorate the conquest of the Egyptian city Damietta during the Siege of Damietta (1218). Though Haarlem no longer has a wall around the city, or gates to close, the bells are still rung every evening. Damietta is also {{mentioned}} during the Fifth Crusade in 1218/1219, and again during the Seventh crusade in the year 1249.The Haarlem story claims that Haarlem knights and innovative shipbuilders {{played an important role in}} the fall of Damietta. Access to the city via the Nile was closed with a large, heavy harbor chain. A Haarlem ship with a saw on the bow (in Dutch called the [...] "zaagschip") was equipped with an iron saw <b>fastened</b> along the <b>bow</b> and front keel. This ship sawed through the Damietta harbour chain and allowed the fleet to attack the city, which was a success. The Damietta story is however contradicted by the eyewitness account of Oliver of Cologne, who led the Dutch fleet, and who never mentioned the heroic actions of the Haarlem knights. The story gained in popularity after 1667 when the Dutch fleet broke another chain to win an important naval victory. Haarlem declared itself the inspiration for this deed.|$|R
60|$|The {{vessel was}} nearly two hundred tons burden. She had {{originally}} been built very strongly, and might even have ventured on a voyage to the Polar seas just as she was. But Captain Harvey resolved to take every precaution to insure {{the success of his}} voyage, and the safety and comfort of his men. He, therefore, had the whole of the ship's bottom sheathed with thick hardwood planking, which was carried up above her water-line, as high as the ordinary floe-ice would be likely to reach. The hull inside was strengthened with stout cross-beams, as well as with beams running {{along the length of the}} vessel, and in every part that was likely to be subjected to pressure iron stanchions were <b>fastened.</b> But the <b>bow</b> of the vessel was the point where the utmost strength was aimed at. Inside, just behind the cutwater, the whole space was so traversed by cross-beams of oak that it almost became a solid mass, and outside the sharp stem was cased in iron so as to resemble a giant's chisel. The false keel was taken off, the whole vessel, in short, was rendered as strong, outside and in, as wood and iron and skill could make her. It need scarcely be said that all the other arrangements about her were made with the greatest care and without regard to expense, for although the owners of the brig did not wish to waste their money, they set too high a value on human life to risk it for the sake of saving a few pounds. She was provisioned for a cruise of two years and a half. But this was in case of accidents, for Captain Harvey did not intend to be absent much longer than one year.|$|R
60|$|From {{early morning}} till sunset they toiled {{during the next}} three days, almost without cessation, except for meals. They cut their way from {{the margin of the}} river, where the rocks and ground shelved so steeply that one false step of any of the men would have been {{followed}} by a headlong plunge into the water. Over the ridge, and down into a hollow beyond, and up the mountain farther on, they hewed a broad track, by which they conveyed the baggage and then carried up the canoe. This latter was an extremely difficult operation at {{the first part of the}} road, requiring the united efforts of the whole party. Being lifted on the shoulders of some of the men, the tracking-rope was <b>fastened</b> to the <b>bow,</b> and others of the party went in advance and took a couple of turns of the rope round a stump. The bearers then advanced steadily up the steep side of the mountain till they reached those who, by holding on to the rope, relieved them of any downward weight. The rope was then shifted to a stump farther up, and the advance was continued. Thus they may be said to have warped the canoe up the mountain! By two in the afternoon everything was got to the summit. Then Mackenzie, axe in hand, led the way forward. The progress was slow, the work exhausting. Through every species of country they cut their way. Here the trees were large and the ground encumbered with little underwood; there, the land was strewn with the trunks of fallen timber, where fire had passed with desolating power years before, and in its place had sprung up extensive copses of so close a growth, and so choked up with briars, that it was all but impossible to cut through them. Poplar, birch, cypress, red-pine, spruce, willow, alder, arrow-wood, red-wood, hard, and other trees,--all fell before the bright axes of the voyageurs, with gooseberry-bushes, currant-bushes, briars, and other shrubs innumerable. It must not be supposed that they did this heavy work with absolute impunity. No, there was many a bruise and blow from falling trees, and even the shrubs were successful not only in tearing trousers and leggings, but also in doing considerable damage to skin and flesh. So toilsome was the labour, that at the close of one of the days they had advanced only three miles.|$|R
60|$|Next {{morning we}} {{commenced}} the ascent of Lac la Pluie River. This is decidedly {{the most beautiful}} river we had yet traversed--not only {{on account of the}} luxuriant foliage of every hue with which its noble banks are covered, but chiefly from the resemblance it bears in many places to the scenery of England, recalling to mind the grassy lawns and verdant banks of Britain's streams, and transporting the beholder from the wild scenes of the western world to his native home. The trees along its banks were larger and more varied than any we had hitherto seen--ash, poplar, cedar, red and white pines, oak, and birch being abundant, whilst flowers of gaudy hues enhanced the beauty of the scene. Towards noon our guide kept a sharp lookout for a convenient spot whereon to dine; and ere long a flat shelving rock, partly shaded by trees and partly exposed to the blaze of the sun, presented itself to view. The canoe was soon alongside of it, and kept floating about half a foot from the edge by means of two branches, the two ends of which were <b>fastened</b> to the <b>bow</b> and stern of the canoe, and the other two to the ground by means of huge stones. It is necessary to be thus careful with canoes, as the gum or pitch with which the seams are plastered breaks off in lumps, particularly in cold weather, and makes the craft leaky. A snow-white napkin was spread on the flattest part of the rock, and so arranged that, as we reclined around it, on cloaks and blankets, our bodies down to the knees were shaded by the luxuriant foliage behind us, while our feet were basking in the solar rays! Upon the napkin were presently placed, by our active waiter Gibault, three pewter plates, a decanter of port wine, and a large ham, together with a turret of salt butter, and a loaf of bread, to the demolition of which viands we devoted ourselves with great earnestness. At a short distance the men circled round a huge lump of boiled pork, each with a large slice of bread {{in one hand and a}} knife in the other, with which he porked his bread in the same way that civilised people butter theirs! Half an hour concluded our mid-day meal; and then, casting off the branches from the canoe, we were out of sight of our temporary dining-room in five minutes.|$|R
