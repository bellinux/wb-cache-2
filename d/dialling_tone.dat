50|$|In the London {{telephone}} area, {{calls to}} subscribers {{who were not}} serviced by Director telephone systems within local call-charging range of the London Director exchange area were carried by tandem exchange Toll A: a subscriber would dial a prefix code, usually three letters, followed {{by the number of}} the other subscriber on the fringe non-director exchange. Calls from fringe non-director exchanges to numbers within the director area were passed in two ways. For those to director exchanges near the area boundary adjacent to the non-director exchange, subscribers were given codes to dial, and told to follow the code with the numerical portion of the other subscriber's number. For director exchanges remote from the area boundary, the subscriber was told to dial 7, to wait for a second <b>dialling</b> <b>tone,</b> and to follow this with the whole of the other number. These calls were handled by tandem exchange Toll B, from which the second <b>dialling</b> <b>tone</b> originated. To have a second <b>dialling</b> <b>tone</b> in this way was very unusual on the PSTN in the UK, although the French and Belgian PTTs had a similar instruction for when their customers made international calls.|$|E

5000|$|<b>Dial</b> <b>Tone</b> is briefly {{mentioned}} in the fiction novel 6 Sick Hipsters. In the story, the character Paul Achting spent four years collecting G.I.

Slaughter [...] "speaking on a transistor radio to <b>Dial</b> <b>Tone,</b> the communications specialist, back at G.I. Joe headquarters".|$|R
5000|$|Before modern {{electronic}} telephone switching systems came into use, dial tones were usually generated by electromechanical means. In the United States, the standard [...] "city" [...] dial tone was a 600 Hz tone that was amplitude-modulated at 120 Hz. Some dial tones were simply adapted from 60 Hz AC line current. In the UK, the standard Post Office <b>dialling</b> <b>tone</b> was 33 Hz; it was {{generated by a}} motor-driven ringing machine in most exchanges, and by a vibrating-reed generator in the smaller ones. Some later ringing machines also generated a 50 Hz dial tone.|$|E

50|$|When {{looking for}} a new telephone, Bean finds the ones on display don't have a <b>dialling</b> <b>tone,</b> and so thinks they don't work, and {{eventually}} takes one from a receptionist's desk when he finds it works, apparently unaware that it is not for sale. At the checkout, he sets his card on the counter, only for another customer to mistakenly take it, after accidentally covering up his own charge card of the same kind that the store clerk had returned. Bean, realising this, pickpockets the man and swaps the cards back but, when returning the customer's wallet to his back pocket, he manages to get his hand stuck and finds himself being unwittingly pulled all the way into the men's toilets. In the cubicle, Bean finds himself trapped, with the customer not knowing he is there until he helps him to find the roll of toilet paper, jumping up in fright upon doing so as Bean smiles nervously at the man.|$|E
50|$|A {{secondary}} <b>dial</b> <b>tone</b> is a <b>dial</b> tone-like sound {{presented to}} the caller after a call {{has been set up}} to prompt for additional digits to be <b>dialed.</b> Secondary <b>dial</b> <b>tones</b> are often used in call queuing and call forwarding systems.|$|R
50|$|A dry loop is an unconditioned leased pair of {{telephone}} {{line from a}} telephone company. The pair does not provide <b>dial</b> <b>tone</b> or battery (continuous electric potential), {{as opposed to a}} wet pair, a line usually without <b>dial</b> <b>tone</b> but with battery.|$|R
50|$|The class 5 {{office is}} the local {{exchange}} or end office. It delivers <b>dial</b> <b>tone</b> to the customer. The end office, also called a branch exchange, is the closest connection to the end customer. Over 19,000 end offices in the United States alone provide basic <b>dial</b> <b>tone</b> services.|$|R
50|$|Subscriber {{information}} was programmed into the exchange in racks called cyclic stores which used PTFE wire threaded through magnetic cores known as 'Dimond ring' (see TXE2 section for more information). The information stored was the Class of Service (COS) i.e. PBX, CCB (payphone) or single line, {{followed by the}} directory number. The subscribers derived an equipment number from the position on the cyclic store rack. This was a six-digit number and {{referred to as the}} MUCKBL, which describes to the exchange where this is. In some parts of the exchange equipment was in the format of BUMCLK and this was used by engineers as a pseudo swear word. When a subscriber lifted their handset it sent a pulse down this wire, which was picked up by a 156 ms scanner, which initiated a path to be set up through the reed relays so the subscriber could be connected to a Register. This Register then returned <b>dialling</b> <b>tone</b> to the subscriber and dialling could commence.|$|E
5000|$|In 2001 BT Group {{launched}} its Answer 1571 {{service as a}} free service, available {{at no extra cost}} to its existing telephone line customers. In 2007 a charge of £1 was introduced for any month in which two chargeable calls are not made on the line (this might apply, for instance, to people who have Carrier preselect with another telephone company). [...] In 2014 a monthly charge (£2.25 [...] ) was introduced for all residential users of the service, and the charge for not making two chargeable calls in any month (which had increased to £2) was removed. The Answer 1571 service, a cut-down version of BT Group's Call Minder service, allows a calling party to leave messages when the called party is engaged or does not answer within a fixed number of rings. The system allows for the storage of up to 20 messages, each of which can be up to 2 minutes long, for up to 60 days (or 20 days once they have been heard). To indicate to called parties that they have waiting messages, the exchange sends an interrupted <b>dialling</b> <b>tone</b> to them when they take their telephone off-hook. The called party can retrieve the messages by dialling 1571.|$|E
40|$|A low {{computational}} {{complexity and}} low cost recursive discrete Fourier transform (RDFT) design for DTMF application is proposed in this paper. The DFT {{is also used}} to efficiently solve partial differential equations, and to perform other operations such as convolution or multiplying large integers. There are lots of architectures available in literature which is of computing N point DFT type. Such algorithms are called as FFT computation algorithms. However in some applications we need to computer the DFT for some of selected output bin indices only. One of such example is signal monitoring and spectrum estimation technique in signal intelligence applications. The Dual-tone multi-frequency (DTMF) is also another example where we are specifically interested to see the energies at specific frequency values only. DTMF detection is used to detect DTMF signals in the presence of speech and <b>dialling</b> <b>tone</b> pulses. A low power recursive discrete Fourier transform (RDFT) design is proposed in this project. The proposed algorithm reduces the hardware complexity which in turn reduces the memory. By this a considerable power saving is achieved. The recursive DFT is realized for DTMF detection applications. The architecture will be developed keeping DTMF requirements in consideration. The proposed algorithm will be implemented through VHDL. Modelsim (SE) will be used simulation. After verifying the simulation results the code will be synthesized on Xilinx FPGA...|$|E

50|$|Notice, {{that when}} using older non-digital {{extensions}} for the inter-city, international calls {{as well as}} the calls made to the national mobile and sip-numbers, {{it may be necessary to}} wait for a continuous <b>dial</b> <b>tone</b> after the first 0. This applies to the old-style rotary phones (as opposed to modern digital dial phones). For example, to call a Chernihiv local landline number from Kiev, one needs to dial 0, wait for a <b>dial</b> <b>tone</b> and then <b>dial</b> 46 (Chernivtsi regional code) and then dial the local number in that city.
