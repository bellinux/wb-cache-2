5|$|Most {{octopuses}} swim by expelling a jet {{of water}} from the mantle through the siphon into the sea. The physical principle behind this is that the force required to accelerate the water through the orifice produces a reaction that propels the octopus in the opposite direction. The direction of travel depends on the orientation of the siphon. When swimming, the head is at the front and the siphon is pointed backwards, but when <b>jetting,</b> the visceral hump leads, the siphon points towards the head and the arms trail behind, with the animal presenting a fusiform appearance. In an alternative method of swimming, some species flatten themselves dorso-ventrally, and swim with the arms held out sideways, and this may provide lift and be faster than normal swimming. <b>Jetting</b> is used to escape from danger, but is physiologically inefficient, requiring a mantle pressure so high as to stop the heart from beating, resulting in a progressive oxygen deficit.|$|E

40|$|Astrophysical <b>jets</b> reveal strong {{signs of}} radial structure. They {{suggest that the}} inner region of the <b>jet,</b> the <b>jet</b> spine, {{consists}} of a low-density, fast-moving gas, while the outer region of the <b>jet</b> consists of a more dense and slower moving gas, called the <b>jet</b> sheath. Moreover, if <b>jets</b> carry angular momentum, the resultant centrifugal forces lead to a radial stratification. Current observations {{are not able to}} fully resolve the radial structure, so little is known about its actual profile. We present three active galactic nuclei <b>jet</b> models in 2. 5 D of which two have been given a radial structure. The first model is a homogeneous <b>jet,</b> the only model that does not carry angular momentum; the second model is a spine-sheath <b>jet</b> with an isothermal equation of state; and the third <b>jet</b> model is a (piecewise) isochoric spine-sheath <b>jet,</b> with constant but different densities for <b>jet</b> spine and <b>jet</b> sheath. In this paper, we look at the effects of radial stratification on <b>jet</b> integrity, mixing between the different <b>jet</b> components and global morphology of the jet-head and surrounding cocoon. We consider steady <b>jets</b> that have been active for 23 [*]Myr. All <b>jets</b> have developed the same number of strong internal shocks along their <b>jet</b> axis at the final time of simulation. These shocks arise when vortices are being shed by the jet-head. We find that all three <b>jets</b> maintain their stability {{all the way up to}} the jet-head. The isothermal <b>jet</b> maintains part of its structural integrity at the jet-head where the distinction between <b>jet</b> spine and <b>jet</b> sheath material can still be made. In this case, mixing between <b>jet</b> spine and <b>jet</b> sheath within the <b>jet</b> is fairly inefficient. The isochoric <b>jet,</b> on the other hand, loses its structural <b>jet</b> integrity fairly quickly after the <b>jet</b> is injected. At its jet-head, little structure is maintained and the central part of the <b>jet</b> predominantly consists of <b>jet</b> sheath material. In this case, <b>jet</b> spine and <b>jet</b> sheath material mix efficiently within the <b>jet.</b> We find that the propagation speed for all three models is less than expected from simple theoretical predictions. We propose this is due to an enlarged cross-section of the <b>jet</b> which impacts with the ambient medium. We show that in these models, the effective surface area is 16 times as large in the case of the homogeneous <b>jet,</b> 30 times as large in the case of the isochoric <b>jet</b> and can be up to 40 times as large in the case of the isothermal <b>jet...</b>|$|R

25|$|Insecticides {{have also}} been used often in prevention, but with {{improper}} application and heavy reliance throughout the years, insecticide resistance and residues within the wool have caused much concern. The primary reason for failures in using insecticides is attributed to poor application. <b>Jetting,</b> dipping, and backlining are the three most commonly used methods for insecticide application, {{and most of the}} chemicals used belong to three types of chemicals: synthetic pyrethroids, organophosphates, insect growth regulators and spinosins. Insect growth regulators can provide the long term protection against flies and when applied correctly provide protection during the susceptible times of the year. Resistance to this group of insecticide has been identified. Spinosins are good for short term control of flies and leave no residues in wool. Many government agencies mandate that the wool be free of insecticidal residues forcing withholding periods by farmers before shearing. During this time, the flock can become extremely sensitive to flystrike.|$|E
25|$|Although it {{is widely}} {{accepted}} that the formation of and widespread distribution of tektites requires the intense (superheated) melting of near-surface sediments and rocks at the impact site and the following high-velocity ejection of this material from the impact crater, the exact processes involved remain poorly understood. One possible mechanism {{for the formation of}} tektites is by the <b>jetting</b> of highly shocked and superheated melt during the initial contact/compression stage of impact crater formation. Alternatively, various mechanisms involving the dispersal of shock-melted material by an expanding vapor plume, which is created by a hypervelocity impact, have been used to explain the formation of tektites. Any mechanism by which tektites are created must explain chemical data that suggest that parent material from which tektites were created came from near-surface rocks and sediments at an impact site. In addition, the scarcity of known strewn fields relative to the number of identified Impact craters indicate that very special and rarely met circumstances are required in order for tektites to be created by a meteorite impact.|$|E
