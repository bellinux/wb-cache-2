25|$|There are 33 {{species of}} fish in the waters, none of which are {{abundant}} or commercially exploitable. The most common are polar cod, which reach lengths of , and liparidae. There are no endemic species within the archipelago. Forty-one species of birds have been documented in the archipelago, of which fourteen breed. These are dominated by seabirds such as fulmar, kittiwake, Brünnich's guillemot, black guillemot and little auk are common throughout the archipelago, while seven other species prefer nesting on flat tundra: common eider, purple sandpiper, Arctic skua, glaucous gull, <b>ivory</b> <b>gull,</b> Arctic tern and snow bunting. Some ivory gulls, little auks and Brünnich's guillemots opt to spend the winter on the islands.|$|E
25|$|The general {{pattern of}} plumage in adult gulls {{is a white}} body with a darker mantle; {{the extent to which}} the mantle is darker varies from pale grey to black. A few species vary in this, the <b>ivory</b> <b>gull</b> is entirely white, and some like the lava gull and Heermann's gull have partly or entirely grey bodies. The wingtips of most species are black, which {{improves}} their resistance to wear and tear, usually with a diagnostic pattern of white markings. The head of a gull may be covered by a dark hood or be entirely white. The plumage of the head varies by breeding season; in nonbreeding dark-hooded gulls, the hood is lost, sometimes leaving a single spot behind the eye, and in white-headed gulls, nonbreeding heads may have streaking.|$|E

5000|$|The <b>ivory</b> <b>gull</b> was {{initially}} described by Constantine Phipps, 2nd Baron Mulgrave in 1774 as Larus eburneus from a specimen collected on Spitsbergen. Johann Jakob Kaup later recognized the unique traits of the <b>ivory</b> <b>gull</b> {{and gave it}} a monotypic genus, Pagophila, in 1829. Johan Ernst Gunnerus later gave the species a new specific name, Pagophila alba. The genus name Pagophila is from Ancient Greek pagos, [...] "sea-ice", and philos, [...] "-loving", and specific eburnea is Latin for [...] "ivory-coloured", from ebur, [...] "ivory". Today some authors consider the <b>ivory</b> <b>gull</b> not deserving of its monotypic genus, instead choosing to merge it, along with the other monotypic gulls, back into Larus. However, most authors have not chosen to do so. The <b>ivory</b> <b>gull</b> has no subspecies. No fossil members of this genus are known.|$|E

5000|$|This gull has {{traditionally}} been believed to be most closely related to either the kittiwakes, Sabine's gull, or Ross's gull. It differs anatomically from the other genera by having a relatively short tarsometatarsus, a narrower os pubis, and potentially more flexibility in skull kinetic structure. Structurally, it is most similar to the kittiwakes; however, recent genetic analysis based on mtDNA sequences shows that Sabine's <b>gull</b> is the <b>ivory</b> <b>gull's</b> closest relative, followed by the kittiwakes, with Ross's gull and swallow-tailed gull sharing a clade with these species. [...] "Pagophila" [...] is maintained as a unique genus because of the bird’s morphological, behavioral and ecological differences from these species.|$|R
50|$|Kongsfjorden Bird Sanctuary (Kongsfjorden fuglereservat) is a 140 ha bird reserve at Svalbard, Norway, {{established}} in 1973. It includes islands and islets in Kongsfjorden, Haakon VII Land. It {{lies at the}} inner end of the fjord and consists of about ten islands, mainly covered with grassy vegetation and having small freshwater ponds. The fjord is surrounded by steep mountains, cliffs, glaciers and tundra. The reserve has been recognised as a {{wetland of international importance}} by designation under the Ramsar Convention. It has also been identified as an Important Bird Area (IBA) by BirdLife International. It supports breeding populations of pink-footed and barnacle geese, common and king eiders, long-tailed ducks, purple sandpipers, red phalaropes, glaucous gulls, long-tailed jaegers and snow buntings. <b>Ivory</b> <b>gulls</b> have been recorded.|$|R
2500|$|The next {{expedition}} {{to land on}} the islands was that of Benjamin Leigh Smith in 1880. The Briton captained the 250-tonne barque Eira, which left Lerwick on 22June 1880 with an undetermined destination. After a stop by Jan Mayen Island, heavy ice off Spitsbergen forced them to choose a southern route, which sent the ship towards Franz Josef Land. The Eira landed [...] west of Wilczek Island on 14August, such that all land subsequently spotted was newly discovered. Within days they had caught walrus, <b>ivory</b> <b>gulls</b> and polar bears. On 18August the expedition discovered a natural harbor on Bell Island, which they named Eira Harbour and used as a base of operations. They then conducted a series of scientific experiments, explored the area and went hunting. The expedition next headed towards McClintock Island and Wilczek Island, but found their route blocked by ice. At the end of August they therefore returned to Svalbard, reaching Peterhead on 12October.|$|R

50|$|During the winter, <b>ivory</b> <b>gulls</b> {{live near}} polynyas, {{or a large}} area of open water {{surrounded}} by sea ice. North American birds, along with some from Greenland and Europe, winter along the 2000 km of ice edge stretching between 50° and 64° N from the Labrador Sea to Davis Strait that is bordered by Labrador and southwestern Greenland. Wintering gulls are often seen on the eastern coasts of Newfoundland and Labrador and occasionally appear {{on the north shore}} of the Gulf of St. Lawrence and the interior of Labrador. It also winters from October through June in the Bering Sea and Chukchi Seas. It is most widespread throughout the polynyas and pack ice of the Bering Sea. It is also vagrant throughout coastal Canada and the northeastern United States, though records of individuals as far south as California and Georgia have been reported, as well as The British Isles, with most records from late November through early March. Juveniles tend to wander further from the Arctic than adults.|$|R
30|$|Again, no {{comparative}} {{data are available}} for the North Sea, but several studies have analyzed PBDEs at different locations in the North Atlantic. For herring gull eggs from North Norway, Helgason and et al. [94] report rather high BDE- 47 concentrations of 350 to 497 ng/g lw in 1983, 1993, and 2003 and considerably lower levels of other congeners. Between 1983 and 1993, levels increased while they decreased or stabilized thereafter. Lower BDE- 47 levels were detected in eggs of <b>ivory</b> <b>gulls</b> from four locations in the Russian and Norwegian Arctic (i.e., 25 and 208 ng/g lw in 2006 / 2007 [71]. Total PBDE concentrations (median of the sum of congeners - 28, - 47, - 99, - 100, - 153, - 154, - 209) at these sites amounted to 51 to 302 ng/g lw. For guillemot from different North Atlantic locations (Iceland, Faroe Islands, and three Norwegian sites) [65] and fulmars from Faroe Islands [61], mean egg concentrations of 5.9 to 38 ng BDE- 47 /g lw are reported for years 2000 to 2003 with highest levels in Iceland. Similar BDE- 47 concentrations are reported for eggs of the common eider from three differently exposed locations in Norway (2 to 20 ng/g lw) and eggs of European shags from one of these sites (24 and 27 ng/g lw) in 2003 and 2004 [67]. For comparison, between years 2000 and 2007, BDE- 47 levels in herring gull eggs from our North Sea locations ranged between 43 and 275 ng/g lw.|$|R
40|$|AbstractThis review {{summarizes}} {{our current}} state of knowledge regarding the potential biological effects of mercury (Hg) exposure on fish and wildlife in the Canadian Arctic. Although Hg in most freshwater fish from northern Canada was not sufficiently elevated to be of concern, a few lakes in the Northwest Territories and Nunavut contained fish of certain species (e. g. northern pike, Arctic char) whose muscle Hg concentrations exceeded an estimated threshold range (0. 5 – 1. 0 μgg- 1 wet weight) within which adverse biological effects begin to occur. Marine fish species generally had substantially lower Hg concentrations than freshwater fish; but the Greenland shark, a long-lived predatory species, had mean muscle Hg concentrations exceeding the threshold range for possible effects on health or reproduction. An examination of recent egg Hg concentrations for marine birds from the Canadian Arctic indicated that mean Hg concentration in <b>ivory</b> <b>gulls</b> from Seymour Island fell within the threshold range associated with adverse effects on reproduction in birds. Mercury concentrations in brain tissue of beluga whales and polar bears were generally lower than levels associated with neurotoxicity in mammals, but were sometimes high enough to cause subtle neurochemical changes that can precede overt neurotoxicity. Harbour seals from western Hudson Bay had elevated mean liver Hg concentrations along with comparatively high muscle Hg concentrations indicating potential health effects from methylmercury (MeHg) exposure on this subpopulation. Because current information is generally insufficient to determine with confidence whether Hg exposure is impacting the health of specific fish or wildlife populations in the Canadian Arctic, biological effects studies should comprise {{a major focus of}} future Hg research in the Canadian Arctic. Additionally, studies on cellular interactions between Hg and selenium (Se) are required to better account for potential protective effects of Se on Hg toxicity, especially in large predatory Arctic fish, birds, and mammals...|$|R
50|$|The {{beach is}} home to many forms of marine life, such as abalone, anemones, crabs, kelp, and sea urchins. Several types of birds also live at the beach, such as the brown pelican, great blue heron, <b>ivory</b> <b>gull,</b> and other species.|$|E
50|$|Birds include brant goose, snowy owl, {{parasitic}} jaeger, long-tailed jaeger, pomarine jaeger, {{and common}} raven. Thayer's gull and glaucous gull {{are to be}} found here also, but the island is most notable for <b>ivory</b> <b>gull,</b> found on Seymour Island from May to September. The gulls of Seymour Island breed on raised beaches unlike other Canadian <b>ivory</b> <b>gull</b> colonies. The island supports Canada’s largest known ivory gulls breeding colony, approximately 10-12 percent of the known Canadian population. In 2005, Gilchrist and Mallory postulated that Seymour Island gulls may represent forty percent of the surviving Canadian population of this species. The Seymour Island population represents approximately one percent of the world population of ivory gulls.|$|E

30|$|Regarding total PCB concentrations, Bustnes et al. [70] report mean levels (sum of 26 congeners) of 1, 240 ng/g ww (≈ 12, 580 ng/g lw {{calculated}} with reported lipid {{concentrations of}} 9.85 %) in eggs of the {{lesser black-backed gull}} (Larus fuscus intermediatus) collected at the southern Norwegian coast (North Sea) in 2002. In lesser black-backed gulls from Iceland, total PCBs (sum of 12 congeners) amounted to 6, 000 ng/g lw in 2003 [69]. High median concentrations are reported for eggs of <b>ivory</b> <b>gulls</b> (Pagophila eburnea) from the Russian and Norwegian Arctic regions (sum of 28 congeners 16, 000 to 45, 500 ng/g lw) in 2006 [71] and for eggs of the peregrine falcon (Falco peregrinus tundris) from South Greenland (sum of 22 congeners 55 μg/g lw = 55, 000 ng/g), sampled between 1986 and 2003 [72]. Both species are top predators and thus strongly exposed to biomagnifying substances like PCBs. Shag eggs from three differently exposed islands of central Norway had total PCB levels (sum of 12 congeners) of 4, 590 to 4, 690 ng/g lw in 2003 and 2004, whereas significantly lower levels of 109 to 880 ng/g lw were detected in eggs of the common eider from the same sites [67]. These findings were ascribed to differences in feeding habits and ecology. In eggs of the Eurasian oystercatcher (Haematopus ostralegus) and common tern (Sterna hirundo) from Trischen, total PCB concentrations (sum of 32 congeners) declined between 1987 and 2008 from ≈ 5, 500 to < 1, 000 ng/g ww (common tern) and from ≈ 2, 500 to < 500 ng/g ww (oystercatcher) [73] (values derived from figures). Specifically, the data for oystercatcher eggs are in good agreement with our findings from Trischen. For the Baltic Sea, similar concentrations were reported in eggs of the little tern (Sterna albifrons) from {{the east coast of}} Schleswig-Holstein: Between 1978 and 1996, total PCBs (62 congeners) decreased from ≈ 3, 000 to 600 ng/g ww [74]. Our time series at Heuwiese started later. Nevertheless, in 1996, we observed comparable ∑PCB levels in herring gull eggs, i.e., 820 ng/g ww. In 2008, levels had decreased to 460 ng/g ww which is in good agreement with the data reported for herring gull eggs from the Swedish west coast in the same year (sum of 13 congeners 107 to 355 ng/g ww; [75]).|$|R
