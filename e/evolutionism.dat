Edward Drinker Cope and Alpheus Hyatt reconciled this view with <b>evolutionism</b> in a form of neo-Lamarckism involving recapitulation theory.|$|E

Some of his views and theories made him a precursor of <b>evolutionism</b> in the natural and social sciences. In his essays on human nature, he declared for the primacy of science and was relatively critical {{of the influence of}} religion. These views gained him some critics, as he was seen as a priest who had abandoned religion.|$|E
5|$|The book aroused {{international}} interest and a widespread debate, with no sharp line between scientific issues and ideological, social and religious implications. Much {{of the initial}} reaction was hostile, in a large part because very few reviewers actually understood his theory, but Darwin {{had to be taken}} seriously as a prominent and respected name in science. There was much less controversy than had greeted the 1844 publication Vestiges of Creation, which had been rejected by scientists, but had influenced a wide public readership into believing that nature and human society were governed by natural laws. The Origin of Species as a book of wide general interest became associated with ideas of social reform. Its proponents made full use of a surge in the publication of review journals, and it was given more popular attention than almost any other scientific work, though it failed to match the continuing sales of Vestiges. Darwin's book legitimised scientific discussion of evolutionary mechanisms, and the newly coined term Darwinism was used to cover the whole range of <b>evolutionism,</b> not just his own ideas. By the mid-1870s, <b>evolutionism</b> was triumphant.|$|E

25|$|Theistic evolution, theistic <b>evolutionism,</b> or {{evolutionary}} creationism are {{views that}} regard religious teachings about God as compatible with modern scientific understanding about biological evolution. Theistic evolution {{is not in}} itself a scientific theory, but a range of views about how the science of general evolution relates to religious beliefs in contrast to special creation views.|$|E
25|$|The {{reception}} of Darwin's ideas continued to arouse scientific and religious debates, and wide public interest. Satirical cartoonists seized on animal ancestry {{in relation to}} other topical issues, drawing on a long tradition of identifying animal traits in humans. In Britain mass circulation magazines were droll rather than cruel, and thus presented Darwin's theory in an unthreatening way. Due to illness, Darwin began growing a beard in 1862, and when he reappeared in public in 1866 with a bushy beard, caricatures centred on Darwin and his new look contributed to a trend in which all forms of <b>evolutionism</b> were identified with Darwinism.|$|E
25|$|Since the {{publication}} of Charles Darwin's On the Origin of Species in 1859, {{the attitude of the}} Catholic Church on the theory of evolution has slowly been refined. Early contributions to the development of evolutionary theory were made by Catholic scientists such as Jean-Baptiste Lamarck and the Augustinian monk Gregor Mendel. For nearly a century, the papacy offered no authoritative pronouncement on Darwin's theories. In the 1950 encyclical Humani generis, Pope Pius XII confirmed that there is no intrinsic conflict between Christianity and the theory of evolution, provided that Christians believe that the individual soul is a direct creation by God and not the product of purely material forces. , the Church supports theistic <b>evolution(ism),</b> also known as evolutionary creation, although Catholics are free not to believe in any part of evolutionary theory.|$|E
25|$|The X Club came {{together}} {{during a period}} of turbulent conflict in both science and religion in Victorian England. The publication in 1859 of Charles Darwin's book On the Origin of Species through Natural Selection brought a storm of argument, with the scientific establishment of wealthy amateurs and clerical naturalists as well as the Church of England attacking this new development. Since the start of the 19th century they had seen <b>evolutionism</b> as an assault on the divinely ordained aristocratic social order. On the other side, Darwin's ideas on evolution were welcomed by liberal theologians and by a new generation of salaried professional scientists; the men who would later come to form the X Club supported Darwin, and saw his work as a great stride in the struggle for freedom from clerical interference in science. The members of the X social network played a significant part in nominating Darwin for the Copley Medal in 1864.|$|E
25|$|Since around 1800, {{ideas of}} <b>evolutionism</b> had been denounced as {{examples}} of dangerous materialism, which undermined natural theology and the argument from design, threatening the current moral and social order. Such ideas were propagated by lower class Radicals seeking to overturn divine justification of the (aristocratic) social order. Chambers supported middle class political interests, and saw laws of progress in nature as implying inevitable political progress. He sought to sanitise the radical tradition by presenting progressive evolution as an unfolding of divinely planned laws of creation as development {{up to and including}} the appearance of human species. The political climate had eased as increasing prosperity reduced fears of revolution, and the book was widely considered to be merely scandalous and titillating. It was read not only by members of high society, but also — thanks to the rise of cheap publishing — the lower and middle classes, and continued to sell in large quantities {{for the rest of the}} 19th century.|$|E

The supposedly natural (biological) character of the systemic changes was stressed.

500|$|In {{the early}} 20th century the modern {{evolutionary}} synthesis integrated classical genetics with Darwin's {{theory of evolution}} by natural selection through the discipline of population genetics. The importance of natural selection {{as a cause of}} evolution was accepted into other branches of biology. Moreover, previously held notions about evolution, such as orthogenesis, <b>evolutionism,</b> and other beliefs about innate [...] "progress" [...] within the largest-scale trends in evolution, became obsolete. Scientists continue to study various aspects of evolutionary biology by forming and testing hypotheses, constructing mathematical models of theoretical biology and biological theories, using observational data, and performing experiments in both the field and the laboratory.|$|E
500|$|In his view, every {{historical}} {{relation between}} rulers and ruled contained such elements {{and they can}} be analysed {{on the basis of this}} tripartite distinction. He notes that the instability of charismatic authority forces it to [...] "routinise" [...] into a more structured form of authority. In a pure type of traditional rule, sufficient resistance to a ruler can lead to a [...] "traditional revolution". The move towards a rational-legal structure of authority, utilising a bureaucratic structure, is inevitable in the end. Thus this theory can be sometimes viewed as part of the social <b>evolutionism</b> theory. This ties to his broader concept of rationalisation by suggesting the inevitability of a move in this direction.|$|E
500|$|The Origin of Species was {{translated}} into many languages, becoming a staple scientific text attracting thoughtful attention {{from all walks of}} life, including the [...] "working men" [...] who flocked to Huxley's lectures. Darwin's theory also resonated with various movements at the time and became a key fixture of popular culture. Cartoonists parodied animal ancestry in an old tradition of showing humans with animal traits, and in Britain these droll images served to popularise Darwin's theory in an unthreatening way. While ill in 1862 Darwin began growing a beard, and when he reappeared in public in 1866 caricatures of him as an ape helped to identify all forms of <b>evolutionism</b> with Darwinism.|$|E
500|$|There was {{considerable}} controversy surrounding Darwin's prediction that a moth {{would be found}} in Madagascar with a long proboscis matching the nectary of Angraecum sesquipedale. An anonymous article in the Edinburgh Review of October 1862 by George Campbell, 8th Duke of Argyll, argued that Darwin's wording implied purpose, and concluded that [...] "We know, too, that these purposes and ideas are not our own, but the ideas and purposes of Another." [...] He considered Darwin's explanations the [...] "most unsatisfactory conjectures", and raised obscure metaphysical objections while supporting a kind of creative <b>evolutionism.</b> Emma Darwin thought that although Argyll was [...] "quite opposed" [...] to Darwin's views, [...] "he praises the Orchids in such an enthusiastic way that he will do it a good turn". Darwin was delighted to find that a well written article [...] "smashing" [...] Argyll's review was by one of Darwin's own nephews.|$|E
500|$|A radical British {{school of}} {{comparative}} anatomy {{that included the}} anatomist Robert Edmond Grant was closely in touch with Lamarck's French school of Transformationism. One of the French scientists who influenced Grant was the anatomist Étienne Geoffroy Saint-Hilaire, whose ideas on the unity of various animal body plans and the homology of certain anatomical structures would be widely influential and lead to intense debate with his colleague Georges Cuvier. Grant became an authority on the anatomy and reproduction of marine invertebrates. He developed Lamarck's and Erasmus Darwin's ideas of transmutation and <b>evolutionism,</b> and investigated homology, even proposing that plants and animals had a common evolutionary starting point. As a young student, Charles Darwin joined Grant in investigations {{of the life cycle}} of marine animals. In 1826, an anonymous paper, probably written by Robert Jameson, praised Lamarck for explaining how higher animals had [...] "evolved" [...] from the simplest worms; this was the first use of the word [...] "evolved" [...] in a modern sense.|$|E
500|$|A broad {{historical}} {{paradigm in}} both sociology and anthropology, functionalism addresses the social structure, {{referred to as}} social organization in among the classical theorists, {{as a whole and}} in terms of the necessary function of its constituent elements. A common analogy (popularized by Herbert Spencer) is to regard norms and institutions as 'organs' that work towards the proper-functioning of the entire 'body' of society. The perspective was implicit in the original sociological positivism of Comte, but was theorized in full by Durkheim, again with respect to observable, structural laws. Functionalism also has an anthropological basis in the work of theorists such as Marcel Mauss, Bronisław Malinowski and Radcliffe-Brown. It is in Radcliffe-Brown's specific usage that the prefix 'structural' emerged. Classical functionalist theory is generally united by its tendency towards biological analogy and notions of social <b>evolutionism,</b> in that the basic form of society would increase in complexity and those forms of social organization that promoted solidarity would eventually overcome social disorganization. As Giddens states: [...] "Functionalist thought, from Comte onwards, has looked particularly towards biology as the science providing the closest and most compatible model for social science. Biology has been taken to provide a guide to conceptualizing the structure and the function of social systems and to analysing processes of evolution via mechanisms of adaptation ... functionalism strongly emphasizes the pre-eminence of the social world over its individual parts (i.e. its constituent actors, human subjects)." ...|$|E
500|$|In 1871, {{at the age}} of eight, Narendranath {{enrolled}} at Ishwar Chandra Vidyasagar's Metropolitan Institution, where he went to school until his family moved to Raipur in 1877. In 1879, after his family's return to Calcutta, he was the only student to receive first-division marks in the Presidency College entrance examination. [...] He was an avid reader {{in a wide range of}} subjects, including philosophy, religion, history, social science, art and literature. He was also interested in Hindu scriptures, including the Vedas, the Upanishads, the Bhagavad Gita, the Ramayana, the Mahabharata and the Puranas. Narendra was trained in Indian classical music, and regularly participated in physical exercise, sports and organised activities. Narendra studied Western logic, Western philosophy and European history at the General Assembly's Institution (now known as the Scottish Church College). In 1881 he passed the Fine Arts examination, and completed a Bachelor of Arts degree in 1884. Narendra studied the works of David Hume, Immanuel Kant, Johann Gottlieb Fichte, Baruch Spinoza, Georg W. F. Hegel, Arthur Schopenhauer, Auguste Comte, John Stuart Mill and Charles Darwin. He became fascinated with the <b>evolutionism</b> of Herbert Spencer and corresponded with him, translating Spencer's book Education (1861) into Bengali. While studying Western philosophers, he also learned Sanskrit scriptures and Bengali literature. William Hastie (principal of General Assembly's Institution) wrote, [...] "Narendra is really a genius. I have travelled far and wide but I have never come across a lad of his talents and possibilities, even in German universities, among philosophical students' Some accounts have called Narendra a shrutidhara (a person with a prodigious memory).|$|E

2500|$|Socio{{cultural}} evolution, sociocultural <b>evolutionism</b> {{or cultural}} evolution are theories {{of cultural and}} social evolution that describe how cultures and societies change over time. Whereas sociocultural development traces processes that tend to increase the complexity of a society or culture, sociocultural evolution also considers process {{that can lead to}} decreases in complexity (degeneration) or that can produce variation or proliferation without any seemingly significant changes in complexity (cladogenesis). Sociocultural evolution is [...] "the process by which structural reorganization is affected through time, eventually producing a form or structure which is qualitatively different from the ancestral form".|$|E

2500|$|Negulescu's {{publishing}} debut came in 1892, with {{a metaphysical}} essay, Critica apriorismului și a empirismului ("A Critique of Apriorism and Empiricism"), earning him the Romanian Academy award in philosophy. The title indicates {{the two main}} philosophical currents rejected by Negulescu, who sought a middle road between transcendental idealism and resurgent anti-realism, finalism, and theism. He found it in [...] "realistic empiricism", a brand of monism, <b>evolutionism</b> and scientism that quoted heavily from Herbert Spencer. His monistic outlook fell short of classical positivism and historical materialism, since it rehabilitated metaphysical inquiry as a legitimate pursuit. Various authors have regretfully noted that Negulescu never truly developed his tentative metaphysical system, which appeared to them inconclusive.|$|E
2500|$|One of the {{considerations}} {{detected in}} La Peyrère by Otto Zöckler was {{concern with the}} Antipodes and their people: were they pre-Adamites, or indeed had there been a second [...] "Adam of the Antipodes"? In a 19th-century sequel, Alfred Russel Wallace in an 1867 book review pointed to the Pacific Islanders as posing a problem for those holding both to monogenism and a recent date for human origins. In other words, he took migration from an original location to remote islands that are now populated to imply a long time scale.

2500|$|In the 1860s theistic <b>evolutionism</b> {{became a}} popular {{compromise}} in science, and gained widespread {{support from the}} general public. Between 1866 and 1868 Owen published a theory of derivation proposing that species had an innate tendency to change in ways that resulted in variety and beauty showing creative purpose. Both Owen and Mivart insisted that natural selection could not explain patterns and variation, which they saw as resulting from divine purpose. In 1867 the Duke of Argyll published The Reign of Law, which explained beauty in plumage without any adaptive benefit as design generated by the Creator's laws of nature for the delight of humans. Argyll attempted to reconcile evolution with design by suggesting that the laws of variation prepared [...] rudimentary organs for a future need.|$|E

2500|$|The {{implication}} in Justice Black's footnote that secular humanism is {{a religion}} has been seized upon by religious opponents of the teaching of evolution, {{who have made the}} argument that teaching evolution amounts to teaching a religious idea. The claim that secular humanism could be considered a religion for legal purposes was examined by the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit in Peloza v. Capistrano School District, 37 F.3d 517 (9th Cir. 1994), cert. denied, 515 U.S. 1173 (1995). In this case, a science teacher argued that, by requiring him to teach evolution, his school district was forcing him to teach the [...] "religion" [...] of secular humanism.

He believed that culture–meaning the total of all human cultural activity on the planet–was evolving. White differentiated three components of culture: technological, sociological, and ideological. He argued that it was the technological component which plays a primary role or is the primary determining factor responsible for the cultural evolution. His materialist approach is evident in the following quote: [...] "man as an animal species, and consequently culture as a whole, is dependent upon the material, mechanical means of adjustment to the natural environment". This technological component can be described as material, mechanical, physical, and chemical instruments, as well as the way people use these techniques.
