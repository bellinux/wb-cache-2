High Resolution Wide Swath SAR imaging is possible through the combination of Multi-aperture SAR systems and appropriate coherent processing of the <b>individual</b> <b>aperture</b> signals.

It employs dithered observations using 17 hexagonal bundles of 2 arcsec fibers to obtain resolved spectroscopy over a wide wavelength range of 3, 600 - 10, 300 A. To map the internal variations within each galaxy, we need to perform accurate spectral surface photometry, which is to calibrate the specific intensity at every spatial location sampled by each <b>individual</b> <b>aperture</b> element of the integral field unit.

We {{found that the}} transmissions of the waves at some frequencies are enhanced by up to ~ 100 % regardless of the area fraction of the aperture. The enhanced transmissions are attributed to two types of resonances {{that occur in the}} <b>individual</b> <b>aperture</b> and the periodic structure of the array. For aperture-related resonance, we showed its robustness to changes in the incidence angle and the localized distribution of the surface field by studying the microwave transmission of an array of fractal-shaped apertures. For structure-related resonance, the relevant characteristics, such as the angular dependence of the transmission and the modulation of the surface field in the region between the apertures, are opposite to those of aperture-related resonance, which are exhibited in the microwave transmission of an array of subwavelength holes. By investigating acoustic transmission through an array of small holes, we found that two types of resonances appear and dominate in different regions of a transmission spectrum. In fact, they are the limiting behaviors of a unified phenomenon. There is a smooth transition / link between the aperture-factor-induced and the structure-factor-induced transmissions in the acoustic case.

We show that inclusion of local chemical potential and driving velocity fields as a gauge field allows derivation of the hydrodynamic equations of motion for the driven macroscopic phase differences across simple aperture arrays. For a single aperture, the current-phase equation for driven flow contains sinusoidal, linear, and current-bias contributions. We compute the renormalization group (RG) beta function of the periodic potential in the effective action for small tunneling amplitudes and use this to analyze the temperature dependence of the low-energy current-phase relation, with application to the transition from linear to sinusoidal current-phase behavior observed in experiments by Hoskinson et al. packard for liquid ^ 4 He driven through nanoaperture arrays.

The total pattern of the contour trajectories across the <b>individual</b> <b>apertures</b> was manipulated to produce globally coherent motions, such as rotations, expansions, or translations. For displays containing only straight contours extending to the circumferences of the apertures, observers' reports of global motion direction were biased whenever the sampling of contour orientations was asymmetric relative to the direction of motion. Performance was improved by the presence of identifiable features, such as line ends or crossings, whose trajectories could be tracked over time. The reports of our observers were consistent with a pooling process involving a vector average of measures of the component of velocity normal to contour orientation, rather than with the predictions of the intersection-of-constraints analysis in velocity space.

Formation of these large baseline arrays could allow high resolution imaging of terrestrial or astronomical targets using techniques {{similar to those used}} for decades in radio interferometry. A key factor in the image quality is the relative positions of the <b>individual</b> <b>apertures</b> in the sparse array. The relative positions of satellites in a cluster are altered by “tidal ” accelerations which are a function of the cluster baseline and orbit altitude. These accelerations must be counteracted by continuous thrusting to maintain the relative positions of the satellites. Analysis of propulsive system requirements, limited by spacecraft power, volume, and mass constraints, indicates that specific impulses and efficiencies typical of ion engines or Hall thrusters (SPT’s) are necessary to maintain large cluster baselines. In addition, required thrust to spacecraft mass ratios for reasonable size clusters are approximately 15 µN/kg.

Fresnel interferometric arrays should be easier to build than equivalent resolution monolithic apertures or classical aperture synthesis arrays and allow larger fields and high dynamic range for astrophysical imaging. We present the concept and the first results of validation tests. Among high angular resolution imaging techniques, aperture synthesis provides the highest resolutions, but requires stringent path lengths control and optical surfaces quality. Beam recombining is also a challenge in the I. R, optical and shorter wavelength domains if the number of apertures exceeds a dozen. A large number of apertures is nonetheless necessary to allow imaging of complex objects, as a simple law binds the maximum number of independent pixels in a reconstructed image to the number of <b>individual</b> <b>apertures</b> in the interferometric array providing this image (Koechlin & Perez, 2002).

40|$|An {{array of}} small optical {{receivers}} is proposed {{as an alternative}} to a single large optical receiver for high-data-rate communications in NASA s Deep Space Network (DSN). Because the telescope for a single receiver capable of satisfying DSN requirements must be greater than 10 m in diameter, the design, building, and testing of the telescope would be very difficult and expensive. The proposed array would utilize commercially available telescopes of 1 -m or smaller diameter and, therefore, could be developed and verified with considerably less difficulty and expense. The essential difference between a single-aperture optical-communications receiver and an optical-array receiver is that a single-aperture receiver focuses all of the light energy it collects onto the surface of an optical detector, whereas an array receiver focuses portions of the total collected energy onto separate detectors, optically detects each fractional energy component, then combines the electrical signal from the array of detector outputs to form the observable, or "decision statistic," used to decode the transmitted data. A conceptual block diagram identifying the key components of the optical-array receiver suitable for deep-space telemetry reception is shown in the figure.

The Planet Formation Imager (PFI) is a project for a very large optical interferometer intended to obtain images of the planet formation process at scales as small as the Hill sphere of giant exoplanets. Its main science instruments will work in the thermal infrared {{but it will be}} cophased in the near infrared, where it requires also some capacity for scientific imaging. PFI imaging and resolution specifications imply an array of 12 to 20 apertures and baselines up to a few kilometers cophased at near infrared coherent magnitudes as large as 10.

From a global analysis of the possible combinations of pairwise fringe sensors, we show that conventional approaches used in current interferometers imply the use of prohibitively large telescopes and we indicate the innovative strategies that would allow building PFI with affordable apertures smaller than 2 m in diameter. The approach with the best potential appears to be Hierarchical Fringe Tracking based on "two beams spatial filters" that cophase pairs of neighboring telescopes with all the efficiency of a two telescopes fringe tracker and transmit most of the flux as if it was produced by an unique single mode aperture to cophase pairs of pairs and then pairs of groups of apertures.

40|$|In {{this series}} of two papers we {{describe}} a project with STIS on HST to measure the line-of-sight velocities of stars in the central few arcsec of the dense globular cluster M 15. This first paper focuses on the observations and reduction of the data. We `scanned' the central region of M 15 spectroscopically by consecutively placing an 0. 1 arcsec slit at 18 adjacent positions. Careful and complicated data reduction and analysis were required. The spectral pixel size exceeds the velocity dispersion of M 15, which puts the project at the limit of what is feasible with STIS. We applied corrections for the following effects: drifts in the STIS wavelength scale during an HST orbit; the orbital velocity component of HST along the line-of-sight to the cluster, and its variations during the HST orbit; and the apparent wavelength shift that is perceived for a star that is not centered in the slit. To make these corrections we present a detailed study of the HST/STIS point-spread function and line-spread function. We also present a catalog with positions and U, B and V magnitudes of 31, 983 stars in M 15, created from existing HST/WFPC 2 data. We extract 19, 200 one-dimensional spectra from the STIS data, each for a different position in M 15, and each with a velocity scale accurate to better than 2. 5 km/s. We develop an algorithm that co-adds the spectra for <b>individual</b> <b>apertures</b> {{and use it to}} extract spectra of individual stars with minimum blending and maximum S/N. In Paper II we use these spectra to extract the line-of-sight velocities of individual stars. The velocities constrain the central structure, dynamics and mass distribution of the cluster, and provide evidence for the existence of an intermediate-mass black hole {{in the center of the}} cluster.

40|$|The {{capacity}} of the multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) optical intensity channel is studied, under both average and peak intensity constraints. We focus on low SNR, which can be modeled as the scenario where both constraints proportionally vanish, or where the peak constraint is held constant while the average constraint vanishes. A capacity upper bound is derived, and is shown to be tight at low SNR under both scenarios. The capacity achieving input distribution at low SNR is {{shown to be a}} maximally-correlated vector-binary input distribution. Consequently, the low-SNR {{capacity of}} the channel is characterized. As a byproduct, it is shown that for a channel with peak intensity constraints only, or with peak intensity constraints and <b>individual</b> (per <b>aperture)</b> average intensity constraints, a simple scheme composed of coded on-off keying, spatial repetition, and maximum-ratio combining is optimal at low SNR...|$|R
