Further, B.pisciodorus has a fishy odor that <b>is</b> <b>apparent</b> in both fresh and dried specimens.|$|E

As a colleague of Watsuki, he worked primarily as a manga assistant, only focusing on his own projects during his days off. He was influenced by street art from hip-hop and rap culture, which <b>is</b> <b>apparent</b> in his manga artwork. For drawing, he used calligraphy inks and pen nibs. When illustrating, he used Copic brand color markers.|$|E

5|$|Léal Souvenir {{is one of}} the {{earliest}} surviving examples of secular portraiture in medieval European art and one of {{the earliest}} extant unidealised representations. This <b>is</b> <b>apparent</b> in its realism and acute observation of the details of the man's everyday appearance. Van Eyck worked in the early Renaissance tradition and pioneered the manipulation of oil paint. Oil allowed smooth translucent surfaces, could be applied across a range of thicknesses and was manipulable while wet, which allowed far more subtle detail than available to previous generations of painters.|$|E

At the time of the Spanish Conquest in the 16th century the area was still important for its cacao production.|$|E
5|$|The EC, {{is located}} in the parahippocampal gyrus, a {{cortical}} region adjacent to the hippocampus. This gyrus conceals the hippocampus. The parahippocampal gyrus also includes the perirhinal cortex which {{plays an important role in}} the visual recognition of complex objects. There is also substantial evidence that it makes a contribution to memory, which can be distinguished from the contribution of the hippocampus. It <b>is</b> <b>apparent</b> that complete amnesia occurs only when both the hippocampus and the parahippocampus are damaged.|$|E
5|$|The commonness and {{centrality}} {{of wine in}} daily life in biblical times <b>is</b> <b>apparent</b> from its many positive and negative metaphorical uses throughout the Bible. Positively, for example, wine {{is used as a}} symbol of abundance, and of physical blessing. Negatively, wine is personified as a mocker and beer a brawler, and drinking a cup of strong wine to the dregs and getting drunk are sometimes presented as a symbol of God's judgment and wrath.|$|E

Many children were also suffering from scurvy due to the poor diet. Monthly mortality figures were: July– 153; August– 216; September– 67; and October– 8. To these can be added five children who died in hospital in Zagreb, {{for a total of}} 449.|$|E
5|$|The work's moralising tone <b>is</b> <b>apparent</b> {{from some}} of its more overtly dark iconography, its choice of saints, and how the scales tilt far lower beneath {{the weight of the}} damned than the saved. The damned to Christ's left are more {{numerous}} and less detailed than the saved to his right. In these ways it can be compared to Matthias Grünewald's Isenheim Altarpiece, which served much the same purpose, having been commissioned for the Monastery of St. Anthony in Isenheim, which cared for the dying.|$|E

Through the introduction of the two ex-members of Vaakevandring, the style became more melodic and atmospheric.|$|E

5|$|A {{secondary}} theme which {{drives the}} contest for the champion's portion is the rivalry between the royal provinces of Connacht and Ulster, {{resolved in the}} contest of the two heroes Cet Mac Mágach and Conall Cernach. The presentation of this rivalry is coloured by the author's peculiar Leinster viewpoint. He turns both provinces to ridicule by the cunning of Mac Da Thó, King of Leinster; in particular, the author's political sympathies favour Connacht and remain hostile to Ulster to the end. To the heroes assembled, Mac Da Thó boasts that all the food provided for the feast is a mere trifle for the Leinstermen. It is tempting {{to conclude that the}} inspiration of the story is the claim of Leinster to supersede both Ulster and Connacht. However, it <b>is</b> <b>apparent</b> that {{by the time of the}} tale's composition, even the story-teller does not take the political issues very seriously, using the theme instead as a vehicle for a good story.|$|E
5|$|Although chest {{radiography}} {{is an important}} part of the diagnosis, it is often not sensitive enough to detect the condition early after the injury. In a third of cases, pulmonary contusion is not visible on the first chest radiograph performed. It takes an average of sixhours for the characteristic white regions to show up on a chest X-ray, and the contusion may not become apparent for 48hours. When a pulmonary contusion <b>is</b> <b>apparent</b> in an X-ray, it suggests that the trauma to the chest was severe and that a CT scan might reveal other injuries that were missed with X-ray.|$|E
5|$|Although {{freshwater}} invertebrates inhabiting and comprising {{algae and}} periphyton make {{the foundation of}} food webs {{in the middle and}} lower basin, zooplankton and phytoplankton take that role in the estuarine habitat. Mollusks gather at the St. Johns estuary in large numbers, feeding {{on the bottom of the}} river and ocean floors. The abundance and importance of oysters (Crassostrea virginica) <b>is</b> <b>apparent</b> in the many middens left by the Timucua in mounds many feet high. Oysters and other mollusks serve as the primary food source of shorebirds. The large trees that line the river from its source to south of Jacksonville begin to transition into salt marshes east of the city. Mayport is home to approximately 20 shrimping vessels that use the mouth of the St. Johns to access the Atlantic Ocean.|$|E
