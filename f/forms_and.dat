5|$|A study {{conducted}} in 1999 for the City of Portland by researchers from Portland State University found that Johnson Creek had marginal conditions for macroinvertebrates, {{an important source}} of food for fish and other aquatic life. The study compared differences in these life <b>forms</b> <b>and</b> in water chemistry from two urban streams, Johnson Creek and Tryon Creek in southwest Portland, with two nearby rural streams and found that benthic communities in the urban streams were degraded compared to the regional reference creeks.|$|E
5|$|Acer pseudoplatanus {{was first}} {{described}} by the Swedish naturalist Carl Linnaeus in his Species Plantarum in 1753. It is the type species in the maple genus Acer. Many <b>forms</b> <b>and</b> varieties have been proposed, including natural varieties such as var. macrocarpum Spach, var. microcarpum Spach, and var. tomentosum Tausch, and forms such as f. erythrocarpum (Carrière) Pax, f. purpureum (Loudon) Rehder, and f. variegatum (Weston) Rehder. These are all now considered to be synonyms of Acer pseudoplatanus L.|$|E
5|$|After Hardorff's death, {{the main}} proponent of Classicism was Christian Frederik Hansen who {{developed}} a more severe style with clean, simple <b>forms</b> <b>and</b> large, unbroken surfaces. From 1800, {{he was in}} charge of all major building projects in Copenhagen where he designed the Copenhagen City Hall & Courthouse (1805–15) on Nytorv. He was also responsible for rebuilding Church of Our Lady (Vor Frue Kirke) and designing the surrounding square (1811–29).|$|E

5|$|Beer {{contains}} the phenolic acids 4-hydroxyphenylacetic acid, vanillic acid, caffeic acid, syringic acid, p-coumaric acid, ferulic acid and sinapic acid. Alkaline hydrolysis experiments {{show that most}} of the phenolic acids are present as bound <b>forms</b> <b>and</b> only a small portion can be detected as free compounds. Hops, and beer made with it, contain 8-prenylnaringenin which is a potent phytoestrogen. Hop also contains myrcene, humulene, xanthohumol, isoxanthohumol, myrcenol, linalool, tannins and resin. The alcohol 2M2B is a component of hops brewing.|$|E

40|$|Process <b>and</b> <b>form</b> {{have always}} been {{important}} to my work. I emphasize the soft qualities of clay while working with traditional forms that are altered for visual interest. Usability is very important, the forms have to function well according to their intended use. The relationship between <b>form</b> <b>and</b> manipulation relied on usability of the form. Functionality was paramount within this body of work. I consciously searched for balance between <b>form</b> <b>and</b> manipulation, <b>form</b> <b>and</b> glaze, <b>form</b> <b>and</b> function, and overall character. Though altered, the <b>forms</b> were traditional <b>and</b> dependent on function. Manipulations of the <b>forms,</b> surface treatment, <b>and</b> deep colorful glazes contributed to creating harmony between function and expression. Personal stylistic elements became refined through working on this project. The body of work that was made allocated personal expression and new variations on functional forms. This project provided an opportunity for exploration <b>and</b> evaluation of <b>form</b> <b>and</b> my working process...|$|R

5|$|In the 1980s, Reynolds and Reynolds signed {{agreements}} {{with the rest of}} the Big Three automotive manufacturers, several major insurers, General Electric and others. In 1986 the company acquired National Medical Computer Services and a business forms company called Arnold Corporation. By the end of that year, Reynolds had more than $200 million in annual revenue, 42 percent of which came from business forms. Reynolds acquired several smaller technology companies in the 1990s and further developed its software products. Reynolds and Reynolds acquired PD Medical Systems in 1994, forming Reynolds Healthcare Systems. Reynolds Healthcare Systems in turn later acquired a business document company, Fiscal Information, which serves radiologists. From 1994 to 1996, David Holmes led the acquisition of several other business <b>forms</b> <b>and</b> computer businesses outside the automotive industry for a total of $155 million. By 2000, Reynolds and Reynolds had revenues of $800 million and more than one-third of its users were General Motors dealerships. It sold the Information Solutions Group (ISG), which primarily sold business <b>forms</b> <b>and</b> supplies to non-automotive companies, that year to the Carlyle Group for $360 million.|$|E
5|$|In the phlaeothripids {{that feed}} on fungi, males compete {{to protect and}} mate with females, and then defend the egg-mass. Males fight by {{flicking}} their rivals away with their abdomen, and may kill with their foretarsal teeth. Small males may sneak in to mate while the larger males are busy fighting. In the Merothripidae and in the Aeolothripidae, males are again polymorphic with large and small <b>forms,</b> <b>and</b> probably also compete for mates, so the strategy may well be ancestral among the Thysanoptera.|$|E

5|$|Keith Foulcher, an Australian {{professor}} of Indonesian literature and language, {{writes that the}} poems published in Poedjangga Baroe were structurally based in reimaginings of traditional forms {{with an emphasis on}} aesthetic diction; thematically, he writes, the poems tended to deal with either lofty goals or a deep sense of loneliness in the midst of natural beauty. According to literary documentarian H.B. Jassin, the poems, though they adapted Western <b>forms</b> <b>and</b> Indonesian diction, retained Malay rhythms.|$|E

5|$|Latin {{writers were}} {{immersed}} in the Greek literary tradition, and adapted its <b>forms</b> <b>and</b> much of its content, but Romans regarded satire as a genre in which they surpassed the Greeks. Horace wrote verse satires before fashioning himself as an Augustan court poet, and the early Principate also produced the satirists Persius and Juvenal. The poetry of Juvenal offers a lively curmudgeon's perspective on urban society.|$|E
