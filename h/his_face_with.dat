5|$|In late 1993, {{in order}} to make Todd look more menacing, he was given a scar to his right cheek by Marty's friend, Luna Moody, when she hit him in <b>his</b> <b>face</b> <b>with</b> a crowbar while {{preventing}} his attempt to rape Marty for a second time. The camera would often close in on and emphasize Todd's scar, which later became synonymous with the character.|$|E
5|$|Investigating one of {{a series}} of {{large-scale}} power outages, Indiana electrical lineman Roy Neary experiences a close encounter with a UFO, when it flies over his truck and lightly burns the side of <b>his</b> <b>face</b> <b>with</b> its bright lights. The UFO, joining a group of three other UFOs, is pursued by Neary and three police cars, but the spacecraft fly off into the night sky. Roy becomes fascinated by UFOs, much to the dismay of his wife, Ronnie. He also becomes increasingly obsessed with subliminal, mental images of a mountain-like shape and begins to make models of it. Jillian also becomes obsessed with sketching a unique-looking mountain. Soon after, she is terrorized in her home by a UFO which descends from the clouds. The presence of the UFO energy field makes every appliance in Jillian's house malfunction and Barry is abducted by unseen beings.|$|E
5|$|Though Tucker and Maria {{were warned}} against her having more {{children}} in her vulnerable physical and emotional state, she again conceived, and died in pregnancy in February 1823. In the carriage to Washington after the funeral, Tucker muffled <b>his</b> <b>face</b> <b>with</b> a handkerchief to hide his tears and feigned a toothache in response to inquirers. Maria's death indeed weighed heavily upon him, as he reflected on his plausible neglect {{in the midst of}} her travails. He also was much concerned for his son Daniel's indolence and unbalanced behavior which years later would result in the son's hospitalization and ultimate death in 1838 in Philadelphia.|$|E

25|$|The next night, Blagojevich lost to Patrick Porter by 3rd-round {{technical}} knockout. Porter's aggressive punching attack had Blagojevich {{covering up}} <b>his</b> <b>face</b> <b>with</b> his boxing gloves. Because Blagojevich {{did not return}} punches, the referee stopped the match (with Blagojevich still on his feet), and awarded it to Porter.|$|E
25|$|And Jesus Wept: Across {{the street}} from the 9:03 gate is a {{sculpture}} of Jesus weeping erected by St. Joseph's Catholic Church, one of the first brick-and-mortar churches built in the city. Jesus faces away from the devastation, covering <b>his</b> <b>face</b> <b>with</b> his hand. In front of Jesus is a wall with 168 gaps in it, representing the voids left by each life lost.|$|E
25|$|In , Cobra Commander's profile {{has been}} modified, stating that he {{considers}} himself a warrior king. This {{rendition of the}} character possesses snake-like eyes as well as full battle armor. He wears a helmet that resembles a snake's head and covers <b>his</b> <b>face</b> <b>with</b> a hood. The snake staff he carries contains a number of hidden weapons systems. In the Sigma 6 animated series, the Commander was voiced by Marc Thompson. At the series conclusion, most of Cobra has been captured but Cobra Commander and Firefly are still at large.|$|E

25|$|The {{victims of}} the first attack, Jimmy Hollis and Mary Jeanne Larey, were the only victims to give a {{description}} of their attacker. They described him as being six feet tall with a white mask over <b>his</b> <b>face</b> <b>with</b> holes cut out for his eyes and mouth. Although Hollis believed {{he was a young}} dark-tanned white man under 30 years old, Larey believed he was a light-skinned African-American. The only other surviving victim was Katie Starks, but she never saw her assailant. Since Hollis and Larey were the only survivors to give a description, it cannot be known if the killer wore a mask during the other attacks.|$|E
25|$|Before {{starting}} {{his professional life}} in entertainment, he explored {{a number of possible}} careers, such as medicine and professional boxing, before joining the entertainment world as a dancer. By 1930 he was involved in Mexico City's carpa (travelling tent) circuit, performing in succession with the Ofelia, Sotelo of Azcapotzalco, and finally the Valentina carpa, where he met his future wife. At first he tried to imitate Al Jolson by smearing <b>his</b> <b>face</b> <b>with</b> black paint, but later separated himself to form his own identity as an impoverished slum dweller with baggy pants, a rope for a belt, and a distinctive mustache. In the tents, he danced, performed acrobatics, and performed roles related to several different professions.|$|E
25|$|Witnesses saw Moseley {{enter his}} car, drive away and return ten minutes later. Shadowing <b>his</b> <b>face</b> <b>with</b> a wide-brimmed hat, he {{systematically}} searched the parking lot, {{the train station}} and an apartment complex, eventually finding Genovese, who was barely conscious and lying in a hallway {{at the back of}} the building, where a locked door had prevented her from going inside. Out of view of the street and of those who may have heard or seen any sign of the initial attack, Moseley stabbed Genovese several more times before raping her, stealing $49 from her and running away again. The attacks spanned approximately half an hour, and knife wounds in Genovese's hands suggested that she attempted to defend herself from him. A neighbor, Sophia Farrar, found her shortly after and held her in her arms.|$|E

25|$|Xu Shu {{was from}} Yingchuan Commandery (潁川郡), Yu Province, {{which is in}} present-day central Henan. His {{original}} family name was Shan (單) and his original given name was Fu (福). He was a swordsman in his early life and he once helped someone take revenge by killing another person. To avoid being recognised, he covered <b>his</b> <b>face</b> <b>with</b> white chalk and let his hair run wild. He was later arrested by an official, who asked him for his name, {{but he did not}} reply. The official tied him to a cart, paraded him through the streets, and asked for any person who could identify him. No one came forth. Xu Shu's fellows rescued him later. He was so grateful to be saved that he gave up his life as a swordsman and became a scholar.|$|E
25|$|A {{photograph}} of Zehaf-Bibeau {{was taken by}} a tourist at the war memorial during the shootings. It shows him holding the rifle and wearing a scarf over part of <b>his</b> <b>face,</b> <b>with</b> part of the War Memorial behind him. Ottawa police seized the camera and then took their own {{photograph of}} the image using a cellphone. French-Canadian journalist William Reymond received {{a copy of the}} photograph via the Internet, anonymously, apparently a copy of a tweet originating from the Ottawa Police of the cellphone picture. Reymond then took a picture of the image as it was displayed on his computer monitor and posted it to Twitter a few hours later after confirming the image. The image was re-tweeted by an ISIL sympathizer, leading to erroneous media reports that the image originated from an ISIL Twitter account.|$|E
25|$|While Khan {{was away}} from Mangalgarh, Mohammad Farooq Hakim, the Governor of Bhilsa, imprisoned his men and confiscated his {{personal}} property. When Khan returned and confronted him, {{he said that he}} believed that Khan had died in the battle with the Mughals. He released the imprisoned men, but returned only half of the Khan's belongings. The resulting hostility eventually led to a battle near Bhilsa. Farooq's army included 40,000 Maratha and Rajput soldiers, while Khan commanded just 5000 Afghans, supported by some Rajput soldiers. In a one-sided battle, Khan lost his brother Sher Mohammed Khan, and his men fled from the battlefield. Dost Mohammad Khan, with some of his most loyal men, had to hide in a thicket near the battlefield. As he lay hidden, he saw Farooq riding an elephant in the victory procession. He dressed himself in the uniform of one of Farooq's slain soldiers, hiding <b>his</b> <b>face</b> <b>with</b> a scarf and a helmet. Amid the din of the victory drums, he mounted the howdah (seat) on the elephant, killed Farooq and his guard, and claimed victory.|$|E

25|$|Psychosis {{originally}} {{lost his}} mask to Rey Misterio Sr. during {{a tour of}} Mexico, as he removed the mask {{and handed it to}} Mysterio Jr. while simultaneously covering <b>his</b> <b>face</b> <b>with</b> a towel. He also lost the mask to Billy Kidman on the September 27 episode of Nitro, revealing his face to the American audience. On occasion, he was also paired with Juventud Guerrera, and when the later won the IWGP Junior Heavyweight Title, Guerrera was kayfabe injured and had Psychosis defend the title. In reality, Guerrera and Jerry Flynn were arrested on DUI charges; Psychosis immediately lost the belt to previous champion Jushin Thunder Liger. Neither Juventud Guerrera's championship win nor Psicosis' title defense was recognized by New Japan Pro Wrestling until 2007. Psychosis had a second Cruiserweight title reign in WCW shortly after unmasking, when the previous champion Lenny Lane, who portrayed a flamboyant homosexual on television, got WCW in trouble with GLAAD. As a result, Lane was pulled from television and Psychosis was given the belt to defend. The WCW announcers claimed that he had won it at a house show. However, on his first televised appearance with the title, Psychosis lost it to Disco Inferno. This earned him the dubious distinction of having lost two titles he never won.|$|E
25|$|The {{first season}} of Stand Alone Complex {{focuses on the}} Laughing Man incident, wherein a hacker {{ultimately}} reveals to the Major that he had discovered that several micromachine manufacturing corporations, {{in association with the}} Japanese government, suppressed information on an inexpensive cure to a debilitating cyberization disease in order to profit from the more expensive micromachine treatment. He abducted one of the owners of the company and attempted to force him to reveal the truth on live television, resulting in the hacker live-hacking everyone's vision and cameras at the event to cover <b>his</b> <b>face</b> <b>with</b> the stylized laughing face logo that became synonymous with his image. His popularity spawned several genuine imitators, resulting in the series' titular Stand Alone Complex. When Section 9 discovers that these companies and several Japanese politicians later used the Laughing Man's image to garner public support and profit, they begin a campaign to disseminate the truth, ultimately leading to the Cabinet labeling them as domestic terrorists and forcibly disbanding them, resulting in the capture of several members and the apparent death of Motoko Kusanagi. However, it is all a ruse to deceive the government, and the very alive and well members of Section 9 regroup to bring the micromachine corporations and corrupt politicians to justice, resulting in the dissolution of the current Japanese government.|$|E
25|$|In {{the seventh}} and final book, Hermione accompanies Harry on his quest to destroy Voldemort's {{remaining}} Horcruxes. Before leaving on the quest, she helps {{ensure the safety of}} her parents by placing a false memory charm on them, making them think they are Wendell and Monica Wilkins, whose lifetime ambition is to move to Australia. She inherits Dumbledore's personal copy of The Tales of Beedle the Bard, which allows her to decipher some of the secrets of the Deathly Hallows. She prepared for their departure and journey by placing an Undetectable Extension Charm on a small beaded purse so she is able to fill the infinite depths of the bag with materials they will need. Hermione's spell saves her and Harry from Lord Voldemort and his snake Nagini in Godric's Hollow, although the ricochet snaps Harry's wand. When she, Ron, and Harry are captured by Snatchers, who are on the hunt for Muggle-borns under the Ministry's orders, Hermione disguises Harry by temporarily disfiguring <b>his</b> <b>face</b> <b>with</b> a Stinging Jinx. She also attempts to pass herself off as former Hogwarts student Penelope Clearwater and a half-blood to avoid persecution, but is later recognised and taken to Malfoy Manor where Bellatrix Lestrange tortures her with the Cruciatus Curse in an attempt to extract information on how Hermione, Harry, and Ron came to possess Godric Gryffindor's sword (which was supposed to be safe in the Lestrange vault at Gringotts). Even under torture, Hermione is able to use her quick thinking to lie to Bellatrix that the sword is a fake. When the others are able to escape their cell, Bellatrix threatens to slit Hermione's throat. Hermione, Harry, Ron and the other prisoners being held in Malfoy Manor are eventually rescued by Dobby.|$|E

500|$|Making {{his debut}} in Halo 2, Special Ops Commander Rtas 'Vadum is never {{named in the}} game itself, leading to the {{unofficial}} nickname of [...] "Half-Jaw" [...] by fans, due to the missing mandibles {{on the left side}} of <b>his</b> <b>face.</b> <b>With</b> the release of The Halo Graphic Novel, however, the character was finally named in the story Last Voyage of the Infinite Succor as Rtas 'Vadumee. The character is voiced by Robert Davi.|$|E
500|$|Ingrid Bergman as Ilsa Lund. Bergman's {{official}} website calls Ilsa her [...] "most famous and enduring role". The Swedish actress's Hollywood debut in Intermezzo had been well received, but her subsequent films were not major successes until Casablanca. Film critic Roger Ebert called her [...] "luminous", and {{commented on the}} chemistry between her and Bogart: [...] "she paints <b>his</b> <b>face</b> <b>with</b> her eyes". Other actresses considered {{for the role of}} Ilsa included Ann Sheridan, Hedy Lamarr, Luise Rainer and Michèle Morgan. Producer Hal Wallis obtained the services of Bergman, who was contracted to David O. Selznick, by lending Olivia de Havilland in exchange.|$|E
500|$|Spielberg {{drew the}} story of the film from his parents' divorce; Gary Arnold of The Washington Post called it [...] "essentially a spiritual autobiography, a {{portrait}} of the filmmaker as a typical suburban kid set apart by an uncommonly fervent, mystical imagination". References to his childhood occur throughout: Elliott fakes illness by holding a thermometer to the bulb in his lamp while covering <b>his</b> <b>face</b> <b>with</b> a heating pad, a trick frequently employed by the young Spielberg. Michael picking on Elliott echoes Spielberg's teasing of his younger sisters, and Michael's evolution from tormentor to protector reflects how Spielberg {{had to take care of}} his sisters after their father left.|$|E
