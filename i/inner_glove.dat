5000|$|Double gloving is the {{practice}} of wearing two layers of medical gloves to reduce the danger of infection from glove failure or penetration of the gloves by sharp objects during medical procedures. This should better protect the patient against infections transmitted by the surgeon. A systematic {{review of the literature}} has shown double gloving to offer significantly more protection against <b>inner</b> <b>glove</b> perforation in surgical procedures compared to the use of a single glove layer. But it was unclear if there was better protection against infections transmitted by the surgeon [...] Another systematic review studied if double gloving protected the surgeon better against infections transmitted by the patient. Pooled results of 12 studies (RCTs) with 3437 participants showed that double gloving reduced the number of perforations in inner gloves with 71% compared to single gloving. On average ten surgeons/nurses involved in 100 operations sustain 172 single gloves perforations but with double gloves only 50 inner gloves would be perforated.This is a considerable reduction of the risk.|$|E
50|$|Gloves should fit snugly but not be tight. One should {{consider}} {{the length of the}} fingers as the fingertips can become very cold if the glove's fingers are not long enough. Ideally the glove should be loose on the fingers and fit comfortably around the palm. A tight glove will tend to restrict blood flow and make the hand cold. In very cold weather it is often advisable to follow the skier's practice of thin <b>inner</b> <b>gloves</b> and outer padded waterproof mittens. Silk <b>inner</b> <b>gloves</b> are exceptionally warm and can usually be sourced from mountaineering and other outdoor sports shops.Most of professional cyclists use half finger cycling gloves.|$|R

40|$|This {{randomised}} trial compared single gloves with {{combinations of}} double gloves {{to determine the}} subjective effects on comfort, sensitivity and dexterity in 32 surgeons. Glove perforation rates were also compared. Single gloves of the surgeon's normal size (method A) were used as control. Double gloves were worn in three different ways, selected randomly: normal gloves inside and gloves one-half size larger outside (method B); the larger gloves inside and the normal gloves outside (method C); and lastly, two pairs of gloves of normal size (method D). Double gloves by all three methods significantly protected against needle perforation of the <b>inner</b> <b>gloves</b> when compared with single gloves, but also significantly impaired comfort, sensitivity and dexterity. When {{the three types of}} double gloving were compared, there appeared to be advantages for method C for all modalities, but the differences did not reach statistical significance; also, more surgeons expressed a preference for method C.

40|$|We {{have devised}} a novel method for {{evaluating}} the effectiveness of protective gloves and have undertaken a small study to assess this approach. Three types of glove were tested in a standardised simulation test with a permethrin-based pesticide. Prewashed cotton gloves were used to collect the samples. One was worn over the protective glove on one hand to measure the potential deposition of pesticide on the hands had the gloves not been worn. A second was placed under the protective glove on the opposite hand to measure the actual deposition of permethrin on the hands when the gloves were worn. This regime was reversed half way through each test {{in an attempt to}} prevent bias. Measurable <b>inner</b> <b>glove</b> contami-nation occurred on 25 out of 30 occasions. Geometric mean protection factors were calculated from the ratio of outer and inner sampling glove contamination, with average protection factors of 470, 200 and 96 being obtained for the two nitrile and PVC gloves, respectively. The PVC gloves were the least effective in preventing <b>inner</b> <b>glove</b> contamination, probably because the glove was thick and fairly inflexible, causing more pesticide to enter the glove around the cuff. Although the tasks were standardised, variability occurred due to worker behaviour and equipment failure. The spray pump failed on five occasions, resulting in higher levels of <b>inner</b> <b>glove</b> contamination and a geometric mean protection factor of 32.

40|$|The {{results of}} {{individual}} surveys are compared and general observations are {{made about the}} protective nature of protective gloves. A total of 190 measurements of contamination by involatile components of pesticide products were made inside the gloves. Protective gloves were nearly always found to be contaminated inside, except for public hygiene insecticide uses. Disposable gloves were sometimes used when applying public hygiene insecticides, while gloves worn for other applications were normally re-used. The data suggest that when expressing <b>inner</b> <b>glove</b> exposure as ‘amount of product per unit time’, the data distributions of the non-zero results appeared similar for all activities except {{for the application of}} antifoul-ings. A median value for all non-zero data was indicated at 1. 36 mg product per minute; a 75 th percentile at 4. 21 mg min 21 and a 95 th percentile at 71. 9 mg min 21, assuming product densities of 1. 0 g ml 21. In default of better information, these indicators can be used in health-based risk assessment. A further 47 data related to exposure inside new gloves, and 21 data to deposition on outer gloves. These indicate that in general, gloves provide a reasonable degree of protection to non-agricultural pesticides. Due regard should be paid to ‘human factors ’ when considering contamination inside gloves. When people take off dirty gloves, it is difficult to avoid touching the glove exterior.

40|$|Objective: In open lung surgery the {{surgical}} access is encircled by the ribs, which {{should result in}} a high glove perforation rate compared with other surgical specialities. Methods: Prospectively the surgeon, first and second assistant and the scrub nurse wore double standard latex gloves during 100 thoracotomies. Parameters recorded were: procedure performed, number of perforations, localization of perforation, the seniority of the surgeon, manoeuvre performed {{at the moment of}} perforation, immediate cause of perforation, operation time, performance of rib resection during thoractomy and time of occurrence of the first three perforations. Results: One thousand, six hundred and seventy-three gloves (902 outer, 771 inner) were tested. In 78 operations perforations occurred. There were 150 outer glove perfora-tions (8. 9 %, 0 – 8, mean 1. 23), 19 <b>inner</b> <b>glove</b> perforations (1. 13 %, 0 – 2, mean 0. 19). Cutaneous blood exposure was prevented in 78 % of all operations and in 87 % of all perforations. The perforation rate for the surgeon, the scrub nurse, the first and the second assistant were 61. 2, 40. 4, 9. 7 and 3. 1 % of all operations, respectively. Rib resection and a duration of more than 2 h resulted in a significant rise of glove perforation rate (P, 0. 05). The personal experience of the surgeon and the type of operation did not correlate with glove perforation. The immediate cause leading to perforation was named in only 17 cases (13. 7 %) and comprised contact with bone (seven), a needle stitch (seven) and a production flaw (three).

40|$|This {{dissertation}} presents {{experimental data}} on hand/finger cooling responses {{and performance in}} cold environments with and without gloves. The first part concerned studies of hand/finger cooling behaviors under various cold conditions. The experimental results with human subjects indicate that {{a reduction in the}} contact temperature is a function of thermal properties and surface temperature of the materials, skin {{and the nature of the}} contact as well. Manual performance reduced after gripping the cold objects. A decrease of the hand skin temperature causes the performance loss. The safety criteria for the contact temperature are suggested to be 0 °C (freezing), 7 °C (numbness) and 15 °C (pain sensation). An artificial heated finger model was developed and used to derive additional cooling information for extremely cold metallic surfaces. All results were utilized to establish relations between contact temperature, contact time and material used and compiled in an ergonomic database. The information can be used for risk assessment and for setting temperature limit values for products in appropriate standards for cold work. Manual performance, such as dexterity and tactile sensitivity of gloved hand in the cold operation, has been investigated. The relations among physical properties of protective gloves and hand performance were evaluated objectively and subjectively. Human subjects wearing four different work gloves and three different types of gloving (outer, inner and double) participated in the experimental studies during cold exposure. It is indicated that wearing various work gloves gives impairment in both manual dexterity and tactile sensitivity in cold operations. The performance was affected both by glove design and by hand/finger cooling. Use of double gloving is recommended to be an appropriate approach to use the protective gloves in the cold while <b>inner</b> <b>glove</b> can be used to perform some precision work. In extremely cold exposures hand cooling overrides the effect of glove on tactile performance. Development and use of an electrically heated glove should be considered for hand protection in a prolonged cold operation. Godkänd; 2001; 20061116 (haneit...|$|E
40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{determine}} {{the usefulness of}} double gloves in protecting against the exposure of surgical team members' hands to blood. METHODOLOGY: Five-hundred-ninety-six gloves were studied during 71 orthopedic operations using the water-loading test (filling a glove with water and occluding its cuff tightly to identify leaking points). RESULTS: In all, 73 glove perforations occurred, but only nine resulted in exposure to blood (blood touching the skin). The incidence of glove perforation was 12 % (73 / 596), and overall exposure (blood touching the skin) per operation was 13 % (9 / 71). The latter would have been 87 % (62 / 71) but {{for the use of}} double gloves. Sixteen percent of the perforations in double gloves were in the <b>inner</b> <b>gloves,</b> while 84 % were in the outer gloves. Exposure of surgeons was reduced from 54 % to 10 %, first assistants from 27 % to 3 %, and second assistants from 7 % to 0 (p < 0. 02, df = 2) by double-gloving. Significantly more perforations occurred during operations on bone, compared with soft tissue operations, p < 0. 0001, RR = 4 (95 % CL 1. 87 - 8. 55).

Work gloves have been worn over plastic gloves and separate, reusable, cotton <b>inner</b> <b>gloves</b> {{have been added to}} absorb sweat since skin problems were first recognized in 1994. All 74 males (mean ± SD, 38. 8 ± 8. 0 years) who work with the fluids were interviewed and given cutaneous examinations when indicated. While 4 cases of severe dermatitis and 31 cases of mild dermatitis were identified, 28 individuals gave a history of similar problems since the use of lubricating fluids. Their symptoms were typical of primary skin irritation. The hands were the commonly affected region (63 of 63 cases: 100 %), followed by the thighs (15. 9 %) and trunk (11. 1 %). The work-related skin symptoms identified were less common in workers who immediately removed the liquid with soap and water, when it is spilled on the hands, than in those who did not, but the difference was not statistically significant (7 / 23 (30. 4 %) vs. 28 / 51 (54. 9 %), p= 0. 051 by chi-square test).

40|$|The {{ultimate}} {{purpose was}} to assess if a whole glove dextrous robotic hand model provided results that differed from the reference modified closed-loop ASTM F 739 - 99 / 12 glove permeation technique. The candidate compounds were low volatile solvents to minimize the influence of volatilization as a confounding factor. After preliminary closed-loop studies with 2 -ethoxyethanol and 2 -butoxyethanol showed the breakthrough times for purple nitrile disposable gloves were too short to be compared in the dextrous robotic hand model, limonene was selected to compare the permeation parameters of different disposable nitrile exam gloves (blue, purple, sterling, and lavender) In the modified closed-loop ASTM permeation model four 1 -inch diameter standard permeation cells (3 cells with solvent as challenge and one air blank) were used with water as the collection solvent at 35 oC. Samples were analyzed by capillary gas chromatography-mass spectrometry and the internal standard method (4 -bromophenol). For the static and moving whole glove model, a Yeager robotic hand and assembled. A circulating water system transferred water from between the outer test <b>glove</b> and the <b>inner</b> chemically protective <b>glove</b> of the doubly gloved robot hand in an incubator at 35. 0 ± 0. 5 o C. The observed scheduled breakthrough time (SBRT) for blue, purple, sterling, and lavender glove specimens in the ASTM system was 70 ± 10 min, 30 ± 10 min, 15 ± 5 min, and 5 ± 5 min respectively. The two robot hand models showed similar SBRTs: 5 ± 5 min for lavender, 15 ± 5 min for sterling and purple, and 30 ± 10 min for blue gloves. The SBRTs for the blue and purple gloves for the robotic hand were significantly shorter than for the ASTM technique (P&# 8804; 0. 05). The average post-permeation thicknesses (before re-conditioning) for all glove materials for the moving and still robotic hand were more than 10 % of the pre-permeation ones (P&# 8804; 0. 05) except for the blue gloves, although this was not so on reconditioning. The average steady state permeation rate (SSPR) for lavender glove for the static robotic hand was 0. 423 ± 0. 031 µg/cm 2 /min significantly higher (1. 43 times) than for the ASTM method (0. 295 ± 0. 028 µg/cm 2 /min [P&# 8804; 0. 05]). Lavender gloves showed a significantly higher SSPR when the moving robotic hand was used (0. 490 ± 0. 031) compared to a non-moving one (P&# 8804; 0. 05). Although the respective SSPR for other gloves samples (blue, purple, and sterling) with the moving hand experiment appeared more than the static hand, {{the difference was not}} significant (P&# 8804; 0. 05). Here the exposed surface area was held constant as was temperature to assess if motion alone caused differences in permeation parameters. This suggests a thickness threshold for hand motion differences. The lavender, sterling, and purple gloves failed the Kimberly Clark Professional permeation breakthrough time criteria and Ansell's criteria for use, and therefore they should not be used as personal protective equipment for exposure to limonene, even for short exposure periods. Although blue gloves provided the highest performance against limonene compared to other gloves, they are safe for less than 20 minutes. Compared to the ASTM F 739 - 99 / 12 model, the robotic hand permeation model is more sensitive and stringent in defining gloves' efficacy since it better simulates grip motions in the workplace...|$|R
