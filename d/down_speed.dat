40|$|Abstract: Development {{trend of}} modern HSDI diesel engine is now {{focusing}} on low fuel consumption and emission because of {{strong interest in}} global environmental protection. Two big branches of criteria for modern diesel engine development are down sizing and <b>down</b> <b>speeding.</b> <b>Down</b> sizing keeps engine operation condition to the direction of higher load and thus pursuing for better thermal efficiency. But this may cause degraded vehicle dynamic performance because of reduced back up torque. <b>Down</b> <b>speeding</b> keeps engine operation condition to the direction of slightly higher load and lower engine speed. Therefore reduction of back up torque can be limited within flat torque area. This study analyzed fuel economy effect of <b>down</b> <b>speeding</b> on a vehicle powered by HSDI diesel engine in aspect of engine friction work, intake and exhaust pumping work, exhaust hat loss and thermal loss of fuel leakage of fuel injection system. Contribution factor of each engine and vehicle related parameters under basic and <b>down</b> <b>speeding</b> condition were compared and work balance of <b>down</b> <b>speeding</b> during NEDC was analyzed...|$|R

50|$|Each dragon type has a {{different}} Glide Gauge. The dragon's ability to slow <b>down</b> or <b>speed</b> up can only be done {{a limited number of}} times as it decreases the Glide Gauge. When the Glide Gauge is empty, the dragon can no longer slown <b>down</b> or <b>speed</b> up and must wait for the gauge to refill (which happens automatically over time). The Glide Wing can speed up or slow down up to three times using a full Glide Gauge, while the Base Wing can only do so two times. The Heavy Wing can't slow <b>down</b> or <b>speed</b> up at all, trading its mobility for a greater damage output.|$|R

To test this hypothesis, 19 children with autism, 37 typically-developing children and 17 children with Down syndrome were asked to reproduce facial and body movements presented on a computer at a normal/ecological and two slowed <b>down</b> <b>speeds.</b> Our main result showed that a subgroup of individuals with severe autism better reproduced the movements when presented slowly than at the ecological speed.

40|$|Owing to {{the high}} overall efficiency, truck {{manufacturers}} stick to diesel engines {{particularly in the case}} of long haul heavy duty trucks. In the ever increasing demand to increase the efficiency and to decrease the emission levels of the internal combustion engines an attempt is made in this thesis work to increase the fuel efficiency. There are many ways to increase the fuel efficiency like varying compression ratio, downsizing, <b>down</b> <b>speeding,</b> advanced combustion concepts (PCCI, HCCI) etc. but each of the mentioned method comes with challenges. In this thesis work an effort is made to study downspeeding by means of extensive simulation using commercial software GT-Power. By <b>down</b> <b>speeding,</b> the engine is made to run at low speeds and with high torques. For the same power the engine is operated at higher specific load (BMEP) which results in higher efficiency and reduced fuel consumption (BSFC). The reasons for increased fuel efficiency are reduced engine friction due to low piston speeds, reduced relative heat transfer and increased thermodynamic efficiency. Since this is a conceptual study and experiments may require a new engine design altogether, scope of the study is limited to simulation results and no validation is done...|$|R

Turntablists manipulate records on a turntable by moving the record with their hand to cue the stylus to exact points on a record, and by touching or moving the platter or record to stop, slow <b>down,</b> <b>speed</b> up or, spin the record backwards, or moving the turntable platter back and forth (the popular rhythmic [...] "scratching" [...] effect which is a key part of hip hop music), all while using a DJ mixer's crossfader control and the mixer's gain and equalization controls to adjust the sound and level of each turntable.

5000|$|Biomechanical factors {{associated}} with elite runners include increased hip function, use and stride length over recreational runners. [...] An increase in running speeds causes increased ground reaction forces and elite distance runners must compensate for this to maintain their pace over long distances.These forces are attenuated through increased stride length via increased hip flexion and extension through decreased ground contact time and more force being used in propulsion. [...] With increased propulsion in the horizontal plane, less impact occurs from decreased force in the vertical plane. [...] Increased hip flexion allows for increased use of the hip extensors through midstance and toe-off, allowing for more force production.The difference even between world class and national level distance runners {{has been associated with}} more efficient hip joint function. [...] The increase in velocity likely comes from the increased range of motion in hip flexion and extension, allowing for greater acceleration and velocity. The hip extensors and hip extension have been linked to more powerful knee extension during toe-off, which contributes to propulsion.Stride length must be properly increased with some degree of knee flexion maintained through the terminal swing phases, as excessive knee extension during this phase along with footstrike has been associated with higher impact forces due to braking and an increased prevalence of heel striking. [...] Elite runners tend to exhibit some degree of knee flexion at footstrike and midstance, which first serves to eccentrically absorb impact forces in the quadriceps muscle group. [...] Secondly it allows for the knee joint to concentrically contract and provides major aid in propulsion during toe-off as the quadriceps group is capable of produce large amounts of force.Recreational runners have been shown to increase stride length through increased knee extension rather than increased hip flexion as exhibited by elite runners, which serves instead to provide an intense breaking motion with each step and decrease the rate and efficiency of knee extension during toe-off, slowing <b>down</b> <b>speed.</b> [...] Knee extension however contributes to additional stride length and propulsion during toe-off and is seen more frequently in elite runners as well.|$|E
