5|$|A book {{published}} by Nationalmuseum in 1992 on Carl Larsson {{claims that the}} most <b>immediate</b> <b>and</b> natural explanation for the ultimate rejection of the painting {{was the fact that}} time had rendered the painting unfashionable. Because of the long debate, the painting became a survivor from a time past and it could not meet the modernist ideals of the new century.|$|E
5|$|An {{increasingly}} common strategy to preserve bone and reduce treatment times includes {{the placement of}} a dental implant into a recent extraction site. On the one hand, it shortens treatment time and can improve aesthetics because the soft tissue envelope is preserved. On the other hand, implants may have a slightly higher rate of initial failure. Conclusions on this topic are difficult to draw, however, because few studies have compared <b>immediate</b> <b>and</b> delayed implants in a scientifically rigorous manner.|$|E

A more immediate legacy of his command was his creation, {{in conjunction with the}} U.S. Navy, of an effective air-sea rescue system that saved half of all B-29 crews downed at sea in 1945.|$|E
5|$|Local {{symptoms}} include <b>immediate</b> <b>and</b> intense pain, followed {{after a few}} minutes (but perhaps by as much as 30 minutes) by swelling and a tingling sensation. Blisters containing blood are not common. The pain may spread within a few hours, along with tenderness and inflammation. Reddish lymphangitic lines and bruising may appear, and the whole limb can become swollen and bruised within 24 hours. Swelling may also spread to the trunk, and with children, throughout the entire body. Necrosis and intracompartmental syndromes are very rare.|$|E

Large numbers of items such as wheelbarrows, bottled water, helmet lights, knee pads, rain gear, and even football helmets were donated. The sheer quantity of such donations caused logistical and inventory control problems until drop-off centers were set up to accept and sort the goods. The Oklahoma Restaurant Association, which was holding a trade show in the city, assisted rescue workers by providing 15,000 to 20,000meals over a ten-day period.|$|E
5|$|Adderall is {{available}} as immediate-release tablets or two different extended-release formulations. The extended-release capsules are generally {{used in the}} morning. A shorter, 12-hour extended-release formulation {{is available}} under the brand Adderall XR and {{is designed to provide}} a therapeutic effect and plasma concentrations identical to taking two doses 4hours apart. The longer extended-release formulation, approved for 16 hours, is available under the brand Mydayis. In the United States, the <b>immediate</b> <b>and</b> extended release (XR) formulations of Adderall are both available as generic drugs, while Mydayis is available only as a brand-name drug.|$|E
5|$|After {{considering}} {{pursuing a}} master's degree {{on the topic}} of hard science fiction novels as fascist literature, Gibson discontinued writing in the year that followed graduation and, as one critic put it, expanded his collection of punk records. During this period he worked at various jobs, including a three-year stint as teaching assistant on a film history course at his alma mater. Impatient at much of what he saw at a science fiction convention in Vancouver in 1980 or 1981, Gibson found a kindred spirit in fellow panelist, punk musician and author John Shirley. The two became <b>immediate</b> <b>and</b> lifelong friends. Shirley persuaded Gibson to sell his early short stories and to take writing seriously.|$|E

Traumatic brain injury, for example in contact sport, after a fall, or in traffic or work accidents, can be associated with both <b>immediate</b> <b>and</b> longer-term problems. Immediate problems that develop may include bleeding within the skull, compressing the brain tissue or damaging its blood supply, skull fractures, injury to a particular area, deafness, and concussion. In addition to the site of injury, the opposite side of the brain may be affected, termed a contrecoup injury. Longer-term issues that may develop include post-traumatic stress, hydrocephalus, and chronic traumatic encephalopathy.|$|E
5|$|On February 5, 1981, 150 police raided four gay bathhouses in Toronto, Ontario: the Club Baths, the Romans II Health and Recreation Spa, the Richmond Street Health Emporium, and The Barracks. The Richmond Health Emporium was {{so badly}} damaged in the raid {{that it never}} reopened. Nicknamed Operation Soap, the raid {{resulted}} in the arrests of 268 men. There was an <b>immediate</b> <b>and</b> angry response from both {{the gay and lesbian}} community and over 3,000 people gathered in protest. A second demonstration which took place on February 20, included over 4,000 people who gathered at Queen's Park and marched to Metro Toronto Police's 52 Division.|$|E
5|$|The Seventeenth Amendment {{altered the}} process for electing United States Senators and changed the way {{vacancies}} would be filled.

The power to call such an election can also be granted to the governor. It also had an <b>immediate</b> <b>and</b> dramatic impact on the political composition of the U.S. Senate.|$|E

5|$|A general {{principle}} concerning dental abscesses is ubi pus, ibi evacua ("{{where there is}} pus, drain it"), which applies to any case {{where there is a}} collection of pus in the tissues (such as a periodontal abscess, pericoronal abscess, or apical abscess). The pus within the abscess is under pressure, and the surrounding tissues are deformed and stretched to accommodate the swelling. This leads to a sensation of throbbing (often in time with the pulse) and constant pain. Pus may be evacuated via the tooth by drilling into the pulp chamber (an endodontic access cavity). Such a treatment is sometimes termed open drainage. Drainage can also be performed via the tooth socket, once the causative tooth is extracted. If neither of those measures succeeds, or they are impossible, incision and drainage may be required, in which a small incision is made in the soft tissues directly over the abscess at the most dependent point. A surgical instrument such as a pair of tweezers is gently inserted into the incision and opened, while the abscess is massaged to encourage the pus to drain out. Usually, the reduction in pain when the pus drains is <b>immediate</b> <b>and</b> marked as the built up pressure is relieved. If the pus drains into the mouth, there is usually a bad or offensive taste.|$|E
5|$|In {{his book}} King Solomon's Ring, Konrad Lorenz {{described}} and analysed the complex social interactions {{in a western}} jackdaw flock that lived around his house in Altenberg, Austria. He ringed them for identification and caged them in the winter to prevent their annual migration. He found that the birds have a linear hierarchical group structure, with higher-ranked individuals dominating lower-ranked birds, and pair-bonded birds sharing the same rank. Young males establish their individual status before pairing with females. Upon pairing, the female assumes the same social position as her partner. Unmated females are the lowest members in the pecking order, and are the last {{to have access to}} food and shelter. Lorenz noted one case in which a male, absent during the dominance struggles and pair bondings, returned to the flock, became the dominant male, and chose one of two unpaired females for a mate. This female immediately assumed a dominant position in the social hierarchy and demonstrated this by pecking others. According to Lorenz, the most significant factor in social behaviour was the <b>immediate</b> <b>and</b> intuitive grasp of the new hierarchy by each of the western jackdaws in the flock.|$|E
