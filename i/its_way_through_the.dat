5|$|Even as the Thirteenth Amendment {{was working}} <b>its</b> <b>way</b> <b>through</b> <b>the</b> {{ratification}} process, Republicans in Congress grew increasingly {{concerned about the}} potential for there to be a large increase in the congressional representation of the Democratic-dominated Southern states. Because the full population of freed slaves would be counted rather than three-fifths, the Southern states would dramatically increase their power in the population-based House of Representatives. Republicans hoped to offset this advantage by attracting and protecting votes of the newly enfranchised black population.|$|E
5|$|The Swedish army {{surrounded}} Copenhagen, {{hoping to}} starve it into submission. This failed when the Dutch Republic joined the conflict on the Danish {{side and a}} reinforcing fleet managed to smash <b>its</b> <b>way</b> <b>through</b> <b>the</b> Swedish naval forces in Øresund. Charles then tried a decisive assault on the city, hoping to conquer it and win the war; this plan likewise failed. Brandenburg, Poland and Austria then also joined {{the war against the}} Swedes.|$|E

It heads to the northeast, paralleling a small creek as it progresses through the rural town consisting mostly of cultivated fields. NY220 passes into the town of McDonough and enters a hamlet bearing the same name, where it turns eastward. The route winds <b>its</b> <b>way</b> <b>through</b> <b>the</b> eastern, forested portion of the town to the small community of East McDonough, located near the McDonough–Preston town line. Here, NY220 turns southeast and continues into Preston.|$|E

5|$|The Relay was {{introduced}} at the 1958 British Empire and Commonwealth Games in Cardiff, Wales. Up until, and including, the 1994 Games, the Relay only went through England {{and the host}} nation. The Relay for the 1998 Games in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia {{was the first to}} travel to other nations of the Commonwealth. The Gold Coast 2018 Queen’s Baton Relay is set to be the longest in Commonwealth Games history. Covering 230,000 km over 388 days, the Baton will make <b>its</b> <b>way</b> <b>through</b> <b>the</b> six Commonwealth regions of Africa, the Americas, the Caribbean, Europe, Asia and Oceania. For the first time, the Queen's baton was presented at the Commonwealth Youth Games during its sixth edition in 2017 which were held in Nassau, Bahamas.|$|E
5|$|The United Kingdom and her Allies {{had been}} at war against Napoleon's French Empire since 1803, but by early 1814 Wellington's army had fought <b>its</b> <b>way</b> <b>through</b> <b>the</b> Peninsula to France, and the eastern Allies were {{threatening}} France's eastern borders. On 31 March 1814, allied armies entered Paris, and Napoleon abdicated on 6 April. Within a month of Napoleon's abdication, he had been exiled to Elba. It appeared {{that the war was}} over, and arrangements for the peace were discussed at the Congress of Vienna. But on 26 February 1815, Napoleon escaped from Elba and returned to France, where he raised an army.|$|E
5|$|The {{issue of}} minimum range {{continued}} to be raised, working <b>its</b> <b>way</b> <b>through</b> <b>the</b> Air Ministry and eventually to Harold Lardner, head of what was then known as the Stanmore Research Centre. Rowe and his deputy Bennett Lewis were called to meet with Lardner to discuss the issue. Apparently without informing Lardner of Bowen and Hanbury Brown's potential solution, {{or the fact that}} they could not work on it due to the ongoing installations, they agreed to have Lewis investigate the matter. Lewis then sent a contract to EMI to see what they could do. According to both Bowen and Hanbury Brown, Rowe and Lewis instigated these events deliberately to pull control of the AI project from the AI team.|$|E

5|$|At 1 p.m. on November 27, Peng {{ordered the}} PVA 66th Corps {{to destroy the}} ROK 1st Infantry Division before the Koreans could retreat to the Ch'ongch'on River. On the evening of November 27, the PVA 66th Corps {{launched}} a massive attack against the ROK 1st Infantry Division, the US 5th Regimental Combat Team of the 24th Infantry Division and the US 35th Infantry Regiment. After midnight, the Chinese attacks broke through the Korean lines and captured Yongsan-dong, resulting {{in the loss of}} the ROK 11th, 15th and US 35th Infantry Regiment's command posts. The ROK 11th and 15th Infantry Regiment were soon scattered while the retreating US 35th Infantry Regiment was blocked at Yongsan-dong with Chinese forces attacking from behind. Under heavy pressure, the US 35th Infantry Regiment fought <b>its</b> <b>way</b> <b>through</b> <b>the</b> town and rejoined the US 25th Division on the afternoon of November 28. At the same time, Paik rallied the broken ROK regiments and recaptured Yongsan-dong. The ROK 1st Infantry Division held the town against the subsequent Chinese attacks until it withdrew from the battle on November 29.|$|E
5|$|Earlier in {{the morning}} Dupont had {{proceeded}} with his column south and east along the river, from Marbach, according to instructions. Even {{before the arrival of}} Mortier's courier, he heard the sound of artillery in the distance and sent riders ahead to discover the cause. They came back to report that a Russian column (Dokhturov's) was descending from the mountains to take the road to Dürenstein. Realizing this would separate him from the forward division, Dupont hustled his troops toward the sound of battle and deployed them to take the Russians in the flank. The French assault, heralded by cannon fire, caused Dokhturov's troops to turn their attention from Gazan's beleaguered force to face these new assailants. Although superior in numbers, Dokhturov's column had no supporting artillery, and the narrow space prevented them from taking advantage of their size. It was Dokhturov's turn to face attackers at his front and rear, until the arrival of Schmitt's column, which wended <b>its</b> <b>way</b> <b>through</b> <b>the</b> mountains in the west.|$|E
5|$|McKnight {{remained}} at North Castle until John Morgan, the Director General, ordered him and Samuel Adams, Jr. (the son of Samuel Adams of Massachusetts) {{to set up}} a new hospital near Peekskill, New York, for more than 300 sick soldiers of General William Heath's division. Unable to find an acceptable site for a hospital, the two surgeons took over accommodations in Fishkill, New York, twenty miles north of Peekskill. Washington, however, sent convalescents to Peekskill because Morgan told him the hospital was there. Morgan was dismissed as Director General soon thereafter, in January 1777, due to rancor with Washington over supplies and a rampant smallpox epidemic then raging <b>its</b> <b>way</b> <b>through</b> <b>the</b> army. Morgan's management style rankled the surgeons, including McKnight, as Morgan was wrestling with Shippen, McKnight's mentor, over control of the hospitals in New Jersey. Isaac Foster took over temporary supervision of the hospitals {{on the east side of}} the Hudson River after Morgan's dismissal at Washington's request.|$|E

5|$|These {{mountains}} and hills are traversed by an extensive network of river valleys {{and are in}} most cases covered with dense rainforest. There are lower ranges of hills extending towards the western coasts, southern plains, and the interior or central part of Sabah. The central and eastern portion of Sabah are generally lower mountain ranges and plains with occasional hills. In the east coast located the Kinabatangan River, which is the second longest river in Malaysia after Rajang River in Sarawak with a length of 560 kilometres. The river begins from the western ranges and snakes <b>its</b> <b>way</b> <b>through</b> <b>the</b> central region towards the east coast out into the Sulu Sea.

5|$|This {{relationship}} between distance and intimacy, between imagery and sound, is {{also present in}} the opening sequence of The Wind Will Carry Us. From the outset, Kiarostami formulates a dialectical {{relationship between}} image and sound. The camera moves from long shots of the Land Rover winding <b>its</b> <b>way</b> <b>through</b> <b>the</b> mountain paths to extreme close-ups of the film’s protagonist. Concurrently, Kiarostami aurally represents an expanse that extends far beyond what the viewer can see at any moment, even when the camera remains a considerable distance from the subject matter on-screen. Kiarostami establishes numerous spaces beyond the visual field by fragmenting his soundtrack to include other sounds such as birds singing, dogs barking and electronic devices such as cell phones and radios blaring in the distance. By referring to characters the viewer does not see or hear, Kiarostami widens the scope of his films.|$|E
5|$|During late 1944 {{and early}} 1945, the Waffen Mountain (Karstjäger) Brigade of the SS fought first against British-supported partisans in the Julian Alps, and was then {{deployed}} to the coastal area around Trieste and the Marano-Grado Lagoon. In {{danger of being}} cut off by Allied forces, the brigade soon returned to the Julian Alps, having to fight <b>its</b> <b>way</b> <b>through</b> <b>the</b> Tagliamento river valley between Osoppo and Gemona. Toward the end of April 1945, the brigade fought British and New Zealand forces on the southern fringe of the Julian Alps. The brigade replacement company, which {{had been sent to}} Cividale from its training centre at Pottenstein, Bavaria, managed to destroy a number of British tanks with panzerfausts and the assistance of a tank company. In the final weeks of the war the brigade was part of a Kampfgruppe (battlegroup) commanded by SS-Brigadeführer und Generalmajor der Waffen-SS (Brigadier) Heinz Harmel, which was ordered to keep the Karawanks passes open between Yugoslavia and Austria. This task was critical in allowing German forces to withdraw from Yugoslavia in order to surrender to British rather than Yugoslav forces. The Kampfgruppe succeeded in its final task, {{and was one of the}} last German units to surrender, when it encountered the British 6th Armoured Division on 9 May 1945.|$|E
