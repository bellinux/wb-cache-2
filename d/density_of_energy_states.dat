Multiple-quantum transitions from excited states to higher/lower states are considered for the electronic ground state of the nitrogen molecule N 2 (X 1 Sigma-g(+)).

40|$|The {{phenomenon}} of frustration, which {{gives rise to}} many fascinating phenomena, is conventionally associated with the topology of non-bipartite lattices, where nearest-neighbor (nn) interactions and global connectivity compete in the lowering <b>of</b> <b>energy.</b> The issue <b>of</b> rattling atoms in spacious lattice sites is a separate occurrence that {{can also lead to}} a high <b>density</b> <b>of</b> low <b>energy</b> <b>states</b> (unusual low temperature thermodynamics) and to practical applications such as in improved thermoelectric materials. In this letter we address a unique situation where both phenomena arise: a four-fold single-site instability leads to rattling of cations on a diamond structure sublattice where nn interactions frustrate simple ordering of the displacements. The system deals with this coupling of rattling+frustration by commensurate ordering. Such a disorder-order transition may account for the second phase transition seen in KOs 2 O 6 within the superconducting state, and the unusual low-energy dynamics and associated electron-phonon coupling can account for the qualitative differences in physical properties of KOs 2 O 6 compared to RbOs 2 O 6 and CsOs 2 O 6, all of which have essentially identical average crystal and electronic structures.

30|$|This {{model is}} {{essentially}} a grain connected by two tunnel junctions to a voltage source. The DNA molecule is not very conductive; however, it does possess a large energy gap which makes single electron transfer possible. In order for this circuit to operate as a transistor, the voltage supplied to the circuit is varied around threshold levels. This voltage can be varied if the tunneling rates of electrons between the two junctions are different or {{if there is a}} gap in the <b>density</b> <b>of</b> the <b>energy</b> <b>states</b> <b>of</b> the grain. The natural <b>energy</b> gap <b>of</b> the DNA can be enhanced using a longer strand of DNA having more than one grain. Longer chains of DNA tend to have more non-linear effects. As a result, more charges are formed. A large uncoated DNA molecule is, thus, used as compared to one that is entirely coated with a metal sheath. The tunneling rates of electrons, however, are about the same as the two phosphate bonds are identical. To counter this effect, a chemical group may be attached to one of the phosphate bonds, thus altering its properties and making electron transport and transistor behavior possible [67].|$|R
