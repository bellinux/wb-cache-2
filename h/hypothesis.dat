Cantor believed the continuum <b>hypothesis</b> to be true and tried for many years to prove it, in vain. His inability to prove the continuum <b>hypothesis</b> caused him considerable anxiety.|$|E
5|$|Complicating {{factors include}} {{claims that the}} {{relationship}} between eukaryotes and the archaeal phylum Crenarchaeota is closer than the relationship between the Euryarchaeota and the phylum Crenarchaeota and the presence of archaea-like genes in certain bacteria, such as Thermotoga maritima, from horizontal gene transfer. The standard <b>hypothesis</b> states that the ancestor of the eukaryotes diverged early from the Archaea, and that eukaryotes arose through fusion of an archaean and eubacterium, which became the nucleus and cytoplasm; this explains various genetic similarities but runs into difficulties explaining cell structure. An alternative <b>hypothesis,</b> the eocyte <b>hypothesis,</b> posits that Eukaryota emerged relatively late from the Archaea.|$|E
40|$|Abstract: This paper {{presents}} a computational approach to intelligence analysis and its current implementation into a cognitive assistant called Disciple-CD. Intelligence analysis {{is viewed as}} ceaseless discovery of evidence, <b>hypotheses,</b> and arguments in a non-stationary world, involving cooperative processes of evidence in search of <b>hypotheses,</b> <b>hypotheses</b> in search of evidence, and evidentiary tests of <b>hypotheses.</b> Disciple-CD helps intelligence analysts formulate <b>hypotheses,</b> develop arguments that reduce complex <b>hypotheses</b> to simpler and simpler ones, collect evidence to evaluate the simplest <b>hypotheses,</b> assess the relevance, believability, and inferential force of evidence, and finally the likeliness of the <b>hypotheses...</b>|$|R
40|$|Generating and {{evaluating}} alternative <b>hypotheses</b> {{is an essential}} component of scientific discovery. Evidence from cognitive psychology shows that testing multiple <b>hypotheses,</b> unfortunately, is not effective unless subjects state the <b>hypotheses</b> explicitly. The presence of multiple <b>hypotheses</b> facilitates the efficient elimination of incorrect <b>hypotheses</b> because it makes the possibility of disconfirmation more salient. Although several computational models of scientific discovery have included the generation and evaluation of multiple <b>hypotheses,</b> most of these approaches have not focused on multiple <b>hypotheses.</b> Therefore, further research needs to examine systematically the conditions under which multiple <b>hypotheses</b> are effective...|$|R

5|$|Many {{microbes}} {{have been}} proposed as triggers of MS, but none have been confirmed. Moving {{at an early age}} from one location in the world to another alters a person's subsequent risk of MS. An explanation for this could be that some kind of infection, produced by a widespread microbe rather than a rare one, is related to the disease. Proposed mechanisms include the hygiene <b>hypothesis</b> and the prevalence <b>hypothesis.</b> The hygiene <b>hypothesis</b> proposes that exposure to certain infectious agents early in life is protective, the disease being a response to a late encounter with such agents. The prevalence <b>hypothesis</b> proposes that the disease is due to an infectious agent more common in regions where MS is common and where in most individuals it causes an ongoing infection without symptoms. Only in a few cases and after many years does it cause demyelination. The hygiene <b>hypothesis</b> has received more support than the prevalence <b>hypothesis.</b>|$|E

The bacteria rickettsia and chlamydia are living cells that, like viruses, can reproduce only inside host cells.

5|$|The carbon:nutrient balance <b>hypothesis,</b> {{also known}} as the {{environmental}} constraint <b>hypothesis</b> or Carbon Nutrient Balance Model (CNBM), states that the various types of plant defenses are responses to variations in the levels of nutrients in the environment. This <b>hypothesis</b> predicts the Carbon/Nitrogen ratio in plants determines which secondary metabolites will be synthesized. For example, plants growing in nitrogen-poor soils will use carbon-based defenses (mostly digestibility reducers), while those growing in low-carbon environments (such as shady conditions) are more likely to produce nitrogen-based toxins. The <b>hypothesis</b> further predicts that plants can change their defenses in response to changes in nutrients. For example, if plants are grown in low-nitrogen conditions, then these plants will implement a defensive strategy composed of constitutive carbon-based defenses. If nutrient levels subsequently increase, by for example the addition of fertilizers, these carbon-based defenses will decrease.|$|E

However, since the early 1980s studies of young stars have shown them to be surrounded by cool discs of dust and gas, exactly as the nebular <b>hypothesis</b> predicts, which has led to its re-acceptance.|$|E
