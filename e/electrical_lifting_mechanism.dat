40|$|Window {{regulator}} {{system is}} becoming a complicated mechatronic system. To obtain and improve understandings of system behaviors, this work developed models and simulations. To realize the target, system simulation with uniformed modeling language, VHDL-AMS, is chosen as tool. At first, dynamic behavior of window regulator system is studied with method of averaging by a highly abstracted model. As next, main components, e. g. <b>electrical</b> drive, <b>lifting</b> <b>mechanism,</b> door frame and electronic system, are studied and modelled. Parametrization achieves with information from suppliers, existing data bank and measurements. Component models are verified and validated against their measurements. Afterwards, system simulation is built up by assembling component models. As verification and validation, system simulations are compared to measurements. As applications, simulations are used to investigate anti-pinch processes, influence of drum diameter and so on. Depending on the purpose of usage, they can be further improved. As summary, simulation provides support in development of window regulator systems.

Especially, in this work, the deploying time is investigated by changing the principal design parameters of the hinge part of the hood mechanism. After briefly introducing the working principle of the active hood <b>lift</b> <b>mechanism</b> operated by the gunpowder actuator, the governing dynamic equations of the active hood <b>lift</b> <b>mechanism</b> are formulated for deploying motion. Subsequently, using the governing equations of motion, the response time for deploying the hood <b>lift</b> <b>mechanism</b> is investigated by changing several geometric locations such as the location of actuator. Then, a comparison is made of the total response time to completely deploy the hood <b>lift</b> <b>mechanism</b> with the existing conventional hood <b>lift</b> <b>mechanism</b> and the proposed active hood <b>lift</b> <b>mechanism.</b> In addition, the workable driving speed of the proposed active hood <b>lift</b> <b>mechanism</b> is compared with the conventional one by changing the powder volume of the actuator...|$|R

40|$|International audienceThis paper {{presents}} an original continuously variable intake valve <b>lift</b> <b>mechanism</b> {{designed for the}} automotive spark ignition engines. The paper first presents the analytical kinematic synthesis of the variable intake valve <b>lift</b> <b>mechanism,</b> which consists in finding out the required intake cam profile starting from an imposed intake valve lift law. Then, by using the obtained cam profile, a computer-aided kinematic analysis of the variable intake valve <b>lift</b> <b>mechanism</b> is performed using commercial CAD software. The accuracy of the motion conversion performed with CAD software is validated by checking the degree of correlation between the resulted intake valve lift law and the imposed law used when performing the analytical synthesis. The goals of the kinematic analysis are first to find the partial laws of the intake valve lift, corresponding to the engine part loads and second, to find the transfer functions of the elements used to command the mechanism, i. e. the dependency between these elements and the intake valve lift law. The designed variable intake valve <b>lift</b> <b>mechanism</b> is successfully operated on an engine prototype and proved its energetic improvement potential...|$|R

This paper covers the design of a tube-transferring car for deep sea pipe-laying, especially its <b>lifting</b> <b>mechanism.</b> Kinematics and dynamics analysis of the <b>lifting</b> <b>mechanism</b> is conducted. During dynamic analysis and calculation, the single degree of freedom mechanical system dynamic analysis method is used.

40|$|In {{erection}} equipment {{of space}} launch complexes the hydraulic <b>lifting</b> <b>mechanisms</b> (HLM) are solely and exclusively used to accomplish changing the space-mission vehicle (SMV) position from horizontal to the vertical one. Existing designs of <b>lifting</b> <b>mechanisms</b> are diverse, {{but all of}} them basically contain a basic mechanism comprising one hydro-cylinder. With increasing SMV size and weight a task to design the more complicated <b>lifting</b> <b>mechanisms,</b> comprising more kinematic links and using several hydro-cylinders becomes urgent. The article conducts a detailed analysis of the basic HLM schemes and defines the features of their arrangement in erection equipment. Gives basic calculation relationships, allowing us to determine design parameters of mechanisms for stationary and transport units. Via examples of available erection equipment shows the embodiment of <b>lifting</b> <b>mechanisms</b> using basic schemes. The ways for development of HLM schemes to erect a SMV of the large size and weight are shown. Two options of the double-cylinder HLM are described. Both schemes are based on dividing a lift cycle into two parts, in each of which only one of the cylinders is in operation. The first option contains an additional, intermediate boom, with respect to which the main boom is erected. In such a mechanism the cylinders start running sequentially: at first, one of the cylinders erects the intermediate boom, then the other cylinder does the main one. The second HLM embodiment comprises a single carrier boom with the swing arm, which allows to swing the boom at a certain angle of less than 90 ¬∞ using one of the cylinders, also sequentially operating. The second cylinder allows the boom to fall into vertical position. Such schemes can reduce a stroke length of used hydraulic cylinders, which are the most expensive devices of the <b>lifting</b> <b>mechanism.</b> The analysis results are of interest to designers of erection equipment for the space launch complexes. </p...|$|R
