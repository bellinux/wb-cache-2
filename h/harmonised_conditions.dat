30|$|The {{transport}} {{rules of}} CIM and SMGS help to better organise transport processes in international {{rail freight transport}} and they <b>harmonise</b> <b>conditions</b> for quick, quality and safe international rail freight transport. Establishing {{the advantages and disadvantages}} of the transport rules of CIM and SMGS is a complicated process which is affected by several factors. For example, Belarus, the Russian Federation and Kazakhstan have common customs areas and for these countries and their railway companies SMGS transport rules are preferable. In the Slovak Republic it is more convenient to use CIM transport rules based on the membership in the EU. One of great advantages of CIM rules is that the consignment note can be used as a customs paper in rail transport. When a carrier uses CIM consignment note for import or export to/from the EU there is no need to make an additional customs document. With the SMGS consignment note this option does not exist and the carrier (or shipper) must create a transit declaration based on the Union Customs Code ([URL] [22].|$|R
30|$|What {{would an}} EU-wide {{unemployment}} benefit mean? What {{would be the}} relation with existing national systems of unemployment benefit? It is assumed that Member States {{would be expected to}} maintain their national benefit systems: i.e. they would not simply reduce their national benefits by the amount of the EU-benefit. The most straightforward EU scheme could take the form of extending the duration of unemployment insurance beyond the current national limits. As such it would closely parallel the federal extended Unemployment Insurance benefits in the United States. When unemployment reaches a threshold level, US states are required by federal law to extend benefits. In 2013, under the Emergency Compensation Program, benefits are paid according to a tiered scale: for example, up to 54 weeks where the state unemployment rate is 6 per cent or higher, reaching a maximum of 73 weeks where the unemployment rate is 9 per cent or higher. Extended unemployment insurance would in itself help address the problem of benefit exhaustion in national schemes, but other aspects would require action on the other benefit conditions. Here the EU scheme could, more ambitiously, seek to <b>harmonise</b> <b>conditions</b> such as those regarding “voluntary entry” into unemployment, availability for work, and refusal of job offers. An alternative would be to re-open the idea of a X+ 1 th state, under which the EU would constitute itself as an additional state providing an autonomous social security system. 2 Initially envisaged for migrant workers, for whom it could be either voluntary or compulsory, a European Social Security System could be opened on a voluntary basis to all EU citizens. As such, it would provide a benchmark for national systems.|$|R

40|$|Abstract: Currently {{established}} and projected regulatory frameworks require {{the classification of}} materials (whether nano or non-nano) as specified by respective definitions, {{most of which are}} based {{on the size of the}} constituent particles. This brings up the question if currently available techniques for particle size determination are capable of reliably classifying materials that potentially fall under these definitions. In this study, a wide variety of characterisation techniques, including counting, fractionating, and spectroscopic techniques, has been applied to the same set of materials under <b>harmonised</b> <b>conditions.</b> The selected materials comprised well-defined quality control materials (spherical, monodisperse) as well as industrial materials of complex shapes and considerable polydispersity. As a result, each technique could be evaluated with respect to the determination of the number-weighted median size. Recommendations on the most appropriate and efficient use of techniques for different types of material are given. Graphical Abstract: [Figure not available: see fulltext. ]</p...|$|E
40|$|The new {{smartphone}} era {{is challenging}} the leading position the European Union (EU) has been occupying in the mobile economy, falling behind other economies {{such as the}} United States and some countries in the Asia-Pacific region. The EU acknowledges the fragmented structure of the electronic communications market as {{being one of the}} main obstacles to LTE deployment. The EC argues that a main source of fragmentation is lack of <b>harmonised</b> <b>conditions</b> governing the use of radio spectrum across the EU. The EU member states have developed different and sometimes conflicting radio spectrum management practices through time. A consequent drawback is the impossibility of providing wireless broadband dervices across national borders and of deploying the necessary wireless networks and radio equipment. In consequence, on 11 September 2013, the European Commission put forward a new legislative package for a 'Connected Continent: Building a Telecoms Single Market' which contains several reforms directed to create a single telecommunications market. Some of the proposed reforms would partly modify the existing regulatory system of the radio spectrum, introducing <b>harmonised</b> <b>conditions</b> governing national assignment procedures. Through a document analysis and selected experts interviews the paper attempts to assess whether the EU is moving towards a strategic development of radio spectrum policy by looking at the EU initiatives on radio spectrum since the beginning in 1987. Then the focus is narrowed down to the Connected Continent legislative proposal, to value its contribution to the harmonisation of national assignment procedures. The historical overview of the EU radio spectrum policy shows that the EU has gradually acknowledged the negative implications of national fragmented and inconsistent radio spectrum governing rules. The EU has become aware of the need for a long-term strategy for the planning of the use of radio spectrum for the creation and functioning of the EU internal market. However, the paper also claims that in the arduous process of harmonisation of radio spectrum use much has still to be accomplished. Furthermore the paper draws the conclusions that the radio spectrum reforms contained the Connected Continent legislative proposal are probably not the means by which the harmonisation of radio spectrum use for the completion of the internal market can be enhanced. The EU and the EU member states have remarkably diverging and conflicting views on the content of the EC proposed reforms. The EU member states are unwilling to give up on their prerogatives on the radio spectrum by accepting too intrusive harmonised measures...|$|E
40|$|During {{the credit}} crisis, central banks and governments have taken {{extraordinary}} measures to preserve financial stability and prevent strong credit rationing {{of the private}} sector. Central banks cut official rates, provided liquidity support to the banking sector and supported specific financial markets with asset purchase programmes, whilst governments introduced measures such as guarantee schemes and made capital injections. These interventions prevented the financial system from collapsing and, in that sense, they have been effective. At the same time, the authorities have been aware that their measures may have distortionary effects on the markets. For instance, they may distort the level playing field between financial institutions that received support and those that did not, as is noticeable, for instance, from differences in funding costs. Furthermore, support aimed at specific market segments may lead to shifts in capital flows, and cross-border shifts may take place {{as a result of}} country-specific differences in support packages. Longer-term distortionary effects may follow, in particular, from excessive risk taking, e. g. by management, shareholders, bondholders and depositors of financial institutions. Such 'moral hazard' may also be created by extremely low policy rates and IMF measures. In designing their support measures, the authorities have sought to limit possible distortionary effects as much as possible. Thus, to the greatest possible extent, government support was granted on market-compatible and internationally <b>harmonised</b> <b>conditions.</b> Uncertainty among market participants may be mitigated by providing clarity on the details of the support policies, by creating an arm's length relationship {{between the government and the}} business management of the support-receiving institutions and by ensuring sustained responsibility on the part of private stakeholders. Of final importance is a smooth exit from support policies as soon as market recovery allows it. ...|$|E

40|$|In {{a digital}} age public sector {{geoinformation}} (PSGI) is potentially a vital {{link in the}} added-value chain. Yet private sector value-added resellers (VARs) still face a number of barriers to using PSGI. Price is only one impediment. The complexity of licences and restrictive licence conditions of PSGI may be an even bigger obstacle. Especially when combining different datasets, VARs can face a quagmire of conflicting licence conditions. Batty (2006 Environment and Planning B: Planning and Design 33; 164) called for research that would stimulate value-added use of PSGI. However, inconsistent and intransparent licence conditions for PSGI are among the biggest obstacles of PSGI for VARs. This paper explores the current PSGI licences to assess the actual restrictions and how current obstacles can be levelled. The Creative Commons licensing concept was explored and adapted to make it suitable for licensing PSGI. The resulting concept of Geo Shared licences is a means to <b>harmonise</b> licence <b>conditions</b> for PSGI. Our {{research shows that the}} Geo Shared concept can be a valuable contribution to further harmonisation of PSGI licences and thus development of value-added chains. Furthermore, development of geographic information infrastructures will also be stimulated. Similarly, the concept can be considered as a serious option within the Infrastructure of Spatial Information for Europe (INSPIRE), as a way towards transparent harmonised licences in Europe and beyond. ...|$|R

40|$|However, the {{sunflower}} seed production was not free {{of problems in}} the ´ 90 ies in Hungary; it is unquestionable, that this enterprise suffered the least, The transformation has affected the producers dramatically here, to; especially due to the privatisation of the background industry. After {{the bottom of the}} years 1992 and 1993, the {{sunflower seed}} production was more or less balanced, which lasted as long as the year 1997, when unfavourable weather and pest control problems occurred. Since that time, a continuous problem in profitability was experienced; and due to its effect on the industry, a harmonic balance typical for the middle of the century cannot have rebuilt, yet. The most serious problems are caused by the cumulative agritechnical lags. One main source of it is the shortage of capital; the other is the lack of sufficient knowledge. Therefore, the lack of necessary plant protection and fertilization,, own produced poor seeds instead of quality seeds are used. The lack of the knowledge {{can be explained by the}} too small size of the farms, thus e. g. a necessary crop rotation is not applied in many cases. The competitiveness of the enterprise can only recover more conditions of the production will change at he same time. Not only the yields should increase, but the agritechnical conditions should be improved. By the time of the EU accession, an average yield of 2. 0 to 2. 2 tons per hectare will have been necessary to reach in order to stay competitive and profitable with increasing input prices. Still before the EU accession and afterwards, much greater changes and conflicts are expected in the agriculture than in the industry. As these changes will start from the basis of the production, information should start to be given to the farmers and producers right now. Only this will help them understand and view the new system and the new conditions. One of the major challenges of the accession is to improve and <b>harmonise</b> the <b>conditions</b> of the agricultural production, not only in legal but economic terms, as well. This means that the Hungarian level should reach that of the EU in terms of producer prices, direct payments, and profitability and even in consumer prices and wages till the accession. After the troubles of the past years, the preparations for the EU accession raise the questions and tasks of modern management, complex development, quality production and competitiveness. According to the planned four to five years of lining up and technical modernisation, the double of the current annual payments and investments is needed. Along with the overall improvement of the economic conditions, the uncompetitive small farms, the shortage in income and source, which limits the quality and the volume of the production and the lack of the integration, which sets back the production, processing and trade can not be liveable any more...|$|R
40|$|PEMFC due {{to their}} high energy density, low {{operating}} temperature and high efficiency {{are considered to be}} very suitable for vehicle propulsion. In such applications, fuel cells could encounter operating conditions which are severe to the materials involved. Fuel cell testing shall as close as possible reflect conditions encountered in real life. To enable a fair comparative assessment of the performance of MEA under operating conditions foreseen in future automotive applications, a set of representative operating conditions in addition with a test methodology is proposed. The aim of a unified set of <b>harmonised</b> operating <b>conditions</b> is to comparatively test and evaluate the performance of different MEAs in single cells. The current document {{is the result of a}} cumulative effort of industry and research organisations participating in FCH-JU funded projects for automotive applications, in establishing a harmonised test protocol for assessing PEMFC performance and durability at a single cell level. This document presents a set of reference operating conditions such as temperature, pressure, humidification, gas flow and composition at the fuel and oxidant inlet representative for future automotive applications. It also defines boundaries of these conditions within which the cell is expected to operate. While not specifying single cell design details, cell operation in counter flow is mandatory for comparative assessment. A methodology is established to examining the relative influence that the individual operating parameters exert on the MEA performance in single cell configuration once the cell is subjected to the more challenging boundary conditions defined in this document which are also called as stressor conditions. In addition to operating conditions, the most likely stressor conditions for single cell testing could be identified as follows: Load cycling, Mechanical effects, Fuel Air contaminants (impurities), and Environmental Conditions. In this document the focus is on stressors related to Operating Conditions and Load Cycling. Deviations from the automotive reference Operating Conditions may result in changes to both cell performance and durability. In principle the influence of each stressor on cell performance could be studied individually. However, since a number of stressors are inter-linked, (changing the value of one stressor could inevitably change the value of another), the stressor tests have been grouped into four families of Stressors, namely: Cell Temperature Stressor Tests, Reactants Gas Inlet Humidification Stressor Tests, Reactants Gas Inlet Pressure Stressor Tests, Oxidant Stoichiometry Stressor Tests. The aim of these tests is to study the effect of each stressor on the the cell voltage at three different current densities representative of activation, ohmic polarization and mass transfer regimes as a function of each stressor condition. The successful operation of a fuel cell depends not only on its performance but also on its durability. Fuel cell durability is evaluated through endurance testing by applying a repetitive load profile to the cell and measuring performance degradation in terms of cell voltage decrease as function of operating hours. To assess the cell degradation rate a dynamic load cycle for endurance testing is proposed. The Fuel Cell Dynamic Load Cycle is used in this document and is derived from the New European Driving Cycle modified for fuel cell applications. In addition to the definition of representative reference and stressor operating conditions, the document also provides a rationale for their selection. The use of sound science-based, industry-endorsed test methodologies and protocols enables true comparison of MEAs originating from different sources either commercial or developed within different projects. It also enables evaluating the rate of progress achieved towards reaching agreed technology performance targets. JRC. F. 2 -Energy Conversion and Storage Technologie...|$|R
40|$|Salinisation of {{freshwater}} habitats {{is an issue}} with global implications that can have serious {{detrimental effects on the}} environment resulting in an overall loss in biodiversity. Whilst increases in salinity can occur naturally, such anthropogenic actions as the disposal of industrial and urban effluents and the disturbance of natural hydrological cycles can also result in the salinisation {{of freshwater}} habitats. The Water Framework Directive (WFD) requires Member States to restore all freshwater habitats to “good ecological status” and to prevent any further deterioration. Macro-invertebrates are widely used as indicators of river condition {{for a wide range of}} reasons and have been designated a key biological element in the assessment of aquatic habitats by the WFD. A review of the available literature, however, found no macro-invertebrate-based biotic indices have been developed for the detection and determination of salinity increases in freshwater habitats that are suitable for application in the United Kingdom for the purposes of the WFD. To this end, a biotic index based on the aquatic macro-invertebrate community response to changes in salinity, termed the Salinity Association Group (SAG) index, was developed. The potential of the SAG index for assessing water quality in terms of salinity in freshwater systems was investigated using data collected from survey sites in Lincolnshire and Norfolk, England, and the results compared to several published salinity indices. Whilst the SAG index was found to show both geographic and seasonal dependence, as is common among many biotic indices, the proposed metric exhibited a stronger relationship to salinity than macro-invertebrate indices employed in Europe for the purposes of the WFD show to their specific pressure. Furthermore, the SAG index was found to be highly selective to only salinity concentration, was significantly related to salinity when used with less detailed information and significantly discriminated between the salinity classes defined by the WFD. It is also highlighted that application of the SAG index with such predictive models as the River InVertebrate Prediction And Classification System (RIVPACS) can resolve the exhibited geographical and seasonal dependence. In a comparison of the SAG index with the published indices, it was found that the SAG index was the superior metric in terms of recognising abundance as required by the WFD, reliably indicating changes in salinity, compatibility with sampling protocols employed by England’s regulatory authority and producing a linear output. Consequently, it was concluded that the SAG index surpasses other published metrics for the detection and determination of salinity increases in freshwater habitats and is a viable biomonitoring tool suitable for use in England for informing aquatic habitat management decisions, research application and the purposes of the WFD. It is proposed, however, that more rigorous sampling protocols for both macro-invertebrate and environmental data may result in more accurate metric scores and reveal further issues or benefits associated with the SAG index and could also be used to further refine the metric. It is also suggested that adaptation and examination of the SAG index at a larger geographical scale would further demonstrate the validity of the proposed metric and illustrate the potential of the SAG index for worldwide application. Furthermore, intercalibration of the SAG index to <b>harmonise</b> WFD reference <b>conditions</b> and class boundaries across Europe would allow the application of the SAG index throughout Europe for the purpose of the WFD...|$|R
