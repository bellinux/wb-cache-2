5|$|The {{successful}} {{ending of}} the Vicksburg Campaign significantly degraded {{the ability of the}} Confederacy to maintain its war effort, as described in the Aftermath section of the campaign article. Some historians—e.g., Ballard, p.308—suggest that the decisive battle in the campaign was actually the Battle of Champion Hill, which, once won by Grant, made victory in the subsequent siege a foregone conclusion. This action (combined with the surrender of Port Hudson to Maj. Gen. Nathaniel P. Banks on July 9) yielded command of the Mississippi River to the Union forces, who would <b>hold</b> <b>it</b> <b>for</b> the rest of the conflict.|$|E

Her own troops {{were on the}} verge of mutiny. On 30 June, the Protestant Lords of the Congregation occupied Edinburgh, though they were able to <b>hold</b> <b>it</b> <b>for</b> only a month. But even before their arrival, the mob had already sacked the churches and the friaries. On 1 July, Knox preached from the pulpit of St Giles', the most influential in the capital. The Lords of the Congregation negotiated their withdrawal from Edinburgh by the Articles of Leith signed 25 July 1559, and Mary of Guise promised freedom of conscience.|$|E
5|$|Barrowclough {{rejoined the}} 6th Infantry Brigade in October 1940 and, {{disappointed}} with its quality, put considerable emphasis on training. This {{meant that it}} generally performed well during the campaign in Greece in April 1941. After {{the conclusion of the}} fighting in Greece, he refused to join in the criticism directed by some senior officers of the 2nd New Zealand Division at Freyberg's leadership during the battle. He later fought in Operation Crusader, the campaign to lift the Siege of Tobruk. At one point in the battle, his brigade captured elements of the headquarters of the Afrika Korps. However, he was impetuous in his efforts to capture Point 175, a strategically important hill to the south of Tobruk, and this led to heavy losses in one of the battalions of his brigade. Although Point 175 was seized, Barrowclough's brigade was only able to <b>hold</b> <b>it</b> <b>for</b> a few days before being forced to withdraw due to German attacks. He received a Bar to his DSO for his leadership during the Crusader offensive, having already been awarded the Greek War Cross and a mention in despatches for his work in Greece.|$|E

25|$|However, with Protestant {{reinforcements}} {{arriving from}} neighbouring counties, the queen regent retreated to Dunbar.

He also took Seville in 1234 {{with help from the}} Banu al-Bajji family, but he was only able to <b>hold</b> <b>it</b> <b>for</b> one month. Both Córdoba and Seville, unsatisfied by Ibn al-Ahmar's ruling style, returned to Ibn Hud's rule shortly after being taken by the Nasrids. After these failures, Ibn al-Ahmar once again declared his allegiance to Ibn Hud and kept his rule over Arjona, Jaén and Porcuna.|$|E
25|$|Belt press- This press {{utilizes}} {{a series}} of air-inflated pads along a wire mesh belt.

25|$|Originally {{conceived}} in April 1942 by Combined Operations Headquarters and code named Operation Rutter, the Allies planned {{to conduct a}} major division-sized raid on a German-held port on the French Channel coast and to <b>hold</b> <b>it</b> <b>for</b> the duration {{of at least two}} tides, and to destroy enemy facilities and defences before withdrawing. This plan was approved by the chiefs of staff in May 1942. It included British parachute units attacking German artillery batteries on the headlands {{on either side of the}} Canadians making a frontal assault from the sea. The parachute operation was later cancelled and instead No. 3 Commando and No. 4 Commando landed by sea and attacked the artillery batteries.|$|E

25|$|Stephen III was {{succeeded by}} {{increasingly}} weaker princes, and in 1538 Moldavia became a vassal of the Ottoman Empire, {{to which it}} owed {{a percentage of the}} internal revenue, that in time rose to 10%. Moldavia was forbidden to have foreign relations {{to the detriment of the}} Ottoman Empire (although at times the country managed to circumvent this interdiction), but was allowed internal autonomy, including sole authority over foreign trade. Turks were legally forbidden to own land or build religious establishments in Moldavia. Prince Vasile Lupu had secured the Moldavian throne in 1634 after a series of complicated intrigues, and managed to <b>hold</b> <b>it</b> <b>for</b> twenty years. Lupu was a capable administrator and a brilliant financier, and soon was the richest man in the Christian East. Judiciously placed gifts kept him on good terms with the Ottoman authorities.|$|E
25|$|Karl briefly {{worked in}} Phoenix {{and held the}} UWA Western States Tag Team Championship with Tito Montez, losing it to Chris Colt and one of Kurt Von Steiger's {{students}} Bobby Jaggers, who worked as Bobby Mayne at the time. After leaving the Phoenix Territory he started working in Dory Funk's NWA Western States territory based out of Amarillo, Texas. In 1972 Von Steiger teamed up with Ciclón Negro to win the NWA Western States Tag Team Championship, a title he would also hold in 1974, this time with Siegfried Stanke. Karl also won the NWA Western States Heavyweight Championship from Terry Funk and <b>hold</b> <b>it</b> <b>for</b> six months before losing it to Ricky Romero.

In 1974 Karl Von Steiger engaged in a prolonged storyline with future World Champion Bob Backlund centering on the Western States Heavyweight Championship. Von Steiger would win the title from Backlund on two occasions in 1974.|$|E

According to Major-General Urquhart, GOC of the British 1st Airborne Division, when informed that his airborne troops would have to hold the bridge for two days, Browning responded that they could <b>hold</b> <b>it</b> <b>for</b> four, but later claimed to Urquhart that he had added: [...] "But I think we might be going a bridge too far." ...|$|E

500|$|In March 1221, the Mongols {{returned}} to Azerbaijan and besieged Maragheh, using prisoners as the vanguard {{to take the}} brunt of each assault on the city.

500|$|The {{defiance}} of [...] the Poplar councillors generated widespread interest and sympathy, and the publicity embarrassed the government. Several other Labour-controlled councils (including Stepney whose mayor was the future Labour leader Clement Attlee) threatened [...] similar policies. After six weeks' incarceration the councillors were released, {{and a government}} conference was convened to resolve the matter. This conference brought a significant personal victory for Lansbury: {{the passage of the}} Local Authorities (Financial Provisions) Act, which equalised the poor relief burden across all the London boroughs.
