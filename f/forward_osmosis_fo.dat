50|$|Modern Water has {{developed}} a number of <b>Forward</b> <b>Osmosis</b> (<b>FO)</b> membrane processes including: desalination, evaporative cooling systems, enhanced oil recovery and hydro osmotic power (HOP).|$|E
5000|$|An {{additional}} {{distinction between}} the reverse osmosis (RO) and <b>forward</b> <b>osmosis</b> (<b>FO)</b> processes is that the permeate water resulting from an RO process is in most cases fresh water ready for use. In the FO process, {{this is not the}} case. The membrane separation of the FO process in effect results in a [...] "trade" [...] between the solutes of the feed solution and the draw solution. Depending on the concentration of solutes in the feed (which dictates the necessary concentration of solutes in the draw) and the intended use of the product of the FO process, this step may be all that is required.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Forward</b> <b>osmosis</b> (<b>FO)</b> is an osmotic process that, like {{reverse osmosis}} (RO), uses a {{semi-permeable}} membrane to effect separation {{of water from}} dissolved solutes. The driving force for this separation is an osmotic pressure gradient, such that a [...] "draw" [...] solution of high concentration (relative {{to that of the}} feed solution), is used to induce a net flow of water through the membrane into the draw solution, thus effectively separating the feed water from its solutes. In contrast, the reverse osmosis process uses hydraulic pressure as the driving force for separation, which serves to counteract the osmotic pressure gradient that would otherwise favor water flux from the permeate to the feed. Hence significantly more energy is required for reverse osmosis compared to forward osmosis.|$|E
40|$|Environmental and {{economic}} {{impacts of the}} fertilizer drawn <b>forward</b> <b>osmosis</b> (FDFO) and nanofiltration (NF) hybrid system were conducted and compared with conventional reverse osmosis (RO) hybrid scenarios using microfiltration (MF) or ultrafiltration (UF) as a pre-treatment process. The {{results showed that the}} FDFO-NF hybrid system using thin film composite <b>forward</b> <b>osmosis</b> (TFC) <b>FO</b> membrane has less environmental impact than conventional RO hybrid systems due to lower consumption of energy and cleaning chemicals. The energy requirement for the treatment of mine impaired water by the FDFO-NF hybrid system was 1. 08 kWh/m, which is 13. 6 % less energy than an MF-RO and 21 % less than UF-RO under similar initial feed solution. In a closed-loop system, the FDFO-NF hybrid system using a TFC FO membrane with an optimum NF recovery rate of 84 % had the lowest unit operating expenditure of AUD $ 0. 41 /m. Besides, given the current relatively high price and low flux performance of the cellulose triacetate and TFC FO membranes, the FDFO-NF hybrid system still holds opportunities to reduce operating expenditure further. Optimizing NF recovery rates and improving the water flux of the membrane would decrease the unit OPEX costs, although the TFC FO membrane would be less sensitive to this effect...|$|R
40|$|Microbial {{attachment}} and biofilm formation on filtration membrane can greatly compromise its flux and separation efficiency. Here, {{a simple and}} facile approach has been developed to in situ generate silver nanoparticles (Ag NPs) on the thin film composite <b>forward</b> <b>osmosis</b> (TFC <b>FO)</b> membrane for sustainable antibiofouling performances. Mussel-inspired dopamine chemistry was applied to grow polydopamine coating on both surfaces of FO membranes, followed by the generation of Ag NPs upon a simple dip coating in silver nitrate aqueous solution. Furthermore, the Ag NPs deposited membranes had a long-term silver release profile with rechargability for multiple times upon their depletion, and exhibited strong sustainable bactericidal efficacy against Gram-negative bacteria and Gram-positive bacteria. The Ag NPs had a controllable effect on the membrane performances including the water flux and reverse salt flux in the FO test mode. Our practicable antibacterial strategy may apply to other types of filtration membranes with diverse material surfaces and may pave {{a new way to}} achieve the sustainable membrane antibiofouling performance on a large scale...|$|R
50|$|One other {{application}} developed, {{where only}} the <b>forward</b> <b>osmosis</b> step is used, is in evaporative cooling make-up water. In {{this case the}} cooling water is the draw solution and the water lost by evaporation is simply replaced using water produced by <b>forward</b> <b>osmosis</b> from a suitable source, such as seawater, brackish water, treated sewage effluent or industrial waste water. Thus in comparison with other ‘desalination’ processes {{that may be used}} for make-up water the energy consumption is a fraction of these with the added advantage of the low fouling propensity of a <b>forward</b> <b>osmosis</b> process.|$|R

40|$|Although {{industrial}} osmotic {{processes are}} {{often referred to}} as ‘novel’, the possibility for osmotic power generation has been suggested as early as the 1970 s. Today <b>forward</b> <b>osmosis</b> is attracting significant interest and this interest has resulted in intensive research. <b>Forward</b> <b>osmosis</b> has been suggested as viable separation process, with numerous potential applications – from osmotic drug delivery and concentration of liquid foods to water purification and re-use in space. Particularly interesting is the possibility of seawater desalination by <b>forward</b> <b>osmosis,</b> as the process is claimed to require little or no pre-treatment of the feed water, due to minor membrane fouling. This alone is a significant advantage over reverse osmosis. Within the oil and gas sector, research conducted {{in the last couple of}} years shows that low salinity waterflooding can result in enhanced oil recovery, and therefore the industry is searching for new possibilities for off-shore based production of low salinity water. Due to the fact that <b>forward</b> <b>osmosis</b> operates at atmospheric pressure and requires no pressure vessels, the process can be utilized for seawater desalination where low overall equipment weight is required – off-shore oil platforms for example. This thesis is focused on the development of membranes for water desalination by <b>forward</b> <b>osmosis,</b> and estimation of the requirements (approximate membrane area and volume) for seawater desalination by a two-stage membrane based <b>forward</b> <b>osmosis</b> – nanofiltration process.

40|$|We {{provide a}} {{comparison}} of the theoretical and actual energy requirements of <b>forward</b> <b>osmosis</b> and reverse osmosis seawater desalination. We argue that reverse osmosis is significantly more energy efficient and that <b>forward</b> <b>osmosis</b> research efforts would best be fully oriented towards alternate applications. The underlying reason for the inefficiency of <b>forward</b> <b>osmosis</b> is the draw-dilution step, which increases the theoretical and actual energy requirements for draw regeneration. As a consequence, for a <b>forward</b> <b>osmosis</b> technology to compete with reverse osmosis, the regeneration process must be significantly more efficient than reverse osmosis. However, even considering the optimisation of the draw solution and the benefits of reduced fouling during regeneration, the efficiency of an optimal draw regeneration process and of reverse osmosis are unlikely to differ significantly, meaning the energy efficiency of direct desalination with reverse osmosis is likely to be superior...|$|R

40|$|A {{scheme to}} {{fabricate}} <b>forward</b> <b>osmosis</b> membranes comprising a highly porous sublayer sandwiched between two selective skin layers via phase inversion was proposed. One severe deficiency of existing composite and asymmetric membranes used in <b>forward</b> <b>osmosis</b> {{is the presence}} of unfavorable internal concentration polarization within the porous support layer that hinders both (i) separation (salt flux) and (ii) the performance (water flux). The double skin layers of the tailored membrane may mitigate the internal concentration polarization by preventing the salt and other solutes in the draw solution from penetrating into the membrane porous support. The prototype double-skinned cellulose acetate membrane displayed a water flux of 48. 2 L·m- 2 ·h - 1 and lower reverse salt transport of 6. 5 g·m - 2 ·h- 1 using 5. 0 M MgCl 2 as the draw solution in a <b>forward</b> <b>osmosis</b> process performed at 22 °C. This {{can be attributed to the}} effective salt rejection by the double skin layers and the low water transport resistance within the porous support layer. The prospects of utilizing the double-selective layer membranes may have potential application in <b>forward</b> <b>osmosis</b> for desalination.

40|$|Fundamental {{understanding}} of membrane fouling in osmosis-driven membrane processes {{is important for}} further deployment of this emerging technology in desalination and wastewater reuse. In this study, we investigated the role of pressure in organic fouling and reversibility in <b>forward</b> <b>osmosis</b> (<b>FO)</b> and reverse osmosis (RO) using alginate as a model organic foulant. Varying contributions of pressure (i. e., osmotic versus hydraulic) to the overall driving force were realized in <b>forward</b> <b>osmosis</b> (<b>FO),</b> pressure-assisted FO (PFO), and reverse osmosis (RO) experiments, while the same total driving force for water permeation was applied. Confocal laser scanning microscopy {{was used to examine}} alginate fouling layer structure in the hydrated state, which informed two key parameters: fouling layer thickness and foulant volume. We observed that the resulting fouling layer became increasingly more compact in the order of FO, PFO, and RO experiments. Fouling layer reversibility followed the same trend, with the highest and lowest reversibility observed for the FO and RO fouling experiments, respectively. Possible mechanisms for fouling layer compaction in RO were discussed, including permeate drag force and foulant compressibility, as opposed to FO where only permeate drag force applies. Our findings suggest that pressure mechanistically alters the membrane fouling layer structure and fouling reversibility, leading to higher fouling reversibility in FO, where the driving force is osmotic pressure, than RO, where the driving force is hydraulic pressure...|$|E
40|$|Forward Osmosis(FO) {{is one of}} the {{technologies}} that show a great performance in energy production and water supply. <b>Forward</b> <b>osmosis</b> is more preferred in both productions especially water supply because the purity of the water produce by <b>forward</b> <b>osmosis</b> technology is higher than other technology only by using low temperature,low pressure and low energy in the operation and also has low operating cost.

40|$|The {{membrane}} fouling propensity of natural seawater during <b>forward</b> <b>osmosis</b> was studied. Seawater from the Red Sea {{was used as}} the feed in a <b>forward</b> <b>osmosis</b> process while a 2. M sodium chloride solution {{was used as the}} draw solution. The process was conducted in a semi-batch mode under two crossflow velocities, 16. 7. cm/s and 4. 2. cm/s. For the first time reported, silica scaling was found to be the dominant inorganic fouling (scaling) on the surface of membrane active layer during seawater <b>forward</b> <b>osmosis.</b> Polymerization of dissolved silica was the major mechanism for the formation of silica scaling. After ten batches of seawater <b>forward</b> <b>osmosis,</b> the membrane surface was covered by a fouling layer of assorted polymerized silica clusters and natural organic matter, especially biopolymers. Moreover, the absorbed biopolymers also provided bacterial attachment sites. The accumulated organic fouling could be partially removed by water flushing while the polymerized silica was difficult to remove. The rate of flux decline was about 53 % with a crossflow velocity of 16. 7. cm/s while reaching more than 70 % with a crossflow velocity of 4. 2. cm/s. Both concentration polarization and fouling played roles in the decrease of flux. The salt rejection was stable at about 98 % during seawater <b>forward</b> <b>osmosis.</b> In addition, an almost complete rejection of natural organic matter was attained.

This research focuses on the synthesis and performances of polyamide <b>forward</b> <b>osmosis</b> membrane in order to provide the optimum effect in treating wastewater. This research also used sodium chloride as draw solution due to the highest performances recorded by previous researchers on <b>forward</b> <b>osmosis</b> experiment. This research was conducted based on one parameter which will impact the water flux and overall performances of <b>forward</b> <b>osmosis</b> which is the reaction time of polyamide membrane where, there are three different polyamide <b>forward</b> <b>osmosis</b> membranes with different reaction time with mphenylene diamine (MPD) and trimesoyl chloride (TMC). This research also measures the humic acid rejection for each polyamide <b>forward</b> <b>osmosis</b> membrane by using livVis spectrometer. Besides, reverse salt diffusion caused by different type of polyamide membrane was also tested in terms of conductivity to determine the best performing polyamide membrane. This research was conducted by using ultrafiltration membrane that reacted by twomonomers which are MPDand—TMC-with three different reaction times-(10 s,_ 3 Os, and 60 s) to separate the feed and draw solution and the permeation module was constructed as the preliminary laboratory work. Based on the results obtained,increase in molarity of draw solution is proportional to the increasing of water flux. In addition, the increasing of polyamide <b>forward</b> <b>osmosis</b> membrane reaction time with monomer also leads to decreasing of water flux. The water flux obtained by using related formula showed the highest results with polyamide membrane with reaction time of lOs at 2. 548 L/m 2 h at 2. 5 M of draw solution whereas the lowest water flux recorded by polyamide membrane with reaction time of 60 s at 1. 976 L/m 2 h at the same concentration of draw solution.
