40|$|Abstract: Theoretical {{models of}} soft budget {{constraints}} in a federation suggest a dynamic {{relationship between the}} spending and deficit patterns of lower levels of government on the one hand, and central government grant decisions on the other. Central governments may feel the obligation to increase <b>future</b> <b>discretionary</b> grants to profligate lower levels of government (even if they promise not to). This lowers the lower level government’s expected opportunity cost of spending and borrowing, and increases the incentive of lower-level governments to be profligate currently.

40|$|The {{research}} {{presented in}} this article provides evidence that add-on features sold to enhance a product can be more than just <b>discretionary</b> <b>benefits.</b> We argue that consumers draw inferences from the mere availability of add-ons, which in turn lead to significant changes in the perceived utility of the base good itself. Specifically, we propose that the improvements supplied by add-ons can be classified as either alignable or nonalignable and that they have opposing effects on evaluation. A set of four experiments with different product categories confirms this prediction. In addition, we show that the amount of product information available to consumers and expectations about product composition play important moderating roles. From a practical standpoint, these results highlight the need for firms to be mindful of the behavioral implications of making add-ons readily available in the marketplace.

Self-interested management has incentives to misallocate these funds {{in order to increase}} their control rents. There are two ways to impact <b>future</b> <b>discretionary</b> investment. First, using debt diverts funds to creditors and away from management. Second, having in place more assets that do not provide internal financing reduces the funds subject to managerial discretion.

As a result, firms borrow more and own proportionally more assets that provide internal funds as the average profitability of these assets, or that of future investment, increases.

This article contends that, however hard, nearly every constitutional question can be converted into an unconstitutional conditions question. One reason is that the frames of reference in 10 constitutional disputes are often arbitrary, and expanding the frame can turn a constitutional burden into a package deal with <b>discretionary</b> <b>benefits</b> supplied by the very same government. A related reason is more fundamental and inspirational: constitutional claimants are almost always allowed to exit the relevant institution and enter another.

Moreover, exit and sorting dynamics operate in contexts far beyond people physically migrating to new locations. The full implications of exit and sorting have been neglected by constitutional theorists, who tend to assume a static population within one political community or to focus on crude arguments about 20 “voting with your feet. ” This article is an initial effort to check these tendencies, and to move exit and sorting toward the center of constitutional law and theory. 1...|$|R

A change was also made ensuring that pensioners would not lose their extra benefits when a student turned twenty-one. The standard age pension rate was increased from 19.5% of average weekly earnings in September 1972 to 24.4% by December 1975.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this paper is to further {{investigate}} a previously researched positive relationship between the long-term debt ratio and growth opportunities in the U. S. lodging industry. Research by Smith and Watts (1992) and Barclay and Smith (1993) finds that firms with more growth opportunities will use less debt, favoring internal financing sources. In the hospitality sector, Dalbor and Upneja (2001) confirmed this relationship for the restaurant industry. However, as discussed by Gaver and Gaver (1993), <b>future</b> <b>discretionary</b> investments are not homogeneous. In fact, Wald (1999) finds a positive relationship between growth opportunities and the use of long-term debt for firms in the United Kingdom, France, Japan, and Germany. Moreover, Upneja and Dalbor (2001) find a similar relationship within the U. S. lodging industry. Accordingly, we attempt to address two major questions. For one, is the positive relationship between growth opportunities and long-term debt really true? Did Upneja and Dalbor (2001) make an error in measuring the growth opportunities variable? In this paper, we measure the presence of growth opportunities in a few different ways, perform some sensitivity tests, and hope to confirm that in the lodging sector firms with significant growth opportunities use more long-term debt. After confirming this relationship, we further hypothesize on the potential causes for this relationship. In other words, we attempt to discover why hotels borrow more in the presence of growth opportunities. This research could be used to reexamine the measurement of growth opportunities in the restaurant industry or assess the relationship between long-term debt and growth opportunities in the casino industry...|$|R

So-called destination rates constitute the fundamental element of these integration balances. The destination rates provide information about {{how many of the}} people who completed employment or training measures in a calendar year are no longer registered as unemployed six months after completing the measure.

If this is not the case there is a danger of special differences in the regional destination rates which are due to regional differences in the labour market situation being wrongly interpreted as policy effects. The objective of the present regional classification was to identify comparable employment office areas in this sense. With the aid of the cluster analysis and on the basis of six regional indicators - among other things the underemployment rate in the annual average for 1997, the duration of unemployment in 1997, the recruitment rate for the period July 1996 to June 1997 and the employment trend in the same period - the 141 employment office areas of western Germany and Berlin as well as the 34 eastern German employment office areas were combined into 9 and 3 regional clusters respectively.

40|$|Background: Trusts {{have long}} been used as an estate {{planning}} mechanism, including the avoidance of estate duty and donations tax. In the 2016 National Budget the Minister of Finance indicated that Government was proposing several legislative measures during 2016 / 2017 to prevent individuals from using a trust to avoid estate duty (and donations tax to a certain extent). Unexpectedly, the 2016 draft Taxation Laws Amendment Bill and the final Amendment Bill did not give effect {{to any of these}} proposals, but introduced other less drastic measures to control the abuse of trusts for tax purposes, albeit with the same stated purpose. Aim: The main aim {{of the study was to}} clarify the reform proposals (albeit unclear and consequently based on certain assumptions) and to compare the reform proposals with the final amendments. This comparison will shed some light on the fairness and appropriateness of the final amendments and, more importantly, on the possibility that the reform proposals published by National Treasury in February 2016 not included in the final amendments will be enacted in the future. This investigation will assist tax practitioners and taxpayers in effective tax and estate planning, given that the reform proposals and final amendments have a possible impact on the <b>future</b> of <b>discretionary</b> trusts in South Africa. Setting: This article examines existing literature in a South African income tax environment. Methods: In order to meet this objective a qualitative approach based on a literature study of pure theoretical aspects was used.

40|$|On {{the basis}} of the European System of Integrated Social Protection Statistics (ESSPROS), {{developed}} by the Statistical Office of the European Community, social expenditure for all EU-countries have been newly recorded on a standardized base, thereby enabling meaningful comparative analysis. According to this new system, Austrian social expenditure in 1995 totaled ATS 694 billion, equivalent to 29. 5 percent of GDP. Since 1980, current social protection expenditure rose by 157 percent and as a ratio of GDP by 2 ½ percentage points. During the 1980 's, changes in the social outlays/GDP ratio were dominated by cyclical variations: it rose over the period of sluggish growth until 1987, but fell back with the subsequent recovery – eventually even below the 1980 level. In the early 1990 's however, it ratcheted upwards, due to a number of <b>discretionary</b> raises in <b>benefits</b> such as an extension of paid maternity leave higher pension entitlements for women, family tax credits and nursing care benefits. In 1995, the rise in the social expenditure/GDP ratio leveled off, despite a cyclical weakening accompanied by a rise in unemployment. Also in 1996, the ratio may have remained flat in view of measures to cut the government deficit. Since 1980, the expenditure components showing the strongest increase are unemployment benefits (+ 660 percent rise) and invalidity pensions (+ 225 percent). Old-age pension outlays (+ 175 percent) also expanded above-average because of <b>discretionary</b> <b>benefit</b> increases and the system maturing (with new retires having acquired progressively longer entitlement periods). The relative importance of social expenditure in Austria is similar to that in other European countries with comparable economic and social structure. As a proportion of GDP, it is slightly above the EU-average for 1994, which is dampened by the absence of Sweden (prior to accession) and the very low level of social spending in the southern European countries. For the EU as a whole, the ratio has moved up by 4 ¼ percentage points since 1980; apart from a catching-up effect in southern Europe, strong advances in the U. K. (+ 6 percentage points), Denmark and France (+ 5 points each) have contributed to this development. The structural composition of social outlays in Austria differs markedly from the EU-average insofar, as old-age pensions (Austria 49 percent, EU 44 percent) and family subsidies (11 versus 8 percent) claim a much larger share, whereas the share of spending on unemployment benefits (6 against 9 percent) as well as on sickness and invalidity payments (33 versus 35 percent) is distinctly lower in Austria than on the average of EU countries.

30|$|Automatic {{stabilizers}} {{have the}} major advantage of providing income replacement immediately, i.e. when unemployment starts {{to rise and}} incomes fall. While means-tested income support is generally available as a basic social security net in most EU Member States, unemployment insurance systems are more exclusive as they do not protect all types of workers equally. As the extent of unemployment risks and the ‘quality’ of social protection provided to different socio-economic groups does not coincide, one can argue that in general those most affected are the least protected. Here, a <b>discretionary</b> expansion of <b>benefit</b> generosity or easing access to benefits can play a substantial role in reaction to crises. However, <b>discretionary</b> changes to <b>benefit</b> systems or {{the creation of new}} benefits may take some time and may be more difficult to administer and deliver, in particular if new groups are to be integrated or new benefits created – or if fiscal restrictions are considered.

40|$|Post 1997, the New Labour {{administration}} {{wanted to}} foster innovation in local government to reduce bureaucracy and modernise {{the public sector}} - part of the Local Government Modernisation Agenda (LGMA). One keystone of that agenda was to introduce a power of first resort for local government (DCLG, 2008). Authorities could regard this power as a license to offer creative and innovative solutions to local problems, to engage in any function that did not break the law. New Labour’s new discretionary power was called the Power of Well-Being. Despite central government’s aspiration, evidence shows that less than a fifth of local authorities have used the Power of Well-Being. This thesis provides a comparative investigation across four local authorities into {{their use of the}} Power of Well-Being. The aim of this research is {{to assess the impact of}} the Power of Well-Being on local authorities’ autonomy, their attitudes towards discretionary power and local authority officers’ attitudes towards risk. From the four case study authorities, it was clear that the attitude of senior officers - and the culture of an organisation - was the greatest determinant of whether to engage the Power of Well-Being. The research found that the role of legal officers and the attitude of senior officers or members is crucial in the successful engagement of discretionary legal power. In local authority’s that are devoid of cultural ambition within the organisation, risk averse legal officers acted as ‘gatekeepers’ to block usage of the Power of Well-Being. Where an organisational culture of ambition does not exist, the withdrawal of discretionary funding tends to limit the level of engagement in discretionary activity. However, where stability occurs there is a greater likelihood of discretionary activity. The implication of this research on a <b>future</b> <b>discretionary</b> power, and local government’s autonomy, is that the most significant hindrance to the success of a discretionary power would be officers’ and members’ attitudes. The Power of Well-Being technically enabled authorities to break from tradition to engage beyond their traditional boundaries; in practise, this was not the case. Successful engagement in discretionary activity would require officers and members to be fully aware of the practicalities of use of a discretionary power...|$|R

Hierbei wird der CDM theoretisch in den Kontext der Kapitalisierung des ökologischen Raumes und in die postfordistischen Naturverhältnisse eingebettet. Ein historischer Abriss verdeutlicht die Naturvergessenheit der ökonomischen Modelle und liefert den Unterbau, um den Prozess der Inwertsetzung der Atmosphäre kritisch zu analysieren. Das Konzept der langfristigen Lebensgrundlagen wird mittels der Social Carbon Methodology aufgegriffen, um die drei Dimensionen der achhaltigen Entwicklung differenziert erfassen zu können. Der empirische Teil der Arbeit kommt anhand von vier Fallstudien zum Schluss, dass der CDM für Brasilien im Beschreiten eines nachhaltigen Entwicklungsweges von Nutzem ist. Gleichzeitig wird jedoch bemängelt, dass die soziale Integrität des Mechanismus nicht von der institutionellen Struktur auf der brasilianischen und internationalen Ebene gewährleistet ist. Es besteht daher keine Garantie, dass die intrinsischen und zusätzlichen Beiträge des CDM eine verbesserte Lebensqualität für die lokale Bevölkerung herbeiführen. Folglich werden mehr Partizipation, eine regelmäßige Evaluierung der langfristigen Lebensgrundlagen der lokalen Interessensgruppen und eine Abgabe aus den Emissionsreduktionseinheiten (CER) des CDM gefordert. Erst hierdurch könnte sicher gestellt werden, dass es sich beim CDM um ein Instrument der Klimagerechtigkeit handelt. The present work merges {{the results}} of a one-year {{research}} project that examines whether the Kyoto’s Clean Development Mechanism (CDM) is meeting its goal of furthering sustainable development. As a theoretical basis for analysis, the CDM is contextualised within debates about the commercialization of ecological spaces and the post-fordistic social relations with nature. A historical re-assessment sheds light on the failure of economic models to take nature into account, thereby laying the foundation for a critique of how the natural atmosphere is valuated. In order to define and differentiate the dimensions of sustainable development the concept of sustained livelihoods is introduced and analyses through the Social Carbon Methodology. To apply these theoretical approaches to empirical evidence, the paper presents the findings of four case studies carried out in Brazil. The primary thesis is, although the CDM has helped Brazil in its pursuit of sustainable development, there is no institutional structure at the national or international level to safeguard the social integrity of the mechanism. Consequently, {{there is no guarantee that}} the intrinsic and <b>discretionary</b> <b>benefits</b> of the CDM will improve the quality of life of local populations in Brazil. As a normative demand, the paper thus concludes that increased participation by various local actors, regular evaluation of the sustained livelihoods of local stakeholders, and a contribution from the Certified Emission Reduction (CER) which deliver benefits to local groups should be defined as prerequisites for implementing CDM projects in Brazil. Only if these norms are met can the CDM function as a just and equitable tool in the fight against global warming...|$|R

However, we find that labor unionization is associated with higher audit fees and higher likelihood of goingconcern qualifications but shorter audit report lags. Because the auditor’s response seems to be unrelated to inherent earnings quality differences, these findings support the contention that the auditors mitigate the higher litigation risk in unionized firms by giving more going concern qualifications (thereby deflecting the legal threat away) and by charging higher audit fees to compensate for the additional risk...|$|R
