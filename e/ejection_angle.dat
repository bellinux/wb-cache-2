High-speed imaging, three-dimensional time-resolved particle tracking, and photogrammetric surface proﬁling have been used to examine individual impact events. The focus of the study is the quantiﬁcation and trajectory analysis of the particles ejected from the sand bed, along with measurement of the change in bed morphology. The results from the experiments have detailed two distinct mechanisms of particle ejection: the ejection of water-encapsulated particles {{from the edge of the}} wetted region and the ejection of dry sand from the periphery of the impact crater. That the process occurs by these two distinct mechanisms has hitherto been unobserved.

Disintegrated particles of natural compact snow were used. Trajectories of snow particles were illuminated with a laser sheet cut with a rotary shutter and were recorded with a video camera system. Both average impact and ejection velocities increased with the friction velocity. However, average impact and <b>ejection</b> <b>angles</b> decreased. Standard deviations of the <b>ejection</b> <b>angles</b> were larger {{than those of the}} impact angles. Average horizontal components of both the impact and ejection velocities increased with the friction velocity, while average vertical components did not change much.

The ratio of the average ejection velocity to the average impact velocity, that is the restitution coefficient, increased with the friction velocity. The vertical restitution coefficient ranged from 1. 5 to 2. 3,showing the increase of vertical ejection velocity at each impact.

The mean <b>ejection</b> <b>angle</b> for the randomly packed bed is consistent with previous experimental results. The FCC-structured bed yields a larger mean ejection angle; however, the latter result has not been confirmed experimentally. Furthermore, the <b>ejection</b> <b>angle</b> distributions and the vertical ejection speeds for individual grains vary depending on the relative timing at which the grains are ejected after the initial impact. Obvious differences are observed between the distributions of grains ejected during the earlier and later splash periods: the form of the vertical ejection speed distribution varies from a power-law form to a lognormal form with time, and more than 80 % of the kinetic energy of all ejected grains is used for earlier ejected grains.

30|$|Fragments {{launched}} {{during the}} early spallation process are the sources that formed self-secondaries on the Moon, Mercury and Mars (Xiao et al. 2016). Schenk et al. (2017) suggested that jetting {{during the early}} phase of the cratering process might have formed the self-secondaries on Rhea, but jetting occurs with low <b>ejection</b> <b>angles</b> {{and most of the}} jetted materials are melted (Kurosawa et al. 2015). Excavation flow is the major mechanism in the formation of continuous ejecta deposits, but excavation flows have gradually decreased velocities with larger launch distances from the impact site (e.g., Houson and Holsapple 2011), and laboratory oblique impact experiments show that <b>ejection</b> <b>angles</b> during the excavation stage vary by less than ~[*] 15 ° (~[*] 35 °– 50 °; Anderson et al. 2003). Therefore, larger trajectory time in excavation flows generally means larger ejection velocity, thus longer ballistic ranges. The later arrival of self-secondaries on top of continuous ejecta deposits indicate that self-secondaries cannot be launched by excavation flows. Accounting for the possible movement time of melt flows, on top of which self-secondaries are recognized (e.g., the Hokusai case), the trajectory time of fragments that formed self-secondaries are much larger than the combined time of crater excavation and modification (Xiao et al. 2016). The long trajectory time and the short trajectory distance requires that the ejecta that formed self-secondaries were launched early in the cratering process with both large <b>ejection</b> <b>angles</b> (up to 85 ° regarding the target surface) and velocities (up to the escape velocity). Spallation provides the most probable explanation for these requirements, because fragments ejected during the early spallation stage have ejection velocities approaching the impact velocity that formed the parent crater (Melosh 1984), and near-vertical launch angles (Polanskey and Ahrens 1990). The observed self-secondary crater populations on the Moon, Mars and Mercury are mostly less than ~[*] 300  m in diameter, much smaller than secondaries on the continuous secondaries facies. This is consistent with the fact that spall fragments ejected early during the cratering process have large velocities but small sizes due to the thinner interference zone and larger residual elastic energies (Melosh 1985). Moreover, the large <b>ejection</b> <b>angles</b> of fragments that form self-secondaries can explain their circular morphology and scattered spatial distribution (Schultz and Gault 1985). Notably, buried detonations of nuclear and large chemical explosions are analogues of impact cratering, and abundant self-secondaries are also formed on the ejecta blanket of the Sedan crater (390  m diameter; 104  kT TNT; Carlson and Roberts 1963). Surface materials launched by spallation may be the source of Sedan’s self-secondaries. However, gas expansion plays a fundamental role during the growth of explosion craters, so whether or not self-secondaries formed by detonations could be analog to those formed by impact cratering is questionable (van der Bogert et al. 2017).|$|R

This paper also critically evaluated the current knowledge on the kinetics of decarburization reaction in the emulsion phase and discussed the repercussions of the new model for industrial practices.

It was found that the residence time of droplets as well as decarburization reaction rate via emulsified droplets was strong function of bloating behavior of metal droplets in the emulsion phase. The estimated residence times of the metal droplets in the emulsion were between 0. 4 to 45 s throughout the blow.

The focus of the study is the quantification and trajectory analysis of the particles ejected from the sand bed, along with measurement of the change in bed morphology. The results from the experiments have detailed two distinct mechanisms of particle ejection: the ejection of water-encapsulated particles {{from the edge of the}} wetted region and the ejection of dry sand from the periphery of the impact crater. That the process occurs by these two distinct mechanisms has hitherto been unobserved.

It seem entirely possible that most ejecta facies could be produced without the presence of liquid water. However, the combination of extraordinary ejecta fluidity, absence of secondaries, and high <b>ejection</b> <b>angles</b> all would point to the combined effects of atmosphere and fluid rich substrates. Moreover, recent experiments revealing the broad scour zone associated with rapid vapor expansion may account for numerous craters in the circum-polar regions with subtle radial grooving extending 10 crater radii away with faint distal ramparts. Thus certain crater ejecta morphologies may yet provide fundamental clues {{for the presence of}} unbound water...|$|R
