Its large subsystems size sum up {{to around}} 6 million Detector Control System (DCS) channels to be supervised. A cluster of ~ 100 servers is needed to provide the required processing resources. To cope with such a size a scalable approach has been chosen factorizing the DCS system as much as possible. CMS DCS has made a clear division between its computing resources and functionality by creating a computing framework allowing for plugging in functional components. DCS components are developed by the subsystems expert groups while the computing infrastructure is developed centrally. To ease the component development task, a framework based on PVSSII [1] has been developed by the CERN <b>Joint</b> <b>Controls</b> Project [2] (JCOP).

40|$|Phosphorus and {{nitrogen}} cause algal blooms that decrease water quality of lakes, rivers and coastal ecosystems. Although phosphorus control has frequently been implemented to reduce eutrophication, several lines of evidence indicate that nitrogen {{also needs to}} be controlled in some situations. Whole-lake experiments, and a correlation analysis of N, P, and chlorophyll in 1268 US lakes all indicate that nitrogen and phosphorus together produce larger algal blooms than do addition of each nutrient alone. Nitrogen fixation by cyanobacteria may alleviate nitrogen deficiencies in some cases, but ecological constraints on this process, coupled with high levels of denitrification, can lead to co-limitation by both nutrients. Although a phosphorus-only explanation for algal blooms has persisted for decades, this misinterpretation has impeded efforts to understand how nitrogen and phosphorus can both influence algal communities. Nutrient controls at watershed scales are further complicated because controlling only one nutrient in upstream areas results in export of the other damaging nutrient downstream to coastal areas. Additional research is needed to understand when and where <b>joint</b> <b>controls</b> are necessary to control eutrophication...|$|E

The <b>Joint</b> <b>COntrols</b> Project (JCOP) [1] has been set-up as a collaboration between CERN and the four LHC experiments to find common solutions for the LHC experiments' control systems. Although the JCOP general principle is to promote the use of industrial solutions wherever possible, custom solutions are still required when non-standard devices or very large numbers of devices have to be controlled. Furthermore, to ease the {{development and}} integration of both standard and non-standard devices into the control system a number of software Frameworks are under development.

PVSSII is a commercial SCADA system and the JCOP framework is an in-house software project of CERN.

The JCOP framework contains a Finite State Machine (FSM) toolkit. Sub-detector and service experts use this toolkit to build control trees based on FSMs. CMS has put policies into place to ensure a homogeneous and coherent use of its DCS.

40|$|Tropospheric ozone (O 3) {{and fine}} {{particles}} (PM 2. 5) come from {{both local and}} regional emissions sources. Due to the nonlinearity in the response of O 3 and PM 2. 5 to their precursors, contributions from multiregional sources are challenging to quantify. Here we developed an updated extended response surface modeling technique (ERSMv 2. 0) to address this challenge. Multiregional contributions were estimated as the sum of three components: (1) the impacts of local chemistry on {{the formation of the}} pollutant associated with the change in its precursor levels at the receptor region; (2) regional transport of the pollutant from the source region to the receptor region; and (3) interregional effects among multiple regions, representing the impacts on the contribution from one source region by other source regions. Three components were quantified individually in the case study of Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei using the ERSMv 2. 0 model. For PM 2. 5 in most cases, the contribution from local chemistry (i. e., component 1) is greater than the contribution from regional transport (i. e., component 2). However, regional transport is more important for O 3. For both O 3 and PM 2. 5, the contribution from regional sources increases during high-pollution episodes, suggesting the importance of <b>joint</b> <b>controls</b> on regional sources for reducing the heavy air pollution...|$|E
40|$|The {{aim of the}} LHCb {{configuration}} database is {{to store}} information about all the controllable devices of the detector. The experiment's control system (that uses PVSS) will configure, start up and monitor the detector from {{the information in the}} configuration database. The database will contain devices with their properties, connectivity and hierarchy. The ability to store and rapidly retrieve huge amounts of data, and the navigability between devices are important requirements. We have collected use cases to ensure the completeness of the design. Using the entity relationship modelling technique we describe the use cases as classes with attributes and links. We designed the schema for the tables using relational diagrams. This methodology has been applied to the TFC (switches) and DAQ system. Other parts of the detector will follow later. The database has been implemented using Oracle to benefit from central CERN database support. The project also foresees the creation of tools to populate, maintain, and configure the configuration database.
