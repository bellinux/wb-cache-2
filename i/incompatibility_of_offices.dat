5000|$|The {{rebellion}} of Lwów (the so-called Chicken War) was an anti-royalist and anti-absolutist rokosz (rebellion) by the Polish nobility {{that occurred}} in 1537. The derisive name was coined by the magnates, who {{for the most part}} supported the King and claimed that the [...] "war's" [...] only effect was the near-extinction of the local chickens, eaten by the nobles gathered for the rebellion at Lwów, in Lesser Poland. The nobility, gathered near the city to meet with a levée en masse, called for a military campaign against Moldavia. However, the lesser and middle strata of the nobility called a rebellion, or semi-legal rebellion, to force the King to abandon his risky reforms. The nobles presented him with 36 demands, most notably: a cessation of further land acquisitions by Queen Bona, exemption of the nobility from the tithes, a clean-up of the Treasury rather than its expansion, confirmation and extension of the privileges of the nobility, lifting of the toll or exemption of the nobility from it, adoption of a law concerning incompatibilitas — the <b>incompatibility</b> <b>of</b> certain <b>offices</b> that were not to be joined in the same hand, the carrying out of a law requiring the appointment of only the local nobles to most important local offices {{and the creation of a}} body of permanent advisors to the king. Finally, the protesters criticised the role of Queen Bona, whom they blamed for the [...] "bad education" [...] of young Prince Sigismund Augustus (the future King Sigismund II Augustus), as well as for seeking to increase her power and influence in the state.|$|R

40|$|Phase {{diagrams}} of aqueous whey protein (WP) and polysaccharide (PS) mixtures, including carboxymethylcellulose (CMC), k-carrageenan (C) and {{locust bean}} gum (LG) are {{presented in this paper}} at pH from 5. 0 to 7. 0 with 0. 1 to 0. 5 M NaCl. Thermodynamic <b>incompatibility</b> <b>of</b> WP-CMC, WP-LG and WP-C systems increased as pH was close to the isoelectric point of WP (pI= 5. 2). Increasing salt concentration (0. 1 to 0. 5 M) increased the <b>incompatibility</b> <b>of</b> WP-LG and WP-CMC systems. However, the effect of NaCl on thermodynamic <b>incompatibility</b> <b>of</b> WP-C was the opposite, i. e. increasing salt concentration decreased the thermodynamic <b>incompatibility</b> <b>of</b> the system. The type of the polysaccharides was the critical factor, which affected the compatibility of WP-PS systems. The thermodynamic compatibility of WP-PS systems decreased in the following order: locust gum ≯ carboxymethylcellulose ≯ k-carrageenan. ...|$|R

40|$|We {{propose a}} class <b>of</b> <b>incompatibility</b> {{measures}} for quantum observables based on quantifying {{the effect of}} a measurement of one observable on the statistics of the outcomes of another. Specifically, for a pair of observables A and B with purely discrete spectra, we compare the following two probability distributions: one resulting from a measurement of A followed by a measurement of B on a given state, and the other obtained from a measurement of B alone on the same state. We show that maximizing the distance between these two distributions over all states yields a valid measure <b>of</b> the <b>incompatibility</b> <b>of</b> observables A and B, which is zero if and only if they commute and is strictly greater than zero (and {{less than or equal to}} one) otherwise. For finite dimensional systems, we obtain a tight upper bound on the <b>incompatibility</b> <b>of</b> any pair of observables and show that the bound is attained when the observables are totally non-degenerate and associated with mutually unbiased bases. In the process, we also establish an important connection between the <b>incompatibility</b> <b>of</b> a pair of observables and the maximal disturbances due to their measurements. Finally, we indicate how these measures <b>of</b> <b>incompatibility</b> and disturbance can be extended to the more general class of non-projective measurements. In particular, we obtain a non-trivial upper bound on the <b>incompatibility</b> <b>of</b> one Lüders instrument with another. Comment: 11 pages; close to published version; typos fixe...|$|R

However, E. Gary Smith, the eldest son of the final patriarch, Eldred G.

[...] Until that time, the role and duties <b>of</b> the <b>office</b> had varied.
