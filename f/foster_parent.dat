40|$|In this {{qualitative}} {{exploratory study}} {{the perspectives of}} <b>foster</b> <b>parents</b> in an eastern Canadian province, who had {{at least five years}} of fostering experience, were explored through structured open-ended telephone interviews. The interview questions were organized around seven main areas based on the personal experiences as <b>foster</b> <b>parents</b> which were: the misconceptions they encountered, their motivation and the reasons they continue to foster, the joys, as well as the barriers and challenges these <b>foster</b> <b>parents</b> faced, and what advice <b>foster</b> <b>parents</b> would offer future <b>foster</b> <b>parents.</b> Four themes emerged through the data analysis: misunderstood intent, joyful satisfaction, unrealistic expectations, and missing pieces. The emergent theoretical model "gentle iron will" reflects the feelings associated with the obligation resulting from the commitment <b>foster</b> <b>parents</b> made to themselves and the children in their care. This study supports much of the literature on the experiences of <b>foster</b> <b>parents</b> because the participants' responses are reflected in the existing body of literature. <b>Foster</b> care <b>Foster</b> <b>parents</b> Motivation Child welfare...|$|R

40|$|Thesis (M Social WOrk (Social Work) [...] University of Stellenbosch, 2007. This {{research}} {{provides an}} overview of foster care and investigates the support and training of <b>foster</b> <b>parents</b> as well as the issues <b>foster</b> <b>parents</b> need to manage on a regular basis. The basic premise for this research is the importance of social workers becoming aware of the issues <b>foster</b> <b>parents</b> manage on a regular basis as well as the support and training needs of <b>foster</b> <b>parents.</b> It is important for <b>foster</b> <b>parents</b> to receive support as well as social workers and family care organisations to develop and implement appropriate training programmes for <b>foster</b> <b>parents</b> on an ongoing basis. Fostering affects and requires the involvement of the entire foster family as well as relevant role players and professionals. It is therefore necessary to consider the <b>foster</b> <b>parents</b> and <b>foster</b> family as part of the larger fostering arena, and not to be supported and trained in isolation. The nature of the foster placement will inevitably influence the development of the foster child, meeting the needs of the foster child as well as the effect that the placement has on the foster family. The purpose of this research is to broaden the theoretical knowledge of professionals working with <b>foster</b> <b>parents,</b> and specifically social workers and family care organisations, in identifying <b>foster</b> <b>parent’s</b> training and support needs. This research report includes an investigation of the issues <b>foster</b> <b>parents</b> and <b>foster</b> families manage on a regular basis as well as the nature of and benefits of support and training for <b>foster</b> <b>parents.</b> Knowledge of these issues <b>foster</b> <b>parents</b> manage while <b>fostering</b> will increase the awareness and the ability of the social worker or other professionals to provide training and support to the relevant <b>foster</b> <b>parents...</b>|$|R

40|$|With this {{research}} {{we aim to}} examine <b>foster</b> <b>parents</b> and social workers perceptions {{about the relationship between}} <b>foster</b> <b>parents</b> and the <b>foster</b> child’s biological <b>parents</b> and their perceptions about the support to the <b>foster</b> <b>parents</b> in the contact with the child’s biological parents. The research will provide {{a deeper understanding of the}} actors’ perceptions and explain possible differences in their opinions. This study has a qualitative approach and contains eight semi-structured interviews with <b>foster</b> <b>parents</b> and social workers in a smaller town in the south of Sweden. Seven <b>foster</b> <b>parents</b> from four <b>foster</b> homes and four social workers were interviewed. As analytical method we have used a qualitative thematic analysis and then the results have been analyzed by the theoretical approach of street-level bureaucracy and its discretion. Theories regarding the relationship between clients and social workers have also been used.   The result demonstrates that social workers perceptions of the relationship between <b>foster</b> <b>parents</b> and the <b>foster</b> child’s biological <b>parents</b> are that the relationship should be remained because the interaction between them is necessary for the child. Concerning possible conflicts that may appear, between <b>foster</b> <b>parents</b> and the child’s biological parents, social workers see as solvable. <b>Foster</b> <b>parents</b> on the other hand emphasize the difficulties in their relationship with the <b>foster</b> child’s biological <b>parents.</b> They also think that they have no exchange of having contact with the child’s biological parents but say that they still have it for the child’s sake. Regarding the support provided to the <b>foster</b> <b>parents</b> in their relationship with the child’s biological <b>parents,</b> the <b>foster</b> <b>parents</b> states that they need a close relationship to the social worker to feel supported. However they argue that a frequent change of social workers prevents them from being able to have a close relationship with their social worker. Social workers say that the support to the <b>foster</b> <b>parents</b> is limited by time constraints and high workload. Instead they underline the importance of providing training as a part of the support to the <b>foster</b> <b>parents</b> in their relationship with the child’s biological parents. ...|$|R

25|$|Several {{lawsuits}} {{were brought}} in 2008 against the Florida Department of Children & Families (DCF), accusing it of mishandling reports that Thomas Ferrara, 79, a <b>foster</b> <b>parent,</b> was molesting young girls. The suits claimed that {{even though there were}} records of sexual misconduct allegations against Ferrara in 1992, 1996, and 1999, the DCF continued to place foster children with Ferrara and his then-wife until 2000. Ferrara was arrested in 2001, after a 9-year-old girl told detectives he regularly molested her over two years and threatened to hurt her mother if she told anyone. Records show that Ferrara had as many as 400 children go through his home during his 16 years as a licensed <b>foster</b> <b>parent</b> (from 1984 to 2000). Officials stated that the lawsuits over Ferrara ended up costing the DCF almost $2.26 million. Similarly, in 2007 Florida's DCF paid $1.2 million to settle a lawsuit that alleged DCF ignored complaints that another mentally disabled Immokalee girl was being raped by her foster father, Bonifacio Velazquez, until the 15-year-old gave birth to a child.|$|E

Russ Rymer contended that the roles of everyone involved in Genie's life became progressively clear, citing the starting point as the appointment of John Miner as legal counsel for Genie's mother, and that personal friendships prevented them from recognizing it. He argued that this interfered with providing Genie the best possible care and compromised their objectivity, which in turn contributed to the case study's lack of coherence, and both he and Harlan Lane emphasized that making David Rigler a <b>foster</b> <b>parent</b> accelerated this breakdown. Several independent reviews of Genie's case also accused the Riglers and the other scientists of abandoning Genie after the case study concluded.|$|E

40|$|A {{review of}} child welfare {{literature}} suggested that <b>foster</b> <b>parents</b> tend to manifest authoritarian child-rearing attitudes, resulting in foster children {{being exposed to}} inadequate parenting. A concurrent review of research literature related to families and socialization theory found that authoritarian child-rearing attitudes do have {{detrimental effects on the}} socialization of the child. It was thought that, if Newfoundland <b>foster</b> <b>parents</b> were similar to <b>foster</b> <b>parents</b> in the child welfare studies reviewed, they would reflect authoritarian child-rearing attitudes which would be related to their parenting adequacy. [...] Methodology provided for the examination of the child-rearing attitudes of a population of <b>foster</b> <b>parents</b> serviced by a local child welfare agency. The <b>foster</b> <b>parents</b> were divided in two groups by child care social workers at the agency. They rated one group as more adequate, and the other as less adequate. Instruments used to examine their child-rearing attitudes consisted of six scales selected from the Parental Attitude Research Instruments [...] Mother Form and Father Form. The foster parents' demographic characteristics were examined. All respondents were personally interviewed. [...] Descriptive measures were used to observe for differences between the more and less adequate <b>foster</b> <b>parents</b> in the study group. Data analysis revealed that <b>foster</b> <b>parents</b> in the study group did have demographic characteristics somewhat similar to those of <b>foster</b> <b>parents</b> studied in other countries. Differences between mean scores obtained for more adequate and less adequate <b>foster</b> <b>parents</b> on the attitude scales were minimal. Possible explanation {{lies in the fact that}} more adequate and less adequate foster mothers displayed marginal differences between means on both restrictive and permissive scales. Also, more adequate foster fathers tended to be less permissive on some scales than did the less adequate foster fathers. [...] When examined as subgroups, foster mothers and foster fathers who were rated by agency social workers as being less adequate did show a tendency to be more authoritarian in their child-rearing attitudes than the more adequate foster mother and father subgroups. Overall, less adequate <b>foster</b> <b>parents</b> scored in the direction of being more authoritarian than more adequate <b>foster</b> <b>parents,</b> when taking into consideration the former's scores as subgroups. [...] A final observation is that agency social workers did prove capable in rating the adequacy of <b>foster</b> <b>parents</b> in their caseloads. Their judgement was upheld in that the less adequate <b>foster</b> <b>parents</b> tended to be less permissive and more restrictive in their child-rearing attitudes, even though the differences were somewhat marginal...|$|R
40|$|Foster family care {{is one of}} society's {{responses}} {{to the need for}} temporary or long term care of children whose parents are unable or unwilling to provide them nurturance and safety. Child welfare agencies have been given sanction by society to recruit, select, develop and supervise foster homes. However, their success in these areas has been uneven. [...] According to the foster care literature, there is a chronic shortage of adequate <b>foster</b> <b>parents</b> in Canada and the United States. Many <b>foster</b> <b>parents</b> are dissatisfied with fostering even though they have been designated as adequate by child welfare agencies. So {{that there might be a}} better understanding of the satisfactions derived from fostering this study was undertaken. [...] The purpose of the study was to seek answers to the questions: (1) Is there a significant relationship between foster parents' satisfactions with fostering and social workers' ratings of adequacy of <b>foster</b> <b>parents?</b> (2) Are certain demographic characteristics of <b>foster</b> <b>parents</b> related to <b>foster</b> parents' adequacy and/or satisfaction. [...] Answers to these questions would shed some light on just who are the most adequate and most satisfied <b>foster</b> <b>parents.</b> In addition, since closure of foster homes is more often due to voluntary withdrawal than to agency rejection, identification of predictors of foster parents' satisfaction would be a useful finding. [...] The study group consisted of <b>foster</b> <b>parents</b> from eighty-two <b>foster</b> homes which are listed as "regular" foster homes by the Department of Social Services for the area serviced by their St. John's office. [...] An interview schedule was used to collect the data regarding the <b>foster</b> <b>parents.</b> Because of time and financial constraints the study group was confined to the total population of <b>foster</b> <b>parents</b> in St. John's and surrounding area. [...] The social workers at the St. John's service office of the Child Welfare Division of the Department of Social Services divided the study group into more adequate and less adequate <b>foster</b> <b>parents</b> using the <b>Foster</b> Parents' Global Adequacy Scale developed for this research. The degree of satisfaction of <b>foster</b> <b>parents</b> was determined by a Foster Parents' Satisfaction Scale based on prior work by Fanshel (1966) in the United States.

40|$|Beyond the family, the {{protection}} of children involves an extensive system of services. Foster care is, particularly in the United States, the preferred means of caring for children who must be temporarily placed outside their own homes. The shortage of foster homes, as increasing numbers of women enter the work force, results in overcrowded foster homes, and some foster homes that meet no more than minimal health and safety standards. At the same time, increasing numbers of troubled children are entering the system. In placement decisions, the risks of foster care must be weighed against the risk to children in their own homes. Children in {{the foster care system}} need protection, most commonly provided through interaction of <b>foster</b> <b>parents</b> and caseworkers.
