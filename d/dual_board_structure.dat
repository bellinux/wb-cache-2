We find a significant positive link between DBLS and market valuation, but only in firms with independent chairpersons, implying that the market values firms with independent DBLS more highly. Our results are robust across a number of econometric models that control for different types of market valuation proxies and endogeneity problems. Our findings offer empirical support for agency theory, which suggests that independent DBLS increases the capacity of the board to effectively advise, monitor and discipline top management, and thereby improving market valuation.

The paper also investigates the unique agency relationships using a sample of 90 Islamic banks across 13 countries over the period 2006 - 2014.

We also find evidence of the scope of operation hypothesis with respect to both the board of directors and the SSB as Islamic banks are characterised by a higher degree of complex operations. Interestingly, we find that a larger SSB size may result in lower agency costs and that the greater the size of the unrestricted contracts, the higher the agency costs. This implies that unrestricted profit-sharing contracts are one of the main sources of the unique agency relationships in Islamic banks.

BEE is a form of socio-economic affirmative action championed by the African National Congress (ANC) -led government to address historical imbalances in business participation and ownership in South Africa. We find that block ownership and institutional ownership are negatively associated with the extent of BEE disclosures, whereas government ownership, board diversity (age, education, ethnicity, nationality and occupation), board size and non-executive directors are positively related to the extent of BEE disclosures. By contrast, <b>dual</b> <b>board</b> leadership <b>structure</b> and gender diversity are not significantly associated with BEE disclosures.

This paper, therefore, examines the crucial policy {{question of whether the}} quality of firm-level CG has any effect on the quality and extent of corporate risk disclosures (CRD) in South Africa (SA) with particular focus on the pre- and post- 2007 / 2008 {{global financial}} crisis period. Using one of the largest datasets to-date on CG and CRD, from 2002 to 2011, and distinctively drawing on a multiple theoretical perspective, we find that CRD are largely 'non-financial', 'historical', 'good news' and 'qualitative' in nature over the ten-year period investigated. We also find that block ownership and institutional ownership are negatively associated with the extent of CRD, whilst board diversity, board size and independent nonexecutive directors are positively related to the extent of CRD. By contrast, <b>dual</b> <b>board</b> leadership <b>structure</b> has no significant connection with the extent of CRD. Our results are robust across a raft of econometric models that adequately address different types of endogeneity problems, as well as alternative CG and CRD proxies.

40|$|After {{having been}} {{at the helm of}} the {{international}} monetary system for decades, the International Monetary Fund was sidelined in policy debates in the past few years. One reason for the IMF not having taken a more central role in addressing key global policy issues in recent years relates to its internal governance. This paper focuses specifically on the structure and functioning of the Executive Board. The paper argues that Executive Board, although uniquely placed to provide authoritative guidance to IMF member countries, exert peer pressure and give economic policy advice, is overwhelmed by its tasks and responsibilities and too large to be an effective forum for true international economic dialogue. The paper makes the point that the highly diverse tasks of the IMF require different governance structures in order to be implemented effectively. We believe that the optimal number of governing bodies for the ongoing IMF work is not one, but that it is two, duly distinguishing between multilateral matters from country-related matters. Specifically, we propose to split the tasks that are predominantly systemic in nature from those that are predominantly country-focused and technical and believe that this can be done. Two different Boards would be dealing with these issues: a Systemic Issues Board and a Country Issues Board. The paper also discusses how such a <b>dual</b> <b>board</b> <b>structure</b> could be implemented in practice. ...|$|E
40|$|The International Monetary Fund is {{currently}} {{engaged in a}} reform process to update its activities {{to the challenges of}} economic globalisation and establish it firmly as the central institution for international monetary cooperation. Yet, the current reforms may miss this aim because they do not foresee adjusting IMF governance so as to allow the Executive Board to become a forum for true international economic dialogue. Without such a change in governance, however, such economic dialogue is likely to continue moving outside the IMF, and spread in fora such as the G 7, G 20 or others that do not have universal status. This paper lays out a new proposal to adjust governance to make the IMF more effective in this area. It proposes to create a new smaller Board to deal with global economic issues of a systemic nature, and enlarge the current Board to make more room for developing countries, focusing it on country-related and technical matters, including bilateral surveillance and structural adjustment lending. The implementation of a <b>dual</b> <b>Board</b> <b>structure</b> is obviously challenging from an institutional point of view, and the paper discusses these challenges in detail. Yet, it would allow the IMF to be more effective and carry greater legitimacy vis-à-vis developing economies {{and at the same time}} play a more central role in international economic consultation and cooperation that in recent years has increasingly drifted towards the G-groups such as the G 7, G 20, G 24 and other fora...|$|E

Unlike previous studies, the present analysis is carried out within a stochastic frontier framework, while we use a suitable econometric model to solve the well-known endogeneity problem in corporate governance literature. The empirical framework is applied to a panel of large European banks operating during the period 2002 - 2008. The paper documents a negative correlation between board size, on the one hand, and cost and profit efficiency, on the other hand, while also casts doubt on the conventional regulatory wisdom favouring boards dominated by non-executive directors. Smaller <b>board</b> <b>structures</b> are also associated with better bank efficiency through better management of credit risk. Moreover, we find that <b>dual</b> <b>board</b> systems enhance efficiency, by contrast to increased ownership concentration which seems to exert an insignificant influence. Finally, we identify a positive impact of market discipline upon bank efficiency and report a negative association between bank efficiency and augmented supervisory power as well as foreign ownership.

Our evidence supports this conjecture, showing that <b>board</b> <b>structure</b> determinants differ in predictable ways across different institutional settings. Secondly, in contrast to recent US mandatory reforms, UK reforms have been voluntary.

Our results support this point of view. Although the UK reforms do {{have a significant impact on}} <b>board</b> <b>structures,</b> a large number of firms choose not to comply, and those that do appear to do so for strong economic reasons. The reforms also appear to reduce the ability of well performing CEOs to influence <b>board</b> <b>structures.</b> ...|$|R

Yet, in firms with relatively small or insider oriented boards, we find that subordinate <b>board</b> <b>structures</b> are negatively related to firm performance.
