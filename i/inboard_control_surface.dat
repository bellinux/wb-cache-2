40|$|Rolling Maneuver Load Alleviation (RMLA) {{has been}} {{demonstrated}} on the Active Flexible Wing (AFW) wind tunnel model in the NASA Langley Transonic Dynamics Tunnel. The design objective {{was to develop a}} systematic approach for developing active control laws to alleviate wing incremental loads during roll maneuvers. Using linear load models for the AFW wind-tunnel model which were based on experimental measurements, two RMLA control laws were developed based on a single-degree-of-freedom roll model. The RMLA control laws utilized actuation of outboard control surface pairs to counteract incremental loads generated during rolling maneuvers and actuation of the trailing edge <b>inboard</b> <b>control</b> <b>surface</b> pairs to maintain roll performance. To evaluate the RMLA control laws, roll maneuvers were performed in the wind tunnel at dynamic pressures of 150, 200, and 250 psf and Mach numbers of 0. 33,. 38 and. 44, respectively. Loads obtained during these maneuvers were compared to baseline maneuver loads. For both RMLA controllers, the incremental torsion moments were reduced by up to 60 percent at all dynamic pressures and performance times. Results for bending moment load reductions during roll maneuvers varied. In addition, in a multiple function test, RMLA and flutter suppression system control laws were operated simultaneously during roll maneuvers at dynamic pressures 11 percent above the open-loop flutter dynamic pressure...|$|E

25|$|The {{control system}} of the SZD-6x was {{designed}} to allow the aircraft to be flown with several different control configurations. The trailing edges of the wings carried three surfaces each, all {{of which could be}} linked to form elevons or operated individually as ailerons, elevators or flaps. The metal-skinned split ailerons, (the outboard <b>control</b> <b>surfaces),</b> also formed the airbrakes, opening out to give increased drag. The ailerons/airbrakes could be connected to the rudder pedals to be used as drag rudders, similar to the drag rudders used on the Northrop flying wings. The <b>inboard</b> <b>control</b> <b>surfaces</b> on the swept ford section of trailing edge were typically used for trimming purposes deflecting 10° up or down.|$|R

Reduced order models of <b>inboard</b> and outboard <b>control</b> <b>surface</b> actuator dynamics and a second order vertical wind gust model were developed. An analysis of the rigid body motion of the ARW- 2 was conducted.

2500|$|Changing {{the setting}} of a trim tab adjusts the neutral or resting {{position}} of a <b>control</b> <b>surface</b> (such as an elevator or rudder). As the desired position of a <b>control</b> <b>surface</b> changes (corresponding mainly to different speeds), an adjustable trim tab will allow the operator to reduce the manual force required to maintain that position—to zero, if used correctly. [...] Thus the trim tab acts as a servo tab. [...] Because the center of pressure of the trim tab is further away from the axis of rotation of the <b>control</b> <b>surface</b> than the center of pressure of the <b>control</b> <b>surface,</b> the movement generated by the tab can match the movement generated by the <b>control</b> <b>surface.</b> The position of the <b>control</b> <b>surface</b> on its axis will change until the torque from the <b>control</b> <b>surface</b> and the trim surface balance each other.|$|R

The wind tunnel test provided an opportunity to study aeroelastic system behavior under combined <b>control</b> <b>surface</b> deflections, testing for <b>control</b> <b>surface</b> interaction effects. <b>Control</b> <b>surface</b> interactions were observed in both static <b>control</b> <b>surface</b> actuation testing and dynamic <b>control</b> <b>surface</b> oscillation testing. The primary method of evaluating interactions was examination {{of the goodness of}} the linear superposition assumptions. Responses produced by independently actuating single <b>control</b> <b>surfaces</b> were combined and compared with those produced by simultaneously actuating and oscillating multiple <b>control</b> <b>surfaces.</b> Adjustments to the data were required to isolate the <b>control</b> <b>surface</b> influences. Using dynamic data, the task increases, as both the amplitude and phase have to be considered in the data corrections.

40|$|A {{simulation}} {{framework is}} developed {{for assessing the}} effect of <b>control</b> <b>surface</b> inertial loads on hypersonic vehicle response. The framework {{is based on a}} partitioned, time-marching approach in which the fuselage and <b>control</b> <b>surface</b> equations of motion are in-tegrated independently and forces/motion at the interface are exchanged between the two systems at pre-determined time intervals. This approach is advantageous in that it does not require direct coupling of the fuselage and <b>control</b> <b>surface</b> models, and therefore allows for the models to be of dissimilar form. Equations of motion for both the fuselage and <b>control</b> <b>surface</b> are presented and a formulation for coupling the two systems is outlined which includes iterations within each aeroelastic time step. The methodology is applied to a representative hypersonic vehicle elevator <b>control</b> <b>surface</b> model which includes aerother-moelastic effects and is attached to a single degree of freedom oscillator representing the fuselage. Results show that <b>control</b> <b>surface</b> inertial effects lead to a departure of the in-stantaneous <b>control</b> <b>surface</b> lift force by up to a factor of eight with respect to the static value.

40|$|Abstract: The AGV {{vehicle is}} first {{developed}} in 2005 at King Mongkut’s Institute of Technology North Bangkok. The vehicle was <b>controlled</b> by an <b>inboard</b> PLC <b>control.</b> The {{design of the}} vehicle consists of 3 wheels. The front wheel is used for steering and driving, whereas the 2 rear wheels are free and equipped with 2 encoders. The controlled strategy is based on two main purposes: the path is stored in the PLC memory and the vehicle displacement is calculated by the wheel rotational measurement. The comparison between the required path and the actual position of the AGV allow calculating deviation error. Function of error, a correction of strategy of driving of driving speed and steering angle, is applied {{in order to get}} a smooth and precise displacement. However, the past developed vehicle is lack of remote control. This paper presents the integrated PLC <b>inboard</b> <b>control</b> with wireless camera. The integrated control scheme can apply to controlling the vehicle from the control room or remote areas. The distance of camera control 50 - 100 meters.

Considering three types of typical <b>control</b> <b>surface</b> failures (lock-in-place (LIP), loss-of-effectiveness (LOE) and float), flight control reconfiguration characteristic and capability of such aircraft types are analyzed. Because of the <b>control</b> <b>surface</b> redundancy, the aircraft using the dynamic inversion flight control law already has a control allocation block. In this paper, its flight control configuration during the above failures is achieved by modifying this block.

Results indicate that, in the circumstances of <b>control</b> <b>surface</b> failures with limited degree and the degradation of the flying quality level, a combat flying wing adopting this flight control reconfiguration approach based on control allocation could guarantee its flight safety and perform some flight combat missions...|$|R
