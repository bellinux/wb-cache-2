40|$|The Idaho National Engineering Laboratory (INEL) is {{conducting}} intensive {{research in the}} design and development of a small excore heat-pipe-thermionic space nuclear reactor power system (SEHPTR). The SEHPTR spacecraft will be able to supply 40 kW of power in any given orbit. The key components in this reactor are the thermionic heat pipes. The heat pipes have two major functions: (1) to convert heat energy into electrical energy, and (2) to radiate the excess heat to space. Thermionic power conversion is the process of converting heat energy into electrical energy with no moving parts. Heat is applied to the cathode surface. This heat will boil off electrons that will jump across the gap to the cooler surface of the anode, which will cause a potential difference between the two plates and induce a current through the load. Thermionic power conversion is incorporated as part of the heat pipe. The heat pipe, which is being developed by Thermacore Inc., is actually two heat pipes. It uses a radial heat pipe, called the emitter, and an axial <b>heat</b> <b>pipe</b> <b>collector.</b> The emitter heat pipe will pass the heat from the nuclear core to the cathode surface. The collector heat pipe keeps the anode surface cooler by transferring the heat from the anode surface and radiating it to space...|$|E

40|$|The European Union has {{an ongoing}} {{commitment}} to reducing CO 2 emission as highlighted by its agreement at the Kyoto Summit. One approach to achieving these reductions {{would be to}} develop alternative energy sources for major energy demanding sectors. In the EU, about 40 % of all energy consumed is associated with buildings and of this, about 60 % is utilised in the housing sector. A {{major part of the}} energy demand of buildings could be met by utilising renewable energy sources, e. g. solar energy. Existing large-scale plants for power generation prevent efficient utilisation of the waste hot water produced. This means that to meet electricity demand, vast quantities of fossil fuels are burnt releasing unwanted pollutants (e. g., CO 2 and NOx) into the atmosphere. Over the last decade, small-scale CHP plants have been introduced for many applications with proven environmental and economic benefits. In addition, solar energy has been used to generate electricity and provide hot water in conjunction with the CHP plants. Investigation of a hybrid <b>heat</b> <b>pipe</b> solar collector/CHP system was carried out in this research. The system is powered by solar and gas energy as well as the boiler waste heat to provide electricity and heating for residential buildings. Compared to the relevant system configurations, this system has the following innovative features: The solar collector was integrated with exhaust flue gas channels that allowed both solar energy and waste heat from exhaust gas to be utilised. <b>Heat</b> <b>pipes</b> as high efficiency heat transfer devices were incorporated in the collector panel. Both miniature and normal <b>heat</b> <b>pipes</b> were investigated, and this resulted in two types of collectors, e. g., thin membrane <b>heat</b> <b>pipe</b> solar <b>collector,</b> and hybrid <b>heat</b> <b>pipe</b> solar <b>collector,</b> to be produced for this application. A compact, lightweight turbine was applied in this system. Novel refrigerants, including n-pentane and hydrofluoroethers (HFEs), were employed as the working fluids for the CHP system. Use of the system would save primary energy of approximately 3, 150 kWh per year compared to the conventional electricity and heating supply systems, and this would result in reduction of CO 2 emission of up to 1. 5 tonnes. The running cost of the proposed system would also be lower. The research initially investigated the thermal performance of several <b>heat</b> <b>pipes,</b> including micro/miniature <b>heat</b> <b>pipes,</b> normal circular and rectangular <b>heat</b> <b>pipes,</b> with/without wicks. An analytical model was developed to evaluate the heat transport capacity for these <b>heat</b> <b>pipes.</b> A miniature <b>heat</b> <b>pipe</b> with parallel piped channel geometry was proposed. The variation of heat transport capacity for either micro/miniature or normal <b>heat</b> <b>pipes</b> with operation temperature, liquid fill level, inclination and channel geometry were investigated. Investigation of the operating characteristics of the selected <b>heat</b> <b>pipes,</b> e. g., two miniature and one mini <b>heat</b> <b>pipes,</b> and two normal <b>heat</b> <b>pipes,</b> was then carried out using both the numerical technique and experimental testing. It was found that the results from tests were in good agreement with the numerical predictions when the test conditions were close to the simulation assumptions. The research work further involved the design, modelling, construction and tests of two innovative <b>heat</b> <b>pipe</b> solar <b>collectors,</b> namely, the thin membrane <b>heat</b> <b>pipe</b> solar <b>collector</b> and the hybrid <b>heat</b> <b>pipe</b> solar <b>collector.</b> A computer model was developed to analyse the heat transfer in the collectors. Two collector efficiencies, η and η 1, were defined to evaluate their thermal performance, which were all indicated as the function of a general parameter (tmean-ta) /In. Effects of the top cover, manifold as well as flue gas temperature and flow rate (for hybrid collector only) on collector efficiencies were investigated using the computer model developed. Laboratory tests were carried out to validate the modelling predictions and experimentally examine the thermal performance of the collectors. Comparison was made between the modelling and testing results, and the reasons for error formation were analysed. The research then considered the issues of the micro impulse-reaction turbine, which was another part of the integrated system. The structure configuration, coupling pattern with the generator as well as internal geometry contour of the turbine were described. The velocity, pressure and turbulent kinetic energy of the flow in the turbine were determined using numerical CFD prediction. In addition, experimental tests were carried out using a prototype system. The results of CFD simulation and testing show good agreement. This indicates that CFD {{can be used as a}} tool of optimizing turbine geometry and determining operating conditions. The research finally focused on the integrated system which brought the <b>heat</b> <b>pipe</b> solar <b>collector,</b> boiler and micro turbine together. The individual components, configurations and layout of the system were illustrated. Theoretical analysis was carried out to investigate thermodynamic cycle and heat transfer contained in the combined system, which is based on the assumption that the system operated on a typical Rankine cycle powered by both solar and gas energy. Tests for the prototype system was carried out to realistically evaluate its performance. Two types of turbine units were examined; one is an impulse-reaction turbine, and the other is a turbo-alternator. The turbo-alternator was found to be too small in capacity for this system thereby affecting its output significantly. The micro impulse reaction turbine was considered a better option. A typical testing showed that the majority of heat required for the turbine operation came from the boiler (7. 65 kW), and very little (0. 23 kW) from the solar collector. The gas consumption was 8. 5 kW. This operation resulted in an electricity output and domestic hot water generation, which were 1. 34 kW and 3. 66 kW respectively. The electrical efficiency was 16 % and the thermal efficiency was 43 %, resulting in an overall efficiency of 59 %. Increasing the number of the collectors used would result in reduced heat output from the boiler. This would help in improving system performance and increasing efficiencies. In this application, number of collectors used would be 4 as the flue gas flow rate would only be sufficient to provide 4 to 5 such collectors for heat recovery. The research resulted in the proposal of another system configuration. The innovative concept is illustrated in Chapter 8, and its key technical issues are discussed.

40|$|Solar energy, being {{abundant}} and widespread in its availability, makes {{it one of}} the most attractive sources of energies. Tapping this energy will not only help in bridging the gap between demand and supply of electricity but shall also save money in the long run. A Solar Water Heating System (SWHS) is a device that makes available the thermal energy of the incident solar radiation for use in various applications by heating the water. Solar energy is one of the cleaner forms of renewable energy resources. The conventional solar collector is a well-established technology with certain limitations. This has various applications such as water heating, space heating and cooling. However, the thermal efficiency of these collectors is limited by the absorption properties of the working fluid, which is very poor for typical conventional solar evacuated tube collector.

40|$|Various {{technical}} {{options for}} developing a solar operated refrigerator have been discussed. Their suitability for {{being used as a}} vaccine store for the conditions specified by the World Health (EPI) Organization Expanded Programme on Immunization 4 have been evaluated. A model to predict the performance of a photovoltaic refrigerator have been developed and used to identify factors which influence its performance. It was concluded that it can be more competitive in areas where insolation is high and sunshine hours are long. It has been proposed that ice-lined refrigerators, which would run during the day, may be more economical and eliminate the need for a battery storage. The option of operating an 'Electrolux' absorption refrigerator with evacuated tube <b>heat</b> <b>pipe</b> <b>collectors</b> has been assessed. It was concluded that the operation was not possible without a major re-design of the commercially available models. However, it was proposed that coordination of the EPI with other development programmes may be useful. It is proposed to build, with this coordinated effort, biogas plants. Biogas can then fuel the modified burner of the kerosene fueled absorption refrigerators. This may well prove to be a cheaper option. Characterization of various adsorption pairs has been done using the experimental rig developed for the purpose. The influence of various properties of adsorption pairs on the performance of an adsorption refrigeration cycle has been studied. It was observed that the generation temperature in an adsorption refrigeration cycle (or a bivariant absorption system), for a specified operating regime, was only a function of the refrigerant. A relationship between the refrigerant properties and the generating temperature for specified operating conditions was developed. Using this relationship it was established that ammonia and methanol cannot be generated at temperatures below 1200 C for WHO/EPI specified operating conditions, if the condenser was air-cooled. A novel idea of direct absorption of solar radiation into the activated carbon bed is put forward to combat the temperature differential of 214 °C, in a conventional design of SGA, between the carbon and the metal container. The idea was practically implemented by replacing the top of the metal box by transparent glass sheet. The seal between the metal container and glass imposed practical difficulties in that design but the tests proved that the idea had potential.

The fundamental study showed that the film boiling phenomenon can be a serious problem when a conventional <b>heat</b> <b>pipe</b> is used under high heat flux conditions. Film boiling can make a conventional <b>heat</b> <b>pipe</b> lose its ability for sustained heat transfer with a small temperature gradient. The flow modified <b>heat</b> <b>pipe</b> that was invented and studied eliminates film boiling in the evaporator of the <b>heat</b> <b>pipe.</b> In this kind of <b>heat</b> <b>pipe,</b> a flow-modifier element was introduced into the <b>heat</b> <b>pipe</b> chamber to improve the heat transfer of the two-phase flow. The experimental data indicated that the flow modified <b>heat</b> <b>pipe</b> was dramatically better than a conventional <b>heat</b> <b>pipe</b> under a comparable high heat flux load. This novel <b>heat</b> <b>pipe</b> successfully combined the flow modified <b>heat</b> <b>pipe</b> and the loop <b>heat</b> <b>pipe</b> and, thus, effectively overcame film boiling by collapsing the formed films. It was shown that the novel <b>heat</b> <b>pipes</b> are suitable for high heat flux and high temperature operation where conventional <b>heat</b> <b>pipes</b> will only function at a fraction of the heat load...|$|R

40|$|Graduation date: 1993 Conventional {{stainless}} steel - water and ceramic fabric composite water <b>heat</b> <b>pipes</b> {{have been built}} and tested. The tests have been conducted to compare the performance characteristics between conventional and fabric composite <b>heat</b> <b>pipe</b> radiators for space nuclear power heat rejection systems. The fabric composite concept combines a strong ceramic fabric with a thin metal liner to form a very lightweight <b>heat</b> <b>pipe.</b> The <b>heat</b> <b>pipes</b> tested have used identical, homogeneous fabric wicks and water as the working fluid. One fabric composite <b>heat</b> <b>pipe</b> has been constructed by fitting a braided aluminoborosilicate fabric tube over {{the outside of the}} conventional {{stainless steel}} <b>heat</b> <b>pipe.</b> A more advanced fabric composite design combines the woven fabric with a 0. 25 mm (10 mil) stainless steel tube as the liner, and reduces the mass of the <b>heat</b> <b>pipe</b> by a factor of three. A <b>heat</b> <b>pipe</b> testing facility was designed and built for the purpose of testing various conventional and fabric composite <b>heat</b> <b>pipes.</b> This facility allows the testing of <b>heat</b> <b>pipes</b> in a vacuum, at low temperatures, and can accommodate a variety of <b>heat</b> <b>pipe</b> designs. Instrumentation and computer interfacing provide for continuous monitoring and evaluation of <b>heat</b> <b>pipe</b> performance. Tests show that <b>heat</b> <b>pipe</b> radiator capacity can be significantly enhanced by using the fabric composite design.

40|$|A {{nitrogen}} <b>heat</b> <b>pipe</b> was designed, {{built and}} {{tested for the}} purpose of providing a thermal shunt between the two stages of a Gifford-McMahan (GM) cryocooler during cooldown. The nitrogen <b>heat</b> <b>pipe</b> has an operating temperature range between 63 and 123 K. While the <b>heat</b> <b>pipe</b> is in the temperature range during the system cooldown, it acts as a thermal shunt {{between the first and second}} stage of the cryocooler. The <b>heat</b> <b>pipe</b> increases the <b>heat</b> transfer to the first stage of the cryocooler, thereby reducing the cooldown time of the system. When the <b>heat</b> <b>pipe</b> temperature drops below the triple point, the nitrogen working fluid freezes, effectively stopping the <b>heat</b> <b>pipe</b> operation. A small heat leak between cryocooler stages remains because of axial conduction along the <b>heat</b> <b>pipe</b> wall. As long as the <b>heat</b> <b>pipe</b> remains below 63 K, the <b>heat</b> <b>pipe</b> remains inactive. <b>Heat</b> <b>pipe</b> performance limits were measured and the optimum fluid charge was determined...|$|R

NASA Glenn Research Center requisitioned nine titanium water <b>heat</b> <b>pipes</b> from three vendors. Each vendor supplied three <b>heat</b> <b>pipes</b> 1. 25 cm diameter by 1. 1 meter long with each vendor selecting a different wick design. Each of the three <b>heat</b> <b>pipes</b> is slightly different in construction. Additional specifications for the <b>heat</b> <b>pipes</b> included 500 K nominal operating temperature, light weight, and freeze tolerance. The <b>heat</b> <b>pipes</b> were performance tested gravity-aided, in the horizontal position and at elevations against gravity at 450 K and 500 K. Performance of the three <b>heat</b> <b>pipes</b> is compared.

50|$|Grooved wicks {{are used}} in {{spacecraft}} <b>heat</b> <b>pipes,</b> {{as shown in the}} first photograph in this section. The <b>heat</b> <b>pipes</b> are formed by extruding aluminum, and typically have an integral flange to increase the heat transfer area, which lowers the temperature drop. Grooved wicks {{are used in}} spacecraft, instead of the screen or sintered wicks used for terrestrial <b>heat</b> <b>pipes,</b> since the <b>heat</b> <b>pipes</b> don’t have to operate against gravity in space. This allows spacecraft <b>heat</b> <b>pipes</b> to be several meters long, in contrast to the roughly 25 cm maximum length for a water <b>heat</b> <b>pipe</b> operating on Earth. Ammonia is the most common working fluid for spacecraft <b>heat</b> <b>pipes.</b> Ethane is used when the <b>heat</b> <b>pipe</b> must operate at temperatures below the ammonia freezing temperature.|$|R

The working fluid mass is chosen so that the <b>heat</b> <b>pipe</b> contains both vapor and liquid over the operating temperature range.|$|R
