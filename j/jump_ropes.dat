25|$|Historically in the United States {{there were}} two {{competing}} <b>jump</b> <b>rope</b> organizations: the International Rope Skipping Organization (IRSO), and the World Rope Skipping Federation (WRSF).

5000|$|Rabbits - The Rabbits {{were the}} first seen by the {{audience}} where they capture Commander ApeTrully {{when he found out}} that the Rabbits like candy rather than carrots. They had him wear a carrot costume and jump rope. They use <b>jump</b> <b>ropes</b> for attacks and even have a bad-smelling belch attack. When Mystique Sonia and Mighty Ray end up captured upon being knocked out by the Rabbit's belching and end up in the same position as Commander ApeTrully, Lin Chung came to their rescue enabling Mighty Ray and Mystique Sonia to turn the tides against the Rabbits. Their leader Jumpy Ghostface (also known as the Rabbit King) went up against First Squad in a jump-rope battle. After being defeated, Jumpy Ghostface joins Big Green as a member of First Squad. In [...] "Ninja Fight", it was revealed that there was a previous Rabbit King who selected Jumpy Ghostface to be his successor instead of Spotter the Rabbit causing Sparta to leave. Rabbit Castle was later attacked by Spotter the Rabbit and his Mantis allies where he captures all the Rabbits leaving one to let Jumpy Ghostface know that he is back. While First Squad and the Beetles fought the Mantis Army, Jumpy Ghostface dueled with Spotter the Rabbit. After Spotter the Rabbit was repelled and the Mantis Army also takes their leave, the other Rabbits were rescued.|$|E

50|$|Day 33: A folder {{containing}} {{information on}} all Team High-Voltage members was left {{at a table}} in the Industrial House, but Paco and Kim took notice of it for a short moment. Jessica's dog, Lily, was also put on the other side of a grating where Pamu, Seichang, Mark and Lordwin were locked up weeks before for sleeping past the wake-up call. Ryan and Luz were sent to the confession room, where someone cleaned his feet. Erica's concerns about the side-effects of her breast implants prompted Big Brother to send over a general surgeon to check on them. The doctor attested that the implants do not hamper Erica's overall conditions. A long line of catering trays full of food was left at the Luxury House dining room for breakfast and Roy later confessed that seeing the trays was torture on all of them. Wendy's boyfriend also came over to clean the house and she talked to the housemates about him without actually directing it at him. The Luxury housemates went to the Resort for an hour, with a tourist in scuba suit waiting for them at the pool. Divine got into a short disagreement with Seth over using two <b>jump</b> <b>ropes</b> at the same time for the competition, which he believed they could handle. Paco later entered the Luxury House as a clown but still got the cold shoulder even as a former housemate; Deniesse took it over the edge by spraying air freshener right in Paco's face. Some of Tin's dogs were sent inside the house as another distraction, with her Labrador, Prada, inside the confession room. The canines' presence also irked Wendy because they defecated. With the announcement of the first major battle, Carlo and Divine screened for six people who could work together in creating the routine, eventually choosing Seth, Tin, Jerico, Eting, Roy, and Slater. Kigoy got angry about Divine excluding him.|$|E

40|$|This study {{aimed to}} {{determine}} the effects of different types of <b>jump</b> <b>ropes</b> on jump cycles while skipping. Thirteen youth volunteers performed the basic jump and the alternate-foot jump using two ropes differing in diameter and weight. Two-way ANOVA revealed that the main effects of skipping patterns and type of rope were significant in cycle time, contact time, and takeoff time, respectively (P 0. 05 for all variables). However, a clear difference was found between the two ropes for correlation coefficient of CV in cycle times between skipping patterns. These results suggested that different types of ropes affect jump cycles while skipping...|$|E
3000|$|To {{learn about}} their equipment, {{participants}} were asked: “My program has the following portable play equipment features available in good condition for children to use indoors (indicate how many of each):” (1) jumping toys, e.g., <b>jump</b> <b>ropes,</b> jumping balls; (2) push–pull toys, e.g., wagons, wheelbarrows, big dump trucks; (3) twirling toys, e.g., ribbons, scarves, batons, hula hoops, parachutes; (4) throwing, catching, and striking toys: balls, bean bags, noodles, rackets; (5) balance toys, e.g., balance beams, plastic “river stones”; (6) crawling or tumbling equipment, e.g., mats, portable tunnels. The number of features in each subcategory was summed to give a total “equipment” score ranging from 0 to 33. Alpha coefficients (Cronbach 1951) indicated acceptable internal consistency for space (0.723) and equipment (0.873) across all of their respective sub-categories.|$|E
25|$|A {{skipping}} rope (British English) or <b>jump</b> <b>rope</b> (American English) {{is a tool}} used in the sport of <b>jump</b> <b>rope</b> where one or more participants <b>jump</b> over a <b>rope</b> swung so that it passes under their feet and over their heads. There are multiple subsets of <b>jump</b> <b>rope</b> including: single freestyle, single speed, pairs, three person speed (double dutch), and three person freestyle (double dutch freestyle). The events are often separated by gender and age. There are hundreds of competitive teams all around the world. There are a few major organisations that support <b>jump</b> <b>rope</b> as a sport as seen below, schools rarely have <b>jump</b> <b>rope</b> teams, and states do not sanction official events for high school or elementary school. In freestyle events, jumpers {{use a variety of}} basic and advanced techniques in a routine of one minute, which is judged by a head judge, content judges, and performance judges. In speed events, a jumper alternates their feet with the rope going around the jumper every time one of their feet hit the ground for 30 seconds, one minute, or three minutes. The jumper is judged on the number of times the right foot touches the ground in those times.|$|R
