40|$|The {{determinants}} of aggregate income-tax-evasion behaviour {{as reflected in}} the size of the underground economy in the US are analysed. These factors include the <b>federal</b> personal <b>income</b> tax rate, the social security tax rate, the <b>federal</b> corporation <b>income</b> tax rate, the public's dissatisfaction with the government, IRS audit rates and IRS penalty assessments on detected unreported income. The results show that the size of the underground economy is an increasing function of <b>federal</b> personal <b>income</b> tax rate, the social security tax rate and the public's dissatisfaction with the government. However, the size is a decreasing function of IRS penalty payments on unpaid taxes...|$|R

Furthermore, the recipient must assure that only eligible individuals or groups participated in the program by establishing strict controls of program funds to avoid non-eligible persons from receiving the specific assistance.|$|E
5|$|In Southern Pacific Company v.

No issues involving the definition of income with respect to wages, salary or other compensation for labor were decided by the Court.|$|E
5|$|The U.S. Supreme Court {{rejected}} that argument, essentially ruling that under <b>federal</b> <b>income</b> tax law all the future income earned by Mr. Earl was taxable {{to him at}} the time he earned the income, even though he had already assigned part of the income to his wife, and regardless of the validity of the assignment agreement under state law.

5|$|The {{net effect}} of all Reagan-era tax bills was a 1% {{decrease}} in government revenues when compared to Treasury Department revenue estimates from the Administration's first post-enactment January budgets. However, <b>federal</b> <b>income</b> tax receipts increased from 1980 to 1989, rising from $308.7 billion to $549 billion or an average annual rate of 8.2% (2.5% attributed to higher Social Security receipts), and federal outlays grew {{at an annual rate}} of 7.1%.|$|E
5|$|As {{a result}} of his {{business}} career, Romney and his wife had a net worth of between $190 and $250million, including their retirement account, worth between $20 and $100million. Most of that wealth has been held in blind trusts since 2003, some of it offshore. An additional blind trust, valued at $100million in 2012, exists in the name of their children. In 2010, Romney and his wife received about $22million in income, almost all of it from investments such as dividends, capital gains, and carried interest; and they paid about $3million in <b>federal</b> <b>income</b> taxes, for an effective tax rate of 14percent. For the years 1990–2010, their effective federal tax rates were above 13percent with an average rate of about 20percent.|$|E
5|$|During Reagan's presidency, <b>federal</b> <b>income</b> {{tax rates}} were lowered {{significantly}} with {{the signing of}} the Economic Recovery Tax Act of 1981, which lowered the top marginal tax bracket from 70% to 50% and the lowest bracket from 14% to 11%. Other tax increases passed by Congress and signed by Reagan ensured however that tax revenues over his two terms were 18.2% of GDP as compared to 18.1% over the 40-year period of 1970–2010. Then, in 1982 the Job Training Partnership Act of 1982 was signed into law, initiating one of the United States' first public–private partnerships and {{a major part of the}} president's job creation program. Reagan's Assistant Secretary of Labor and Chief of Staff, Al Angrisani, was a primary architect of the bill.|$|E

5|$|Lucas v. Earl is {{a leading}} case {{in the area of}} U.S. income taxation, and stands for the Anticipatory Assignment of Income Doctrine. In the case, Mr. Earl was arguing that because he and his wife, in the year 1901, had made a legally valid {{assignment}} agreement (for state law purposes) to have his then-current and after-acquired income (which was earned solely by him) be treated as the income of both him and his wife as joint tenants with right of survivorship, the assignment agreement should also determine the <b>federal</b> <b>income</b> tax effect of the income he earned (i.e., only half the income should be taxed to him).|$|E
5|$|Other {{important}} legislation involved {{two measures}} to raise revenues for the Federal government: tariffs (a policy with long precedent), {{and a new}} <b>Federal</b> <b>income</b> tax. In 1861, Lincoln signed {{the second and third}} Morrill Tariff, the first having become law under James Buchanan. Also in 1861, Lincoln signed the Revenue Act of 1861, creating the first U.S. income tax. This created a flat tax of 3 percent on incomes above $800 ($ in current dollar terms), which was later changed by the Revenue Act of 1862 to a progressive rate structure.|$|E
5|$|Regarding the {{taxability}} {{of income}} {{in connection with}} events or activities not involving a government privilege or franchise, the United States Supreme Court stated in United States v. Sullivan that gains from illegal traffic in liquor {{are subject to the}} <b>Federal</b> <b>income</b> tax. The U.S. Supreme Court ruled in Rutkin v. United States that the receipt of money obtained by extortion is taxable as income to the wrongdoer. The U.S. Supreme Court ruled in James v. United States that the receipt of money obtained through embezzlement is taxable as income to the wrongdoer, even though the wrongdoer is required to return the money to its owner.|$|E

40|$|In 2013, <b>federal</b> {{personal}} <b>income</b> {{tax increases}} were {{implemented in the}} U. S. under provisions of two federal statutes: the American Taxpayer Relief Act of 2012 and the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act of 2010. Based on our analysis of data for the time period 1970 - 2008, we argue that the incentives to engage in <b>federal</b> personal <b>income</b> tax evasion have been increased as {{a direct consequence of}} the public tax-increase policies manifested in these two statutes. To demonstrate this conclusion in the present study, we first present evidence that strongly suggests that personal income tax evasion has been an increasing function of the maximum marginal <b>federal</b> personal <b>income</b> tax rate over the period 1970 - 2008, which constitutes the most current data currently available on aggregate personal income tax evasion. This evidence leads us then to conclude that the <b>federal</b> personal <b>income</b> tax increases implemented effectively in 2013 under provisions of the two aforementioned statutes will result in increased tax evasion behavior and hence lower tax collections. Among other things, then, this public-policy-induced increase in personal income tax evasion also implies that the federal budget deficits in coming years will be greater than projected by the CBO and various government agencies. We also find that, among other things, <b>federal</b> personal <b>income</b> tax evasion has been an increasing function of the unemployment rate. Thus, among other things, there is also evidence that continued high unemployment rates may increase tax evasion and hence the size of federal budget deficits. ...|$|R

5|$|This {{argument}} {{is based in}} part on the U.S. Supreme Court decision in the case of United States v. Bevans.

No issues regarding <b>federal</b> <b>income</b> taxation or the Internal Revenue Code were presented to or decided by the Court in the Bevans case. The Internal Revenue Code and the Internal Revenue Service did not yet exist in 1818, when the Bevans murder case was decided.|$|E
5|$|His third book (co-authored by Georgia Congressman John Linder) {{entitled}} The FairTax Book, {{explains the}} proposal to implement a national retail sales tax {{in lieu of the}} <b>federal</b> <b>income</b> taxes, payroll taxes, estate tax, etc. The hardcover version held the #1 non-fiction spot on the New York Times bestseller list for the last two weeks of August 2005 and remained in the top ten for seven weeks. The paperback released in May 2006 contains additional information, an afterword and several revisions of misstatements made in the hardcover edition. It also spent several weeks on the New York Times bestseller list. Boortz claims to have donated 100% of his royalties from the FairTax book to charity and has commented on his radio show that he has not made one cent from the book. As of July 2006, Boortz claims his charitable donations from book proceeds exceed one hundred thousand US dollars. The book is one of his most frequent topics of discussion.|$|E
5|$|On February 5, 2001, a {{group of}} Wilkinson's {{creditors}} filed suit to have his companies seized.

He had paid no <b>federal</b> <b>income</b> taxes since 1991. At his deposition in June 2001, Wilkinson invoked his Fifth Amendment privilege against self-incrimination over 140 times. Wallace's Bookstore was liquidated for just over $31 million, and ecampus.com was sold for $2.5 million. Wilkinson's wife, Martha, also filed for bankruptcy; his sons were forced to sell their homes to repay loans made to them by their father.

5|$|Revenue from tariffs {{was then}} {{a major source of}} income for the federal government. There was no <b>federal</b> <b>income</b> tax, and tariff debates were passionate; the 1888 presidential {{election}} had them as a major issue. Many Democrats supported a tariff for revenue only—that is, the purpose of tariffs should be to finance government, not to encourage American manufacturers. McKinley disagreed with that and sponsored the McKinley Tariff of 1890. This act, passed by the Republican-dominated Congress, raised rates on imports to protect American industry. McKinley's tariff proved unpopular among many people who had to pay the increased prices, and was seen as a reason not only for his defeat for re-election to Congress in 1890, but also for the Republicans losing control of both House and Senate in that year's midterm elections. Nevertheless, McKinley's defeat did not, in the end, damage his political prospects, as the Democrats were blamed for gerrymandering him out of his seat.|$|E
5|$|Soon afterward, Hill {{dropped out}} of the public eye, {{dissatisfied}} with the music industry and suffering with the pressures of fame. Her last full-length recording, the new-material live album MTV Unplugged No. 2.0 (2002), sharply divided critics and sold poorly compared to her first album and work with the Fugees. Hill's subsequent activity, which includes the release of a few songs and occasional festival appearances, has been sporadic. Her behavior has sometimes caused audience dissatisfaction; a reunion with her former group did not last long. Her music, as well as a series of public statements she has issued, has become critical of pop culture and societal institutions. Hill has six children, five of whom are with Rohan Marley. In 2012, she pleaded guilty to tax evasion for failure to pay <b>federal</b> <b>income</b> taxes, and in 2013, served a three-month prison sentence.|$|E
5|$|U.S. {{taxation}} {{is generally}} progressive, especially the <b>federal</b> <b>income</b> taxes, and {{is among the}} most progressive in the developed world. The highest 10% of income earners pay a majority of federal taxes, and about half of all taxes. Payroll taxes for Social Security are a flat regressive tax, with no tax charged on income above $118,500 (for 2015 and 2016) and no tax at all paid on unearned income from things such as stocks and capital gains. The historic reasoning for the regressive nature of the payroll tax is that entitlement programs have not been viewed as welfare transfers. However, according to the Congressional Budget Office the net effect of Social Security is that the benefit to tax ratio ranges from roughly 70% for the top earnings quintile to about 170% for the lowest earning quintile, making the system progressive.|$|E
