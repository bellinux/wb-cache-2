2500|$|Baudrillard's writing up to {{the mid-1980s}} is open to several criticisms. He fails to define key terms, such as the code; his writing style is {{hyperbolic}} and declarative, often lacking sustained, systematic analysis when it is appropriate; he totalizes his insights, refusing to qualify or delimit his claims. He writes about particular experiences, television images, as if nothing else in society mattered, extrapolating a bleak {{view of the world}} from that limited base. <b>He</b> ignores <b>contradictory</b> <b>evidence</b> such as the many benefits afforded by the new media ...|$|R

5000|$|The film {{offers no}} clear {{resolution}} of its <b>contradictory</b> <b>evidence</b> and blind alleys. According to Vincent Canby, the filmmakers [...] "are not {{as interested in}} {{the workings of the}} plot as in matters of identity and obsession".|$|R

5000|$|The {{boundary}} between fringe science and pseudoscience is disputed. The connotation of [...] "fringe science" [...] {{is that the}} enterprise is rational but is unlikely to produce good results {{for a variety of}} reasons, including incomplete or <b>contradictory</b> <b>evidence.</b>|$|R
50|$|Pseudocheirus peregrinus occidentalis, {{called the}} western {{ringtail}} possum, {{found in the}} south west of the country.

"In July , for example, the Ministry of Health {{reported}} exactly zero violent {{deaths in}} Anbar Province, {{in spite of}} the <b>contradictory</b> <b>evidence</b> we saw on our televisions.
