50|$|<b>Gestodene</b> is {{a potent}} progestogen, and also {{possesses}} weak androgenic, antimineralocorticoid, and glucocorticoid activity. It has relatively high affinity for the androgen receptor (AR), with twice that of levonorgestrel (which {{is known to be}} one of the more androgenic 19-nortestosterone derivatives). However, the ratio of progestogenic to androgenic effects of <b>gestodene</b> is distinctly higher than that of levonorgestrel, and the increase in sex hormone-binding globulin (SHBG) levels (a marker of androgenicity) produced by oral contraceptives containing <b>gestodene</b> is slightly less than that produced by oral contraceptives containing desogestrel (which is known {{to be one of the}} more weakly androgenic 19-nortestosterone derivatives). In addition, no difference in acne incidence has been observed with oral contraceptives containing <b>gestodene</b> and oral contraceptives containing desogestrel. Moreover, <b>gestodene</b> has been found to strongly inhibit 5α-reductase in vitro (14.5% and 45.9% inhibition at 0.1 μM and 1 μM, respectively), and this action was substantially greater than that of desogestrel or levonorgestrel. Taken together, like desogestrel, <b>gestodene</b> appears to have a low potential for androgenic effects. In addition to the AR, <b>gestodene</b> has very high affinity for the mineralocorticoid receptor (MR), but only a relatively weak antimineralocorticoid effect that is comparable to that of progesterone. <b>Gestodene</b> binds to SHBG with relatively high affinity, and is 75% bound to the protein in circulation.|$|E
50|$|Based on {{the dosage}} {{necessary}} to inhibit ovulation in women, <b>gestodene</b> {{is the most}} potent {{of all of the}} currently used contraceptive progestogens. The oral dosage of <b>gestodene</b> required for ovulation inhibition is 30 or 40 μg per day. This is about 10,000 times lower than the oral dosage of progesterone required to inhibit ovulation (300 mg/day). A dosage of <b>gestodene</b> of 75 μg/day is used in contraceptives.|$|E
50|$|<b>Gestodene</b> is {{neutral in}} terms of {{androgenic}} activity, meaning that contraceptive pills containing <b>gestodene</b> do not exhibit the androgenic side effects (e.g., acne, hirsutism) sometimes associated with second-generation contraceptive pills such as those containing levonorgestrel.|$|E

50|$|<b>Gestodene,</b> {{also known}} as 17α-ethynyl-18-methyl-19-nor-δ15-testosterone, as well as 17α-ethynyl-18-methylestra-4,15-dien-17β-ol-3-one or 13β-ethyl-18,19-dinor-17α-pregna-4,15-dien-20-yn-17β-ol-3-one, is a {{synthetic}} estrane steroid and a derivative of testosterone. It is more specifically a derivative of norethisterone (17α-ethynyl-19-nortestosterone) {{and is a member}} of the gonane (18-methylestrane) subgroup of the 19-nortestosterone family of progestins. <b>Gestodene</b> is almost identical to levonorgestrel in terms of chemical structure, differing only in having an additional double bond between the C15 and C16 positions, and for this reason is {{also known as}} δ15-norgestrel or as 15-dehydronorgestrel.|$|E
50|$|The {{estrogen}} dosage in third-generation contraceptive pills (including those containing <b>gestodene)</b> {{is lower}} than that in second-generation oral contraceptives, reducing the likelihood of weight gain, breast tenderness, and migraine.|$|E
50|$|The 19-nortestosterone progestins, <b>gestodene</b> and, to {{a lesser}} extent, desogestrel, {{have been found to}} inhibit {{cytochrome}} P450 enzymes and to progressively inhibit the metabolism and increase the concentrations of EE.|$|E
50|$|Although <b>gestodene</b> {{does not}} bind to the {{estrogen}} receptor itself, the drug {{may have some}} estrogenic activity, and this {{would appear to be}} mediated by its weakly estrogenic metabolites 3β,5α-tetrahydrogestodene {{and to a lesser extent}} 3α,5α-tetrahydrogestodene.|$|E

50|$|Women {{who take}} oral {{contraceptives}} containing <b>gestodene</b> are 5.6 {{times as likely}} to develop venous thromboembolism than women who do not take any contraceptive pill, and 1.6 {{times as likely to}} develop venous thromboembolism compared to women taking oral contraceptives containing levonorgestrel.|$|E
50|$|<b>Gestodene,</b> {{sold under}} the brand names Femodene, Femodette, Gynera, Harmonet, Meliane, Minesse, and Minulet among others, is a {{progestin}} {{which is used}} {{in combination with the}} estrogen ethinylestradiol as a hormonal contraceptive. It is marketed in Europe but is not available in the United States.|$|E
50|$|Alternatively, estranes such as {{noretynodrel}} and norethisterone {{are classified}} as first-generation while gonanes such as norgestrel and levonorgestrel {{are classified as}} second-generation, with less androgenic gonanes such as desogestrel, norgestimate, and <b>gestodene</b> classified as third-generation and newer progestins like drospirenone classified as fourth-generation. Yet another classification system considers there to be only first- and second-generation progestins.|$|E
50|$|Nandrolone, {{together}} with ethisterone (17α-ethynyltestosterone), {{is also the}} parent compound of {{a large group of}} progestins, the norethisterone (17α-ethynyl-19-nortestosterone) derivatives. This family is subdivided into two groups: the estranes and the gonanes. The estranes include norethisterone (norethindrone), norethisterone acetate, norethisterone enanthate, lynestrenol, etynodiol diacetate, and noretynodrel, while the gonanes include norgestrel, levonorgestrel, desogestrel, etonogestrel, <b>gestodene,</b> norgestimate, dienogest (actually a 17α-cyanomethyl-19-nortestosterone derivative), and norelgestromin.|$|E
50|$|Estrogens {{increase}} and androgens inhibit hepatic production of SHBG {{and by extension}} circulating SHBG levels. Clinical {{studies have found that}} norgestimate does not appreciably inhibit the increase in SHBG levels produced by ethinylestradiol, and this is in accordance with preclinical research and the notion that norgestimate is minimally androgenic. In addition, norgestimate and norelgestromin show virtually no affinity for SHBG, unlike levonorgestrel and <b>gestodene</b> (which have 87% and 202% of the relative binding affinity of testosterone for SHBG, respectively) but similarly to progesterone.|$|E
50|$|The {{different}} structural {{classes of}} progestins have different pharmacological profiles. 19-Norprogesterone and retroprogesterone derivatives {{tend to be}} pure progestogens. 17α-Hydroxyprogesterone derivatives tend to have antiandrogen and glucocorticoid properties. Notable exceptions include hydroxyprogesterone caproate, which is a pure progestogen, and medroxyprogesterone acetate, which has weak androgenic actions. 17α-Ethynyltestosterone and 19-nortestosterone derivatives tend to possess weak androgenic actions. <b>Gestodene</b> is a 19-nortestosterone derivative with antimineralocorticoid properties. 17α-Spirolactones tend to have antimineralocorticoid and antiandrogen actions. Progesterone itself has potent antimineralocorticoid properties and very weak glucocorticoid actions.|$|E
50|$|Among the {{testosterone}} derivatives, and in {{no particular}} order, levonorgestrel, norgestrel, norgestrienone, ethisterone, gestrinone, danazol, tibolone, normethandrone, and norvinisterone have the greatest androgenic activity, while norethisterone and its prodrugs (norethisterone acetate, norethisterone enanthate, lynestrenol, etynodiol diacetate, and quingestanol acetate) have moderate activity. Testosterone derivatives with low (but potentially still significant) androgenic activity include desogestrel, etonogestrel, <b>gestodene,</b> and norgestimate, while norelgestromin, noretynodrel, norgesterone, allylestrenol, and dimethisterone appear to have negligible activity. Dienogest and oxendolone are unique among the testosterone derivatives {{in that they are}} potent antiandrogens.|$|E
50|$|The overall {{absolute}} risk of venous thrombosis per 100,000 woman years in current use of combined oral contraceptives is approximately 60, compared to 30 in non-users. The risk of thromboembolism varies with {{different types of}} birth control pills; Compared with combined oral contraceptives containing levonorgestrel (LNG), and with the same dose of estrogen and duration of use, the rate ratio of deep venous thrombosis for combined oral contraceptives with norethisterone is 0.98, with norgestimate 1.19, with desogestrel (DSG) 1.82, with <b>gestodene</b> 1.86, with drospirenone (DRSP) 1.64, and with cyproterone acetate 1.88. Venous thromboembolism occurs in 100-200 per 100,000 pregnant women every year.|$|E
40|$|Recent {{experimental}} work has identified a novel intracellular binding {{site for the}} synthetic progestin, <b>Gestodene,</b> that ap-pears to be uniquely expressed in human breast cancer cells. <b>Gestodene</b> is shown here to inhibit the growth of human breast cancer cells in a dose-dependent fashion, but {{has no effect on}} endocrine-responsive human endometrial cancer cells. Gesto-dene induced a 90 -fold increase in the secretion of transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-beta) by T 47 D human breast cancer cells. Other synthetic progestins had no effect, indicating that this induction is mediated by the novel <b>Gestodene</b> binding site and not by the conventional progesterone receptor. Further-more, in four breast cancer cell lines, the extent of induction of TGF-beta correlated with intracellular levels of <b>Gestodene</b> binding site. No induction of TGF-beta was observed with the endometrial cancer line, HECI-B, which lacks the <b>Gestodene</b> binding site, but which expresses high levels of progesterone receptor. The inhibition of growth ofT 47 D cells by <b>Gestodene</b> is partly reversible by a polyclonal antiserum to TGF-beta. These data indicate that the growth-inhibitory action of Gesto-dene may be mediated in part by an autocrine induction ofTGF...|$|E

40|$|OBJECTIVE: Our {{purpose was}} to test the {{hypothesis}} that omitting the first three pills of the contraceptive cycle leads to ovulation. STUDY DESIGN: Ninety-nine women, randomly assigned to 1 of 3 treatments of combined oral contraceptives, completed the study. Treatments contained ethinyl estradiol and either monophasic <b>gestodene,</b> triphasic <b>gestodene,</b> or monophasic desogestrel. Pituitary-ovarian activity was monitored by ultrasonography of the ovaries and assay of serum concentrations of estradiol, progesterone, and follicle-stimulating hormone over 1 normal cycle (study period 1) and 1 cycle after an extended pill-free interval of 10 days (study period 2). RESULTS: None of the women experienced normal ovulation as evaluated by ultrasonography and serum progesterone concentrations. However, follicle-stimulating hormone reached a maximal serum concentration in most women during the first 7 pill-free days, indicating complete pituitary recovery, and increases in serum estradiol concentrations were seen in each woman although with marked interindividual variation. During study period 2 we found follicles of > 18 mm in 24 %, 24 %, and 40 % of the monophasic <b>gestodene,</b> triphasic <b>gestodene,</b> and monophasic desogestrel groups, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: Follicular growth up to preovulatory size is common in women missing the first one to three pills of their contraceptive cycle. Although this creates the prerequisite for ovulation, normal ovulation did not occur when pill omissions were limited to only 3 days. status: publishe...|$|E
