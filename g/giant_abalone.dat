50|$|Catanduanes reefs harbor many {{endangered}} {{and threatened}} types of mollusks such as <b>giant</b> Triton, cowries, <b>abalone,</b> cone snails, conches, octopuses, squids, and nautiluses. Marine mammals are also reported to frequent on its eastern coasts such as species of dolphins and whales which appear from March to June. Many edible marine algae such as caulerpa, valonia, and turbellaria also grow abundantly on its rough coasts.|$|R
50|$|Apart from {{salmon and}} trout, Chilean {{aquaculture}} also produces turbots and molluscs, in particular Mytilus chilensis, Northern scallops, Pacific oysters, Aulacomya ater (a <b>giant</b> mussel), red <b>abalone,</b> and Chilean oysters. In terms of algae Gracillaria chilensis is cultivated and harvested. The main areas of aquaculture in Chile {{lie in the}} southern {{half of the country}} in particular in the interior waters of Los Lagos Region {{and to a lesser extent}} the fjords and channels of more southern Aysén and Magallanes regions.|$|R
40|$|The Aquaculture Department of the Southeast Asian Fisheries Development Center (SEAFDEC/AQD) {{started its}} Stock Enhancement Program {{more than a}} decade ago with the first stock {{enhancement}} initiative on the mud crab Scylla spp. funded by the European Commission. This was followed by another stock enhancement program in 2005 supported by the Government of Japan Trust Fund. In preparation for its implementation, a Regional Technical Consultation on Stock Enhancement of Species Under International Concern was convened in Iloilo City, Philippines in July 2005 to identify species for stock enhancement. During the meeting, seahorses Hippocampus spp., giant clam Tridacna gigas, abalone Haliotis asinina, and sea cucumbers Holothuria spp. were among the priority species for stock enhancement work. Stock enhancement, restocking and ranching are management approaches involving the release of wild or hatchery-bred organisms to enhance, conserve or restore fisheries. This paper reports SEAFDEC/AQD release activities and some of the release strategies that have been established for mud crabs, <b>giant</b> clams and <b>abalone...</b>|$|R
50|$|The marine {{environment}} of Viga is also ecologically rich as its terrestrial zones. Coastal reefs harbor many endangered and threatened types of mollusks such as <b>giant</b> Triton, cowries, <b>abalone,</b> cone snails, conches, octopuses, squids, and nautiluses. Marine mammals are also reported to frequent on its coasts such as species of dolphins and whales which appear in March-June. Many edible marine algae such as caulerpa, valonia, and turbellaria also grow abundantly on its rough coasts. Viga is {{nestled in the}} very beginning of the Kuroshio Current; a sea current that runs through Eastern Philippines, Taiwan and Japan. This current performs an array of physical and biological functions in countless marine life like migration and breeding. This explains why migratory fish tracks are usually encountered in its waters. Tuna migration can be seen on its peak in the months of April and May. Dugongs were once known to swim on coasts but this event is already becoming extremely rare.|$|R
40|$|Project {{efficiency}} was enhanced {{along with}} economic savings through reduced per diem costs with the move of two project biologists to the Diablo Canyon area. A total of 765 field and laboratory man-days was spent surveying 189 intertidal, subtidal, and fishing stations, processing algae samples, and compiling data. A new subtidal study of random 1 / 4 m 2 quadrats was begun {{this year to}} better assess small invertebrates. Three new permanent intertidal stations were established in transition areas outside of Diablo Cove to monitor thermal impact on <b>abalones.</b> <b>Giant</b> red sea urchin densities continued to decline in both subtidal study areas, while densities of large brown algae continued to increase. Numbers of intertidal black and red abalones from parallel to shoreline stations showed little change. Perpendicular to shore stations yielded higher mean densities of black abalones than the parallel stations. Sea otter movements and fluctuations in monthly counts generally paralleled those of previous years. The commercial sea urchin fishery was inactive most of the year, and commercial abalone fishing effort continued to decline. No effort from either fishery was observed in Diablo Cove. Observations on natural and power plant produced foam within Diablo Cove were begun during this report period...|$|R
