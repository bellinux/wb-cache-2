5|$|Because if we'd gone to Baghdad {{we would}} have been all alone. There wouldn't have been anybody else with us. There would have been a U.S. {{occupation}} of Iraq. None of the Arab forces that were willing to fight with us in Kuwait were willing to invade Iraq. Once you got to Iraq and took it over, took down Saddam Hussein's government, then {{what are you going to}} put in its place? That's a very volatile part of the world, and if you take down the central government of Iraq, you could very easily end up seeing pieces of Iraq fly off: part of it, the Syrians would like to have to the west, part of it—eastern Iraq—the Iranians would like to claim, they fought over it for eight years. In the north you've got the Kurds, and if the Kurds spin loose and join with the Kurds in Turkey, then you threaten the territorial integrity of Turkey. It's a quagmire if you go that far and try to take over Iraq. The other thing was casualties. Everyone was impressed with the fact we were able to do our job with as few casualties as we had. But for the 146 Americans killed in action, and for their families—it wasn't a cheap war. And the question for the president, in terms of whether or not we went on to Baghdad, took additional casualties in an effort to get Saddam Hussein, was how many additional dead Americans is Saddam worth? Our judgment was, not very many, and <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>we</b> <b>got</b> it right.|$|E
500|$|In casting his crew, Fresco and {{his team}} worked fairly quickly. [...] "You don't {{have a lot of}} time to cast, unfortunately, and it's the most {{important}} thing in the show, I think." [...] says Fresco, [...] "Good casting can transcend mediocre material but the best material in the world cannot transcend the mediocre casting.

500|$|As {{the band}} entered 2016, Cain felt {{the future for}} the group was bright: [...] "We're not done yet. <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>we</b> <b>got</b> more music in us," [...] he told Substream Magazine in January 2016. Two months later the band {{announced}} their break-up with a statement that read in part, [...] "We {{have no idea what}} the future holds, but for now we are done." [...] The band embarked on the So Long, Farewell Tour across North America between May and September 2016 with original drummer Tony Thaxton returning. They performed their final, sold-out show at the Metro in Chicago on September 18, 2016. The group performed 36 songs — some dating back to their 2000 EP, Back to the Beat — while both Thaxton and Rivera sat in on drums.|$|E

5000|$|Wells led the Hoyas {{into the}} 2010 College Cup; Georgetown {{was knocked out}} by Ohio State in the quarterfinals. Georgetown head coach Dave Nolan remarked, “I thought Ingrid was {{tremendous}} tonight, she was the best player on the field, to win you probably need to have eight or nine of your players show up and have great games, and <b>I</b> don’t <b>think</b> <b>we</b> <b>got</b> that.” ...|$|R
500|$|Some People Change was Montgomery Gentry's lowest-selling album at the time. Joe Galante, then-president of Sony Music Nashville, {{thought that}} the album's poor sales were because it [...] "strayed musically from what the base had been. They have an edge to their sound, and <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>we</b> <b>got</b> a little too soft." [...] Kelefa Sanneh of The New York Times gave a mixed review, {{saying that it was}} more [...] "touchy-feely" [...] than You Do Your Thing, and that [...] "no one works a snarling country chorus like Montgomery Gentry". Chris Willman of Entertainment Weekly gave the album a [...] "C", criticizing the duo for the {{contradictory}} viewpoints of personal changes on the title track versus the [...] "defense of the American right to piss off your neighbors" [...] in [...] "What Do Ya Think About That". Jurek comparatively called it a [...] "masterpiece" [...] and said that it was [...] "a new pinnacle for the duo", calling the title track [...] "one of those tunes that defines something that {{lies at the heart of}} what is good about Americans." ...|$|E
500|$|Well, let’s see… the {{guy with}} the poodle on his head would be me. The very {{pregnant}} woman with the sunglasses is my wife Suzanne.

Tracy Berna, one of the writers for The Weird Al Show, is the waitress with the beehive hair-do. The Boy Scout is Dylan Bostick, the oldest son of one of Suzanne's oldest friends.

500|$|In March 2016, some users also {{alleged that}} their Windows 7 and 8.1 devices had {{automatically}} begun upgrading to 10 without their consent. In June 2016, the GWX dialog's behavior changed to make closing the window imply a consent to a scheduled upgrade. Despite this, an Infoworld editor disputed the claims that upgrades had begun without any consent at all; testing {{showed that the}} upgrade to Windows10 would only begin once the user accepts the end-user license agreement (EULA) presented by its installer, and that not doing so would eventually cause Windows Update to time out with an error, thus halting the installation attempt. It was concluded that these users may have unknowingly clicked the [...] "Accept" [...] prompt without full knowledge that this would begin the upgrade. In December 2016, Microsoft chief marketing officer Chris Capossela admitted {{that the company had}} [...] "gone too far", by using this tactic, stating that [...] "we know we want people to be running Windows 10 from a security perspective, but finding the right balance where you’re not stepping over the line of being too aggressive is something we tried and {{for a lot of the}} year <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>we</b> <b>got</b> it right." ...|$|E
5000|$|In a March 21, 2012, interview, Milch {{was asked}} if the movies would ever be {{produced}} and replied, [...] "No, <b>I</b> don’t <b>think</b> so. <b>We</b> <b>got</b> really close about a year ago. Never say never, but it doesn’t look that way." ...|$|R

And I just fixated on that." [...] — Ken Levine ...|$|R
5000|$|Jac Holzman stated:"I {{loved that}} group. They were a {{fascinating}} group, a wonderful band, and I thought the records were wonderful. <b>I</b> <b>think</b> our mistake was not {{bringing them to}} the States, because they really needed {{to get out of}} England. There was too much other stuff competing in England, and in the States, we might have had an easier time.

60|$|I {{must have}} given him the letter myself, for I have no {{recollection}} of parting with it before, but I only remember his offering me his hand, and making me shyly and tentatively welcome. After {{a few moments of}} the demoralization which followed his hospitable attempts in me, he asked if I would not like to go up on his hill with him and sit there, where he smoked in the afternoon. He offered me a cigar, and when I said that I did not smoke, he lighted it for himself, and we climbed the hill together. At the top, where there was an outlook in the pines over the Concord meadows, we found a log, and he invited me to a place on it beside him, and at intervals of a minute or so he talked while he smoked. Heaven preserved me from the folly of trying to tell him how much his books had been to me, and though we got on rapidly at no time, <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>we</b> <b>got</b> on better for this interposition. He asked me about Lowell, I dare say, for I told him of my joy in meeting him and Doctor Holmes, and this seemed greatly to interest him. Perhaps because he was so lately from Europe, where our great men are always seen through the wrong end of the telescope, he appeared surprised at my devotion, and asked me whether I cared as much for meeting them as I should care for meeting the famous English authors. I professed that I cared much more, though whether this was true, I now have my doubts, and I think Hawthorne doubted it at the time. But he said nothing in comment, and went on to speak generally of Europe and America. He was curious about the West, which be seemed to fancy much more purely American, and {{said he would like to}} see some part of the country on which the shadow (or, if I must be precise, the damned shadow) of Europe had not fallen. I told him I thought the West must finally be characterized by the Germans, whom we had in great numbers, and, purely from my zeal for German poetry, I tried to allege some proofs of their present influence, though I could think of none outside of politics, which I thought they affected wholesomely. I knew Hawthorne was a Democrat, and I felt it well to touch politics lightly, but he had no more to say about the fateful election then pending than Holmes or Lowell had.|$|E

5000|$|Three weeks later, Extreme Choice won the Group 1 Blue Diamond Stakes, {{with another}} Mick Price-trained horse, Flying Artie coming second. In his first race at 1200m, he {{collected}} $914,500 {{in the race}} for two-year-olds. Price said, [...] "all credit to Extreme Choice. Today was the day where he had an opportunity to really stand up. <b>I</b> <b>think</b> today <b>we</b> <b>got</b> a lot of information about the horse and we're off to the Golden Slipper." [...] As a result of the win, the horse immediately entered favouritism for the race.|$|R
5000|$|Drummer Morrison later said, [...] "This is my {{favourite}} album. This is a really, really fabulous album. We {{produced this}} ourselves and it's {{got the best}} songs, and <b>I</b> <b>think</b> every single song is a classic.

"In {{the last}} year or so I had a bit of a {{confidence}} crash. <b>I</b> <b>think</b> just because <b>we</b> <b>got</b> a lot more popular very quickly - which isn’t to say we suddenly reached Bon Jovi status, but lots more people tuned in - that meant the scrutiny was a lot higher and people would come to shows with such high expectations" [...] —Lenman ...|$|R

5000|$|The {{album was}} {{produced}} by Shaun O'Callaghan (John Butler Trio, Eskimo Joe) who had produced the band's previous two EPs. Gyroscope vocalist and guitarist Daniel Sanders says on the Festival Mushroom Records website. [...] "The music that drove us the most were albums like Weezer's debut, or Foo Fighters The Colour and the Shape. They were more of an adventure rather than just being a 40-minute album. <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>we</b> <b>got</b> there in the end." ...|$|E
5000|$|... "The Hounds of Anubis" [...] was solely {{written by}} the two guitarists, Zack Hansen and Tony Pizzuti. It was {{explained}} that they [...] "wrote this song with an [...] "Egyptian" [...] feel to it and <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>we</b> <b>got</b> our point across." [...] The guitar solo for the song is performed by both Hansen and Pizzuti, whom always alternate solos, and like [...] "Battle Royale", it is played after the second verse and before the song's only breakdown.|$|E
500|$|The {{series was}} officially {{canceled}} by ABC on May 13, 2010. In {{an interview with}} New York Magazine, Victor Fresco, the show's creator, was asked why he thought the show didn't catch on. He responded, [...] "I think not enough people knew about it. It wasn’t like {{we had a lot}} of people watch it and they didn’t come back to it. If anything, <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>we</b> were building slowly, but to me the way TV works is you spend a lot of money advertising and promoting, or you have to let a show stay some place for a long period of time and an audience slowly comes to it. And <b>I</b> don’t <b>think</b> <b>we</b> <b>got</b> either of that". Fresco also added, [...] "I still feel there’s an audience out there for it, because I know that the people who liked it, liked it a lot." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "We {{have known}} for some time that a clever gang was at work," [...] said the inspector. [...] "They have been turning out half-crowns by the thousand. We even traced them as far as Reading, but could get no farther, for they had covered their traces in a way that showed that they were very old hands. But now, thanks to this lucky chance, <b>I</b> <b>think</b> that <b>we</b> have <b>got</b> them right enough." ...|$|R
5000|$|Vocalist Simon Le Bon commented [...] "We {{went into}} a barn in Sussex and started jamming away, and before <b>we</b> <b>got</b> finished, it was like, 'Right we've got the album, let's go and record it now.' And <b>I</b> don't <b>think</b> <b>we</b> <b>got</b> it right; <b>I</b> don't <b>think</b> <b>we</b> were paying enough attention. We were quite {{self-conscious}} {{at the time as}} well, the way things had been going, and it kind of made us stand outside of ourselves to do the album. But out of that came two of the best songs Duran's ever come up with, 'Serious' and 'My Antarctica,' they're really, really beautiful songs. <b>I</b> don't <b>think</b> it's a bad album, but there's definitely weak spots on it, definitely. I mean, something like 'Violence of Summer,' it just didn't have a proper chorus, great verse though. Just not paying enough attention, we just lost our concentration." ...|$|R
5000|$|However, the show's {{popularity}} dissolved very quickly. As the Associated Press put it, Joe Millionaire [...] "has {{gone from}} one of TV’s most surprising successes to the new season’s most spectacular flameout." [...] FOX’s entertainment chair Sandy Grushow said, [...] "Our instincts told us {{from the very beginning}} that Joe Millionaire was a one-time stunt and <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>we</b> <b>got</b> greedy." [...] He added, [...] "We tried to sneak it by the American public a second time and we got called on it." ...|$|E
5000|$|Despite being 20 years Bukowski's junior, {{they got}} along, despite the senior poet's aversion to [...] "academics". [...] <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>we</b> <b>got</b> along because we shared many attitudes—towards women, towards writing, towards drinking, towards sports, towards people we liked or disliked—in {{spite of my}} being an “academic,” and the 20 years {{difference}} in our ages, and the differences in our upbringings, we were not all that different at the core. And I liked his work a lot and did a lot to promote it.|$|E
5000|$|Wynorski {{says the}} Argentinian {{producers}} [...] "didn’t {{want to spend}} any money on this production, and {{it was difficult to}} get them to pony up a little money for extras or anything, but, you know, Roger kept calling up and saying, you owe me this, give it to the guy - and again, we were trying to be fun, without {{spending a lot of money}} and <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>we</b> <b>got</b> away with it, a lot of people enjoyed the movie because it doesn’t take itself seriously at all. It’s a comedy with action." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "The story club isn't in {{existence}} any longer. We hadn't time for it--and anyhow <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>we</b> had <b>got</b> tired of it. It was silly {{to be writing}} about love and murder and elopements and mysteries. Miss Stacy sometimes has us write a story for training in composition, but she won't let us write anything but what might happen in Avonlea in our own lives, and she criticizes it very sharply and makes us criticize our own too. I never thought my compositions had so many faults until I began {{to look for them}} myself. I felt so ashamed I wanted to give up altogether, but Miss Stacy said I could learn to write well if I only trained myself to be my own severest critic. And so I am trying to." ...|$|R
5000|$|... "I {{thought of}} this track name and I knew I had to name a track this. Its way more electro than {{anything}} else on the album but again, I just liked it so I kept it anyway. <b>I</b> <b>think</b> a rock band need to cover this, because this song {{should have been a}} punk song, not some weird rap singing thing. This was actually {{going to be the first}} single off the album but <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>we</b> all <b>got</b> a bit scared that people would <b>think</b> <b>Id</b> gone crazy and forgot about rap music so we went with Right Now instead. I just realised recently that “God starve the Queen, run around” sounds like Im forcing a girl to go on a diet. But it was intended to be a starvation of power, not food. Keep the junk in yo trunk, gurl." ...|$|R
5000|$|In an {{interview}} with AllHipHop in March 2010, Dash confirmed that a video for the song would be shot {{near the end of}} the month. Later, Dash told MTV News, [...] "The video is going to speak for itself, <b>I</b> <b>think,</b> because <b>we</b> <b>got</b> a lot of summertime things going on. Hopefully it'll be the video of the summer and next summer and the summer after that. It didn't even seem like we were shooting a video," [...] Dash said. [...] "It really was like we was just out there having fun and the cameras just happened to be there." [...] The video features Dash in scenes with flashy cars, bikes, and riding a jet ski. Mawuse Ziegbe of MTV News referred to the video as having a [...] "visual smorgasbord of summertime stuntin".|$|R
5000|$|Gerhardt commented: [...] "I {{think that}} the Women’s Movement was an {{unfinished}} revolution. We ended up joining the working world as defined by men and struggling to live on its terms. <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>we</b> <b>got</b> stuck in trying {{to live up to}} male-defined expectations. That world (including male-dominated governments) didn’t (and still doesn’t) take into account the fact that babies or small children need very personal one-to-one care. Because we were so determined to escape domesticity, I think we feminists had a bit of a blind spot around children’s emotional needs and ignored this uncomfortable fact." ...|$|E
50|$|On the {{official}} Hundred Reasons message board, guitarist Paul Townsend {{responded to a}} poll asking which of the bands first albums were better: I think this topic might be easier to answer if I wasnt in the band. Both albums had there ups and downs, good and bad memories. I was much more confident with Shatterproof. With Ideas we were doing everything for the first time, we learned a lot. With Shatterproof we were so keen to move forward we never really focused on the things we got right (silly buggers). <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>we</b> <b>got</b> bits right on both albums, but naturally not everything. So again, we learned a lot.|$|E
5000|$|Frank Rigney was an {{outstanding}} offensive tackle for Winnipeg. During his 10-year stint from 1958 to 1967, Winnipeg won the Grey Cup four times, in 1958, 1959, 1961, and 1962. Winnipeg also participated {{and lost in}} 1965, the so-called Wind Bowl. [...] "The first year we got a tie clasp from the city.

[...] Anthony Gerrard, who missed the decisive penalty took to Twitter to apologise to Cardiff fans stating that the miss would [...] "...haunt {{me for the rest of}} my days!" [...] Despite Gerrard's apology, Cardiff goalkeeper Tom Heaton was adamant that none of the players should take the blame for the defeat: [...] "There is {{definitely}} no blame attached to any of the lads who missed. They all had the strength of character to stand up and take a penalty in front of 90,000 people and the world watching in a pressure situation. They should be credited and congratulated for taking them. Sadly, it wasn’t our day.” ...|$|R
5000|$|On 13 March 2014, Henderson {{made his}} first start in a {{competitive}} game in an away league match at Kilmarnock.
