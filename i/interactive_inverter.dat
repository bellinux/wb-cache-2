40|$|The annual world {{photovoltaic}} (PV) cell/module {{production is}} growing at almost an exponential rate and has reached 1727 MW in 2005. Building integrated PV (BIPV) projects are emerging as the strongest part of the PV market and grid <b>interactive</b> <b>inverters</b> are a key component in determining the total system cost. Module integrated converter (MIC) technology has become a global trend in grid interactive PV applications and may assist in driving down the balance of system costs to secure an improved total system cost. This paper concentrates on the topology study of the PV MICs in the power range below 500 W and covers most topologies recently proposed for MIC applications. The MIC topologies are classified into three different arrangements based on the dc link configurations. A systematic discussion is also provided {{at the end of}} the paper that focuses on the major advantages and disadvantages of each MIC arrangement.

40|$|Abstract—This paper {{presents}} a novel photovoltaic inverter {{that can not}} only synchronize a sinusoidal ac output current with a utility line voltage, but also control the power generation of each photovoltaic module in an array. The proposed inverter system is composed of a half-bridge inverter at the utility interface and a novel generation control circuit which compensates for reduc-tions in the output power {{of the system that}} are attributable to variations in the generation conditions of respective photovoltaic modules. The generation control circuit allows each photovoltaic module to operate independently at peak capacity, simply by de-tecting the output power of the system. Furthermore, the genera-tion control circuit attenuates low-frequency ripple voltage, which is caused by the half-bridge inverter, across the photovoltaic mod-ules. Consequently, the output power of system is increased due to the increase in average power generated by the photovoltaic mod-ules. The effectiveness of the proposed inverter system is confirmed experimentally and by means of simulation.

These AC PV modules offer the important advantage that customers may now purchase a PV system without hiring a design engineer. A qualified electrician will be able to install a complete PV system that performs as expected and meets local electrical codes. Simple installations of additional AC PV modules will be possible once the proper branch circuit wiring and protection have been installed.

40|$|Abstract—In recent years, {{interest}} in natural energy {{has grown in}} response to increased concern for the environment. Many kinds of inverter circuits and their control schemes for photovoltaic (PV) power generation systems have been studied. A conventional system employs a PV array in which many PV modules are connected in series to obtain sufficient dc input voltage for generating ac utility line voltage from an inverter circuit. However, the total power generated from the PV array is sometimes decreased remarkably when only a few modules are partially covered by shadows, thereby decreasing inherent current generation, and preventing the generation current from attaining its maximum value on the array. To overcome this drawback, an ac module strategy has been proposed. In this system, a low-power dc–ac utility <b>interactive</b> <b>inverter</b> is individually mounted on each PV module and operates so as to generate the maximum power fro...|$|E
40|$|Abstract — The {{main focus}} {{of this article is to}} {{investigate}} the effects of Adaptive control on the switching frequency and Total Harmonic Distortion of a modified, minimally switched hysteresis controlled shunt active power filter. Reference current generation was done using Instantaneous real and reactive power algorithm. Pulses to the minimally switched grid <b>interactive</b> <b>inverter</b> in which only two switches are controlled at a time, had been generated using a modified hysteresis current controller. Use of Modified Hysteresis controller results in reducing the switching loses to one-third but results in increase in current THD than the conventional hysteresis controller. To overcome this, pulses to the modified hysteresis controller were generated employing adaptive control by modifying pulses from a conventional hysteresis controller. Using adaptive control instantaneous switching frequency was reduced and maintained nearly constant and THD was brought to the limits specified by the standards, thus overcoming the disadvantage of conventional and modified hysteresis controller which has variable switching frequency. A comparison of Modified Hysteresis controller with and without Adaptive control has been made, to show the reduction in THD. The system was simulated using MATLAB-SIMULINK...|$|E

In contrast to the conventional control strategy, with the proposed UTVCS, both the inverter control and the operation mode of MG are considered, hence the method in this paper has advantages in improving the MG power quality and it is simply realized.

40|$|This thesis {{presents}} a control strategy for a three-phase grid <b>interactive</b> voltage source <b>inverter</b> (VSI) that links a {{renewable energy source}} to the utility grid through a LCL-type filter. An optimized LCL-type filter has been designed and implemented so as to reduce the current harmonics in the grid considering the conduction and switching losses at constant modulation index (Ma). The control strategy adopted here decouples the active and reactive power loops, thus achieving desirable performance with independent control of active and reactive power injected to the grid. The startup transients are also controlled by the implementation of this particular control method. Another control technique has also been studied so as to overcome the hitches faced by the conventional controllers. It counterbalances the distortions in grid voltage by injecting sinusoidal current into the grid. The filter has been designed considering the conduction and switching copper losses as well as core losses. A tradeoff has been made between the total losses due to the inductor and the THD% of the grid current, and the filter inductor has been designed accordingly. In order to study the dynamic performance {{of the system and}} to confirm the analytical results, the models are simulated in the MATLAB/Simulink environment and the results are analyzed...|$|R
40|$|The {{objective}} of the North Carolina's PV Bonus Team was to develop and demonstrate a commercially viable, building-integrated, photovoltaic system that, {{in addition to providing}} electricity, would capture and effectively utilize the thermal energy produced by the photovoltaic array. This project objective was successfully achieved by designing, testing, constructing, and monitoring two roof integrated photovoltaic systems [...] one on a Applebee's Restaurant in Salisbury, North Carolina and the second on a Central Carolina Bank in Bessemer City, North Carolina. The goal of Innovative Design is to now use these successful demonstrations to facilitate entry of building integrated, pv/thermal systems into the marketplace. The strategy was to develop the two systems that could be utilized in future applications. Both systems were designed and then constructed at the North Carolina Solar Center at North Carolina State University. After extensive testing at the North Carolina Solar Center, the systems were moved to the actual construction sites and implemented. The Applebee's Restaurant system was designed to substitute for the roof assembly of a low sloping, south-facing sunspace roof that typically incorporated clay tile. After monitoring the installed system for one year it was determined that the 1. 2 kilowatt (peak) system produces an average peak reduction of 1 kilowatt (rated peak is 1. 7 kiloWatts), saves 1, 529 kilowatt-hours of electricity, and offsets 11, 776 kilowatt-hours of thermal energy savings used to pre-heat water. A DC fan connected directly to eight of the thirty-two amorphous modules moves air through air passages mounted on the backside of the modules and into a closed loop duct system to a heat exchanger. This heat exchanger is, in turn, connected to a pre-heat hot water tank that is used to heat the water for the restaurant. The Central Carolina Bank system was designed to substitute for the roof assembly of the drive-in window area of the bank. The design featured a triangulated truss that incorporated ten crystalline photovoltaic modules {{on one side of the}} truss and a reflective panel on the opposite side. The system used a utility <b>interactive,</b> programmable <b>inverter</b> and a 18. 9 kilowatt-hour battery bank. The system is designed so that a DC fan, connected to one of the modules, forces ambient air across the back side of the modules. In the summer this heat is vented to the outside but in the winter this heated, fresh air is introduced into the building as ventilation air. Like the Applebee's system, the design allowed the entire roof assembly to be constructed off-site, tested, and then shipped to the site in pie-assembled, large components. During the first full year of operation, the 2. 2 kilowatt (rated peak is 2. 7 kilowatts) system contributed to an average peak reduction of. 9 kilowatts. The system, as designed, saves 2, 576 kilowatt-hours of electricity and offsets 3, 473 kilowatt hours (of a potential thermal benefit of 10, 172 collected kWhs) of thermal energy savings that is used as fresh air make-up in the colder months. This report is a summary of their conclusions...|$|R
40|$|Abstract—Photovoltaic modules must {{generally}} be connected in series {{in order to}} produce the voltage required to efficiently drive an inverter. However, if even a very small part of photovoltaic module (PV module) is prevented from receiving light, the generation power of the PV module is decreased disproportionately. This greater than expected decrease occurs because PV modules which do not receive adequate light cannot operate on the normal operating point, but rather operate as loads. As a result, the total power from the PV modules is decreased if even {{only a small part of}} the PV modules are shaded. In the present paper, a novel circuit, referred to as the generation control circuit (GCC), which enables maximum power to be obtained from all of the PV modules even if some of the modules are prevented from receiving light. The proposed circuit enables the individual PV modules to operate effectively at the maximum power point tracking, irrespective of the series connected PV module system. In addition, the total generated power is shown experimentally to increase for the experimental set-up used in the present study.
