40|$|A {{damage of}} the {{assimilation}} apparatus of forest woody species due to anthropogenous {{effects can be}} characterised {{by means of an}} analysis of the condition of epicuticular waxes. The structure and amounts of epicuticular waxes on the surface of leaves and needles responds very quickly to environmental changes and indicate the damage of assimilation apparatus already in the latent, initial stages. At present, the damage of forest stands by elevated concentrations of ground-level ozone is one of the Pan-European problems. The most endangered are the forest stands situated in subalpine regions at altitudes above 850 m; here, the measured concentrations of ground-level ozone were very high and this was manifested in a decrease and the destruction of epicuticular waxes {{on the one hand and}} the occurrence of necrotic spots on the needle surface on the other. The most intensive degradation of epicuticular waxes was observed in Norway spruce (Picea abies /L. / Karst.) forest stands in the Krušné hory mountains while in the Beskydy mountains, a very small damage was observed only in the latent stage what corresponds with the measured values of ozone concentration. A strong correlation between the ozone concentration and amount of epicuticular waxes were found on six investigated location across The Czech Republic.

Crown-ethers impaired growth and reproduction of Daphnia and unicellular Algae at 5 and 10 mg/l concentrations and caused toxic action upon tissue cellular culture (J 929, X- 63, Hep- 2, Vero) and buccal epithelium at 0. 05 and 0. 5 mg/l concentrations.

Our aim was to present several statistical methods used in practice for sales forecasting and demonstrate the limitation of their use. Scientific aim: The main scientific aim {{of this paper is to}} answer following questions: Will the use of error function, presented in literature, lead to choosing the most accurate method for sales forecasting? Even under the situation of unstable development of the company’s environment. How accurate is possible to calculate the business value? Methodology/methods: For creating a sale prognosis we used basic statistical methods e. g. time series and regression analysis using one dimensional model. For forecast error evaluation we used following error function: mean error, mean square error, Spearman’s coefficient, <b>index</b> <b>of</b> <b>determination,</b> Thiel’s index and so on. For calculating business value we used the DCF entity and EVA/MVA entity model. Findings: The method selected on the basis of error functions, presented in literature, lead to largest forecast error among presented methods. Under the situation of sustainable development of environment, this error function has a limited used. Conclusions_ We agree with Little, Damodaran, Makridakis, Taleb ho claim that the forecast of sales based on historical data could not lead to most accurate results.

40|$|Engine {{power is}} a {{fundamental}} parameter for determining the utilization of an agricultural tractor. A wrong combination of a tractor and agricultural machinery leads to non-efficient loading of the engine, which causes not only a waste of energy stored in the fuel but also increased financial cost of production. The presented paper focuses on the possibility to calculate engine power from the data, which {{are available on the}} digital bus – CAN-BUS. Choosing the appropriate parameters together with the proposed model can help represent the instantaneous power needs. The messages, which provide the basic information about the load, are as follows: engine load, instantaneous torque, instantaneous fuel consumption, engine speed and a set of correction channels. These channels bring the cluster of temperatures and pressures of engine fluids, mainly of the fuel and engine lubricating oil. Without prior determination of the regression function, the data, especially in low load, are very different from the actual torque generated by the engine and measured by a dynamometer. The model represents a function of surface features with a very high <b>index</b> <b>of</b> <b>determination.</b> The model was verified by measuring the power of the engine on a dynamometer. Validation of the model in practice was carried out in the field. The tractor was connected with combined cultivator.

In reality, accuracy of the enhanced amplitude in relation to earthquakes (deduced from time-varied geomagnetic data) would be damaged by magnetic storms and/or other unwanted influences resulting from solar activity and/or variations in the ionosphere, respectively. We substitute values of the cross correlation between amplitudes, summarized from the earthquake-related (0. 1 – 0. 01 Hz) and the comparable (0. 01 – 0. 001 Hz) frequency bands, for isolated amplitude enhancements as <b>indexes</b> <b>of</b> <b>determination</b> associated with seismo-magnetic anomalies to mitigate disturbance caused by magnetic storms.

A statistical test is developed {{for the detection of}} a nonzero discrete coefficient <b>of</b> <b>determination</b> (CoD) between predictor and target variables. This is done by framing the problem {{in the context of a}} stochastic logic model that naturally allows the inclusion of prior knowledge if available. The rejection region, p-value, statistical power, and confidence interval are derived and analyzed. Furthermore, the issue of multiplicity of tests due to presence of numerous candidate genes and logic relationships is addressed via FWER- and FDR-controlling approaches. The methodology is demonstrated by experiments using synthetic data and real data from a study on ionizing radiation (IR) -responsive genes. The results indicate that the proposed methodology is a promising tool for detection of gene regulatory relationships from gene-expression data.

40|$|This paper {{concerns}} some indices {{which have}} been introduced in the literature {{in order to measure}} some typical aspects {{of the structure of the}} ARMA processes. Specifically, it refers to the coefficient <b>of</b> <b>determination</b> <b>of</b> a stationary process, the coefficient <b>of</b> <b>determination</b> <b>of</b> the corresponding inverse process and a measure of linear determinism. In this article we show some interesting relationships between those measures and the spectrum and discuss the implications of a decomposition <b>of</b> the <b>index</b> <b>of</b> linear determinism. Finally, we propose two alternative procedures to produce a geometrical representation of ARMA processes which can be applied for comparing real time series...|$|R
