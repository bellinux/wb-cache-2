5000|$|The Public Access Scheme (a.k.a. [...] "Direct Access") allows {{members of}} the public in England & Wales to <b>instruct</b> <b>a</b> <b>barrister</b> directly. In the past, it was {{necessary}} for clients to use a solicitor or other third party in order to <b>instruct</b> <b>a</b> <b>barrister.</b>|$|E
5000|$|The Public Access Scheme (or 'Direct Access') enables {{consumers}} of legal services to <b>instruct</b> <b>a</b> <b>barrister</b> directly. The main {{advantage of the}} Scheme for consumers {{is the opportunity to}} save legal costs by avoiding the incurrence of solicitor’s professional fees. However, removing solicitors from running a legal case often requires that clients themselves perform a considerable amount of document management, filing, and other related activities in the context of conducting litigation. Moreover, the current Public Access rules provide that barristers are not allowed to take on public access clients unless doing so is in both the client’s best interests and in the interests of justice. [...] Therefore, in complicated cases barristers must recommend to clients that they obtain external support from a solicitor or a PALS provider.|$|E
5000|$|The [...] "Brief" [...] of {{the title}} refers to the {{document}} which a solicitor in the UK court system writes to <b>instruct</b> <b>a</b> <b>barrister</b> who will plead the solicitor's case in court. Unfortunately barristers Tony Stevens and Frances Pilbright, as juniors, receive nothing but routine briefs concerning sewers. When a juicy brief concerning a writ for [...] "restitution of conjugal rights" [...] appears, they take opposite sides in the case. Pilbright works fiercely for her client, a woman whose marriage was disrupted by World War II. Stevens advocates for the other side, a man who denies that he was ever married to the plaintiff, although all records have been destroyed during bombing raids. For her part, the woman claims that her husband left her after she temporarily lost her memory. The two barristers squabble in court, inevitably becoming attracted {{to each other in}} the process.|$|E
50|$|At hearings, {{asylum seekers}} and would-be {{immigrants}} are usually, but not invariably, represented by legal representatives including barristers, advocates, solicitors, and those {{registered with the}} Office of the Immigration Service Commissioner. The UK government is usually represented by Home Office Presenting Officers ("HOPOs"); specially trained Civil Servants. For some significant cases, the Home Office <b>instructs</b> <b>a</b> <b>barrister</b> from TSol to conduct the case.|$|R
50|$|In England and Wales, a {{litigant}} {{in person}} is an individual, company or organisation that has rights of audience (this is, {{the right to}} address the court) and is not represented {{in a court of}} England and Wales by <b>a</b> solicitor or <b>barrister.)</b> <b>Instructing</b> <b>a</b> <b>barrister</b> and not <b>a</b> solicitor, for example through the Public Access Scheme, however, does not prevent the party on whose behalf the barrister had been <b>instructed</b> from being <b>a</b> litigant in person.|$|R
2500|$|E. N. Molesworth, {{the coroner}} for Rochdale, {{was obliged to}} {{investigate}} all cases of [...] "unnatural" [...] death, and Dr Joss's diagnosis of [...] "asbestos poisoning" [...] led Molesworth to launch a formal inquest on 14 March 1924, which was adjourned awaiting an autopsy, to be conducted by Dr F.W. Mackichan. Mackichan gave {{the cause of death}} as [...] "pulmonary tuberculosis and heart failure" [...] but a further adjournment was granted for microscopic examination of the lungs. When the inquest was resumed on 1 April 1924 Turner Brothers <b>instructed</b> <b>a</b> <b>barrister,</b> Mr. McCleary, and their solicitor G.L. Collins, of Jackson & Co., to attend in order to represent their interests and to [...] "evade any financial liability for Mrs. Kershaw's death." ...|$|R
50|$|Anne Schofield <b>instructed</b> <b>a</b> local <b>barrister</b> Charles Gomez {{to launch}} a libel lawsuit against Bar Association Chairman James Neish for making {{allegedly}} defamatory statements. Charles Gomez, having earlier ended his representation of her, she subsequently withdrew this lawsuit and now faces paying a substantial costs order made against her by the Supreme Court. This led to a bankruptcy notice issued against her, but proceedings have not commenced.|$|R
5000|$|The {{difference}} between [...] "Barrister" [...] and [...] "Counsel" [...] is subtle. [...] "Barrister" [...] {{is a professional}} title awarded {{by one of the}} four Inns of Court, and is used in <b>a</b> <b>barrister's</b> private, academic or professional capacity. [...] "Counsel" [...] is used to refer to <b>a</b> <b>barrister</b> who is <b>instructed</b> on <b>a</b> particular case. It is customary to use the third person when addressing <b>a</b> <b>barrister</b> <b>instructed</b> on <b>a</b> case: [...] "Counsel is asked to advise" [...] rather than [...] "You are asked to advise".|$|R
50|$|A {{minority}} of cases are prosecuted by {{other law enforcement}} agencies, such as English local authorities, Welsh local authorities, the Department for Work and Pensions or the Health and Safety Executive, or private prosecutors such as the RSPCA or the BBC in its capacity as the TV licensing authority. Private individuals are also entitled to bring a private prosecution, this happens most commonly where an individual is an alleged victim of common assault and the authorities have declined to prosecute. Private prosecutors can either represent themselves, or they may <b>instruct</b> <b>a</b> solicitor or <b>barrister</b> to represent them. The Crown Prosecution Service however retains a power {{to take over a}} private prosecution, under section 6(2) of the Prosecution of Offences Act 1985, either to continue or discontinue it, it is however CPS policy to only exercise this power if the prosecution should be stopped because it doesn't meet the requirements of the Code for Crown Prosecutors, or there are important reasons why the prosecution should be pursued by the CPS.|$|R

50|$|In law, a {{chambers}} is a room {{or office}} used by <b>barristers</b> or <b>a</b> judge. <b>A</b> <b>barrister's</b> chambers or barristers' chambers are the rooms used by <b>a</b> <b>barrister</b> or <b>a</b> group of <b>barristers.</b> <b>A</b> judge's chambers, {{on the other}} hand, is {{the office of a}} judge, where the judge may hear certain types of cases, instead of in open court.|$|R

5000|$|After gaining ten years' {{experience}} as <b>a</b> <b>barrister</b> or government counsel in Hong Kong, <b>a</b> <b>barrister</b> admitted in Hong Kong may apply {{to become a}} Senior Counsel (S.C.). [...] Time in practice as <b>a</b> <b>barrister</b> or lawyer in another jurisdiction or as a solicitor {{in private practice in}} Hong Kong does not count. [...] The Law Society of Hong Kong has called for this to be changed, so that solicitors may also be appointed Senior Counsel.|$|R
25|$|Despite its name, Section IV also {{contains}} provisions referring to barristers. Before {{the passing of}} the act there was no contractual relationship between <b>a</b> <b>barrister</b> and the <b>instructing</b> solicitor, or between <b>a</b> <b>barrister</b> and his client. This made it very difficult to obtain damages or recover money if there was <b>a</b> problem. <b>A</b> <b>barrister</b> was paid only as a matter of honour—there was no contract requiring that he be paid for his services, and no way of gaining his fee if he was not. The way that the legal profession got around this was by making it an act of professional misconduct for a solicitor not to pay the fees of <b>a</b> <b>barrister</b> in <b>a</b> case.|$|R
