50|$|The <b>Shore</b> <b>Line</b> Railway was {{merged into}} the New York, New Haven and Hartford Railroad on March 17, 1897, {{becoming}} its <b>Shore</b> <b>Line</b> Division. In 1969 the New Haven merged into Penn Central, {{and then at}} the latest the <b>Shore</b> <b>Line</b> was extended along the whole New York City-Boston route. In 1976, Penn Central merged into Conrail, and Amtrak bought much of the <b>Shore</b> <b>Line,</b> now known as the Northeast Corridor, including the former <b>Shore</b> <b>Line</b> Railway. <b>Shore</b> <b>Line</b> East now provides commuter rail service between New Haven and New London, connecting at New Haven to Metro-North's New Haven Line for continuing service to New York City.|$|R

When the Hartford Line begins {{operations}} in 2018, these six units, {{along with all}} other current <b>Shore</b> <b>Line</b> East equipment, will be moved into service on that line. M8 electric multiple units will replace locomotive-hauled trains in <b>Shore</b> <b>Line</b> East service.|$|R

50|$|Four lines serving commuters {{in three}} major cities lasted into the 1960s: the North <b>Shore</b> <b>Line</b> and the South <b>Shore</b> <b>Line</b> in Chicago, the Philadelphia Suburban Transportation Company, and the Long Beach Line in Long Beach and Los Angeles (the last {{remaining}} {{part of the}} Pacific Electric system). The Long Beach Line was cut in 1961, the North <b>Shore</b> <b>Line</b> in 1963, and the Philadelphia Suburban's route 103 in 1966.|$|R
5000|$|Miller is a {{train station}} in Gary, Indiana, serving the South <b>Shore</b> <b>Line</b> {{commuter}} rail system. It serves the community of Miller Beach {{and is one of}} three South <b>Shore</b> <b>Line</b> stations within the municipal boundaries of Gary.|$|R
50|$|After 1932 the {{original}} Lavender Bay station became a storage depot for electric trains, {{and the line}} connecting Lavender Bay to the North <b>Shore</b> <b>line</b> was reduced to single track. This line joins the current North <b>Shore</b> <b>line</b> at Waverton station.|$|R
2500|$|The Chicago North Shore and Milwaukee Railroad, {{also known}} as the North <b>Shore</b> <b>Line,</b> was an {{interurban}} railroad that served the northern Chicago metropolitan area, and southeastern Wisconsin. The North <b>Shore</b> <b>Line</b> provided electric freight and passenger service between the Chicago Loop and downtown Milwaukee. The high standard to which the railroad was built, in conjunction with its fast operating speeds and streamlined Electroliner service, led author and rail historian William D. Middleton to deem the North <b>Shore</b> <b>Line</b> a [...] "super interurban".|$|R
50|$|The South <b>Shore</b> <b>Line</b> began {{stopping}} at 57th Street on October 16, 1966, at noon. Prior to this, the South <b>Shore</b> <b>Line</b> had stopped at 53rd Street. The switch {{was made to}} better serve the University of Chicago and the Museum of Science and Industry.|$|R
50|$|Hegewisch is the South <b>Shore</b> <b>Line's</b> easternmost stop in Chicago and {{the last}} one in Illinois outbound, and offers pay parking. It is the only Illinois station on the South <b>Shore</b> <b>Line</b> not shared with the Metra Electric Line. There is a unique {{arrangement}} at the station as far as fares are concerned: although this station is a South <b>Shore</b> <b>Line</b> stop and the tracks are owned by NICTD, the station and the parking lots are actually owned by Metra and thus subject to Metra's fares, because the station is within the state of Illinois. Thus, when the South <b>Shore</b> <b>Line</b> adjusts its fares, the fares for Hegewisch do not change, but if Metra adjusts its fares, the fares at Hegewisch are adjusted accordingly.|$|R

500|$|<b>Shore</b> <b>Line</b> East service {{began on}} May 29, 1990, with four trains each {{direction}} {{during the morning}} and evening. The service carried the Clamdigger name during planning; [...] "Shore Line East" [...] did not appear until shortly before service began. <b>Shore</b> <b>Line</b> East was threatened to be cut in 1991 by newly elected Governor Lowell Weicker, but it proved more popular than expected, and was effectively made permanent. A 1996 study found that <b>Shore</b> <b>Line</b> East captured 8% of regional commuter trips and attracted a loyal ridership base.|$|R
50|$|After the Beacon Hill was {{canceled}} in 1981, the Connecticut Department of Transportation began {{planning for a}} return of commuter service in southern Connecticut. <b>Shore</b> <b>Line</b> East service began between Old Saybrook and New Haven in May 1990, and was extended to New London in February 1996. <b>Shore</b> <b>Line</b> East serves mostly the same station stops as the original Clamdigger, but thanks to modernized equipment and higher frequency {{it has been more}} successful. <b>Shore</b> <b>Line</b> East currently operates 15 trains in each direction daily on weekdays, and 9-10 trains each direction on weekends.|$|R
50|$|Foster {{was served}} by trains of the Chicago North Shore and Milwaukee Railroad on the <b>Shore</b> <b>Line</b> Route. Like Noyes and Central, Foster had an {{additional}} side platform {{to the west}} of the southbound track for exclusive use of the North <b>Shore</b> <b>Line,</b> to prevent disembarking customers from transferring to 'L' trains for free. The platform was removed sometime after the North <b>Shore</b> <b>Line</b> ceased operations over this section of the rapid transit system in 1955, but its concrete footings can still be seen opposite the current platform north of Foster Street.|$|R
50|$|The station, {{built in}} 1929 by Leo W. Post, {{was one of}} two South Shore {{stations}} of similar design. It replaced an earlier structure serving the developing resort community of Beverly Shores on Lake Michigan. This is the last unaltered Insull Spanish style structure of the nine built on Samuel Insull's South and North <b>Shore</b> <b>Lines.</b> It still serves the 88-mile long South <b>Shore</b> <b>Line,</b> the last of the electric interurban railway systems. This station typifies Insull's interurban routes; it is the best representative of the South <b>Shore</b> <b>Line's</b> history.|$|R
50|$|Then, in 1902, the Chicago & Milwaukee Electric Railway's {{branch to}} Mundelein was built, {{parallel}} to Rockland Road and passing over the EJ&E and Milwaukee Road above grade, almost directly above the existing Rondout junction. In 1916, Samuel Insull purchased and reorganized the Chicago & Milwaukee as the Chicago, North Shore and Milwaukee, {{often called the}} North <b>Shore</b> <b>Line.</b> The North <b>Shore</b> <b>Line's</b> freight interchange with the Milwaukee Road, and its above-grade Rondout Station passenger platforms and shelters, survived until the entire North <b>Shore</b> <b>Line</b> {{went out of business}} in January, 1963.|$|R
50|$|Central {{was served}} by trains of the Chicago North Shore and Milwaukee Railroad on the <b>Shore</b> <b>Line</b> Route. Like Foster and Noyes, Central had an {{additional}} side platform {{to the west}} of the southbound track for exclusive use of the North <b>Shore</b> <b>Line,</b> to prevent disembarking customers from transferring to 'L' trains for free. The platform was removed sometime after the North <b>Shore</b> <b>Line</b> ceased operations over this section of the rapid transit system in 1955, but its concrete footings can still be seen opposite the current platform south of Central Street.|$|R
