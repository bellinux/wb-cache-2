25|$|Thomas Forsaith {{became an}} {{apprentice}} as a silk merchant in Croydon, but he rather {{wanted to go}} to sea. As a cabin boy, he travelled on a collier to the River Tyne. He then made three journeys to the West Indies as a cadet officer for Charles Horsfall and Co. on the Huddersfield (named after Horsfall's birthplace). He returned home with a <b>good</b> <b>reference,</b> but found that his father had died in the meantime. As a fourth officer, he sailed on the convict ship Hoogley to Botany Bay in 1834. Two years later, he again sailed to Australia, this time on the Lord Goderich. He first came to New Zealand on the return journey, when Kauri spars were loaded in Hokianga.|$|E
25|$|The {{calculation}} of prior probabilities depends on available {{data from the}} genome being studied, {{and the type of}} analysis being performed. For studies where <b>good</b> <b>reference</b> data containing frequencies of known mutations is available (for example, in studying human genome data), these known frequencies of genotypes in the population can be used to estimate priors. Given population wide allele frequencies, prior genotype probabilities can be calculated at each locus according to the Hardy Weinberg Equilibrium. In the absence of such data, constant priors can be used, independent of the locus. These can be set using heuristically chosen values, possibly informed by the kind of variations being sought by the study. Alternatively, supervised machine-learning procedures have been investigated that seek to learn optimal prior values for individuals in a sample, using supplied NGS data from these individuals.|$|E
25|$|The {{so-called}} 'Subrahmanyam Formula' {{was widely}} used, {{especially in the}} mid-60's and throughout the 70's, to support India's entry into the nuclear club, despite the country's non-violent Gandhian origins and foreign policy roots in Nehruvian pacifism. The formula did not see any contradiction between striving for socio-economic progress and considering large-scale military development for a developing nation like India. Indeed, strategic deterrence, in which a small but effective indigenous nuclear arsenal would play a key part, was seen as vital to balancing things out in an unequal world carved up by Cold War geopolitics. This ingenious and apparently paradoxical stand has been adversely commented upon, being dubbed 'moral exceptionalism' on non-proliferation by several commentators. Significantly, Subrahmanyam also argued that Pakistan too should look to develop a limited nuclear programme of its own – to establish its own deterrent against conflict. This was met with great suspicion in Pakistani circles, and seen variously as an insult or a challenge. He also concluded in the 90's that India needed only 150-odd warheads to achieve minimum deterrence. And that this had been achieved by 1990, a point noted by many as a <b>good</b> <b>reference</b> to India's nuclear stockpile.|$|E
40|$|A {{challenge}} {{to the value of}} referencing and citations is sometimes heard in design research circles. This challenge questions the value of <b>good</b> <b>referencing</b> and citations to research and practice in design. This article will address the misunderstandings that give rise to these challenges. This article outlines the foundations of referencing and citation. It clarifies central issues in referencing and citation. It discusses literature review as an exercise linked to <b>good</b> <b>referencing</b> and it offers resources and tools for design research. Most important, it discusses the role of evidence in analyzing and solving problems in design research. While some design problems involve taste and interpretation, most design arguments rest on statements of fact. Statements of fact have truth-value established by evidence. References make evidence accessible distinct from the person and claims of the writer. By providing evidence for reasoned argument, <b>good</b> <b>referencing</b> and citation serves both the field of design practice and the discipline of design research. <b>Good</b> <b>referencing</b> is central to the growing literature of design research for four main reasons: reasoned argument, access to common evidence, building the field, and improving the intellectual and practical quality of the discipline...|$|R

2500|$|The {{appropriate}} [...] "reference" [...] {{depends on}} the measurement and its goal. The simplest reference measurement is to simply remove the sample (replacing it by air). However, sometimes a different reference is more useful. For example, if the sample is a dilute solute dissolved in water in a beaker, then a <b>good</b> <b>reference</b> measurement might be to measure pure water in the same beaker. Then the reference measurement would cancel out not only all the instrumental properties (like what light source is used), but also the light-absorbing and light-reflecting properties {{of the water and}} beaker, and the final result would just show the properties of the solute (at least approximately).|$|E

Adler (member of the Board of Editors of Encyclopædia Britannica {{since its inception}} in 1949, and its chair from 1974; director of editorial planning for the 15th edition of Britannica from 1965), the Britannica sought not only to be a <b>good</b> <b>reference</b> work and educational tool, but to systematise all human knowledge.

My main object is to get the gold separated as many miles as possible from the guano, for if the two should be connected in the mind of any one who knew where the guano was last shipped from, I might have cause for anxiety. But as the bars bear no sort of mark to indicate that they were cast by ancient Peruvians, and, so far as I can remember,--and I have visited several museums in South America,--these castings are not like any others that have come down to us from the times of the Incas, the gold must have been cast in this simple form merely for convenience in transportation and packing. Some people may think it is California gold, some may think it comes from South America, but, whatever they think, they know it is pure gold, and they have no right to doubt that it belongs to me. Of course, if I were a stranger it might be different, but wherever I have dealt I am known, or I send a <b>good</b> <b>reference.</b> And now I will come to the point of this letter.|$|E
