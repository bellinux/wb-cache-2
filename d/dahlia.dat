5|$|In {{the fifth}} and final case, Phoenix is visiting a {{mountain}} retreat with Maya and Pearl when a fellow guest, Elise Deauxnim, is murdered. While looking for Maya, he falls into a river and becomes ill, forcing Edgeworth and Franziska to temporarily fill in as attorney and prosecutor to keep his client, a nun named Iris, from being found guilty. When Phoenix returns, he explains that Elise is really Maya's long-lost mother, Misty Fey, and that her death {{was the result of}} a plan engineered by her sister Morgan to kill Maya with the help of the now deceased <b>Dahlia,</b> who turns out to be Iris's twin. Through cross-examination, Phoenix reveals that not only is <b>Dahlia</b> impersonating Iris, she is using Maya's body to do so. With Mia's help, <b>Dahlia</b> is exorcised from Maya and Iris is declared innocent. Godot is revealed as the one responsible for killing Misty to protect Maya, leading to the discovery of his true identity: Diego Armando. Having spent many years blaming Phoenix for Mia's death, he sought revenge, but concedes that Phoenix has done more to continue her legacy than him. Iris also reveals that she posed as <b>Dahlia</b> while Phoenix was attending college to protect him, ended up falling in love with him, and that she regrets her failure to stop her sister from becoming a criminal. Reuniting with his friends, Phoenix celebrates finally being free of his past.|$|E

40|$|The seed {{transmission}} of Verticillium <b>dahliae</b> was evaluated in lettuce (Lactuca sativa). Seed collected from lettuce plants infected with V. <b>dahliae</b> were plated {{with or without}} surface sterilization on Sorenson's modified NP 10 medium. Of the seed plated with or without surface sterilization, 90 and 66 %, respectively, yielded colonies of V. <b>dahliae.</b> The incidence of Verticillium wilt ranged from 55 to 80 % among lettuce plants grown from seed harvested from infected plants. All evaluated isolates of V. <b>dahliae</b> were capable of seed transmission in lettuce. A V. tricorpus isolate failed to cause significant disease in lettuce or to become seedborne. Storage of contaminated seed at seven temperatures ranging from - 20 to 15 degreesC for up to 72 weeks did not {{reduce the incidence of}} V. <b>dahliae</b> in seed, whereas storage at room temperature (23 +/- 2 degreesC) for 20 to 52 weeks reduced the incidence of V. <b>dahliae</b> without affecting seed viability. Of the 11 weed species collected from fields with a known history of Verticillium wilt of lettuce, four yielded V. <b>dahliae.</b> Pathogenicity tests demonstrated that isolates of V. <b>dahliae</b> from Sonchus oleraceus, Capsella bursa-pastoris, and Solanum sarrachoides were as virulent as or more virulent than an isolate of V. <b>dahliae</b> from lettuce.

40|$|Graduation date: 1983 The {{primary cause}} of "early dying" disease of {{potatoes}} in Oregon is Verticillium dahliae; however, Colletotrichum atramentarium, Erwinia carotovora subsp. carotovora (Ecc) and E. carotovora subsp. atroseptica (Eca) are also commonly isolated from diseased plants. Therefore, field and greenhouse studies were initiated to determine the relative involvement of each pathogen, directly and/or interactively with V. <b>dahliae</b> in the disease. Pathogenicity studies with 'Russet Burbank' potatoes were carried out in greenhouse pot culture to determine if C. atramentarium, Ecc and Eca can cause "early dying" disease similar to that caused by V. <b>dahliae.</b> Fifty-three days after root-dip inoculation, plants inoculated with Ecc, Eca or V. <b>dahliae</b> exhibited typical "early dying"disease symptoms, whereas those inoculated with C. atramentarium did not. Symptoms caused by V. <b>dahliae</b> were more severe than those caused by Ecc or Eca. In field studies with 'Norgold Russet' potatoes in 1980 (Columbia Basin and Klamath Basin) and in 1981 (Columbia Basin and Wallowa Valley), plant infection by V. <b>dahliae</b> was most strongly associated with symptom expression in plots previously cropped several times to potatoes; whereas plant infection by Ecc or Eca was most strongly associated with symptom expression in plots previously cropped one year or less to potatoes. In basal stem isolations made late in "early dying" disease epidemics, reductions were observed in the recovery of Eca and of V. <b>dahliae.</b> Decreases in Eca recovery were linked to plant infection by V. <b>dahliae,</b> whereas decreases in V. <b>dahliae</b> recovery were caused by basal plant infection by C. atramentarium. In co-inoculation studies the severity of symptom expression in V. <b>dahliae</b> inoculated 'Russet Burbank' was increased by Eca or Ecc, but was not influenced by C. atramentarium. The effect of V. <b>dahliae</b> and Eca, or V. <b>dahliae</b> and Ecc, on symptom expression was additive, rather than synergistic, and was due to an enhancement of stem colonization by V. <b>dahliae...</b>|$|R

This study identified a subtilase gene GbSBT 1 from Gossypium babardense and investigated the roles against V. <b>dahliae</b> infection. GbSBT 1 gene expression {{is responsive to}} V. <b>dahliae</b> defense signals, jasmonic acid, and ethylene treatments. Moreover, the GbSBT 1 protein is mainly localized in the cell membrane and moves into the cytoplasm following jasmonic acid and ethylene treatments. Silencing GbSBT 1 gene expression through virus-induced GbSBT 1 gene silencing reduced the tolerance of Pima- 90 (resistant genotype), but not facilitated the infection process of V. <b>dahliae</b> in Coker- 312 (sensitive genotype). Moreover, the ectopically expressed GbSBT 1 gene enhanced the resistance of Arabidopsis to Fusarium oxysporum and V. <b>dahliae</b> infection and activated the expression levels of defense-related genes. Furthermore, pull-down, yeast two-hybrid assay, and BiFC analysis revealed that GbSBT 1 interacts with a prohibitin (PHB) -like protein expressed in V. <b>dahliae</b> pathogens during infection.

40|$|There {{are major}} {{gaps in the}} {{understanding}} of how genetic variation is generated in the asexual pathogen Verticillium <b>dahliae.</b> On the one hand, V. <b>dahliae</b> is a haploid organism that reproduces clonally. On the other hand, single-nucleotide polymorphisms and chromosomal rearrangements were found between V. <b>dahliae</b> strains. Lineage-specific (LS) regions comprising about 5 % of the genome are highly variable between V. <b>dahliae</b> strains. Nonetheless, it is unknown whether horizontal gene transfer {{plays a major role in}} generating genetic variation in V. <b>dahliae.</b> Here, we analyzed a previously sequenced V. <b>dahliae</b> population of nine strains from various geographical locations and hosts. We found highly homologous elements in LS regions of each strain; LS regions of V. <b>dahliae</b> strain JR 2 are much richer in highly homologous elements than the core genome. In addition, we discovered, in LS regions of JR 2, several structural forms of nonhomologous recombination, and two or three homologous sequence types of each form, with almost each sequence type present in an LS region of another strain. A large section of one of the forms is known to be horizontally transferred between V. <b>dahliae</b> strains. We unexpectedly found that 350 kilobases of dynamic LS regions were much more conserved than the core genome between V. <b>dahliae</b> and a closely related species (V. albo-atrum), suggesting that these LS regions were horizontally transferred recently. Our results support the view that genetic variation in LS regions is generated by horizontal transfer between strains, and by chromosomal reshuffling reported previously...|$|R
40|$|Verticillium <b>dahliae</b> colonizes the xylem {{vessels of}} {{susceptible}} host plants. Hence {{it can be}} expected that {{the distribution of the}} fungus as well as disease progress will be influenced by the anatomy of the xylem of that host. Here, we studied the spatial and temporal distribution of V. <b>dahliae</b> in relation to recovery from disease symptoms in young European ash (Fraxinus excelsior) and Norway maple (Acer platanoides) trees that differ in vascular anatomy. Quantifying the amount of V. <b>dahliae</b> DNA at different heights in the stem of inoculated trees at different time points after inoculation showed that, in the year of inoculation, the speed of colonization of these two species by V. <b>dahliae</b> was similar. Nevertheless, in the year after inoculation disease incidence and also quantities of V. <b>dahliae</b> detected in maple trees were significantly higher than in ash trees, suggesting that the xylem of ash trees is much less supportive for growth and survival of V. <b>dahliae</b> than that of maple trees. Moreover, in this second year V. <b>dahliae</b> could not be re-isolated from the wood of ash trees that had recovered from disease and was only rarely detected by PCR, only in xylem of the previous year and never in the current xylem. In contrast, V. <b>dahliae</b> easily was detected in the wood of diseased ash and maple trees. Furthermore, despite the presence of a layer of parenchyma cells between growth rings in ash trees, in symptomatic ash trees V. <b>dahliae</b> was present in the xylem of the new growth ring. We also observed that V. <b>dahliae</b> can move downward from the point of inoculation into the root collar, which possibly provides a way for infection of new growth rings by circumventing the physical barriers within the stem xylem...|$|R
40|$|Verticillium leaf mottle and wilt {{caused by}} the fungus Verticillium <b>dahliae</b> is a major disease of {{sunflower}} in Argentina and the USA. In the summer of 2013, an important outbreak of the disease occurred in one field in the Southwest of Spain. The determination of vegetative compatibility groups (VCGs) of V. <b>dahliae</b> {{is used in the}} genetic characterization of the fungus. Molecular markers have also been developed and applied for the analysis of V. <b>dahliae,</b> particularly for those isolates infecting artichoke, cotton and olive tree. The objective of this work was to determine the genetic and molecular features of V. <b>dahliae</b> of sunflower. Three V. <b>dahliae</b> isolates, one from Argentina collected in 2012 and two collected in Spain in 2013, were analysed. The VCGs were determined by complementation between nit mutants of the isolates from sunflower and the VCGs reference strains. Molecular characterization was conducted by polymerase chain reaction using primer pairs that are diagnostic of either V. <b>dahliae</b> species, defoliating or non-defoliating pathotypes, or VCGs. Complementation tests between nit mutants and reference strains clearly showed that the three isolates from sunflower belong to the VCG 2 B. The VCG 2 B has been identified in V. <b>dahliae</b> from crops as cotton, artichoke, eggplant, pepper and tomato among others. When molecularly analysed, the three V. <b>dahliae</b> isolates infecting sunflower had the same molecular pattern than the one found for non-defoliating isolates of V. <b>dahliae</b> pathogenic to artichoke or cotton. The results of this work show the closeness between non-defoliating isolates of V. <b>dahliae</b> infecting artichoke, cotton and sunflower and suggest that any of these three species can serve as carrier and source of inoculum for Verticillium outbreaks in them.

40|$|Early, specific, and {{accurate}} in planta detection and quantification of Verticillium <b>dahliae</b> {{are essential to}} prevent the spread of Verticillium wilt in olive using certified pathogen-free planting material and development of resistance. We comparatively assessed the accuracy, specificity, and efficiency of eight real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction protocols published since 2002 for the specific detection and quantification of V. <b>dahliae</b> in various host plant species and in soil, using a background of DNAs extracted from olive roots, stems, and leaves. Results showed that some of those protocols were not specific for V. <b>dahliae</b> or were inhibited when using backgrounds other than water. Ranking of protocols according to a weighted score system placed protocols TAQ (based on intergenic spacer ribosomal DNA target gene) and SYBR- 4 (based on the β-tubulin 2 target gene) first in sensitivity and efficiency for the quantification of V. <b>dahliae</b> DNA in small amounts and different types of olive tissues (root and stem) tested. Use of TAQ and SYBR- 4 protocols allowed accurate quantification of V. <b>dahliae</b> DNA regardless of the background DNA, with a detection limit being fixed at a cycle threshold of 36 (≈ 18 fg for SYBR- 4 and 15 fg for TAQ) of V. <b>dahliae.</b> The amount of DNA from defoliating (D) and nondefoliating (ND) V. <b>dahliae</b> pathotypes was monitored in Verticillium wilt-resistant 'Frantoio' olive using the TAQ and SYBR- 4 protocols. In the infection bioassay, higher amounts of D V. <b>dahliae</b> DNA were measured in olive stems, whereas the average amount of fungal DNA in roots was higher for ND-infected plants than D-infected ones. Overall, V. <b>dahliae</b> DNA amounts in all olive tissues tested tended to slightly decrease or remain stable by the end of the experiment (35 days after inoculation). The SYBR- 4 and TAQ protocols further enabled detection of V. <b>dahliae</b> in tissues of symptomless plants, suggesting that both techniques can be useful for implementing certification schemes of pathogen-free planting material as well as helpful tools in breeding resistance to V. <b>dahliae</b> in olive. © 2013 The American Phytopathological Society.

Here, {{we report on}} LysM effectors of the soil-borne fungal vascular wilt pathogen Verticillium <b>dahliae.</b> Comparative genomics revealed three core LysM effectors that are conserved {{in a collection of}} V. <b>dahliae</b> strains. Remarkably, and in contrast to the previously studied LysM effectors of other plant pathogens, no expression of core LysM effectors was monitored in planta in a taxonomically diverse panel of host plants. Moreover, targeted deletion of the individual LysM effector genes in V. <b>dahliae</b> strain JR 2 did not compromise virulence in infections on Arabidopsis, tomato or Nicotiana benthamiana. Interestingly, an additional lineage-specific LysM effector is encoded in the genome of V. <b>dahliae</b> strain VdLs 17 but not in any other V. <b>dahliae</b> strain sequenced to date. Remarkably, this lineage-specific effector is expressed in planta and contributes to virulence of V. <b>dahliae</b> strain VdLs 17 on tomato, but not on Arabidopsis or on N. benthamiana.

40|$|Since {{the first}} report of Verticillium wilt of potato in 1950, the disease has been {{considered}} to be of minor importance in South Africa. Between 1995 and 2000, however, Verticillium spp. were isolated from 146 samples of symptomatic potato plant material received from 13 of the 14 potato production areas in the country. Of 93 Verticillium isolates that were obtained, 60 % were identified as V. <b>dahliae</b> and 8 % V. nigrescens. V. <b>dahliae</b> was present in nine of the regions and V. nigrescens in seven. Unidentified Verticillium species were isolated from six of the regions. Both V. <b>dahliae</b> and V. nigrescens were pathogenic to potato in vivo, with V. <b>dahliae</b> the more virulent of the two species. Ten South African potato cultivars, eight of which have recently been released, were evaluated over two seasons in a greenhouse for resistance to V. <b>dahliae.</b> The cultivars Aviva, BP 1, Bravo, Buffelspoort, Caren, Hoevelder and Ropedi were classified as susceptible to Verticillium wilt, whereas Calibra, Dawn and Devlin were rated as very susceptible.

40|$|Verticillium wilt {{of olive}} trees (Olea europaea L.), a wilt {{caused by the}} soil-borne fungus Verticillium <b>dahliae</b> (Kleb), {{is one of the}} most serious {{diseases}} in Algerian olive groves. To assess the pathogenic and genetic diversity of olive-infecting V. <b>dahliae</b> populations in Algeria, orchards from the two main olive-producing regions (north-western Algeria and Kabylia) were sampled and 27 V. <b>dahliae</b> isolates were recovered. For purposes of comparison, V. <b>dahliae</b> strains from France and Syria were added to the analysis. By means of PCR primers that specifically discriminate between defoliating (D) and non-defoliating (ND) V. <b>dahliae</b> pathotypes it was shown that all V. <b>dahliae</b> isolates belonged to the ND pathotype. The amount of genetic variation between the 43 isolates was assessed by random amplification of polymorphic DNA (RAPD). A total of 16 RAPD haplotypes were found on the basis of the presence or absence of 25 polymorphic DNA fragments. Genotypic diversity between the 27 Algerian isolates was low, with two RAPD haplotypes accounting for 70 % of all isolates. Genotypic diversity was however greater between isolates from Kabylia than between isolates from north-western Algeria. Cluster analysis showed that most of the Algerian V. <b>dahliae</b> isolates grouped together with the French and Syrian isolates. On the basis of their ability to form heterokaryons with each other, a subset of 25 olive-pathogenic isolates was grouped into a single vegetative compatibility group (VCG). These results suggest that the olive-infecting V. <b>dahliae</b> populations in Algeria show limited diversity and that caution should be taken to prevent introduction of the D pathotype...|$|R
