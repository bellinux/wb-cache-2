This 15-percent staff cut would make overall staff count come down from 63,745 to 54,000. (For comparison, the peak employment level in 2007 before the 2008 financial crisis was 83,500.)

During the period between 2008 and 2012, Germany, Brazil, and the United States began a series of investigations into the use of Credit Suisse accounts for tax evasion. In May 2014, the company pleaded guilty to decades of conspiring to help US citizens avoid taxes, and agreed to pay $2.6 billion in fines.|$|E
5|$|Air Liberté {{ceased to}} be an {{affiliate}} member of Oneworld when the French airline was sold by British Airways to French investment group Taitbout with the UK carrier explaining {{that it had been}} unable to receive adequate returns on <b>its</b> <b>investment</b> in the business. Kenya-based Regional Air joined the alliance on 1 July 2001, following its franchising agreement with British Airways. British Airways terminated its franchise agreement with Regional Air when the African carrier suspended flights in mid April 2005, ending its affiliate membership of Oneworld. TWA's regional carriers, which operated under the Trans World Express brand, became Oneworld affiliate members, as their name changed to AmericanConnection on 2 December 2001, following TWA's acquisition by American Airlines. Three airlines operated under the AmericanConnection brand at that time: Chautauqua Airlines, Corporate Airlines, and Trans States Airlines.|$|E
5|$|At {{the same}} time, UBS {{announced}} the planned cut of 8,700 jobs and had implemented a new compensation plan. Under the plan, {{no more than}} one-third of any cash bonus would be paid out in the year it is earned with the rest to be held in reserve and stock-based incentives that would vest after three years; top executives would have to hold 75% of any vested shares. Additionally, the bank's chairman, Peter Kurer, would no longer receive any extra variable compensation, only a cash salary and a fixed allotment of shares that could not be sold for four years. In April 2009, UBS announced that it agreed to sell its Brazilian financial services business, UBS Pactual, for approximately US$2.5billion to BTG Investments.

5|$|Burger King markets the Original Chicken Sandwich under several {{different}} names globally, including the Long Chicken, BK Chicken and Chicken Royal {{in the international}} markets it does business. The company also produces other variants that are specifically tailored to meet local taste preferences or customs of the various regions and countries in which it does business. To promote continuing interest in the product, Burger King occasionally releases limited-time (LTO) variants in the line that have different toppings or ingredients such as ham, Italian sausage or pulled pork. Being one of the company's major offerings, the Specialty Sandwiches are sometimes the center of product advertising for the company. Despite being a major product line in the company's portfolio, Burger King has registered very few global trademarks to protect <b>its</b> <b>investment</b> in the products.|$|E
5|$|Data-driven, Romney often {{played the}} role of a devil's {{advocate}} during exhaustive analysis of whether to go forward with a deal. He wanted to drop a Bain Capital hedge fund that initially lost money, but other partners disagreed with him and it eventually made billions. He opted out of the Artisan Entertainment deal, not wanting to profit from a studio that produced R-rated films. Romney served {{on the board of directors}} of Damon Corporation, a medical testing company later found guilty of defrauding the government; Bain Capital tripled <b>its</b> <b>investment</b> before selling off the company, and the fraud was discovered by the new owners (Romney was never implicated). In some cases, Romney had little involvement with a company once Bain Capital acquired it.|$|E

5|$|Initially, Bain Capital {{focused on}} venture capital investments. Romney {{set up a}} system in which any partner could veto one of these {{potential}} opportunities, and he personally saw so many weaknesses that few venture capital investments were approved in the initial two years. The firm's first significant success was a 1986 investment to help start Staples Inc., after founder Thomas G.

5|$|As {{one of the}} company's major offerings, {{the chicken}} fries are {{sometimes}} the center of product advertising for the company. The original advertisements were created by the firm of Crispin, Porter + Bogusky and were the subject of both criticism and legal action by the nu metal band Slipknot over claims of intellectual property rights, while later advertising programs started the company on a new direction of digital-based, multi-media advertising. With the product's North American reintroduction in 2014 and 2015, Burger King utilized a heavy social media campaign to help entice fans of the product back into restaurants. The company has also relied heavily on product tie-ins with the NFL, NCAA and NASCAR to promote the product across different demographic groups. Even though the product has been a prominent part of the menu {{for the better part}} of a decade, Burger King has released very few limited-time (LTO) variants of the product – its first one being released in the summer of 2015. Despite being a major product line in the company's portfolio, Burger King has registered very few, if any, global trademarks to protect <b>its</b> <b>investment</b> in the product.|$|E
5|$|When Philadelphia Media Holdings L.L.C. (PMH) {{bought the}} paper in 2006, Brian P. Tierney and the {{business}} people behind PMH signed a pledge promising {{that they would not}} influence the content of the paper. Tierney, a Republican activist who had represented many local groups in the Philadelphia area, had criticized The Inquirer in the past on behalf of his clients. One of Tierney's clients had been the Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Philadelphia, which he had represented during the Cipriano affair. PMH membership also included Bruce E. Toll, vice chairman of Toll Brothers Inc. Tierney said that the group was aware that the fastest way to ruin <b>its</b> <b>investment</b> in The Inquirer was to threaten the paper's editorial independence. The 2012 sale of Philadelphia Media Network to six local business leaders also led to concern of conflict of interest. The new owners, which included New Jersey Democratic fundraiser George Norcross III, media entrepreneur H. F. Lenfest, former New Jersey Nets owner Lewis Katz, and CEO of Liberty Property Trust and chairman of the Greater Philadelphia Chamber of Commerce William Hankowsky, pledged not to influence the content of the paper.|$|E
