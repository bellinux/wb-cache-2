5|$|Their daughter, Scottie, wrote {{after their}} deaths: I think (short of {{documentary}} {{evidence to the}} contrary) that if people are not crazy, they get themselves out of crazy situations, so I {{have never been able}} to buy the notion that it was my father's drinking which led her to the sanitarium. Nor do <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>she</b> led him to the drinking.|$|E
500|$|She is also {{credited}} {{with having a}} stabilizing effect on his private life. According to People magazine reporter Jane Simms Podesta, [...] "She is the steel in his back. She is a civilizing influence on him. <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>she</b> built him, in many ways, into the person he is today." ...|$|E
500|$|Prior to the episode's broadcast, Rashida Jones {{said she}} liked the new storylines that had {{developed}} for Ann Perkins' character, preferring that she remain single than simply get back together with Chris: [...] "It was pretty embarrassing what Ann went through, so <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>she</b> kind of has to recover from that before anything else. And {{this is a good}} time for Ann to be single too, because she hasn't been single ever on the show. <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>she</b> needs to do that a little bit." [...] Shortly after [...] "Camping" [...] first aired, a fake website for the bed and breakfast business The Quiet Corn was put up on the official NBC website, advertising the fictional establishment's features, room amenities and meal services. During one scene in [...] "Camping", Tom refers to one of the gadgets in his tent as DJ Roomba, an iPod music player attached to an autonomous robotic vacuum cleaner. The gadget, built by Tom, was previously featured in the second season episode [...] "Sweetums".|$|E
30|$|Connie: <b>I</b> {{definitely}} <b>think</b> <b>she</b> is down-to-earth. A {{couple of}} years ago she talked about how she likes to shop at Target… <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>she’s</b> worn like Target outfits and things like that. So, <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>she’s</b> someone we can relate to more [than the other first ladies].|$|R
500|$|Torv later remarked in a DVD special {{featurette}} that [...] "this {{episode is}} actually a nice one because <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>she's</b> kind of starting {{to look at these}} people as more than just a project. <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>she’s</b> starting to <b>think</b> about who they are" ...|$|R

500|$|The {{photographer}} Charles Brittin, {{who knew}} Cameron on Los Angeles' artistic circuit, called her [...] "a sweet {{person with a}} great personality, not the way some of her friends wanted to picture her to be". Her friend Shirley Berman described her as having [...] "many different crowds of friends, and <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>she</b> was a different personality with each crowd... She wasn't an even personality at all, but she was always a very gracious person." ...|$|E
500|$|When Missy and I do a record, {{the energy}} is {{on a whole}} other level. I can't explain exactly what it is. It's just the energy, <b>I</b> <b>think.</b> <b>She</b> knows how to really make a party a party. That's what I want – to make this record to be the {{ultimate}} party record. That's pretty much how that all came about. ... I guess each time we work together, we give 100% of our energy to each other. It's crazy. Sometimes you can't explain what the chemistry is. It's just how you feel.|$|E
500|$|Wit & Fancy {{praised the}} {{transformation}} of the character and stated, [...] "Of course Meredith will still make rash decisions like when she took off with Zola, or tampered with the trial but she does things out of love and the kindness of her heart now and not because she is dark and twisty. Considering where Meredith was at the beginning and where she is now, <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>she</b> went through a remarkable journey and did more than just growing up, she finally became “all whole and healed“." ...|$|E
60|$|Isa. Nay, I know not; {{she has not}} worn her busk this fortnight. <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>she's</b> grown fat o'the sudden.|$|R
60|$|GEORGE. <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>she's</b> well rid of Reggie Stopfort at any price, but I'm sorry {{the other}} party is André Leroux.|$|R
60|$|LADY CHESHIRE. The {{girls like}} her, so does your father; {{personally}} I must say <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>she's</b> rather nice and Irish.|$|R
500|$|Initial {{publicity}} {{for the character}} billed her as [...] "a nurse who {{has more than a}} few secrets to hide and an attitude that cannot fail to ruffle the feathers of her colleagues." [...] The Daily Express have described her as [...] "Gregarious...likes a gossip, but she's emotionally vulnerable", while Holby City actress Tina Hobley has compared Faye to her own character, Chrissie Williams, explaining that [...] "Faye is a quieter character all round who will do anything for an easy life, whereas Chrissie likes to stir up a bit of drama. <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>she</b> sees Faye as a goody two shoes." ...|$|E
500|$|Jovovich {{established}} a charitable foundation in 2005 to help Ukrainian children. At {{the time she}} referred to herself: [...] "I am a strong Ukrainian girl, that is why I work a lot". However, later, in an interview for the Ukrainian version of the Vogue magazine, Milla stated she doesn't actually consider herself Ukrainian. Expressing her disagreement with several newspapers that presented Jovovich as a [...] "Ukrainian actress", her mother Galina said, [...] "They may say whatever they want. My parents are Russian, from Tula. Milla is half Russian, half Montenegrin. But, <b>I</b> <b>think,</b> <b>she</b> considers herself of Russian descent".|$|E
500|$|Early storylines between Pauline and her {{two teenage}} children, Mark and Michelle, show {{her to be a}} doting mother, {{forgiving}} of Mark's wayward behaviour, and supportive when Michelle decides to become a teenage mum. Pauline is devoted to her twin brother Pete, dutiful to her mother Lou, allegiant to her husband Arthur, and a shoulder for her nephew, Ian, to cry on. Wendy Richard commented in 1990, [...] "It's important for her to keep the family together. That's why when her problem son Mark suddenly came home , it was like her winning the pools ... She had {{to take a lot of}} shocks from Michelle and <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>she</b> coped remarkably well." ...|$|E

500|$|Asked whether Robbins and Torres might marry in the future, Capshaw replied: [...] "There's {{probably}} a lot more stuff that has to happen before that happens. [...] I don't think they're {{going to get married}} just to get married. As Arizona goes, <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>she</b> has incredible discipline and she does, as you said, have a very strict moral compass and marriage would not be something she would jump into without giving it a great amount of thought." [...] Discussing Robbins' relationship with Torres' former lover Sloan, Capshaw divulged: [...] "Whenever there's been a chance to play that I am intimidated by him or being standoffish, I've always chosen to make it very playful. It's much more Arizona's style to find it very amusing." ...|$|E
500|$|The episode {{introduced}} two new {{characters in}} Gibson Praise, played by Jeff Gulka, and Diana Fowley, portrayed by Mimi Rogers. Kim Manners later said of Gulka, [...] "There {{was something about}} that kid's personality that really came off on screen. He really exuded an intelligence that was pretty special. Chris saw what Bob Goodwin did {{with him and he}} knew that this kid was a special storytelling tool for the chronicle of the X-Files". Chris Carter said that Fowley [...] "was a character you were destined to hate because she was a competitor for Mulder's affection with Scully. Gillian Anderson said, [...] "She didn't make it easy on Scully. <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>she</b> was aware of her effect on Mulder and on the situation." ...|$|E
500|$|Coulter {{has said}} that she grew up {{listening}} to artists such as Mariah Carey and Whitney Houston, citing the latter as an influence. She has also named Michael Jackson and Beyoncé as influences, she told Cosmopolitan magazine, [...] " [...] so driven, she pushes herself to the limits and she's achieved so much but she's always looking for what that next thing is and how she can improve from what she's done in the past. She's really setting the benchmark for female artists and <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>she</b> kind of is the Michael Jackson of this generation". Critics have compared Coulter's songs [...] "Do It Like That" [...] (2012) and its accompanying music video, as well as [...] "Giddyup" [...] (2014) to Beyoncé's work. Coulter has expressed admiration for other female artists such as Madonna, Pink, Lady Gaga and Katy Perry.|$|E

60|$|JILL. She's all right. Lots {{of women}} powder and touch up their lips nowadays. <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>she's</b> rather a good sort; she was awfully upset.|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes, sir, <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>she's</b> a large brig, but {{she seems}} much chafed, and there's no name {{left on the}} stern, {{if ever there was}} one." ...|$|R
500|$|Amid {{preparations}} for the coronation, Princess Margaret informed her sister that she wished to marry Peter Townsend, a divorcé‚ 16 years Margaret's senior, with two sons from his previous marriage. The Queen asked them {{to wait for a}} year; in the words of Martin Charteris, [...] "the Queen was naturally sympathetic towards the Princess, but <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>she</b> thought – she hoped – given time, the affair would peter out." [...] Senior politicians were against the match and the Church of England did not permit remarriage after divorce. If Margaret had contracted a civil marriage, she would have been expected to renounce her right of succession. Eventually, she decided to abandon her plans with Townsend. In 1960, she married Antony Armstrong-Jones, who was created Earl of Snowdon the following year. They divorced in 1978; she did not remarry.|$|E
500|$|At {{comprehensive}} school, Turunen {{performed as}} a singer for several projects. Her first piano teacher Kirsti Nortia-Holopainen, [...] "Tarja was in a school that had some very musical people. Even then she got to perform a lot. <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>she</b> sang in every school function there was." [...] Her music teacher, Plamen Dimov, later explained that, [...] "If you gave Tarja just one note, she immediately got it. With the others, you'd have to practice three, four, five times". At school she had a tough time, since some girls bullied her because they envied her voice. To solve that problem, Dimov organized projects outside school. At fifteen, Turunen had her first major appearance as a soloist at a church concert {{in front of a}} thousand listeners. In 1993 she attended the Senior Secondary School of Art and Music in Savonlinna.|$|E
500|$|Faye and Joseph became {{engaged in}} series ten, much to Jac's displeasure. Roberts has relayed Marcel's insight that, [...] "Jac's left with very little. She hasn't got the {{consultancy}} post. Joseph's father {{is long gone}} and <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>she</b> may be nostalgic for all of that. She's hankering after Joseph again. She wants him for herself." [...] He added, on Joseph's reaction to Jac's meddling in his relationship with Faye; [...] "He's a good guy but Jac brings out the evil in him. He does have a darker side. He will fight injustice with injustice." [...] In the episode [...] "Locked Away", Joseph and Jac are locked in theatre together– after being affected by an unknown poison– where they both reveal their true feelings for each other. Joseph admits that he still loves Jac, but would not take her back as she has hurt him too many times.|$|E

500|$|In 2007, she {{appeared}} opposite Milla Jovovich in , portraying {{the character of}} Claire Redfield, who in the film, {{is the leader of}} a convoy of zombie apocalypse survivors who go to Alaska in search of a safe haven. Her role sent her to Mexicali, Mexico for filming from May to late July, and required her hair to be dyed a light red. Larter explained her character Claire: [...] "She became the leader of this convoy. She's incredibly strong, patient. <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>she</b> serves a role for everyone within this convoy, let it be a mother to someone, a buddy, a best friend." [...] Despite negative reviews, the film made a total of US$147 million worldwide. Also in the same year, {{she appeared}} with Hayes McArthur in the comedy Homo Erectus and appeared as Evelyn Garland in the biographical drama Crazy, based on guitarist Hank Garland.|$|E
500|$|Delany {{compared}} Katherine's new realizations {{to that of}} actress Meredith Baxter, who {{realized she}} was a lesbian late in her life after entering into {{a relationship with a}} woman. Delany said she believed her character would be taken by surprise by the new feelings she is experiencing: [...] "I think that she’s still so emotionally vulnerable from getting out of the loony bin, and <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>she</b> and Robin connect on a kind of wounded, emotional level. And I think if anything, she’s feeling this kind of emotional solace with her, and that draws her to Robin in a physical way, and that’s confusing to her." [...] Delany and Benz were both sick when they filmed their kiss scene. Benz said of the scene, [...] "Dana's a great kisser." [...] Delany said more male crew members were present for the filming of the lesbian kiss scene than usual due to the sensuality of the scene.|$|E
500|$|Actress Jasika Nicole {{was pleased}} that the writers decided to let her {{character}} discover Walter's secret, commenting [...] "Astrid finds out in a really emotional way because Walter lets it slip to her accidentally. I {{think that it was}} really nice for them to invite Astrid into the importance of that instead of keeping her in the dark. At least she knows that she's a part of this family and this affects her. <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>she</b> serves as a really important character in these later episodes because Astrid is kind of the only person that isn't directly involved with everything that is still on his side. She has {{to step up to the}} plate and be that comfort for him because if he doesn't have anyone there, he's basically going to regress and go back to the place, I think mentally, that he was in when he was in the mental institution. And of course we don't want that." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I <b>think</b> <b>she's</b> tired now. <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>she's</b> had {{too much}} to do. Perhaps in a little while she'll go to Skegness with me. Then she'll be able to rest. I s'll be glad if she can." ...|$|R
