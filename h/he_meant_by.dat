500|$|While writing East Coker Eliot {{thought of}} {{creating}} a [...] "quartet" [...] of poems that would reflect {{the idea of the}} four elements and, loosely, the four seasons. As the first four parts of The Waste Land has been associated with one of the four classical elements so has each of the constituent poems of Four Quartets: air (BN,) earth (EC,) water (DS,) and fire (LG.) However, there is little support for the poems matching with individual seasons.

500|$|He {{was very}} careful not to present his own views of the meaning of his films and leave them open to interpretation. He {{explained}} in a 1960 interview with Robert Emmett Ginna: [...] "One of the things I always find extremely difficult, when a picture's finished, is when a writer or a film reviewer asks, 'Now, {{what is it that you}} were trying to say in that picture?' And without being thought too presumptuous for using this analogy, I like to remember what T. S. Eliot said to someone who had asked him—I believe it was The Waste Land—what <b>he</b> <b>meant</b> <b>by</b> the poem. He replied, 'I meant what I said'. If I could have said it any differently, I would have". Kubrick likened the understanding of his films to popular music, in that whatever the background or intellect of the individual, a Beatles record, for instance, can both be appreciated by the Alabama truck driver and the young Cambridge intellectual in the way that his films can because their [...] "emotions and subconscious are far more similar than their intellects". He believed that the subconscious emotional reaction evoked by audiences was far more powerful in the film medium than in any other traditional verbal form, and was one of the reasons why he often relied on long periods in his films without dialogue, placing emphasis on images and sound. In a Time magazine interview in 1975, Kubrick further stated: [...] "The essence of a dramatic form is to let an idea come over people without it being plainly stated. When you say something directly, it is simply not as potent as it is when you allow people to discover it for themselves." [...] He also said [...] "Realism is probably the best way to dramatize argument and ideas. Fantasy may deal best with themes which lie primarily in the unconscious".|$|E

[...] The reader, understanding that Plato was not governed by the historical record, can read the Symposium, and ask why the author, Plato, arranged the story the way he did, and what <b>he</b> <b>meant</b> <b>by</b> including the various aspects of setting, composition, characters, and theme, etc.|$|E

2500|$|According to authors such as Ornea and Constantin Ciopraga, Henric Sanielevici {{was most}} {{productive}} and interesting {{as a literary}} theorist, and only so until ca. 1911. At the time, Sanielevici's study of and contribution to Romanian literature sought to uphold the Classical and Neoclassical models, reinterpreted by him through a socialist grid. He suggested that the dominating Neoclassical form promoted through Junimea was in actuality Neoromanticism, {{and that the only}} true Neoclassical Junimist was a minor author, Ioan Alexandru Brătescu-Voineşti—Maiorescu replied, [...] "both [...] assessments strike us as strange." [...] In defining what <b>he</b> <b>meant</b> <b>by</b> [...] "Classicism", Sanielevici continued to borrow from Maiorescu's ideal of [...] "formal purity", but expanded it to mean narratives so restrained and so immersing [...] "that we don't even pay attention to the words". In his memoirs, Sanielevici ventured to state that his own writing was generally [...] "more elegant" [...] than Maiorescu's, and [...] "precise" [...] in the manner of 18th-century literati.|$|E
2500|$|Lord Boyd of Duncansby's role as Lord Advocate {{featured}} {{leading the}} prosecution in the Pan Am Flight 103 bombing trial between May 2000 and January 2001.

Controversy continues to surround Megrahi's conviction despite the rejection of his appeal on 14 March 2002. Evidence presented at the trial has been called into question and doubts have been expressed about the reliability of several key prosecution witnesses. According to The Sunday Times of 23 October 2005 former Lord Advocate, Lord Fraser of Carmyllie, described one such witness as [...] "not quite the full shilling" [...] and [...] "an apple short of a picnic". Boyd has demanded that Lord Fraser should issue a public statement clarifying what he actually said about this witness, and what <b>he</b> <b>meant</b> <b>by</b> those remarks.|$|E

2500|$|English {{does not}} use either of those two words {{for the name of}} the ancient office, but prefers scholiarch, a word that is not {{generally}} listed in the dictionary, because it is considered an error. If it were a produced word; i.e., a meaning compounded from words of known meaning, then it ought to mean [...] "master of the scholia," [...] a specious etymology sometimes put forward. Scholiarch was not known in classical, vulgar, or mediaeval Latin. It does appear in the New Latin of Renaissance monastic schools in Europe with reference to the schoolmaster. The Thesaurus linguae Latinae of 1573 by Robertus Stephanus, a Parisian known to English authors as Robert Stephens, uses it to define scholasticus: vel Scholiarchus recte dicitur, qui in collegiis sacerdotum barbare vocatur, referring to the [...] "colleges of priests." [...] What <b>he</b> <b>meant</b> <b>by</b> barbare is not very clear, but if the reference is to the Jesuit schools (which educated priests) then he appears to have been under the impression that scholiarch was the original office. Stephens was a Protestant convert from Catholicism. As he was a printer, his use of scholiarch perpetuated the word in English scholarship. It is used almost exclusively in the 19th and 20th centuries CE.|$|E
2500|$|Hegel {{made the}} {{distinction}} between civil society and state in his Elements of the Philosophy of Right. In this work, civil society (Hegel used the term [...] "bürgerliche Gesellschaft" [...] though it is now referred to as Zivilgesellschaft in German to emphasize a more inclusive community) was a stage in the dialectical relationship that occurs between Hegel's perceived opposites, the macro-community {{of the state and}} the micro-community of the family. Broadly speaking, the term was split, like Hegel's followers, to the political left and right. On the left, it became the foundation for Karl Marx's civil society as an economic base; to the right, it became a description for all non-state (and the state is the peak of the objective spirit) aspects of society, including culture, society and politics. This liberal distinction between political society and civil society was followed by Alexis de Tocqueville. In fact, Hegel's distinctions as to what <b>he</b> <b>meant</b> <b>by</b> civil society are often unclear. For example, while it seems to be the case that he felt that a civil-society such as the German society in which he lived was an inevitable movement of the dialectic, he made way for the crushing of other types of [...] "lesser" [...] and not fully realized types of civil society, as these societies were not fully conscious or aware, as it were, as to the lack of progress in their societies. Thus, it was perfectly legitimate in the eyes of Hegel for a conqueror, such as Napoleon, to come along and destroy that which was not fully realized.|$|E
