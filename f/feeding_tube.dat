5|$|In April 2001, the Schindlers filed {{a motion}} for relief from {{judgment}} citing new evidence of Terri Schiavo's wishes. Judge Greer denied the motion as untimely under Rule 1.540(b)(5) of the Florida Rules of Civil Procedure. The Second District Court of Appeal upheld Greer's decision but remanded the issue {{in order to give}} the Schindlers an opportunity to file a new motion. On April 24, 2001 Terri's <b>feeding</b> <b>tube</b> was removed for the first time. The Schindlers filed a civil suit against Michael Schiavo alleging perjury, which was assigned to another court. The judge, Frank Quesada, issued an injunction against the removal of <b>feeding</b> <b>tube</b> until this was settled. The <b>feeding</b> <b>tube</b> was reinserted on April 26, 2001. On appeal by Michael Schiavo, the Second District Court of Appeal reversed Judge Quesada's order. In the same time frame, Michael Schiavo {{filed a motion}} to enforce the mandate of the guardianship court (that the <b>feeding</b> <b>tube</b> be removed). The Second District Court of Appeal denied the motion. These three decisions, all published in a single order by Florida's Second District Court of Appeal, came to be known by the court as Schiavo II in its later rulings.|$|E
5|$|Terri Schiavo died at a Pinellas Park hospice on March 31, 2005.

5|$|There {{have been}} several {{theories}} proposed for why the phylloxera was ignored as the possible cause of the disease {{that resulted in the}} failure of so many vineyards, most of which involve the feeding behaviour of the insect, and the way it attacks the roots. The proboscis of the grape phylloxera has both a venom canal from which it injects its deadly venom and a <b>feeding</b> <b>tube</b> through which it takes in vine sap and nutrients. As the toxin from the venom corrodes the root structure of a vine, the sap pressure falls and, as a result, the Phylloxera quickly withdraws its <b>feeding</b> <b>tube</b> and searches for another source of food. Thus, anyone digging up a diseased and dying vine will not find Phylloxera clinging to the roots of the plant.|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACT. A {{widely held}} {{assumption}} is that postpyloric intubations occur more often with weighted than with un-weighted nasally inserted <b>feeding</b> <b>tubes.</b> This randomized, pro-spective study compared the frequency of duodenal intubations using weighted and unweighted nasoenteric <b>feeding</b> <b>tubes.</b> One hundred sixteen patients had either weighted (61 patients) or unweighted (55 patients) 10 F silicone elastomer <b>feeding</b> <b>tubes</b> inserted nasally 85 cm. Tubes were placed with wire stylets. Tube positions were verified radiographically within 4 hr after insertions. Radiographs were repeated daily for 3 days or until duodenal intubation occurred. Successful duodenal intubations were achieved in 35 patients (57 %) with weighted <b>feeding</b> <b>tubes</b> and in 37 patients (67 %) with unweighted <b>feeding</b> <b>tubes.</b> This difference was not significant. Weighted nasoenteric <b>feeding</b> <b>tubes</b> offer no advantage over unweighted tubes in achievin...|$|R
40|$|OBJECTIVES: Accurate tube {{placement}} of orogastric and nasogastric <b>feeding</b> <b>tubes</b> in neonates {{is important to}} ensure safe and effective enteral feeding. Errors in placement and position of <b>feeding</b> <b>tubes</b> are described in literature, {{but there is little}} evidence of the exact prevalence of improperly placed tubes, especially in neonates. MATERIALS AND METHODS: To evaluate the prevalence of improperly placed <b>feeding</b> <b>tubes,</b> we reviewed 381 consecutive radiographs and defined the position of the <b>feeding</b> <b>tubes.</b> RESULTS: We found that in 41 % of the placements, the optimal position of the <b>feeding</b> <b>tubes</b> was achieved, whereas overall 59 % of the <b>feeding</b> <b>tubes</b> had been placed incorrectly. CONCLUSIONS: There is a need for both better rules to measure the distance between nose (lips) and the body of the stomach and improved methods to confirm correct tube position in neonates...|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT. The {{introduction}} of soft, small-bore nasoenteral <b>feeding</b> <b>tubes</b> has improved {{our ability to}} provide nutritional support to patients in a more comfortable, safe, and cost-effective manner. A retrospective study reveals, however, that 40 % of patients receiving nasoenteral <b>tube</b> <b>feeding</b> experienced inadvertent dislodgement of their <b>feeding</b> <b>tubes.</b> All of the patients with dislodged <b>feeding</b> <b>tubes</b> were confused, disorien-ted, or obtunded periodically. Various means for preventing this problem are discussed. In view of both the considerable time and effort required to place nasoenteral <b>feeding</b> <b>tubes</b> properly and the potential complications due to inadvertent tubes dislodgement, {{it is recommended that}} nasoenteral <b>feeding</b> <b>tubes</b> be secured more effectively, particularly in confused or obtunded patients.

5|$|During {{the years}} of legal proceedings, {{disability}} rights groups and activists closely monitored and involved themselves in the case. In March 2003, twelve disability rights groups, led by Not Dead Yet, along with four other amici, filed an amicus curiae brief in which they opposed the removal of Schiavo's <b>feeding</b> <b>tube.</b> They also used the Schiavo case to advocate for federal review in cases where third parties decide to withdraw life support from patients unable to give consent.|$|E
5|$|Two polls {{conducted}} {{shortly after}} Schiavo's <b>feeding</b> <b>tube</b> was removed {{for the final}} time in 2005 showed that {{a large majority of}} Americans believed that Michael Schiavo should have had the authority to make decisions on behalf of his wife, Terri, and that the United States Congress overstepped its bounds with its intervention in the case. However, other polls seemed to favor the Schindler family's position, and questions were raised about the wording of all the polls.|$|E
5|$|Along with {{offering}} {{emotional support}} {{to both the}} patient and family, palliative care serves {{an important role in}} addressing goals of care. People with Parkinson's may have many difficult decisions to make as the disease progresses such as wishes for <b>feeding</b> <b>tube,</b> non-invasive ventilator, and tracheostomy; wishes for or against cardiopulmonary resuscitation; and when to use hospice care. Palliative care team members can help answer questions and guide people with Parkinson's on these complex and emotional topics to help them make the best decision based on their own values.|$|E
40|$|Purpose of review: This article {{reviews the}} {{thoracic}} complications from malpositioned blindly inserted nasogastric <b>feeding</b> <b>tubes</b> in mechanically ventilated patients {{in intensive care}} and the methods to check the position and promote safe placement of the <b>feeding</b> <b>tubes.</b> Recent findings: Malpositioned <b>feeding</b> <b>tubes</b> {{are not included in}} risk management databases. The reported incidence is 1 - 3 % and more than half occur in mechanically ventilated patients. Eighty three mechanically ventilated patients were reported with malpositioned nasogastric tubes and 66 % of them developed serious thoracic complications. Pneumothoraces accounted for 80 % of thoracic complications that were evenly distributed between tubes with and without stylet. Repeated misplacements appear to increase the risk. Non-radiological confirmation of the position of the tube has suboptimal performance. Protocols to place <b>feeding</b> <b>tubes</b> and new technology are promising candidates. Summary: Malpositioned nasogastric <b>feeding</b> <b>tubes</b> are underreported and associated with serious thoracic complications in mechanically ventilated patients. We need more data to answer whether we can afford to prevent them...|$|R

5|$|In March 2000, the Schindlers filed {{a motion}} to permit {{assisted}} feeding of Terri, which is not considered a life-prolonging procedure under Florida law. Since clinical records indicated that Terri Schiavo was not responsive to swallowing tests and required a <b>feeding</b> <b>tube,</b> Judge Greer ruled {{that she was not}} capable of orally ingesting sufficient nutrition and hydration to sustain life, and denied the request. The Medical Examiner in his postmortem report was more definitive and reaffirmed that Schiavo could not have swallowed.|$|E

40|$|Introduction: The {{literature}} documents numerous inconveniences of {{drug administration}} through <b>feeding</b> <b>tubes.</b> Actions {{to improve the}} quality of this practice are of great importance. Objective: The objective of this study is to describe the implementation process and results of an Integrated Program to improve drug administration through <b>feeding</b> <b>tubes</b> in a Brazilian general hospital. Methods: This is a descriptive study of a clinic quality improvement program which proceeded in four steps: (1) design of a data base with technical characteristics of oral drugs; (2) application of an identification label on non-crushable tablets; (3) evaluation, through focal groups, of nursing technicians' knowledge of drug administration through <b>feeding</b> <b>tubes,</b> and formal training; (4) prescription review of patients prescribed enteral nutrition and subsequent pharmaceutical intervention. Results: A list with 131 oral drugs used within the hospital was compiled with recommendations for their administration through <b>feeding</b> <b>tubes.</b> Seven non-crushable drugs were identified with "do not crush" labels. Formal training regarding drug administration through <b>feeding</b> <b>tubes</b> was elaborated incorporating findings from the focal groups and applied to the nursing team. Over eight months, we analyzed 888 prescriptions written for 185 patients and addressed 263 pharmaceutical interventions to the medical team (which they accepted in 100 % of the cases), and 105 interventions to the nursing team. Conclusions: Qualification programs with multiple strategies, as the one described here, may directly improve drug administration through <b>feeding</b> <b>tubes</b> and help to solve and prevent problems related to this practic...|$|R

5|$|Weight {{loss and}} eating {{difficulties}} due to dysphagia and other muscle discoordination are common, making nutrition management increasingly {{important as the}} disease advances. Thickening agents {{can be added to}} liquids as thicker fluids are easier and safer to swallow. Reminding the affected person to eat slowly and to take smaller pieces of food into the mouth may also be of use to prevent choking. If eating becomes too hazardous or uncomfortable, the option of using a percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy is available. This is a <b>feeding</b> <b>tube,</b> permanently attached through the abdomen into the stomach, which reduces the risk of aspirating food and provides better nutritional management. Assessment and management by speech-language pathologists with experience in Huntington's disease is recommended.|$|E
5|$|While {{the bill}} had been {{proposed}} by Republican Senators Rick Santorum and Mel Martinez, {{it also had}} the support of Democratic Senator Tom Harkin due to disability rights concerns in the Schiavo case. Harkin had worked with disability rights groups for years and co-authored the 1990 Americans with Disabilities Act. American disability rights groups traditionally tend to ally themselves with Democrats and the political left; however, in the Schiavo case they joined pro-life organizations in opposing the removal of her <b>feeding</b> <b>tube</b> and supporting the Palm Sunday Compromise. According to Marilyn Golden, Harkin's support was necessary for passage of the bill, as any voice opposition by Democrats would have delayed it.|$|E
