5000|$|ITU H.264 Scalable Video Coding (SVC) is a {{compression}} {{standard that}} enables videoconferencing systems to achieve highly error resilient Internet Protocol (IP) video transmissions over the public Internet without quality-of-service enhanced lines. This standard has enabled wide scale deployment of high definition desktop videoconferencing and made possible new architectures, which reduces latency between the transmitting sources and receivers, resulting in more <b>fluid</b> <b>communication</b> without pauses. In addition, an attractive factor for IP videoconferencing {{is that it}} is easier to set up for use along with web conferencing and data collaboration. These combined technologies enable users to have a richer multimedia environment for live meetings, collaboration and presentations.|$|E

50|$|Pichi is {{a member}} of the African branch of the family of Atlantic English-lexicon Creoles. It descends {{directly}} from Krio, the English-lexicon Creole that rose to become the language of the Creole community of Freetown, Sierra Leone in the late 18th century (cf. Huber 1999). Throughout the better part of the 19th century, this community, which had emerged from the horrors of slavery and the slave trade, began to forge a vibrant African-European culture and economy along the West African seaboard (cf. e.g. Fyle 1962; Wyse 1989). Mutual intelligibility within the African branch is quite high. However, an impediment to <b>fluid</b> <b>communication</b> between speakers of Pichi and its sister languages is the divergent path of development of Pichi since 1857. In that year, Spain began to actively enforce colonial rule in Equatorial Guinea. From then onwards, Pichi was cut off from the direct influence of English, the language from which it inherited the largest part of its lexicon. Some of the present-day differences between Pichi and its sister languages can be attributed to internal developments in Pichi. But without doubt, an equally important reason for the separate development of Pichi is the extensive degree of language contact with Spanish, the colonial and present-day official language of Equatorial Guinea.|$|E

50|$|An {{alternative}} {{phenomenon is}} the creation of external social audits by groups or individuals independent of the accountable organisation and typically without its encouragement. External social audits thus also attempt to blur the boundaries between organisations and society and to establish social accounting as a <b>fluid</b> two-way <b>communication</b> process. Companies are sought to be held accountable regardless of their approval. It is in this sense that external audits part with attempts to establish social accounting as an intrinsic feature of organisational behaviour. The reports of Social Audit Ltd in the 1970s on e.g. Tube Investments, Avon Rubber and Coalite and Chemical, laid the foundations for much of the later work on social audits.|$|R

40|$|Congenital spinal {{extradural}} cysts {{are rare}} {{and may be}} the cause ofacute paraplegia. In their clinical features they closely resemble acute transverse myelitis. Immediate decompression of the spinal cord and removal of the cyst may lead to restoration of normal function.

Congenital spinal extradural cysts are herniations of the arachnoid mater through an aperture in the dura mater, producing a cyst containing cerebrospinal <b>fluid</b> in <b>communication</b> with the spinal canal.

40|$|Social media {{adoption}} within organisations enables wider {{employee participation}} in corporate communication and rhetoric. We study {{the impact of}} social media on rhetorical practices inside organisations, namely how social media reshapes senior management communication. We study the online communication environments of eight organisations and identify two contrasting approaches in dealing with social media adoption: the closed and open model. In the closed model, organisations maintain central control and their communication platforms remain mainly one-way. In the open model, organisations develop and foster two-way interaction. The study finds that in the "open model", governance {{and culture of the}} organisation changes in order to address the shift in control and tension between top-down and bottom-up communication. Our key contribution is in rethinking rhetorical practices in the context of modern open and <b>fluid</b> online <b>communication</b> environments in organisations - rhetorical diffusion - and characterising the changes in governance and culture that enable this transition - internal ambidexterity. 1 © 2012 IEEE...|$|R

40|$|Information {{does not}} {{generally}} {{behave like a}} conservative <b>fluid</b> flow in <b>communication</b> networks with multiple sources and sinks.
