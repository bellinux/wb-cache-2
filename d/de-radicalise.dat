He believes that Wahhabism is the ideology of Islamic militants, stating that madrassas teaching the Wahhabi ideology are engaging in hate preaching and are producing terrorists. He has urged world leaders to impose sanctions on Saudi Arabia for their role in promoting terrorism. Furthermore, he has called for Wahhabism to be banned in the United Kingdom, United States of America and India.

Adam’s stance against their pervasive competition for victimhood also leads to a divide with his Shiite Syrian friend, YAMEN. Growing up, he wasn’t absentminded of the roots of misogyny among his people. Adam loathes {{the kind of people}} his friends are. However, he hasn’t cut ties with them.

He transformed the MSI into the more moderate National Alliance (AN), going farther than Almirante's 1970s [...] "National Right" [...] strategy. Fini was soon viewed as a skilful political operator and he gained {{the support of the}} party majority.In the Tangentopoli scandals of the early 1990s, a pool of judges discovered a widespread system of corruption in all of the mainstream parties, and many key politicians were brought on trial. The scandals were devastating for the mainstream parties and resulted in their dissolutions. As the so-called [...] "First Republic" [...] collapsed, the MSI remained uninvolved in the scandals due to not having taken part in the Italian political life. Nevertheless, a radical transformation was required to break away from its fascist heritage. At the same time, the end of the Cold War helped to <b>de-radicalise</b> Italian politics. The corruption scandals also led the political competition in Italy to become very personalised, and in 1993, Fini and Alessandra Mussolini surprisingly won unprecedented large support when running for mayor in Rome and Naples, respectively. Although they lost their elections, they each won about 45% of the vote.|$|E

40|$|In {{this paper}} we map briefly {{some of the}} {{arguments}} around the meaning and significance of the introduction of Civil Partnership in England and Wales, {{and in this way}} show how contested these meanings are. We then turn to our empirical data to explore {{the extent to which these}} arguments and issues are part of the everyday decision making processes of same sex couples who have decided to register their partnerships or to undergo a commitment ceremony of some kind. In doing this, we were interested in how people make their own meanings (if they do) and whether they actually frame important decisions in their lives around the ideas that are part of the current political debates. We are interested in whether the public debates are featured in the accounts of our interviewees but our concern is also that these broader political debates appear to offer two alternatives to same sex couples. In one scenario same sex couples appear to be striking a blow for equality and are cultural heroes, in the other they appear as cultural dupes who are unintentionally falling into a government trap to <b>de-radicalise</b> their relationships and defuse the possibility of a queer alternative to heteronormativity. Our data give some insight into how same sex couples negotiate these alternatives and may, in fact, circumnavigate them...|$|E
40|$|This article investigates {{one aspect}} of what the Dutch {{government}} can do to reduce the risks posed by Dutch jihadists who are currently fighting in Syria. The Dutch government has developed a comprehensive action programme to combat jihadism which outlines measures designed to combat the jihadist movement in the Netherlands. The comprehensive action programme includes plans to develop an exit facility to help people leaving the jihadist movement. Furthermore, a support facility needs to be created, based on the German network model. Of this network the Hayat programme will be analysed in-depth together with the EXIT-Deutschland programme. Hayat is a civil society programme that includes working with relatives of radicalised individuals and tries to <b>de-radicalise</b> these individuals. Hayat’s programme is amongst others based on experiences gained from EXIT-Deutschland, a de-radicalisation programme focusing on de-radicalising individual members of the radical right movement. The exit-facility that the Dutch government wants to create and the support facility are only explained vaguely and {{have not yet been}} introduced. This research investigates how and to what extent Hayat’s and EXIT-Deutschland’s elements can successfully be transferred to the Netherlands. This research recommends focusing on disengaging instead of de-radicalisation. The programme should be executed by an NGO with expert witness status. Furthermore, an active approach to contacting returnees is considered best in line with the Dutch government’s objectives. Important elements of the German programme can be transferred to the Netherlands. These elements include using a personal approach, providing returnees with alternatives and family counselling, and generally - apart from the already existing repressive measures - focusing on positive measures. This article also outlines the ways in which such a transfer of best practises can be best achieved...|$|E
40|$|Background: Health service reconfigurations are of {{international}} interest but remain poorly understood. This {{article focuses on}} the use of evidence by senior managerial decision-makers involved in the reconfiguration of stroke services in London 2008 – 2012. Recent work comparing stroke service reconfiguration in London and Manchester emphasises the ability of senior managerial decision-makers in London to 'hold the line' in the crucial early phases of the stroke reconfiguration programme. In this article, we explore in detail how these decision-makers 'held the line' and ask what the broader power implications of doing so are for the interaction between evidence, health policy and system redesign. Methods: The research combined semi-structured interviews (n = 20) and documentary analysis of historically relevant policy papers and contemporary stroke reconfiguration documentation published by NHS London and other interested parties (n = 125). We applied a critical interpretive and reflexive approach to the analysis of the data. Results: We identified two forms of power which senior managerial decision-makers drew upon in order to 'hold the line'. Firstly, discursive power, which through an emphasis on evidence, better patient outcomes, professional support and clinical credibility alongside a tightly managed consultation process, helped to set an agenda that was broadly receptive to the overall decision to change stroke services in the capital in a radical way. Secondly, once the essential parameters of the decision to change services had been agreed, senior managerial decision-makers 'held the line' through hierarchical New Public Management style power to minimise the traditional pressures to <b>de-radicalise</b> the reconfiguration through 'top down' decision-making. Conclusions: We problematise the concept of 'holding the line' and explore the power implications of such managerial approaches in the early phases of health service reconfiguration. We highlight the importance of evidence for senior managerial decision-makers in agenda setting and the limitations of clinical research findings in guiding politically sensitive policy decisions which impact upon regional healthcare systems...|$|E

40|$|This paper {{considers}} the recent upsurge {{of interest in}} workplace spirituality through an analysis of three cultural movements – late nineteenth century spiritualism, early twentieth century surrealism, and late twentieth/early twenty-first century 'spirituality at work'. These movements share a common interest in harnessing {{the power of the}} human spirit in the transformation and 'betterment' of social life. It is argued that these movements have successively adopted and <b>de-radicalised</b> invocations of the spirit world such that the proto-feminism and utopianism of spiritualism and the revolutionary pretensions of surrealism have been usurped by a strongly managerialist discourse of workplace spirituality. The paper ends with a consideration of the implications of these developments for the critical study of spirituality, management and organisation. Peer-reviewedPost-prin...|$|R

40|$|Since 9 / 11, {{both in the}} Middle East and worldwide, the academic, {{political}} and religious focus on extreme radicalisation has intensified. The attacks carried out in Riyadh, {{the capital of the}} Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, by Al-Qaeda in 2003, motivated a succession of bombings within and outside of the Kingdom. These events have led to a plethora of general and specific studies to understand the phenomenon of extremism. This thesis investigates radicalisation in Saudi Arabia since 2001, focusing on the impact of Al-Qaeda and its impact on individuals and the state. It specifically focuses {{on the role of the}} Mohammed bin Naif Centre for Counselling, Rehabilitation and Care, in this context referred to as ‘the Centre’, analysing its function as a tool for the ‘soft power’ strategy that has been initiated by the Saudi Arabian Government, intended to <b>de-radicalise</b> individuals who are perceived by the state to have been misled. The study uses a detailed literature review to unpack the historical trends regarding the origins of Saudi Arabia, the political differences therein, as well as the different religious interpretations which are attributed as being a root cause of discontent which thereby leads to radicalisation and violent extremism in the region. In this thesis, I trace the various schools of thought regarding the treatment of religion and governance in relation to local and international politics, and how this impacts upon the radicalisation of individuals. A Critical Terrorism Studies (CTS) approach is used to highlight the need to view studies on security from a reflexive perspective, both in the researcher and the researched subject matter, namely the terrorist organisations and the governments against which they are fighting. The concept of governance is analysed and how this either precipitates or prevents dissent that results in violence. In addition, the {{political and}} religious solutions to radicalisation are assessed, with a specific focus on the de-radicalisation process, as reflected through a qualitative research on the views and thinking of the practitioners working in the Centre. In this context, I investigate the motives, roles, responsibilities and strategies used in executing their roles, with the aim of seeking possible explanations for the causes of radicalisation and the challenges faced in de-radicalising individuals. Their views are used to form the main basis for the data for this research. This study should be of interest to politicians, security experts, academics, religious leaders, Islamic scholars and interested individuals. It will be a valuable contribution towards an understanding of the causes, consequences and possible solutions to addressing Islamic extremism and radicalisation...|$|E
40|$|IThis chapter {{explores the}} fate of the emancipatory energy of the December 2001 mobilisation. Many of the demands put forward during the December 2001 events by mobilised {{citizens}} and social and labour movements were incorporated into the state agenda. Yet, QSVT produced an excess that has no grammar in the logic of state power/policy. The process of how QSVT was “translated” into law and policy is discussed with reference to the contentious politics surrounding ‘dignified work’ between the state and radical sectors of the movement of unemployed workers (Piqueteros). Appropriation and integration began with repression (during the December 2001 events and at Pueyrredón Bridge, Avellaneda in June 2002 where two Piqueteros protesters were killed). The later constitute the foundations {{for the creation of a}} new stability that <b>de-radicalised</b> the spirit of QSVT.

40|$|International {{human rights}} declarations, {{conventions}} and protocols {{such as the}} Universal Declaration of Human Rights (UDHR) and the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women (CEDAW), are universally recognised as constituting the basis for demanding and achieving gender equality. They ‘set {{a vision of a}} world where there is justice’ (Cornwall 2015) and today it is widely acknowledged that the normative approach to development should be rights based, even if it’s not the norm in practice. This discord is particularly evident in the women’s rights development discourse. Securing women’s empowerment has increasingly been dominating the international development agenda, but many consider the model being disseminated as <b>de-radicalised,</b> removed from its feminist activist roots and pursuing an apolitical ideology (Cornwall and Molyneux 2006). This in turn promotes and supports a very narrow definition of empowerment; one that does not seek wholesale substantive and transformative change for women and society, but seems to be content to work within and even embrace the existing socio-economic framework...|$|R
40|$|The {{challenge}} for contemporary Green parties in {{government is to}} demonstrate both {{that they have not}} been completely <b>de-radicalised,</b> and that their presence in government can make a difference. Green party involvement in the European Union (EU) adds distinctive elements to this challenge. Does engagement in supranational decision making provide new opportunities for Green parties to exercise influence beyond borders? Or does it simply further exacerbate de-radicalisation tendencies? Focusing on the German and Finnish Green parties, this article explores the 'European dimension' of Green parties' governmental incumbency. Three sets of literature (Europeanisation, party change and EU policy making) are used to derive and test several hypotheses related to the impact of EU involvement on Green parties, and the impact of Green parties on EU policy making. It is argued that EU governmental engagement has accelerated Green party de-radicalisation both organisationally and programmatically, but the dynamics of this process are complex and surprisingly interactive as Greens also attempt to exercise influence over EU policy. The findings are relevant not just for those studying Green parties, but for those exploring wider questions of Europeanisation, party change and EU policy making. ...|$|R
2500|$|The latter United Kingdom set of Acts {{had fallen}} {{short of the}} Chartist aim to enfranchise and to equalise the electorates. [...] Electoral quotas diverged and the gap by 1885 widened; most starkly in the {{retention}} of boroughs of dubious size and a limited attempt at creation of new urban boroughs. [...] In reductions these previous reforms halved rather merged into their surroundings those boroughs (historic towns) having fewer than 10,000 inhabitants as at the 1861 census. In a <b>de-radicalising</b> move a few of largest cities were given three MPs, whereby [...] "no person shall vote {{for more than two}} candidates". As a result, the net partisan impact of these cities tended to be counterbalanced: for example, a borough formerly represented by two Liberals was now usually represented by two Liberals and one Conservative. In a Commons vote on party lines, the Conservative neutralised one of the Liberals, so that the borough counted for one party-based vote albeit having greater and slightly more equalised non-partisan local issue representation. By contrast the mid-size boroughs with two members such as the new creations [...] wherever they so happened to have two MPs of the same party [...] produced twice the voting power in the House as such cities.|$|R
40|$|The thesis {{considers}} {{the argument that}} industrial sociologists have acted as "servants of power". In order to examine this, the diffusion and use of a specific idea - autonomous work groups - was investigated. On examining the origin and potentials of the concept, {{it was concluded that}} the idea of autonomous work groups was potentially radical for the organisation of work. Much attention was found to have been devoted to the autonomous work group in publications, but the notion tended to be <b>de-radicalised.</b> The ways in which this (and similar ideas) reach managers in industry were examined through the activities of 'linkers' - journalists, information-giving organisations, consultants (both academic and commercial), industrial training boards and authors. The mechanics and factors influencing the diffusion of ideas to industry were examined through the study of a specific industry: brewing. It was found that managers neither highly rated, nor actively sought, ideas emanating from industrial sociologists; indeed, they were often antagonistic. Academics were seldom found to have any obvious role in the diffusion of industrial sociology to those in industry. Industrial sociologists are not 'servants of power': the notion is both too simplistic and naive. It is in the nature of our society that the presentation of ideas enhances the existing social order...|$|R
40|$|There has {{recently}} been renewed interest {{in the politics of}} suburbia, however the politics of the working-class suburb remains a neglected subject. Between 1870 and 1914 there was an enormous expansion of working-class suburbs outside the boundaries of the L. C. C. in town such as Walthamstow, Tottenham and Edmonton. This process has been seen by some as having a <b>de-radicalising</b> influence on working-class politics. In this thesis I seek to show that in reality there was a complex politics in suburban Walthamstow involving existing residents, developers and new suburbans in contests over competing visions of the suburb’s destiny as a place. In contrast to the traditional image of the Conservative suburb, we find that Radicalism was successful in establishing itself after 1870 by exploring a growing sense of Walthamstow as a working-class place. As a result Radical-Progressivism became the dominant popular political ideology in Walthamstow between 1894 and 1914. However, this dominance was never uncontested, {{and by the end of}} the period, as Walthamstow’s suburbanity was changing, there were signs that Radicals were having increasing difficulty in maintaining their claim to represent Walthamstow’s working class against challenges from both the left and the right.

40|$|More {{than forty}} years after the Second Wave feminist {{movement}} emerged in the Western world, it is frequently claimed that feminism is “dead” or redundant, and that we now live in a “postfeminist” society. Although such claims are regularly refuted by a range of academics and activists (Baumgardner and Richards, 2001; Lumby, 2011; McRobbie, 2007; National Organisation for Women, 2011; Smith, 2003; Redfern and Aune, 2010; Tasker and Negra, 2007; Thornham and Weissmann, forthcoming; Valenti, 2007; Walby, 2011; Walter, 2010), it is worthwhile interrogating {{the extent to which}} feminism is discussed in popular and political contexts. In light of the persistent and longstanding “backlash” against feminism in Britain and the United States (see Faludi, 1992; Author Removed, 2011 a), is it reasonable to assume that discussions of feminism and discourses utilizing feminist concepts, language and critiques are absent? Furthermore, what does the presence – or erasure – of discourses of feminism tell us about its standing today, and how might such discourses have shifted over time? In answering these questions, this paper traces the emergence of, and changes in the ways feminism has been discursively constructed in British and American newspapers during two periods – 1968 - 82 which I define as the “height” of the Second Wave in both countries, and 2008, a period marking 40 years after the movement began gaining momentum. Through analysing four British (The Times, Daily Mirror, Daily Mail, The Guardian) and American (The New York Times, Washington Post, Chicago Tribune, Washington Times) newspapers, I argue that not only has there been an erasure of feminist activism from our newspapers over time, but that discourses of feminism have become both de-politicised and <b>de-radicalised</b> since the 1960 s, and can now largely be considered neoliberal in nature – a problematic construction for those seeking collective social change...|$|R
40|$|The thesis {{explains}} how terrorism campaigns end, using social movement theory to analyse the Provisional IRA’s disengagement from armed violence {{and how this}} led others in the Irish Republican movement {{to move away from}} violence and remain so. The thesis argues that successful disengagement is dependent on how it is framed {{and the extent to which}} it resonates within the movement. Frame resonance is shaped by the extent it is consistent with the group’s goals, the presence of linkages in order to diffuse the frame, and the perceived credibility of those advocating it. This process ensured that most of the Provisional IRA supported disengagement, which then began to organisationally disengage as part of the peace process. Subsequently, linkages were built up with the Irish Republican movement, leading to the disengagement frame to become <b>de-radicalised,</b> thus providing stronger barriers against violence. The disengagement frame’s resonance in the Irish Republican movement, underpinned by political/structural change, has led to a durable decline in terrorism and political violence. The thesis’ original contribution has five dimensions: 1) the thesis draws on interviews with a broader range of actors typically found in terrorism studies; 2) the re-conceptualisation of de-radicalisation provides nuanced explanations of why attitudinal change is important for ending terrorism; 3) the thesis provides the first multi-level analysis of how terrorism ends by using a social movement approach, thus providing a more comprehensive explanation; 4) while many have recognised the ‘next generation’ as a crucial factor, the thesis is the first to analyse the interaction between generations and how the break in inter-generational support for violence emerges; and 5) the thesis challenges many assumptions on organisational disengagement by outlining how informal networks of combatants continue to exist, but shows how this can actually prevent terrorism rather than just pose a risk to recidivism. ...|$|R
