5|$|With the popularisation of {{the motor}} car, {{it was found that}} plowing alone was {{insufficient}} for removing all snow and ice from the roadway, leading to the development of <b>gritting</b> vehicles, which used sodium chloride to accelerate the melting of the snow. Early attempts at <b>gritting</b> were resisted, as the salt used encouraged rusting, causing damage to the metal structures of bridges and the shoes of pedestrians. However, as the number of motoring accidents increased, the protests subsided {{and by the end of}} the 1920s, many cities in the United States used salt and sand to clear the roads and increase road safety. As environmental awareness increased through the 1960s and 1970s, <b>gritting</b> once again came under criticism due to its environmental impact, leading to the development of alternative de-icing chemicals and more efficient spreading systems.|$|E
5|$|The {{earliest}} winter {{service vehicles}} were snow rollers, designed {{to maintain a}} smooth, even road surface for sleds, although horse-drawn snowplows and <b>gritting</b> vehicles are recorded in use as early as 1862. The increase in motor car traffic and aviation in the early 20th century {{led to the development}} and popularisation of large motorised winter service vehicles.|$|E
5|$|In {{some areas}} of the world, {{including}} Berlin, Germany, dropping salt is prohibited altogether except on the highest-risk roads; plain sand without any melting agents is spread instead. While this may protect the environment, it is more labour-intensive, as more <b>gritting</b> runs are needed; because the sand is insoluble, it tends to accumulate at the sides of the road, making it more difficult for buses to pull in at bus stops.|$|E

50|$|Pretreatment {{may include}} a sand or <b>grit</b> channel or chamber, where the {{velocity}} of the incoming sewage is adjusted to allow the settlement of sand, <b>grit,</b> stones, and broken glass. These particles are removed because they may damage pumps and other equipment. For small sanitary sewer systems, the <b>grit</b> chambers may not be necessary, but <b>grit</b> removal is desirable at larger plants. <b>Grit</b> chambers come in 3 types: horizontal <b>grit</b> chambers, aerated <b>grit</b> chambers and vortex <b>grit</b> chambers. The process is called sedimentation.|$|R
5|$|The {{aggressive}} {{style of}} Sobers and South-Australia captain Les Favell heavily influenced Chappell during his formative years in senior cricket. In 1962–63, Chappell made his initial first-class century against a New South Wales {{team led by}} Australian captain Richie Benaud, who was bemused by the young batsman's habit of <b>gritting</b> his teeth as he faced up; to Benaud, {{it looked as if}} he was grinning. Chappell spent the northern summer of 1963 as a professional in England's Lancashire League with Ramsbottom and played a single first-class match for Lancashire against Cambridge University.|$|E
5|$|Winter service {{vehicles}} are usually {{based on a}} dump truck chassis, which are then converted into winter {{service vehicles}} either by the manufacturer or an aftermarket third-party. A typical modification involves the replacement of steel components of the vehicle with corrosion resistant aluminium or fibreglass, waterproofing any exposed electronic components, replacement of the stock hopper with a specially designed <b>gritting</b> body, {{the addition of a}} plow frame, reinforcement of the wheels, bumpers to support the heavy blade, and the addition of extra headlamps, a light bar, and retroreflectors for visibility.|$|E
5|$|The surface {{friction}} tester {{is a small}} {{fifth wheel}} attached to a hydraulic system mounted on the rear axle of the vehicle, used to measure road slipperiness. The wheel, allowed to roll freely, is slightly turned relative to the ground so that it partially slides. Sensors attached to the axis of the wheel calculate the friction between the wheel and the pavement by measuring the torque produced by {{the rotation of the}} wheel. Surface friction testers are used at airports and on major roadways before ice formation or after snow removal. The vehicle can relay the surface friction data back to the control centre, allowing <b>gritting</b> and clearing to be planned so that the vehicles are deployed most efficiently. Surface friction testers often include a water spraying system, to simulate the effects of rain on the road surface before the rain occurs. The sensors are usually mounted to small compact or estate cars or to a small trailer, rather than the large trucks used for other winter service equipment, as the surface friction tester works best when attached to a lightweight vehicle.|$|E
30|$|Overall, {{this study}} {{examined}} the relationship between personality traits and entrepreneurial intent considering the influence of <b>grit.</b> Our study made a unique contribution in that we introduced <b>grit</b> as a potential mechanism through which personality traits relate to entrepreneurial intent. The results confirmed that there was a strong positive association between <b>grit</b> and entrepreneurial intentions. It was also found that <b>grit</b> shared a significant positive correlation with both agreeableness and conscientiousness. Conversely, there was a significant negative correlation between <b>grit</b> and neuroticism. When the sample was segmented into high and low <b>grit</b> participants, the high <b>grit</b> participants emerged as having significantly higher means scores for entrepreneurial intent than their counterparts in the low <b>grit</b> group. We also found that in comparison with the low <b>grit</b> group, high <b>grit</b> participants had higher means scores for agreeableness and conscientiousness, and lower means scores for neuroticism. Lastly, the data indicated that <b>grit</b> fully mediated the predictive effect of conscientious and neuroticism on entrepreneurial intent.|$|R

This paper presents an investigation {{on the effect of}} difference <b>grit</b> shapes on grinding force and <b>grit</b> holding capacity. Some critical grinding behaviours are analysed in relation to <b>grit</b> shapes to establish a foundation for <b>grit</b> quality assessment. A desirable <b>grit</b> shape is identified for better cutting efficiency and grinding wheel life...|$|R

5|$|Weather {{conditions}} typically {{vary greatly}} depending on altitude; hot countries can experience heavy snowfall in mountainous regions yet receive {{very little in}} low-lying areas, increasing the accident rate among drivers inexperienced in winter driving. In addition, road surface temperatures can fall rapidly at higher altitudes, precipitating rapid frost formation. As a result, <b>gritting</b> and plowing runs are often prioritised in favour of clearing these mountain roads, especially at the start {{and end of the}} snow season. The hazardous roads through mountain passes pose additional problems for the large winter service vehicles. The heavy metal frame and bulky grit makes hill climbing demanding for the vehicle, so vehicles have extremely high torque transmission systems to provide enough power to make the climb. Furthermore, because the tight hairpin turns found on mountain slopes are difficult for long vehicles to navigate, winter service vehicles for use in mountainous areas are shortened, usually from six wheels to four.|$|E

25|$|Salt for {{de-icing}} in the United Kingdom predominantly {{comes from}} a single mine in Winsford in Cheshire. Prior to distribution it is mixed with <100 ppm of sodium hexacyanoferrate(II) as an anti-caking agent, which enables rock salt to flow freely out of the <b>gritting</b> vehicles despite being stockpiled prior to use. In recent years this additive has also been used in table salt. Other additives {{had been used in}} road salt to reduce the total costs. For example, in the US, a byproduct carbohydrate solution from sugar-beet processing was mixed with rock salt and adhered to road surfaces about 40% better than loose rock salt alone. Because it stayed on the road longer, the treatment {{did not have to be}} repeated several times, saving time and money.|$|E
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{investigate}} the relationship between <b>grit</b> and student-athlete academic and sport performance. An exploratory study was conducted using a case study methodology, utilizing both quantitative and qualitative research. The <b>Grit</b> Short Scale (Duckworth, 2007) was employed on student-athletes at an NCAA Division II university in the American Southwest Rocky Mountain Region. Results included a positive correlation between student-athlete <b>grit</b> level and informant <b>grit</b> report, indicating that student-athlete consistently rated their <b>grit</b> higher than their coach rated their <b>grit.</b> Also, in this case study, <b>grit</b> does not account for more predictive value of college academic performance than traditional factors of academic success of college student-athletes. Lastly, through triangulation, two major themes emerged around how head coaches view <b>grit</b> and sport performance: 1) <b>grit</b> increases individual development and sport performance, and 2) team culture is enhanced by increased individual <b>grit.</b> Physical Education, Sports and Exercise SciencesDoctoralUniversity of New Mexico.

30|$|The {{abrasive}} <b>grit</b> size has a {{major influence}} on the surface roughness and the surface finish, the improvement by using a smaller <b>grit</b> size abrasive is significant. During grinding, only a small top region of the abrasive <b>grits</b> is efficient for metal removal, the remaining part is sliding and rubbing the workpiece material (Sin et al. 1979). The coarser <b>grit</b> size abrasives have bigger abrasive particles, causing larger areas of rubbing during grinding; meanwhile, the size and distribution of the abrasive <b>grit</b> grains are more uneven in coarser <b>grit</b> size abrasives; thus, more defects and a worse surface finish have been induced by using coarser <b>grit</b> size abrasives.|$|R
50|$|Concrete can be {{polished}} with Mechanical grinders {{and diamond}} pads of increasing <b>grit</b> sizes.Diamond pads come in many <b>grit</b> or mesh sizes. Common sizes start with 6 <b>grit</b> and {{can go up}} to 8500 <b>grit</b> although concrete can only maintain a shine of about 800 <b>grit,</b> it can be helped by adding a concrete hardener such as sodium silicate or lithium silicate which will allow concrete to hold a 1800 through 3000 <b>grit</b> shine. The work is accomplished in multiple stages by passing over the concrete with successive <b>grit</b> diamond pads until it has a hard-glassy finish. Both acid stains and concrete dyes can be used during the polishing process.|$|R
500|$|Sea salt {{may not be}} used, as it is too {{fine and}} dissolves too quickly, so all salt used in <b>gritting</b> comes from salt mines, a non-renewable source. [...] As a result, some road {{maintenance}} agencies have networks of ice prediction stations, to prevent unnecessary <b>gritting</b> which not only wastes salt, but can damage the environment and disrupt traffic.|$|E
500|$|The {{most common}} {{chemical}} is rock salt, which can melt snow at low temperatures, but has some unwanted side effects. If the salt concentration becomes high enough, {{it can be}} toxic to plant and animal life and greatly accelerate corrosion of metals, so operators should limit <b>gritting</b> to an absolute minimum. The dropped salt is eventually washed away and lost, so {{it may not be}} reused or collected after <b>gritting</b> runs. [...] By contrast, the insoluble sand can be collected and recycled by street sweeping vehicles and mixed with new salt crystals to be reused in later batches of grit.|$|E
500|$|<b>Gritting</b> {{vehicles}} are also dangerous to overtake; as grit is {{scattered across the}} entire roadway, loose pieces can damage the paintwork and windows of passing cars. [...] Loose salt does not provide sufficient traction for motorcycles, {{which can lead to}} skidding, especially around corners.|$|E
25|$|<b>Grit</b> {{varies with}} level of {{education}} and age. More educated adults tend to be higher in <b>grit</b> than less educated individuals of the same age. Post college graduates report higher <b>grit</b> levels than most other education level groups. <b>Grit</b> increases with age when education level is controlled for.|$|R

500|$|In {{winter the}} road is often {{the first of the}} routes between Sheffield and Manchester to be closed {{following}} snow in the area. In bad storms the entire road over the summit, including marker poles, has been buried in snow. In the winter months the road becomes icy, but <b>gritting</b> is not a priority as the A57 is only a [...] "secondary" [...] road at this point. Local councils prefer to treat streets in towns that {{are more likely to be}} used, as they believe that roads such as Snake Pass will be closed anyway.|$|E
500|$|Many winter service {{vehicles}} can be fitted with snowplows, to clear roads which are blocked by deep snow. In most cases, the plows are mounted on hydraulically-actuated arms, {{allowing them to}} be raised, lowered, and angled to better move snow. [...] Most winter {{service vehicles}} include either permanently fixed plows or plow frames: 75% of the UK's Highways Agency vehicles include a plow frame to which a blade can be attached. Winter service vehicles with both a plow frame and a <b>gritting</b> body are known as [...] "all purpose vehicles", and while these are more efficient than using dedicated vehicles, {{the weight of the}} hopper often decreases the range of the vehicle. Therefore, most operators will keep at least a few dedicated plowing vehicles in store for heavy storms.|$|E
40|$|International audienceThe {{ingestion}} of spent Pb shot due to confusion with <b>grit</b> or inadvertently with food particles causes Pb poisoning {{in a large}} number of waterbirds, this being one of the main causes of mortality for some species. Lead ammunition for hunting is being progressively banned in more countries, while <b>grit</b> supplementation has been proposed as a management measure to reduce the {{ingestion of}} deposited Pb shot. Studies of <b>grit</b> selection with waterfowl in semi-captivity and in the wild were undertaken to evaluate preferences in the colour and geochemical composition of <b>grit,</b> whether it was available dry or in water, its position within the wetland and the relationship between <b>grit</b> ingestion and feeding behaviour. <b>Grit</b> ingestion was higher when food was included in the treatments. In the absence of food, red <b>grit</b> was taken in higher amounts than grey in semi-captivity but not in the wild. Siliceous <b>grit</b> was taken in a higher amount than calcareous when offered dry, but not in water. No differences in the amount of ingested <b>grit</b> were found among different positions within the wetland. The number of feeding attempts in plots supplemented with <b>grit</b> was higher than in those without <b>grit,</b> although the highest numbers of feeding birds were found in plots supplemented with food. <b>Grit</b> ingestion in waterfowl is intimately associated with feeding behaviour. To optimize the effectiveness of <b>grit</b> supplementation {{to reduce the risk of}} Pb poisoning in waterfowl, calcareous and siliceous <b>grit</b> may be combined and applied in feeding sites or mixed with bait to attract birds...|$|R

30|$|Duckworth and {{her colleagues}} (2007) also studied <b>grit</b> in {{relation}} to the Big Five personality traits. They found that <b>grit</b> was related to conscientiousness more than any other of the Big Five personality traits. <b>Grit</b> and conscientiousness share variability in their focus on achievement; however, <b>grit</b> is distinct in explaining the unique variability in persevering toward a long-term goal, while conscientiousness is more short-term orientated. Further, <b>grit</b> contributes unique predictive validity over the Big Five.|$|R
