5|$|The gorge, {{which helped}} protect Bristol Harbour, has been quarried for stone {{to build the}} city, and its {{surrounding}} land has been protected from development as The Downs and Leigh Woods. The Avon estuary and the gorge are the county boundary with North Somerset, and the river <b>flows</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> Severn Estuary at Avonmouth. Another gorge, cut by the Hazel Brook (which <b>flows</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> River Trym), crosses the Blaise Castle estate in northern Bristol.|$|E
50|$|San Gorgonio Mountain {{sits on the}} Great Basin Divide, which {{separates}} steams that <b>flow</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> basins of the Basin and Range Province from {{rivers that}} <b>flow</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> Pacific Ocean.|$|R
50|$|Mount French is a {{watershed}} with the creeks flowing west of <b>the</b> mountain ultimately <b>flowing</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> Bremer River, while the creeks flowing east of <b>the</b> mountain ultimately <b>flow</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> Logan River.|$|R
50|$|Lee Vining Creek is a 16.2 mi {{stream in}} Mono County, California, <b>flowing</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> endorheic basin of Mono Lake. It {{is the second}} largest stream <b>flowing</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> lake, after Rush Creek.|$|R

5|$|After {{drawing out}} the Rus armies for nine {{days in a}} feigned retreat, the Mongol army turned to face their pursuers along the Kalka River (the river's {{location}} is currently unknown, but it {{is thought to be}} the Kalchik River which <b>flows</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> Sea of Azov).* Gabriel, Subotai The Valiant: Genghis Khan's Greatest General p. 99.|$|E
5|$|At an {{altitude}} of , Chard {{is one of the}} highest towns in Somerset, and is also the southernmost. The suburbs include: Crimchard, Furnham, Glynswood, Henson Park and Old Town. Local folklore claims that the town has a very unusual and unique feature, a stream running along either side of Fore Street. One stream eventually <b>flows</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> Bristol Channel and the other reaches the English Channel. This situation changed when the tributary of the Axe was diverted into the Isle; the gutter in Holyrood Street, though, still <b>flows</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> River Axe and therefore it is still true it lies on the watershed and that two gutters within the down eventually drain into the Bristol Channel and the English Channel.|$|E

50|$|At {{one time}} the winged mapleleaf {{could be found in}} {{thirteen}} states. It lived in nearly all the rivers and streams that <b>flow</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> Mississippi River. It was once also found in some rivers and streams that <b>flow</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> Missouri River.|$|R
5|$|Early on May 18, an {{earthquake}} measuring 5.1 on the Richter scale struck the region, creating a massive landslide—- of rock that released {{pressure on the}} volcano's crater, causing an ejection of steam. Just seconds later, Mount St. Helens erupted laterally, sending supersonic pyroclastic <b>flows</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> forest below.|$|E
5|$|East River, {{formally}} East River Sheet Harbour, is {{the other}} main river that discharges into Sheet Harbour. It flows through the Marshall Flowage, a large flowage, then past the Ruth Falls Power Plant, a hydropower generating station. It narrows back into a river for a short while, then <b>flows</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> head of the Northeast Arm.|$|E
5|$|The {{northwest}} corner of the peninsula, where the San Diego River <b>flows</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> ocean, is a separate community known as Ocean Beach.

50|$|Rivers which {{start on}} Mount Kenya are the tributaries of two large Kenyan rivers: the Tana and the Ewaso Ng'iro rivers. A lot of Mount Kenyan rivers <b>flow</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> Sagana which {{itself is a}} {{tributary}} of the Tana, which it joins at the Masinga Reservoir. The rivers {{in the northern part of}} the mountain, such as the Burguret, Naru Moru, Nanyuki, Liki, Sirimon <b>flow</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> Ewaso Ng'iro. The rivers to the south-west, such as the Keringa and Nairobi <b>flow</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> Sagana and then <b>into</b> <b>the</b> Tana. The remaining rivers to the south and east, such as the Mutonga, Nithi, Thuchi and Nyamindi, <b>flow</b> directly <b>into</b> <b>the</b> Tana.|$|R
50|$|Rivers radiate {{outwards}} to all sides. Clockwise from windward to leeward, {{the major}} watersheds are: Wynoochee, Humptulips, Quinault, Queets, Hoh, Bogachiel (all <b>flowing</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> Pacific; the Wynoochee {{by way of}} the Chehalis River, and the Humptulips by way of Grays Harbor), Lyre, Elwha, Dungeness (all <b>flowing</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> Strait of Juan de Fuca), Big Quilcene, Dosewallips, Duckabush, Hamma Hamma, and Skokomish (all <b>flowing</b> <b>into</b> Hood Canal).|$|R

5|$|Beginning in North Bay near Lake Nipissing, {{the source}} of the French River which flows down to Georgian Bay, Highway63 travels east through suburbs. It exits the city and travels along the {{northern}} shores of Trout Lake, which serves as the headwaters of the Mattawa River, which <b>flows</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> Ottawa River and eventually the St. Lawrence River. The portion of Highway63 west of Trout Lake travels between these water systems.|$|E
5|$|Burnham-on-Sea {{is notable}} for its beach and mudflats, the danger they pose to {{individuals}} and shipping, and the efforts to which locals have gone in defending their town and preventing loss of life. Burnham {{is close to the}} estuary of the River Parrett where it <b>flows</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> Bristol Channel, which has the second highest tidal range in the world. At , it is second only to the Bay of Fundy in Eastern Canada.|$|E
5|$|Elephant ears have thick bases {{with thin}} tips. The ear flaps, or pinnae, contain {{numerous}} blood vessels called capillaries. Warm blood <b>flows</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> capillaries, helping to release excess body heat into the environment. This {{occurs when the}} pinnae are still, and the animal can enhance the effect by flapping them. Larger ear surfaces contain more capillaries, and more heat can be released. Of all the elephants, African bush elephants live in the hottest climates, and have the largest ear flaps. Elephants are capable of hearing at low frequencies and are most sensitive at 1 kHz.|$|E
50|$|Two other rivers, the Kalmius and <b>the</b> Mius, <b>flow</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> bay. <b>The</b> <b>flow</b> {{of water}} <b>into</b> <b>the</b> bay {{is the chief}} factor for current {{development}} in the Sea of Azov.|$|R

5|$|La Guairita stream <b>flows</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> Guaire {{in northeastern}} El Hatillo. The Guaire river is the eastern {{limit of the}} municipality, {{separating}} it from Sucre and Paz Castillo in the southeastern sector of El Hatillo. La Guairita serves as the northern boundary between El Hatillo and the municipalities of Baruta and Sucre. Limiting Baruta to the west, {{the boundaries of the}} municipality follow El Volcán, Pariaguán, La Mata and other peaks until they meet Turgua range in southeastern El Hatillo.|$|E
5|$|M. rugustus, M. yaotunensis, and M. lashuyuanensis are {{all known}} from the Nanxiong Basin in Guangdong. This {{formation}} was deposited primary from streams, rivers, and lakes in that region. It spans across the K/T boundary, at which point most of the dinosaur eggs disappear, but Macroolithus apparently exists {{on both sides of}} the boundary (which would imply that some species of dinosaurs survived into the early Tertiary). However, sedimentological evidence suggests that these fossils were actually reworked by debris <b>flows</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> Tertiary rocks.|$|E
50|$|Sediments <b>flowed</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> basin. Water {{entered the}} basin.|$|R
50|$|The major {{rivers in}} Sullivan County are Loyalsock Creek and Muncy Creek. Both <b>flow</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> West Branch of the Susquehanna River. Some streams {{along the eastern}} border of <b>the</b> county <b>flow</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> North Branch of the Susquehanna River. All of Sullivan county is thus within the Chesapeake Bay Watershed.|$|R
25|$|There was a tidemill. When {{the tide}} was rising, water <b>flowed</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> mill pond driving a mill, when {{the tide was}} falling, water <b>flowed</b> back <b>into</b> <b>the</b> river, driving the mill.|$|R
5|$|On the {{outskirts}} of Bridgwater at Huntworth the river passes several local nature reserves which provide roosts for thousands of common starlings (Sturnus vulgaris) each winter. The mouth of the river is where it <b>flows</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> National Nature Reserve at Bridgwater Bay on the Bristol Channel. It consists of large areas of mudflats, saltmarsh, sandflats and shingle ridges, {{some of which are}} vegetated. It has been designated as a Site of Special Scientific Interest since 1989, and is designated as a wetland of international importance under the Ramsar Convention. The risks to wildlife are highlighted in the local Oil Spill Contingency Plan.|$|E
5|$|Salinity {{differences}} between the sections of the lake separated by the railroad causeway result in significantly different biota. A phytoplankton community dominated by green algae or cyanobacteria (blue-green algae) tint the water south of the causeway a greenish color. North of the causeway, the lake is dominated by Dunaliella salina, a species of algae which releases beta-carotene, and the bacteria-like haloarchaea, which together give the water an unusual reddish or purplish color, and the bacteria converts non-toxic mercury into toxic methyl mercury, which then <b>flows</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> Southern portion of the lake in a heavy brine layer through the causeway.|$|E
5|$|The Great Salt Lake is fed {{by three}} major rivers and several minor streams. The three major rivers are each fed {{directly}} or indirectly from the Uinta Mountain range in northeastern Utah. The Bear River starts on the north slope of the Uintas and flows north past Bear Lake, into which some of Bear River's waters have been diverted via a man-made canal into the lake, but later empty back into the river {{by means of the}} Bear Lake Outlet. The river then turns south in southern Idaho and eventually <b>flows</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> northeast arm of the Great Salt Lake. The Weber River also starts on the north slope of the Uinta Mountains and <b>flows</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> east edge of the lake. The Jordan River does not receive its water directly from the Uintas, rather it flows from freshwater Utah Lake, which itself is fed primarily by the Provo River; the Provo River does originate in the Uintas, {{a few miles from the}} Weber and Bear. The Jordan flows from the north part of Utah Lake into the southeast corner of the Great Salt Lake.|$|E
25|$|Other rivers <b>flow</b> either {{directly}} <b>into</b> <b>the</b> Pacific Ocean or {{directly or indirectly}} <b>into</b> <b>the</b> Arctic Ocean. The Alsek-Tatshenshini drainage <b>flows</b> directly <b>into</b> <b>the</b> Pacific from southwestern Yukon. A number of rivers in northern Yukon <b>flow</b> directly <b>into</b> <b>the</b> Arctic Ocean. The two main Yukon rivers <b>flowing</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> Mackenzie River in the Northwest Territories are the Liard River in the southeast and the Peel River and its tributaries in the northeast.|$|R
