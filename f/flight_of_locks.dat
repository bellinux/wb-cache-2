5|$|In 1801, trade {{along the}} canal commenced; goods {{initially}} {{had to be}} unloaded at Foxhangers {{at the bottom of}} what is now Caen Hill Locks, transported up the hill by a horse-drawn railway, and reloaded into barges at the top. When the <b>flight</b> <b>of</b> <b>locks</b> opened in 1810, allowing the same vessel to navigate the entire canal, the rate of carriage per ton from London to Bath was £29s6d. This compared well with carriage by road, which cost £63s to £7 per ton, and trade on the canal flourished. In 1812, the Kennet and Avon Canal Company bought the Kennet Navigation, which stretched from Newbury to the junction with the Thames at Kennet Mouth, near Reading. The purchase from Frederick Page cost £100,000, of which £70,000 was paid in cash with the balance paid back gradually. The purchase was authorised by the Kennet Navigation Act of June 1813, which enabled the company to raise the funds through the sale of 5,500 shares at £24 each. At the same time work was undertaken to improve the Avon Navigation, from Bristol to Bath, with the Kennet and Avon Canal Company purchasing a majority shareholding in the Avon Navigation in 1816.|$|E
5|$|There are a {{total of}} 105 locks on the Kennet and Avon Canal from Bristol to the River Thames, {{including}} 6 on the navigable section of the River Avon from Bristol to Bath and 9 on the navigable section of the River Kennet to its confluence with the Thames near Reading. The remaining 90 locks lie along the 57miles (92km) of canal. In Bath the canal separates from the river but follows its valley as far as Bradford on Avon. The ornate Bath Locks lead to a stretch through Limpley Stoke valley with few locks. The <b>flight</b> <b>of</b> <b>locks</b> at Devizes, including the Caen Hill Locks, raises the canal to its longest pound, which then ascends the 4 Wooton Rivers locks to the short summit pound which includes the Bruce Tunnel. Pumping stations are used to supply the canal with water. The canal continues through the rural landscape of Wiltshire and Berkshire before joining the River Kennet at Newbury and becoming a navigable river to Reading, where it flows into the River Thames.|$|E
50|$|After {{the initial}} <b>flights</b> <b>of</b> <b>locks,</b> most <b>of</b> the canal {{followed}} the 161 ft (49.1m) contour.|$|R
25|$|Water was a {{precious}} resource, spent {{each time a}} lock was emptied as a boat changed level. Steam pumps were employed at many <b>flights</b> <b>of</b> <b>locks</b> to pump water back to a higher level, for example, the Smethwick Engine.|$|R
50|$|The Leeds and Liverpool Canal {{passes through}} Bingley. There are several <b>flights</b> <b>of</b> <b>locks</b> in the Bingley section, the famous Five Rise Locks, the smaller Three Rise and a further two lock flight at Dowley Gap. The canal climbs steeply {{up the side}} of the Aire valley through this section.|$|R
25|$|The canal then {{reaches the}} Claydon <b>flight</b> <b>of</b> <b>locks</b> and descends {{into the valley}} of the River Cherwell at Cropredy (the canal descends the river valley all the way from here to Oxford).|$|E

25|$|In February 1977 a job {{creation}} project {{started with the}} aim of carrying out restoration work on the Deepcut <b>flight</b> <b>of</b> <b>locks.</b> The work was coordinated with the work of the canal society who organised work parties at weekends while the {{job creation}} team worked on weekdays.|$|E

25|$|In 2015 the Runcorn Locks Restoration Society {{launched}} its Unlock Runcorn campaign, which {{is dedicated to}} reopening the <b>flight</b> <b>of</b> <b>locks</b> in Runcorn's Old Town. The society believes {{that the increase in}} passing boat trade that would come from reopening the locks has the potential to bring economical, recreational and social benefits to people within the region.|$|E
25|$|Nearby {{there are}} the {{historic}} buildings of Packwood House and Baddesley Clinton now {{in the care of}} the National Trust, and the Grand Union Canal is in walking distance with both the Heron's Nest and Black Boy pubs being accessible. The Stratford-upon-Avon Canal also links in and is notable for a large <b>flight</b> <b>of</b> <b>locks</b> that descend into nearby Lapworth from Birmingham.|$|E
25|$|The {{building}} lies on a gently sloping {{river gravel}} terrace, a common {{feature of the}} Thames Valley. The land immediately to the east was further eroded by the River Brent, which flows along its eastern perimeter. At its southern boundary is the Grand Union Canal and a flight of six locks. Both the southern wall of the old asylum and the <b>flight</b> <b>of</b> <b>locks</b> have been designated a Scheduled Ancient Monument.|$|E
25|$|The ring is 74 {{miles and}} {{includes}} 105 locks including 3 electrically operated river <b>locks,</b> 2 pairs <b>of</b> staircase <b>locks</b> and 2 broad locks. The route includes <b>flights</b> <b>of</b> <b>locks</b> at Tardebigge (x30), Stourbridge (x16) and the Black Delph at Brierley Hill (x8). The route also includes {{two of the}} longest navigable tunnels on the UK network, these being the Netherton and Wast Hills Tunnels.|$|R

25|$|During its working life, packet boats {{provided}} an express passenger service between Preston and Lancaster, {{and later to}} Kendal at , with passengers walking up or down the <b>flight</b> <b>of</b> <b>locks</b> at Tewitfield and embarking on a second boat. The seven-hour journey time halved the best speeds of stage coaches; because of {{the comfort of the}} journey, passengers stayed loyal to the packet boats even after the advent of railway competition in the 1840s.|$|E
25|$|From the Thames Lock, {{the canal}} and the River Brent {{are one and}} the same, and the {{waterway}} is semi-tidal until the double Gauging Lock (lock 100) at Brentford is reached. Just upstream of the Gauging Lock was a large canal basin, now known as Brentford Lock, from which the canal continues to follow the course of the River Brent through two more locks. The river and canal part company {{at the base of the}} Hanwell <b>flight</b> <b>of</b> <b>locks</b> (92–97), before two more locks take the canal to Norwood Green. It then heads westward over level ground through Southall, Hayes and West Drayton until it reaches the valley of the River Colne where it swings northward to Cowley through Uxbridge.|$|E
25|$|By 1870 the Anderton Basin {{was a major}} {{interchange}} for trans-shipping {{goods in}} both directions, with extensive warehousing, three double inclined planes and four salt chutes. Trans-shipment was time-consuming and expensive, and the Trustees of the Weaver Navigation decided {{a link between the}} waterways was needed to allow boats to pass directly from one to the other. A <b>flight</b> <b>of</b> <b>locks</b> was considered but discarded, mainly {{because of the lack of}} a suitable site and the loss of water that would have resulted from using them. In 1870 the Trustees proposed a boat lift between the waterways at the Anderton Basin. The Trustees approached the North Staffordshire Railway Company, owners of the Trent and Mersey Canal, to ask for a contribution towards the cost. When this approach was unsuccessful the Trustees decided to fund the project themselves.|$|E

500|$|The Bridgewater {{is often}} {{considered}} to be the first true canal in Britain, as it relied upon existing watercourses as sources of water rather than as navigable routes. [...] It now terminates in Runcorn basin, just before the disused flight of 10 locks which (before the approach road to the Silver Jubilee Bridge was built) used to lower the canal to the Runcorn Docks on the River Mersey and later, to the Manchester Ship Canal. The old line of locks in Runcorn fell into disuse in the late 1930s, and they were closed under the Ship Canal Act of 1949 and filled in. The Ship Canal Act of 1966 allowed the closure and filling in of the newer line of locks. [...] The gates from this <b>flight</b> <b>of</b> <b>locks</b> were removed and installed at Devizes on the Kennet and Avon Canal. [...] The Duke's warehouse in Manchester was demolished in 1960.|$|E
500|$|Together with British Waterways, the Inland Waterways Association and the Waterway Recovery Group, the Society {{began the}} work of {{restoration}} of the canal to navigation, a process which is still ongoing. A major development was the granting of permission in 1992 to remove an old railway embankment, which blocked the route {{near the top of}} the Woolsthorpe <b>flight</b> <b>of</b> <b>locks.</b> The task was completed by a number of Waterway Recovery Group workcamps. New gates were fitted to the top three locks, and rebuilding of Casthorpe bridge was funded by Lincolnshire County Council, opening up [...] of the canal for navigation. Further down the canal, restoration of a [...] section between Hickling Basin and Hose was funded by a derelict land grant of £400,000, received in 1993. The Grantham Canal Partnership was formed in 1997, as a way to take the project forwards. It consisted of representatives from each of the six local authorities through which the route passes, British Waterways, the Inland Waterways Association, the Grantham Canal Restoration Society and the Grantham Navigation Association, a group which had split off from the Canal Society in 1992. As a result of the co-operation, British Waterways formulated a draft business plan for the canal.|$|E

2500|$|On English canals, these {{reservoirs}} {{are called}} [...] "side ponds". The Droitwich Canal, reopened in 2011, has a <b>flight</b> <b>of</b> three <b>locks</b> at Hanbury which all have operational side ponds. Side ponds were also {{installed on the}} Grand Union Canal and the Coventry Canal, among others. They are now out of use, {{and in some cases}} have been filled in, because British Waterways considered that it was too easy to misuse them and flood the surrounding area. [...] On some <b>flights</b> <b>of</b> <b>locks</b> with short intermediate pounds, the pounds are extended sideways – in effect to provide a reservoir to ensure that the pound does not run dry (in case, for instance, the lock below leaks more than the lock above). These extended intermediate pounds are sometimes confused with side ponds.|$|R

2500|$|Loosely, a <b>flight</b> <b>of</b> <b>locks</b> {{is simply}} a series of locks in close-enough {{proximity}} {{to be identified as}} a single group. For many reasons, a <b>flight</b> <b>of</b> <b>locks</b> is preferable to the same number of locks spread more widely: crews are put ashore and picked up once, rather than multiple times; transition involves a concentrated burst of effort, rather than a continually interrupted journey; a lock keeper may be stationed to help crews through the flight quickly; and where water is in short supply, a single pump can recycle water {{to the top of the}} whole flight. The need for a flight may be determined purely by the lie of the land, but it is possible to group locks purposely into flights by using cuttings or embankments to [...] "postpone" [...] the height change. Examples: Caen Hill locks, Devizes.|$|E
2500|$|Each <b>flight</b> <b>of</b> <b>locks</b> is {{accompanied}} by nine water reutilization basins (three per lock chamber), each basin being about [...] wide, [...] long and [...] deep. These gravity-fed basins allow 60% of the water used in each transit to be reused; the new locks consequently use 7% less water per transit than each of the existing lock lanes. The deepening of Gatun Lake and the raising of its maximum water level also provide capacity for significantly more water storage. These measures are intended to allow the expanded canal to operate without constructing new reservoirs.|$|E
2500|$|The Falkirk Wheel, the world's first {{rotating}} boat lift, {{acts as the}} centrepiece of {{the restoration}} of the Forth and Clyde and Union Canals. The spectacular [...] "Wheel" [...] presents the 21st century's solution to replacing a <b>flight</b> <b>of</b> <b>locks</b> which formerly connected the canals and which were filled-in in 1930. The Falkirk Wheel was the winning design in a competition to design a new lock. Visitors can now take a boat trip on the Wheel and be lifted over [...] in a few minutes compared to the time it took when the original lock staircase operated.|$|E
