Alfalfa pollination is somewhat problematic, however, because western honey bees, {{the most commonly used}} pollinator, are less than ideal for this purpose; the pollen-carrying keel of the alfalfa flower trips and strikes pollinating bees on the head, which helps transfer the pollen to the <b>foraging</b> <b>bee.</b> Western honey bees, however, do not like being struck in the head repeatedly and learn to defeat this action by drawing nectar {{from the side of the}} flower. The bees thus collect the nectar, but carry no pollen, so do not pollinate the next flower they visit. Because older, experienced bees do not pollinate alfalfa well, most pollination is accomplished by young bees that have not yet learned the trick of robbing the flower without tripping the head-knocking keel. When western honey bees are used to pollinate alfalfa, the beekeeper stocks the field at a very high rate to maximize the number of young bees.|$|E

50|$|To find a food source, Trigona fuscipennis bees often rely on food odors. Once {{they found}} a {{preferred}} odor, they returned to flowers with the same scent, and new recruited individuals also visit the same floral scent as the first <b>foraging</b> <b>bee.</b> They use pheromones in odor trails to communicate {{the location of the}} food source. Some bees use local enhancement or local inhibition to find food sources. Local enhancement is used to describe the attraction of animals to a food source due to the presence of other feeding individuals or to odors left behind by individuals previously at the site.

50|$|A {{bumblebee}} nest differs in {{size and}} structure {{from that of a}} honeybee. Bumblebee nests are smaller and contain far fewer individuals which is mostly due to differences in the method of colony reproduction. Honeybee colonies can contain up to 20000 individuals whereas bumblebee colonies usually only contain a few hundred. This means the number of bees available for foraging is low and resources must be allocated accordingly. Assessing the level of food stores is not seen in honeybees, likely because the large colonies make such assessment inefficient. Bumblebees only store enough honey for a few days. By monitoring the levels of the honey pots a bumblebee colony can either up or down regulate the number of bees out foraging. Lab experiments by Anna Dornhaus and Lars Chittka in 2005 showed evidence of this up or down regulation by monitoring the activity level of the hive after the addition of ‘nectar ’ to the honey pots. Hive activity increased when high quality nectar was injected into the honey pots, provided the wells weren’t already full. When the honey pots were full, there was no significant change in activity regardless of whether the nectar imported was from a high or low quality source. They hypothesized that either the <b>foraging</b> <b>bee</b> does not signal the nest or the nest bees ignore the signal because the demand for food is low. The tropical bumblebee Bombus transversalis has also been shown to respond to honey pot levels in a similar way.|$|E

As a solitary but gregarious bee species, it does not build colonies or store honey, but is a very efficient pollinator of alfalfa flowers.

40|$|Honeybees {{have become}} {{important}} tools for the ecotoxicological assessment of soil, water and air metal contamination {{due to their}} extraordinary capacity to bioaccumulate toxic metals from the environment. The level of heavy metal pollution in the Trieste city was monitored using <b>foraging</b> <b>bees</b> of Apis mellifera ligustica from hives owned by beekeepers in two sites strategically located in the suburban industrial area and urban ones chosen as control. The metal concentration in <b>foraging</b> <b>bees</b> was determined by inductively coupled plasma-mass spectrometry. The chemical analysis has identified and quantified 11 trace elements accumulated in two different rank orders: Zn> Cu > Sr > Bi > Ni > Cr > Pb = Co > V > Cd > As in <b>foraging</b> <b>bees</b> from the suburban site and Zn > Cu > Sr > Cr > Ni > Bi > Co = V > Pb > As > Cd in bees from urban site. Data revealed concentrations of Cr and Cu significantly higher and concentration of Cd significantly lower in bees from urban sites. The spatial difference and magnitude order in heavy metal accumulation along the urban-suburban gradient are mainly related to the different anthropogenic activity within sampled sites and represent a risk for the human health {{of people living in}} the city.

The majority of wild bee species nest in the ground, and their nests may be susceptible to flooding. In addition, their pollination of crops can be influenced by nectar quality and quantity, which are related to water availability. To determine whether different irrigation methods affect crop pollinators, we compared the number of ground-nesting bees nesting and foraging in drip- and furrow-irrigated hybrid sunflower fields in the Sacramento Valley. We found that irrigation method did not impact wild bee nesting rates or <b>foraging</b> <b>bee</b> abundance or bee species richness.

40|$|To achieve good {{pollination}} {{bees are}} required to actively forage as many flowers in both genders as possible {{before returning to the}} hive. To facilitate multiple visits of bees to the same flower it would be expected that the nectar would be replenished to maintain the food reward value of the flower. 'Hass' avocado flowers were sampled after visits by bees and after a period of bagging to determine if the flowers replenish their nectar following honey bee foraging. The nectar sugar content and volume of flowers in the female gender were sampled after visits from foraging bees and compared to nectar samples from the same flowers {{two and a half hours}} later and the nectar content of flowers not visited by bees or sampled by micropipette. Bees foraging on avocado flowers were calculated to have removed an average of two thirds of the nectar present. Whether nectar was removed by a <b>foraging</b> <b>bee</b> or by micropipette the nectar sugar content or volume did not replenish to the original level in ‘Hass ’ avocado flowers in the female gender. The stage of flower opening appeared to influence the nectar sugar content and volume with the female F 2 f stage flowers having the most nectar sugar and volume. The lack of nectar replenishment in New Zealand 'Hass ' avocado flowers would indicate that multiple bee visits to the flowers is not based solely on the food reward of the flowers...|$|E
40|$|Vision {{is one of}} {{the most}} {{important}} modalities for the remote perception of biologically important stimuli. Insects like honeybees and bumblebees use their colour and spatial vision to solve tasks, such as navigation, or to recognise rewarding flowers during <b>foraging.</b> <b>Bee</b> vision {{is one of the}} most intensively studied animal visual systems, and several models have been developed to describe its function. These models have largely assumed that bee vision is determined by mechanistic hard-wired circuits, with little or no consideration for behavioural plasticity or cognitive factors. However, recent work on both bee colour vision and spatial vision suggests that cognitive factors are indeed a very significant factor in determining what a bee sees. Individual bumblebees trade-off speed for accuracy, and will decide on which criteria to prioritise depending upon contextual information. With continued visual experience, honeybees can learn to use non-elemental processing, including configural mechanisms and rule learning, and can access top-down information to enhance learning of sophisticated, novel visual tasks. Honeybees can learn delayed-matching-to-sample tasks and the rules governing this decision making, and even transfer learned rules between different sensory modalities. Finally, bees can learn complex categorisation tasks and display numerical processing abilities for numbers up to and including four. Taken together, this evidence suggests that bees do have a capacity for sophisticated visual behaviours that fit a definition for cognition, and thus simple elemental models of bee vision need to take account of how a variety of factors may influence the type of results one may gain from animal behaviour experiments...|$|E

40|$|Although {{several studies}} have {{examined}} how honeybees gauge and report the distance and direction of a food source to their nestmates, relatively {{little is known about}} how this information is combined to obtain a representation of the position of the food source. In this study we manipulate the amount of celestial compass information available to the bee during flight, and analyse the encoding of spatial information in the waggle dance {{as well as in the}} navigation of the <b>foraging</b> <b>bee.</b> We find that the waggle dance encodes information about the total distance flown to the food source, even when celestial compass cues are available only for a part of the journey. This stands in contrast to how a bee gauges distance flown when it navigates back to a food source that it already knows. When bees were trained to find a feeder placed at a fixed distance in a tunnel in which celestial cues were partially occluded and then tested in a tunnel that was fully open to the sky, they searched for the feeder at a distance that corresponds closely to the distance that was flown under the open sky during the training. Thus, when navigating back to a food source, information about distance travelled is disregarded when there is no concurrent input from the celestial compass. We suggest that bees may possess two different odometers – a `community 2 ̆ 7 odometer that is used to provide information to nestmates via the dance, and a `personal 2 ̆ 7 odometer that is used by an experienced individual to return to a previously visited source...|$|E
40|$|Pollen {{movement}} {{within and}} among plants affects inbreeding, plant fitness, and the spatial scale of genetic differentiation. Although {{a number of}} studies have assessed how plant and floral traits influence pollen movement via changes in pollinator behavior, few have explored how nectar chemical composition affects pollen transfer. As many as 55 % of plants produce secondary compounds in their nectar, which is surprising given that nectar is typically thought to attract pollinators. We tested the hypothesis that nectar with secondary compounds may benefit plants by encouraging pollinators to leave plants after visiting only a few flowers, thus reducing self-pollen transfer. We used Gelsemium sempervirens, a plant whose nectar contains the alkaloid gelsemine, which has been shown to be a deterrent to <b>foraging</b> <b>bee</b> pollinators. We found that high nectar alkaloids reduced the total and proportion of self-pollen received by one-half and one-third, respectively. However, nectar alkaloids did not affect female reproduction when we removed the potential for self-pollination (by emasculating all flowers on plants). We then tested the assumption that self-pollen in combination with outcrossed pollen depresses seed set. We found that plants were weakly self-compatible, but self-pollen with outcrossed pollen did not reduce seed set relative to solely outcrossed flowers. Finally, an exponential model of pollen carryover suggests that high nectar alkaloids could benefit plants via increased pollen export (an estimate of male function), but only when pollinators were efficient and abundant and plants had large floral displays. Results suggest that high nectar alkaloids may benefit plants via increased pollen export under a restricted set of ecological conditions, but in general, the costs of high nectar alkaloids in reducing pollination balanced or outweighed the benefits of reducing self-pollen transfer for estimates of female and male reproduction.

40|$|An {{ecological}} {{risk assessment}} evaluating potential adverse affects to non-target arthropods is necessary when releasing a novel transgenic crop. Field studies {{were conducted to}} assess tritrophic level effects of insecticide treated and untreated Bt and non-Bt sweet corn hybrids on the abundances, species diversity and functional processes of foliage-dwelling, aerial and soil surface arthropods. The diversity and abundance of decomposers, predators and parasitoids were determined by plant inspections, sticky card, and pitfall trap sampling for two years at two Maryland locations. Functional processes including predation, parasitism, reproduction and colonization were evaluated at one location over three years. Predation rates were estimated from sentinel egg masses of a lepidopteran; levels of parasitism were measured from naturally-occurring chrysopid eggs; emergence traps determined the recruitment rates of arthropods emerging from soil-litter; and litterbags measured arthropod colonization and litter degradation rates. Beneficial arthropod communities and functional processes were not significantly affected by exposure to Bt sweet corn. Insecticides significantly reduced arthropod diversity and abundance {{as well as the}} rate of predation, parasitism, colonization and recruitment of organisms. Less disruption occurred in Bt plots treated once than compared with non-Bt plots treated five times. Since the number of insecticide applications are reduced, planting Bt sweet corn will result in benefits to non-target arthropods and ecological processes. A second aspect of the ecological risk assessment focused on laboratory and field studies to evaluate the effects of Bt pollen on honey bee survival, brood development and foraging behavior. Results also were used to examine the statistical power of study protocols. Laboratory tests showed no effects of feeding on Bt pollen on survival or hypopharyngeal gland development measured indirectly by head weight gain of newly-emerged bees. In field studies conducted for two years at three locations, colonies foraging in sweet corn plots and fed Bt pollen cakes for 28 days showed no adverse effects on bee weight, hive strength, brood development and foraging behavior. <b>Foraging</b> <b>bee</b> weight, number of foragers returning with pollen loads, pollen load weight, and brood size were the most reliable endpoints to examine for non-target effects on the general fitness of colonies...|$|E

Foraging bees are collected from beehives located in S.

The statistical comparison showed a smaller diameter of the acini of hypopharyngeal gland of bees from suburban site (0. 080 mm ± 0. 003), compared to those of urban site (0. 114 mm ± 0. 004). Statistical analysis showed an highly significant difference in the size of the acini between the site of Domio (Wilcoxon rank sum test, p = 1. 651 x 10 - 7) compared to the site of S. Giovanni.
