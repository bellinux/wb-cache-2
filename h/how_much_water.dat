5|$|Air {{contains}} water vapor, and {{the amount}} of water in a given mass of dry air, known as the mixing ratio, is measured in grams of water per kilogram of dry air (g/kg). The amount of moisture in air is also commonly reported as relative humidity; which is the percentage of the total water vapor air can hold at a particular air temperature. <b>How</b> <b>much</b> <b>water</b> vapor a parcel of air can contain before it becomes saturated (100%relative humidity) and forms into a cloud (a group of visible and tiny water and ice particles suspended above the Earth's surface) depends on its temperature. Warmer air can contain more water vapor than cooler air before becoming saturated. Therefore, one way to saturate a parcel of air is to cool it. The dew point is the temperature to which a parcel must be cooled in order to become saturated.|$|E
25|$|The Thermal and Evolved Gas Analyzer (TEGA) is a {{combination}} of a high-temperature furnace with a mass spectrometer. It was used to bake samples of Martian dust and determine its content. It has eight ovens, each {{about the size of a}} large ball-point pen, which were able to analyze one sample each, for a total of eight separate samples. Team members measured <b>how</b> <b>much</b> <b>water</b> vapor and carbon dioxide gas were given off, <b>how</b> <b>much</b> <b>water</b> ice the samples contained, and what minerals are present that may have formed during a wetter, warmer past climate.

25|$|In 2003, California {{suffered}} from an extended drought, {{and there was}} considerable discussion and debate about <b>how</b> <b>much</b> <b>water</b> each water district was entitled to receive from the Colorado River and its tributaries. As a result, several organizations negotiated an agreement for water rights for their associated districts: the San Diego County Water Authority, the Coachella Valley Water District, the Imperial Irrigation District, the Metropolitan Water District of Southern California, and the U.S. Department of the Interior. The agreement was a compromise that divided available water resources between the environmentally fragile Imperial Valley and the more heavily populated areas of Southern California.|$|E
25|$|The {{human body}} {{contains}} from 55% to 78% water, depending on body size. To function properly, the body requires {{between one and}} seven liters of water per day to avoid dehydration; the precise amount depends {{on the level of}} activity, temperature, humidity, and other factors. Most of this is ingested through foods or beverages other than drinking straight water. It is not clear <b>how</b> <b>much</b> <b>water</b> intake is needed by healthy people, though most specialists agree that approximately 2 liters (6 to 7 glasses) of water daily is the minimum to maintain proper hydration. Medical literature favors a lower consumption, typically 1 liter of water for an average male, excluding extra requirements due to fluid loss from exercise or warm weather.|$|E

25|$|In {{contrast}} with clinical tools, one relatively inexpensive {{type of body}} fat meter uses the principle of bioelectrical impedance analysis (BIA) {{in order to determine}} an individual's body fat percentage. To achieve this, the meter passes a small, harmless, electric current through the body and measures the resistance, then uses information on the person's weight, height, age, and sex to calculate an approximate value for the person's body fat percentage. The calculation measures the total volume of water in the body (lean tissue and muscle contain a higher percentage of water than fat), and estimates the percentage of fat based on this information. The result can fluctuate several percentage points depending on what has been eaten and <b>how</b> <b>much</b> <b>water</b> has been drunk before the analysis.|$|E
25|$|The term {{water stress}} {{describes}} the physiological states that grapevines experience {{when they are}} deprived of water. When a grapevine goes into water stress one of its first functions {{is to reduce the}} growth of new plant shoots which compete with the grape clusters for nutrients and resources. The lack of water also keeps the individual grape berries down to a smaller size which increase its skin to juice ratio. As the skin is filled with color phenols, tannin and aroma compounds, the increase in skin-to-juice ratio is desirable for the potential added complexity the wine may have. While there is disagreement over exactly <b>how</b> <b>much</b> <b>water</b> stress is beneficial in development grapes for quality wine production, most viticulturist agree that some water stress can be beneficial. The grapevines in many Mediterranean climates such as Tuscany in Italy and the Rhone Valley in France experience natural water stress due to the reduced rainfall that occurs during the summer growing season.|$|E
25|$|It was {{traditionally}} thought (especially by the Aristotelians) {{that the}} air did not have lateral weight: that is, that the kilometers of air above the surface did not exert any weight on the bodies below it. Even Galileo had accepted the weightlessness of air as a simple truth. Torricelli questioned that assumption, and instead proposed that air had weight {{and that it was}} the latter (not the attracting force of the vacuum) which held (or rather, pushed) up the column of water. He thought that the level the water stayed at (c. 10.3m) was reflective of the force of the air's weight pushing on it (specifically, pushing on the water in the basin and thus limiting <b>how</b> <b>much</b> <b>water</b> can fall from the tube into it). In other words, he viewed the barometer as a balance, an instrument for measurement (as opposed to merely being an instrument to create a vacuum), and because {{he was the first to}} view it this way, he is traditionally considered the inventor of the barometer (in the sense in which we now use the term).|$|E

25|$|Arizona v. California {{was a set}} of 11 United States Supreme Court cases {{dealing with}} water rights. These cases took place between the years of 1931 and 2006. The initial {{question}} of this case was to determine <b>how</b> <b>much</b> <b>water</b> from the Colorado river Arizona was entitled to. Many western states {{became involved in the}} debate over the rights of the water from the Colorado River, and finally the United States government became involved stating that several federal establishments, including five American Indian reservations, had water rights as defined by Winters v. United States. This United States Supreme Court case helped to solve a problem found in the case Winters v. United States. While the United States Supreme Court case of Winters v. United States held that American Indian Reservations do have reserved water rights equal to the amount of water needed on the reservation to sufficiently irrigate all of the irrigable reservation acreage, there was always {{the question of how to}} decide what amount of water was needed to sufficiently irrigate on the American Indian reservations. Arizona v. California offers the solution of adjudication to help fix this problem.|$|E
25|$|Because of the {{problems}} associated with water-logged and wet soils, it is important for viticulturist to know <b>how</b> <b>much</b> <b>water</b> is currently in the soil before deciding if and how much to irrigate. There are several methods of evaluating soil moisture. The most basic is simple observation and feeling of the soil, however this has its limitations since the subsoil may be moist while the surface soil appears dry. More specific measurements can be attained by using tensiometers which evaluates surface tension of water extracted from the soil. The presence of water in the soil can be measured by neutron moisture meters that utilize an aluminium tube with an internal neutron source that detect the subtle change between the water in the soil. Similarly, gypsum block placed throughout the vineyard contain an electrode {{that can be used to}} detect the electrical resistance that occurs as the soil dries and water is released by evaporation. Since the 1990s there has been greater research into tools utilizing time-domain reflectometry and capacitance probes. In addition to monitoring for excessive moisture, viticulturists also keep an eye for signs of water stress (discussed below) due to severe lack of water.|$|E
