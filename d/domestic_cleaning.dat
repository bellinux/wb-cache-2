500|$|Hydrochloric acid is {{produced}} in solutions up to 38% HCl (concentrated grade). Higher concentrations up to just over 40% are chemically possible, but the evaporation rate is then so high that storage and handling require extra precautions, such as pressurization and cooling. Bulk industrial-grade is therefore 30% to 35%, optimized to balance transport efficiency and product loss through evaporation. In the United States, solutions of between 20% and 32% are sold as muriatic acid. Solutions for household purposes in the US, mostly cleaning, are typically 10% to 12%, with strong recommendations to dilute before use. In the United Kingdom, where it is sold as [...] "Spirits of Salt" [...] for <b>domestic</b> <b>cleaning,</b> the potency {{is the same as}} the US industrial grade.|$|E

25|$|Housewives updated {{strategies}} {{their mothers}} used {{when they were}} growing up in poor families. Cheap foods were used, such as soups, beans and noodles. They purchased the cheapest cuts of meat—sometimes even horse meat—and recycled the Sunday roast into sandwiches and soups. They sewed and patched clothing, traded with their neighbors for outgrown items, and made do with colder homes. New furniture and appliances were postponed until better days. These strategies show that women's <b>domestic</b> labor—cooking, <b>cleaning,</b> budgeting, shopping, childcare—was essential to the economic maintenance {{of the family and}} offered room for economies. Many women also worked outside the home, or took boarders, did laundry for trade or cash, and did sewing for neighbors in exchange for something they could offer.

40|$|Paid {{domestic}} work endures – with its oldest roots grounded in slavery and servitude, and newer ones in contemporary exploitative capitalism. Feminists {{the world over}} have analysed its occupational relations in depth to show how they reproduce race, class and gender inequalities, with many {{domestic work}}ers experiencing inhumane treatment. But feminists also use domestic help. Should such feminists and paid domestic work be condemned, or can it be reconciled with the overarching feminist goals of equality and liberation that encompass all dimensions of discrimination? My thesis approaches this question through an interrogation of outsourced <b>domestic</b> <b>cleaning</b> in the UK and India. The primary data include 91 semi-structured interviews with White and Indian women working as cleaning service-providers and White and Indian female academics {{with an interest in}} feminism/gender and who were outsourcing <b>domestic</b> <b>cleaning</b> (or had outsourced previously), in the UK and India, respectively. My analytical approach, rooted in my particular varifocal diasporic gaze, draws on Mary Douglas’s anthropology-based cultural theory, which she used to show how comparative analysis enhances sociological understandings of the workings of the West’s own institutions and culture. My cross-cultural analysis thus takes into account similarities and differences between and within the four groups of participating women, as well as silences in the data. My findings reveal that in the modern urban context, outsourced <b>domestic</b> <b>cleaning</b> can be done as "work" (i. e. using mental and manual skills and effort and performed under decent, democratic work conditions) or as "labour" (requiring mainly manual labour, accompanied by exertion of "natural" emotional/affective labour and performed in undemocratic conditions). The issue at stake for feminism(s) is not just some women doing the demeaning work of other women but the classed evolution of the very meanings of work in contemporary societies...|$|E
