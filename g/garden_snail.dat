5|$|Mating {{begins with}} a courting ritual. For example, in land snails of the genus Helix, {{including}} the escargot Helix pomatia, and the common <b>garden</b> <b>snail</b> Helix aspersa (also known as Cornu aspersum and Cantareus aspersus), copulation is preceded by an elaborate tactile courtship.|$|E
5|$|A snail {{does not}} have a dart to fire the very first time it mates, because the first mating is {{necessary}} to trigger the process of dart formation. Once a snail has mated, it fires a dart before some, but not all, subsequent matings. A snail often mates without having a dart to use, because it takes time to create a replacement dart. In the case of the <b>garden</b> <b>snail</b> Cornu aspersum, it takes a week for a new dart to form.|$|E

60|$|Thus, {{even among}} warm-blooded animals like the bears and dormice, {{hibernation}} actually occurs {{to a very}} considerable degree; but {{it is far more}} common and more complete among cold-blooded creatures, whose bodies {{do not need to be}} kept heated to the same degree, and with whom, accordingly, hibernation becomes almost a complete torpor, the breathing and the action of the heart being still further reduced to very nearly zero. Mollusks in particular, like oysters and mussels, lead very monotonous and uneventful lives, only varied as a rule by the welcome change of being cut out of their shells and eaten alive; and their powers of living without food under adverse circumstances are really very remarkable. Freshwater snails and mussels, in cold weather, bury themselves in the mud of ponds or rivers; and land-snails hide themselves in the ground or under moss and leaves. The heart then ceases perceptibly to beat, but respiration continues in a very faint degree. The common <b>garden</b> <b>snail</b> closes the mouth of his shell when he wants to hibernate, with a slimy covering; but he leaves a very small hole in it somewhere, so as to allow a little air to get in, and keep up his breathing to a slight amount. My experience has been, however, that a great many snails go to sleep in this way, and never wake up again. Either they get frozen to death, or else the respiration falls so low that it never picks itself up properly when spring returns. In warm climates, it is during the summer that mollusks and other mud-haunting creatures go to sleep; and when they get well plastered round with clay, they almost approach in tenacity of life the mildest recorded specimens of the toad-in-a-hole.|$|E

This method requires that the trap be checked every day and dead snails removed and the trap refilled with beer as it evaporates over time. Traps should be spaced every three to four meters from one another for coverage of a large garden.|$|R
