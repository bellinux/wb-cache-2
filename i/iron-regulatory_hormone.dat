40|$|The aim of {{the study}} was to {{establish}} an optimized protocol of iron dextran administration to pig neonates, which better meets the iron demand for erythropoiesis. Here, we monitored development of red blood cell indices, plasma iron parameters during a 28 -day period after birth (till the weaning), following intramuscular administration of different concentrations of iron dextran to suckling piglets. To better assess the iron status we developed a novel mass spectrometry assay to quantify pig plasma levels of the <b>iron-regulatory</b> peptide <b>hormone</b> hepcidin- 25. This hormone is predominantly secreted by the liver and acts as a negative regulator of iron absorption and reutilization. The routinely used protocol with high amount of iron resulted in the recovery of piglets from iron deficiency but also in strongly elevated plasma hepcidin- 25 levels. A similar protocol with reduced amounts of iron improved hematological status of piglets to the same level while plasma hepcidin- 25 levels remained low. These data show that plasma hepcidin- 25 levels can guide optimal dosing of iron treatment and pave the way for mixed supplementation of piglets starting with intramuscular injection of iron dextra...|$|R
40|$|BACKGROUND: Hepcidin is an <b>iron-regulatory</b> peptide <b>hormone</b> that {{consists}} of 3 isoforms: bioactive hepcidin- 25, and inactive hepcidin- 22 and hepcidin- 20. Hepcidin is instrumental in the diagnosis and monitoring of iron metabolism disorders, but reliable methods for its quantification in serum are sparse, as is knowledge of their relative analytical strengths and clinical utility. METHODS: We developed a competitive (c) -ELISA and an immunocapture TOF mass-spectrometry (IC-TOF-MS) assay. Exploiting these 2 methods and our previously described weak cation exchange (WCX) -TOF-MS assay, we measured serum hepcidin concentrations in 186 patients with various disorders of iron metabolism and in 23 healthy controls. RESULTS: We found that (a) the relative differences in median hepcidin concentrations in various diseases to be similar, although the absolute concentrations measured with c-ELISA and WCX-TOF-MS differed; (b) hepcidin isoforms contributed to differences in hepcidin concentrations between methods, which were most prominent in patients with chronic kidney disease; and (c) hepcidin concentrations measured by both the c-ELISA and IC-TOF-MS correlated with ferritin concentrations < 60 mug/L, and were suitable for distinguishing between iron deficiency anemia (IDA) and the combination of IDA and anemia of chronic disease. CONCLUSIONS: c-ELISA is the method of choice for the large-scale quantification of serum hepcidin concentrations, because of its low limit of detection, low cost, and high-throughput. Because of its specificity for bioactive hepcidin- 25, WCX-TOF-MS {{can be regarded as}} a valuable special-purpose assay for disorders with variable concentrations of hepcidin isoforms, such as chronic kidney disease...|$|R
40|$|The defensin-like circulatory peptide {{hepcidin}} is the <b>iron-regulatory</b> <b>hormone</b> {{that links}} innate immunity and iron metabolism. In response to inflammatory stimuli, the liver produces hepcidin: this antimicrobial peptide then limits the iron that {{is vital to}} invading pathogens, by decreasing iron release/transfer from enterocytes and macrophages and causing secondary hypoferremia. This may lead, however, to reduced iron availability for erythropoiesis and therefore to anemia (and anemia of chronic disease). When iron is scarce, {{the rate at which}} it is released into the bloodstream must be enhanced: indeed, iron starvation and hypoxia readily abrogate hepcidin expression. Conversely, if excess iron enters the circulation, hepcidin transcription is turned on and iron release from the intestine and macrophages abrogated. Circumstantial evidence indicates that the effect of circulatory iron on hepcidin requires functional HFE and hemojuvelin, two proteins of unknown function that have recently been linked to human hereditary hemochromatosis. In this disease it is likely that inadequate levels of circulating hepcidin lead to the uncontrolled release of iron from the intestine and macrophages, followed by tissue iron overload and organ damage. Given its role as the <b>iron-regulatory</b> <b>hormone,</b> the modulation of hepcidin activity using agonists or antagonists might offer new treatment opportunities in different human iron-dependent disorders...|$|E
40|$|Maintaining {{physiologic}} iron {{concentrations in}} tissues {{is critical for}} metabolism and host defense. Iron absorption in the duodenum, recycling of iron from senescent erythrocytes, and iron mobilization from storage in macrophages and hepatocytes constitute the major iron flows into plasma for distribution to tissues, predominantly for erythropoiesis. All iron transfer to plasma occurs through the iron exporter ferroportin. The concentration of functional membrane-associated ferroportin is controlled by its ligand, the <b>iron-regulatory</b> <b>hormone</b> hepcidin, and fine-tuned by regulatory mechanisms serving iron homeostasis, oxygen utilization, host defense, and erythropoiesis. Fundamental questions about the structure and biology of ferroportin remain to be answered...|$|E

This alludes to the possibility that other factors, besides alcohol, may be involved in the progression of the disease. Over the years, many such factors have indeed been identified, including iron. Despite being crucial for various important biological processes, iron can also be harmful due to its ability to catalyze Fenton chemistry. Alcohol and iron have been shown to interact synergistically to cause liver injury. Iron-mediated cell signaling has been reported to be involved in the patho-genesis of experimental alcoholic liver disease.

40|$|The <b>iron-regulatory</b> <b>hormone</b> {{hepcidin}} {{has been}} proposed as the mediator of anemia of inflammation (AI). We examined the acute and chronic effects of hepcidin in the mouse. Injections of human hepcidin (50 microg/mouse), but not of its diluent, induced hypoferremia within 4 hours. To examine the chronic effects of hepcidin, we implanted either tumor xenografts engineered to overexpress human hepcidin or control tumor xenografts into nonobese diabetic-severe combined immunodeficiency (NOD-SCID) mice. Despite abundant dietary iron, mice with hepcidin-producing tumors developed more severe anemia, lower serum iron, and increased hepatic iron compared with mice with control tumors. Hepcidin contributes to AI by shunting iron away from erythropoiesis and sequestering it in the liver, predominantly in hepatocytes...|$|E
40|$|Aims Heart failure (HF) is {{a common}} manifestation of {{patients}} with primary and secondary causes of iron overload, whereas in patients with established HF iron deficiency impairs outcome. Whether iron stores, either depleted or in overload, amplify the risk for new-onset HF among healthy individuals is unknown. The present study aimed to assess whether markers of iron status or the <b>iron-regulatory</b> <b>hormone</b> hepcidin are associated with new-onset HF or cardiovascular (CV) events in the general population. Methods and results In 6386 subjects from the Prevention of REnal and Vascular ENd-stage Disease (PREVEND) trial, a prospective, community-based, cohort study, markers of iron status and the <b>iron-regulatory</b> <b>hormone</b> hepcidin were measured. Mean age was 53. 1 +/- 12. 0 years, and 50. 7 % of the cohort was female. During a median follow-up of 8. 3 (interquartile range 7. 8 - 8. 9) years, 199 subjects (3. 1 %) were newly diagnosed with HF, 456 (7. 1 %) experienced a CV event, and 356 (5. 6 %) died from all causes. A higher annual HF incidence per ferritin quartile was observed in women (P < 0. 001), but not in men (P for interaction 0. 032). Multivariable analyses demonstrated ferritin levels to remain independently predictive for new-onset HF in women only (P = 0. 024). This association persisted within strata defined by markers of the metabolic syndrome, markers of inflammation, or other markers of iron homeostasis, including hepcidin. No association between ferritin or hepcidin and incident CV events or all-cause mortality was observed in either sex. Conclusions Increased serum ferritin levels independently amplify the risk for new-onset HF in women in the community...|$|E
40|$|As {{the main}} iron storage {{site in the}} body and the main source of the <b>iron-regulatory</b> <b>hormone,</b> hepcidin, the liver plays a pivotal role in iron homeostasis. A {{variable}} degree of hepatic iron accumulation has long been recognized in a number of chronic liver diseases. Both alcoholic and non-alcoholic steatohepatitis display increased iron deposits in the liver, with an hepatocellular, mesenchymal, or mixed pattern, and recent reports have documented a concomitant aberrant hepcidin expression that could be linked to different coincidental pathogenic events (e. g. the etiological agent itself, necroinflammation, metabolic derangements, genetic predisposition). The present study reviews the pathogenic mechanisms of iron accumulation in steatohepatitis during alcoholic and non-alcoholic liver disease and the role of excess iron in chronic disease progression...|$|E
40|$|Iron, an {{essential}} nutrient, {{is required for}} many diverse biological processes. The absence of a defined pathway to excrete excess iron makes it essential for the body to regulate the amount of iron absorbed; a deficiency could lead to iron deficiency and an excess to iron overload and associated disorders such as anaemia and haemochromatosis respectively. This regulation is mediated by the <b>iron-regulatory</b> <b>hormone</b> hepcidin. Hepcidin binds to the only known iron export protein, ferroportin (FPN), inducing its internalization and degradation, thus limiting the amount of iron released into the blood. The major factors that are implicated in hepcidin regulation include iron stores, hypoxia, inflammation and erythropoiesis. The present review summarizes our present knowledge about the molecular mechanisms and signalling pathways contributing to hepcidin regulation by these factors...|$|E
40|$|Hepcidin, the <b>iron-regulatory</b> <b>hormone</b> {{and acute}} phase reactant, is {{proposed}} {{to contribute to}} the pathogenesis of atherosclerosis by promoting iron accumulation in plaque macrophages, leading to increased oxidative stress and inflammation in the plaque (the “iron hypothesis”). Hepcidin and iron may thus represent modifiable risk factors in atherosclerosis. We measured hepcidin expression in Apoe−/− mice with varying diets and ages. To assess the role of macrophage iron in atherosclerosis, we generated Apoe−/− mice with macrophage-specific iron accumulation by introducing the ferroportin ffe mutation. Macrophage iron loading was also enhanced by intravenous iron injection. Contrary to the iron hypothesis, we found that hepatic hepcidin expression was not increased at any stage of the atherosclerosis progression in Apoe−/− or Apoe/ffe mice and that the atherosclerotic plaque size was not increased in mice with elevated macrophage iron. Our results strongly argue against any significant role of macrophage iron in atherosclerosis progression in mice...|$|E
40|$|SummaryHereditary hemochromatosis, an iron {{overload}} disease {{caused by a}} deficiency in the <b>iron-regulatory</b> <b>hormone</b> hepcidin, is associated with lethal infections by siderophilic bacteria. To elucidate the mechanisms of this susceptibility, we infected wild-type and hepcidin-deficient mice with the siderophilic bacterium Vibrio vulnificus and found that hepcidin deficiency results in increased bacteremia and decreased survival of infected mice, which can be partially ameliorated by dietary iron depletion. Additionally, timely administration of hepcidin agonists to hepcidin-deficient mice induces hypoferremia that decreases bacterial loads and rescues these mice from death, regardless of initial iron levels. Studies of Vibrio vulnificus growth ex vivo show that high iron sera from hepcidin-deficient mice support extraordinarily rapid bacterial growth {{and that this is}} inhibited in hypoferremic sera. Our findings demonstrate that hepcidin-mediated hypoferremia is a host defense mechanism against siderophilic pathogens and suggest that hepcidin agonists may improve infection outcomes in patients with hereditary hemochromatosis or thalassemia...|$|E
40|$|Under {{evolutionary}} pressure {{to counter the}} toxicity of iron and to maintain adequate iron supply for hemoglobin synthesis and essential metabolic functions, humans and other vertebrates have effective mechanisms to conserve iron and to regulate its concentration, storage, and distribution in tissues. The <b>iron-regulatory</b> <b>hormone</b> hepcidin, first described 10 years ago, and its receptor and iron channel ferroportin control the dietary absorption, storage, and tissue distribution of iron. Hepcidin causes ferroportin internalization and degradation, thereby decreasing iron transfer into blood plasma from the duodenum, from macrophages involved in recycling senescent erythrocytes, and from iron-storing hepatocytes. Hepcidin is feedback regulated by iron concentrations in plasma and the liver and by erythropoietic demand for iron. Genetic malfunctions affecting the hepcidin-ferroportin axis are a main cause of iron overload disorders but can also cause iron-restricted anemias. Modulation of hepcidin and ferroportin expression during infection and inflammation couples iron metabolism to host defense and decreases iron availability to invading pathogens. This response also restricts the iron supply to erythropoietic precursors and may cause or contribute to the anemia associated with infections and inflammatory disorders...|$|E
40|$|International audienceThe {{biguanide}} metformin is {{used for}} its antidiabetic effect for many years but how metformin acts remains poorly understood and controversial. AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK), a protein kinase that {{plays a key role}} in maintaining energy homeostasis, is assumed to be one of the prime targets of metformin. However, since our demonstration that AMPK is not required for the beneficial effects of metformin on the control of glycemia, the list of AMPK-independent actions of metformin is rapidly increasing. Given the conflicting results on the effects of metformin we sought, using our genetic mouse models deficient in the catalytic subunits of AMPK, to determine whether this kinase is involved in the effects of metformin on the expression of the <b>iron-regulatory</b> <b>hormone</b> hepcidin, as recently proposed. Here we demonstrate, using different approaches, either isolated hepatocytes that lack AMPK, or direct AMPK activators, that, AMPK activation is not necessary for metformin to inhibit BMP 6 -induced hepcidin gene expression. These results may shed new lights on the increasingly recognized AMPK-independent metformin's molecular action, an important area of current research...|$|E
40|$|Hemojuvelin (Hjv) is a bone {{morphogenetic}} protein (BMP) co-receptor {{involved in}} the control of systemic iron homeostasis. Functional inactivation of Hjv leads to severe iron overload in humans and mice due to marked suppression of the <b>iron-regulatory</b> <b>hormone</b> hepcidin. To investigate the role of Hjv in body iron sensing, Hjv 2 / 2 mice and isogenic wild type controls were placed on a moderately low, a standard or a high iron diet for four weeks. Hjv 2 / 2 mice developed systemic iron overload under all regimens. Transferrin (Tf) was highly saturated regardless of the dietary iron content, while liver iron deposition was proportional to it. Hepcidin mRNA expression responded to fluctuations in dietary iron intake, {{despite the absence of}} Hjv. Nevertheless, iron-dependent upregulation of hepcidin was more than an order of magnitude lower compared to that seen in wild type controls. Likewise, iron signaling via the BMP/Smad pathway was preserved but substantially attenuated. These findings suggest that Hjv is not required for sensing of body iron levels and merely functions as an enhancer for iron signaling to hepcidin...|$|E
40|$|Liver cells {{communicate}} with the extracellular environment to take up nutrients via endocytosis. Iron uptake is essential for metabolic activities and cell homeostasis. Here, we investigated {{the role of the}} endocytic system for maintaining iron homeostasis. We specifically depleted the small GTPase Rab 5 in the mouse liver, causing a transient loss of the entire endo-lysosomal system. Strikingly, endosome depletion led to a fast reduction of hepatic iron levels, which was preceded by an increased abundance of the iron exporter ferroportin. Compensatory changes in livers of Rab 5 -depleted mice include increased expression of transferrin receptor 1 as well as reduced expression of the <b>iron-regulatory</b> <b>hormone</b> hepcidin. Serum iron indices (serum iron, free iron binding capacity and total iron binding capacity) in Rab 5 -KD mice were increased, consistent with an elevated splenic and hepatic iron export. Our data emphasize the critical importance of the endosomal compartments in hepatocytes to maintain hepatic and systemic iron homeostasis in vivo. The short time period (between day four and five) upon which these changes occur underscore the fast dynamics of the liver iron pool...|$|E
40|$|Iron supplementation {{strategies}} {{in the developing world}} remain controversial because of fears of exacerbating prevalent infectious diseases. Understanding the conditions in which iron will be absorbed and incorporated into erythrocytes is therefore important. We studied Gambian children with either postmalarial or nonmalarial anemia, who were given oral iron supplements daily for 30 days. Supplements administered on days 1 and 15 contained the stable iron isotopes (57) Fe and (58) Fe, respectively, and erythrocyte incorporation was measured in blood samples drawn 14 days later. We investigated how the <b>iron-regulatory</b> <b>hormone</b> hepcidin and other inflammatory/iron-related indices, all measured on the day of isotope administration, correlated with erythrocyte iron incorporation. In univariate analyses, hepcidin, ferritin, C-reactive protein, and soluble transferrin receptor (sTfR) strongly predicted incorporation of (57) Fe given on day 1, while hepcidin, ferritin, and sTfR/log ferritin correlated with (58) Fe incorporation. In a final multivariate model, the most consistent predictor of erythrocyte isotope incorporation was hepcidin. We conclude that under conditions of competing signals (anemia, iron deficiency, and infection), hepcidin powerfully controls use of dietary iron. We suggest that low-cost point-of-care hepcidin assays would aid iron supplementation programs in the developing world...|$|E
40|$|BMP-SMAD {{signalling}} plays {{a crucial}} role in numerous biological processes including embryonic development and iron homeostasis. Dysregulation of the <b>iron-regulatory</b> <b>hormone</b> hepcidin is associated with many clinical iron-related disorders. We hypothesised that molecules which mediate BMP-SMAD signalling play important roles in the regulation of iron homeostasis and variants in these proteins may be potential genetic modifiers of iron-related diseases. We examined the role of endofin, a SMAD anchor, and show that knockdown of endofin in liver cells inhibits basal and BMP-induced hepcidin expression along with other BMP-regulated genes, ID 1 and SMAD 7. We show for the first time, the in situ interaction of endofin with SMAD proteins and significantly reduced SMAD phosphorylation with endofin knockdown, suggesting that endofin modulates hepcidin through BMP-SMAD signalling. Characterisation of naturally occurring SNPs show that mutations in the conserved FYVE domain result in mislocalisation of endofin, potentially affecting downstream signalling and modulating hepcidin expression. In conclusion, we have identified a hitherto unrecognised link, endofin, between the BMP-SMAD signalling pathway, and the regulation of hepcidin expression and iron homeostasis. This study further defines the molecular network involved in iron regulation and provides potential targets for the treatment of iron-related disorders...|$|E
40|$|Both iron {{deficiency}} (ID) and malaria are common among African children. Studies {{show that the}} <b>iron-regulatory</b> <b>hormone</b> hepcidin is induced by malaria, but few studies have investigated this relationship longitudinally. We measured hepcidin concentrations, markers of iron status, and antibodies to malaria antigens during two cross-sectional surveys within a cohort of 324 Kenyan children ≤ 8  years old who were under intensive surveillance for malaria and other febrile illnesses. Hepcidin concentrations were {{the highest in the}} youngest, and female infants, declined rapidly in infancy and more gradually thereafter. Asymptomatic malaria and malaria antibody titres were positively associated with hepcidin concentrations. Recent episodes of febrile malaria were associated with high hepcidin concentrations that fell over time. Hepcidin concentrations were not associated with the subsequent risk of either malaria or other febrile illnesses. Given that iron absorption is impaired by hepcidin, our data suggest that asymptomatic and febrile malaria contribute to the high burden of ID seen in African children. Further, the effectiveness of iron supplementation may be sub-optimal in the presence of asymptomatic malaria. Thus, strategies to prevent and eliminate malaria may have the added benefit of addressing an important cause of ID for African children...|$|E
40|$|Iron-refractory, iron-deficiency anemia (IRIDA) is a {{familial}} disorder {{characterized by}} {{iron deficiency anemia}} unresponsive to oral iron treatment but partially responsive to intravenous iron therapy. Previously, we showed that IRIDA patients harbor loss-of-function mutations in TMPRSS 6, a type II transmembrane serine protease primarily expressed by the liver. Both humans and mice with TMPRSS 6 mutations show inappropriately elevated levels of the <b>iron-regulatory</b> <b>hormone</b> hepcidin, suggesting that TMPRSS 6 acts to negatively regulate hepcidin expression. Here we investigate the relationship between Tmprss 6 and the bone morphogenetic protein (BMP) –Smad signaling pathway, a key pathway promoting hepcidin transcription in hepatocytes. We show that livers from mice deficient for Tmprss 6 have decreased iron stores and decreased Bmp 6 mRNA, but markedly increased mRNA for Id 1, a target gene of Bmp 6 signaling. In contrast, mice deficient for both Tmprss 6 and hemojuvelin (Hjv), a BMP coreceptor that augments hepcidin expression in hepatocytes, showed markedly decreased hepatic levels of hepcidin and Id 1 mRNA, markedly increased hepatic Bmp 6 mRNA levels, and systemic iron overload similar to mice deficient for Hjv alone. These findings suggest that down-regulation of Bmp/Smad signaling by Tmprss 6 is required for regulation of hepcidin expression and maintenance of systemic iron homeostasis...|$|E
40|$|Abstract Hereditary {{hemochromatosis}} {{is commonly}} associated with liver fibrosis. Likewise, hepatic iron overload secondary to chronic liver diseases aggravates liver injury. To uncover underlying molecular mechanisms, hemochromatotic hemojuvelin knockout (Hjv-/-) mice and wild type (wt) controls were intoxicated with CCl(4). Hjv-/- mice developed earlier (by 2 - 4 weeks) and more acute liver damage, reflected in dramatic levels of serum transaminases and ferritin {{and the development of}} severe coagulative necrosis and fibrosis. These responses were associated with an oxidative burst and early upregulation of mRNAs encoding α 1 -(I) -collagen, the profibrogenic cytokines TGF-β 1, endothelin- 1 and PDGF and, notably, the <b>iron-regulatory</b> <b>hormone</b> hepcidin. Hence, CCl 4 -induced liver fibrogenesis was exacerbated and progressed precociously in Hjv-/- animals. Even though livers of naïve Hjv-/- mice were devoid of apparent pathology, they exhibited oxidative stress and immunoreactivity towards α-SMA antibodies, a marker of hepatic stellate cells activation. Furthermore, they expressed significantly higher (2 - 3 fold vs. wt, p< 0. 05) levels of α 1 -(I) -collagen, TGF-β 1, endothelin- 1 and PDGF mRNAs, indicative of early fibrogenesis.

40|$|Hepcidin {{is a new}} {{peptide hormone}} {{secreted}} by the liver and widely distributed among animals, from fish to human. It acts as a signal molecule in iron metabolism and {{plays an important role}} in iron overload diseases. Recently, it has been reported that hepcidin is able to regulate the iron efflux by binding to the ferroportin protein and inducing its internalization. This activity is specific only for bioactive hepcidin- 25 and not for the truncated hepcidin- 20, lacking the five amino terminal residues. We have characterized the N-terminal region of the hepcidin- 25 as a metal-binding site by several spectroscopic techniques and chemical studies. This region, specific for the coordination of Cu(II) and Ni(II), is known as 'ATCUN motif'. Moreover, we have demonstrated that the metal binding inhibits the aggregation propensity of both whole hepcidin- 25 and its N-terminal fragments, probably inducing a conformational change leading to the stabilization of the N-terminal region. The identification of a metal-binding site at the N-terminus of hepcidin- 25, which is necessary for its biological activity as <b>iron-regulatory</b> <b>hormone,</b> will help us to cast light both on the role of the divalent metals and of the hepcidin- 25 in the iron homeostatis, and to better understand structure-function relationships of this hormone-peptide...|$|E
40|$|Hepcidin is the {{principal}} <b>iron-regulatory</b> <b>hormone</b> and a pathogenic factor in anemia of inflammation. Patients with multiple myeloma (MM) frequently present with anemia. We showed that MM patients had increased serum hepcidin, which inversely correlated with hemoglobin, suggesting that hepcidin contributes to MM-related anemia. Searching for hepcidin-inducing cytokines in MM, we quantified the stimulation of hepcidin promoter-luciferase activity in HuH 7 cells by MM sera. MM sera activated the hepcidin promoter significantly more than did normal sera. We then examined the role of bone morphogenetic proteins (BMPs) and interleukin- 6 (IL- 6), the major transcriptional regulators of hepcidin. Mutations in both BMP-responsive elements abrogated the activation dramatically, while mutations in the IL- 6 –responsive signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 -binding site (STAT 3 -BS) had only a minor effect. Cotreatment with anti–BMP- 2 / 4 or noggin-Fc blocked the promoter induction with all MM sera, anti–IL- 6 blocked it with a minority of sera, whereas anti–BMP- 4, - 6, or - 9 antibodies had no effect. BMP- 2 –immunodepleted MM sera had decreased promoter stimulatory capacity, and BMP- 2 concentrations in MM sera {{were significantly higher than}} in normal sera.

40|$|Hepcidin is the {{principal}} <b>iron-regulatory</b> <b>hormone.</b> It acts by binding to the iron exporter ferroportin, inducing its internalization and degradation, thereby blocking cellular iron efflux. The bioactive 25 amino acid (aa) peptide has a hairpin structure stabilized by 4 disulfide bonds. We synthesized a series of hepcidin derivatives and determined their bioactivity in a cell line expressing ferroportin-GFP fusion protein, by measuring the degradation of ferroportin-GFP and the accumulation of ferritin after peptide treatment. Bioactivity was also assayed in mice by the induction of hypoferremia. Serial deletion of N-terminal amino acids caused progressive decrease in activity which was completely lost when 5 N-terminal aa's were deleted. Synthetic 3 -aa and 6 -aa N-terminal peptides alone, however, did not internalize ferroportin and did not interfere with ferroportin internalization by native hepcidin. Deletion of 2 C-terminal aa's did not affect peptide activity. Removal of individual disulfide bonds by pairwise substitution of cysteines with alanines also did not affect peptide activity in vitro. However, these peptides were less active in vivo, likely because of their decreased stability in circulation. G 71 D and K 83 R, substitutions previously described in humans, did not affect hepcidin activity. Apart from the essential nature of the N-terminus, hepcidin structure appears permissive for mutations...|$|E

40|$|Iron is an {{essential}} trace element whose absorption is usually tightly regulated in the duodenum. HFE-related hereditary hemochromatosis (HH) is characterized by abnormally low expression of the <b>iron-regulatory</b> <b>hormone,</b> hepcidin, which results in increased iron absorption.

The aim {{of this study was to}} explore and compare the genome-wide transcriptome response to Hfe deficiency and dietary iron overload in murine liver and duodenum. Illumina arrays containing over 47, 000 probes were used to study global transcriptional changes. Quantitative RT-PCR (Q-RT-PCR) was used to validate the microarray results. In the liver, the expression of 151 genes was altered in Hfe(-/-) mice while dietary iron overload changed the expression of 218 genes. There were 173 and 108 differentially expressed genes in the duodenum of Hfe(-/-) mice and mice with dietary iron overload, respectively. There was 93. 5 % concordance between the results obtained by microarray analysis and Q-RT-PCR. Overexpression of genes for acute phase reactants in the liver and a strong induction of digestive enzyme genes in the duodenum were characteristic of the Hfe-deficient genotype.

40|$|HIF {{transcription}} factors (HIF- 1 and HIF- 2) {{are central}} mediators of cellular adaptation to hypoxia. Because the resting partial pressure of oxygen {{is low in}} the intestinal lumen, epithelial cells {{are believed to be}} mildly hypoxic. Having recently established a link between HIF and the <b>iron-regulatory</b> <b>hormone</b> hepcidin, we hypothesized that HIFs, stabilized in the hypoxic intestinal epithelium, may also play critical roles in regulating intestinal iron absorption. To explore this idea, we first established that the mouse duodenum, the site of iron absorption in the intestine, is hypoxic and generated conditional knockout mice that lacked either Hif 1 a or Hif 2 a specifically in the intestinal epithelium. Using these mice, we found that HIF- 1 α was not necessary for iron absorption, whereas HIF- 2 α {{played a crucial role in}} maintaining iron balance in the organism by directly regulating the transcription of the gene encoding divalent metal transporter 1 (DMT 1), the principal intestinal iron transporter. Specific deletion of Hif 2 a led to a decrease in serum and liver iron levels and a marked decrease in liver hepcidin expression, indicating the involvement of an induced systemic response to counteract the iron deficiency.

The 35 participants, {{residents of the}} United States, Canada, and Australia, reported no or light alcohol consumption. Sequencing data included 82, 068 single-nucleotide variants, and 10, 337 genes were tested for a difference between cases and controls. A variant in the GNPAT gene showed the most significant association with severe iron overload (P = 3 x 10 - 6; P = 0. 033 by the likelihood ratio test after correction for multiple comparisons). Sixteen of twenty-two participants with severe iron overload had glyceronephosphate O-acyltransferase (GNPAT) polymorphism p. D 519 G (rs 11558492; 15 heterozygotes, one homozygote). No control participant had this polymorphism. To examine functional consequences of GNPAT deficiency, we performed small interfering RNA based knockdown of GNPAT in the human liver-derived cell line, HepG 2 /C 3 A. This knockdown resulted in a 17 -fold decrease in expression of the messenger RNA encoding the <b>iron-regulatory</b> <b>hormone,</b> hepcidin. Conclusion: GNPAT p. D 519 G {{is associated with a}} high-iron phenotype in HFE C 282 Y homozygotes and may participate in hepcidin regulation. (H epatology 2015; 62 : 429 - 43...|$|E
40|$|We {{recently}} reported the hemochromatosis-like phenotype observed in our Usf 2 knockout mice. In these mice, as in murine models of hemochromatosis and patients with hereditary hemochromatosis, iron accumulates in parenchymal cells (in particular, liver and pancreas), whereas the reticuloendothelial system is spared from this iron loading. We {{suggested that this}} phenotypic trait {{could be attributed to}} the absence, in the Usf 2 knockout mice, of a secreted liver-specific peptide, hepcidin. We conjectured that the reverse situation, namely overexpression of hepcidin, might result in phenotypic traits of iron deficiency. This question was addressed by generating transgenic mice expressing hepcidin {{under the control of the}} liver-specific transthyretin promoter. We found that the majority of the transgenic mice were born with a pale skin and died within a few hours after birth. These transgenic animals had decreased body iron levels and presented severe microcytic hypochromic anemia. So far, three mosaic transgenic animals have survived. They were unequivocally identified by physical features, including reduced body size, pallor, hairless and crumpled skin. These pleiotropic effects were found to be associated with erythrocyte abnormalities, with marked anisocytosis, poikylocytosis and hypochromia, which are features characteristic of iron-deficiency anemia. These results strongly support the proposed role of hepcidin as a putative <b>iron-regulatory</b> <b>hormone.</b> The animal models devoid of hepcidin (the Usf 2 knockout mice) or overexpressing the peptide (the transgenic mice presented in this paper) represent valuable tools for investigating iron homeostasis in vivo and for deciphering the molecular mechanisms of hepcidin action...|$|E
40|$|Background: Distortion of iron {{homeostasis}} {{may contribute}} to the pathogenesis of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection and tuberculosis (TB). We studied the association of the central <b>iron-regulatory</b> <b>hormone</b> hepcidin with the severity of HIV and the association between hepcidin and other markers of iron homeostasis with development of TB. Methods: Three groups of patients were selected from a prospective cohort of HIV-infected subjects in Bandung, Indonesia. The first group consisted of HIV-infected patients who started TB treatment more than 30 days after cohort enrollment (cases). The second group consisted of HIV-infected patients who were matched for age, gender and CD 4 cell count to the cases group (matched controls). The third group consisted of HIV-infected patients with CD 4 cell counts above 200 cells/ mm 3 (unmatched controls). Iron parameters including hepcidin were compared using samples collected at cohort enrollment, and compared with recently published reference values for serum hepcidin. Results: A total of 127 HIV-infected patients were included, 42 cases together with 42 matched controls and 43 unmatched controls. Patients with advanced HIV infection had elevated serum hepcidin and ferritin levels. Hepcidin levels correlated inversely with CD 4 cells and hemoglobin. Cases had significantly higher hepcidin and ferritin concentrations at cohort enrollment compared to matched controls, but these differences were fully accounted for by the cases who started TB treatment between day 31 and 60 after enrollment. Hepcidin levels were not different in those with or without hepatitis...|$|E
40|$|Abstract Background Hereditary {{hemochromatosis}} (HH) encompasses genetic disorders of iron overload {{characterized by}} deficient expression or {{function of the}} <b>iron-regulatory</b> <b>hormone</b> hepcidin. Mutations in 5 genes {{have been linked to}} this disease: HFE, TFR 2 (encoding transferrin receptor 2), HAMP (encoding hepcidin), SLC 40 A 1 (encoding ferroportin) and HJV (encoding hemojuvelin). Hepcidin inhibits iron export from cells into plasma. Hemojuvelin, an upstream regulator of hepcidin expression, is expressed in mice mainly in the heart and skeletal muscle. It has been suggested that soluble hemojuvelin shed by the muscle might reach the liver to influence hepcidin expression. Heart muscle is one of the target tissues affected by iron overload, with resultant cardiomyopathy in some HH patients. Therefore, we investigated the effect of iron overload on gene expression in skeletal muscle and heart using Illumina™ arrays containing over 47, 000 probes. The most apparent changes in gene expression were confirmed using real-time RT-PCR. Results Genes with up-regulated expression after iron overload in both skeletal and heart muscle included angiopoietin-like 4, pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase 4 and calgranulin A and B. The expression of transferrin receptor, heat shock protein 1 B and DnaJ homolog B 1 were down-regulated by iron in both muscle types. Two potential hepcidin regulatory genes, hemojuvelin and neogenin, showed no clear change in expression after iron overload. Conclusion Microarray analysis revealed iron-induced changes in the expression of several genes involved in the regulation of glucose and lipid metabolism, transcription and cellular stress responses. These may represent novel connections between iron overload and pathological manifestations of HH such as cardiomyopathy and diabetes. </p...|$|E
40|$|Iron {{metabolism}} and erythropoiesis are inherently interlinked physiological processes. Regulation of iron metabolism is {{mediated by the}} <b>iron-regulatory</b> <b>hormone</b> hepcidin. Hepcidin limits the amount of iron released into the blood by binding to and causing the internalization of the iron exporter, ferroportin. A number of molecules and physiological stimuli, including erythropoiesis, are known to regulate hepcidin. An increase in erythropoietic demand decreases hepcidin, resulting in increased bioavailable iron in the blood. Transferrin receptor 2 (TFR 2) {{is involved in the}} systemic regulation of iron metabolism. Patients and mice with mutations in TFR 2 develop hemochromatosis due to inappropriate hepcidin levels relative to body iron. Recent studies from our laboratory and others have suggested an additional role for TFR 2 in response to iron-restricted erythropoiesis. These studies used mouse models with perturbed systemic iron metabolism: anemic mice lacking matriptase- 2 and Tfr 2, or bone marrow transplants from iron-loaded Tfr 2 null mice. We developed a novel transgenic mouse model which lacks Tfr 2 in the hematopoietic compartment, enabling the delineation of the role of Tfr 2 in erythroid development without interfering with its role in systemic iron metabolism. We show that in the absence of hematopoietic Tfr 2 immature polychromatic erythroblasts accumulate with a concordant reduction in the percentage of mature erythroid cells in the spleen and bone marrow of anemic mice. These results demonstrate that erythroid Tfr 2 is essential for an appropriate erythropoietic response in iron-deficient anemia. These findings may be of relevance in clinical situations in which an immediate and efficient erythropoietic response is required...|$|E
40|$|Inactivating {{mutations}} in hemojuvelin/repulsive guidance molecule c (HJV/RGMc) cause juvenile hemochromatosis (JH), a rapidly progressive iron overload disorder in which expression of hepcidin, a key liver-derived <b>iron-regulatory</b> <b>hormone,</b> is severely diminished. Several growth {{factors in the}} bone morphogenetic protein (BMP) family, including BMP 2 and BMP 6, can stimulate production of hepcidin, a biological effect that may be modified by RGMc. Here we demonstrate that soluble RGMc proteins are potent BMP inhibitors. We find that 50 - and 40 -kDa RGMc isoforms, when added to cells as highly purified IgG Fc fusion proteins, are able to block the acute effects of both BMP 2 and BMP 6 at the levels of Smad induction and gene activation, and thus represent a potentially unique class of broad-spectrum BMP antagonists. Whole transcript microarray analysis revealed that BMP 2 and BMP 6 each stimulated expression of a nearly identical cohort of ∼ 40 mRNAs in Hep 3 B cells and demonstrated that 40 -kDa RGMc was an effective inhibitor of both growth factors, although its potency was {{less than that of}} the known BMP 2 -selective antagonist, Noggin. We additionally show that JH-linked RGMc mutant proteins that retain the ability to bind BMPs are also able to function as BMP inhibitors, and like the wild type soluble RGMc species, can block BMP-activated hepcidin gene expression. The latter results raise the question of whether disease severity in JH will vary depending on the ability of a given mutant RGMc protein to interact with BMPs...|$|E
