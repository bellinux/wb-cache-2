500|$|Gallagher {{reportedly}} {{blasted the}} organisers of the 2008 Glastonbury Festival for scheduling US hip-hop artist Jay-Z as a headliner for the traditionally guitar-driven festival: [...] "If it ain't broke don't fix it. <b>If</b> <b>you</b> <b>start</b> {{to break it}} then people aren't going to go. I'm sorry, but Jay-Z? No chance. Glastonbury {{has a tradition of}} guitar music and even when they throw the odd curve ball in on a Sunday night you go 'Kylie Minogue?' I don't know about it. But I'm not having hip-hop at Glastonbury. It's wrong." ...|$|E
500|$|According to author Frederick Nolan, who {{chronicled the}} works of Rodgers and Hammerstein, Pipe Dream [...] "cost them a fortune". Rodgers later stated {{it was the only}} one of their works he truly disliked; that <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>start</b> with a bad idea, {{everything}} is marred by that: [...] "We shouldn't have been dealing with prostitutes and tramps." [...] Rodgers also blamed the casting of Traubel, whom he considered wrong for the part. Hammerstein's grandson, Oscar A. Hammerstein, in his book about his family, agreed with Rodgers's view of Traubel—"too much Brunhilde, not enough Miss Kitty [...] ". The elder Hammerstein's biographer, Hugh Fordin, tied the failure of the play to the lyricist's prudery: ...|$|E
500|$|One of the {{challenges}} the writers faced was scaling down their ideas to make them feasible for production. [...] Cuse said that he let such ideas flourish because of his relative inexperience with writing for television series. An example given by the writers was Boam's idea for a full-sized [...] "pirate ship on wheels". The writers quickly realized they needed to scale the idea down to something the production designers could create. They settled on putting a full pirate crew on a stagecoach with cannons. Kern said {{it was better to}} [...] "shoot past the mark, and come back to it, rather than start below it". He elaborated on this, saying, [...] "if you envision the 40-foot galleon and go back from that, you'll always end up with more than <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>start</b> out with a pirate on a horse." ...|$|E

500|$|When the {{instrumentation}} was completed, Draiman {{began to}} write melody lines for each song. Draiman commented, [...] "I'm {{a big believer in}} the vibe of the music and the feel of it, how the song makes you feel musically should dictate {{what it is to be}} about and so <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>start</b> with something that has meaning, but the music doesn't support the meaning, then what good is it?" [...] The first song completed musically was [...] "The Night", and Draiman completed the melody line in three days. This caused Draiman to tentatively call the record The Night. As Draiman recalled, [...] "The instrumentation was so cool and so dark and textural that I right away kind of jumped into it." [...] When the first batch of songs were completed, the band sent them out to their record label, Reprise Records, and waited for their approval to continue writing more songs. After they received approval, they wrote the rest of the songs featured on the album.|$|E
2500|$|Meath's captain Nigel Crawford {{gave his}} {{opinion on the}} incident: [...] "I'm sure most players have been {{involved}} in controversial situations like that where you get calls for replays and things like that happening, but I just don't think it's possible or I just don't think it can happen. <b>If</b> <b>you</b> <b>start</b> that, where do you end up? Do we go back and say the ball wasn’t on the ground when we touched it and they got a free or whatever? It's just very unfortunate that it happens in a high-profile game right {{at the end of a}} game to a team that hasn't won in a long time. It's just a very unfortunate situation".|$|E
2500|$|Ishida and Abe {{returned}} to Ogu, where they remained until his death. During their love-making this time, Abe put the knife {{to the base}} of Ishida's penis, and said she would make sure he would never play around with another woman. Ishida laughed at this. Two nights into this bout of sex, Abe began choking Ishida, and he told her to continue, saying that this increased his pleasure. She had him do it to her as well. On the evening of May 16, 1936, Abe used her obi sash to cut off Ishida's breathing during orgasm, and they both enjoyed it. They repeated this for two more hours. Once Abe stopped the strangulation, Ishida's face became distorted, and would not return to its normal appearance. Ishida took 30 tablets of a sedative called Calmotin to try to soothe his pain. According to Abe, as Ishida started to doze, he told her, [...] "You'll put the cord around my neck and squeeze it again while I'm sleeping, won't you... <b>If</b> <b>you</b> <b>start</b> to strangle me, don't stop, because it is so painful afterward." [...] Abe commented that she wondered if he had wanted her to kill him, but on reflection decided he must have been joking.|$|E

2500|$|Andreas Hackel, art {{director}} at Candygun Games described {{the inspiration for}} the game's visuals. [...] "I was inspired by games like Team Fortress 2 and classic B-movies of the 1950's", stated Hackel. When asked about the reason for choosing to set it in the 1950s, Hackel replied, [...] "not many games are set in this period and there are a whole slew of very typical and interesting design elements from this time period. Elements like the cars, milk bars, chrome, juke boxes, fashion and hairstyles are all instantly recognisable as coming from the 50's." [...] Hackel commented that Candygun wanted the characters to be [...] "people from the street", and not superheroes. Roger Joswig explained their choice of using Unreal Engine 3 instead of a proprietary technology. [...] "If you're looking to release your game on , Xbox 360 and PC as we were, developing your own engine is a lot more expensive, takes a long time <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>start</b> from scratch and needs a lot of QA support – so it wasn't really a feasible option for us as a small, start-up developer". He also noted that the engine is built to run on the PlayStation 3, Xbox 360 and Microsoft Windows natively and that the team was familiar with the Unreal Engine tools. The in-game music was provided by the band Vampire State Building. The narrator's voice and in-game sound effects were outsourced to Periscope Studios.|$|E
