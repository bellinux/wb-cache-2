Driscoll also believes that this position (or slight variations thereof) was held by men like Charles Spurgeon, John Bunyan, Martin Luther, and Richard Baxter.|$|E
25|$|When {{it is not}} {{possible}} for a law to be authentically interpreted, recourse must be had to what is called magisterial, or doctrinal, interpretation, for which rules of law have been formulated.

In all interpretations, however, the meaning of the words is to be preferred which favours equity rather than strict justice. The provisions of a previous statute are not presumed to be changed beyond the express meaning of the words of a new law. No words of a law are ever presumed to be superfluous. In interpreting a law the words must be considered in their context. When the words of a law are doubtful the presumption is in favour of the subjects, not of the lawgiver.|$|E

As in the case for radio waves and the X-rays involved in Compton scattering, physicists have noted that electromagnetic radiation tends to behave more like a classical wave at lower frequencies, but more like a classical particle at higher frequencies, but never completely loses all qualities of one or the other. Visible light, which occupies a middle ground in frequency, can easily be shown in experiments to be describable using either a wave or particle model, or sometimes both.|$|E

[...] First among these he listed the peripatetic-thomist observation mentioned above, but he further observed that this link between sensory perception and intellectual conception is a two-way street. [...] That is, it can be taken to say that whatever we find in the intellect is also incipiently in the senses. [...] Hence, if theories are theory-laden then so are the senses, and perception itself {{can be seen as a}} species of abductive inference, its difference being that it is beyond control and hence beyond critique – in a word, incorrigible. [...] This in no way conflicts with the fallibility and revisability of scientific concepts, since it is only the immediate percept in its unique individuality or [...] "thisness" [...] – what the Scholastics called its haecceity – that stands beyond control and correction. [...] Scientific concepts, on the other hand, are general in nature, and transient sensations do <b>in</b> <b>another</b> <b>sense</b> find correction within them.

Then in the March 14 Florida primary, he placed a weak fifth place, behind George Wallace of Alabama, Muskie, Hubert Humphrey of Minnesota, and Scoop Jackson of Washington (though he did edge out McGovern). Among his difficulties was New York City's worsening problems, which Lindsay was accused of neglecting; a band of protesters from Forest Hills, Queens, who were opposed to his support for a low income housing project in their neighborhood, followed Lindsay around his aborted campaign itinerary to jeer and heckle him. His poor showing in Florida effectively doomed his candidacy.

2500|$|Har – Mary S. Hall {{believes}} that Har's name {{was derived from}} Jacob Bryant's A New System or Analysis of Antient Mythology (1776), where Bryant conflates the Amazonian deities Harmon and Ares with the Egyptian deity Harmonia, wife of Cadmus. Blake had engraved plates for the book in the early 1780s, so he would have certainly have been familiar with its content. As a character, S. Foster Damon {{believes that}} Har represents both the [...] "decadent poetry of Blake's day" [...] and the traditional spirit of Christianity. Northrop Frye reaches a similar conclusion, but also sees divergence in the character, arguing that although Har and Heva are based on Adam and Eve, [...] "Har is distinguished from Adam. Adam is ordinary man in his mixed twofold nature of imagination and Selfhood. Har is the human Selfhood which, though men {{spend most of their}} time trying to express it, never achieves reality and is identified only as death. Har, unlike Adam, never outgrows his garden but remains there shut up from the world in a permanent state of near-existence." [...] Bloom agrees with this interpretation, arguing that [...] "Har is natural man, the isolated selfhood." [...] Bloom also believes that Har is comparable to Struldbruggs from Jonathan Swift's Gulliver's Travels (1726) and Tithonus from Alfred, Lord Tennyson's poem of the same name (1859). <b>In</b> <b>another</b> <b>sense,</b> Frye suggests that [...] "Har represents the unborn theory of negative innocence established by obeying a moral law." [...] On the other hand, Anne Kostelanetz Mellor sees Har as representing simple innocence and the Vales of Har as representative of Eden. 'Har' is the Hebrew word for 'mountain', thus giving an inherent irony to the phrase [...] "Vales of Har". Damon believes this conveys the ironic sense that [...] "he who was a mountain now lives in a vale, cut off from mankind.|$|E
2500|$|William Blake, a Romantic {{poet and}} artist, thought that Wordsworth {{was at the}} same level as the poets Dante, Shakespeare, and Milton. In a diary entry for 27 December 1825, H. C. Robinson recounted a {{conversation}} between himself and William Blake shortly before Blake's death: [...] "I read to him Wordsworth's incomparable ode, which he heartily enjoyed. But he repeated, 'I fear Wordsworth loves nature, and nature is the work of the Devil. The Devil is in us as 'far as we are nature.'... The parts of Wordsworth's ode which Blake most enjoyed were the most obscure—at all events, those which I least like and comprehend." [...] Following Blake, Chauncy Hare Townshend produced [...] "An Essay on the Theory and the Writings of Wordsworth"for Blackwood's Edinburgh Magazine in 1829. In the third part, he critiqued Wordsworth's use of pre-existence within the poem and asked [...] "unless our author means to say that, having existed from all eternity, we are of an eternal and indestructible essence; or, in other words, that being incarnate portion of the Deity... we are as Immortal as himself. But if the poet intends to affirm this, do you not perceive that he frustrates his own aim?" [...] He continued by explaining why he felt that Wordsworth's concept fell short of any useful purpose: [...] "For if we are of God's indivisible essence, and receive our separate consciousness from the wall of flesh which, at our birth, was raised between us and the Found of Being, we must, on the dissolution of the body... be again merged in the simple and uncompounded Godhead, lose our individual consciousness... <b>in</b> <b>another</b> <b>sense,</b> become as though we had never been." [...] He concluded his analysis with a critique of the poem as a whole: [...] "I should say that Wordsworth does not display in it any great clearness of thought, or felicity of language... the ode in question is not so much abstruse in idea as crabbed in expression. There appears to be a laborious toiling after originality, ending in a dismal want of harmony." ...|$|E
