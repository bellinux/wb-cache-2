40|$|Abstract — The {{usage of}} multi-touch {{interfaces}} on a tabletop device, {{has been very}} explored for elder users in several domains. This interaction technique is an alternative to reducing the obstacles that older adults face {{in the use of}} computer systems, e. g., handling of peripherals. Many design guidelines are proposed in the literature {{for a wide range of}} products and systems for elders, e. g. websites, TV user interfaces. However, there is a lack of set of design <b>guidelines</b> <b>and</b> design <b>recommendations</b> of multi-touch interfaces that matches elder’s needs. This paper presents a set of design <b>guidelines</b> <b>and</b> design <b>recommendations</b> distilled <b>and</b> extracted from most relevant works on design of multi-touch interfaces for elders available in the literature. The results are a set of design guidelines, useful for designers, application developers, usability specialists and researchers...|$|R
40|$|Abstract The {{focus of}} this {{research}} was flexible endoscope reprocessing in the Republic of Ireland, focusing on staff education and testing of Automatic Endoscope Reprocessors (AER’s). A study of this kind is important as flexible endoscope reprocessing has been recognised as being fraught with difficulties from all around the world due to breaches in the multistep processes involved in reprocessing (Spinzi et al. 2008, Dirlam Langlay et al. 2013, Bajolet et al. 2013). Incidents of patients being exposed to infection as a result of ineffective cleaning are still making headlines despite the best efforts of international bodies producing standards, <b>guidelines</b> <b>and</b> <b>recommendation</b> on flexible endoscope reprocessing. This research is important as no research had been conducted into staff education and AER testing in the Republic of Ireland...|$|R
