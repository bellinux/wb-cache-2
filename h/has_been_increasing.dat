500|$|Some {{scholars}} {{think that}} the phrase [...] "shall <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>increased</b> during such time" [...] is ambiguous and allows different interpretations. For instance, it {{could be interpreted as}} meaning either [...] "shall <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>increased</b> at least once" [...] or [...] "shall <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>increased</b> on net". In the latter case the Saxbe fix would be constitutional.|$|R

5|$|A {{number of}} species are doing well in the {{increasingly}} urbanized Massachusetts. Peregrine falcons utilize office towers in larger cities as nesting areas, and the population of coyotes, whose diet may include garbage and roadkill, <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>increasing</b> in recent decades. White-tailed deer, raccoons, wild turkeys, and eastern gray squirrels are also found throughout Massachusetts. In more rural areas {{in the western part}} of Massachusetts, larger mammals such as moose and black bears have returned, largely due to reforestation following the regional decline in agriculture.|$|E
5|$|Bottom-dwelling {{and perhaps}} {{relatively}} active in nature, the Izak catshark feeds mainly on a {{diverse array of}} bony fishes, crustaceans, and cephalopods. A significant portion of its diet may be scavenged from offal discarded by fisheries. This species is oviparous, with females producing encapsulated eggs {{two at a time}} year-round. The Izak catshark is regularly caught incidentally by a South African bottom trawl commercial fishery, but is discarded rather than utilized. Despite the fishing pressure, its population <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>increasing</b> and thus the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) has assessed it as Least Concern.|$|E
30|$|According to Figs.  1 and 2, preciseness of {{the models}} {{calibrated}} <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>increased</b> in all provinces. The R 2 values are less than 0.90 for ten provinces [Esfahan (ES), Ilam (IL), SB, Fars (FA), Qom (QO), Kordestan (KO), Kermanshah (KS), KB, LO, and Yazd (YA)]. In the Papadakis model (for EA), the coefficient of the model <b>has</b> <b>been</b> decreased 11.8  %, and R 2 <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>increased</b> 6.7  %. In the Mahringer model, the multiplication coefficients <b>have</b> <b>been</b> decreased 16.6 and 32.8  %, power coefficients <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>increased</b> 91 and 207.2  %, and R 2 <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>increased</b> 11.9 and 3.2  % (average of 7.5  %) for CB and WA, respectively. In the Trabert model, the multiplication coefficients <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>increased</b> 31 and 0.7  %, power coefficients <b>have</b> <b>been</b> decreased 41.4 and − 8.6  % (increasing), but R 2 <b>has</b> not <b>been</b> changed for AR and GO, respectively (the Trabert model {{does not need to}} calibration for its the best performance in Iran). In the Ivanov model (for BU), the multiplication coefficient <b>has</b> <b>been</b> decreased 7.3  %, and R 2 <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>increased</b> 4.3  %. In the Brockamp–Wenner model (for GI), multiplication coefficient <b>has</b> <b>been</b> decreased 67.2  %, power coefficient <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>increased</b> 83.1  %, and R 2 <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>increased</b> 2.1  %. Similarly, in the Rohwer, WMO, and Penman models, we can see a considerable change in the coefficients (increasing or decreasing) and R 2 (increasing) {{of the models}} after calibration (Figs.  1, 2; Tables  2, 4). Therefore, calibration is a necessary tool for modification of mass transfer-based models to increase preciseness of estimation and to adapt the best models to weather conditions (local conditions) of each province. In the models calibrated (Fig.  2), the Rohwer estimates reference crop evapotranspiration for MZ better than the other models.|$|R

5|$|Fungal {{pneumonia}} is uncommon, but occurs {{more commonly}} in individuals with weakened immune systems due to AIDS, immunosuppressive drugs, or other medical problems. It {{is most often}} caused by Histoplasma capsulatum, blastomyces, Cryptococcus neoformans, Pneumocystis jiroveci (pneumocystis pneumonia), and Coccidioides immitis. Histoplasmosis is most common in the Mississippi River basin, and coccidioidomycosis is most common in the Southwestern United States. The number of cases <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>increasing</b> in the later half of the 20th century due to increasing travel and rates of immunosuppression in the population.|$|E
5|$|In 2013 about 3.3 {{million cases}} of self-harm occurred. Self-harm is most common {{between the ages}} of 12 and 24. Self-harm in {{childhood}} is relatively rare but the rate <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>increasing</b> since the 1980s. However, self-harm behaviour can occur at any age, including in the elderly population. The risk of serious injury and suicide is higher in older people who self-harm. Self-harm is not limited to humans. Captive animals, such as birds and monkeys, are also known to participate in self-harming behaviour.|$|E
5|$|Serpens Caput {{contains}} many RR Lyrae variables, although most are too faint {{to be seen}} without professional photography. The brightest is VY Serpentis, only of 10th magnitude. This star's period <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>increasing</b> by approximately 1.2 seconds per century. A variable star {{of a different kind}} is Tau4 Serpentis, a cool red giant that pulsates between magnitudes 5.89 and 7.07 in 87 days. This star has been found to display an inverse P Cygni profile, where cold infalling gas on to the star creates redshifted hydrogen absorption lines next to the normal emission lines.|$|E

5|$|Some {{countries}} are eliminating or reducing climate disrupting subsidies and Belgium, France, and Japan have phased out all subsidies for coal. Germany is reducing its coal subsidy. The subsidy dropped from $5.4billion in 1989 to $2.8billion in 2002, {{and in the}} process Germany lowered its coal use by 46percent. China cut its coal subsidy from $750million in 1993 to $240million in 1995 and more recently has imposed a high-sulfur coal tax. However, the United States <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>increasing</b> its support for the fossil fuel and nuclear industries.|$|E
5|$|The vast {{majority}} of Israelis drink wine in moderation, and almost always at meals or social occasions. Israelis drink about 6.5 liters of wine per person per year, which is low compared to other wine-drinking Mediterranean countries, but the per capita amount <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>increasing</b> since the 1980s as Israeli production of high-quality wine grows to meet demand, especially of semi-dry and dry wines. In addition to Israeli wines, {{an increasing number of}} wines are imported from France, Italy, Australia, the United States, Chile and Argentina.|$|E
5|$|There <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>increasing</b> {{recognition}} {{of the extent to}} which birds engage in play. Juvenile common ravens are among the most playful of bird species. They have been observed to slide down snowbanks, apparently purely for fun. They even engage in games with other species, such as playing catch-me-if-you-can with wolves, otters and dogs. Common ravens are known for spectacular aerobatic displays, such as flying in loops or interlocking talons with each other in flight.|$|E

5|$|Citi Bike {{finally began}} {{operations}} on May 27, 2013, with 332 stations. The stations {{were located in}} Manhattan south of 59th Street and in Brooklyn north of Atlantic Avenue and west of Nostrand Avenue. Officials said the system opened with 6,000 bikes. At the time of implementation, {{it was the largest}} bikesharing program in the United States. When launched, the system was slated to expand to 10,000 bicycles and 600 stations in Manhattan south of 79th Street, plus stations in several Brooklyn neighborhoods, including Greenpoint, Crown Heights, Bedford-Stuyvesant, Park Slope and Carroll Gardens as well as parts of Queens. At first, the timeline for the expansion was not made publicly available, but it was later announced that the expansion would be complete by the end of 2016. There <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>increasing</b> interest in further expansion across New York City; for example, in June 2013 a Brooklyn politician opened a petition drive to accelerate deployment in Greenpoint. In contrast, the May 2013 installation deliberately bypassed South Williamsburg.|$|E
5|$|Globally, {{autism is}} {{estimated}} to affect 24.8 million people as of 2015. As of 2010, {{the number of people}} affected is estimated at about 1–2 per 1,000 worldwide. It occurs four to five times more often in boys than girls. About 1.5% of children in the United States (one in 68) are diagnosed with ASD , a 30% increase from one in 88 in 2012. The rate of autism among adults aged 18 years and over in the United Kingdom is 1.1%. The number of people diagnosed <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>increasing</b> dramatically since the 1980s, partly due to changes in diagnostic practice; the question of whether actual rates have increased is unresolved.|$|E

5|$|In the meantime, the RAAF has {{implemented}} several {{measures to}} keep the Hornets in service. These include a structural refurbishment program, increased monitoring of fatigue-related issues as well as repainting the aircraft and frequently washing them to reduce the risks posed by corrosion. In 2015 the Defence Science and Technology Group conducted new statistical analysis of the Hornets' structural condition which found that the airframes were less fatigued than previously believed, and so able to remain in service {{for a longer period}} than planned if necessary. This finding was accepted by the Directorate General Technical Airworthiness – Australian Defence Force. As of September 2017, none of the RAAF Hornets were subject to flying restrictions due to airframe fatigue. However, the cost of maintaining the ageing aircraft in service <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>increasing.</b>|$|E
5|$|Practical {{implementations}} of road {{congestion pricing}} are found {{almost exclusively in}} urban areas, because traffic congestion is common in and around city centers. Autoroute A1 in Northern France {{is one of the}} few cases of congestion pricing implemented outside of urban areas. This is an expressway connecting Paris to Lille, and since 1992 congestion prices have been applied during weekends with the objective of spreading demand on the trip back to Paris on Sunday afternoons and evenings. As congestion pricing <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>increasing</b> worldwide, the schemes implemented have been classified into four different types: cordon area around a city center; area wide congestion pricing; city center toll ring; and corridor or single facility congestion pricing.|$|E
