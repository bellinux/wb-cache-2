30|$|Vrba and Zaporozec (1994) {{distinguished}} intrinsic (or natural) vulnerability from specific (or integrated) vulnerability; {{the first}} term defined solely {{as a function of}} hydrogeological factors and the latter term defined by the potential impacts of specific land uses and contaminants. In other words, specific vulnerability integrates the contamination risk placed upon aquifers by human activities (Stigter et al. 2006). The intrinsic vulnerability of groundwater to contaminants takes into account the geological, pedological, hydrological and hydrogeological characteristics of an area (Vrba and Zaporozec 1994). Several methods have been developed to evaluate groundwater vulnerability, and choosing an appropriate one depends on many factors such as scale of the study area, data availability, and desired results (Al-Hanbali and Kondoh 2008). The most widely used method of vulnerability evaluation is DRASTIC model (Aller et al. 1987) due to its <b>ease</b> <b>to</b> <b>use,</b> minimum data requirement, and clear explanation of groundwater vulnerability.|$|E
