25|$|Consistent with {{principles}} of good laboratory practice, calibration is performed {{with at least}} two standard buffer solutions that span the range of pH values to be measured. For general purposes, buffers at pH 4.00 and pH 10.00 are suitable. The pH meter has one calibration control to set the meter reading equal to the value of the first standard buffer and a second control to adjust the meter reading to the value of the second buffer. A third control allows the temperature to be set. Standard buffer sachets, available from a variety of suppliers, usually document the temperature dependence of the buffer control. More precise measurements sometimes require calibration at three different pH values. Some pH meters provide built-in temperature-coefficient correction, with temperature thermocouples in the electrode probes. The calibration process correlates the voltage produced by the probe (approximately 0.06volts per pH unit) with the pH scale. Good laboratory practice dictates that, after each measurement, the probes are rinsed with distilled water or deionized water to remove any traces of the solution being measured, blotted with a scientific wipe to absorb any remaining water, which could <b>dilute</b> <b>the</b> <b>sample</b> and thus alter the reading, and then immersed in a storage solution suitable for the particular probe type.|$|E

50|$|A {{small sample}} of flue gas is extracted, {{by means of a}} pump, into the CEM system via a sample probe.

Dilution is used because pure flue gas can be hot, wet and, with some pollutants, sticky. Once diluted to the appropriate ratio, the sample is transported through a sample line (typically referred to as an umbilical) to a manifold from which individual analyzers may extract a sample. Gas analyzers employ various techniques to accurately measure concentrations. Some commonly used techniques include: infrared and ultraviolet adsorption, chemiluminescence, fluorescence and beta ray absorption. After analysis, the gas exits the analyzer to a common manifold to all analyzers where it is vented out of doors. A Data Acquisition and Handling System (DAHS) receives the signal output from each analyzer in order to collect and record emissions data.|$|E

50|$|Microtox can {{be applied}} to a variety of {{matrices}} including drinking water, stormwater runoff, effluent, industrial discharges, soils and sediments. Most samples do not require special preparation before testing besides adjusting the salinity to 2%. However, samples that have certain characteristics, such as high turbidity levels, may require special preparation. If samples require a salinity adjustment to lower the salinity, this can be accomplished by adding an appropriate amount of Microtox Osmotic Adjusting Solution to <b>dilute</b> <b>the</b> <b>sample.</b> For example, adding 0.1 mL of MOAS to 1 mL of sample would result in a dilution of 90.9% of the original concentration. If a greater salinity is required, this can be accomplished by dissolving solid sodium chloride in the sample to achieve a final salinity of 2% for the protection of Allivibrio fischeri. Highly turbid samples that contain particulate matter will be required to settle before the test can be conducted. Particulate matter in the sample can interfere with bioluminescence by absorbing light and give misleading test results. Interference of luminescence can also occur with samples which are highly colored (particularly red, brown or black). It may be necessary to centrifuge samples to obtain an acceptable clarity for the test. If samples contain chlorine, this may alter the toxicity to Allivibrio fischeri and also give misleading results. The samples can be de-chlorinated using a sodium thiosulphate and deionized water solution that does not affect test results. Ideally, the pH of samples should not be modified since it is preferable to test each sample at the original pH level. However, if it is necessary to adjust the pH this should be done by adding either sodium hydroxide solution or hydrochloric acid to the sample.|$|E

40|$|A liquid-chromatography {{technique}} {{has been developed}} {{for use in the}} quantitative analysis of urea (and of other nonvolatile organic compounds typically found with urea) dissolved in water. The technique involves the use of a column that contains an ion-exclusion resin; heretofore, this column has been sold for use in analyzing monosaccharides and food softeners, but not for analyzing water supplies. The prior technique commonly used to analyze water for urea content has been one of high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC), with reliance on hydrophobic interactions between analytes in a water sample and long-chain alkyl groups bonded to an HPLC column. The prior {{technique has}} proven inadequate because of a strong tendency toward co-elution of urea with other compounds. Co-elution often causes the urea and other compounds to be crowded into a narrow region of the chromatogram (see left part of figure), thereby giving rise to low chromatographic resolution and misidentification of compounds. It is possible to quantitate urea or another analyte via ultraviolet- and visible-light absorbance measurements, but in order to perform such measurements, it is necessary to <b>dilute</b> <b>the</b> <b>sample,</b> causing a significant loss of sensitivity. The ion-exclusion resin used in the improved technique is sulfonated polystyrene in the calcium form. Whereas the alkyl-chain column used in the prior technique separates compounds on the basis of polarity only, the ion-exclusion-resin column used in the improved technique separates compounds on the basis of both molecular size and electric charge. As a result, the degree of separation is increased: instead of being crowded together into a single chromatographic peak only about 1 to 2 minutes wide as in the prior technique, the chromatographic peaks of different compounds are now separated from each other and spread out over a range about 33 minutes wide (see right part of figure), and the urea peak can readily be distinguished from the other peaks. Although the analysis takes more time in the improved technique, this disadvantage is offset by two important advantages: Sensitivity is increased. The minimum concentration of urea that can be measured is reduced (to between 1 / 5 and 1 / 3 of that of the prior technique) because {{it is not necessary to}} <b>dilute</b> <b>the</b> <b>sample.</b> The separation of peaks facilitates the identification and quantitation of the various compounds. The resolution of the compounds other than urea makes it possible to identify those compounds by use of mass spectrometry...|$|E
40|$|Summary: The Limulus amoeboeyte lysate {{test for}} {{endotoxin}} is inhibited or enhanced by many substances. It is particularly {{difficult to determine}} endotoxin in plasma. In order to overcome this problem, we have modified the specific endotoxin assay method by using a membrane fllter unit, a chromogenic Limulus amoeboeyte lysate rea-gent, and immobilized histidine (which is a specific adsorbent for endotoxins). This immobilized histidine method consists of the endotoxin adsorption Step on immobilized histidine, the Separation Step, in which Limulus amoebo-eyte lysate-interfering substances are removed, and the Limulus amoeboeyte lysate test. Preheating of plasma sam-ples (40 -fold dilution with distilled water, at 100 °C for 7. 5 min) was necessary, and {{it was necessary to}} <b>dilute</b> <b>the</b> <b>sample</b> more than 100 -fold for the adsorption Step.

40|$|International audienceAn {{analytical}} method devoted to organotin compounds (OTC) determination in brandy and wine was developed. It {{is based on}} solid-phase microextraction (SPME) of ethylated organotins. The following operating factors were examined: SPME mode/nature of fibre coating, sample volume/dilution, and sampling time. The optimisation work led to <b>dilute</b> <b>the</b> <b>sample</b> in an aqueous buffer (1 / 11, v/v ratio) in order to satisfactorily decrease the matrix effects due to competitive sorption of non-OTC species onto/into fibre coating. The optimised operating conditions consist of polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) coated fibre used in headspace mode for 30 min. In wines, the limits of detection (LOD) and quantification (LOQ) ranged from 1 to 40 and 3 to 80 ng(Sn) L- 1 respectively, according to the species. The analytical validation was made by evaluating the accuracy of OTC determination in spiked samples with various concentrations over the whole calibration range, i. e. from LOQ to 1000 ng(Sn) L- 1. Recovery was around 80 - 110 % and precision (relative standard deviation, RSD) was between 12 % and 25 %. Despite the presence of two chromatographic peaks corresponding to sulphur compounds during brandy analysis, the selectivity of the method is adequate. The analysis confirmed the analytical performances and applicability of the method to wine and brandy samples. The obtained results emphasise the contamination of brandy and wine by organotins, the storage in plastic container seeming to be confirmed as the main OTC source. © 2007 Elsevier B. V.

40|$|Several {{types of}} engine exhaust contain {{moisture}} {{that must be}} maintained in gaseous state when sampling particulates to prevent potential destruction of the particles or damage to the measurement apparatus. This is normally achieved by <b>diluting</b> <b>the</b> <b>sample</b> {{in order to reduce}} the partial pressure, thus avoiding condensation.

We present data showing the transfer of peptides to the gas phase, where ions are detected by MS. These peptide ions were subsequently fragmented by collision-induced dissociation, from which the sequence was assigned. Unlike MALDI mass spectra, which are typically contaminated with matrix ions at low m/z, the SAWN generated spectra had no such interference. In continuous mode, the SAWN plume was sampled on a microsecond time scale by a linear ion trap mass spectrometer and produced multiply charged peptide precursor ions with a charge state distribution shifted to higher m/z compared to an identical sample analyzed by ESI. The SAWN technology also provides the opportunity to re-examine a sample from a flat surface, repeatedly. The process can be performed without the need for capillaries, which can clog, reservoirs, which <b>dilute</b> <b>the</b> <b>sample,</b> and electrodes, which when in direct contact with sample, cause unwanted electrochemical oxidation.

The development of sample introduction techniques for solid materials is a desirable goal in analytical atomic spectrometry. Traditional techniques have involved the introduction of samples as liquids by processes such as nebulisation. However some solid materials are not readily amenable to dissolution procedures and for the determination of elements at the ultra-trace level the reagents used for dissolution may produce undesired contamination. An additional problem for such determinations is that the dissolution process- may <b>dilute</b> <b>the</b> <b>sample</b> below the level which can be measured by the selected technique. The relative merits of three techniques for the introduction of solids for inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectroscopy (ICP-OES) and inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICP-MS) have been evaluated in this thesis. The techniques studied were a laser ablation system based on a Nd:YAG laser, slurry nebulisation and an electrothermal vaporisation (ETV) system.

40|$|Total {{reflection}} X-ray fluorescence (TXRF) {{is becoming}} more and more popular for elemental analysis in academia and industry. However, simplification of the procedures for analyzing samples with complex compositions and residual matrix effects is still needed. In this work, the effect of an inorganic (CaCl 2) and an organic (tetraalkylphosphonium chloride) matrix on metals quantification by TXRF was investigated for liquid samples. The samples were spiked with up to 20 metals at concentrations ranging from 3 to 50 mg L– 1 per element, including elements with spectral peaks near the peaks of the matrix elements or near the Raleigh and Compton scattering peaks of the X-ray source (molybdenum anode). The recovery rate (RR) and the relative standard deviation (RSD) were calculated to express the accuracy and the precision of the measured element concentrations. In samples with no matrix effects, good RRs are obtained regardless of the internal standard selected. However, in samples with moderate matrix content, the use of an optimum internal standard (OIS) at a concentration close to that of the analyte significantly improved the quantitative analysis. In samples with high concentrations of inorganic ions, using a Triton X- 100 aqueous solution to <b>dilute</b> <b>the</b> <b>sample</b> during the internal standardization resulted in better RRs and lower RSDs compared to using only water. In samples with a high concentration of organic material, pure ethanol gave slightly better results than when a Triton X- 100 –ethanol solution was used for dilution. Compared to previous methods reported in the literature, the new sample-preparation method gave better accuracy, precision, and sensitivity for the elements tested. Sample dilution with an OIS and the surfactant Triton X- 100 (inorganic media) or ethanol (organic media) is recommended for fast routine elemental determination in matrix containing samples, as it does not require special equipment, experimentally derived case-dependent mathematical corrections, or physicochemical removal of interfering elements. status: publishe...|$|E
