5|$|The maximum hair length that is {{possible}} to reach is about 15cm (6in) for infants (below the age of 1), about 60cm (24in) for children, and generally 100cm (40in) for adults. Documentation for decrease of the maximum length with age cannot be <b>found</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>literature.</b> Some individuals can reach excessive lengths. Lengths greater than 150cm (59in) are frequently observed in long hair contests. Xie Qiuping had the longest documented hair in the world, measuring 5.627 m (18ft 5.54 in) in May 2004.|$|E
5|$|Many sunscreens use {{nanoparticles}} of {{zinc oxide}} (along with nanoparticles of titanium dioxide) because such small particles do not scatter light and therefore {{do not appear}} white. There has been concern {{that they might be}} absorbed into the skin. A study published in 2010 found a 0.23% to 1.31% (mean 0.42%) of blood zinc levels in venous blood samples could be traced to zinc from ZnO nanoparticles applied to human skin for 5 days, and traces were also found in urine samples. In contrast, a comprehensive review of the medical literature from 2011 says that no evidence of systemic absorption can be <b>found</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>literature.</b>|$|E
5|$|The {{physical}} and chemical properties of the alkali metals can be readily explained by their having an ns1 valence electron configuration, which results in weak metallic bonding. Hence, all the alkali metals are soft and have low densities, melting and boiling points, as well as heats of sublimation, vaporisation, and dissociation. They all crystallise in the body-centered cubic crystal structure, and have distinctive flame colours because their outer s electron is very easily excited. The ns1 configuration also results in the alkali metals having very large atomic and ionic radii, as well as very high thermal and electrical conductivity. Their chemistry is dominated by the loss of their lone valence electron in the outermost s-orbital to form the +1 oxidation state, due to the ease of ionising this electron and the very high second ionisation energy. Most of the chemistry has been observed only for the first five members of the group. The chemistry of francium is not well established due to its extreme radioactivity; thus, the presentation of its properties here is limited. What little is known about francium shows that it is very close in behaviour to caesium, as expected. The physical properties of francium are even sketchier because the bulk element has never been observed; hence any data that may be <b>found</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>literature</b> are certainly speculative extrapolations.|$|E

25|$|Merkabah/Merkavah mysticism (or Chariot mysticism) is {{a school}} of early Jewish mysticism, c. 100 BCE – 1000 CE, {{centered}} on visions such as {{those found in the}} Book of Ezekiel chapter 1, or in the hekhalot ("palaces") literature, concerning stories of ascents to the heavenly palaces and the Throne of God.

25|$|In {{contrast}} to powder snow avalanches, wet snow avalanches are a low velocity suspension {{of snow and}} water, with the flow confined to the track surface (McClung, first edition 1999, page 108). The low speed of travel {{is due to the}} friction between the sliding surface of the track and the water saturated flow. Despite the low speed of travel (~10–40km/h), wet snow avalanches are capable of generating powerful destructive forces, due to the large mass, and density. The body of the flow of a wet snow avalanche can plough through soft snow, and can scour boulders, earth, trees, and other vegetation; leaving exposed, and often scored, ground in the avalanche track. Wet snow avalanches can be initiated from either loose snow releases, or slab releases, and only occur in snow packs that are water saturated and isothermally equilibrated to the melting point of water. The isothermal characteristic of wet snow avalanches has led to the secondary term of isothermal slides <b>found</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>literature</b> (for example in Daffern, 1999, page 93). At temperate latitudes wet snow avalanches are frequently associated with climatic avalanche cycles {{at the end of the}} winter season, when there is significant daytime warming.|$|E
