50|$|Due {{to a short}} {{cable length}} specifcation and {{shielding}} issues it is extremely uncommon to find <b>external</b> PATA <b>devices</b> that directly use PATA for connection to a computer. A device connected externally needs additional cable length to form a U-shaped bend so that the <b>external</b> <b>device</b> may be placed alongside, or {{on top of the}} computer case, and the standard cable length is too short to permit this. For ease of reach from motherboard to <b>device,</b> the <b>connectors</b> tend to be positioned towards the front edge of motherboards, for connection to devices protruding {{from the front of the}} computer case. This front-edge position makes extension out the back to an <b>external</b> <b>device</b> even more difficult. Ribbon cables are poorly shielded, and the standard relies upon the cabling to be installed inside a shielded computer case to meet RF emissions limits.|$|R

5000|$|For small {{form-factor}} <b>devices</b> (such as <b>external</b> 2.5 in disks), a PC-hosted USB or FireWire link {{can usually}} supply sufficient power {{to operate the}} <b>device.</b> However, eSATA <b>connectors</b> cannot supply power, and require a power supply for the <b>external</b> <b>device.</b> The related eSATAp (but mechanically incompatible, sometimes called eSATA/USB) connector adds power to an external SATA connection, so that an additional power supply is not needed.|$|R
50|$|External {{hard disk}} drives or optical disk drives {{that have an}} {{internal}} PATA interface, use some other interface technology to bridge {{the distance between the}} <b>external</b> <b>device</b> and the computer. USB is the most common external interface, followed by Firewire. A bridge chip inside the <b>external</b> <b>devices</b> converts from the USB interface to PATA, and typically only supports a single <b>external</b> <b>device</b> without cable select or master/slave.|$|R

40|$|Universal Serial Bus (USB) {{devices are}} high {{transmission}} speed <b>external</b> <b>devices.</b> USB is the speediest <b>external</b> <b>device</b> available today. The access to USB is very simple, convenient and fast {{compared to other}} <b>external</b> <b>devices</b> such as CD, DVD, Floppy drive etc. Thus USB have become most popular interface standard for hardware connection. But from security point of view, USB devices lacks security as no user is restricted to access USB device. If we restrict the use of USB devices, then the data access through <b>external</b> <b>devices</b> would be as chaotic as before. Thus a system which would provide fast access as well as security is required. In this paper, we propose a system which deals with mutual authentication and key agreement {{in order to provide}} security for access through USB devices...|$|R

40|$|We {{determined}} {{the validity of}} using <b>external</b> <b>devices</b> for urine specimen collection from 24 elderly incontinent men residing {{in a nursing home}} by collecting three sequential specimens, two with <b>external</b> <b>devices</b> and then one by catheterization. The positive predictive value of organisms isolated in quantitative counts of {{greater than or equal to}} 10 (5) CFU/ml in <b>external</b> <b>devices</b> for bladder bacteriuria was 86 % for either sterile or clean collecting devices and 93 % for the same organism in two consecutive specimens. The negative predictive value for organisms present in quantitative counts of less than 10 (5) CFU/ml was 90 % for both sterile and clean devices and 86 % when the organism was present in both specimens. Contamination in <b>external</b> collection <b>devices</b> was not influenced by whether the device was clean or sterile, circumcision of the resident, or duration of time between device application and specimen collection. These data suggest that urine specimens collected by ward nursing staff with <b>external</b> <b>devices</b> are reliable for the diagnosis of bacteriuria in this patient population...|$|R

This thesis explores the possibility of controlling an IPSet-Top-Box from an <b>external</b> <b>device.</b> The focus of this report and thesis is finding a way for <b>external</b> <b>devices</b> to control IP-Set-Top-Boxesrunning the KreaTV platform. To open up for this possibility a service running in the KreaTVplatform was designed and implemented to handle communication from <b>external</b> <b>devices.</b> Aprotocol for communication was structured and defined to allow devices to communicate with theplatform. The protocol includes a base structure defined for general use when communicating withapplications and services in the platform. The base structure was extended and defined forcommunication with the Set-Top-Box application running the graphical user interface. An Android application was used {{to demonstrate that the}} design solution presented in this reportopens up for the possibility of <b>external</b> <b>devices</b> to control the IP-Set-Top-Box beyond the limitationsof a normal infrared remote control.
