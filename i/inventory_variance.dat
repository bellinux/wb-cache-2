40|$|A simple {{dynamic model}} of a hybrid manufacturing/remanufacturing system is investigated. In {{particular}} we study an infinite horizon, continuous time, APIOBPCS (Automatic Pipeline Inventory and Order Based Production Control System) model. We use Åström’s method to quantify variance ratios in the closed loop supply chain. Specifically we highlight {{the effect of a}} combined “in-use” and remanufacturing lead-time and the return rate on the <b>inventory</b> <b>variance</b> and bullwhip produced by the ordering policy. Our results clearly show that a larger return rate leads to less bullwhip and less <b>inventory</b> <b>variance</b> in the plant producing new components. Thus returns can be used to absorb demand fluctuations to some extent. Longer remanufacturing and “in-use” lead-times have less impact at reducing <b>inventory</b> <b>variance</b> and bullwhip than shorter lead-times. We find that, within our specified system, that <b>inventory</b> <b>variance</b> and bullwhip is always less in supply chains with returns than supply chains without returns. We conclude by separating out the remanufacturing lead-time from the “in-use” lead-time and investigating its impact on our findings. We find that short remanufacturing lead-times do not qualitatively change our results...|$|E

40|$|We analyse a three echelon {{supply chain}} model. First-order autoregressive end {{consumer}} demand is assumed.

After demonstrating that the character of the stochastic ordering process observed at each level of the supply chain is mathematically tractable, we show that the upper stream participants have complete information of the market demand process. Then we quantify the bullwhip produced by the system, together with the amplification ratios of the variance of the net inventory levels. Our analysis reveals that the level of the supply chain has no impact upon the bullwhip effect, rather bullwhip is determined by the accumulated lead-time from the customer and the local replenishment lead-time. We also find that the conditional variance of the forecast error over the lead-time is identical to the variance of the net inventory levels and that the net <b>inventory</b> <b>variance</b> is dominated by the local replenishment lead-time.

40|$|One of {{the most}} {{important}} objectives of a manufacturing company is the optimization of the distribution of the produced goods considering the whole value chain. Unfortunately, in many companies the performance of the supply chain depends on many uncertain factors that are difficult to predict. The only way to face them is to adopt innovative solutions and tools that allow a swift response to the market changes. This paper analyzes the distribution processes managed by the logistics department of a large company producing and distributing petroleum products through the following main steps: crude oil’s transportation typically from many countries to a refinery; refining process; maritime transportation from the refinery to three costal depots; road transport from depots to gas stations. The analyzed process is the primary supply, consisting in the maritime transport from the refinery to the coastal depots, liable to stochastic activities and events as weather condition. Through simulating the primary supply, we study the effects that the ship traffic generates on the overall <b>variance</b> of <b>inventory</b> levels at the costal depots with respect to specific inventory level targets, and analyze the impact of different tactical decision choices on the <b>variance</b> reduction. Reducing <b>inventory’s</b> <b>variance,</b> through a better control of the distribution, allows the company to reduce inventory target levels and hence to reduce inventory costs in term of capital stock, while keeping the same risk level of stock out. The project is made of many phases: map all relevant processes to have a complete vision of transport’s structure; conduct a statistical analysis to identify specific statistical distributions of every ships’ process (delay, mooring, loading, etc.); model and simulate the primary supply using simulation software; use the model to make a “what-if” analysis. Within this project, it has been possible to realize a model that presents stochastic elements. All these phases are supported by six-sigma methodology, which focalizes on defects' process reduction by the control of its mean square deviation and following the stages of the DMAIC (Define Measure Analyze Improve Control). One of the what-if analysis which has been done consists in simulating the opening refinery’s jetties h 24, because currently these are closed during the night. Opening the jetties, will increase the capacity of some of the bottleneck resources for the oil distribution process, and thanks to the simulation model we can estimate quickly the effects on the oil transport system...|$|R

Based on this a relatively simple expression for the 'full-state' policy is derived.

40|$|A {{major cause}} of supply chain {{deficiencies}} is the bullwhip effect. Supply chain managers experience this variance amplification in both inventory levels and replenishment orders. In this paper, we analyse a {{major cause of}} the bullwhip effect, namely the classical Order-Up-To (OUT) policy and suggest a remedy (a smoothing replenishment rule). In general, dampening variability in orders may {{have a negative impact on}} customer service due to increase in <b>inventory</b> <b>variance.</b> We quantify the variance of the Net Stock (NS) levels and compute the required safety stock as a function of the smoothing required.

40|$|Purpose – The aim of {{this article}} is to provide a concise {{methodology}} for the design of a widely used class of decision supply systems (DSS) which will enable precise control of bullwhip variance and <b>inventory</b> <b>variance</b> induced within a supply chain echelon. Design/methodology/approach – The study exploits recent research that derived analytical formulae for calculating these performance metrics germane to the delivery process when the demand is randomly varying about a constant mean value. These formulae have been verified via extensive simulation-based cross-checks. Findings – The design methodology focuses on the specification of bullwhip variance as an input. The output is to identify combinations of parameter settings to meet this target. Hence these parameters may be mapped to provide a visual display of competing designs with their associated <b>inventory</b> <b>variance.</b> Research limitations/implications – Although the analytical solutions apply only to the case where the pipeline error and inventory error correction terms are equal, this is not a severe limitation. Both theoretical studies of dynamic response and industrial experience support this feedback gain equally as enabling good practice. Practical implications – Design of this particular DSS to control bullwhip is now greatly simplified, and guaranteed via extensive verification tests. The formulae are equally sound as a means of establishing system robustness. Originality/value – The methodology is unique in enabling transparency of both bullwhip variance and <b>inventory</b> <b>variance</b> computation.

40|$|Purpose This {{research}} aims {{at exploring}} {{the effect of}} inventory record inaccuracy due to behavioral aspects of workers on the order and <b>inventory</b> <b>variance</b> amplification. Design/methodology/approach We adopt a continuous-time analytical approach to describe the effect of inbound throughput on the inventory and order variance amplification due to the workload pressure and arousal of workers. The model is numerically solved through simulation and results are analyzed with statistical general linear model. Findings Inventory management policies that usually dampen variance amplification are not effective when inaccuracy is generated due to workers’ behavioral aspects. Specifically, the psychological sensitivity and stability of workers {{to deal with a}} given range of operational conditions have a combined and multiplying effect over the amplification of order and <b>inventory</b> <b>variance</b> generated by her/his errors. Research limitations/implications The main limitation of our research is that we model workers’ behavior by inheriting a well-known theory from psychology that assumes a U-shaped relationship between stress and errors. We do not validate this relationship in the specific context of inventory operations. Practical implications The paper gives suggestions for managers who are responsible for designing order and inventory policies on how to take into account workers’ behavioral reaction to work pressure.

40|$|This {{paper is}} aimed at filling the gap between theory and {{practice}} in the area of safety stocks under MRP environments. It is focused on providing a new methodology for dimensioning an overall buffer against uncertainty in market demand, which often plagues SMEs – that act as sub-contractors or suppliers within large projects or they have a reduced bargaining power – and adversely affects their performances. The proposed methodology suggests to split the amount of safety stocks, as dimensioned according to the traditional methodology, in “new” safety stocks to face the “usual ” demand variance and in “strategic ” stocks, to face peaks in market demand. To this purpose, a set of recommended guidelines is reported to effectively dimension and position safety and/or strategic stocks within products bills of materials and manufacturing pipelines. Finally, a case study is reported, where the benefits for the company coming from the adoption of the new proposed methodology lie in achieving the 95 % target service level even under peak demand conditions, being the value of safety stocks as a whole grown only by about 20 %.

40|$|At a {{time when}} the use of fossil fuel means {{increasing}} energy scarcity and an environmental crisis in {{the world in which we}} live, we need green innovations now more than ever. Growing attention has been drawn to the use of biofuels, such as bioethanol and biodiesel, which have gradually come to make up part of the total energy supply. Despite its rapid development, uncertainties about the environmental and ecological aspects of the production and consumption of biofuel still exist. A life cycle analysis (LCA), with deliberate system boundaries and life cycle inventories, has been applied to evaluate two principal functional parameters, the energy efficiency and GHG balance, from the cradle to the grave of different biofuel feedstocks. However, the results of the entire lifetime estimates varied dramatically in production chains, which make it difficult to take a holistic view about energy intake and yields, economic costs and values, environmental impacts and their benefits.

The aim {{of this study was to}} compare the QOL of Italian children and adolescents with ARM to the QOL of a large control sample of healthy peers. METHOD: Parents of 109 children with ARM and 336 schoolchildren, completed the Pediatric Quality of Life <b>Inventory.</b> Analysis of <b>variances</b> were used to compare the groups. RESULTS: Compared to healthy peers, children with ARM showed lower emotional functioning (F = 8, 41; p =. 004), social functioning (F = 4, 9; p =. 027) and school functioning (F = 14, 7; p =. 000). In the adolescent group, females had a worse QOL in the physical functioning domain (F = 5, 01; p =. 03) than males, independent of group membership.

40|$|The bullwhip {{effect is}} defined as the {{distortion}} of demand information as one moves upstream in the supply chain, causing severe inefficiencies in the whole supply chain. Although extensive research has been conducted to study the causes of the bullwhip effect and seek mitigation solutions with respect to several demand processes, less attention has been devoted to the impact of seasonal demand in multi‐echelon supply chains. This paper considers a simulation approach to study the effect of demand seasonality on the bullwhip effect and inventory stability in a four‐echelon supply chain that adopts a base stock ordering policy with a moving average method. The results show that high seasonality levels reduce the bullwhip effect ratio, <b>inventory</b> <b>variance</b> ratio, and average fill rate to a great extent; especially when the demand noise is low. In contrast, all the performance measures become less sensitive to the seasonality level when the noise is high. This performance indicates that using the ratios to measure seasonal supply chain dynamics is misleading, and that it is better to directly use the variance (without dividing by the demand variance) as the estimates for the bullwhip effect and inventory performance. The results also show that the supply chain performances are highly sensitive to forecasting and safety stock parameters, regardless of the seasonality level. Furthermore, the impact of information sharing quantification shows that all the performance measures are improved regardless of demand seasonality. With information sharing, the bullwhip effect and <b>inventory</b> <b>variance</b> ratios are consistent with average fill rate results...|$|E
40|$|A {{discrete}} {{linear control}} theory {{model of a}} generic model of a replenishment rule is presented. The replenishment rule, which we term a “Deziel Eilon—automatic pipeline, inventory and order-based production control system”, is guaranteed to be stable. From a z-transform model of the policy, an analytical expression for bullwhip is derived that is directly equivalent to the common statistical measure often used in simulation, statistical and empirical studies to quantify the bullwhip effect. This analytical expression clearly shows that we can reduce bullwhip by taking {{a fraction of the}} error between the target and actual inventory and pipeline (or work in progress (WIP) or “orders placed but not yet received”) positions. This is in contrast to the common situation where ordering policies account for all of the error every time an order is placed. Furthermore, increasing {{the average age of the}} forecast reduces bullwhip, as does reducing the production/distribution lead-time. We then derive an analytical expression for <b>inventory</b> <b>variance</b> using the same procedure to identify the closed form bullwhip expression. We assume that a suitable objective function is linearly related to the bullwhip and <b>inventory</b> <b>variance</b> amplification ratios and then optimise the PIC system for different weightings of order rate and inventory level variance. We highlight two forms of the objective function, one where “the golden ratio” can be used to determine the optimal gain in the inventory and WIP feedback loop and another that allows the complete range of possible solutions to be visualised. It is interesting that the golden ratio, which commonly describes the optimum behaviour in the natural world, also describes the optimal feedback gain in a production and inventory control system...|$|E

Growing attention has been drawn to the use of biofuels, such as bioethanol and biodiesel, which have gradually come to make up part of the total energy supply. Uncertainties about the environmental and ecological aspects of the production and consumption of biofuel still exist despite its rapid development. A life cycle analysis (LCA) evaluates the two principal functional parameters 1) energy efficiency and 2) Greenhouse Gas (GHG) balance of different feedstocks for biodiesel production from the cradle to the grave. By accounting a life cycle analysis stage by stage, we can ascertain the change in GHG emissions and energy demand that result from the various uses of feedstocks for the production of biodiesel. In this thesis, various life cycle analysis models are reviewed and evaluated with emphasis on specific biofuels. Different LCA models depend on different LCA calculation under different situations, including GREET, LEM, SimaPro, etc. The software SimaPro was used to compare the life cycle GHG emissions and energy demand from conventional petroleum fuels and several hydro-processed renewable green diesels. A consistent methodology was used for selected fuel pathways to facilitate relatively equitable comparisons. The building of life cycle flow tree in SimaPro combined the input and output with an emphasis on the following stages 1) raw material farming and acquisition, 2) liquid fuel production, 3) transport, 4) refueling, 5) liquid fuel conversion to biodiesel and 6) end uses. Consistent impact assessment methods were chosen for simulation, equitable comparisons and comprehensive analysis of selected fuel pathways for the calculation of Global Warming Potential (GWP) and Cumulative Energy Demand (CED). However, the results of the entire lifetime estimates vary dramatically in production chains, which make it difficult to take a holistic view about energy intake and yields, economic costs and values, environmental impacts and their benefits.

Before {{the demand is}} realized, each retailer independently orders her initial inventory. After the demand is realized, the retailers select an optimal transshipment pattern and ship residual inventories to meet residual demands. Unsold inventories are salvaged {{at the end of}} the period. We compare two methods for distribution of residual profit [...] transshipment prices (TPs) and dual allocations (DAs) [...] that were previously analyzed in literature. TPs are selected before the demand is known, and DAs, which are obtained by calculating the dual prices for the transshipment problem, are calculated after observing the true demand. We first study the conditions for the existence of the Nash equilibria under DA and then compare the performance of the two methods and show that neither allocation method dominates the other. Our analysis suggests that DAs may yield higher efficiency among "more asymmetric" retailers, whereas TPs work better with retailers that are "more alike," but the difference in profits does not seem significant. We also link expected dual prices to TPs and use those results to develop heuristics for TPs with more than two symmetric retailers. For general instances with more than two asymmetric retailers, we propose a TP agreement that uses a neutral central depot to coordinate the transshipments (TPND). Although DAs in general outperform TPND in our numerical simulations, its ease of implementation makes TPND an attractive alternative to DAs when the efficiency losses are not significant (e. g., high critical fractiles or lower demand <b>variances).</b> <b>inventory</b> sharing, supply chain coordination, transshipment...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{describes}} a safeguards approach {{that can be}} deployed at any modern plutonium processing facility to increase the level of safeguards assurance and significantly reduce the impact of safeguards on process operations. One of the most perplexing problems facing the designers of plutonium processing facilities is the constraint placed upon the limit of error of the inventory difference (LEID). The current DOE manual constrains the LEID for Category I and II material balance areas to 2 per cent of active inventory up to a Category II quantity of the material being processed. For 239 Pu a Category II quantity is two kilograms. Due to the large material throughput anticipated {{for some of the}} modern plutonium facilities, the required LEID cannot be achieved reliably during a nominal two month inventory period, even by using state-of-the-science non-destructive assay (NDA) methods. The most cost-effective and least disruptive solution appears to be increasing the frequency of material balance closure and thus reducing the throughput being measured during each inventory period. Current inventory accounting practices and systems can already provide the book inventory values at any point in time. However, closing the material balance with measured values has typically required the process to be cleaned out, and in-process materials packaged and measured. This process requires one to two weeks of facility down time every two months for each inventory, thus significantly reducing productivity. To provide a solution to this problem, a non-traditional approach is proposed that will include using in-line instruments to provide measurement of the process materials on a near real-time basis. A new software component will be developed that will operate with the standard LANMAS application to provide the running material balance reconciliation, including the calculation of the <b>inventory</b> difference and <b>variance</b> propagation.

We demonstrate that high customer service as measured by fill rate, and smooth replenishments are not mutually exclusive. We observe that in many instances of the ARMA demand pattern this comes {{at the expense of}} a relatively small increase in safety stock, while in other instances inventory levels can actually be reduced.

40|$|We {{investigate}} a three-echelon manufacturing and remanufacturing closed-loop supply chain (CLSC) constituting of a retailer, a manufacturer and a supplier. Each echelon, {{apart from its}} usual operations in the forward SC (FSC), has its own reverse logistics (RL) operations. We assume that RL information is transparent to the FSC, and the same replenishment policies are used throughout the supply chain. We focus on the impact on dynamic performance of uncertainties in the return yield, RL lead time and the product consumption lead time. Two outcomes are studied: order rate and serviceable inventory. The results suggest that higher return yield improves dynamic performance in terms of overshoot and risk of stock-out with a unit step response as input. However, when the return yield reaches a certain level, the classic bullwhip propagation normally associated with the FSC does not always hold. The longer remanufacturing and product consumption lead times result in a higher overshoot and a longer time to recover inventory, {{as well as more}} oscillation in the step response at the upstream echelons. We also study bullwhip and <b>inventory</b> <b>variance</b> when demand is a random variable. Our analysis suggests that higher return yield contributes to reduced bullwhip and <b>inventory</b> <b>variance</b> at the echelon level but for the CLSC as a whole the level of bullwhip may decrease as well as increase as it propagates along the supply chain. The reason for such behaviour is due to the interaction of the various model parameters and should be the subject of further analytical research. Furthermore, by studying the three-echelon CLSC, we produce a general equation for eliminating inventory offsets in an n-echelon CLSC. This is helpful to managers who wish to maintain inventory service levels in multi-echelon CLSCs...|$|E
40|$|Purpose The {{purpose of}} this paper is to analyse the impact of reverse {{logistics}} on order and <b>inventory</b> <b>variance</b> amplification in a single-echelon supply chain and to propose a new order policy for dampening such amplification. Design/Methodology/Approach A general review of the literature on sustainable operations and on the impact of reverse logistics on SC performance provides the foundation for the study. We use difference equation math approach for modelling and analysing a closed supply chain. A proper design of experiment and data collected from the European Union statistics validate the obtained numerical results. Findings The variability of reverse flow in a closed loop supply chain increases the serviceable <b>inventory</b> <b>variance.</b> However, a proper design of the reverse flow considerably improves the global performance. To this purpose, we propose a new order policy, namely R-APIOBPCS, which explicitly considers the reverse flow of products. Research limitations/Implications The paper presents a math model describing a closed loop supply chain. No empirical analysis is provided. Future researches should evaluate the impact of the proposed R-APIOBPCS on more realistic closed loop supply chain models. Practical implications Our findings may motivate logistics and supply chain managers to implement CLSC when supported by innovative, suitable tools for the proper management of the information and material flow in the chain. Managers should be well acquainted that, by doing so, they not only satisfy National and International legislations but also achieve improvements in logistics performance. Originality/Value We propose a novel replenishment rule that accurately coordinates the upstream and downstream flows in a SC. The proposed order policy can be reasonably considered one of the advocated managerial tools for the proper management of reverse logistics: it allows reducing inventory and limiting the variability of the orders placed to suppliers in supply chain with reverse logistics...|$|E
40|$|Although {{self-concept}} {{has been}} a prominent and highly utilized hypothetical construct in psychological research for many years, studies attempting to establish the validity of self-concept instruments are relatively few in number. The {{purpose of this study}} was to determine the cross-structural validity of selected self-concept measures [...] to determine if self-reports and behavioral ratings of self-concept measure the same construct. There were 202 subjects who participated in the study. They were selected from a pool of fourth-, fifth-, and sixth grade regular education students whose parents had signed permission to participate. One male and one female were selected from each classroom. Certified psychometrists administered two self-concept instruments and one anxiety measure to the students in their regularly assigned buildings, Order of test administration was counterbalanced among buildings, Each teacher completed two behavioral ratings of self-concept and one behavioral rating of anxiety on the male and female selected from his or her classroom, Order of completion was counterbalanced among teachers. A multitrait-multimethod analysis was conducted to determine cross-structural validity. Four different correlations were analyzed: (1) monotrait-monomethod, (2) heteromethod-monotrait, (3) heterotrait-monomethod, and (4) heterotrait-heteromethod. The. 01 level was used to establish statistical significance of the correlations. Results of this study demonstrated that there is little cross-structural validity between the self-report measures and behavioral rating forms used: 1. The common factor variance was not sufficient enough to consider the methods comparable in spite of the fact that there was a statistically significant relationship between self-report measures and behavioral ratings of self-concept. 2. Method variance contributed to the substantial concurrent validity between the Children's Self-Concept Scale and the Self-Esteem <b>Inventory.</b> Similarly, method <b>variance</b> contributed to the substantial concurrent validity between the Inferred Self-Concept Scale and the Behavior Rating Form. 3, High negative correlations between self-concept and anxiety within each method suggested that self-concept and anxiety share enough common method variance to disallow the use of anxiety as a totally distinct trait. 4, Self-reports and behavioral ratings may each measure a different aspect of self-concept [...] the experienced and the presented. Therefore, a combination of the two methods might yield a more global assessment of self-concept. Department of Educational PsychologyThesis (D. Ed. ...|$|R
40|$|A {{major cause}} of supply chain {{deficiencies}} is the bullwhip effect. This effect refers to the tendency of the variance of the replenishment orders to increase as one moves up a supply chain. Supply chain managers experience this variance amplification in both inventory levels and replenishment orders. As a result, companies face shortages or bloated inventories, run-away transportation and warehousing costs and major production adjustment costs. In this article we analyze a {{major cause of}} the bullwhip effect and suggest a remedy. We focus on a unique replenishment rule that is able to reduce the bullwhip effect. In general, bullwhip reduction may {{have a negative impact on}} customer service due to <b>inventory</b> <b>variance</b> increases. Our analysis shows that bullwhip can be satisfactorily managed without unduly increasing stock levels to maintain target fill rates. ...|$|E
