40|$|The {{political}} {{transformation in}} Indonesia, followed by administrative decentralisation through {{the provision of}} regional autonomy, has had catastrophic consequences. The decentralisation of <b>forest</b> <b>resource</b> governance and management has engendered a parallel decentralisation of moral hazards such as opportunistic behaviour, abuse of power and uncontrolled markets. Forestry sector policies neither facilitate nor support community-based <b>forest</b> <b>resource</b> management, nor <b>forest</b> conservation and restoration. This paper analyses the current situation in <b>forest</b> <b>resource</b> exploitation from institutional perspectives. The analysis is based on case studies from two sites in Indonesia and consultation with stakeholders in various hierarchies. It identifies key points that institutions should observe in the decentralisation process to secure better performance or outcomes in <b>forest</b> <b>resource</b> management. In addition to removing institutional constraints, {{it is argued that}} policies need to be redesigned. This paper concludes with recommendations to remove institutional constraints and to redesigning policies...|$|R

Mastering the basic status of <b>forest</b> <b>resource</b> provides effective basis for <b>forest</b> <b>resource’s</b> scientific management. Nowadays {{the concept of}} “Digital Forestry” is put forward and 3 S technology is used in forestry.  Therefore the   embedded system of <b>forest</b> <b>resource</b> information acquisition has been designed which integrated embedded technology with GIS, 3 G wireless communication technology and GPS. After analyzing the requirement of forestry resource, the overall structure has been established and the system has been developed by using the advanced demo-board OMAP 3530. There are  six functions including system login, data acquisition, data manage, map operation, GPS positioning and navigation, temperature and humidity measuring to enhance working efficiency, reduce power consumption and get real-time data. On the building Qt/Embedded platform, the upper application program interface is designed. Linux system and applications are successful transplanted. Adopting GPS technology, real-time positioning, navigation and latitude and longitude display functions are achieved. At the same time, the collected small class survey data and temperature and humidity data can be saved; the data can be uploaded and downloaded by using 3 G module from internet.

40|$|In {{order to}} examine the trend and impact of {{relationship}} between growth of <b>forest</b> <b>resource</b> and population in West Bengal, a province of India, in the time series data for every ten-year from 1901 - 1991 {{this study suggests that}} the increase of population to forest land in West Bengal is alarming, because the ability of the forest to satisfy the demands is limited by the extent of <b>forest</b> <b>resource</b> of the state. The increasing population in West Bengal makes a negative impact on the forest. Though this impact is not highly significant at present, the long run relationship between density of population and forest area leads to substantial damage of the <b>forest</b> <b>resource</b> causing acute environmental problem of the state in future. Similarly, soil erosion, which is the only natural factor to damage <b>forest</b> <b>resource</b> in West Bengal, has some significant effect, though not highly.
