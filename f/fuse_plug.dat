25|$|A {{spillway}} is {{a section}} of a dam designed to pass water from the upstream side of a dam to the downstream side. Many spillways have floodgates designed to control the flow through the spillway. There are several types of spillway. A service spillway or primary spillway passes normal flow. An auxiliary spillway releases flow {{in excess of the}} capacity of the service spillway. An emergency spillway is designed for extreme conditions, such as a serious malfunction of the service spillway. A <b>fuse</b> <b>plug</b> spillway is a low embankment designed to be overtopped and washed away {{in the event of a}} large flood. The elements of a <b>fuse</b> <b>plug</b> are independent free-standing blocks, set side by side which work without any remote control. They allow increasing the normal pool of the dam without compromising the security of the dam because they are designed to be gradually evacuated for exceptional events. They work as fixed weirs at times by allowing over-flow for common floods.|$|E

2500|$|Even {{before its}} authorization, the Birds Point-New Madrid Floodway {{was the subject}} of controversy. In June 1927, President Calvin Coolidge {{instructed}} the Mississippi River Commission and the Corps of Engineers to develop a plan to protect the Mississippi alluvial valley from future floods. The Commission recommended four floodways below the mouth of the Arkansas River and, above, stronger and higher levees set back from the channel. Chief of Engineers Maj. Gen. Edgar Jadwin rejected the costly plan and submitted one of his own. Jadwin's plan included the Birds Point-New Madrid floodway with a setback levee between [...] and [...] miles from the existing mainline levee. Eleven miles of the mainline levee were to be lowered by [...] to create a <b>fuse</b> <b>plug</b> levee. At a flood stage of [...] on the Cairo gage, the levee would overtop and creavasse to divert water to the floodway.|$|E

5000|$|The {{principle}} {{behind the}} <b>fuse</b> <b>plug</b> {{is that the}} majority of water that overflows a dam's spillway can be safely dammed except in high flood conditions. The <b>fuse</b> <b>plug</b> may be a sand-filled container, a steel structure or a concrete block. Under normal flow conditions the water will spill over the <b>fuse</b> <b>plug</b> and down the spillway. In high flood conditions, where the water velocity may be so high that the dam itself may be put in danger, the <b>fuse</b> <b>plug</b> simply washes away, and the flood waters safely spill over the dam.|$|E
50|$|In an {{intermediate}} type, normal level {{regulation of the}} reservoir {{is controlled by the}} mechanical gates. If inflow to the reservoir exceeds the gate's capacity, an artificial channel called either an auxiliary or emergency spillway that is blocked by a <b>fuse</b> <b>plug</b> dike will operate. The <b>fuse</b> <b>plug</b> is designed to over-top and wash out in case of a large flood, greater than the discharge capacity of the spillway gates. Although it may take many months to restore the <b>fuse</b> <b>plug</b> and channel after such an operation, the total damage and cost to repair is less than if the main water-retaining structures had been overtopped. The <b>fuse</b> <b>plug</b> concept is used where it would be very costly to build a spillway with capacity for the probable maximum flood.|$|E

40|$|This study {{aimed to}} {{evaluate}} Gated Spillways and <b>Fuse</b> <b>Plugs</b> {{from an economic}} perspective. Life Cycle Cost Analysis was carried out for both these alternatives. A literature review was carried out {{to know more about}} the hydropower plants at Fortum. Various methodologies for Life Cycle Cost Analysis were investigated. Also a study was carried out to identify the Gated Spillways and <b>Fuse</b> <b>Plugs</b> to be investigated. Various costs associated with them were also identified. Data was collected from the archives at Fortum and also via communication with experts. The deterministic analysis of data was carried out using a model built in Excel. Also probabilistic analysis of the data was carried out using Monte Carlo Simulation. The final results showed that <b>Fuse</b> <b>Plugs</b> are cheaper than Gated Spillways. Also for Gated Spillways, the initial costs are higher than the various other costs throughout its lifetime. The Civil costs are also higher as compared to Mechanical, Electrical and other Miscellaneous costs...|$|R
5000|$|The Electrical Installations Committee {{which was}} convened in 1942 {{as part of}} the Post War Building Studies {{programme}} determined, amongst other things, that the ring final circuit offered a more efficient and lower cost system which would safely support a greater number of sockets. [...] The scheme was specified to use 13 A socket-outlets and <b>fused</b> <b>plugs,</b> several designs for the plugs and sockets were considered. The design chosen as the British Standard was the flat pin system now known as BS 1363. Other designs of 13 A <b>fused</b> <b>plugs</b> and socket-outlets, notably the Wylex and Dorman & Smith systems, which did not conform to the chosen standard were used into the 1950s, but by the 1960s BS 1363 had become the single standard for new installations.|$|R

50|$|In 2007, it {{was decided}} the dam would need an upgrade for safety reasons. The 70 million upgrade is {{expected}} to be completed during 2013 and Stage One involves the construction of a four-bay, 250 m-wide, <b>fuse</b> <b>plug</b> spillway at Diamond Bay to enable the dam to safely pass extreme floods. Once the <b>fuse</b> <b>plug</b> is installed the dam wall will be raised and the spillway gate modified.|$|E
50|$|The {{regulation}} requires all {{socket outlet}} units {{to comply with}} the requirements of BS 1363-2 Specification for 13A switched and unswitched socket-outlets and with the requirements of BS 5733 Specification for General requirements for electrical accessories. Sockets and socket outlets do not require independent approval under the regulations. Any plug fitted to the socket outlet unit must comply with the requirements of BS 1363-1 Specification for rewirable and non-rewirable 13A <b>fused</b> <b>plugs.</b> Plugs must also be independently approved and marked in accordance with the requirements of the regulation.|$|R
50|$|Floodgates and <b>fuse</b> <b>plugs</b> may be {{designed}} into spillways to regulate water flow and reservoir level. Such a spillway {{can be used}} to regulate downstream flows - by releasing water in small amounts before the reservoir is full, operators can prevent sudden large releases that would happen if the dam were overtopped.|$|R

50|$|The Barrage located 7 km {{downstream}} of Tarbela Dam, {{provides a}} pond which re-regulates the daily discharge from Tarbela by diverting the {{flow into the}} Power Channel, adding compensation water during the low flow seasons.

5000|$|In {{the design}} of a {{spillway}} for a dam, a <b>fuse</b> <b>plug</b> is a water retaining structure designed to wash out in a controlled fashion if the main dam is in danger of overtopping due to flood, and if the normal spillway channel is insufficient to control the over topping.|$|E

50|$|Ring {{circuits}} {{are commonly}} used in British wiring with socket-outlets taking <b>fused</b> <b>plugs</b> to BS 1363. Because the breaker rating {{is much higher than}} that of any one socket outlet, the system can only be used with <b>fused</b> <b>plugs</b> or <b>fused</b> appliance outlets. They are generally wired with 2.5 mm2 cable and protected by a 32 A fuse, an older 30 A circuit breaker, or a European harmonised 32 A circuit breaker. Sometimes 4 mm2 cable is used if very long cable runs (to help reduce volt-drop) or derating factors such as very thick thermal insulation are involved. 1.5 mm2 mineral-insulated copper-clad cable (known as pyro) may also be used (as mineral insulated cable can withstand heat more effectively than normal PVC) though more care must be taken with regard to voltage drop on longer runs. The protection devices for the fixed wiring need to be rated higher than would protect flexible appliance cords, so BS 1363 requires that all plugs and connection units incorporate fuses appropriate to the appliance cord.|$|R
50|$|UK {{electrical}} wiring standards are largely harmonised with the regulations in other European {{countries and the}} international IEC 60446 standard. However {{there are a number}} of specific national practices, habits and traditions that differ significantly from other countries, and which in some cases survived harmonisation. These include the use of ring circuits for domestic and light commercial fixed wiring, <b>fused</b> <b>plugs,</b> and for circuits installed prior to harmonisation, historically unique wiring colours.|$|R
