40|$|At your request, we {{examined}} methods for estimating {{the size and}} flow of the illegal alien population in the United States.

40|$|In this {{introduction}} we {{will avoid}} laboring over {{a definition of}} the “Economics of Religion & Culture,” but this will not stop us from arguing {{that it is a}} burgeoning area of research. Work focusing on religious practice and related cultural <b>issues</b> <b>dates</b> back <b>at</b> least to Adam Smith, but until the 1990 s there had been little published by mainstream economists in this area. Recently, however, a variety of subfields in economics have taken up work here. The JEL classification code system includes a designation for papers on religion (Z 12), and the American Economic Association (via EconLit) keeps track of the number of journal articles published under this section of the code. In Fig. 1, we show the number of papers published in this area in recent years. As the picture shows, there has been a sixfold increase in the total number of papers published in this area over the past decade, including a number of truly excellent works. Some of the topics considered here include: studies of how public policy affects attitudes and beliefs, studies on the lasting economic implications of historic cultural institutions, work on religious schooling versus secular schooling, investigations of faith-based social-service provision, work on violence and religious extremism, analyses of religious donations, and research on the connection between beliefs (such as religious beliefs) and behaviors...|$|R

40|$|Any {{survey of}} {{contributions}} to economic analysis in India, even though {{confined to the}} post-war years and to issues arising from domestic economic events and policy, runs into exceptional difficulties. Not only has practically every conceivable problem been raised and discussed by economists, {{in a country where}} interest in economic <b>issues</b> <b>dates</b> back <b>at</b> least to {{the latter half of the}} 19 th century but there have also been numerous committees and commissions. The Survey does not extend to the growing number of contributions to general theoretical economic analysis that Indian economists have begun to make, as is evident from the contents of reputed journals in the last decade. This Survey, therefore, is neither a comprehensive account of the state of economic research in the country nor does it pretend to give an exhaustive picture of the policy issues that have been discussed on the Indian scene since 1947 when India gained independence. The Survey is broadly divided into three areas i. e. planning theory and techniques, agriculture and foreign trade. The vast majority of India's policy issues and analytical literature, fall within one or more of these categories. Because agriculture is the overwhelmingly important economic activity in the economy and its capacity to act as a significant brake on growth via its role as the supplier of wage goods to other sectors has been increasingly appreciated, this sector has also attracted considerable economic analysis...|$|R
