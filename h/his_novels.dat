5|$|When he {{developed}} his scheme for organizing all of <b>his</b> <b>novels</b> and stories {{into a single}} sequence called La Comédie humaine, Balzac placed La Peau de chagrin {{at the start of}} the section called Études philosophiques ("Philosophical Studies"). Like the other works in this category– including the similarly autobiographical Louis Lambert (1832)– it deals with philosophy and the supernatural. But it also provides a bridge to the realism of the Études des mœurs ("Study of Manners"), where the majority of <b>his</b> <b>novels</b> were located.|$|E
5|$|He {{continued}} by thanking his cast, especially Anne Oldfield, for {{the effort}} that they put into their roles. This preface served {{as a model for}} Fielding's later prefaces included in <b>his</b> <b>novels,</b> such as Joseph Andrews or Tom Jones.|$|E
5|$|Novelist {{and critic}} Barbara Mujica {{comments}} that the book's English translator, Edith Grossman, fully captures the multiple levels of {{meaning of the}} text, as well as García Márquez's modulations in tone.

5|$|The writer Evelyn Waugh {{spent his}} last {{years in the}} village of Combe Florey. The novelist John Cowper Powys (1872–1963) lived in the Somerset village of Montacute from 1885 until 1894 and <b>his</b> <b>novels</b> Wood and Stone (1915) and A Glastonbury Romance (1932) are set in Somerset.|$|E
5|$|A {{self-described}} anarchist, Baker {{has been}} categorized {{as a writer}} of transgressional fiction, in that <b>his</b> <b>novels</b> are frequently populated by sociopathic, nihilistic characters who engage in taboo behaviors such as heavy drug use, incest, necrophilia and other practices; and often commit acts of extreme, surrealistic violence. A man of eclectic tastes, Baker cited as literary influences writers and film directors ranging from Proust to Jim Thompson and Sam Peckinpah. He also admired the punk writer Dennis Cooper.|$|E
5|$|Although Fleming did not {{date the}} event within <b>his</b> <b>novels,</b> John Griswold and Henry Chancellor—both of whom wrote books for Ian Fleming Publications—have {{identified}} different timelines based on events and situations within the novel series as a whole. Chancellor put {{the events of}} Dr. No in 1956; Griswold is more precise, and considers the story {{to have taken place}} in February and March of that year.|$|E

5|$|Although Fleming {{provided}} no dates within <b>his</b> <b>novels,</b> two writers have identified different timelines based on events and situations within the novel series as a whole. John Griswold and Henry Chancellor—both {{of whom have}} written books on behalf of Ian Fleming Publications—put the events of Casino Royale in 1951; Griswold allows a possible second timeframe and considers the story could {{have taken place in}} either May to July 1951, or May to July 1952.|$|E

5|$|As the {{publication}} date neared, difficulties arose. In January 1869, Dallas asked Trollope {{for permission to}} defer serial publication by three months. As Trollope had agreed not to allow another of <b>his</b> <b>novels</b> to run serially {{during the first six}} months of The Vicars career, the editor's request would have diminished the author's income. Trollope initially refused, but subsequently agreed to a delay of two months, with publication to begin in early July.|$|E

5|$|At {{the start}} of the nineteenth century, the works of Sir Walter Scott were best-sellers in France. <b>His</b> <b>novels</b> {{captured}} {{the ebb and flow of}} society, and he demonstrated the far-reaching impact of major historical changes. A slew of authors in France attempted to replicate Scott's success, but their works were isolated from one another and divorced from their surroundings.|$|E
5|$|Before Fowles {{published}} The French Lieutenant's Woman in 1969, he {{had already}} established his literary reputation with <b>his</b> <b>novels</b> The Collector (1963) and The Magus (1965). While writing The French Lieutenant's Woman, {{he was working on}} the screenplay for the film adaptation of The Magus. Moreover, The Collector had already been adapted in a 1965 film that gained Fowles further popular attention.|$|E
5|$|In January 1964 Fleming went to Goldeneye {{for what}} {{proved to be}} his last holiday and wrote {{the first draft of}} The Man with the Golden Gun. He was {{dissatisfied}} with it and wrote to William Plomer, the copy editor of <b>his</b> <b>novels,</b> asking for it to be rewritten. Fleming became increasingly unhappy with the book and considered rewriting it, but was dissuaded by Plomer, who considered it viable for publication.|$|E

In 2003, <b>his</b> <b>novel</b> Eine Billion Dollar was adapted for German radio. <b>His</b> only <b>novels</b> {{translated}} into English was Die Haarteppichknüpfer, published in 2005 as The Carpet Makers, and Herr aller Dinge, published in 2014 as Lord of All Things.|$|R

5|$|Many of <b>his</b> <b>novels</b> were {{initially}} serialized, {{like those of}} Dickens. Their length was not predetermined. Illusions Perdues extends to a thousand pages after starting inauspiciously in a small-town print shop, whereas La Fille aux yeux d'or (The Girl with the Golden Eyes, 1835) opens with a broad panorama of Paris but becomes a closely plotted novella of only fifty pages.|$|E
5|$|Although most of Wodehouse's {{fiction is}} set in England, {{he spent much of}} his life in the US and used New York and Hollywood as {{settings}} for some of <b>his</b> <b>novels</b> and short stories. During and after the First World War, together with Guy Bolton and Jerome Kern, he wrote a series of Broadway musical comedies that were {{an important part of the}} development of the American musical. He began the 1930s writing for MGM in Hollywood. In a 1931 interview, his naïve revelations of incompetence and extravagance in the studios caused a furore. In the same decade, his literary career reached a new peak.|$|E
5|$|As {{with many}} of <b>his</b> <b>novels,</b> Balzac {{analyzes}} the influence of history and social status in La Cousine Bette. The book takes places between 1838 and 1846, when the reign of Louis-Philippe reflected and directed {{significant changes in the}} social structure. Balzac was a legitimist favoring the House of Bourbon, and idolized Napoleon Bonaparte as a paragon of effective absolutist power. Balzac felt that French society under the House of Orléans lacked strong leadership, and was fragmented by the demands of parliament. He also believed that Catholicism provided guidance for the nation, and that its absence heralded moral decay.|$|E

50|$|Acclaimed {{by fellow}} writers in his day, Saltus fell into obscurity after <b>his</b> death. <b>His</b> <b>novel</b> The Paliser Case was adapted to film in 1920, and <b>his</b> <b>novel</b> Daughters of the Rich was filmed in 1923.|$|R
5|$|Balzac's {{work habits}} are legendary, he wrote from 1 am to 8 am {{every night and}} {{sometimes}} even longer. Balzac could write very rapidly; some of <b>his</b> <b>novels,</b> written with a quill, were composed at a pace equal to thirty words per minute on a modern typewriter. His preferred method was to eat a light meal at five or six in the afternoon, then sleep until midnight. He then rose and wrote for many hours, fueled by innumerable cups of black coffee. He would often work for fifteen hours or more at a stretch; {{he claimed to have}} once worked for 48 hours with only three hours of rest in the middle.|$|E
5|$|Drizzt Do'Urden's {{stories are}} set in the Forgotten Realms {{campaign}} setting for Dungeons & Dragons. The character has been a mainstay for author R. A. Salvatore, appearing in <b>his</b> <b>novels</b> for over 20 years. Drizzt is a drow who acts against the drow stereotype, favoring friendship and peace over hatred and violence. His unusual personality creates the conflict that allows Salvatore to create so many novels with stories about courage and friendship. Drizzt fights the dark traits that are inherent in the drow.|$|E
5|$|For the post-Fleming {{continuation}} Bond authors, Leiter {{has also}} {{appeared on a}} periodic basis. After John Gardner took over writing the James Bond novel series, Leiter made an occasional appearance and the novel For Special Services introduces his daughter, Cedar Leiter, {{who is also a}} CIA officer (and briefly Bond's romantic conquest). Raymond Benson also included Leiter's character in some of <b>his</b> <b>novels,</b> including The Facts of Death and Doubleshot. Similarly the more recent continuation Bond novels—the 2008 Sebastian Faulks novel Devil May Care and the 2011 novel Carte Blanche by Jeffery Deaver—both contained the character.|$|E
