5|$|One of {{the most}} {{recognizable}} characteristic of Noh stage is its independent roof that <b>hangs</b> <b>over</b> the stage even in indoor theatres. Supported by four columns, the roof symbolizes {{the sanctity of the}} stage, with its architectural design derived from the worship pavilion (haiden) or sacred dance pavilion (kagura-den) of Shinto shrines. The roof also unifies the theatre space and defines the stage as an architectural entity.|$|E

In 1980, with the downgrading of political ideology following Mao's death, the portraits were taken down and thenceforth only brought out on Labor Day (May 1) and National Day. In 1988, the CCP leadership decided to display only the portraits of Sun and Mao on national holidays.|$|E
25|$|Commissioner of the Police Andy Tsang {{confirmed}} the unprecedented {{challenges to the}} police posed by the occupations, and that as at 15 December a total of 955 individuals had been arrested, 221 activists had been hurt, and that 130 police officers had received light injuries.

25|$|Another version tells {{that two}} Sioux boys wandered {{far from their}} village when Mato the bear, a huge {{creature}} that had claws the size of tipi poles, spotted them, and wanted to eat them for breakfast. He was almost upon them when the boys prayed to Wakan Tanka the Creator to help them. They rose up on a huge rock, while Mato {{tried to get up}} from every side, leaving huge scratch marks as he did. Finally, he sauntered off, disappointed and discouraged. The bear came to rest east of the Black Hills at what is now Bear Butte. Wanblee, the eagle, helped the boys off the rock and back to their village. A painting depicting this legend by artist Herbert A. Collins <b>hangs</b> <b>over</b> the fireplace in the visitor's center at Devils Tower.|$|E
25|$|St. Paul's Chapel in New York City {{has a large}} oil {{painting}} of the national coat of arms, believed installed sometime in 1786. It was commissioned on October 7, 1785, {{not long after the}} Congress of the Confederation began meeting in nearby Federal Hall. The painting <b>hangs</b> <b>over</b> Washington's pew, across the room from a painting of the arms of New York over the Governor's pew. The painting has many similarities to Trenchard's version (or vice versa depending on which came first), including the random placement of stars and details of the eagle. The clouds are in a full circle, though, instead of an arc, and the rays extend beyond them in all directions. The shield has a gold chain border with a badge at the bottom. This is the earliest known full-color version of the seal design, and the artist is unknown.|$|E
25|$|Near that temple is a {{very large}} tree with {{widespread}} branches which are always green both in winter and summer. What kind of tree it is nobody knows. There is also a spring there where the pagan are accustomed to perform sacrifices and to immerse a human being alive. As long as his body is not found, the request of the people will be fulfilled. A golden chain encircles that temple and <b>hangs</b> <b>over</b> the gables of the building. Those who approach see its gleam from afar off because the shrine, which is located on a plain, is encircled by mountains so situated as to give the effect of a theatre. For nine days feasts and sacrifices of this kind are celebrated. Every day they sacrifice one human being in addition to other animals, so that in nine days there are 72 victims which are sacrificed. This sacrifice takes place about the time of the vernal equinox.|$|E

25|$|Dol Guldur is {{depicted}} in Peter Jackson's 2012-2014 film trilogy adaptation of The Hobbit. The first installment, , shows Dol Guldur as a massive castle in ruins, heavily overgrown with menacing brambles and thorny trees, situated on a hill. It is visited by the wizard Radagast, who has a brief skirmish with {{the shade of the}} Witch-king of Angmar, before encountering the Necromancer and then fleeing to tell Gandalf what he has discovered. The second part of the trilogy, , depicts Gandalf himself entering Dol Guldur, where he discerns that a spell of illusion <b>hangs</b> <b>over</b> the entire fortress, making it appear abandoned even though a growing army of Orcs is amassing there. Gandalf encounters the Necromancer and engages in a magical duel with him, but is ultimately overpowered when the Necromancer unveils his true strength and identity as Sauron. In the third film, , Galadriel, Elrond and Saruman enter Dol Guldur, where they rescue the wounded Gandalf, and battle the Nazgûl. Radagast takes Gandalf out of Dol Guldur to recover, and Galadriel uses her power to force Sauron out of Dol Guldur.|$|E
25|$|A stair {{carpet in}} a shade of red {{has been used}} since the {{administration}} of Theodore Roosevelt. During the Kennedy restoration, the carpet was made deeper, more crimson. A mahogany pier table with gilded caryatid supports attributed to New York cabinetmaker Charles-Honoré Lannuier {{is located at the}} bottom of the stair. Portraits of 20th century presidents and first ladies hang on the walls. An English cut crystal chandelier of the mid-19th century <b>hangs</b> <b>over</b> the first landing. In 1998 Hillary Clinton working with then Curator of the White House Betty Monkman refurbished the Grand Staircase. A new carpet for the Grand Staircase and the Cross Hall was designed incorporating a border of laurel leaves and five pointed stars within a circle, a motif found in Winslow's carved marble Truman era string course entablature and in the balusters of the Grand Staircase. A more vivid red was selected, and several shaded of yellow gold. New swag and jabot drapery in the same red and yellow-gold colors were made for the staircase and Entrance Hall.|$|E
25|$|The longstanding estate {{battle of}} Jarndyce v Jarndyce <b>hangs</b> <b>over</b> {{the heads of}} many {{conflicting}} heirs, confused by multiple wills. Possible beneficiary John Jarndyce of Bleak House welcomes orphaned cousins Ada Clare and Richard Carstone — also potential heirs — as his wards, and has hired Esther Summerson as a housekeeper and companion for Ada. Lady Honoria Dedlock, married to the imperious baronet Sir Leicester, is also a possible beneficiary of the estate. The Dedlocks' lawyer, Tulkinghorn, sniffs out a connection between Lady Dedlock and a newly deceased man called Nemo; {{as he tries to}} discover Nemo's true identity, Lady Dedlock secretly seeks information about the dead man herself. Meanwhile, Richard and Ada are falling in love. Richard keeps changing his mind on which career to pursue — first a physician, then a lawyer and then a soldier — but the prospect of his inheritance from the ongoing litigation begins to consume him, despite warnings from John, now his former guardian. Esther and the young doctor Allan Woodcourt are attracted to each other, but Esther feels unworthy and Allan accepts a commission as a navy physician.|$|E
