500|$|The novelization {{was written}} by Hank Searls, who also adapted Jaws 2. While Searls' Jaws 2 novelization {{was based on an}} earlier draft of that film and was {{significantly}} different from the finished film, his Jaws: The Revenge novelization sticks fairly close to the final film, although it does contain some extra subplots. The novel contains a subplot in which Hoagie is a government agent and he transports laundered money. The only reference to this in the film is when Michael Brody asks [...] "What <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>do</b> <b>when</b> you’re not flying people?" [...] to which Hoagie replies, [...] "I deliver laundry." [...] In Searls' novel, the character of Jake is ultimately killed by the shark; Jake was originally supposed to die in the film, but the script was changed to allow him to survive.|$|E
500|$|... "Walk Away" [...] is a piano-driven waltz ballad. Written {{in the key}} of G major, it is a downtempo song, with a {{moderate}} slow and bluesy tempo of 52 beats per minute. It {{is followed by a}} chord progression of EmC7 in the verses. Aguilera's vocal range on the song span nearly two octaves, from the low-note of C3 to the high-note of G5. In the track, Aguilera uses a [...] "sultry lower range". Lyrically, [...] "Walk Away" [...] is about an abusive relationship, where she uses a [...] "clever" [...] metaphor. At the song's beginning, the lyrics [...] "What <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>do,</b> <b>when</b> you know something's bad for you, and you still can't let go?" [...] are spoken by Aguilera. In the first verse, she sings, [...] "Your love was like candy/ Artificially sweet, I was deceived by your wrapping". The track was described as a non-sense song by Amanda Murray for Sputnikmusic.|$|E

6000|$|... "What <b>did</b> <b>you</b> <b>do</b> <b>when</b> mornin' came an' I {{failed to}} show up?" [...] Kenton asked, whereupon I replied quickly, {{thinking}} that the present {{was by far the}} best time I would ever have in which to acknowledge my fault.|$|R
6000|$|... "You {{certainly}} do not," [...] said Mrs. Byron, whimsically--"although {{you have a}} certain odious professional air, too. What <b>did</b> <b>you</b> <b>do</b> <b>when</b> <b>you</b> ran away so scandalously from that stupid school in the north? How <b>do</b> <b>you</b> earn your living?

2500|$|Coping Strategies Index (CSI) – assesses {{household}} behaviours {{and rates}} them {{based on a}} set of varied established behaviours on how households cope with food shortages.

2500|$|.....We {{had to do}} {{the whole}} movie in 16 weeks. It was a massive undertaking. That was not fair to the movie. I would redo the entire third act if I could. But the studio {{literally}} took the movie away from us. It was terrible. My visual effects supervisor had a nervous breakdown, so I had {{to be in charge of}} that. I called James Cameron and asked [...] "What <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>do</b> <b>when</b> you're doing all the effects yourself?" [...] But the movie did fine.|$|E
2500|$|Alistair Lawrence from BBC Music {{criticized the}} album saying that [...] "once {{the novelty of}} the squelching, space-aged din they’ve birthed fades, what’s {{apparent}} is how little Korn have to say for themselves these days". Sputnikmusic strongly criticized the album giving it a score of 0.5/5 stating that [...] "The Path Of Totality is a truly horrible album, built on a foundation of tired and overwrought stereotypes put together not by just a clueless band, but a bunch of equally confused artists who truly have no proper understanding of the genre they {{claim to be a}} part of". No Ripcord gave the album a 1/10 stating that [...] "it is samey, ugly and spectacularly stupid at the same time". Jason Heller from The A.V. Club gave the album an 'F' stating: [...] "To Korn’s credit, The Path Of Totality is its most radical reinvention to date. It’s also the worst slab of sludge it ever shat."NME gave the album a 6/10 saying that it's [...] "not quite a car crash, but a near miss" [...] and jokingly asking: [...] "What <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>do</b> <b>when</b> you’re 10 albums into your career, sliding down festival bills and trying to bury the tag of creators of a genre you now despise? If you’re Korn, you Google ‘2011 music’ and rope in a bunch of DJs for a ‘dubstep’ album, of course".|$|E

2500|$|Qualitative {{psychological}} research emphasizes fieldwork, {{and this}} emphasis {{has been offered}} as a distinguishing mark. Qualitative psychological research is also described as holistic. That is, qualitative researchers believe in studying phenomena in its context rather than concentrating on narrow aspects of the phenomena. This means that they either observe or participate in the phenomena they are studying, e.g. attending a football game to understand the behaviours of fan, and/or they ask open-ended questions about the behaviour of fans at football games. These questions are holistic because {{they are designed to}} understand the context of behaviour—they will usually follow a pattern that replicates the experience, e.g. [...] "What <b>did</b> <b>you</b> <b>do</b> <b>when</b> <b>you</b> arrived? Who <b>did</b> <b>you</b> come with? What <b>did</b> <b>you</b> <b>do</b> then?" [...] However, similar methods are used by quantitative researchers.|$|R

[...] "I {{have heard that}} Christianity keeps the key of virtue, and that if you read Tom Paine you will cut your throat at Monte Carlo. It is such rubbish that I am not even angry at it. You say that Christianity is the prop of morals; but what more <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>do?</b> <b>When</b> a doctor attends you and could poison you with a pinch of salt, do you ask whether he is a Christian? You ask whether he is a gentleman, whether he is an M.D.--anything but that. When a soldier enlists to die for his country or disgrace it, do you ask whether he is a Christian? You {{are more likely to}} ask whether he is Oxford or Cambridge at the boat race. If you think your creed {{essential}} to morals why do you not make it a test for these things?" ...|$|E
6000|$|Out of {{the vague}} of that far-off time another face and figure, as {{essentially}} New En&land as this, {{and yet so}} different, relieve themselves. Charles F. Browne, whose drollery wafted his pseudonym {{as far as the}} English speech could carry laughter, was a Westernized Yankee. He added an Ohio way of talking to the Maine way of thinking, and he so became a literary product of a rarer and stranger sort than our literature had otherwise known. He had gone from Cleveland to London, with intervals of New York and the lecture platform, four or five years before I saw him in Boston, shortly after I went there. We had met in Ohio, and he had personally explained to me the ducatless well-meaning of Vanity Fair in New York; but many men had since shaken the weary hand of Artemus Ward when I grasped it one day in front of the Tremont Temple. He did not recognize me, but he gave me at once a greeting of great impersonal cordiality, with [...] "How <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>do?</b> <b>When</b> did you come?" [...] and other questions that had no concern in them, till I began to dawn upon him through a cloud of other half remembered faces. Then he seized my hand and wrung it all over again, and repeated his friendly demands with an intonation that was now [...] "Why, how are you; how are you?" [...] for me alone. It was a bit of comedy, which had the fit pathetic relief of his impending doom: this was already stamped upon his wasted face, and his gay eyes had the death-look. His large, loose mouth was drawn, for all its laughter at the fact which he owned; his profile, which burlesqued. an eagle's, was the profile of a drooping eagle; his lank length of limb trembled away with him when we parted. I did not see him again; I scarcely heard of him till I heard of his death, and this sad image remains with me of the humorist who first gave the world a taste of the humor which characterizes the whole American people.|$|E
