5|$|The White House, the Capitol, {{and various}} other {{buildings}} were evacuated. The afternoon traffic rush hour was affected, with some traffic lights <b>inoperative,</b> and the Washington Metro system's trains operated at reduced speeds while tracks and tunnels were inspected.|$|E
5|$|Lt. Phillips {{received}} {{permission from}} his superiors {{to fly the}} F-4B with an <b>inoperative</b> transponder. As the fighter proceeded to NAS Fallon in Nevada, the oxygen leak worsened until the system was disabled completely, and the pilot was instructed to fly at low altitude. The Phantom II departed NAS Fallon at 5:16p.m. following a flight plan routing across the Fresno, Bakersfield, and Los Angeles air corridors.|$|E
5|$|During the House of Representatives {{debate on}} the report, the Minister, Larry Anthony, stated that he had already asked fuel {{companies}} to check their tanker wagons {{for the presence of}} water after each replenishment, and the relevant Air Navigation Order would be amended to require fuel to be drained into transparent containers. He stated that his Department did not intend to amend the relevant Air Navigation Order to require pilots of four-engine aeroplanes to perform the periodic checks in a four-engine aeroplane because it considered it was more challenging to fly with one engine <b>inoperative</b> in a two-engine aeroplane than in a four-engine aeroplane.|$|E
5|$|In {{those areas}} which the Red Army had {{captured}} {{and before the}} fighting in {{the centre of the}} city had stopped, the Soviet authorities took measures to start restoring essential services. Almost all transport {{in and out of the}} city had been rendered <b>inoperative,</b> and bombed-out sewers had contaminated the city's water supplies. The Soviet authorities appointed local Germans to head each city block, and organised the cleaning-up. The Red Army made a major effort to feed the residents of the city. Most Germans, both soldiers and civilians, were grateful to receive food issued at Red Army soup kitchens which began on Colonel-General Nikolai Berzarin's orders. After the capitulation the Soviets went house to house, arresting and imprisoning anyone in a uniform including firemen and railwaymen.|$|E
5|$|On November 1, 2011, LOT Polish Airlines Flight 16, a 767-300ER, safely {{landed at}} Warsaw Frederic Chopin Airport in Warsaw, Poland after a {{mechanical}} {{failure of the}} landing gear forced an emergency landing with the landing gear up. There were no injuries, but the aircraft involved was damaged and subsequently written off. At {{the time of the}} incident, aviation analysts speculated that {{it may have been the}} first instance of a complete landing gear failure in the 767's service history. Subsequent investigation determined that while a damaged hose had disabled the aircraft's primary landing gear extension system, an otherwise functional backup system was <b>inoperative</b> due to an accidentally deactivated circuit breaker.|$|E
5|$|The Apple-Cohen dispute was a {{cybersquatting}} {{case where}} a top-level domain registrar's decision differed from prior decisions by awarding a domain name to a subsequent registrant (Apple), {{rather than to the}} prior registrant (Cohen). As the decision recounts, in November 2000, Benjamin Cohen of CyberBritain registered the domain name itunes.co.uk. The domain initially pointed to skipmusic.com, and then to cyberbritain.com, and was then <b>inoperative</b> for some time. Apple applied for a UK trademark for iTunes in October 2000 which was granted in March 2001, and then launched its UK iTunes music store service in 2004. Afterward, Cohen reactivated his registered domain name, redirecting it to iTunes' then-rival, Napster; later Cohen forwarded the domain name to his CyberBritain's cash back/rewards website.|$|E
5|$|The true {{number of}} cases of carbon {{monoxide}} poisoning is unknown, since many non-lethal exposures go undetected. From the available data, carbon monoxide poisoning is {{the most common cause of}} injury and death due to poisoning worldwide. Poisoning is typically more common during the winter months. This is due to increased domestic use of gas furnaces, gas or kerosene space heaters, and kitchen stoves during the winter months, which if faulty and/or used without adequate ventilation, may produce excessive carbon monoxide. Carbon monoxide detection and poisoning also increases during power outages, when electric heating and cooking appliances become <b>inoperative</b> and residents may temporarily resort to fuel-burning space heaters, stoves, and grills (some of which are safe only for outdoor use but nonetheless are errantly burned indoors).|$|E
5|$|To {{rebuild the}} damaged {{parts of the}} site, the {{relevant}} approval from Dacorum Borough Council would be needed. The BP section of the site {{is a good way}} from the explosion and survived with very little damage, but it was <b>inoperative</b> as of 2009. BP is exploring plans for the future use of this part of the site, and has indicated a number of priorities, including the reopening of the fuel pipelines to Heathrow. It is considering using its section to store aviation fuel and as a distribution centre for motor fuel, but at a much-reduced level. In late 2009, Total UK submitted plans for the reconstruction of the oil depot. The reconstruction of the site has been taking place since March 2013.|$|E
5|$|The Smith Act trials {{decimated}} {{the leadership}} {{ranks of the}} CPUSA. Immediately after the 1949 trial, the CPUSAalarmed at the undercover informants that had testified for the prosecutioninitiated efforts to identify and exclude informers from its membership. The FBI encouraged these suspicions by planting fabricated evidence which suggested that many innocent Party members were FBI informants. Dennis attempted to provide leadership from inside the Atlanta penitentiary, but prison officials censored his mail and successfully isolated him from the outside world. Prison officials from the Lewisburg prison prevented Williamson from writing to anyone other than immediate family members. Lacking leadership, the CPUSA suffered from internal dissension and disorder, and by 1953 the CPUSA's leadership structure was <b>inoperative.</b> In 1956, Nikita Khrushchev revealed the reality of Stalin's purges, causing many remaining CPUSA members to quit in disillusionment. By the late 1950s, the CPUSA's membership had dwindled to 5,000, of whom over 1,000 may have been FBI informants.|$|E
5|$|The first storm-related {{power outages}} {{took place in}} the early {{afternoon}} on October 17 as weather conditions worsened. At the height of the storm, about 31,000 out of 36,000 electricity customers were without power, including the 1,500outages left unresolved after Fay. Backup CARILEC crews helped with specialty assignments, such as commercial outages and homes without power since before Gonzalo's onslaught. Service was not fully restored until November 3, and BELCO ultimately spent US$2.9million on system repairs after hurricanes Fay and Gonzalo. The company replaced 228utility poles, 80transformers, and over 4mi (6.5km) of wire. Other utilities, such as television and Internet services, also suffered, and technicians handled individual outages deep into the month of November. About 600streetlights on main roads and several hundred more on side-streets were <b>inoperative</b> following the hurricane; some remained unmended through January 2015.|$|E
5|$|As {{the crew}} began {{to prepare for}} arrival at Sioux City, they {{questioned}} whether they should deploy the landing gear or belly-land the aircraft with the gear retracted. They decided that having the landing gear down would provide some shock absorption on impact. The complete hydraulic failure left the landing gear lowering mechanism <b>inoperative.</b> Two options were available to the flight crew. The DC-10 is designed such that if hydraulic pressure to the landing gear is lost, the gear will fall down slightly and rest on the landing gear doors. Placing the regular landing gear handle in the down position will unlock the doors mechanically, and the doors and landing gear will then fall down into place and lock due to gravity. An alternative system is also available using a lever in the cockpit floor to cause the landing gear to fall into position. This lever has {{the added benefit of}} unlocking the outboard ailerons, which are not used in high-speed flight and are locked in a neutral position. The crew hoped that there might be some trapped hydraulic fluid in the outboard ailerons and that they might regain some use of flight controls by unlocking them. They elected to extend the gear with the alternative system. Although the gear deployed successfully, there was no change in the controllability of the aircraft.|$|E
5|$|The Indian {{independence}} movement developed {{roots in the}} city when Mahatma Gandhi established two ashrams– the Kochrab Ashram near Paldi in 1915 and the Satyagraha Ashram (now Sabarmati Ashram) {{on the banks of}} the Sabarmati in 1917– which would become centres of nationalist activities. During the mass protests against the Rowlatt Act in 1919, textile workers burned down 51 government buildings across the city in protest at a British attempt to extend wartime regulations after the First World War. In the 1920s, textile workers and teachers went on strike, demanding civil rights and better pay and working conditions. In 1930, Gandhi initiated the Salt Satyagraha from Ahmedabad by embarking from his ashram on the Dandi Salt March. The city's administration and economic institutions were rendered <b>inoperative</b> in the early 1930s by the large numbers of people who took to the streets in peaceful protests, and again in 1942 during the Quit India Movement. Following independence and the partition of India in 1947, the city was scarred by the intense communal violence that broke out between Hindus and Muslims in 1947, Ahmedabad was the focus for settlement by Hindu migrants from Pakistan, who expanded the city's population and transformed its demographics and economy.|$|E
5|$|Wind {{tunnel and}} flight {{simulator}} {{tests were conducted}} to help to understand the trajectory of the aircraft after the engine detached and the left wing slats retracted. Those tests established that {{the damage to the}} wing's leading edge and retraction of the slats increased the stall speed of the left wing from 124 knots (143mph) to 159 knots (183mph). The DC-10 incorporates two warning devices that might have alerted the pilots to the impending stall: the slat disagreement warning light, which should have illuminated after the uncommanded retraction of the slats, and the stick shaker on the captain's control column, which activates close to the stall speed. Both of these warning devices were powered by an electric generator driven by the number one engine. Both systems became <b>inoperative</b> after the loss of that engine. The first officer's control column was not equipped with a stick shaker; the device was offered by McDonnell Douglas as an option for the first officer, but American Airlines chose not to have it installed on its DC-10 fleet. Stick shakers for both pilots became mandatory in response to this accident.|$|E
25|$|To {{that end}} Section 12(1)(b) of the Indian Act, the Judge concludes, is not <b>inoperative</b> {{in the face}} of the Canadian Bill of Rights.|$|E
25|$|No {{mechanical}} defects, {{other than}} the <b>inoperative</b> fuel pump, were reported. The aircraft {{was found to be}} in a high nose-up attitude at impact.|$|E
25|$|Due to the {{inherent}} risks of operating at {{or close to}} VMCa with asymmetric thrust, {{and the desire to}} simulate and practise these manoeuvres in pilot training and certification VSSE may be defined. VSSE safe single-engine speed is the minimum speed to intentionally render the critical engine <b>inoperative,</b> established and designated by the manufacturer as the safe, intentional, one engine <b>inoperative</b> speed. This speed is selected to reduce the accident potential from loss of control due to simulated engine failures at inordinately slow airspeed.|$|E
25|$|All the seismographs {{close to}} Clark Air Base had been {{rendered}} completely <b>inoperative</b> by 14:30, mostly by super-massive pyroclastic surges. Intense atmospheric pressure variation was also recorded.|$|E
25|$|But where a {{judicial}} officer acts {{in a manner}} that precludes all resort to appellate or other judicial remedies that otherwise would be available, the underlying assumption of the Bradley doctrine is <b>inoperative.</b>|$|E
25|$|Being of {{the opinion}} that the Court could not apply the Indian Act in the case at bar without {{infringing}} the appellant's rights under the Canadian Bill of Rights, Justice Thurlow declared the impugned provision <b>inoperative.</b>|$|E
25|$|Loss {{of engine}} power of wing mount {{propellor}} aircraft and blown lift aircraft affects the lift distribution over the wing, causing a roll toward the <b>inoperative</b> engine. In some aircraft roll authority is more limiting than rudder authority in determining VMCs.|$|E
25|$|The {{vertical}} tail or vertical stabilizer of a multi-engine aircraft plays {{a crucial role}} in maintaining directional control while an engine fails or is <b>inoperative.</b> The larger the tail, the more capable it will be of providing the required force to counteract the asymmetrical thrust yawing moment. This means that the smaller the tail is, the higher the VMCA will be. However, a larger tail is more costly and harder to accommodate, and comes with other aerodynamic issues such as increased prevalence of slipstreams. Engineers designing the {{vertical tail}} must make a decision based on, amongst other factors, their budget, the weight of the aircraft, and the maximum bank angle of 5° (away from the <b>inoperative</b> engine), as stated by FAR.|$|E
25|$|Justice Johnson {{noted that}} Indians are indeed subject to more severe {{punishment}} and a broader prohibition under the Indian Act. As such, he {{held that the}} lower court was right to hold the impugned section discriminatory and hence <b>inoperative</b> under the Canadian Bill of Rights.|$|E
25|$|Three {{months after}} the first Viscount crash, the airline lost another on 14 August 1959. The Viscount (registered AP-AJE) crashed at Karachi International Airport during a pilot {{training}} flight, while attempting an overshoot with two engines <b>inoperative.</b> Two of the three people on board were killed.|$|E
25|$|Intermediate cars of {{the most}} common type, {{numbered}} in the 63xx series, were semi-permanently coupled in pairs at their (again <b>inoperative)</b> cab ends and marshalled {{in the middle of a}} set, their gangwayed ends being coupled to those of the control and connector cars to form a four-car consist.|$|E
25|$|Heavier {{aircraft}} are more stable and {{more resistant to}} yawing moments, and therefore have lower VMCAs. The longitudinal centre of gravity affects the VMCA as well: the further from the tail it is, the lower the minimum control speed, because the rudder {{will be able to}} provide a larger yawing moment, and so it is easier to counteract the imbalance in thrust. The lateral centre of gravity also has an effect: the nearer the <b>inoperative</b> engine it is, the larger the moment of the working engine, and so the more force the rudder has to apply. This means that if the lateral centre of gravity shifts towards the <b>inoperative</b> engine, the aircraft's VMCA will increase. The thrust of most engines depends on altitude and temperature; increasing altitude and higher temperatures decrease thrust. This means that if the air temperature is higher and the aircraft has a higher altitude, the force of the operative engine will be lower, the rudder will have to provide less counteractive force, and so the VMCA will be lower. The bank angle also influences the minimum control speed. A small bank angle away from the <b>inoperative</b> engine is required for smallest possible sideslip and therefore lower VMCA. Finally, if the P-factor of the working engine increases, then its yawing moment increases, and the aircraft's VMCA increases as a result.|$|E
25|$|Following an {{inspection}} at Runcorn, Cheshire, on 15 December 2013, Cemfjord was detained due to deficiencies found. The launch apparatus for her lifeboats was <b>inoperative</b> and her safety management {{did not meet}} the required standard. There were nine other deficiencies of a lesser nature. She was released from detention on 18 December 2013.|$|E
25|$|The raiding party {{consisted}} of two officers and eight men from No. 2 Commando, and two men of the Norwegian Armed Forces in exile {{who were part of}} the Special Operations Executive. Crossing the North Sea by submarine, on arrival in Norway they successfully attacked and sufficiently damaged the plant; it remained <b>inoperative</b> {{for the remainder of the}} war.|$|E
25|$|Contrary {{to initial}} news reports, which stated that both flight {{recorders}} {{have been successfully}} read-out, the investigation team determined that the flight recorders are non-analyzable because the CVR was <b>inoperative</b> for the past nine {{days leading up to}} the crash and the FDR was mysteriously found to have only recorded the first 14 minutes of the flight after which it stopped recording.|$|E
25|$|PRR {{was one of}} {{the first}} railroads to replace {{semaphore}} signals with position-light signals. Such signals, which featured a large round target with up to eight amber-colored lights in a circle and one in the center, could be lit in various patterns to convey different meanings, were more visible in fog, and remained effective even when one light in a row was <b>inoperative.</b>|$|E
25|$|Chief Justice Cartwright {{approached}} {{this question}} {{assuming that the}} Bill of Rights is indeed infringed by Section 94(b) of the Indian Act. He moreover noted that in Robertson he considered this question himself in his dissent, concluding that the Canadian Bill of Rights shall triumph over any inconsistency {{even to the point}} of rendering offensive legislation <b>inoperative.</b> Cartwright remarked that he is now persuaded otherwise.|$|E
25|$|When two {{opposing}} engines of aircraft with {{four or more}} engines are <b>inoperative,</b> there is no thrust asymmetry, hence there is no rudder requirement for maintaining steady straight flight; VMCAs play no role. There may be less power available to maintain flight overall, but the minimum safe control speeds remain {{the same as they}} would be for an aircraft being flown at 50% thrust on all four engines.|$|E
25|$|The {{first version}} of the Charter of the French Language {{provided}} that laws be enacted only in French. In 1979, the related provisions (articles 7 through 13) were rendered <b>inoperative</b> by a ruling of the Supreme Court of Canada in Attorney General of Quebec v. Blaikie; however, Quebec responded by re-enacting in French and in English the Charter of the French Language, leaving intact articles 7 through 13.|$|E
25|$|Angiotensin is {{involved}} in regulating aldosterone and is the core regulation. Angiotensin II acts synergistically with potassium, and the potassium feedback is virtually <b>inoperative</b> when no angiotensin II is present. A {{small portion of the}} regulation resulting from angiotensin II must take place indirectly from decreased blood flow through the liver due to constriction of capillaries. When the blood flow decreases so does the destruction of aldosterone by liver enzymes.|$|E
