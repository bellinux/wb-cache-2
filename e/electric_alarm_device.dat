50|$|The {{enuresis}} alarm methodology {{originated from}} French and German physicians {{in the first}} decade of the 20th century. Meinhard von Pfaundler, a German pediatrician made the discovery accidentally, with the original intention to create an <b>alarm</b> <b>device</b> that would notify nursing staff when a child had bed wetting and needed to be changed, showing the device to have a significant therapeutic advantages after a certain time of use. Despite early success, the treatment was not developed until the 1930s by two independent groups of psychologists: Orval Mowrer and Willie Mae Mowrer (1938) and John Morgan and Frances Witmer (1939). Mowrer used a modified Pfaundler <b>alarm</b> <b>device</b> with 30 children (ages 3-13 years) showing empirical success of the bell and pad method as a treatment for nocturnal enuresis, with the maximum time required to accomplish the treatment not exceeding two months.|$|R

40|$|Abstract—One of {{the most}} {{important}} causes of accidents is driver fatigue. To reduce the accidental rate, the driver needs a quick nap when feeling sleepy. Hence, searching for the minimum time period of nap is a very challenging problem. The {{purpose of this paper is}} twofold, i. e. to investigate the possible fastest time period for nap and its relationship with stage 2 sleep, and to develop an automatic stage 2 sleep detection and <b>alarm</b> <b>device.</b> The experiment for this investigation is designed with 21 subjects. It yields the result that waking up the subjects after getting into stage 2 sleep for 3 - 5 minutes can efficiently reduce the sleepiness. Furthermore, the automatic stage 2 sleep detection and <b>alarm</b> <b>device</b> yields the real-time detection accuracy of approximately 85 % which is comparable with the commercial sleep lab system.
