500|$|During {{the debate}} on Howe's war {{spending}} estimates in 1945 (which totalled $1.365billion), Howe answered an Opposition question on whether such a large sum could be reduced: [...] "I dare say my honourable friend could cut a million dollars from that amount, but a million dollars from the War Appropriations Bill {{would not be a}} very important matter." [...] Saskatchewan Tory MP John Diefenbaker spoke the following day, and alleged that Howe had said, [...] "We may save a million dollars, but what of it?" [...] Howe angrily denied the quote, accusing Diefenbaker of being [...] "a past master of distortion"—language he was forced to withdraw as unparliamentary. Diefenbaker sharpened the anecdote over time, and it emerged in its final form as Howe saying, [...] "What's a million?" [...] Even Liberals who knew that Howe had made no such statement agreed that it was just the sort of thing <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>have</b> <b>said.</b> [...] In the years to come, [...] "What's a million?" [...] would be a mocking Tory attack on the Liberals, most often directed at Howe.|$|E
2500|$|A {{day after}} O'Neal was traded, Bryant re-signed with the Lakers {{for seven years}} and $136 million. Bryant said he enjoyed playing with both Jackson and O'Neal, {{and he said he}} did not {{influence}} the Lakers' decisions regarding the two. Regardless, newspapers the next day criticized Bryant for his alleged manipulation of the team. O'Neal added, [...] "When it came to my leaving, [...] could have spoken up. <b>He</b> <b>could</b> <b>have</b> <b>said</b> something. He didn't say anything." [...] Winter said, [...] " [...] left because he couldn't get what he wanted—a huge pay raise. There was no way ownership could give him what he wanted. Shaq's demands held the franchise hostage, and the way he went about it didn't please the owner too much." ...|$|E
2500|$|The {{same day}} Russia demanded his release, {{claiming}} that he was captured in the Akhalgori district of South Ossetia and taken to Tbilisi and {{that he might be}} tortured: [...] "Aleksandr Glukhov was captured by the Georgian military in South Ossetia and taken to Tbilisi. It is another information provocation by the Georgian authorities. Under physical or psychological pressure or threats, <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>have</b> <b>said</b> anything," [...] said Russian Defence Ministry spokesman Aleksandr Drobyshevsky. The soldier's mother was quoted as saying: [...] "We periodically talk on the phone and I have an impression that he cannot speak freely as somebody is next to him". On 13 February 2009 members of the pro-Kremlin youth movement Nashi gathered near the Georgian embassy demanding the return of Glukhov.|$|E
60|$|He {{would have}} {{recalled}} the words if <b>he</b> <b>could.</b> <b>He</b> <b>had</b> <b>said</b> them, however, and I took them up quickly.|$|R
60|$|Stanley nodded. In truth, he {{had noticed}} something, though what <b>he</b> <b>could</b> not <b>have</b> <b>said.</b>|$|R

2500|$|In 2004, Hagen {{delivered}} {{a speech at}} a convention of the independent Christian organisation Levende Ord, where he stated that [...] "we Christians are very much concerned with children. Jesus said, let the small children come to me. I can't understand that Muhammad could have said the same. In the case that <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>have</b> <b>said</b> the same, it would have been: Let the small children come to me, so that I can exploit them in my struggle to Islamify the world." [...] He also said that if Israel lost the fight in the Middle East, Europe would [...] "bow under to Islam," [...] if Muslim fundamentalists get it as they want. [...] "They have, {{in the same manner}} as Hitler, long ago made it clear that the long-term plan is to Islamify the world. They have come a long way, they have pierced deep into Africa, and have come a long way into Europe – and then we have to fight back." [...] He was because of the speech criticised by politicians and religious leaders within Norway. Some days later, the ambassadors of Pakistan, Indonesia, Egypt and Morocco, and chargé d'affaires of Tunisia made an unusually strong attack on Hagen in a letter in the newspaper Aftenposten.|$|E
2500|$|The {{divergence}} of and {{distinction between}} {{film and video}} games is one of Cecil's pet subjects, and his interest in cinematic techniques and technical developments would become manifest in Revolution's upcoming titles. He started to hire external talent from the TV and film trades for the big-budget production [...] (1996). Already {{in the next year}} the sequel, , was released. By the end of the nineties, when the adventure market changed, he had to change course as well. In stead of the previous games, that were point-and-click adventures, he chose to move to 3D and direct control with In Cold Blood (2000), a narrative driven adventure game with action elements. At the same time a second title, Gold and Glory: The Road to El Dorado (2000), was developed after DreamWorks's film The Road to El Dorado. As Broken Sword was originally intended to be a trilogy, a third episode was planned. Unlike In Cold Blood, that combined 3D characters with pre-rendered graphics, the third Broken Sword game, [...] (2003), became a real-time 3D adventure game, with mild action elements (such as using stealth, climbing, shimmying, and pushing objects). Initially, when he announced that Broken Sword 3 {{was going to be a}} 3D game, it caused an outcry by the fans of the series. Cecil had had no choice to adopt 3D though, for when they needed funding in the beginning of 2000, publishers had become obsessed with the idea that everything was going to be 3D. But he had always been keen to move to 3D, as it allowed more special effects and would make the game world more alive. In the same year, he decided to release Beneath a Steel Sky (and Lure of the Temptress) as freeware and the source code was given to ScummVM. The result was that millions of people played the game for free in a very wide range of devices. It would foreshadow Revolution's bright future. <b>He</b> <b>could</b> <b>have</b> <b>said</b> that as a marketing genius he planned it, but as he stated a few years later, that would have been a dreadful lie. However, some hard years were ahead for the company. Over the years it had grown into about 40 people, but the year after Broken Sword: The Sleeping Dragon one of Revolution's projects was cancelled, and he had no other option than let everyone go.|$|E

6000|$|... "Now, that's genuine," [...] said Miss Raleigh, when Locker had departed. [...] "If he had {{not felt}} every word <b>he</b> <b>said</b> <b>he</b> <b>could</b> not <b>have</b> <b>said</b> it before me." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'As foolish a {{thing as}} <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>have</b> done,' <b>said</b> Mr. Kendal, not {{impressed}} with Mr. Cavendish Dusautoy's condescension in giving chase. 'It was well poor little Maurice was not abandoned to your discretion, and his resources.' ...|$|R

6000|$|... "Nay, madam," [...] {{replied the}} attendant, not {{directly}} answering the question, [...] "he {{looked as if}} <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>have</b> <b>said</b> much more impertinent things than that, if I {{had been willing to}} hear them.--But here he comes to answer for himself." ...|$|E
60|$|What more, indeed, Lady Scatcherd, can {{any of us}} want, if only {{we could}} keep our tempers and {{feelings}} a little in abeyance? Dr Fillgrave, however, could not so keep his; and, therefore, he did want something more, though at the present moment <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>have</b> hardly <b>said</b> what.|$|R
50|$|Cambronne always denied both Rougement's {{account and}} the one-word response, stating that <b>he</b> <b>could</b> not <b>have</b> <b>said</b> such thing {{and still be}} alive.A series of letters to The Times claimed that British Colonel Hugh Halkett, {{commanding}} the 3rd Hanoverian Brigade, captured Cambronne before he made any reply.|$|R
60|$|On {{the way to}} the Tube station he {{held her}} arm tightly, but whether to impart courage or receive it <b>he</b> <b>could</b> not <b>have</b> <b>said,</b> so strung-up in spirit did he feel her. With few words {{exchanged}} they reached Whitehall. Marking their card 'Urgent,' they were received within ten minutes.|$|R
60|$|These little {{houses were}} all old, second-rate concerns; he should hope the rent {{was under a}} hundred a year; it hurt him more than <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>have</b> <b>said,</b> {{to think of a}} Forsyte--his own son living in such a place.|$|E
60|$|Weston {{looked at}} her rather curiously, though {{for the next few}} moments his lips {{remained}} set. There was a good deal <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>have</b> <b>said</b> in that connection, but he suppressed it, as he had done more than once already when similarly tempted. He felt that if he once allowed his sentiments audible expression they might run away with him.|$|E
6000|$|A pang {{went through}} Lanigan. Was Calthea jealous of Miss Mayberry on his account? The thought frightened him. If <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>have</b> <b>said</b> {{anything}} {{which would have}} convinced Calthea {{that he was on}} the point of marrying Miss Mayberry, and that therefore she might as well consider everything at an end between herself and him, he would have said it. But he merely replied: ...|$|E
6000|$|He {{had learned}} {{to look for the}} {{unexpected}} in Miss Gerald, and <b>he</b> <b>could</b> not <b>have</b> <b>said</b> that it was with surprise he now found her as capable of the emotions which the place inspired, as himself. He made sure of saying: [...] "The earthquake, you know," [...] and she responded with compassion: ...|$|R
5000|$|Bailey {{argues that}} {{according}} to Middle Eastern customs, Jesus <b>could</b> not properly <b>have</b> gestured to a crowd of men and said, [...] "Here are my brother, and sister, and mother." [...] <b>He</b> <b>could</b> only <b>have</b> <b>said</b> that to a crowd of both men and women. Therefore, the disciples standing before him were composed of men and women.|$|R
60|$|The crying of this name, {{to which}} no answer was returned, had upon James a curious effect: {{it was like}} calling for your lost dog about the streets. And the creepy feeling that it gave him, of a man missing, grated on his sense of comfort and security-on his cosiness. Though <b>he</b> <b>could</b> not <b>have</b> <b>said</b> why, {{it made him feel}} uneasy.|$|R
6000|$|... "It's {{very like}} our friend Frank Kennedy," [...] said he to himself (at least we presume so, {{for there was}} no one else within earshot to whom <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>have</b> <b>said</b> it, except the door-post, which every one knows is proverbially a deaf subject). [...] "No man in the {{settlement}} drives so furiously. I shouldn't wonder if he ran against the corner of the new fence now. Ha! just so--there he goes!" ...|$|E
6000|$|As {{he put the}} {{question}} his mind leaped {{to the line of}} demarcation between the properties at Jenkins Creek, and he racked his brains hastily to discover what <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>have</b> <b>said</b> or done at their first interview that could have been misunderstood. McLeod was one of those men in whom anger is easily increased by the exhibition of anger in others. It was therefore in a still more offensive tone that he said:-- ...|$|E
6000|$|This was {{the most}} {{provoking}} thing <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>have</b> <b>said</b> to me, for I really wanted his further importunities, that I might be prevailed with to bring out that which indeed it was like death to me to conceal; so I answered him plainly that I could not say I was glad not to be importuned, thought I could not tell how to comply. 'But come, my dear,' said I, 'what conditions will you make with me upon the opening this affair to you?' ...|$|E
60|$|Charley had once, a {{few weeks}} before the period of which we are now writing, told Norman that he had no money to pay his long arrear, and that he would leave the lodgings and shift for himself as best <b>he</b> <b>could.</b> <b>He</b> <b>had</b> <b>said</b> the same thing to Mrs. Richards, the landlady, and had gone so far as to pack up all his clothes; but his back was no sooner turned than Mrs. Richards, under Norman's orders, {{unpacked}} them all, and hid away the portmanteau. It was well for him that this was done. He had bespoken for himself a bedroom at the public-house in Norfolk Street, and had he once taken up his residence there he would have been ruined for ever.|$|R
6000|$|It {{was one of}} {{the moments}} when protest would have been trite, superfluous. And Hodder, in truth, felt {{something}} great swelling within him, something that was not himself, and yet strangely was. But just what--in view of his past strict orthodoxy and limited congregation--Mr. Engel meant, <b>he</b> <b>could</b> not <b>have</b> <b>said.</b> Had the librarian recognized, without confession on his part, the change in him? divined his future intentions? ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Oh doctor, do {{you think}} <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>have</b> been?" [...] <b>said</b> Mrs. Munger, with clasped hands. [...] "It would make me the happiest woman in the world! I'd forgive him all he's made me suffer. But you're joking now, doctor?" ...|$|R
60|$|Parkson {{turned out}} {{with the rest of}} them at half-past ten, for a walk. The night was warm for February and the waxing moon bright. Parkson fixed himself upon Lewisham and Dunkerley, to Lewisham's intense annoyance--for he had a few {{intimate}} things <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>have</b> <b>said</b> to the man of Ideas that night. Dunkerley lived north, so that the three went up Exhibition Road to High Street, Kensington. There they parted from Dunkerley, and Lewisham and Parkson turned southward again for Lewisham's new lodging in Chelsea.|$|E
60|$|Dickory, {{mindful of}} those eyes, {{told her what}} he had to tell, saying as little as {{possible}} about Major Bonnet--because, of course, all that he knew about him was mere hearsay--but dilating with much vigour upon the shameful conduct of Madam Bonnet; for the young lady ought surely to know what sort of a woman her father's wife really was, and what she might expect if she should return to her house. <b>He</b> <b>could</b> <b>have</b> <b>said</b> even more about the interview with the angry woman, but his mother's eyes were upon him.|$|E
6000|$|The girl blushed. This, {{which last}} Sunday would have set his nerves tingling, now gave him {{much the same}} feeling a man has when a dog that he owns wriggles and looks at him. He had a curious sense of power, as if <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>have</b> <b>said</b> to her, 'Come and kiss me,' {{and she would have}} come. And yet--it was strange--but there seemed another face and form in the room too; and the itch in his nerves, was it for that--or for this? He jerked his head towards the {{restaurant}} and said: [...] "You have some queer customers. Do you like this life?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I see." [...] He did not, {{but it was}} of no consequence. Then {{the thought}} of Ventnor again ousted all others. What on earth-how on earth! He searched his mind for what <b>he</b> <b>could</b> {{possibly}} <b>have</b> <b>said</b> the other night. Surely he had not {{asked him to do}} anything; certainly not given him their address. There was something very odd about it that had jolly well got to be cleared up! And he said: ...|$|R
60|$|The portly form of Mr. Crocker loomed up {{from the}} {{direction}} of the back stairs. She fixed her left eye on him piercingly. Mr. Crocker met it, and quailed. He had that consciousness of guilt which philosophers tell is the worst drawback to crime. Why this woman's gaze should disturb him so thoroughly, <b>he</b> <b>could</b> not <b>have</b> <b>said.</b> She was a perfect stranger to him. She could know nothing about him. Yet he quailed.|$|R
60|$|He {{was sitting}} up in his bed-place. He was {{progressing}} toward the world of living men; if <b>he</b> <b>could</b> hardly <b>have</b> been <b>said</b> to <b>have</b> rejoined it yet. He nodded to me his frail and bony head in a wisely mysterious assent.|$|R
