25|$|These {{plans were}} {{subsequently}} advanced at the Central Committee's Eighth Plenum (Fifth Congress) in June 1985. Acting to disperse economic decision making, the plenum resolved to grant production autonomy {{at the factory}} and <b>individual</b> <b>farm</b> levels. The plenum also sought to reduce government expenditures by ending state subsidies on food and certain consumer goods for state employees. It further determined that all relevant costs to the national government needed to be accounted for in determining production costs and that the state should cease compensating for losses incurred by state enterprises. To implement these resolutions, monetary organizations were required to shift to modern economic accounting. The government created a new dong in September 1985, and set maximum quotas for the amount permitted to be exchanged in bank notes. The dong also was officially devalued.|$|E

40|$|Economic {{reforms have}} induced {{enterprise}} restructuring in transition countries. In agriculture, {{the most dramatic}} form of restructuring is the break-up of state and collective <b>farms</b> into <b>individual</b> <b>farms.</b> The development of <b>individual</b> <b>farming</b> varies strongly between countries, regions and households. This paper uses household-level data from a 1996 survey in Romania to analyze which household and regional characteristics determine the shift to <b>individual</b> <b>farming.</b> <b>Individual</b> <b>farming</b> is influenced by several household characteristics, such as the human capital (education, age, farming experience), physical capital endowments (ownership of land, buildings, machinery, livestock) and access to other finance sources (off-farm wages, pensions). Furthermore, environmental factors, such as infrastructure, local access to inputs, and the pre-reform importance of <b>individual</b> <b>farming</b> in the region, all affect the development of <b>individual</b> <b>farming...</b>|$|R

40|$|This {{paper is}} {{motivated}} {{by the fact that}} (part-time) <b>individual</b> <b>farming</b> is commonly observed among rural households in a number of transition economies {{but it is not clear}} prima facie if such resource allocation is optimal. A conceptual model of household labor allocation between <b>individual</b> <b>farming</b> and off-farm wage employment is developed. The model explicitly accounts for the role of household endowments in labor allocation as the analysis is conditioned on the status of factor markets. The hypotheses are empirically tested using 1998 data from a country-representative survey of rural households in Hungary, an advanced transition country, which only recently became EU member state. Results provide evidence that capital market imperfections still remain. Implications for the policies related to agricultural sector restructuring, employment and rural development are discussed.
