40|$|New Lagrangians, {{depending}} on the field strengths and the <b>electric</b> and <b>magnetic</b> sources are found, which lead to the Maxwell equations. One new feature is that the equations of motion are obtained by varying the Lagrangian with respect to both the field strengths and the sources. In this way, conserved currents can be found for the field strengths and the <b>electric</b> or <b>magnetic</b> sources. Furthermore, using the equations of motion, the <b>electric</b> or <b>magnetic</b> sources can be eliminated, leading to conserved currents for the field strengths only (in the presence of <b>electric</b> and <b>magnetic</b> sources). Another new feature is {{the construction of a}} Lagrangian invariant under the duality transformation for both field strengths and <b>electric</b> and <b>magnetic</b> sources.
