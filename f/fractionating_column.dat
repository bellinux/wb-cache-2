25|$|Gunther is an Australian of German and Scots ancestry, born in Melbourne on 15 August 1950. He {{attended}} Preston East Primary School from 1955 to 1956, and Balwyn North Primary School from 1956 until 1962. For his tenth birthday, Gunther {{received a}} copy of the now famous book entitled The Golden Book of Chemistry Experiments from an older cousin. Inspired by the book, he started working on various experiments, making use of various chemicals that could be found around in his house. After he spilled some potassium permanganate solution on his bedroom carpet his mother confined him to an alcove in the garage which he turned into a small laboratory, replete with industrial chemicals and second-hand laboratory glassware. Gunther was interested in finding out how things like detergents and oils were composed by cracking them in his <b>fractionating</b> <b>column.</b> He took particular interest in mixing paints for his art classes, as well as his chemistry classes in Balwyn High School. His father, being the Superintendent of Melbourne's electrical power station, borrowed an organic chemistry text from the chemists in the quality control laboratory. This ultimately led to an intense interest in synthesizing Azo dyes. At around age 14, Gunther attempted to predict the color of azo dyes based on the chromophore-auxochrome combination. Apart from drawing up empirical tables, this effort was largely unsuccessful due to his lack of knowledge of quantum theory.|$|E
500|$|An {{alternative}} to continuous distillation is batch distillation, where {{the mixture is}} added to the unit {{at the start of the}} distillation, distillate fractions are taken out sequentially in time (one after another) during the distillation, and the remaining bottoms fraction is removed at the end. [...] Because each of the distillate fractions are taken out at different times, only one distillate exit point (location) is needed for a batch distillation and the distillate can just be switched to a different receiver, a fraction-collecting container. [...] Batch distillation is often used when smaller quantities are distilled. [...] In a continuous distillation, each of the fraction streams is taken simultaneously throughout operation; therefore, a separate exit point is needed for each fraction. [...] In practice when there are multiple distillate fractions, the distillate exit points are located at different heights on a <b>fractionating</b> <b>column.</b> The bottoms fraction can be taken from the bottom of the distillation column or unit, but is often taken from a reboiler connected to the bottom of the column.|$|E

In our self-developed laboratory setup, <b>fractionating</b> <b>columns</b> (in particular, Vigreux columns) were used to investigate ammonium removal and to demonstrate the resulting decrease of the inhibitory effect of NH 4 + during the subsequent digestion process.

For these scale sizes, the use of packed columns will be more appropriate instead of the commonly used laboratory <b>fractionating</b> <b>columns</b> [17].|$|R

50|$|Fractional {{distillation}} {{is one of}} {{the unit}} operations of chemical engineering. <b>Fractionating</b> <b>columns</b> are widely used in the chemical process industries where large quantities of liquids have to be distilled. Such industries are the petroleum processing, petrochemical production, natural gas processing, coal tar processing, brewing, liquified air separation, and hydrocarbon solvents production and similar industries but it finds its widest application in petroleum refineries. In such refineries, the crude oil feedstock is a complex, multicomponent mixture that must be separated, and yields of pure chemical compounds are not expected, only groups of compounds within a relatively small range of boiling points, also called fractions. That is the origin of the name fractional distillation or fractionation. It is often not worthwhile separating the components in these fractions any further based on product requirements and economics.|$|R

The next cut further down the tower is the diesel oil cut with a boiling range from about 180°C to about 315°C. The boiling ranges between any cut and the next cut overlap because the distillation separations are not perfectly sharp.

30|$|Anaerobic {{digestion}} {{to produce}} biogas {{is generally considered}} {{as one of the}} most sustainable technologies for the production of renewable energy. During this microbial process, organically bound nitrogen is released as ammonium that ends up in the digestate and finally may inhibit the process.

This is achieved at laboratory scale through an easy and self-designed stripping and scrubbing process using Vigreux and Dufton columns, which are commonly used laboratory <b>fractionating</b> <b>columns.</b> The stripping is performed at pH 8.5 and at 323.15  K (50  °C), which results in the volatilization of the ammonium present in ammonia. Subsequently, the stripping gas charged with ammonia is put into contact with a sulphuric acid solution, resulting in (NH 4) 2 SO 4, which can be used as an N–S fertilizer. In addition, the digestion experiments have demonstrated that the biogas yield is 36 % higher after removal of the ammonium from the digestate compared to the untreated digestate.|$|R

30|$|Anaerobic {{digestion}} {{is generally}} considered {{as one of the}} most sustainable technologies for the production of renewable energy. The main bottleneck of the digestion process is the rather low conversion efficiency of organic material which is partly due to the accumulation of ammonia/ammonium. This nitrogen issue can thus be avoided by removing the ammonium present in the digestate by means of a stripping and scrubbing process. In this study, a self-developed laboratory-scale setup for stripping and scrubbing was developed and applied on a thermophilic digestate from a potato processor. This easily built system can be used to study stripping and scrubbing of any digestate. Our digestion experiments have demonstrated that after 8  days of incubation, the biogas yield is 36 % higher after removal of the ammonium from the digestate compared to the untreated digestate. This proves the inhibitory effect of ammonium at a concentration of 2.3  g L− 1 NH 4 +–N for this particular digestate. In addition, the stripping and scrubbing process ensures that ammonium is removed from the digestate and recovered in the form of (NH 4) 2 SO 4, which can act as nitrogen fertilizer. The stripping and scrubbing process was investigated with three different combinations of two types of commonly used laboratory <b>fractionating</b> <b>columns,</b> namely a Vigreux column and a Dufton column for their gas–liquid partition potential. Without optimizing for ammonium removal, the column combination Vigreux (for the stripping part)—Dufton (for the scrubbing part) could remove 87 % of the ammonium from the supernatant (obtained after centrifugation of the digestate), while simultaneously 90 % of the stripped ammonium was recovered as (NH 4) 2 SO 4. The overall efficiency for the nitrogen recovery is thus almost 80 %.|$|R

40|$|The DNA of phage T 5 is {{partially}} denatured by stirring at 25 °C in 0 · 1 M- or 0 · 6 M-NaCl at speeds and DNA concentrations {{similar to those}} required to initiate breakage of the molecules. The denaturation can be recognized by abnormal retention of the DNA on <b>fractionating</b> <b>columns</b> and by limited susceptibility to enzymes specific for denatured DNA, but not by alteration of absorbancy—temperature relationships. These measurements show that a small degree of denaturation affects a large fraction of the molecules, which must be denatured in restricted regions along their length. The lesions cannot be healed by thermal treatment. After partial breakage of a DNA sample by stirring, broken and unbroken molecules prove to be denatured about equally. Denaturation but not breakage is suppressed when DNA is stirred at 5 °C or in 2 · 6 M-NaCl. Conversely, denaturation without breakage can be produced at 45 °C and diminished stirring speeds. Fast stirring, sufficient to break the DNA quickly, reduces the amount of denaturation. Thus breakage and denaturation are independent processes in {{that they do not}} show any marked tendency to occur simultaneously in a single molecule, nor does one predispose to the other. Stirring first at 5 °C at the speed producing half-length fragments, then restirring at a higher temperature, causes less denaturation than stirring at the higher temperature only. This means that denaturation, like breakage, is produced by forces acting near the centers of the molecules, forces whose effectiveness depends both on the conditions of stirring and on the length of the molecules. Local denaturation can be produced also by bringing T 5 DNA to temperatures near the midpoint of the hyperchromic transition and then cooling either rapidly or slowly. Probably heat and shear act in part through similar mechanisms. The DNA of phage T 2 is also subject to denaturation under shear, but is appreciably less susceptible than T 5 DNA...|$|R

The size of the DNA segments in the major bands has been estimated to be in the range of 0. 44 × 106 to 3. 2 × 106 daltons. The fragments which rapidly reform duplex chains after denaturation are sensitive to single-strand-specific nucleases.

This review collects a number of simple calculations that are useful for thinking about protein structure at the nanometer level. Readers are reminded that the Perrin equation is generally not a valid approach to determine the shape of proteins.
