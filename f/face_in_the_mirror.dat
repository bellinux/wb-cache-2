5|$|Norman Osborn {{is shown}} to be {{severely}} manic depressive. This has been referenced several times in a myriad of Spider-Man stories. When he is not {{under the direction of}} a psychiatrist and taking medication, he has dangerous mood swings. At the apex of his mania, he is paranoid, delusional, and suffers from visual and auditory hallucinations, including hearing the voice of his Green Goblin persona and seeing its <b>face</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>mirror</b> rather than his own. Previously, Osborn's arrogance caused him to refuse to submit to psychiatric treatment unless forced to; he viewed mental illness as an imperfection and therefore would not admit that he is mentally ill. In later conversations with the Sentry, Osborn revealed that he had come to accept his own mental illness. After having rid of his powers after the confrontation with the Superior Spider-Man (Doctor Octopus), Osborn's sanity apparently restored but remains a villain.|$|E
5|$|The {{music video}} begins with Clarkson {{sitting on a}} couch in an apartment's living room, holding a {{heart-shaped}} locket in her hand. The next scene shows Clarkson in the bathroom where she fixes her <b>face</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>mirror,</b> she opens the medicine cabinet and tossing all the pills in the medicine cabinet {{over her shoulder and}} messing all the bathroom items on the floor, squirting the toothpaste into the sink. When she gets to a container of birth control pills, she turns on the water in the sink, snaps the pills out, and drops them down the drain. Clarkson then starts to take other items; she throws a container of makeup powder spray in the air and smears a container of facial mud mask on the wall. During the chorus, Clarkson and her band perform the song for a dancing crowd in a club. After the first chorus, Clarkson walks into a room full of closets. She cuts up dresses, rifling through the closets and pulling out clothes, destroying them and singing in a pile of them. After the second chorus, she walks into a bedroom and begins to tear the pillow on the bed, filling the room with feathers. The scenes of Clarkson singing with her band then alternate with a montage of her destroying the apartment, breaks the glass window from the door, breaks the vase, television, clock, fridge, lights, microwave, phone, furniture and the chair. Later, Clarkson takes a framed photo of her ex-boyfriend with another girl in the living room, before pushing a tall CD rack over. She then smashes the framed photo through a glass table, breaking it in half. Having decimated the apartment, Clarkson walks out the door and down the hallway with a hat on her head, just as her ex-boyfriend appears with his girlfriend, walking arm in arm. Clarkson hides her face as she walks away from them. The final scene shows the couple seeing their damaged apartment in shock and the scene of the locket swinging.|$|E

40|$|Apparitional {{experiences}} during mirror gazing were studied. Under {{low levels}} of illumination, individuals gazed at their own reflected <b>faces</b> <b>in</b> a mirror for a duration of 10 min. Face illumination was relatively uniform, via a nonvisible light source. After about a minute of mirror gazing, individuals reported perceiving strange faces—archetypical and often unknown, human or animal, living or departed parents with traits changed, and fantastical monstrous beings—instead of their own <b>faces</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>mirror.</b> During these apparitions, the observers reported feeling that a strange person was watching them from within or beyond <b>the</b> <b>mirror,</b> while <b>the</b> observer maintained consciousness of himself looking at the strange “other. ” Three psychophysical experiments were conducted on 42 naïve normal individuals. At an illumination of the face around 0. 8 lux, the mean frequency of apparitions was 1. 8 min. - 1 and mean duration was 7 sec. per apparition. At higher illumination, the frequency of apparitional experiences decreased while <b>the</b> duration of <b>mirror</b> gazing needed for the phenomenon to occur increased. This effect may be termed “conscious dissociation of self-identity” to distinguish it from pathological unconscious dissociative identity disorder...|$|R

Then he set to work with his paints, first staining Will’s face to the reddish-brown of the man’s complexion, and then adding line after line. After two hours’ work he asked them to stand together before a glass, and both were astonished; the resemblance was indeed perfect. Will’s eyebrows had been stained a grayish white, and some long hairs had been inserted so as to give them the shaggy appearance of the pedlar. A crow’s foot had been painted at the corner of each eye, and a line drawn from the nose to the corners of the lips. The chin and lower part of the cheeks had been tinted dark, to give them the appearance of long shaving.

40|$|Self-perception in {{a mirror}} is a dynamic process {{involving}} self-motion and autonomous self-exploratory control of facial poses and expressions. In a previous work, apparitions of strange <b>faces</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>mirror</b> were experienced, often as other beings appearing in place of one's own face. The {{purpose of the present}} study was to investigate whether individuals would attribute apparent life to an inanimate but human-like mask. Participants wore an original ritual mask and engaged in mirror-gazing themselves whilst wearing <b>the</b> mask, <b>in</b> a quiet and dimly lit room. Dependent variables were the event-related responses and the phenomenological descriptions. Results showed that, <b>in</b> <b>the</b> worn-mask condition, all participants perceived apparitions of the living-mask. When a mask is worn, it temporarily turns into an embodied part of one's self or, <b>in</b> other words, <b>the</b> self is projected into a physical object, the mask, that is afforded into one's body neighbourhood. The experimental findings can be explained by the effect of embodied information from the observer's body whilst wearing the mask. Binding between embodied-self (proprioceptive, kinesthetic, action, and motion information from observer's body) and visual information (reflected-mask) can produce a temporary global representation of worn-mask as a living-self. <b>The</b> living-self <b>in</b> <b>the</b> mask becomes <b>the</b> dissociative-other <b>in</b> order to preserve the individual's ego identity...|$|R

So I said, 'We have to do just the right kind of movement so it doesn't become something that you laugh at.' But it just has to take it to another level. So I got in a room with choreographerMichael Peters, and he and I together kind of imagined how these zombies move by making <b>faces</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>mirror.</b> I used to come to rehearsal sometimes with monster makeup on, and I loved doing that.
