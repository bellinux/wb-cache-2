25|$|Anti-dsDNA {{antibodies}} are a {{group of}} anti-nuclear antibodies (ANA) the target antigen of which is double stranded DNA. Blood tests such as enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) and immunofluorescence are routinely performed to detect anti-dsDNA antibodies in <b>diagnostic</b> <b>laboratories.</b> They are highly diagnostic of systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) and are implicated in the pathogenesis of lupus nephritis.|$|E
25|$|Hep-2 cells, {{originally}} of laryngeal carcinoma origin, {{are actually}} a contamination of HeLa cells. They are routinely {{used in the}} diagnosis of ANA in <b>diagnostic</b> <b>laboratories.</b> HEp-2 cells provide a greater ability to differentiate patterns of ANA than animal sections, due to the large nuclei and high mitotic rate of the cell line. Upon incubation with serum containing anti-dsDNA antibodies and fluorescent labelled secondary antibodies, homogeneous staining of interphase nuclei and condensed chromosomal staining of mitotic cells can be seen.|$|E
25|$|The Farr assay {{is used to}} {{quantify}} the amount of anti-dsDNA antibodies in serum. Ammonium sulphate is used to precipitate antigen-antibody complexes that form if the sera contains antibodies to dsDNA. The quantity of these antibodies is determined by using radioactively labelled dsDNA. Although this test is very specific, it is of little use in routine <b>diagnostic</b> <b>laboratories</b> due to its laboriousness and use of radioactive materials. The Farr assay {{is one of the}} only tests available that detects high avidity antibodies (along with Crithidia luciliae) and also has the ability to detect antibodies of any isotype.|$|E

25|$|Potassium bromide {{is used in}} {{veterinary}} medicine to treat epilepsy in dogs, either as first-line treatment or in addition to phenobarbital, when seizures are not adequately controlled with phenobarbital alone. Use of bromide in cats is limited because it carries a substantial risk of causing lung inflammation (pneumonitis) in them. The use of bromide as a treatment drug for animals means that veterinary medical <b>diagnostic</b> <b>laboratories</b> are able {{as a matter of}} routine to measure serum levels of bromide on order of a veterinarian, whereas human medical diagnostic labs in the US do not measure bromide as a routine test.|$|E
