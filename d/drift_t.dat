40|$|Abstract Timely and {{accurate}} evaluation of damage sus-tained by buildings after seismic {{events such as}} earthquakes or blasts is critical to determine the buildings ’ safety and suitability for their future occupancy. Time used in con-ducting the evaluations substantially affects the duration for which the potentially damaged buildings remain unusable. The elapsed time may lead to direct economic losses to {{both public and private}} owners, and society at large. The pre-sented research investigates the application of close-range photogrammetry surveying techniques and Augmented Re-ality (AR) visualization to design a semi-automated method for rapidly measuring structural damage induced in tall buildings by seismic events such as earthquakes or ex-plosions. Close-range photogrammetry algorithms were de-signed to extract spatial information from photographic im-age data, and geometrically measure the horizontal drift (also called interstory drift) sustained at key floors along the edge of a damaged building.

The multiplicative coalescent is shown to be a Feller process on l 2.

The Process is an under-researched but important aspect of statutory family assessment. Pre-litigation stages of family assessment, particularly in relation to child protection and safeguarding are undertaken within the Framework for the Assessment of Children in Need and their Families, set out in Working Together to Safeguard Children. The Child Death Review Process, also in Working Together to Safeguard Children is applied in cases of child deaths categorised as ‘sudden’ and ‘unexpected’. Assessment of bereaved parents is particularly sensitive and highlights the problems of mixing investigatory assessment with measures intended to be supportive. This paper questions the function of the Child Death Review Process, asking whether it forms part of a <b>drift</b> <b>t</b> owards increasingly intrusive state surveillance of families and particularly parents, or is an attempt to ‘work together’ with parents following bereavement. If it is an investigatory process there are ramifications for subsequent decision making, including decisions made by courts in public family law or criminal proceedings.

40|$|The {{region where}} deep open-ocean {{convection}} {{occurs in the}} Greenland Sea corresponds to that where a sea ice winter feature, the Odden, usually forms. The role of sea ice in modifying the surface waters to overturn to depth is evaluated through the combination of in siu measurements, satellite imagery, meteorological measurements and drifting buoy data. Results suggest local meteorological and oceanographic conditions govern the ice conditions over the region. The high ambient wave energy precludes the formation of ice beyond the frazil-pancake stage; the changing surface pressure field, due to passing storm systems, influences the daily shape and extent of the Odden and enables pancake ice to expel brine at an increased rate. Finally, the analysis of drifting buoy data reveal that the ice is in free <b>drift.</b> <b>t</b> These characteristics suggests the Odden may {{be regarded as a}} large scale latent heat polynya, with the predominately northerly winds blowing newly formed sea-ice constantly southward such that it melts in a different area from that of its formation. This salt separation process whereby the majority of brine is deposited where the ice was formed, and a smaller amount being released, through brine drainage, as the ice drifts with the prevailing wind has important consequences for the spatial and temporal distribution of the salt flux and hence surrounding hydrography. This is clearly demonstrated through the development of a salt flux model, which involves brine drainage and drift. A simple one-dimensional mixed layer model, driven by results of the salt flux model, predicts a strong density enhancement and deepening of the mixed layer over time. It is therefore envisaged that the formation of sea ice, brine drainage and drift are fundamental in eroding the pycnocline between the surface waters and those below. Sea ice should therefore be viewed as a preconditioning activity to deep overturning of the waters of the central Greenland Sea. EThOS - Electronic Theses Online ServiceGBUnited Kingdo...|$|E

Mine-by-tests were performed during the excavation of the <b>Test</b> <b>Drift</b> (1987). They indicated a rather large extent of the hydraulic disturbance (around 1. 0 MPa at a radial distance r = 12 m), and large values of short-term settlement (ranging between 10. 7 cm at r = 4. 95 m and 4. 0 cm at r = 8. 1 m). These results remain partly unexplained as modelling analyses do not predict such large values, particularly regarding the hydraulic disturbance extent (Côme, 1990; Mair et al., 1992). Since some excavation parameters (such as the overexcavation) were not well constrained, and due to the proximity of the first shaft, conclusions are difficult to be drawn. Therefore, new and more reliable data are required on the excavation-induced disturbance in the Boom Clay to improve the predictions.

Of particular relevance for coupled THM processes are thermally induced rock-mass stress and deformations, with associated changes in fracture aperture and fractured rock permeability. Thermally induced rock-mass deformation and accompanying changes in fracture permeability were reasonably well predicted using a continuum elastic model, although some individual measurements of displacement and permeability indicate inelastic mechanical responses. It is concluded that fracture closure/opening caused by a change in thermally induced normal stress across fractures is an important mechanism for changes in intrinsic fracture permeability at the DST, whereas fracture shear dilation appears to be less significant.

40|$|The Yucca Mountain <b>Drift</b> Scale <b>Test</b> (DST) is a multiyear, {{large-scale}} underground heater test {{designed to}} study coupled thermal-hydrological-mechanical-chemical behavior in unsaturated fractured and welded tuff. As {{part of the}} international cooperative code-comparison project DECOVALEX, four research teams used four different numerical models to simulate and predict coupled thermal-hydrological-mechanical (THM) processes at the DST. The simulated processes included above-boiling temperature changes, liquid and vapor water movements, rock-mass stress and displacement, and THM-induced changes in fracture permeability. Model predictions were evaluated by comparison to measurements of temperature, water saturation, displacement, and air permeability. The generally good agreement between simulated and measured THM data shows that adopted continuum model approaches are adequate for simulating relevant coupled THM processes at the DST. Moreover, TM-induced rock-mass deformations were reasonably well predicted using elastic models, although some individual displacements appeared to be better captured using an elasto-plastic model. It is concluded that fracture closure/opening caused by change in normal stress across fractures is the dominant mechanism for TM-induced changes in intrinsic fracture permeability at the DST, whereas fracture shear dilation appears to be less significant.
