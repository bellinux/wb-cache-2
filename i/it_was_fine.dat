5|$|A 1985 {{government}} committee, led by State Secretary Per Arne Watle, {{recommended that}} more route be flown by both Braathens SAFE and SAS, and that additional airlines {{be allowed to}} start other routes. On 5 September 1985, Braathens SAFE applied for the route Trondheim – Bodø – Harstad/Narvik – Tromsø and Tromsø–Longyearbyen. SAS had stated that <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>fine</b> with them if other airlines started flying international routes they did not, and on 17 October Braathens SAFE also applied for the routes Bergen–Stavanger–Paris, Bergen–Stavanger–Manchester, Oslo–Stavanger–Brussels and Trondheim–Bergen–Newcastle. The applications were rejected and it was agreed upon that SAS would retain all rights to fly internationally between Oslo, Bergen, Stavanger, Gothenburg, Stockholm, Copenhagen and Århus.|$|E
25|$|Straight away Munroe {{obtained}} a few lumps of black graphite which he beat to a pulp with a hammer. He separated the fine particles that floated {{to the top}} of the water with a spoon and mixed them with a clay solution. His first experiments with this lead solution was not very successful. He continued making cabinet maker’s squares and sold the few of these which he could. In this time he continued experimenting with graphite lead for pencils with little accomplishment. He had no knowledge of the subject and feared consulting others as they might take the idea and produce pencils themselves. Munroe continued experimenting in secret with graphite powder formulas on his own. Eventually he figured a way to come up with a suitable graphite paste formula of various ingredients that could be poured into a slotted line made in some cedar wood blanks. The pencil centers would be his secret formula of a mixture of dried graphite paste of clay and other unknown ingredients. They were air dried and not hardened by firing in a furnace as Europeans did, so the quality was not as good as theirs—but <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>fine</b> enough to write with.|$|E

The pamphlet was clearly labeled a composite. [...] McCarthy said it was [...] "wrong" [...] to distribute it; though staffer Jean Kerr thought <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>fine.</b> After he lost the election by almost 40,000 votes, Tydings claimed foul play.|$|E

A new word called 'Madonna wannabe' was introduced to describe the thousands of girls who tried to emulate Madonna's style. University professors, gender-studies experts and feminists earnestly started discussing her role as a post-modernist style and cultural icon. According to author Debbi Voller, [...] "Like a Virgin" [...] gave rise to the icon Madonna.|$|E
500|$|Presley also {{disagreed}} with having {{children with the}} singer. Imagining the future and {{what would happen if}} the marriage ended, Presley saw a [...] "custody battle nightmare". In addition, she felt her husband was too emotionally immature to be a parent, having watched his daily interactions with other people; she believed he was the one in need of parenting. Jackson explained to his wife over breakfast one morning that she did not have to be the biological mother if she so desired. He explained, [...] "My friend Debbie [...] said she will get pregnant and have my baby. If you won't do it, then she will. How about that?" [...] Unmoved, Presley replied that <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>fine</b> by her.|$|E

Shortly after their engagement, Suzanne returns and announces she is expecting Darren's babies. Regarding Darren being the father of twin babies and if his relationship with Nancy would survive, Dawson felt the situation was too difficult for Nancy but for Darren <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>fine.</b> He felt that the story was [...] "interesting" [...] and hoped the pairing would survive as they have [...] "something special". Darren and Nancy split up when he moves Suzanne and the babies into Nancy's flat. They resume their romance after Suzanne leaves and takes the children with her.|$|E

500|$|The Beatles was {{the third}} album to be {{released}} by Apple Records, following Harrison's Wonderwall Music, and Two Virgins. Martin {{has said that he}} was against the idea of a double album at the time and suggested to the group that they reduce the number of songs to form a single album featuring their stronger work, but that the band decided against this. Interviewed for the Beatles Anthology television series in the 1990s, Starr said that he now felt that it should have been released as two separate albums (that he nicknamed [...] "The White Album" [...] and [...] "The Whiter Album"). Harrison felt on reflection that some tracks could have been released as B-sides, but [...] "there was a lot of ego in that band." [...] He also supported the idea of the double album, to clear out the backlog of songs that the group had at the time. By contrast, McCartney said that <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>fine</b> as it was, adding: [...] "It's the bloody Beatles' White Album. Shut up!" ...|$|E
500|$|The song's {{influence}} was most profound on the younger generation. Madonna's public persona of an indomitable, sexually unashamed, supremely confident woman {{struck a chord}} with them. Biographer Andrew Morton noted that most of Madonna's admirers were females, who were born-and-brought-up with an image of old-fashioned stereotypes of women as virginal brides, or as whores, or with feminist values that rejected {{the use of a}} woman's looks for her self-advancement. Author William McKeen of Rock and roll is here to stay: an anthology commented that with the song, Madonna intermixed such middle-class ideas of femininity with examples of what femininity meant to her, which was having equal opportunity. In addition, at a time when eighties fashions were promoting flat-chested, stick-thin women as ideals of beauty, the more curvaceous Madonna made average girls feel that <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>fine</b> to be in the shape they were. The term [...] "Madonna wannabe" [...] was introduced to describe the thousands of girls who tried to emulate Madonna's style. At one point, Macy's allotted an entire floor area for the sale of clothes styled according to Madonna's fashion. University professors, gender-studies experts and feminists earnestly started discussing her role as a post-modernist style and cultural icon. According to author Debbi Voller, [...] "Like a Virgin" [...] gave rise to the icon Madonna.|$|E

However, Enya does not classify her music {{as part of the}} genre. When asked what genre she would classify her music, her reply was [...] "Enya". Nicky Ryan commented on the new age comments: [...] "Initially <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>fine,</b> but it's really not new age. Enya plays a whole lot of instruments, not just keyboards. Her melodies are strong and she sings a lot. So I can't see a comparison."

2500|$|Following his conversion, Yusuf {{abandoned}} his musical career {{for nearly three}} decades.

He has said that there was [...] "a combination of reasons, really", and that the continuing demands of the music business had been [...] "becoming a chore, and not an inspiration anymore". In a 2004 interview on Larry King Live, he said [...] "A lot of people would have loved me to keep singing. You come to a point where you have sung, more or less... your whole repertoire and you want {{to get down to the}} job of living. You know, up until that point, I hadn't had a life.

2500|$|In 2006, Mikkelsen starred {{opposite}} Stine Stengade and Jana Plodková in Ole Christian Madsen's award-winning film Prag (Prague). His role as Christoffer {{earned him}} the Zulu Award for Best Actor and Bodil and Robert Festival nominations for Best Actor. Eddie Cockrell of Variety noted his [...] "rigid countenance" [...] in an [...] "outstanding" [...] performance. The same year, Mikkelsen achieved his first widely acclaimed international success as Le Chiffre in the twenty-first James Bond film, Casino Royale. Mikkelsen {{has said that he}} so easily won the part that even Daniel Craig asked him if he had slept with someone in order to be cast. He said of the casting, [...] "They'd done their homework, seen my stuff, so <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>fine,</b> just a bit of anti-climax, because I was so ready to do more for them, but it was … shrugs... you're in." [...] He also stated that because he was already a big film star in Denmark at the time, that the international role did not really change much. Roger Ebert noted the suspense during Mikkelsen's scene with Bond during the extended poker game, in which Le Chiffre weeps blood from his left eye. David Edelstein of New York Magazine said [...] "Mikkelsen clicks his rectangular plaques as if he's a new breed of praying mantis. He's bloodcurdling." [...] In 2006, Mikkelsen also took the lead role in the Danish drama After the Wedding, which earned an Academy Award nomination for Best Foreign Film. He won the Palm Springs International Film Festival Award for Best Actor and a European Film Award for Best Actor nomination for his performance. The New York Times remarked that on the Hollywood scene, Mikkelsen has [...] "become a reliable character actor with an intriguing mug" [...] but stated that on the domestic front [...] "he is something else: a star, an axiom, a face of the resurgent Danish cinema." ...|$|E

2500|$|In May 2011, Silas takes a dislike to Riley's fiancé, Mercedes McQueen (Jennifer Metcalfe), {{after he}} learns of her promiscuity. Silas {{attempts}} and fails to attack Mercedes with a candlestick when her back is turned. Metcalfe later hinted that Mercedes {{may have to}} watch her back in the future {{when it comes to}} Silas. She said [...] " [...] is a tough cookie, isn't he? I think every girl in the village needs to watch their back where Silas is concerned..." [...] In October 2011, it was reported that Silas would hold Mercedes captive in a vault. Silas decides to teach heavily pregnant Mercedes a lesson after she confesses to an affair with Riley's father, Carl Costello (Paul Opacic). Silas's plan is to keep Mercedes alive until she has given birth and then murder her. Metcalfe called the plot [...] "brilliant" [...] and said it was [...] "quite flattering" [...] to be trusted with it. The actress explained that Mercedes thinks that she is going to die whilst being help captive. Mercedes also fears that her baby is going to die. Metcalfe said that it does not take long for Mercedes to realise that Silas is responsible for the recent murders. Silas wants to keep the baby alive, but not Mercedes. Therefore, Silas does the [...] "bare minimum" [...] for Mercedes, giving her water, a small amount of food and keeping her warm. Daniel Kilkelly of Digital Spy opined that storyline sounds [...] "really dark" [...] and asked Metcalfe whether Hollyoaks are pushing the boundaries with it. Metcalfe revealed that [...] "they are a little bit", saying [...] "It's all shot in a very clever way, so <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>fine</b> when it came to compliance. But it was difficult {{and there was a lot}} of stuff that we had to be really careful about when we were filming it."
