40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to examine the {{anatomical}} landmarks of the retrotympanum using two different techniques, virtual endoscopy (VE) and <b>fiberoptic</b> <b>endoscopy,</b> and to correlate the results furnished by the two methods. Ten otosclerotic patients who were due to undergo stapedectomy were scanned using high-resolution spiral CT. Selected CT datasets were processed with Navigator 2. 0 software to obtain virtual endoscopic views of the retrotympanum. Subsequently, during the surgical procedure, <b>fiberoptic</b> <b>endoscopy</b> was performed with 2. 7 -mm 0 ° and 30 ° rigid endoscopes. The ability of the two imaging methods to identify specific anatomical structures was then compared. In all cases the pyramidal eminence, pyramidal crest and sinus tympani were clearly identified in both VE images and otoendoscopy recordings, while <b>fiberoptic</b> <b>endoscopy</b> seemed to be less satisfactory than VE for studying the facial sinus, sinus of Proctor and fossula of Grivot. The two techniques proved to be equally sensitive for visualizing the ponticulus and subiculum, while the stapedius tendon could be visualized only by means of <b>fiberoptic</b> <b>endoscopy.</b> Overall, VE imaging appears promising for rendering important anatomical details of the retrotympanum, allowing identification of osseous landmarks and exploring recesses that are difficult to visualize via otoendoscopy...|$|E

We recruited 158 patients; 100 (group A) had inflammatory-obstructive rhinosinus disease, and 58 (group B) had a history of rhinosinus surgery. All patients underwent VRS within 2 to 6 hours of FE, and VRS was able to demonstrate the anatomic details of the nasal fossa and rhinopharynx with a high correspondence to FE. A satisfying representation of anatomic detail was found in both groups A and B. The VRS was able to visualize invasiveness of the endosinusal cavities, which was not accessible to FE. The VRS is a fast, relatively easy, and noninvasive technique that could be integrated into FE or used as an alternative when FE is unfeasible. Because of the ability to explore the sinus cavity, we suggest that virtual rhinosinusoscopy should be considered as the appropriate term, instead of virtual rhinoscopy.

The management of 39 patients with colonic volvulus treated over 9 years was reviewed. Five per cent were treated with rectal tube decompression alone, 23 % were treated with either sigmoidoscopic or colonoscopic reduction, and 26 % were treated exclusively with operation. Endoscopic reduction was attempted in nearly half of the patients in preparation for operation. Recurrent volvulus occurred in 57 % of patients initially treated with endoscopic reduction alone. Sigmoidoscopic examination did not confirm the diagnosis in 24 % of instances in which it was used, although colonoscopy was always diagnostic. The overall mortality rate was 8 %, but increased to 25 % in patients with gangrene of the colon. Three patients who later proved to have gangrene of the colon had a normal initial sigmoidoscopic examination. Two of these patients died of intra-abdominal sepsis from a perforated colon. In five patients an accurate endoscopic diagnosis of gangrene prompted immediate exploration. None of these patients died. Endoscopy is a safe and effective diagnostic tool for the initial evaluation of patients with suspected colon volvulus.

Objective The objective {{of this study is to}} describe computed tomography (CT) findings in cases with bilateral choanal atresia. Methods The study involved performing axial and coronal non-contrast CT scanning with 2 - 3 mm sections on 14 neonates that had bilateral CA. We used <b>fiberoptic</b> nasal <b>endoscopy</b> to confirm the diagnosis. We evaluated coronal CT to study the skull base area in such neonates. Results This study included 14 neonates with bilateral CA; with mean age of 7 3. 5 days. Mixed atretic plates were found in 12 (85. 7 %) cases while two (14. 3 %) had pure bony atresia. Isolated CA was detected in 9 cases (64. 3 %) and 5 (35. 7 %) cases had associated anomalies. Coronal CT showed soft tissue density in the nasal cavity that appeared to extend through an apparent defect in the nasal roof (cribriform plate), falsely diagnosed by radiologists as associated encephalocele. At the time of surgical repair, all patients showed thick tenacious mucous secretions in both nasal cavities and revealed no encephalocele. Nasal roof remained intact in all cases. Conclusion The thick secretion of bilateral CA could give a false encephalocele appearance on the CT. It is highly recommended to perform proper suction of the nasal cavity of suspected CA cases just before CT scanning...|$|R
40|$|Purpose: Some preterm infants {{in general}} good health {{continue}} to present recurrent apnoeas, bradycardias and desaturations (ABD) despite usual treatments. These events {{may lead to}} transitory brain hypoxia and to further neurological injury. The {{purpose of this study}} has been to evaluate the role of laryngeal oedema in this symptomatology and to assess corticoid treatment. Method: Twelve preterm babies born at a median age of 28. 5 weeks (range: 26 - 35 weeks) already showed signs of ABD at a median age of life of 28. 5 days (range: 9 - 80 days). <b>Fiberoptic</b> laryngeal <b>endoscopy</b> was performed on these babies at a median postconceptional age of 34 weeks (range: 31 - 38 weeks) to detect a possible involvement of the larynx in their ABD. Results: Each patient presented a severe laryngeal oedema compatible with potential obstructive breathing. Half of the cohort (n= 6) received inhaled corticosteroids initiated with a short oral dexamethasone treatment for 3 to 5 days (group 1). All the babies improved. The other half (n= 6) received only an inhaled topic corticosteroid treatment (group 2). Four of the six babies improved and two needed oral dexamethasone. Laryngoscopic endoscopy was carried out after 1 week of treatment. The picture corresponded with clinical improvement. Recurrence of ABD occurred in 3 / 12 (25 %) of the babies after stopping dexamethasone. No immediate side effects of the procedure or the treatment were observed. Conclusion: Laryngeal oedema may be a cause of ABD in preterm newborns. It may arise from oesophageal reflux and/or presence of the feeding tube. It can be diagnosed by atraumatic fiberoptic fibroscopy and successfully treated with corticosteroids. © 2004 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.

The need for endoscopic access to improve diagnosis and treatment of small bowel disease has led to the development of novel technologies one of which is non-invasive, the video capsule, and a type of invasive technique, the device-assisted enteroscopy. In particular, the device-assisted enteroscopy consists then of three different types of instruments all able to allow, in skilled hands, to display partially or throughout its extension (if necessary) the small intestine. Newer devices, double balloon, single balloon and spiral endoscopy, are just entering clinical use. The aim of this article is to review recent advances in small bowel enteroscopy, focusing on indications, modifications to improve imaging and techniques, pitfalls, and clinical applications of the new instruments.

40|$|Introduction: Nasal {{respiratory}} obstruction is a {{very common}} otolaryngologic problem, often caused by adenoid hypertrophy (AH). Nasal <b>fiberoptic</b> <b>endoscopy</b> (NFE) represents the gold standard method to diagnose AH. Rhinomanometry represents a valid diagnostic support. Objective: The aim of our study was to analyze the diagnostic value of rhinomanometry after nasal decongestant (ND) test {{for the evaluation of}} adenoid hypertrophy in children. Materials and methods: Seventy-one of 97 collaborative children, aged 6 - 12 years, affected by upper airways obstructive symptoms and diagnosed as 'chronic oral breathers' by a standardized questionnaire were included in the study. The first evaluation included a complete physical examination, anterior rhinoscopy and anterior active rhinomanometry. Patients with a positive rhinomanometry underwent a second rhinomanometry after the administration of the nasal decongestant (ND) xylometazoline. All children were evaluated using nasal <b>fiberoptic</b> <b>endoscopy</b> (NFE). Results: At rhinomanometry a normal nasal airflow was found in 19 (26. 8 %) of children while nasal obstruction was underlined in 52 (73. 2 %). These patients were tested also with rhinomanometry after ND which confirmed the presence of nasal obstruction in 29 (55. 7 %) of patients. All patients included in the study underwent a NFE: 34 (47. 8 %) of them presented severe AH with an occlusion > 75 % of the choanal opening (grade >= 3) and 37 (52. 2 %) presented no or a mild form of AH (grade < 3). When compared to NFE, rhinomanometry test after ND had 82. 7 % sensitivity and 82. 6 % specificity. Positive predictive value and negative predictive value were 85. 7 % and 79. 2 %, respectively. Two receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves were derived using data related to rhinomanometry vs NFE, and to rhinomanometry after ND vs NFE. Conclusions: Rhinomanometry after ND, compared to rhinomanometry, is more specific and useful to evaluate nasal obstruction due to AH in children, and it may be helpful to avoid unnecessary surgical procedures in children with temporary nasal obstruction.

Excellent survival statistics from Japanese studies reflect both the effects of mass surveying and early surgery and the prevalence of superficial spreading type of cancer. Improvement of results in this country will require more aggressive evaluation and earlier surgical intervention...|$|E
40|$|We report all year-old boy who {{presented}} with difficulty in swallowing without symptoms of hypothyroidism. The physical examination revealed a mass {{at the base}} of the tongue. The thyroid hormone profile showed a primary hypothyroidism (a serum TSH of 10. 8 IU/mL with normal-low thyroxin of 6. 0 fig/dL and low triiodothyronine of 57. 8 ng/ dL). Antithyroid antibodies were negative. The <b>fiberoptic</b> <b>endoscopy</b> showed a reddish mass, without evidence of haemorrhage or ulceration, confirmed as a well circumscribed, hypodense mass in the base of the tongue by computed tomography of the oropharynx and neck. Tc- 99 -pertechnetate scanning showed an abnormal area of uptake {{at the base of}} the tongue and no uptake in the normal thyroid location, concordant with an ectopic lingual thyroid gland. Levothyroxine in a suppressive dose was started that resulted in a reduction of the size of the mass and disappearance of dysphagia (RevMéd Chile 2008; 136 : 83 - 7...|$|E
40|$|OBJECTIVE: Because of {{intrinsic}} limitations of transverse cross-sectional imaging methods, CT sometimes is insufficient for adequate evaluation of complex tracheobronchial anomalies. This article describes a complementary 3 D procedure specifically {{dedicated to the}} study of the tracheobronchial tree. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The procedure combines a specific spiral CT acquisition with 2 or 4 mm collimation, 3 D surface rendering of the tracheobronchial aerial content, and double obliquity multiplanar reformats directly planned on the 3 D virtual object. It was performed in 11 complex cases including 3 stented benign or malignant stenoses and 2 single lung transplantations. RESULTS: Easier understanding of the tracheobronchial status was achieved in all cases. In three cases, the procedure yielded relevant diagnostic information that neither <b>fiberoptic</b> <b>endoscopy</b> nor transverse CT had provided, leading to significant modification of patient management. CONCLUSION: Three-dimensional spiral CT of the bronchial tree with secondary reformation seems suitable in clinical practice for selected cases...|$|E

As the result of basic researches, several intravital fluorophores have been determined so far in human colorectal tissue. Autofluorescence endoscopy (AFE) can detect slight alterations in their distribution and concentration during the colorectal carcinogenesis process and, thus facilitate noninvasive screening colonoscopies {{without the need for}} fluorescent substances or staining reagents to be administered. While detecting faint autofluorescence intensity by conventional <b>fiberoptic</b> <b>endoscopy</b> remains challenging, the latest AFE system with high-resolution videoendoscope capabilities enables such detection by using a false-color display algorithm. To this end, the diagnostic benefits of AFE have been reported in several multicenter randomized controlled studies of colorectal cancer (CRC) screening and differential diagnosis. CRC screening using the latest AFE technology could, therefore, lead to future reductions in CRC mortality. 1...|$|E
