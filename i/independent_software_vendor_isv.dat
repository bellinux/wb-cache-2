40|$|The Cast 4 All Content Conductor Platform is an {{integration}} and provisioning suite to manage data broadcasting networks {{in general and}} digital cinema networks in particular. The framework makes extensive use of open source components and contains several extensions and modifications to those components. It is a typical case of an <b>Independent</b> <b>Software</b> <b>Vendor</b> (<b>ISV)</b> building application software on top of open source platform software. In {{the spirit of the}} open source movement, the extensions or modifications to the open source components could be contributed back to the community. However, in this paper we discuss several issues that companies face in such a situation. They extend far beyond the obvious decision whether to keep the developed code proprietary, and should not be neglected. It is argued that a closer collaboration between open source projects and independent software vendors would be beneficial to all...|$|E

The project started more than five years before we had any hardware, and the work on simulators presented many challeng es. We discuss three different aspects of the Itanium compiler: the compiler performance analysis, which focused on demonstrating the Intel Itanium^TM processor (ITP) performance on the Spec benchmarks; enabling Operating System Vendors (OSVs) such as IBM to port their Operating System (OS) to the Itanium architecture; and <b>Independent</b> <b>Software</b> <b>Vendor</b> (<b>ISV)</b> enabling work, which focused on enabling ISVs to port real applications on the Itanium architecture.

40|$|Part 1 : Information & Communication Technology-EurAsia Conference 2014, ICT-EurAsia 2014 International audienceWith SaaS {{application}}, tenant {{can focus}} on application utilization while <b>Independent</b> <b>Software</b> <b>Vendor</b> (<b>ISV)</b> is responsible for application dep- loyment, installation, operation and maintenance. Using Aspect Oriented Soft- ware Development (AOSD), we propose eight concerns, i. e. configurability, discriminator, measurement, monitoring, tenant management, billing manage- ment, performance management, and application management. Those concerns are integrated into a SaaS system architectural design, to enhance SaaS opera- tional flexibility and maintainability. As a proof of concept, we developed a SaaS operational environment using Spring and AOP. Two Java applications have been integrated to this environment after tailoring. We have tested the modules, classes and services and then the applications, {{to demonstrate that the}} platform is able to run a set of web applications as a SaaS. Using this system, ISV can modify an existing Java application easily {{to be a part of}} SaaS and measure resource usage and monitor SaaS operation by a dashboard...|$|E
40|$|In {{this study}} we examine the antecedents of small <b>independent</b> <b>software</b> <b>vendor</b> (<b>ISV)</b> {{decisions}} to join a platform ecosystem. Using data {{on the history of}} partnering activities from 1201 ISVs from 1996 to 2004, we find that appropriability strategies based on intellectual property rights and the possession of downstream complementary capabilities by ISVs are positively related to partnership formation, and ISVs use these two mechanisms as substitutes to prevent expropriation by the platform owner. In addition, we show that greater competition in downstream product markets between the ISV and the platform owner is associated with a lower likelihood of partnership formation, while the platform’s penetration into the ISV’s target industries is positively associated with the propensity to partner. The results highlight the role of innovation appropriation, downstream complementary capabilities, and collaborative competition in the formation of a platform ecosystem.
