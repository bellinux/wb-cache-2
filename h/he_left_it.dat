After Daisy's death, the property was subdivided and passed through numerous owners until Charles Romito purchased the mansion and immediately surrounding land for $1 million in 1980 to open a winery.|$|E
5|$|A giant clone of Keniclius, named Keniclius Five, kidnaps First Officer Spock (voiced by Leonard Nimoy). He {{believes}} the galaxy is as war-ravaged as Earth was when <b>he</b> <b>left</b> <b>it.</b> He plans to enforce peace on the galaxy {{with the aid}} of a fleet of Phylosian ships and a giant clone of Spock that he's created, at the expense of the original Spock's life. The newly awakened giant Spock clone uses his Vulcan telepathic abilities to mind meld with his original self and save his life. The two Spocks, in concert with Captain James T. Kirk (voiced by William Shatner), convince Keniclius that the need for his plan no longer exists. Spock Two and Dr. Keniclius Five devote themselves to restoring the Phylosian civilization as the original departs with his shipmates.|$|E
5|$|Bamber {{told the}} court that, during his visit on 6 August, hours before the murders, he had loaded the rifle, {{thinking}} he had heard rabbits outside, but hadn't used it. He had then left it on the kitchen table, with a full magazine {{and a box of}} ammunition, before leaving the house. When <b>he</b> <b>left</b> <b>it</b> in the kitchen, it did not have the silencer or telescopic sight attached, he said; they had been on the rifle in late July according to a nephew, but Bamber said his father must have removed them in the meantime. The prosecution disputed this, maintaining that the silencer was on the rifle when the family was murdered.|$|E

5|$|Soon {{after he}} {{acquired}} the acoustic guitar, Hendrix formed his first band, the Velvetones. Without an electric guitar, {{he could barely}} {{be heard over the}} sound of the group. After about three months, he realized that he needed an electric guitar in order to continue. In mid-1959, his father relented and bought him a white Supro Ozark. Hendrix's first gig was with an unnamed band {{in the basement of a}} synagogue, Seattle's Temple De Hirsch, but after too much showing off, the band fired him between sets. He later joined the Rocking Kings, which played professionally at venues such as the Birdland club. When someone stole his guitar after <b>he</b> <b>left</b> <b>it</b> backstage overnight, Al bought him a red Silvertone Danelectro.|$|E
5|$|The name Crewkerne {{is thought}} to be derived from Cruc-aera; from the British cruc - a spur of a hill, and the Old English aera - a house, {{especially}} a storehouse. The town was known as Crocern, or Cruaern in the 899 will of Alfred the Great when <b>he</b> <b>left</b> <b>it</b> to his younger son Æthelweard, and by 1066 the manor was held by Edith Swanneck mistress of King Harold. After the Norman conquest it was held by William the Conqueror and the church estate was given to the Abbaye-aux-Hommes in Caen, Normandy. In the Domesday Survey of 1086 it was described as a royal manor.|$|E
5|$|Aurobindo's close spiritual collaborator, Mirra Richard (b. Alfassa), came to {{be known}} as The Mother. She was a French national, born in Paris on 21 February 1878. In her 20s she studied occultism with Max Theon. Along with her husband, Paul Richard, she went to Pondicherry on 29 March 1914, and finally settled there in 1920. Aurobindo {{considered}} her his spiritual equal and collaborator. After 24 November 1926, when Aurobindo retired into seclusion, <b>he</b> <b>left</b> <b>it</b> to her to plan, build and run the ashram, the community of disciples which had gathered around them. Some time later, when families with children joined the ashram, she established and supervised the Sri Aurobindo International Centre of Education with its experiments in the field of education. When he died in 1950, She continued their spiritual work, directed the ashram, and guided their disciples.|$|E

5|$|Goldfaden had an on-again off-again {{relationship}} with Zionism. Some of his earliest poetry was Zionist avant la lettre {{and one of}} his last plays was written in Hebrew; several of his plays were implicitly or explicitly Zionist (Shulamith set in Jerusalem, Mashiach Tzeiten?! ending with its protagonists abandoning New York for Palestine); he served as a delegate from Paris to the World Zionist Congress in 1900. Still, {{he spent most of his}} life (and set slightly more than half of his plays) in the Pale of Settlement and in the adjoining Jewish areas in Romania, and when <b>he</b> <b>left</b> <b>it</b> was never to go to Palestine, but to cities such as New York, London or Paris. This might be understandable when the number of his potential Jewish spectators in Palestine in his time was very small.|$|E

He was a professional dancer {{for almost a decade}} until <b>he</b> <b>left</b> <b>it</b> behind to study drama at the Århus Theatre School in 1996, embarking on a career in acting.|$|E
25|$|Frost's {{father was}} a teacher and later {{an editor of the}} San Francisco Evening Bulletin (which later merged with The San Francisco Examiner), and an {{unsuccessful}} candidate for city tax collector. After his death on May 5, 1885, the family moved across the country to Lawrence, Massachusetts, under the patronage of (Robert's grandfather) William Frost, Sr., who was an overseer at a New England mill. Frost graduated from Lawrence High School in 1892. Frost's mother joined the Swedenborgian church and had him baptized in it, but <b>he</b> <b>left</b> <b>it</b> as an adult.|$|E
25|$|Another of his plays, Dolorosa, {{was taken}} up by the National Theater in 1911. The same year, Diamandy prefaced the {{collected}} works of a deceased socialist poet, Ion Păun-Pincio. By 1912, when his political satire Rațiunea de stat ("The Reason of State") was published in Flacăra review and taken up by Comoedia Troupe, Diamandy had been elected President of the Romanian Theatrical Society. However, Diamandy complained that his works were ignored by the National Theater, despite good referrals from writers Iacob Negruzzi and Zamfirescu. Eventually joining the Writers' Society in 1911, <b>he</b> <b>left</b> <b>it</b> in 1913, but returned by popular demand in 1914.|$|E

25|$|Heidegger himself, who is {{supposed}} to have broken with Husserl, bases his hermeneutics on an account of time that not only parallels Husserl's account in many ways but seems to have been arrived at through the same phenomenological method as was used by Husserl.... The differences between Husserl and Heidegger are significant, but if we do not see how much it is the case that Husserlian phenomenology provides the framework for Heidegger's approach, {{we will not be able}} to appreciate the exact nature of Heidegger's project in Being and Time or why <b>he</b> <b>left</b> <b>it</b> unfinished.|$|E

Copies were also listed in the library catalogs of religious houses--Fountains Abbey, Hailes Abbey, Clerkenwell Priory, and St Mary's Abbey, York (which had two copies). Matheson lists five manuscripts of continental providence, produced in France, Flanders, and Lorraine.|$|E
25|$|The Duke of Norfolk was {{appointed}} Lieutenant-General {{north of the}} River Trent on 29 January 1541, and Captain-General in a campaign against the Scots in August 1542. In June 1543, he declared war on France in the King's name and {{was appointed}} Lieutenant-General of the army. During the campaign of May–October 1544, he besieged Montreuil, while King Henry VIII captured Boulogne, before returning home. Complaining of lack of provisions and munitions, Norfolk eventually raised the siege of Montreuil, and realizing that Boulogne could not realistically be held by the English for long, <b>he</b> <b>left</b> <b>it</b> garrisoned and withdrew to Calais, {{for which he was}} severely rebuked by the King.|$|E

25|$|Despite his {{preoccupation with}} the stage, and later with his {{official}} duties, Schubert found time during these years for {{a significant amount of}} composition. He completed the Mass in A-flat major (D. 678) and, in 1822, embarked suddenly on a work which more decisively than almost any other in those years showed his maturing personal vision, the Symphony in B minor Unfinished (D. 759). The reason <b>he</b> <b>left</b> <b>it</b> unfinished—after two movements and sketches some way into a third—remains an enigma, and it is also remarkable that he did not mention it to any of his friends, even though, as Brian Newbould notes, he must have felt thrilled by what he was achieving. The event has been debated endlessly without resolution.|$|E
25|$|After Habré {{was ousted}} by the rebel forces of Idriss Déby in December 1990, Nouri became a close {{ally of the}} new President and a pillar of his regime. In the {{transitional}} coalition government formed following the 1993 Sovereign National Conference, Nouri became Minister of Health under Prime Minister Fidèle Moungar. In 1995, when Koibla Djimasta was appointed as the last transitional Prime Minister, Nouri was named Minister of the Interior; while holding this post, he also chaired the Commission Nationale Recensement Électoral (CNRE), created in 1995 to organise the voter registration for the first multiparty elections in Chad since independence. Following Déby's victory in the 1996 presidential election, Nouri was moved from his post as Minister of the Interior to that of Minister for Livestock. He kept the latter post for five years; <b>he</b> <b>left</b> <b>it</b> on February 24, 2001, when he was appointed as Minister of National Defence in the government chaired by Nagoum Yamassoum. He left his post and the government three years later, during a cabinet reshuffle that took place on February 2, 2004. Nouri's entourage gave ill health {{as the reason for}} his departure. He was successively posted for two years to Saudi Arabia as an ambassador, until he left his position on May 6, 2006.|$|E
