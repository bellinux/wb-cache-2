25|$|The intensifying {{campaign}} against German cities did not cease. Among {{the most controversial}} raids was the Bombing of Dresden in February 1945. The rationale of the raid was to aid the advance of the Red Army on the Eastern Front. Dresden was a communications hub which, it was believed, was transporting German reinforcements eastward. It was also thought it harboured significant industries {{in and around the}} city. Its value as a military target was and still is questioned due to the city's apparent lack of <b>industrial</b> <b>potential</b> in its centres and the late stage of the war. Soon afterwards, Allied forces conducted Operation Clarion. The operation sent thousands of bombers and fighters by day and night to target smaller cities and targets of opportunity.|$|E
25|$|In November 1941, the Wehrmacht {{was already}} near Moscow. But {{from the rear}} of the Soviet Union, {{military}} equipment and armaments continued to arrive. The main supplier was GAZ, which was in Gorky (now Nizhny Novgorod). Therefore, the German command developed a plan to destroy the <b>industrial</b> <b>potential</b> and occupation of the city. Thus, Germany was counting on gaining control over the entire Volga region. On November 4, the Luftwaffe began bombing of Gorky. After the first raid, some workshops of GAZ and the Dvigatel Revolyutsii plant were damaged. The main building was destroyed at the Nitel plant, which caused the death of the director and management. The second attack on the city brought much more destruction. GAZ was almost completely disabled. On its territory, many shops and adjoining social facilities were destroyed. However, in the first year of bombing, German aviation almost did not bombing administrative buildings. There were also no raids on the Kremlin. In the following years, the attacks on Gorky continued again.|$|E
500|$|The {{campaign}} was a strategic Soviet success. For the first time, a major German offensive had been stopped before achieving a breakthrough. The Germans, despite using more technologically advanced armour {{than in previous}} years, were unable {{to break through the}} in-depth Soviet defences and were caught off guard by the significant operational reserves of the Red Army. This result changed the pattern of operations on the Eastern Front, with the Soviet Union gaining the operational initiative. The Soviet victory, however, was costly, with the Red Army losing considerably more men and materiel than the German Army. However, the Soviet Union's larger <b>industrial</b> <b>potential</b> and pool of manpower allowed them to absorb and replenish these losses, with their overall strategic strength unaffected.

2500|$|The [...] "'Level of Industry {{plans for}} Germany" [...] were the plans to lower German <b>industrial</b> <b>potential</b> after [...] World War II. At the Potsdam conference, with the U.S. {{operating}} {{under influence of}} the Morgenthau plan, the victorious Allies decided to abolish the German armed forces {{as well as all}} munitions factories and civilian industries that could support them. This included the destruction of all ship and aircraft manufacturing capability. Further, it was decided that civilian industries which might have a military potential, which in the modern era of [...] "total war" [...] included virtually all, were to be severely restricted. The restriction of the latter was set to Germany's [...] "approved peacetime needs", which were defined to be set on the average European standard. In order to achieve this, each type of industry was subsequently reviewed to see how many factories Germany required under these minimum level of industry requirements.|$|E
2500|$|The aims {{at a new}} {{understanding}} of regionalism yet in a modern idiom materialised in the greater use of timber - the building material most associated historically with Finnish architecture. However, there lies a dichotomy in its use: between its inherent positive values and its use as symbolising nostalgia, not to mention exploiting its <b>industrial</b> <b>potential</b> by the pervading timber industry. Already in 1956 Alvar Aalto argued that the use of wood was not a nostalgic return to a traditional material; {{it was a case of}} its [...] "biological characteristics, its limited heat conductivity, its kinship with man and living nature, the pleasant sensation to the touch that it gives.". A special unit, the so-called Wood Studio - partly funded by the Finnish wood industry - was founded at Aalto University not only to research wood construction but also to build experimental structures in wood, often using computer-based parametric design principles. An early example of this is the Observation Tower at Helsinki Zoo (2002) by Ville Hara and the Wood Studio. Similarly, Kärsämäki Shingle Church (1999-2004) by Anssi Lassila, was the result of a student competition held by the University of Oulu Department of Architecture, based on the idea of a modern church built using 18th century timber construction techniques, as a reminder of a previous church on the same site. Other notable large-scale wooden constructions since 2000 include the Sibelius Concert Hall, Lahti (1997-2000), by APRT; the east stand roof of the Helsinki Olympic Stadium (2005) by K2S Architects; and Kilden Performing Arts Centre, Kristiansand, Norway (2012), by ALA Architects. The Museum of the History of Polish Jews, Warsaw, Poland (2013), by Lahdelma & Mahlamäki is characterised by the principle of [...] "complex objects in a glass box", including parametrically-designed organic forms.|$|E

Mid- or large-pore zeolite frameworks are selected as supports to access large organic molecules, and atomically distributed copper catalysts exhibit high activities (84 - 90 % conversions) toward direct arylation of anilides with diphenyliodonium salt on 0. 5 mol% copper concentration. Computational studies indicate the well-fitted copper-aryl complexes inside zeolite frameworks. Electron micrographs, elemental analyses, and reusability study show no observable leaching of catalytically active copper species during the reactions tested. These results demonstrate the practical synthetic potential of copper-exchanged zeolites as promising supported molecular catalysts to afford biaryl motifs-containing compounds with high catalytic activity, chemical stability, and recyclability. clos...|$|R
