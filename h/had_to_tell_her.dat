60|$|Johnnie Hewlett indeed {{was sorry}} {{when he went}} home to his aunt, and <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> <b>her</b> why {{he had not been}} {{confirmed}} after all.|$|E
60|$|When Mrs. Easterfield {{heard all}} that Olive <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> <b>her</b> about Maria Port, her heart {{went out to}} that brave man who kept the toll-gate.|$|E
6000|$|... "We <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> <b>her</b> she {{was going}} a journey, or we never could have got her into the carriage," [...] she explained, feeling like a thief.|$|E
60|$|CARMODY (uncertainly). Yes--I disremembered she didn't know. I'll <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> <b>her,</b> surely.|$|R
6000|$|... 'I'll always {{remember}} that, and I'll tell your mother. Ah, but she won't believe me, Dick; you will <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> <b>her</b> yourself.' ...|$|R
60|$|March 2.--My guest {{has just}} left me. I am afraid Mrs. Eyrecourt will be sadly {{disappointed}} {{when she hears}} what I <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> <b>her.</b>|$|R
6000|$|... "Well, I <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> <b>her</b> something. It {{looks so}} funny me being {{here and not}} married to you. I didn't know what she'd think of me." ...|$|E
60|$|ALICK [wagging {{his head}} sadly]. I <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> <b>her.</b> And then I--I-- {{bought her a}} {{sealskin}} muff, and I just slipped it into her hands and came away.|$|E
6000|$|Then he <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> <b>her.</b> [...] "We can't find Pony, {{and some}} of the boys thought Jim might know where he is. I'm sorry to disturb you, Mrs. Leonard. Good-night," [...] and he went back home.|$|E
60|$|In {{ten minutes}} they were {{steaming}} {{out of the}} harbour for their voyage {{of four or five}} hours, at whose ending she would <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> <b>her</b> strange story.|$|R
6000|$|... "It's NOT an excuse," [...] she said. [...] "If {{mother will}} {{let me go}} to church like this I'll go. But I'll <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> <b>HER</b> why, Mr. Campbell, because I'm certain she'd never let me if I didn't." ...|$|R
2500|$|Wayland, then flies <b>to</b> <b>her</b> father <b>telling</b> {{him of his}} revenge. The sorrow {{stricken}} king {{asks his}} thrall to go and fetch his daughter and Böðvildr <b>has</b> <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> <b>her</b> father the gruesome truth mirroring the tragedy told of in Deor: ...|$|R
6000|$|Now I hesitated, as what I <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> <b>her</b> {{seemed so}} foolish, indeed so insane, {{while she waited}} patiently as though to give me time to shape my thoughts. Speaking at last because I must, I said, ...|$|E
60|$|While {{we were at}} table, I {{thought it}} a {{favourable}} occasion to tell Peggotty about Mr. Barkis, who, before I had finished what I <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> <b>her,</b> began to laugh, and throw her apron over her face.|$|E
6000|$|Bostil stared after her. [...] "D--n me!" [...] he swore, as {{he threw}} a boot against the wall. [...] "I reckon I'll never let her marry Slone, but I just <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> <b>her</b> what I think of him!" ...|$|E
5000|$|They don’t get on {{very well}} initially, but later, they {{fall in love}} with each other. Luis feels that he <b>has</b> <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> <b>her</b> that he is her son's father, but he can’t do this, because if he did, Hipólita would hate him.|$|R
6000|$|... "No," [...] she said, [...] "that wouldn't do. She {{has kept}} {{account of the}} time, you may be sure, and she would ask me at once if I was inquiring in your behalf, and I should <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> <b>her</b> the truth." ...|$|R
50|$|Jimmy has Pop set up {{fights with}} lesser foes. He changes his style, boxing rather than punching, to avoid risking {{damage to his}} new face. The fans boo him. Meanwhile, Pop sends for Peggy. Jimmy <b>has</b> <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> <b>her</b> that he is seeing someone else.|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes," [...] said Thirlwell, [...] "she has borne enough. You {{can imagine}} the shock she'd get if we found out, and <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> <b>her.</b> The thing's done with. It's some relief to feel that my {{responsibility}} has gone." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Then I <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> <b>her</b> {{the whole}} story, too; {{and every time}} I tell it it seems sillier and sillier to imagine that Ken meant {{anything}} serious. I felt idiotic and ashamed by the time I got through.|$|E
6000|$|... "And you in brown!" [...] she said, indignantly {{turning to}} Mr. Lorry; [...] "couldn't {{you tell her}} what you <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> <b>her,</b> without {{frightening}} her to death? Look at her, with her pretty pale face and her cold hands. Do you call that being a Banker?" ...|$|E
5000|$|Cindy’s Magic Wand: Cindy Thrower slaves for a cruel {{uncle and}} aunt and spiteful cousins. She starts {{secretly}} {{training as a}} javelin thrower, but the lies she <b>has</b> <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> <b>her</b> nasty relatives in order to slip away to train start {{to catch up with}} her.|$|R
6000|$|He leant {{his head}} against the bed-post and groaned. [...] "Milly may be here at any moment," [...] says he, [...] "and I'll <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> <b>her</b> the baby's been sent by mistake to a Dog Show! I daresn't do it," [...] he says, [...] "I daresn't do it." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes," [...] she answered, most {{unexpectedly}} to me, [...] "I {{will try}} to see her. But if I do see her, and she refuses <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> me anything about your daughter, what will you do? Of course, I shall <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> <b>her</b> I come from you, and for you." ...|$|R
60|$|Mr. Fenwick {{did come}} again--the very next evening, but one. And he came so often after that that even Nancy got {{resigned}} to him. One day I <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> <b>her</b> something. I shrank from doing it, for I feared {{it would make}} her feel badly.|$|E
60|$|As {{they lay}} {{side by side}} a mermaid caught Wendy by the feet, and began pulling her softly into the water. Peter, feeling her slip from him, woke with a start, and was {{just in time to}} draw her back. But he <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> <b>her</b> the truth.|$|E
60|$|This morning I {{spoke to}} Laura as I had promised. The composure--I may almost say, the insensibility--which she has so strangely and so resolutely {{maintained}} ever since Sir Percival left us, was not proof against {{the shock of}} the news I <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> <b>her.</b> She turned pale and trembled violently.|$|E
60|$|Charlotte assented. 'I <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> <b>her</b> something,' she said, 'which {{will make}} no difference, but which I should {{like her to}} know this morning--at once. I have {{discovered}} {{that we have been}} entirely mistaken about Mr. Somerset.' She nerved herself to relate succinctly what <b>had</b> come <b>to</b> her knowledge the day before.|$|R
6000|$|... "Well, {{your aunt}} isn't coming {{home for a}} month yet. When she comes you will <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> <b>her</b> that the cat--is lost--but you needn't say WHEN it happened. As for the rest, Fatima is your {{property}} now, so Aunt Cynthia can't grumble. But she will have a poorer opinion than ever of your fitness to run a house alone." ...|$|R
50|$|Niko {{tries to}} sneak out of his girlfriend's {{apartment}} before she wakes, but <b>has</b> <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> <b>her</b> {{that he will not}} be back that evening because he has some vague things to do. She offers coffee, but he says he is late already. He moves boxes into a new apartment, looking through old photos, and checks his mail. He opens an official letter and realizes he is late for an appointment.|$|R
60|$|She {{followed}} him thither; and her curiosity {{to know what}} he <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> <b>her</b> was heightened by the supposition of its being in some manner connected with the letter he held. It suddenly struck her that it might be from Lady Catherine; and she anticipated with dismay all the consequent explanations.|$|E
6000|$|... "I'm afraid I had a row {{with your}} aunt, Susy," [...] he began lightly, {{in his old}} {{familiar}} way; [...] "but I <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> <b>her</b> I didn't think her conduct to Mrs. Peyton was exactly the square thing towards one who had been as devoted to you as she has been." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "They {{all heard}} that man order {{me out of}} his ship," [...] he thought, and thereupon {{for a second or}} so he {{contemplated}} without flinching the lurid image of a massacre. [...] "And yet I <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> <b>her</b> that not a hair of her head shall be touched. Not a hair." ...|$|E
5000|$|His mother cries at the request, {{realizing that}} her son is asking a much deeper {{question}} [...] - [...] that being where his own father is in his life. She realizes that she <b>has</b> <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> <b>her</b> son the truth [...] - [...] both son and mother are victims of [...] "another kind of game that daddies play", in his case his father abandoning the family six years earlier.|$|R
5000|$|The painter discovers a kindred {{spirit in}} Lydia's younger sister Zhenya, a dreamy and {{sensitive}} girl who spends her time reading, admiring him painting and having long walks. The two fall in love, and an evening comes when, after a walk, the painter lets his feelings {{out in a}} passionate outburst. Zhenya responds in kind, but feels she <b>has</b> <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> <b>her</b> mother and sister about their love immediately.|$|R
6000|$|... "I'll {{go and see}} her," [...] said Cynthia. [...] "I don't believe she's {{strong enough}} for a waitress, and I <b>have</b> got <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> <b>her</b> so." ...|$|R
