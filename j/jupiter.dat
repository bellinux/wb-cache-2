5|$|Although <b>Jupiter</b> {{would need}} to be about 75 times as massive to fuse {{hydrogen}} and become a star, the smallest red dwarf is only about 30 percent larger in radius than <b>Jupiter.</b> Despite this, <b>Jupiter</b> still radiates more heat than it receives from the Sun; the amount of heat produced inside it is similar to the total solar radiation it receives. This additional heat is generated by the Kelvin–Helmholtz mechanism through contraction. This process causes <b>Jupiter</b> to shrink by about 2cm each year. When it was first formed, <b>Jupiter</b> was much hotter and was about twice its current diameter.|$|E
5|$|Although the Juno orbiter, which {{arrived at}} <b>Jupiter</b> in 2016, has a camera called JunoCam, {{it is almost}} entirely focused on {{observations}} of <b>Jupiter</b> itself.

5|$|Binary {{systems of}} sub-brown dwarfs are {{theoretically}} possible; Oph 162225-240515 was initially {{thought to be}} a binary system of a brown dwarf of 14 <b>Jupiter</b> masses and a sub-brown dwarf of 7 <b>Jupiter</b> masses, but further observations revised the estimated masses upwards to greater than 13 <b>Jupiter</b> masses, making them brown dwarfs according to the IAU working definitions.|$|E
50|$|Several of <b>Jupiter's</b> small {{innermost}} moons, namely Metis and Adrastea, {{are within}} <b>Jupiter's</b> ring system {{and are also}} within <b>Jupiter's</b> Roche limit. It is possible that these rings are composed of material that is being pulled off these two bodies by <b>Jupiter's</b> tidal forces, possibly facilitated by impacts of ring material on their surfaces.|$|R
40|$|Most warm <b>Jupiters</b> (gas-giant planets with 0. 1 AU≲ a ≲ 1 AU) have {{pericenter}} distances {{that are}} too large for significant orbital migration by tidal friction. We study {{the possibility that the}} warm <b>Jupiters</b> are undergoing secular eccentricity oscillations excited by an outer companion (a planet or star) in an eccentric and/or mutually inclined orbit. In this model the warm <b>Jupiters</b> migrate periodically, in the high-eccentricity phase of the oscillation when the pericenter distance is small, but are typically observed at much lower eccentricities. We show that the steady-state eccentricity distribution of the warm <b>Jupiters</b> migrating by this mechanism is approximately flat, which is consistent with the observed distribution if and only if we restrict the sample to warm <b>Jupiters</b> that have outer companions detected by radial-velocity surveys. The eccentricity distribution of warm <b>Jupiters</b> without companions exhibits a peak at low eccentricities (e≲ 0. 2) that must be explained by a different formation mechanism. Based on a population-synthesis study we find that high-eccentricity migration excited by an outer planetary companion (i) can account for ∼ 20 % of the warm <b>Jupiters</b> and most of the warm <b>Jupiters</b> with e≳ 0. 4, a fraction that is consistent with the observed population of warm <b>Jupiters</b> with outer companions; (ii) can produce most of the observed population of hot <b>Jupiters,</b> with a semimajor axis distribution that matches the observations, but fails to account adequately for ∼ 60 % of hot <b>Jupiters</b> with projected obliquities ≲ 20 ^∘. Thus ∼ 20 % of the warm <b>Jupiters</b> and ∼ 60 % of the hot <b>Jupiters</b> can be produced by high-eccentricity migration. We also provide predictions for the expected mutual inclinations and spin-orbit angles of the planetary systems with hot and warm <b>Jupiters</b> produced by high-eccentricity migration.

5|$|In {{a revised}} version of the Nice model <b>Jupiter</b> trojans are {{captured}} when <b>Jupiter</b> encounters an ice giant during the instability. In {{this version of the}} Nice model one of the ice giants (Uranus, Neptune, or a lost fifth planet) is scattered inward onto a Jupiter-crossing orbit and is scattered outward by <b>Jupiter</b> causing the orbits of <b>Jupiter</b> and Saturn to quickly separate. When Jupiter's semi-major axis jumps during these encounters existing <b>Jupiter</b> trojans can escape and new objects with semi-major axes similar to Jupiter's new semi-major axis are captured. Following its last encounter the ice giant can pass through one of the libration points and perturb their orbits leaving this libration point depleted relative to the other. After the encounters end some of these <b>Jupiter</b> trojans are lost and others captured when <b>Jupiter</b> and Saturn are near weak mean motion resonances such as the 3:7 resonance via the mechanism of the original Nice model.|$|E

5|$|<b>Jupiter</b> is {{the fifth}} planet from the Sun and {{the largest in the}} Solar System.

5|$|<b>Jupiter</b> trojans do not {{maintain}} a fixed separation from <b>Jupiter.</b> They slowly librate around their respective equilibrium points, periodically {{moving closer to}} <b>Jupiter</b> or farther from it. <b>Jupiter</b> trojans generally follow paths called tadpole orbits around the Lagrangian points; the average period of their libration is about 150 years. The amplitude of the libration (along the Jovian orbit) varies from 0.6° to 88°, with the average being about 33°. Simulations show that <b>Jupiter</b> trojans can follow even more complicated trajectories when moving from one Lagrangian point to another—these are called horseshoe orbits (currently no <b>Jupiter</b> Trojan with such an orbit is known).|$|E
5|$|<b>Jupiter</b> trojans have orbits with radii between 5.05 and 5.35AU (the mean {{semi-major axis}} is 5.2±0.15AU), and are {{distributed}} throughout elongated, curved regions around the two Lagrangian points; each swarm stretches for about 26° along {{the orbit of}} <b>Jupiter,</b> amounting to a total distance of about 2.5AU. The width of the swarms approximately equals two Hill's radii, which {{in the case of}} <b>Jupiter</b> amounts to about 0.6AU.

5|$|The largest <b>Jupiter</b> trojan is 624 Hektor, {{which has}} an average {{diameter}} of 203±3.6km. There are few large <b>Jupiter</b> trojans {{in comparison to the}} overall population. With decreasing size, the number of <b>Jupiter</b> trojans grows very quickly down to 84km, much more so than in the asteroid belt. A diameter of 84km corresponds to an absolute magnitude of 9.5, assuming an albedo of 0.04. Within the 4.4–40km range the <b>Jupiter</b> trojans' size distribution resembles that of the main-belt asteroids. Nothing is known about the masses of the smaller <b>Jupiter</b> trojans. The size distribution suggests that the smaller Trojans are the products of collisions by larger <b>Jupiter</b> trojans.|$|E

40|$|We {{investigate}} tidal dissipation of obliquity in hot <b>Jupiters.</b> Assuming {{an initial}} random orientation of obliquity and parameters {{relevant to the}} observed population, the obliquity of hot <b>Jupiters</b> does not evolve to purely aligned systems. In fact, the obliquity evolves to either prograde, retrograde or 90 ^{o} orbits where the torque due to tidal perturbations vanishes. This distribution is incompatible with observations which show that hot <b>jupiters</b> around cool stars are generally aligned. This {{calls into question the}} viability of tidal dissipation as the mechanism for obliquity alignment of hot <b>Jupiters</b> around cool stars. Comment: 6 pages, 4 figures, accepted at ApJ...|$|R
5|$|The {{long-term}} {{future of}} the <b>Jupiter</b> trojans is open to question, because multiple weak resonances with <b>Jupiter</b> and Saturn cause them to behave chaotically over time. Collisional shattering slowly depletes the <b>Jupiter</b> trojan population as fragments are ejected. Ejected <b>Jupiter</b> trojans could become temporary satellites of <b>Jupiter</b> or Jupiter-family comets. Simulations show that the orbits of up to 17% of <b>Jupiter</b> trojans are unstable {{over the age of}} the Solar System. Levison et al. believe that roughly 200 ejected <b>Jupiter</b> trojans greater than 1km in diameter might be travelling the Solar System, with a few possibly on Earth-crossing orbits. Some of the escaped <b>Jupiter</b> trojans may become Jupiter-family comets as they approach the Sun and their surface ice begins evaporating.|$|E
