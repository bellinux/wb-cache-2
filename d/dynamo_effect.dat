2500|$|Features {{revealed}} by helioseismology include that the outer convective zone {{and the inner}} radiative zone rotate differently, which is thought by some to generate the main magnetic field {{at least in the}} outer layers of the Sun by a <b>dynamo</b> <b>effect.</b> Broadly speaking, the angular velocity of the convection zone decreases from equator to the poles, varying only weakly with depth; the radiative envelope beneath rotates almost uniformly. [...] These two regions are separated by a shear layer called the tachocline, which is too thin to be resolved directly by seismological analysis alone. The convective zone has [...] "jet streams" [...] of plasma (called torsional oscillations) thousands of kilometers below the surface. The jet streams form broad fronts at the equator, breaking into smaller cyclonic storms at high latitudes. Torsional oscillations are the time variation in solar differential rotation. They are alternating bands of faster and slower rotation. So far there is no generally accepted theoretical explanation for them, even though a close relation to the solar cycle is evident, as they have a period of eleven years, as was known since they were first observed in 1980.|$|E

40|$|Intense spin-down flows {{allow one}} to reach high Rm in {{relatively}} small laboratory setups using moderate mass of liquid metals. The spin-down flow in toroidal channels {{was the first}} flow configuration used for studying <b>dynamo</b> <b>effects</b> in non-stationary flows. In this paper, we estimate the <b>effect</b> of small-scale <b>dynamo</b> in liquid metal spin-down flows realized in laboratory experiments. Our simulations have confirmed {{the conclusion that the}} <b>dynamo</b> <b>effects</b> observed in the experiments done on gallium are weak [...] a slight burst of small-scale magnetic energy arises only at the highest available rotation velocity of the channel. In sodium flows, the induction effects are quite strong [...] an essential part of kinetic energy of sodium spin-down flows is converted into magnetic energy and dissipates because of Joule heat losses. We have extended our simulations beyond the capabilities of existing laboratory facilities and examined the spin-down flows at the channel rotation velocity Omega>> 50 rps. It has been found that Ω≈ 100 rps is enough to reach the equipartition of magnetic and kinetic spectral power density at the lowest wave numbers (largest scales), whereas at Omega >= 200 rps the intensity of the magnetic field becomes comparable to the intensity of velocity field fluctuations. We have also studied the influence of the Pm on the efficiency of small-scale dynamo in spin-down flows. In the experimental spin-down flows, the small-scale dynamo remains in a quasi-kinematic regime, and magnetic energy is mainly dissipated at the same scale, wherein it is converted from kinetic energy. The real small-scale dynamo starts to operate at Pm> 10 ^- 4, and the inertial range of the magnetic energy spectrum appears. Thereupon the energy dissipation is postponed to a later time and smaller scales, and the peak of turbulent energy (both kinetic and magnetic) slightly increases with Pm.

Near the magnetic equator, the afternoon uplift of the ionosphere by an eastward electric field reduces ion drag on the neutral wind, so that relatively strong eastward winds can occur in the evening.
