5|$|The {{changes to}} the DDL design {{reflected}} shifting requirements and poor project management by the Navy. The development of an Australian-designed ship customised for Australian conditions caused naval officers to include requirements beyond those which were essential. These changes were made without regard for costs, as the team tasked with developing the specifications was not also responsible for the ships' final price and <b>delivery</b> <b>schedule.</b> The Navy's failure to maintain control of the design requirements and make cost-performance trade-offs {{may have been due}} to its limited experience in overseeing the design of new warships.|$|E
25|$|While Kawasaki had {{few or no}} {{problems}} in delivering the R160Bs, Alstom was behind on its <b>delivery</b> <b>schedule</b> {{early on in the}} R160A order. Alstom was to deliver 200 out of the 400-car base order by September 2007. However, by that month, Alstom had only delivered 80 cars. Under the base contract, Alstom agreed to pay damages of $800 a day for late deliveries of four-car trains, and $1,000 a day for five-car trains, though the Transit Authority had not yet fined Alstom for its late deliveries and was actually negotiating with Alstom to accelerate their <b>delivery</b> <b>schedule.</b> The 200 cars were finally delivered 7 months late in early April 2008.|$|E

40|$|Purpose – The {{purpose of}} this paper is to {{generate}} a performance model for an order-to-delivery (OTD) process in <b>delivery</b> <b>scheduling</b> environments. It aims to do this with a triadic approach, encompassing a customer, a supplier and a logistics service provider. Design/methodology/approach – The paper takes the form of a conceptual analysis and a triadic case study on performance measurement requirements in an OTD process characterized by <b>delivery</b> <b>scheduling,</b> and generating performance models. Findings – Two OTD process performance models, one for the supplier’s delivery sub-process and one for the customer’s <b>delivery</b> <b>scheduling,</b> the logistics service provider’s transportation and the customer’s good receipt sub-process, in <b>delivery</b> <b>scheduling</b> environments are generated. Research limitations/implications – A single case study limits the levels of external validity and reliability to analytical generalization. Practical implications – The generated performance models include definitions of four sub-processes and outline ten performance dimensions that should be of relevance for several companies to apply. Originality/value – This is the first approach that generates performance models for a triadic OTD process for use in <b>delivery</b> <b>scheduling</b> environments...|$|R
40|$|We {{deal with}} the joint {{replenishment}} and <b>delivery</b> <b>scheduling</b> of the one-warehouse, n-retailer system in this paper. We suggest a more flexible policy for the joint replenishment and <b>delivery</b> <b>scheduling</b> of a warehouse compared with the existing researches. We introduce the mathematical model and two efficient algorithms for the joint replenishment and <b>delivery</b> <b>scheduling</b> of the warehouse. Subsequently, we develop the hybrid genetic algorithm (GA) and compare it with two efficient heuristic algorithms for extensive computational experiments. Further, we show the advantages of our GA in dealing easily with resource restrictions. Joint replenishment One-warehouse n-retailer system Genetic algorithm...|$|R

25|$|The {{issue with}} the delays was {{compounded}} by ongoing cost overruns, resulting in high-level diplomatic exchanges to get these issues resolved. India finally agreed to pay an additional US$1.2 billion for the project, more than doubling the original cost. However, ongoing delays with the Vikramaditya's <b>delivery</b> <b>schedule,</b> pushed the delivery to 2013.

25|$|In December 2004, the Iraqi {{ministry}} of defense signed two {{contracts with the}} Polish defence consortium BUMAR. The first contract, worth 132 million USD, was for the delivery of 20 PZL W-3 Sokół helicopters and the training of 10 Iraqi pilots and 25 maintenance personnel. They were intended to be delivered by November 2005, but in April 2005 the company charged with fulfilling the contract announced the delivery would not go ahead as planned, because the <b>delivery</b> <b>schedule</b> proposed by PZL Swidnik was not good enough. As a result, only 2 were delivered in 2005 for testing.|$|E

25|$|On 18 April 2011, Boeing {{announced}} that Australia had {{signed an agreement}} with the U.S. government to acquire a fifth C-17 due to an increased demand for humanitarian and disaster relief missions. The aircraft was delivered to the RAAF on 14 September 2011. On 23 September 2011, Australian Minister for Defence Materiel Jason Clare {{announced that}} the government was seeking information from the U.S. about the price and <b>delivery</b> <b>schedule</b> for a sixth Globemaster.

25|$|On September 15, 2012, the NTSB {{requested}} the grounding of certain 787s due to GE engine failures; GE believed the production problem had been fixed by that time. In March 2014, Mitsubishi Heavy Industries informed Boeing {{of a new}} problem that {{was caused by a}} change in manufacturing processes. Employees did not fill gaps with shims to connect wing rib aluminum shear ties to the carbon composite wing panels; the tightened fasteners, without shims, cause excessive stress that creates hairline cracks in the wings, which could enlarge and cause further damage. Forty-two aircraft awaiting delivery were affected, and each one required 1–2 weeks to inspect and repair. However, Boeing did not expect this problem to affect the overall <b>delivery</b> <b>schedule,</b> even if some airplanes were delivered late.|$|E
25|$|With the {{delivery}} of the first seven aircraft on 29 June 1985 to No. 1 Squadron, the Indian Air Force (IAF) became the first foreign user of the type. The service's early aircraft were powered by the Snecma M53-5 engine (and so were designated Mirage 2000H5 and Mirage 2000TH5), which were quickly replaced by the more-powerful M53-P2 engine. No. 1 Squadron formally converted to the type in January 1986; within twelve months of the first delivery, the IAF had received all 40 aircraft ordered. However, the <b>delivery</b> <b>schedule</b> had in fact been delayed. In addition, with the various accidents that occurred, another eight single-seat and one two-seat aircraft were ordered in 1986 as attrition replacement and maintenance reserves. As such, {{it was not until}} 1990 that full unit establishment was achieved. The Mirage 2000 would encounter other issues; during the first decade of service, the fleet suffered from operational and maintenance issues. The Indian government's Comptroller and Auditor General reported in 1995 that there was a delay in the construction of overhaul facilities and a shortage of spare parts, and that as a result the fleet could not meet its required flying hours. Compounding the issue was a lack of Mirage pilots.|$|E

25|$|In November 2006, declaring {{satisfaction}} with the F-35's progress to date, the government gave 'first-pass' initial approval to the project under which F-35s will be acquired, deferring to late 2008 a {{decision on whether to}} actually order the aircraft. Following this initial approval, on 13 December 2006 Australia signed the JSF Production, Sustainment and Follow-on Development Memorandum of Understanding, which commits Australia to the next phase of the F-35's development. In October 2006 the deputy chief of the Air Force, Air Vice Marshal John Blackburn, publicly stated that the RAAF had considered suitable aircraft which could be acquired if the F-35 was delayed, but that such aircraft were not believed to be necessary {{on the basis of the}} F-35 program's progress at the time. Concerns over the F-35 <b>delivery</b> <b>schedule</b> developed in Australia during 2007. In February the defence minister announced that a risk mitigation strategy, which involved obtaining F/A-18F Hornets, was being developed to prevent a gap in the RAAF's air combat capability if the F-35 program was delayed. This strategy was adopted, and an order for 24 F/A-18Fs was announced on 6 March 2007. The first aircraft was delivered in 2009 and the first squadron was declared operational in December 2010.|$|E
500|$|By the 1960s, the United States {{military}} was developing the swing-wing F-111 {{project as a}} follow-on to the Republic F-105 Thunderchief, a fast low-level fighter-bomber designed in the 1950s with an internal bay for a nuclear weapon. There had been some interest in the TSR-2 from Australia for the Royal Australian Air Force (RAAF), but in 1963, the RAAF chose to buy the F-111 instead, having been offered a better price and <b>delivery</b> <b>schedule</b> by the American manufacturer. Nonetheless, the RAAF had to wait 10 years before the F-111 was ready to enter service, by which time the anticipated programme cost had tripled. [...] The RAF was also asked to consider the F-111 as an alternative cost-saving measure. In response to suggestions of cancellation, BAC employees held a protest march, and the new Labour government, which had come to power in 1964, issued strong denials.|$|E

40|$|An optimal {{scheduling}} {{approach has}} been developed for coordinating product delivery activities using fuzzy mathematics. In this approach, optimal <b>delivery</b> <b>scheduling</b> is carried out at three different levels, for situations involving: (1) one driver and one load, (2) one driver and multiple loads, and (3) multiple drivers and multiple loads. Fuzzy-based clustering methods are employed to classify delivery tasks into driver groups, load groups, and location groups. The optimal sequence and timing parameters of delivery tasks are identified using the fuzzy mathematics based clustering results and state-space search. The intelligent optimal <b>delivery</b> <b>scheduling</b> system was implemented using Smalltalk, an object oriented programming language...|$|R
2500|$|Even {{before the}} P-36A entered production, the French Air Force entered {{negotiations}} with Curtiss for delivery of 300 aircraft.
