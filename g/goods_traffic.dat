5|$|Competition from {{road traffic}} {{starting}} {{in the early twentieth}} century put pressure on the railway, and it was later a victim of the Beeching cuts. The line was seen as unprofitable, and it closed to passengers in 1964, and to <b>goods</b> <b>traffic</b> in 1967. Part of the trackbed today provides a section of the Milton Keynes redway system.|$|E
5|$|During the First World War, an Army Remount Service depot {{was located}} nearby, with Shirehampton station {{handling}} the <b>goods</b> <b>traffic,</b> {{with up to}} 60 wagons per day inbound, mostly containing hay and sawdust for the horses. Twelve wagons of manure were dispatched each day, some to Cadbury Road on the Weston, Clevedon and Portishead Light Railway.|$|E
5|$|Passenger trains {{generally}} {{served the}} station only on weekdays, although between 1903 and 1922 trains also ran on Sundays. While {{the village of}} Westcott was small, the proximity of Baron Ferdinand de Rothschild's estate at Waddesdon Manor made Westcott one of the busier stations on the branch in terms of passenger and <b>goods</b> <b>traffic.</b>|$|E

5|$|An unusual {{feature of}} the {{railways}} in Weymouth was that until 1987 main-line trains ran though the streets and along the Weymouth Harbour Tramway to the Quay station at {{the eastern end of}} the harbour, to connect with ferries to mainland Europe. Due to declining business, <b>goods</b> <b>traffic</b> ceased in 1972, but passenger services continued until they ceased in 1987 from lack of use.|$|E
5|$|Burnham-on-Sea {{railway station}} was the {{terminus}} of the Burnham {{branch of the}} Somerset and Dorset Joint Railway, but the tracks continued onto the jetty, where ferry services to South Wales could be boarded. The station opened in 1858 as Burnham, and was renamed Burnham-on-Sea in 1920. It closed to scheduled passenger traffic in 1951 and stopped being used for excursions in 1962. It finally closed to <b>goods</b> <b>traffic</b> in 1963.|$|E
5|$|The Cuckoo Line closed {{shortly after}} the Hospital Railway. Hellingly station closed to {{passengers}} on 14June 1965, and the line closed for <b>goods</b> <b>traffic</b> on 26April 1968. The station building complete with platform is now a private residence, and the Cuckoo Line trackbed was converted to the Cuckoo Trail long-distance footpath in 1990. Much of {{the route of the}} Hospital Railway is also now a footpath.|$|E
50|$|Kraków {{is located}} on the A4 East-West highway. The road {{distance}} from Kraków to Jasná is 175 km, at least 2 hours 50 minutes by road in <b>good</b> <b>traffic</b> conditions. The road distance from Kraków to Zakopane is 110 km, 1½ hours by road in <b>good</b> <b>traffic</b> conditions. The Kraków-Zakopane road is notorious for traffic jams in high tourist season and during major sporting events. By 2022 the first 60 km will probably be expressway (S7).|$|R

5|$|The line {{ran from}} Yatton to Wells. When {{the rest of}} the line was closed and all {{passenger}} services ceased, the section of the line between Cheddar and Yatton remained open for <b>goods</b> <b>traffic.</b> It provided a fast link with the main markets for the strawberries in Birmingham and London, but finally closed in 1964, becoming part of the Cheddar Valley Railway Nature Reserve.|$|E
5|$|When the {{railways}} were nationalised in 1948, the GWR became the Western Region of British Railways. <b>Goods</b> <b>traffic</b> at Bedminster ceased from 1 June 1964, traffic to Portishead {{ended with the}} closure of that line in September the same year, and the station became unstaffed from September 1968. The signal box {{was taken out of}} service in April 1970, and by 1979 all the station buildings had been demolished.|$|E
5|$|Following a {{satisfactory}} inspection {{carried out by}} Major Marindin of the Board of Trade on 3 September 1892, the line between Paddock Wood and Hope Mill, for Goudhurst and Lamberhurst was opened to passenger and <b>goods</b> <b>traffic</b> nine days later. The first service drawn by Cudworth E1 class 2-4-0 No. 112 left Hope Mill at 08:25 and free travel was offered throughout the day. The official opening took place on 1 October 1892, and services were extended to Hawkhurst on 4 September 1893. The line was worked by the SER (soon to become the SECR) which formally absorbed the Cranbrook and Paddock Wood Railway on 29 January 1900.|$|E

5|$|Jones sought {{legal advice}} {{and was told}} that the Duke would {{probably}} win a legal action against the A The A was in such a precarious financial position that any successful legal action against them would likely have forced the line through Quainton Road to close, severing the Tramway's connection with the national network altogether. Meanwhile, local dairy farmers began to switch to beef and butter, causing a drop in milk transport. From its peak of 20,994tons carried in 1877, <b>goods</b> <b>traffic</b> fell in each of the next four years, dropping to 9,139tons (9,286t) in 1881.|$|E
5|$|Several travel guides have praised {{individual}} {{parts of}} the road, such as the section from Tyndrum to Glencoe across Rannoch Moor, as providing memorable driving experiences. Tourists find the A82 a popular route because of its scenery, and {{it serves as a}} main artery for commercial and heavy <b>goods</b> <b>traffic.</b> Transport Scotland have publicly declared a commitment to improve congestion and safety along the road. Parts of the A82 are occasionally closed for maintenance, which has resulted in strong protest from the local community, and the road has been criticised for its poor accident record.|$|E
5|$|The Great Western Railway built {{a railway}} line (the Bristol and North Somerset Railway) over {{some parts of}} the canal route from Limpley Stoke to Camerton, where it joined the {{existing}} 1882 branch line from Hallatrow to Camerton. This opened in 1910 for passenger and <b>goods</b> <b>traffic,</b> closed for the First World War, re-opened after the war but ran for passengers only for two more years in the mid-1920s and finally closed to all traffic in the 1950s. The line was used in the 1950s Ealing comedy film The Titfield Thunderbolt.|$|E

5|$|Under {{the terms}} of the {{agreement}} between the hospital authorities, the LBSCR, and its successors, the hospital authorities were obliged to keep the railway in good repair to allow its use by main-line wagons. With a greatly reduced need for <b>goods</b> <b>traffic</b> to the hospital following the conversion of the boilers, it was decided that the railway was not worth the expense of continued maintenance and necessary upgrading, and the line was officially closed on 25March 1959 following the departure of the last coal wagon.|$|E
5|$|When {{plans were}} made for a line to Stoke-on-Trent, it was {{originally}} intended for a branch to be built from Stockport to Macclesfield. Instead, the junction was built south at Cheadle Hulme. The line was constructed over four years: it opened for <b>goods</b> <b>traffic</b> as far as Poynton in June 1845, and on 24November it reached Macclesfield and was opened to the public. In June 1846 Parliament authorised {{the completion of the}} line to Stoke-on-Trent. By June 1849 the section between Congleton and Macclesfield was completed and the line was finished.|$|E
5|$|The {{construction}} of the railways in the mid-19th century made the Lake District, and Keswick in particular, more accessible to visitors of modest means. The original impetus for building the Cockermouth, Keswick and Penrith Railway (CKP) line came from heavy industry: the new Bessemer process of steelmaking brought a great demand for the rich iron ore from west Cumberland and the coking coal from Durham {{on the east side}} of the country. The CKP was built to enable ore and coal to be brought together at steel foundries in both counties. The line opened for <b>goods</b> <b>traffic</b> in 1864, and the following year it began to carry passengers. Fares varied, but holidaymakers could buy excursion tickets at discounted prices, such as six shillings for the 170-mile return journey from Preston to Keswick.|$|E
50|$|Despite said heavy defences, {{smuggling}} was rife in the Marstrand Free Port. Preventing it was however {{largely a}} futile task, with {{large amounts of}} <b>goods</b> <b>trafficked</b> from and to the Free Port, and onwards - past the royal tolls. Another problem was piracy, when in 1789 during the Russo-Swedish War a group of Russian privateers attacking Swedish shipping on the West Coast.|$|R
50|$|On 1 January 1923, {{under the}} Railways Act 1921, the North Staffordshire Railway was {{absorbed by the}} London, Midland and Scottish Railway (LMS). During {{this period of time}} the Stafford and Uttoxeter Railway, which had become part of the London and North Eastern Railway, closed to {{passengers}} on 4 December 1939, but the line remained open for <b>good</b> <b>traffic</b> until 5 March 1951.|$|R
40|$|Abstract—Communities of Interest (COI) {{have been}} studied {{in the past to}} {{classify}} traffic within an enterprise network, and to mitigate denial-of-service (DoS) attacks. We investigate the use of Communities of Interest (COIs) to prioritize known <b>good</b> <b>traffic</b> on the Internet. Under our system, an ISP may construct a COI for each of its enterprise customers. The COI would contain entities which have previously had good communications with the customer. These COIs could then be used in combination with traffic differentiating mechanisms during periods of heavy traffic in order to prioritize traffic from communicating entities known to be good. We show {{that it is possible to}} construct an effective COI from information which would be available to an ISP about its customers, specifically sampled Netflow data. We investigate various heuristics to determine which flows actually represent <b>good</b> <b>traffic</b> whose endpoint should be inserted into the COI, and show that our heuristics are effective in differentiating wanted and unwanted traffic.

5|$|When the {{railways}} were nationalised in 1948, Patchway {{came under the}} aegis of the Western Region of British Railways. In 1949, there were 11 trains towards South Wales and 13 towards Bristol each weekday, with three trains per day in each direction on Sundays. However, by 1965 this had reduced to eight trains on weekdays towards South Wales and six towards Bristol, with no Sunday service. Traffic levels fell - the station was closed to <b>goods</b> <b>traffic</b> on 5 July 1965, and subsequently had all staff withdrawn on 14 October 1968. The goods loop was taken up and the station buildings demolished, replaced by small brick shelters. The structure of the footbridge remained, but the roof was removed. The goods yard was repurposed as vehicle storage.|$|E
5|$|<b>Goods</b> <b>traffic</b> {{was more}} substantial, with fruit, hops and timber being sent out and coal being received. The 1937 {{timetable}} showed two down freight workings from Paddock Wood and one conditional working for Goudhurst, {{while in the}} other direction two conditional workings ran from Hawkhurst and one from Goudhurst. These were market trains and carried wagons for Blackfriars Goods attached to freight services at Paddock Wood. The volume of goods carried fell into steep decline after the Second World War as more and more freight was taken to market by road. Coal traffic remained constant as did the transport of pot plants from local nurseries at Flimwell and Wadhurst for F W Woolworth. This was an important source of revenue for the line with one million pot plants a year being transported from Hawkhurst, bringing in around £1,000 per week. Up to four parcels and miscellaneous vans were loaded daily at Hawkhurst and attached to the last train to Tonbridge, with further collections possibly being made at Horsmonden; special services were laid on in the busy period before Mothering Sunday.|$|E
5|$|Until 1880 the Met ran no goods trains, but goods trains {{ran over}} its tracks from 20 February 1866 when the GNR began {{a service to}} the LC via Farringdon Street, {{followed}} by a service from the Midland Railway from July 1868. The GNR, the GWR and the Midland all opened goods depots in the Farringdon area, accessed from the City Widened Lines. <b>Goods</b> <b>traffic</b> was {{to play an important}} part of Met traffic on the extension line out of Baker Street. In 1880, the Met secured the coal traffic of the Harrow District Gas Co., worked from an exchange siding with the Midland at Finchley Road to a coal yard at Harrow. Goods and coal depots were provided at most of the stations on the extension line as they were built. Goods for London were initially handled at Willesden, with delivery by road or by transfer to the Midland. The arrival of the GCR gave connections to the north at Quainton Road and south via Neasden, Acton and Kew.|$|E

40|$|The {{urgency of}} {{counteraction}} to counterfeit <b>goods</b> <b>trafficking</b> is shown. Annual loss due to counterfeit <b>goods</b> producing and <b>trafficking</b> reaches several billion dollars. There remains {{a danger of}} buying low-quality and counterfeit goods despite implementing new producing techniques and protective elements. Measures, taken by law enforcement agencies, state authorities and public human rights organizations have not led to systematic suppression of producing and <b>trafficking</b> of such <b>goods.</b> Creation of new information and reference resource, containing information blocks of protective symbols on goods and packages and illustrated materials comprising patterns of discovered counterfeit goods, can assist to increase public awareness and to give necessary information to law enforcement agencies. Organizations, realizing state and social protection of consumers and entrepreneurs, along with producers, rightholders’ representatives and law enforcement bodies can accept the responsibility of creating and functioning this information and reference system in the Internet. Such level of cooperation of all interested organizations will allow to raise efficiency of measures for counteraction to <b>trafficking</b> <b>goods</b> with violated consumer properties. The author proves the necessity to organize functioning of information and reference resource {{for a wide range}} of users. Operation of such resource should comply with main principles of generating any information resource, notably full scale, authenticity and relevance of information. The author proposes the algorithm of creating such system which provides cooperation of law enforcement agencies, producers and consumers for the purpose of preventing counterfeit <b>goods</b> <b>trafficking</b> and investigating committed crimes...|$|R
