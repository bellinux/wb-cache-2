500|$|... "The song {{has kind}} of an old school vibe to it, {{so we wanted to}} be really {{stripped}} down and really simple with the video. Every time we get the chance to work together I always try to do something a little different, you know. I hadn't seen her a do a real stripped down, really basic video. I got a taste of it when I did another video with <b>her</b> <b>where</b> <b>she</b> was a guest star, and I got her really stripped down in that but it was still in a Jamaican environment. I just wanted to put her in a really contemporary American environment and bring out the emotions in the song and the bittersweetness of it. Me and her were just vibing off that, and thought it would be really fun to do something just really simple. No visual effects, no gags. The whole strength of the video is on just the honesty of the piece, and that was sort of what we set out to do. Sometimes it's an important visual effect, today it's an important emotion." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{second story}} recounts {{the tale of}} the [...] "girl-bird" [...] Gertrude McFuzz, who has one small, plain tail feather and envies Lolla Lee Lou, who has two feathers. She goes to her uncle, Doctor Dake, for {{something}} to make her tail grow. He tries to tell her that her tail is just right for her species, but she throws a tantrum. He gives in and he tells <b>her</b> <b>where</b> <b>she</b> can find berries that will make her tail grow. The first berry makes her tail exactly like Lolla Lee Lou's, but greed overtakes her. Now wanting to surpass Lolla Lee Lou, she eats the entire vine, causing her tail to grow to an enormous size. However, the added weight of too many feathers does not allow her to fly, run or even walk. She panics by yelping repeatedly, while being stuck on the hill. Her uncle, who hears her painful yelps, sends for the rescue, and many other birds are forced to carry her home and pluck out her tail feathers, which takes a few weeks, causing her to be sore. Though she has only one feather left—as before—she now has [...] "enough, because now she is smarter." ...|$|E

[...] Kloves also said, [...] "I don't know what compelled me to say this , but I said, 'I've just got to warn you my favourite character is not Harry. My favourite character is Hermione.' And I think for some weird reason, from that moment on, she sort of trusted me." ...|$|E

Abram told Sarai that her maid was in her hands, and Sarai treated her harshly, so Hagar ran away. An angel of God found Hagar by a spring {{of water in the}} wilderness, and asked <b>her</b> <b>where</b> <b>she</b> came from and where she was going, and she replied that she was running away from her mistress. The angel told her to go back to her mistress and submit to her harsh treatment, for God would make Hagar's offspring too numerous to count; she would bear a son whom she should name Ishmael, for God had paid heed to her suffering. Ishmael would be a wild donkey of a man, with his hand against everyone, and everyone's hand against him, but he would dwell alongside his kinsmen. Hagar called God [...] "El-roi," [...] meaning that she had gone on seeing after God saw her, and the well was called Beer-lahai-roi.
