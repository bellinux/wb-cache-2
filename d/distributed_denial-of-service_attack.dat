25|$|Kaspersky Lab {{experts at}} first {{estimated}} that Stuxnet started spreading around March or April 2010, {{but the first}} variant of the worm appeared in June 2009. On 15 July 2010, the day the worm's existence became widely known, a <b>distributed</b> <b>denial-of-service</b> <b>attack</b> was made on the servers for two leading mailing lists on industrial-systems security. This attack, from an unknown source but likely related to Stuxnet, disabled one of the lists and thereby interrupted {{an important source of}} information for power plants and factories. On the other hand, researchers at Symantec have uncovered a version of the Stuxnet computer virus that was used to attack Iran's nuclear program in November 2007, being developed as early as 2005, when Iran was still setting up its uranium enrichment facility.|$|E
25|$|To {{counter the}} virus' use of {{pseudorandom}} domain names, Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers (ICANN) and several TLD registries began in February 2009 a coordinated barring of transfers and registrations for these domains. Variant D counters this by generating daily {{a pool of}} 50,000 domains across 110 TLDs, from which it randomly chooses 500 to attempt for that day. The generated domain names were also shortened from 8–11 to 4–9 characters {{to make them more}} difficult to detect with heuristics. This new pull mechanism (which was disabled until April 1, 2009) is unlikely to propagate payloads to more than 1% of infected hosts per day, but is expected to function as a seeding mechanism for the virus' peer-to-peer network. The shorter generated names, however, are expected to collide with 150–200 existing domains per day, potentially causing a <b>distributed</b> <b>denial-of-service</b> <b>attack</b> (DDoS) on sites serving those domains. However the large number of generated domains and the fact that not every domain will be contacted for a given day will probably prevent DDoS situations.|$|E

40|$|Part 1 : THEMES AND ISSUESInternational audienceThe use of botnets for {{malicious}} activities {{has grown}} significantly in recent years. Criminals leverage the flexibility and anonymity associated with botnets to harvest personal data, generate spam, distribute malware and launch <b>distributed</b> <b>denial-of-service</b> <b>attacks.</b> These same attributes readily translate to applications that can support operations in warfare. In 2007, <b>distributed</b> <b>denial-of-service</b> <b>attacks</b> launched by botnets targeted IT assets belonging to Estonian banks, newspapers and parliament. This paper explores {{the use of}} botnets as instruments of warfare. Seven scenarios are used to demonstrate how traditional applications of botnets such as spam, theft of resources and <b>distributed</b> <b>denial-of-service</b> <b>attacks</b> can have implications across the spectrum of warfare. Additionally, the paper discusses the ethical and political concerns {{associated with the use}} of botnets by nation states...|$|R
25|$|A {{distributed}} denial-of-service (DDoS) attack {{occurs when}} multiple systems flood the bandwidth or resources of a targeted system, usually {{one or more}} web servers. Such an attack is often the result of multiple compromised systems (for example, a botnet) flooding the targeted system with traffic. A botnet is a network of zombie computers programmed to receive commands without the owners' knowledge. When a server is overloaded with connections, new connections {{can no longer be}} accepted. The major advantages to an attacker of using a <b>distributed</b> <b>denial-of-service</b> <b>attack</b> are that multiple machines can generate more attack traffic than one machine, multiple attack machines are harder to turn off than one attack machine, and that the behavior of each attack machine can be stealthier, making it harder to track and shut down. These attacker advantages cause challenges for defense mechanisms. For example, merely purchasing more incoming bandwidth than the current volume of the attack might not help, because the attacker might be able to simply add more attack machines. This, after all, will end up completely crashing a website for periods of time.|$|E

Believing the threat to be a hoax, he ignored it, but a week later received a second e-mail threat: [...] "Hello u website is under us atack to stop the DDoS send us 50000$."

2500|$|Permanent denial-of-service (PDoS), {{also known}} loosely as phlashing, {{is an attack}} that damages a system so badly that it {{requires}} replacement or reinstallation of hardware. Unlike the <b>distributed</b> <b>denial-of-service</b> <b>attack,</b> a PDoS attack exploits security flaws which allow remote administration on the management interfaces of the victim's hardware, such as routers, printers, or other networking hardware. The attacker uses these vulnerabilities to replace a device's firmware with a modified, corrupt, or defective firmware image—a process which when done legitimately is known as flashing. This therefore [...] "bricks" [...] the device, rendering it unusable for its original purpose until it can be repaired or replaced.|$|E
