25|$|In {{order to}} recover {{meaningful}} signal and error free audio from a signal impaired by interference and fading, the receiver uses concatenated Reed-Solomon block coding and Forward Error Correction encoding and decoding (codec). This technique was proven {{in the early}} days of satellite modems in the late 1970s. Linkabit, then run by Irwin Jacobs prior to his involvement with Qualcomm, offered such a codec <b>for</b> <b>rack</b> mounting in satellite earth stations. The Sirius signal uses more robust error correction on control channels than on the audio content, trading off error correction and bandwidth differently for separate categories of bits in the signal waveform.|$|E

40|$|A rack {{is a set}} {{equipped}} with a bijective, self-right-distributive binary operation, and a quandle is a rack which satisfies an idempotency condition. In this paper, we introduce a new definition of modules over a rack or quandle, and show that this definition includes the one studied by Etingof and Graña [8] and the more general one given by Andruskiewitsch and Graña [1]. We further show that this definition coincides with the appropriate specialisation of the definition developed by Beck [3], and hence that these objects form a suitable category of coefficient objects in which to develop homology and cohomology theories <b>for</b> <b>racks</b> and quandles. We then develop an Abelian extension theory <b>for</b> <b>racks</b> and quandles which contains the variants developed by Carter, Elhamdadi, Kamada and Saito [5, 6] as special cases...|$|R
