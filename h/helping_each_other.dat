5|$|After Flower was {{released}} to critical praise and awards, Chen and Thatgamecompany {{moved on to}} their next game, Journey. Journey was intended by Chen {{to focus on the}} element of communication and social interaction in video games. Since in most games the communication between players is focused on specific goals, in Journey Chen intended for the player to be able to either play alone or to come across other players, but not be able to communicate with them directly. Instead, players have to build relationships with each other through their actions, <b>helping</b> <b>each</b> <b>other</b> or leaving as they choose. Journey {{was released}} on the PlayStation Network on March 13, 2012, and has received critical acclaim.|$|E
5|$|Principal {{photography}} {{began on}} May 16, 1988, in the Tabernas Desert in Spain's Almería province. Spielberg originally had planned the chase to {{be a short}} sequence shot over two days, but he drew up storyboards to make the scene an action-packed centerpiece. Thinking he would not surpass the truck chase from Raiders of the Lost Ark (because the truck was much faster than the tank), he felt this sequence should be more story-based and needed to show Indiana and Henry <b>helping</b> <b>each</b> <b>other.</b> He later said he had more fun storyboarding the sequence than filming it. The second unit had begun filming two weeks before. After approximately ten days, the production moved to Bellas Artes to film the scenes set in the Sultan of Hatay's palace. Cabo de Gata-Níjar Natural Park {{was used for the}} road, tunnel and beach sequence in which birds strike the plane. The Spanish portion of location filming finished on June 2, 1988, in Guadix, Granada, with filming of Brody's capture at İskenderun train station. The filmmakers built a mosque near the station for atmosphere, rather than adding it as a visual effect.|$|E
5|$|The pilot {{introduces}} Mick St. John, {{a private}} investigator {{who has been a}} vampire for over fifty years. Mick meets Beth Turner, a reporter for the online newspaper BuzzWire, {{at the scene of the}} murder of a young woman. Mick and Beth begin investigating the crime together, <b>helping</b> <b>each</b> <b>other</b> to catch the killer. Flashbacks to 22 years ago show a domestic fight between Mick and his ex-wife Coraline Duvall over a kidnapped girl. Mick lights the house on fire and rescues the girl, leaving Coraline to the fire. It is revealed that the little girl has grown up to be Beth, and that Mick has tried to watch over her and keep her safe over the years. In the present, Beth discovers that Mick is a vampire, and Mick reveals how one becomes a vampire and tells her the story of how he was turned by his bride, Coraline, on their wedding night.|$|E

25|$|FIRST {{seeks to}} promote a {{philosophy}} of teamwork and collaboration among engineers and encourages competing teams to remain friendly, <b>helping</b> <b>each</b> <b>other</b> out when necessary. Terms frequently applied to this ethos are Gracious Professionalism and Coopertition; terms coined by Woodie Flowers and Kamen that support respect towards one's competitors and integrity in one's actions. The concept of Gracious Professionalism grew from a robotics class that Flowers taught at Massachusetts Institute of Technology. Coopertition is patented under US Patent 7,507,169 by Dean Kamen.|$|E
25|$|The {{accompanying}} {{music video}} {{was directed by}} Chris Robinson. It premiered on VH1 on March 5, 2012. The video {{was inspired by the}} films Thelma & Louise (1991) and Waiting to Exhale (1995), and portrays the singers in dysfunctional relationships and <b>helping</b> <b>each</b> <b>other</b> in both situations. Monica and Brandy promoted the song doing several performances, radio and television interviews. The singers were also going to perform the track on the Clive Davis' Pre-Grammy Party in 2012; however, the performance was cancelled following Whitney Houston's passing.|$|E
25|$|Eukaryotic {{transcriptional}} activators {{have separate}} DNA-binding and activating functions. Upon binding to its cis-element, an activator can recruit polymerase directly or recruit other factors {{needed by the}} transcriptional machinery. An activator can also recruit nucleosome modifiers that alter chromatin {{in the vicinity of}} the promoter and thereby help initiation. Multiple activators can work together, either by recruiting a common or two mutually dependent components of the transcriptional machinery, or by <b>helping</b> <b>each</b> <b>other</b> bind to their DNA sites. These interactions can synergize multiple signaling inputs and produce intricate transcriptional responses to address cellular needs.|$|E

25|$|Outside of cricket, Vaughan {{worked for}} Shell in Ceylon {{during the early}} 1930s. Returning from Ceylon, he took up farming in 1935, buying Middle Farm in Winterbourne Monkton, Wiltshire. He married to Blanche Innes Dickson in 1937, with the couple having 3 children, with their {{daughter}} Sarah Merion Vaughan being bestowed an OBE during her life. He served in World War II with the Royal Army Service Corps, obtaining the rank of 2nd Lieutenant in 1940. He was later promoted to a full Lieutenant and later in March 1941 to a Temporary Captain. The Service Corp was later attached to the 18th Infantry Division, arriving in Singapore just 3 weeks before the Japanese invasion, which ended in a British surrender. He spent time following the surrender as a POW in the Changi Prison, before being sent {{to work on the}} Burma Railway, working there for 8 months. During his internment he came across his brother-in-law, John Austin Dickson, with the two of them <b>helping</b> <b>each</b> <b>other</b> through their captivity. His experiences during the war were rarely mentioned by him in later life.|$|E
25|$|Despite {{no longer}} {{formally}} operating as a team, Ambrose and Reigns continued to infrequently {{work together and}} maintained an on-screen friendship following The Shield's split. On the January 9, 2015 episode of SmackDown, Reigns {{was about to be}} put into a handicap match against Rollins and Big Show until Ambrose came to the aid of Reigns and helped defeat them, with the two continuously <b>helping</b> <b>each</b> <b>other</b> against The Authority thereafter. On the May 4 episode of Raw, Ambrose defeated Rollins and (as per pre-stipulation by the Director of Operations Kane) gained his first opportunity for the WWE World Heavyweight Championship, being added to the title match at Payback and making it a fatal four-way match, also including Reigns and Randy Orton, with the latter being pinned by Rollins. During the match, Ambrose, Reigns and Rollins briefly worked together to perform their signature triple powerbomb on Orton. Ambrose later faced Rollins at Elimination Chamber on May 31, which saw Reigns' involvement after multiple interference by The Authority on Rollins' behalf to help Ambrose, who won by disqualification after Rollins pushed the referee in Ambrose's way as he tried to catch the standing Rollins with his signature diving elbow drop. Despite the win, Ambrose did not gain the championship, but he still took the championship belt with him and challenged Rollins in a ladder match at Money in the Bank on June 14, which he would go on to lose.|$|E
500|$|The main {{themes of}} Catching Fire include survival, sacrifice, and the {{conflict}} between interdependence and independence. As reviewer Margo Dill noted, [...] "In , Katniss and Peeta are definitely interdependent. They are both <b>helping</b> <b>each</b> <b>other</b> to survive. As a matter of fact, they want the other one to survive {{more than they do}} themselves." [...] Dill goes on to explain how this likely increases the chances of each character dying.|$|E

After all, these are hosts that have constantly expressed how lost they feel without their writers. There's something wonderful in seeing three comedians doing each other a favor by creating some silly material and taking it this far, just to help fill time. This one dumb fight alone has taken up so many episodes. Bless their little late night hearts for <b>helping</b> <b>each</b> <b>other</b> out." ...|$|E
500|$|In addition, unlike {{preceding}} traditional Disney animated feature films, {{the developing}} romantic relationship between Mulan and Li Shang {{is treated as}} more of a subplot as opposed to a traditional central plot, as observed by film critic Andy Klein of Animation World Network. Klein commented, [...] "Mulan isn't waiting for her prince to someday come; when he does arrive, having known her primarily as a man, and having learned to admire her for her deeper qualities, the romance is muted and subtle." [...] Throughout the movie they are constantly working towards <b>helping</b> <b>each</b> <b>other</b> change into better and truer versions of themselves in order to achieve their true potential.|$|E
500|$|Reaction to the [...] "feud" [...] by {{both the}} public and the media was mostly positive. TV Squad's Annie Wu wrote: [...] "With the three hosts {{appearing}} on each other's shows all on one night, it was special appearances galore. It became a clash of the Titans, a battle of epic proportions, a heaping helping of Monday fanservice." [...] Even so, the three comedians [...] "shared a certain comedic sensibility", and admitted that they had a good time while <b>helping</b> <b>each</b> <b>other</b> out. O'Brien said: [...] "It certainly helped that all three of us [...] in a period of our careers where we're looking for content." ...|$|E

In an interview with What's on TV, when asked who Darren would choose out of Suzanne and Cindy, Dawson said, [...] "Cindy any time. He'd really {{like to make a}} go of things with her". Dawson also commented on the relationship calling the relationship [...] "interesting" [...] because Cindy is Darren's [...] "first port of call".|$|E
500|$|Narrated by Tony Hirst, {{the series}} is {{presented}} in a fly on the wall documentary format that follows {{a year in the}} lives of the residents of James Turner Street, a road in the Winson Green area of Birmingham which Channel 4 describes as [...] "one of Britain's most benefit-dependent streets". The programme portrays a situation in which people are dependent on welfare payments, and often lack the motivation to find employment. Some residents are seen committing crimes such as shoplifting, and attempting to raise money to support themselves and their families. Others are shown to have more ambition, such as a young mother who wants to become a model. The series also aims to show the street's sense of community spirit, with residents <b>helping</b> <b>each</b> <b>other</b> in times of difficulty.|$|E
500|$|After the {{confrontation}} with police turned violent, rioters began hurling rocks, smashing vehicles, breaking into shops, and attacking Han civilians. At least 1,000 Uyghurs {{were involved in}} the rioting when it began, and the number of rioters may have risen to as many as 3,000. Jane Macartney of The Times characterised the first day's rioting as consisting mainly of [...] "Han stabbed by marauding gangs of Uighurs"; a report in The Australian several months later suggested that religiously moderate Uyghurs may also have been attacked by rioters. Although the majority of rioters were Uyghur, not all Uyghurs were violent during the riots; there are accounts of Han and Uyghur civilians <b>helping</b> <b>each</b> <b>other</b> escape the violence and hide. About 1,000 police officers were dispatched; they used batons, live ammunition, tasers, tear gas and water hoses to disperse the rioters, and set up roadblocks and posted armoured vehicles throughout the city.|$|E
