5|$|If all entries of A {{below the}} main <b>diagonal</b> are zero, A {{is called a}}n upper {{triangular}} matrix. Similarly if all entries of A above the main <b>diagonal</b> are zero, A is called a lower triangular matrix. If all entries outside the main <b>diagonal</b> are zero, A is called a <b>diagonal</b> matrix.|$|E

5|$|A Sudoku with 24 clues, {{dihedral}} symmetry (symmetry on both orthogonal axis, 90° rotational symmetry, 180° rotational symmetry, and <b>diagonal</b> symmetry) {{is known}} to exist, and is also automorphic. Again here, {{it is not known}} if this number of clues is minimal for this class of Sudoku. The fewest clues in a Sudoku with two-way <b>diagonal</b> symmetry is believed to be 18, and in at least one case such a Sudoku also exhibits automorphism.|$|E
50|$|Just as a {{triangle}} has no <b>diagonals,</b> so also a tetrahedron (with four triangular faces) has no face <b>diagonals</b> and no space <b>diagonals.</b>|$|R
5000|$|A perfect parallelopiped is a parallelopiped with integer-length edges, face <b>diagonals,</b> {{and space}} <b>diagonals.</b> In 2009, dozens of perfect parallelopipeds {{were shown to}} exist, [...] {{answering}} an open question of Richard Guy. One example has edges 271, 106, and 103, minor face <b>diagonals</b> 101, 266, and 255, major face <b>diagonals</b> 183, 312, and 323, and space <b>diagonals</b> 374, 300, 278, and 272.|$|R
40|$|Abstract. We look at {{relationships}} among the lengths of <b>diagonals</b> in the reg-ular polygon. Specifically, we derive formulas for all <b>diagonals</b> {{in terms of the}} shortest <b>diagonals</b> and other formulas in terms of the next-to-shortest <b>diagonals,</b> assuming unit side length. These formulas are independent of the number of sides of the regular polygon. We also show that the formulas in terms of the shortest <b>diagonals</b> involve the famous Catalan numbers. 1...|$|R

5|$|Between 24 and 25° degrees {{southern}} latitude the Andean Dry <b>Diagonal</b> crosses the Andes. At this latitude, {{half of the}} precipitation falls in summer {{and the other half}} in winter. The formation of this dry <b>diagonal</b> is an effect both of the rainshadow effect of the Andes, air subsidence within South Pacific High, and the cold Humboldt Current off the Pacific coast. This is the reason why the Atacama Desert exists. The extremely arid climate at Llullaillaco is also a consequence of these climatic effects.|$|E

5000|$|A cuboid has twelve face <b>diagonals</b> (two {{on each of}} the six faces), and it {{has four}} space <b>diagonals.</b> The cuboid's face <b>diagonals</b> can have up to three {{different}} lengths, since the faces come in congruent pairs and the two <b>diagonals</b> on any face are equal. The cuboid's space <b>diagonals</b> all have the same length.

5|$|The Bc5 may {{not seem}} {{particularly}} useful in this attack, but by eyeing e3 it {{makes it difficult for}} White to play f4 to chase away the black knight; furthermore, the attack on e3 is sometimes intensified with major pieces doubling on the e-file. Besides, the Bc5 can sometimes be recycled to the b8–h2 <b>diagonal</b> via Bc5–a7–b8, to apply still more pressure on h2. It can also stay on the a7–g1 <b>diagonal</b> to put pressure on f2, if White pushes e3–e4 at some stage.|$|E
5|$|The <b>diagonal</b> {{positioning}} of the metalloids represents {{an exception to the}} observation that elements with similar properties tend to occur in vertical groups. A related effect can be seen in other <b>diagonal</b> similarities between some elements and their lower right neighbours, specifically lithium-magnesium, beryllium-aluminium, and boron-silicon. Rayner-Canham has argued that these similarities extend to carbon-phosphorus, nitrogen-sulfur, and into three d-block series.|$|E

The maid to the left faces the light, her brightly lit profile and sleeve creating a <b>diagonal.</b> Her opposite number creates a broader but less defined reflection of her attention, making a <b>diagonal</b> space between them, in which their charge stands protected.|$|E

5|$|A {{common and}} popular {{structural}} alignment method is the DALI, or distance alignment matrix method, which breaks the input structures into hexapeptide fragments and calculates a distance matrix by evaluating the contact patterns between successive fragments. Secondary structure features that involve residues that are contiguous in sequence {{appear on the}} matrix's main diagonal; other diagonals in the matrix reflect spatial contacts between residues that are not near {{each other in the}} sequence. When these diagonals are parallel to the main <b>diagonal,</b> the features they represent are parallel; when they are perpendicular, their features are antiparallel. This representation is memory-intensive because the features in the square matrix are symmetrical (and thus redundant) about the main <b>diagonal.</b>|$|E
5|$|Adjacent to the {{pituitary}} lies {{a part of}} {{the skull}} base known as the cavernous sinus. This contains a number of nerves that control the eye muscles. 70% of people with pituitary apoplexy experience double vision due to compression of one of the nerves. In half of these cases, the oculomotor nerve (the third cranial nerve), which controls a number of eye muscles, is affected. This leads to <b>diagonal</b> double vision and a dilated pupil. The fourth (trochlear) and sixth (abducens) cranial nerves are located in the same compartment and can cause <b>diagonal</b> or horizontal double vision, respectively. The oculomotor nerve is predominantly affected as it lies closest to the pituitary. The cavernous sinus also contains the carotid artery, which supplies blood to the brain; occasionally, compression of the artery can lead to one-sided weakness and other symptoms of stroke.|$|E

5|$|Schumacher's {{original}} helmet sported the colours of the German {{flag and}} his sponsor's decals. On {{the top was}} a blue circle with white astroids. When Jos Verstappen was his teammate, Schumacher added four red <b>diagonal</b> strokes over the visor to differentiate his helmet from his teammate. After Schumacher joined Ferrari a prancing horse was added on the back. From the 2000 Monaco Grand Prix, in order to differentiate his colours from his new teammate Rubens Barrichello, Schumacher changed the upper blue colour {{and some of the}} white areas to red. Since 2004, the helmet sported a white <b>diagonal</b> line with a white vertical line in the zone of the German Flag colours (originally to accommodate sponsor AMD), but then these lines remained in the Suzuka 2006 design.|$|E
