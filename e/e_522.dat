Analysis of protein trafficking and subcellular localization of the wild-type kidney isoform of human anion exchanger 1 and these mutants transfected into MDCK cells showed they formed homodimers or heterodimers with each other.

40|$|The major {{inducible}} 70 -kDa {{heat shock}} protein (hsp 72) increases measles virus (MV) transcription and genome replication. This stimulatory effect is attributed to hsp 72 interaction with two highly conserved hydrophobic domains in the nucleocapsid protein (N) C terminus of Edmonston MV. These domains are known as Box- 2 and Box- 3. A single amino acid substitution in Box- 3 of Edmonston MV (i. <b>e.,</b> N <b>522</b> D) disrupts hsp 72 binding. The prevalence of the N 522 D substitution in contemporary wild-type MV isolates suggests that this sequence has been positively selected.

We designed a novel human osteonectin promoter (hON- <b>522</b> <b>E)</b> containing positive transcriptional regulatory elements identified in both the promoter and exon 1 region of the human osteonectin gene. In vitro reporter assays revealed that the hON- <b>522</b> <b>E</b> promoter is highly active in androgen receptor negative and metastatic prostate cancer and bone stromal cells compared to androgen receptor-positive prostate cancer cells. Moreover, in vivo prostate-tumor-promoting activity of the hON- <b>522</b> <b>E</b> promoter was confirmed by intravenous administration of an adenoviral vector containing the hON- <b>522</b> <b>E</b> promoter-driven luciferase gene (Ad- 522 E-Luc) into mice bearing orthotopic human prostate tumor xenografts.

Despite the relevance of febrile episodes to viral pathogenesis and the multiple in vitro roles of heat shock proteins in viral replication and gene expression, the in vivo significance of virus-heat shock protein interactions is unknown. The present work determined the in vivo relationship between hsp 72 levels and neurovirulence of an hsp 72 -responsive virus using the mouse model of measles virus (MV) encephalitis. Transgenic C 57 BL/ 6 mice were created to constitutively overexpress hsp 72 in neurons, and these mice were inoculated intracranially with Edmonston MV (Ed MV) at 42 h of age. The mean viral RNA burden in brain was approximately 2 orders of magnitude higher in transgenic animals than in nontransgenic animals 2 to 4 weeks postinfection, and this increased burden {{was associated with a}} fivefold increase in mortality. Mice were also challenged with an Ed MV variant exhibiting an attenuated in vitro response to hsp 72 -dependent stimulation of viral transcription (<b>Ed</b> N- <b>522</b> D).

Guided by the FhuA crystal structure and derived predictions on how FhuA might function, mutants were {{isolated in the}} cork domain (residues 1 to 160) and in the β-barrel domain (residues 161 to 714). Deletion of the TonB box (residues 7 to 11) completely inactivated all TonB-dependent functions of FhuA. Fixation of the cork to turn 7 of the barrel through a disulfide bridge between introduced C 27 and C 533 residues abolished ferrichrome transport, which was restored by reduction of the disulfide bond. Deletion of residues 24 to 31, including the switch helix (residues 24 to 29), which upon binding of ferrichrome to FhuA undergoes a large structural transition (17 Å) and exposes the N terminus of FhuA (TonB box) to the periplasm, reduced FhuA transport activity (79 % of the wild-type activity) but conferred full sensitivity to colicin M and the phages. Duplication of residues 23 to 30 or deletion of residues 13 to 20 resulted in FhuA derivatives with properties {{similar to those of}} FhuA with a deletion of residues 24 to 31. However, a frameshift mutation that changed QSEA at positions 18 to 21 to KKAP abolished almost completely most of FhuA's activities. The conserved residues R 93 and R 133 among energy-coupled outer membrane transporters are thought to fix the cork to the β-barrel by forming salt bridges to the conserved residues <b>E</b> <b>522</b> and E 571 of the β-barrel. Proteins with the <b>E</b> <b>522</b> R and E 571 R mutations were inactive, but inactivity was not caused by repulsion of R 93 by R 522 and R 571 and of R 133 by R 571. Point mutations in the cork at sites that move or do not move upon the binding of ferrichrome had no effect or conferred only slightly reduced activities. It is concluded that the TonB box is essential for FhuA activity. The TonB box region has to be flexible, but its distance from the cork domain can greatly vary.

40|$|Abstract Background Both {{cell-free}} and cell-associated infection routes {{are important}} for retroviral dissemination. Regardless of the mechanism, {{the driving force of}} retroviral entry is the interaction between the viral envelope and its receptor. To date it remains unclear how decreased affinity of viruses for their receptors affects viral cell-free infection, cell-cell transmission, and spreading kinetics. We have previously characterized a mutant form of the amphotropic murine retrovirus receptor human phosphate transporter 2 (PiT 2) wherein the single substitution of a glutamic acid for the lysine residue at position 522 of this receptor is sufficient to render it to function as a gibbon ape leukemia virus (GALV) receptor. Results In this study we analyzed the binding affinity of the mutant receptor PiT 2 K <b>522</b> <b>E</b> and determined that it has a 1000 fold decreased GALV envelope binding affinity compared to the GALV wild type receptor. The decreased affinity does not restrict the initiation of cell-free GALV infection. The diminished binding affinity does, however, correlate with a decrease in the ability of GALV to spread in cells expressing this mutant receptor. Conclusions The reduced ability of GALV to subsequently spread among cells expressing PiT 2 K <b>522</b> <b>E</b> is likely resulted from reduced cell-cell transmission, the decreased ability of PiT 2 K 522 E-expressing cells to establish superinfection interference, and attendant cytopathic affects. </p...|$|R

Each mutation was systematically analyzed for TRKA glycosylation states, intracellular and cell membrane expression patterns, nerve growth factor stimulated TRKA autophosphorylation, TRKA-Y 496 phosphorylation, PLCγ activity and neurite outgrowth. We showed a diverse range of functional effects: one mutation appeared fully functional, another had partial activity in all assays, one mutation affected only the PLCγ pathway and four mutations were proved null in all assays. Thus, we conclude that complete abolition of TRKA kinase activity is not the only pathogenic mechanism underlying HSAN IV. By corollary, the assessment of the clinical pathogenicity of HSAN IV mutations is more complex than initially predicted and requires a multifaceted approach.

40|$|A {{number of}} {{specific}} point mutations {{in the human}} cytomegalovirus (HCMV) DNA polymerase (UL 54) gene have been tentatively associated with decreased susceptibility to antiviral agents and consequently with clinical failure. To precisely determine the roles of UL 54 mutations in HCMV drug resistance, recombinant UL 54 mutant viruses were generated by using cotransfection of nine overlapping HCMV DNA fragments into permissive fibroblasts, and their drug susceptibility profiles were determined. Amino acid substitutions located in UL 54 conserved region IV (N 408 D, F 412 C, and F 412 V), region V (A 987 G), and δ-region C (L 501 I, K 513 <b>E,</b> P <b>522</b> S, and L 545 S) conferred various levels of resistance to cidofovir and ganciclovir. Mutations in region II (T 700 A and V 715 M) and region VI (V 781 I) were associated with resistance to foscarnet and adefovir. The region II mutations also conferred moderate resistance to lobucavir. In contrast to mutations in other UL 54 conserved regions, those residing specifically in region III (L 802 M, K 805 Q, and T 821 I) were associated with various drug susceptibility profiles. Mutations located outside the known UL 54 conserved regions (S 676 G and V 759 M) did not confer any significant changes in HCMV drug susceptibility. Predominantly an additive effect of multiple UL 54 mutations {{with respect to the}} final drug resistance phenotype was demonstrated. Finally, the influence of selected UL 54 mutations on the susceptibility of viral DNA replication to antiviral drugs was characterized by using a transient-transfection-plus-infection assay. Results of this work exemplify specific roles of the UL 54 conserved regions in the development of HCMV drug resistance and may help guide optimization of HCMV therapy...|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT 1 Transient {{hyperthermia}} such as {{that experienced}} during febrile episodes increases 2 expression of the major inducible 70 kDa heat shock protein (hsp 72). Despite the 3 relevance of febrile episodes to viral pathogenesis and the multiple in vitro roles of heat 4 shock proteins in viral replication and gene expression, the in vivo significance of virus- 5 heat shock protein interaction is unknown. The present work determined the in vivo 6 relationship between hsp 72 levels and neurovirulence of an hsp 72 -responsive virus using 7 the mouse model of measles virus (MV) encephalitis. Transgenic C 57 BL/ 6 mice were 8 created to constitutively overexpress hsp 72 in neurons, and these mice were inoculated 9 intracranially with Edmonston MV (Ed MV) at 42 h of age. Mean viral RNA burden in 10 brain was approximately two orders of magnitude higher in transgenic versus non- 11 transgenic animals at 2 - 4 weeks PI, and this increased burden {{was associated with a}} five- 12 fold increase in mortality.

MÉTODOS: Foram estudados 6. 223 partos em 1978 / 79 <b>e</b> 2. <b>522</b> em 1994, excluindo-se os RN de baixo peso. Associação entre PI e variáveis independentes (idade, trabalho, escolaridade e tabagismo maternos, abortos e natimortos prévios, número de filhos, situação conjugal, visitas de pré-natal, tipo de parto e hospital, categoria de internação, renda familiar, idade gestacional e sexo do RN) foi analisada por cálculo da Odds Ratio (OR) bruto e intervalo de confiança 95 %, seguida de regressão logística múltipla. RESULTADOS: Em 1978 / 79, na análise ajustada, idade materna OBJECTIVE: To {{evaluate}} {{factors associated}} {{to the increase}} in insufficient birth weight (IBW) rates in two population-based-cohorts of singletons born alive in Ribeirão Preto, São Paulo, Brazil, separated by 15 years (1978 / 79 and 1994). METHODS: The first cohort (1978 / 79) comprised 6, 223 newborns and the second (1994), 2, 522, excluding low birth weight newborns. Independent variables association with IBW (maternal age, work, schooling and smoking; previous abortion, previous stillbirth, number of live births, maternal marital status, family income, occupation group, type of hospital, mode of insurance, number of antenatal visits, type of delivery; newborn gender and gestational age) were analyzed. The Odds Ratio (OR) was determined using a logistic regression model and 95 % confidence limits were calculated. RESULTS: In 1978 / 79, maternal age < 20 years (p= 0. 014), family income < 5 minimum Brazilian wages (p= 0. 030), < 4 antenatal visits (p= 0. 003), vaginal delivery (p< 0. 001), female newborn gender (p< 0. 001), maternal smoking (p< 0. 001) and preterm birth (p< 0. 001) were associated with IBW. In 1994, maternal work outside home (p= 0. 020), female newborn gender (p< 0. 001), maternal smoking (p< 0. 001) and preterm births (p< 0. 001) were associated with IBW. CONCLUSIONS: Socioeconomics variables associated with IBW in 1978 / 79 were not determinants in 1994. Newborn gender, maternal smoking and preterm birth remained significant determinants of IBW in both moments. Considering the decrease in rate of maternal smoking and the maintenance of female births, the increase in IBW could be explained by increasing rates of preterm birth in this interval of 15 years...|$|R
30|$|The {{ratification}} of the Kyoto Protocol by most countries realized the possibility of celebrating a new international agreement in 2018 (UNFCCC 2008). Argentina, as a party of the UNFCCC, is committed to reporting GHG emissions from sources and removal by sinks to the United Nations’ national inventories. Land use change and forest activities now require a GHG inventory, since article 3.3 of the Kyoto Protocol allows increases in C stocks due to afforestation and reforestation, {{to be used to}} offset inventory emissions. The term “inventory emissions” implies a detailed quantification and report, on a yearly basis, of GHG emitted by a country’s different economic and productive activities (industry, agriculture, services, etc.), and also includes the emissions due to ecosystem degradation. Carbon reservoirs and CO 2 emissions by wildfires have been investigated by several authors in different countries (Crutzen and Andreae 1990, Fernandes 2005, Wiedinmyer and Neff 2007). In Patagonia, however, the only studies that dealt with C reservoirs of native forests were done in the southernmost region of Argentina and Chile in Tierra del Fuego (Ellyson 2007, Valdés Barrera 2012), and none were related to C emissions due to wildfires. In Argentina, the National Inventory of GHG (INVGEI), showed emissions of 238 700 Gg of carbon dioxide equivalent (CO 2 <b>e),</b> of which <b>5.22</b> % (12 460 Gg) corresponded to biomass burning from forests, grasslands, and shrublands (Fundación Bariloche 2007). Despite this report, there are no specific data of GHG emissions from fires and CO 2 uptake by forests of the central Patagonian Andean region of Argentina.|$|R

A. tridentata became more enriched (<b>e.</b> g., hepatopancreas, <b>522</b> %) than P. erythrodactyla (110 %), and A. beccarii (245 %) became more enriched than T. inflata (12 %). Addition of labeled mangrove detritus (211. 5 % final enrichment vs. 228. 8 % for controls) to sediment resulted in enrichment of P. erythrodactyla (hepatopancreas, 221. 2 % vs. 226. 6 % for controls), A. tridentata (hepatopancreas, 224. 2 % vs. 227. 1 %) and A. beccarii (221. 0 % vs. 225. 1 %) within 7 d. Compartment modeling showed that MPB contributed 93 % of the nutrition for A. tridentata and 33 % of the nutrition for P. erythrodactyla and that MPB provided more nutrition to A. beccarii (14 %) than to T. inflata (minimal). There was a complementary estimated contribution of mangrove detritus to the diets of P. erythrodactyla (80 %), A. beccarii (97 %), and A. tridentata (minimal), although these estimates should be viewed with caution, due to low initial enrichment and the apparent short temporal persistence of 13 C-labeled detritus added to sediments. T. inflata was barely enriched in either experiment and may rely on a carbon source not considered.

This study describes the purification of the enzyme from <b>E.</b> coli NM <b>522</b> and subsequent cloning into the pT 77 RNA polymerase promoter expression system, as well as detailed analyses of both the cleavage and condensation reactions for the aldolase, under a variety of different conditions including buffer type, ionic strength, pH, substrate excess and co-solvents. Investigations into the affinity of DDG aldolase {{for a wide range of}} aldehydes have established that the enzyme only forms condensation compounds with configuration R at the new stereogenic centre and shows no selectivity towards the configuration at positions C- 2 and C- 3 of the substrate. DDG aldolase also displays a greater tolerance to electrophilic substrate type than that currently reported for the type 1 aldolases, notably fructose- 1, 6 -bisphosphate aldolase. Where applicable, a selection of novel condensation compounds have been purified and characterised and a suitable method of large scale production of said compounds presented. Crystal structures of the recombinant and seleno-methionine isoforms are also presented, establishing that DDG aldolase is a homo-hexamer of subunit molecular weight 27. 4 kDa, with the promoter displaying a modified (/) 8 barrel fold.

However, discrimination between mutations responsible for drug resistance {{and those that}} are part of viral polymorphism can be difficult with current methodologies. A new system is reported for rapid generation of recombinant HSV type 1 (HSV- 1) DNA Pol mutants based on transfection of a set of overlapping viral cosmids and plasmids. With this approach, twenty HSV- 1 recombinants with single or dual mutations within the DNA pol gene were successfully generated and subsequently evaluated for their susceptibilities to acyclovir (ACV), foscarnet (FOS), cidofovir (CDV), and adefovir (ADV). Mutations within DNA Pol conserved regions II (A 719 T and S 724 N), VI (L 778 M, D 780 N, and L 782 I), and I (F 891 C) were shown to induce cross-resistance to ACV, FOS, and ADV, with two of these mutations (S 724 N and L 778 M) also conferring significant reduction in CDV susceptibility. Mutant F 891 C was associated with the highest levels of resistance towards ACV and FOS and was strongly impaired in its replication capacity. One mutation (D 907 V) lying outside of the conserved regions was also associated with this ACV-, FOS-, and ADV-resistant phenotype. Some mutations (K <b>522</b> <b>E</b> and Y 577 H) within the δ-region C were lethal, whereas others (P 561 S and V 573 M) induced no resistance to any of the drugs tested. Recombinants harboring mutations within conserved regions V (N 961 K) and VII (Y 941 H) were resistant to ACV but susceptible to FOS. Finally, mutations within conserved region III were associated with various susceptibility profiles. This new system allows a rapid and accurate evaluation of the functional role of various DNA Pol mutations, which should translate into improved management of drug-resistant HSV infections...|$|R

All our targets have similar (R − I) c colour. This is an advantage and facilitates the determination of the narrowest line profiles for v sin i ∼ 0. In our total sample, we detected rotation for 22 stars (three dK 5 e and 19 dK 5 stars), and we did not detect rotation in a further 22 stars. This result shows that there are many dK 5 slow rotators, and many more than for dM 1 stars. We also report on a newly discovered dK 5 <b>e</b> star, McC <b>522,</b> which is also the fastest rotator in our sample. We determine radii and effective temperatures for all our target stars. The effective temperatures were derived using the (R − I) c colour and empirical far-red colour–effective temperature correlations, and the radii were derived from the standard formulae relating Mbol, bolometric correction and Teff. We find that the distribution of P/sin i (the projected rotation period) is rather homogeneous, i. e. the distribution of the 22 detected stars as a function of P/sin i is approximately flat and does not show any maximum, unlike for dM 1 stars, a close spectral type.

He accomplished his philosophical studies at the Sorbonne, Paris 1, where he was strongly influenced by the French philosopher Jacques Bouveresse, and by the French philosopher and musicologist Vladimir Jankélévitch. After working on Hegel's Aesthetics, his Doctoral Studies and Thesis on Wittgenstein was specifically focused on the aesthetic and cultural dimensions of Ludwig Wittgenstein's Philosophical corpus, in relation with Austrian/German culture and Music. Marc Jean-Bernard received his Doctorate in Philosophy at the Sorbonne (Paris 1) for his thesis on Wittgenstein under the direction of Professor Jacques Bouveresse. At the same, time he started an active career as a classical guitarist, conductor and musicologist. He started studying Music formally {{at a very early age}} and developed since 1978 a career of classical musician and performed extensively worldwide as a soloist and conductor until 2000. He dedicated as well himself to philosophical, academic and diplomatic activities. Since his new public appearance in June 2015 in London5, Marc Jean-Bernard returned successfully to the concert halls in Europe and South America, as a conductor, soloist and a lecturer in the frame of Concert-Lectures.Having been also trained with American composers and virtuosos, his strong interest and competencies in South American Music, Literature and Culture led him to investigate in a Wittgenstein's way -and interpret as well- narrative and mythical dimensions of Latin American Music.His life took on a Latin-American flavor with a move to Colombia, where he combined the teaching of Philosophy of Language at the Public University with the post of Dean of the Music Faculty at a leading Conservatory. Until 2004, Marc Jean-Bernard's professional life was divided between the worlds of philosophy and music. In that year, a third world was added to them with his nomination as ad honorem Consul of France in Puerto Rico. [...] Currently, Professor of Humanities at the University of Puerto Rico, he maintains his interests in the Culture Theory and the Philosophy of the Arts, the subjects of many essays and papers in French, English and Spanish. He also pursues his musical activities, some of which have been recorded on French labels. He is also active in his consular mission, which is particularly involved in the development of European Studies, through bilateral agreements with overseas universities. Since 2009, Dr. Marc Jean-Bernard is the Director of an International Studies Program at the University of Puerto Rico. His current investigations and publications on this subject are dedicated to the dialogue between Europe and America, with a topical emphasis on Latin America from a perspective articulating International Relations and Culture.

40|$|Her- 2 /neu (human {{epidermal}} {{growth factor}} receptor 2) steht als Onkogen im Mittelpunkt vieler Bestrebungen ein therapeutisches Mittel gegen Brustkrebs zu entwickeln. Als Mitglied der Familie der epidermalen Wachstumsfaktorrezeptoren (EGFR) ist es in 30 % der Brust-und Prostatakarzinomen überexprimiert und ist mit einem progressiven Verlauf der Krankheit und einer hohen Rückfallquote verbunden. Teilstrukturen dieses Oberflächenrezeptors zeigten in Immunisierungsstudien an Mäusen bereits Induktion von anti Her- 2 /neu Antikörper, die eine Inhibition des Tumorwachstums zur Folge hatte. Ziel dieser Arbeit war es die Bacterial Ghost Platform Technology als Delivery System dieser Teilstrukturen einzusetzen. Dafür sollten die Peptidsequenzen P 4, P 6 und P 7 - lineare Epitope von Her- 2 /neu gekoppelt als Multiepitop p 467, ebenso wie das Konformationsepitop, Herzeptin Mimotop (hm), in den Vektor pMal-p 2 x kloniert und in E. coli transformiert werden. Der resultierende Vektor (pMal- 467, pMal-hm) erzeugt durch IPTG-Induktion eine Maltose-Bindeprotein (MBP) Fusion mit dem Peptid (MBP- 467, MBP-hm) und die Signalsequenz von MBP leitet das Fusionsprotein in das Periplasma des Bakteriums. Das Periplasma sollte vor allem dem über Schwefelbrücken zirkularisierten Herzeptin Mimotop durch die oxydative Umgebung gute Voraussetzungen bieten, um die vorgesehene Konformation, die ja nur als solche immunogen ist, einzunehmen. Zur Produktion von Bacterial Ghosts (BGs) wird die Expression von Fusionsproteinen mit nachgeschalteter Protein E vermittelter Lyse durchgeführt. Resultat ist eine nicht lebensfähige Bakterienhülle, deren periplasmatischer Raum mit dem Fusionsprotein gefüllt ist. Diese mit Tumorantigenen bestückten BGs sind als Vakzin konzipiert, das durch aktive Immunisierung eine präventive Langzeitimmunität gegen Brutkrebs erzeugen soll. In Vorversuchen wurde die erfolgreiche Expression des Fusionsproteins MBP- 467 mit p 467 spezifischen Antiseren mittels Western Blot Analyse nachgewiesen und es wurde eine Lyseeffizienz von 99. 9 % erreicht. Daraufhin wurden <b>E.</b> coli NM <b>522</b> (pGLysivb, pMal- 467) BGs in einem 20 l Fermenter produziert und das fertige Produkt in einer Immunisierungstudie an Balb-c Mäusen getestet. Es konnte eine Induktion peptidspezifischer Antikörper nachgewiesen werden. Vorversuche für das zyklische Herzeptin Mimotop verliefen im Rahmen dieser Arbeit nicht erfolgreich. DNA Sequenzierung des klonierten Vektors pMal-hm zeigte zwar, dass das Mimotop im korrekten Leserahmen war und somit als Fusionsprotein erzeugt werden sollte, aber ein eindeutiger Nachweis über den Her- 2 /neu spezifischen Antikörper Trastuzumab (Handelsname Herzeptin) gelang nicht. Der Nachweis über den MBP-Teil zeigte in der Western Blot Analyse vermutlich überwiegend ein Abbauprodukt des Fusionsproteins, nur bei einzelnen Klonen war eine schwache Bande für die zu erwartende Peptidgröße sichtbar. Das Ausmaß der Expression, des Transports und der korrekten Faltung des Proteins war also entweder für einen Nachweis zu gering, oder das Fusionsprotein war instabil und wurde abgebaut. In the development of therapeutic agents for treatment of breast cancer, many studies focus on Her- 2 /neu (human {{epidermal growth factor}} receptor 2). This oncogen that {{is a member of}} the human epidermal growth factor- receptor- family (EGFR) is over expressed in 30 % of breast and prostate carcinoma and linked to poor prognosis and a high cancer relapse. Peptide structures displaying parts of the extracellular domain of Her- 2 /neu showed in immunization experiments of mice already induction of Her- 2 /neu-specific antibodies inhibiting tumor progression. The aim of this work was to use these extracellular structures for Delivery by the Bacterial Ghost Platform Technology. For this, the peptide sequences P 4, P 6 and P 7 - linear epitopes of Her- 2 /neu – should be coupled as multiepitope and as well as the conformational epitope of Her- 2 /neu, herceptin mimotope (hm), cloned into the vector pMal-p 2 x (resulting in pMal- 467, pMal-hm) and transformed into E. coli. By induction with IPTG a fusion protein of the maltose binding protein (MBP) and the peptide is produced (MBP- 467, MBP-hm). The signal sequence of MBP directs the fusion protein to the periplasmic space. The oxidative surrounding of the periplasmic space should enable disulfide bridging especially for the circularized herceptin mimotope - which is very important since the natural conformation is essential for immunogenicity. Production of Bacterial Ghosts (BGs) is accomplished by expression of these fusion proteins - followed by E-mediated lysis resulting in non-living bacterial cell envelopes carrying the desired fusion proteins in the PPS. Active immunization with tumor antigen loaded BGs should generate preventive long term immunity against breast cancer. Preliminary studies prove expression of MBP- 467 by detection with p 467 specific antisera in Western blot analysis. Lysis efficiency resulted in 99. 9 % and <b>E.</b> coli NM <b>522</b> (pGLysivb, pMal- 467) was used for BG production in a 20 l Techfors fermenter. The final product was tested in immunization studies using BALB-c mice and showed induction of p 467 specific antibodies. Preliminary experiments for detection of the circularized herceptin mimotope were not successful. Although DNA-sequencing of the vector showed the mimotope in the correct reading frame, detection with the monoclonal antibody Trastuzumab (trademark Herceptin) was not possible. Detection of the MBP portion by western blot analysis showed mainly a degradation product of the fusion protein and only for individual clones a faint band at the anticipated molecular weight of the target protein. The degree of expression, transport or correct folding of the protein was either too low to be detected or due to instability the fusion protein was degraded...|$|R
