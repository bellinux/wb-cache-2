25|$|GPS {{compasses}} {{share the}} main advantages of <b>gyrocompasses.</b> They determine true North, {{as opposed to}} magnetic North, and they are unaffected by perturbations of the Earth's magnetic field. Additionally, compared with <b>gyrocompasses,</b> they are much cheaper, they work better in polar regions, they are less prone {{to be affected by}} mechanical vibration, and they can be initialized far more quickly. However, they depend on the functioning of, and communication with, the GPS satellites, which might be disrupted by an electronic attack or by the effects of a severe solar storm. <b>Gyrocompasses</b> remain in use for military purposes (especially in submarines, where magnetic and GPS compasses are useless), but have been largely superseded by GPS compasses, with magnetic backups, in civilian contexts.|$|E
25|$|Unlike a {{directional}} gyro or heading indicator, a gyrocompass seeks north. It detects {{the rotation of}} the Earth about its axis and seeks the true north, rather than the magnetic north. <b>Gyrocompasses</b> usually have built-in damping to prevent overshoot when re-calibrating from sudden movement.|$|E
50|$|The first {{generation}} of <b>gyrocompass</b> was based on fast-spinning discs and was requiring complex mechanics such as guimbals of fluid suspended platform. The first pratical apparatus were installed onboard vessels {{at the beginning of}} the XXth century.The fibre optic <b>gyrocompass</b> is the first strapdwon <b>gyrocompass.</b> Theirs sensors are simply strapped to the chassis of the <b>gyrocompass,</b> this avoids to require complex mechanics. The first fibre optic <b>gyrocompass</b> appeared on the market at the end of the XXth century but did not totally superseded the original gyrocompass.A second generation of strapdown <b>gyrocompass</b> based on HRG technology, is now also available on the market.|$|R
40|$|Abstract. <b>Gyrocompass</b> is an {{important}} instrument which provides course to vessels, but its complex three-dimensional structure and principle of pointing towards the North is a bottleneck of studying <b>gyrocompass.</b> The master compass of Anschütz 4 <b>gyrocompass</b> are simulated by virtual reality modeling language VRML, so that using three-dimensional interactive to show {{the structure of the}} <b>gyrocompass</b> and the work principle is implemented and learners will have a direct cognition to each part of the <b>gyrocompass</b> and its work principle. The realization process of simulation in the virtual reality environment is described in detail and the relevant source codes is given...|$|R
5000|$|The HRG <b>gyrocompass</b> is a {{complete}} unit, which unlike a conventional compass, has no rotating or other moving parts. It uses Hemispherical Resonant gyroscope, accelerometers and computers to compute True north. It has outstanding reliability. Its Mean Time Between Failure (MTBF) value is a multiple of the MTBF values of fibre optical <b>gyrocompass</b> but also conventional mechanical gyros.The HRG <b>gyrocompass</b> is also immune to severe environmental conditions ...|$|R
25|$|Applications of {{gyroscopes}} include {{inertial navigation}} systems, {{such as in}} the Hubble telescope, or inside the steel hull of a submerged submarine. Due to their precision, gyroscopes are also used in gyrotheodolites to maintain direction in tunnel mining. Gyroscopes can be used to construct <b>gyrocompasses,</b> which complement or replace magnetic compasses (in ships, aircraft and spacecraft, vehicles in general), to assist in stability (bicycles, motorcycles, and ships) or be used as part of an inertial guidance system.|$|E
25|$|Dynamic {{positioning}} (DP) is a {{computer-controlled system}} to automatically maintain a vessel's position and heading by using its own propellers and thrusters. Position reference sensors, combined with wind sensors, motion sensors and <b>gyrocompasses,</b> provide {{information to the}} computer pertaining to the vessel's position and the magnitude and direction of environmental forces affecting its position. Examples of vessel types that employ DP include, {{but are not limited}} to, ships and semi-submersible mobile offshore drilling units (MODU), oceanographic research vessels, cable layer ships and cruise ships.|$|E
25|$|A major {{difference}} between the RN vessels and the RCN, USN, and other navies' vessels was the provision of upgraded ASDIC and radar. The RN was a world leader in developing these technologies, and thus RN Flowers were somewhat better-equipped for remote detection of enemy submarines. A {{good example of this}} is the difficulty that RCN Flowers had in intercepting U-boats with their Canadian-designed SW1C metric radar, while the RN vessels were equipped with the technologically advanced Type 271 centimetric sets. In addition, RCN vessels were incapable of operating <b>gyrocompasses,</b> making ASDIC attacks more difficult.|$|E

Particular attention {{is given to the}} on-orbit performance of the Extended <b>Gyrocompass</b> Controller used during quaternion initialization and Update Filter convergence processing, both of these procedures requiring maintenance of the spacecraft attitude control and knowledge. The development of the Extended <b>Gyrocompass</b> control technique is reviewed, and the results of the on-orbit yaw attitude control and knowledge performance provided by this algorithm are presented...|$|R
40|$|Land combat {{vehicles}} are inevitably {{subject to the}} vibration disturbance by wind gust or engine idling, etc. in the stationary initial alignment process of the Strapdown Inertial Navigation System (SINS). Obviously, it’s necessary to consider the impact of vibration disturbance during the alignment process to achieve better performance. In order to guarantee the alignment accuracy on the rocking base and shorten the convergence time of alignment, a <b>gyrocompass</b> alignment method of SINS based on Kalman filter pretreatment and dynamic gain adjustment was proposed. The output of gyros and accelerometers was firstly pre-filtered by Kalman filter to remove the impact of high-frequency small-amplitude rocking interference. The low-frequency large-amplitude rocking interference on vehicle was tracked through dynamic gain adjustment of <b>gyrocompass</b> alignment. The vehicle test of a ring laser SINS showed that the new <b>gyrocompass</b> alignment method can suppress high-frequency disturbances when the vehicle underwent low-frequency large-amplitude rocking interference. And the alignment process can track the attitude change of vehicle caused by low-frequency large-amplitude rocking interference. Comparing with traditional <b>gyrocompass</b> alignment algorithm and Kalman filter alignment method, {{the performance of the}} new <b>gyrocompass</b> alignment method is much improved by filtering random noise caused by vibration disturbance of vehicle effectively...|$|R
25|$|For other {{operation}}s, such as diving {{and heavy}} lifting, {{there is a}} risk of damage or injuries. Depending on the risk, the operation is done in Class 2 or 3. This means at least three Position reference systems should be selected. This allows the principle of voting logic, so the failing PRS can be found. For this reason, there are also three DP control computers, three <b>gyrocompasses,</b> three MRU’s and three wind sensors on Class 3 ships. If a single fault occurs that jeopardizes the redundancy, i.e., failing of a thruster, generator or a PRS, and this cannot be resolved immediately, the operation should be abandoned as quickly as possible.|$|E
25|$|Arriving at Cold Bay on 19 March 1945 {{and newly}} {{promoted}} to captain, Maxwell took {{command of the}} naval base there the following day. Under his command were 694 U.S. Navy and United States Coast Guard personnel, 47 United States Marines, and a U.S. Army contingent of 605; his personnel strength soon stabilized at around 1,500 as Army personnel transferred out and naval personnel replaced them. He found that an advance party under his second-in-command, U.S. Coast Guard Lieutenant Commander John J. Hutson, had already established Detachment 3294s Antisubmarine Warfare Department. He also discovered that the naval facilities required more rehabilitation {{than he had been}} led to believe, so he moved his command into Fort Randall, which had been closed since November 1944, and set about readying its facilities to support Project Hula, including the establishment of housing, classrooms, movie theaters, a radio station, and a softball field, the selection of instructors for courses in radio and radar operation, engineering, gunnery, minesweeping, damage control, and landing craft operation, and the procurement of radios, radars, minesweeping gear, <b>gyrocompasses,</b> engines, movie projectors, and training films and other educational tools.|$|E

40|$|Traditionally the {{horizontal}} orientation in a ship (heading) has been {{obtained from a}} <b>gyrocompass.</b> This instrument is still used on research vessels but has an estimated error of about 2 - 3 degrees, inducing a systematic error in the cross-track velocity measured by an Acoustic Doppler Current Profiler (ADCP). The three-dimensional positioning system (GPS 3 DF) provides an independent heading measurement with accuracy better than 0. 1 degree. The Spanish research vessel BIO Hespérides has been operating with this new system since 1996. For {{the first time on}} this vessel, the data from this new instrument are used to estimate <b>gyrocompass</b> error. The methodology we use follows the scheme developed by Griffiths (1994), which compares data from the <b>gyrocompass</b> and the GPS system in order to obtain an interpolated error function. In the present work we apply this methodology on mesoscale surveys performed during the observational phase of the OMEGA project, in the Alboran Sea. The heading-dependent <b>gyrocompass</b> error dominated. Errors in <b>gyrocompass</b> heading of 1. 4 - 3. 4 degrees have been found, which give a maximum error in measured cross-track ADCP velocity of 24 cm s- 1...|$|R

2500|$|Another {{error of}} the {{mechanical}} compass is turning error. When one turns from a heading of east or west the compass will lag behind the turn or lead ahead of the turn. [...] Magnetometers, and substitutes such as <b>gyrocompasses,</b> are more stable in such situations.|$|E

25|$|A <b>gyrocompass,</b> {{employed}} for navigation of seagoing vessels, finds the geometric north. It does so, not by sensing the Earth's magnetic field, but by using inertial space as its reference. The outer casing of the <b>gyrocompass</b> device {{is held in}} such a way that it remains aligned with the local plumb line. When the gyroscope wheel inside the <b>gyrocompass</b> device is spun up, the way the gyroscope wheel is suspended causes the gyroscope wheel to gradually align its spinning axis with the Earth's axis. Alignment with the Earth's axis is the only direction for which the gyroscope's spinning axis can be stationary with respect to the Earth and not be required to change direction with respect to inertial space. After being spun up, a <b>gyrocompass</b> can reach the direction of alignment with the Earth's axis in as little as a quarter of an hour.|$|R

Hermann Anschütz-Kaempfe founded the company Anschütz & Co., which started in Kiel / Germany the mass production of gyro compasses. The company is today Raytheon Anschütz GmbH. The <b>gyrocompass</b> was an important invention for nautical navigation because it allowed accurate determination of a vessel’s location at all times regardless of the vessel’s motion, {{the weather and the}} amount of steel used {{in the construction of the}} ship.|$|R

Magnetic compasses are also susceptible to disruption from magnetic fields other than the Earth's, such as those produced by the hulls of some metal vehicles or craft.
