5|$|On Tuesday, May 6, 2014, former Yankee Mariano Rivera debuted his new book, The Closer. In it, Rivera {{talks about}} both second baseman Robinson Cano, Rivera's former teammate, and the Red Sox captain Dustin Pedroia. Rivera created {{controversy}} when he stated Cano lacks hustle and heart despite his unending talent and that <b>he</b> <b>would</b> <b>prefer</b> to pick Pedroia {{on a team}} over Cano as a result.|$|E
5|$|In 1964, in {{the wake}} of the {{publication}} of The Whitsun Weddings, Larkin was the subject of an episode of the arts programme Monitor, directed by Patrick Garland. The programme, which shows him being interviewed by fellow poet John Betjeman in a series of locations in and around Hull, allowed Larkin to play a significant part in the creation of his own public persona; one <b>he</b> <b>would</b> <b>prefer</b> his readers to imagine.|$|E

5|$|The size of {{the market}} determines the {{incentive}} to invest irrespective {{of the nature of}} the economy. This is because entrepreneurs invariably take their production decisions by taking into consideration the demand for the concerned product. For example, if an automobile manufacturer is trying to decide which countries to set up plants in, he will naturally only invest in those countries where the demand is high. <b>He</b> <b>would</b> <b>prefer</b> to invest in a developed country, where though the population is lesser than in underdeveloped countries, the people are prosperous and there is a definite demand.|$|E
5|$|Editorials by AlterNet, The Montreal Gazette, The Wall Street Journal, The Guardian, and The New York Times {{have accused}} Wilders of {{hypocrisy}} given that, in their view, Wilders {{has called for}} the ban of {{the sale of the}} Quran while simultaneously arguing for his own personal freedom of speech. In a speech during a Dutch parliamentary debate, Wilders elaborated that he calls for the consistent application of Dutch laws restricting any act of expression that incites violence. Ideally, <b>he</b> <b>would</b> <b>prefer</b> to see nearly all such laws abolished. As such, he supports a European-wide constitutional protection of freedom of speech like that which exists in the United States.|$|E
5|$|In {{the context}} of the Berlin Blockade in June 1948, the Air Force Chief of Staff, General Hoyt S. Vandenberg met with Forrestal to report the poor state of SAC. Following this meeting, Norstad {{recommended}} that Vandenberg replace Kenney, and Vandenberg quickly agreed, choosing Lieutenant General Curtis LeMay as the man <b>he</b> <b>would</b> <b>prefer</b> to lead the strategic bombing arm in case of war with the USSR. LeMay was made leader of SAC, and Kenney became commander of the Air University, a position he held from October 1948 until his retirement from the Air Force in September 1951.|$|E

The band's label, however, had been wanting to release a compilation album for four years, and exercised a clause in the band's contract that allowed them to do so. Grohl has also mentioned that <b>he</b> <b>would</b> have <b>preferred</b> a different track listing, featuring an alternate track listing. In the liner notes of the album, Grohl writes: ...|$|R
5|$|Sakic {{was drafted}} 15th overall by the Quebec Nordiques in the 1987 NHL Entry Draft. Rather than make the {{immediate}} jump, {{he told the}} Nordiques management <b>he</b> <b>would</b> <b>prefer</b> to spend the 1987–88 season in Swift Current {{to prepare for the}} NHL. He made his NHL debut on October 6, 1988, against the Hartford Whalers and registered an assist. His first NHL goal came two days later against goaltender Sean Burke of the New Jersey Devils. During the season, he wore #88 because his preferred number, #19 was already taken by a teammate, Alain Côté. While considered a front-runner for the Calder Memorial Trophy as rookie of the year due to his rapid scoring pace, an ankle injury that forced him to miss 10 games in December and the resulting scoring slump helped quash any hopes of winning the award. He would finish his rookie season with 62 points in 70 games.|$|E
5|$|Meanwhile, Kelly Kapoor (Mindy Kaling) {{is forced}} to choose between Ryan Howard (B. J. Novak) and a new man, Ravi (Sendhil Ramamurthy). Pam Halpert (Jenna Fischer) set up Kelly and Ravi, CeCe's pediatrician, in hopes of Kelly finally moving on from Ryan. Ryan makes several {{attempts}} to get back with Kelly, though everyone finds the attempts pathetic because he can not even say he truly loves her and wants to be with her always (he keeps qualifying all of his feelings for her) and even admits <b>he</b> <b>would</b> <b>prefer</b> she not be with anyone else if she {{is not going to be}} with him. Pam eventually says that he is not a nice person, and Oscar Martinez (Oscar Nunez) says he is not boyfriend material. Ryan tells the office he has a love poem for her, which Kelly has no interest in reading. As the staff are heading outside the building to go home, they see Ryan sitting on a steed professing his love (again, in insultingly hedging terms) to Kelly. She responds by saying she is in love with Ravi and hopes to stay friends with Ryan. They hug goodbye, which turns into a make-out session. The episode closes with Jim Halpert (John Krasinski) and Pam finding and reading Ryan's love poem. Initially scoffing, they are both noticeably moved by it. Tearing up, Jim informs the camera crew that Ryan can never know of the incident.|$|E

He declined to become a Member of Parliament however, stating that <b>he</b> <b>would</b> <b>prefer</b> to participate in the cabinet from outside the Parliament.

25|$|Michelangelo was {{intimidated by}} {{the scale of the}} commission, and made it known from the outset of Julius II's {{approach}} that <b>he</b> <b>would</b> <b>prefer</b> to decline. He felt he was more of a sculptor than a painter, and was suspicious that such a large-scale project was being offered to him by enemies as a set-up for an inevitable fall. For Michelangelo, the project was a distraction from the major marble sculpture that had preoccupied him for the previous few years.|$|E
25|$|Verdi was {{commissioned}} {{to write a}} new opera by the La Fenice opera house in Venice in 1850. By {{this time he was}} already a well-known composer and had a degree of freedom in choosing the works <b>he</b> <b>would</b> <b>prefer</b> to set to music. He then asked Francesco Maria Piave (with whom he had already created Ernani, I due Foscari, Macbeth, Il Corsaro and Stiffelio) to examine the play Kean by Alexandre Dumas, père, but he felt he needed a more energetic subject to work on.|$|E

In the Pahlavi texts above), asks to be thrown upon a mountain, and the demon in {{response}} throws him into the sea. Rescuing himself from the waters, Rostam recovers his horse and confronts the demon again, subsequently beheading it.|$|E
25|$|In September 2008, the {{breakdown}} {{in the relationship between}} the ruling ANC and its presidential appointee, Thabo Mbeki, reached a tipping point, with the ANC NEC's decision that Mbeki was no longer fit to govern South Africa. Mbeki elected not to challenge this decision and resigned as President of South Africa. The ANC announced that the party's deputy president, Kgalema Motlanthe, would become president until 2009 general elections, after which it was intended that Zuma would become president. Zuma declared that <b>he</b> <b>would</b> <b>prefer</b> to only serve one term as president.|$|E

Following the strike, Bush claimed to have suggested to Olmert to hide the strike {{for a while and then}} make it public as a way to isolate the Syrian government, but Olmert asked for total secrecy, wanting to avoid anything that could force Syria to retaliate. However, Israeli columnist Caroline Glick wrote that Israel had bowed to US demands in concealing the airstrike.|$|E
