5|$|An annular eclipse {{occurs when}} the Sun and Moon are <b>exactly</b> <b>in</b> line with the Earth, but the {{apparent}} size of the Moon is smaller {{than that of the}} Sun. Hence the Sun appears as a very bright ring, or annulus, surrounding the dark disk of the Moon.|$|E
5|$|At {{this time}} though the {{chemical}} {{nature of what}} <b>exactly</b> <b>in</b> the blood conferred this protection was not known. In a few decades to follow, it was shown that the protective serum could neutralize and precipitate toxins, and clump bacteria. All these functions were attributed to different substances in the serum, and named accordingly as antitoxin, precipitin and agglutinin. That all the three substances were one entity (gamma globulins) was demonstrated by Elvin A. Kabat in 1939. In the preceding year Kabat had demonstrated the heterogeneity of antibodies through ultracentrifugation studies of horses' sera.|$|E

5|$|A {{partial eclipse}} {{occurs when the}} Sun and Moon are not <b>exactly</b> <b>in</b> line with the Earth and the Moon only {{partially}} obscures the Sun. This phenomenon can usually be seen from {{a large part of}} the Earth outside of the track of an annular or total eclipse. However, some eclipses can only be seen as a partial eclipse, because the umbra passes above the Earth's polar regions and never intersects the Earth's surface. Partial eclipses are virtually unnoticeable in terms of the sun's brightness, as it takes well over 90% coverage to notice any darkening at all. Even at 99%, it would be no darker than civil twilight. Of course, partial eclipses (and partial stages of other eclipses) can be observed if one is viewing the sun through a darkening filter (which should always be used for safety).|$|E
5|$|Over {{the course}} of the year {{different}} sections of the rod serve as the style, which is the part of the gnomon that indicates the time by casting its shadow on the dial face. At the summer solstice, when the Sun is highest (farthest above the equatorial plane), the style is closest to the top of the rod, and at the winter solstice, when the Sun is lowest, it is closest to the bottom. At the equinoxes, when the Sun is on the equatorial plane, the style is <b>exactly</b> <b>in</b> the center of the length of the rod. The style of the equatorial sundial is parallel to the Earth's axis of rotation.|$|E
5|$|The {{earliest}} surviving {{works of}} art that exhibit traces {{of the influence of}} the Parthenon frieze belong to the media of vase painting and grave stelae where we may find some echo not just of motifs, themes, poses, but tenor, as well. Direct imitation, and indeed quotation, of the frieze begins to be pronounced around 430 BC. One example, an explicit copy, is a pelike attributed to the Wedding Painter of a youth “parking up” a horse <b>exactly</b> <b>in</b> the manner of figure W25 on the frieze. While those vase paintings that resemble the frieze cluster around 430, the vases that quote the pediments are datable nearer {{to the end of the}} century, giving further evidence of the priority of the sculptural program. More accomplished painters also found inspiration in the sculpture, namely Polygnotos I and his group, especially the Peleus Painter, the Kleophon Painter and the late work of the Achilles Painter. Later painters of talent also managed to capture the mood of eusebeia, or thoughtful piety of the procession, as, for example, on the volute krater of the Kleophon Painter of a sacrifice to Apollo, which shares the quiet dignity of the best of High Classical sculpture.|$|E

This was later sped up to O(n3).|$|E

However, unlike treewidth, the branchwidth of planar graphs may be computed <b>exactly,</b> <b>in</b> polynomial time. Branch-decompositions and branchwidth may also be generalized from graphs to matroids.|$|E
