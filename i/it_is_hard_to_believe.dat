5|$|There {{are various}} other points which cast serious doubt on Leod's {{traditional}} ancestry. In 1265, Magnus, King of Mann, the last king of this Manx dynasty died. Later in 1275, Magnus's illegitimate son, Godfrey died while leading a revolt. At least two women later {{came forward with}} claims for the kingdom—yet Leod and his sons did not. According to W.D.H. Sellar, <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>hard</b> <b>to</b> <b>believe</b> that a descendant of the royal line would not have put forward a claim. Another point put forward is that the MacLeods did not adopt the royal names of the 13th century Manx dynasty—names such as Godfrey (Old Norse: Guðrøðr; Gaelic: Gofraid), Ranald (Old Norse Rögnvaldr; Gaelic: Raghnall), Olaf (Old Norse Óláfr; Gaelic Amlaíb), and Harald (Old Norse Haraldr; Gaelic Aralt). Sellar illustrated his point by noting the royal names adopted by the descendants of Somerled (d.1164) and his wife Ragnhild, daughter of Olaf the Red (grandfather of Olaf the Black).|$|E

Probably this strain of personal devotion was taken up and given memorable literary form by powerful intellects like Anselm and Bernard, and with the weight of their authority as leaders and spokesmen of the ascetic and eremitic revival became the accepted and expected form of expression.|$|E

In that symbolic rite a child became a man. That explains that Mieszko wasn't blind in fact. He was blind only metaphorically. Besides his son's name was also Mieszko and <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>hard</b> <b>to</b> <b>believe</b> that he was also blind. In addition, as we know today ancient Slavs used only abstract names among nobility.|$|E

Yet in the darkest times come the brightest inspirations, as thousands of San Franciscans rose to the challenge and fought for their voices to be heard. The striking images capture protestors, students and policemen, chanting, fighting and just living their lives. In a way <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>hard</b> <b>to</b> <b>believe</b> these photos were taken so recently, from 1985-1990.
