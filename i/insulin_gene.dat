40|$|Insulin, {{traditionally}} {{regarded as}} a metabolic hormone, also can potently stimulate growth and differentiation in many cell types. To study further the potential role of insulin during early embryogenesis, we have used the amphibian Xenopus laevis, a versatile model of vertebrate development. Using (i) nucleotide sequences of two previously cloned cDNAs that correspond to two different nonallelic Xenopus <b>insulin</b> <b>genes</b> (both of which are expressed in the adult pancreas) and (ii) a modification of the highly sensitive reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) method developed in our laboratory, designated RNA template-specific PCR (RS-PCR), we now find that mRNAs for both Xenopus insulins I and II are present in mature (stage VI) oocytes but not in less-mature oocytes (stages I and IV) or in unfertilized eggs. The Xenopus <b>insulin</b> II <b>gene</b> is differentially expressed during early neurulation (stage 13), while only the <b>insulin</b> I <b>gene</b> is expressed at stage 21, when the neural tube is closing and cephalization is beginning. During later stages (i. e., stage 26) there is a region in the head {{that appears to be}} transcribing only the <b>insulin</b> I <b>gene,</b> while mRNAs for both insulins I and II are present in the body region. These findings show that the two nonallelic <b>insulin</b> <b>genes</b> are expressed differentially in Xenopus embryos in a stage- and region-specific manner; because appropriate receptors are also present, we suggest a role for insulin during early nervous system development well before the emergence of pancreatic beta cells...|$|R
40|$|To {{define the}} {{molecular}} mechanism(s) that activate <b>insulin</b> receptor <b>gene</b> transcription during cell differentiation, we tested nuclear extracts from BC 3 H- 1 muscle cells for their binding to the 5 '-flanking {{region of the}} human <b>insulin</b> receptor <b>gene.</b> DNA binding activity of nuclear extracts was low in undifferentiated BC 3 H- 1 cells and increased significantly during differentiation. Gel retardation assays, combined with DNase I footprinting, showed that the increased <b>insulin</b> receptor <b>gene</b> transcription occurring during differentiation was directly correlated {{with the appearance of}} DNA binding proteins that specifically interacted with two AT-rich sequences of the regulatory region of the <b>insulin</b> receptor <b>gene.</b> Fibroblast growth factor, a known inhibitor of the transcription of muscle-specific DNA binding proteins, did not inhibit the appearance of these insulin receptor DNA binding proteins. When 3 T 3 -L 1 cells differentiate from preadipocytes to adipocytes, <b>insulin</b> receptor <b>gene</b> transcription significantly increases. In differentiated adipocytes, the same two insulin receptor DNA binding proteins markedly increased. Reporter gene analysis with the two AT-rich sequences demonstrated that both of these regions of the <b>insulin</b> receptor <b>gene</b> had the characteristics of promoter rather than enhancer elements. Thus, these proteins interacting with these AT-rich sequences may have major importance in regulating the expression of the insulin receptor in target tissues...|$|R

40|$|Mutations in the <b>insulin</b> {{receptor}} <b>gene</b> {{can cause}} genetic syndromes such as leprechaunism {{that are associated}} with extreme insulin resistance. We have investigated a patient with leprechaunism born of a consanguineous marriage. All 22 exons of the <b>insulin</b> receptor <b>gene</b> were screened for mutations using denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis. Thereafter, the nucleotide sequences of selected exons were determined directly. The patient was homozygous for a point mutation in exon 2 of the <b>insulin</b> receptor <b>gene</b> which results in the substitution of methionine for isoleucine at codon 119. Thus, the mutant allele encodes a receptor that has a mutation in the putative insulin binding domain. Accordingly, the mutant receptor would be predicted not to transduce the insulin signal effectively. In spite of a homozygous abnormality of the <b>insulin</b> receptor <b>gene</b> and many of the clinical features of severe insulin resistance, the proband's clinical syndrome was noticeably different from previously described patients with leprechaunism who usually die within {{the first six months of}} life.

The insulin receptor plays {{a central role in}} mediating insulin action, and previous studies have demonstrated that mutations in the <b>insulin</b> receptor <b>gene</b> may cause <b>insulin</b> resistance. Therefore, we have cloned the insulin receptor cDNA from an insulin-resistant Pima Indian to determine if there is a mutation in the patient 2 ̆ 7 s <b>insulin</b> receptor <b>gene.</b> We obtained nine cDNA clones spanning exons 4 - 10 and 12 - 22 of the patient 2 ̆ 7 s <b>insulin</b> receptor <b>gene.</b> Polymorphisms in the nucleotide sequences for codons 523 (Ala), 1058 (His), and 1062 (Leu) provided useful markers to differentiate the patient 2 ̆ 7 s two alleles of the <b>insulin</b> receptor <b>gene.</b> These substitutions were silent, in that they did not alter the predicted amino acid sequence.

40|$|The insulin {{promoter}} binds {{a number}} of tissue-specific and ubiquitous transcription factors. Of these, the homoeodomain protein PDX- 1 (pancreatic duodenal homeobox factor- 1), the basic leucine zipper protein MafA and the basic helix–loop–helix heterodimer E 47 /BETA 2 (β-cell E box transactivator 2; referred to here as β 2) bind to important regulatory sites. Previous {{studies have shown that}} PDX- 1 can interact synergistically with E 47 and β 2 to activate the rat insulin 1 promoter. The aim {{of the present study was}} to determine the relative contribution of PDX- 1, MafA and E 47 /β 2 in regulating the human insulin promoter, and whether these factors could interact synergistically in the context of the human promoter. Mutagenesis of the PDX- 1, MafA and E 47 /β 2 binding sites reduced promoter activity by 60, 74 and 94 % respectively, in INS- 1 β-cells. In the islet glucagonoma cell line αTC 1. 6, overexpression of PDX- 1 and MafA separately increased promoter activity approx. 2. 5 – 3 -fold, and in combination approx. 6 -fold, indicating that their overall effect was additive. Overexpression of E 47 and β 2 had no effect. In HeLa cells, PDX- 1 stimulated the basal promoter by approx. 40 -fold, whereas MafA, E 47 and β 2 each increased activity by less than 2 -fold. There was no indication of any synergistic effects on the human insulin promoter. On the other hand, the rat insulin 1 promoter and a mutated version of the human insulin promoter, in which the relevant regulatory elements were separated by the same distances as in the rat insulin 1 promoter, did exhibit synergy. PDX- 1 was shown further to activate the endogenous <b>insulin</b> 1 <b>gene</b> in αTC 1. 6 cells, whereas MafA activated the <b>insulin</b> 2 <b>gene.</b> In combination, PDX- 1 and MafA activated both <b>insulin</b> <b>genes.</b> Chromatin immunoprecipitation assays confirmed that PDX- 1 increased the association of acetylated histones H 3 and H 4 with the <b>insulin</b> 1 <b>gene</b> and MafA increased the association of acetylated histone H 3 with the <b>insulin</b> 2 <b>gene...</b>|$|R

40|$|Mutations in the <b>insulin</b> {{receptor}} <b>gene</b> can {{render the}} cell {{resistant to the}} biological action of insulin. We have studied a patient with leprechaunism (leprechaun/Minn- 1), a genetic syndrome associated with intrauterine growth retardation and extreme insulin resistance. Genomic DNA from the patient was amplified by the polymerase chain reaction catalyzed by Thermus aquaticus (Taq) DNA polymerase, and the amplified DNA was directly sequenced. A nonsense mutation was identified at codon 897 in exon 14 in the paternal allele of the patient's <b>insulin</b> receptor <b>gene.</b> Levels of <b>insulin</b> receptor mRNA are decreased to less than 10 % of normal in Epstein-Barr virus-transformed lymphoblasts and cultured skin fibroblasts from this patient.

In addition, we have obtained indirect evidence that the patient's maternal allele of the <b>insulin</b> receptor <b>gene</b> contains a cis-acting dominant mutation that also decreases the level of mRNA, but by a different mechanism. The nucleotide sequence of the entire protein-coding domain and the sequences of the intron-exon boundaries for all 22 exons of the maternal allele were normal.

In order to study the regulation of <b>insulin</b> receptor <b>gene</b> expression, we have cloned, sequenced and characterized its promoter.
