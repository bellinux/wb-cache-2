40|$|International audienceThe classic {{organization}} {{of a gene}} structure has followed the Jacob and Monod bacterial gene model proposed more than 50 years ago. Since then, empirical determinations {{of the complexity of}} the transcriptomes found in yeast to human has blurred the definition and physical boundaries of genes. Using multiple analysis approaches we have characterized <b>individual</b> <b>gene</b> boundaries <b>mapping</b> on human chromosomes 21 and 22. Analyses of the locations of the 59 and 39 transcriptional termini of 492 protein coding genes revealed that for 85 % of these genes the boundaries extend beyond the current annotated termini, most often connecting with exons of transcripts from other well annotated genes. The biological and evolutionary importance of these chimeric transcripts is underscored by (1) the non-random interconnections of genes involved, (2) the greater phylogenetic depth of the genes involved in many chimeric interactions, (3) the coordination of the expression of connected genes and (4) the close in vivo and three dimensional proximity of the genomic regions being transcribed and contributing to parts of the chimeric RNAs. The non-random nature of the connection of the genes involved suggest that chimeric transcripts should not be studied in isolation, but together, as an RNA network...|$|R
40|$|AbstractPersonalized Medicine has {{attracted}} many intentions {{due to its}} role for identifying complex disease before clinical symptoms emerging. This new medical treatment diagnoses patients’ potential disease based on information contained in their gene. Knowledge-Based Systems (KBS) is a computer system that can support personalized medicine by providing <b>individual</b> <b>gene</b> information regarding potential complex disease. <b>Gene</b> <b>mapping</b> is one method to extract information about disease-related- genetic data based on Single Nucleotide Polymorphism (SNP, e. g. single marker) or Haplotype (e. g. multi marker). Although single marker approach is considered accurate, however multiple markers can improve the significance result, especially for complex diseases. This research explores the benefit of haplotype information to obtain multiple markers for complex disease. After that, we develop KBS for supporting personalized medicine by integrating <b>gene</b> <b>mapping</b> to the systems. The system is called KeBHap that is developed by integrating haplotype <b>gene</b> <b>mapping</b> into previous KBS called KBSNP which works based on SNP...|$|R
40|$|The promoter-distal {{region of}} the tra operon of the F sex factor Escherichia coli K- 12 was analyzed, using the {{chimeric}} plasmid pRS 31, which contains the F EcoRI restriction fragments f 17, f 19, and f 2 cloned into the EcoRI site of pSC 101. A series of deletion plasmids of pRS 31, extending increasing distances from a site in f 17 through f 19 and ending in f 2, were isolated. These plasmids were examined by heteroduplex analysis with the parent DNA, and a restriction map of this region of DNA was constructed. A series of Tn 5 insertion derivatives of pRS 31 were also isolated and mapped, using both heteroduplex analysis and restriction mapping. Both the insertion and deletion mutants were tested in minicells for the synthesis of radioactively labeled proteins. This allowed {{the identification of the}} <b>individual</b> <b>gene</b> products and <b>mapping</b> of the <b>genes.</b> The result is a saturated physical map of this region of DNA from fragment f 17 through to the IS 3 insertion sequence near the promoter-distal end of f 2...|$|R
40|$|Deletion of {{the entire}} AZFc locus on the human Y {{chromosome}} leads to male infertility. The functional roles of the <b>individual</b> <b>gene</b> families <b>mapped</b> to AZFc are, however, still poorly understood, since {{the analysis of the}} region is complicated by its repeated structure. We have therefore used single-nucleotide variants (SNVs) across ∼ 3 Mb of the AZFc sequence to identify 17 AZFc haplotypes and have examined them for deletion of <b>individual</b> AZFc <b>gene</b> copies. We found five individuals who lacked SNVs from a large segment of DNA containing the DAZ 3 /DAZ 4 and BPY 2. 2 /BPY 2. 3 gene doublets in distal AZFc. Southern blot analyses showed that the lack of these SNVs was due to deletion of the underlying DNA segment. Typing 118 binary Y markers showed that all five individuals belonged to Y haplogroup N, and 15 of 15 independently ascertained men in haplogroup N carried a similar deletion. Haplogroup N is known to be common and widespread in Europe and Asia, and there is no indication of reduced fertility in men with this Y chromosome. We therefore conclude that a common variant of the human Y chromosome lacks the DAZ 3 /DAZ 4 and BPY 2. 2 /BPY 2. 3 doublets in distal AZFc and thus that these genes cannot be required for male fertility; the gene content of the AZFc locus is likely to be genetically redundant. Furthermore, the observed deletions cannot be derived from the GenBank reference sequence by a single recombination event; an origin by homologous recombination from such a sequence organization must be preceded by an inversion event. These data confirm the expectation that the human Y chromosome sequence and gene complement may differ substantially between individuals and more variations are to be expected in different Y chromosomal haplogroups...|$|R

40|$|Localization {{of disease}} {{susceptibility}} genes to certain {{areas in the}} human genome, or <b>gene</b> <b>mapping,</b> requires careful analysis of genetic marker data. <b>Gene</b> <b>mapping</b> is often carried out using a sample of individuals affected by the disease of interest and a sample of healthy controls. From a data mining perspective, <b>gene</b> <b>mapping</b> can then be cast as a pattern discov-ery and analysis task: which genetically motivated marker patterns help to separate affected individuals from healthy ones? The marker data constitutes haplotypes: a haplotype is a string of genetic markers from one chromosome. Individuals who share a common ancestor, {{such as those that}} have inherited the disease <b>gene</b> from this <b>individual,</b> potentially share a substring in their haplotypes. Classi-fication or association analysis of haplotypes is thus one approach to <b>gene</b> <b>mapping.</b> Further, analyzing the similarities of haplotypes and clustering them can provide insight to genetic rela-tionships of individuals, to different mutations, and thus to the genetic etiology of the disease. We describe and illustrate data mining approaches to <b>gene</b> <b>mapping</b> using haplotypes: as-sociation analysis, similarity analysis, and clustering. The association-based <b>gene</b> <b>mapping</b> methods have been found to perform well and are being routinely applied in <b>gene</b> <b>mapping</b> projects...|$|R
