25|$|Unlike the DVD edition, the German TV {{release was}} re-cut {{to include some}} {{flashback}} scenes at points where they mattered within the story, {{and not in the}} chronological order in which they <b>happened.</b> <b>For</b> example, Stanley's capture by the pirates was shown as a flashback in the fourth episode ("Gigashadow") of the miniseries, whereas the DVD version includes it prior to the Cluster scenes early on in the first episode of the show, somewhat out of context.|$|E
25|$|The Rebel Heart tour {{included}} controversies like late {{start of}} the show, unlawful use of the country's flags as well as ticket goof-ups. Her appearance in Manchester attracted large criticism from fans, who booed at her for her late arrival. Madonna responded to the audience during the show, stating that {{it was due to}} technical difficulties. During her first concert in Hong Kong and Taipei, Madonna was two-and-a-half hours late; the former caused a small protest outside the show. Another late incident <b>happened</b> <b>for</b> the shows in Brisbane.|$|E
25|$|The {{cumulative}} effect of these conquests was to prompt the kings to appoint their younger sons to territories: the apanages or privileges. This policy would allow the kings to progressively impose royal authority on the provinces, since in practice, the apanages would return without difficulty, to the crown whether by inheritance or by confiscation. This <b>happened</b> <b>for</b> example, in Poitou, in 1271 and Anjou, in 1481. These were two provinces taken by conquest from the kings of England by Phillip Augustus and Louis VIII.|$|E

It is argued that, because the USSR was unable to do this, the United States should have also been unable to develop the technology to do so.|$|E
25|$|There {{has been}} {{historical}} decline of Hinduism, Buddhism and Sikhism {{in the areas}} of what is now called Pakistan. This <b>happened</b> <b>for</b> a variety of reasons even as these religions have continued to flourish beyond the eastern frontiers of Pakistan. The region became predominantly Muslim during the rule of the Delhi Sultanate and later Mughal Empire due to the forced conversions in what is now called Pakistan and the rest of South Asia. The predominantly Muslim population supported Muslim League and Pakistan Movement. After the independence of Pakistan in 1947 approximately 4.7 million Hindus and Sikhs moved to India while 6.5 million Muslims settled in Pakistan.|$|E
25|$|With {{his freedom}} restored, the Doctor chose to {{counteract}} his extended exile by seeking as much non-human company as possible. During this period, the Doctor encountered {{all manner of}} unusual beings – from a species that at cursory glance resembled the Earth tiger (The Year of Intelligent Tigers), to water spirits, to talking apes from another dimension. Though at times the Doctor seemed somewhat cold – as when he seemed more concerned about damaged plums than a dead man (Eater of Wasps) – he retained his passion for life in all forms. Although his amnesia remained a bother, the Doctor acknowledged that whatever {{had happened to him}} had <b>happened</b> <b>for</b> a reason, and he might as well make use of the advantages it offered.|$|E

25|$|The {{exploration}} of the battle area with the hydro-acoustic equipment continued {{for a short time}} after the engagement, but no sound was detected. The CS-13 then joined the convoy again and continued its crossing. Upon arrival in Havana, and after personally informing the Head of the Navy, Delgado spoke on the phone with President Batista, who ordered him to keep absolute silence about what had <b>happened.</b> <b>For</b> some unknown reason, according to Delgado, the sinking of U-176 remained a secret to the Cuban public until {{after the end of the}} war. In 1946, Delgado was finally awarded the Meritorious Naval Service Order with Red Badge. Furthermore, Samuel Eliot Morison recognized his success in his work History of United States Naval Operations in World War II, where he also praised the ability and efficiency of the Cuban Navy.|$|E
25|$|Firstly it is {{underlined}} {{that the}} MGK is a consultative body, {{now with a}} civilian majority. The 7th reform package {{made it possible to}} appoint a civilian Secretary General of the MGK, which <b>happened</b> <b>for</b> the first time in August 2004. The council has not anymore expanded executive and monitoring authorities, and has for instance not any more the authority on behalf of the president and the prime minister to follow up on the implementation of the MGK’s ‘recommendations’. In addition, the MGK no longer has unlimited access to all civil institutions. The MGK no longer has a representative in the Supervision Board of Cinema, Video and Music. It was however still represented in civil institutions such as the High Board for Radio and TV (RTÜK) and the Commission for Higher Education (YÖK), but after critics in the 2003 European Commission report this representation was withdrawn from both institutions in 2004.|$|E
