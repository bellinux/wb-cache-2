500|$|According to the Church, {{people have}} a right to private property. However, {{ownership}} makes that person [...] "a steward" [...] who is expected to make it [...] "fruitful" [...] or profitable in a way that benefits others after that person has first taken care of their family. Private property and the common <b>good</b> <b>are</b> seen as complementary elements that exist for the purpose of strengthening society. The taking of another's private property [...] "in obvious and urgent necessity" [...] as [...] "the only way to provide for immediate, essential needs (food, shelter, clothing)" [...] is not considered by the Church to be stealing. The concept of slavery as private property is condemned by the Church, which classifies it as the stealing of a person's human rights.|$|E

The review in the National Post called the book [...] "a {{brilliant}} tour de force". Specifically singled out as being <b>good</b> <b>are</b> the book's wit, rhythm, structure, and story. Mary Beard found the book to be [...] "brilliant" [...] except for the chapter entitled [...] "An Anthropology Lecture" [...] which she called [...] "complete rubbish". Others criticised the book as being [...] "merely a riff on a better story that comes dangerously close to being a spoof" [...] and saying it [...] "does not fare well [...] colloquial feminist retelling". Specifically, the scenes with the chorus of maidservants {{are said to be}} [...] "mere outlines of characters" [...] with Elizabeth Hand writing in The Washington Post that they have [...] "the air of a failed Monty Python sketch". In the journal English Studies, Odin Dekkers and L. R. Leavis described the book as [...] "a piece of deliberate self-indulgence" [...] that reads like [...] "over-the-top W. S. Gilbert", comparing it to Wendy Cope's limericks reducing T. S. Eliot's The Waste Land to five lines.|$|E

2500|$|Since {{determinants}} {{of supply and}} demand other than the price of the goods in question are not explicitly represented in the supply-demand diagram, changes in the values of these variables are represented by moving the supply and demand curves (often described as [...] "shifts" [...] in the curves).

The origins of using the paper cutouts is not known as there are no pre-Hispanic or colonial sources that document the practice, except for a mention around the 1600s of the use of paper strips for ceremonies. The act of cutting the paper gives the shaman a connection with the entity and includes images of various gods, “super humans,” seeds and more.

2500|$|Atlee and Pór {{suggest that}} the field of {{collective}} intelligence should primarily {{be seen as a}} human enterprise in which mind-sets, a willingness to share and an openness to the value of distributed intelligence for the common <b>good</b> <b>are</b> paramount, though group theory and artificial intelligence have something to offer. Individuals who respect collective intelligence are confident of their own abilities and recognize that the whole is indeed greater than the sum of any individual parts. Maximizing collective intelligence relies on the ability of an organization to accept and develop [...] "The Golden Suggestion", which is any potentially useful input from any member. Groupthink often hampers collective intelligence by limiting input to a select few individuals or filtering potential Golden Suggestions without fully developing them to implementation.|$|E
2500|$|However, {{the right}} to the {{communication}} of the truth is not unconditional in Catholic teaching. Everyone must conform his life to the Gospel precept of fraternal love. In concrete situations one should judge whether {{it is appropriate to}} reveal the truth to someone who asks for it. Charity and respect for the truth should dictate the response to every request for information or communication. The good and safety of others, respect for privacy, and the common <b>good</b> <b>are</b> sufficient reasons for being silent about what ought not be known or for making use of a discreet language. The duty to avoid scandal often commands strict discretion. No one is bound to reveal the truth to someone who does not have {{the right to}} know it.

2500|$|The Army of the Eastern Pyrenees was in {{the grip}} of its representatives on mission, [...] "to an extent unknown elsewhere", {{according}} to historian Ramsay Weston Phipps.

Their arrogance was almost beyond belief. Raymond Gaston boasted, [...] "I know neither Generals nor special powers. As to the Minister, he is like a dog on a race course. I alone should command here, and I shall be obeyed." [...] His colleague Claude Dominique Côme Fabre described the army commanders-in-chief as [...] "useless" [...] and wished the office to be abolished.

5000|$|In economics, {{the terms}} “public good” and “common good” have {{technical}} definitions. A public <b>good</b> <b>is</b> a <b>good</b> that <b>is</b> non-rivalrous and non-excludable.

2500|$|Although {{the history}} of the origin of the use of the concept and meaning of 'good' are diverse, the notable discussions of Plato and Aristotle on this subject have been of {{significant}} historical effect. The first references that are seen in Plato's The Republic to the Form of the <b>Good</b> <b>are</b> within the conversation between Glaucon and Socrates (454 c–d). When trying to answer such difficult questions pertaining to the definition of justice, Plato identifies that we should not “introduce every form of difference and sameness in nature” instead we must focus on [...] "the one form of sameness and difference that was relevant to the particular ways of life themselves” which is the form of the Good. This form is the basis for understanding all other forms, it is what allows us to understand everything else. Through the conversation between Socrates and Glaucon (508 a–c) Plato analogizes the form of the Good with the sun as it is what allows us to see things. [...] Here, Plato describes how the sun allows for sight. [...] But he makes a very important distinction, “sun is not sight” but it is “the cause of sight itself.” [...] As the sun is in the visible realm, the form of Good is in the intelligible realm. It is “what gives truth to the things known and the power to know to the knower”. [...] It is not only the “cause of knowledge and truth, it is also an object of knowledge”.|$|E
2500|$|After, or even during, {{successful}} runs in Broadway theatres, producers often remount their productions {{with new}} casts and crew for the Broadway national tour, which travels to theatres {{in major cities}} across the country. Sometimes when a show closes on Broadway, the entire production, with {{most if not all}} of the original cast intact, is relaunched as a touring company, hence the name [...] "Broadway national tour". Some shows may even have several touring companies out at a time, whether the show is still running in New York or not, with many companies [...] "sitting down" [...] in other major cities for their own extended runs. Smaller cities may attract national touring companies, but for shorter periods of time. Or they may even be serviced by [...] "bus and truck" [...] tours. These are scaled-down versions of the larger, national touring productions, historically acquiring their name because the casts generally traveled by bus instead of by air, while the sets and equipment traveled by truck. Tours of this type, which frequently feature a reduced physical production to accommodate smaller venues and tighter schedules, often run for weeks rather than months. Some will even play [...] "split weeks", which are half a week in one town and the second half in another. On occasion, they will also play [...] "one-nighters". The production values, while generally still <b>good,</b> <b>are</b> usually less lavish than the typical Broadway national tour or national touring production and the actors, while still members of the actor's union, are compensated under a different, less lucrative, union contract.
