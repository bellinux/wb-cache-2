Ringwood found it difficult designing the Batsuit because [...] "the image of Batman in the comics is this huge, big six-foot-four hunk with a dimpled chin. Michael Keaton is a guy with average build", he stated. [...] "The problem was to make somebody who was average-sized and ordinary-looking into this bigger-than-life creature." [...] Burton commented, [...] "Michael is a bit claustrophobic, which made it worse for him. The costume put him in a dark, Batman-like mood though, so he was able to use it to his advantage". Burton's idea was to use an all-black suit, and was met with positive feedback by Bob Kane. Jon Peters wanted to use a Nike product placement with the Batsuit. Ringwood studied over 200 comic book issues for inspiration. 28 sculpted latex designs were created; 25 different cape looks and 6 different heads were made, accumulating a total cost of $250,000. Comic book fans initially expressed negative feedback against the Batsuit. Burton opted not to use tights, spandex, or underpants as seen in the comic book, feeling it was not intimidating.

40|$|Several {{regions of}} the human brain respond more {{strongly}} to faces than to other visual stimuli, such as regions in the amygdala (AMG), superior temporal sulcus (STS), and the fusiform face area (FFA). It is unclear if these brain regions are similar in representing the configuration or natural appearance of <b>face</b> <b>parts.</b> We used functional magnetic resonance imaging of healthy adults who viewed natural or schematic <b>faces</b> with internal <b>parts</b> that were either normally configured or randomly rearranged. Response amplitudes were reduced in the AMG and STS when subjects viewed stimuli whose configuration of parts were digitally rearranged, suggesting representation of the 1 st order configuration of <b>face</b> <b>parts.</b> In contrast, response amplitudes in the FFA showed little modulation whether <b>face</b> <b>parts</b> were rearranged or if the natural <b>face</b> <b>parts</b> were replaced with lines. Instead, FFA responses were reduced only when both configural and part information were reduced, revealing an interaction between these factors, suggesting distinct representation of 1 st order <b>face</b> configuration and <b>parts</b> in the AMG and STS vs. the FFA...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{evaluates the}} {{discriminant}} capabilities of <b>face</b> <b>parts</b> in gender recognition. Given {{the image of}} a face, a number of subimages containing the eyes, nose, mouth, chin, right eye, internal face (eyes, nose, mouth, chin), external face (hair, ears, contour) and the full face are extracted and represented as appearance-based data vectors. A greater number of <b>face</b> <b>parts</b> from two databases of face images (instead of only one) were considered with respect to previous related works, along with several classification rules. Experiments proved that single <b>face</b> <b>parts</b> offer enough information to allow discrimination between genders with recognition rates that can reach 86 %, while classifiers based on the joint contribution of internal parts can achieve rates above 90 %. The best result using the full face was similar to those reported in general papers of gender recognition (> 95 %). A high degree of correlation was found among classifiers as regards their capacity to measure the relevance of <b>face</b> <b>parts,</b> but results were strongly dependent on the composition of the database. Finally, an evaluation of the complementarity between discriminant information from pairs of <b>face</b> <b>parts</b> reveals a high potential to define effective combinations of classifiers...|$|R
40|$|Face {{perception}} is often characterized as depending on configural, rather than part-based, processing. Here {{we examined the}} relative contributions of configuration and parts to early ‘‘face-selective’’ processing at the M 170, a magnetoencephalographic response approximately 170 ms after stimulus onset, using adaptation. Previously (Harris and Nakayama 2007), we showed that rapid successive presentation of 2 stimuli (stimulus-onset asynchrony < 800 ms) attenuates the M 170 response. Such adaptation is face-selective, with greater attenuation when faces are preceded by other faces than by houses. This technique therefore provides an independent method to assess {{the nature of this}} early neurophys-iological marker. In these experiments, we measured the adapting power of <b>face</b> configurations versus <b>parts</b> using upright and inverted faces (Experiment 1), face-like configurations of black ovals versus scrambled nonface configurations of <b>face</b> <b>parts</b> (Experiment 2), and isolated <b>face</b> <b>parts</b> (Experiment 3). Although face configurations alone do not produce face-selective adaptation, scrambled and even isolated <b>face</b> <b>parts</b> adapt the M 170 response to a similar extent as full faces. Thus, at least for the relatively early face-selective M 170 response, <b>face</b> <b>parts</b> produce face-selective adaptation but face configurations do not. These results suggest that <b>face</b> <b>parts</b> are important at relatively early stages of face perception...|$|R

But the effigy of the Doge, of which nothing but the side is visible, has been utterly neglected; and the ingenuity of the sculptor is not so great, at the best, as that he {{can afford to be}} slovenly. There is, indeed, nothing in the history of Foscari which would lead us to expect anything particularly noble in his face; but I trust, nevertheless, it has been misrepresented by this despicable carver; for no words are strong enough to express the baseness of the portraiture. A huge, gross, bony clown's face, with the peculiar sodden and sensual cunning in it which is seen so often in the countenances of the worst Romanist priest; a <b>face</b> <b>part</b> of iron and part of clay, with the immobility of the one, and the foulness of the other, double chinned, blunt-mouthed, bony-cheeked, with its brows drawn down into meagre lines and wrinkles over the eyelids; the face of a man incapable either of joy or sorrow, unless such as may be caused by the indulgence of passion, or the mortification of pride. Even had he been such a one, a noble workman would not have written it so legibly on his tomb; and I believe it to be the image of the carver's own mind that is there hewn in the marble, not that of the Doge Foscari. For the same mind is visible enough throughout, the traces of it mingled with those of the evil taste of the whole time and people. There is not anything so small but it is shown in some portion of its treatment; for instance, in the placing of the shields {{at the back of the}} great curtain. In earlier times, the shield, as we have seen, was represented as merely suspended against the tomb by a thong, or if sustained in any other manner, still its form was simple and undisguised. Men in those days used their shields in war, and therefore there was no need to add dignity to their form by external ornament. That which, through day after day of mortal danger, had borne back from them the waves of battle, could neither be degraded by simplicity, nor exalted by decoration. By its rude leathern thong it seemed to be fastened to their tombs, and the shield of the mighty was not cast away, though capable of defending its master no more.|$|E

We assume that the spatial graph of <b>face</b> <b>parts</b> {{structure}} can be partitioned into star graphs associated with individual parts. At each leaf, a regression model for an individual part {{as well as an}} interdependency model between parts in the star graph is learned. During testing, individual part positions are determined by the product of two voting maps, corresponding to two dif-ferent models. The part regression model captures local feature evidence while the interdependency model captures the structure configuration. Our method has shown state of the art results on the publicly available BioID dataset and competitive results on a more challenging dataset, namely Labeled <b>Face</b> <b>Parts</b> in the Wild. ...|$|R
6000|$|It {{was nearly}} eleven {{that night when}} Ashurst put down the pocket [...] "Odyssey" [...] which {{for half an hour}} he had held in his hands without reading, and slipped through the yard down to the orchard. The moon had just risen, very golden, over the hill, and like a bright, powerful, {{watching}} spirit peered through the bars of an ash tree's half-naked boughs. In among the apple trees it was still dark, and he stood making sure of his direction, feeling the rough grass with his feet. A black mass close behind him stirred with a heavy grunting sound, and three large pigs settled down again close to each other, under the wall. He listened. There was no wind, but the stream's burbling whispering chuckle had gained twice its daytime strength. One bird, he could not tell what, cried [...] "Pippip," [...] "Pip-pip," [...] with perfect monotony; he could hear a night-Jar spinning very far off; an owl hooting. Ashurst moved a step or two, and again halted, aware of a dim living whiteness all round his head. On the dark unstirring trees innumerable flowers and buds all soft and blurred were being bewitched to life by the creeping moonlight. He had the oddest feeling of actual companionship, as if a million white moths or spirits had floated in and settled between dark sky and darker ground, and were opening and shutting their wings on a level with his eyes. In the bewildering, still, scentless beauty of that moment he almost lost memory of why he had come to the orchard. The flying glamour which had clothed the earth all day had not gone now that night had fallen, but only changed into this new form. He moved on through the thicket of stems and boughs covered with that live powdering whiteness, till he reached the big apple tree. No mistaking that, even in the dark, nearly twice the height and size of any other, and leaning out towards the open meadows and the stream. Under the thick branches he stood still again, to listen. The same sounds exactly, and a faint grunting from the sleepy pigs. He put his hands on the dry, almost warm tree trunk, whose rough mossy surface gave forth a peaty scent at his touch. Would she come--would she? And among these quivering, haunted, moon-witched trees he was seized with doubts of everything! All was unearthly here, fit for no earthly lovers; fit only for god and goddess, faun and nymph not for him and this little country girl. Would it not be almost a relief if she did not come? But all the time he was listening. And still that unknown bird went [...] "Pip-pip," [...] "Pip-pip," [...] and there rose the busy chatter of the little trout stream, whereon the moon was flinging glances through the bars of her tree-prison. The blossom on a level with his eyes seemed to grow more living every moment, seemed with its mysterious white beauty more and more a part of his suspense. He plucked a fragment and held it close--three blossoms. Sacrilege to pluck fruit-tree blossom--soft, sacred, young blossom--and throw it away! Then suddenly he heard the gate close, the pigs stirring again and grunting; and leaning against the trunk, he pressed his hands to its mossy sides behind him, and held his breath. She might have been a spirit threading the trees, for all the noise she made! Then he saw her quite close--her dark form part of a little tree, her white <b>face</b> <b>part</b> of its blossom; so still, and peering towards him. He whispered: [...] "Megan!" [...] and held out his hands. She ran forward, straight to his breast. When he felt her heart beating against him, Ashurst knew to the full the sensations of chivalry and passion. Because she was not of his world, because she was so simple and young and headlong, adoring and defenceless, how could he be other than her protector, in the dark! Because she was all simple Nature and beauty, {{as much a part of}} this spring night as was the living blossom, how should he not take all that she would give him how not fulfil the spring in her heart and his! And torn between these two emotions he clasped her close, and kissed her hair. How long they stood there without speaking he knew not. The stream went on chattering, the owls hooting, the moon kept stealing up and growing whiter; the blossom all round them and above brightened in suspense of living beauty. Their lips had sought each other's, and they did not speak. The moment speech began all would be unreal! Spring has no speech, nothing but rustling and whispering. Spring has so much more than speech in its unfolding flowers and leaves, and the coursing of its streams, and in its sweet restless seeking! And sometimes spring will come alive, and, like a mysterious Presence stand, encircling lovers with its arms, laying on them the fingers of enchantment, so that, standing lips to lips, they forget everything but just a kiss. While her heart beat against him, and her lips quivered on his, Ashurst felt nothing but simple rapture--Destiny meant her for his arms, Love could not be flouted! But when their lips parted for breath, division began again at once. Only, passion now was so much the stronger, and he sighed: ...|$|E

40|$|In the "Thatcher illusion" a face, {{in which}} the eyes and mouth are {{inverted}} relative {{to the rest of}} the face, looks grotesque when shown upright but not when inverted. In four experiments we investigated the contribution of local and global processing to this illusion in normal observers. We examined inversion effects (i. e., better performance for upright than for inverted faces) in a task requiring discrimination of whether faces were or were not "thatcherized". Observers made same/different judgements to isolated <b>face</b> <b>parts</b> (Experiments 1 - 2) and to whole faces (Experiments 3 - 4). Face pairs had the same or different identity, allowing for different processing strategies using feature-based or configural information, respectively. In Experiment 1, feature-based matching of same-person <b>face</b> <b>parts</b> yielded only a small inversion effect for normal <b>face</b> <b>parts.</b> However, when feature-based matching was prevented by using the <b>face</b> <b>parts</b> of different people on all trials (Experiment 2) an inversion effect occurred for normal but not for thatcherized parts. In Experiments 3 and 4, inversion effects occurred with normal but not with thatcherized whole faces, on both same- and different-person matching tasks. This suggests that a common configural strategy was used with whole (normal) faces. Face context facilitated attention to misoriented parts in same-person but not in different-person matching. The results indicate that (1) face inversion disrupts local configural processing, but not the processing of image features, and (2) thatcherization disrupts local configural processing in upright faces...|$|R

40|$|BACKGROUND: Faces are arguably one of {{the most}} {{important}} object categories encountered by human observers, yet they present {{one of the}} most difficult challenges to both the human and artificial visual systems. A variety of experimental paradigms have been developed to study how faces are represented and recognized, among which is the part-spacing paradigm. This paradigm is presumed to characterize the processing of both the featural and configural information of faces, and it has become increasingly popular for testing hypotheses on face specificity and in the diagnosis of face perception in cognitive disorders. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: In two experiments we questioned the validity of the part task of this paradigm by showing that, in this task, measuring pure information about <b>face</b> <b>parts</b> is confounded by the effect of face configuration on the perception of those parts. First, we eliminated or reduced contributions from face configuration by either rearranging <b>face</b> <b>parts</b> into a non-face configuration or by removing the low spatial frequencies of face images. We found that <b>face</b> <b>parts</b> were no longer sensitive to inversion, suggesting that the previously reported inversion effect observed in the part task was due in fact to the presence of face configuration. Second, self-reported prosopagnosic patients who were selectively impaired in the holistic processing of faces failed to detect <b>part</b> changes when <b>face</b> configurations were presented. When face configurations were scrambled, however, their performance was as good as that of normal controls. CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: In sum, consistent evidence from testing both normal and prosopagnosic subjects suggests the part task of the part-spacing paradigm is not an appropriate task for either measuring how <b>face</b> <b>parts</b> alone are processed or for providing a valid contrast to the spacing task. Therefore, conclusions from previous studies using the part-spacing paradigm may need re-evaluation with proper paradigms...|$|R

40|$|Numerous {{studies with}} {{functional}} {{magnetic resonance imaging}} have shown that the fusiform face area (FFA) in the human brain {{plays a key role in}} face perception. Recent studies have found that both the featural information of faces (e. g., eyes, nose, and mouth) and the configural information of faces (i. e., spatial relation among features) are encoded in the FFA. However, little is known about whether the featural information is encoded independent of or combined with the configural information in the FFA. Here we used multi-voxel pattern analysis to examine holistic representation of faces in the FFA by correlating spatial patterns of activation with behavioral performance in discriminating <b>face</b> <b>parts</b> with <b>face</b> configurations either present or absent. Behaviorally, the absence of face configurations (versus presence) impaired discrimination of <b>face</b> <b>parts,</b> suggesting a holistic representation in the brain. Neurally, spatial patterns of activation in the FFA were more similar among correct than incorrect trials only when <b>face</b> <b>parts</b> were presented in a veridical face configuration. In contrast, spatial patterns of activation in the occipital face area, as well as the object-selective lateral occipital complex, were more similar among correct than incorrect trials regardless of the presence of veridical face configurations. This finding suggests that in the FFA faces are represented not on the basis of individual parts but in terms of the whole that emerges from the parts...|$|R
