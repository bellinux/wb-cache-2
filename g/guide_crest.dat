25|$|Semaphorin-neuropilin repulsive {{signaling}} works synergistically with EphB signaling to <b>guide</b> neural <b>crest</b> cells {{down the}} rostral half of somites in mice. In chick embryos, semaphorin {{acts in the}} cephalic region to <b>guide</b> neural <b>crest</b> cells through the pharyngeal arches. On top of repulsive repulsive signaling, neural crest cells express β1and α4 integrins which allows for binding and guided interaction with collagen, laminin, and fibronectin of the extracellular matrix as they travel. Additionally, crest cells have intrinsic contact inhibition with one another while freely invading tissues of different origin such as mesoderm. Neural crest cells that migrate through the rostral half of somites differentiate into sensory and sympathetic neurons of the peripheral nervous system. The other main route neural crest cells take is dorsolaterally between the epidermis and the dermamyotome. Cells migrating through this path differentiate into pigment cells of the dermis. Further neural crest cell differentiation and specification into their final cell type is biased by their spatiotemporal subjection to morphogenic cues such as BMP, Wnt, FGF, Hox, and Notch.|$|R
40|$|AbstractIn {{vertebrate}} embryos, {{neural crest}} cell migration and motor axon outgrowth {{are restricted to}} rostral somite halves by repulsive factors located in the caudal somite compartment. We show that two Eph family transmembrane ligands, Lerk 2 and HtkL, are expressed in caudal somite halves, and that crest cells and motor axons express receptors for these ligands. In several independent in vitro assays, preclustered ligand-Fc fusion proteins can repulsively <b>guide</b> both <b>crest</b> migration and motor axon outgrowth. These repulsive activities depend on a graded or discontinuous presentation of the ligands when tested {{in the context of}} permissive substrates, such as laminin or fibronectin. These results identify Lerk 2 and HtkL as potential determinants of segmental pattern in the peripheral nervous system...|$|R
40|$|Neural crest {{cells are}} a transient, migratory cell population, which {{originates}} during neurulation at the neural folds {{and contributes to}} the majority of tissues, including the mesenchymal structures of the craniofacial skeleton. The deregulation of the complex developmental processes that guide migration, proliferation, and differentiation of neural crest cells may result {{in a wide range of}} pathological conditions grouped together as neurocristopathies. Recently, due to their multipotent properties neural crest stem cells have received considerable attention as a possible source for stem cell based regenerative therapies. This exciting prospect underlines the need to further explore the developmental programs that <b>guide</b> neural <b>crest</b> cell differentiation. This review explores the particular importance of ribosome biogenesis defects in this context since a specific interface between ribosomopathies and neurocristopathies exists as evidenced by disorders such as Treacher-Collins-Franceschetti syndrome and Diamond-Blackfan anemia...|$|R
40|$|AbstractNeural crest cells, {{the migratory}} {{precursors}} of numerous cell types including the vertebrate peripheral nervous system, {{arise in the}} dorsal neural tube and follow prescribed routes into the embryonic periphery. While the timing and location of neural crest migratory pathways {{has been well documented}} in the trunk, a comprehensive collection of signals that <b>guides</b> neural <b>crest</b> migration along these paths has only recently been established. In this review, we outline the molecular cascade of events during trunk neural crest development. After describing the sequential routes taken by trunk neural crest cells, we consider the guidance cues that pattern these neural crest trajectories. We pay particular attention to segmental neural crest development and the steps and signals that generate a metameric peripheral nervous system, attempting to reconcile conflicting observations in chick and mouse. Finally, we compare cranial and trunk neural crest development in order to highlight common themes...|$|R
40|$|In {{vertebrate}} embryos, {{neural crest}} cells migrate {{only through the}} anterior half of each somite while avoiding the posterior half. We demonstrate that neural crest cells express the receptor neuropilin 2 (Npn 2), while its repulsive ligand semaphorin 3 F (Sema 3 f) is restricted to the posterior-half somite. In Npn 2 and Sema 3 f mutant mice, neural crest cells lose their segmental migration pattern and instead migrate as a uniform sheet, although somite polarity itself remains unchanged. Furthermore, Npn 2 is cell autonomously required for neural crest cells to avoid Sema 3 f in vitro. These data show that Npn 2 /Sema 3 f signaling <b>guides</b> neural <b>crest</b> migration through the somite. Interestingly, neural crest cells still condense into segmentally arranged dorsal root ganglia in Npn 2 nulls, suggesting that segmental neural crest migration and segmentation of the peripheral nervous system are separable processes...|$|R
40|$|The {{vertebrate}} {{neural crest}} migrates from its origin, the neural plate border, to form diverse derivatives. We previously hypothesized that a neural crest gene regulatory network (NC-GRN) <b>guides</b> neural <b>crest</b> formation. Here, we investigate when during evolution this hypothetical network emerged by analyzing neural crest formation in lamprey, a basal extant vertebrate. We identify 50 NC-GRN homologs and use morpholinos {{to demonstrate a}} critical role for eight transcriptional regulators. The results reveal conservation in deployment of upstream factors, suggesting that proximal portions of the network arose early in vertebrate evolution and have been conserved for > 500 million years. We found biphasic expression of neural crest specifiers and differences in deployment of some specifiers and effectors expected to confer species-specific properties. By testing the collective expression and function of neural crest genes in a single, basal vertebrate, we reveal the ground state of the NC-GRN and resolve ambiguities between model organisms...|$|R
40|$|AbstractThe {{neural crest}} is a migratory and {{multipotent}} cell population that plays {{a crucial role}} in many aspects of embryonic development. In all vertebrate embryos, these cells emerge from the dorsal neural tube then migrate long distances to different regions of the body, where they contribute to formation of many cell types and structures. These include much of the peripheral nervous system, craniofacial skeleton, smooth muscle, and pigmentation of the skin. The best-studied regulatory events <b>guiding</b> neural <b>crest</b> development are mediated by transcription factors and signaling molecules. In recent years, however, growing evidence supports an important role for epigenetic regulation as an additional mechanism for controlling the timing and level of gene expression at different stages of neural crest development. Here, we summarize the process of neural crest formation, with focus on the role of epigenetic regulation in neural crest specification, migration, and differentiation as well as in neural crest related birth defects and diseases...|$|R
40|$|The {{neural crest}} is a migratory {{population}} of cells that {{gives rise to}} a wide range of cell types in the peripheral nervous system of vertebrate embryos. It has been shown that neural crest cells migrate along very specific pathways throughout the embryo. The reason for such specificity is not fully known. During the last years, some known axon pathfinding repellants (ephrinB 2, SemaIIIa, Slit 2, etc) have been shown to repel neural crest cells as well during their migration through the somites. However, we know very little about the migratory clues that <b>guide</b> the neural <b>crest</b> for the rest of their path. The goal of this study was to find which other molecules are capable of <b>guiding</b> the neural <b>crest.</b> For this purpose we had set out to screen a group of neurotrophic factors that are expressed at the same time that the crest is migrating through the embryo. Our aim was to look at the effect of neurotrophins on neural crest migration and Schwann cell precursors. Experiments by live imaging in special chambers suggest that: a) neural crest cells are attracted to glia derived neurotrophic factor (GDNF) and Heregulinb 1; and b) that Schwann cell precursors increase their speed in the presence of GDNF, NGF, Heregulinb 1 and Macrophage inhibitory factor (MIF). These preliminary data suggests that neural crest and Schwann cells use a variety of neurotrophic factors as guiding clues during their extensive migration in the embryo...|$|R
40|$|Xenopus {{neural crest}} cells {{migrated}} toward the cathode in an applied electrical field of 10 mV/mm or greater. This behavior {{was observed in}} relatively isolated cells, {{as well as in}} groups of neural crest cells; however, the velocity of directed migration usually declined when a cell made close contact with other cells. Melanocytes with a full complement of evenly distributed melanosomes did not migrate of their own accord, but could be distorted and pulled by unpigmented neural crest cells. Incompletely differentiated melanocytes and melanocytes with aggregated melanosomes displayed the same behavior as undifferentiated neural crest cells, that is, migration toward the cathode. An electrical field of 10 mV/mm corresponded to a voltage drop of less than 1 mV across the diameter of each cell; the outer epithelium of Xenopus embryos drives an endogenous transembryonic current that may produce voltage gradients of nearly this magnitude within high-resistance regions of the embryo. We, therefore, propose that electrical current produced by the skin battery present in these embryos may act as a vector to <b>guide</b> neural <b>crest</b> migration...|$|R
40|$|AbstractDuring development, the semaphorin {{family of}} {{guidance}} molecules {{is required for}} proper formation of the sympathetic nervous system. Plexins are receptors that mediate semaphorin signaling, but how plexins function during sympathetic development is not fully understood. Using phenotypic analyses of mutant mice in vivo, expression pattern studies, and in vitro assays, we show that plexin-A 3 and plexin-A 4 are essential for normal sympathetic development. This study confirms our previous in vitro findings that the two plexins differentially regulate the guidance of sympathetic axons. In addition, we find that semaphorin signaling through plexin-A 3 and plexin-A 4 restricts the migration of sympathetic neurons, but these two plexins function redundantly since migration defects are only observed in plexin-A 3 /-A 4 double mutants. Surprisingly, our analysis also indicates that plexin-A 3 and plexin-A 4 are not required for <b>guiding</b> neural <b>crest</b> precursors prior to reaching the sympathetic anlagen. Immunoprecipitation studies suggest that these two plexins independently mediate secreted semaphorin signaling. Thus, plexin-A 3 and plexin-A 4 are expressed in newly-differentiated sympathetic neurons, but not their neural crest precursors. They function cooperatively to regulate the migration of sympathetic neurons and then differentially to guide the sympathetic axons...|$|R

40|$|BACKGROUND: Craniofacial {{anomalies}} involve defective pharyngeal arch {{development and}} neural crest function. Copy number variation at 1 p 35, containing histone deacetylase 1 (Hdac 1), or 6 q 21 - 22, containing Hdac 2, are implicated {{in patients with}} craniofacial defects, suggesting {{an important role in}} <b>guiding</b> neural <b>crest</b> development. However, the roles of Hdac 1 and Hdac 2 within neural crest cells remain unknown. RESULTS: The neural crest and its derivatives express both Hdac 1 and Hdac 2 during early murine development. Ablation of Hdac 1 and Hdac 2 within murine neural crest progenitor cells cause severe hemorrhage, atrophic pharyngeal arches, defective head morphogenesis, and complete embryonic lethality. Embryos lacking Hdac 1 and Hdac 2 in the neural crest exhibit decreased proliferation and increased apoptosis in both the neural tube and the first pharyngeal arch. Mechanistically, loss of Hdac 1 and Hdac 2 upregulates cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitors Cdkn 1 a, Cdkn 1 b, Cdkn 1 c, Cdkn 2 b, Cdkn 2 c, and Tp 53 within the first pharyngeal arch. CONCLUSIONS: Our results show that Hdac 1 and Hdac 2 function redundantly within the neural crest to regulate proliferation and the development of the pharyngeal arches via repression of cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitors.

40|$|This chapter {{discusses}} some of {{the basic}} principles that have emerged from the study of neural crest biology. It discusses the origin of the neural crest in the embryo and considers {{some of the}} general principles underlying neural crest diversification. Finally, the chapter discusses what is known about how specific derivatives of the neural crest are generated. The neural crest has captured the imagination of developmental biologists for over a century. There are two principal reasons for this. First, it is a highly migratory cell population and very {{little is known about the}} mechanisms that precisely <b>guide</b> neural <b>crest</b> cells to specific sites in the embryo. Second, the neural crest gives rise to an enormous diversity of cell types, including the entire peripheral nervous system, melanocytes, endocrine cells, and much of the connective tissue, bone, and cartilage of the face and skull. Neural crest cells arise at the junction between the prospective epidermis and the prospective neural plate in all vertebrates, regardless of whether the neural crest ultimately migrates from the open neural folds, the closed neural tube, or an ectodermal thickening at the neural plate-epidermis boundary. Although a number of models have been proposed for how neural crest cells are generated, the weight of evidence at present suggests that neural crest arises from local cell-cell interactions between the epidermis and the neural plate...|$|R
40|$|Anterior sclerotome {{is presumed}} {{to be the only}} somitic tissue that <b>guides</b> neural <b>crest</b> cells as they migrate ventrally. In contrast, we report here that crest cells prefer the myotome's basal lamina over the sclerotome as a substratum. This {{conclusion}} stems from four observations. First, crest cells migrating between the neural tube and somite invade lumbar and thoracic somites only after the myotome has formed a basal lamina, as though they use this basal lamina to penetrate the somite. Second, crest cells alter their trajectories dramatically when they contact this basal lamina. They abruptly turn laterally and align closely with the myotome's basal surface. Third, crest cells invade sclerotome only when they fail to contact this basal lamina. For instance, the lateral half of each myotome is initially devoid of basal lamina. When the first crest cells reach the lateral myotome, they depart from the myotome's basal surface and penetrate lateral sclerotome. Only later, when a higher population density prevents some cells from contacting the basal lamina, do crest cells penetrate medial sclerotome. Conversely, crest cells that migrate between somites {{do not have access to}} myotome and fail to turn laterally. Fourth, when we prevent myotome development by surgically removing its precursor (the dermamyotome), crest cells fail to turn laterally within the somite. Instead, they move directly ventrally and colonize medial sclerotome. The preference for myotomal basal lamina implies that anterior sclerotome is a suboptimal environment for neural crest migration. The myotome's basal lamina may facilitate rapid migration through the somite before impediments to ventral migration develop...|$|R
40|$|Neuropilin (NRP) receptors {{and their}} class 3 semaphorin (SEMA 3) ligands play {{well-established}} roles in axon guidance, with loss of NRP 1, NRP 2, SEMA 3 A or SEMA 3 F causing defasciculation and errors in growth cone guidance of peripherally projecting nerves. Here {{we report that}} loss of NRP 1 or NRP 2 also impairs sensory neuron positioning in the mouse head, and that this defect {{is a consequence of}} inappropriate cranial neural crest cell migration. Specifically, neural crest cells move into the normally crest-free territory between the trigeminal and hyoid neural crest streams and recruit sensory neurons from the otic placode; these ectopic neurons then extend axons between the trigeminal and facioacoustic ganglia. Moreover, we found that NRP 1 and NRP 2 cooperate to <b>guide</b> cranial neural <b>crest</b> cells and position sensory neurons; thus, in the absence of SEMA 3 /NRP signalling, the segmentation of the cranial nervous system is lost. We conclude that neuropilins play multiple roles in the sensory nervous system by directing cranial neural crest cells, positioning sensory neurons and organising their axonal projections...|$|R
40|$|Abstract Background As {{in other}} vertebrates, avian {{hindbrain}} neural crest migrates in streams to specific branchial arches. Signalling from Eph receptors and ephrins {{has been proposed}} to provide a molecular mechanism that guides the cells restricting them to streams. In mice and frogs, cranial neural crest express a combination of Eph receptors and ephrins that appear to exclude cells from adjacent tissues by forward and reverse signalling. The objective {{of this study was}} to provide comparative data on the distribution and function of Eph receptors and ephrins in avian embryos. Results To distinguish neural crest from bordering ectoderm and head mesenchyme, we have co-labelled embryos for Eph or ephrin RNA and a neural crest marker protein. Throughout their migration avian cranial neural crest cells express EphA 3, EphA 4, EphA 7, EphB 1, and EphB 3 and move along pathways bordered by non-neural crest cells expressing ephrin-B 1. In addition, avian cranial neural crest cells express ephrin-B 2 and migrate along pathways bordered by non-neural crest cells expressing EphB 2. Thus, the distribution of avian Eph receptors and ephrins differs from those reported in other vertebrates. In stripe assays when explanted cranial neural crest were given the choice between FN or FN plus clustered ephrin-B 1 or EphB 2 fusion protein, the cells strongly localize to lanes containing only FN. This preference is mitigated in the presence of soluble ephrin-B 1 or EphB 2 fusion protein. Conclusion These findings show that avian cranial neural crest use Eph and ephrin receptors as other vertebrates in guiding migration. However, the Eph receptors are expressed in different combinations by neural crest destined for each branchial arch and ephrin-B 1 and ephrin-B 2 appear to have opposite roles to those reported to <b>guide</b> cranial neural <b>crest</b> migration in mice. Unlike many of the signalling, specification, and effector pathways of neural crest, the roles of Eph receptors and ephrins have not been rigorously conserved. This suggests diversification of receptor and ligand expression is less constrained, possibly by promiscuous binding and use of common downstream pathways. </p...|$|R

As a child he adopted his mother’s family name, Arakawa, which would later appear on his prints in addition to his signature. After failing to develop in a dry-goods trade apprenticeship, Kunichika began studying under print designer Chikanobu around 1848. This led to his acceptance as an apprentice of Utagawa Kunisada (Toyokuni III, 1786 - 1865). Training in the Utagawa school gave Kunichika a strong foundation of traditional style and technique. Because he was commissioned to do several portraits of his teacher, it is believed that he was held in high regard by Kunisada. By 1854 he had assumed the name Kunichika, taken from the names of his two teachers (“Kuni” from Kunisada, “Chika” from Chikanobu). The majority of Kunichika’s work consists of actor portraits and scenes from Kabuki plays. He saw himself as a traditional ukiyo-e print designer, and attempted to continue to work in the traditional manner despite the transformation of Japan during his life from the Tokugawa to the Meiji period. His work was affected by the times, noticeable in the use of strong Western red and purple aniline dyes that make up the background in many of his prints.
