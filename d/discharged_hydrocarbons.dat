40|$|The Deepwater Horizon Oil Spill (DWHOS) was {{primarily}} a deep-pelagic event. Variable amounts of <b>discharged</b> <b>hydrocarbons</b> reached the ocean surface and/or seafloor, whereas 100 % occurred within the water column. Understanding this pelagic habitat is important because {{about half of all}} fish species that occur in the Gulf of Mexico (GoM) spend all or part of their lives in the open ocean. Most mesopelagic (200 - 1000 m depth) species of fishes vertically migrate each night to feed in epipelagic (0 - 200 m) depths and return to deep water during the day. This behavior affects rapid cycling of natural and anthropogenic material in the water column. Deep-pelagic fishes are prey for gamefishes, seabirds, and marine mammals. Given the steady growth of oil exploration and operations, the likelihood of future spills emphasizes the need to document acute and chronic effects on pelagic fauna. The DEEPEND (Deep-Pelagic Nekton Dynamics) Consortium will conduct a 3 -year sampling and analysis program that builds on two intensive NOAA-supported surveys during 2010 - 11. DEEPEND will focus on short-term and long-term timescales to appraise the dynamic nature of communities using a suite of integrated approaches. These investigations include: 1) a direct assessment of GoM deep-pelagic community structure including the physical and biological drivers of this structure; 2) a time-series analysis/comparison of biophysical data from the years 2010 - 2011 and 2015 - 2017; 3) a time-series examination of differences in genetic diversity among key species; and 4) a biogeochemical analysis of the effect of DWHOS on pelagic biota...|$|E

Our results show that the hydrocarbon oil index [HC] can be reduced to its maximum permissible value of 15 ppmv (MARPOL) in only 8. 5 h when photocatalysis and air-stripping are used together in a synergistic way, as against 17 h when photocatalysis is used alone. However, this air-assisted photocatalytic process emits a large quantity of volatile organic compounds (VOC) and, within the first four hours, ca. 10 % of the hydrocarbon removal in the aqueous phase is actually just transferred into the gaseous one.

40|$|According to Oparin, Mendeleev {{thought that}} the origin of {{petroleum}} {{was the result of}} the hydrolysis of iron carbides by superheated steam under pressure from the deep interior of the Earth through geological formations where the metal carbides exist. As early as 1877, Mendeleev described the reaction leading to the synthesis of hydrocarbons according to the general equation 3 Fe(sub m) C(sub n) + mH 2 O yields mFe 3 O 4 + C(sub 3 n) H(sub 8 m). Other experimental studies on the production of hydrocarbons from cast iron have been reported. Because of the possibility that hydrocarbons may have been trapped within the carbon matrix of the cast iron, which usually has a high content of carbon, we have studied the reaction of pure iron carbide with deuterium chloride and deuterated water. This was done in order to distinguish any newly formed deuterated hydrocarbons from any possible impurities of trapped hydrocarbons. The experiments were carried out by simply allowing iron carbide to react with concentrated deuterium chloride in D 2 O. The volatile hydrocarbon fraction examined by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC/MS), using a Finnigan 1020 /OWA instrument. contained low molecular weight hydrocarbons in a range C 3 to C 7. Lower molecular weight hydrocarbons were not detected by GC/MS because the MS scanning mode was preset above mass 40 to exclude components of air.

These results show that the hydrolysis of iron carbides may have been a significant source of hydrocarbons on the primitive Earth.

We compile and implement a strategy for synthesis of a-C thin films that entails coupling a hydrocarbon gas (acetylene) with high density discharges generated by the superposition of high power impulse magnetron sputtering (HiPIMS) and direct current magnetron sputtering (DCMS). Appropriate control of discharge density (by tuning HiPIMS/DCMS power ratio), gas phase composition and energy of the ionized depositing species leads to a route capable of providing ten-fold increase in the deposition rate of a-C film growth compared to HiPIMS Ar discharge (Aijaz et al.

The reservoir is characterized by low porosity or ultra-low porosity and ultra-low permeability, which belongs to tight sandstone reservoir. Currently, the reservoir {{is in the middle}} diagenetic stage B. The compaction was the key factor for the rapid deterioration of reservoir physical property in the early diagenetic stage A. The carbonate cements are the most significant damaging effect to the pore space in all cementation. The pore filling of siliceous cements and authigenic clay mineral cements destroyed the reservoir physical properties to a certain extent. The early grain lining chlorite and the late dissolution constitute the constructive role for the reservoir physical property evolution. In the middle diagenetic stage A, the acidic fluid was <b>discharged</b> from mature <b>hydrocarbon</b> favouring the development of secondary dissolved pores and hence substantially improving physical properties of the reservoir.

The PAH distribution and concentration ratios were consistent with a pyrolytic source of PAHs, with a high proportion of heavier parent PAHs. There was no evidence of any recovery in PAH concentrations, perhaps due to the mixing and disturbances of the sediment, and the persistence of PAHs. Concentrations of all PAHs were above the Background Assessment Concentrations (BACs) in both basins. In the lower basin only the 5 - and 6 -ring PAHs were above the Effects Range Low (ERL) values, but in the upper basin all but naphthalene were above the ERLs.

Erbium-doped hydrogenated amorphous carbon (a-C:H(Er)) is fabricated through controlled thermal evaporation of metal-organic compounds in a <b>hydrocarbon</b> <b>discharge</b> generated by the DC saddle-field plasma enhanced chemical vapour deposition system. Er photoluminescence (PL) is successfully demonstrated {{for the first time in}} Er-doped deuterated amorphous carbon (a-C:D(Er)). Uniform distribution of optically active Er 3 + ions is attained by using tris(2, 2, 6, 6 -tetramethy 1 - 3 - 5 -heptanedionate) Erbium(III) (Er(thd) 3) compound as revealed by XPS analysis. Er(thd) 3 is observed to be a preferred dopant over Erbium(III) 2, 4 -pentanedionate (Er(acac) 3). Deuteration of amorphous carbon has effectively removed the PL quenching effect caused by non-radiative C-H and O-H vibrational transitions. An improvement factor of ~ 4. 4 is observed in the minimum doping level of Er required to attain PL in a-C:D(Er), compared to a-C:H(Er). The results of this thesis suggest that a-C:D(Er) material can potentially be used for silicon-compatible opto-electronics applications in 1. 5 μm region. ii Acknowledgements First and foremost, I would like to acknowledge and thank my supervisors...|$|R
40|$|A major {{fraction}} of the petroleum <b>hydrocarbons</b> <b>discharged</b> during the 2010 Macondo oil spill became associated with and sank to the seafloor as marine snow flocs. This sedimentation pulse induced the development of distinct bacterial communities. Between May 2010 and July 2011, full-length 16 S rRNA gene clone libraries demonstrated bacterial community succession in oil-polluted sediment samples near the wellhead area. Libraries from early May 2010, before the sedimentation event, served as the baseline control. Freshly deposited oil-derived marine snow was collected {{on the surface of}} sediment cores in September 2010, and was characterized by abundantly detected members of the marine Roseobacter cluster within the Alphaproteobacteria. Samples collected in mid-October 2010 closest to the wellhead contained members of the sulfate-reducing, anaerobic bacterial families Desulfobacteraceae and Desulfobulbaceae within the Deltaproteobacteria, suggesting that the oil-derived sedimentation pulse triggered bacterial oxygen consumption and created patchy anaerobic microniches that favored sulfate-reducing bacteria. Phylotypes of the polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon-degrading genus Cycloclasticus, previously found both in surface oil slicks and the deep hydrocarbon plume, were also found in oil-derived marine snow flocs sedimenting on the seafloor in September 2010, and in surficial sediments collected in October and November 2010, but not in any of the control samples. Due to the relative recalcitrance and stability of polycyclic aromatic compounds, Cycloclasticus represents the most persistent microbial marker of seafloor hydrocarbon deposition that we could identify in this dataset. The bacterial imprint of the DWH oil spill had diminished in late November 2010, when the bacterial communities in oil-impacted sediment samples collected near the Macondo wellhead began to resemble their pre-spill counterparts and spatial controls. Samples collected in summer of 2011 did not show a consistent bacterial community signature, suggesting that the bacterial community was no longer shaped by the DWH fallout of oil-derived marine snow, but instead by location-specific and seasonal factors...|$|R
