25|$|After the {{cumbrous}} {{army had}} passed through Metz it encountered an isolated corps of the enemy {{near the village of}} Mars-la-Tour, which was commanded by the brilliant leader Constantin von Alvensleben, and promptly attacked the French.

But Bazaine had no confidence in his generals or his troops, and contented himself with inflicting severe losses on the most aggressive portions of the German army.|$|E

25|$|The {{video is}} {{shot in a}} grey room, where Yonezu wearing a flower wreath and long hair {{covering}} his face sits down to read a picture book. The picture book illustrates the song, showing pictures of two hands {{on top of each}} other, and a couple separated in <b>every</b> <b>moment</b> <b>of</b> their lives by a glass pane. Yonezu walks around the room, and finds holes in the room, with light shining through them. Further along there is a barren tree, with the lyrics of the song hanging on it. Yonezu sits under the tree with the book. The girl in the picture book leaves the drawings, leaving the male character alone. Yonezu starts to frantically claw at the holes of light, and falls down. On {{the other side of the}} holes of light, Yonezu performs the song with a band and an orchestra.|$|E
25|$|All that exists, {{throughout}} all time and beyond, is one infinite divine Consciousness, free and blissful, which projects {{within the field}} of its awareness a vast multiplicity of apparently differentiated subjects and objects: each object an actualization of a timeless potentiality inherent in the Light of Consciousness, and each subject the same plus a contracted locus of self-awareness. This creation, a divine play, {{is the result of the}} natural impulse within Consciousness to express the totality of its self-knowledge in action, an impulse arising from love. The unbounded Light of Consciousness contracts into finite embodied loci of awareness out of its own free will. When those finite subjects then identify with the limited and circumscribed cognitions and circumstances that make up this phase of their existence, instead of identifying with the transindividual overarching pulsation of pure Awareness that is their true nature, they experience what they call “suffering.” To rectify this, some feel an inner urge to take up the path of spiritual gnosis and yogic practice, the purpose of which is to undermine their misidentification and directly reveal within the immediacy of awareness the fact that the divine powers of Consciousness, Bliss, Willing, Knowing, and Acting comprise the totality of individual experience as well—thereby triggering a recognition that one’s real identity is that of the highest Divinity, the Whole in every part. This experiential gnosis is repeated and reinforced through various means until it becomes the nonconceptual ground of <b>every</b> <b>moment</b> <b>of</b> experience, and one’s contracted sense of self and separation from the Whole is finally annihilated in the incandescent radiance of the complete expansion into perfect wholeness. Then one’s perception fully encompasses the reality of a universe dancing ecstatically in the animation of its completely perfect divinity.|$|E

500|$|The {{two songs}} {{excluded}} from the final release introduced further elements to the plot. [...] "Gil Blanco County", a song with music written by Allen Lanier for Soft White Underbelly in the late 1960s and recorded in the unpublished Elektra album of the Stalk-Forrest Group (now available as [...] ), has short and elusive lyrics apparently detailing the escape of Imaginos from Texas to Arizona. The other song, [...] "The Girl That Love Made Blind", is an Albert Bouchard composition which explains that Imaginos' powers include the capacity of moving [...] "in and through time", assuming different identities in <b>every</b> <b>moment</b> <b>of</b> history.|$|E

[...] and Neo responds: [...] "Because I choose to." [...] Diamond uses this example to explain the Landmark Forum's discussion of [...] "choice and decision." [...] Diamond provides further analysis of other Landmark Forum concepts utilized in The Matrix Revolutions in her book Stepping Into Spiritual Oneness: Spiritual Rememberings of the Soul Through Life Experience, including the concept that: [...] "we all choose to BE who we are being in each and <b>every</b> <b>moment</b> <b>of</b> our experience." ...|$|E
500|$|Upon its release, Dawn of Mana {{received}} generally poor reviews {{over a wide}} range, with numerical {{scores that}} range from 30 to 80 out of 100. Reviewers praised Dawn of Manas graphics and character design; GameSpot's Kevin VanOrd called it colorful and [...] "pretty", and praised the particle effects, while a reviewer for GameTrailers noted the [...] "gorgeous in-game cinematics". Gabe Graziani of GameSpy also called out the cinematics in his review, calling them [...] "beautifully rendered and animated" [...] and {{the highlight of the}} game. IGN's Jeff Haynes liked the scale and variety of the 3D environments and called out the character models as worthy of praise. Andrew Fitch of 1UP.com, however, described the level design as [...] "chaotic" [...] despite the [...] "charming, candy-coated graphics". Joe Juba and Matt Miller of Game Informer said that the environments are [...] "pretty bland", but praised the rest of the graphics heavily. Michael Beckett of RPGamer said that [...] "Dawn of Mana's visual style is highly impressive" [...] and especially praised the character design and color palette. The music was also praised; VanOrd called it [...] "the highlight of the sound design" [...] and the GameTrailers reviewer claimed that Dawn of Mana had a [...] "lush soundtrack filling <b>every</b> <b>moment</b> <b>of</b> the game". Beckett also praised the music, and noted the callbacks in the largely orchestral score to previous games in the Mana series.|$|E
500|$|Preparing for {{the episode}} was {{physically}} difficult {{for some of}} the cast members, most of whom had little experience singing and dancing. They spent three months in voice training. Two choreographers worked with Whedon and the cast on dance sequences. Michelle Trachtenberg (Dawn), who is trained in ballet, requested a dance sequence in lieu of a significant singing part, and Alyson Hannigan (Willow), according to Whedon, begged him not to give her many lines. Sarah Michelle Gellar (Buffy) told the BBC that [...] "It took something like 19hours of singing and 17hours of dancing in between shooting four other episodes" [...] and she was so anxious about singing that she [...] "hated <b>every</b> <b>moment</b> <b>of</b> it". When Whedon suggested using a voice double for her, however, she said, [...] "I basically started to cry and said, 'You mean someone else is going to do my big emotional turning point for the season?' In the end, it was an incredible experience and I'm glad I did it. And I never want to do it again." [...] Davies was so impressed with Hinton Battle's performance on Broadway in The Wiz that he asked Battle to play the demon Sweet. Battle, a three-time Tony-winner, wore prosthetic make-up {{for the first time to}} give him a demonic red face. Sweet was portrayed as [...] "slick", smooth and stylish; in contrast, most demons on the series were designed to be crude and ugly. The set for The Bronze was used frequently throughout the series, but stairs were built from the stage to maximize floor space for Battle's dance.|$|E
