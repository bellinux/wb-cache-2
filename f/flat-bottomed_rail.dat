5000|$|Starting on 25 March 2008 {{service was}} {{temporarily}} halted for reconstruction and fleet replacement. During the 14-month suspension of rail service, buses provided a substitute service. On the existing {{section of the}} line, the most notable change was the re-gauging from meter gauge to 900 mm. The track was completely rebuilt, the unusual [...] "Y" [...] head rails being replaced with conventional <b>flat-bottomed</b> <b>rails</b> on concrete ties/sleepers.|$|R
25|$|Fang bolts or {{rail anchor}} bolts {{have also been}} used for fixing rails or chairs to sleepers. The fang bolt is a bolt {{inserted}} {{through a hole in}} the sleeper with a fanged nut that bites into the lower surface of the sleeper. For fastening <b>flat-bottomed</b> <b>rails,</b> an upper-lipped washer can be used to grip the edge of the rail. They are more resistant to loosening by vibrations and movement of the rail. They are thought more effective than spikes and screws and so are used in positions such as switch (point) tieplates and on sharp curves.|$|R
500|$|A {{system of}} horse-drawn tramways {{was used to}} move the peat across the moor from at least the 1890s, since the lines are marked on the 1890 Ordnance Survey maps, and Booth {{includes}} a picture of Moorends Works taken in the 1890s, showing both [...] wagons and the [...] gauge wooden peat wagons used internally. Rotherham includes an engraving of a peat wagon in his book, consisting of a farm cart, still with its road wheels attached, but with a four-wheeled bogie under each of the axles {{to allow it to}} be pulled along the rails by two horses. However, no indication of a date is given. The rails were quite light, at , but were gradually increased to , and by the 1980s, when locomotives were in use, rails of [...] were installed. The <b>flat-bottomed</b> <b>rails</b> were initially made of iron, but were later replaced by steel rails. The tracks were referred to locally as trams, rather than tramways.|$|R
2500|$|Most railroads {{with heavy}} traffic use {{continuously}} welded rails supported by sleepers attached via base plates that spread the load. A plastic or rubber pad is usually placed between the rail and the tie plate where concrete sleepers are used. The rail is usually held down to the sleeper with resilient fastenings, although cut spikes are widely used in North American practice. For much of the 20th century, rail track used softwood timber sleepers and jointed rails, and a considerable extent of this track type remains on secondary and tertiary routes. The rails were typically of flat bottom section fastened to the sleepers with dog spikes through a flat tie plate in North America and Australia, and typically of bullhead section carried in cast iron chairs in British and Irish practice. [...] The London, Midland and Scottish Railway pioneered the conversion to <b>flat-bottomed</b> <b>rail</b> and the supposed advantage of bullhead rail - that the rail could be turned over and re-used when the top surface had become worn - {{turned out to be}} unworkable in practice because the underside was usually ruined by fretting from the chairs.|$|E

50|$|GIPR's first BG tracks used 65 lb/yd double-headed rails made of wrought iron. Rails of 80 lb/yd {{were common}} (e.g., Indian Midland Railway). Both <b>flat-bottomed</b> and bull-headed <b>rails</b> were {{commonly}} used. MG railways {{started off with}} 40 lb/yd rails, although 30 lb/yd rails were also used. The Barsi Light Railway used 30 lb/yd rails. The Rajputana Malwa Railway used 50 lb rails.|$|R
2500|$|The {{track was}} of the Winby and Levick system and {{consisted}} of <b>flat-bottomed,</b> grooved tramway-type <b>rails</b> laid longitudinally on broad iron plates, which in turn rested on consolidated macadam or other road material; this was believed {{to make up a}} sufficient foundation without concrete. Nottingham was the first installation of this newly patented system. The base plates were 12inches wide and inch thick in lengths 11 feet 11inches long, and were laid continuously {{in order to avoid the}} plate joints and the rail joints coming together, as the rails were in [...] lengths.

50|$|Vignoles rail was a {{light section}} that today would be classed as <b>flat-bottomed</b> <b>rail.</b> In its {{original}} form it was only about 4 in deep and was used on baulk road interchangeably with bridge rail.|$|E
50|$|Vignoles rail is {{the popular}} {{name of the}} <b>flat-bottomed</b> <b>rail,</b> {{recognising}} engineer Charles Vignoles who introduced it to Britain.Charles Vignoles observed that wear was occurring with wrought iron rails and cast iron chairs upon stone blocks, the most common system at that time. In 1836 he recommended <b>flat-bottomed</b> <b>rail</b> to the London and Croydon Railway {{for which he was}} consulting engineer.His original rail had a smaller cross-section than the Stevens rail, with a wider base than modern rail, fastened with screws through the base. Other lines which adopted it were the Hull and Selby, the Newcastle and North Shields, and the Manchester, Bolton and Bury Canal Navigation and Railway Company.|$|E
50|$|The {{line was}} {{constructed}} using <b>flat-bottomed</b> <b>rail</b> spiked to wooden sleepers with earth ballast {{in a conventional}} way. There was an additional locomotive shed at Norden and trackwork included a short branch at Bushey. Other features included a wooden bridge over the Corfe River.|$|E
5000|$|The railway's [...] gauge {{trackwork}} {{consists of}} <b>flat-bottomed</b> <b>rail</b> mounted using pandrol clips onto Costain concrete sleepers (wooden sleepers {{are used for}} pointwork).

50|$|In 1836 he {{suggested}} the use, on the London and Croydon Railway, of a <b>flat-bottomed</b> <b>rail,</b> first invented by the American R.L.Stevens in 1830 (but rolled in British steel works).

5000|$|The {{track was}} steel <b>flat-bottomed</b> <b>rail</b> of , {{attached}} by spring clips to cast iron sleepers, 3 ft long and 6.5 in wide, spaced at 2 ft centres. Pointwork was prepared at the workshop in Duffield (for which Heywood charged £7/15s/0d each (...) [...] ), and carried to site. The maximum gradient was 1 in 70 (1.43%), Eaton Hall being 51 ft above the sidings at Balderton.|$|E
50|$|This Vignole type section track {{has a large}} {{surface of}} contact with the sleeper and is {{therefore}} a <b>flat-bottomed</b> <b>rail</b> rather than double-headed, bull-headed, etc. It is 15 ft long, typical of early rail lengths and has no holes for fishplates as these were not invented until after 1839; special joint-chairs were used {{at that time to}} hold the ends in place. The fishplate, originally without bolt holes, was invented by William Bridges Adams in May 1842 and used from 1849.|$|E

50|$|The tramway was {{originally}} designed to be worked by horses and gravity. During busy periods, 2 or 3 horses were required to work the summit section between the top of No. 3 incline and the Rhiwbach incline. Sometime in the 1920s petrol locomotives were introduced to work this section and a small shed was built in which the locomotive was kept. The practice was not entirely successful, as the locomotive was too heavy for the track materials used, {{and parts of the}} tramway were relaid in light section <b>flat-bottomed</b> <b>rail</b> or heavier section bridge rail. In 1953 the Rhiwbach Quarry closed, leaving the Cwt y Bugail Quarry as the only user of the main section of the tramway.|$|E
50|$|To {{follow the}} routes, leave Glyndyfrdwy railway station {{and follow the}} road South (uphill) until {{you come to the}} main road. Turn right, then turn left next to the village hall, {{following}} the public footpath sign, which takes you along a side-valley by a stream. In about 200m, there is a fork (signposted) and a small footpath leads steeply up to the left; take it (although I know it looks unpromising compared to the main path!). After its steep climb, this footpath will lead you across the tramway's cable-worked incline near its top, where you can see the walls of the old winding gear, to a road. Turn right on the road and a permissive footpath will soon lead off along the tramway itself. You can see cross-sleepers occasionally, and at least one piece of conventional <b>flat-bottomed</b> <b>rail</b> is visible embedded in the ground near the south end of this line (where it joins the other line).|$|E

50|$|Because of the {{particular}} needs of the workforce the G&IER was unique amongst British tramways in operating a service throughout every {{day and night for}} most of its existence. Normally service during the day was every 20 or 30 minutes with less frequent trams overnight and extras at peak times. Because traffic was very heavily peaked, departures at shift-change times often took the form of convoys of up to seven trams. Running time was 27 minutes. At the line’s peak in the 1950s 19 cars were required in service, reduced to ten after 1959. 24 cars were in running order when the line closed. As {{an integral part of the}} railway system, GCR, LNER, and later BR, the tramway featured in the public railway timetables and through tickets were issued from the rest of the system. Amongst others, printed tickets between King’s Cross and Immingham Dock ‘via electric cars’ were available. Local ticketing used the colourful and complex ‘Bell Punch’ system until the end.The railway was not signalled, unlike many other single-track tramways, although local signals were introduced after the Second World War at two level crossings. The track on street sections in Grimsby and at Immingham used conventional grooved tramway rail; the private track sections were originally laid with <b>flat-bottomed</b> <b>rail,</b> replaced later by railway-pattern bullhead rail, and the pointwork required a different wheel profile from that normally used on tramways.|$|E
50|$|The Fron-Boeth quarry was {{an ambitious}} attempt, begun in 1886, {{to extend the}} Pant Mawr workings, {{starting}} from a new mill site at a lower level. It was never particularly successful, but employed around 50 men initially, with production decreasing in the early 1900s. The tramway {{from the top of}} the first incline to Pant Mawr had looped northwards in an 'S' shape to reach the foot of the second incline. This route was abandoned, and the first incline was extended upwards, through the drumhouse, to a ledge a little further up the hillside. It followed this ledge towards the south west, and then made a right-angle bend to enter a tunnel, which took it through the ridge between Cwm Croesor and Cwm Maesgwyn. The tunnel was around 500 yd long, and was the only significant example of a tunnel created for an access tramway, rather than as part of a mine, in North Wales. There are several spoil tips near the far end to the tunnel, but these are formed of granite waste, as the quarry buildings were constructed from granite, rather than slate. The tramway turned back on itself to reach a second incline, from the head of which a further tramway followed the general direction of the one to Pant Mawr, but at a lower level. The tramway to Pant Mawr had been laid in bridge rails, but that to Fron-Boeth used conventional <b>flat-bottomed</b> <b>rail.</b>|$|E
