40|$|In this paper, {{we study}} {{depositary}} receipt prices in regulated markets and free-entry markets. Because of their unique environments, the Taiwanese and Hong Kong markets provide interesting settings {{that have not}} yet been explored in the literature. In particular, we focus on the following: (1) the difference in the long-term price relationships between <b>depositary</b> receipts <b>and</b> underlying securities in free-entry and regulated areas, (2) the price dynamics of the depositary receipts for firms with and without the long-term equilibrium relationships between <b>depositary</b> receipts <b>and</b> underlying securities, and (3) the incremental information content of the qualifed foreign institutional investor (QFII) ownership ratio for the depositary receipts issued by Taiwanese firms. The empirical results reveal that long-term equilibrium relationships between <b>depositary</b> receipts <b>and</b> underlying security prices exist for firms listed in Hong Kong, a free-entry market, but do not necessarily exist for firms listed in Taiwan with foreign ownership restrictions. The long-term equilibrium relationships between <b>depositary</b> receipts <b>and</b> underlying se-curities and the local market conditions are the most important factors in explaining the depositary receipt returns when the equilibrium exists. In the absence of equilibrium, the lagged returns of depositary receipts or underlying securities and the local market conditions become important. In addition, QFII ownership ratios significantly explain the depositary receipt price variations in a regulated market, which implies the restric-tion effect on the price dynamics of the depositary receipts. 1...|$|R

The paper is mainly addressed to the managers interested in the use of knowledge in the activity of the organizations they lead, warning them about the sensitive points of the knowledge-related activities, with the dangers associated with them and suggesting them that the traditional informational security mechanisms are not sufficient, that they have to be reanalyzed and improved in knowledge security. ...|$|R
