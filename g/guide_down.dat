2500|$|During the {{expedition}} John Colter {{was considered to}} be one of the best hunters in the group, and was routinely sent out alone to scout the surrounding countryside for game meat. Colter was often trusted with responsibilities that went beyond hunting and woodsman activities. He was instrumental in helping {{the expedition}} find passes through the Rocky Mountains. In one instance, Colter was handpicked by Clark to deliver a message to Lewis, waylaid at a Shoshone camp, concerning the impracticability of following a route along the Salmon River. In another instance he was charged with retracing a route in the Bitterroot Mountains to recover lost horses and supplies, and not only returned with some of the recovered resources and horses, but also retrieved deer to gift the hospitable Nez Perce tribes and strengthen sick corp members. Colter was also noted by Lewis for his ability to barter with various tribes, an attribute which may have led to his later role with Manuel Lisa. During the expedition Colter never appeared on sick lists, suggesting very advantageous health. He was often one of the few hunters allowed to leave the camp during points of illness and recuperation, proving Lewis and Clark’s trust in him. Another major contribution Colter made to the Corps of Discovery was providing the expedition with the means to swiftly descend the Bitterroot Mountains, allowing access to the Snake River, Columbia River and subsequently, the Pacific Ocean. While hunting far ahead of the main party, Colter encountered three Tushepawe Flatheads. Through non-verbal peace symbols and communication, Colter was able to dissuade the Flatheads to abandon their search for two Shoshones who had stolen twenty three head of horses, and accompany him to the expedition’s camp. One of the young Flatheads agreed to act as the party’s <b>guide</b> <b>down</b> the mountains and through Flathead country, a great advantage in challenging and unfamiliar terrain plagued by a scarcity of game. [...] Once at the mouth of the Columbia River, Colter was among a small group selected to venture to the shores of the Pacific Ocean, as well as explore the seacoast north of the Columbia into present-day Washington state.|$|E

60|$|The young guardsman had scarce ever {{exchanged}} {{a word with}} this powerful lady, for it was her taste to isolate herself, and to appear with the court only at the hours of devotion.

The lady paused {{in front of the}} chamber door, and turned to her companion.|$|E

60|$|Harry sallied {{out into}} the lane, keeping {{by the side of}} his guide, with his head bent forward, and his eyes on the ground, walking, as far as he could, with a {{listless}} gait. The old woman continued to chatter to him in Romaic. There were many people about in the lane, but none paid any heed to them. Harry did not look up, but turned with his <b>guide</b> <b>down</b> several lanes, until they at length emerged on the quays. Saying she would call next day at his hotel for the reward he had promised her, she left him, and Harry, with his head full of the plot against Cromwell's life, crossed at once to the vessels by the quay.|$|E

She was unable to see over the hedges till she came through a gate into a meadow, where Jock looked about, rubbed his eyes, and exclaimed-—"Hallo, where are they?" [...] pointing to the place where Allen had fallen, but whence he seemed to have been spirited away like Sir Piercie Shafton. However, Rob and Joe came running out of a farmyard at a little distance, with tidings that Allen had been taken in there, and replying to her breathless question, that they could not tell how much he was hurt.|$|E
60|$|Some {{years ago}} I {{followed}} Attalano, my <b>guide,</b> <b>down</b> the narrow Mexican street of Tampico {{to the bank}} of the broad Panuco. Under the rosy dawn the river quivered like a restless opal. The air, sweet with the song of blackbird and meadowlark, was full of cheer; the rising sun shone in splendor on the water and the long line of graceful palms lining the opposite bank, and the tropical forest beyond, with its luxuriant foliage festooned by gray moss. Here was a day to warm the heart of any fisherman; here was the beautiful river, celebrated in many a story; here was the famous guide, skilled with oar and gaff, rich in experience. What sport I would have; what treasure of keen sensation would I store; what flavor of life would I taste this day! Hope burns always in the heart of a fisherman.|$|E

60|$|A gaunt Franciscan friar, with a wild bright eye, was {{our only}} <b>guide,</b> <b>down</b> into this {{profound}} and dreadful place. The narrow ways and openings hither and thither, {{coupled with the}} dead and heavy air, soon blotted out, in all of us, any recollection of the track by which we had come: and I could not help thinking 'Good Heaven, if, in a sudden fit of madness, he should dash the torches out, or if he should be seized with a fit, what would become of us!' On we wandered, among martyrs' graves: passing great subterranean vaulted roads, diverging in all directions, and choked up with heaps of stones, that thieves and murderers may not take refuge there, and form a population under Rome, even worse than that which lives {{between it and the}} sun. Graves, graves, graves; Graves of men, of women, of their little children, who ran crying to the persecutors, 'We are Christians! We are Christians!' that they might be murdered with their parents; Graves with the palm of martyrdom roughly cut into their stone boundaries, and little niches, made to hold a vessel of the martyrs' blood; Graves of some who lived down here, for years together, ministering to the rest, and preaching truth, and hope, and comfort, from the rude altars, that bear witness to their fortitude at this hour; more roomy graves, but far more terrible, where hundreds, being surprised, were hemmed in and walled up: buried before Death, and killed by slow starvation.|$|E

40|$|While {{conference calls}} {{have been widely}} used as a {{communication}} tool between firms and investors, little research has examined the effect of this voluntary disclosure metric on analyst forecasts. In this paper, we examine whether firms use conference calls to <b>guide</b> <b>down</b> analysts ’ earnings forecasts, thereby avoiding negative earnings surprises before and after Regulation FD. Our findings show that firms hosting conference calls are more likely to guide analysts ’ forecasts downward and, as a result, they tend to successfully avoid negative earnings surprises in the pre Reg FD period. However, we do not find such relations in the post Reg FD period. We also find that the market reacts positively to firms hosting conference calls only in the post Reg FD period, consistent with the view that the market rewards a reduction in managers ’ opportunistic guidance to meet the analysts ’ earnings estimate...|$|E

Small towns {{up and down the}} coast are facing {{development}} pressures, population booms, environmental degradation, and loss of the working waterfront and traditional cultures.

The necessary information exists, but its not all in one place, its not easy to find and its hard to understand. This includes information on incorporation, smart growth, low impact development and economic renewal. Therefore, this guide pulls together all of the relevant information into one document and includes numerous examples. Information on current activities involving the problems Down East and on future research possibilities is also provided {{at the end of the}} resource document. Most importantly, the guide is a neutral and unbiased collection of relevant information. Therefore, I will not be making any recommendations at the end of the guide. I have simply tried to provide an unbiased summary of the information necessary for Down East residents to make an informed decision about their future...|$|E
