40|$|Trazodone and <b>dapiprazole</b> {{displace}} ligands binding to rat brain alpha- 1 adrenoceptors. The {{displacement of}} 3 H-ligands to alpha- 2, serotonin 1 (5 -HT 1), dopamine, beta and opiate receptors is either absent or {{takes place at}} relatively higher concentrations. Trazodone, unlike <b>dapiprazole,</b> also inhibits binding to serotonin 2 (5 -HT 2) receptors. Some pharmacological effects show a satisfactory correlation with these data. The psychopharmacological effects of trazodone and <b>dapiprazole</b> are similar, whereas the binding inhibition to 5 -HT 2 receptors is different, which could indicate that the psychopharmacological effects do not primarily depend on these receptors. The displacement of the binding to alpha- 1 adrenoceptors by <b>dapiprazole</b> has a time course {{similar to that of}} its brain concentrations as well as to that of sedative and alpha-blocking effects. <b>Dapiprazole</b> and trazodone have antinociceptive effects and inhibit the binding to opiate receptors, although at relatively high concentrations...|$|E
40|$|The {{activity}} of <b>dapiprazole,</b> clonidine and a placebo were studied to reduce abstinence symptoms and modify the psychological outline during a withdrawal period in heroin addicts. Forty heroin addicts were {{treated in a}} double-blind design and, within two weeks, relapse in heroin use was higher {{in the placebo group}} (8 / 10) in comparison with the <b>dapiprazole</b> (1 / 20) and clonidine (0 / 10) groups. During treatment clonidine was able to reduce depression and paranoid-ideas scores, whereas <b>dapiprazole</b> reduced depression, anxiety, hostility, phobic anxiety, obsessiveness and psychoticism. Side-effects were mild and it may be concluded that both <b>dapiprazole</b> and clonidine are effective and safe drugs for the treatment of opiate withdrawal syndrome...|$|E
40|$|Chronic {{amphetamine}} {{administration has}} been found to produce diuresis and polydipsia in rats. We have found that <b>dapiprazole</b> acutely suppresses the diuretic, but not the ingestive, effects of amphetamine. To see whether diuresis is the physiological stimulus driving amphetamine-mediated polydipsia, we injected rats daily with d,l-amphetamine and the alpha- 1 adrenergic antagonist <b>dapiprazole.</b> Throughout 19 days of treatment, <b>dapiprazole</b> completely prevented the increased urine output produced by amphetamine, but did not effect the development of polydipsia. This finding rules out a renal site of the primary action for amphetamine-mediated polydipsia and proposes water and electrolyte imbalance produced by chronic amphetamine administration as a model of the polydipsia and hyponatremia that develop in some psychotic patients...|$|E
40|$|To further {{explore the}} {{interaction}} between opiates and catecholamines in the control of water balance, we studied {{the effects of the}} alpha 1 -adrenoceptor antagonist <b>dapiprazole</b> on the modifications in drinking and diuresis produced by U- 50, 488 H (a selective kappa-opiate agonist), morphine, naloxone, and amphetamine in rats. Because animals were maintained in a free-feeding paradigm and water intake is also controlled by feeding (prandial drinking), food intake was also measured. At doses administered (3 - 6 mg/kg, IP), <b>dapiprazole</b> had no effect on basal food and water intake or on diuresis. Nor did it modify changes in feeding and drinking produced by U- 50, 488 H, morphine, naloxone, and amphetamine. It did, however, antagonize the diuretic effect of both U- 50, 488 H and amphetamine. In addition, suppression of diuresis was obtained by combining doses of <b>dapiprazole</b> and morphine or naloxone that were devoid of antidiuretic effects when administered independently. A further experiment showed that diuresis produced by water load was also prevented by <b>dapiprazole.</b> alpha 1 -Adrenoceptors thus appear {{to play a role in}} the regulation of water balance in a condition of free access to water, inhibiting diuresis without affecting drinking...|$|E
40|$|BACKGROUND [...] Patients {{who have}} their pupils dilated for an eye {{examination}} traditionally have to wait several hours before their pupils return to normal size and their blurred vision (caused by paralysis of accommodation) resolves. Earlier studies with <b>dapiprazole</b> have demonstrated an accelerated reversal of dilatation. METHODS [...] Three regimens of <b>dapiprazole</b> were studied {{to determine the effects}} on pupil diameter and accommodation after mydriasis produced by 2. 5 % phenylephrine and 0. 5 % tropicamide. Test regimens included one drop and 1 + 1 drop regimens, compared with a 2 + 2 drop reference regimen. <b>Dapiprazole</b> was administered in one eye and placebo in the other. Mean change from baseline was analysed for pupil diameter and accommodation at various time points after drug administration. Also, for the same variables, 90 % confidence intervals for the areas under the curve (AUC) were computed. RESULTS [...] Both test regimens were equivalent to the reference regimen on the basis of mean change from baseline for pupil diameter and accommodation at individual time points, and for the mean AUC. Most signs and symptoms (injection, stinging, burning, lid oedema, and ptosis) were less frequent in the test regimen treated eyes. There was no significant interaction between regimen and eye colour. CONCLUSION [...] This study indicates that a lower dosage (for example, one drop) is also efficacious and has the added benefit of fewer side effects...|$|E
40|$|Rationale There {{is a close}} {{relationship}} between arousal and pupil diameter, decrease {{in the level of}} arousal being accompanied by constriction of the pupil (miosis), probably reflecting the attenuation of sympathetic outflow as sedation sets in. Paradoxically, sedation induced by benzodiazepines is not accompanied by miosis. Objective The objective {{of this study was to}} examine the hypothesis that diazepam may attenuate both the sympathetic and the opposing parasympathetic outflow to the iris, which may mask the miosis. <b>Dapiprazole</b> (sympatholytic) and tropicamide (parasympatholytic) were applied topically, together with the cold pressor test (CPT), to manipulate the sympathetic/parasympathetic balance. Materials and methods Sixteen healthy male volunteers participated in four weekly sessions according to a balanced double-blind protocol. Diazepam 10 mg (two sessions) and placebo (two sessions), associated with either 0. 01 % tropicamide or 0. 5 % <b>dapiprazole</b> eyedrops, were administered orally. Pupil diameter, light and darkness reflexes and pupillary sleepiness waves were recorded with infrared video pupillometry, alertness was measured by critical flicker fusion frequency (CFFF) and visual analogue scales (VAS), blood pressure and heart rate by conventional methods. CPT was applied after post-treatment testing. Data were analysed by analysis of variance, with multiple comparisons. Results Diazepam caused sedation (reduction in VAS alertness scores and CFFF, increase in sleepiness waves), <b>dapiprazole</b> had a sympatholytic and tropicamide a parasympatholytic effect on the pupil. Diazepam had no effect on pupil diameter and reflexes or their modifications by the antagonists. CPT increased pupil diameter, blood pressure and heart rate, and the increase only in systolic blood pressure was attenuated by diazepam. Conclusions Diazepam-induced sedation is not accompanied by any change in either the sympathetic or parasympathetic influence on the iris...|$|E

We utilized selective blockade of pupillary sphincter or dilator muscles to isolate parasympathetic or sympathetic activity during cognition, without modifying central processes. Pupil diameter was measured during the light reaction in 29 normal adults under three processing levels: No Task, during an easy task (Add 1), or a difficult task (Subtract 7). At three separate sessions, the pupil was treated with placebo, tropicamide (blocking the muscarinic sphincter receptor), or <b>dapiprazole</b> (blocking the adrenergic dilator receptor). With placebo, pupil diameter increased with increasing task difficulty. The light reaction was reduced only in the Subtract 7 condition. <b>Dapiprazole</b> (which decreased overall diameter) showed similar task-related changes in diameter and light reflex as for placebo. Following tropicamide (which increased overall diameter), there was a further increase in diameter only in the difficult task. Findings suggest two separate inhibitory components at the parasympathetic oculomotor center. Changes in baseline diameter are likely related to reticular activation. Inhibition of the light reaction in the difficult task is likely associated with cortical afferents. Sustained sympathetic activity also was present during the difficult task...|$|E
40|$|<b>Dapiprazole</b> {{is a drug}} having {{specific}} alpha 1 adrenergic blocking properties. Following topical instillation on the eye, {{it crosses}} the corneal epithelium reaching high concentrations in the ocular tissue and producing a prompt miotic and hypotensive effect. The high concentration ratio between ciliary bodies and iris versus aqueous humor suggests a peculiar affinity for these structures containing adrenoceptors of the alpha type. The very low concentrations in the plasma, as compared to those after systemic administration, and in the fellow eye indicate that the systemic absorption is negligible. Â© 1986...|$|E

40|$|PURPOSE: To {{evaluate}} {{the effect of}} 3 types of topically applied miotic eyedrops on the pupil diameter in normal eyes. SETTING: Department of Neurosciences, Section of Ophthalmology, University of Pisa, Pisa, Italy. METHODS: This prospective study comprised 60 eyes of 30 healthy volunteers treated with aceclidine 0. 02 %, brimonidine tartrate 0. 20 %, and <b>dapiprazole</b> 0. 25 %. Pupil diameter was measured under scotopic, mesopic (4 lux), and photopic (50 lux) conditions using an infrared pupillometer incorporated into a CSO topographer. The first measurement was obtained before single instillation of 1 type of miotic eyedrop. Subsequent measurements were taken after 30, 120, and 240 minutes. Each additional medication was tested after an interval of at least 6 weeks to avoid possible effects from the previously administered drug. All patients received a questionnaire {{and were asked to}} grade the tolerability of each eyedrop using a subjective scoring system. RESULTS: Aceclidine 0. 02 % had no significant miotic effect. Brimonidine tartrate 0. 20 % caused significant miosis within 30 minutes and 120 minutes; after 240 minutes, the effect under all luminance conditions decreased to baseline levels without reaching the initial level. <b>Dapiprazole</b> 0. 25 % had a miotic effect similar to that of brimonidine but produced many side effects including hyperemia and burning, which many patients said caused significant discomfort. CONCLUSIONS: Brimonidine tartrate 0. 20 % had the best miotic effect of the 3 agents tested and was well tolerated by the patients. The reproducible miotic effect of brimonidine tartrate under all lighting conditions might benefit postoperative refractive patients who report night-vision difficulties related to large pupils...|$|E
40|$|In {{the present}} study we {{evaluate}} the effects of two associated adrenergic drugs, Epinephrine-Metipranolol (0. 3 %) and Epinephrine-Dapiprazole, on the intraocular pressure and pupil diameter. Twenty patients affected by open angle glaucoma have been selected into two groups; in the first group, endocular pressure and pupil diameter have been evaluated at the baseline, after topical instillation of Epinephrine and after topical instillation of Metipranolol; in the second group the same parameters have been evaluated at the baseline, after topical instillation of Epinephrine and after topical instillation of <b>Dapiprazole.</b> The results show that {{no significant differences were}} observed on the intraocular pressure between the two different groups. A significant difference in the pupil diameter was observed after topical instillation of Epinephrine-Metipranolol but not after Epinephrine-Dapiprazole. Epinephrine-Dapiprazole reduces endocular pressure without to modify pupil diameter so that can also be used in patients with narrow angle...|$|E
40|$|The {{in vitro}} {{permeation}} rate of <b>dapiprazole</b> base (DAP-B) through hairless mouse skin was investigated, as a preliminary step towards {{the development of}} a transdermal therapeutic system. The study involved the evaluation of the permeability coefficient of the drug applied to the skin in a series of liquid and semisolid vehicles, both in the absence and in the presence of different penetration enhancers. In liquid vehicles the permeability coefficient of DAP-B was significantly promoted (up to 73 times) by some terpenes (l-limonene, alpha-bisabolol, terpinolene) and by a mixture of unsaturated fatty acids. Similar effects were noted in semisolid vehicles, although the permeability coefficients were lower. Iontophoretic experiments on DAP-B in physiological saline solution, at constant current densities in the range of 0. 05 - 0. 5 mA/cm(2), produced up to 115 -fold permeability increases relative to passive diffusion. The present results, even if needing further corroboration by tests on human skin, evidenced the activity of some molecules as skin permeation enhancers for DAP-B, and confirmed the synergy between propylene glycol and the enhancers, already reported in the literature. The possibility of promoting DAP-B transport through the skin by iontophoresis was also established...|$|E
