With recent discoveries, the state has abundant natural <b>gas</b> <b>reserves</b> to support many more power generation plants, but lacks pipeline and transport infrastructure to deliver the fuel or electricity to India's national grid.|$|E
5|$|About 16hours {{before the}} storm moved through the Lesser Antilles, the {{government}} of Saint Lucia declared a tropical storm warning. Guadeloupe, Martinique, Dominica, St. Maarten, Saba, St. Eustatius, Puerto Rico and the U.S Virgin Islands issued tropical storm watches. Combined {{with the threat of}} Hurricane Charley, Bonnie forced the evacuation of 154oil platforms and 32oil rigs. The cease in production was equivalent to over 1.2million barrels of loss in crude oil, or 0.2% of the annual oil production in the Gulf of Mexico. Natural <b>gas</b> <b>reserves</b> were also limited. The lack of gas production due to the storms was equivalent to 7.4% of the total daily production in the Gulf of Mexico.|$|E

40|$|Reserve appreciation, {{also called}} reserve growth, is the {{increase}} in the estimated ultimate recovery (the sum of year end reserves and cumulative production) from fields subsequent to discovery from extensions, infield drilling, improved recovery of in-place resources, new pools, and intrapool completions. In recent years, reserve appreciation has become a major component of total U. S. annual natural <b>gas</b> <b>reserve</b> additions. Over the past 15 years, reserve appreciation has accounted for more than 80 percent of all annual natural <b>gas</b> <b>reserve</b> additions in the U. S. lower 48 states (Figure 1). The rise of natural <b>gas</b> <b>reserve</b> appreciation basically came with the judgment that reservoirs were much more geologically complex than generally thought, and they hold substantial quantities of natural gas in conventionally movable states that are not recovered by typical well spacing and vertical completion practices. Considerable evidence indicates that many reservoirs show significant geological variations and compartmentalization, and that uniform spacing, unless very dense, does not efficiently tap and drain a sizable volume of the reservoir (Figure 2). Further, by adding reserves within existing infrastructure and commonly by inexpensive recompletion technology in existing wells, reserve appreciation has become the dominant factor in ample, low-cost natural gas supply. Although there is a wide range in natural <b>gas</b> <b>reserve</b> appreciation potential by play and that potential is a function of drilling and technology applied, current natural <b>gas</b> <b>reserve</b> appreciation studies are gross, averaging wide ranges, disaggregated by broad natural gas provinces, and calculated mainly as a function of time. A much more detailed analysis of natural <b>gas</b> <b>reserve</b> appreciation aimed at assessing long-term sustainability, technological amenability, and economic factors, however, is necessary. The key to such analysis is a disaggregation to the play level. Plays are the geologically homogeneous subdivision of the universe of hydrocarbon pools within a basin. Typically, fields within a play share common hydrocarbon type, reservoir genesis, trapping mechanism, and source. Plays provide the comprehensive reference needed to more efficiently develop reservoirs, to extend field limits, and to better assess opportunities for intrafield exploration and development in mature natural gas provinces. Play disaggregation reveals current production trends and highlights areas for further exploration by identifying and emphasizing areas for potential reserve appreciation...|$|R

5|$|In 2014, total Scottish exports (excluding intra-UK trade) were {{estimated}} to be £27.5billion. Scotland's primary exports include whisky, electronics and financial services. The United States, Netherlands, Germany, France and Norway constitute the country's major export markets. Scotland's Gross Domestic Product (GDP), including oil and gas produced in Scottish waters, was estimated at £150 billion for the calendar year 2012. If Scotland became independent, it would hold 95% of the UK's current oil and <b>gas</b> <b>reserves</b> if they were split geographically using a median line from the English-Scottish border. If the reserves were split by population, that figure would be reduced to 9%.|$|E
5|$|Malaysia's energy {{infrastructure}} sector is largely dominated by Tenaga Nasional, the largest electric utility company in Southeast Asia, with over RM99.03 billion of assets. Customers {{are connected to}} electricity through the National Grid, with more than 420 transmission substations in the Peninsular linked together by approximately 11,000km of transmission lines operating at 132, 275 and 500 kilovolts. In 2013, Malaysia's total power generation capacity was over 29,728 megawatts. Total electricity generation was 140,985.01 GWh and total electricity consumption was 116,087.51 GWh. Energy production in Malaysia is largely based on oil and natural gas, owing to Malaysia's oil reserves and natural <b>gas</b> <b>reserves,</b> which is the fourth largest in Asia-Pacific after China, India and Vietnam.|$|E
5|$|On Earth it is {{relatively}} rare—5.2 ppm by volume in the atmosphere. Most terrestrial helium present today is created by the natural radioactive decay of heavy radioactive elements (thorium and uranium, although there are other examples), as the alpha particles emitted by such decays consist of helium-4 nuclei. This radiogenic helium is trapped with natural gas in concentrations as great as 7% by volume, from which it is extracted commercially by a low-temperature separation process called fractional distillation. Previously, terrestrial helium—a non-renewable resource, because once released into the atmosphere it readily escapes into space—was thought to be in increasingly short supply. However, recent studies suggest that helium produced deep in the earth by radioactive decay can collect in natural <b>gas</b> <b>reserves</b> in larger than expected quantities, in some cases having been released by volcanic activity.|$|E
50|$|A {{recent report}} (December 11, 2011) from Iran's Petroleum Minister {{indicates}} that a large natural <b>gas</b> <b>reserve</b> was discovered inside Iran's side of the Caspian Sea. These reserves are estimated at 50 trillion cubic feet (1.42 trillion cubic meter).|$|R
50|$|Natural gas {{accounts}} for about 70% of the country's commercial energy supply. According to a study conducted in 2003 by Hydrocarbon unit of the Energy and Mineral Resources Division and Norwegian Petroleum Directorate, the initial <b>gas</b> <b>reserve</b> of the 22 discovered gas fields of the country amounts to 28.4 trillion cubic feet (TCF) out of which 20.5 TCF is considered recoverable. In 2000, United States Geological Survey conducted a study for undiscovered <b>gas</b> <b>reserve</b> of the country. According this study, there are possibilities to explore another 32 TCF of natural gas. Another study conducted by Hydrocarbon Unit and Norwegian Petroleum Directorate in 2001 concluded that additional 42 TCF of natural gas could be discovered in the country.|$|R
50|$|Northern Marmara Gas Field was {{discovered}} in 1988 in an area 5 km west of Silivri and 2.5 km far off the coast {{at a depth of}} 1200 m. To determine the size of the natural <b>gas</b> <b>reserve,</b> which is the first undersea natural <b>gas</b> <b>reserve</b> in Turkey, three offshore boreholes in 1995 and two more were drilled in 1996. Natural gas production started in September 1997 at the five gas wells. Gas was pumped from an offshore platform by a 3 km-long undersea pipeline to the plant at the coast for processing. Between 2003 and 2004, six directional wells were drilled, which had vertical depths of 1200 - 1250 m and horizontal deviation of 2287 - 2947 m.|$|R

40|$|This study {{investigates the}} use of {{discretion}} by oil and gas companies in reporting financial performance and oil and <b>gas</b> <b>reserve</b> estimates during times of high political scrutiny resulting from increases in energy prices. Hypotheses tested in prior literature state that companies facing the risk of increasing taxes or new regulations reduce reported earnings to reduce this risk. This study uses a measure of high profitability (rank order of return on assets relative to industry peers) to identify oil and gas companies more likely to manage earnings {{during the period from}} 2002 to 2008. Two measures of discretionary accruals (total and current discretionary accruals), and a measure of discretionary depreciation, depletion, and amortization (DDA) were used as indicators of discretion exercised in reporting earnings. Data on oil and <b>gas</b> <b>reserve</b> disclosures was also hand-collected from Forms 10 -K to investigate whether managers use reserve estimate revisions to reduce reported earnings through increasing the annual depletion expense. Results suggest that both oil and gas refining and producing firms use negative discretionary accruals to reduce reported earnings. Results also indicate that profitability is an important determinant of {{the use of}} negative discretionary accruals by these companies regardless of the time period examined. There is also evidence that oil and gas producing firms opportunistically revise their oil and <b>gas</b> <b>reserve</b> estimates to increase depreciation, depletion, and amortization expense during periods of high oil prices...|$|R
