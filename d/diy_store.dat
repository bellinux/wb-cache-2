30|$|Respondents’ {{behaviour}} varied {{when it came}} to {{the frequency}} with which they visited the assessed <b>DIY</b> <b>stores.</b> Millennials visited <b>DIY</b> <b>stores</b> most often (7.9 %), followed by Gen Xers (5.4 %), while many Baby Boomers (6.9 %) and Zers (10.4 %) visited them once a year or less. <b>DIY</b> <b>stores</b> were visited several times a year by Millennials (16.8 %) and Gen Xers (10.6 %), which leads to the conclusion that members of these two generations either build their own houses or decorate them and, consequently, purchase more frequently from DIY retailers. These findings are similar to previous studies (Gurtoo et al., 2010).|$|R

30|$|The {{empirical}} {{research shows that}} each segment of consumers corresponding to a generation can be clearly delineated {{with respect to the}} values and elements influencing their behaviour towards the green <b>DIY</b> <b>stores.</b> Generational theory has a practical application in this case: Baby Boomers represent the generation that has realized, in the autumn of life, the need to protect the environment and be more socially responsible, and chooses green <b>DIY</b> <b>stores</b> depending {{on the extent to which}} personal sacrifice to protect the environment, as well as social responsibility measures, is in harmony with retailers’ market strategy. Gen Xers prefer green <b>DIY</b> <b>stores</b> because they sell commodities enabling them to use resources in a rational way, and to bequeath a clean environment to future generations (their children). Millennials represent the generation educated in accordance with social responsibility and environmental protection principles and norms who choose green <b>DIY</b> <b>stores</b> according to which strategies for pollution reduction overlap with their own aspirations and perceptions. Generation Z is the one for which the choice of green <b>DIY</b> <b>stores</b> depends most on the financial sacrifice they have to make to this effect.|$|R

30|$|Generation Z is {{the target}} group for which the (financial) {{sacrifice}} {{needed to make a}} contribution to environmental protection was the most important dimension in their choice of green <b>DIY</b> retail <b>stores</b> (0.495 **). Zers seemed to be the most sensitive to “financial” issues, probably because they had modest incomes from seasonal employment and were financially dependent on their parents. As green European-based <b>DIY</b> <b>stores</b> (Table 3) were least visited by members of Generation Z, the results in Table 4 seem to confirm that, despite their education about the need to protect the environment (0.171 *), they made limited use of it, as they were unlikely to frequently purchase products from <b>DIY</b> <b>stores</b> (Table 4).|$|R

30|$|Gen Xers {{exhibits}} {{a strong and}} favourable penchant for environmental protection (0.370 **) which actually determined their choice of environmentally oriented European-based <b>DIY</b> <b>stores.</b> The (financial) sacrifice entailed in the purchase of green products (0.248 **) was also a good enough reason to choose these green <b>DIY</b> <b>stores.</b> Although their behaviour did not show an active awareness, Gen Xers had a good education on environmental protection and social responsibility, being {{aware of the need}} to protect it and wishing to use green products {{only to the extent that}} their consumption did not have adverse effects on nature (Table 4).|$|R
30|$|For Millennials (Gen Y) the {{education}} on {{environmental protection and}} social responsibility (0.343 **) has a significant influence in making them choose green <b>DIY</b> <b>stores,</b> with an impact of high relationship strength and significance.

Education on environmental protection and social responsibility prompted them to take action, while their green orientation made them believe that, through their competencies, they had a share in protecting nature and reducing the consumption of resources (Table 4).|$|R

40|$|Background We {{studied the}} {{prevalence}} and aetiology of penetrating ocular injuries, in particular {{ones that were}} sustained whilst undertaking Do It Yourself (DIY) or gardening in the domestic environment. We also examined the extent of eye safety promotion in <b>DIY</b> <b>stores</b> and garden centres and on their websites. Methods We conducted a case note review of patients who underwent surgery for penetrating ocular trauma between January 2000 and June 2004. Eight <b>DIY</b> <b>stores</b> and garden centres and 10 websites were visited and evaluated using standardized questions. Results Of the 85 patients identified, 35 (41. 2 %) patients had injuries {{that occurred in the}} home with 10 patients having visual acuities of < 6 / 60 at final follow up. Accidents from DIY or gardening were the cause in 17 of 33 (51. 5 %) patients, with a failure to wear eye protection in all cases. Overall, <b>DIY</b> <b>stores</b> and garden centres were poor at promoting eye safety both in their stores and on their websites. Conclusion The home is a frequent place for severe penetrating ocular injury, with highly popular pastimes such as DIY and gardening as common causes. As many of these injuries are preventable, additional safety information is essential to educate the public on the potential dangers of these pastimes...|$|R
