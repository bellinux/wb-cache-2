60|$|As I walked I {{extended}} my plan. I {{could not}} march three hundred {{miles to the}} frontier. I would board a train in motion and hide under the seats, on the roof, on the couplings--anywhere. What train should I take? The first, of course. After walking for two hours I perceived the signal lights of a station. I left the line, and, circling round it, hid in the ditch by the track about 200 yards beyond it. I argued that the train would stop at the station {{and that it would}} not have got up too much speed by the time it reached me. An hour passed. I began to grow impatient. Suddenly I heard the whistle and the approaching rattle. Then the great yellow <b>head</b> <b>lights</b> of the engine flashed into view. The train waited five minutes at the station and started again with much noise and steaming. I crouched by the track. I rehearsed the act in my mind. I must wait until the engine had passed, otherwise I should be seen. Then I must make a dash for the carriages.|$|E
