40|$|This paper {{describes}} {{the work done}} to develop a bolometer post processor that converts volumetric <b>radiated</b> <b>power</b> values taken from a UEDGE solution, to a line integrated <b>radiated</b> <b>power</b> along chords of the bolometers in the DIII-D tokamak. The UEDGE code calculates plasma physics quantities, such as plasma density, <b>radiated</b> <b>power,</b> or electron temperature, and compares them to actual diagnostic measurements taken from the scrape off layer (SOL) and divertor regions of the DIII-D tokamak. Bolometers are devices measuring <b>radiated</b> <b>power</b> within the tokamak. The bolometer interceptors {{are made up of}} two complete arrays, an upper array with a vertical view and a lower array with a horizontal view, so that a two dimensional profile of the <b>radiated</b> <b>power</b> may be obtained. The bolometer post processor stores line integrated values taken from UEDGE solutions into a file in tabular format. Experimental data is then put into tabular form and placed in another file. Comparisons can be made between the UEDGE solutions and actual bolometer data. Analysis has been done to determine the accuracy of the plasma physics involved in producing UEDGE simulations...|$|R

50|$|According to {{classical}} electromagnetism, {{the number of}} electromagnetic modes in a 3-dimensional cavity, per unit frequency, {{is proportional to the}} square of the frequency. This therefore implies that the <b>radiated</b> <b>power</b> per unit frequency should follow the Rayleigh-Jeans law, and be proportional to frequency squared. Thus, both the power at a given frequency and the total <b>radiated</b> <b>power</b> is unlimited as higher and higher frequencies are considered: this is clearly unphysical as the total <b>radiated</b> <b>power</b> of a cavity is not observed to be infinite, a point that was made independently by Einstein and by Lord Rayleigh and Sir James Jeans in 1905.|$|R
