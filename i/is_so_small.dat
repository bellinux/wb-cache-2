25|$|The {{neutrino}} is {{so named}} because it is electrically neutral and because its rest mass <b>is</b> <b>so</b> <b>small</b> (-ino) that it was originally thought to be zero. The weak force has a very short range, gravity is extremely weak on the subatomic scale, and neutrinos, as leptons, {{do not participate in}} the strong interaction.

25|$|There are {{a number}} of whistle {{phenomena}} in which heat plays a role. The temperature in a sound wave varies, but since it <b>is</b> <b>so</b> <b>small</b> normally it is common to neglect its effects.

25|$|The Junaluska {{salamander}} (Eurycea junaluska) is {{a species}} of lungless salamander native to the Southeastern United States. The Junaluska salamander’s breeding habits tend to be in large streams where the eggs are laid and attached {{to the bottom of}} rocks in the streams where they are found. According to the overall conservation listing for IUCN, this species is listed as Vulnerable. Conservation acts are important in both North Carolina and Eastern Tennessee, since the population of this species in each state <b>is</b> <b>so</b> <b>small.</b>|$|E
25|$|Similarly {{to the way}} {{in which}} atoms and {{molecules}} emit electromagnetic radiation, a gravitating mass that is in quadrupole type or higher order vibration, or is asymmetric and in rotation, can emit gravitational waves. These gravitational waves are predicted to travel at the speed of light. For example, planets orbiting the Sun constantly lose energy via gravitational radiation, but this effect <b>is</b> <b>so</b> <b>small</b> that it is unlikely it will be observed in the near future (Earth radiates about 200 watts (see gravitational waves) of gravitational radiation).|$|E

25|$|The {{speed of}} the star around the system's center of mass is much smaller {{than that of the}} planet, because the radius of its orbit around the center of mass <b>is</b> <b>so</b> <b>small.</b> (For example, the Sun moves by about 13m/s due to Jupiter, but only about 9cm/s due to Earth). However, {{velocity}} variations down to 1m/s or even somewhat less can be detected with modern spectrometers, such as the HARPS (High Accuracy Radial Velocity Planet Searcher) spectrometer at the ESO 3.6 meter telescope in La Silla Observatory, Chile, or the HIRES spectrometer at the Keck telescopes.|$|E
25|$|Lambda (λ), {{commonly}} known as the cosmological constant, describes the ratio of the density of dark energy to the critical energy density of the universe, given certain reasonable assumptions such as positing that dark energy density is a constant. In terms of Planck units, and as a natural dimensionless value, the cosmological constant, λ, is on the order of 10−122. This <b>is</b> <b>so</b> <b>small</b> that it has no significant effect on cosmic structures that are smaller than a billion light-years across. If the cosmological constant were not extremely small, stars and other astronomical structures {{would not be able to}} form.|$|E
25|$|In April 2011, the United States Department of Energy {{published}} {{projections of}} the radiation risks {{over the next year}} (that is, for the future) for people living in the neighborhood of the plant. Potential exposure could exceed 20mSv/year (2 rems/year) in some areas up to 50kilometers from the plant. That is the level at which relocation would be considered in the USA, and it is a level that could cause roughly one extra cancer case in 500 young adults. However, natural radiation levels are higher {{in some parts of the}} world than the projected level mentioned above, and about 4 people out of 10 can be expected to develop cancer without exposure to radiation. Further, the radiation exposure resulting from the incident for most people living in Fukushima <b>is</b> <b>so</b> <b>small</b> compared to background radiation that it may be impossible to find statistically significant evidence of increases in cancer.|$|E

25|$|Within the chamber, {{electrically}} isolated cylindrical electrodes are placed, whose length {{varies with the}} distance along the pipe. The length of each electrode {{is determined by the}} frequency and power of the driving power source {{and the nature of the}} particle to be accelerated, with shorter segments near the source and longer segments near the target. The mass of the particle has a large effect on the length of the cylindrical electrodes; for example an electron is considerably lighter than a proton and so will generally require a much smaller section of cylindrical electrodes as it accelerates very quickly. Likewise, because its mass <b>is</b> <b>so</b> <b>small,</b> electrons have much less kinetic energy than protons at the same speed. Because of the possibility of electron emissions from highly charged surfaces, the voltages used in the accelerator have an upper limit, so this can't be as simple as just increasing voltage to match increased mass.|$|E
25|$|Back at UNIT, Captain Mike Yates and Sergeant Benton were {{watching}} {{the end of the}} broadcast as it went dead. In the morning they arrive at the village just as a heatwave engulfs the village. The Brigadier finds himself unable to enter the village, as there is an invisible dome-shaped barrier, 10 miles in diameter and one mile high, surrounding it that causes anything trying to enter to heat up and burst into flame. The barrier is centred on the church. He contacts Yates and is briefed on the situation while the Doctor and Jo return to the dig where they find a small spaceship in the mound, which has been condensed. From this, the Doctor realises that the Master is trying to conjure up an ancient and all-powerful demon, who is seen on Earth to be the Devil, but actually an alien. The Doctor explains that the Dæmons have influenced Earth throughout its history, becoming part of human myth, and see the planet as a giant experiment. The Master has called the Dæmon up once, and right now, it <b>is</b> <b>so</b> <b>small</b> as to be invisible. The third summoning, however, could signal the end of the experiment, and the world.|$|E
25|$|Exchange {{interactions}} {{occur when}} the substance is not magnetically dilute and there are interactions between individual magnetic centres. One of the simplest systems to exhibit the result of exchange interactions is crystalline copper(II) acetate, Cu2(OAc)4(H2O)2. As the formula indicates, it contains two copper(II) ions. The Cu2+ ions are held together by four acetate ligands, each of which binds to both copper ions. Each Cu2+ ion has a d9 electronic configuration, and so should have one unpaired electron. If there were a covalent bond between the copper ions, the electrons would pair up and the compound would be diamagnetic. Instead, there is an exchange interaction in which the spins of the unpaired electrons become partially aligned to each other. In fact two states are created, one with spins parallel {{and the other with}} spins opposed. The energy difference between the two states <b>is</b> <b>so</b> <b>small</b> their populations vary significantly with temperature. In consequence the magnetic moment varies with temperature in a sigmoidal pattern. The state with spins opposed has lower energy, so the interaction can be classed as antiferromagnetic in this case. It is believed that {{this is an example of}} superexchange, mediated by the oxygen and carbon atoms of the acetate ligands. Other dimers and clusters exhibit exchange behaviour.|$|E
