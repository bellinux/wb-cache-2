500|$|M.challengeri is a {{significant}} prey item for ling, {{as well as being}} an important <b>fishery</b> <b>species</b> for human consumption; trawlers catch around [...] per year under the limitations of New Zealand's Quota Management System. The species was first collected by the Challenger expedition of 1872–1876, but only described as separate from related species by Heinrich Balss in 1914. Although originally classified in the genus Nephrops, it was moved in 1972 to a new genus, Metanephrops, along with most other species then classified in Nephrops.|$|E
