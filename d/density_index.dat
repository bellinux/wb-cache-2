40|$|Density {{management}} diagrams (DMDs) {{are used}} to quickly examine alternative density management regimes. DMDs are based upon several ecological concepts, and thus demonstrate links between quantitative silviculture and ecology. We group the important ecological concepts incorporated into DMDs into three broad categories: (1) the generality of allometric relationships; (2) the nature of size-density relationships; and (3) the ability of relative <b>density</b> <b>indices</b> to characterize stand development. We review the evidence {{for each of these}} categories as they are applied in DMDs. There is strong evidence for the application of allometric relationships to predict stand yield and for the ability of relative <b>density</b> <b>indices</b> to characterize elements of stand development. Some ambiguity exists concerning the application of size-density relationships. Specifically, there is some evidence indicating that maximum size-density relationships may vary with genetics, management practices, and environmental conditions.

40|$|Background: Ghrelin and peptide YY (PYY) are {{appetite}} regulating hormones secreted {{from the}} gastrointestinal tract (gut). Aside from their known effect on energy homeostasis, accumulating data indicates that these gut hormones also affect bone metabolism. However, data regarding {{the influence of}} ghrelin and PYY on bone density in humans is very limited, {{and the results are}} inconclusive. Therefore, {{this study was designed to}} investigate the potential association between circulating ghrelin and PYY with bone <b>density</b> <b>indices</b> in the general population. Methods: A total of 2257 adult subjects from the CODING (Complex Diseases in the Newfoundland Population: Environment and Genetics) study participated in this investigation. Acylated ghrelin and total PYY were measured in serum after a 12 -hour fasting, with the Enzyme- Linked Immunosorbent Assay (ELISA) method. Bone mineral density was measured by dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry at the spine, femoral neck, and total hip. Multiple regression analyses adjusting for age, BMI, physical activity, smoking, and alcohol consumption were employed to analyze the association between serum ghrelin and PYY with bone mineral density parameters. Results: Significant positive associations of ghrelin concentration with L 2 -L 4 BMD, L 2 -L 4 Z-score, femoral neck BMD, femoral neck Z-score, total hip BMD, and total hip Z-score were found in women.

40|$|We {{present a}} {{detailed}} 1. 2 mm continuum and CS spectral line {{study of a}} large sample of 69 massive star forming regions in very early stages of evolution, most of them prior to building up an ultracompact HII region. The continuum data show a zoo of different morphologies and give detailed information on the spatial distributions, the masses, column densities and average densities of the whole sample. Fitting the radial intensity profiles shows that three parameters are needed to describe the spatial distribution of the sources: constant emission from the center out to a few arcsec radius followed by a first power law intensity distribution which steepens further outside into a second power law distribution. The mean inner power law intensity index mi (I~r^(-mi)) is 1. 2 corresponding to <b>density</b> <b>indices</b> p (n~r^(-p)) of 1. 6. In total the density distribution of our massive star formations sites seem to be not too different from their low-mass counterparts, but we show that setting tight constrains on the <b>density</b> <b>indices</b> is very difficult and subject to many possible errors. The local densities we derive from CS calculations are higher (up to one order of magnitude) than the mean densities we find via the mm-continuum. Such inhomogeneous density distribution reflects most likely the ubiquitous phenomenon of clumping and fragmentation in molecular clouds.
