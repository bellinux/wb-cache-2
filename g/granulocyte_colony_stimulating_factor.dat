Supernatants from resting and phytohaemagglutinin stimulated cells were studied and supernatants that strongly promoted DNA synthesis were pooled, and growth factor activity partially characterised. The effects of recombinant interleukins- 1 beta, 2, 3,interferon-gamma, and <b>granulocyte</b> macrophage <b>colony</b> <b>stimulating</b> <b>factor</b> were tested in the same system. Resting lamina propria mononuclear cells produce factors that increase DNA synthesis. Production of these factors is increased by phytohaemagglutinin stimulation.

The size and zeta potential values were measured. Enzyme and serum stability of complexes were studied. In vitro transfection properties of complexes were studied in HeLa cells. According to agarose gel electrophoresis, full complexation was obtained at 0. 1 / 1 and higher chitosan/pGM-CSF ratios. Complexes having about 132 nm size and + 13. 7 mV zeta potential value were obtained. Chitosan complexes protected plasmid against enzymatic and serum effects. The gene expression-dependent cell proliferation after transfection of chitosan/pGM-CSF complexes at 72 h was markedly increased in comparision with the level of control group. These results indicate that the effect of chitosan/pGM-CSF complexes on cell proliferation was changed with N/P ratio and time-dependently.

40|$|AbstractThe use of {{high-dose}} chemotherapy with autologous {{support of}} hematopoietic progenitor cells {{is an effective}} strategy to treat various hematologic neoplasms, such as non-Hodgkin lymphomas and multiple myeloma. Mobilized peripheral blood progenitor cells are {{the main source of}} support for autologous transplants, and collection of an adequate number of hematopoietic progenitor cells is a critical step in the autologous transplant procedure. Traditional strategies, based on the use of growth factors with or without chemotherapy, have limitations even when remobilizations are performed. Granulocyte colony-stimulating factor is the most widely used agent for progenitor cell mobilization. The association of plerixafor, a C-X-C Chemokine receptor type 4 (CXCR 4) inhibitor, to <b>granulocyte</b> <b>colony</b> <b>stimulating</b> <b>factor</b> generates rapid mobilization of hematopoietic progenitor cells. A literature review was performed of randomized studies comparing different mobilization schemes in the treatment of multiple myeloma and lymphomas to analyze their limitations and effectiveness in hematopoietic progenitor cell mobilization for autologous transplant. This analysis showed that the addition of plerixafor to <b>granulocyte</b> <b>colony</b> <b>stimulating</b> <b>factor</b> is well tolerated and results in a greater proportion of patients with non-Hodgkin lymphomas or multiple myeloma reaching optimal CD 34 + cell collections with a smaller number of apheresis compared the use of <b>granulocyte</b> <b>colony</b> <b>stimulating</b> <b>factor</b> alone...|$|E
40|$|Background—In several {{diseases}} {{there is}} a relation between deficiency of neutrophil granulocytes and granulomatous lesions. Recently, in glycogen storage disease type Ib, this relation has been supported by the beneficial effect of treatment of enteritis with granulocyte-macrophage colony stimulating factor.  Aim—To investigate whether chronic granulomatous disease could be treated according to the same principle.  Patients and methods—Inflammatory lesions were monitored in two brothers with chronic granulomatous disease demonstrated by very low superoxide production in neutrophil granulocytes. The two patients were treated with recombinant human <b>granulocyte</b> <b>colony</b> <b>stimulating</b> <b>factor</b> on three occasions when the disease was active.  Results—In one patient, remission of an inflamed stenosis of the colon sigmoideum was shown by granulocyte scintigraphy after one month of treatment with <b>granulocyte</b> <b>colony</b> <b>stimulating</b> <b>factor.</b> In the other patient, remission of colon disease and later of a non-malignant tumour in the right lung hilum was shown by colonoscopy and computed tomography scans respectively.  Conclusion—Remission of inflammatory lesions in two brothers with chronic granulomatous disease was induced by <b>granulocyte</b> <b>colony</b> <b>stimulating</b> <b>factor</b> on three occasions.

40|$|The use of {{recombinant}} human <b>granulocyte</b> <b>colony</b> <b>stimulating</b> <b>factors</b> (G-CSF) {{has become an}} integral part of supportive care during cytotoxic chemotherapy. Current guidelines recommend the use of G-CSF in patients with substantial risk of febrile neutropenia. However, little consensus exists about optimal timing and tailoring of this therapy. Based on the known effects of chemotherapy and G-CSF on bone marrow compartments, we propose a model that supports the prophylactic rather than therapeutic use of G-CSF therapy. In addition, several genetic alterations in G-CSF signalling pathway have been described. These genetic variants may predict the risk of febrile neutropenia and response to G-CSF. Thus, future pharmacogenetic/omics studies in this field are warranted. Through the identification of patients at risk and the knowledge of biological basis for optimal timing, hopefully we should soon be able to improve the application of the existing guidelines for G-CSF therapy and patient's prognosis...|$|R

METHODS: Sixty-eight patients undergoing antiviral treatment for post-liver transplantation (OLT) HCV recurrence were enrolled. All patients developing neutropenia received G-CSF. RESULTS: Twenty three (34 %) received G-CSF. Mean neutrophil count {{at the onset of}} neutropenia was 700 /mmc (range 400 - 750 /mmc); after 1 mo of G-CSF it increased to 1210 /mmc (range 300 - 5590 /mmc) (P < 0. 0001). Three patients did not respond to G-CSF. Treatment duration was similar in neutropenic and non-neutropenic patients. No differences in the rate of discontinuation, infections or virological response were observed between the two groups. G-CSF was protective for the onset of de novo autoimmune hepatitis (P < 0. 003).
