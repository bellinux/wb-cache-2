2500|$|The Series III had {{the same}} body and engine options as the {{preceding}} IIa, including station wagons and the 1 Ton versions. Little changed cosmetically from the IIA to the Series III. The Series III {{is the most common}} Series vehicle, with 440,000 of the type built from 1971 to 1985. The headlights were moved to the wings on late production IIA models from 1968/9 onward (ostensibly to comply with Australian, American and Dutch lighting regulations) and remained in this position for the Series III. The traditional metal grille, featured on the Series I, II and IIA, was replaced with a plastic one for the Series III model. The 2.25-litre engine had its compression raised from 7:1 to 8:1, increasing the power slightly (the high compression engine had been an optional fit on the IIa model for several years). During the Series III production run from 1971 until 1985, the 1,000,000th Land Rover rolled off the production line in 1976. The Series III saw many changes in the later part of its life as Land Rover updated the design to meet increased competition. This was the first model to feature synchromesh on all four gears, although some late H-suffix SIIA models (mainly the more expensive Station Wagons) had used the all-synchro box. In keeping with early 1970s trends in automotive interior design, both in safety and use of more advanced materials, the simple metal dashboard of earlier models was redesigned to accept a new moulded plastic dash. The instrument cluster, which was previously centrally located, was moved to the driver's side. Long-wheelbase Series III vehicles had the Salisbury rear axle (the <b>differential</b> <b>housing</b> and axle case are one piece) as standard, although some late SIIA [...] vehicles had them too.|$|E

40|$|Housing {{discrimination}} {{is a common}} problem experienced by disadvantaged groups in Torontos private housing markets, including newcomers. As a result, distribution {{of the burden of}} affordable housing shortage is skewed against members of the affected groups, exacerbating their vulnerabilities and exposing them to ill-health. Using one-on-one research interviews, my research investigated newcomers perceptions on how their experiences with housing discrimination related to their health. It began by exploring newcomers experiences with <b>differential</b> impact <b>housing</b> discrimination in Torontos private rental housing market: landlords/ housing providers application of various rules on disadvantaged house-seekers without making necessary accommodations {{to level the playing field}} for them, which aggravates their position of disadvantage. To contextualize newcomers experiences with <b>differential</b> impact <b>housing</b> discrimination, I examined the environment in which it was experienced, including, other forms of discrimination that may have intersected with and compounded its impact; as well as factors that enabled such discrimination to occur despite legislation against it. The research revealed widespread experiences with <b>differential</b> impact <b>housing</b> discrimination among newcomers, such as landlords requirement for possession of proof of employment, Canadian credit history in order to qualify for private rental housing. Demands by some landlords for payment of illegal large deposits and key money, were also revealed. Real and perceived forms of housing discrimination based on race, ethnicity and gender, practiced alongside <b>differential</b> impact <b>housing</b> discrimination were also exposed: <b>differential</b> treatment <b>housing</b> discrimination by definition. While racialized newcomers experienced these different forms of housing discrimination, their white counterparts did not. Affected newcomers reported experiencing health problems such as stress, anxiety, hypertension, and asthma while they were experiencing housing discrimination and after. They blamed their experiences with housing discrimination for aggravating their situations and contributing to the negative health outcomes...|$|R
5000|$|In the new system, as with {{a normal}} FWD car, the {{transmission}} contains a differential that drives the front wheels. However, an extra shaft from this differential also drives a bevel gear housed in the transfer case that permanently turns a driveshaft for the rear wheels (i.e. {{there is no longer}} a [...] "center" [...] <b>differential).</b> <b>Housed</b> in the rear differential is a viscous coupling that in normal conditions is disengaged. This means that for general driving, the system is FWD only. When the computer detects slippage of the front wheels, the viscous coupling engages and transfers up to 50% of the torque to the rear wheels. This system is superior in some aspects as there is less energy loss due to the normal FWD operation, however it is no longer a full-time 4WD system.|$|R

40|$|This paper {{investigates the}} long-run {{convergence}} of regional house {{prices in the}} UK. Using a variety of econometric methods, existing studies have failed to reach a consensus {{on whether or not}} regional house prices are cointegrated and exhibit long-run constancy relative to each other. We propose the application of a new test that combines principal components analysis with unit root testing to throw new light on the regional convergence debate. Using mix-adjusted quarterly house price data for 1973 - 2005, we find that existing unit root and cointegration methodologies indicate the presence of multiple stochastic trends with, at best, very weak evidence of long-run convergence. However, testing for the stationarity of the largest principal component based on regional <b>house</b> price <b>differentials</b> suggests that all UK regional house prices are driven by a single common stochastic trend and can be regarded as exhibiting strong convergence in the long-run. Further analysis suggests there is a high degree of persistence in regional <b>house</b> price <b>differentials.</b> <b>House</b> prices, convergence, unit roots, cointegration, principal components...|$|R

30|$|A {{fundamental}} constraint for {{affordable housing}} in leading regions {{is the lack}} of access to credit and underdeveloped mortgage markets. Financial markets, together with the services they provide, such as mortgages and other loans, are crucial for labor mobility (Hoj [2011]; Coulson and Fisher [2009]; Haurin and Gill [2002]; van Leuvensteijn and Koning [2004]). Well-functioning credit markets can help both in financing the move itself and also in financing housing arrangements at destination.

Improvements in the credit and mortgage markets that result in lower interest rates are likely to have a feedback effect on housing prices.|$|R
