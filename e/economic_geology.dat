The BEG/HRC secured several substantial donations of rock materials and/or cash during this operating period. All of these funds went directly into the endowment. Outreach during 2004 and 2005 included many technical presentations and several publications on the HRC. Several field trips to the facility were held for geoscience professionals and grade school students alike. Goals for the upcoming year involve securing more donations of rock material and cash in order to fully fund the HRC endowment.

40|$|The Bureau of <b>Economic</b> <b>Geology's</b> Houston Research Center (HRC) is well {{established}} as a premier regional research center for geologic research serving not only Houston, but geoscientists from around Texas, the U.

As reported in the FY 05 and FY 06 technical progress reports to the DOE, the HRC provides a state-of-the-art core viewing facility, two fully equipped conference rooms, and a comprehensive technical library, all available for public use. In addition, the HRC currently now houses over 725, 000 boxes of rock material (as of January 2008), and has space to hold approximately 300, 000 more boxes. Use of the facility has remained strong; the number of patrons averaged over 100 per month from June 1, 2006 to October 2007, and 90, 000 boxes of core were donated to, and received by, the HRC during this time. Usage {{is a combination of}} individuals describing core, groups of geoscientists holding seminars and workshops, and various industry and government-funded groups holding short courses, workshops, and seminars. These numbers are in addition to the numerous daily requests from patrons desiring to have rock material shipped offsite to their own offices. The BEG/HRC secured several substantial donations of rock materials and cash totaling approximately $ 2. 2 million during the 2005 - 2006 operating period. All of these funds went directly into an endowment that UT is building in order to operate the HRC primarily off a portion of the interest generated by the fund. Specific details regarding the funds in the endowment are addressed in a table later in this report. Outreach during 2005 and 2006 included many technical presentations and several publications on the HRC. Several field trips to the facility were held for geoscience professionals and grade school students alike. Goals for the upcoming year involve securing a major donation of rock material and cash in order to approach full funding of the HRC endowment. Thanks to donations totaling $ 2. 2 million from Shea Homes (heritage Unocal rock material),Chevron and others this operating year, the HRC endowment now totals $ 8, 015, 621. A major project underway for the HRC in FY 2007 is improvement of the existing online core/log database into a geoinformatics-compatible, GIS-driven online system. Usage of the HRC has gone up every year and is now very respectable. This year we will strive to raise awareness of the HRC's 100, 000 -volume geoscience technical library. Our original business model targeted $ 10 million in endowment; after several years of operation we realize we require an $ 11 million endowment. We are 'on plan' and need only $ 3 million to fully fund the endowment. To meet these goals in the 2007 operating year will require DOE support for the fifth and final year. DOW support will allow for {approx}$ 600 K in endowment growth and save using the fund for operation; lack of support will result in a net negative spread of up to $ 1 million, and set the plan way back. We recognize that DOE budgets for oil and gas research, against best efforts, have been cut substantially this year. Any support available for HRC operation, during continuing resolution or otherwise, would have a very positive impact on this critical final year of the original business plan...|$|R
40|$|Throughout the {{developing}} world, river {{sand and gravel}} is widely exploited as aggregate for construction. Sediment is often mined directly from the river channel and makes {{an important contribution to}} the national demand for aggregates. However, instream mining, if not carefully controlled, can cause significant damage to the river and its associated biota, and to the adjacent land, as well as creating conflict with other users of the river. The <b>economic</b> and environmental <b>geology</b> of river sand and gravel mining in developing countries is poorly known and there is little knowledge available to inform existing regulatory strategies. Research work on selected river systems in Jamaica and Costa Rica has generated a considerable amount of new information on resources and sediment budgets, on market and supply options, on the physical, biological and social impacts of extraction, and on best-practice legislative and mineral planning issues. A methodology has been developed for effective control of instream sand and gravel mining operations including a Code of Practice, which regulators can use for examining and reconciling the conflicting claims of sand and gravel extraction and the environment...|$|R
40|$|Oregon's {{geothermal}} resources {{represent a}} large portion of the nation's total geothermal potential. The State's resources are substantial in size, widespread in location, and presently in various stages of discovery and utilization. The exploration for, and development of, geothermal is presently dependent upon a mixture of engineering, economic, environmental, and legal factors. In response to the State's significant geothermal energy potential, and the emerging impediments and incentives for its development, the State of Oregon has begun a planning program intended to accelerate the environmentally prudent utilization of geothermal, while conserving the resource's long-term productivity. The program, which is based upon preliminary work performed by the Oregon Institute of Technology's Geo-Heat Center, will be managed by the Oregon Department of Energy, with the assistance of the Departments of <b>Economic</b> Development, <b>Geology</b> and Mineral Industries, and Water Resources. Funding support for the program is being provided by the US Department of Energy. The first six-month phase of the program, beginning in July 1980, will include the following five primary tasks: (1) coordination of state and local agency projects and information, in order to keep geothermal personnel abreast of the rapidly expanding resource literature, resource discoveries, technological advances, and each agency's projects. (2) Analysis of resource commercialization impediments and recommendations of incentives for accelerating resource utilization. (3) Compilation and dissemination of Oregon geothermal information, in order to create public and potential user awareness, and to publicize technical assistance programs and financial incentives. (4) Resource planning assistance for local governments in order to create local expertise and action; including a statewide workshop for local officials, and the formulation of two specific community resource development plans.

2500|$|From this {{increased}} interest {{in the nature of}} the Earth and its origin, came a heightened attention to minerals and other components of the Earth’s crust. Moreover, the increasing economic importance of mining in Europe during the mid to late 18th century made the possession of accurate knowledge about ores and their natural distribution vital. Scholars began to study the makeup of the Earth in a systematic manner, with detailed comparisons and descriptions not only of the land itself, but of the semi-precious metals it contained, which had great commercial value. For example, in 1774 Abraham Gottlob Werner published the book Von den äusserlichen Kennzeichen der Fossilien (On the External Characters of Minerals), which brought him widespread recognition because he presented a detailed system for identifying specific minerals based on external characteristics. [...] The more efficiently productive land for mining could be identified and the semi-precious metals could be found, the more money could be made. This drive for <b>economic</b> gain propelled <b>geology</b> into the limelight and made it a popular subject to pursue. With an increased number of people studying it, came more detailed observations and more information about the Earth.|$|R
40|$|The authors thank C. Stillman, R. Tilling and A. Kerr {{for long}} hours {{dedicated}} to the careful revision of this chapter and for their very helpful comments. Book Description This book provides the first comprehensive account in English of the geology of mainland Spain and the Balearic and Canary Islands. It has been written by 159 research-active, mostly Spanish authors working together in teams from over 20 universities and other centres of research excellence. The 19 chapters begin with an overview of Spanish geology prepared by the editors, followed by a detailed examination of Iberian Precambrian and Palaeozoic rocks in Spain, Variscan magmatism and tectonics, and the Mesozoic and Cenozoic sedimentary and fossil record. Subsequent chapters deal with the Alpine orogeny in the Pyrenees, Betics and other mountain ranges of Spain and the Balearic Islands, and with Cenozoic magmatism, including the classic hot spot-related volcanism of the Canary Islands. The final chapter focuses on <b>economic</b> and environmental <b>geology,</b> emphasising metallic deposits and industrial minerals, hydrocarbon energy resources, water supply, and modern seismic hazard. Finally a bibliography of around 4000 references provide a uniquely valuable information source. Encompassing subjects {{as diverse as the}} origin of Spanish granites, the palaeogeographic and tectonometamorphic history of the Iberian plate, human evolution in the SW Mediterranean, and modern volcanism and earthquake activity, The Geology of Spain is a key reference work suitable not only for libraries across the world, but of interest to all researchers, teachers and students of SW European geology.
