40|$|The {{extent to}} which {{interspecific}} niche differences structure plant communities is highly debated, with extreme viewpoints ranging from fine-scaled niche partitioning, where every species in the community is specialized to a distinct niche, to neutrality, where species have no niche or fitness differences. However, there exists a default position wherein niches of species in a community are determined by their evolutionary and biogeographic histories, irrespective of other species within the community. According to this viewpoint, {{a broad range of}} pair-wise niche overlaps-from completely overlapping to completely distinct-are expected in any community without the need to invoke interspecific interactions. We develop a method that can test for both habitat associations and niche differences along an arbitrary number of spatial and temporal niche dimensions and apply it to a 24 -yr data set of the eight dominant woody-plant species (representing 84 % and 76 % of total community abundance and basal area, respectively) from a 50 -ha permanent plot in a southern Indian tropical dry forest, using edaphic, topographic, and precipitation variables as niche axes. Species separated into two broad groups in niche space-one consisting of three canopy species and the other of a canopy species and four understory species-along axes that corresponded mainly to variation in soil P, Al and a topographic <b>index</b> <b>of</b> <b>wetness.</b> Species within groups tended to have significantly greater niche overlap than expected by chance. Community-wide niche overlap in spatial and temporal niche axes was never smaller than expected by chance. Species-habitat associations were neither necessary nor sufficient preconditions for niche differences to be present. Our results suggest that this tropical dry-forest community consists of several tree species with broadly overlapping niches, and where significant niche differences do exist, they are not readily interpretable as evidence for niche differentiation. We argue, based on a survey of the literature, that many of the observed niche differences in tropical forests are more parsimoniously viewed as autecological differences between species that exist independently of interspecific interactions...|$|E
40|$|Switchgrass (Panicum virgatum L.) is a {{perennial}} grass {{native to the}} United States that has been studied as a sustainable source of biomass fuel. Although many field-scale {{studies have examined the}} potential of this grass as a bioenergy crop, these studies have not been integrated. In this study, we present an empirical model for switchgrass yield and use this model to predict yield for the conterminous United States. We added environmental covariates to assembled yield data from field trials based on geographic location. We developed empirical models based on these data. The resulting empirical models, which account for spatial autocorrelation in the field data, provide the ability to estimate yield from factors associated with climate, soils, and management for both lowland and upland varieties of switchgrass. Yields of both ecotypes showed quadratic responses to temperature, increased with precipitation and minimum winter tempera-ture, and decreased with stand age.

Thirty-six plant communities were recognized with a total of 56 subcommunities. These communities fall into five different categories: I, the high-altitude fens and seepages are a loose grouping of distinct vegetation types from the summit plateau and just below; 2, hygrophilous grasslands are the marginal areas of the wetlands that are temporarily wet and dominated by grasses, most of which are common outside wetlands; 3, shrubby wetlands are in most cases hygrophilous grasslands that have been invaded by shrubby species due to disturbance; 4, mixed sedgelands are the largest grouping and are dominated by sedges or grass species that are specifically adapted to wet conditions; 5, low-altitude sedge and reedlands are vegetation types that occur only marginally in the Maloti-Drakensberg area and are dominated by Carex acutiformis and Phragmites australis.

40|$|International audienceHuman skin is innervated with {{a variety}} of receptors serving somatosensation and {{includes}} the sensory sub-modalities of touch, temperature, pain and itch. The density and type of receptors differ across the body surface, and there are various body-map representations in the brain. The perceptions of skin sensations outside of the specified sub-modalities, e. g. wetness or greasiness, are described as 'touch blends' and are learned. The perception <b>of</b> <b>wetness</b> is generated from the coincident activation of tactile and thermal receptors. The present study aims to quantify threshold levels <b>of</b> <b>wetness</b> perception and find out if this differs across body sites. A rotary tactile stimulator was used to apply a moving, wetted stimulus over selected body sites at a precise force and velocity. Four wetness levels were tested over eight body sites. After each stimulus, the participant rated how wet the stimulus was perceived to be using a visual analogue scale. The results indicated that participants discriminated between levels <b>of</b> <b>wetness</b> as distinct percepts. Significant differences were found between all levels <b>of</b> <b>wetness,</b> apart from the lowest levels of comparison (20 l and 40 l).

40|$|Phase change {{materials}} (PCMs) {{are increasingly}} incorporated in textiles {{in order to}} serve as a thermal buffer when humans change from a hot to a cold environment and the reverse. Due to the absence <b>of</b> <b>wetness</b> sensors in the skin, cooling of the skin may be perceived as a sensation <b>of</b> <b>wetness</b> instead <b>of</b> cold. In order to investigate if this phenomenon occurs when manipulating textiles, nine subjects were asked to touch or manipulate PCM-treated and untreated fabrics. In 75 % of the cases, the subjects indicated that the treated material felt wetter than the untreated material independent of the way the textiles were manipulated. We conclude that incorporating PCMs in textiles may lead to a feeling <b>of</b> <b>wetness</b> which might be uncomfortable. Therefore, we recommend investigating a change in cooling properties to minimise this feeling.

The ? 18 O values of modern alpha-cellulose tracked precipitation more closely than bog water, with a mean isotopic fractionation factor ?cellulose-precipitation of 1. 0274 ± 0. 001 (1 ?) (? 27 ‰). Sub-samples of isolated Sphagnum alpha-cellulose were subsequently analysed from core WLM 22, Walton Moss, northern England yielding a Sphagnum-specific isotope record spanning the last 4300 years. The palaeo-record, calibrated using the modern data, provides evidence for large amplitude variations in the estimated oxygen isotope composition of precipitation during the mid- to late Holocene. Estimates of palaeotemperature change derived from statistical relationships between modern surface air temperatures and ? 18 Oprecipitation values for the British Isles give unrealistically large variation in comparison to proxies from other archives.

This paper describes an experiment with six conditions regarding haptic discrimination <b>of</b> the <b>wetness</b> <b>of</b> fabrics. Three materials were used: cotton wool, sponge-structured viscose and thin viscose. Two ways of touching were investigated: static touching, in which only thermal cues were available, and dynamic touching, in which additional mechanical cues were available. For dynamic touching, average Weber fractions for discrimination were around 0. 3, whereas for static touching, they ranged from 0. 34 to 0. 63. The results show that people can make use of the additional mechanical cues to significantly improve their discrimination performance. There was no significant difference between Weber fractions for the three materials, showing that wetness can be judged as a separate perceptual quantity, independent of the material. © 2012 Elsevier B.

In this study, an innovative method is employed to evaluate the hazard for heritage stone substrates induced by the synergic effect of particulate matter (PM) and climate. In this respect, two hazard indicators for stone materials were determined: the time <b>of</b> <b>wetness</b> {{and the number of}} dissolution and crystallization cycles. The two indicators were computed by coupling experimental measurements of the PM deliquescence and crystallization relative humidity with climatic data. For the first time, these indicators were estimated based on the PM hygroscopic properties, considering its whole hysteresis loop and its consequent hydration level. The proposed method was applied to PM samples collected in the polluted Po Valley (Milan) : the experimental measurements of both PM deliquescence and crystallization relative humidity were performed in an environmental-controlled chamber using an electrical conductivity method. The time <b>of</b> <b>wetness</b> and the number of dissolution and crystallization cycles were then calculated by coupling the PM deliquescence and crystallization relative humidity with climatic data of Milan over the last decade (2003 – 2013).

40|$|Moisture is a well-documented, and crucial, {{control on}} the nature of stone decay. The term ‘time of wetness’ has {{frequently}} been adopted to describe how long a stone block is wet, with a view to understanding the impact of this on decay processes. Although this term has proved conceptually useful, it has been used in different ways, by different groups to mean very different things. For example, the time <b>of</b> <b>wetness</b> for a stone block surface (the traditional understanding) may be very different from that of a block interior, controlled by the different dynamics of wetting and drying in those zones. Thus, surface wetting will occur regularly (sometimes swiftly followed by drying, depending on the time of year), with block interior wetting requiring the accumulation of surface moisture to penetrate to depth (more likely in autumn and winter months), and drying out much more slowly. This relatively new but important perspective, framed in the context of climate change, is crucial to understanding the length of time stone may remain damp at depth following a period of prolonged precipitation. The nature and speed of drying is also relevant in quantifying time <b>of</b> <b>wetness</b> <b>of</b> both surfaces and the interior of building stones. These ideas related to time <b>of</b> <b>wetness</b> have implications for decay processes, specifically how a prolonged time <b>of</b> deep <b>wetness</b> may re-focus the emphasis of salt weathering in natural building stones toward chemical action. Literature on chemical change is discussed, suggesting that chemical change occurring during periods <b>of</b> prolonged <b>wetness</b> is likely to be significant in itself, with implications for weakening the stone (in terms of, for example, cement dissolution or grain boundary weakening) and exacerbating physical damage from salt crystallization when blocks finally dry out...|$|R

When soybean plants were grown at 15 °C, affected leaflet area, number of lesions per leaflet and diameter of lesions could only be measured after 60 hours <b>of</b> leaf <b>wetness.</b> At the temperatures of 20 and 25 °C this period was reduced to 24 hours <b>of</b> leaf <b>wetness,</b> at 30 oC, we found the need for 36 hours <b>of</b> leaf <b>wetness</b> and at a temperature of 35 °C, 48 hours. The optimal temperatures for disease development were 27 °C for diameter and affected leaflet area and 28 °C for number of lesions per leaflet with 72 hours <b>of</b> leaf <b>wetness.</b> </p...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{presents}} a finite element (FE) methodology for predicting {{the distribution of}} vapor pressure in a simple FR 4 -copper composite material when it is heated up to 215 °C. A general purpose finite element software was used to develop a two-dimensional plane strain model of the composite material. FE simulation of transient moisture absorption was performed to predict the distribution <b>of</b> <b>wetness</b> fraction in the material after pre-conditioning at an 85 °C/ 85 %RH environment for 15 days. FE simulation of transient moisture desorption was carried out at the peak solder reflow temperature of 215 °C to predict new distribution <b>of</b> <b>wetness</b> fraction in the material. The results of the moisture desorption analysis were used to compute the magnitude of vapor pressure in the material and its distribution at 215 °C. It {{was found that the}} moisture in the material redistributes itself during solder reflow. The moisture concentration in the area close to the FR 4 -copper interface below the longer copper trace increases during the solder reflow. The magnitude of the vapor pressure in 70 % of the FR 4 and near the FR 4 -copper interface below the lower copper trace is closed to the saturation pressure of water vapor at 215 °C. The distribution of the vapor pressure in the material is in similar fashion as the new distribution <b>of</b> <b>wetness</b> fraction after the moisture desorption analysis...|$|R
