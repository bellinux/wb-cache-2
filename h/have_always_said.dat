500|$|On 30 August 2013, Tasci {{moved to}} Russian Premier League side Spartak Moscow for an {{undisclosed}} fee. Upon leaving Stuttgart, he told the press, [...] "It {{was not an easy}} decision. The present decision is not a decision against VfB, but for the new task. I had an incredibly great time at VfB, have played in the youth here, then I turned pro and recently been the captain. I <b>have</b> <b>always</b> <b>said</b> that I am a VfBler and that I will remain." [...] Immediately after joining the club, his debut was delayed by the injuries he sustained while at Stuttgart and he did not play for three weeks. He made his first appearance with the club on 2 October 2013 when he appeared in training. After damaging his meniscus, Tasci announced he would return in January following an operation. He made his debut for the club on 17 March 2014 in a 2–2 draw against Anzhi Makhachkala. He made three more appearances that season.|$|E
500|$|In December 1987, as news {{began to}} {{circulate}} about the commissioned work, local Assyrians accused Parhad of misrepresenting Ashurbanipal. Criticisms included {{the depiction of}} the king holding both a book and a lion, which they argued he [...] "wouldn't do", and for dressing him in a skirt, which they claimed {{he would never have}} worn. The critics thought the statue made a better portrayal of the Sumerian king Gilgamesh. One critic said: It's very simple. The statue represents Gilgamesh.... No Assyrian has a right to imagine things about our king. It's exactly like making a copy of the Statue of Liberty and saying it is George Washington.... Assyrian kings didn't wear miniskirts. They wouldn't have been holding a lion or a book. It's an insult to the Assyrians. Narsai David responded: They are entitled to their opinion.... We have never said this is a museum-quality reproduction.... We <b>have</b> <b>always</b> <b>said</b> this is a characterization of Ashurbanipal as done by a 20th-century artist. If they choose to think of this as Gilgamesh, they are free to do so.|$|E
500|$|As {{late as the}} Siege of Charleston in 1780, Loyalists {{could still}} believe in their {{eventual}} victory, as British troops inflicted heavy defeats on the Continental forces at the Battle of Camden and the Battle of Guilford Court House. In late 1781, the news of Lord Cornwallis's surrender at the Siege of Yorktown reached London; Lord North's parliamentary support ebbed away and he resigned the following year. The King drafted an abdication notice, which was never delivered, finally accepted the defeat in North America, and authorised peace negotiations. The Treaties of Paris, by which Britain recognised {{the independence of the}} American states and returned Florida to Spain, were signed in 1782 and 1783. When John Adams was appointed American Minister to London in 1785, George had become resigned to the new relationship between his country and the former colonies. He told Adams, [...] "I was the last to consent to the separation; but the separation having been made and having become inevitable, I <b>have</b> <b>always</b> <b>said,</b> as I say now, that I {{would be the first to}} meet the friendship of the United States as an independent power." ...|$|E

He's brought us mainstream again for the first time in a lot of years." [...] Post-Belmont press analysis contended that California Chrome was the most popular Thoroughbred in America since Zenyatta. In December, when the horse was selected as the winner of the Secretariat Vox Populi Award, Coburn said, [...] "We <b>have</b> <b>always</b> <b>said</b> Chrome is the 'People's Horse' and we are thrilled that the public feels the same way we do about him."

6000|$|The {{event at}} the Rectory was {{expected}} every moment. The Rector, who practically never suffered, disliked the thought and sight of others' suffering.

2500|$|In Official PlayStation Magazine UKs {{interview}} about Uncharted 4, Richmond discusses {{some of the}} new directions that the franchise could take in the future, as well as maintaining fan interest and going too far. According to Richmond, Nate still has plenty more to give and the studio would continue to create new Uncharted experiences as long as fans want it. Speaking to VentureBeat, Richmond pointed out that the studio never set out to make a trilogy. Instead it has always [...] "sort have seen it as a stand-alone adventure", with each game existing as a self-sustaining gaming experience. [...] "We <b>have</b> <b>always</b> <b>said</b> that if we think that we can make something new and interesting, if the fans still want them, then we can make another one".|$|E

2500|$|The Orange Order had {{a central}} {{place in the}} new state of Northern Ireland. From 1921 to 1969, every Prime Minister of Northern Ireland was an Orangeman {{and member of the}} Ulster Unionist Party (UUP); all but three Cabinet Ministers were Orangemen; all but one unionist Senators were Orangemen; and 87 of the 95 MPs who did not become Cabinet Ministers were Orangemen. James Craig, the first Prime Minister of Northern Ireland, {{maintained}} always that Ulster was in effect Protestant and the symbol of its ruling forces was the Orange Order. In 1932, Prime Minister Craig maintained that [...] "ours is a Protestant government and I am an Orangeman". This was in response to a speech the year before by Eamonn de Valera in the Irish Free State claiming that Ireland was a [...] "Catholic nation" [...] in a debate about protests against Protestant woman Letitia Dunbar-Harrison being appointed as County Librarian in County Mayo. Two years later he stated: [...] "I <b>have</b> <b>always</b> <b>said</b> that I am an Orangeman first and a politician and a member of this parliament afterwards...

2500|$|Following {{this fight}} at the [...] "Red Idol Gorge", as the British later called it, the British {{military}} pressed on to Gyantse, reaching it on 11 April. The town's gates were opened before Macdonald's forces, the garrison having already departed. Francis Younghusband {{wrote to his}} father; [...] "As I <b>have</b> <b>always</b> <b>said,</b> the Tibetans are nothing but sheep." [...] The townspeople continued with their business and the Westerners {{took a look at}} the monastic complex, the Palkor Chode. The central feature was the Temple of One Hundred Thousand Deities, a nine-storey stupa, modelled on the Mahabodhi Temple at Bodhgaya, the spot where Gautama Buddha first achieved enlightenment. Statuettes and scrolls were shared out between officers. Younghusband's Mission Staff and Escort were billeted in the country mansion and farmyard of a Tibetan noble family named Changlo, and 'Changlo Manor' became the Mission Headquarters where Younghusband could hold his durbars and meet representatives of the Dalai Lama. In the words of historian Charles Allen, they now entered 'a halcyon period', even planting a vegetable garden at the Manor while officers explored the town unescorted, or went fishing and shooting. The Commission's medical officer, the philanthropic Captain Herbert Walton, attended {{to the needs of the}} local populace, notably performing operations to correct cleft palates, a particularly common affliction in Tibet. Five days after he arrived at Gyantse, and deeming the defences of Changlo Manor secure, Macdonald ordered the main force to begin the march back to New Chumbi to protect the supply line.|$|E

[...] At the end of 2010, Kat and Ronnie both give birth on the same day, but Ronnie's baby, James, dies and while Kat is in hospital and her baby, Tommy, is unattended, Ronnie swaps the infants. The storyline received over 6,000 complaints, making it the second most complained about EastEnders storyline. It was then decided to end the storyline earlier than originally planned. It was reported by the Daily Star Sunday that Ronnie experiences a change of heart after visiting relatives in hospital and seeing the midwife who delivered her son. An EastEnders spokesperson said, [...] "We do not comment on future storylines but we <b>have</b> <b>always</b> <b>said</b> Ronnie will {{do the right thing and}} Tommy will be reunited with Kat." [...] Wallace revealed that she doesn't regret her involvement of the baby-swap storyline, saying that she was [...] "just doing her job". Wallace told Bang Showbiz:"I stand by it. We're actors at the end of the day, we do our job and then we go home. It's drama, that's it." [...] She also praised Womack's acting and vowed to move on to [...] "bigger and better things" [...] after she departed.
