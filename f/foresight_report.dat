30|$|In this contribution, we {{investigate}} how results produced in a large-scale participatory agenda setting process differ from results of expert-based foresight studies {{with a similar}} aim of informing EU research and innovation (R&I) policy. After providing a theoretical positioning and {{an overview of the}} EU-wide participatory agenda setting process CIMULACT—Citizen and Multi-Actor Consultation on Horizon 2020, we describe our developed analytical approach that includes five analytical steps and calculation of three metrics. By comparative reading, analysis and scoring of 16 expert-based <b>foresight</b> <b>reports,</b> we produced data for the metrics that allow for discerning between (a) how many of the analyzed <b>foresight</b> <b>reports</b> cover a respective topic from CIMULACT, (b) how well this basic coverage aligns qualitatively, and (c) comprehensive comparison of each CIMULACT topic with respect to all surveyed reports. To discern differences, we chose those results (research topics) from CIMULACT that were also sufficiently covered by expert-based reports. Our findings suggest that such citizen-based, multi-actor co-created policy advice qualitatively differs considerably from that elicited by expert-based reports, in terms of direction and focus of the proposed R&I agenda.|$|R
30|$|For {{selecting}} expert-based <b>foresight</b> <b>reports</b> for comparison, {{two primary}} selection criteria dominated the process, purpose, {{and scope of}} the respective report, with secondary criteria creating an additional filter. With regard to purpose, we selected studies that had a similar aim as CIMULACT: informing the development of research and innovation agendas and here mainly Horizon 2020, sourcing from databases, such as [59], The Publications Office of the European Union [URL] and the European Commission Joint Research Centre Publication Repository. [URL] In order to enable a proper comparison with regard to the to the highly integrated fields of research CIMULACT addressed, we selected <b>foresight</b> <b>reports</b> with most similar scope, i.e., broad ranging in terms of included research fields, geographical area, and socio-political analysis. We therefore excluded, for instance, <b>foresight</b> <b>reports</b> focusing on a specific sector or field of inquiry, or national in scope, even though they contained very detailed foresight knowledge. Categories were identified in other foresight mapping analysis [60], such as commissioning organizations, authoring organizations, publication date, time horizon, methodological approach, and the intended audience served as secondary selection criteria. The 16 reports finally selected can be found in Additional file  1 : Table S 1. As basis for comparison, we chose the 46 CIMULACT topics resulting from the last step of the participatory process, which include the final 23 topics, but also the larger set of topics that were not selected by EC officials during the project’s final conference. In order to prepare the CIMULACT topics for comparative reading, we identified and highlighted key words and critical concepts within the topics as comparative lenses. For more detailed information with regard to selection of reports and identification of key concepts, consult [61].|$|R
30|$|The {{explicitly}} detailed {{goals that}} citizens proposed for future food research demarcate CIMULACT research topics from expert <b>foresight</b> <b>reports.</b> While {{it must be}} acknowledged that over two-thirds of the expert report mentioned food as a research area, this only compounds the qualitative differences between these reports and citizen recommendations. According to our analysis, citizen recommendations were far more focused on the specific goals that research should be pointed towards—a combination of ends, {{as opposed to a}} singular field.|$|R
50|$|In {{the last}} 10 years, {{there has been}} an {{explosion}} of interest in the role of emotional abilities and characteristics in contributing to success in all aspects of life. The concept of Emotional Intelligence (EI) has gained wide recognition and is featured in the <b>Foresight</b> <b>report</b> on Mental Capital and Wellbeing. Some have made influential claims that EI is more important than conventional cognitive intelligence, and that it can more easily be enhanced. Systematic research has yet to provide much support for these claims, although EI {{has been found to be}} associated with academic success and there is some evidence that it may be of particular importance for groups at-risk of academic failure and social exclusion. In spite of the weak evidence base, there has been a focus on promoting the social and emotional competence, mental health and psychological wellbeing of children and young people, particularly in schools as the result of the investment in universal services, prevention and early intervention (e.g., the Social and Emotional Aspects of Learning (SEAL) project in the UK 2005, 2007).|$|E
5000|$|Mathematical {{skills are}} {{important}} {{not only for the}} national economy but also for an individual’s life chances: low numeracy increases the probability of arrest, depression, physical illnesses, unemployment. One of the main causes of low numeracy is a congenital condition called dyscalculia. As the <b>Foresight</b> <b>report</b> on Mental Capital and Wellbeing puts it, [...] "Developmental dyscalculia - because of its low profile but high impacts, its priority should be raised. Dyscalculia relates to numeracy and affects between 4-7% of children. It has a much lower profile than dyslexia but can also have substantial impacts: it can reduce lifetime earnings by £114,000 and reduce the probability of achieving five or more GCSEs (A*-C) by 7-20 percentage points. Home and school interventions have again been identified by the Project. Also, technological interventions are extremely promising, offering individualised instruction and help, although these need more development." [...] (Executive Summary, Section 5.3) Understanding typical and atypical mathematical development is a crucial underpinning for the design of both the mainstream mathematics curriculum and for helping those who fail to keep up. Over the past ten years, a brain system for simple number processing has been identified and a handful of studies of children’s brains that throw a little light on its development.|$|E

Gould {{was awarded the}} MBE for this work in the 1997 New Year's Honours list, at age 26.Gould was in Manila when Robin Cook visited as Foreign Secretary. Gould wrote a speech for Cook, and was immediately appointed by him as his speechwriter, which he did from 1997 to 1999. During this period, Gould coordinated and led {{a group of young}} FCO officials keen to reform the FCO. Initially known as the Young Turks, the project led to the <b>Foresight</b> <b>Report</b> - a major internal review of how the FCO worked. The report was widely credited with helping the FCO to modernise itself and develop new and more open working practices.Gould served as Deputy Head of the FCO's Consular Division from 1999 to 2001. In this time, he worked with Baroness Scotland, then Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State, to create a more effective and active approach to the practice of forced marriage. Gould established a new unit in the FCO tasked with combatting forced marriage and helping its victims.From 2002 to 2003, he was Political Counsellor in Islamabad. From 2003 to 2005, Gould was Deputy Head of Mission in Tehran, and Chargé d'Affaires (acting Ambassador) for six months of this time. In June 2004, the Iranian Revolutionary Guard arrested six Royal marines and two Royal Navy sailors on the Shaatt al Arab waterway, and held them for three days.

30|$|The unique citizen {{contribution}} to this discussion, and also the core reason for a CrossComp score below 50 %, was the demand for “data literacy...co-production of data, data access (open), and ethical data use...” These concepts were not widely shared with expert <b>foresight</b> <b>reports,</b> and serve to differentiate the citizen view of whom data should be used by, and the purpose big-data analysis should serve.

40|$|An upsurge of {{interest}} in Foresight has been triggered in Germany by the coutry's re-unification and the resulting {{question of how to}} integrate two very different national research systems. Other contributing factors have been the economic recession and the desire to convert military technology following the end of the Cold War. In Germany, there has been no national Foresight programme but rather a number of loosely related activities at variour levels of government trying out different methodological approaches. Among these, the Delphi Foresight approach seems to have been the most influencial. This approach is modelled on the Japanese experience of the past 24 years and has been modified and extended for application in Germany. A Comparison of responses by Japanese and German experts shows quite close agreement on the time-scale over which 1, 150 prospective technologies are likely to be realised. However, there were {{significant differences between the two}} countries as regards the re lative importance given to individual technologies and the expected constraints on their realisations. Since both these aspects are linked to the national research system, such intercountry differences are not unexpected. There have been several follow-up studies which demonstrate how the results from these Foresight exercises have been utilised in different sectors of industry, in scientific organisation, in government bodies and by the public. At the level of state governments, there have been investigations of the regional iplications of the Foresight results. In industry, the participation by companies in the Foresight exercises undoubtedly led to a general improvement in their knowledge of furture technologiesx and socio-economic trends.
