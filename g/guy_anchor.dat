40|$|A {{parametric}} {{study of}} a guyed tower is presented. A computer program is developed to analyze, design, and estimate the mass and {{the total cost of}} a guyed tower. Matrix stiffness method is used for the static analysis of the mast. The non-linearity due to axial loads is accounted for by using the geometric stiffness matrix. The cable analysis including the change in sag of a guy cable due to change in tension is presented. An iterative procedure is adopted to satisfy compatibility conditions of guy attachment points. Four loading conditions are considered in the design. Structural steel angles are considered for the design of members of the mast. Guy strands and bridge strands are considered for the guy cables and deadman anchorages are adopted for guy anchorages. Variation in the mass and the total cost of a guyed tower due to the variation in (a) inclination of diagonal web members, (b) radial distance of <b>guy</b> <b>anchor</b> points, (c) height of guy connection points, and (d) size of the mast, are studied. An attempt is made to find an optimum design of a guyed tower. Dept. of Civil and Environmental Engineering.

40|$|ABSTRACT: <b>Guyed</b> <b>anchor</b> is an {{important}} component of transmission line tower, and its stability directly affects the safety of the whole line. Under the condition of meeting the uplift tensile forces, the optimization design and analysis of the <b>guyed</b> <b>anchor</b> is studied through the optimization program using the method of network searching. The influence of the soil properties, the <b>guyed</b> <b>anchor</b> structure, the uplift tensile forces and directions on the optimized embedded depth of the <b>guyed</b> <b>anchor</b> is discussed in detail. These results will provide some theoretical evidences and technical supports for the <b>guyed</b> <b>anchor</b> manufacture and the selection of the embedded depth...|$|R

50|$|In the {{neighbourhood}} of the masts, in the 1970s a 110-metre-tall mast radiator was built. Today, the basements of the masts and the <b>guy</b> <b>anchors</b> remain there.|$|R
50|$|Much {{more rarely}} and {{interesting}} under constructive details are partially guyed towers at {{which at least}} one basement of the <b>guy</b> <b>anchors</b> is on the ground. At such structures, the guyed mast on the top is in opposite to <b>guyed</b> towers with <b>anchor</b> basements {{on the top of}} free-standing tower much taller (in most cases taller than the basement tower) and it must be considered at its construction and maintenance, that the basement of the guyed mast is situated much more elevated than that of the anchor basements.|$|R
50|$|This type {{consists}} of a rod with wide screw blades on the end and an eyelet on the other for the guy wire.It is screwed deep into the ground, at the same angle as the guy, by a truck-mounted drill machine. These are commonly used as <b>guy</b> <b>anchors</b> for utility poles since they are quick to install with a truck mounted hydraulic powered auger drive.|$|R
50|$|The tower {{consists}} of two parts: a lattice tower of 1950 ft; topped by a transmitting array of 113 ft. The total height of both is 2,063 ft (628.8 m). The antenna weighs 9,000 pounds (4.3 tons; 4,300 kg), the lattice tower weighs 855,500 pounds (388 tons; 388,000 kg), giving a total weight of 864,500 pounds (392 tons; 392,100 kg). It takes up 160 acre of land with its <b>guy</b> <b>anchors.</b> Its height {{above mean sea level}} is 3038 ft.|$|R

40|$|A {{conceptual}} {{structural design}} of a horizontal cylindrical lunar habitat is presented. The design includes the interior floor framing, the exterior support structure, the foundation mat, and the radiation shielding. Particular attention was given on its efficiency in shipping and field erection, and on selection of structural materials. Presented also is a conceptual {{design of a}} 2000 -foot lunar guyed tower. A special field erection scheme is implemented in the design. In order to analyze the over-all column buckling of the mast, where its axial compression includes its own body weight, a simple numerical procedure is formulated in a form ready for coding in FORTRAN. Selection of structural materials, effect of temperature variations, dynamic response of the tower to moonquake, and <b>guy</b> <b>anchoring</b> system are discussed. Proposed field erection concepts for the habitat and for the guyed tower are described...|$|R

40|$|AbstractSoil <b>anchors</b> {{with their}} <b>guy</b> lines are {{employed}} {{in a wide variety}} of applications. Anchor support for utility poles is the focus of the present study. A nonintrusive measuring system is proposed to monitor the integrity of such <b>guy</b> line ground <b>anchors.</b> The natural longitudinal frequency of the partially buried anchor rod with a terminal buried plate attached can be measured periodically with an accelerometer. An increase in this frequency over time would indicate a possible corrosion-induced loosening of the ground anchor from its buried terminal plate, and the need for anchor replacement. A case study involving an aging and failed utility pole anchor illustrates the need for such frequency monitoring...|$|R

50|$|The Tower of Unity (German: Turm der Einheit) is a 30 meter high {{observation}} tower on Heldrastein, a rocky mountain belonging to Treffurt in Thuringia. The tower of Unity has an unusual history {{and is also}} from unusual design, because it is additionally <b>guyed</b> by <b>anchoring</b> wires, although it is actually free standing. The tower of Unity was built in 1962 as transmitting tower for a radar station. At {{that time it was}} an open steel lattice tower additionally guyed with the radar facility on its top. The area of this tower was not accessible for tourists at those days as it laid in the restricted area of the former border between West and East Germany. In 1989, when the border was opened, the area became again accessible for the public and the desire developed to build on Heldrastein again an {{observation tower}}, as there was until 1952 an observation tower built of stones, the such called Carl Alexander tower there. In 1996 finally permission for the transformation of the radar tower into an observation tower could be received. In order to do this changes, which cost 205,000 DM, the radome on the top was removed and the tower body was covered with wood. In addition the tower got a stairway with 166 steps and an octagonal shelter at the tower basement.|$|R
40|$|Advertisements, {{which can}} be found in daily life, do not just {{function}} as the source of the product’s information, but can also create a new connotation about social reality. This research is intended to reveal the form of the connotation about present beauty of Indonesian women that are trying to be conveyed by the advertisers through present advertisements in Kartini magazines.   This research is also revealing elements that are used by the advertisers to attract readers’ attention. To see what are the new connotation that are formed in the present advertisements, they will be compared with advertisements in the older generation. This research is using qualitative descriptive method and the data is coming from the wordings that are printed in those advertisements. The data will be described and analyzed with Discourse of Advertising Theory by <b>Guy</b> Cook and <b>Anchoring</b> Connotation Theory by Roland Barthes, and then the result will be conclude. Through Guy’s theory, this research will reveal all the elements that are used by the producers to build the beauty concept. Through Barthes’ theory, this research will show how the advertisers create new connotation. The result of analysis shows that present beauty concept about ideal body is a beautiful body that are radiated from the outer side of the women’s body and good looking. Beautiful face is a face that looks as young as twenty years old girls. Moreover, the result also shows that producers use current social representative where consumers these days like new, instant products that give maximum result. The result also shows consumers’ doubt over unknown products and women’s fear on fat body and aging. </p...|$|R
