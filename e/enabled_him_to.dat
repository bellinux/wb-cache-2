5|$|Experimentation by Faraday in 1831 {{revealed}} that a wire moving perpendicular to a magnetic field developed a potential difference between its ends. Further analysis of this process, known as electromagnetic induction, <b>enabled</b> <b>him</b> <b>to</b> state the principle, now known as Faraday's law of induction, that the potential difference induced in a closed circuit {{is proportional to the}} rate of change of magnetic flux through the loop. Exploitation of this discovery <b>enabled</b> <b>him</b> <b>to</b> invent the first electrical generator in 1831, in which he converted the mechanical energy of a rotating copper disc to electrical energy. Faraday's disc was inefficient and of no use as a practical generator, but it showed the possibility of generating electric power using magnetism, a possibility that would be taken up by those that followed on from his work.|$|E
5|$|From 1876 to 1888, Gilkeson {{served as}} a member and {{secretary}} of the fourth, fifth, and sixth Board of Regents of the West Virginia Schools for the Deaf and Blind, a position that <b>enabled</b> <b>him</b> <b>to</b> {{become familiar with the}} school's efforts to educate its deaf and blind students.|$|E
5|$|Schumacher's extra pace as {{a result}} of his lighter fuel loads meant he was able to pull out enough of a gap to Häkkinen which <b>enabled</b> <b>him</b> <b>to</b> make an extra pit stop. Häkkinen's pace was very slow, {{allowing}} Nicola Larini to leapfrog him when the two-stoppers made their final pit stops.|$|E

5|$|After short tours at Marine Corps Recruit Depot Parris Island and Marine Corps Headquarters in Washington, D.C., he was {{enrolled}} in the Senior Officers' Course at the Marine Corps Schools, Quantico, Virginia in 1936. He was promoted to major on February 9, 1936. Foreign duty as operations officer with the 4th Marines in Shanghai, China from 1937 to 1939, <b>enabled</b> <b>him</b> <b>to</b> observe closely Japanese military operations.|$|E
5|$|Although he {{was known}} for his {{composure}} and ability to score several goals for his team as a forward, Bergkamp was also capable of playing behind a lone striker, where he essentially functioned in the number 10 role as a playmaking attacking midfielder or deep-lying forward, due to his ball skills and creative ability, which <b>enabled</b> <b>him</b> <b>to</b> drop deep between the lines and link-up play. A quick, elegant, intelligent, and technically gifted player, his excellent first touch, quick feet, dribbling ability, and change of pace <b>enabled</b> <b>him</b> <b>to</b> beat defenders in one on one situations, while his attacking movement, physique, balance, and close control allowed him to hold up the ball and create space for teammates; his vision and passing range with both feet, despite being naturally right-footed, subsequently allowed him to provide assists for on-running strikers. Bergkamp often stated he preferred playing in this deeper role, as he derived more pleasure from assisting goals, rather than scoring them himself.|$|E
5|$|Berger {{was born}} in Prague, Czechoslovakia. His uncle is the Czech footballer Jan Berger. He married wife Jaroslava, and has two children, son Patrik and {{daughter}} Valentýnka. He gained a British passport in 2001 after having spent five years playing club football in England. This <b>enabled</b> <b>him</b> <b>to</b> play without needing a work permit, which he had previously required due to the Premier League's rules on non-EU players.|$|E

5|$|Braille's ear {{for music}} <b>enabled</b> <b>him</b> <b>to</b> become an {{accomplished}} cellist and organist in classes taught by Jean-Nicolas Marrigues. Later in life, his musical talents {{led him to}} play the organ for churches all over France. A devout Catholic, Braille held the position of organist in Paris at the Church of Saint-Nicolas-des-Champs from 1834 to 1839, and later at the Church of Saint-Vincent-de-Paul.|$|E
5|$|In {{addition}} to his colonization policies, Stephen restored Crown lands that had been lost {{during the civil war}} that followed Alexander the Good's rule, either through buying or confiscating them. On the other hand, he granted much landed property to the Church and to the lesser noblemen who were the main supporters of the central government. His itinerant lifestyle <b>enabled</b> <b>him</b> <b>to</b> personally hold court in the whole of Moldavia, which contributed to the development of his authority.|$|E
5|$|Supplied by Americans, Zaireans and the French, Habré rapidly reorganized {{his forces}} (now called Chadian National Armed Forces, or FANT). FANT marched north {{to confront the}} GUNT and the Libyans, who he met south of Abéché. Habré crushed Goukouni's forces and started a vast counteroffensive that <b>enabled</b> <b>him</b> <b>to</b> retake in rapid {{succession}} Abéché, Biltine, Fada and, on 30 July, Faya-Largeau, threatening to attack the Tibesti and the Aouzou Strip.|$|E

5|$|A {{longtime}} {{fan of the}} English trip hop group Portishead, West {{had been}} significantly influenced by Roseland NYC Live, the band's 1998 live album with the New York Philharmonic Orchestra. Early in his career, the live album had inspired him to incorporate string arrangements into his hip hop production. Though West {{had not been able}} to afford many live instruments around the time of his debut album, the money from his commercial success <b>enabled</b> <b>him</b> <b>to</b> hire a string orchestra for his second album. West juxtaposed the lush, intricate melodies of the string section with the hard, pounding drum rhythms of hip-hop, and used the sound for the foundation of his rapping.|$|E
5|$|A {{measure of}} William's success in taking control is that, from 1072 until the Capetian conquest of Normandy in 1204, William and his successors were largely {{absentee}} rulers. For example, after 1072, William {{spent more than}} 75 per cent {{of his time in}} France rather than England. While he needed to be personally present in Normandy to defend the realm from foreign invasion and put down internal revolts, he set up royal administrative structures that <b>enabled</b> <b>him</b> <b>to</b> rule England from a distance.|$|E
5|$|A {{tall and}} thin off spinner, Trumble {{delivered}} the ball at a quicker pace than most spin bowlers, using his height and uncommonly long fingers to his greatest advantage. He was at his best on the softer pitches of England, but his accuracy and variations in pace <b>enabled</b> <b>him</b> <b>to</b> take wickets on the harder pitches of Australia. He was a dependable lower order batsman and a fine fielder in the slips. He was recognised as a shrewd thinker about the game and was popular with team-mates and opponents, {{with a penchant for}} practical jokes.|$|E

5|$|After {{the release}} of the Pocket PC version, in 2006 Chahi created a new Windows version {{targeted}} at Windows XP. Emmanuel Rivoire increased the resolution to 1280×800 pixels and Chahi created more detailed backgrounds. He found that his original choice to use polygons for the game characters <b>enabled</b> <b>him</b> <b>to</b> use the original character art at a higher resolution. The game still supports the original 320×200 resolution, as well as the original background art (as an option), and it features twice as many checkpoints as the original, which makes it somewhat easier, as well as newly remixed sounds.|$|E
5|$|Also in 1140, Theobald consecrated Uhtred as Bishop of Llandaff, with Uhtred also {{swearing}} to obey Theobald. Likewise, when Theobald consecrated Gilbert as Bishop of St Asaph in 1142, {{a similar}} profession of obedience was made. Along with these consecrations, Theobald's legal efforts <b>enabled</b> <b>him</b> <b>to</b> withstand the attempts of Bernard to turn St David's into an archbishopric, and when Bernard was succeeded by David fitzGerald in 1148, Theobald secured the new bishop's profession of obedience to Canterbury, thus ending {{the efforts to}} remove Wales from Canterbury's jurisdiction. Also in 1148, Pope Eugene decided in favour of Canterbury and against the claims of St David's, securing Canterbury's jurisdiction over Wales.|$|E
5|$|Another Gwenllian (circa 1178 – 1236) married Ednyfed Fychan, seneschal of Gwynedd under Llywelyn the Great, {{and through}} her, Rhys became an {{ancestor}} of the Tudor dynasty. Through the Tudors inter-marrying with the House of Stuart Rhys is an ancestor {{to the current}} ruling house of the United Kingdom and also an ancestor of several ruling houses in Europe. When Henry Tudor landed in Pembrokeshire, Wales in 1485 {{to make a bid}} for the throne, his descent from Rhys was one of the factors which <b>enabled</b> <b>him</b> <b>to</b> attract Welsh support (Henry flew a (Welsh) dragon banner at the battle of Bosworth Field).|$|E

5|$|Aspiring {{musician}} and scenester Bob Markley managed {{to join the}} group the Laughing Wind {{in exchange for his}} connections in the music industry and substantial bankroll. The original five-piece line-up consisted of Michael Lloyd (rhythm guitar, vocals), Shaun Harris (bass guitar, vocals, Danny Harris (lead guitar, vocals), John Ware (drums), and Markley (tambourine, vocals). Although Markley possessed the least musical talent, his expertise in law <b>enabled</b> <b>him</b> <b>to</b> assume control of the group's name and publishing, which generated a divide in the WCPAEB's creative mindset.|$|E
5|$|Barnes {{gripped the}} bat very {{low on the}} handle and bent over so far in his stance that the {{knuckles}} {{of his right hand}} were level with his knees. He stood with his heels almost together and the toes of his left foot pointing toward extra cover, which left him open-chested when facing the bowler. A noticeable flourish in his backlift <b>enabled</b> <b>him</b> <b>to</b> follow the swinging delivery and play it late if necessary. His first movement was back and across the crease to cover the stumps from the view of the bowler, putting him in position to play the hook, leg glance, sweep and his favourite square cut shot.|$|E
5|$|Bose {{commented that}} Ganguly's {{greatest}} legacy {{lay in his}} influence on the younger and budding generation of cricketers. Ganguly felt that every young player should play two years of domestic cricket before being selected for international assignments. He also said that every newcomer should be given at least five games to prove himself. Later he explained that being at {{the receiving end of}} an unfair decision against him, that threatened to ruin his international cricket career, it <b>enabled</b> <b>him</b> <b>to</b> understand the insecurities of other newcomers in the team better than his predecessors. Ganguly had always backed the influence and contribution of younger players of the team.|$|E
