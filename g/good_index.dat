40|$|ABSTRACT: Several theorists {{of justice}} have called {{attention}} to a vitiating contradiction besetting John Rawls’s treatment of “primary goods ” and their relation to “lifeplan”-satisfaction among persons. Rawls effectively claims, these critics observe, that 1) primary <b>goods</b> <b>indices</b> are interpersonally ordinally equivalent; 2) primary <b>goods</b> <b>indices</b> and degrees or levels of lifeplan-satisfaction are intrapersonally ordinally equivalent; and 3) degrees or levels of lifeplan-satisfaction are not interpersonally ordinally equivalent. These three claims are jointly inconsistent. John Roemer, in particular, shows them so via an elementary function-theoretic proof by reductio ad absurdum. A natural objection that a Rawlsian {{might be tempted to}} offer to Roemer and other critics is that a standard mathematical (or any other) proof by reductio in the present context is illicit. For such proofs proceed implicitly on the basis of semantic bivalence and the Law of Excluded Middle. And a claim of interpersonal incomparability, such as (3), implicitly rejects {{at least one of these}} classical logical “laws ” via its treatment of certain prospective comparisons as simply undefined, hence, semantically empty. It is therefore a matter of some interest that a somewhat “softened...|$|R

50|$|There is {{extensive}} {{recent research}} using mental chronometry {{for the study}} of cognitive development. Specifically, various measures of speed of processing were used to examine changes in the speed of information processing as a function of age. Kail (1991) showed that speed of processing increases exponentially from early childhood to early adulthood. Studies of reaction times in young children of various ages are consistent with common observations of children engaged in activities not typically associated with chronometry. This includes speed of counting, reaching for things, repeating words, and other developing vocal and motor skills that develop quickly in growing children. Once reaching early maturity, there is then a long period of stability until speed of processing begins declining from middle age to senility (Salthouse, 2000). In fact, cognitive slowing is considered a <b>good</b> <b>index</b> of broader changes in the functioning of the brain and intelligence. Demetriou and colleagues, using various methods of measuring speed of processing, showed that it is closely associated with changes in working memory and thought (Demetriou, Mouyi, & Spanoudis, 2009). These relations are extensively discussed in the neo-Piagetian theories of cognitive development.|$|E
5000|$|In 2002 the Turkish state indicted a Turkish publisher, Fatih Tas, for distributing a {{collection}} of Chomsky's essays under the title ‘American Intervention.’ The state charged that the book [...] "promoted separatism" [...] violating Article 8 of the Turkish Anti-Terror Law. One essay in the book was a reprint of a speech that Chomsky had made in Toledo, Ohio containing material claiming that the Turkish state had brutally repressed its Kurdish population. Prosecutors cited the following passages as particularly offensive: In 1984, the Turkish government launched a major war in the Southeast against the Kurdish population. And that continued. In fact it's still continuing. [...] If we look at US military aid to Turkey-which is usually a pretty <b>good</b> <b>index</b> of policy-Turkey was of course a strategic ally so it always had a fairly high level of military aid. But the aid shot up in 1984, {{at the time that}} the counterinsurgency war began. This had nothing to do with Cold War, transparently. It was because of the counterinsurgency war. The aid remained high, peaking through the 1990s as the atrocities increased. The peak year was 1997. In fact in the single year 1997, US military aid to Turkey was greater than in the entire period of 1950 to 1983 when there were allegedly Cold War issues. The end result was pretty awesome: tens of thousands of people killed, two to three million refugees, massive ethnic cleansing with some 3500 villages destroyed-about seven times Kosovo under NATO bombing, and there's nobody bombing in this case, except for the Turkish air forces using planes that Clinton sent to them with the certain knowledge that that's how they would be used.|$|E
5000|$|Technical evaluationTo define quantitatively where {{technique}} fails or excels {{has very}} practical uses for coaches, in particular, {{and also for}} sports scientists aiming to analyse performance {{at different levels of}} development of athletes. [...] Winners and errors are powerful indicators of technical competence in racket sports and have often been used in research in notational analysis of net-wall games. It has been found that, for all standards of play in squash, if the winner: error ratio for a particular player in a match was greater than one, then that player usually won. (This was achieved with English scoring and a 19-inch tin). Although this ratio is a <b>good</b> <b>index</b> of technique, it would be better used with data for both players, and the ratios should not be simplified nor decimalised. Rally end distributions, winners and errors in the different position cells across the court, have often been used to define technical strengths and weaknesses. This use of these distributions as indicators is valid as long as the overall distribution of shots across the court is evenly balanced. This even distribution of shots rarely occurs in any net or wall game. Dispersions of winners and errors should be normalised with respect to the totals of shots from those cells. It would be more accurate to represent the winner, or error, frequency, from particular position cells, as a ratio to the total number of shots from those cells. Similarly, performance indicators such as shots are insufficient and need to be expressed with more detail, for example shot to goal ratios (soccer). Even these, powerful as they are, need to be viewed with caution and perhaps integrated with some measure of shooting opportunities? In rugby union, simple numbers of rucks and mauls won by teams may not give a clear impression of the match, the ratio of 'rucks won' to 'rucks initiated' is a more powerful measure of performance. This too could be improved by some measure of how quickly the ball was won in critical areas of the pitch? Many coaches seek the template of tactical play at the highest level for preparation and training of both elite players and/or teams, and also for those developing players who aspire to reach the highest position. Particular databases, aimed at specific individuals or teams, {{can also be used to}} prepare in anticipation of potential opponents for match play. This modelling of technical attainment has been replicated in many sports and form the basis of preparation at the highest levels by the sports science support teams.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. In [15] Manfred Holler {{introduced}} the Public <b>Good</b> <b>index</b> as {{a proposal to}} divide a public good among players. In its unnormalized version, i. e., the raw measure, it counts {{the number of times}} that a player belongs to a minimal winning coalition. Unlike the Banzhaf index, it does not count the remaining winning coalitions in which the player is crucial. Holler noticed that his index does not satisfy local monotonicity, a fact that can be seen either as a major drawback [9, 221 ff. ] or as an advantage [16]. In this paper we consider a convex combination of the two indices and require the validity of local monotonicity. We prove that the cost of obtaining it is high, i. e., the achievable new indices satisfying local monotonicity are closer to the Banzhaf index than to the Public <b>Good</b> <b>index.</b> All these achievable new indices are more solidary than the Banzhaf index, which makes them as very suitable candidates to divide a public good. As a generalization we consider convex combinations of either: the Shift index, the Public <b>Good</b> <b>index,</b> and the Banzhaf index, or alternatively: the Shift Deegan-Packel, Deegan-Packel, and Johnston indices...|$|E
