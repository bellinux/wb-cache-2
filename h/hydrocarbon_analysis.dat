No two crude oil types are identical and there are crucial differences in crude oil quality. The results of crude oil assay testing provide extensive detailed <b>hydrocarbon</b> <b>analysis</b> data for refiners, oil traders and producers.

Some of the petroleum geochemical techniques used are: stable isotopes; <b>hydrocarbon</b> <b>analysis</b> (fingerprinting) of specific organic compounds (biological organic markers) with gas chromatography (GC) and gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS); maturity indicators like vitrinite reflectance; laboratory pyrolysis and analysis; kerogen typing; and other more exotic techniques.|$|E

An integrated analytical framework based on spectroscopic techniques integration and data fusion for the rapid measurement and detection of on-site petroleum hydrocarbons is proposed.

5000|$|Regarding {{the set of}} columns, can be {{combined}} in various types. The Original column sets in the beginning were mainly poly(dimethylsiloxane) in the first dimension and poly(ethyleneglycol) in the second dimension. These so-called straight phase column sets are very suitable for <b>Hydrocarbon</b> <b>analysis.</b> Therefore, these are still used most frequent in Oil and Gas industry. If the application is to determine more polar compounds in a non-polar matrix. The reverse phase column set gives more resolution for the polar compounds. The first dimension column in this situation is a polar column, followed by a mid-polar second dimension column.For each application there can be an optimal column set. In this respective you can use also chiral columns for optical isomer separation or for example PLOT columns for volatiles and gas samples.To optimize the application {{is a bit more}} complex compared to 1D separations, as there are more parameters involved. Flow and oven temperature program are still very important but also hot jet pulse duration, length of the second dimension column and modulation time have a big influence on the final results. The outcome is also different. No longer a traditional chromatogram is produced, but now a 3 dimensional plot is produced by specially designed software [...] packages. It is a different way of evaluate data, but you get much more information. With modern software, you can perform group-type separation as well as automated peak identification (with Mass Spectrometry).|$|E
5000|$|In the [...] "experimental" [...] methods, one {{actually}} cools a surface on which gas condenses and then measures the temperature {{at which the}} condensation takes place. The experimental methods {{can be divided into}} manual and automated systems. Manual systems, such as the Bureau of Mines dewpoint tester, depend on an operator to manually cool the chilled mirror slowly and to visually detect the onset of condensation. The automated methods use automatic mirror chilling controls and sensors to detect the amount of light reflected by the mirror and detect when condensation occurs through changes in the reflected light. The chilled mirror technique is a first principle measurement. Depending on the specific method used to establish the dew point temperature, some correction calculations may be necessary. As condensation must necessarily have already occurred for it to be detected, the reported temperature is lower than when using theoretical methods. Similar to GC analysis, the experimental method is subject to potential sources of error. The first error is in the detection of condensation. A key component in chilled mirror dew point measurements is the subtlety with which condensate can be detected — in other words, the thinner the film is when detected, the better. A manual chilled mirror device relies on the operator to determine when a mist has formed on the mirror, and, depending on the device, cab be highly subjective. It is also not always clear what is condensing: water or hydrocarbons. Because of the low resolution that has traditionally been available, the operator has been prone to under report the dew point, in other words, to report the dew point temperature as being below what it actually is. This {{is due to the fact}} that by the time condensation had accumulated enough to be visible, the dew point had already been reached and passed. The most modern manual devices make possible greatly improved reporting accuracy. There are two manufacturers of manual devices, and each of their devices meet the requirements for dew point measurement apparatus as defined in the ASTM Manual for <b>Hydrocarbon</b> <b>Analysis.</b> However, there are significant differences between the devices - including the optical resolution of the mirror and the method of mirror cooling - depending on the manufacturer.|$|E

40|$|High unburnt {{hydrocarbons}} (HC) emissions {{results in the}} case of carbureted two-stroke engine because of the scavenging process carried out by fresh mixture of air and fuel. Some of this air-mixture combines with the residual exhaust gas as it scavenges the cylinder. The use of lubrication oil present in the combustion process, inhibits the two-stroke engine as a mean engine to the environment. A two-stroke step-piston engine was developed to minimize these problems. The step-piston engine configurations incorporate a compression chamber which eliminates the use of crankcase compression. Therefore the usage of lubrication oil to lubricate the crankcase components could be stop. In this paper the unregulated gases namely benzene, 1, 3 -butadiene, toluene and methyl tertiary butyl ether (MTBE) were considered. Gas chromatography (GC) machine equipped with flame ionization detector (FID) was employed to detect the gases. A method was developed for analyzing hydrocarbon based gases.

The fate of petroleum in sea water is largely controlled by mechanical, physical and chemical factors which influencing the natural transformation of petroleum (oil weathering) and oil bio-degradation. On {{the basis of these}} considerations, bioremediation techniques have been developed and improved for cleaning up oil-polluted marine environment as alternative to chemical and physical techniques. To elucidate the cooperative action of mixed microbial populations in the biodegradation of crude oil, we constructed artificial consortia composed of two to three bacteria (Alcanivorax borkumensis strain SK 2, Rhodococcus erythropolis HS 4 and Pseudomonas stutzeriSDM) capable to degrade oil hydrocarbons. Using these consortia, we investigated the mechanism by which efficient biodegradation of crude oil could be accomplished by the mixed populations for application in natural environment (bioaugmentation).

Such a study is also referred to as <b>hydrocarbon</b> microtremor <b>analysis</b> and recently some contracting geophysical service companies offer such studies. This report will concentrate on the <b>hydrocarbon</b> microtremor <b>analysis</b> of synchronized signal of one frequency and an extra re-determination possibly at a separate location. The paper reports on several critical likely misconceptions and examines repeatability of hydrocarbon microtremors. This work indicates that signal generated by manmade operations can yield same tremor as that assumed for hydrocarbon reservoirs. Equally important, the presence of surface waves generated by anthropogenic signal indicates frequency limits ranging from 1 to 10 Hertz as a result of isolated surface waves. The difficulty of isolating any presumed hydrocarbon related tremors from ambient noise hamper efforts of understanding and applying microseism signals to hydrocarbon exploration and monitoring. Repeatability study by Peter, H. & Sascha, B. (2008) raised questions regarding the source of hydrocarbon microtremors. For improved chances of isolating the implied hydrocarbon microtremors from manmade tremors and near-surface impacts, the data require precise recording based on three metrics, frequencies above 3 Hz should be conserved, highly sensitive seismometers should be engaged, and the data registering time should be enough to register ‘tremor-free’ readings...|$|R
