Well, <b>he</b> <b>certainly</b> <b>is.</b> They've {{been married}} for fifteen years, and haven't had sex {{with each other for}} {{thirteen}} of them. The marriage is a front {{for the sake of the}} pub's image. The daughter, Tracey is adopted - maybe for the same reason. They have a dog too - Prince - an Alsatian...Pearl met Jack at school, and they were sweethearts from the word go. Money and things are what interest her. Jack didn't give her these fast enough in the early stages of their marriage, which is partly why it turned sour. It also went wrong because of sex: he just didn't turn her on...or didn't turn her on enough. And she never stops reminding him of how much of a man he isn't. She is basically a scrubber, trying to reform herself. [...] "Nobody turns me on like Jack" [...] she says loudly in public, [...] "I can't make it with another man." [...] But she does, often...Class is what Pearl wants, and something she'll never pull off. Yes, she's attractive. She's also flash...Pearly the worker is no fool. She can keep two sets of books with the best of them, hire with skill and fire without mercy. Sexual innuendo is the key to her character. The wink. The tease..."Have you seen the Honda 750? Take me for a ride any time!"...Her pub is spotless. And the customer's always right. Except when he isn't. Then she can be so polite, he'll wish he'd gone to a wine-bar...Sometimes Pearl gets so legless that Jack has to throw her over his shoulder and fireman's lift her upstairs to their flat, where they have separate bedrooms...She's fun, she tries and she's trapped. She's also larger than life." [...] (page 63) ...|$|E

The marriage is a front {{for the sake of the}} pub's image. The daughter, Tracey is adopted—maybe for the same reason. They have a dog too—Prince—an Alsatian...Even with a marriage on the rocks, Jack still likes the area. His mates are here, it's friendly and it's his territory. [...] "Local lad makes good"...People look up to him. If you've dragged yourself up by the scruff of the neck and moved up a notch, you need a few people around you who didn't quite make it, or you might as well be invisible. He's had a mistress for five years...Unlike Pearl, she's a very up-market woman, a lady, real class. Jack's her bit of rough, and they're happy. They actually talk. With Pearl, you shout - or shut up...He's a smart dresser. Changes his shirt twice a day and his shoes sparkle. He runs a good pub. He's firm and fair with the staff (if you've got any problems—go to him, not her.) The cellars are well organised and spotless. His masculinity is the key to his character. It was called into question at an early stage in his marriage and he's defended it ever since. Some call him a ladies' man (because of his good looks) others - a man's man...He's a con man and has the gift of the gab. He can defend himself smartly in a brawl. (He's only ever thumped Pearly once.) You can accept Jack being a snob—because it's not malicious: it's done with a grin. Like Pearl, he's also trapped by is background...Jack and Pearl's relationship is pretty heated...The smooth public face (workers in pubs are always on stage); the trial reconciliations; the rows; the fights and the tears...Will Jack ever bring his mistress into the pub, which is Pearl's territory? Will Pearl accept too many free drinks from punters and lose control in public?...They were lovers. They are husband and wife. There was affection...love...if it came to it, could they give each other up? The private grins and winks to each other when they're working as a team—which usually means taking money. The love turning to hatred...Jack the lad and the artificial Pearl...They're an electric couple." [...] (page 74).|$|E

60|$|I was {{becoming}} {{interested in the}} man. <b>He</b> <b>certainly</b> <b>was</b> of a superior kind.|$|R
60|$|Then his Majesty lit a {{cigar and}} took up a volume; <b>he</b> <b>certainly</b> <b>was</b> a sad bookworm.|$|R

6000|$|... "Well, Charles tells me," [...] said Lady Deloraine, [...] "that Sir Thomas says so, and <b>he</b> <b>certainly</b> <b>is</b> {{generally}} right; {{but it is}} not Charles' own opinion." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Well, <b>he</b> <b>certainly</b> <b>is</b> a good shot," [...] {{declared}} Fred. [...] "I saw him {{shooting at}} a target {{one day and}} he certainly made some marvelous hits." ...|$|E

5000|$|... “But <b>he</b> <b>certainly</b> <b>was</b> not a golf ball, {{and when}} the {{defendant}} sped through the stop sign and hit Mike Wilson, he did not bounce.|$|R
60|$|Wally {{listened with}} {{flattering}} attention {{as she began}} the epic of Major Christopher Selby's doings in New York. Whatever his emotions, <b>he</b> <b>certainly</b> <b>was</b> not bored.|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes, <b>he</b> <b>certainly</b> <b>is</b> {{great in}} that feature, one {{is obliged to}} admit it; but--now mind, I'm not really criticising--don't {{you think he is}} just a trifle overstrong in technique?" ...|$|E
60|$|Is {{it that he}} is {{a little}} {{restrained}} with me on his side? <b>He</b> <b>certainly</b> <b>is!</b> I felt it the moment he came into the room--I have felt it ever since.|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{did not see}} his face, Mademoiselle. They {{say that}} <b>he</b> <b>{{certainly}}</b> <b>is</b> a good soldier, M. Charles, but he certainly does not look like any one of our Vendean officers." ...|$|E
5000|$|Oboist Janet Craxton praised his selflessness, while David Patmore {{considers}} that he [...] "may {{not have been}} a great conductor, but <b>he</b> <b>certainly</b> <b>was</b> a great musician".|$|R

6000|$|... "He may be {{a banker}} now ... but <b>he</b> <b>certainly</b> <b>is</b> no royalist--he {{is the son of}} a peasant who was {{unjustly}} put to death four years ago by the duc de Kernogan." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "There is one thing--no one asks questions. His majesty {{thinks for}} his subjects, and as <b>he</b> <b>certainly</b> <b>is</b> the cleverest {{man in his}} dominions, {{everyone}} is well content {{that it should be}} so.|$|E
6000|$|... "Gosh, don't mention Duke!" [...] {{broke out}} Gif. [...] "I had all I {{could do to}} keep from getting into a row with him this morning. <b>He</b> <b>certainly</b> <b>is</b> a tart one at times." ...|$|E
6000|$|Clearly he {{was unaware}} of my presence, and I stood waiting until his pen should come to a pause. Old as <b>he</b> <b>certainly</b> <b>was</b> <b>he</b> wrote with a steady hand. [...] .|$|R
6000|$|... --But {{there are}} many eminent French critics, said the priest, who {{consider}} that even Victor Hugo, great as <b>he</b> <b>certainly</b> <b>was,</b> had not so pure a French style as Louis Veuillot.|$|R
50|$|Many {{stories in}} the sixth day do not have {{previous}} versions. Boccaccio may have invented many of them himself. <b>He</b> <b>certainly</b> <b>was</b> clever enough to have created the situations and the retorts.|$|R
6000|$|... 'You {{remind me}} of the days,' said Mr Meagles, {{suddenly}} drooping--'but she's very fond of him, and hides his faults, and thinks that no one sees them--and <b>he</b> <b>certainly</b> <b>is</b> well connected and of a very good family!' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Your parson {{may be a}} good man," [...] {{returned}} the beetle, with some indignation, [...] "but <b>he</b> <b>certainly</b> <b>is</b> not overwise. Nevertheless, if you do not want the gold I can take it from you as easily as I gave it." ...|$|E
60|$|I cannot {{understand}} this Charles Davis. He sat up calmly in his bunk, and calmly lighted his pipe ere he replied to Mr. Mellaire. <b>He</b> <b>certainly</b> <b>is</b> not insane. Yet deliberately, in cold blood, he has murdered a helpless man.|$|E
6000|$|The Merman sank--the Captain too Jumped overboard, {{and dropped}} from view Like stone from catapult; And {{when he reached}} the Merman's lair, <b>He</b> <b>certainly</b> <b>was</b> welcomed there, But, ah! with what result? ...|$|R
6000|$|... "In {{some ways}} {{it is a good}} ambition," [...] Mrs. Halliday agreed, {{although}} she was puzzled, for she thought Bernard had an object he had not stated. <b>He</b> <b>certainly</b> <b>was</b> not vain.|$|R
60|$|Physically <b>he</b> <b>certainly</b> <b>was</b> ill; {{the mental}} strain caused by two great {{conflicting}} passions had attacked his bodily strength, and whilst his brain and heart fought their battles together, his aching limbs found no repose.|$|R
6000|$|... "Well, he's {{not exactly}} young," [...] {{answered}} Mary, with a peculiar expression {{that made her}} questioner feel still more uncomfortable, [...] "yet he is scarcely middle-aged, but <b>he</b> <b>certainly</b> <b>is</b> the most splendid fellow on the frontier; and he saved my life once." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "He's {{had a good}} breakfast this morning, and {{his full}} stomach has made him sleepy," [...] thought Jerry. [...] "But he's getting {{careless}} in his old age. <b>He</b> <b>certainly</b> <b>is</b> getting careless. The idea of going to sleep right out in plain sight like that!" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "It {{would be}} just like him {{to go off and}} get full of liquor," [...] muttered the young man, with a scowl. [...] "I really ought to part company with him. But when he is {{perfectly}} sober <b>he</b> <b>certainly</b> <b>is</b> a slick one," [...] he continued meditatively.|$|E
60|$|He {{might have}} been at bottom, but <b>he</b> <b>certainly</b> <b>was</b> not at top, seeing that his coat was of the roughest and most ill-favoured kind. So, Nicholas merely {{observed}} that he shouldn't wonder if he was.|$|R
6000|$|... "I rather {{imagine he}} has left the country," [...] {{returned}} Roger. [...] "For if he was around at all, some of the school fellows would be sure to hear of him. Say, <b>he</b> <b>certainly</b> <b>was</b> a bad egg." ...|$|R
