40|$|Cold-formed Light gauge Steel Frame (LSF) wall {{systems are}} {{commonly}} used in commercial, residential and industrial buildings. This is due to their cost effectiveness, sustainability, quality and resistance to external elements such as termites and pests and high fire resistance. Conventional LSF wall systems are made of cold-formed steel studs and lined with <b>gypsum</b> <b>plasterboards.</b> When LSF walls are exposed to fire, the thermo-mechanical properties of cold-formed steel studs deteriorate at elevated temperatures, which may cause premature wall failure. Therefore, {{it is necessary to}} protect the thin-walled steel studs from direct fire exposure as well as to delay the temperature rise. LSF wall fire performance is mainly dependent on the type and configuration of wall board lining, which delays the heat transfer through the wall and prevent the steel studs from heating up. Recently, Calcium silicate board has been used in LSF wall systems because of its improved physical and thermal properties while being lightweight, cost effective, impact and moisture resistant. However, their fire performance has not been fully investigated. Hence an experimental study was conducted using calcium silicate boards. Two full scale fire tests were conducted, one with single layer calcium silicate boards and another with a combination of calcium silicate boards and <b>gypsum</b> <b>plasterboards.</b> This paper presents the details of this experimental study on LSF walls and the results of failure times and temperatures across and along the wall panels.

40|$|Load bearing LSF {{walls are}} {{commonly}} made of cold-formed steel frames, <b>gypsum</b> <b>plasterboards</b> and insulation, and their fire performance {{is an important}} aspect of design. Many experimental and numerical studies have been conducted on the fire performance of LSF walls at the Queensland University of Technology (QUT).

40|$|Light gauge Steel Frame (LSF) {{walls are}} {{commonly}} used in building construction. In general, they are lined with single or double layers of <b>gypsum</b> <b>plasterboards</b> with and without cavity insulation. <b>Gypsum</b> <b>plasterboards</b> act as a thermal barrier to protect the thin-walled steel studs from rapid temperature rise. In these walls, plasterboard joints are located along the studs for ease of construction and are protected by filler materials.

This research investigated the detrimental effects of these plasterboards joints on the fire resistance rating of single and double plasterboard lined walls based on the hot flange time-temperature profiles of studs from full scale fire tests. To overcome the detrimental effects of plasterboard joints, the back-blocking technique was used, where plasterboard joints were placed between studs with 150 mm wide plasterboards as back-blocks.

Abstract Light gauge Steel Frame (LSF) wall systems are made of cold-formed steel studs and tracks, and lined with wall lining materials. Conventionally, gypsum plasterboards are used as wall lining material in LSF wall systems. The fire performance of LSF walls is mainly dependent on the type and configuration of wall lining material, which delays the heat transfer through the wall and protects the steel studs from being heated rapidly. Recently, calcium silicate board lining is increasingly used in LSF wall systems because of its improved physical and thermal properties while being lightweight, cost effective, impact and moisture resistant. However, their fire performance has not been investigated in detail. Hence two full scale fire tests were conducted on non-load bearing LSF walls lined with calcium silicate boards. For comparison purposes two fire tests were also conducted on conventional <b>gypsum</b> <b>plasterboard</b> lined LSF walls. This paper presents {{the details of this}} experimental study on the fire performance of LSF walls and the results including fire resistance levels and time-temperature profiles across the wall panels. Effects of using calcium silicate board lining are discussed by comparing the fire test results of LSF wall lined with gypsum plasterboards and previously conducted studies on magnesium oxide board lined LSF walls. The results showed that the fire performance of calcium silicate board lined walls was similar to that of conventional <b>gypsum</b> <b>plasterboard</b> lined walls, but was superior to that of magnesium oxide board lined walls. The failure criterion of these calcium silicate board lined walls was found to be insulation as opposed to being the integrity failure observed in previous studies...|$|E

40|$|Fire {{resistance}} of cold-formed {{light gauge steel}} frame (LSF) wall systems is enhanced by lining them with single or multiple layers of wall boards with varying thermal properties. These wall boards are gypsum plasterboards or Magnesium Oxide (MgO) boards produced by different manufacturers. Thermal properties of these boards appear to show considerable variations and {{this can lead to}} varying fire resistance levels (FRL) for their wall systems. Currently FRLs of wall systems are determined using full scale fire tests, but they are time consuming and expensive. Recent research studies on the fire performance of LSF wall systems have used finite element studies to overcome this problem, but they were developed based on 1 -D and 2 -D finite element platform capable of performing either heat transfer or structural analysis separately. Hence in this research a 3 -D finite element model was developed first for LSF walls lined with <b>gypsum</b> <b>plasterboard</b> and cavity insulation materials. Accurate thermal properties of these boards are essential for finite element modelling, and thus they were measured at both ambient and elevated temperatures. This experimental study included specific heat, relative density and thermal conductivity of boards. The developed 3 -D finite element model was then validated using the available fire tests results of LSF walls lined with <b>gypsum</b> <b>plasterboard,</b> and is being used to investigate the fire performance of different LSF wall configurations. The tested MgO board exhibited significant variations in their thermal properties in comparison to gypsum plasterboards with about 50 % loss of its initial mass at about 500 ºC compared to 16 % for gypsum plasterboards. Hence the FRL of MgO board lined LSF wall systems is likely to be significantly reduced.

Interest in finding alternatives to landfill for plasterboard and other waste gypsum products has increased with the escalating costs of disposal and their reclassification as non-hazardous non-inert waste. Coventry University in collaboration with Skanska and Lafarge Plasterboard recently undertook a WRAP (Waste and Resources Action Programme) funded research to develop a cost effective novel binder using recycled <b>gypsum</b> from waste <b>plasterboard</b> and a range of mineral wastes for construction of road foundations. This chapter gives details of this investigation on potential use of <b>plasterboard</b> <b>gypsum</b> in combination with a range of mineral wastes in road bases, sub-bases and stabilised sub-grades...|$|R
40|$|Currently, {{acoustic}} {{isolation is}} one of the problems raised with building construction in Spain. The publication of the Basic Document for the protection against noise of the Technical Building Code has increased the demand of comfort for citizens. This has created the need to seek new composite materials that meet the new required acoustical building codes. In this paper we report the results of the newly developed composites that are able to improve the acoustic isolation of airborne noise. These composites were prepared from polypropylene (PP) reinforced with mechanical pulp fibers from softwood (Pinus radiata). Mechanical and acoustical properties of the composites from mechanical pulp (MP) and polypropylene (PP) have been investigated and compared to fiberglass (FG) composites. MP composites had lower tensile properties compared with FG composites, although these properties can be improved by incorporation of a coupling agent. The results of acoustical properties of MP composites were reported and compared with the conventional composites based on fiberglass and <b>gypsum</b> <b>plasterboards.</b> Finally, we suggest the application of MP composites as a light-weight building material to reduce acoustic transmition...|$|R
40|$|This article {{addresses}} the sound velocity through slurries {{as well as}} non-porous and porous materials. The focus is on using the sound velocity for the microstructure prediction of porous materials, especially <b>gypsum</b> <b>plasterboards,</b> during and after hydration. For a slurry, the model of Robeyst et al. [1] showed a good agreement with experimental data when taking into account an air content of 10 ml per kg of hemi-hydrate. This model {{takes into account the}} bulk moduli of the continuous (fluid) and discontinuous (solid) phase as well as {{the size and shape of}} the solid particles. The bulk modulus of the fluid is corrected for the presence of entrapped air. For gypsum materials, the best agreement was found between the experimental and theoretical values using a series arrangement according to Ye [2] with a solid sound velocity (cs) of 6800 m/s. Finally, the sound velocity during the hydration of gypsum is studied. The use of linear relation between the amount of hydration-product (gypsum) formed and sound velocity gives a reasonable result. Furthermore a relation between initial volume fraction hemihydrate and hydration time is shown. 1...|$|R
