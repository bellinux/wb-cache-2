5|$|The {{technique}} of carte de visite photography {{was brought to}} Denmark by Rudolph Striegler in 1860. <b>It</b> <b>spread</b> rapidly and by the 1870s provided a cheap and attractive alternative to portrait painting for photographers such as Ludvig Grundtvig (1836–1901) and Adolph Lønborg (1835–1916) in Copenhagen, and Heinrich Tønnies (1856–1903) who opened a studio in Aalborg.|$|E
5|$|There is some archaeological {{evidence}} of iron being smelted in Zimbabwe and southeast Africa {{as early as}} the eighth century BC. Iron working was introduced to Greece in the late 11th centuryBC, from which <b>it</b> <b>spread</b> quickly throughout Europe.|$|E
5|$|A Braxy-like disease {{originated}} in the Beverley-York region in 1915. Over the next 15 years <b>it</b> <b>spread</b> across most of the state's farming districts. Flock losses generally were around 5% though there were reported cases of 30% loss. In 1918 Professor Dakin of the University of Western Australia identified the disease as a toxaemia of bacterial origin {{but was unable to}} establish the source.|$|E

5|$|Because of {{the harsh}} winter conditions, the station area was {{gradually}} built with snow tunnels {{to keep the}} snow off the tracks. This included the platforms {{and most of the}} passing loop at the station. In 1914–15, the station serviced 398 passengers, and in 1919–20, it serviced 684 passengers, both times making it the least used station on the line. In 1948, {{the western part of the}} snow tunnel caught fire, and although <b>it</b> <b>spread</b> to the station building, it was quickly put out by the staff. In 1953, there was again a fire in the tunnel.|$|E
5|$|In the 15th century, the Renaissance spread rapidly {{from its}} birthplace in Florence {{to the rest}} of Italy and soon {{to the rest of}} Europe. The {{invention}} of the printing press by German printer Johannes Gutenberg allowed the rapid transmission of these new ideas. As <b>it</b> <b>spread,</b> its ideas diversified and changed, being adapted to local culture. In the 20th century, scholars began to break the Renaissance into regional and national movements.|$|E
5|$|In the mid-1990s, Bradbury accidentally hit his leg while {{chopping}} firewood. Gangrene set in, and {{his right}} leg was amputated below the knee. <b>It</b> <b>spread</b> to his left leg, and part of his left foot was amputated, leaving him in a wheelchair. The disease eventually proved fatal, and he died on 20 August 1997. He was {{survived by his wife}} Lois, who died in January 1998, and his three sons. A funeral service was held in Los Alamos, and he was buried at Guaje Pines Cemetery in Los Alamos.|$|E

Poland was accused of being an accomplice of Nazi Germany – a charge that Warsaw was hard-put to deny.|$|E
5|$|The Great Plague of 1665/1666 was {{the last}} major {{outbreak}} of bubonic plague in Great Britain. The last recorded death from plague came in 1679, and it was removed as a specific category in the Bills of Mortality after 1703. <b>It</b> <b>spread</b> to other towns in East Anglia and the southeast of England but fewer than ten percent of parishes outside London had a higher than average death rate during those years. Urban areas were more affected than rural ones; Norwich, Ipswich, Colchester, Southampton and Winchester were badly affected, while the West of England and areas of the Midlands escaped altogether.|$|E
5|$|The Mongalla region {{suffered}} {{an outbreak of}} cerebrospinal meningitis (CSM) between 1918 and 1924, apparently introduced by Ugandan porters who had served in German East Africa during World War I. CSM caused high mortality for a six-year period as <b>it</b> <b>spread</b> from one family to another. A less devastating CSM epidemic started in 1926, causing 335 deaths in 1928, 446 in 1929 and 335 {{in the first three}} months of 1930 before rapidly dying out.|$|E

5|$|A {{cold front}} was located {{north of the}} Bahamas on August26, with a broad area of {{cyclonic}} turning located east of northern Florida. Atmospheric pressures were falling in the region, and gale force winds were recorded by 12:00UTC on August27. Based on the structure, {{it is estimated that}} the frontal low developed into a tropical storm by 18:00UTC that day. Ship reports in the region suggested peak winds of 50mph (85km/h). There was very dry air {{on the west side of}} the system, unusual for August, and the radius of maximum winds was around 115mi (185km), suggesting that the structure could have been akin to a subtropical cyclone. The storm continued to the northwest, making landfall very near Myrtle Beach, South Carolina at 02:00UTC on August28. <b>It</b> <b>spread</b> rainfall across the Carolinas, later enhanced by Hurricane Able just days later, while cities reported winds of around 35mph (55km/h). The storm weakened over land and dissipated late on August28 over eastern Kentucky.|$|E

5|$|After his defeat, Dow {{continued}} to promote prohibition around the country, and was gratified to see <b>it</b> <b>spread</b> to eleven states. He also made efforts to refute the charge made by his enemies (including his cousin John Neal) that the Maine law was ineffective and that drinking had actually increased in Portland during Dow's term in office. In 1854, Dow ran for mayor again unsuccessfully; as the Whig Party {{began to break}} apart, Dow attracted support from the Free Soilers and the Know Nothings, a nativist party. By the next year, those two parties began to join anti-slavery Whigs in a new party, the Republicans. They soon controlled the state legislature and, with Dow's encouragement, strengthened the enforcement provisions of the Maine law. Dow ran again for mayor in 1855 and was narrowly re-elected to the office he had left three years earlier.|$|E
5|$|Astrology is {{the study}} of the {{movements}} and relative positions of celestial objects as a means for divining information about human affairs and terrestrial events. Astrology has been dated to at least the 2nd millennium BCE, and has its roots in calendrical systems used to predict seasonal shifts and to interpret celestial cycles as signs of divine communications. Many cultures have attached importance to astronomical events, and some – such as the Indians, Chinese, and Maya – developed elaborate systems for predicting terrestrial events from celestial observations. Western astrology, one of the oldest astrological systems still in use, can trace its roots to 19th–17th century BCE Mesopotamia, from which <b>it</b> <b>spread</b> to Ancient Greece, Rome, the Arab world and eventually Central and Western Europe. Contemporary Western astrology is often associated with systems of horoscopes that purport to explain aspects of a person's personality and predict significant events in their lives based on the positions of celestial objects; the majority of professional astrologers rely on such systems.|$|E
5|$|During {{the early}} {{phases of the}} revolt, many land (timar) holders were killed or expelled. As <b>it</b> <b>spread,</b> the nobles, whose {{holdings}} had been annexed by the Ottomans returned to join the revolt and attempts to form alliances with the Holy Roman Empire were initiated. While {{the leaders of the}} revolt were successful in defeating successive Ottoman campaigns, they failed to capture many important towns of the sanjak of Albania. Protracted sieges like that of Gjirokastër, capital of the sanjak, gave the Ottoman army time to assemble large forces {{from other parts of the}} empire and to subdue the main revolt by the end of 1436. Ottoman forces conducted a number of massacres in the aftermath of the revolt.|$|E

50|$|Sphagneticola trilobata {{is listed}} in the IUCN's “List of the world's 100 worst {{invasive}} species”. <b>It</b> is <b>spread</b> by people as an ornamental or groundcover that is planted in gardens, and then <b>it</b> is <b>spread</b> into surrounding areas by dumping of garden waste. <b>It</b> <b>spreads</b> vegetatively, not by seed. It rapidly forms a dense ground cover, crowding away and preventing other plant species from regenerating. This species is widely available as an ornamental and is therefore likely to spread further.|$|R

5|$|During {{the second}} {{hour of the}} fire <b>it</b> <b>spread</b> onto the 23rd and 24th floors. Heavy smoke was {{building}} up in the stairwells and a captain and two firefighters from Engine 11 were assigned {{to go to the}} top level to ventilate the stairwell. The three firefighters went up a center staircase from the 22nd floor and soon radioed that they were disoriented by heavy smoke on the 30th floor. There were attempts to direct the firefighters through the radio, and soon after the captain requested permission to break a window for ventilation, which was followed by a message that the captain was down. Permission to break the window was given and a search and rescue effort was initiated.|$|E
5|$|During {{the summer}} of 1877, {{tensions}} erupted in stoppages and civil unrest across the nation in what would {{become known as the}} Great Railroad Strike or simply the Great Strikes. Violence began in Martinsburg, West Virginia and spread along the rail lines through Baltimore and on to several major cities and transportation hubs of the time, including Reading, Scranton and Shamokin, Pennsylvania; a bloodless general strike in St. Louis, Missouri; and a short lived uprising in Chicago, Illinois. In the worst case, rioting in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania left 61 dead and 124 injured. Much of the city's center was burned, including more than a thousand rail cars destroyed. What began as the peaceful actions of organized labor attracted the masses of working discontent and unemployed of the depression, along with others who took opportunistic advantage of the chaos. In total, an estimated 100,000 workers participated nationwide. State and federal troops followed the unrest as <b>it</b> <b>spread</b> along the rail lines from city to city, beginning in Baltimore, where the movement of troops itself provoked a violent response that ultimately required federal intervention to quell.|$|E
5|$|Early in the season, a {{low-pressure}} area {{formed and}} persisted north of Honduras. Despite moderate wind shear, the low managed to organize, and was designated Tropical Depression One on June 8. The storm strengthened further, {{and it was}} upgraded to Tropical Storm Arlene on the following day. From this point, Arlene headed north, intensifying steadily as <b>it</b> <b>spread</b> tropical storm-force winds and heavy rains to the Cayman Islands and Cuba. Arlene made landfall in Cuba near Cabo Corrientes with 50mph (80km/h) winds. Wind shear weakened as the storm entered the Gulf of Mexico {{on the morning of}} June 10, and the storm intensified to just under hurricane strength with 70mph (110km/h) winds.|$|E
