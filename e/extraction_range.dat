The objective {{this study was to}} compaire the official methods with solid-phase microextraction (SPME) for the analysis of compounds migrating from cross-linked polyethylene into water. A medium polarity polydimethylsiloxane/divinylbenzene (PDMS/DVB) was proved most efficient for the SPME extraction.

30|$|Considering the {{combination}} storage method {{of the full}} storage and the incremental storage is applied by these version files, we do not just verify the chosen file, but scale up the <b>extraction</b> <b>range</b> to all version files related to the chosen file by the link relationship in the version group while one of these files is extracted to be verified. Thus, we need to locate the version group the chosen file belongs to and the relative version files in the version group. All the files in the current version group are determined whether they are intact. Therefore, while a file in a version group is randomly extracted and verified, all the files in the version group will be extracted to execute the verification actually. We define this data extraction as random diffusion extraction corresponding to random extraction. The random diffusion extraction collects the results of random extraction and then finds a relevant version group by the version relationship model to determine the final set of extracted files. By performing batch verification of all these extracted files, we can verify {{the integrity of the}} full content of the chosen file. Meanwhile, once the verification can cover multiple continuous version files even all version files, the reliability of data storage can be further enhanced.|$|E
40|$|Ocean tides {{are deemed}} {{to become a}} stable source of {{renewable}} energy for the future. Tidal energy has two components, {{the first is the}} potential energy due to sea level variations and the second comes from the kinetic energy of the tidal streams. This paper is concerned with the backward effect on the ocean currents by a tidal stream farm located in the open shallow sea. Recent studies in channels with 1 -D models have indicated that the power potential is not given purely by the flux of kinetic energy, as has been commonly assumed. In this study, a 3 -D ocean circulation model is used to estimate (i) maximum extractable energy at different levels of rated generation capacity of the farm, (ii) changes in the strength of currents due to energy extraction, and (iii) alterations in the pattern of residual currents and pathways of passive tracers. As water flow is influenced both by tidal and non-tidal currents, the model takes into account wind-driven and density-driven currents generated by meteorological forcing. Numerical modelling has been carried out for a hypothetical circular farm located in the Celtic Sea north of Cornwall, an area known for its high level of tidal energy. Modelling results clearly indicate that extracted power does not grow linearly with the increase in the rated capacity of the farm. For the case studies covered in this paper, a 100 -fold increase in rated generation capacity of the farm results only in 7 -fold increase in extracted power, this loss of efficiency is much greater than was estimated earlier with 1 -D models. In case of high rated capacity of the farm, kinetic energy of currents is altered significantly as far as 10 – 20 km away from the farm. At high levels of extracted energy the currents tend to avoid flowing through the farm, an effect which is not captured with 1 -D models. Residual currents are altered as far as a hundred kilometres. The magnitude of changes in the dispersion of tracers is highly sensitive to the location. For the drifters analysed in this study, variations in the end-to-start distance due to energy <b>extraction</b> <b>range</b> from 13 % to 238 %...|$|E
40|$|A {{procedure}} {{to assess the}} bioavailability of persistent organic pollutants (POPs) from soil samples has been developed. The procedure {{is based on the}} use of simulated in vitro gastrointestinal extraction to remove POPs from soil matrices. The level of recovery, using this approach, is assessed following liquid–liquid extraction (LLE) and analysis by gas chromatography-mass selective detection (GC-MSD). The remaining soil residue is then extracted using pressurised fluid extraction (PFE) followed by GC-MSD analysis to assess the residual fraction. The residual fraction is monitored to determine the unavailable fraction i. e. not available for absorption in the gastrointestinal tract of humans. The procedure was applied to four soil samples i. e. an aged, spiked soil and three certified reference materials (CRMs) contaminated with POPs. Recoveries of pesticides (lindane, endosulfan I, endrin, DDE, DDD and endosulfan II), phenols (cresol, TCP and PCP), and base neutral compounds (hexachloroethane, acenaphthene, dibenzofuran, fluorene and hexachlorobenzene) from aged, spiked soil following extraction with gastric fluid ranged from 0. 8 to 8. 3 % while following intestinal <b>extraction</b> <b>ranged</b> from 5. 5 to 13. 5 %, irrespective of POP.

40|$|Understanding the {{speciation}} of the multioxidation {{states of}} selenium {{is vital to}} predicting the mineralization, mobilization, and toxicity of the trace element in natural systems. Asequential extraction scheme (SES) was developed for identification of Se oxidation states that first employed 0. 1 M (pH 7. 0) K 2 HPO 4 -KH 2 PO 4 (P-buffer) to release soluble selenate (Se+VI) and selenide (Se-II) and ligand-exchangeable selenite (Se+IV). The second step involved oxidation of organic materials with 0. 1 M K 2 S 2 O 8 (90 °C) to release Se-II and Se+IV associated or occluded with organic matter. The final step used HNO 3 (90 °C) to solubilize insoluble Se remaining in the sample. The solubilized Se compounds were speciated by a selective hydride generation atomic absorption spectrophotometry technique. Accuracy of the developed SES method (96 - 103 % recovery) was verified by use of prepared Se compounds of known speciation, NIST standard reference materials, and existing seleniferous soils.

40|$|Abstract 350 words maximum: (PLEASE TYPE) Background Indications for cardiac implantable {{electronic}} devices (CIED’s) continue to expand. Increases {{in the number}} of devices implanted have resulted in an increased incidence of complications. These complications sometime require extraction of CIED leads for definitive treatment. I explore the indications, complications, microbiology and success rates involved with lead extraction in a high volume centre over a 20 year period. I also report long term follow up of these patients including mortality, recurrent device infection and need for repeat procedures Methods and Results Retrospective analysis was reported of all consecutive patients undergoing lead extraction between 1992 and 2012. 1006 leads were extracted from 510 patients. The clinical success rate was 98. 2 % and complete procedural success rate was 92. 2 %. There was one intra-procedural death. Infection was the only identified predictor of increased complication (χ² for difference between groups 20, P < 0. 0001). The mean follow up was 5. 5 +/- 4. 9 years (range 0. 2 – 18 years). Cumulative mortality was 10. 0 % at 1 year and 33. 0 % at 10 years. Factors associated with increased long term mortality included cardiac device infection (CDI) (33 % vs 17 % for non-CDI; χ² 13. 8, P = 0. 0003), procedural complications (43 % vs 27 % for no complications; χ² 4. 2, P = 0. 04), age (75. 0 +/- 10. 9 years in patients who died vs 62. 7 +/- 17. 2 years, P < 0. 0001) and impaired renal function (Creatinine 142. 5 +/- 106. 4 umol/L in patients who died vs 106. 3 +/- 90. 7 umol/L, P = 0. 001). There was comparable mortality in those patients who did not have a replacement device after transvenous lead extraction (TLE) compared with a replacement (27 % vs 24 %, P = 0. 72). The rate of CDI after TLE was 3. 9 % (mean 11. 6 months post <b>extraction,</b> <b>range</b> 0. 3 to 84 months) and is higher in patients with retained lead fragments (13. 5 % vs 3. 0 % % with complete removal; χ² 10. 7 P = 0. 001). Conclusion Pacing and ICD leads can be safely extracted with mechanical techniques. Long term mortality following TLE is high particularly in those with systemic infection, procedural complications, advanced age and renal impairment. Device therapy can be safely withdrawn in some patients. Finally; retained fragments are a risk factor for CDI post extraction...|$|E

The addition of CO 2,s to the fruits induces the intracellular water freezing and the consequent laceration of cellular membranes could induce the diffusion of many cellular compounds. In the experimental conditions adopted, {{the addition of the}} cryogen to the olives during pre-milling phase greatly increased the <b>extraction</b> yield (<b>ranging</b> from ≅ 1 to ≅ 21...|$|R

40|$|International audienceThe medical area conveys very {{specific}} terms (p. ex., blepharospasm, appendicec-tomy), which {{are difficult to}} understand by people without medical training. We propose an automatic method for the acquisition of paraphrases, which we expect to be easier to understand than the original terms. The method {{is based on the}} morphological analysis of terms, syntactic analysis of texts, and text mining of non specialized texts. An analysis of the results and their evaluation indicate that such paraphrases can indeed be found and show easier understanding level. According to the setting of the method, precision of the <b>extractions</b> <b>ranges</b> between 90 and 7. 4 %. Such resources are useful for several NLP applications (p. ex., information retrieval, text simplification [...] .). Le domaine médical manipule des termes très spécifiques comme blépharospasme, appendicectomie, qui sont difficiles à comprendre par les non-spécialistes. Nous proposons une méthode automatique pour l'acquisition de paraphrases, qui soient plus faciles à comprendre que les termes originaux. La méthode est fondée sur l'analyse morphologique des termes, l'ana-lyse syntaxique et la fouille de textes non spécialisés. L'analyse et l'évaluation des résultats in-diquent que de telles paraphrases peuvent être extraites et présentent une compréhension plus facile. En fonction de paramètres, la précision varie entre 90 et 7, 4 %. Ce type de ressources est utile pour plusieurs applications de TAL (recherche d'information, simplification de textes [...] .) ...|$|R
40|$|Okra has {{different}} uses {{as a food}} and a remedy in traditional medicine. Since it produces many seeds, distribution of the plant is also quite easy. Although seed oil yield is low (4. 7 %), since the linoleic acid composition of the seed oil is quiet high (67. 5 %), it can still {{be used as a}} source of (UNSAT) unsaturated fatty acids. In this study, samples of okra grown in four different locations were analyzed to measure fatty acid and amino acid compositions. The content of the lipid <b>extraction</b> <b>ranged</b> from 4. 34 % to 4. 52 % on a dry weight basis. Quantitatively, the main okra fatty acids were palmitic acid (29. 18 – 43. 26 %), linoleic acid (32. 22 – 43. 07 %), linolenic acid (6. 79 – 12. 34 %), stearic acid (6. 36 – 7. 73 %), oleic acid (4. 31 – 6. 98 %), arachidic acid (ND– 3. 48 %), margaric acid (1. 44 – 2. 16 %), pentadecylic acid (0. 63 – 0. 92 %), and myristic acid (0. 21 – 0. 49 %). Aspartic acid, proline, and glutamic acids were the main amino acids in okra pods, while cysteine and tyrosine were the minor amino acids. Statistical methods revealed how the fatty acid and amino acid contents in okra may be affected by the sampling location...|$|R
40|$|One {{hundred and}} seventy five ground {{sections}} of teeth removed for age determination from unidentified bodies were reviewed. The {{causes of death}} were motor vehicle accidents, murders, train accidents, natural causes, gunshot wounds, fires, drownings, suicides, explosions and unknown causes. The period after death {{at the time of}} the <b>extractions</b> <b>ranged</b> from 1 day to over 21 days and were unknown in some cases. In addition, 20 sections of freshly extracted teeth from patients undergoing treatment were studied after preparation in batches of 5 on day 4, 10, 15 and 20 after extraction. Forty five of the 175, and none of the 20 freshly extracted teeth depicted a dark discoloration of the pulp. The discoloration involved the coronal, the radicular or the whole pulp. The discoloured material consisted of structureless pulp tissue, prominent darkly pigmented vessels or both. Staining of the dentine was present in 13 specimens, always in relation to the discoloured part of the pulp and occurred only in those teeth where the pulpal tissues were homogeneously discoloured. No statistical correlation could be found between causes of death, period after death or any of the pulpal features associated with staining. It is concluded that when teeth appear pink clinically they represent the most prominent form of post-mortem staining and that a spectrum of minor staining patterns of the pulp and dentine exists.

40|$|ABSTRACT Land planarians (Platyhelminthes) {{are likely}} {{important}} {{components of the}} soil cryptofauna, although relevant aspects of their ecology such as their density remain largely unstudied. We investigated absolute and relative densities of flatworms in three patches of secondary Brazilian Atlantic rainforest in an urban environment. Two methods of sampling were carried out, one consisting of 90 hours of active search in delimited plots covering 6, 000 m² over a year, and the other consisting of leaf litter extraction from a 60 m² soil area, totaling 480 - 600 l leaf litter. We found 288 specimens of 16 species belonging to the genera Geobia, Geoplana, Issoca, Luteostriata, Obama, Paraba, Pasipha, Rhynchodemus, Xerapoa, and the exotic species Bipalium kewense and Dolichoplana striata. Specimens up to 10 mm long were mostly sampled only with the leaf litter extraction method. Absolute densities, calculated from data obtained with leaf litter <b>extraction,</b> <b>ranged</b> between 1. 25 and 2. 10 individuals m- 2. These values are 30 to 161 times higher than relative densities, calculated from data obtained by active search. Since most common sampling method used in land planarian studies on species composition and faunal inventories is active search {{for a few hours}} in a locality, our results suggest that small species might be overlooked. It remains to be tested whether similar densities of this cryptofauna are also found in primary forests...|$|R
