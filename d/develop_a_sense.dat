5|$|Part {{of the new}} {{genre of}} the Romantic travel narrative, History of a Six Weeks' Tour exudes spontaneity and enthusiasm; the authors {{demonstrate}} their desire to <b>develop</b> <b>a</b> <b>sense</b> of taste and distinguish themselves from those around them. The romantic elements of the work would have hinted at the text's radical politics to nineteenth-century readers. However, the text's frank discussion of politics, including positive references to the French Revolution and praise of Enlightenment philosopher Jean-Jacques Rousseau, was unusual for a travel narrative at the time, particularly one authored primarily by a woman.|$|E

25|$|Adults with C-PTSD have {{sometimes}} experienced prolonged interpersonal traumatization as {{children as well}} as prolonged trauma as adults. This early injury interrupts the development of a robust sense of self and of others. Because physical and emotional pain or neglect was often inflicted by attachment figures such as caregivers or older siblings, these individuals may <b>develop</b> <b>a</b> <b>sense</b> that they are fundamentally flawed and that others cannot be relied upon.|$|E
25|$|As {{children}} {{transition from}} early childhood to middle childhood, their motivation to participate changes. In both the Indigenous communities of Quechua people and Rioja in Peru, children often experience a transition {{in which they}} become more included into their family's and community's endeavors. This changes their position and role in their families to more responsible ones and leads {{to an increase in}} their eagerness to participate and belong. As children go through this transition, they often <b>develop</b> <b>a</b> <b>sense</b> of identity within their family and community.|$|E
25|$|While the Russian {{community}} in Latvia was largely {{an extension of}} Russia's ethnic Russians, it nevertheless also began to <b>develop</b> <b>a</b> <b>sense</b> of community separate from Russia itself, Latvian Russians were beginning to consider themselves one of the nationalities of Latvia. Russian social organizations began to spring up in the 1860s, {{around the same time}} as that of the Latvian National Awakening. The reforms of Alexander II, including the abolition of serfdom in 1861 {{throughout the rest of the}} empire, further stimulated the rise of a national consciousness.|$|E

25|$|Drummers use {{a variety}} of {{accessories}} when practicing. Metronomes and beat counters are used to <b>develop</b> <b>a</b> <b>sense</b> of a steady pulse. Drum muffling pads may be used to lessen the volume of drums during practicing. A practice pad, held on the lap, on a leg, or mounted on a stand, is used for near-silent practice with drumsticks. A set of practice pads mounted to simulate an entire drum kit is known as a practice kit. In the 2010s, these have largely been superseded by electronic drums, which can be listened to with headphones for quiet practice and kits with non-sounding mesh heads.|$|E
25|$|Culture {{not only}} {{influences}} {{the age at}} which the reminiscence bump appears but also the content of the memories found within the bump. Western cultures often value individuality, agency, and distinctiveness, where individuals are encouraged to develop and maintain their private beliefs, attitudes, and personality traits. Alternatively, Asian cultures often value group solidarity, communion, and interconnectedness, where individuals are encouraged to <b>develop</b> <b>a</b> <b>sense</b> of self that is aligned with social roles, duties, and responsibilities. The differences in societal norms expressed by Western and Asian cultures influence the focus of memories. Individuals from Western cultures have memories that cast the individual as the central character and often have self-focused autobiographical memories. Individuals from Asian cultures have memories that express a strong group orientation and often have relation-centered autobiographical memories.|$|E
25|$|While {{he was in}} {{hospital}} recovering from malaria, Moses received a personal letter from the Prime Minister of Australia, John Curtin. His Australian Labor Party had always been treated roughly by the newspapers, particularly the Murdoch press, and when {{it had come to}} power in 1941, it had instructed the ABC to ignore its agreements with the news agencies, and to gather its own news. Curtin feared that unless Moses was at the helm, the ABC would revert to sourcing all its news from the agencies. Moreover, Curtin wanted the ABC to <b>develop</b> <b>a</b> <b>sense</b> of national identity, and to provide the workers and service personnel with more entertainment. This last task inevitably set Moses up for a clash with Cleary, but now it was the general manager who held the cards, and Cleary resigned on 30 March 1945.|$|E

25|$|Learned {{helplessness}} theory {{posits that}} because human bodies are only alterable {{to a certain}} point, people <b>develop</b> <b>a</b> <b>sense</b> of body shame and anxiety from which they create a feeling of helplessness in relation to correcting their physical appearance and helplessness {{in being able to}} control the way in which others perceive their appearance. This lack of control often results in depression. In relating to a lack of motivation, objectification theory states that women have less control in relationships and the work environment because they have to depend on the evaluation of another who is typically basing their evaluation on physical appearance. Since the dependence on another's evaluation limits a woman's ability to create her own positive experiences and motivation, it adversely increases her likelihood for depression. Furthermore, sexual victimization may be a cause. Specifically, victimization within the workplace degrades women. Harassment experienced every day wears on a woman, and sometimes results in a state of depression.|$|E

500|$|Believing {{that his}} {{character}} was [...] "sort of a surrogate father figure" [...] to Henry, Sbarge {{admitted that the}} script [...] "made me weep because what {{they came up with}} is so lovely and magical and delightful." [...] Referring to his character's storyline as a hero's journey, Sbarge said the intention was to show that Jiminy Cricket did not just begin as a noble guy – [...] "what you get to see on this trip are the fire rings he had to walk through to get to a place where he could evolve to <b>develop</b> <b>a</b> <b>sense</b> of doing the right thing." [...] The episode featured guest stars Harry Groener and Carolyn Hennesy as Jiminy's parents Martin and Myrna.

She wrestles with her contradictory thoughts for a long time; keeping Ged alive would be contrary to all her teachings and the powers she serves, but sacrificing him would be contrary to her developing respect for life. An important moment in this process is when Ged calls her by her true name, and clarifies for her the choice between remaining in the Tombs as Arha and embracing Tenar and stepping into the larger world of Earthsea. Afterwards she has a nightmare about suffocating, a motif Cummins describes as being common to female coming-of-age stories.|$|E

500|$|As an anthology, {{each season}} of Fargo is {{engineered}} {{to have a}} self-contained narrative, following a disparate set of characters in various settings. Noah Hawley {{and his team of}} writers used the second season to expand the scope of the show's storytelling—from its narrative to its characters. They increased the show's cast of core characters to five, each with interconnecting arcs and different viewpoints of the central story. Hawley wanted viewers to sympathize with characters they might not feel empathy for in real life. The producers at one point discussed revisiting a modern period for their story. Ultimately, their vision—inspired by Miller's Crossing (1990) and The Man Who Wasn't There (2001), in addition to the show's namesake film (1996)—was realized as a prequel that takes place 27 years before the events of the first season of Fargo (set in 2006) in 1979, rotating between Luverne, Minnesota, Fargo, North Dakota and Sioux Falls, South Dakota. According to Hawley, the change in the time period helped to <b>develop</b> <b>a</b> <b>sense</b> of turbulence and violence in a world that [...] "could not be more fractured and complicated and desperate".|$|E
500|$|In {{his first}} school year, Mao befriended an older student, Xiao Zisheng; {{together}} {{they went on}} a walking tour of Hunan, begging and writing literary couplets to obtain food. A popular student, Mao remained active in school politics, and in 1915 was elected secretary of the Students Society.

In spring 1917, {{he was elected to}} command the students' volunteer army, set up to defend the school from marauding warlord soldiers, arming these troops with makeshift bamboo spears and wooden rifles. Increasingly interested in the techniques of war, he took a keen interest in the events of World War I, but also began to <b>develop</b> <b>a</b> <b>sense</b> of solidarity with workers. Mao undertook feats of physical endurance with Xiao Zisheng and Cai Hesen, describing themselves as the [...] "Three Heroes," [...] a sobriquet taken from the Romance of the Three Kingdoms. With other young revolutionaries they formed the Renovation of the People Study Society in April 1918 to debate Chen Duxiu's ideas. Desiring personal and societal transformation, the Society gained between 70 and 80 members, including some females, many of whom would go on to join the Communist Party.
