40|$|The {{increasing}} demand on improved reception and high data throughput brings into focus {{the design of}} compact multiband antenna terminals with diversity reception capability. In particular, the influence of user on diversity performance is of current interest. In this paper, the diversity performance of compact tri-band antennas (WCDMA 850, WCDMA 1800 and UMTS 2100) for mobile handsets is evaluated in the data mode position. The {{results indicate that the}} user hand has a significant negative effect on the mean <b>effective</b> <b>gains</b> of the diversity antennas. On the other hand, the signal correlation is relatively unaffected by the hand, and it even improved for the WCDMA 850 band. However, the decrease in correlation between the branches in the WCDMA 850 band is inadequate to offset the degradation in diversity system gain resulting from the reduced mean <b>effective</b> <b>gains.</b> Moreover, the loss of efficiency due to mutual coupling is particularly severe at the WCDMA 850 band. Consequently, only a small diversity system gain of less than 1 dB is obtained for the lowest band, whereas a 5 dB gain is achieved for the higher bands...|$|R

40|$|Abstract—The mean <b>effective</b> <b>gain</b> is an {{attractive}} performance measure of mobile handsets, since it incorporates both directional and polarization properties of the handset and environment. In this work the mean <b>effective</b> <b>gain</b> is computed from measured spherical radiation patterns of five different mobile handsets, both in free space and including a human head & shoulder phantom. Different models of the environment allow {{a comparison of the}} mean <b>effective</b> <b>gain</b> obtained for realistic models based on measurements with the total radiated power and the total isotropic sensitivity. All the comparisons are based on the mean <b>effective</b> <b>gain</b> values obtained for different orientations of the handsets in the environments. For practical measurements it is important to minimize the measurement time. The paper includes a study of the variation in mean <b>effective</b> <b>gain</b> when the number of samples in the spherical radiation pattern is reduced. Furthermore, the frequency dependence of the mean <b>effective</b> <b>gain</b> is investigated, and a method is proposed for reducing the required number of measurements on different frequencies.
