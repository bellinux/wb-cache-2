5|$|After {{the death}} of Bede in 735, Latin prose in England declined. It reached its lowest level in the ninth century, when <b>few</b> <b>books</b> and {{charters}} were produced, and they were of poor quality. King Æthelstan's grandfather, Alfred the Great (871–899) embarked on an extensive programme to improve learning, and by the 890s the standard of Latin in charters was improving. Few charters survive from the reigns of Alfred and his son, Edward the Elder (899–924), and none from 909 to 925. Up to then charters had generally been plain legal documents, and King Æthelstan's early diplomas were similar.|$|E
5|$|As Peter and Lois {{are driving}} to Cape Cod for their second honeymoon, Peter is reading a Jughead comic book and their car crashes. The fictional Park Barrington Hotel, where Peter and Lois steal Gibson's film, {{is located in}} Manhattan.

To stop Meg and Chris from fighting, Brian reads to them from one of the <b>few</b> <b>books</b> Peter owns, a novelization of the 1980 film Caddyshack and quotes a line by Chevy Chase's character, Ty Webb.|$|E
5|$|Eddie Izzard as {{the voice}} of Reepicheep, a swashbuckling mouse. Over 100 actors auditioned to voice the character. Izzard {{approached}} Reepicheep as less camp and more of a bloodthirsty assassin with a sense of honour (a cross between Mad Max and a Stormtrooper from Star Wars): Izzard interpreted Reepicheep as someone whose family was killed by the Telmarines. The Narnia series were some of the <b>few</b> <b>books</b> Izzard read as a child, and he cherished them. When discussing Reepicheep to the animators, Adamson told them to rent as many Errol Flynn films as possible. Adamson credits Izzard for making the role his own; beforehand, the director was approaching the character similarly to Puss in Boots in Shrek 2.|$|E

5|$|The Wrongs of Woman {{begins in}} medias res with the upper-class Maria's unjust {{imprisonment}} by her husband, George Venables. Not only has he condemned Maria {{to live in}} an insane asylum, but he has also taken their child away from her. She manages to befriend one of her attendants in the asylum, an impoverished, lower-class woman named Jemima, who, after realizing that Maria is not mad, agrees to bring her a <b>few</b> <b>books.</b> Some of these have notes scribbled in them by Henry Darnford, another inmate, and Maria falls in love with him via his marginalia. The two begin to communicate and eventually meet. Darnford reveals that he has had a debauched life; waking up in the asylum after a night of heavy drinking, he has been unable to convince the doctors to release him.|$|E
5|$|In 1897, Garran {{published}} The Coming Commonwealth, {{an influential}} {{book on the}} history of the Federation movement and the debate over the 1891 draft of the Constitution of Australia. The book was based on material he prepared for a course on federalism and federal systems of government, which he had planned to give at the University of Sydney, but which failed to attract a sufficient number of students. Nevertheless, the book was both unique and popular, as one of the <b>few</b> <b>books</b> on the topic at the time, with the first edition quickly selling out. Soon after its publication the Premier of New South Wales George Reid, who had been elected as a New South Wales delegate to the 1897–1898 Constitutional Convention, invited Garran to be his secretary. At the Convention, Reid appointed him secretary of the Drafting Committee, at Barton's request; he was also a member of the Press Committee.|$|E

25|$|Trollope's {{popularity}} and critical success diminished {{in his later}} years, but he continued to write prolifically, {{and some of his}} later novels have acquired a good reputation. In particular, critics who concur that the book was not popular when published, generally acknowledge the sweeping satire The Way We Live Now (1875) as his masterpiece. In all, Trollope wrote forty-seven novels, as well as dozens of short stories and a <b>few</b> <b>books</b> on travel.|$|E
25|$|The final {{decades of}} the firm were marked by {{repeated}} financial crises; and in 1887, Tinsley Brothers had liabilities of £1,000. The <b>few</b> <b>books</b> dated 1888 from the firm are presumably orders already placed with the printers before bankruptcy. Tinsley survived his firm by fourteen years and towards the end {{was able to give}} a picture of Victorian publishing life in Random Recollections of an Old Publisher (1900). He died of chronic Bright's disease at his home in Wood Green on 1 May 1902.|$|E
25|$|Ibn Sīnā wrote {{extensively}} on early Islamic philosophy, especially the subjects logic, ethics, and metaphysics, including treatises named Logic and Metaphysics. Most {{of his works}} were written in Arabic–then the language of science in the Middle East– and some in Persian. Of linguistic significance {{even to this day}} are a <b>few</b> <b>books</b> that he wrote in nearly pure Persian language (particularly the Danishnamah-yi 'Ala', Philosophy for Ala' ad-Dawla'). Ibn Sīnā's commentaries on Aristotle often criticized the philosopher, encouraging a lively debate in the spirit of ijtihad.|$|E
40|$|As {{noted by}} Jespersen (1970, 106), English few takes {{comparative}} and superlative suffixes: (1) John has <b>fewer</b> <b>books</b> than Bill. (2) John has the <b>fewest</b> <b>books</b> of anybody I know. {{in a way}} that makes it natural to take few to be an adjective. Few also patterns with adjectives in the way it takes degree modifiers: (3) John is too rich. (4) John has too few friends. as well as in the way it disallows much: (5) *John is too much rich. (6) *John has too much few friends. But what exactly does the adjective few modify? Taking it to modify friends in (4) might seem reasonable at first glance, yet would lose the parallelism between (4) and: (7) John has too small a number of friends. in which the adjective small modifies number, not friends. For this and other reasons, I proposed in earlier work 1 that few invariably modifies either the noun number or its unpronounced counterpart (which I will represent usin...|$|R

25|$|The Great Throwdini (aka Rev Dr David Adamovich) - Adamovich started {{throwing}} {{later in}} life than many other top performers, following multiple careers that included exercise physiology, pool hall management and ordained minister. He is noted for fast throwing and for reviving the impalement arts amid the modern burlesque and cabaret scene in New York. He holds a number of world records. Together with target girl Tina Nagy he appeared in the 2007 series of the NBC television show America's Got Talent, succeeding {{in the first round}} but dropping out before the final.

25|$|Around 1874, he {{graduated}} from a Chișinău private school where classes were taught German, and entered the school for dvoryane in the city, where he became close friends with Alexandru Grosu and Lev Matveyevich Kogan-Bernstein (who were {{the basis for the}} characters Sașa Lungu and Moise Roitman in Stere's novel). It was also around this time that he became acquainted with progressive, utopian socialist, and Darwinist ideas (notably reading the works of Nikolai Chernyshevsky, Alexander Herzen, Charles Darwin, Karl Marx, Mikhail Bakunin, Ferdinand Lassalle, and Peter Lavrovich Lavrov). Stere later indicated that, before the late 1870s, he could not spell the Romanian alphabet, which had just been adopted over the border (see Romanian Cyrillic alphabet), and had to rely on a <b>few</b> <b>books</b> smuggled into Bessarabia for getting a sense of literary Romanian.|$|E
25|$|Many reports erroneously {{stated that}} Borel's room {{was full of}} Nazi-insignia, and rumors he was sympathizing with fascist {{ideologies}} were spurred even more {{by the fact that}} his stepfather had attended several meetings of the Front National in 1989. But besides a picture of Adolf Hitler cut out from a newspaper, graffiti displaying a swastika on his door, a <b>few</b> <b>books</b> on World War II, as well as a documentary about David Koresh and the Waco siege, no evidence was found after his death that he was interested in any kind of politics. Also, a girl from Cuers spread the story that Eric had told her about his relationship with his half-sister Caroline, {{who was supposed to be}} his pregnant girlfriend.

25|$|The Old Testament canon {{entered into}} Christian {{use in the}} Septuagint, a Greek {{translation}} with a <b>few</b> <b>books</b> in Greek originally. In addition to the Septuagint, Christianity subsequently added various writings that would become the New Testament. Somewhat different lists of accepted works continued to develop in antiquity. In the 4th century a series of synods, most notably at the Synod of Hippo in AD 393, produced a list of texts equal to the 46 book canon of the Old Testament that Catholics use today (and the 27-book canon of the New Testament that all use). A definitive list {{did not come from}} any early Ecumenical Council. Also, c. 400, Jerome produced a definitive Latin edition of the Bible, the contents of which, at the insistence of the Pope, was in accord with the earlier Synods. With the benefit of hindsight {{it can be said that}} this process effectively set the New Testament canon, although there are examples of other canonical lists in use after this time.|$|E
25|$|Printing in Northern China {{was further}} {{advanced}} by the 11th century, {{as it was}} written by the Song Dynasty scientist and statesman Shen Kuo (1031–1095) that the common artisan Bi Sheng (990-1051) invented ceramic movable type printing. Then there were those such as Wang Zhen (fl. 1290-1333) who invented respectively wooden type setting, which later influenced developing metal moveable type printing in Korea (1372-1377). Movable type printing was a tedious process if one were to assemble thousands of individual characters for the printing of simply one or a <b>few</b> <b>books,</b> but if used for printing thousands of books, the process was efficient and rapid enough to be successful and highly employed. Indeed, there were many cities in China where movable type printing, in wooden and metal form, was adopted by the enterprises of wealthy local families or large private industries. The Qing Dynasty court sponsored enormous printing projects using woodblock movable type printing during the 18th century. Although superseded by western printing techniques, woodblock movable type printing remains in use in isolated communities in China.|$|E
25|$|In 1933, Borges {{gained an}} {{editorial}} appointment at the literary supplement {{of the newspaper}} Crítica, where he first published the pieces collected as Historia universal de la infamia (A Universal History of Infamy) in 1935. The book includes two types of writing: the first lies somewhere between non-fictional essays and short stories, using fictional techniques to tell essentially true stories. The second consists of literary forgeries, which Borges initially passed off as translations of passages from famous but seldom-read works. In the following years, {{he served as a}} literary adviser for the publishing house Emecé Editores and from 1936 to 1939 wrote weekly columns for El Hogar. In 1938, Borges found work as first assistant at the Miguel Cané Municipal Library. It was in a working class area and there were so <b>few</b> <b>books</b> that cataloguing more than one hundred books per day, he was told, would leave little to do for the other staff and so look bad.
