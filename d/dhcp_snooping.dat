50|$|Allied Telesis {{switches}} implement MACFF using <b>DHCP</b> <b>snooping</b> {{to maintain}} a database of the hosts that appear on each switch port. When a host tries to access the network through a switch port, <b>DHCP</b> <b>snooping</b> checks the hostâ€™s IP address against the database {{to ensure that the}} host is valid.|$|E
50|$|Rogue DHCP servers can {{be stopped}} {{by means of}} {{intrusion}} detection systems with appropriate signatures, {{as well as by}} some multilayer switches, which can be configured to drop the packets. One of the most common methods to deal with rogue DHCP servers is called <b>DHCP</b> <b>snooping.</b> <b>DHCP</b> <b>snooping</b> drops DHCP messages from a DHCP server that is not trusted.|$|E
50|$|In {{computer}} networking, <b>DHCP</b> <b>snooping</b> is {{a series}} of techniques applied to improve the security of a DHCP infrastructure.|$|E
5000|$|Other {{features}} may use <b>DHCP</b> <b>snooping</b> database {{information to}} ensure IP integrity on a Layer 2 switched domain. This information enables a network to: ...|$|E
5000|$|When DHCP servers are allocating IP {{addresses}} to {{the clients}} on the LAN, <b>DHCP</b> <b>snooping</b> can be configured on LAN switches to prevent malicious or malformed DHCP traffic, or rogue DHCP servers. In addition, information on hosts which have successfully completed a DHCP transaction is accrued in {{a database of}} [...] "bindings" [...] which may then be used by other security or accounting features.|$|E
50|$|MACFF then uses <b>DHCP</b> <b>snooping</b> {{to check}} whether the host has a gateway Access Router. If it does, MACFF uses {{a form of}} Proxy ARP to reply to any ARP requests, giving the router's MAC address. This forces the host to send all traffic to the router, even traffic destined to a host in the same subnet as the source. The router {{receives}} the traffic and makes forwarding decisions based {{on a set of}} forwarding rules, typically a QoS policy or a set of filters.|$|E
30|$|As {{explained}} in Section 1, neglecting unsolicited ARP replies cannot prevent ARP cache poisoning, since ARP requests {{can be easily}} induced by source address-spoofed ICMP echo request messages. If the member nodes of a given subnet do not change frequently, then the ARP cache poisoning might be avoided by employing static ARP. However, this approach may be infeasible {{in an environment where}} the IP addresses are allocated to mobile nodes dynamically through Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol (DHCP). DAI corresponds to the approach that requires the support of ethernet switches [8]. In the DAI, the ethernet switch checks the validity of the received ARP packet based on the trusted IP-to-MAC mapping database. However, this database is either manually managed or dynamically managed through <b>DHCP</b> <b>snooping</b> [8]. In order to perform <b>DHCP</b> <b>snooping,</b> the port on which the network DHCP server is connected needs to be configured as a trusted interface, and other ports need to be configured as untrusted interfaces. However, this approach may not be effective, if the ARP cache poisoning occurs among the wireless nodes connected via the same AP. In this article, we attempt to devise a method to prevent ARP poisoning-based MITM attacks with minimal overhead of manual configuration by the network administrator or by the user, and with minimal infrastructure upgrade cost.|$|E
40|$|Address Resolution Protocol (ARP) cache {{spoofing}} or poisoning is an OSI layer 2 {{attack that}} exploits the statelessness {{vulnerability of the}} protocol to make network hosts susceptible to issues such as Man in the Middle attack, host impersonation, Denial of Service (DoS) and session hijacking. In this paper, a quantitative research approach is used to propose forensic tools for capturing evidences and mitigating ARP cache poisoning. The baseline approach is adopted to validate the proposed tools. The evidences captured before attack are compared against evidences captured when the network is under attack in order to ascertain {{the validity of the}} proposed tools in capturing ARP cache spoofing evidences. To mitigate the ARP poisoning attack, the security features <b>DHCP</b> <b>Snooping</b> and Dynamic ARP Inspection (DAI) are enabled and configured on a Cisco switch. The experimentation results showed the effectiveness of the proposed mitigation technique...|$|E
40|$|The {{design of}} complex Networks follows three layer architecture, which is {{scalable}} and provides redundant paths for data transmission. The layers include: Access Layer, Distribution Layer and Core Layer. Access layer devices {{are used to}} connect end devices on the same network and Distribution Layer uses multi layer switches, which provides features like redundant paths, link aggregation, access control lists, and quality of services(QOS). And Core layer devices transfers data {{as fast as possible}} to various networks without much delay. At Access layer, switches are used to connect multiple devices on the network. They are mainly vulnerable to attacks within the network by malicious users. Generally, networks are secured by using firewalls or implementing access control lists on a router. Routers or firewalls can prevent illegitimate traffic entering the network. But, they cannot prevent attacks within the network. Switches are vulnerable to attacks like MAC address flooding, DHCP starvation, <b>DHCP</b> <b>snooping,</b> denial-of-service and etc. In this paper I would like to provide necessary configuration required to protect network resources and also to give an insight to design networks, to improve throughput and reduce broadcast traffic. To address the above issues, a topology is designed using PACKET TRACER (network simulator) to demonstrate the vulnerabilities at access layer, and also shows the configuration required to protect the network from the above said attacks. Further, it also addresse...|$|E
