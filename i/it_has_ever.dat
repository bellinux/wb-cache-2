The 2017 result {{marks the first time}} since 1929 that Peterborough has voted Labour in an election where the Conservatives won the national popular vote, and the first time <b>it</b> <b>has</b> <b>ever</b> elected a Labour MP in a year in which Labour did not form the government. Furthermore, Peterborough became one of five constituencies, the others being Croydon Central, Enfield Southgate, Leeds North West and Reading East, which elected Labour MPs in 2017 having not done so since 2001.|$|E
5|$|Nerva was succeeded without {{incident}} by his adopted son Trajan, who {{was greeted by}} the Roman populace with much enthusiasm. According to Pliny the Younger, Trajan dedicated a temple in honour of Nerva, yet no trace of <b>it</b> <b>has</b> <b>ever</b> been found; nor was a commemorative series of coins for the Deified Nerva issued until ten years after his death. According to Cassius Dio, however, the Guard prefect responsible for the mutiny against Nerva, Casperius Aelianus, was 'dismissed' upon Trajan's accession.|$|E
5|$|On Columbia, Tucker ruffles a few {{feathers}} {{with his}} new team, and Captain Hernandez asks the reasons behind his transfer. Later, T'Pol and Tucker have a shared vision despite being on different ships. Enterprise locates a destroyed Rigelian ship, and while investigating, they are suddenly attacked and boarded. MACOs repel the attack and a captured alien is taken to Sickbay, where scanners show {{that he is in}} fact Klingon. Archer then discovers Reed's complicity in evidence tampering and confines him to the brig. Archer also learns that the boarders sabotaged the ship, and he orders maximum speed in order to prevent the warp core from overloading. The ship increases speed to , the fastest <b>it</b> <b>has</b> <b>ever</b> been.|$|E

5|$|The {{unusually large}} wind field uprooted many {{thousands}} of trees, downed many power lines, damaged hundreds of houses, and snapped thousands of telephone poles and cross arms. Hundreds of roads, including major highways, were blocked by fallen trees. An emergency evacuation shelter in Newport News reported minor wind damage. Two {{people in the region}} died due to falling trees—one in New Kent County and one in the city of Hopewell. Power outages left most traffic lights not working across Hampton Roads, resulting in multiple minor car accidents. Additionally, most gas stations were closed, due to power outages leaving the pumps unusable. Old Dominion University remained closed for two weeks due to storm damage and power issues, the longest <b>it</b> <b>has</b> <b>ever</b> been closed during a school term. Likewise, Norfolk State University, Regent University, Tidewater Community College and Eastern Virginia Medical School all experienced significant closing times due to both storm damage and a lack of electricity.|$|E
5|$|Another tradition, {{related by}} R.C. MacLeod, told of certain events {{which took place}} after an heir to the clan's chiefship was born. The story related how at this time, there was much rejoicing at Dunvegan Castle, and since the infant's nursemaid was anxious {{to join in the}} festivities in the hall below, she left the infant alone in her room. When the baby awoke, crying of cold, no human help could hear him in his secluded room; however, a host of fairies {{appeared}} and wrapped the infant in the Fairy Flag. Meanwhile, the clansmen banqueting below demanded to see the child and the maid was ordered to bring him forth. When she brought out the baby, wrapped in the flag, everyone gazed in wonder at the child and the garb wrapped around him. The room was filled with the fairies' song which declared that the flag had the power to save the clan three times. When the song ended, and silence fell across the crowded room, the flag was taken from the infant and locked in a chest where <b>it</b> <b>has</b> <b>ever</b> since been preserved.|$|E
5|$|Haakon {{employed}} {{an active}} and aggressive foreign policy towards strengthening Norwegian ties in the west. His policy relied on friendship and trade with the English king; the first known Norwegian trade agreements were made with England in the years 1217–23 (England's first commercial treaties were also made with Norway), and the friendship with Henry III of England was a cornerstone in Haakon's foreign policy. As they had become kings around the same time, Haakon wrote to Henry in 1224 that he wished they could maintain the friendship that had existed between their fathers. Haakon sought to defend the Norwegian sovereignty over the islands in the west, namely the Hebrides and Man (under the Kingdom of Mann and the Isles), Shetland and Orkney (under the Earldom of Orkney), and the Faroe Islands. Further, the Norse community in Greenland agreed {{to submit to the}} Norwegian king in 1261, and in 1262 Haakon achieved one of his long-standing ambitions when he managed to incorporate Iceland into his kingdom by utilising the island's internal conflicts in his favour. The dependency on Norwegian maritime trade and their subordination to the Nidaros ecclesiastical province were some of the key reasons which allowed Haakon to assert sovereignty over the islands. The Norwegian kingdom was at the largest <b>it</b> <b>has</b> <b>ever</b> been by the end of Haakon's reign.|$|E

25|$|In {{the forties}} {{of the twentieth}} century, Steven Corbet was deputy-keeper of the insect {{collection}} of the Natural History Museum. He {{was at that time}} also the foremost authority on the Linnean butterflies, and had access tot the collection of the Linnean Society. During research, Corbet found the specimen labelled Ajax in Linnaeus's own handwriting. From the way it was pinned, Corbet concluded that it was almost certainly a specimen collected by Pehr Osbeck in Canton in 1751, so not of North-American origin. Corbet at once identified the type as a specimen of the Oriental species named Papilio xuthus by Linnaeus in 1767, a name by which <b>it</b> <b>has</b> <b>ever</b> since been known.|$|E

25|$|Economic development, however, {{was only}} a part of Garcia Moreno’s plan for the new Ecuador; he above all sought to remake the nation into a shining example of a Catholic state. Garcia Moreno, while abroad, had {{witnessed}} the violence and chaos, as well as the uprooting of the Church’s spiritual authority, which revolutionary liberalism brought in the Revolutions of 1848, As a result, he became further committed to Catholic principles. The new constitution Garcia Moreno drafted in 1861 increased presidential power to allow for this, and his 1862 concordat with the Church gave it more power over Ecuador <b>it</b> <b>has</b> <b>ever</b> had before or since. Catholicism, in a new 1869 constitution, was made the state religion as well as the only legal faith. Garcia Moreno further strengthened the Church’s interests that same year by signing into effect legislation which outlawed secret societies such as the Freemasons, which those on the receiving end saw as a personal attack.|$|E
