5|$|Watney {{begins the}} 90-sol journey to Schiaparelli and the pre-positioned Ares IV MAV. To {{rendezvous}} with Hermes, Watney removes many components from the MAV, including the nose cone, to lighten it, {{replacing it with}} a piece of the Hab's canvas. As the MAV fails to reach the required speed and altitude, Lewis is forced to use maneuvering thrusters to change course and explosive decompression of Hermess internal atmosphere to reduce speed. When <b>even</b> <b>that</b> <b>is</b> not enough, Commander Lewis uses a Manned Maneuvering Unit, but still cannot reach Watney. Watney pierces the glove of his pressure suit and uses the escaping air to propel himself towards Lewis, effectively rescuing him after being alone for 560 Sols on Mars.|$|E
25|$|Lizzie also ends {{up going}} against her brother Charley's wishes, when {{she refuses to}} marry Bradley Headstone. He {{would have been an}} {{excellent}} match for her, according to norms of the time, however, Lizzie does not love him. She unselfishly does what others expect of her, doing things like helping Charley escape their father to go to school, and living with Jenny Wren. Marrying Wrayburn is the only truly selfish act Lizzie commits in Our Mutual Friend, and <b>even</b> <b>that</b> <b>is</b> debatable, since she only did it because Wrayburn appeared to be on his deathbed.|$|E
25|$|Job laments {{the day of}} his birth; {{he would}} like to die, but <b>even</b> <b>that</b> <b>is</b> denied to him. His three friends Eliphaz the Temanite, Bildad the Shuhite and Zophar the Naamathite, console him. The friends do not waver in their belief that Job's {{suffering}} is a punishment for sin, for God causes no one to suffer innocently, and they advise him to repent and seek God's mercy. Job responds with scorn: a just God would not treat him so harshly, patience in suffering is impossible, and the Creator should not take his creatures so lightly, to come against them with such force.|$|E

2500|$|Immediately {{before the}} filming of episode 68 ("The Girls Go Into Business") of I Love Lucy, Desi Arnaz, instead of his usual {{audience}} warm-up, told the audience about Lucy and her grandfather. Reusing the line he had first given to Hedda Hopper in an interview, he quipped: [...] "The only thing red about Lucy is her hair, and <b>even</b> <b>that</b> <b>is</b> not legitimate." ...|$|E
2500|$|The {{decision}} {{to give the}} National Book Foundation's annual award for [...] "distinguished contribution" [...] to Stephen King is extraordinary, another low in the shocking process of dumbing down our cultural life. I've described King {{in the past as}} a writer of penny dreadfuls, but perhaps <b>even</b> <b>that</b> <b>is</b> too kind. He shares nothing with Edgar Allan Poe. What he is is an immensely inadequate writer on a sentence-by-sentence, paragraph-by-paragraph, book-by-book basis.|$|E
2500|$|One way to {{work around}} this problem, which works well when complex records (such as in a {{relational}} database) are being sorted by a relatively small key field, {{is to create an}} index into the array and then sort the index, rather than the entire array. (A sorted version of the entire array can then be produced with one pass, reading from the index, but often <b>even</b> <b>that</b> <b>is</b> unnecessary, as having the sorted index is adequate.) [...] Because the index is much smaller than the entire array, it may fit easily in memory where the entire array would not, effectively eliminating the disk-swapping problem. This procedure is sometimes called [...] "tag sort".|$|E
6000|$|... "No, darling,--not this morning," [...] {{said the}} old man. He himself knew well enough {{that he would never}} play cat's-cradle again. <b>Even</b> <b>that</b> <b>was</b> over for him now.|$|R

60|$|It was half-past {{seven in}} the <b>evening,</b> <b>that</b> <b>is,</b> dinner time, and Morris stood in the study waiting for Stella, who had {{announced}} through the housemaid <b>that</b> she <b>was</b> coming down.|$|R
2500|$|In 1472 and 1473, Caron is {{mentioned}} by Loyset Compère alongside Guillaume Dufay, and stylistic {{similarities between the}} two composers suggests a relation. [...] In addition, one of Caron's masses appears in a Cambrai manuscript dated to 1472 or 1473, the year before Dufay's death there. [...] Caron {{may have been in}} Cambrai in the early 1470s and known Dufay, but <b>even</b> <b>that</b> <b>is</b> not certain. [...] References to Caron in writings by music theorists appear as late as 1556, in the writings of German Hermann Finck, [...] indicating the spread and duration of his reputation. [...] Johannes Tinctoris, whose writings are a rich source on 15th-century composers and music theory, extravagantly praises Caron's music, but also mentions that he was poorly educated.|$|E
2500|$|One {{consequence}} {{of this is that}} the target audience is extremely fluid: while some of his works are clearly published as children's literature (picture books, cassettes), the distinction between youth, young adult and adult literature is not easily made; traditional story-telling addresses the entire community at once. [...] The interplay of truth and fiction, always difficult concepts, is a recurring theme in Schami's writings. [...] Der ehrliche Lügner opens with the words: [...] "My name is Sadik, but not <b>even</b> <b>that</b> <b>is</b> certain." [...] Elsewhere we are told that the important thing is not whether stories are true, but rather how we live with them (A Handful of Stars). [...] Although elements from fairy-tale worlds may appear in these stories, they are always rooted in daily life. [...] Schami has made a distinction between Illusion and Phantasie (illusion and vision). [...] Illusion is an unachievable dream, distorting the world to something impossible, whereas vision is the imaginative construction of achievable goals; rooted in reality it indicates something which can be striven for, but this reality means also accepting the other possibility, that there may not be a happy ending. [...] Asked by a radio interviewer whether literature is an escape from reality, Schami answers, yes: but one which enables the reader to return to reality better equipped.|$|E

50|$|The sonata is incomplete, {{consisting}} {{of only a}} single movement, and <b>even</b> <b>that</b> <b>was</b> abandoned by the composer before completion. Other hands, such as Howard Ferguson and Noël Lee, have attempted to realise Schubert's assumed intentions.|$|R
