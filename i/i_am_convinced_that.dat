In Rapture Under Attack he wrote:I myself have been a forty-five year student of the satanically-inspired, centuries-old conspiracy to use government, education, and media to destroy every vestige of Christianity within our society and establish a new world order. Having read at least fifty books on the Illuminati, <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>convinced</b> <b>that</b> it exists and can be blamed for many of man's inhumane actions against his fellow man {{during the past two}} hundred years.|$|E
25|$|President Klaus Iohannis is a {{supporter}} of the fight against corruption in Romania. Since coming to power in November 2014, has sent several messages of support to prosecutors investigating sensitive cases against politicians accused of corruption. Making one of its important position was in February 25, 2016 {{at the annual meeting of}} the National Anticorruption Directorate: “From year to year the work of the National Anticorruption Directorate has become more effective as the number of cases investigated and complexity, as well as final decisions on confiscation and recovery of property from crime. You are a model of functional institution and created a performance standard. Through the work and achievements, you've earned the appreciation of the Romanian citizens who want to live in a just society, in a country without corruption, the institutions, elect to represent them and those who perform public functions are actually serving the people. The results obtained by you in fighting corruption, appreciated and beyond Romania's borders are a guarantee that the process of strengthening democracy and the rule of law in Romania are on track. <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>convinced</b> <b>that</b> we will be increasingly more powerful in applying the constitutional principle that nobody is above the law and to align our established practice in countries with democracies that put the citizen at the center of any policy”, stated Klaus Iohannis.|$|E
500|$|La Poype de Vertrieu {{wrote his}} report and {{recommendations}} for the refitting of Marseillois on 24 December 1779; he found her a passable ship, but her high poop hindered her sailing when running, and he recommended improvements to the gun ports of the castles, which were obstructed and allowed only two guns on the quarterdeck {{and one on the}} forecastle to be used. Furthermore, substantial repairs on the rigging were needed, and she needed her hull heated to kill worms. La Poype de Vertrieu wrote [...] "it appears that Marseillois shall never be an exceptional sailor, but <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>convinced</b> <b>that</b> she will give satisfaction".|$|E

I simply cannot understand how anyone can be in doubt of this. If you had seen her, <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>convinced</b> <b>that</b> you would recoil in horror at the thought that this frightful creature could be a daughter of our Tsar." [...] Other visitors, however, such as Felix Dassel, an officer whom Anastasia had visited in hospital during 1916, and Gleb Botkin, who had known Anastasia as a child and was Tatiana Melnik's brother, were convinced that Tschaikovsky was genuine.|$|E
500|$|Now {{my great}} plan, which was {{conceived}} of old, ... {{is to let}} nothing be wilfully left unexamined.

In May 1939, the Duke was {{commissioned}} by NBC to give a radio broadcast (his first since abdicating) {{during a visit to}} the battlefields of Verdun.

[...] The broadcast was heard across the world and by millions in America. It was widely seen as supporting appeasement, and the BBC refused to broadcast it. It was broadcast outside the United States on shortwave radio and was reported in full by British broadsheet newspapers.|$|E

500|$|As the {{new century}} began, Shaw became {{increasingly}} disillusioned by the limited impact of the Fabians on national politics. Thus, although a nominated Fabian delegate, he {{did not attend the}} London conference at the Memorial Hall, Farringdon Street in February 1900, that created the Labour Representation Committee—precursor of the modern Labour Party. By 1903, when his term as borough councillor expired, he had lost his earlier enthusiasm, writing: [...] "After six years of Borough Councilling <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>convinced</b> <b>that</b> the borough councils should be abolished". Nevertheless, in 1904 he stood in the London County Council elections. After an eccentric campaign, which Holroyd characterises as [...] " [...] absolutely certain of not getting in", he was duly defeated. It was Shaw's final foray into electoral politics. Nationally, the 1906 general election produced a huge Liberal majority and an intake of 29 Labour members. Shaw viewed this outcome with scepticism; he had a low opinion of the new prime minister, Sir Henry Campbell-Bannerman, and saw the Labour members as inconsequential: [...] "I apologise to the Universe for my connection with such a body".|$|E
500|$|With {{decreasing}} album {{sales and}} a lack of commercially successful singles, Cher decided to further develop her acting career. While she had previously aspired to venture into film, she had only the critically and commercially unsuccessful movies Good Times and Chastity to her credit, and the Hollywood establishment did not take her seriously as an actress. She moved to New York in 1982 to take acting lessons with Lee Strasberg, founder of the Actors Studio, but never enrolled after her plans changed. She auditioned for and was signed by director Robert Altman for the Broadway stage production Come Back to the Five and Dime, Jimmy Dean, Jimmy Dean, playing a member of a James Dean fan club holding a 20-year reunion. That year, Altman cast her again in the film adaptation of the same title. Cher credits Altman for launching her acting career: [...] "Without Bob [...] I would have never had a film career. Everyone told him not to cast me... <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>convinced</b> <b>that</b> Bob {{was the only one who}} was brave enough to do it." ...|$|E
500|$|The Guardian of Education was {{the first}} {{periodical}} to take the reviewing of children's books seriously. Trimmer's over four hundred reviews constituted a set of distinct and identifiable criteria regarding what was valuable in this new genre. As a high-church Anglican, she was intent on protecting Christianity from secularism as well as evangelicalism, particularly as the latter manifested itself in Methodism. Her reviews also reveal {{her to be a}} staunch monarchist and opponent of the French Revolution. As Grenby puts it, [...] "her initial questions of any children's books that came before her were always first, was it damaging to religion and second, was it damaging to political loyalty and the established social hierarchy". Religion was Trimmer's first priority and her emphasis on the doctrine of Biblical inerrancy illustrated her fundamentalism. She wrote to a friend: [...] "I will only say, that the more I reflect on the subject, the more <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>convinced</b> <b>that</b> it is not right to supersede the figurative style in which they speak of God and divine things, my opinion is, that whoever attempts to teach the truths of divine revelation, should follow the method of the inspired writers as nearly as possible" [...] For Trimmer, the truth of the Bible was not only in its content, but also in its style, and some of her harshest reviews were written against texts that altered both the style and the substance of the Bible.|$|E

500|$|After {{leaving the}} Sahara, Bodley spent {{three months in}} Java working on a tea plantation, before {{travelling}} to China and Japan. The success of Algeria from Within {{made it easy for}} him to obtain work as a journalist in Asia. He became a foreign correspondent for The Sphere in London and The Advertiser in Australia. Bodley was one of several westerners to be granted access to the South Pacific Mandate by Japan in the 1930s, and he has been cited as one of the main sources of information on the area at the time. The South Pacific Mandate consisted of islands in the north Pacific Ocean that had been within the German colonial empire until occupied by Japan during World War I; Japan governed the islands under a League of Nations mandate. Like other westerners allowed to visit the region, he reported that {{there was no evidence that}} Japan was militarising the area. Bodley's movements were [...] "carefully choreographed" [...] by the Japanese Foreign Ministry. He wrote about his experiences and findings in his 1934 book The Drama in the Pacific, saying that [...] "having visited practically every island … <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>convinced</b> <b>that</b> nothing has been done to convert any place into a naval base". In his 1998 book Nan'yo: the Rise and Fall of the Japanese in Micronesia, 1885–1945, Mark Peattie stated that while it is easy to accuse Bodley and the other writers of naivety, the militarisation of the area was complex and occurred in several stages. Bodley was a passenger aboard the ship Shizuoka Maru when it was wrecked on a reef north of Yap in April 1933. The vessel was lost, though there were no injuries. Bodley was offered a job teaching English at Keio University, and did so for nine months; he wrote about the experience in his 1933 book A Japanese Omelette. Bodley and Keio professor Eishiro Hori provided voluminous notes in the 1934 Japanese textbook version of Round the Red Lamp by Arthur Conan Doyle, and in 1935 Bodley published a biography of Tōgō Heihachirō.|$|E
