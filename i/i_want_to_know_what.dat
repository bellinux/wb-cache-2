2500|$|In 1945, Brando's agent {{recommended}} he take a co-starring role in The Eagle Has Two Heads with Tallulah Bankhead, {{produced by}} Jack Wilson. Bankhead had {{turned down the}} role of Blanche Dubois in A Streetcar Named Desire, which Williams had written for her, to tour the play for the 1946-1947 season. Bankhead recognized Brando's potential, despite her disdain (which most Broadway veterans shared) for method acting, and agreed to hire him even though he auditioned poorly. The two clashed greatly during the pre-Broadway tour, with Bankhead reminding Brando of his mother, being her age and also having a drinking problem. Wilson was largely tolerant of Brando's behavior, but he reached his limit when Brando mumbled through a dress rehearsal shortly before the November 28, 1946, opening. [...] "I don't care what your grandmother did," [...] Wilson exclaimed, [...] "and that Method stuff, <b>I</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>know</b> <b>what</b> you're going to do!" [...] Brando in turn raised his voice, and acted with great power and passion. [...] "It was marvelous," [...] a cast member recalled. [...] "Everybody hugged him and kissed him. He came ambling offstage and said to me, 'They don't think you can act unless you can yell.'" ...|$|E
