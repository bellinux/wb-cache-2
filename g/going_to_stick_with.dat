500|$|Trinity of Sin: Pandora #2 {{was given}} a 6 out of 10 by Newsarama's Richard Gray. He stated that [...] "despite the “Trinity War” tie-in banners, [...] {{scarcely}} essential reading for current DC fans" [...] adding that [...] "Pandora’s focus doesn’t appear to be as concerned with this bigger picture" [...] and the series {{requires a lot of}} backstory, only in its second issue. IGN's Jesse Schedeen gave the issue a 7.5 out of 10, commenting that [...] "Trinity of Sin: Pandora #2 improves on the first issue, but the series still lacks a clear, ongoing purpose" [...] and [...] "as a [...] "Trinity War" [...] tie-in, this is certainly a more compelling read than Constantine #5." [...] Doug Zawisza of Comic Book Resources gave the issue 2 stars out of 5, saying [...] "Trinity of Sin: Pandora #2 is an average comic book all the way around. It doesn't add much to the [...] "Trinity War" [...] story despite the logo on the cover and it certainly isn't <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>stick</b> <b>with</b> me until the next issue." ...|$|E
5000|$|On August 5, 1974, Richard Nixon {{released}} certain documents {{revealing his}} orders to aides to hinder the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) {{investigation of the}} Watergate break-in. When Landgrebe was asked on August 7 about the apparently unanimous support for impeachment of Nixon among his Republican colleagues following this disclosure, he said: [...] "I'm <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>stick</b> <b>with</b> my President even if he and I {{have to be taken}} out of this building and shot." [...] The next day, Richard Nixon announced his resignation. A few months later, Landgrebe was shown the door by his constituents. His re-election bid was derailed by Democrat Floyd Fithian.|$|E
5000|$|A sixth-place finish wasn't {{enough to}} deliver Gordon a fifth Sprint Cup Series championship. He said {{afterwards}} {{that he was}} [...] ""a little disappointed," [...] but all in all, {{a good way to}} go out. It doesn't mean I had to win a championship or even compete for a championship, but I wanted to win a race, at least. I wanted to show that I still had what it takes, and I think the Chase showed that. I'm extremely proud of my driving and our effort these last 10 races. That's something that's <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>stick</b> <b>with</b> {{me for a long time}} - in how I made the announcement and how we approached this season and how we finished it." ...|$|E

But," [...] he added, glaring at Wingate, [...] "remember this. Only {{half an hour}} before I was taken, Scotland Yard rang up to tell me that they thought they had a clue as to Stanley's disappearance. You risk five years' penal {{servitude}} by this freak." ...|$|R

5000|$|On {{her next}} appearance, Proud Spell was {{assigned}} top weight of 124 pounds, but nevertheless started odds-on favorite for the Grade II Cotillion Handicap at Philadelphia Park on September 20. After tracking the leaders she was bumped {{when attempting to}} make a forward move in the straight and finished second, {{two and a half}} lengths behind the winner Seattle Smooth. After the race Brereton Jones announced that the filly would be rested before probably returning in 2009. He said that Saez had been given [...] "a lesson in race riding" [...] by the other jockeys in the Cotillion but added [...] "I'm <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>stick</b> <b>with</b> him; he's a great kid and I think he's going to be a Hall of Fame jockey one day." ...|$|E
5000|$|Back at the cadets' barracks, {{tensions}} and emotions following Peoples' death began {{to reach the}} boiling point. Cadet Roberts has a heated exchange with cadet Lee on Major Joy's tactics, saying that Joy set out to break Peoples and killed him [...] "like putting a carbine to his head". Cadet Cappy - again letting his own self doubts creep back in - sides with Roberts against Lee, saying that he doesn't see any reason to continue on if Major Joy was <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>stick</b> <b>with</b> his attempts to break them as well. Cadet Lee fired back, saying that Major Joy's gameplan was to make them quit, and that he wasn't falling for it. He emphatically said that he wasn't going to let Major Joy, anyone else at the base, or [...] "the God damned Commander-In-Chief himself" [...] stop him from his dreams of flying.|$|E
5000|$|In {{reviewing}} the release, Chris Jones wrote, [...] "Ubuntu 15.10 as an operating system for Review is pretty lackluster. There's nothing new as such and there's {{nothing we can}} really say {{that is going to}} change your opinion from its predecessor, 15.04. Therefore, we recommend you to upgrade either out of habit and according to your regular upgrade schedule rather than out of a specific necessity for a specific feature of this release. Because there is really nothing that could possibly differentiate it from the older, yet still very stable 15.04 release. But if you're <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>stick</b> <b>with</b> 15.04 for a little longer, we do recommend that you look at upgrading the kernel to the latest 4.2 branch. It is worth it. If you really want a reason to upgrade? Linux kernel 4.2 would be our sole reason for taking Ubuntu 15.10 into consideration." ...|$|E

5000|$|Ladyhawke {{revealed}} that the album was propelled by the stress of writing and recording new music {{after two years of}} touring: [...] "I love having a fire in my belly. That was something that I had because I was really scared about disappointing people, and I knew I was going to go in a different direction. I wasn't <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>stick</b> <b>with</b> the same vibe that I had on the first album. I was really, really excited and keen to try something new {{but at the same time}} as taking that on I knew I might be disappointing some people. Trying to do my best under those circumstances was motivating." [...] She added that the album is called Anxiety [...] "because every song has that sort of feeling, my mindset throughout the recording was a mixture of being so tired and just being worried the whole time. I'm a walking ball of anxiety. It completely sums up the album." ...|$|E
5000|$|When {{asked in}} a September 2013 {{interview}} if Testament had any ideas for the follow-up to Dark Roots of Earth, Billy stated Testament would begin writing and recording the album from January to April 2014 for release later that year. He added that the band was in the [...] "right direction" [...] with Dark Roots of Earth, and added [...] "I think that the old saying 'if it's not broken, don't fix it' fits, so we're probably <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>stick</b> <b>with</b> the same formula and idea. I think that there isn't any Testament album that sounds the same, so who knows what kind of songs we'll write next year...I don't know." [...] However, these plans fell through, {{when it was announced}} in January 2014 that bassist Greg Christian had left Testament for the second time, citing differences with the band and money disputes as the reasons. Christian was replaced by Steve DiGiorgio, who was the bassist for Testament from 1998 to 2004.|$|E

5000|$|In {{his first}} game with the Eagles, Sturgis missed a 30-yard field goal attempt and an extra point attempt, which could have turned the {{scoreboard}} {{in favor of the}} Eagles as they went on to lose 23-20 to the Washington Redskins. After the game Sturgis took responsibility, saying [...] "the rest of the team gave such a good effort today. They played so well. It's tough knowing I didn't do my part. I just went out there and missed. Hurt the team. It's on me." [...] After the game, head coach Chip Kelly decided Sturgis is better than anyone else they could sign. [...] "We looked at what's out there," [...] Kelly said. [...] "I think the state of kicking in the league now is not very good. There's been a lot of changes. ...We feel in terms of what's available out there, we're <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>stick</b> <b>with</b> Caleb." [...] In his second game with the Eagles, Sturgis missed another extra point, but was able to make all four of his field goals including one that broke a 7-7 second-quarter tie in a 39-17 victory over the New Orleans Saints. However, Kelly did not show much confidence in his kicker as he went for it two times on 4th and long early in the game.|$|E
