5|$|An {{application}} that has almost {{fallen out of}} use {{with the introduction of}} affordable superconducting magnets <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>use</b> <b>of</b> europium complexes, such as Eu(fod)3, as shift reagents in NMR spectroscopy. Chiral shift reagents, such as Eu(hfc)3, are still used to determine enantiomeric purity.|$|E
5|$|Dual {{protection}} <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>use</b> <b>of</b> {{methods that}} prevent both sexually transmitted infections and pregnancy. This {{can be with}} condoms either alone or along with another birth control method or by the avoidance of penetrative sex.|$|E
5|$|One major {{limitation}} to {{a forensic}} investigation <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>use</b> <b>of</b> encryption; this disrupts initial examination where pertinent evidence might be located using keywords. Laws to compel individuals to disclose encryption keys are still relatively new and controversial.|$|E
25|$|More {{unconventional}} <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>use</b> <b>of</b> a backbone chassis and four-wheel independent suspension.|$|R

5|$|Reconfigurable {{computing}} <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>use</b> <b>of</b> a field-programmable {{gate array}} (FPGA) as a co-processor to a general-purpose computer. An FPGA is, in essence, a computer chip that can rewire itself for a given task.|$|E
5|$|Snow {{camouflage}} <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>use</b> <b>of</b> a coloration or {{pattern for}} effective camouflage in winter, often {{combined with a}} different summer camouflage. Summer patterns are typically disruptively patterned combinations of shades of browns and greys, up to black, while winter patterns are dominated by white to match snowy landscapes.|$|E
5|$|A classic {{error is}} {{the attempt to}} use the equals {{operator}} = {{in combination with the}} keyword NULL to find rows with Nulls. According to the SQL standard this is an invalid syntax and shall lead to an error message or an exception. But most implementations accept the syntax and evaluate such expressions to UNKNOWN. The consequence is that no rows are found - regardless of whether rows with Nulls exist or not. The proposed way to retrieve rows with Nulls <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>use</b> <b>of</b> the predicate IS NULL instead of = NULL.|$|E
25|$|Another rare feature <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>use</b> <b>of</b> {{decorative}} braiding {{around the}} sleeve cuffs and lapel edges.|$|R

50|$|General {{methods used}} in chiral pool {{synthesis}} <b>are</b> <b>the</b> <b>use</b> <b>of</b> protecting groups, and functional group interconversion (FGI).|$|R
5|$|A feature {{coming into}} wide use in modern shortwave {{receivers}} is DSP technology, short for digital signal processing. DSP <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>use</b> <b>of</b> digital means to process signals, and a primary benefit in shortwave receivers {{is the ability}} to tailor the bandwidth of the receiver to current reception conditions and to the type of signal being listened to. A typical analog-only receiver may have a limited number of fixed bandwidths, or only one, but a DSP receiver may have 40 or more individually selectable filters.|$|E
5|$|A variant on {{this design}} <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>use</b> <b>of</b> arrays, whose tilt angle can be {{adjusted}} twice or four times annually to optimise seasonal output. They also require more land area to reduce internal shading at the steeper winter tilt angle. Because the increased output is typically only a few percent, it seldom justifies the increased cost and complexity of this design.|$|E
5|$|According to the {{economic}} theory behind congestion pricing, {{the objective of this}} policy <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>use</b> <b>of</b> the price mechanism to make users more aware of the costs that they impose upon one another when consuming during the peak demand, and that they should pay for the additional congestion they create, thus encouraging the redistribution of the demand in space or in time, or shifting it to the consumption of a substitute public good; for example, switching from private transport to public transport.|$|E
25|$|Other methods <b>of</b> position-keeping <b>are</b> <b>the</b> <b>use</b> <b>of</b> {{an anchor}} spread and <b>the</b> <b>use</b> <b>of</b> a jack-up barge. All {{have their own}} {{advantages}} and disadvantages.|$|R
50|$|Characteristics <b>of</b> these choirs <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>use</b> <b>of</b> chest {{register}} singing (particularly in Eastern Ukraine) and <b>the</b> <b>use</b> <b>of</b> Ukrainian folk {{instruments in}} the accompanying orchestras.|$|R

5|$|Aluminium-doped ZnO layers {{are used}} as {{transparent}} electrodes. The constituents Zn and Al are much cheaper and less toxic compared to the generally used indium tin oxide (ITO). One application which {{has begun to be}} commercially available <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>use</b> <b>of</b> ZnO as the front contact for solar cells or of liquid crystal displays.|$|E
5|$|Apple {{trees are}} {{susceptible}} {{to a number of}} fungal and bacterial diseases and insect pests. Many commercial orchards pursue a program of chemical sprays to maintain high fruit quality, tree health, and high yields. A trend in orchard management <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>use</b> <b>of</b> organic methods. These prohibit the use of synthetic pesticides, though some older pesticides are allowed. Organic methods include, for instance, introducing its natural predator to reduce the population of a particular pest.|$|E
5|$|As {{with its}} spiritual predecessor, the {{environment}} of the game {{takes the form of a}} series of isometric flip-screen rooms (which trace the outline of a large starship). There are a total of 129 rooms and most are filled with various objects, such as moveable platforms, static hazards such as spikes and hostile aliens. As well as executing well-timed manoeuvres and jumps, the player is able to use starship props to block or defend themselves. Another feature <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>use</b> <b>of</b> remote controlled drones, which can be directed by Alien 8 into inaccessible or dangerous areas.|$|E
50|$|Also criticised <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>use</b> <b>of</b> state-funded {{money for}} paying towards his villa and second home in Altona (which cost around 1.2 million Euros).|$|R
30|$|The {{inclusion}} {{criterion for}} <b>the</b> current study <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>use</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> IRF or the TSF for any gradual deformity correction {{in the lower}} limb.|$|R
50|$|A novel {{feature of}} the spacecraft's reentry module <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>use</b> <b>of</b> a natural material, {{impregnated}} oak, as the ablative material for its heat shield.|$|R
5|$|Because {{of their}} size, shape, and {{well-defined}} chemical structures, viruses {{have been used}} as templates for organising materials on the nanoscale. Recent examples include work at the Naval Research Laboratory in Washington, D.C., using Cowpea mosaic virus (CPMV) particles to amplify signals in DNA microarray based sensors. In this application, the virus particles separate the fluorescent dyes used for signalling to prevent the formation of non-fluorescent dimers that act as quenchers. Another example <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>use</b> <b>of</b> CPMV as a nanoscale breadboard for molecular electronics.|$|E
5|$|Cadmium-selective sensors {{based on}} the {{fluorophore}} BODIPY {{have been developed for}} imaging and sensing of cadmium in cells. One of the most popular way to monitor cadmium in aqueous environments <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>use</b> <b>of</b> electrochemistry, one example is by attaching a self-assembled monolayer that can help obtain a cadmium selective electrode with a ppt-level sensitivity.|$|E
5|$|Central to the {{structure}} and plot of the show <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>use</b> <b>of</b> electronic surveillance and wiretap technologies by the policeâ€”hence the title The Wire. Salon.com described the title {{as a metaphor for}} the viewer's experience: the wiretaps provide the police with access to a secret world, just as the show does for the viewer. Simon has discussed the use of camera shots of surveillance equipment, or shots that appear to be taken from the equipment itself, to emphasize the volume of surveillance in modern life and the characters' need to sift through this information.|$|E
50|$|Also of {{interest}} in <b>the</b> project <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>use</b> <b>of</b> a structured-light 3D scanner to obtain the 3D shape and position of the parts being manipulated.|$|R
50|$|Arguably, one {{combined}} intercept and jamming technique <b>of</b> WWI <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>use</b> <b>of</b> shotguns against carrier pigeons, {{followed by}} reading the message attached to the bird.|$|R
25|$|Less {{fraught with}} controversy, however, may <b>be</b> <b>the</b> <b>use</b> <b>of</b> {{deceptive}} practices {{by those who}} employ conjuring techniques for personal gain outside the venue of a magic performance.|$|R
5|$|Classically, {{metabolism}} is {{studied by}} a reductionist approach {{that focuses on}} a single metabolic pathway. Particularly valuable <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>use</b> <b>of</b> radioactive tracers at the whole-organism, tissue and cellular levels, which define the paths from precursors to final products by identifying radioactively labelled intermediates and products. The enzymes that catalyze these chemical reactions can then be purified and their kinetics and responses to inhibitors investigated. A parallel approach is to identify the small molecules in a cell or tissue; the complete set of these molecules is called the metabolome. Overall, these studies give {{a good view of}} the structure and function of simple metabolic pathways, but are inadequate when applied to more complex systems such as the metabolism of a complete cell.|$|E
5|$|Despite heavy fishing {{pressure}} {{within its}} range, the cloudy catshark remains common, {{perhaps because it}} may be more biologically productive than most other sharks. As a result, it has been assessed as Least Concern by the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN). Cloudy catsharks from a number of locations off Japan {{have been found to be}} contaminated with polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) and dichlorodiphenyldichloroethylene (DDEs), which they acquire from their food. One likely source of these pollutants <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>use</b> <b>of</b> the pesticide DDT by developing nations in southern Asia.|$|E
5|$|During the {{processing}} of bauxite to alumina in the Bayer process, gallium accumulates in the sodium hydroxide liquor. From this it can be extracted {{by a variety of}} methods. The most recent <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>use</b> <b>of</b> ion-exchange resin. Achievable extraction efficiencies critically depend on the original concentration in the feed bauxite. At a typical feed concentration of 50 ppm, about 15 % of the contained gallium is extractable. The remainder reports to the red mud and aluminium hydroxide streams. Gallium is removed from the ion-exchange resin in solution. Electrolysis then gives gallium metal. For semiconductor use, it is further purified with zone melting or single-crystal extraction from a melt (Czochralski process). Purities of 99.9999% are routinely achieved and commercially available.|$|E
30|$|Two {{practical}} applications of <b>the</b> forecast data <b>are</b> now considered. These <b>are</b> <b>the</b> <b>use</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> {{data in a}} peak demand reduction application and a periodic optimization application.|$|R
