60|$|The {{debates of}} the House of Lords must tell what {{followed}} afterwards in the dreary history of Lady Clara Pulleyn. The proceedings in the Newcome Divorce Bill filled the usual number of columns in the papers,--especially the Sunday papers. The witnesses were examined by learned peers whose business--nay, pleasure--it {{seems to be}} to enter into such matters; and, for the ends of justice and morality, doubtless, the whole story of Barnes Newcome's household was told to the British public. In the previous trial in the Court of Queen's Bench, how grandly Serjeant Rowland stood up for the rights of British husbands! with what pathos he depicted the conjugal paradise, the innocent children prattling round their happy parents, the serpent, the destroyer, entering into that Belgravian Eden; the wretched and deserted husband alone by his desecrated hearth, and calling for redress on his country! Rowland wept freely during his noble harangue. At not a shilling under twenty thousand pounds would he estimate the cost of his client's injuries. The jury was very much affected: the evening papers gave Rowland's address <b>in</b> <b>extenso,</b> with some pretty sharp raps at the aristocracy in general. The Day, the principal morning journal of that period, came out with a leading article the next morning, in which every party concerned and every institution was knocked about. The disgrace of the peerage, the ruin of the monarchy (with a retrospective view of the well-known case of Gyges and Candaules), the monstrosity of the crime, and the absurdity of the tribunal and the punishment, were all set forth in the terrible leading article of the Day.|$|E
6000|$|It {{may have}} been {{observed}} that Shelley, whenever he speaks of critical depreciation of Keats, refers only to one periodical, the Quarterly Review: probably he did not distinctly know of any other: {{but the fact is}} that Blackwood's Magazine was worse than the Quarterly. The latter was sneering and supercilious: Blackwood was vulgarly taunting and insulting, and seems to have provoked Keats the more of the two, though perhaps he considered the attack in the Quarterly to be more detrimental to his literary standing. The Quarterly notice is of so much import in the life and death of Keats, and in the genesis of Adonais, that I shall give it, practically <b>in</b> <b>extenso,</b> before closing this section of my work: with Blackwood I can deal at once. A series of articles On the Cockney School of Poetry began in this magazine in October, 1817, being directed mainly and very venomously against Leigh Hunt. No. 4 of the series appeared in August, 1818, falling foul of Keats. It is difficult to say whether the priority in abusing Keats should of right be assigned to Blackwood or to the Quarterly: the critique in the latter review belongs to the number for April, 1818, but this number was not actually issued until September. The writer of the Blackwood papers signed himself Z. Z. is affirmed to have been Lockhart, the son-in-law of Sir Walter Scott, and afterwards editor of the Quarterly Review: more especially the article upon Keats is attributed to Lockhart. A different account, as to the series in general, is that the author was John Wilson (Christopher North), revised by Mr. William Blackwood. But Z. resisted more than one vigorous challenge to unmask, and some doubt as to his identity may still remain. Here are some specimens of the amenity with which Keats was treated in Blackwood's Magazine:-- ...|$|E

60|$|This book {{is only an}} uncomfortably large note-book; {{and it has the}} disadvantages, {{whether or}} no it has the advantages, of notes that were taken on the spot. Owing to the {{unexpected}} distraction of other duties, the notes were published in a newspaper as they were made on the spot; and are now reproduced in a book as they were published in the newspaper. The only exception refers to the last chapter on Zionism; and even there the book only reverts to the original note-book. A difference of opinion, which divided the writer of the book from the politics of the newspaper, prevented the complete publication of that chapter in that place. I recognise that any expurgated form of it would have falsified the proportions of my attempt to do justice in a very difficult problem; but on re-reading even my own attempt <b>in</b> <b>extenso,</b> I am far from satisfied that the proper proportions are kept. I wrote these first impressions in Palestine, where everybody recognises the Jew as something quite distinct from the Englishman or the European; and where his unpopularity even moved me in the direction of his defence. But I admit it was something of a shock to return to a conventional atmosphere, in which that unpopularity is still actually denied or described as mere persecution. It was more of a shock to realise that this most obscurantist of all types of obscurantism is still sometimes regarded as a sort of liberalism. To talk of the Jews always as the oppressed and never as the oppressors is simply absurd; it is as if men pleaded for reasonable help for exiled French aristocrats or ruined Irish landlords, and forgot that the French and Irish peasants had any wrongs at all. Moreover, the Jews in the West do not seem so much concerned to ask, as I have done however tentatively here, whether a larger and less local colonial development might really transfer the bulk of Israel to a more independent basis, as simply to demand that Jews shall continue to control other nations as well as their own. It might be worth while for England to take risks to settle the Jewish problem; but not to take risks merely to unsettle the Arab problem, and leave the Jewish problem unsolved.|$|E

They all know what I have said is true, but that will be nothing to the purpose if they are desired to consider it as false.

As for myself, I was quite prepared for my share of displeasure. It is very curious that I should have foreseen all this so distinctly as far back as 17th February. Nobody at least can plague me for interest with Lord Melville as they used to do. By the way, from the tone of his letter, I think his lordship will give up the measure, and I will be the peace-offering.

Not being very cleever, as John Fraser used to say, at these pedigree matters, referred him to Mrs. Dr. Russell and Robt. Rutherford.

Very odd--when there is a vacant or dormant title in a Scottish family or name, everybody, and all connected with the clan, conceive they have quodam modo a right to it. Not being engrossed by any individual, it communicates part of its lustre to every individual in the tribe, as if it remained in common stock for that purpose.|$|E

The deputy obeyed the mandate by looking over into the crowd behind the jury, and saying, in an audible tone, [...] "You'd better dry up thar, Joe White, or git out o' that!"

6000|$|... [The {{story of}} the [...] "Pirates of Barataria," [...] which an American print, the National Intelligencer, {{was the first to}} make public, is quoted <b>in</b> <b>extenso</b> by the Weekly Messenger (published at Boston) of November 4, 1814. It is {{remarkable}} that a tale which was destined to pass into the domain of historical romance should have been instantly seized upon and turned to account by Byron, whilst it was as yet half-told, while the legend was still in the making. Jean Lafitte, the Franco-American Conrad, was born either at Bayonne or Bordeaux, circ. 1780, emigrated with his elder brother Pierre, and settled at New Orleans, in 1809, as a blacksmith. Legitimate trade was flat, but the delta of the Mississippi, with its labyrinth of creeks and islands and bayous, teemed with pirates or merchant-smugglers. Accordingly, under the nominal sanction of letters of marque from the Republic of Cartagena, and as belligerents of Spain, the brothers, who had taken up their quarters on Grande Terre, an island to the east of the [...] "Grand Pass," [...] or channel of the Bay of Barataria, swept the Gulph of Mexico with an organised flotilla of privateers, and acquired vast booty in the way of specie and living cargoes of claves. Hence the proclamation of the Governor of Louisiana, W. C. C. Claiborne, in which (November 24, 1813) he offered a sum of $500 for the capture of Jean Lafitte. For the sequel of this first act of the drama the [...] "American newspaper" [...] is the sole authority. The facts, however, if facts they be, which are pieced together by Charles Étienne Arthur Gayarré, in the History of Louisiana (1885, iv. 301, sq.), and in two articles contributed to the American Magazine of History, October and November, 1883, are as curious and romantic as the legend. It would appear that early in September, 1814, a British officer, Colonel E. Nicholls, made overtures to Jean Lafitte, offering him the rank of captain in the British army, a grant of lands, and a sum of $30,000 if he would join forces with the British squadron then engaged in an attack on the coast of Louisiana. Lafitte begged for time to consider Colonel Nicholls's proposal, but immediately put himself in communication with Claiborne, offering, on condition of immunity for past offences, to place his resources at the disposal of the United States. Claiborne's reply to this patriotic offer seems to have been to despatch a strong naval force, under Commander Daniel Patterson, with orders to exterminate the pirates, and seize their fort on Grande Terre; and, on this occasion, though the brothers escaped, the authorities were successful. A proclamation was issued by General Andrew Jackson, in which the pirates were denounced as [...] "hellish banditti," [...] and, to all appearances, their career was at an end. But circumstances were in their favour, and a few weeks later Jackson not only went back on his own mandate, but accepted the alliance and services of the brothers Lafitte and their captains at the siege of New Orleans, January 8, 1815. Finally, when peace with Great Britain was concluded, President Madison publicly acknowledged the [...] "unequivocal traits of courage and fidelity" [...] which had been displayed by the brothers Lafitte, and the once proscribed band of outlaws. Thenceforth Pierre Lafitte disappears from history; but Jean is believed to have settled first at Galveston, in Texas, and afterwards, in 1820, on the coast of Yucatan, whence [...] "he continued his depredations on Spanish commerce." [...] He died game, a pirate to the last, in 1826. See, for what purports to be documentary evidence of the correspondence between Colonel E. Nicholls and Jean Lafitte, Historical Memoirs of the War in West Florida and Louisiana, by Major A. La Carriére Latour, 1816, Appendix III. pp. vii.-xv. See, too, Fernando de Lemos (an historical novel), by Charles Gayarré, 1872, pp. 347-361.] ...|$|E
60|$|The {{necessity}} of some provision corresponding to this was felt {{even in the}} Athenian Democracy, where, {{in the time of}} its most complete ascendancy, the popular Ecclesia could pass psephisms (mostly decrees on single matters of policy), but laws, so called, could only be made or altered by a different and less numerous body, renewed annually, called the Nomothetæ, whose duty it also was to revise the whole of the laws, and keep them consistent with one another. In the English Constitution there is great difficulty in introducing any arrangement which is new both in form and in substance, but comparatively little repugnance is felt to the attainment of new purposes by an adaptation of existing forms and traditions. It appears to me that the means might be devised of enriching the Constitution with this great improvement through the machinery of the House of Lords. A commission for preparing bills would in itself be no more an innovation on the Constitution than the Board for the administration of the Poor Laws, or the Inclosure Commission. If, in consideration of the great importance and dignity of the trust, it were made a rule that every person appointed a member of the Legislative Commission, unless removed from office on an address from Parliament, should be a peer for life, it is probable that the same good sense and taste which leave the judicial functions of the peerage practically to the exclusive care of the law lords would leave the business of legislation, except on questions involving political principles and interests, to the professional legislators; that bills originating in the Upper House would always be drawn up by them; that the government would devolve on them the framing of all its bills; and that private members of the House of Commons would gradually find it convenient, and likely to facilitate the passing of their measures through the two houses, if, instead of bringing in a bill and submitting it directly to the house, they obtained leave to introduce it and have it referred to the Legislative Commission; for it would, of course, be open to the House to refer for the consideration of that body not a subject merely, but any specific proposal, or a Draft of a Bill <b>in</b> <b>extenso,</b> when any member thought himself capable of preparing one such as ought to pass; and the House would doubtless refer every such draft to the commission, if only as materials, and {{for the benefit of the}} suggestions it might contain, as they would, in like manner, refer every amendment or objection which might be proposed in writing by any member of the House after a measure had left the commissioners' hands. The alteration of bills by a committee of the whole House would cease, not by formal abolition, but by desuetude; the right not being abandoned, but laid up in the same armoury with the royal veto, the right of withholding the supplies, and other ancient instruments of political warfare, which no one desires to see used, but no one likes to part with, lest they should any time be found to be still needed in an extraordinary emergency. By such arrangements as these, legislation would assume its proper place as a work of skilled labor and special study and experience; while the most important liberty of the nation, that of being governed only by laws assented to by its elected representatives, would be fully preserved, and made more valuable by being detached from the serious, but by no means unavoidable drawbacks which now accompany it in the form of ignorant and ill-considered legislation.|$|E
6000|$|I am honoured by {{the request}} made {{on your behalf}} by the Lord High [...] Chancellor of your kingdom that I should make a {{literary}} contribution [...] to the volume which my cousin, Queen Teuta, is, {{with the help of}} your [...] former governess, Miss MacKelpie, compiling. I am willing to do so, [...] as you naturally wish to have in that work some contemporary record [...] made by the Head of the House of Melton, with which you are [...] connected, though only on the distaff side. It is a natural ambition [...] enough, even {{on the part of a}} barbarian--or perhaps [...] semi-barbarian--King, and far be it from me, as Head of the House, to [...] deny you such a coveted privilege. Perhaps you may not know that I [...] am now Head of the House; my father died three days ago. I offered [...] my mother the use of the Dower House--to the incumbency of which, [...] indeed, she is entitled by her marriage settlement. But she [...] preferred to go to live at her seat, Carfax, in Kent. She went this [...] morning after the funeral. In letting you have the use of my [...] manuscript I make only one stipulation, but that I expect to be [...] rigidly adhered to. It is that all that I have written be put in the [...] book <b>in</b> <b>extenso.</b> I do not wish any record of mine to be garbled to [...] suit other ends than those ostensible, or whatever may be to the [...] honour of myself or my House to be burked. I dare say you have [...] noticed, my dear Rupert, that the compilers of family histories [...] often, through jealousy, alter matter that they are allowed to use so [...] as to suit their own purpose or minister to their own vanity. I [...] think it right to tell you that I have had a certified copy made by [...] Petter and Galpin, the law stationers, so that I shall be able to [...] verify whether my stipulation has been honourably observed. I am [...] having the book, which is naturally valuable, carefully packed, and [...] shall have it forwarded to Sir Edward Bingham Trent, Baronet (which [...] he now is--Heaven save the mark!), the Attorney. Please see that he [...] returns it to me, and in proper order. He is not to publish for [...] himself anything in it about him. A man of that class is apt to [...] advertise the fact of anyone of distinction taking any notice of him. [...] I would bring out the MS. to you myself, and stay for a while with [...] you for some sport, only your lot--subjects I suppose you call [...] them!--are such bounders that a gentleman's life is hardly safe [...] amongst them. I never met anyone who had so poor an appreciation of [...] a joke as they have. By the way, how is Teuta? She is one of them. [...] I heard all about the hatching business. I hope the kid is all [...] right. This is only a word in your ear, so don't get cocky, old son. [...] I am open to a godfathership. Think of that, Hedda! Of course, if [...] the other godfather and the godmother are up to the mark; I don't [...] want to have to boost up the whole lot! Savvy? Kiss Teuta and the [...] kid for me. I must have the boy over here for a bit later on--when [...] he is presentable, and has learned not to be a nuisance. It will be [...] good for him to see something of a real first-class English country [...] house like Humcroft. To a person only accustomed to rough ways and [...] meagre living its luxury will make a memory which will serve in time [...] as an example to be aimed at. I shall write again soon. Don't [...] hesitate to ask any favour which I may be able to confer on you. So [...] long! ...|$|E
