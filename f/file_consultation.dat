40|$|Abstract: PEComas, {{occasionally}} {{associated with}} the tuberous sclerosis complex, are defined {{by the presence of}} perivascular epithelioid cells that coexpress muscle and melanocytic markers. This family of tumors includes angiomyolipoma (AML), clear cell sugar tumor of the lung (CCST), lymphangioleiomyomatosis (LAM), and very rare tumors in other locations. Because non-AML/non-LAM PEComas are extremely rare and their natural history and prognostic features undefined, we present our experience with 26 PEComas of soft tissue and the gynecologic tract, the largest series to date. We also performed a detailed review of the literature, with special attention to features predictive of clinical behavior.

Although important {{for the assessment of}} the burden of leptospirosis, data on the duration of the illness and the occurrence of post-leptospirosis complaints are not well documented. Hence the main objective {{of this study was to}} estimate the occurrence of persistent complaints and duration of hospital stay in laboratory confirmed leptospirosis patients in the Netherlands during 1985 to 2010. Additionally, several risk factors potentially impacting on the occurrence of post-leptospirosis complaints were investigated. Methods/Principal Findings: The duration of the acute phase of leptospirosis was 16 days (IQR 12 – 23); 10 days (IQR 7 – 16) were spent hospitalized. Eighteen fatal cases were excluded from this analysis. Complaints of leptospirosis patients by passive case investigations (CPC) derived from <b>files</b> on ambulant <b>consultations</b> occurring one month after hospital discharge, revealed persistent complaints in 108 of 236 (45. 8 %) laboratory confirmed cases.

So far, there have been very few reports of LAM in Taiwan. Methods: Data on all patients with a clinical or pathological diagnosis of LAM inChang Gung Memorial Hospital from 1990 to 2001 were collected from thepathology <b>files</b> or by <b>consultation</b> with thoracic surgeons, chest physicians,and radiologists of this institution. Cases were confirmed by lung biopsy andhigh-resolution computed tomographic scanning. Clinical data were obtainedfrom patients' charts. Additional immunostaining for HMB- 45 antigen, estrogenreceptor, and progesterone receptor was carried out for cases with availableparaffin blocks. Results: In total, 10 patients confirmed with a diagnosis of LAM and adequate clinicalfollow-up information were found from 1991 to 2001. All were femalesof fertility age.

Of 277 PTCL-NOS cases recorded in our <b>consultation</b> <b>files,</b> we examined the clinicopathologic characteristics of 10 patients with T-cell lymphomas composed of small-sized cells with slight nuclear atypia. Eight patients showed extranodal involvement (5 patients, spleen; 3 patients, thyroid), and 5 patients were at clinical stage I or II. Histologically, all samples presented diffuse infiltrate of small lymphoid cells, with few mitotic figures. Immunohistologically, all samples were positive for CD 3, and CD: 20 Was detected in 5 samples. All samples showed a low Ki- 67 labeling index (mean, 1. 05 %), and 7 samples were positive for central memory T-cell markers. Clonal T-cell receptor gamma chain and/or alpha-beta chain gene rearrangements were detected in all 10 patients. Five patients received chemotherapy, whereas for 3 patients, treatment consisted only of observation following surgical resection of the spleen or thyroid. Nine patients were alive at a median follow-up time of 19. 5 months, whereas 1 patient died of an unrelated disease. The present study strongly indicates that T-cell lymphoma with small-sized lymphoma cells and a low Ki- 67 labeling index is a distinct variant.

40|$|In Japan, {{the term}} {{domestic}} violence (DV) refers generally to violence {{between men and}} women in intimate relationships, including spouses and lovers. DV-related <b>consultations</b> <b>filed</b> at spousal violence counseling and support centers have steadily increased in recent years. Support for victims of domestic violence in Japan is provided at women’s consulting offices, women’s protection facilities, maternal and child living support facilities, and shelters operated by NPOs. However, despite progress in developing measures to support DV victims, it is not always clear how the services provided by these institutions relate to social work theory and practices. This manuscript aims to analyze preceding research on this unclear relationship and to discuss the factors responsible. The review first summarizes how support for victims of domestic violence currently operates in Japan. Next, it organizes the findings of previous studies on the unclear relationship of DV victim support with social work theory and practices despite the progressive implementation of various DV-related policies. Finally, the author analyzes three kinds of problems responsible for this state of affairs―legal issues, support worker awareness,and establishment of support methods―and discusses factors contributing to them. Furthermore, the author demonstrates how the lack of clarity surrounding the relationship between DV victim support and social work is the result of interaction between multiple factors, and that society needs to develop and expand DV support policies and practices based on the history of this problem. The paper concludes with a consideration of themes to be taken up by future studies...|$|R
40|$|BACKGROUND: To {{meet the}} needs of female {{adolescents}} from low-income urban areas for sexual and reproductive health (SRH) care, vouchers providing free-of-charge access to SRH care at 19 primary care clinics were distributed in Managua, Nicaragua. These vouchers substantially increased the use of services, demonstrating that many adolescents are willing to use such services, if readily accessible. The voucher redemption made it possible to identify the nature of existing, but largely unmet, needs for SRH care. METHOD: The medical <b>files</b> from 3301 <b>consultations</b> with female adolescents were analysed using descriptive statistical methods and multiple logistic regression. RESULTS: Female adolescents presented SRH problems that merited medical attention. The mean number of problems presented was 1. 5 per consultation: 34 % of the vouchers were used for contraceptives, 31 % for complaints related to sexually transmitted infection (STI) or reproductive tract infection (RTI), 28 % for advice/counselling, 28 % for antenatal check-up and 18 % for pregnancy testing. A new category of health care users emerged: sexually active girls who were neither pregnant nor mothers and who sought contraceptives or STI/RTI treatment. Contraceptive use doubled among the sexually active non-pregnant voucher redeemers. Consultation with a female doctor younger than 36 years was associated with a higher chance of having contraceptives prescribed. CONCLUSION: Accessible and appropriate SRH care has the potential to make an important contribution to the increased contraceptive use, decreased risk of unwanted teenage pregnancies and decreased prevalence of STIs/RTIs among underserved adolescents. Once adolescents access the services, providers have a crucial role in ensuring current and continuing needs are met. (aut. ref. ...|$|R

Methods and material. Between 1985 and 2004 116. 726 patients were studied, of whom 912 were male. Results and discussion. There are two basic factors for a good functioning of an imaging unit: a dedicated full time radiologist and a reference centre. A full time radiologist increases markedly the productivity. In our study it increased since her arrival to more than eight thousand patients a year, keeping steady since. The quality also increased: the number of misplaced previous studies decreased from 10 % to 4 %; unnecessary or poorly indicated studies were eliminated and a fast diagnostic path was established in collaboration with the reference centre. The three most common indicators of quality are: the rate of detection of carcinoma per thousand women, the rate of benign to malignant biopsies and the percentage of ultrasound studies. Rate of detection should not be lower than two per thousand. In our results, it varies between 2 and 5. 5, with a mean of 3. 3. In symptomatic patients should be superior to 10 per thousand. In our results, it varies between 15, 9 and 24, 79 with a mean of 22. 6. The percentage of benign vs. malignant biopsies should be between 25 and 40 %. Our percentage is 48, 6. The percentage of ultrasound studies in screening should not be over 10 %. In our study it rises to 15 %.

We are reporting 23 additional cases of giant cell tumor in the spine and sacrum gathered from our institution and the personal <b>consultation</b> <b>files</b> of the senior author. Ten lesions occurred in the sacrum with an average age of 31 years (range of 13 - 49) and 13 occurred in the mobile spine with an average age of 39. 1 years (range of 13 - 64). Most patients presented with pain or neurologic deficit at the site of tumor involvement, and symptoms were usually present for many months prior to diagnosis. Six of the sacral GCT patients were treated with pre-operative arterial embolization and intralesional surgical resection, and two developed a recurrence. Two of the sacral GCT patients had an en bloc resection and neither developed a recurrence. One sacral GCT patient was treated only with serial arterial embolization with good disease control. One sacral GCT patient did not receive any treatment. Eleven spinal GCT patients were treated with en bloc surgical resection and two developed a recurrence, the other two spinal GCT patients were treated with intralesional surgical resection and both developed a recurrence. Giant cell tumors of the spine and sacrum should be managed with en bloc resections whenever possible as this provides the greatest chance for cure. When the risk of post-operative neurologic deficit after en bloc excision is high, as in most of our sacral lesions, conservative therapy involving arterial embolization and intralesional resection offers the best results...|$|R
40|$|Background & Objective: The {{immune system}} of Patients with Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome (AIDS) is weekend because of Human {{immunodeficiency}} virus (HIV) infection, {{and they become}} vulnerable to several opportunistic and non-opportunistic pathogens and different carcinomas. IV drug abuse, sexual contact, occupational transmission, blood transfusion and maternal-fetal transmission are well known transmission routes for HIV infection. This study was under taken to investigate the prevalence of HIV transmission routs in the HIV infected population of Sirjan, and their knowledge about the disease, in order to plan better preventive strategies. Materials & Methods: A cross sectional study was planned. During a 6 -month period in 2010, all of the HIV infected people in Sirjan (old and new cases) who had a <b>file</b> at the <b>consultation</b> center for high risk behavior, completed a valid and reliable questionnaire. Results: The definite route of transmission was not clear {{in any of the}} patients because they had more than one suspicious route. Injected drug abusers were the most common (88. 4 %) followed by those who got tattoos (79. 1 %), invasive therapeutic procedures, dentistry, surgery and endoscopy (56. 1 %), high risk sexual behavior (62. 8 %), bloodletting (9. 3 %), injuries in the barbershop (9. 3 %) and blood transfusion (2. 3 %). Conclusion: All of the HIV infected cases in Sirjan were involved with several high risk behaviors, but the major route of transmission, similar {{to other parts of the}} country was injected drug abuse. Educational programs for prevention of AIDS should be followed seriously and special attention should be paid to groups with multiple high risk behaviors...|$|R
40|$|Objective: Malignant glioneuronal tumors show {{considerable}} morphological diversity. Their biological {{behavior and}} clinicopathological characteristics are incompletely understood. With {{the exception of}} anaplastic ganglioglioma, they are not assigned to a specific entity in the current WHO classification. It is also not clear whether histological features of these neoplasms influence prognosis. Material and Method: We identified 36 glioneuronal tumors with malignant histological features among the departmental archives and neuropathology <b>consultation</b> <b>files</b> of the authors. We reviewed the pathological and radiological features of these tumors to construct a preliminary histological categorization. Results: Based on their pathological features, we divided the study group into three histologically distinct categories: 1) glioneuronal tumors with a malignant glial component (anaplastic gangliogliomas); 2) glioneuronal tumors with a malignant neuronal/neuroblastic component; 3) glioneuronal tumors with both malignant neuronal and glial components. All tumors occurred in a younger age group compared to glioblastomas and appeared radiologically well-defined, cystic and solid with variable contrast enhancement. There was {{a high rate of}} local recurrence (29 of 36 patients) and 12 patients died during follow-up period. Median progression-free survival was less than 12 months, and did not differ among categories. Cerebrospinal tumor spread was seen in only one patient. Concurrent WHO grade I ganglioglioma and the presence of a malignant neuronal component did not appear to influence prognosisConclusion: MGNTs were considered in three simple categories based on their malignant component(s). Tumors in all categories exhibited a high rate of local recurrence and aggressive behavior akin to malignant gliomas as opposed to classical PNET. Nevertheless, MGNT demonstrated clinicopathological features that distinguish them from typical glioblastoma. The exact nosology of MGNTs is unresolved and our study underscores the need for a more comprehensive classification of these neoplasms within the WHO scheme...|$|R
40|$|Infants {{and young}} {{children}} may be exposed {{to a variety of}} dangerous situations when left sleeping in cots, chairs, or beds. A review of 30 cases of accidental asphyxia occurring in infants {{and young children}} who had been left to sleep unattended was undertaken from the necropsy and <b>consultation</b> <b>files</b> of the Adelaide Children's Hospital. Causes of death included hanging from loose restrainers, clothing, or a curtain cord (12 cases), positional asphyxia/wedging from slipping between a mattress and bed/cot sides or wall, or from moving into a position where the face was covered and the upper airway occluded (16 cases), and suffocation from plastic bed covers (two cases). Cases of co-sleeping in bed with an adult and of non-accidental asphyxia were not included in this review. As the pathological findings were on occasion identical to those that are typically found in sudden infant death syndrome, adequate death scene examination was vital in several cases to allow identification of lethal sleeping environments and to enable steps to be taken to minimise the risk of future deaths due to similar situations. For example, two cases in which infants asphyxiated in rocking cradles led to the investigation of the cradles and to formulation of specific safety recommendations regarding the angle of tilt. Two infants who died after becoming wedged between the back of a couch and a co-sleeping parent in one case and cushions in the other, would indicate that this also represents a potentially lethal sleeping position. Other dangerous situations involved infant car seat restraints, seats with loose harnesses, cots with movable sides or projecting pieces, thin plastic mattress/pillow coverings, and beds with spaces between the mattress and cot side or wall. Lack of supervision at the time of death was a feature of each case...|$|R
40|$|Background: Fine needle {{aspiration}} (FNA) cytology is a popular, {{reliable and}} cost effective technique for {{the diagnosis of}} thyroid lesions. The aim of our study was to review cases of misclassified primary malignant neoplasms of the thyroid by FNA, and assess the causes of cytologic misdiagnosis {{and their impact on}} clinical management. Methods: Clinical data, FNA smears and follow-up surgical specimens of cases diagnosed with primary thyroid carcinoma were reviewed. Results: Of the 365 cases with a malignant diagnosis by FNA over a period of 11 years, nine (2. 4 &#x 0025;) were identified with discrepant histologic diagnosis with regard to the type of primary thyroid malignancy. In addition, four cases were added from the <b>consultation</b> <b>files</b> of the Massachusetts General Hospital. Areas of difficulty contributing to misclassification included overlapping cytologic features (n = 6), rarity of tumors (n = 3), and sampling limitations (n = 4). Of the 13 cases, 12 underwent total or near total thyroidectomy and one patient had concurrent surgical biopsy. Measurement of serum calcitonin levels in one case, with an initial cytologic diagnosis of medullary carcinoma, prevented unnecessary lymph node dissection. Misclassification of medullary carcinoma as papillary carcinoma precluded lymph node dissection in one case. Further management decisions were based on the final histologic diagnosis and did not require additional surgery. Two cases of undifferentiated (anaplastic) thyroid carcinoma were misdiagnosed as papillary thyroid carcinoma. Both patients received total thyroidectomies, which may not otherwise have been performed. Conclusions: A small subset of primary malignant neoplasms of the thyroid may be misclassified with regard to the type of malignancy on FNA. The majority of primary malignant neoplasms diagnosed on FNA require thyroidectomy. However, initial cytologic misclassification of medullary carcinoma or undifferentiated carcinoma as other malignant neoplasms or vice versa may have an impact on clinical management...|$|R
40|$|Composite adenoma-carcinoid {{tumors are}} rare {{colorectal}} lesions consisting of intermingled adenomatous and carcinoid components. Unlike other mixed endocrine-glandular colorectal neoplasms, which are generally malignant, their glandular component is histologically benign and their natural history is favorable. We present 4 cases of colonic adenomas containing microcarcinoids, a hitherto undescribed lesion that {{is either a}} precursor of composite adenoma-carcinoids or a related but independent entity. The cases, identified among our surgical and <b>consultation</b> <b>files,</b> were endoscopically routine sessile polyps removed from 4 otherwise normal individuals, 3 from the cecum and 1 from the distal colon. The microcarcinoids were 0. 5 to 1. 5 mm in size and situated within the basal lamina propria, where they interposed between the crypts and muscularis mucosae without disturbing the overall polyp architecture. Histologically, they consisted of collections of low-grade epithelial cells arranged in nests, cords, tubules, and irregular clusters and characterized by eosinophilic, granular, or clear cytoplasm and by round central nuclei with stippled or dusty chromatin. Endocrine differentiation of the microcarcinoids was confirmed by the expression of 3 {{or more of the}} following: Grimelius argyrophil, chromogranin, synaptophysin, neuron-specific enolase and somatostatin. No mitotic figures or MIB- 1 or p 53 positivity were observed. The glandular component of the polyps was unremarkable in 3 cases, but 1 polyp, in addition to a microcarcinoid, showed a diffuse pattern of mixed adenomatous-endocrine differentiation. The patients' clinical course was benign on the basis of 2 years' median follow-up (range, 6 mo to 10 y). Two patients with incomplete polypectomies underwent hemicolectomy revealing no residual endocrine neoplasia. Awareness of microcarcinoids in colonic adenomas should help avert potential diagnostic pitfalls posed by their pleomorphism, basal location, and infiltrative patterns, and may help clarify their natural history and possible relationship to composite glandular-carcinoid tumors...|$|R
40|$|Introduction: In {{the current}} {{economic}} context, all partners in health care delivery systems, be they public or private, are obliged to identify {{the factors that influence}} the utilization of health care services. To improve our understanding of the phenomena that underlie these relationships, Statistics Canada and the Manitoba Centre for Health Policy and Evaluation have just set up a new database. For a representative sample {{of the population of the}} province of Manitoba, cross-sectional microdata on individuals' health and socio-economic characteristics were linked with detailed longitudinal data on utilization of health care services. Data and methods: The 1986 - 87 Health and Activity Limitation Survey, the 1986 Census and the files of Manitoba Health were matched (without using names or addresses) by means of the CANLINK software. In the pilot project, 20, 000 units were selected from the Census according to modern sampling techniques. Before the <b>files</b> were matched, <b>consultations</b> were held and an agreement was signed by all parties in order to establish a framework for protecting privacy and preserving the confidentiality of the data. Results: A matching rate of 74 % was obtained for private households. A quality evaluation based on the comparisons of names and addresses over a small subsample established that the overall concordance rate among matched pairs was 95. 5 %. The match rates and concordance rates varied according to age and household composition. Estimates produced from the sample accurately reflected the socio-demographic profile, mortality, hospitalization rate, health care costs and consumption of health care by Manitoba residents. Discussion: The matching rate of 74 % was satisfactory in comparison with the response rates reported in most population surveys. Because of the excellent concordance rate and the accuracy of the estimates obtained from the sample, this database will provide an adequate basis for studying the association between socio-demographic characteristics, health and health care utilization in province of Manitoba.

40|$|Background:Leptospirosis is {{a global}} {{zoonotic}} disease. Although important {{for the assessment of}} the burden of leptospirosis, data on the duration of the illness and the occurrence of post-leptospirosis complaints are not well documented. Hence the main objective {{of this study was to}} estimate the occurrence of persistent complaints and duration of hospital stay in laboratory confirmed leptospirosis patients in the Netherlands during 1985 to 2010. Additionally, several risk factors potentially impacting on the occurrence of post-leptospirosis complaints were investigated. Methods/Principal Findings:The duration of the acute phase of leptospirosis was 16 days (IQR 12 - 23); 10 days (IQR 7 - 16) were spent hospitalized. Eighteen fatal cases were excluded from this analysis. Complaints of leptospirosis patients by passive case investigations (CPC) derived from <b>files</b> on ambulant <b>consultations</b> occurring one month after hospital discharge, revealed persistent complaints in 108 of 236 (45. 8 %) laboratory confirmed cases. Data on persistent complaints after acute leptospirosis (PCAC), assessed in 225 laboratory confirmed leptospirosis cases collected through questionnaires during 1985 - 1993, indicated 68 (30. 2 %) PCAC cases. Frequently reported complaints included (extreme) fatigue, myalgia, malaise, headache, and a weak physical condition. These complaints prolonged in 21. 1 % of the cases beyond 24 months after onset of disease. There was no association between post-leptospirosis complaints and hospitalization. However, individuals admitted at the intensive care unit (ICU) were twice as likely to have continuing complaints after discharge adjusting for age and dialysis (OR 2. 0 95 % CI 0. 8 - 4. 8). No significant association could be found between prolongation of complaints and infecting serogroup, although subgroup analysis suggest that infection with serogroups Sejroe (OR 4. 8, 95 %CI 0. 9 - 27. 0) and icterohaemorrhagiae (OR 2. 0, 95 %CI 0. 9 - 4. 3 CI) are more likely to result in CPC than infections with serogroup Grippotyphosa. Conclusion/Significance:In addition to the acute disease, persistent complaints have an impact on the burden of leptospirosis...|$|R
40|$|BACKGROUND: In 1976, Hawk and Hazard {{described}} the tall cell variant (TCV) of papillary thyroid carcinoma (PTC). While the lesions they described had cytologic features of papillary carcinoma, they showed more aggressive behavior {{with a greater}} propensity for extrathyroid extension and lymphovascular invasion than classic PTC. In 1991, Bronner and LiVolsi described a series of patients with TCV that progressed to spindle cell squamous carcinoma (SCSC), a unique form of anaplastic thyroid carcinoma. This study describes the variable clinical and pathologic presentations in 31 patients with anaplastic SCSC arising in association with TCV. METHODS: The surgical pathology archives {{as well as the}} personal <b>consultation</b> <b>files</b> of one of the authors (V. A. L.) were reviewed to retrieve cases of SCSC arising in association with TCV. The available clinical as well as pathologic information on all patients was reviewed. RESULTS: A total of 31 patients with SCSC arising in association with TCV were retrieved from our files. The average age at primary presentation was 67 (range 32 - 92) with a female-to-male ratio of 2 : 1. Three clinical scenarios for SCSC associated with TCV were identified. These were type I, consisting of TCV with SCSC at the time of presentation (18 patients); type II, consisting of SCSC arising as a recurrence in patients with a known history of TCV (5 patients); and type III, consisting of SCSC presenting as a primary laryngeal squamous cell carcinoma in a patient with or without a known history of TCV (8 patients). The type III cases were of most concern since they often were confused with primary laryngeal squamous cell carcinoma and most often were diagnosed after laryngectomy. CONCLUSIONS: SCSC of the thyroid is almost exclusively associated with TCV and can have variable clinical presentations. SCSC is most commonly seen associated with a primary diagnosis of TCV. SCSC may be seen, however, in patients with recurrent PTC and most importantly may present in a fashion similar to primary laryngeal SCSC. Therefore, caution should be exercised in evaluating laryngeal squamous lesions in patients with known history of TCV and without known risks factors for head and neck carcinogenesis...|$|R
