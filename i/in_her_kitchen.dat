25|$|In 1967, Nixon {{created the}} show's most iconic character: Rachel Davis (first played by Robin Strasser {{and later by}} Victoria Wyndham). Rachel was raised by her single mother, Ada (Constance Ford), who {{provided}} a good foil for Rachel. Down-to-earth Ada could sit <b>in</b> <b>her</b> <b>kitchen</b> on Bowman Street and be perfectly content with her life. Rachel, on the other hand, was a schemer who was determined to escape her impoverished background, {{even if it meant}} she had to resort to underhanded means.|$|E

25|$|Early in {{the summer}} of 1861 the Soldiers' Relief Association was organized, with McCord as {{president}}. In July 1861, she was made president of the Ladies' Clothing Association. The first-named organization made the uniforms for the company of her son, Captain L. Cheves McCord, his mother furnishing the material. She resigned her presidency of the Soldiers' Relief Association in order to give her whole time to the military hospital established within the South Carolina College; this was in 1862, and here she gave her greatest service. In her home, at the northwest corner of Pendleton and Bull streets, {{across the street from the}} college property, she received supplies from the women of the city -— supplies available for nourishment for the sick, and hospital comfort. Early every day, there was made <b>in</b> <b>her</b> <b>kitchen</b> a supply of corn bread and broth, heaped into plates and left on a long dresser on her back piazza, served day after day as the nourishment for wounded soldiers who could drag themselves across the street from the convalescent building on the campus.|$|E
25|$|In her day-to-day life, {{when things}} are too boring or upsetting, Selma slips into daydreams or perhaps a trance-like state where she imagines the {{ordinary}} circumstances and individuals around her have erupted into elaborate musical theater numbers. These songs use some sort of real-life noise (from factory machines buzzing {{to the sound of}} a flag rapping against a flag pole in the wind) as an underlying rhythm. Unfortunately, Selma slips into one such trance while working at the factory. Soon Jeff and Cvalda begin to realize that Selma can barely see at all. Additionally, Bill reveals to Selma that his materialistic wife Linda spends more than his salary, there is no money left from his inheritance, and he is behind in payments and the bank is going to take his house. He asks Selma for a loan, but she declines. He regrets telling Selma his secret. To comfort Bill, Selma reveals her secret blindness, hoping that together they can keep each other's secret. Bill then hides in the corner of Selma's home, knowing she can't see him, and watches as she puts some money <b>in</b> <b>her</b> <b>kitchen</b> tin.|$|E
500|$|The 1907 edition runs to some 30 full-page colour plates, {{and over}} 100 full-page {{illustrations}} in monochrome. These include photographs, such {{as of the}} housekeeper standing with hands behind her back <b>in</b> <b>her</b> <b>kitchen</b> (pictured), facing {{the first page of}} Chapter 2, [...] "The Housekeeper". An idea of the amount of detail may be gained from {{the fact that there are}} 11 illustrations of types of fish (one pictured), such as [...] "steamed sole" [...] and [...] "soused mackerel", and another of [...] "fish entrées".|$|E

In these chapters, David writes about {{the background of the}} herbs and spices and condiments that came into use in British kitchens over the previous centuries, and sketches the history of their adoption from Asia and continental Europe. The Times Literary Supplement called this part of the book [...] "as difficult to put down as a good thriller." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{sessions}} with Dravs and Björk were casual, with Björk allowing Dravs freedom with the album. Björk only left {{the studio to}} cook meals for the both of them. One of the first songs created during the sessions was [...] "5 Years" [...] which Dravs created the fast beat for. The progress of Homogenic in these sessions was halted due to a media sensation caused by the suicide of Björk's stalker Ricardo López. To deal with the stress of being at home during this incident, Björk imagined herself as the protagonist in a Spanish soap opera. The character's image inspired a song titled [...] "So Broken" [...] which she sang to herself <b>in</b> <b>her</b> <b>kitchen.</b> The song was later included on the Japanese import of the album.|$|E

Walter admits to Peter that, during an accident many years ago, a mysterious third party saved both their lives. The man was bald and had no eyebrows, who [...] "knew my [...] thoughts before I did."

2500|$|Theatre {{projects}} for Hines, from 1984, included Big River, Are You Lonesome Tonight? and Jerry's Girls. In 1986 a fall <b>in</b> <b>her</b> <b>kitchen</b> {{resulted in the}} diagnosis of her diabetes, which was treated by daily injections of insulin, careful monitoring of her diet {{and a commitment to}} fitness. Hines performed the closing act of the 1990 Sydney Gay and Lesbian Mardi Gras. It was a turning-point for her and she later described the crowd ovation her most pleasing audience reception ever. Hines decided she would return to singing, while her daughter Deni was achieving her own successes initially singing with Rockmelons for their top five hits [...] "Ain't No Sunshine" [...] and [...] "That Word (L.O.V.E.)"

2500|$|She invited groups not {{normally}} invited to presidential residences {{to visit her}} in Áras an Uachtaráin; from the Christian Brothers, a large religious order who ran schools throughout Ireland but had never had its leaders invited to the Áras, to G.L.E.N., the Gay and Lesbian Equality Network. She visited Irish nuns and priests abroad, Irish famine relief charities, attended international sports events, met the Pope and, against pressure from the Taoiseach, Charles Haughey, not to do so, was the only head of state to meet the 14th Dalai Lama during his tour of Europe. She put a special symbolic light <b>in</b> <b>her</b> <b>kitchen</b> window in Áras an Uachtaráin which was visible {{to the public as}} it overlooked the principal public view of the building, as a sign of remembering Irish emigrants around the world (placing a light in a darkened window to guide the way of strangers was an old Irish folk custom). Robinson's symbolic light became an acclaimed symbol of an Ireland thinking about its sons and daughters around the world. [...] She visited Rwanda where she brought world attention to the suffering in that state in the aftermath of its civil war. After her visit, she spoke at a press conference, where she became visibly emotional. As a lawyer trained to be rational, she was furious at her emotion, but it moved many who saw it. One media critic who had slated her presidential ideas in 1990, journalist and Sunday Tribune editor Vincent Browne, passed her a note {{at the end of the}} press conference saying simply [...] "you were magnificent." ...|$|E
