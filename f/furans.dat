40|$|Since <b>furan</b> {{has been}} {{classified}} as “possibly carcinogenic to humans” (group 2 B) by the International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC) (1995), {{its presence in}} foods has acquired significant attention. Many studies on <b>furan</b> formation have been performed mainly in simple model systems (buffered or dry mixtures of <b>furan</b> precursors) which do not fully represent food. Therefore, the main goal {{of this research was}} to investigate <b>furan</b> generation in more realistic starch-based model systems containing various <b>furan</b> precursors, such as vitamin C (ascorbic and dehydroascorbic acid), carbohydrates, lipids (vegetable oils as a source of polyunsaturated fatty acids) or mixtures of lipids and antioxidants, all either alone or in the presence of proteins. In addition, the interactions between various <b>furan</b> precursors were studied. The quantitative determination of <b>furan</b> was performed by solid-phase microextraction-gas chromatography-mass spectrometry. The results indicated that ascorbic acid and lactose at pH 6. 0 with and without proteins were particularly vulnerable to <b>furan</b> formation upon heating when incorporated in a starch-based model system. Interestingly, starch itself showed an enhancing effect on <b>furan</b> formation from ascorbic acid as compared to buffered solutions of this vitamin heated under the same conditions. Fresh oils were nearly unable to generate <b>furan.</b> However, oils, such as soybean, rapeseed and linseed oil, containing α linolenic acid, generated considerable amounts of <b>furan,</b> but only when highly oxidized. Remarkably, generation of <b>furan</b> in emulsions containing fresh and oxidized oils was significantly enhanced in the presence of ascorbic acid, which indicated a synergistic effect between oils and vitamin C. This phenomenon was probably due to an enhanced degradation of this vitamin in the presence of lipids. These results illustrated the importance of the interactions between <b>furan</b> precursors, e. g. oils and ascorbic, in real foods which were currently neglected in the literature. In conclusion, this research contributed {{to a better understanding of}} <b>furan</b> formation in food.

40|$|Formation of the ‘‘possibly carcinogenic’’ <b>furan</b> during thermal {{treatment}} of a starch-based model food system containing selected sugars alone and {{in the presence of}} proteins, ascorbic acid and lipids, respectively, was investigated. The results showed that in starch gels containing various sugars significantly more <b>furan</b> was formed at pH 6 than at pH 4.

In acidic conditions, no significant difference was observed between the amounts of <b>furan</b> found in a starch–carbohydrate–ascorbic acid model system and those formed in a starch-based samples containing only ascorbic acid.

40|$|The {{generation}} of <b>furan</b> from vitamin C during thermal {{treatment of a}} starch-based model system, which simulated baby food, was studied.

40|$|<b>Furan</b> has {{recently}} received considerable attention as a possibly carcinogenic compound occurring in thermally processed foods. Although several food constituents {{have been identified}} as <b>furan</b> precursors, multiple formation pathways remain unclear. Therefore, the mechanisms of <b>furan</b> formation in Maillard model systems were studied by means of the carbon module labeling (CAMOLA) technique. Under both roasting and pressure-cooking conditions, <b>furan</b> was formed from glucose via the intact skeleton, and its formation pathways from glucose alone were not amino acid-dependent. However, some amino acids, especially alanine and serine, did influence the <b>furan</b> production by providing an additional formation pathway. Furthermore, most amino acids enhanced the <b>furan</b> production from glucose. Roasting conditions produced 25 - 100 times higher amounts of <b>furan</b> as compared to pressure-cooking conditions.
