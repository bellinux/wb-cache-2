500|$|Kohli's {{father died}} on 18 December 2006 {{due to a}} stroke after being bed-ridden for a month. Regarding his early life, Kohli has said in an interview, [...] "I've seen a lot in life. Losing my father at a young age, the family {{business}} not doing too well, staying in a rented place. There were tough times for the family... It's all embedded in my memory." [...] According to Kohli, his father supported his cricket training during his childhood, [...] "My father was my biggest support. He {{was the one who}} <b>drove</b> <b>me</b> to practice everyday. I miss his presence sometimes." ...|$|E
500|$|Gandhi {{participated in}} South African {{war against the}} Boers, on the British side in 1899. Both the Dutch {{settlers}} called Boers and the imperial British at that time discriminated against the coloured races they considered as inferior, and Gandhi later wrote about his conflicted beliefs during the Boer war. He stated that [...] "when the war was declared, my personal sympathies were all with the Boers, but my loyalty to the British rule <b>drove</b> <b>me</b> to participation with the British in that war". According to Gandhi, he felt that since he was demanding his rights as a British citizen, it was also his duty to serve the British forces in the defence of the British Empire.|$|E
500|$|The episode {{featured}} {{the return of}} Black's near-psychic visions; a phenomenon which had been used with much less frequency in the second season. Executive producer Glen Morgan begrudgingly allowed Maher and Reindl to show the ability in this episode, saying [...] "I felt last year those visions were a cheat. The camera {{would go to a}} coffee cup and Frank would say, 'The murderer used a coffee cup.' It <b>drove</b> <b>me</b> nuts. What we were trying to do this year was elevate Frank's visions to a dream-like state, so he would have to interpret what he's seeing. There would be more mystical, symbolic imagery that might give him more of a sense of what's going on. I had wanted to strip away the gift {{for a long time and}} see if the show really played without it. But we got back into that".|$|E

500|$|The {{overtaking}} manoeuvres made by Coulthard on Michael Schumacher {{received much}} media attention after the race. Coulthard accused Michael Schumacher of unsporting behaviour and dangerous driving, saying: [...] "I had a clean run at Michael {{on the outside}} and equally I felt he <b>drove</b> <b>me</b> wide. You could say he had the right to do that because he had the track position, but I think it was a deliberate gesture in trying to run someone wide like that and I was very angry." [...] Michael Schumacher later denied any wrongdoing and citied a similar incident at the 1999 Japanese Grand Prix where Coulthard pushed him wide although no objections were made. He also admitted that he did not see Coulthard's hand gesture. Coulthard sought clarification with the FIA over such overtakes with a source from Formula One's governing body noting: [...] "It was hard racing -- they are racing drivers aren't they?" [...] GrandPrix.com said that Coulthard's overtake meant that [...] "He is ready to stand up to Michael and he is not afraid of what will happen if Michael does not lift." ...|$|E
500|$|In later years, Fellini {{explained}} that from [...] "a sentimental point of view," [...] he was [...] "most attached" [...] to La Strada: [...] "Above all, because I {{feel that it}} is my most representative film, the one that is the most autobiographical; for both personal and sentimental reasons, because it is the film that I had the greatest trouble in realizing and that gave me the most difficulty {{when it came time to}} find a producer." [...] Of all the imaginary beings he had brought to the screen, Fellini felt closest to the three principals of La Strada, [...] "especially Zampanò." [...] Anthony Quinn found working for Fellini invaluable: [...] "He <b>drove</b> <b>me</b> mercilessly, making me do scene after scene over and over again until he got what he wanted. I learned more about film acting in three months with Fellini than I'd learned in all the movies I'd made before then." [...] Long afterwards, in 1990, Quinn sent a note to the director and his co-star: [...] "The two of you are the highest point in my life -- Antonio." ...|$|E
500|$|Đính was {{reported}} to have celebrated his new positions by making conspicuous appearances at Saigon nightclubs and dancing, having lifted Madame Nhu's bans on such activities. He reportedly kissed the bar dancers and ordered champagne for all present. Đính's brash behavior caused public relations problems for the junta. In interviews with the Washington Post and The New York Times, he claimed that he took {{a leading role in the}} coup because [...] "we would have lost the war under Diệm" [...] and saying that he participated [...] "not for personal ambition, but for the population, the people and to get rid of Nhu". He claimed to have been the [...] "specialist... gave the orders in only thirty minutes", keeping the plans [...] "all in his head". In an exclusive interview with Herndon, he said [...] "You are the one who started it all, who <b>drove</b> <b>me</b> into making the coup. You are the hero of the revolution." [...] This was a reference to Herndon's sarcastic reference to Đính as a [...] "great national hero" [...] after the general took credit for the pagoda raids. He also courted controversy with anti-American remarks, stating [...] "On August 21, I was governor of Saigon and loyal to Diem; on November 1, I was governor of Saigon and fighting Diem; maybe in the future I'll be governor of Saigon and fighting against the Americans." ...|$|E

500|$|... "Inside Out" [...] is an electropop {{song that}} {{features}} themes of dubstep and R, complimented with [...] "earth-shattering synths". Lyrically, the [...] "sexy breakup song", {{as described by}} Jocelyn Vena of MTV, opens with Spears singing, [...] "Said you're gonna {{be here in a}} minute/ Sitting in the mirror getting pretty/ Gotta look my best if we're gonna break up/ Gotta look my best if we're gonna break up/ I can hear you knocking at the front door/ And I know exactly what you came for/ Trying to say goodbye but it's hot and heavy/ Trying to say goodbye but it's hot and heavy." [...] While the couple seems {{to be on the verge}} of a breakup, there's apparently still some sexual tension between them, which is perceived in lines such as [...] "You ... touch me and it's breaking me down/ I'm telling you, let's just give it up and get down." [...] Spears crescendos [...] "So come on/Won't you give me something to remember/Baby shut your mouth and turn me inside out." [...] during the chorus section, and then goes on to [...] "Hit me one more time it's so amazing" [...] and [...] "You're the only one who's ever <b>drove</b> <b>me</b> crazy" [...] referencing her first singles [...] "...Baby One More Time" [...] (1998) and [...] "(You Drive Me) Crazy" [...] (1999). The song was compared to her earlier work on albums In the Zone (2003) and Circus (2008) and it has been compared to that of Madonna's Ray of Light (1998) and Music (2000). The [...] "futuristic-sounding, slow-grooving tune" [...] was also considered reminiscent of Janet Jackson.|$|E

2500|$|He persevered, {{and became}} the first ever to reach the Pole solo.

2500|$|In early 2003, [...] "You <b>Drove</b> <b>Me</b> To It", {{which had}} been re-mastered for the album version was re-released as a single.

60|$|There was no warning. On the sudden, {{both the}} Hairless One {{and my sister}} sprang and screamed. At the same instant I heard the thud of the arrows that transfixed them. The next instant they were down on the ground, floundering and gasping, {{and the rest of}} us were stampeding for the trees. An arrow <b>drove</b> past <b>me</b> and entered the ground, its {{feathered}} shaft vibrating and oscillating from the impact of its arrested flight. I remember clearly how I swerved as I ran, to go past it, and that I gave it a needlessly wide berth. I must have shied at it as a horse shies at an object it fears.|$|R

60|$|A {{coach was}} passing at that moment. I shouted, and the knave who <b>drove</b> glanced at <b>me,</b> then up the Rue Monarque at my pursuers, whereupon, shaking his head, {{he would have}} left me to my fate. But I was of another mind. I dashed towards the vehicle, and as it passed me I caught at the window, which luckily was open, and drawing up my legs I hung there despite the shower of mud which the {{revolving}} wheels deposited upon me.|$|R
40|$|The {{last time}} that Bert Draper flew up {{from his home in}} Los Angeles, California to give a talk to our club was in 1995 for the April meeting. Bert flew in to the Vancouver International Airport where I met him. He stayed at my home and <b>drove</b> with <b>me</b> to the meeting. Bert had stayed at my home before when he had {{presented}} a program to our club and on each occasion he had brought a small gift for me. This last time his gift consisted of one specimen of the eelgrass limpet Lottia alveus (Conrad, 1831). The specimen had been collected by George Willett at Grants Island in Alaska, probably during the noted malacologist’s trip there in 1918 - 19, and it had lately been in the collection of E. P.

60|$|And now {{a perfect}} tornado burst upon me. The ground shook as though {{thousands}} of horses thundered across it; {{and this time}} the storm bore on its icy wings, not snow, but great hailstones which drove with such violence that they might have come from the thongs of Balearic slingers--hailstones that beat down leaf and branch and made the shelter of the cypresses of no more avail than though their stems were standing-corn. At the first I had rushed to the nearest tree; but I was soon fain to leave it and seek the only spot that seemed to afford refuge, the deep Doric doorway of the marble tomb. There, crouching against the massive bronze door, I gained a certain amount of protection from the beating of the hailstones, for now they only <b>drove</b> against <b>me</b> as they ricocheted from the ground and the side of the marble.|$|R

In 1903, he dropped out of seventh grade (later stating that [...] "algebra's what <b>drove</b> <b>me</b> off"), and went to live and work on a nearby farm. At age 13, he left home. He then took a job painting horse carriages in Indianapolis. When he was 14, he moved to southern Indiana to work as a farmhand.|$|E

Funeral for a Friend toured feverishly to promote Casually Dressed & Deep in Conversation, including {{a series of}} European dates in which they opened for their idols, Iron Maiden. This was met with a mixed reception, as their style and fan base bore {{little resemblance to the}} heavy metal background of Iron Maiden.

If I had not driven her from me {{she would have been}} my wife long before harm came to her; but it was as well that it was not so, for as I was then I know I should have made her life a hell.|$|R
60|$|Lady Glyde {{was at the}} station. There {{was great}} {{crowding}} and confusion, and more delay than I liked (in case any of her friends had happened {{to be on the}} spot), in reclaiming her luggage. Her first questions, as we <b>drove</b> off, implored <b>me</b> to tell her news of her sister. I invented news of the most pacifying kind, assuring her that she was about to see her sister at my house.
