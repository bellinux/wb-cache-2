Whilst Arveladze refused to be drawn into questions on whether the broadcast breached the code of conduct for broadcasters, the Georgian National Communications Commission and the Young Lawyers' Association of Georgia said that Imedi had violated the code with its broadcast.

After a finding by the GNMC that the broadcast violated the broadcaster's code of conduct, the broadcaster was directed to make a public apology.|$|E

40|$|I {{was always}} a really good kid. I did my homework, ate my vegetables, and made my bed. I was happy and <b>I</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>everyone</b> else to be happy too. So when I began this project, I was not {{prepared}} to face the reality of what surfaced. Quite unexpectedly, I found myself drawn to themes of loneliness and loss, of interpersonal connection, and finding center in the midst of transition. Because, when I really got down to it, I discovered that growing up is often a lonely process. The journey of moving from childhood to adulthood is one that you have to complete on your own. It’s a solitary pilgrimage of self-reflection and choice. Thus, this project sought to examine those moments of seclusion and isolation in some way, digging deep into the idea that every situation is either making a connection or retracting from it. There is conflict embedded in the very nature of this journey. For me, this has manifested in my navigation of extremes—the reaching out and the pulling in—as I relate to my family and friends. Walking this narrow rope will likely be a lifetime commitment, as I begin to unravel who I am and who I can become...|$|R
