Among other functions such as research, monitoring and co-ordinating of <b>further</b> <b>education</b> <b>and</b> <b>training</b> provision, it also advances moneys to education and training boards and other bodies engaged in the provision of <b>further</b> <b>education</b> <b>and</b> <b>training</b> programmes. The sixteen education and training boards (ETBs) were established on the dissolution of the 33 Vocational Education Committees (VECs). At about the same time FAS, the national training and employment authority established in 1987, was also dissolved. The Department of Social Protection took over the responsibility from FÁS for Community Employment and Employment Services and over 800 former FAS staff. In 2014 the transfer of the former FAS training centre network, its 600+ staff and training facilities to the newly established education and training boards was successfully completed. ETBs grant aided by SOLAS, offer around 270,000 places on 20,000+ <b>further</b> <b>education</b> <b>and</b> <b>training</b> courses in any one year. SOLAS also administers the Irish apprenticeship system. SOLAS publishes an annual services plan setting out what <b>further</b> <b>education</b> <b>and</b> <b>training</b> courses will be provided in the sixteen ETBs in any one year and how much these courses will cost.|$|E

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to develop a model of change which {{identified}} the forces that drive and restrain the embedding of information technology into <b>Further</b> <b>Education</b> vocational <b>education</b> <b>and</b> <b>training</b> courses for sixteen to nineteen year old students. The analytical inductive approach used for the research had four components. Firstly, the literature review examined the educational media and theoretical contexts of the research. Secondly the fieldwork which aimed to identify the driving and restraining forces, comprised: "a casing exercise undertaken at national, regional and local levels "a census and surveys using data collected from two sources: <b>Further</b> <b>Education</b> vocational <b>education</b> <b>and</b> <b>training</b> courses in the Sheffield LEA area and the evaluation of the AI (Artificial Intelligence) applications to learning programme case studies two longitudnal case studies an implementation case study and three one shot case studies. Thirdly, evaluation tools were developed to aid researchers evaluate governmental intervention into the embedding of advanced information technology into the <b>Further</b> <b>Education</b> vocational <b>education</b> <b>and</b> <b>training</b> curriculum. Finally, four models of change were developed which identified and utilised the factors found to affect the embedding of information technology in <b>Further</b> <b>Education</b> vocational <b>education</b> <b>and</b> <b>training</b> courses. These models included: " the Tricycle model which identifies three groups of people who may influence, positively or negatively the change strategy " the Factors Affecting the Introduction of Information Technology (FAIIT) model that outlines the factors, agencies, organisations and people which may influence the introduction of information technology into <b>Further</b> <b>Education</b> vocational <b>education</b> <b>and</b> <b>training</b> courses " EMBED, a three staged model which highlights the driving and restraining forces influencing the introduction of information technology and advanced information technology into the <b>Further</b> <b>Education</b> vocational <b>education</b> <b>and</b> <b>training</b> curriculum " the Durability model which focuses on the <b>Further</b> <b>Education</b> institution <b>and</b> provides a strategic framework to assist government and other funding agencies and departments embed information technology and advanced information technology into vocational <b>education</b> <b>and</b> <b>training</b> course...|$|R
