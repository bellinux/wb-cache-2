The study shows that the flexibility enabled lead-time reduction in enterprise systems is influenced by DIS of various types in various ways. It is thus important to appreciate the implications on knowledge management in flexibility driven enterprises. The knowledge of conventional systems requires to be modified and managing the new knowledge is very important. In our view most <b>flexible</b> <b>enterprises</b> face DIS scenarios in real systems.

Hence {{it is important to}} develop new DIS based models of enterprise systems and show the new knowledge explicitly to the managers. The studies indicated that DIS has significant effect on the lead-time performance in the enterprise system. It is the synergy of DIS and flexibility that contributes to higher performance. Typically managers invest in greater flexibility hoping that it will improve performance. The models of the nature discussed are needed by KM professionals to help change such mindsets...|$|R

They are seeking ways to maximise the power of information assets stored across hundreds of their databases and application programs by bringing them into open interoperable environments. However, this effort has been seriously hindered by various kinds of heterogeneity. Each system has its own domain model for its environment and efficient task operations. However, in order for systems to communicate and co-operate effectively, a shared domain model is required. The semantics of the common, and each local, model must be captured explicitly and formally to enable meaningful information exchange. The semantics of diverse information resources are captured by ontologies — definitions of terms as used in data sources, i. e. concepts and the relationships between concepts. When defining the relationships between data sources, we rely on ontologies to make the meaning of the different vocabularies used explicit. This paper explores the role of ontologies in enterprises, and proposes a methodology for managing enterprise ontology resources and a suite of support tools. 1...|$|R

For small {{businesses}} (SBs), that do not have financial and human resources, to sell in a big market by an e-commerce platform can be a competitive strategy. The electronic platform can reinforce the weaknesses of an absence of a commercial network to interact with end customers, especially if they live in another country. The platform allows small businesses to operate on the long tail. In fact they can sell also few specific products /services to {{a large number of people}} in a global context. Obviously, in economic terms, Small Businesses cannot compete with the big ones that can have most advanced technology and software for information processing.

40|$|This paper {{reviews the}} first {{results from a}} large Danish survey on {{organisational}} innovation within the private business sector. The 1, 900 surveyed firms are divided in two groups of an almost equal size according {{to whether or not}} they have undertaken organisational innovation during the period of 1993 - 95, i. e. innovative Y-firms and non-innovative N-firms. It appears that the Y-firms to a larger extent than the N-firms employ various types of work organisational principles that facilitate intraorganisational integration and the delegation of authority. The Y-firms find themselves in more competitive environments and are more focussed on the global market than the N-firms and do, to a larger extent, employ functional flexibility and combine technical and organisational innovation in order to meet this challenge. However, 1 / 3 of the N-firms display organisational characteristics very similar to the Y-firm, and it is hypothesised that this fraction which amounts to approximately 1 / 7 of the total sample comprises firms which have innovated organisationally in the past, i. e. before 1993. Finally, Y- and N-firms have in common {{the fact that they have}} intensified their cooperative relationships with customers and subcontractors.

The lack of formal ways to extract, distill and standardize the embedded domain knowledge has been a barrier to effective and efficient customization. Ontology may provide, as many would hope, the much needed methodology and standard {{to achieve the objective}} of building <b>flexible</b> <b>enterprise</b> solutions. This article examines the uses, issues and challenges of using ontology in enterprise applications. We believe that we are seriously lacking in modeling methodology, domain user tools, and lifecycle management methodology for the creation and maintenance of ontology on a large deployable scale.

Through real life scenarios, we are hoping to convey important research directions to better enable ontology. ...|$|E

The growing trend towards increasing selfemployment in Canada demands aeritical review of how educational programs support and encourage entrepreneurship and self-employment opportunities for students ofpost-secondary and adult training programs. The focus ofthis study was threefold. First, the study examined whether a relationship exists between self-directedness and success in self-employment. Secondly, the purpose of this research was to determine whether a relationship exists between psychological type as defined by Jung and success in selfemployment. Finally, this research effort attempted to develop a model for identifying individual potential for self-employment based on combined factors of self-directedness and psychological type. Success was measured in three stages: 1) Did the subject start a selfemployment initiative? 2) Did the business survive six months? 3) Did the business survive one year? The research went beyond classroom training activities to determine whether individuals actually started a business enterprise while participating ina self-employment program designed for individuals who were unemployed. Given that many people initiate a self-employment venture. without actually operating the business beyond the initial start-up, this research effort measured success based on a commitment of at least one year to the selfemployment initiative. Results ofthe study revealed that individuals {{with a high level of}} selfdirected learning readiness tended to be more likely to succeed in business in terms ofbusiness starts, survival for six months, and survival for one year. In addition, it was discovered that individuals who were extraverted intuitive types succeeded more often in business at all three levels than any other type.

40|$|Purpose - To {{develop a}} {{conceptual}} framework for {{a new form of}} production system unique from many perspectives. The proposed system is based on the creation of a network of plants that are electronically linked so that the participating members focus on their specialized tasks yet also share their manufacturing and production resources to create a loosely structured and <b>flexible</b> <b>enterprise.</b> Design/methodology/approach - To introduce dispersed network manufacturing (DNM) as a new business model, and to discuss dispersed manufacturing network (DMN) as a possible realization of DNM. To link DMN to complex adaptive systems and to provide a prototype as to how SMEs can form a dynamic and adaptive network to create competitive advantages on both collaborative and individual scales. Findings - The notion of DNM advocates a reciprocal bonding among network members but calls for no obligatory egalitarian responsibility to one another. This research shows the feasibility of a network of plants that are electronically linked so that the participating members, spread geographically, focus on their specialized tasks yet also share their manufacturing and production resources to create a loosely structured and <b>flexible</b> <b>enterprise.</b> Research limitations/implications - In the DNM universe, because of the network's requirement to re-form itself to the needs of each unique incoming project, SMEs have the ability to rapidly develop and enhance their internal production capabilities. Each new incoming project offers the chance to reaffirm those processes that are highly effective while discarding those that are deemed ill-suited. The DNM world {{is still in its infancy}} and many interesting and challenging questions have yet to be investigated empirically or otherwise. Practical implications - The new production system discussed in this paper argues for a completely different form of SME collaboration from those already discussed in the literature. Originality/value - DNM and DMN are new concepts that are evolving into an innovative production paradigm. It is likely that many companies and many managers have some intuitive grasp of the DNM world and the opportunities provided by forming a DMN. Few, however, might understand them thoroughly.
