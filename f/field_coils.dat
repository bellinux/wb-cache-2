25|$|Two {{antennae}} and two <b>field</b> <b>coils</b> are used, both arranged {{at right}} angles to each other. The area between the two <b>field</b> <b>coils</b> is filled with an analog of the original signal from the antennae. The sense coil, another loop antenna, is placed in the area between the <b>field</b> <b>coils.</b> Rotating the sense coil in the <b>field</b> <b>coils</b> has the same output as rotating the entire loop antenna in the original field.|$|E
25|$|In August, 2015, MIT {{announced}} a tokamak it named ARC fusion reactor design using rare-earth barium-copper oxide (REBCO) superconducting tapes to produce high-magnetic <b>field</b> <b>coils</b> that it claimed produce comparable magnetic field strength {{in a smaller}} configuration than other designs.|$|E
25|$|Protective relays {{can also}} be {{classified}} {{by the type of}} measurement they make. A protective relay may respond to the magnitude of a quantity such as voltage or current. Induction relays can respond to the product of two quantities in two <b>field</b> <b>coils,</b> which could for example represent the power in a circuit.|$|E
40|$|Abstract — The <b>field</b> <b>coil</b> is {{the primary}} {{component}} of the rotor assembly that provides the rotating magnetic field for the pulse power alternator. The design of the <b>field</b> <b>coil</b> is optimized {{so that it will}} produce the required magnetic field with minimum transient losses. The high currents required to produce the correct amp-turns, along with the mechanical loads due to high rotational speeds, present further design requirements for selection of <b>field</b> <b>coil</b> material, insulation, and surrounding material that completes the matrix of the <b>field</b> <b>coil</b> sub-assembly. With the addition of active cooling requirements in the <b>field</b> <b>coil</b> design, surrounding materials must be selected that retain electrically insulative properties and are thermally conductive to allow sufficient heat removal from the <b>field</b> <b>coil.</b> Thermoplastics are now being reviewed to replace traditional glass-epoxy potting compounds (thermosets) that have been used extensively in pulsed alternator designs. Fillers can be added to tailor properties of the thermoplastic, such as ceramics to increase thermal conductivity at the cost of an increase in density. Thermal analyses have been performed that show the benefits of using thermally conductive potting compounds. In addition, subscale <b>field</b> <b>coil</b> mock-ups (motorettes) have been encapsulated and tested to demonstrate encapsulation of current <b>field</b> <b>coil</b> geometries. I...|$|R
25|$|This is {{an older}} type of {{regulator}} {{used in the}} 1920s that uses the principle of a fixed-position <b>field</b> <b>coil</b> and a second <b>field</b> <b>coil</b> that can be rotated on an axis in parallel with the fixed coil, similar to a variocoupler.|$|R
50|$|A {{reciprocating}} {{electric motor}} uses an alternating magnetic field {{to move its}} armature back and forth, rather than circularly as in a conventional electric motor. A single <b>field</b> <b>coil</b> may be placed {{at one end of}} the armature's possible movement, or a <b>field</b> <b>coil</b> may be used at each end.|$|R
25|$|In actual fact, the {{resulting}} {{field in the}} coils is not an exact analog of the original. It {{would be if the}} <b>field</b> <b>coils</b> consisted of a single loop of wire, but as they actually consist of multiple windings, these are, in effect, small solenoids. The resulting field is then strongest {{at the edges of the}} windings, falling (ideally) to zero in the center.|$|E
25|$|In {{the early}} 1920s, Drs. Walter H. Schottky and Erwin Gerlach co-invented the first ribbon microphone. By turning the ribbon circuit in the {{opposite}} direction, they also invented the first ribbon loudspeaker. A few years later, Dr. Harry F. Olson of RCA started developing ribbon microphones using <b>ﬁeld</b> <b>coils</b> and permanent magnets. The RCA Photophone Type PB-31 was commercially manufactured in 1931, greatly impacting the audio recording and broadcasting industries. Condenser microphones at the time could not compare to its frequency response. Radio City Music Hall employed PB-31s in 1932. The following year, the 44A came on the scene. Its tone and pattern control helped reduce reverberation. Many RCA ribbon models are still in use and valued by engineers.|$|E
25|$|Even {{minor changes}} in the weather, {{physical}} layout or even bumping the chassis containing the tunable capacitors can cause the tuning to vary. For this reason a variety of systems were used to decrease {{the sensitivity of the}} radiogoniometer to mis-tuning. Primary among these was the aperiodic aerial concept, which described the mechanical layout of the radiogoniometer's internal wiring. By winding the sense coil wiring around a vertical cylinder, and wiring the <b>field</b> <b>coils</b> in a similar arrangement {{as close as possible to}} the sense coil, the entire circuit became capacitively coupled. A single tunable capacitor on the output from the sense coil could then be used to tune the entire system.|$|E

50|$|While now uncommon, <b>field</b> <b>coil</b> {{loudspeakers}} {{were once}} common in top quality mantel radios and similar domestic audio applications, {{particularly in the}} post-war period of World War II. In these appliances the <b>field</b> <b>coil</b> of the loudspeaker was also used as the main or only filter choke in the high tension power supply to the valve anodes.|$|R
25|$|Since the <b>field</b> <b>coils</b> were {{connected}} to the antennae electrically, they could be placed anywhere, and their size was independent of the wavelength. This meant that RDF could now be performed on longest wavelengths with ease, using antennae of any size. For longwave use, the two crossed antennae could be easily built by running four wires from a single mast to the ground to form triangular shapes. When used with shorter wavelengths, the system of two crossed loop antennae {{proved to be more}} mechanically robust than a single rotating one. They had the added advantage that the antennae could be placed almost anywhere; earlier systems often included some sort of remote operation through a mechanical linkage, but this limited the placement of the antenna or receiver room.|$|E
2500|$|The 18 {{toroidal}} <b>field</b> <b>coils</b> {{will also}} use niobium-tin. At their maximum field strength of 11.8 teslas, {{they will be}} able to store 41 gigajoules. They have been tested at a record 80 kA. Other lower field ITER magnets (PF and CC) will use niobium-titanium for their superconducting elements. [...] As of now the in-wall shielding blocks to protect the magnets from high energy neutrons are being manufactured and transported from the Avasarala technologies in Bangalore India to the ITER center.|$|E
2500|$|In the {{electrical}} and computer industry ultrasonic welding {{is often used}} to join wired connections and to create connections in small, delicate circuits. [...] Junctions of wire harnesses are often joined using ultrasonic welding. Wire harnesses are large groupings of wires used to distribute electrical signals and power. [...] Electric motors, <b>field</b> <b>coils,</b> transformers and capacitors may also be assembled with ultrasonic welding. It is also often preferred in the assembly of storage media such as flash drives and computer disks because of the high volumes required. [...] Ultrasonic welding of computer disks has been found to have cycle times of less than 300ms.|$|E
50|$|Continuous {{speed control}} of a {{universal}} motor running on AC is easily obtained by use of a thyristor circuit, while multiple taps on the <b>field</b> <b>coil</b> provide (imprecise) stepped speed control. Household blenders that advertise many speeds frequently combine a <b>field</b> <b>coil</b> with several taps and a diode that can be inserted in series with the motor (causing the motor to run on half-wave rectified AC).|$|R
50|$|The {{magnetic}} path {{is characterized by}} poles, locations at equal angles around the rotor at which the magnetic field lines pass from stator to rotor or vice versa. The stator (and rotor) are classified {{by the number of}} poles they have. Most arrangements use one <b>field</b> <b>coil</b> per pole. Some older or simpler arrangements use a single <b>field</b> <b>coil</b> with a pole at each end.|$|R

2500|$|Another {{electromechanical}} {{instrument is}} the polarized-vane type. In this instrument a stationary field coil produces a rotating magnetic field, {{just like a}} polyphase motor. The <b>field</b> <b>coils</b> are connected either directly to polyphase voltage sources or to a phase-shifting reactor if a single-phase application. [...] A second stationary field coil, perpendicular to the voltage coils, carries a current proportional to current in one phase of the circuit. The moving system of the instrument consists of two vanes that are magnetized by the current coil. In operation the moving vanes take up a physical angle equivalent to the electrical angle between the voltage source and the current source. This type of instrument {{can be made to}} register for currents in both directions, giving a four-quadrant display of power factor or phase angle.|$|E
2500|$|Placing the {{throttle}} {{into the first}} power position will cause the traction motors {{to be connected to}} the main generator and the latter's <b>field</b> <b>coils</b> to be excited. With excitation applied, the main generator will deliver electricity to the traction motors, resulting in motion. If the locomotive is running [...] "light" [...] (that is, not coupled to the rest of a train) and is not on an ascending grade, it will easily accelerate. On the other hand, if a long train is being started, the locomotive may stall as soon as some of the slack has been taken up, as the drag imposed by the train will exceed the tractive force being developed. An experienced engine driver will be able to recognize an incipient stall and will gradually advance {{the throttle}} as required to maintain the pace of acceleration.|$|E
2500|$|Modern driver magnets {{are almost}} always {{permanent}} and made of ceramic, ferrite, Alnico, or, more recently, rare earth such as neodymium and samarium cobalt. Electrodynamic drivers were often used in musical instrument amplifier/speaker cabinets well into the 1950s; [...] there were economic savings in those using tube amplifiers as the field coil could, and usually did, do double duty as a power supply choke. A trend in design — due to increases in transportation costs and a desire for smaller, lighter devices (as in many home theater multi-speaker installations) — {{is the use of}} the last instead of heavier ferrite types. Very few manufacturers still produce electrodynamic loudspeakers with electrically powered <b>field</b> <b>coils,</b> as was common in the earliest designs; [...] one of the last is a French firm. When high field-strength permanent magnets became available after WWII, Alnico, an alloy of aluminum, nickel, and cobalt became popular, since it dispensed with the problems of field-coil drivers. Alnico was used almost exclusively until about 1980, despite the embarrassing problem of Alnico magnets being partially degaussed (i.e., demagnetized) by accidental 'pops' or 'clicks' caused by loose connections, especially if used with a high-power amplifier. The damage can be reversed by [...] "recharging" [...] the magnet, but this requires uncommon specialist equipment and knowledge.|$|E

5000|$|By 1943, a {{prototype}} was rapidly developed with off-the-shelf LMCO components. The LF {{portion of the}} driver was developed by taking the <b>field</b> <b>coil</b> motor from the LMCO 287 compression driver and using it to drive the cone from one of LMCO's 15" [...] LF drivers with a 2" [...] voice coil. Both were mounted on a stamped steel frame. An LMCO 801 <b>field</b> <b>coil</b> compression driver with a 1.75" [...] diaphragm was used as is for HF reproduction and mounted coaxially {{to the back of}} the 287 motor. A horn throat from the 801 penetrated the center of the LF <b>field</b> <b>coil</b> and exited into a small multicellular horn mounted in front of the LF cone. The horn was designed with a cut-off frequency of 900 Hz and the system was set with a crossover frequency of 1200 Hz.|$|R

In a separately excited (sepex) motor the <b>field</b> <b>coils</b> are supplied from an independent source, such as a motor-generator and the field current is unaffected by changes in the armature current.
