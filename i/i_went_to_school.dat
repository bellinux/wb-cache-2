[...] In 1984, he earned his bachelor's degree in natural-resource {{planning}} and interpretation, with an emphasis in marine resources. He intended to take a master's degree, but {{said it would be}} in art: [...] "Initially I think I assumed that if <b>I</b> <b>went</b> <b>to</b> <b>school</b> for art I would never have any way of making a living, so I thought it might be smarter to keep art my passion and hobby and study something else. But by the time I got to the end of my undergrad work, I realized I should be in art." ...|$|E

500|$|Gallagher {{has spoken}} about his {{political}} views on several occasions, most notably {{when he visited}} Tony Blair at No. 10 Downing Street in 1997. In an interview in 1997 {{when he was asked}} about why he visited Blair he replied, [...] "I've taken a lot of flack for going to No. 10 Downing Street but the thing about that is, I never considered myself a rebel anyway. I wasn't going there representing the 'Indie community'. I wasn't representing anyone. I was going there for me. You have to understand that from when <b>I</b> <b>went</b> <b>to</b> <b>school</b> and from when I was born all we ever knew was conservative, Tory, right-wing government. What people don't mention is, they say 'He went to meet Tony Blair.' No. I went to meet the Labour prime minister. Our parents always drummed into us that the Labour Party was for the people and the Tory Party was not. I went to meet the Labour prime minister." ...|$|E

2500|$|Lott {{was born}} in Grenada, Mississippi, and lived his early years in nearby Duck Hill, where his father, Chester Paul Lott, sharecropped a stretch of cotton field. [...] Lott's mother, the former Iona Watson, was a schoolteacher. [...] When Lott was in the sixth grade, {{the family moved to}} Pascagoula, where Lott's father worked at a shipyard. [...] Lott {{attended}} college at the University of Mississippi in Oxford, where he obtained an undergraduate degree in public administration in 1963 and a J.D. degree in 1967. He served as a field representative for Ole Miss and was president of his fraternity, Sigma Nu. Lott was also an Ole Miss cheerleader, on the same team with future U.S. Senator Thad Cochran. [...] Regarding his education, the Congressional Record from 1999 quotes Senator Lott declaring: [...] "I am a product of public education from the first grade through the second, third, and fourth grades where <b>I</b> <b>went</b> <b>to</b> <b>school</b> at Duck Hill, Mississippi, and I had better teachers in the second, third, and fourth grades in Duck Hill, Mississippi, than I had the rest of my life." [...] Lott married Patricia Thompson on December 27, 1964. The couple has two children: Chester Trent [...] "Chet" [...] Lott Jr., and Tyler Lott.|$|E
2500|$|Burgess {{has said}} of his largely solitary childhood: [...] "I was either distractedly persecuted or ignored. I was one despised.... Ragged boys in gangs would pounce on the well-dressed like myself." [...] He {{attended}} St. Edmund's Elementary School {{before moving on to}} Bishop Bilsborrow Memorial Elementary School, both Catholic schools, in Moss Side. He later reflected: [...] "When <b>I</b> <b>went</b> <b>to</b> <b>school</b> I was able to read. At the Manchester elementary school I attended, most of the children could not read, so I was... a little apart, rather different from the rest." [...] Good grades resulted in a place at Xaverian College (1928–37). As a young child he did not care about music, until he heard on his home-built radio [...] "a quite incredible flute solo", which he characterised as [...] "sinuous, exotic, erotic," [...] and became spellbound. Eight minutes later the announcer told him he had been listening to Prélude à l'après-midi d'un faune by Claude Debussy. He referred to this as a [...] "psychedelic moment... a recognition of verbally inexpressible spiritual realities." [...] When Burgess announced to his family {{that he wanted to be}} a composer, they objected as [...] "there was no money in it." [...] Music was not taught at his school, but at about age 14 he taught himself to play the piano. Burgess had originally hoped to study music at university, but the music department at the Victoria University of Manchester turned down his application because of poor grades in physics. So instead he studied English language and literature there between 1937 and 1940, graduating with a Bachelor of Arts. His thesis concerned Marlowe's Doctor Faustus, and he graduated with an upper second-class honours, which he found disappointing. When grading one of Burgess's term papers, the historian A. J. P. Taylor, wrote: [...] "Bright ideas insufficient to conceal lack of knowledge." ...|$|E
