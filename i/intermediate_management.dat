40|$|Several {{solutions}} {{have been}} proposed for mobility management in IP based heterogeneous networks, working at different protocol levels, from layer 2 up to application level. In order to take the handover decision, many solutions require to monitor {{the performance of the}} heterogeneous networks to which the mobile device is connected. Measuring the physical or link level performance on a given wireless access networks does not provide a reliable indication of the perceived level of service when the application flows are handed over that wireless access network. It is therefore needed to take measurements at IP level, on the (bidirectional) path from the Mobile Host to an intermediate node handling the mobility or even to the remote Correspondent Host. Gathering such measurements in a timely, effective and efficient way is not an easy task. In this paper we show that a naïve approach using application level active measurements is highly CPU intensive. This would severely impact battery usage in Mobile Hosts and does not scale if <b>intermediate</b> mobility <b>management</b> nodes are involved. On the contrary we show that an implementation of active measurements in the Linux kernel has a very low CPU usage. In this approach an efficient use of batteries in Mobile Host can be achieved and <b>intermediate</b> mobility <b>management</b> nodes can scale up to monitoring thousands of flows towards Mobile Hosts. Finally we discuss how combining passive and active measurements could further improve the solution...|$|R

40|$|Objective. To {{evaluate}} long-term {{effectiveness and}} safety of conservative and minimally invasive outpatient treatments for female stress urinary incontinence (SUI) through {{a review of the}} literature. Methods. PubMed was searched for reports on prospective clinical trials with at least 12 -month follow-up of minimally invasive treatments, pelvic floor rehabilitation, or pharmacotherapy in women with SUI. Each report was examined for long-term rates of effectiveness and safety. Results. Thirty-two clinical trial reports were included. Prospective long-term studies of pelvic floor rehabilitation were limited but indicated significant improvements with treatment adherence for at least 12 months. Poor initial tolerability with duloxetine resulted in substantial discontinuation. Most patients receiving transurethral radiofrequency collagen denaturation or urethral bulking agents reported significant long-term improvements, generally good tolerability, and safety. Conclusions. Conservative therapy is an appropriate initial approach for female SUI, but if therapy fails, radiofrequency collagen denaturation or bulking agents may be an attractive <b>intermediate</b> <b>management</b> step or alternative to surgery...|$|E

In this paper we consider the impact that statistically multi-plexing heterogeneous services on VP connections will have on network design and management.

Given two traffic types with different quality of service requirements, should one segre-gate such flows on their own VPS, or is it to the network’s advantage to multiplex the flows on a single VP guarantee-ing the most stringent QoS requirement? Assuming two VPs have been set up between a given origin-destination pair and heterogeneous flows are to be carried, how should one route the connections to achieve good performance?...|$|R
40|$|AbstractThe {{economic}} benefit of crossbreeding {{has been well}} known for many years within dairy production. However, in most countries with an intensive dairy production, an extended use of systematic crossbreeding has not occurred. This {{may be due to}} the myth that heterosis is expressed mainly in low-producing herds. The aim of the study was to investigate the effect of heterosis with different management levels in Danish Jersey herds. More than 300, 000 records of 305 -d milk, fat, and protein yield from first-lactation Danish Jersey cows with different contributions from original Danish and US Jersey were analyzed using an animal model. The herds were distributed in 5 management groups based on production level. First, the results showed a large increase in additive genetic variance from the herds with lowest production level to the high-producing ones, and second, heterosis for all 3 production traits were lowest within the low-intensity management group and tended to be highest in the <b>intermediate</b> <b>management</b> groups. The results, therefore, support that crossbreeding is a breeding system that should be considered valuable for all management levels...|$|E

Ammonia oxidizer diversity within each grassland soil {{was assessed by}} PCR amplification of microbial community DNA with both ammonia oxidizer-specific, 16 S rRNA gene (rDNA) and functional, amoA, gene primers. PCR products were analysed by denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis, phylogenetic analysis of partial 16 S rDNA and amoA sequences, and hybridization with ammonia oxidizer-specific oligonucleotide probes. Ammonia oxidizer populations in unimproved soils were more diverse than those in improved soils and were dominated by organisms representing Nitrosospira clusters 1 and 3 and Nitrosomonas cluster 7 (closely related phylogenetically to Nitrosomonas europaea). Improved soils were only dominated by Nitrosospira cluster 3 and Nitrosomonas cluster 7. These differences {{were also reflected in}} functional gene (amoA) diversity, with amoA gene sequences of both Nitrosomonas and Nitrosospira species detected. Replicate 0. 5 -g samples of unimproved soil demonstrated significant spatial heterogeneity in 16 S rDNA-defined ammonia oxidizer clusters, which was reflected in heterogeneity in ammonium concentration and pH. Heterogeneity in soil characteristics and ammonia oxidizer diversity were lower in improved soils. The results therefore demonstrate significant effects of soil managemen...|$|E
