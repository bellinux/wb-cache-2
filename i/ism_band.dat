25|$|The Paradigm system {{consists}} of two basic parts: an insulin pump and an optional glucose sensor CGM worn for up to 3 days. The disposable sensor is subcutaneously-placed to make glucose measurements in interstitial fluid every 5 minutes and transmit the reading via {{low power radio frequency}} (<b>ISM</b> <b>band)</b> to the pump for realtime display. However, insulin therapy may be conducted without CGM and although there is not yet an automated insulin-regulation feedback mechanism between measure and infusion to control the amount and timing of insulin, this is clearly a future objective. So any change in basal or bolus is patient-driven by programming the pump using the Bolus WizardTM. The latest model pumps are the MiniMed Paradigm 522 and 722 which differ in reservoir size, 176 versus 300 units, respectively. In 2007 the FDA approved a pediatric model for patients 7 to 17 years old.|$|E
25|$|The {{microwave}} frequencies used in microwave ovens are chosen based on regulatory and cost constraints. The {{first is that}} they should be in one of the industrial, scientific, and medical (ISM) frequency bands set aside for non-communication purposes. For household purposes, 2.45 GHz has the advantage over 915 MHz in that 915 MHz is only an <b>ISM</b> <b>band</b> in the ITU Region 2 while 2.45 GHz is available worldwide. Three additional ISM bands exist in the {{microwave frequencies}}, but are not used for microwave cooking. Two of them are centered on 5.8 GHz and 24.125 GHz, but are not used for microwave cooking because of the very high cost of power generation at these frequencies. The third, centered on 433.92 MHz, is a narrow band that would require expensive equipment to generate sufficient power without creating interference outside the band, and is only available in some countries.|$|E
2500|$|In 2014, {{networking}} to meters {{is rapidly}} changing. [...] The most common schemes seem to combine an existing national standard for data (e.g. ANSI C12.19 or IEC 62056) operating {{via the internet}} protocol with a small circuit board for powerline communication, or a digital radio for a mobile phone network, or an <b>ISM</b> <b>band.</b>|$|E
50|$|Wireless LANs and {{cordless}} phones {{can also use}} bands other than those shared with ISM, but such uses require approval on a country by country basis. DECT phones use allocated spectrum outside the <b>ISM</b> <b>bands</b> that differs in Europe and North America. Ultra-wideband LANs require more spectrum than the <b>ISM</b> <b>bands</b> can provide, so the relevant standards such as IEEE 802.15.4a are designed {{to make use of}} spectrum outside the <b>ISM</b> <b>bands.</b> Despite the fact that these additional bands are outside the official ITU-R <b>ISM</b> <b>bands,</b> because they are used for the same types of low power personal communications, they are sometimes incorrectly referred to as <b>ISM</b> <b>bands</b> as well.|$|R
30|$|In our {{spectrum}} access scheduling approach, {{we address}} the problems in sharing the <b>ISM</b> <b>bands</b> between the discussed heterogeneous wireless systems. Such a choice presents both convenience and feasibility reasons. <b>ISM</b> <b>bands</b> are free and do not require RF license granted by the FCC, and many IEEE standards operate over the <b>ISM</b> <b>bands.</b> Plus, offering wireless services to cheap wireless handset also presents experimental and lucrative opportunities to the system developers.|$|R
50|$|The <b>ISM</b> <b>bands</b> {{are defined}} by the ITU Radio Regulations (article 5) in {{footnotes}} 5.138, 5.150, and 5.280 of the Radio Regulations. Individual countries' use of the bands designated in these sections may differ due to variations in national radio regulations. Because communication devices using the <b>ISM</b> <b>bands</b> must tolerate any interference from ISM equipment, unlicensed operations are typically permitted to use these bands, since unlicensed operation typically needs to be tolerant of interference from other devices anyway. The <b>ISM</b> <b>bands</b> share allocations with unlicensed and licensed operations; however, due to the high likelihood of harmful interference, licensed use of the bands is typically low. In the United States, uses of the <b>ISM</b> <b>bands</b> are governed by Part 18 of the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) rules, while Part 15 contains the rules for unlicensed communication devices, even those that share ISM frequencies. In Europe, the ETSI is responsible for governing <b>ISM</b> <b>bands.</b>|$|R
