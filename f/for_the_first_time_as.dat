5|$|Allied {{aircraft}} specifically started targeting ZNDH and Luftwaffe {{bases and}} aircraft <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>time</b> <b>as</b> {{a result of}} the Seventh anti-Partisan Offensive, including Operation Rösselsprung in late May 1944. Until then Axis aircraft could fly inland almost at will as long as they remained at low altitude. Partisan units on the ground frequently complained about enemy aircraft attacking them while hundreds of Allied aircraft flew above at higher altitude. This changed during Rösselsprung as Allied fighter-bombers went low en-masse for the first time, establishing full aerial superiority. Consequently, both the ZNDH and Luftwaffe were forced to limit their operations in clear weather to early morning and late afternoon hours.|$|E
5|$|Colleen and Suzanne Dengel, {{the twins}} who played Miranda's daughters, were cast {{two weeks after}} auditioning for Frankel and Finerman.

5|$|Following {{repeated}} heavy bombing by Allied forces during Operation Crossbow, the Germans {{were unable}} to complete the construction works and the complex never entered service. It was captured by the Allies in September 1944, partially demolished on the orders of Winston Churchill to prevent its reuse as a military base, and then abandoned. It remained derelict until the mid-1990s. In 1997 it {{opened to the public}} <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>time,</b> <b>as</b> a museum. Exhibits in the tunnels and under the dome {{tell the story of the}} German occupation of France during World War II, the V-weapons and the history of space exploration.|$|E

Specter ran for reelection in 2010, <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>time</b> <b>as</b> a Democrat, but was defeated in the Primary.|$|E

Tyrion is quick to disabuse Jon of his romantic notions of the Watch as a noble calling battling the mythical horrors beyond the Wall (as it was in history), {{pointing}} out that now it is more a dumping ground for the unwanted of Westeros: criminals, prisoners, and bastards.|$|E
5|$|The 1885–86 {{season was}} the eighth {{season in the}} history of West Bromwich Albion Football Club. In what was their inaugural season as a {{professional}} club, Albion moved to the Stoney Lane ground after leaving their previous home at Four Acres. The team also changed the colour of its kit, wearing blue and white striped jerseys <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>time.</b> <b>As</b> league football had not been introduced in England at the time, the team competed solely in cup competitions and friendly matches throughout the season, playing 52 matches in total.|$|E

As many as 150 police officers were on duty during the Bonfire burning from the Texas A and College Station police departments and the Texas Alcoholic Beverage Commission.|$|E

5|$|The Democratic Party Tammany Hall {{political}} machine {{had been working}} to enroll immigrants as U.S. citizens so they could vote in local elections and had strongly recruited Irish, most of whom already spoke English.

In New York City and other locations, new citizens learned {{they were expected to}} register for the draft to fight for their new country. Black men were excluded from the draft as they were largely not considered citizens, and wealthier white men could pay for substitutes.|$|E

5|$|The rediscovery and {{reconstruction}} of Borobudur has been hailed by Indonesian Buddhist as {{the sign of}} the Buddhist revival in Indonesia. In 1934, Narada Thera, a missionary monk from Sri Lanka, visited Indonesia <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>time</b> <b>as</b> part of his journey to spread the Dharma in Southeast Asia. This opportunity was used by a few local Buddhists to revive Buddhism in Indonesia. A bodhi tree planting ceremony was held in Southeastern side of Borobudur on 10 March 1934 under the blessing of Narada Thera, and some Upasakas were ordained as monks. Once a year, thousands of Buddhist from Indonesia and neighboring countries flock to Borobudur to commemorate national Vesak ceremony.|$|E
