40|$|High strength, cold rolled, {{corrosion}} resistant ZINCALUME™ (ZA) and ZINC-HIT EN™ (ZHT) G 550 sheet steels {{are widely used}} in the construction and automotive industries. The sheet steel is commonly joined by {{gas metal arc welding}} (GMAW) because of its low cost and high productivity. However, two significant problems can occur: porosity in the weld bead and loss of strength in the heat affected zone (HAZ). As a result of the strength loss, the design strength is currently down-graded to the fully annealed yield strength (250 or 300 MPa). The full strength potential of the steels cannot be utilised unless the strength loss in the HAZ can be quantified. In this investigation the microstructures and mechanical properties of the weld and HAZ of gas metal arc welding and flux cored arc welding (FCAW) welded ZA and ZHT G 550 1. 0 mm sheet steels have been studied and the strength loss in the HAZ has been quantified. A major aim was to correlate the mechanical properties with HAZ microstructure and to correlate microstructure with the weld thermal cycle. The effect of welding process variables on the HAZ microstructure, the structure and composition of the weld metal and on the Zn alloy coating have been investigated. HAZ thermal simulations were used to elucidate the structure evolution in the actual weld HAZ. As expected, the reduction in HAZ mechanical properties is dependent on the heat input. After GMAW at the highest heat input of 130 J/mm the tensile strength of Zn-Al coated steel decreased to 460 MPa (with a yield strength of 400 Mpa) from a pre-weld minimum specified longitudinal tensile strength of 550 MPa. However, a lower decrease in tensile strength to about 520 MPa (with a yield strength of 505 MPa) occurred at the lowest heat input of 50 J/mm. All tensile pieces were fractured in the grain refined region closed to the grain coarsened region of the HAZ. Although the microstructure of the HAZ was successfully simulated, the simulated HAZ had a much lower tensile strength than the real welds at similar heat inputs due to the absence of the 2 ̆ 7 brazing effect 2 ̆ 7 or 2 ̆ 7 two phase aggregate effect 2 ̆ 7 present in the real welds. It was found that at the same nominal heat input the strength of the welded joint is significantly affected by individual welding parameters, particularly, torch angle, shielding gas and welding consumable. At the same nominal heat input FCAW generated welds with a lower tensile strength than GMAW. GMAW using perpendicular and <b>forehand</b> <b>welding</b> techniques tended to produce welds with a higher tensile strength than the backhand technique. A higher strength loss was also evident for GMAW with pure C 02 or a shielding gas containing helium. No obvious macro-defects or Zn penetration cracks were found in the weld bead or HAZ. However, gas pores and aluminum rich particles were observed in the weld metal. These features did not adversely affect the overall weldment tensile properties. A more globular weld bead with a higher surface tension, corresponding to a lower oxygen content in the weld metal, was found for GMA welds shielded by Argoshield 60 (98. 5...|$|E
