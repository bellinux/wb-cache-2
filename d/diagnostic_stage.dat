40|$|Human African trypanosomiasis (HAT), {{also known}} as {{sleeping}} sickness, {{continues to be a}} major hazard to human health in 36 countries in sub-Saharan Africa. One of the most important problems in disease management is the considerable difficulty in distinguishing the early (hemolymphatic) from the late (encephalitic) stage when the parasites have crossed the blood-brain barrier to enter the Central Nervous System (CNS). Treatment of the two stages is different with the highly toxic arsenical drug melarsoprol being the most commonly used therapy for CNS disease. Since melarsoprol kills 5 % of treated patients, it is vital to develop reliable and agreed <b>diagnostic</b> <b>staging</b> markers for HAT.

40|$|In {{this paper}} a three-stage {{approach}} consisting of attribute extraction, attribute evaluation and a <b>diagnostic</b> <b>stage</b> for monitoring and diagnosis of technical systems is presented. An {{important feature of}} this approach is the efficient adaptation of a diagnostic result to changing attribute values. This results in a faster diagnostic process especially at the onset of a failure, because the <b>diagnostic</b> <b>stage</b> can be started immediately rather than waiting for the attribute values to stabilize. Based on this concept, a monitoring and diagnosis system is presently being developed for the on-board systems of a transport aircraft. The fast and efficient computation of the diagnostic result is of decisive importance for this application. The three-stage concept is easily transferable to other technical systems, as long as failure models of the monitored system exist and results of periodic measurements are available. (orig.)

40|$|A {{knowledge}} based {{model of a}} three stage-approach for online monitoring and diagnosis of technical systems is presented. The stages are attribute extraction, attribute evaluation and a <b>diagnostic</b> <b>stage.</b> The explicit consideration of many relations between failure assumptions and combinations of attributes can be avoided by using a heterarchy instead of a strict hierarchy to structure the failure assumptions. Fuzzy logic enables the modelling of uncertainty in the monitoring and diagnostic knowledge. These extensions of the set covering approach simplify the modelling of diagnostic knowledge. In relation to other known approaches the essential new feature of the presented algorithms, however, is the adaptation of a previous diagnostic result to all possible changes of attribute values, i. e. not only to newly occurred symptoms. This results in an acceleration of the <b>diagnostic</b> <b>stage</b> {{because it can be}} started as soon as first hints for a failure have occurred. It is not necessary to wait for the attribute values to stabilise. Therefore the interaction between monitoring and diagnosis is not limited to a simple start of the <b>diagnostic</b> <b>stage,</b> but a coupling of the diagnostic result to the monitored attributes exists. The knowledge about attributes, failure assumptions etc. is inserted into a data base by using a knowledge acquisition tool and is automatically transformed into C++ code. The applicability of the approach is demonstrated with monitoring and diagnostic systems for selected on-board systems of a transport aircraft, for a robot, being used in the German spacelab mission D- 2, and by a system for classifying intentions of air traffic controllers.

40|$|Background: Some studies {{suggested}} that colorectal cancer at young age had a distinct biological characteristic: more advanced stage {{at time of}} diagnosis, poorer differentiated, and consisted of large proportion of mucin producing tumors. Aim of the study: To analyze clinical and histopathological differences between young aged colorectal cancer patients (< 40 years old) and the older patients Methods: A cross-sectional retrospective study was conducted among our colorectal cancer patients in a general hospital between 1999 - 2004, using C. 18, C. 19, C 20 ICD X code in medical record searching. It was requested that the patients had surgical treatment in Dr. Sardjito General Hospital. An inconclusive clinical staging and/or histological data were among the exclusion criteria. Chi-square, Fisher 2 ̆ 7 s exact test, T-test, and Mann Whitney U-test was performed to analyze the difference between patients < 40 years old and ³ 40 years old, in respect to <b>diagnostic</b> <b>staging,</b> histological type, histological grade (differentiation), CEA level, hemoglobin, albumin, tumor location, and chief complain. With p < 0. 05 was considered as significant. Results: Sixteen young aged (< 40 years old) and 72 older patients had been identified. No differences in gender proportion and mean of symptoms to diagnosis period between two groups. No statistical differences between young aged and the older patients in <b>diagnostic</b> <b>staging,</b> histological grade and type, CEA level, and hemoglobin. Young aged patients had higher albumin value at presentation (p = 0. 014), all had left sided tumors (p = 0. 035), more complain of anal pain (p < 0. 001), and less change of bowel habits complain (p = 0. 009) Conclusion: The study results had failed to confirm the difference in respect to <b>diagnostic</b> <b>staging,</b> histological type and grade, CEA level, and hemoglobin.
