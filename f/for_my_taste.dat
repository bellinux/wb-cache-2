500|$|Peter Bradshaw of The Guardian {{gave the}} film a {{negative}} review, likening it to [...] "being mugged {{by a professional}} whose skills in mixed martial arts you can't help but notice and appreciate, even as you are savagely beaten, then dragged upright, bruised and bleeding, and forced to watch as your assailant gives fully 45% of your money to charity." [...] Christy Lemire writing for Roger Ebert's website gave it two stars out of four and criticized the film for being [...] "emotionally inert, despite its many moments that are meant to put a lump in our throats." [...] Lemire criticized Elgort's performance and praised Woodley's [...] "abiding, disarming naturalism." [...] Robbie Collin writing for The Daily Telegraph said: [...] "Gus {{is something of a}} manic pixie dreamboat: the lesser-spotted male version of the kooky, adoring girlfriend-type sometimes played by Kirsten Dunst, Natalie Portman, and Zooey Deschanel." [...] David Edelstein of NPR said: I know people who cried at the trailer of the romantic teen cancer movie The Fault in Our Starsat the movie they'll need a life preserver to keep from drowning in a flood of tears. Me, I didn't cry, though at times my tear ducts tingled; I was on the verge. The film is a little slick <b>for</b> <b>my</b> <b>taste,</b> too engineered. But it's gently directed by Josh Boone and beautifully acted. Whatever the faults, it's not in the stars. Shalini Langer of The Indian Express gave the film {{two and a half stars}} and said: [...] "The film is faithful to a fault from the dialogues to the clothes, the setting and the food, even while skipping over some of the unpleasant details." [...] Dana Stevens writing for Slate Magazine said: [...] "What in the name of God is wrong with me that I didn't cry onceI, who just the day before wept through the entirety of my child's thoroughly upbeat school play." ...|$|E
2500|$|Donald Knuth, {{who said}} of Edsger Dijkstra that [...] "to think of {{programming}} in C++" [...] "would make him physically ill", corroborates Thompson: [...] The problem that I have with them today is that... C++ is too complicated. At the moment, it's {{impossible for me}} to write portable code that I believe would work on lots of different systems, unless I avoid all exotic features. Whenever the C++ language designers had two competing ideas as to how they should solve some problem, they said [...] "OK, we'll do them both". So the language is too baroque <b>for</b> <b>my</b> <b>taste.</b>|$|E
2500|$|Ellen Burstyn {{was still}} in the midst of filming The Exorcist when Warner Bros. {{executives}} expressed interest in working with her on another project. Burstyn later recalled, [...] "It was early in the woman's movement, and we were all just waking up and having a look at the pattern of our lives and wanting it to be different… I wanted to make a different kind of film. A film from a woman's point of view, but a woman that I recognized, that I knew. And not just myself, but my friends, what we were all going through at the time. So my agent found Alice Doesn't Live Here Anymore… When I read it I liked it a lot. I sent it to Warner Brothers and they agreed to do it. Then they asked who I wanted to direct it. I said that I didn't know, but I wanted somebody new and young and exciting. I called Francis Coppola and asked who was young and exciting and he said 'Go look at a movie called Mean Streets and see what you think.' It hadn't been released yet, so I booked a screening to look at it and I felt that it was exactly what…Alice needed, because [...] was a wonderful script and well written, but <b>for</b> <b>my</b> <b>taste</b> it was a little slick. You know – in a good way, in a kind of Doris Day–Rock Hudson kind of way. I wanted something a bit more gritty." ...|$|E

60|$|I {{sat up in}} bed, and {{my first}} thought as I looked round the {{handsome}} room--which I had rented a week ago upon receiving the lieutenancy in the Cardinal's guards--was for the position that I had lost and of the need {{that there would be}} ere long to seek a lodging more humble and better suited to my straitened circumstances. It was not without regret that such a thought came to me, <b>for</b> <b>my</b> <b>tastes</b> had never been modest, and the house was a fine one, situated in the Rue St. Antoine at a hundred paces or so from the Jesuit convent.|$|R
5000|$|One of Greg's notable {{relationships}} {{was with}} Laura Avery (Constance McCashin) who became his second wife. Devane described this as his favorite story and {{spoke of his}} co-star Constance McCashin: [...] "I liked the Laura story. The whole thing. Constance is very smart and very quick {{so it was a}} joy to work with her. Our dynamic had elements of Tracy and Hepburn in it. At times {{we were able to do}} sophisticated comedy and I would have liked to do more of that. Not enough <b>for</b> <b>my</b> <b>tastes,</b> but when we did it, it worked well". [...] Greg also had on and off again affair with Paige Matheson, and short marriages to Abby Cunningham and Anne Matheson.|$|R
2500|$|Rating {{the film}} 4/5 stars, Eye for Film commented that [...] "Of all the {{films in the}} Texas Chainsaw series, this is {{probably}} the least gory, a fact that will no doubt disappoint some fans. It certainly has its moments and those disturbed by gore should still approach it with caution, but it's nothing like as gratuitous as much of what has gone before. Events happen to serve the story more than the theme. Horror is found in different places." [...] Staci Wilson of Dread Central wrote that [...] "Not to say I loved Leatherface - It’s far too disgusting <b>for</b> <b>my</b> <b>taste</b> (I'm okay with gore, but there's some gooey necrophilia in this flick that I felt was just thrown in for the ick of it), and there are too many plot holes. Still, it's a very well made film, the cinematography is gorgeous, and the acting is aces across the board", giving a final verdict of 3/5 stars. Anton Bitel of SciFiNow appraised, [...] "In spite, or perhaps because, of all the splatter and excess, this still does not come close to the elusively non-explicit horrors of the original The Texas Chain Saw Massacre, even as it serves as their grim rites of passage. If 'Nobody messes with our family' is the ultimate message, then Maury and Bustillo certainly maintain a respectful continuity to reunite the old clan, as Jed pieces together his future identity from the different influences around him." [...] For being what he called [...] "the most entertaining and pleasing TCM film since 1974's classic", ComingSoon.Net writer Jerry Smith gave the prequel a positive review. He assessed that [...] "Do we really need yet another horror icon origin story and if so, would the explanation be anything we haven't seen before? The answers to these questions are quite refreshing", contrasting the origin story given to that of [...] as having been able to [...] "acknowledge what came before it without ever seeming like a wink-wink to the previous films in the series". V.O.D.zillas Matthew Turner assigned a 6.2 rating, opining [...] "This Texas Chainsaw prequel lacks the original's terror but gets by on style, strong performances and a bucket or two of the red stuff." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "I don't know," [...] {{answered}} Miss Manners, doubtfully, [...] "it {{is rather}} too queer <b>for</b> <b>my</b> <b>taste.</b> Tricks {{are all very}} well, {{but when it comes}} to magic and visions I get frightened." ...|$|E
50|$|CompuServe offers SNIPER!, a European-theater, squad-level, World War II war game. The game can {{be played}} in ASCII, but the text {{characters}} are far too cryptic <b>for</b> <b>my</b> <b>tastes.</b> What makes this game shine is the graphical shell which you can down-load (there's no connect-time fee {{but there is a}} $2 flat fee for the software).The software gives the player a skewed 3-D view of the battlefields (including building interiors), as well as several information windows displaying the status of the game.While the game's control logistics seem a little obtuse at first, you can enter a modified boot camp where you explore all of the various commands. Battles are arranged in the game's meeting area, called the saloon. The games are actually missions with set goals for each side.|$|R
5000|$|In {{reference}} to Elvis's {{admiration for the}} character, Captain Marvel Jr. has often been shown as either a fan of Elvis or having been inspired by Elvis. In Teen Titans (vol. 3) #23, Captain Marvel Jr. is revealed {{to be a huge}} fan of Elvis Presley. The narrator (Superboy) states that [...] "He's okay, just a little too into the retro thing <b>for</b> <b>my</b> <b>tastes.</b> Loves all that rockabilly crap. Flame shirts and hot dice belt buckles." [...] Captain Marvel Jr. himself quotes Elvis, (whom he refers to as [...] "the greatest modern-day philosopher"), with the quote [...] "Do what's right for you as long as you don't hurt no one", to which Hawk immediately states that she likes Sex Pistols bass guitarist Sid Vicious better as a role-model.|$|R
5000|$|The Current {{reviewing}} the album wrote, [...] "I thought she leaned too adult-contemporary <b>for</b> <b>my</b> <b>tastes.</b> Boy, was I wrong! This might be her most rockin' album to date. The album starts {{like a house}} afire: Carlile totally nails the vocal on the gospel influenced [...] "Wherever is Your Heart," [...] and this one makes you realize just how good she is. When she sings, you're a believer. She'll have you singing along on the infectious [...] "The Thing I Regret". Maybe the biggest surprise on the album is [...] "Mainstream Kid," [...] which shows some grit! It's as badass as Carlile has ever sounded. If you had Brandi Carlile pegged as an adult-contemporary softie, you might try again. Brandi Carlile and the Hanseroth twins show that they aren't afraid to rock out. The Firewatcher's Daughter is a bold and welcome addition to her catalogue." [...] USA Today wrote, [...] "The Firewatcher's Daughter is an album with a big heart, one that responds with love, not fear." ...|$|R

6000|$|... "It {{is these}} strong cases which get a man under, {{as it might}} be, and almost alter his nature.

60|$|I {{had just}} become a medical man, but I had not started in practice, and I lived in rooms in Gower Street. The street has been renumbered since then, {{but it was}} in the only house which has a bow-window, upon the {{left-hand}} side as you go down from the Metropolitan Station. A widow named Murchison kept the house at that time, and she had three medical students and one engineer as lodgers. I occupied the top room, which was the cheapest, but cheap as it was it was more than I could afford. My small resources were dwindling away, and every week it became more necessary that I should find something to do. Yet I was very unwilling to go into general practice, <b>for</b> <b>my</b> <b>tastes</b> were all in the direction of science, and especially of zoology, towards which I had always a strong leaning. I had almost given the fight up and resigned myself to being a medical drudge for life, when the turning-point of my struggles came in a very extraordinary way.|$|R
60|$|Don Jose. I am in no {{mood for}} trifling. Hark ye, friend Diego. You have seen, perhaps,--who has not?--that I am a fond, an indulgent father.

6000|$|... "I did not," [...] Gerald declared. [...] "As {{a matter}} of fact, I said so, but my {{objections}} didn't count. I {{might have made a}} good farmer or land-steward, but a number of us had been soldiers and that was enough. I don't know if it was a logical argument, but I had to go, and on the whole it was a relief when they turned me out. Too many regulations <b>for</b> <b>my</b> independent <b>taste!</b> Rules are good, perhaps, so long as they're made for somebody else." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Unhappily, no," [...] I answered, {{with a quiet}} sigh of {{professional}} regret. [...] "That's my one solitary cause of complaint against my native country. It's disgustingly free from volcanic disturbances. Britain is much too solid indeed <b>for</b> <b>my</b> private <b>taste.</b> It affords no scope for an enterprising seismologist. There were some good craters once, to be sure, in geological times, at Mull and Cader Idris, but they're all extinct long since. We haven't a volcano, good, bad, or indifferent, anywhere nearer us than Hecla or Vesuvius." ...|$|R

5000|$|Louisa Mellor of Den of Geek commented, [...] "I'm {{really looking}} forward to seeing what PLL looks like when it isn't holding {{anything}} back. I hope it's ridiculous, and beautiful, and subversive. Just like it's always been." [...] Also on Season 7, she further added: [...] "I complained that the show had lost its flavour, the things that made it different, and become a parody of itself. While I'm not quite retracting that argument, I do feel like season seven has been a marked improvement." [...] G.A. Benitez of Cryptic Rock gave the episode a good review, calling it a [...] "Mid-Season finale to die for." [...] Mark Trammell of TV Equals praised the episode, stating, [...] "While a little too much time was spend on the mid-season finale dealing with all the various ‘ships in play <b>for</b> <b>my</b> <b>tastes,</b> the ending confrontation more than made up for it, and if you’d told me we’d ever see the day that series featured a full-on decapitation, I’d have told you that you were crazier than a roomful of Radley patients, and yet, here it was.
