5|$|Madness in the Fast Lane is the BBC documentary, first {{broadcast}} on BBC One on 10 August 2010, which brought {{the story of}} Sabina and Ursula Eriksson and the killing of Glen Hollinshead into the public consciousness.

5|$|On {{the day of}} the attack, 56 {{heads of}} state were meeting in Algiers for the 4th conference of the Non-Aligned Movement. According to Seale, the Saudi Embassy {{operation}} had been commissioned by Iraq's president, Ahmed Hasan al-Bakr, as a distraction because he was jealous that Algeria was hosting the conference. Seale writes one of the hostage-takers admitted that he <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>told</b> to fly the hostages around until the conference was over.|$|E

On 27 December, at 08:15 GMT, four gunmen opened fire on the El Al ticket counter at the Leonardo Da Vinci International Airport in Rome, killing 16 and wounding 99. In Vienna International Airport a few minutes later, three men threw hand grenades at passengers waiting to check into a flight to Tel Aviv, killing four and wounding 39. According to Seale, the gunmen <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>told</b> the people in civilian clothes at the check-in counter were Israeli pilots returning from a training mission.|$|E
5|$|As an {{illiterate}} child, she <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>told</b> Bible {{stories by}} her mother. The particular variety of her early Christian belief remains unclear, but she acquired a passionate faith in God. She rejected {{the teachings of}} the New Testament that urged slaves to be obedient and found guidance in the Old Testament tales of deliverance. Tubman was devout, and when she began experiencing visions and vivid dreams, she interpreted them as revelations from God. This religious perspective informed her actions throughout her life.|$|E

5|$|By {{the time}} {{pre-production}} {{on the third}} series began, Bullen had grown tired of writing the series single-handedly and believed all the stories that could be told <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>told.</b> ITV were keen {{to increase the number}} of episodes per series to 20 but Granada refused, though did agree to add two more, bringing the total to eight. A writing team of five was assembled, overseen by Bullen. Four of the scriptwriters were deemed not good enough and they parted company with Granada. David Nicholls remained and scripted four of the eight-third series episodes; Bullen wrote the other four and his interest in the series was revived.|$|E
5|$|Charles Darwin <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>told</b> {{that the}} Beagle was {{expected}} to sail {{about the end of}} September 1831, but fitting out took longer. The Admiralty Instructions were received on 14 November, and on 23 November she was moved to anchorage, ready to depart. Repeated Westerly gales caused delays, and forced them to turn back after departing on 10 and 21 December. Drunkenness at Christmas lost another day. Finally, on the morning of 27 December, the Beagle left its anchorage in the Barn Pool, under Mount Edgecumbe {{on the west side of}} Plymouth Sound and set out on its surveying expedition.|$|E

Team manager Colin Egar had advised Warne that he <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>told</b> that the venue was unsavoury, but he was vague in his comments, and at the time, casinos were not perceived as trouble spots or traps for unwary cricketers.|$|E

5|$|Lister {{explained}} {{that she and her}} fellow cast members filmed on many locations, including army barracks. They filmed at Tatenhill Airfield, where staff <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>told</b> to remain secretive about the storyline. She also revealed that she was the only cast member out of her, Batley and Kelly who performed the aired skydiving for real. A Hollyoaks producer released two pictures of funeral wreaths, one reading 'Zoe' and the other 'Sarah', in order to confuse viewers further as to whom the victim would be. On-screen after the skydive and Sarah's subsequent death, Lydia framed Zoe for the murder she committed, leading to her arrest.|$|E
5|$|Local weavers {{specialised}} in {{the production}} of kersey, a hardwearing and inexpensive woollen fabric that was often used for military uniforms; by the 16thcentury Halifax and the surrounding Calder Valley was the largest producer of the material in England. In the final part of the manufacturing process the cloth was hung outdoors on large structures known as tenterframes and left to dry, after having been conditioned by a fulling mill. Daniel Defoe wrote a detailed account of what he <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>told</b> of the gibbet's history during his visit to Halifax in Volume 3 of his A tour thro' the whole island of Great Britain, published in 1727.|$|E

Their destination {{is the home of}} Tyler's mother, whom Tyler <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>told</b> was dead. When the two of them meet, Tyler wants her to run off {{so that they can be}} together again. She refuses, and Tyler becomes enraged at her husband when he returns home.|$|E

5|$|The British {{continued}} their policy of stalling Smith. At {{the end of}} August 1965, they did not consider a Rhodesian UDI an immediate threat, and therefore focussed on the colony's maintained defiance of the mother country regarding Reedman and Lisbon. On 30 August, Johnston summarised Britain's stand on the issue for Bottomley's Commonwealth Relations Office. According to his understanding, he said, Rhodesia <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>told</b> just before Federal dissolution that it would retain the Federation's former powers regarding external affairs, but that this entrustment was subject to British discretion, {{and could not be}} exercised without extensive prior consultation and conformity to Britain's line.|$|E
5|$|The {{attempts}} of the Mortaras {{and their allies}} to identify {{who was supposed to}} have baptised Edgardo quickly bore fruit. After their present servant Anna Facchini adamantly denied any involvement, they considered former employees and soon earmarked Morisi as a possible candidate. In late July 1858 the Mortara home was visited by Ginerva Scagliarini, a friend of Morisi's who had once worked for Marianna's brother-in-law Cesare De Angelis. Marianna's brother Angelo Padovani tested Scagliarini by saying falsely that he had heard it was Morisi who had baptised Edgardo. The ruse worked—Scagliarini said that she <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>told</b> the same thing by Morisi's sister Monica.|$|E
5|$|There was a {{brief period}} when the episode had a {{different}} subplot that revolved around the restaurant chain Planet Hollywood.

The writers of The Simpsons were excited about this so they wrote a new subplot for the episode that featured Planet Hollywood and the three actors. However, for unknown reasons, {{they were unable to}} appear in the episode.|$|E

The Cossor receivers were found to be unusable, weighing as much as the entire transmitter and receiver, and having sensitivity about half that of the EMI lash-up.|$|E
5|$|At 2pm {{on the day}} of announcement, a {{crowd of}} about 100 journalists, supporters, and friends who had {{gathered}} outside the main entrance to the Beijing housing estate where the Lius resided were denied entry. The South China Morning Post reported that policemen stationed inside their apartment {{at the time of the}} announcement prevented Liu Xia from meeting with journalists and other well-wishers. It was not immediately clear whether Liu Xiaobo was aware of the award. By that time, Liu Xia said she <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>told</b> she would be taken to Liaoning to see her husband in prison. Meetings and gatherings to celebrate in several cities were prevented or abruptly broken up by police; one such celebration dinner in Beijing, attended by 20 people, was broken up by police, and the attendees were detained.|$|E
5|$|At RAF Winthorpe the Ju 88s {{attacked}} bombers {{illuminated by}} the landing lights. Leutnant Arnold Döring of IV./NJG 3 engaged and destroyed two bombers between 01:05 and 01:15 using his Schräge Musik. The British crews that witnessed the action switched off their navigation lights {{and he did not}} engage another bomber successfully. Döring <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>told</b> not to return with any ammunition so he engaged any targets of opportunity. He shot up a locomotive and set a wagon on fire. During the ten-minute time-frame Döring had claimed his victories, nine bombers had been destroyed. At 01:05 60 of No. 5 Group's Lancasters were still airborne and further losses were incurred against NJG 5 machines.|$|E
