40|$|<b>Height</b> <b>of</b> <b>instrument</b> (HI) blunders in GPS {{measurements}} cause position errors. These errors can be pure vertical, pure horizontal, or {{a mixture}} of both. There are different error regimes depending on whether both the base and the rover both have HI blunders, if just the base has an HI blunder, or just the rover has an HI blunder. The resulting errors are {{on the order of}} 30 cm for receiver separations of 1000 km for an HI blunder of 2 m. Given the complicated nature of the errors, we believe it would be difficult, if not impossible, to detect such errors by visual inspection. This serves to underline the necessity to enter GPS HI 2 ̆ 7 s correctly...|$|E
40|$|Abstract The {{settlement}} observation usually adopts precision geometric leveling method, {{to improve}} the accuracy, generally requiring the value of central cross-hair {{to be in the}} range of 0. 5 m to 2. 8 m. However, it may easily exceed the range in the regions that have big value of slope. After analyzing, the conclusion is as follow: when the value of slope is certain, we can adjust the <b>height</b> <b>of</b> <b>instrument,</b> sighting distance and distance of slope, so as to make the value of central cross-hair in the range of our requirement. Thus make a compromise of the measurement efficiency and accuracy of measurement. When the values of slope are in the range of 10 degree to 20 degree, the critical values of sighting distance and distance of slope vary greatly. In the process of actual field measurement, combining with the slope acquisition method, taking the critical values of sighting distance and distance of slope as experience values, and it achieves a good effect...|$|E
50|$|A typical {{procedure}} {{is to set}} up the instrument within 100 m of a point of known or assumed elevation. A rod or staff is held vertical on that point and the instrument is used manually or automatically to read the rod scale.

50|$|The setting {{operation}} includes {{fixing the}} theodolite with tripod along with approximate levelling and centering over the station mark. For {{setting up the}} instrument, the tripod is placed over the station with its legs widely spread so that {{the centre of the}} tripod head lies above the station point and its head approximately level (by eye estimation). The instrument is then fixed with the tripod by screwing through trivet. The <b>height</b> <b>of</b> the <b>instrument</b> should be such that observer can see through telescope conveniently. After this, a plumb bob is suspended from the bottom <b>of</b> the <b>instrument</b> and it should be such that plumb bob should point near to the station mark.|$|R

40|$|The {{gravitational}} {{influence of the}} Moon and Sun have a well-known influence on the Earth’s ocean levels: tides. Radar altimeters make precise measurements <b>of</b> the <b>height</b> <b>of</b> the <b>instrument</b> above ground. With a known altimeter orbit and measured altitude, the <b>height</b> <b>of</b> the ocean tide can be measured to centimetric scales. Accounting for the tidal forces from celestial objects {{is an important step}} in finding the residual sea level height. In this paper radar altimeter data from Jason- 2 is used to estimate the magnitude and phase of eight dominant tidal constituents over six study regions. Each constituent is estimated by fitting the data to a Fourier series to estimate tidal magnitue and phase. Accounting for the tidal components selected for this paper largely models the tides, but some residual variance remains. This is attributed to an incomplete tidal model and to measurement and model error...|$|R
40|$|Radar {{backscatter}} {{characteristics of}} sea surfaces depend on many difficult to describe parameters. These parameters include wind speed, incidence {{angle of the}} scatterometer, wind direction, frequency used, <b>height</b> <b>of</b> the <b>instrument</b> above the water, footprint size, and the underlying tilt of the waves themselves among others. An ultrawideband scatterometer named YSCAT 94 gathered six months of data while deployed at the Canada Center for Inland Waters (CCIW) research platform in Lake Ontario. The backscatter distributions for small footprint scatterometers like YSCAT 94 depend on the dominant wavelength of the sea.

The method used to calculate the dominant wave slope from YSCAT 94 data is then presented followed by a conclusion and future directions...|$|R

30|$|Two men and {{two women}} whose ages {{at the time of}} surgery ranged from 14 to 72  years. A supralaminar hook was used as a {{fixation}} device for C 1 in two cases, whereas a lateral mass screw (Tan’s method) and an atlas claw hook were employed for one each of the remaining 2 cases. We retrospectively reviewed the clinical features and postoperative course of these patients using the clinical records. Moreover, we measured the protruding <b>height</b> <b>of</b> the <b>instrument</b> above the atlas as well as the Redlund-Johnell (R-J) value on postoperative radiographs. All patients complained of crepitus and/or pain on neck extension. Erosion in the occipital bone was detected on multiplanar reconstruction computed tomography (MPR-CT), whereas plain radiographs failed to reveal the bony change. In those cases, protruding instruments used for C 1 fixation contacted the occipital bone resulting in an erosive change at the impingement point. We removed the implant in all four cases after confirmation of solid bony union.|$|R
5000|$|Bowed {{instrument}} strings, such as for {{the violin}} or cello, are usually described by tension rather than gauge. Fretted instruments (guitar, banjo, etc.) strings are usually described by gauge—the diameter of the string. The tone of a string depends partly on weight, and, therefore, on its diameter—its gauge. Usually, string manufactures that don't describe strings by tension list string diameter in thousandths of an inch (0.001 in = 0.0254 mm). The larger the diameter, the heavier the string. Heavier strings require more tension for the same pitch and are, as a consequence, harder to press down to the fingerboard. A fretted instrument that is restrung with different string gauges may require adjustment to the string height above the frets (the [...] "action") to maintain playing ease or keep the strings from buzzing against the frets. The action <b>height</b> <b>of</b> fretless <b>instruments</b> is also adjusted to suit the string gauge or material, {{as well as the}} intended playing style.|$|R
2500|$|The {{length of}} the {{resonators}} varies according to the frequency that the bar produces. Vibrations from the bars resonate as they pass through the tubes, which amplify the tone in a manner {{very similar to the}} way in which the body of a guitar or cello would. In instruments exceeding [...] octaves, the length of tubing required for the bass notes exceeds the <b>height</b> <b>of</b> the <b>instrument.</b> Some manufacturers, such as DeMorrow and Malletech, compensate for this by bending the ends of the tubes. This involves soldering smaller straight sections of tubes to form [...] "curved" [...] tubes. Both DeMorrow and Malletech use brass rather than aluminium. Others, such as Adams and Yamaha, expand the tubes into large box-shaped bottoms, resulting in the necessary amount of resonating space without having to extend the tubes. [...] This result is achieved by the custom manufacturer Marimba One by widening the resonators into an oval shape, with the lowest ones reaching nearly a foot in width, and doubling the tube up inside the lowest resonators.|$|R
40|$|Measured {{vertical}} {{gravity gradients}} usually quite {{differ from the}} normal value of 0. 3086 mGal/m (1 mGal = 10 – 5 ms – 2). Generally the changing of vertical gradient is rather big, up to a few 10 cm height above the ground and can {{be taken into consideration}} as a second order function. Over 40 m height the changing is linear and over 500 m height the changing is very small, the measured value of vertical gradient is about 0. 3073 mGal/m. At present the datum level (mGal level) of modern gravity networks are mostly determined by absolute gravity values measured by absolute gravimeters, which values are referred to the reference <b>heights</b> <b>of</b> absolute gravimeters. So the datum level (mGal level) of the network of absolute points differs from the datum level of the network of relative measurements. The vertical gradients can be used for the conversion of measured gravity from the reference <b>height</b> <b>of</b> an <b>instrument</b> to a bench mark. So the vertical gradients are playing a key role for joining the two types <b>of</b> network. The <b>height</b> correction is necessary to determine by an accuracy of several µGal, not to decrease the reliability of the transformed value of gravity. So the vertical gradients should be determined as high accuracy as it possible and using the normal value of vertical gradient (0. 3086 mGal/m) is not sufficient for this purpose...|$|R

40|$|The {{quantitative}} {{retrieval of}} soil apparent electrical conductivity using electromagnetic induction (EMI) has remained limited due to strong simplifications regarding EMI antenna modelling. In this paper, {{a new technique}} for EMI antenna modelling is applied for the common-offset EMI systems. The EMI system is efficiently described using global transmission and reflection coefficients and Green’s functions are used to describe wave diffusion for horizontal and vertical dipole modes. We performed EMI measurements along a 180 -metre-long transect with two different instrument heights above the soil surface, {{as well as with}} different orientations and frequencies. To ensure proper retrieval of the soil apparent electrical conductivity, the reference values were obtained from electrical conductivity data measured from 11 undisturbed soil cores taken along the EMI transect. The apparent electrical conductivity values calculated by applying the proposed model have a good agreement with reference values, however some discrepancies can be observed that are mainly attributed to the presence of local heterogeneities and also errors due to the variations in the <b>height</b> <b>of</b> the EMI <b>instruments</b> above the ground. The proposed method appears to be promising for quantitative retrieval of soil apparent electrical conductivity and resolving calibration issues that are typically encountered using EMI.
