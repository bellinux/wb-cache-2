The National Hurricane Center reported 50deaths, {{although the}} post <b>event</b> <b>report</b> {{provided by the}} French meteorological agency reported 44people dead or missing. Most of the deaths were in Saint-Joseph, where 20people drowned in the Riviere l'Or. Floodwater rescues had been made difficult due to washed out roads and poor communications after the storm. In addition to the deaths, several people were injured. After {{the passage of the}} storm, Martinique was temporarily left isolated, when communications were downed with other nearby islands. The French Red Cross distributed 500blankets and one ton of condensed milk; the agency also sought international assistance.|$|E
500|$|Even though several throwers, {{including}} Nilsen, still towered above Thorkildsen on {{the world}} list, the Olympic javelin contest was regarded as widely open – [...] "one of the most open finals in Olympic history", according to the IAAF Olympic coverage. Thorkildsen threw 81.74m in the qualification round, barely earning a mention in the <b>event</b> <b>report</b> as he safely passed the automatic qualifier mark of 81metres to go through to the final. Breaux Greer won the qualification with 87.25 m, but left the stadium in a limping state. In the javelin final held two days later, Thorkildsen opened with an 84.82m release which saw him ranked third {{at the end of}} the first round. Vadims Vasiļevskis of Latvia had thrown a personal best of 84.95m to earn a surprising lead ahead of reigning World champion Sergey Makarov. In the second round Thorkildsen threw a personal best of 86.50metres. As neither Aleksandr Ivanov, Greer nor anyone else managed to beat this, Thorkildsen won a surprising Olympic gold medal with Vasiļevskis and Makarov staying in place to take the silver and bronze medals respectively. Commenting on his win, Thorkildsen described the feeling as [...] "completely insane". A second place behind Breaux Greer at the World Athletics Final in Monte Carlo rounded off the season.|$|E
2500|$|The red, {{white and}} green tricolour of the Newfoundland Natives' Society was widely {{recognized}} as the flag of Newfoundland during the mid-nineteenth century but after {{the demise of the}} society in 1866 it gradually disappeared from use. [...] The pink, white and green colours of the Roman Catholic fraternal group the Star of the Sea Association, as specified in their first published rules and by-laws, appeared sometime after the group's formation in 1871 and may have been confused with the Natives' Society's red, white and green tricolour by reporters and from black-and-white photographs of the period, from which it is impossible to distinguish red from pink. [...] There {{is no reason to believe}} that the pink and green colours of the Star of the Sea Association flag were intended as a symbol of union between Catholic groups as in the Devine and O'Mara legend. [...] With the Association's inception in 1871, their by-laws stated [...] "the flag of the Association shall be green ground, white star with pink cross in the centre" [...] and the officers [...] "shall wear, at all processions, sashes of green, white and pink." [...] The actual tri-colour flag based on these colours, now recognized as the [...] "Pink, White and Green", seems to have surfaced within the Association sometime in the mid-1880s and there is no known historical evidence to indicate its existence before that time. [...] The Star of the Sea Association appeared publicly under these colours, in the form of sashes and green flag with a pink cross, for the first time in 1875 when they marched alongside the Benevolent Irish Society in St. John's during their centenary celebrations parade of Irish nationalist Daniel O'Connell's birth. [...] Newspaper descriptions of this <b>event</b> <b>report</b> the Natives' Society's red, white and green flag [...] being flown prominently as the flag of Newfoundland, alongside the flags of England, Ireland, France and the United States, but make no mention of a pink, white and green tricolour. [...] Sometime thereafter the [...] "Pink, White and Green" [...] tricolour appeared and, with the support of the clergy, was adopted by other Catholic groups in the St. John's and surrounding area in the 1880s and 1890s.|$|E

30|$|Wireless sensor {{networks}} are application-dependent networks. An application may require general event region information, per-node event region information, or prioritized event information {{in case of}} multiple events. All event flows are subject to congestion in wireless sensor networks. This {{is due to the}} sudden impulse of information flow from a number of event nodes to a single destination. Congestion degrades system throughput and results in energy loss of nodes. In this paper, we present a multievent congestion control protocol (MCCP) for wireless sensor networks. MCCP supports multiple <b>event</b> <b>reporting</b> modes, that is, general <b>event</b> <b>reporting,</b> per-node fair <b>event</b> <b>reporting,</b> and prioritized multiple <b>event</b> <b>reporting.</b> MCCP efficiently mitigates congestion and provides output according to selected <b>event</b> <b>reporting</b> mode. MCCP uses hop-by-hop packet delivery time and buffer size as the basic metrics for congestion detection. Moreover, we introduce a schedule-based scheme at the transport layer for rate assignment and ordered delivery of event packets to underlying routing layer. This helps to avoid packet collisions and increases the packet delivery ratio even in high densities. Detailed simulation analysis confirms that MCCP decreases packet drops and provides high packet delivery ratio (above 90 %) for multiple <b>event</b> <b>reporting</b> modes.|$|R

5000|$|One of the {{fundamental}} principles of adverse event reporting is the determination of what constitutes an Individual Case Safety Report (ICSR). During the triage phase of a potential adverse <b>event</b> <b>report,</b> {{it is important to}} determine if the [...] "four elements" [...] of a valid ICSR are present: (1) an identifiable patient, (2) an identifiable reporter, (3) a suspect drug, and (4) an adverse event.|$|E
5000|$|The PRR {{is defined}} as the ratio between the {{frequency}} with which a specific adverse <b>event</b> is <b>reported</b> for the drug of interest (relative to all adverse <b>events</b> <b>reported</b> for the drug) and the frequency with which the same adverse <b>event</b> is <b>reported</b> for all drugs in the comparison group (relative to all adverse events for drugs in the comparison group). For example, suppose that nausea was reported 83 times for a given drug of interest, out of 1356 adverse <b>events</b> <b>reported</b> for the drug. Thus the proportion of adverse events of nausea for this drug is 83/1356 = 0.061. Suppose that we wish to compare the drug of interest to a class of drugs, for which nausea was reported as an adverse event 1489 times, out of 53789 total adverse <b>events</b> <b>reported</b> for drugs in the class. Thus, nausea was reported with proportion 1489 / 53789 = 0.028 for the class of drugs. The PRR in this case is 0.061 / 0.028 = 2.18. This tells us that nausea was reported more than twice as frequently (among all adverse <b>event</b> <b>reports)</b> for the drug of interest compared to drugs in the comparison group.|$|R

40|$|Background/Aim. The {{provision}} of safe healthcare {{is considered a}} priority in European Union (EU) member states. Along with other preventative measures in healthcare, the EU also strives to eliminate the “causes of harm to human health”. The aim of this survey {{was to determine whether}} safety culture, supervisors and communication between co-workers influence the number of adverse <b>event</b> <b>reports</b> submitted to the heads of clinical departments and to the management of an institution. Methods. This survey is based on cross-sectional analysis. It was carried out in the largest Slovenian university hospital. We received 235 completed questionnaires. Respondents included professionals in the fields of nursingcare, physiotherapy, occupational therapy and radiological technology. Results. Safety culture influences the number of adverse <b>event</b> <b>reports</b> submitted to the head of a clinical department from the organizational point of view. Supervisors and communication between co-workers do not influence the number of adverse <b>event</b> <b>reports.</b> Conclusion. It can be concluded that neither supervisors nor the level of communication between co-workers influence the frequency of adverse <b>event</b> <b>reporting,</b> while safety culture does influence it from an organizational point of view. The presumed factors only partly influence the number of submitted adverse <b>event</b> <b>reports,</b> thus other causes of under-reporting must be sought elsewhere...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. Web Services are an XML {{technology}} recently {{viewed as}} capable of being used for network management. A key aspect of WS in this domain is <b>event</b> <b>reporting.</b> WS-based {{research in this area}} has produced a collection of notification specifications, which consider even aspects such as filtering to reduce machine and network resource consumption. Still though, additional aspects need to be addressed if WS <b>event</b> <b>reporting</b> is to be used efficiently for network management. This paper borrows an idea in network management that of policy based task delegation and applies {{it in the context of}} WS-based management by using the WS-Notification standard messages, to increase <b>event</b> <b>reporting</b> efficiency. More specifically, we are adding functionality to the entity that produces events making it capable of performing a set of tasks apart from simple ones such as collecting and reporting notification data. This functionality allows an entity, such as a manager, capable of delegating tasks of various complexities to an <b>event</b> <b>reporting</b> entity where they can be performed dynamically. As a proof of concept that the approach is feasible and increases efficiency we analyze a complex <b>event</b> <b>reporting</b> scenario where task delegation is used. We compare this approach for performance to a plain WS-based event system and also to simple SNMP traps. ...|$|R
