5|$|To {{solve the}} {{remaining}} problems, Viète exploited {{the fact that}} the given circles and the solution circle may be re-sized in tandem while preserving their tangencies (Figure4). If the solution-circle radius is changed by an amount Δr, the radius of its <b>internally</b> tangent given circles must be likewise changed by Δr, whereas the radius of its externally tangent given circles must be changed by −Δr. Thus, as the solution circle swells, the <b>internally</b> tangent given circles must swell in tandem, whereas the externally tangent given circles must shrink, to maintain their tangencies.|$|E

5|$|Although she was {{extensively}} modified <b>internally</b> {{as part of}} her {{conversion to}} an Landing Platform Helicopter (LPH), external modifications were minor, so throughout her career Boxer retained the classic appearance of a World War II Essex-class ship.
