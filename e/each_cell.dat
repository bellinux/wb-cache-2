5|$|A {{cellular}} automaton {{is defined by}} its cells (often a one- or two-dimensional array), a finite set of values or states that can go into <b>each</b> <b>cell,</b> a neighborhood associating <b>each</b> <b>cell</b> with a finite set of nearby cells, and an update rule according to which the values of all cells are updated, simultaneously, {{as a function of}} the values of their neighboring cells.|$|E
5|$|An {{entry in}} this table defines {{the new state}} of <b>each</b> <b>cell</b> as a {{function}} of the previous state and the previous values of the neighboring cells on either side.|$|E
5|$|Development of {{the eggs}} {{is a mixture of}} deuterostome and protostome characteristics. Early {{divisions}} of the egg are holoblastic (the cells divide completely) and radial (they gradually form a stack of circles). The process is regulative (the fate of <b>each</b> <b>cell</b> depends on interaction with other cells, not on a rigid program in <b>each</b> <b>cell),</b> and experiments that divided early embryos produced complete larvae. Mesoderm is formed from mesenchyme originating from the archenteron.|$|E

50|$|The Hayflick limit or Hayflick {{phenomenon}} {{is the number}} of times a normal human cell population will divide until cell division stops. Empirical evidence shows that the telomeres associated with <b>each</b> <b>cell's</b> DNA will get slightly shorter with <b>each</b> new <b>cell</b> division until they shorten to a critical length.|$|R

5|$|The {{cell nucleus}} was {{discovered}} by Robert Brown in 1831. Demonstration of the cellular composition of all organisms, with <b>each</b> <b>cell</b> possessing all the characteristics of life, is attributed to the combined efforts of botanist Matthias Schleiden and zoologist Theodor Schwann (1810–1882) in the early 19th century although Moldenhawer had already shown that plants were wholly cellular with <b>each</b> <b>cell</b> having its own wall and Julius von Sachs had shown the continuity protoplasm between cell walls.|$|E
5|$|The {{sycamore}} is tetraploid (<b>each</b> <b>cell</b> having {{four sets}} of chromosomes, 2n=52), whereas A. campestre and A. platanoides are diploid (with 2 sets of chromosomes, 2n=26).|$|E
500|$|In {{the case}} of Rule 90, <b>each</b> <b>cell's</b> new value is the {{exclusive}} or of the two neighboring values. Equivalently, the next state of this particular automaton is governed by the following rule table: ...|$|R
40|$|Disclosed are {{apparatus}} and method for determining interface strength in situ. In one embodiment, the apparatus includes {{a plurality of}} load <b>cells,</b> wherein <b>each</b> load <b>cell</b> obtains an in situ measurement of interface strength at each measurement depth that corresponds to location of <b>each</b> load <b>cell</b> on the attachment module. <b>Each</b> load <b>cell</b> obtains the in situ measurement of interface strength without using the measurement data of a penetrating tip member. In another embodiment, an apparatus for determining interface strength in situ comprises an attachment module coupled to a penetrating tip, wherein the attachment module includes a plurality of load <b>cells.</b> <b>Each</b> load <b>cell</b> includes a friction sleeve, which the friction sleeve {{of at least one}} load cell is configured with a different surface texture than another load cell.

50|$|Due to this factorization, {{a binary}} Bayes filter {{can be used}} to {{estimate}} the occupancy probability for <b>each</b> grid <b>cell.</b> It is common to use a log-odds representation of the probability that <b>each</b> grid <b>cell</b> is occupied.|$|R
5|$|Because each {{configuration}} {{has only}} a bounded number of predecessors, the evolution of Rule 90 preserves the entropy of any configuration. In particular, if an infinite initial configuration is selected by choosing the state of <b>each</b> <b>cell</b> independently at random, {{with each of the}} two states being equally likely to be selected, then each subsequent configuration can be described by exactly the same probability distribution.|$|E
5|$|DAGs can model many {{different}} kinds of information. A spreadsheet can be modeled as a DAG, with a vertex for <b>each</b> <b>cell</b> and an edge whenever the formula in one cell uses the value from another; a topological ordering of this DAG can be used to update all cell values when the spreadsheet is changed.|$|E
5|$|If a cell has state 0, its {{new state}} {{is taken from}} the cell to its left. Otherwise, its new state is taken from the cell to its right. That is, <b>each</b> <b>cell</b> can be {{implemented}} by a multiplexer, and is closely related in its operation to a Fredkin gate.|$|E
3000|$|Uniform image-space {{distribution}} of extracted SIFT features is addressed using regular grid <b>cells.</b> In <b>each</b> grid <b>cell,</b> {{the number of}} available candidate points, entropy, and mean contrast of cells determines {{the number of the}} required features in <b>each</b> grid <b>cell.</b>|$|R

50|$|Reproduction {{among these}} organisms is {{primarily}} asexual by binary fission, with <b>each</b> daughter <b>cell</b> receiving {{one of the}} parent cell's two frustules (or theca). This is used by <b>each</b> daughter <b>cell</b> as the larger frustule (or epitheca) into which a second, small frustule (or hypotheca) is constructed.|$|R
5|$|In a {{cellular}} automaton, <b>each</b> <b>cell</b> in an infinite grid of cells may {{have one of}} a finite set of states, and all cells update their states simultaneously based only on the configuration of a small set of neighboring cells.|$|E
5|$|Like other insects, {{cockroaches}} breathe {{through a}} system of tubes called tracheae which are attached to openings called spiracles on all body segments. When the carbon dioxide level in the insect rises high enough, valves on the spiracles open and carbon dioxide diffuses out and oxygen diffuses in. The tracheal system branches repeatedly, the finest tracheoles bringing air directly to <b>each</b> <b>cell,</b> allowing gaseous exchange to take place.|$|E
5|$|The {{available}} {{choices of}} the domestic firms are given on the left, while those of the foreign firm are on top. The first number in <b>each</b> <b>cell</b> denotes the payoff to the domestic firm while the second number is the payoff to the foreign firm.|$|E
30|$|Returning to the cellular-level human {{tissue growth}} example {{discussed}} in the introduction, if N {{is the number of}} <b>cells,</b> <b>each</b> <b>cell’s</b> behavior is boundedly rational, cell density is finite, and the cells exist in three dimensional grid then the model will be O(N) on fixed word size computers.|$|R
5000|$|<b>Each</b> 30-minute <b>cell</b> {{is divided}} into four 15-minute by 15-minute quadrants.|$|R
5000|$|Secondly, an {{iterative}} process is followed to create multiple {{levels of the}} lattice: at <b>each</b> iteration the <b>cells</b> are split into four equal parts (<b>cells).</b> <b>Each</b> new <b>cell</b> is then assigned a probability randomly from the set [...] without replacement, where [...] This process is continued to the Nth level. For example, in constructing such a model down to level 8 we produce a 48 array of cells.|$|R
5|$|The {{rule for}} the {{automaton}} {{within each of}} these subsets is equivalent (except for a shift by half a cell per time step) to another elementary cellular automaton, Rule 102, in which the new state of <b>each</b> <b>cell</b> is the exclusive or of its old state and its right neighbor. That is, the behavior of Rule 90 {{is essentially the same}} as the behavior of two interleaved copies of Rule 102.|$|E
5|$|The von Neumann neighborhood, {{in which}} <b>each</b> <b>cell</b> in a {{two-dimensional}} grid has the four orthogonally adjacent grid cells as neighbors, {{continues to be}} used for other cellular automata. Von Neumann proved that the most effective way of performing large-scale mining operations such as mining an entire moon or asteroid belt would be by using self-replicating spacecraft, taking advantage of their exponential growth.|$|E
5|$|Along with {{quadratic}} probing {{and double}} hashing, linear probing {{is a form}} of open addressing. In these schemes, <b>each</b> <b>cell</b> of a hash table stores a single key–value pair. When the hash function causes a collision by mapping a new key to a cell of the hash table that is already occupied by another key, linear probing searches the table for the closest following free location and inserts the new key there. Lookups are performed in the same way, by searching the table sequentially starting at the position given by the hash function, until finding a cell with a matching key or an empty cell.|$|E
40|$|A new {{neighbourhood}} selection {{method is}} presented for both deterministic and probabilistic cellular automata models. The detection criteria are built explicitly on the corresponding contribution {{which is made}} {{to the value of}} <b>each</b> updated <b>cell</b> from <b>each</b> dtected <b>cell</b> in the evolution. Theoretical analysis and numerical simulatons demonstrate the effectiveness of this new method...|$|R
30|$|Standard {{engineering}} surveying {{equipment was}} used on 3 July 2007 {{to measure the}} relative streambed elevation differences between all of upper Marx Creek’s stream <b>cells.</b> <b>Each</b> stream <b>cell’s</b> width and water depth were also measured using a fiberglass measuring tape.|$|R
50|$|Within <b>each</b> unit <b>cell</b> {{there are}} two units of the formula Fe2+Al2(PO4)2(OH)2·6H2O.|$|R
5|$|In a sense, Rule 184 solves this problem, as follows. if Rule 184 is run on {{a finite}} set of cells with {{periodic}} boundary conditions, with an unequal number of 0s and 1s, then <b>each</b> <b>cell</b> will eventually see two consecutive states of the majority value infinitely often, but will see two consecutive states of the minority value only finitely many times. The majority problem cannot be solved perfectly if it is required that all cells eventually stabilize to the majority state but the Rule 184 solution avoids this impossibility result by relaxing the criterion by which the automaton recognizes a majority.|$|E
5|$|Static {{balance is}} {{provided}} by two ventricles, the utricle and the saccule. Cells lining the walls of these ventricles contain fine filaments, and the cells are covered with a fine gelatinous layer. <b>Each</b> <b>cell</b> has 50–70 small filaments, and one large filament, the kinocilium. Within the gelatinous layer lie otoliths, tiny formations of calcium carbonate. When a person moves, these otoliths shift position. This shift alters {{the positions of the}} filaments, which opens ion channels within the cell membranes, creating depolarisation and an action potential that is transmitted to the brain along the vestibulocochlear nerve.|$|E
5|$|There are no nontrivial {{reversible}} elementary cellular automata. However, a near-miss {{is provided}} by Rule 90 and other elementary cellular automata based on the exclusive or function. In Rule 90, the state of <b>each</b> <b>cell</b> is the exclusive or of the previous states of its two neighbors. This use of the exclusive or makes the transition rule locally invertible, {{in the sense that}} any contiguous subsequence of states can be generated by this rule. Rule 90 is not a reversible cellular automaton rule, because in Rule 90 every assignment of states to the complete array of cells has exactly four possible predecessors, whereas reversible rules are required to have exactly one predecessor per configuration.|$|E
