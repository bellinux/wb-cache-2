5|$|The Port of Calais was {{the first}} cable ship port in Europe and is the fourth largest port in France and the largest for {{passenger}} traffic. The port {{accounts for more than}} a third of economic activity of the town of Calais. Cargo traffic <b>has</b> <b>tripled</b> over the past two decades. In 2007 more than 41.5 million tonnes of traffic passed through Calais with some 11.52 million passengers, 1.4 million trucks and trailers, 2.249 million cars and 4,700 crossings a year. On average, ships sail from the port every 30 minutes. A new 400 million euro project is underway at the port to create a breakwater protecting a pool of 700 meters long, thus allowing virtually all types of ships to stop at Calais.|$|E

25|$|The {{incidence}} of liver damage from dietary supplements <b>has</b> <b>tripled</b> in a decade, {{the majority of}} these involved bodybuilding supplements.

25|$|The {{fastest growing}} rail traffic segment is {{currently}} intermodal. Intermodal is {{the movement of}} shipping containers or truck trailers by rail {{and at least one}} other mode of transportation, usually trucks or ocean-going vessels. Intermodal combines the door-to-door convenience of trucks with the long-haul economy of railroads. Rail intermodal <b>has</b> <b>tripled</b> in the last 25 years. It plays a critical role in making logistics far more efficient for retailers and others. The efficiency of intermodal provides the U.S. with a huge competitive advantage in the global economy.|$|E
25|$|Many {{individuals}} have meningiomas, but remain asymptomatic, so the meningiomas are discovered during an autopsy. One to {{two percent of}} all autopsies reveal meningiomas that were unknown to the individuals during their lifetime, since there were never any symptoms. In the 1970s, tumors causing symptoms were discovered in 2 out of 100,000 people, while tumors discovered without causing symptoms occurred in 5.7 out of 100,000, for a total incidence of 7.7/100,000. With the advent of modern sophisticated imaging systems such as CT scans, the discovery of asymptomatic meningiomas <b>has</b> <b>tripled.</b>|$|E
25|$|Wheat {{is grown}} on more land area {{than any other}} food crop (220.4 million hectares, 2014). World trade in wheat is greater than for all other crops combined. In 2016, world {{production}} of wheat was 749 million tonnes, making it the second most-produced cereal after maize. Since 1960, world production of wheat and other grain crops <b>has</b> <b>tripled</b> {{and is expected to}} grow further through the middle of the 21st century. Global demand for wheat is increasing due to the unique viscoelastic and adhesive properties of gluten proteins, which facilitate the production of processed foods, whose consumption is increasing {{as a result of the}} worldwide industrialization process and the westernization of the diet.|$|E

25|$|On 12 April 2008, the Haitian Senate {{voted to}} dismiss Prime Minister Jacques-Édouard Alexis after violent food riots hit the country. The food riots caused {{the death of}} 5 people. Prices for food items such as rice, beans, fruit and {{condensed}} milk have gone up 50 percent in Haiti since late 2007 while the price of fuel <b>has</b> <b>tripled</b> in only two months.

25|$|Sub-Saharan Africa {{nations are}} {{globally}} achieving impressive improvements in well-being, {{according to a}} report by Tony Blair Africa Governance Initiative and the Boston Consulting Group. Angola has upgraded critical infrastructure, an investment made possible by funds from the nation's development of oil resources. According to this report, just slightly more than ten years after the end of the civil war Angola's standard of living has overall greatly improved. Life expectancy, which was just 46 years in 2002, reached 51 in 2011. Mortality rates for children fell from 25 percent in 2001 to 19 percent in 2010 and the number of students enrolled in primary school <b>has</b> <b>tripled</b> since 2001. However, at the same time the social and economic inequality that has characterised the country since long has not diminished, but on the contrary deepened in all respects.|$|E
25|$|Among general {{reasons for}} {{harmful effects of}} dietary {{supplements}} are: a) absorption in a short time; b) quality and contamination; and c) enhancing {{both positive and negative}} effects at the same time. The number of incidents of liver damage from dietary supplements <b>has</b> <b>tripled</b> in a decade. Most of the products causing that effect were bodybuilding supplements. Some of the victims required liver transplants and some died. A third of the supplements involved contained unlisted steroids. Mild to severe toxicity has occurred on many occasions due to dietary supplements, even when the active ingredients were essential nutrients such as vitamins, minerals or amino acids. This has been a result of adulteration of the product, excessive usage {{on the part of the}} consumer, or use by persons at risk for the development of adverse effects. In addition, a number of supplements contain psychoactive drugs, whether of natural or synthetic origin.|$|E

25|$|There are {{large-scale}} {{shortages of}} facilities across Philippine public schools - these include classrooms, teachers, desks and chairs, textbooks, and audio-video materials. According to 2003 Department of Education Undersecretary Juan Miguel Luz, reportedly over 17 million students {{are enrolled in}} Philippine public schools, and at an annual population growth rate of 2.3 per cent, about 1.7 million babies are born every year which means {{that in a few}} years time, more individuals will assert ownership over their share of the (limited) educational provisions. To sum it up, there are too many students and too little resources. Albeit the claims the government makes on increasing the allocated budget for education, there is a prevalent difficulty the public school system faces with regard to shortages. Furthermore, state universities and colleges gradually raise tuition so as to have a means of purchasing facilities, thus making tertiary education difficult to access or more often than not, inaccessible to the poor. However, it is worth taking note of what the Aquino administration has done in its five years of governance with regard to classroom-building - the number of classrooms built from 2005 to {{the first half of the}} year 2010 <b>has</b> <b>tripled.</b> Additionally, the number of classrooms that were put up from the year 2010 to February 2015 was recorded to be at 86,478, significantly exceeding the 17,305 classrooms that were built from 2005 to 2010 and adequate enough to counterbalance the 66,800 classroom deficit in the year 2010.|$|E
500|$|Originally called Blackfoot Trail Freeway {{upon the}} opening of the first section in 1971, it was renamed in 1974 to honour Deerfoot, a late 19thcentury Siksika Nation (Blackfoot) long {{distance}} runner known for his exceptional speed. [...] Subsequent sections opened in 1975, 1980, 1982 and 2003. [...] Deerfoot was not entirely a freeway until 2005 when the final of four at-grade intersections in southeast Calgary was converted to an interchange. [...] Well known for its frequent rush hour congestion and collisions, traffic levels have steadily increased as Calgary's population <b>has</b> <b>tripled</b> to over 1.2million since 1971. [...] The mostly six-lane freeway is Alberta's busiest road with volume exceeding 169,000 vehicles per day between Highway1 and Memorial Drive in 2016, more than twice that for which it was designed. [...] The province of Alberta has been fiscally responsible for the road since 2000 but now seeks to offload maintenance and future improvement costs to the city of Calgary. [...] The two parties remain at odds over who should operate the road in the long-term but began a joint study in 2016 that will present options for upgrades while nearly all existing plans have either been deferred or scrapped.|$|E
