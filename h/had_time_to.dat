5|$|Almost {{immediately}} after the equaliser United won another corner, again taken by Beckham. He landed {{the ball on the}} head of Sheringham who nodded it to Solskjær who in turn toe-poked it into the roof of the net. Oliver Kahn, the Bayern goalkeeper, was motionless on the line. United had completed the come-back. Bayern barely <b>had</b> <b>time</b> <b>to</b> restart the game, which referee Collina brought to a close just a few seconds later.|$|E

5|$|Butterfly {{eggs are}} {{protected}} by a hard-ridged outer layer of shell, called the chorion. This is lined with a thin coating of wax which prevents the egg from drying out before the larva has <b>had</b> <b>time</b> <b>to</b> fully develop. Each egg contains a number of tiny funnel-shaped openings at one end, called micropyles; {{the purpose of these}} holes is to allow sperm to enter and fertilize the egg. Butterfly eggs vary greatly in size and shape between species, but are usually upright and finely sculptured. Some species lay eggs singly, others in batches. Many females produce between one hundred and two hundred eggs.|$|E
5|$|In 2006, before George W. Bush appointees Roberts and Alito had <b>had</b> <b>time</b> <b>to</b> make an impact, Rossum {{wrote that}} Scalia {{had failed to}} win {{converts}} among his conservative colleagues for his use of originalism, whereas Roberts and Alito, as younger men with an originalist approach, greatly admired Scalia battling for what he believed in.|$|E
5|$|Initially, {{the living}} {{conditions}} of the Robinsons varied according {{to whether or not}} they had <b>had</b> <b>time</b> <b>to</b> prepare. There were roughly three days between the signing of the capitulation and the deadline for civilians to leave the city, during which those who made the decision to stay could stockpile food and water, and camouflage their hiding places. As time passed, supplies ran out, and many Robinsons had to change their locations for security reasons. The situation soon became equally desperate for all who remained.|$|E

5|$|Polish {{historian}} Rafał Jaworski {{states that}} the estimates {{of the size of}} Bolesław's army range between 2,000–5,000 Polish warriors, in addition to Thietmar's reported 1,000Pechenegs, 300German knights, and 500Hungarian mercenaries. Less is known about Yaroslav's army, but it is assumed that he managed to collect a force of similar size.

5|$|Reserve Tom Watson {{replaced}} Partridge in {{goal and}} Hallam {{returned to the}} forward line for {{the second round of}} the Birmingham Cup, at home to Wolverhampton Wanderers. Wheldon scored with two minutes left to take the lead, but the Wanderers still <b>had</b> <b>time</b> <b>to</b> tie the scores at 3–3. After consulting both captains, the referee ordered half-an-hour's extra time, but Wanderers, whose players had already returned to the dressing-rooms, refused to play, so Jenkyns claimed the game for Small Heath.|$|E
5|$|Rouass' {{involvement}} in the series was first announced in March 2010, with her character name revealed later in May. Because Maya was only a background character, Rouass's role was limited, did not perform any stunts and <b>had</b> <b>time</b> <b>to</b> perform other projects. The actress liked working with Richard Armitage, who played Lucas, as she knew him for some years prior to working on Spooks. The character was met with generally mixed reviews from critics.|$|E

5|$|The {{company was}} self-supporting, {{with its own}} engineer, signals, transport, and {{quartermaster}} sections. The signals section had a powerful but cumbersome Wireless Set No. 11 for communicating with the 7th Division. Powered by lead-acid batteries which were recharged with petrol generators, it required multiple signallers to carry and the noise was liable {{to attract the attention}} of the enemy. The platoons were equipped with the new Army No. 208 Wireless Sets. These were small, portable sets developed for the communication needs of units on the move in jungle warfare. However, the 2/6th Independent Company had not <b>had</b> <b>time</b> <b>to</b> work with them operationally.|$|E
5|$|The {{film was}} a success, {{securing}} three Oscar nominations, including Best Picture, Best Sound Recording and Best Supporting Actor for Lemmon, who won. While Cagney was not nominated, he had thoroughly enjoyed the production. Filming on Midway Island {{and in a}} more minor role meant that he <b>had</b> <b>time</b> <b>to</b> relax and engage in his hobby of painting. He also drew caricatures of the cast and crew.|$|E
5|$|The game's {{outcome was}} in doubt {{until the final}} minute of play. With 19seconds left on the game clock, Vince Young ran for a {{touchdown}} and regained the lead for the Longhorns. He followed up by running {{the ball into the}} end zone for a two-point conversion. Leinart <b>had</b> <b>time</b> <b>to</b> attempt one pass but his pass fell out of bounds as time expired; UT beat USC by the score of 41–38.|$|E

5|$|The {{ship was}} {{commanded}} by 62-year-old Captain Edward John Smith, {{the most senior}} of the White Star Line's captains. He had four decades of seafaring experience and had served as captain of , from which he was transferred to command Titanic. The {{vast majority of the}} crew who served under him were not trained sailors, but were either engineers, firemen, or stokers, responsible for looking after the engines; or stewards and galley staff, responsible for the passengers. The 6watch officers and 39able-bodied seamen constituted only around 5percent of the crew, and most of these had been taken on at Southampton so had not <b>had</b> <b>time</b> <b>to</b> familiarise themselves with the ship.|$|E
5|$|This {{version was}} criticised {{even before the}} museum board had <b>had</b> <b>time</b> <b>to</b> present their own view. August Brunius, who had {{expressed}} his enthusiasm for the Gustav Vasa painting, reacted against the choice of subject, like most critics. The choice of subject was only aggravated by {{the way it was}} presented. Brunius felt the painting to be unreal, unbelievable and not very relevant for the modern Swedes of the early 20th century.|$|E

5|$|While {{officers}} were typically {{allowed to leave}} their ships—with two notable exceptions—civilian technicians (some of them British), machinists, and other integral crewmen were not given the same opportunity. These exceptions came on Minas Geraes, whose {{officers were}} surprised but <b>had</b> <b>time</b> <b>to</b> draw their weapons and defend themselves. The ship's captain, , {{was killed in the}} fighting along with several loyal and rebel crewmen. Any other bloodshed was much more limited: on the cruiser Bahia, the only officer aboard was killed after he shot a rebel crewman, and one lieutenant on São Paulo killed himself.|$|E
5|$|A 3–1 {{away win}} to Fulham on 5 April helped Sunderland to nine points in three games, as goals came from Danny Collins, Michael Chopra and Kenwyne Jones. They lost 2–1 {{at home to}} Manchester City on 12 April. Manchester City were awarded a dubious penalty given by Mike Riley, and Elano {{converted}} it in the 79minute. Dean Whitehead equalised with a near post volley after Andy Reid crossed the ball. Manchester City, however, still <b>had</b> <b>time</b> <b>to</b> win the game and Darius Vassell scored an 89th minute scuffed shot to beat Craig Gordon. On the return fixture of the Tyne and Wear derby on 19 April Sunderland were defeated 2–0 away to Newcastle United. The next game was another derby for Sunderland, this time the Tees–Wear derby on 26 April. Sunderland won the game 3–2 at home to Middlesbrough, with goals from Danny Higginbotham, Michael Chopra and an Emanuel Pogatetz own goal, thus securing their safety and staying in the Premier League.|$|E
5|$|As {{the bombers}} worked over the airfield, Aircraftman D. Roberts waited {{for them on}} the {{northern}} boundary with his parachute-and-cable launchers. Three Do 17s were heading towards him, climbing slowly. When they were in range he fired the cables. Nine rockets flew upwards. Wilhelm Raab saw the rockets go up. Although {{he did not understand}} what they were, he banked the Do 17 to avoid the lines of smoke {{that may or may not}} have concealed something. Because the Dornier banked, one of the cables that hit his bomber slid off the wing before the lower parachute <b>had</b> <b>time</b> <b>to</b> deploy. Pilot Petersen's Dornier was not that lucky. Already on fire it ran into the cable which dragged it out of the sky. The Do 17 crashed killing all five crewmen. Oberleutnant Rudolf Lamberty (carrying Joachim Roth) also managed to avoid a collision, but before he could do so fire hit his Dornier destroying the fuel tanks. The bomber caught fire and he was barely able to keep control. Eventually it crash-landed at Leaves Green in Kent after being shot down by No. 111 Squadron Hurricanes. Roth was killed, but Lamberty survived with burns.|$|E
