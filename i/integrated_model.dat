25|$|During the 1960s and 1970s Norway {{carried out}} several {{extensions}} of its fisheries zone and established an exclusive economic zone. This led to {{discussion on the}} establishment of a coast guard. The Military Fisheries Surveillance represented one of very few exceptions in which military force could be used against Norwegian civilians. Several organizational models were discarded, including a civilian agency, a continuation of an <b>integrated</b> <b>model</b> and a virtual coast guard made up of units from various branches. Instead the coast guard was organized as a separate unit under the navy. An important argument was to avoid duplicating services, such as an operative headquarters and naval bases. Meanwhile, the coast guard could act as a military presence to assert sovereignty.|$|E

2500|$|Parallel {{with this}} work the {{government}} started considering a new {{organization for the}} fisheries surveillance. [...] The Stoltenberg Commission, led by Thorvald Stoltenberg, was appointed in April 1974 and published its report in June 1975. In Norway there has traditionally been a strong negative sentiment against allowing military forces to be used against civilians. The Military Fisheries Surveillance represented one of very few exceptions. Several organizational models were discarded, including a civilian agency, a continuation of an <b>integrated</b> <b>model</b> and a virtual coast guard made up of units from various branches.

50|$|<b>Integrated</b> {{assessment}} <b>modelling</b> (IAM) or <b>integrated</b> <b>modelling</b> (IM) {{is a type}} {{of scientific}} modelling often used by the environmental sciences and environmental policy analysis. The <b>modelling</b> is <b>integrated</b> because environmental problems do not respect the borders between academic disciplines. <b>Integrated</b> assessment <b>models</b> therefore <b>integrate</b> knowledge from two or more domains into a single framework. <b>Integrated</b> <b>modelling</b> is referred to as assessment because the activity aims to generate useful information for policy making, rather than to advance knowledge for knowledge's sake. <b>Integrated</b> assessment <b>modelling</b> is that part of integrated assessment that relies on the use of numerical models.|$|R
40|$|Abstract. This paper {{proposes a}} novel <b>integrated</b> <b>modeling</b> method based on {{cross-sectional}} imaging system which can implement the rapid and low-cost development for various engine cylinder bodies. The <b>integrated</b> <b>modeling</b> method which involves four steps: object pre-processing, cross-sectional image acquisition, CAD model reconstruction and redesign, is presented. Furthermore, an engine cylinder body {{was used to}} demonstrate {{the application of the}} <b>integrated</b> <b>modeling</b> method. The <b>integrated</b> <b>modeling</b> method proposed is characterized by simple process, short design cycle, and low-cost. It is particularly suitable for the 3 D CAD modeling of an object with complex external and internal features. As a result, the method offers a good solution to implement the CAD modeling for a variety of complex objects with undercuts, hidden and internal features...|$|R

40|$|<b>Integrated</b> design <b>models</b> are {{starting}} {{to be used in}} the renovation of social housing. The public procurement rules and the specific characteristics of social housing renovation limit the use of <b>integrated</b> <b>models</b> known from other sectors. Research was done to identify the key limitations and possible disadvantages of <b>integrated</b> <b>models</b> applied to the renovation of social housing. Research methods comprised a literature review on European public procurement legislation and <b>integrated</b> design <b>models,</b> complemented by expert interviews and participation in discussions. The findings show that only the competitive dialogue can be used as tendering procedure to apply <b>integrated</b> <b>models,</b> creating a bilateral relation between client and consortium. General contractors can take a dominant position in this type of consortiums, limiting the independent advice for the client by architects and pushing SMEs to participate only as subcontractors. The configuration of consortiums applying for this type of contracts require further research to avoid the possible dangers highlighted.

40|$|Abstract. Vibratory feeders play an {{important}} role in automated systems and the decoupled vibratory feeder is a novel design which is excited in two different directions. The research on decoupled vibratory feeder concentrates on the modeling, the control system and structural optimization. The aim of this work is to focus on the <b>integrated</b> <b>modeling</b> of the decoupled vibratory feeder. The <b>integrated</b> <b>modeling</b> consists of the mechanic modeling, the electrical modeling and the control strategy. The modeling of all modules including the PID control, the power amplifier, the electromagnet, the feeder, the part motion and the feedback are discussed to reveal the relation between the input signal and the part motion. The block diagram of the <b>integrated</b> <b>modeling</b> of the whole system programmed with MATLAB is given in this paper. A deeper understanding of the decoupled vibratory feeder can be obtained by the <b>integrated</b> <b>modeling</b> to optimize the structural design and improve the conveying efficiency...|$|R
