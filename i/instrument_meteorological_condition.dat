40|$|The National Aeronautics and Space Administration is {{addressing}} airport capacity enhancements during {{instrument meteorological conditions}} though the Terminal Area Productivity (TAP) program. The major goal of the TAP program is to develop the technology that will allow air traffic levels during <b>instrument</b> <b>meteorological</b> <b>condition</b> to approach those achieved during visual operations. The Reduced Spacing Operations (RSO) subelement of TAP at the NASA Langley Research Center (LaRC) will develop the Aircraft Vortex Spacing System (AVOSS). The purpose of the AVOSS is to integrate current and predicted weather conditions, wake vortex transport and decay knowledge, wake vortex sensor data, and operational definitions of acceptable strengths for vortex encounters to produce dynamic wake vortex separation criteria. The proposed research is {{in support of the}} wake vortex hazard definition component of the LaRC AVOSS development research. The research program described in the next section provided an analysis of the static test data and uses this data to evaluate the accuracy vortex/wake-encounter models. The accuracy of these models has not before been evaluated using experimental data. The research results also presented the first analysis of the forces and moments imparted on an airplane during a wake vortex encounter using actual flight test data...|$|E

40|$|Days of {{operations}} in the National Airspace System {{can be described in}} term of traffic demand, runway conditions, equipment outages, and surface and enroute weather conditions. These causes manifest themselves in terms of departure delays, arrival delays, enroute delays and traffic flow management delays, Traffic flow management initiatives such as, ground stops, ground delay programs, miles-in-trail restrictions, rerouting and airborne holding are imposed to balance the air traffic demand with respect to the available capacity, In order to maintain operational efficiency of the National Airspace System, the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) maintains delay sad other statistics in the Air Traffic Operations Network (OPSNET) and the Aviation System Performance Metrics (ASPM) databases. OPSNET data includes reportable delays of fifteen minutes ox more experienced by Instrument Flight Rule (IFR) flights. Numbers of aircraft affected by departure delays, enroute delays, arrival delays and traffic flow delays are recorded in the OPSNET data. ASPM data consist of number of actual departures, number of canceled departures, percentage of on time departures, percentage of on time gate arrivals, taxi-out delays. taxi-in delays, gate delays, arrival delays and block delays. Surface conditions at the major U. S. airports are classified in terms of <b>Instrument</b> <b>Meteorological</b> <b>Condition</b> (IMC) and Visual Meteorological Condition (VMC) {{as a function of the}} time of the day in the ASPM data. The main objective of this paper is to use OPSNET and ASPM data to classify the days in the datasets into few distinct groups, where each group is separated from the other groups in terms of a distance metric. The motivations for classifying the days are two-fold, 1) to enable selection of days of traffic with particular operational characteristics for concept evaluation using system-wide simulation systems such as the National Aeronautics and Space Administration's Airspace Concepts Evaluation Tool (ACES) and 2) to enable evaluation of a given day with respect to the characteristics of the classified groups. The first part of the paper is devoted to the analysis of major trends seen in the OPSNET and ASPM data. The second part of the paper is devoted to describing features or measures derived from the OPSNET and ASPM data that are suitable for characterizing days, and the classification algorithm used for grouping the days. Finally, the method for evaluating the characteristics of a given day with respect to the properties of the groups is described...|$|E

40|$|Thesis (M. S., Mechanical Engineering) [...] California State University, Sacramento, 2011. In the {{precision}} instrument {{approach and landing}} of an airplane where the uncertainty is very frequent due to the high sensitivity of the activity to many factors that influence {{the behavior of the}} pilots, Fuzzy logic can be used to produce estimates which take into account the vagueness of the flight environment. In this situation, an important decision about the approach and landing of the airplane under <b>Instrument</b> <b>meteorological</b> <b>conditions</b> is based on these <b>conditions.</b> <b>Instrument</b> <b>meteorological</b> <b>conditions</b> (IMC) describes weather conditions that require pilots to fly primarily by reference to instruments, and therefore under Instrument Flight Rules (IFR), rather than by outside visual. Typically, <b>instrument</b> <b>meteorological</b> <b>conditions</b> are defined as bad visibility and low ceiling. In this thesis an analysis of the inputs under fuzzy logic approach is considered for a landing of airplane in <b>Instrument</b> <b>meteorological</b> <b>conditions.</b> The success rate of landing is investigated, when the visibility, pilot experience and air speed are given by a fuzzy function. The main advantages of this approach are then discussed. Precision instrument approach and landing simulations are used and the performance of the fuzzy based system is evaluated with fuzzy logic toolbox under MATLAB???s Simulation Block Set which provides a complete set of tools for evaluating the success rate of landing under the given inputs. Around 100 approach and landings are simulated using Microsoft Flight Simulator. All these flight simulation cases were applied to train the proposed fuzzy logic engine to calculate the success rate of landing. After the proposed fuzzy logic engine has been fully developed, it has been evaluated and then the evaluated results from the proposed fuzzy logic engine compared with flight simulation data collected for evaluation. Comparison of the results from the developed fuzzy based system and flight simulation results show that the proposed fuzzy engine can successfully predict the success rate of landing under the given inputs.
