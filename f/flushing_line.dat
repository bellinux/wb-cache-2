500|$|The {{station was}} not {{intended}} to be the <b>Flushing</b> <b>Line's</b> terminus. While the controversy over an elevated <b>line</b> in <b>Flushing</b> was ongoing in January 1913, the Whitestone Improvement Association pushed for an elevated to Whitestone, College Point, and Bayside. However, some members of that group wanted to oppose the <b>Flushing</b> <b>line's</b> construction if there {{was not going to be}} an extension to Whitestone. After the January 20 vote to demand that the subway <b>line</b> through <b>Flushing</b> be built underground, groups representing communities in south Flushing collaborated to push for an elevated along what was then the LIRR's Central Branch, in the current right-of-way of Kissena Corridor Park. Eleven days later, the PSC announced its intent to extend the line as an el from Corona to Flushing, with a possible further extension to Little Neck Bay in Bayside. There was consensus that the line should not abruptly end in Corona, but even with the [...] extension to Bayside, the borough would still have fewer Dual Contracts route mileage than either Brooklyn or the Bronx. The New York Times wrote that compared to the Bronx, Queens would have far less subway mileage per capita even with the Flushing extension.|$|R

5|$|After {{the success}} of the BMT Canarsie Line automation, the IRT <b>Flushing</b> <b>Line,</b> {{carrying}} the , was next chosen to be outfitted with CBTC. The proposed plan is estimated to cost US $1.4 billion. It is scheduled to be completed in September 2017.|$|E
5|$|Even {{after the}} station opened in 1928, efforts {{to extend the}} line past Flushing persisted. In 1928, the New York City Board of Transportation (BOT) {{proposed}} allowing IRT trains to build a connection to use the Port Washington branch, but the IRT did not accept the offer since this would entail upgrading railroad crossings and the single-tracked line. Subsequently, the LIRR abandoned the branch in 1932. As part of the 1929 IND Second System plan, the <b>Flushing</b> <b>Line</b> would have had branches to College Point and Bayside east of Main Street. That plan was revived in 1939. The BOT kept proposing {{an extension of the}} <b>Flushing</b> <b>Line</b> past Main Street until 1945, when World War II ended and new budgets did not allow for a Flushing extension. Since then, several New York City Transit Authority proposals for an eastward extension have all failed.|$|E
5|$|In 1963, {{three major}} {{commuter}} groups in New Jersey made expansion proposals. One {{of them would}} have involved an extension of the IRT <b>Flushing</b> <b>Line</b> under the Hudson River with a three-track tunnel and then connect with the New York, Susquehanna and Western Railroad.|$|E
50|$|On April 27, 1890, Brooklyn City opened new {{trackage}} on Flushing Avenue from Graham Avenue east to Metropolitan Avenue, {{with the}} service operating on it becoming the new <b>Flushing</b> Avenue <b>Line,</b> {{and the old}} <b>Flushing</b> Avenue <b>Line</b> being renamed the Flushing and Graham Avenues Line and afterwards, the Graham Avenue Line.

Another $337 million is to be spent on extra power {{substations}} for CBTC. This installation of CBTC would require Siemens and Thales to cooperate on the installation process for all of the lines; they had worked separately in installing the Canarsie <b>Line's</b> and <b>Flushing</b> <b>Line's</b> CBTC systems, respectively.|$|R
5|$|The <b>Flushing</b> <b>Line</b> west of 103rd Street {{opened in}} 1917. The IRT agreed {{to operate the}} line under the {{condition}} that any loss of profits would be repaid by the city. As part of the agreement, the PSC would build the line eastward to at least Flushing. The station, as well as two other stations at Willets Point Boulevard and 111th Street, was approved in 1921 as part of an extension of the <b>Flushing</b> <b>Line</b> past 103rd Street. Construction of the station and the double-deck bridge over the Flushing Creek began on April 21, 1923, with the station built via cut-and-cover methods. The bridge was completed in 1927, and the station opened on January 21, 1928, over a decade after the line initially began operation.|$|E
5|$|Because {{it would}} be {{utilized}} in both directions, {{the capacity of the}} proposed interstate loop line would be equivalent, it is said, to two 2-track lines or one 4-track line from New Jersey to New York City due to its having two crossings between New Jersey and New York. The loop was said to be able to carry 192,500 passengers per hour, or 4.62million daily passengers, had it been built. The estimate was based on the operation of 35 trains per hour in each direction, and each train would be eleven cars long and would carry 100 passengers per car. It was to be built as a multi-phase project, wherein the IRT and BMT would work together to build that system to New Jersey. Extensions of the IRT <b>Flushing</b> <b>Line</b> and BMT Canarsie Line were both considered; the Canarsie Line was to be extended to Hoboken near the Palisades, while the <b>Flushing</b> <b>Line</b> was to be extended to Franklin Street between Boulevard and Bergenline Avenues in Union City. Ultimately, the cost was too great, and with the Great Depression, these ideas were quickly shot down.|$|E
5|$|The Bayside {{extension}} was tentatively {{approved in}} June 1913, {{but only after}} {{the construction of the}} initial extension to Flushing. Under the revised subway expansion plan put forth in December 1913, the <b>Flushing</b> <b>Line</b> would be extended past Main Street, along and/or parallel to the right-of-way of the nearby Port Washington Branch of the LIRR towards Bell Boulevard in Bayside. A spur line would branch off north along 149th Street towards College Point.|$|E

The trains are not the longest by total length, however. An IND/BMT train of ten 60 ft-long cars or eight 75 ft-long cars, which is 600 ft long, is still 35 ft longer than an IRT train of eleven 51.4 ft-long cars, which is 565 ft long.|$|R
40|$|Two {{stainless}} steel toilets using the 1. 6 gallon per flush valve were tested and are documented in this report. One toilet is {{a version of}} the existing TDC water closet design (designated TDC 5) and represents a retrofit by changing the flush valve from 4. 0 gallons to 1. 6 gallons and modifying the rinse ring holes. TDC 5 is intended for use within the Texas prison system only and does not satisfy the performance requirements of the ASME Standard at the specified operating pressure of 35 psi static. However, by raising the operating pressure to 65 psi static, all performance criteria specified in ASME Standard A 112. 19. 6 - 1990 are met. The second toilet tested is the new prototype toilet (designated ATM 7). This toilet is designed to meet all requirements as specified in the ASME Standard and is intended for use in new prison facilities. This toilet passed all performance criteria stated in the ASME Standard when operating with the 1. 6 gallon flush valve at a static water pressure of 35 psi. However performance was very marginal and much improvement is possible. The <b>flush</b> <b>line</b> entrance diameter reduction to 1 / 4 " is too restrictive and forces an excessive amount of water to the rinse ring. A larger <b>flush</b> <b>line</b> entrance diameter is needed, to enhance the removal of solids without degrading the flush surface rinse performance...|$|R

5|$|The Flushing–Main Street {{station was}} {{originally}} built {{as part of}} the Dual Contracts between the Interborough Rapid Transit Company (IRT) and the Brooklyn–Manhattan Transit Corporation (BMT). It opened on January 21, 1928, completing the segment of the <b>Flushing</b> <b>Line</b> in Queens. Although plans existed for the line to be extended east of the station, such an extension was never built. The station was renovated in the 1990s. In 2016, it was the 12th busiest subway station in the system.|$|E
5|$|The IRT <b>Flushing</b> <b>Line</b> {{would be}} {{extended}} from Main Street to Bell Boulevard, as a two-track and a four-track line, along Roosevelt Avenue. The line would be constructed in a tunnel, embankment, {{and an open}} cut, costing $12,070,000. An additional extension would be constructed to College Point, running along 149th Street and 11th Avenue as an elevated line from Roosevelt Avenue to 122nd Street, costing $14,100,000.|$|E
5|$|Eventually, the MTA {{has plans}} to {{automate}} a much larger portion, using One Person Train Operation (OPTO) in conjunction with CBTC. At the current pace of installation, it would take 175 years for CBTC to be installed {{at a cost of}} $20 billion. The <b>Flushing</b> <b>line</b> operated at almost 30 trains an hour using the signal system installed when the line was built, but after CBTC is installed it is possible that an additional two trains per hour could be operated.|$|E
5|$|As {{part of the}} {{unification}} of the three subway companies that comprised the New York City Subway in 1940, elevated lines were being shut down {{all over the city}} and replaced by subways. The northern half of the Second Avenue Elevated, serving the Upper East Side and East Harlem, closed on June 11, 1940; the southern half, running through Lower Manhattan, East Midtown and across the Queensborough Bridge to Queens, closed on June 13, 1942. The demolition of the Second Avenue elevated caused overcrowding on the Astoria and <b>Flushing</b> <b>Lines</b> in Queens, which no longer had direct service to Manhattan's far East Side. Because of the elevated line's closure, as well as a corresponding increase in the East Side's population, the need for a Second Avenue subway increased.|$|R
25|$|At the BMT half, {{the south}} track served subway trains to Manhattan and the BMT Broadway Line. Trains came from Manhattan {{on the upper}} level, {{continued}} north to a merge with the lower level, and then returned via the lower level. This configuration was in place by 1924; before that trains reversed direction using a double crossover south of the platforms. Until October 17, 1949, the Astoria and <b>Flushing</b> <b>Lines</b> hosted both IRT and BMT service. Since the platforms were IRT-size, the BMT used its own elevated cars to provide service on the lines, with a required transfer at Queensboro Plaza. Shuttles from Astoria came in {{on the west side}} lower track and then reversed direction to head to Flushing; Flushing trains came in on the upper track and reversed direction towards Astoria.|$|R
50|$|The Achanalt {{reservoir}} and marshes {{were designated}} a Site of Special Scientific Interest on 18 May 1989 {{as the area}} is an important nesting ground. It is 214.6 ha. in size. The marshes are characterised by mesotrophic grassland on a river valley flood plain. There are two waterlogged Carex Juncus communities that include bottle sedge, marsh pennywort, and bogbean. In a relatively drier area, short grass and sedge occur, mainly in winter. The marshes are sedge dominated, and these include common sedge, carnation sedge, flea sedge, and star sedge. Tawny sedge and dioecious sedge occur in <b>flush</b> <b>line</b> areas. The featured herbs include heath spotted orchid and common valerian. Purple moor grass and tufted hair grass are locally extensive. Four nationally rare species of breeding birds are located here.|$|R
5|$|Then the Queens Boulevard Line turns south {{below the}} IND Eighth Avenue Line with {{separate}} lower-level platforms at 50th Street. Then the tracks split {{to join the}} local and express tracks of the Eighth Avenue Line north of 42nd Street–Port Authority Bus Terminal. At that station, a special lower platform formerly served a single southbound track from the Queens Boulevard Line, merging with both southbound tracks of the Eighth Avenue Line south of the station; the long-disused platform was demolished in June 2013 {{to make way for}} the extension of the IRT <b>Flushing</b> <b>Line.</b>|$|E
5|$|In 1990, the MTA {{proposed}} a rail line connecting LaGuardia Airport and John F. Kennedy International Airport. The line would have operated over the Grand Central Parkway and the Van Wyck Expressway. There would be stations at Shea Stadium and Jamaica. The system was proposed to cost $2billion. The MTA {{estimated that the}} rail link would take 30minutes from Kennedy to LaGuardia, {{and the frequency of}} service would initially be every 15minutes. There would be a two-track alignment with one track for each direction, as well as at least two trains heading in each direction at all times. If the link were built, the average travel time from Manhattan to Kennedy would have been about 45minutes using the Long Island Rail Road, including transfers. To LaGuardia, the average travel time from the Grand Central station using the IRT <b>Flushing</b> <b>Line</b> would be 47minutes.|$|E
5|$|The 1910 Dual Contracts {{called for}} {{extending}} IRT and BMT lines to Brooklyn, Queens, and the Bronx. Owing to Queens' lack of {{development at the}} time, it did not receive many new IRT and BMT lines compared to Brooklyn and the Bronx, since the city's Public Service Commission (PSC) wanted to alleviate subway crowding {{in the other two}} boroughs first before building in Queens. The IRT <b>Flushing</b> <b>Line</b> was to be one of two Dual Contracts lines in the borough, and it would connect Flushing and Long Island City, two of Queens' oldest settlements, to Manhattan via the Steinway Tunnel. When the majority of line was built in the early 1910s, most of the route went through undeveloped land, and Roosevelt Avenue had not been constructed. Community leaders advocated for more Dual Contracts lines to be built in Queens to allow development there.|$|E
