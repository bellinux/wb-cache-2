5|$|<b>In</b> <b>the</b> <b>scene</b> {{where the}} Magic Mirror gives Lord Farquaad {{the option to}} marry three princesses, it parodies popular American {{television}} show The Dating Game featuring: Cinderella and Snow White.

5|$|Additionally, several child {{actors were}} cast {{in order to}} portray young {{versions}} of well known characters within the show for Bran's vision of Winterfell in the past. These included Sebastian Croft as young Ned Stark, Cordelia Hill as young Lyanna Stark, Matteo Elezi as young Benjen Stark and Sam Coleman as young Hodor, or Wyllis as he is referred to <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>scene.</b>|$|E
5|$|As {{early as}} the 15th century, {{curvilinear}} perspective {{found its way into}} paintings by artists interested in image distortions. Jan van Eyck's 1434 Arnolfini Portrait contains a convex mirror with reflections of the people <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>scene,</b> while Parmigianino's Self-portrait in a Convex Mirror, c. 1523–1524, shows the artist's largely undistorted face at the centre, with a strongly curved background and artist's hand around the edge.|$|E
5|$|<b>In</b> <b>the</b> <b>scene</b> {{in which}} the crew meets Redfoot after the botched drug deal, Redfoot flicks his {{cigarette}} at McManus' face. The scene was originally to have Redfoot flick the cigarette at McManus's chest, but the actor missed and hit Baldwin's face by accident. Baldwin's reaction is genuine.|$|E

5|$|<b>In</b> <b>the</b> <b>scene</b> where Tracy {{is on his}} bacon run, every {{mention of}} January 17th is either shot so the actor's mouth is hidden or dubbed over. This can be seen most clearly when Cerie says January 17th. It seems the {{original}} was February 17th but later changed to match the release date of the episode. Closed captioning still shows February 17th.|$|E
5|$|<b>In</b> <b>the</b> <b>scene</b> {{where the}} Simpsons' house {{transforms}} into numerous objects, {{one of the}} original designs included the house made entirely of squirrels. The layout artist who designed it worked on the drawings for more than two days, but ultimately it was cut. To ensure their work did not go to waste, some staff members have used the drawings on Christmas cards and other studio-related notices.|$|E
5|$|Show-within-a-show Let's Stay Together was {{conceived}} by Dot Com with a setting and characters similar to influential African American sitcom Good Times. John Amos, {{who played the}} father on Good Times, makes a cameo appearance as the lead <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>scene</b> being filmed for the new show. He has cheesy lines and co-stars with a talking dog, a corruption of the show's original concept reminiscent of comments Amos and others have made regarding wasted potential in Good Times.|$|E

50|$|The {{climax of}} the picture takes place <b>in</b> Berchtesgaden, and <b>the</b> <b>scenes</b> of Heisemann being chased through the rubble were filmed inside the ruins of Hitler's house just before its final {{demolition}} by the German government.

5|$|Siva {{explores the}} {{exploitation}} of students by anti-social elements against a mafia backdrop and the impact on them of crowd psychology. It also focuses on politics and betrayal <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>scene</b> where Bhavani murders Machiraju and his enemy Viswanadham. As a student, Varma observed and participated in gang wars and student politics besides analysing {{the impact of a}} gangster's lifestyle and body language on students. Those experiences inspired him to begin writing Siva.|$|E
5|$|There are varying {{accounts}} whether Leigh was in {{the shower}} the entire time or a body double was used for {{some parts of the}} murder sequence and its aftermath. In an interview with Roger Ebert and in the book Alfred Hitchcock and the Making of Psycho, Leigh stated she was <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>scene</b> the entire time and Hitchcock used a stand-in only for the sequence in which Norman wraps Marion's body in a shower curtain and places it in the trunk of her car. The 2010 book The Girl in Alfred Hitchcock's Shower by Robert Graysmith contradicts this, identifying Marli Renfro as Leigh's body double for some of the shower scene's shots. Graysmith also stated that Hitchcock later acknowledged Renfro's participation <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>scene.</b>|$|E
5|$|Various wedding {{guests are}} {{depicted}} <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>scene.</b> Shiva's attendant ganas enjoy the festivities; playing drums or dancing. The vahanas (vehicles) of the couple, Shiva's bull Nandi and Parvati's lion, are sometimes pictured <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>scene.</b> In vertical panel depictions, the celestial guests are often shown flying over Shiva and Parvati. While the gods are pictured flying on their respective vahanas (e.g. Indra on his elephant, Agni on a ram) {{and with their}} consorts; semi-divine beings like Vidyadharas fly without vehicles. An anachronism found in a few Kalyanasundara scenes {{is the presence of}} the yet-unborn children of Shiva and Parvati, Ganesha and Kartikkeya. Examples of this anachronism are found at the Rameshvara Cave of Ellora, and in a 9th-century sculpture from Uttar Pradesh now housed in Los Angeles County Museum of Art.|$|E
50|$|Rhian Sheehan appears <b>in</b> <b>the</b> final <b>scene</b> of James Cameron's film Avatar as a {{military}} engineer (dressed <b>in</b> red). <b>The</b> <b>scene</b> was filmed <b>in</b> Miramar, Wellington, New Zealand, <b>in</b> <b>the</b> same suburb Rhian lives.|$|R
5000|$|The moving of the {{location}} of the camera, blurring of a part of the screen, focusing and defocusing, combined with using different angles, contributed to creating new perspectives and impressions of the viewers. [...] The montage that was used <b>in</b> putting <b>the</b> <b>scenes</b> together was also pioneering: Murnau’s technique was to use a smooth and rapid cutting <b>in</b> <b>the</b> initial <b>scenes</b> followed by jarred cutting <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>scenes</b> where <b>the</b> doorman becomes humiliated. A combination of distortion and overlapping of images was used <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>scenes</b> illustrating private vision of the drunk doorman. [...] The artistic part of <b>the</b> movie was <b>in</b> <b>the</b> acting of Emil Jannings playing the role of the doorman. Jennings used creatively his facial expressions, postures and movements, to which the cameramen provided enhancements by using close ups and {{the location}} of camera {{in such a way that}} the viewer sees nearly through the eyes of the doorman.|$|R

5|$|When Stewie becomes {{disappointed}} that Lois {{did not take}} him on the cruise, he relates {{that he has not}} expressed it much since he saw The Lake House. Peter and Lois watch the sunset; Lois noting that she feels like Kate Winslet's character in Titanic, but Peter believes that she was portrayed by Philip Seymour Hoffman. Leonardo DiCaprio is also referenced <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>scene.</b>|$|E
5|$|A scene {{featuring}} multiple clones of {{the character}} Kurt Crawford was achieved with motion control photography, allowing actor David Lovgren to portray all of the clones—multiple takes were recorded with the actor in different positions within the scene, and by using a camera controlled by a computer to follow exactly the same motions for each take, these could be seamlessly composited together. Producer Paul Rabwin has noted that achieving these shots was difficult due to the mixture of green and blue light sources <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>scene.</b>|$|E
5|$|Asylum {{digitally}} created {{weapons for}} various scenes. <b>In</b> <b>the</b> <b>scene</b> in which Nolan is killed suddenly by {{a shot in}} the head from Jason's arrow, Asylum created the arrow in post-production. Another scene involved Jason hurling a hatchet at Lawrence as he runs away, striking him in the back. The shot of a hatchet flying through the airin one instance appearing in the same frame as the actorwould be too difficult to achieve practically. Asylum rendered a complete 3D model of the hatchet then inserted the model into the frames leading up to the frame in which it hits the character in the back. One of the final images added by Asylum was for Trent's death scene. Here, Asylum digitally created a metal spike that bursts through Trent's chest as Jason slams him onto the back of a tow truck.|$|E
50|$|Directed by Little X, most of {{the music}} video was shot in Downtown Toronto. It begins with Choclair driving a Mercedes-Benz convertible, with a female {{passenger}}. <b>In</b> <b>the</b> next <b>scene,</b> he is a passenger on a motorcycle. <b>In</b> <b>the</b> third <b>scene</b> he drives a Hummer, with Kardinal Offishall as his passenger. <b>In</b> <b>the</b> final <b>scene,</b> Choclair rides on a bicycle alongside Saukrates.|$|R
