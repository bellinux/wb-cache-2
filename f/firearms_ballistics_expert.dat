5000|$|In <b>firearm</b> <b>ballistics,</b> the primer (...) is a {{component}} of pistol, rifle, and shotgun rounds. Early primers were simply the same black powder used to fire the weapon but poured into a pan or tube where it could be ignited by some external source of ignition such as a fuse or a spark. This external powder was connected through a tube in the barrel {{that led to the}} main charge. As powder won't burn when wet, this led to difficulty, or even the inability, to fire weapons in the rain.|$|R
