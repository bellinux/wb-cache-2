25|$|Whilst {{noting the}} obvious {{relevance}} {{of this to}} their own proposed scenario Marlovians do not seek multiple parallels between Marlowe's known or predicted life and these stories, believing that the plays are so rich in plot devices that such parallels can be found with numerous individuals.

25|$|In 1974, author Stephen Cosgrove's children's book Wheedle on the Needle {{postulated}} a furry creature {{called a}} Wheedle {{who lived on}} top of the Space Needle and caused its light to flash. Its closing quatrain is: There's a Wheedle on the Needle/ I <b>know</b> <b>just</b> what you're thinking/ But if you look up late at night/ You'll see his red nose blinking. The Wheedle has since become a fixture of Seattle. It even became the mascot of the Seattle SuperSonics National Basketball Association (NBA) franchise, who played in nearby KeyArena (originally known as the Seattle Center Coliseum). The SuperSonics moved to Oklahoma City on July 3, 2008.|$|E

Consequently, episodes devoted to Santa’s Little Helper {{tend to be a}} little on the sleepy side, even the Simpsons Christmas special that launched the series." ...|$|E

[...] Matisyahu stated that after listening to It Was Written, [...] "I connected with hip-hop, the hardness of it, the driving beat.

And you <b>know,</b> <b>just</b> the way I would sing it versus in the way Toni Braxton would sing it.

Moreover, Wente calls this a [...] "...polemical tractate" [...] that counsels against the rote, mechanical learning of terms for places, professions, and things; for example, it is not acceptable to <b>know</b> <b>just</b> the place names of western Asia, but also important details about its topography and routes. To enhance the teaching, the text employs sarcasm and irony.|$|E
