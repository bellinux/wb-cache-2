25|$|Rather than {{identify}} differentially expressed genes using a <b>fold</b> <b>change</b> cutoff, {{one can use}} {{a variety}} of statistical tests or omnibus tests such as ANOVA, all of which consider both <b>fold</b> <b>change</b> and variability to create a p-value, an estimate of how often we would observe the data by chance alone. Applying p-values to microarrays is complicated by the large number of multiple comparisons (genes) involved. For example, a p-value of 0.05 is typically thought to indicate significance, since it estimates a 5% probability of observing the data by chance. But with 10,000 genes on a microarray, 500 genes would be identified as significant at p < 0.05 even if there were no difference between the experimental groups. One obvious solution is to consider significant only those genes meeting a much more stringent p value criterion, e.g., one could perform a Bonferroni correction on the p-values, or use a false discovery rate calculation to adjust p-values in proportion to the number of parallel tests involved. Unfortunately, these approaches may reduce the number of significant genes to zero, even when genes are in fact differentially expressed. Current statistics such as Rank products aim {{to strike a balance between}} false discovery of genes due to chance variation and non-discovery of differentially expressed genes. Commonly cited methods include the Significance Analysis of Microarrays (SAM) and a wide variety of methods are available from Bioconductor and a variety of analysis packages from bioinformatics companies.|$|E

2500|$|The enriched motifs {{have been}} {{proposed}} to follow convergent evolution, suggesting they are [...] "optimal designs" [...] for certain regulatory purposes. For example, modeling shows that feed-forward loops are able to coordinate the change in node A (in terms of concentration and activity) and the expression dynamics of node C, creating different input-output behaviors. The galactose utilization system of E. coli contains a feed-forward loop which accelerates the activation of galactose utilization operon galETK, potentially facilitating the metabolic transition to galactose when glucose is depleted. The feed-forward loop in the arabinose utilization systems of E.coli delays the activation of arabinose catabolism operon and transporters, potentially avoiding unnecessary metabolic transition due to temporary fluctuations in upstream signaling pathways. Similarly in the Wnt signaling pathway of Xenopus, the feed-forward loop acts as a fold-change detector that responses to the <b>fold</b> <b>change,</b> rather than the absolute change, {{in the level of}} β-catenin, potentially increasing the resistance to fluctuations in β-catenin levels. Following the convergent evolution hypothesis, the enrichment of feed-forward loops would be an adaptation for fast response and noise resistance. A recent research found that yeast grown in an environment of constant glucose developed mutations in glucose signaling pathways and growth regulation pathway, suggesting regulatory components responding to environmental changes are dispensable under constant environment.|$|E

50|$|<b>Fold</b> <b>change</b> is {{a measure}} {{describing}} how much a quantity changes going from an initial to a final value.

40|$|Abstract Background Pre-processing {{methods for}} two-sample long {{oligonucleotide}} arrays, specifically the Agilent technology, {{have not been}} extensively studied. The goal {{of this study is}} to quantify some of the sources of error that affect measurement of expression using Agilent arrays and to compare Agilent's Feature Extraction software with pre-processing methods that have become the standard for normalization of cDNA arrays. These include log transformation followed by loess normalization with or without background subtraction and often a between array scale normalization procedure. The larger goal is to define best study design and pre-processing practices for Agilent arrays, and we offer some suggestions. Results Simple loess normalization without background subtraction produced the lowest variability. However, without background subtraction, <b>fold</b> <b>changes</b> were biased towards zero, particularly at low intensities. ROC analysis of a spike-in experiment showed that differentially expressed genes are most reliably detected when background is not subtracted. Loess normalization and no background subtraction yielded an AUC of 99. 7 % compared with 88. 8 % for Agilent processed <b>fold</b> <b>changes.</b> All methods performed well when error was taken into account by t- or z-statistics, AUCs ≥ 99. 8 %. A substantial proportion of genes showed dye effects, 43 % (99 % CI : 39 %, 47 %). However, these effects were generally small regardless of the pre-processing method. Conclusion Simple loess normalization without background subtraction resulted in low variance <b>fold</b> <b>changes</b> that more reliably ranked gene expression than the other methods. While t-statistics and other measures that take variation into account, including Agilent's z-statistic, can also be used to reliably select differentially expressed genes, <b>fold</b> <b>changes</b> are a standard measure of differential expression for exploratory work, cross platform comparison, and biological interpretation and can not be entirely replaced.
