Following the trial of a young man, Freddy Tan, for the murder of his friend whose decomposed body was found stuffed into a box, Singh agreed with the jury to convict Tan of culpable homicide not amounting to murder and sentence him to life imprisonment. However, he later learnt that <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>jury</b> <b>room</b> a bullying Dutch juror had wanted to impose the death penalty, but because the other jurors disliked his attitude they voted to impose a lower verdict on Tan. The father of the deceased felt an injustice had been done and went to see the Prime Minister, Lee Kuan Yew. Lee then sent for Singh, and Singh informed him of what had happened with the jurors. Lee asked Singh, [...] "Well what do you think. Shall I abolish the jury?" [...] Singh replied that if he had tried Tan without a jury, he would have convicted him of murder without hesitation. Following a public inquiry, jury trials were abolished for all criminal cases in 1969.|$|E

50|$|The vast {{majority}} of timber buildings built in North Queensland have traditionally relied on use of elevation, verandahs, and cross ventilation from windows to keep them cool. More elaborate conventions included regulating fanlights, ceiling vents and louvered openings {{on both sides of}} <b>the</b> roof or <b>in</b> gable ends. <b>The</b> second Innisfail court house incorporates these more common ventilation features with more advanced techniques. Plans and sections showing extensions to <b>the</b> building <b>in</b> 1933 reveal an elaborate ventilation system to cope with Innisfail's hot and humid climate. The system featured latticed ventilation spaces <b>in</b> <b>the</b> ceiling that delivered hot air into pipes <b>in</b> <b>the</b> ceiling and out through a cupola-shaped ventilation fleche in a decorative casing on the court house roof. Although not <b>in</b> use since <b>the</b> building's removal from Innisfail <b>in</b> 1988, <b>the</b> necessary elements of the ventilation system are still present <b>in</b> <b>the</b> ceiling. Bell (1984:178) confirms that intact examples of ceiling ventilation such as this are rare, as many have been removed or destroyed during installation of electric lights or ceiling fans. At floor level <b>in</b> <b>the</b> courtroom the lowest wallboards were hinged so they could be opened to increase airflow. Fanlights, sash windows and louvres assisted with ventilation. In 1934 a ventilation grille was installed behind the Judge's Bench and casement windows installed <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Jury's</b> <b>Room.</b> Although electric fans were first installed in 1938, and by 1990 there were 18 fans <b>in</b> <b>the</b> building, these upgrades have not affected the material fabric of the system.|$|R

2500|$|<b>The</b> grand <b>jury</b> is a pre-{{constitutional}} {{common law}} institution, and a constitutional fixture {{in its own}} right exclusively embracing common law. The process applies to the states {{to the extent that the}} states have incorporated grand juries and/or common law. Most states have an alternative civil process. [...] "Although state systems of criminal procedure differ greatly among themselves, <b>the</b> grand <b>jury</b> is similarly guaranteed by many state constitutions and plays an important role in fair and effective law enforcement <b>in</b> <b>the</b> overwhelming [...] majority of the States." [...] Branzburg v. Hayes (No. 70-85) 1972. Grand juries, which return indictments in many criminal cases, are composed of a jury of peers and operate in closed deliberation proceedings; they are given specific instructions regarding the law by the judge. Many constitutional restrictions that apply in court or in other situations do not apply during grand jury proceedings. For example, the exclusionary rule does not apply to certain evidence presented to a grand jury; the exclusionary rule states that evidence obtained <b>in</b> violation of <b>the</b> Fourth, Fifth or Sixth amendments cannot be introduced in court. Also, an individual does not have the right to have an attorney present <b>in</b> <b>the</b> grand <b>jury</b> <b>room</b> during hearings. An individual would have such a right during questioning by <b>the</b> police while <b>in</b> custody, but an individual testifying before a grand jury is free to leave <b>the</b> grand <b>jury</b> <b>room</b> to consult with his attorney outside the room before returning to answer a question.|$|R

40|$|This {{essay is}} {{intended}} to provide in brief compass a review of much that is known about <b>the</b> American <b>jury</b> system, including <b>the</b> <b>jury’s</b> historical origins, its political role, controversies over its role and structure, its performance, both absolutely and in comparison to judges and mixed tribunals, and proposals for improving <b>the</b> <b>jury</b> system. <b>The</b> essay is informed throughout by 50 years of research on <b>the</b> <b>jury</b> system, beginning with the 1965 publication of Kalven and Zeisel’s seminal book, <b>The</b> American <b>Jury.</b> <b>The</b> political importance of <b>the</b> <b>jury</b> is seen to lie more <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>jury’s</b> status as a one shot decision maker largely independent of trial court bureaucracies than {{in its ability to}} nullify the law. Despite flaws <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>jury</b> process and <b>room</b> for improvement, the message that emerges from the literature is that juries take their job seriously {{and for the most part}} perform well. There is little reason to believe that replacing jury trials with bench trials or mixed tribunals would improve the quality of American justice, and some reason to think it might harm it...|$|R
