5000|$|<b>Dial-up</b> <b>Networking</b> {{component}} was updated in Windows ME, {{and provides}} several enhancements {{while maintaining the}} desired features of prior releases of the operating system. The user interface had been reworked to provide all configurable parameters in one convenient location. The user interface now included three new tabs: Networking, Security and Dialing. To improve <b>dial-up</b> <b>networking,</b> Windows ME includes built-in support for the Connection Manager dial-up client. Using the Connection Manager Administration Kit (an optional networking component in Windows 2000 Server), network administrators can pre-configure and deploy <b>dial-up</b> <b>networking</b> connections, {{by means of a}} Connection Manager service profile, to Windows ME-based client machines.|$|E
50|$|Windows 98 <b>Dial-Up</b> <b>Networking</b> {{supports}} PPTP tunneling, {{support for}} ISDN adapters, multilink support, and connection-time scripting to automate non-standard login connections. Multilink channel aggregation enables users to combine all available dial-up lines to achieve higher transfer speeds. PPP connection logs can show actual packets being passed and Windows 98 allows PPP logging per connection. The <b>Dial-Up</b> <b>Networking</b> improvements {{are also available}} in Windows 95 OSR2 and downloadable for earlier Windows 95 releases.|$|E
50|$|In 1988, Pesce joined Shiva Corporation, which pioneered and popularized <b>dial-up</b> <b>networking.</b> Pesce's role in {{the company}} was to develop user interfaces, and his {{research}} extended into virtual reality.|$|E
50|$|The {{official}} client provides over 150 emoticons, allows grouping contacts, sending SMS and integrates {{with other}} services ran {{by the same}} company: a virtual Internet <b>dial-up,</b> a social <b>networking</b> site MojaGeneracja.pl (defunct since 5 November 2012) and an internet radio Open.fm.|$|R
50|$|Automatic redial is {{essentially}} {{exactly the same}} thing, but for modems, and included in most telecommunications programs that use modems, including all variants of <b>Dial-up</b> <b>networking</b> ever included in the Windows operating system.|$|E
50|$|After the {{introduction}} of InterCon's web browser in TCP/Connect II, AOL licensed the browser in 1995 for use with their <b>dial-up</b> <b>networking</b> services. In order to separate the browser {{from the rest of}} the suite, it was dubbed WebShark.|$|E
50|$|Most GT Power sysops {{have either}} retired their BBS systems or have {{migrated}} to other applications. Nearly {{all of the}} remaining GT Power Network BBS systems have replaced their <b>dial-up</b> <b>networking</b> with forms of mail transfer that {{take advantage of the}} Internet, by using either e-mail file attachments or some form of automated ftp.|$|E
50|$|Windows 98 also {{integrates}} shell enhancements, {{themes and}} other features from Microsoft Plus! for Windows 95 such as DriveSpace 3, Compression Agent, <b>Dial-Up</b> <b>Networking</b> Server, Dial-Up Scripting Tool and Task Scheduler. 3D Pinball is included on the CD-ROM but not installed by default. Windows 98 had its own separately purchasable Plus! pack called Plus! 98.|$|E
50|$|SSP {{contains}} modules such as DFU, SEU, SDA, and WSU {{that permit}} operators to build libraries and files, enter information into those files, produce simple reports, {{and maintain a}} menu structure that simplifies access to the information. The Advanced/36 does not support WSU. Password and resource security are also implemented through SSP, as are remote communications, which today is similar to <b>dial-up</b> <b>networking.</b>|$|E
50|$|When introduced, only a {{few hundred}} {{thousand}} were released, retailing at USD$59.95. Due to the decline of <b>Dial-Up</b> <b>Networking</b> and the more modernized, faster LAN connection, the Broadband Adapter for the Dreamcast has reached very high demand over the pre-packaged Dreamcast Modem. Some games can still be played online via the BBA through private servers, such as Phantasy Star Online, Toy Racer and Quake III Arena. Retailers such as eBay sell the accessory alone for around $100 to $200.|$|E
5000|$|MS-CHAP is the Microsoft {{version of}} the Challenge-Handshake Authentication Protocol, CHAP. The {{protocol}} exists in two versions, MS-CHAPv1 (defined in RFC 2433) and MS-CHAPv2 (defined in RFC 2759). MS-CHAPv2 was introduced with Windows NT 4.0 SP4 and was added to Windows 98 in the [...] "Windows 98 <b>Dial-Up</b> <b>Networking</b> Security Upgrade Release" [...] and Windows 95 in the [...] "Dial Up Networking 1.3 Performance & Security Update for MS Windows 95" [...] upgrade. Windows Vista dropped support for MS-CHAPv1.|$|E
5000|$|The {{canonical}} {{format is}} used by the Telephony API (TAPI), a Windows programming interface for dial-up fax, modem, and telephone equipment. Depending on the user's current location, the Windows' <b>Dial-Up</b> <b>Networking</b> (DUN) component applies a set of dialing rules to transform the canonical phone number into a locally dialable calling sequence for the modem device. The dialing rules may include variable-length dialing for area code, trunk access and international access prefixes, central office/service access numbers, and calling cards tone numbers.|$|E
50|$|This was {{the first}} version of Plus! and had an initial cost of US$ 49.99. It {{included}} Space Cadet Pinball, the Internet Jumpstart Kit (which was the introduction of Internet Explorer 1.0), DriveSpace 3 and Compression Agent disk compression utilities, the initial release of theme support along with a set of 12 themes, <b>dial-up</b> <b>networking</b> server, dial-up scripting tool, and the graphical improvements such as anti-aliased screen fonts, full-window drag, the ability to stretch or shrink the wallpaper to fit the screen and highcolor icons.|$|E
50|$|Tips {{originated}} with a popup in Windows 95 named Welcome to Windows 95, {{a series of}} screens that resembled Windows Installer and introduced the user to the Start menu and <b>dial-up</b> <b>networking.</b> The popup appeared {{the first time a}} user logged into Windows. A nearly identical popup named Welcome to NT was included in the 1996 release of Windows NT 4.0. The Windows 98 version featured a new sidebar design and a cloud background. The contents were arranged into four categories: Register Now, Connect to the Internet, Discover Windows 98, and Maintain Your Computer.|$|E
50|$|BlueCode+ is the {{portable}} higher layer Bluetooth protocol stack from Stollmann E+V GmbH. BlueCode+ 4.0 is qualified to Bluetooth version 3.0. The protocol stack is chipset and operating system independent and supports any Bluetooth HCI chips available. The APIs offer {{control of the}} profiles and stack functions, as well as direct access to lower level functions. BlueCode+ 4.0 supports the protocols L2CAP, eL2CAP, RFCOMM, SDP Server and Client, MCAP, HCI-Host Side and AVDTP. Supported profiles are Generic Access (GAP), Service Discovery Application (SDAP), Serial Port Profile (SPP), Health Device Profile (HDP), Device Identification Profile (DID), <b>Dial-up</b> <b>Networking</b> (DUN), Fax, Headset (HSP), Handsfree (HFP), SIM Access (SAP), Phone Book Access (PBAP), Advanced Audio Distribution Profile (A2DP), Audio/Video Remote Control (AVRCP) and OBEX. The stack has been ported {{to a wide range}} of different microcontrollers and operating systems.|$|E
50|$|CompuServe, and its outside {{telecommunications}} attorney, Randy May, led {{the appeals}} before the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) to exempt data networks {{from having to}} pay the Common Carrier Access Charge (CCAC) that was levied by the telephone Local Exchange Carriers (primarily the Baby Bell companies) on long distance carriers. The primary argument was that data networking was a brand new industry, and {{the country would be}} better served by not exposing this important new industry to the aberrations of the voice telephone economics (the CCAC is the mechanism used to subsidize the cost of local telephone service from long distance revenue). The FCC agreed with CompuServe's position, and the consequence is that all <b>dial-up</b> <b>networking</b> in the United States, whether on private networks or the public Internet, is much less expensive than it otherwise would have been.|$|E
5000|$|A {{redirector}} {{may include}} a modem emulator {{that allows the}} application to use [...] "AT" [...] modem commands even though no physical modem is present. The [...] "number" [...] dialed is an IP address, and the connection is a TCP network connection instead of a modem telephone call. This type of redirector is generally used by applications in originating client software needs to use a modem but the destination for the connection is a network endpoint. Back-to-back operation {{of this type of}} redirector can, in some cases, function as a replacement for modems on two computers for some applications. Network effects on timing of the data stream generally preclude the use of this method for transmitting faxes. Additionally, this method is also not reliable if used for PPP connections (such as <b>dial-up</b> <b>networking)</b> due to architectural limitations of TCP, a topic discussed in technical literature related to TCP-over-TCP.|$|E
30|$|The Slave {{synchronizer}} requests the updates by {{communicating with}} the Master synchronizer by means of well-known Hyper Text Transfer Protocol (HTTP). In this case, pull based communication is performed whereas Slave LMS is the initiator of every synchronization process. Since HTTP is based on TCP/IP, {{it is possible to}} use this mode in conjunction with with common wide-area-network technology using IP network such as either satellite network, PSTN <b>dial-up</b> <b>networking,</b> or Mobile GPRS.|$|E
40|$|This paper {{presents}} an efficient technique for the networking of TINI for real-time weather data logging and {{the deployment of}} the acquired data over Ethernet and hard-wired serial communication links. An electronic instrumentation system for real-time measurement of three weather parameters (namely: temperature, relative humidity and barometric pressure) is designed, constructed and calibrated. The weather parameters are deployed via TINI TBM 390 over Ethernet and hard-wired serial links. A novel technique {{on how to use}} point-to-point-protocol (PPP) networking with TINI runtime environment for <b>dial-up</b> <b>networking</b> including detailed configuration is also demonstrated for both Linux and Microsoft Windows®XP clients. Several critical issues on the design, implementation and deployment of the proposed weather datalogger system are also presented. The comparisons of the measured and actual (true) values demonstrate the efficiency of the proposed strategy presented in this paper. Finally, all the Java programs developed to implement and demonstrate the techniques proposed in this paper are presented...|$|E
