40|$|Large {{uncertainties}} {{exist on}} the volume of ice transported by the Southern Ocean large icebergs, a key parameter for climate studies, because of the paucity of information, especially on iceberg thickness. Using icebergs tracks from the National Ice Center (NIC) and Brigham Young University (BYU) databases to select altimeter data over icebergs and a method of analysis of altimeter waveforms, a database of 5366 icebergs freeboard elevation, length, and backscatter covering the 2002 – 2012 period has been created. The database is analyzed in terms of distributions of <b>freeboard,</b> <b>length,</b> and backscatter showing differences {{as a function of}} the iceberg's quadrant of origin. The database allows to analyze the temporal evolution of icebergs and to estimate a melt rate of 35 – 39 m·yr− 1 (neglecting the firn compaction). The total daily volume of ice, estimated by combining the NIC and altimeter sizes and the altimeter freeboards, regularly decreases from 2. 2 104 km 3 in 2002 to 0. 9 104 km 3 in 2012. During this decade, the total loss of ice (inline image km 3 ·yr− 1) is twice as large as than the input (inline image km 3 ·yr− 1) showing that the system is out of equilibrium after a very large input of ice between 1997 and 2002. Breaking into small icebergs represents 80 % (inline image km 3 ·yr− 1) of the total ice loss while basal melting is only 18 % (inline image km 3 ·yr− 1). Small icebergs are thus the major vector of freshwater input in the Southern Ocean...|$|E
5000|$|... was {{the first}} of the class to be {{completed}} in May 1916, and trials revealed numerous problems, such as the aforementioned swivel tubes, and that their low <b>freeboard</b> and great <b>length</b> made them awkward to handle either surfaced or submerged. An early criticism of the class questioned the wisdom of combining such a large hull with so great a surface speed, producing a vessel with the pace of a destroyer and the turning circle of a battle-cruiser.|$|R
50|$|As {{weaknesses}} of the original rule became apparent, the Swedish Sailing Federation enacted a number of modifications from 1916 onwards. Construction standards became much more strict and classes had minimum <b>freeboard</b> and maximum <b>lengths</b> defined. The Rule also specified new minimum measurements for internal space, to ensure that boats would have adequate room for accommodations. This {{is in contrast to}} International Rule designs where cabins are not required. The final revision of the rule was issued in 1925. It is still in effect with only minor later changes.|$|R
40|$|Wind and {{temperature}} profiles in the constant flux layer obtained by tethersonde {{were used to}} compute the total aerodynamic drag on an area of 60 Y 0 pack ice in the Fram Strait (79 ” 20 “, I- 3 ”W). The boundary layer appeared adiabatic to heights greater than 150 m, and there were only minor air/water temperature differences. Drag coefficients of 4. 9 and 5. 1. 10 - 3 referred to 10 m above ground level were found. Eddy correlation measurements in the local constant flux layers over ice floes were used to estimate the skin drag of an area of 1002, ice cover. This was less than 40 % of the total drag on the actual area. The corresponding drag coefficient was 1. 4. A drag partition model is proposed for computing the total drag over an area of pack ice {{as a function of}} ice concentration, mean <b>freeboard</b> and <b>length</b> of the ice floes, and typical roughness lengths of ice and sea surfaces. The model predicts maximum form drag at 73 ”/, ice concentration for floes of the type observed in the Fram Strait. 1...|$|R
