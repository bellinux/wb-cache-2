25|$|Power outage {{duration}} {{is a measure}} of the reliability of supply to the distribution networks. This measure decreased for most regions in Honduras from 2001. However, in 2005, a general increase in the <b>interruption</b> <b>duration</b> happened. The total duration of interruptions per connection (36 hours per year in 2005, compared to 24 hours in 2004, but 135 hours in 1999 in the aftermath of Hurricane Mitch) is about twice as high as the average for Latin America and the Caribbean (14 hours per connection in 2005). However, the frequency of such interruptions has been higher in other countries, meaning that Honduras has a few long outages, while other countries have more frequent shorter ones.|$|E

The calculation procedure of the corresponding discounts (bonus) includes the record of network contingencies, type of customer-network connection and non-supplied energy estimation. The control method which is described, comprises the record of interruptions at supply points and the following calculation of the corresponding bonus. By selecting these points with statistical sampling criteria, {{it is possible to}} determine the quality of the Utility global task performed by traditional methods. This method is similar to that one used to control electrical energy meters in service. The present starting-up stage of the method provides deterministic information about long term interruptions obtained from records of supply interruptions, carried out for about three years of systematic recording.

40|$|This paper shows a new hybrid {{method for}} risk {{assessment}} regarding interruptions in sensitive processes due to faults in electric power distribution systems.

Frequency of such occurrences {{and their impact on}} customer processes are determined for each bus and classified according to their corresponding magnitude and duration. The method is based on information regarding network configuration, system parameters and protective devices. It randomly generates a number of fault scenarios in order to assess risk areas regarding long <b>duration</b> <b>interruptions</b> and voltage sags and swells in an especially inventive way, including frequency of events according to their magnitude and duration. Based on sensitivity curves, the method determines frequency indices regarding disruption in customer processes that represent equipment malfunction and possible process interruptions due to voltage sags and swells.

Reduced response variability was furthermore accompanied by changes in spike-field coherence, pointing to the possibility that reduced spiking variability results from interactions in the local cortical network.

40|$|The primary {{advantages}} that accelerator driven systems have over critical reactors are: (1) Greater flexibility regarding {{the composition and}} placement of fissile, fertile, or fission product waste within the blanket surrounding the target, and (2) Potentially enhanced safety brought about by operating at a sufficiently low value of the multiplication factor to preclude reactivity induced events. The control of the power production {{can be achieved by}} vary the accelerator beam current. Furthermore, once the beam is shut off the system shuts down. The primary difference between the operation of an accelerator driven system and a critical system is the issue of beam interruptions of the accelerator. These beam interruptions impose thermo-mechanical loads on the fuel and mechanical components not found in critical systems. Studies have been performed to estimate an acceptable number of trips, and the value is significantly less stringent than had been previously estimated. The number of acceptable beam interruptions {{is a function of the}} length of the interruption and the mission of the system. Thus, for demonstration type systems and <b>interruption</b> <b>durations</b> of 1 sec 5 mins 2500 /yr and 50 /yr are deemed acceptable. However, for industrial scale power generation without energy storage type systems and <b>interruption</b> <b>durations</b> of t 5 mins, the acceptable number of interruptions are 25000, 2500, 250, and 3 respectively. However, it has also been concluded that further development is required to reduce the number of trips. It is with this in mind that the following study was undertaken. The primary focus of this study will be the merit of a multi-beam target system, which allows for multiple spallation sources within the target/blanket assembly. In this manner it is possible to ameliorate the effects of sudden accelerator beam interruption on the surrounding reactor, since the remaining beams will still be supplying source neutrons. The proton beam will be assumed to have an energy of 1 GeV, and the target material will be natural lead, which will also be the coolant for the reactor assembly. Three proton beam arrangements will be considered, first a single beam (the traditional arrangement) with an entry at the assembly center, two more options will consist of three and six entry locations. The reactor fuel assembly parameters will be based on those of the S-PRISM fast reactor proposed by GE, and the fuel composition and type will be based on that proposed by Aker Solutions for use in their accelerator driven thorium reactor. The following table summarizes the parameters to be used in this study. The isotopic composition of the fertile material is 100 % Th- 232, and the plutonium isotopic distribution corresponds to that characteristic of the discharge from a typical LWR, following five years of decay. Thus, the isotopic distribution for the plutonium is; Pu- 238 2. 5 %, Pu- 239 53. 3 %, Pu- 240 25. 1 %, Pu- 241 11. 8 %, and Pu- 242 7. 3 %...|$|R
30|$|Most of the dwell timers {{employed}} {{in some of}} the VHO schemes discussed above are only sensitive to some characteristics of user mobility. Moreover, the nature of interruptions in VLC HetNets is different from that of all-radio HetNets; hence, the dwell timers {{employed in}} the preceding works cannot be applied directly to VLC-WiFi HetNets. The interruptions in all radio HetNets last for several seconds and are difficult to detect due to fading, path loss, and signal fluctuations. On the other hand, the interruptions in VLC HetNets can last for a few seconds and are easily detected since received signal strength (RSS) degrades sharply when VLC channel is blocked. Wang et al. suggested that the dwell time, before handover decision, when VLC-LoS link is interrupted be adjusted based on system conditions to optimize the performance of a D-VHO scheme in VLC-RF HetNets [19]. Subsequently, Liu et al. proposed a dynamic dwell timer based on the prediction of time interval for MT to cross VLC/WLAN boundary [20]. However, the effect of physical obstructions between MT and VLC-LoS link could lead to wrong predictions. Earlier on, Hou et al. proposed a fuzzy logic-based VHO scheme that combines the merits of I-VHO and static D-VHO schemes using the failure probability of a VHO to radio channel as one of the input metrics [9]. Liang et al. also proposed a VHO algorithm based on prediction that relies on VLC channel <b>interruption</b> <b>durations,</b> message sizes, and access delays as input metrics for proper handover decision [21].|$|R

50|$|Callout {{is defined}} as an order to report for {{emergency}} or special work at an unusual time or place. Many utilities rely on customers to report a power outage or gas leak by phone or email. Once notified, utility supervisors or dispatchers then call to find available workers and assemble a crew. Utilities direct a crew to the affected area to track {{the cause of a}} disruption in power or gas leak and restore service. The order in which each lineman is called out for work after business hours is often stipulated by workplace rules and union agreements. Electric utility companies as well as gas and nuclear utilities use automated callout systems to reduce {{the time it takes to}} assemble a crew for power restoration work. By using an automated callout system instead of a manual process in which dispatchers dial workers’ phone numbers and ask for help, utilities reduces the time to fill a callout. Assembling and dispatching crews faster can reduce storm CAIDI (customer average <b>interruption</b> <b>duration</b> index) by up to 30 minutes because crews get to the scene of trouble faster.|$|E

40|$|Distribution {{protection}} and system reliability have become equally important concepts since {{the inception of}} power systems.

Problems with system reliability result in costly loss of production to critical processes create a dilemma for both the serving utility & the consumer. The protective devices and switches {{play an important role in}} the reliability of electrical distribution systems by minimizing the impact of interruption. In this project, a method for identifying the type and location for protection devices and switches on the distribution system using cost-based optimization is proposed. Data has been obtained from the data loggers in the re-closers, DDLO fusers and transformers which are connected to the Labugama feeder of the Ranala gantry energized by the Kosgama grid substation. The proposed method is based on the existing reliability analysis and reliability analysis, after introducing various components, e. g., Sectionalizes, Auto-recloses and switching gantry. The detailed design of the protection devices and the switches are determined by minimizing the total cost of reliability that comprises apparatus investment, maintenance, and interruption cost. Chapters 03 to 05 concentrate mainly on the selection of technologies and sample feeder which represents the total system. Chapters 06 will discuss the way of data collection and analysis.

30|$|Both SAIDI and CAIDI {{represent}} average interruption duration; nevertheless, their graphs exhibit different patterns. On one hand, CAIDI is {{the ratio}} of the total <b>interruption</b> <b>duration</b> over the total number of interruption. A decrease of the availability results in an increase of <b>interruption</b> <b>duration</b> and may cause an increase of the number of interruptions. As a consequence, the graph is bound between 15 and 19  h/customer interruption. On the other hand, SAIDI is {{the ratio of}} the total <b>interruption</b> <b>duration</b> over the total number of customers served. The denominator is constant resulting in a high dependability of this index to system availability. Figure  14 represents properties of the four load nodes.
