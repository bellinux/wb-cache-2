Features of the pelvis, such as the thickened shelf of the acetabulum, the <b>flaring</b> ilia, and the fused pubic symphysis, may have allowed the pelvis to withstand the stress of rearing.|$|E

40|$|The {{historical}} background of solar <b>flare</b> classification before the SMM launch is reviewed along with recent developments made by observations with SMM, Hinotori, and other contemporary satellite and ground-based observations.

5|$|This tit-tyrant {{appears to}} be {{territorial}} in defending what it regards as its feeding territory, although it only displays territorial behavior against other tufted tit-tyrants. Birds defending their territory, either alone or in a pair, tend to begin their defense by calling rapidly and displaying displacement behavior, such as bill wiping or wing <b>flaring.</b> They then raise their crest and chase the other tit-tyrant through the shrubs, occasionally physically attacking the intruder. The victorious tit-tyrant then returns to its normal foraging behavior. The southern subspecies, A. p. patagonicus, migrates to northern Argentina after the breeding season; the other populations appear to be non-migratory.|$|E

40|$|A solar <b>flare</b> {{evolution}} {{prediction model}} has been developed and placed into operations to mitigate flare-related risks to operational systems. The GOES 0. 1 - 0. 8 nm X-ray background flux is first determined and the residual flux is {{used to create a}} <b>flare</b> index value. The <b>flare</b> index is useful for determining the relative characteristics of a <b>flare</b> separate from its back-ground, for comparison with other <b>flares,</b> and for determining <b>flare</b> initiation. Within the first five minutes of <b>flare</b> initiation, the <b>flare</b> evolution model predicts the <b>flare</b> rise, timing and magnitude of the peak fluxes, decay to half maximum, and termination at background levels. Based on the rise time, a <b>flare</b> is quantitatively categorized as small, medium, or large based on the absolute value of the <b>flare</b> index value and this enables the selection of a <b>flare</b> model shape. Using the convolution of Gaussian and quadratic functions for the modeled <b>flare,</b> the integral of the <b>flare</b> area (magnitude and duration) quantifies its integrated energy content which can be related to the <b>flare’s</b> geoeffectiveness.

5|$|On March25, 2014, a {{weak area}} of low {{pressure}} accompanied by broad, <b>flaring</b> convection became increasingly organized over Mozambique. Owing to favorable environmental conditions, featuring low wind shear, vorticity became more enhanced and symmetrical.

Once further offshore on March27, the Regional Specialized Meteorological Center Météo-France in La Réunion classified the system as Disturbance 14. Drifting slowly east, a prominent feeder band developed along the system's eastern side; however, this band disrupted low-level inflow of warm, moist air and suppressed convection over the circulation center.|$|E

5|$|The {{fruit body}} {{formation}} of L.torminosus is pileostipitocarpic.

As further development takes place, these hyphae make contact with and adhere to the hymenial surface of the stem, covering basidia and macrocystidia (very long cystidia) already present. The junction between the two tissues produces a cavity that provides some temporary protection to the basidia, although they are already fertile when the cap margin starts to grow.|$|E
5|$|Like many earthstars, {{the fungus}} uses {{the force of}} falling raindrops to help {{disperse}} the spores, which are ejected in little bursts when objects (such as rain) strike the outer wall of the spore sac. The gleba is brown to grayish-brown, with a cotton-like texture that, when compressed, allows the endoperidium to flex quickly and create a puff of air that is forced out through the ostioles. This generates a cloud of spores that can then be carried by the wind. There are columellae (sterile structures that start {{at the base of}} the gleba and extend through it), which are usually not evident in the mature gleba, but apparent {{at the base of the}} spore sac. The columellae are not connected to the ostioles, but rather, terminate within the gleba at some distance from them. The capillitia (sterile strands within the gleba) are long, slender, free, tapering, unbranched, and 2–5μm thick, with thickened walls. The spores are spherical, nonamyloid, and are ornamented with irregularly shaped <b>flaring</b> protuberances up to 2μm high.

40|$|Equipment Description <b>Flares</b> {{are used}} to ignite areas {{remotely}} that are not easily accessible on foot. When used with a <b>flare</b> launcher in a <b>flare</b> system, the point of ignition can be 300 feet away. One of the two basic types of <b>flare</b> systems uses a <b>flare</b> launcher that breaks open so a self-contained cartridge similar to a shotgun shell can be loaded (figure 4 – 1). The cartridge contains the <b>flare</b> and the powder to propel it. The <b>flare</b> launcher is typically cast aluminum or plastic. The <b>flare</b> launcher is opened and a cartridge is inserted into the launcher. The launcher is pointed toward the area to be burned and the operator pulls the trigger, igniting the powder Interagency Ground Ignition Guide and launching the <b>flare.</b> These <b>flare</b> launchers typically {{range in size from}} 12 gauge to 25 millimeters. A second type of <b>flare</b> system (figure 4 – 2) has a launcher with separate cartridges (also known as blanks or power loads) to propel the <b>flare.</b> The cartridges are loaded into a cylinder that is installed in the launcher. Each cylinder holds nine cartridges. A <b>flare</b> is loaded into the barrel, the launcher is pointed in the desired direction, and the trigger is pulled.

5|$|On October24, 2006, {{an area of}} {{disturbed}} weather, {{characterized by}} <b>flaring</b> convection around a low-level circulation, developed approximately 595km (370mi) east of Guam. Situated within a region favoring tropical cyclogenesis, the system consolidated as it tracked generally westward. Late on October25, the Japan Meteorological Agency (JMA) classified the low as a tropical depression. With poleward outflow improving, the Joint Typhoon Warning Center (JTWC) issued a Tropical Cyclone Formation Alert the following day before initiating advisories on Tropical Depression 22W. Several hours later, the Philippine Atmospheric, Geophysical and Astronomical Services Administration assigned the storm the local name Paeng as was within their area of responsibility. Situated south of a strong subtropical ridge, the system maintained a general west-northwest track.

5|$|As {{for other}} lambeosaurines, it is {{believed}} that the cranial crest of Parasaurolophus changed with age and was a sexually dimorphic characteristic in adults. James Hopson, one of the first researchers to describe lambeosaurine crests in terms of such distinctions, suggested that P. cyrtocristatus, with its small crest, was the female form of P. tubicen. Thomas Williamson suggested it was the juvenile form. Neither hypothesis became widely accepted. As only six good skulls, one juvenile braincase, and one recently discovered juvenile skull are known, additional material will help clear up these potential relationships. Williamson noted that in any case, juvenile Parasaurolophus probably had small, rounded crests like P. cyrtocristatus, that probably grew faster as individuals approached sexual maturity. Recent restudy of a juvenile braincase previously assigned to Lambeosaurus, now assigned to Parasaurolophus, provides evidence that a small tubular crest was present in juveniles. This specimen preserves a small upward <b>flaring</b> of the frontal bones that was similar to but smaller than what is seen in adult specimens; in adults, the frontals formed a platform that supported the base of the crest. This specimen also indicates that the growth of the crest in Parasaurolophus and the facial profile of juvenile individuals differed from the Corythosaurus-Hypacrosaurus-Lambeosaurus model, in part because the crest of Parasaurolophus lacks the thin bony 'coxcomb' that makes up the upper portion of the crest of the other three lambeosaurines.|$|E
40|$|From 2014 October 19 to 27, six X-class <b>flares</b> {{occurred}} in super active region (AR) 12192. They were all confined <b>flares</b> {{and were not}} followed by coronal mass ejections (CMEs). To examine the structures of the four <b>flares</b> close to the solar disk center from October 22 to 26, we employ firstly composite triple-time images in each <b>flare</b> process to display the stratified structure of these <b>flare</b> loops. The loop structures of each <b>flare</b> in both lower (171 Å) and higher (131 Å) temperature channels are complex, e. g., the <b>flare</b> loops rooting at <b>flare</b> ribbons are sheared or twisted (enwound) together, and the complex structures have not been destroyed during the <b>flares.</b> For the first <b>flare,</b> although the <b>flare</b> loop system appears as a spindle shape, we can estimate their structure from observations, with lengths ranging from 130 to 300 Mm, heights from 65 to 150 Mm, widths at the middle part of the spindle from 40 to 100 Mm, and shear angles from 16 ^∘ to 90 ^∘. Moreover, the <b>flare</b> ribbons display irregular movements, such as the left ribbon fragments of the <b>flare</b> on 22 swept a small region repeatedly, and the both ribbons of the <b>flare</b> on 26 moved along the same direction, instead of separating from each other. These irregular movements also imply that the corresponding <b>flare</b> loops are complex, e. g. several sets of <b>flare</b> loops are twisted together. Although previous {{studies suggest that the}} background magnetic fields prevent confined <b>flares</b> from erupting, we firstly suggest based on these observations that the complex <b>flare</b> loop structures may be responsible for these confined <b>flares.</b> Comment: 16 pages, 5 figures, accepted for publication in Ap...|$|R

From 1 May 2010 to 31 August 2011, SDO observed over 750 solar <b>flares.</b> I created the EVE <b>flare</b> catalog to examine all of these events to produce a complete picture of the EUV variability of <b>flares.</b> In the process, I discovered that <b>flares</b> can be placed into one of five EUV <b>flare</b> categories. The EUV irradiance signature of these categories is unique and closely related to the magnetic structure of the <b>flare</b> region. Confined <b>flares</b> are the most ubiquitous type of <b>flare.</b> They are non-eruptive <b>flares</b> and appear as the sudden brightening of a coherent bundle of coronal loops. Localized eruptive <b>flares</b> are small point-like <b>flares</b> associated with EUV surges or jets. Arcade <b>flares</b> are the classic CSHKP-type <b>flare</b> and are identified observationally by an eruption followed by arcade of <b>flare</b> loops in the corona and two bright ribbons of footpoint emission in the chromosphere and transition region.
