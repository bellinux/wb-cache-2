40|$|Thin walled metal {{pressure}} vessels or pipes {{commonly used in}} industry can burst under certain circumstances: as a result, the pressure envelope may undergo large deformations, which may eventually lead to a rupture. The response of these vessels to static and quasi-static loads is relatively well-understood but their response to highly dynamic pressure loading conditions is not. This paper describes a numerical study of the response of circular metal plates to the dynamic loads produced by hydrogen-oxygen explosions. In this study, a range of dynamic responses and rupture criteria models are considered and compared {{with the results of}} experiments. The ability of MSC MARC software to model the rupture phase and, in some cases, the post-rupture phase (i. e., fragment production) is also discussed.

40|$|The r-value of a {{sheet metal}} {{is a measure}} of plastic {{anisotropy}} frequently used for prediction of performance in deep-drawing. It has also figured prominently in the literature for validation of theories where the predicted angular dependence of r is compared with the measured dependence. As plastic anisotropy in sheet metals is caused mainly by the preferred orientations of grains within the polycrystalline metal, it is natural to ask how r would depend on the orientation distribution function (ODF) w which defines the crystallographic texture of the polycrystal. In this paper a general formula relating r to w is derived for weakly-textured sheet metals whose plastic flow behavior is governed by a plastic potential f(oe#w), where oe denotes the <b>deviator</b> <b>of</b> the Cauchy <b>stress.</b> Specific forms <b>of</b> this formula for orthorhombic sheets of cubic and of hexagonal metals are explicitly given...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{investigates the}} ‘initial’ and ‘evolving’ {{mechanical}} anisotropy of a compacted unsaturated soil. Awide campaign of triaxial compression and extension tests, involving different stress and suction paths, has been performed on both isotropically and anisotropically compacted samples of unsaturated Speswhite kaolin. The first objective {{is the definition}} of the initial yield surface of the compacted soil after suction equalisation and before any plastic loading/wetting path takes place. This is followed by the investigation of the evolution of the yield surface induced by plastic straining along different loading/wetting paths. Experimental results are interpreted by using two alternative stress variables, namely net stresses σij and Bishop’s stress σ� ij ¼ σij þ δijSrs (where δij is Kronecker delta, Sr is the degree of saturation and s is suction). Constant suction cross-sections of the yield surface are represented as distorted ellipses not passing through the origin in the q:p plane <b>of</b> <b>deviator</b> <b>stress</b> plotted against mean net stress, and by distorted ellipses passing through the origin in the q:p* plane <b>of</b> <b>deviator</b> <b>stress</b> plotted against mean Bishop’s <b>stress.</b> The inclination <b>of</b> these distorted elliptical yield curves evolves with plastic straining but remains the same at all suction levels for a given level of plastic deformation.

40|$|Behavior of {{granular}} material subjected to repeated load triaxial compression tests {{is characterized by}} a model based on rate process theory. Starting with the Arrhenius equation from chemical kinetics, the relationship <b>of</b> temperature, shear <b>stress,</b> normal stress and volume change to deformation rate is developed. The proposed model equation includes these factors as a product of exponential terms. An empirical relationship between deformation and the cube root of the number <b>of</b> <b>stress</b> applications at constant temperature and normal stress is combined with the rate equation to yield an integrated relationship <b>of</b> temperature, <b>deviator</b> <b>stress,</b> confining pressure and number <b>of</b> <b>deviator</b> <b>stress</b> applications to axial strain. The experimental program consists of 64 repeated load triaxial compression tests, 52 on untreated crushed stone and 12 on the same crushed stone material treated with 4 % asphalt cement. Results were analyzed with multiple linear regression techniques and show substantial agreement with the model equations. Experimental results fit the rate equation somewhat better than the integrated equation when all variable quantities are considered. The coefficient of shear temperature gives the activation enthalpy, which is about 4. 7 kilocalories/mole for untreated material and 39. 4 kilocalories/mole for asphalt-treated material. This indicates the activation enthalpy is about that of the pore fluid. The proportionality coefficient <b>of</b> <b>deviator</b> <b>stress</b> may be used to measure flow unit volume. The volumes thus determined for untreated and asphalt-treated material are not substantially different. This may be coincidental since comparison with flow unit volumes reported by others indicates flow unit volume is related to gradation of untreated material. The flow unit volume of asphalt-treated material may relate to asphalt cement content. The proposed model equations provide a more rational basis for further studies of factors affecting deformation of {{granular material}}s under stress similar to that in pavement subjected to transient traffic loads...|$|R

Current AASHTO pavement design procedures recommend the resilient modulus (Mr) of subgrade soils or pavement design and analysis. Laboratory repeated triaxial loading tests and field falling weight deflectometer (FWD) are two common ways to characterize the resilient modulus (Mr) of subgrade soils.

40|$|Resilient modulus is an {{important}} parameter to characterise the resilient behaviour of pavement materials. Resilient modulus can be determined in the laboratory from repeated load triaxial test and {{is defined as the}} ratio <b>of</b> <b>deviator</b> <b>stress</b> to recoverable strain. Inherently, it is a challenge to perform repeated load triaxial tests as a routine basic test due to its complicated, time-consuming and expensive procedure; hence, several empirical approaches to estimate the resilient modulus from other soil mechanical properties - California bearing ratio, unconfined compressive strength or physical properties - have been proposed. This study has investigated the application of a dynamic lightweight cone penetrometer for the estimation of the resilient modulus in the laboratory and field conditions for some Victorian fine-grained subgrade soils.

40|$|Considerable {{efforts have}} been made in recent years to develop a better {{understanding}} of the mechanical behaviour of unsaturated soils in terms of elastoplastic critical state constitutive models. These models are defined in terms <b>of</b> four independent <b>stress</b> state variables : mean net stress, deviator stress, suction and specific volume. An important feature of the models is the suggestion of the existence of a yield surface in mean net stress : deviator stress : suction space. Suction-controlled triaxial tests were performed to investigate the shape of the yield surface for unsaturated compacted speswhite kaolin with a particular stress history. The tests were conducted in a Bishop-Wesley triaxial cell with suction applied by the axis translation technique. The soil samples were instrumented with local strain gauges for measuring the sample volume change. Ten samples were tested, and in each test the location of the yield surface was fixed by isotropically consolidating the sample to a mean net <b>stress</b> <b>of</b> 400 kl'a and a suction of 100 kPa. This procedure effectively erased the one-dimensional stress history produced by the compaction process. After unloading to stress states inside the yield surface, samples were re-loaded either isotropically or by drained triaxial shearing. Re-loading stages were conducted at three different values of suction. Yield points in the re-loading stages were most easily identified from plots of specific volume against the logarithm <b>of</b> mean net <b>stress</b> (even for shear tests), whereas it was often difficult to identify a clear yield point from a plot <b>of</b> <b>deviator</b> <b>stress</b> against shear strain. The yield points identified from the re-reloading stages were used to define the shape of the yield surface in a stress space with axes <b>of</b> <b>deviator</b> <b>stress,</b> mean net stress and suction. Constant suction cross-sections of the yield surface were approximately elliptical in shape, with one axis of the ellipse coinciding with the mean net stress axis. As expected, the size of the elliptical constant suction yield curves increased with increasing suction Soil elastic indices obtained from swell-back and suction-change stages showed non-conservative behaviour, indicating that the behaviour of the soil was not truly elastic even for stress states inside the yield surface.

A lack of substructure re-engineering has resulted in maintenance cycles becoming more frequent and increasingly expensive. Two significant problems arising from increasing axle loads are differential track settlement and ballast degradation. One potential method of enhancing the substructure is by manipulating the level of ballast confinement. To investigate this possibility, a series of high frequency cyclic triaxial tests have been conducted {{to examine the effects of}} confining pressure and deviator stress magnitude on ballast deformation (permanent and resilient) and degradation. Experimental results indicate that for each deviator stress considered, an optimum range of confining pressures exists such that degradation is minimised.

In these tests, the load frequency f was varied from 5 to 60 Hz to simulate train speeds of 40 - 400 km/h.

30|$|The higher {{compressibility}} {{of smaller}} specimens during isotropic compression and drained shearing {{could be due}} to the larger volumetric fraction of the sand particles near the specimen’s sides. Additional compression of the latex and grease layers (at the top and bottom caps) associated with possible inaccuracies of the employed bedding error correction method (Sarsby et al. 1980; Russell and Khalili 2004) may have also contributed to the larger compressibility of the smaller specimens. Although no shear bands were observed {{at the end of the}} tests on the exterior surface of the specimens, as suggested by earlier studies (Tatsuoka et al. 1991; Desrues et al. 1996; Finno et al. 1996; Jang and Frost 2000; Alshibli and Sture 2000) it is quite possible that a complex and diffuse mode of failure and shear localization (involving multiple shear bands) developed in the specimens. The lower <b>deviator</b> <b>stresses</b> <b>of</b> the larger specimens (in Figs.  4 and 6) could be associated with the more intense strain-softening resulting from shearing along longer and larger number of shear bands formed in larger specimens and the differences in the available space or freedom for particle rearrangement in the specimens of different sizes.

40|$|A Doctoral Thesis. Submitted in partial {{fulfilment}} of {{the requirements}} for the award of Doctor of Philosophy of Loughborough University. There is an impetus in the UK {{to move away from}} empirical pavement foundation design and the current method specification, towards an analytical design approach. For an analytical design approach to be adopted, the required performance properties of stiffness and resistance to permanent deformation of the foundation materials (sub grade and capping) need to be measured, both in the laboratory for design and in the field in order to ensure compliance. This thesis studies the influence of the sub grade on the constructability and performance of a series of full-scale pavement foundations. This has been achieved by measuring the performance parameters of several sub grade materials in the laboratory, using repeated load triaxial testing. These data have been compared to comparable data collected in situ using dynamic stiffness measuring devices during the construction of trial pavement foundations. The performance of the trial foundations has been measured during the placement and compaction of the different foundation materials, and again after their subsequent trafficking. The testing demonstrates the <b>stress</b> dependency <b>of</b> the foundation materials. The laboratory testing shows that the sub grade permanent deformation under cyclic loading (used to simulate construction operations) becomes unstable at a <b>deviator</b> <b>stress</b> <b>of</b> half the <b>deviator</b> <b>stress</b> at failure (0. 5 qmax) · The stiffness at this applied stress and above is shown to be approaching a consistent value. This indicates that large changes in the stiffness <b>of</b> inversely <b>stress</b> dependent fine grained soils occur below the deviator stress at which the permanent deformation becomes unstable. Significant variability of data has been found in the performance parameters measured (both in the laboratory and in the field) for samples of subgrade collected from small areas of the same site. However comparable patterns <b>of</b> <b>stress</b> dependency have been observed between measured laboratory and field performance using the different apparatus. The resistance to permanent deformation is shown to be a more critical design load case for construction than the need for adequate stiffness of support required to compact the foundation layers. The performance of a composite road foundation is shown to be material and site specific, and this will have important implications for design and site compliance testing...|$|R

With the recent release of the M-E Design Guide, highway agencies are further encouraged to implement the resilient modulus test to improve subgrade design. In the present study, physical property tests, unconfined compressive tests, resilient modulus (Mr) tests and Several Dynamic Cone Penetrometer (DCP) tests were conducted to assess the resilient and permanent strain behavior of 14 cohesive subgrade soils and five cohesionless soils encountered in Indiana. The applicability for simplification of the existing resilient modulus test, AASHTO T 307, was investigated by reducing the number of steps and cycles of the resilient modulus test. Results show that {{it may be possible to}} simplify the complex procedures required in the existing Mr testing to a single step with a confining <b>stress</b> <b>of</b> 2 psi and <b>deviator</b> <b>stresses</b> <b>of</b> 2, 4, 6, 8, 10 and 15 psi. Three models for estimating the resilient modulus are proposed based on the unconfined compressive tests. A predictive model to estimate material coefficients k 1, k 2, and k 3 using 12 soil variables obtained from the soil property tests and the standard Proctor tests is developed. The predicted resilient moduli using all the predictive models compare satisfactorily with measured ones. A simple mathematical approach is introduced to calculate the resilient modulus. Although the permanent strain occurs during the resilient modulus test, the permanent behavior of subgrade soils is currently not taken into consideration. In order to capture both the permanent and the resilient behavior of subgrade soils, a constitutive model based on the Finite Element Method (FEM) is proposed. A comparison of the measured permanent strains with those obtained from the Finite Element (FE) analysis shows a reasonable agreement. An extensive review of the M-E design is done.

40|$|A {{generalization}} {{is given}} of the author's thermodynamic theory for mechanical phenomena in continuous media. The developments {{are based on}} the general methods of non-equilibrium thermodynamics. Temperature effects are fully taken into account. It is assumed that several microscopic phenomena occur which give rise to inelastic strains (for instance, slip, dislocations, etc.). The contributions of these phenomena to the inelastic strain tensor are introduced as internal degrees of freedom in the Gibbs relation. Moreover, it is assumed that a viscous flow phenomenon occurs which is analogous to the viscous flow of ordinary fluids. An explicit form for the entropy production is derived. The phenomenological equations (Fourier's law and generalizations of Lévy's law and of Newton's law for viscous fluid flow) are given, and the Onsager-Casimir reciprocity relations are formulated. It follows from the theory that several types <b>of</b> (macroscopic) <b>stress</b> fields may occur in a medium: A stress field teqaß which is of a thermoelastic nature, a stress fields tviaß which is analogous to the viscous stresses in ordinary fluids, and stress fields tkmaß which are probably connected with the microscopic stress fields surrounding imperfections in the medium. The stress field teqaß + tviaß is the mechanical stress field which occurs in the equations of motion and in the first law <b>of</b> thermodynamics, and <b>stress</b> fields <b>of</b> the type teqaß + tkmaß play the role of thermodynamic affinities in the phenomenological equations which are generalizations of Lévy's law. If the equations of state may be linearized (for example, Hooke's law and the Duhamel-Neumann law), and if the phenomenological coefficients may be regarded as constants, an explicit form for the stress-strain relation may be derived. In this case the relation for distortional phenomena in isotropic media has the form of a linear relation among the <b>deviators</b> <b>of</b> the mechanical <b>stress</b> tensor, the first n derivatives with respect to time of this tensor, the tensor of total strain (the sun of the elastic and inelastic strains), and the first n + 1 derivatives with respect to time of the tensor of total strain, where n is the number of phenomena that give rise to inelastic deformations. The well-known Burgers equation is a special case of this relation if n = 2. Moreover, the stress-strain relations for ordinary viscous fluids, for thermoelastic media, and for Maxwell, Kelvin, Jeffreys, and Poynting-Thomson media are also special cases of the more general relation mentioned above. In case the equations of state may be linearized explicit expressions are given for the free energy, the internal energy, and the entropy, both for isotropic and anisotropic media. If it is not permissible to linearize the equations of state and/or to regard the phenomenological coefficients as constants, the stress-strain relation is of a very complicated nature.

40|$|The {{objective}} of this thesis is to experimentally study the behaviour of unsaturated soil in terms of shear-dilatancy relationship under constant matric suction (CS) and constant water content (CW) during monotonic or cyclic loading. The influence of matric suction and its history (wetting/drying) on volume behaviour of unsaturated soil was traditionally discussed under isotropic or one-dimensional condition. This thesis studied the influence of matric suction and its history (with/without one cycle of wetting/drying) on shear-dilatancy response of unsaturated soil under drained (CS) or undrained (CW) shear loading. Two groups of tests with/without a wetting/drying cycle during matric suction initialization manifested significant different shear-dilatancy response. The influence of matric suction history on the soil structure appeared to be significant. After wetting/drying cycle, unsaturated soil achieved more stable structure (less shear-dilatancy). However, the influence of matric suction initialization became less significant under higher net confining pressure. In this study, the behaviour of unsaturated soil was also studied under two <b>stress</b> level <b>of</b> cyclic loading with limited number of load cycles. Stiffening, overall volume compression and matric suction decrease with loading cycles were observed in both stages of cyclic loading. Matric suction change during cyclic loading appeared to correlate with the volume strain response.

40|$|Wind turbine {{foundations}} {{are subject}} to large dynamic wind loads. The horizontal wind loads create large shear forces and moments on the foundation, which may result in critical {{issues related to the}} stability and deformation of wind turbine generator (WTG) system. This study reviews and collects information about WTG foundations, soil dynamic properties, and foundation vibration theories for the dynamic analysis of WTG foundations. This study focuses on the measurement of dynamic soil properties of soil from a WTG site. Resonant column tests are used to establish shear modulus reduction and damping curves at small to medium strains. Procedures used in the laboratory testing are also described. The apparatus yielded reasonable and reliable test results that are consistent with available published results and models. Because of the heterogeneity of foundation soil under a large WTG foundation, the state <b>of</b> <b>stress</b> and strain history under WTG foundations are expected to be non-uniform; thus, three soil samples from different locations under one WTG turbine are dynamically characterized. Resonant column tests were conducted under different environmental conditions, and the effects of environmental parameters on soil dynamic properties are reported in this thesis. Resonant column testing allowed for the accurate measurement of shear modulus reduction and absolute shear modulus value of the soil specimens. Thus, with representative site soil, such as an undisturbed soil specimen, the resonant column will yield an accurate estimate of the shear modulus of the foundation soil at the field state <b>of</b> <b>stress</b> and strain history. Test results showed that shear modulus reduction curves of soils from different locations under the WTG foundation are significantly different. Soils from the south part of the WTG foundation showed a higher rate of reduction than soil from the north part of the WTG foundation. At the highest shear strain level, 3 � 10 - 5, recorded during one year of field observation (Yilmaz, 2014), the shear modulus reduction for three tested soils were 14 %, 24 % and 42 %. In addition, the soil from the north part of the foundation had a higher absolute value of maximum shear modulus, G 0 52 MPa while the shear modulus of soil from south was 42 MPa. The highest absolute shear modulus value of 88 MPa was from soil cuttings from advancement of the borings for the strain gauge placement. Strain history has a significant influence on soil dynamic properties. Three different loading paths were studied. Results indicate that large shear strain history temporarily decreases shear modulus at all strain levels but increases the low strain shear modulus (G 0) in the long term. Comparison of virgin(intact soil specimen) and large strain experienced shear modulus reduction curves inferred that the soil is able to record the largest strain in history. The number of dynamic loading cycles reduced the shear modulus of the soil slightly, which is about 2 MPa, but it has no overall effect on shear modulus reduction curves. An increase in confining pressure resulted in an increase of shear modulus at small to medium shear strain level; however, confining pressure had a very limited effect on normalized shear modulus reduction curves for the tested foundation soils. Linear threshold shear strain tends to decrease with increase in confining pressure and to increase with increase <b>of</b> <b>deviator</b> <b>stresses.</b> These results indicate that state <b>of</b> <b>stress</b> affects the threshold shear strain of the tested specimens. The study of some of the environmental parameters (confining pressure, state <b>of</b> <b>stress,</b> shear strain history etc.) helps us understand how dynamic soil properties change with design conditions and let us develop a more reliable shear modulus estimation. One year of real-time field strain gauge records (from Yilmaz (2014)) shows that the shear strain of foundation soil falls within the range (10 - 6 to 10 - 4) of shear modulus reduction curves that is built by resonant column. Shear modulus reduction curves measured in the lab may be combined with real site information to provide an accurate estimation of foundation response to wind actions or to calibrate vibration equations specifically suitable to the wind turbine foundation system. These results show that there may be large variations in the dynamic properties of soils within a single foundation site and these results may challenge the models used {{in the design of the}} dynamic foundation systems...|$|R
40|$|Permanent {{deformation}} {{is considered}} {{as one of the}} major modes of failures of flexible pavements in New Zealand. Currently based on the Australian mechanisticempirical pavement design procedure, rutting is modelled solely based on the subgrade compressive strain criterion. However, the assumptions and the rationale behind the subgrade compressive strain criterion are questionable. Therefore, the main objective {{of this study is to}} characterize the permanent deformation behaviour of Hot Mix Asphalt (HMA) based on the extensive laboratory tests to find more accurate correlation with filed performance of flexible pavement. In this study, asphalt mixes were tested by Simple Performance Test (SPT) method which includes Dynamic Modulus and Repeated Creep tests. The effect <b>of</b> <b>deviator</b> <b>stress,</b> temperature, air void content, mix gradation and binder type were thoroughly investigated through a factorial analysis. It was found that the temperature has leading effect on mix behaviour followed by pressure, air void and binder type. Permanent to resilient strain model was proposed for the New Zealand asphalt mixes. The study proved that, models proposed elsewhere could not be directly adopted in New Zealand due to significant differences in mix design and material properties. Indirect Tensile test (IDT) was also considered in this research to study bituminous mixture modulus based on New Zealand and Australian design procedure. It was shown that, under accurate conversion backed up by viscoelastic principles, the dynamic modulus of the material could be predicted from the Indirect Tensile Modulus (IDT) counterpart. As a result, it would be feasible for the New Zealand industry to adopt Mechanistic-Empirical Pavement Design method by simply using the current IDT test setup. Resilient modulus then could be converted to the dynamic modulus equivalent. Finally, Wheel Tracking (WT) test was conducted to evaluate the validity of the SPT results regarding the permanent deformation. A total of 200 cylindrical and 30 slab specimens were fabricated over the course of this research. A modified test setup was proposed for the current wheel tracker test. More realistic responses under the new test setup were recorded as a result. In addition, the material behaviour was simulated through finite element modelling by using ABAQUS program. In order to do so, the Static Creep Test was performed for a selected number of specimens. It was found that the “Creep εodel” could closely simulate the mix performance...|$|R
40|$|A {{generalization}} {{is given}} of the author's theory for plasticity phenomena. The theory includes the possibility <b>of</b> both <b>stress</b> and strain relaxation in the preplastic range. Methods of non-equilibrium thermodynamics are used. The plasticity phenomenon {{is explained by}} introducing a physical assumption concerning the phenomenological coefficients. A yield function is proposed which includes the Bauschinger effect and strain hardening. If the free energy f has the form f=f (1) +f (2), where f (1) {{is a function of}} the temperature and the elastic strains and f (2) {{is a function of the}} temperature and the inelastic strains, and if cross effects between the plastic flow and elastic relaxation phenomena may be neglected, the proposed yield function is such that the derivative with respect to time <b>of</b> the <b>deviator</b> <b>of</b> the plastic strain tensor is given by, where F is the yield function, taß is the mechanical stress tensor, and ¿ is a coefficient which vanishes in the preplastic range. If the equations of state may be linearized the proposed yield function reduces to a function which is analogous to a yield function proposed by Freudenthal. If the plastic flow phenomenon is not associated with changes in the microscopic structure of the medium the proposed yield function reduces to the Von Mises function. It follows from the theory that in a first approximation elastic relaxation phenomena in the preplastic range may be described by the equation for Poynting-Thomson media (standard linear solids). An equation which characterizes Schofield-Scott Blair media is also derived from the developed theory...|$|R
