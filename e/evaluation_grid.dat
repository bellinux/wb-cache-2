5000|$|The <b>evaluation</b> <b>grid</b> {{comprises}} {{a number}} of questions which can be answered by [...] "non existent", [...] "initiated", [...] "realised" [...] and [...] "conforted". The answer to each question determines a level between zero and four flowers. For instance, a question asks if the locality displays flowers and plants all year round; if it is initiated, it can pretend to one or two flowers, if it is realised, to three, and conforted four flowers. The average of all the answers moderated by the general impression of the examiners determine which label the locality is awarded.|$|E
5000|$|Stage one is {{the reason}} this {{algorithm}} is so efficient and is what sets it apart from most other factoring algorithms. Because the FFT (fast Fourier transform) is {{used to evaluate the}} polynomial, a fast evaluation over a dense grid in the complex plane is possible. In order to use the FFT, the grid is structured in polar coordinates. In the first phase of this stage, a grid is designed with concentric circles of a particular radius intersected by a set of radial lines. The positions and spacing of the radial lines and the circles are chosen to give a grid that will hopefully separate the expected roots. Because the zeros of a polynomial with random coefficients have a fairly uniform angular distribution and are clustered close to the unit circle, it is possible to design an <b>evaluation</b> <b>grid</b> that fits the expected root density very well. In the second phase of this stage, the polynomial is evaluated at the nodes of the grid using the fast Fourier transform (FFT). It is because of the extraordinary efficiency and accuracy of the FFT that a direct evaluation is possible. In the third phase of this first stage, a search is conducted over all of the 3 by 3 node cells formed in the grid. For each 3 by 3 cell (see Figure below), if the value of the polynomial at the center node of the cell (the [...] "x") is less than the values at all 8 of the nodes on the edges of the cell (the [...] "o's"), the center is designated a candidate zero. This rule is based on the “Minimum Modulus Theorem” which states that if a relative minimum of the absolute value of an analytic function over an open region exists, the minimum must be a zero of the function. Finally, this set of prospective zeros is passed to the second stage. The number is usually slightly larger than the degree because some were found twice or mistakes were made. The number could be less if some zeros were missed.|$|E

In order to evaluate the students’ performance, we used <b>evaluation</b> <b>grids</b> and progress charts, focusing on six different parameters for each student: cohesion, format, style, vocabulary, accuracy, and communication efficiency. In the end, we applied a questionnaire to help students to self-evaluate their own cognitive approaches. The results of the experiment confirmed that the usage of topics connected to the students’ own interests increases their ability to write functional texts. This fact seems to be mostly due to a motivation increase. It also seems that the experiment stimulated students’ metacognitive awareness: they became more confident in expressing own views and opinions, and in appreciating own progress more appropriately...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. In {{this study}} we seek to analyse the ability of {{students}} to explain, exemplify and outline geographical processes, {{as well as to}} assess their competencies by using an <b>evaluation</b> <b>grid.</b> Therefore, we tested two types of hypotheses. The first one regards the fact that it becomes more difficult for students to represent a previously learned geographical process in writing, than to outline it graphically. The second Hypothesis highlights the fact that the ability to graphically represent a geographical process is more difficult to achieve, than the ability to represent a previously learned geographical process through sketches. We went through several steps such as: the preliminary analysis of students ’ products; writing the text; setting up the criteria of analysis for products; grouping the products on the specific criteria; organizing the <b>evaluation</b> <b>grid</b> of competencies; inserting data in the tables; and the elaboration of the paper. We chose this type of approach due to the lack in evaluation grids, which we created according to the analysis of products. We used both qualitative and quantitative type of analysis, as well as data collecting, processing and interpretation. What is important to mention is that the students find it easier to represent a geographical phenomenon through a sketch previously learned rather than by using a written discourse. The sample of <b>evaluation</b> <b>grid</b> that resulted from this study can be used by the professionals in didactics, but it can be developed a new one, specific to students.
