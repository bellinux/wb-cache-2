Mutagenicity studies {{have been used to}} identify specific agents as potential carcinogens or other human health hazards. However, short-term tests are only theoretically correlated to carcinogenesis because their end points can measure only the genotoxic potential of chemicals, i. e, their activities as <b>initiating</b> <b>agents</b> in multistep carcinogenesis. The objective of our research presented here is to provide a comprehensive examination of the mechanism of toxicity of a series of pesticides.

40|$|We propose an {{adaptive}} 1 -to-many negotiation strategy for multiagent coalition formation in dynamic, uncertain, real-time, and noisy environments. Our strategy focuses on multi-issue negotiations where each {{issue is a}} request from the <b>initiating</b> <b>agent</b> to the responding agent. The <b>initiating</b> <b>agent</b> conducts multiple concurrent negotiations with responding agents and in each negotiation it employs (1) a pipelined, one-at-a-time approach, or (2) a confidence-based, packaged approach. In the former, lacking knowledge on the responding agent, it negotiates one issue at a time. In the latter, with confident knowledge of the past behavior of the responding agent, it packages multiple issues into the negotiation. We incorporate this adaptive strategy into a multi-phase coalition formation model (MPCF) in which agents learn to form coalitions and perform global tasks. The MPCF model consists of three phases: coalition planning, coalition instantiation and coalition evaluation. In this paper, {{we focus on the}} instantiation phase where the negotiations take place. 1...|$|E

40|$|In {{this paper}} we {{describe}} an integrated multilevel learning approach to multiagent coalition formation in a real-time environment. In our domain, agents negotiate to form teams to solve joint problems. The agent that initiates a coalition shoulders {{the responsibility of}} overseeing and managing the formation process. A coalition formation process consists of two stages. During the initialization stage, the <b>initiating</b> <b>agent</b> identifies the candidates of its coalition, i. e., known neighbors that could help. The <b>initiating</b> <b>agent</b> negotiates with these candidates during the finalization stage to determine the neighbors {{that are willing to}} help. Since our domain is dynamic, noisy, and time-constrained, the coalitions are not optimal. However, our approach employs learning mechanisms at several levels {{to improve the quality of}} the coalition formation process. At a tactical level, we use reinforcement learning to identify viable candidates based on their potential utility to the coalition, and case-based learning to refine negotiation strategies. At a strategic level, we use distributed, cooperative casebased learning to improve general negotiation strategies. We have implemented the above three learning components and conducted experiments in multisensor target tracking and CPU re-allocation applications. ...|$|E
