5|$|As in the {{original}} Tekken Tag Tournament, matches involve each player selecting two fighters to fight with. Players are able to switch their fighters out at any time, allowing the inactive character to gradually recover some life they might have lost. At certain points, an inactive character's life bar may flash, giving them a temporary boost in strength if they are tagged in. If the life bar of either of a player's fighters runs out, that player loses the round. <b>If</b> <b>time</b> runs out, the player who has the most cumulative life remaining amongst their fighters wins the round.|$|E
5|$|Dalton {{argued for}} girls and boys to have equal {{recreational}} and educational opportunities and for women to have fair wages. Dalton advocated exercise for girls, including swimming and shooting. She believed that women {{had the right to}} suffrage, education, property, control over their earned money, and custody of their children. She was a strong believer in moral temperance and argued that parental hypocrisy caused many children to imitate their parents' actions. She said that it was a woman's religious duty to educate herself. She urged women to take advantage of public resources like libraries and museums, or <b>if</b> <b>time</b> did not permit, to enlarge their minds at Relief Society meetings.|$|E
5|$|Each episode {{consists}} of three rounds. A team of four contestants starts the game; one player is eliminated after two rounds of play. For each question, the team has 60 seconds to unanimously agree on an answer; the available money decreases the longer it takes. Each contestant must enter the same response on their respective panel and then everyone must simultaneously lock in an answer and stop the clock. If the team answers the question correctly, they bank whatever money is left on the clock; if they are wrong, or <b>if</b> <b>time</b> runs out, their bank is reduced by half.|$|E

5|$|Each game also {{features}} three toss-up puzzles, which reveal the puzzle one random letter at a time, and award cash to whoever rings {{in with the}} right answer. The first determines who is interviewed first by the host, the second determines who starts round 1, and the third determines who starts round 4. Respectively, the toss-ups are valued at $1,000, $2,000, and $3,000. In addition to these, each game has a minimum of four rounds, with more played <b>if</b> <b>time</b> permits. Rounds 2 and 3 are respectively started by the next two contestants clockwise from the contestant who began round 1.|$|E
5|$|<b>If</b> <b>time</b> runs short {{during a}} game, the show {{goes to a}} 50/50 round. In the 50/50 round the {{remaining}} questions of that game are asked in a multiple-choice fashion, with two possible answers given. Contestants who answer incorrectly at this point have credit for the question (and the given letter, if applicable) automatically given to their opponent; however, no money {{is added to the}} bank for that question.|$|E

25|$|The many-worlds {{interpretation}} {{could be}} one possible way to resolve the paradoxes that {{one would expect to}} arise <b>if</b> <b>time</b> travel turns out to be permitted by physics (permitting closed timelike curves and thus violating causality). Entering the past would itself be a quantum event causing branching, and therefore the timeline accessed by the time traveller simply would be another timeline of many. In that sense, it would make the Novikov self-consistency principle unnecessary.|$|E
25|$|After each clue was given, the {{contestant}} {{sought out}} the word and circled it with an electronic pencil on the screen once he/she found it. Passing was allowed if a contestant got stuck on a word, and <b>if</b> <b>time</b> permitted the champion could play those words again once all ten clues were given. Finding all ten words before time ran out won the contestant the jackpot. If not, $100 was given for each word that had been found before time expired.|$|E
25|$|The lead jammer {{can stop}} the jam at any time by {{repeatedly}} placing both hands on their hips. If the jam is not stopped early, it ends after two minutes. <b>If</b> <b>time</b> remains in the period, teams then have 30 seconds {{to get on the}} track and line up for the next jam.

25|$|The {{report also}} {{rejected}} the suggestion to allow solicitors rights of {{audience in the}} High Court The report concluded {{that the practice of}} law was a profession, and that a profession had to be independent of government, because without independence the interests of a client cannot be a primary consideration. It did not challenge the existing professional self-regulation through organisations such as the Law Society and Bar Council. The Commission did recommend an examination of the court and legal procedures to see <b>if</b> <b>time</b> and money could be saved for the parties involved.|$|E
25|$|Imprinting {{may cause}} {{problems}} in cloning, with clones having DNA {{that is not}} methylated in the correct positions. It is possible that {{this is due to}} a lack of time for reprogramming to be completely achieved. When a nucleus is added to an egg during somatic cell nuclear transfer, the egg starts dividing in minutes, as compared to the days or months it takes for reprogramming during embryonic development. <b>If</b> <b>time</b> is the responsible factor, it may be possible to delay cell division in clones, giving time for proper reprogramming to occur.|$|E
25|$|Two {{members of}} the winning family play Fast Money {{for a chance to}} win a cash bonus. One {{contestant}} is onstage with the host, while the other is sequestered backstage so that he/she cannot hear the first portion of the round. The first contestant is asked five rapid-fire survey questions and has a set time limit in which to answer them (originally 15 seconds, extended to 20 in 1994). The clock begins to run only after the first question is asked, and the first contestant may pass on a question and return to it after all five have been asked, <b>if</b> <b>time</b> remains.|$|E

25|$|Also some test {{theories}} of special relativity use {{some sort of}} Lorentzian framework. For instance, the Robertson–Mansouri–Sexl test theory introduces a preferred aether frame and includes parameters indicating different combinations of length and times changes. <b>If</b> <b>time</b> dilation and length contraction of bodies moving in the aether have their exact relativistic values, the complete Lorentz transformation can be derived and the aether is hidden from any observation, which makes it kinematically indistinguishable from the predictions of special relativity. Using this model, the Michelson–Morley experiment, Kennedy–Thorndike experiment, and Ives–Stilwell experiment put sharp constraints on violations of Lorentz invariance.|$|E
25|$|S. haemorrhoidalis {{is hardly}} ever used in {{forensic}} investigations, {{due to its}} global distribution {{and the fact that}} little is known about them. Usually, other more researched flies and beetles, if present on the body, take precedence. The fly has a pupation time ranging from 93 hours to 153 hours. Development from larvae to adult can range from 252 to 802 hours. Knowing the pupation and life cycle times of S. haemorrhoidalis and taking into consideration that this species is ovoviviparous allows investigators to calculate how long the fly has been on the corpse. <b>If</b> <b>time</b> of colonization of the corpse by maggots is known, it can help determine the PMI, or post-mortem interval.|$|E
25|$|By this time, referee J. C. Louderback and his officiating {{crew had}} {{realized}} their mistake, and conferred for nearly 20 minutes to decide their course of action. During the delay, {{radio and television}} announcers also noticed that Colorado had scored {{with the help of}} an additional play. Louderback was shown on the phone. After a lengthy consultation, the referees announced their decision: the touchdown counted, giving Colorado a 33-31 lead. They also decided that the Buffs would have to attempt the extra point. The rules do not require the extra point try <b>if</b> <b>time</b> has expired and the result will not affect the outcome of the game. However, since Colorado only led by two, Missouri could have potentially blocked the try and returned it for two points to tie the game, the try was required. Not wanting to take this chance, Johnson took the snap and went to a knee, allowing the Buffaloes to go home with a controversial win.|$|E

25|$|Ismay {{occasionally}} accompanied his ships {{on their}} maiden voyages, {{and this was}} the case with the Titanic. During the voyage, Ismay talked with either (or possibly both) chief engineer Joseph Bell or Captain Edward J. Smith about a possible test of speed <b>if</b> <b>time</b> permitted. After the ship collided with an iceberg 400 miles south of the Grand Banks of Newfoundland on the night of 14 April 1912, Ismay bore the full brunt of his errors in the ship's lifeboat capacity when it was made clear the ship would founder before any rescue ships would reach the area. Ismay stepped aboard Collapsible C, which was launched less than 20 minutes before the ship went down. He later testified that as the ship was in her final moments, he turned away, unable to watch his creation sink beneath the waters of the North Atlantic. Collapsible C was picked up by the Carpathia about 3–4 hours later.|$|E
25|$|In First-class cricket (two innings match), {{the team}} that scores more runs, having {{dismissed}} its opponents twice, is the winner. An example would be: Team A scored 240 in their first innings, and Team B made 225 in reply. Team A then made 300 for 7 in their second innings, declaring it closed (they might do this because {{there was not much}} time left in the match and wanted to have time to dismiss team B and win rather than draw the game). Team A would be setting team B a target of 316 to win. If, in the second innings, team B only scored 250 (indeed anything less than 315) then team A would be the winner. If, on the other hand, team B scored 316–9, team B would be the winner. <b>If</b> <b>time</b> or the weather prevents the opposing side's being dismissed twice, the game is a draw, even if one side has scored more than the other. There is no equivalent of Duckworth-Lewis Method in these matches.|$|E
25|$|If {{the contestants}} {{had the same}} score {{at the end of}} the game, the scores were reset and the contestants played one tiebreaker {{question}} each, again attempting to match all six celebrities. On Match Game PM, or on the syndicated daytime show <b>if</b> <b>time</b> was running short, a time-saving variant of the tie-breaker was used that reversed the game play. The contestants wrote their answers first on a card in secret, then the celebrities were canvassed to give their answers verbally. Originally, this included regulars Somers, Reilly and Dawson only, but when Dawson left the show, the canvass was expanded to include all six panelists in the usual order. The first celebrity response to match a contestant's answer gave that contestant the victory. If there was still no match, which was rare, the round was replayed with a new question. On the CBS version, the tie-breaker went on until there was a clear winner. If it came to the sudden-death tie-breaker, only the final question (the one that ultimately broke the tie) was kept and aired.|$|E
