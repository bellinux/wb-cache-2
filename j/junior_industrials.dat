5000|$|The {{property}} {{known as}} [...] "Irishtown Hill House", Cornakinnegar, was purchased in 1892 for the permanent Boys' Industrial School. Plans for an extension having been approved, Dr. O'Neill {{laid the foundation}} stone and the school was named St. Michael's {{as a form of}} tribute to Rev. Michael B. McConville, PP. The boys were transferred from their temporary school for <b>Junior</b> <b>Industrial</b> Boys (established in 1905) at 81, William Street, Lurgan, on 26 June 1903 and remained there until 1924 when the two Industrial Schools - St. Michael's for Boys and the House of Divine Providence for Girls (established from 1892) - closed {{as a result of the}} partition of Ireland.|$|R
5000|$|When Horne was five, she {{was sent}} to live in Georgia. For several years, she {{traveled}} with her mother. From 1927 to 1929, she lived with her uncle, Frank S. Horne, dean of students at Fort Valley <b>Junior</b> <b>Industrial</b> Institute (now part of Fort Valley State University) in Fort Valley, Georgia, who later served {{as an adviser to}} President Franklin Delano Roosevelt. From Fort Valley, southwest of Macon, Horne briefly moved to Atlanta with her mother; they returned to New York when Horne was 12 years old. She then attended Girls High School, an all-girls public high school in Brooklyn that has since become Boys and Girls High School; she dropped-out without earning a diploma. Aged 18, she moved to her father's home in Pittsburgh, staying in the city's Little Harlem for almost five years and learning from native Pittsburghers Billy Strayhorn and Billy Eckstine, among others.|$|R
40|$|Abstract: Creativity is an {{essential}} aspect of design thinking. Being able to describe creativity and creative processes is important for developing future designers. While much research has been undertaken describing creativity in design, {{there is very little}} investigating how creativity and creative thinking varies across disciplines. A coding scheme involving six separate codes was developed initially from the literature, refined and then used to describe how creativity and creative thinking was apparent in the DTRS 10 datasets of <b>Junior</b> <b>Industrial</b> Design, Graduate Industrial Design, Mechanical Engineering, Choreography and Entrepreneurship. Based on this analysis, conclusions on how creativity and creative thinking varied across the datasets were also reached. It was found that while all datasets analyzed included Process, Product and Press codes, how these were identified in the data varied. The three Personal codes were only identified in three of the datasets. This research has implications for investigating how to develop creativity and creative thinking skills in all designers...|$|R

5000|$|Pablo McCabe {{was also}} a local and almost {{the same age as}} Nora Wall. McCabe was handed over to St. Michael's {{industrial}} school in 1951 when he was a baby. [...] In 1988, McCabe addressed a gathering of the Sisters of Mercy in Gracedieu, Waterford. He spoke of being born in Dublin in 1949 to a single mother. She struggled until McCabe was three, but [...] "had great difficulty in working, paying for accommodation and paying someone to look after me." [...] Thus McCabe came to live in the [...] "old St. Michael’s", the <b>junior</b> <b>industrial</b> school run by the Sisters of Mercy in Cappoquin. His memories were [...] "very happy ones of caring and interested women." [...] He then went to the Industrial School at Artane, Dublin, which he found traumatic, because it had [...] "over nine hundred boys in a very strict set-up." [...] After leaving Artane, he began to drift and became involved with drugs, stealing to support his habit, and spent time in South America. He returned to Ireland in 1977, receiving treatment at St. Brendan's Hospital, though alcohol abuse remained a problem.|$|R
40|$|Teacher {{and student}} {{interaction}} in a design-studio setting, {{also referred to}} as tutorial-learning or learning-by-doing, has been the blueprint of design education for decades. A crucial difficulty of design education is that the content of these meetings remains remarkably implicit. In this study we propose to explore the concept of Design Grammar as an observation framework for teacher-student interactions. Design grammar can be defined as the visual language used to design, i. e., the elements, and relationships between them, that are synthesized in the Form (understood as a unified structure of parts) of an artifact. In order to make this concept operational we developed a Design Grammar Model (DGM) which explicits the different elements involved in form-giving in design. We used the DGM to analyze the content of the interactions of <b>junior</b> <b>Industrial</b> Design students. We compared the results in terms of the student and teacher’s fluency in Design Grammar (DG), the criteria to evaluate fluency was: the frequency of references to DG, variety of references and articulation of DG elements. The main insight of our study was the observation that interactions with students with lower fluency in DG resulted in poorer performances from the teacher and therefore lower quality interactions...|$|R

30|$|Technology-based {{solutions}} {{may offer}} some promise for better supporting and developing collaborative skills; however, technology alone {{has been shown}} to not be sufficient to effectively support collaboration (Hsu et al. 2014). In the current study, we examined the impact of student use on a technology and pedagogy—based solution for supporting engineering students engaged in meaningful collaborative design activities. We developed Google Drive Environment for Collaboration (GDEC)—to support collaborative design and problem-solving activities in a required <b>junior</b> level <b>Industrial</b> and Manufacturing Systems Engineering (IMSE) course—“Ergonomics and Workstation Design.” The environment was designed to address oft-encountered problems associated with collaboration, including regulating and monitoring tasks, and practical considerations such as access to collaborative artifacts from multiple locations and simultaneous editing of collaborative work.|$|R

Since 1991, {{on the weekend}} following Halloween, an in-house group, the [...] "Denton Drama Troupe," [...] has hosted a live performance of the Rocky Horror Picture Show in the Great Hall. Because both of these events draw hundreds of people, they generate the revenue that supports smaller projects. Other notable events include themed dinners, such as Harry Potter Night, first organized in 2005 by Risley Resident, Charlene Morales, {{who was at the}} time a <b>junior</b> in <b>Industrial</b> and Labor Relations. The event included a menu akin to several beloved dishes, snacks, and drinks such as [...] "butter beer" [...] unique to the Harry Potter film, drawing over 200+ guests. All dishes were uniquely crafted by kitchen director, Lorna McNab. The event was so beloved by all that it was then decreed a tradition.

40|$|The working class, largely {{excluded}} from college life before the twentieth century, obtained access {{to higher education}} through the two-year college movement, which began in 1901. "Junior colleges," a name that education scholars at elite universities invented to denote the new institutions, grew out of a desire to put higher education in service to business interests. <b>Junior</b> colleges trained <b>industrial</b> workers and provided transfer to four-year colleges for the most qualified students. Through tools such as first-year composition curricula and active guidance counseling programs, junior colleges frequently attempted to teach students lessons in competition, individuality, and meritocracy. Leaders of the movement feared social unrest would result from burgeoning labor movements and the rapid influx of immigrants from Eastern and Southern Europe and constructed disciplinary devices to squelch elements they perceived to be subversive and dangerous. Furthermore, leaders of the movement enjoyed support for their regressive ideology in the popular press, which legitimated the movement and helped to manufacture a need for the brands of education (e. g., vocationalism) the junior college came to promulgate...|$|R
