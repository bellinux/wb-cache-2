40|$|Nursing is a {{permanently}} developing {{field of}} activity. Research plays an irreplaceable {{role in this}} field. We moreover {{more and more often}} see the term Evidence Based Practice nowadays. However a lot of <b>general</b> <b>nurses</b> do not know that this term also relates to the field of nursing, where it is called Evidence Based Nursing. Quantitative research was chosen for this thesis. The research was performed in South Bohemian and Central Bohemian regions among <b>general</b> <b>nurses</b> with bachelor degree. The aim of the questionnaire research was to confirm or refute the hypotheses set for this thesis. The first goal of the thesis was to find out whether <b>general</b> <b>nurses</b> with bachelor degree were willing to participate in research in nursing. The second goal was to find out whether <b>general</b> <b>nurses</b> with bachelor degree had come across the term Evidence Based Practice. The third goal was focused on finding whether <b>general</b> <b>nurses</b> with bachelor degree knew the names of databases that might be used in planning nursing care based on evidence. The fourth goal was to find out whether <b>general</b> <b>nurses</b> with bachelor degree were willing to participate on application of research results to nursing practice. The fifth goal was to find out whether <b>general</b> <b>nurses</b> with bachelor degree had met with application of research results to nursing practice. The goals of the thesis have been met. Five hypotheses were set for achievement of the above goals. H 1 : <b>General</b> <b>nurses</b> with bachelor degree are willing to participate in research in nursing. H 2 : <b>General</b> <b>nurses</b> with bachelor degree are able to define the term Evidence Based Practice. H 3 : <b>General</b> <b>nurses</b> with bachelor degree know the names of databases they may use in planning nursing care based on evidence. H 4 : <b>General</b> <b>nurses</b> with bachelor degree are willing to participate in introduction and application of research results to nursing practice. H 5 : <b>General</b> <b>nurses</b> with bachelor degree meet application of research results to nursing practice. The first, second and fourth hypotheses were confirmed, the third and fifth ones were not confirmed. Although the issues of Evidence Based Practice appear more and more often in literature, and we might expect nurses with tertiary education to apply the practice based on evidence in nursing, there are still <b>general</b> <b>nurses</b> who have lack of information in this sphere. Nevertheless {{there are a lot of}} <b>general</b> <b>nurses</b> with tertiary education who would like to participate in research and application of the research results to nursing practice. A proposal for a whole-life educational course focused on application of Evidence Based Practice to nursing was elaborated upon the research results. The results may also be used in hospital seminars and in education of nursing students...|$|R

40|$|This work {{is aimed}} at the life {{priorities}} of a patient {{within the context of}} nursing. The research is focused on the ideas of <b>general</b> <b>nurses</b> of the preferred life priorities of a patient, if there are differences in the ideas of <b>general</b> <b>nurses</b> and the preferred life priorities of a patient, if <b>general</b> <b>nurses</b> take interest in the life priorities of a patient and if they include the work with life priorities within the nursing process. In order to do the research, the method of quantitative collection of data was used, with the aid of the questionnaire technique. Two questionnaires were formed. The first questionnaire, of my own making, for <b>general</b> <b>nurses</b> was distributed among nurses working in hospitals {{in the area of the}} city of Plzeň. The other questionnaire, of my own making, for patients was distributed among patients hospitalized or visiting particular departments in hospitals in the area of the city of Plzeň. The research was carried out with the approval of the head nurse. Four aims of this Bachelor's Thesis were stated. The first one aims at assessment of nurses' ideas of the life priorities of a patient and if they consider these an important part of the nursing process. The second aim deals with the question if <b>general</b> <b>nurses</b> are willing to include the work with the patient's life priorities within the nursing process. The third one focuses on the conditions that <b>general</b> <b>nurses</b> have in order to include the life priorities of a patient within the nursing process. The fourth aim deals with the differences between the life priorities preferred by patients and ideas of <b>general</b> <b>nurses</b> of patients' life priorities. <b>General</b> <b>nurses</b> mostly consider life priorities of a patient an important part of the nursing process and most of them are willing to include the work with life priorities of a patient in the nursing process. Patients mostly perceive the care of their life priorities from nurses' side as insufficient. Although illnesses have changed patients' life priorities, some of them could have become unaccomplished, not all <b>general</b> <b>nurses</b> are interested in each patient's life priorities. There have been differences between life priorities preferred by patients and ideas of <b>general</b> <b>nurses</b> of life priorities of patients. The specific theories have been affirmed: T 1 : <b>General</b> <b>nurses</b> consider working with life priorities of patients as important. T 2 : <b>General</b> <b>nurses</b> are willing to include the work with life priorities of patients into the nursing process, if certain conditions are granted. T 3 : Work with patients' life priorities within the nursing process is more frequently influenced by working conditions of <b>general</b> <b>nurses</b> than life priorities preferred by patients. This Bachelor's Thesis may be used when teaching students preparing for the a non-physician medical profession. It may be recommended to <b>general</b> <b>nurses</b> as well as management workers as a tool of increasing the quality of nursing care within psychosocial care...|$|R

40|$|Only {{satisfied}} medical staff, including <b>general</b> <b>nurses</b> {{can provide}} quality nursing care. Such an environment encompasses favourable working conditions. This thesis {{is focused on}} the satisfaction of <b>general</b> <b>nurses</b> working in the inpatient department of the hospital with working conditions. The theoretical part is divided into five chapters. The first chapter is dedicated to the profession of <b>general</b> <b>nurses.</b> It briefly describes the nursing profession in the past and present, and characterizes scope of work of a nurse. The second chapter deals with the nursing unit, its division and provided nursing care on a standard nursing unit and an intensive care unit. The third chapter is devoted to an explanation of the concept of working conditions and the field of occupational medicine, which deals with the influence of working conditions on employees' health. The fourth chapter discusses selected risk factors that can adversely affect the work of nurses and the last fifth chapter deals with the influence of management on the satisfaction of <b>general</b> <b>nurses</b> as managers significantly affect their working conditions. We set three objectives. The first objective was to determine whether <b>general</b> <b>nurses</b> are satisfied with their working conditions in České Budějovice Hospital, a. s. The second objective was to compare general nurses' satisfaction with their working conditions on standard nursing units and intensive care units. The third objective was to determine which factors most influence satisfaction of <b>general</b> <b>nurses</b> at the hospital of České Budějovice, a. s. To set objectives were set four research problems. Research problem 1 -Are <b>general</b> <b>nurses</b> satisfied with the working conditions in Hospital České Budějovice, a. s. ? Research problem 2 -Are <b>general</b> <b>nurses</b> working in intensive care units more satisfied with their working conditions than <b>general</b> <b>nurses</b> working in standard nursing units?Research problem 3 -Is one of the factors that most influence satisfaction of general nurses´ interpersonal relations in the workplace?The research problem 4 -Do <b>general</b> <b>nurses</b> consider satisfaction of financial remuneration to be an important factor? For the research survey was used quantitative data collection using an anonymous non-standardized questionnaire for nurses working on standard nursing units and intensive care units of selected departments in České Budějovice Hospital, a. s. The obtained data were processed into graphs and charts using Microsoft Office Excel 2007. The research sample consisted of 168 <b>general</b> <b>nurses,</b> of which 92 nurses working on a standard nursing unit and 76 nurses working in the ICU. Research problems were answered by obtained data. By research problem 1, we found that nurses are satisfied with their working conditions in České Budějovice Hospital, even though with smaller reservations. <b>General</b> <b>nurses</b> are satisfied with relationships at work, work organization, safety at work and positively assesses the financial remuneration. On the other hand, after work they often feel exhausted, they lack the praise from superiors and the number of nursing staff seems to be insufficient to them. By research problem 2, we examined whether the <b>general</b> <b>nurses</b> are satisfied with their working conditionson intensive care unit. From the survey results we can conclude the same level of satisfaction among nurses working on standard nursing units and intensive care units. The research problem 3 showed that the factors that most affect the satisfaction of <b>general</b> <b>nurses</b> include interpersonal relationships, economic reward, workplace equipment and job security. We also responded by this to research problem 4, when the financial evaluation factor was ranked second by <b>general</b> <b>nurses</b> in the list of factors influencing satisfaction. Nurses working in České Budějovice Hospital, a. s. are satisfiewith their working conditions, but there is also the possibility of further improvement. Results of the work will be offered to hospital management for review...|$|R
