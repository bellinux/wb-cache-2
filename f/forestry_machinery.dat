40|$|The {{estimation}} of operating costs of agricultural and <b>forestry</b> <b>machineries</b> {{is a key}} factor in both planning agricultural policies and farm management. Few works have tried to estimate operating costs and the produced models are normally based on deterministic approaches. Conversely, in the statistical model randomness is present and variable states are not described by unique values, but rather by probability distributions. In this study, for the first time, a multivariate statistical model based on Partial Least Squares (PLS) was adopted to predict the fuel consumption and costs of six agricultural operations such as: ploughing, harrowing, fertilization, sowing, weed control and shredding. The prediction was conducted on two steps: first of all few initial selected parameters (time per surface-area unit, maximum engine power, purchase price of the tractor and purchase price of the operating machinery) were used to estimate the fuel consumption; then the predicted fuel consumption together with the initial parameters were used to estimate the operational costs. Since the obtained models were based on an input dataset very heterogeneous, these resulted to be extremely efficient and so generalizable and robust. In details the results show prediction values in the test with r always ≥ 0. 91. Thus, the approach may results extremely useful for both farmers (in terms of economic advantages) and at institutional level (representing an innovative and efficient tool for planning future Rural Development Programmes and the Common Agricultural Policy). In light of these advantages the proposed approach may as well be implemented on a web platform and made available to all the stakeholders...|$|R

The obligation to negotiate did not, however, apply to firms without trade union representations and with less than 50 workers, even if a staff representative had been appointed as trade union delegate. A law of February 1986 amending the labour code included various changes e.g. to ensure that wage-earners received a stable income, independent of fluctuations in weekly working hours. A decree on the protection of workers exposed to benzene was issued on February 1986 with the purpose of simplifying and updating the relevant regulations, most of which dated back to 1939.

30|$|Many of {{the results}} concern {{difficulties}} in creating growth trajectories for emerging knowledge-intensive industries. In Finland, the knowledge creation processes are in good shape but the knowledge is poorly exploited. Start-ups get founded but high-growth entrepreneurship is very rare. According to this study, the most immediate causes are limited resources and poor international commercialization skills. These problems arise from the facts {{that there are no}} shared goals concerning the future of the industries. Academia, industry, and policy makers should together define clear targets for future developments and act accordingly. At the moment, lots of potential and effort is wasted because the actors in the innovation systems are not aligned to support each other. The Finnish economy has previously led by ICT, <b>forestry,</b> metal and <b>machinery</b> industries, and large enterprises.

40|$|The {{turnover}} {{of the companies}} in North Savo in 2011 was nearly 10 billion euros, of which industry accounted for just under a third. The industrial structure of the region is not strong, {{but on the other}} hand it is not alarmingly thin either, because it does have certain successful niches. North Savo's production and export growth has been on par with the average of other regions. The region is specialized in <b>forestry</b> and <b>machinery</b> industries as well as food production. The forest and machinery industries are export-oriented. Promising growth businesses include biopharmaceutical research, testing and production. These segments will be the engines of growth for the region in the future. In the forest industry the wood products industry is strong and its special products, such as heat treated wood, glue-laminated timber and hardwood floors, are selling well. Pulp and paper production have suffered losses, but the carton is in demand. In the machinery industry, power plant boilers, forestry tractors and mining machinery are global successes. Their production networks include a considerable number of local sub-contractors. Counterflow strategies will be the key to future development. The forest industry will evolve into a biotechnology industry, where decentralized local bio-oil production instead of large plants will play a large role. Clusters can be built around wooden apartment buildings. The key skills of the machinery industry should be kept as Savo's own secret, but the network of services and output should go global. In addition to timber, milk is one of the region's precious raw materials, the production of which should be safeguarded in the future. Research can facilitate processing of milk and timber into more lucrative products with higher value-added. Fresh, local and organic food production can be promoted via entrepreneurial training, product development, and use of competitive bidding in purchases of fresh food products by public institutions. Development of the pharmaceutical industry is following a dual strategy: the development of the biopharmaceutical industry is based on synergies and investing in research, entrepreneurship and the raising of risk capital. Neighbouring Russia is investing in the development of its pharmaceutical industry. Kuopio's medical cluster could participate by helping in the development of medicines, approval process, manufacturing and packaging, as well as marketing to Western markets. Industrial development requires close-knit co-operation with government departments.

40|$|Logging {{harvesters}} {{represent a}} set of high-performance modern <b>forestry</b> <b>machinery,</b> which can finish a series of continuous operations such as felling, delimbing, peeling, bucking and so forth with human intervention. It is found by experiment that {{during the process of}} the alignment of the harvesting head to capture the trunk, the operator needs a lot of observation, judgment and repeated operations, which lead to the time and fuel losses. In order to improve the operation efficiency and reduce the operating costs, the point clouds for standing trees are collected with a low-cost 2 D laser scanner. A cluster extracting algorithm and filtering algorithm are used to classify each trunk from the point cloud. On the assumption that every cross section of the target trunk is approximate a standard circle and combining the information of an Attitude and Heading Reference System, the radii and center locations of the trunks in the scanning range are calculated by the Fletcher-Reeves conjugate gradient algorithm.

40|$|Skidding {{by means}} of heavy <b>forestry</b> <b>machinery</b> can affect soil {{physical}} properties. We assessed the effects of ground based skidding on soil bulk density and total porosity under the Iranian mountainous forest conditions. Treatments included a combination of four levels of traffic intensity (1, 3, 6, and 15 passes) of a Timberjack 450 C rubber skidder and two levels of slope (20 %). The bulk density was highest in samples taken in the wheel tracks and between them, and decreased towards {{both ends of the}} track (0. 5 to 4 m). The results showed that bulk density increased with traffic frequency, while total porosity decreased. Average soil bulk density ranged from 0. 96 g cm- 3 (after one machine pass and slope 20 %) on the skid trail, while the respective value was 0. 7 g cm– 3 for the undisturbed area. On compacted soil, total porosity at the 0 – 10 cm depth decreased by 37 % compared with non-compacted soil. The results showed that slope steepness had a strong effect on the soil disturbance, with the critical value for bulk density occurring after 15 machine passes at slope 20 %. The impacts of soil compaction could be evidenced in a distance of up to 2 m {{from the end of the}} skidding trail.

In order to make it possible to CE-mark the new solution, it was importantMachinery Directive that came into effect from the beginning of 2010. To begin with, a specification of requirements was set up. Thereafter, anumber of different basic concepts was retrieved and evaluated. The chosenconcept was to use electro-mechanical actuators for the opening of the largeengine hood. A market research was made, where a number of differentactuators were chosen. Thereafter, a program that found possible placementsfor them was designed. Some of the alternatives were test assembled in theCAD-model of the machine, which gave information for a meeting with theEco-Log engineering team, where one final concept was to be chosen.

The objective {{of this study was}} to examine the applicability of GPS and radio beacon differential global positioning system (RBN DGPS) for <b>forestry</b> <b>machinery</b> positioning. This would be an important step toward the realization of site-specific chemical application in China. A Trimble AG 132 GPS receiver was mounted on a moveable platform and real-time differential GPS signals were obtained from the Yangtze River Beacon Station. The experiments were conducted on campus of Nanjing Forestry University, China. GPS data were collected and downloaded into a laptop computer via a RS- 232 serial port and customer-developed data-acquisition software. Two tests were conducted: (1) a stationary test (where the mobile platform was maintained at a fixed location) in an open sky and forest condition to examine the precision (repeatability) of GPS signals, and (2) a mobile test (where the platform was moving) to examine the dynamic conformity degree. Analysis of variance was used to clarify the effects of positioning mode and stand area on the precision of GPS. In the stationary test, the variability of X and Y coordinates is smaller in RBN DGPS mode than that in the non-differential mode; and the performance of GPS in terms of position dilution of precision, horizontal dilution of precision, vertical dilution of precision, time dilution of precision values, effective positioning rate and the number of visible satellites was superior when used in RBN DGPS mode. In the mobile test, the desired traces of the moveable platform (circles) were much better followed by the GPS locations recorded in the RBN DGPS mode. Compared with non-differential mode, RBN DGPS is more suitable for precision forestry positioning requirements. RBN DGPS improves accuracy both in open sky and forest condition, and the service is available to end users in China with no additional costs...|$|E
40|$|Oryx Simulations produce {{simulators}} for {{mining and}} <b>forestry</b> <b>machinery</b> used for educational and promotional purposes. The simulators use motion platforms to reflect how the vehicle moves within the simulator. This platform tilts and accelerates the driver {{in order to}} enhance the experience. Previously a classical washout filter algorithm has been used to control the platform which leaves something to be desired regarding how well it reflects the vehicles movement, {{how easy it is to}} tune and how it handles the limits of the platform. This thesis aims to produce a model that accurately reflects angles, velocities and accelerations while in the mean time respecting the limits of the platform. In addition to this the developed model should be easy to modify and tune. This is achieved using so-called Model Predictive Control which achieves the wanted behaviour by predicting how the platform will move based on its current state while implementing the constraints of the platform directly into the model. Since all of the parameters in the model are actual physical quantities, this makes the model easier to tune. A key component in this solution is the so-called tilt coordination which consists of substituting a lateral/longitudinal acceleration with the acceleration of gravity by tilting the driver. Constructing and implementing this model in Matlab we verify it by using data extracted from the simulator environment. We see that the parameters consisting of angles, rotational velocities and linear accelerations are tracked very well while respecting the constraints for the platform, constraints that can be easily changed to fit the current simulator. We also see that the model successfully implements tilt coordination into the behaviour of the platform. This model performs extraordinarily well in theory, what remains is to implement this to the motion platform and fine-tune it. Oryx Simulations tillverkar simulatorer i huvudsak för gruv- och skogsindustrinvilket används i utbildnings- och marknadsföringssyfte. Simulatorerna använder en röorelseplattform för att spegla hur fordonet i simulatormiljön rör sig. Denna plattform lutar och accelererar föraren för att förstarka upplevelsen. Tidigare har ett så kallat klassiskt washout-filter använts för att kontrollera plattformen som lämnar en del i övrigt att onska vad gäller hur väl fordonets rörelser speglas, hur lätt det ar att justera samt hur det hanterar plattformens begränsningar. Detta projekt ämnar producera en modell som väl speglar vinklar,hastigheter och accelerationer samtidigt som den respekterar plattformens gränser. I tillägg till detta bör modellen vara enkel att modifiera och justera. Detta uppnås genom så kallad Model Predictive Control som förutsager hur plattformen kommer röra sig utifrån dess aktuella tillstånd samtidigt som den respekterar de tvång som finns på plattformen direkt i modellen. Då alla parametrar i modellen är faktiska fysiska kvantiteter blir modellen märkbart lättare att justera. En viktig komponent i denna lösning är så kallad tilt coordination vilket består i att substituera lateral/longtudinell acceleration med en komposant av tyngdaccelerationen genom att luta föraren. Denna modell konstrueras och implementeras i Matlab och verifieras genom att använda extraherat data från den simulerade miljön. Vi kan se att parametrarna som består av vinklar, rotationella hastigheter och linjära accelerationer speglas väldigt väl, samtidigt som tvången på plattformen respekteras. Dessa tvång kan enkelt modieras for att passa den aktuella simulatorn. Vi ser även att modellen framgångsrikt implementerar tilt coordination i plattformens beteende. I teorin har denna modell väldigt bra prestanda; vad som kvarstår är att implementera den på en rörelseplattform och finjustera modellen...|$|E
