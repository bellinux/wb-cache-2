25|$|Nilsson is {{the subject}} of a 2006 documentary, Who Is Harry Nilsson (And Why <b>Is</b> <b>Everybody</b> Talkin' About Him)? {{produced}} by David Leaf and John Schienfeld. The film was screened in 2006 at the Seattle International Film Festival and the Santa Barbara International Film Festival. In August 2006, the film received its Los Angeles premiere when it was screened at the 7th Annual Mods & Rockers Film Festival followed by a panel discussion about Nilsson featuring the filmmakers and two friends of Nilsson, producer Richard Perry and attorney/executive producer Lee Blackman.|$|E
25|$|By 1958, Nilsson was {{intrigued}} by emerging forms of popular music, especially rhythm and blues artists like Ray Charles. He had made early attempts at performing while he {{was working at the}} Paramount, forming a vocal duo with his friend Jerry Smith and singing close harmonies {{in the style of the}} Everly Brothers. The manager at a favorite hangout gave Nilsson a plastic ukulele, which he learned to play, and he later learned to play the guitar and piano. In the 2006 documentary Who Is Harry Nilsson (And Why <b>Is</b> <b>Everybody</b> Talkin' About Him)?, Nilsson recalled that when he could not remember lyrics or parts of the melodies to popular songs, he created his own, which led to writing original songs.|$|E

[...] He also stated, [...] "Come the first episode back, you see who the seniors and juniors are." ...|$|E

500|$|Two other {{documented}} Community Trolls' {{songs are}} entitled [...] "Six Stock Answers" [...] and [...] "My Roof to Your Roof". [...] "Six Stock Answers", whose vocals are by Stipe, {{was used in}} an unreleased low-budget forty-five-minute Super-8 film called Just Like a Movie. It was shot in September 1983 in Athens by New York Rocker photographer Laura Levine, {{a friend of the}} members of R.E.M. Those with acting roles included Levine, Michael Stipe, Sweet, Hopper, Lynda Stipe, and R.E.M.'s Bill Berry. One scene in the film, a parody of the [...] "Subterranean Homesick Blues" [...] sequence in D. A. Pennebaker's Bob Dylan documentary Dont Look Back, shows Michael Stipe wearing a skirt and tights flipping placards with the song's lyrics, [...] "Six stock answers to 74,000 questions" [...] repeated ad nauseam.

500|$|Jackson had {{the highest}} royalty rate in the music {{industry}} at that point, approximately $2 for every album sold, and was making record-breaking profits from sales of his recordings. The videocassette of the documentary The Making of Michael Jackson's Thriller sold over 350,000 copies in a few months. The era saw the arrival of novelties such as dolls modeled after Jackson, which appeared in stores in May 1984 at a price of $12. Biographer J. Randy Taraborrelli writes that [...] "Thriller stopped selling like a leisure item—like a magazine, a toy, tickets to a hit movie—and started selling like a household staple." [...] In 1985, The Making of Michael Jackson's Thriller won a Grammy for Best Music Video, Longform. Time described Jackson's influence at that point as [...] "star of records, radio, rock video. A one-man rescue team for the music business. A songwriter who sets the beat for a decade. A dancer with the fanciest feet on the street. A singer who cuts across all boundaries of taste and style and color too". The New York Times wrote that [...] "in the world of pop music, there is Michael Jackson and there <b>is</b> <b>everybody</b> else".|$|E
500|$|The {{second part}} of the season, which begins with episode 11, takes place three months after the events of episode 10. On the {{structure}} of the season and shifting the focus between the two parts, Bell stated it was the intent to follow the format from season two, by tying [...] "a whole bunch of [...] but not all of them off by the midseason. And then we launch something exciting for the back half...the promise of more to come." [...] Whedon added that [...] "though we do break the season up, we feel that the season as a whole is one arc" [...] and so the series would explore the same themes in the second half, [...] "themes {{of what it means to}} be human and Inhuman. What does it mean to all these people when they have to live with their actions? Are they capable of the things their enemies are capable of?...What is the true nature of a person? <b>Is</b> <b>everybody</b> capable of everything if put in a terrible position? Or is there true good and a true evil?" [...] The second half of the season sees the introduction of the comics' right-wing hate group the Watchdogs, depicted as radicals wishing to [...] "eliminate the Inhumans", as well as a [...] "cure" [...] that can prevent terrigenisis in yet-to-transition Inhumans.|$|E

500|$|Blender {{described}} Jackson as the [...] "late 20th century's preeminent pop icon", while The New York Times {{gave the}} opinion {{that he was a}} [...] "musical phenomenon" [...] and that [...] "in the world of pop music, there is Michael Jackson and there <b>is</b> <b>everybody</b> else". Jackson changed the way the industry functioned: both as an artistic persona and as a financial, profitable entity. His attorney John Branca observed that Jackson achieved the highest royalty rate in the music industry to that point: approximately $2 (US$ in [...] dollars) for each album sold. As a result, Jackson earned record-breaking profits from compact disc sales and from the sale of copies of the documentary, The Making of Michael Jackson's Thriller, produced by Jackson and John Landis. Funded by MTV, the film sold over 350,000 copies in its first few months. In a market then driven by singles, Thriller raised the significance of albums, yet its multiple hit singles changed perceived notions as to the number of successful singles that could be taken from an individual album. The era saw the arrival of novelties like the Michael Jackson doll, that appeared in stores in May 1984 at a price of $12 (US$ in [...] dollars). Thriller retains a position in American culture; biographer J. Randy Taraborrelli explains, [...] "At some point, Thriller stopped selling like a leisure item—like a magazine, a toy, tickets to a hit movie—and started selling like a household staple".|$|E

I mean, if you take a little bit more time to prep on three cameras, or if it's a big stunt, eleven cameras, and– whilst it may take 45 minutes to set up– then when you're ready you say 'Action!', and you do three takes, two takes and <b>is</b> <b>everybody</b> happy?

[...] He also stated that he was linked to Mazhar Majeed as a player agent but not in any spot-fixing. He also stated that the video can easily be edited and modified and manipulated. One day before the hearing, Butt continued to state his innocence. The tribunal announced that a verdict on the decision had been deferred to 5 February 2011 and that the ICC also stated that the tribunal would rule on charges pertaining to the third Test match between England and Pakistan. Butt was the only player before the tribunal to face these additional charges.|$|E

2500|$|Upon {{learning}} of his death, Dahmer's mother Joyce Flint responded angrily to the media: [...] "Now <b>is</b> <b>everybody</b> happy? Now that he's bludgeoned to death, {{is that good}} enough for everyone?" [...] The response of the families of Dahmer's victims was mixed, although it appears most were pleased with his death. The district attorney who prosecuted Dahmer cautioned against turning Scarver into a folk hero, noting that Dahmer's death was still murder. On May 15, 1995, Scarver was sentenced to two additional terms of life imprisonment for the murders of Dahmer and Anderson. Although Scarver had confessed in 1994 to having concealed the weapon used to kill Dahmer and Anderson in his clothing {{on the morning of}} the murders, in 2015 he publicly stated the murders of Dahmer and Anderson had resulted from a confrontation in which one of the two men had poked him (Scarver) in the back as the three had begun their assigned work detail. In this renewed account of events, Scarver claimed that the two had laughed at him when he had turned around in response before Dahmer and Anderson each walked to separate rooms to begin their cleaning duty, with Scarver following Dahmer toward the staff locker room.|$|E
2500|$|On May 20, 2010, Nick Gillespie and Matt Welch of Reason {{announced}} {{the winners of}} the publication's [...] "Everybody Draw Mohammed Day" [...] contest. Gillespie and Welch warned the reader not to view the image [...] "if you are offended by graphical representations of the Prophet Mohammed." [...] Of the images highlighted, Gillespie and Welch explained: [...] "The single most important element–and the thing that ties these selections together–is that each image forces the viewer to do two things. First, they consciously call into question the nature of representation, no small matter in fights over whether it is allowed under Islamic law to depict Mohammed ... Second, each of the images forces the viewer to actively participate not simply in the creation of meaning but of actually constructing the image itself." [...] There were two images in the position of runner-up – one was an artistic rendition of a tobacco smoking pipe. The depiction references surrealist artist René Magritte, and includes the text, [...] "This is not a pipe. This is Muhammed." [...] The Reason journalists commented that the image toyed with Magritte's [...] "famous statement about the necessary disjuncture between a picture and the thing it seeks to represent." [...] The second runner-up was a parody of the Where's Waldo? series, and the winner was a connect the dots picture. Commenting on the winner of the Reason contest, Gillespie and Welch concluded, [...] "There is a deeper lesson here: Connect the dots and discover that we all must be Spartacus on Everybody Draw Mohammad Day. And that in a free society, every day <b>is</b> <b>Everybody</b> Draw Mohammed Day." ...|$|E
