5|$|Because of its <b>geographic</b> <b>position,</b> Croatia {{represents}} {{a blend of}} four different cultural spheres. It has been a crossroad of influences of the western culture and the east—ever since division of the Western Roman Empire and the Byzantine Empire—as {{well as of the}} Mitteleuropa and the Mediterranean culture. The Illyrian movement was the most significant period of national cultural history, as the 19th-century period proved crucial in emancipation of the Croatian language and saw unprecedented developments in all fields of art and culture, giving rise to a number of historical figures.|$|E
5|$|The Denver MSA has a gross {{metropolitan}} {{product of}} $157.6 billion in 2010, {{making it the}} 18th largest metro economy in the United States. Denver's economy is based partially on its <b>geographic</b> <b>position</b> and its connection {{to some of the}} country's major transportation systems. Because Denver is the largest city within , it has become a natural location for storage and distribution of goods and services to the Mountain States, Southwest states, as well as all western states. Another benefit for distribution is that Denver is nearly equidistant from large cities of the Midwest, such as Chicago and St. Louis and some large cities of the West Coast, such as Los Angeles and San Francisco.|$|E
5|$|By the 16th century, {{control of}} Nakhichevan {{passed to the}} Safavid dynasty of Persia. Because of its <b>geographic</b> <b>position,</b> it {{frequently}} suffered during the earlier wars between Persia and the Ottoman Empire in the 14th to 18th centuries. In 1604–1605, Shah Abbas I, concerned that the lands of Nakhichevan and the surrounding areas could potentially pass into Ottoman hands, decided to institute a scorched earth policy. He forced some 300,000 Armenians, including the Armenian population of Nakhichevan {{to leave their homes}} and move to the Persian provinces south of the Aras River. After the last 1826-1828 Russo-Persian War, Nakhichevan became part of Russia per the Treaty of Turkmenchay after Persia's forced ceding. Alexandr Griboyedov, the Russian envoy to Persia, reported that 1,228 Armenian families from Persia migrated to Nakhichevan, while prior to their migration there were 2,024 Muslim and 404 Armenian families living in the province.|$|E

5|$|In {{addition}} to his official cult, Unas was deified and became a local god of the Saqqara necropolis. Grimal attributes this directly to the grandeur of his funerary complex. Malek doubts {{the existence of a}} popular cult of Unas during the Old Kingdom but acknowledges it from the Middle Kingdom onwards. He attributes this Middle Kingdom revival to the <b>geographic</b> <b>position</b> of Unas' complex making it a natural gateway to the Saqqara necropolis. The popular cult of the deified Unas continued for nearly 2,000 years as shown by the numerous scarabs bearing Unas' name found in Saqqara and dated from the New Kingdom (c.1550c.1077 BC) until the Late Period (664332 BC). The epicenter of this cult was not the pyramid of Unas nor the associated mortuary temple but rather the statues of the king in the valley temple.|$|E
5|$|Belgrade has wildly varying {{architecture}}, {{from the}} center of Zemun, typical of a Central European town, to the more modern architecture and spacious layout of New Belgrade. The oldest architecture is found in Kalemegdan Park. Outside of Kalemegdan, the oldest buildings date only from the 18th century, due to its <b>geographic</b> <b>position</b> and frequent wars and destructions. The oldest public structure in Belgrade is a nondescript Turkish türbe, while the oldest house is a modest clay house on Dorćol, from late 18th century. Western influence began in the 19th century, when the city completely transformed from an oriental town to the contemporary architecture of the time, with influences from neoclassicism, romanticism, and academic art. Serbian architects took over the development from the foreign builders in the late 19th century, producing the National Theatre, Old Palace, Cathedral Church and later, in the early 20th century, the National Assembly and National Museum, influenced by art nouveau. Elements of Neo-Byzantine architecture are present in buildings such as Vuk's Foundation, old Post Office in Kosovska street, and sacral architecture, such as St. Mark's Church (based on the Gračanica monastery), and the Temple of Saint Sava.|$|E

Thus, the actions required for an attacker to get a chance at breaking anonymity are (i) the attacker has to initiate secure connections towards all known users (whose HITs are cached) and simultaneously try to obtain the geographic locations of such users; (ii) the attacker must promiscuously listen to the on-going traffic in the network and locate geographically the sources and destinations of that traffic, which possibly requires being able to gain awareness of all the transmission events that take place in a network; (iii) the attacker will compare the <b>geographic</b> <b>positions</b> of known users (whose HIT is known) against the <b>geographic</b> <b>positions</b> of sources and destinations of traffic being traced, and attempt to guess the IP-to-HIT mapping table, thus breaking anonymity.|$|R

25|$|Specific Ottoman {{interest}} in Habeshistan arose from its pivotal <b>geographic</b> <b>position</b> in the region: it had ports and coastline {{on both the}} Red Sea (and near the Bab-el-Mandeb, where Ottoman blockades could be performed if necessary) and on the Indian Ocean (specifically Zeila and the Somali coast).

What saved Bosnia at this time was its vast heavy industrial complex that was able to switch to military hardware production. In August 1992, HOS leader Blaž Kraljević was killed by HVO soldiers, severely weakening the moderate group which had hoped to keep the alliance between Bosniaks and Croats alive.|$|E

25|$|Due to its {{fortunate}} <b>geographic</b> <b>position</b> and {{the considerable}} number of important settlements, such as Tharros, the Sinis peninsula was a bridgehead for the routes towards the Balearic Islands and the Iberian peninsula, related from time immemorial to Sardinia. The Balearic Islands were in fact home to the Talaiotic culture, similar under many aspects to the Nuragic and Torrean civilizations. The Sinis peninsula is furthermore favoured by the proximity of Montiferru, a region that hosts an ancient volcano, site of important iron and coppers mines. The territory of Montiferru is also strictly controlled by a system of numerous nuraghes.|$|E
