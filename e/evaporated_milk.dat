Sopas is normally associated with the cold, rainy season in the Philippines, and may thus be regarded as local comfort food.|$|E
25|$|Milk {{macaroni}} products – {{the same}} as macaroni products except that milk or a specified milk product is used as the sole moistening ingredient in preparing the dough. Other than milk, allowed milk products include concentrated milk, <b>evaporated</b> <b>milk,</b> dried milk, and a mixture of butter with skim, concentrated skim, evaporated skim, or nonfat dry milk, in any combination, with the limitation {{on the amount of}} milk solids relative to amount of milk fat.|$|E
25|$|In many dairy industries, salt {{is added}} to cheese as a color-, fermentation-, and texture-control agent. The dairy subsector {{includes}} companies that manufacture creamery butter, condensed and <b>evaporated</b> <b>milk,</b> frozen desserts, ice cream, natural and processed cheese, and specialty dairy products. In canning, salt is primarily added as a flavor enhancer and preservative. It also {{is used as a}} carrier for other ingredients, dehydrating agent, enzyme inhibitor and tenderizer. In baking, salt {{is added to}} control the rate of fermentation in bread dough. It also is used to strengthen the gluten (the elastic protein-water complex in certain doughs) and as a flavor enhancer, such as a topping on baked goods. The food-processing category also contains grain mill products. These products consist of milling flour and rice and manufacturing cereal breakfast food and blended or prepared flour. Salt is also used a seasoning agent, e.g. in potato chips, pretzels, cat and dog food.|$|E
50|$|Under US Patent 764,294, Just {{began to}} employ his new method of <b>evaporating</b> <b>milk</b> into a dried powder. The {{technique}} (later {{known as the}} Just Milk Process) involves first treating a sample of milk with calcium chloride to reduce its acidity and then with alkaline hypochlorite to preserve the fatty acids in the finished product. The treated milk is then rolled between two large, horizontal steam-heated rollers. This action dries the milk; it is then scraped off and collected.|$|R
5000|$|One of {{the most}} common desserts is called Tres Leches, {{translated}} to [...] "three milks" [...] in English. It is a wet cake composed primarily of milk and sugar. The ingredients include: whole <b>milk,</b> <b>evaporated</b> skim <b>milk,</b> sweetened condensed milk, as well as heavy cream, eggs, sugar, ground cinnamon, baking powder, vanilla extract, and dark rum. It is available at most typical restaurants and is usually eaten after lunch or dinner.|$|R
50|$|Powdered milk {{or dried}} milk is a {{manufactured}} dairy product made by <b>evaporating</b> <b>milk</b> to dryness. One purpose of drying milk {{is to preserve}} it; milk powder has a far longer shelf life than liquid milk and {{does not need to}} be refrigerated, due to its low moisture content. Another purpose is to reduce its bulk for economy of transportation. Powdered milk and dairy products include such items as dry whole milk, nonfat (skimmed) dry milk, dry buttermilk, dry whey products and dry dairy blends. Many dairy products exported conform to standards laid out in Codex Alimentarius. Many forms of milk powder are traded on exchanges.|$|R
500|$|On {{returning}} to Paramount, the art department had to recreate parts of Yellowstone {{in a large}} [...] "B tank", [...] long. The tank {{was designed to be}} flooded with millions of gallons of water to represent large bodies of water. Minor set up miniatures on the tank's floor before construction and made sure that the shadows that fell on Spock at Yellowstone could be properly recreated. A plywood base was built on metal platforms to create stone silhouettes, reinforced with chicken wire. Polyurethane foam was sprayed over the framework {{under the supervision of the}} Los Angeles Fire Department. The bottom part of the statue miniature was represented by a [...] high fiberglass foot. Weldon matched the effects filmed at Yellowstone using dry ice and steam machines. To recreate the appearance of the swirling eddies of water in the real Yellowstone, a combination of <b>evaporated</b> <b>milk,</b> white poster paint, and water was poured into the set's pools. The pressure of the steam channeled into the pools through hidden tubing causes enough movement in the whirlpools to duplicate the location footage. Due to the requirement that the sun be in a specific location for filming and that the environment be bright enough, production fell behind schedule when it was unseasonably cloudy for three days straight. Any further scenes to recreate Vulcan would be impossible, as the set was immediately torn down to serve as a parking lot for the remainder of the summer.|$|E
2500|$|In the 1920s and 1930s, <b>evaporated</b> <b>milk</b> {{began to}} be widely commercially {{available}} at low prices, and several clinical studies suggested that babies fed <b>evaporated</b> <b>milk</b> formula thrive as well as breastfed babies ...|$|E
2500|$|These {{findings}} are {{not supported by}} modern research.

40|$|A {{clinical}} and biochemical evaluation {{has been made}} of a new milk formula, Modified Carnation milk (MCM), based on cows' milk but with the mineral content and concentration of caloric nutrients altered to make it correspond more closely to human milk. MCM produced higher plasma calcium and magnesium concentrations in 6 -day-old infants than those produced by unmodified <b>evaporated</b> and dried <b>milks,</b> achieving concentrations closer to those of breast milk. Plasma free amino acid concentrations in MCM-fed infants are nearer breast-fed values than those in unmodified milk-fed infants where higher individual plasma amino acid concentrations persist during the first 3 months. MCM-fed infants had low plasma urea concentrations and lower urine osmolalities at 6 days, 3 weeks, 6 weeks, 3 months, and 6 months than infants fed on the <b>evaporated</b> and dried <b>milks,</b> and similar plasma urea and urine osmolalities to those of breast-fed infants. MCM is likely to be superior to unmodified <b>evaporated</b> and dried <b>milks</b> in preventing convulsions of the hypocalcaemic/hypomagnesaemic/hyperphosphataemic type, and seems less likely to cause hypertonic dehydration. MCM is easily prepared, readily accepted by babies, and appears to be nutritionally adequate for the feeding of term infants...|$|R

2500|$|In {{the late}} 1920s, Alfred Bosworth {{released}} Similac (for [...] "similar to lactation"), and Mead Johnson released Sobee. [...] Several other formulas were released {{over the next}} few decades, but commercial formulas did not begin to seriously compete with <b>evaporated</b> <b>milk</b> formulas until the 1950s. The reformulation and concentration of Similac in 1951, and the introduction (by Mead Johnson) of Enfamil (for [...] "infant meal") in 1959 were accompanied by marketing campaigns that provided inexpensive formula to hospitals and pediatricians. [...] By the early 1960s, commercial formulas were more commonly used than <b>evaporated</b> <b>milk</b> formulas in the United States, which all but vanished in the 1970s. By the early 1970s, over 75% of American babies were fed on formulas, almost entirely commercially produced.|$|E
2500|$|In {{order to}} prevent spoilage, milk can be kept {{refrigerated}} and stored between [...] in bulk tanks. Most milk is pasteurized by heating briefly and then refrigerated to allow transport from factory farms to local markets. The spoilage of milk can be forestalled by using ultra-high temperature (UHT) treatment. Milk so treated can be stored unrefrigerated for several months until opened but has a characteristic [...] "cooked" [...] taste. Condensed milk, made by removing most of the water, {{can be stored in}} cans for many years, unrefrigerated, as can <b>evaporated</b> <b>milk.</b> The most durable form of milk is powdered milk, which is produced from milk by removing almost all water. The moisture content is usually less than 5% in both drum- and spray-dried powdered milk.|$|E
2500|$|Hong Kong style waffle, in Hong Kong {{called a}} [...] "grid cake" [...] or [...] "grid biscuits" [...] (格仔餅), is a waffle usually made and sold by street hawkers and eaten warm on the street. It {{is similar to}} a {{traditional}} waffle but larger, round in shape and divided into four quarters. It is usually served as a snack. Butter, peanut butter and sugar are spread {{on one side of the}} cooked waffle, and then it is folded into a semicircle to eat. Eggs, sugar and <b>evaporated</b> <b>milk</b> are used in the waffle recipes, giving them a sweet flavor. They are generally soft and not dense. Traditional Hong Kong style waffles are full of the flavor of yolk. Sometimes different flavors, such as chocolate and honey melon, are used in the recipe and create various colors. Another style of Hong Kong waffle is the eggette or gai daan jai (鷄蛋仔), which have a ball-shaped pattern.|$|E
