5|$|The {{precursors}} for systemin and AtPEP1 are both processed to yield one active peptide from the C-terminus of the precursor. It {{has been speculated}} that ProAtPEP1 is processed by CONSTITUTIVE DISEASE RESISTANCE 1, an apoplastic aspartic protease. The precursors to HypSys are processed <b>into</b> <b>more</b> <b>than</b> one active peptide. In tobacco, it is processed into two peptides, in petunia into three, and in sweet potato, possibly into six. At 291 amino acids long, the precursor to HypSys in sweet potato is the longest precursor described. The production of multiple signalling peptides from one precursor is a common feature found in animals.|$|E

The hill was divided into lots around the Weybridge Golf Club, which was designed by Harry Colt in 1912. Many of the original houses on the estate were built by master builder Walter George Tarrant whose firm constructed the original external garage ca.1920 (demolished ca.1995).|$|E

5|$|STRAT-X, or Strategic-Experimental, was a U.S. government-sponsored study {{conducted}} during 1966 and 1967 that comprehensively analyzed the potential {{future of the}} U.S. nuclear deterrent force. At the time, the Soviet Union was making significant strides in nuclear weapons delivery, and also constructing anti-ballistic missile defenses to protect strategic facilities. To address a potential technological {{gap between the two}} superpowers, U.S. Secretary of Defense Robert McNamara entrusted the classified STRAT-X study to the Institute for Defense Analyses, which compiled a twenty-volume report in nine months. The report looked <b>into</b> <b>more</b> <b>than</b> one hundred different weapons systems, ultimately resulting in the MGM-134 Midgetman and LGM-118 Peacekeeper intercontinental ballistic missiles, the s, and the Trident submarine-launched ballistic missiles, among others. Journalists have regarded STRAT-X as a major influence on the course of U.S. nuclear policy.|$|E
5|$|Some {{instruments}} fall <b>into</b> <b>more</b> <b>than</b> one category: for example, {{the cello}} {{may be considered}} tenor, baritone or bass, depending on how its music fits into the ensemble, and the trombone may be alto, tenor, baritone, or bass and the French horn, bass, baritone, tenor, or alto, depending on the range it is played in. Many instruments have their range {{as part of their}} name: soprano saxophone, tenor saxophone, baritone horn, alto flute, bass guitar, etc. Additional adjectives describe instruments above the soprano range or below the bass, for example: sopranino saxophone, contrabass clarinet. When used in the name of an instrument, these terms are relative, describing the instrument's range in comparison to other instruments of its family and not in comparison to the human voice range or instruments of other families. For example, a bass flute's range is from C3 to F♯6, while a bass clarinet plays about one octave lower.|$|E
5|$|The {{country was}} first divided into several {{administrative}} units during the Anuradhapura Kingdom. The kingdom {{was divided into}} three provinces; Rajarata, Ruhuna and Malaya Rata.

However, with the country eventually being divided <b>into</b> <b>more</b> <b>than</b> one kingdom and with foreign colonial missions landing and taking {{parts of the country}} under their control, this structure began to change. The territory of the Kotte Kingdom was organized into four disavas, which were further subdivided into forty korales. The korales had their own civil and military officials with a small militia. The Jaffna kingdom appears to have had a similar administrative structure to this with four provinces.|$|E
