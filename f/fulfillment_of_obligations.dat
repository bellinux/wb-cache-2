40|$|OIC原则指出,一个行为如果是人们的义务,那么该行为就是人们能够完成的。相应地也可以说,当一个行为是人们不能够完成的,那么它就不是人们的义务。根据该原则,“义务“应该在关于人们“能够“做的行为的考察中诞生,而不是根据“美德“来制定。实际上,“美德“并不先于在OIC原则支配下的“义务“而产生,反而是在人们履行“义务“并进而对行为予以评价的过程中逐步形成的。而根据OIC原则,当当事人“不能够“时,原义务就已然终止,这时需要根据人们是否过失或者故意导致“不能够“的发生来确定当事人是否应该承担责任,并且以当前人们“能够“做的事情为基础确定新的义务。如果在现实生活中人们确实认可并按照这样的方式来操作,那么这恰恰也证明OIC原则是可接受的。The {{principle}} of"Ought Imply Can"(OIC) says that,if {{an action}} {{taken out of}} people's obligation,then it can be accomplished. Therefore,an action is no longer people's obligation when it cannot be accomplished. Accordingly,obligation is formed by checking the actions people perform instead of by their virtue. Virtue is indeed not prior to obligation dominated by OIC,but forms in graduation by evaluating the <b>fulfillment</b> <b>of</b> <b>obligation.</b> According to OIC,when an agent is unable to fulfill an accomplishment,original obligation ends there.

We examine the empirical evidence linking each of the frameworks to employees’ organizational citizenship behavior (OCB). Relationships based on minimal investment (quasi-spot contracts and transactional psychological contracts) and psychological contract breach are negatively related to OCB. Economic exchange is unrelated to OCB. Relationships that demonstrate investment, support, <b>fulfillment</b> <b>of</b> <b>obligations,</b> and granting of idiosyncratic deals are positively related to OCB because they signal a trusting and benefit conferring relationship.
