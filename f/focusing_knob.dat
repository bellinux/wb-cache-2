An input axle penetrates through the hole {{on the center of}} the holder shelf and is pushed and tightened by three surrounding balls. The fine <b>focusing</b> <b>knob</b> connects to the input axle while the fast <b>focusing</b> <b>knob</b> connects to the holder shelf. On the other side, the axle from the Crayford focuser is connected to the holder shelf.|$|E

50|$|The {{enlarged}} view below shows {{the left hand}} spikes to be slightly further apart than those on the right. This {{is an indication that}} the <b>focus</b> <b>knob</b> needs to be rotated slightly anti-clockwise. If the right hand spikes were further apart, a clockwise rotation would be needed. The mask should always be placed over the aperture with the same orientation. If the mask was rotated 180 degrees, then the <b>focus</b> <b>knob</b> directions would be reversed. The operator soon becomes familiar with the rotation directions needed for a given setup.|$|R

The optical microscopes are still being used widely in the scientific research especially by researcher and medical practitioners. Manually deal with the microscope could make the user {{spend so much time}} to obtain the result of cleared image. It could cost hours to obtain the desire result. From this problem, {{the author would like to}} introduce a hardware system for auto focused of optical microscope. There consist of two stepper motor that will be function to control the fine <b>focus</b> <b>knob</b> and the course <b>focus</b> <b>knob.</b> The timing belts are being used as mounting between the stepper motor and the fine/course <b>focus</b> <b>knob.</b> The motor will moves step by step in same degree given from the command of programming.

50|$|The Realist 45 also {{differs from}} the Kodak Stereo Camera in several ways: the Realist 45 film {{transport}} features a swing-out lever that allows rapid winding, a handy feature for those wishing {{to take a lot}} of shots quickly. Unlike the Kodak, the Realist 45 has a top-mounted <b>focusing</b> <b>knob</b> that moves the film plane in a fashion similar to the standard Realist. There is a depth-of-field scale built into the knob which goes up to f/16. The top-mounted exposure counter counts up rather than down, like the Kodak counter.|$|E

25|$|The basic oscilloscope, {{as shown}} in the illustration, is {{typically}} divided into four sections: the display, vertical controls, horizontal controls and trigger controls. The display is usually a CRT or LCD panel which is laid out with both horizontal and vertical reference lines referred to as the graticule. In addition to the screen, most display sections are equipped with three basic controls: a <b>focus</b> <b>knob,</b> an intensity knob and a beam finder button.|$|R
50|$|A {{dual speed}} focuser can provide two {{focusing}} speeds {{by using a}} set of co-axial knobs, one for fast focusing and another for fine focusing when the film or CCD is near the perfect focal plane. This {{is different from the}} two separate <b>focusing</b> <b>knobs</b> seen on low level microscopes. Another common reason to employ a dual-speed focuser is with the use of short focal length eyepieces, where the depth of focus is short, requiring critically accurate focusing.|$|R
5000|$|Later-model cameras {{featured}} a double exposure button, {{which could be}} pulled {{out to make a}} double exposure but could otherwise be left alone, as well as a depth-of-field scale on the <b>focusing</b> <b>knob.</b> Many also had red marks on f/6.3, 1/50 and on 20 feet. This was called the [...] "The Three R's in Outdoor Stereo Photography" [...] and is based on the then-standard ASA 10 color slide film. Earlier cameras lacked these features but they could be added. The double exposure button would have to be installed by the factory, but the depth-of-field scale and red marks could be added by a dealer or even the camera's owner. Thus, older model Realists are sometimes found with red marks or depth-of-field scales, but without double exposure buttons.|$|E
50|$|Hans Hass, the {{underwater}} diving pioneer, approached Franke & Heidecke {{to see if}} they could make him a special housing suitable for underwater photography. As a result, Rollei developed the Rolleimarin, an ingenious underwater camera housing rated for depths up to 100 m. It was made from two cast metal parts. The top part contained a glass prism that was attached to the camera's focusing screen. There were also knobs on top of the housing for adjusting the exposure and aperture settings. On the bottom, left-hand side of the housing was the <b>focusing</b> <b>knob,</b> and on the right-hand side, the winding handle and a frame counter. There was also a filter turret. A special flash bulb could be attached for flash photography, in which case a battery pack had to be installed inside the housing. Of course, a viewfinder frame could also be screwed onto the housing.|$|E

Methods: In this prospective cross-sectional study 79 eyes of 42 healthy subjects were enrolled. The age, gender, and eye (right vs left) of each subject were recorded. The Stratus OCT fast macular thickness scan protocol was used and the macular thickness was measured with retinal thickness map analysis. Each eye was imaged at least six times to acquire images with signal strengths of 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, and 9 out of 10 via adjustment of the <b>focusing</b> <b>knob.</b> The OCT parameters included in the analysis were thickness in the central 1 mm and in the different quadrants in the 3 -mm area. Results: Overall 79 eyes of 42 patients {{with a mean age of}} 38. 4 ± 12. 4 were included. There was no significant difference between the signal strength measurements obtained with different signal strengths in the central thickness (P= 0. 20). In the superior, nasal, inferior, and temporal quadrants, a signal strength of 8 demonstrated up to 3 µm thicker measurements than a signal strength of 5 (P< 0. 05). In general linear regression analysis, after accounting for age and gender, signal strength did not remain a significant predictor of thickness in any quadrant. Conclusions: When using fast map macular measurements, a signal strength of 5 is clinically as efficient as a signal strength of 8 in measuring macular thickness in all quadrants. Insisting on higher signal strength may not be necessary. Keywords: macular thickness, signal strength, Stratus OCT, fast map macular measurement, retinal thicknes...|$|E
5000|$|For varmint and {{pest control}} in urban areas, air guns make {{suitable}} choices. While the limited power {{of an air}} rifle (generally far less than a [...]22 Long Rifle) limits its usefulness to small rodents at very short range, the limited penetration and low noise allows them {{to be used in}} areas where use of firearms is illegal or impractical. The popular air gun sport of field target is based on small game and varmint shooting, with targets often shaped like rabbits, squirrels, and other suitable small varmints. The low velocities of air gun pellets makes accurate range estimation paramount, so high magnification telescopic sights are used, with calibrated <b>focus</b> <b>knobs</b> that serve to estimate the range.|$|R

40|$|A {{system for}} {{maintaining}} long‐term focus of samples under high‐magnification quantitative observation in an epi‐illumination optical microscope is described. A negative feedback signal is generated from focus‐dependent {{changes in the}} backreflection of an off‐axis HeNe laser. This reflection is intercepted by a small prism downbeam from the standard trinocular head, and detected by a small two‐photodiode array. Spontaneous drifts in sample focus (presumably due to thermal and mechanical relaxations) are detected as a nonzero difference signal, {{which is used to}} drive a dc motor mechanically coupled to the fine‐focus knob of the microscope. This system has several advantages: (1) it is completely compatible and nonobstrusive with concurrent data acquisition of sample intensities; (2) it requires no alteration of the sample, sample stage, or objective; (3) it monitors the focal position of sample areas very near to those under observation; (4) it is inexpensive. In an experimental test, the system can hold a thin glass coverslip sample (a common substrate for biological cell cultures) to within 0. 5 μm of its preset focus position, well within the depth of focus of the microscope. Without the system, such samples typically drift several micrometers over periods of 10 min. In response to a disturbance of the <b>focus</b> <b>knob,</b> the system can restore the focus to within 0. 5 μm of the preset position...|$|R

40|$|In {{recent years}} live cell {{fluorescence}} microscopy {{has become increasingly}} important in biological and medical studies. This {{is largely due to}} new genetic engineering techniques which allow cell features to grow their own fluorescent markers. A popular example is green fluorescent protein. This avoids the need to stain, and thereby kill, a cell specimen before taking fluorescence images, and thus provides a major new method for observing live cell dynamics. With this new opportunity come new challenges. Because in earlier days the process of staining killed the cells, microscopists could do little additional harm by squashing the preparation to make it flat, thereby making it easier to image with a high resolution, shallow depth of field lens. In modern live cell fluorescence imaging, the specimen may be quite thick (in optical terms). Yet a single 2 D image per time–step may still be sufficient for many studies, {{as long as there is}} a large depth of field as well as high resolution. Light is a scarce resource for live cell fluorescence microscopy. To image rapidly changing specimens the microscopist needs to capture images quickly. One of the chief constraints on imaging speed is the light intensity. Increasing the illumination will result in faster acquisition, but can affect specimen behaviour through heating, or reduce fluorescent intensity through photobleaching. Another major constraint is the depth of field. Working at high resolution gives a very thin plane of focus, leading to the need to constantly “hunt ” with the <b>focus</b> <b>knob</b> while viewing thick specimens with rapidly moving or changing features. When recording data, such situations require the time-consuming capture of multiple focal planes, thus making it nearly impossible to perform many live cell studies. Ideally we would like to achieve the following goals: • use all available light to acquire images quickly, • achieve maximum lateral resolution, • and yet have a large depth of field. However, such goals are contradictory in a normal microscope. For a high aperture aplanatic lens, the depth of field is [18] 2...|$|R

40|$|An {{interactive}} {{microcomputer system}} has been developed for the quantitative analysis of Golgi-impregnated neuronal morphology (GINM). The system uses commercially available hardware: a 48 K RAM microcomputer (Apple II), a TV monitor (NEC), an optical microscope (Reichert Biovar) with a camera lucida and a specially developed wheel attached to the <b>focus</b> adjustment <b>knob</b> and to a digital planimeter (Tamaya), allowing one to obtain {{the value of the}} z-coordinate. The x- and y-coordinates are obtained using the movement of a point plotted by the computer on the TV monitor. This point is superimposed upon the GINM point to be codified employing the camera lucida. The x- and y-coordinates are acquired automatically while the variations of the z-coordinate are introduced by the computer keyboard. The three-dimensional coordinates of the selected GINM points and different codes are stored by the computer in a six-dimensional array. The software is written in BASIC. The results demonstrate that the digitization and quantitative analysis of GINM can be achieved with reasonably inexpensive equipment. Peer Reviewe...|$|R
