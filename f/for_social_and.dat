5|$|Concurrently, Bangui {{also became}} the key centre <b>for</b> <b>social</b> <b>and</b> {{cultural}} {{activity in the}} region, when new institutions were established in the city. However, political turmoil in the country, rampant corruption, and the dictatorial rule of President Bokassa centred in the city, brought in economic recession in the 1970s exacerbated by a fall in international prices for its major exports. This caused impoverishment {{of the people and}} severe conflict, further compounded by refugees migrating from troubled neighbouring countries.|$|E

5|$|Other {{factors may}} include Enlightenment {{thinking}} and {{the examples of}} the Atlantic Revolutions. The Enlightenment spurred the desire <b>for</b> <b>social</b> <b>and</b> economic reform to spread throughout Spanish America and the Iberian Peninsula. Ideas about free trade and physiocratic economics were raised by the Enlightenment in Spain and spread to the overseas empire and a homegrown Spanish American Enlightenment. The political reforms implemented and the many constitutions written both in Spain and throughout the Spanish world during the wars of independence were influenced by these factors.|$|E

Its members were later {{active in the}} struggle for citizenship, voters' registration campaign and other philanthropic activities. After Singapore's independence in 1965, it became a focal point where local Chinese businessmen socialised and forged ties, and it continued to play an active role in community services such as charity work and giving public talks. Among its 200-odd members today are luminaries of the Chinese business community such as the founder of the Overseas Union Bank, Lien Ying Chow, and United Overseas Bank chairman Wee Cho Yaw. It is still an all men's club– the youngest members are mainly in their 50s and membership is by invitation only.|$|E

5|$|Construction on the Baths of Caracalla {{began in}} 211 {{at the start}} of Caracalla's rule. The baths are named for Caracalla, though it is most {{probable}} that his father was responsible for their planning. In 216 a partial inauguration of the baths took place, but the outer perimeter of the baths was not completed until the reign of Severus Alexander. These large baths were typical of the Roman practice of building complexes <b>for</b> <b>social</b> <b>and</b> state activities in large densely populated cities. The baths covered around 50 acres (or 202,000 square meters) of land and could accommodate around 1,600 bathers at any one time. They were the second largest public baths built in ancient Rome and were complete with swimming pools, exercise yards, a stadium, steam rooms, libraries, meeting rooms, fountains, and other amenities, all of which were enclosed within formal gardens. The interior spaces were decorated with colourful marble floors, columns, mosaics, and colossal statuary.|$|E

5|$|Initially {{the camps}} housed {{political}} opponents; over time, undesirable members of German society—criminals, vagrants, deviants—were {{placed in the}} camps as well. A Hitler decree issued in December 1937 allowed for the incarceration of anyone deemed by the regime to be an undesirable member of society. This included Jews, Gypsies, communists, and those persons of any other cultural, racial, political, or religious affiliation deemed by the Nazis to be Untermensch (sub-human). Thus, the camps became a mechanism <b>for</b> <b>social</b> <b>and</b> racial engineering. By the outbreak of World War II in autumn 1939, there were six camps housing some 27,000 inmates. Death tolls were high.|$|E
5|$|Set in {{the grounds}} of Cobdown Park, the Cobdown Sports and Social Club evolved from the former social club for Reeds International, the paper-maker. A new clubhouse was built in 1985 for Reed International Sports and Social Club and in 1989 the club became the Cobdown Sports & Social Club when it {{was taken over by}} the club members. Although it {{remained}} a members club, with many of the same activities, the club was opened up to the general public and new activities were added. Sports form an important part of these activities, and the club is an important local centre {{with a wide range of}} facilities to cater for groups and organisations, such as schools and businesses. Membership is also open to sports teams that wish to use the club. Facilities include a bar, with snooker and pool tables, a darts board, and a big screen for major sporting events. There is a dedicated function room that is used <b>for</b> <b>social</b> <b>and</b> business events and can accommodate a maximum of 100 people seated.|$|E
5|$|Rajoelina {{took power}} in an {{atmosphere}} of national tension and international pressure to re-establish constitutional authority. The new head of state announced on 17 March that a new constitution would be presented for voter approval and general elections would be held within 24 months. Immediately after taking office, Rajoelina began naming opposition leaders to positions within the HAT. He dissolved the Senate and Parliament and transferred their powers to his cabinet, the officials of the HAT, and the newly established Council <b>for</b> <b>social</b> <b>and</b> economic strengthening, through which his policies were issued as decrees. Legislative authority rested in practice with Rajoelina and his cabinet, composed of his closest advisers. A military committee established in April increased HAT control over security and defense policy. The following month, after the suspension of the country's 22 regional governors, Rajoelina strengthened his influence over local government by naming replacements despite the fact that regional governorships were normally elected positions. The National Inquiry Commission (CNME) was established shortly thereafter; although its official purpose was to strengthen HAT effectiveness in addressing judicial and legal matters, the new entity carried out investigations and arrests of TIM supporters and other opponents of the TGV party. In addition, the new administration launched a strong crackdown on demonstrations by the new opposition, composed largely of Ravalomanana supporters; at two demonstrations in April 2009 security forces opened fire on unarmed civilians protesting the HAT's closure of three media networks formerly controlled by Ravalomanana, killing four and wounding sixty. Political analysts have criticized Rajoelina for using his position primarily to consolidate power and protect his political position and business interests and those of his supporters, observing that his initially broad range of supporters within the opposition movement has significantly diminished over time.|$|E
