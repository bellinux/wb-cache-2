Of 21 chicks that hatched between 1981 and 1994, nine were either killed by rats or died and were subsequently eaten by rats. Nest protection has been intensified since 1995 by using traps and poison stations as soon as a nest had been detected. A small video camera and infra-red light source watch the nest continuously, and will scare approaching rats with flashing lights and loud popping sounds. To increase the success rate of nesting, a nest watcher places a small thermostatically controlled <b>electric</b> <b>blanket</b> over the eggs or chicks, whenever the female leaves the nest for food. The survival rate of chicks has increased from 29% in unprotected nests to 75% in protected ones.|$|E
25|$|An <b>electric</b> <b>blanket</b> is {{a blanket}} with an {{integrated}} electrical heating device usually placed above the top bed sheet. The first <b>electric</b> <b>blanket</b> {{was invented in}} 1912 by American physician Sidney I. Russell. This earliest form of an <b>electric</b> <b>blanket</b> was an 'underblanket' under the bed that covered and heated from below. In 1937, Electric 'overblankets which lie {{on top of the}} sleeping person were introduced in the United States.|$|E
25|$|AWRE's {{trickery}} {{with the}} steel balls had other unintended outcomes. Even an event as inconsequential as early morning frost was an issue. Violet Club could be loaded into a bomber {{for up to}} thirty days on standby while parked overnight on a remote base where the bomb could get very cold. If the steel balls froze together inside the bomb cavity {{and could not be}} removed, the bomb was useless. AWRE's solution was to fit the bomb with an <b>electric</b> <b>blanket.</b> Because the bombs were armed before flight, the take-off was hazardous; the bombs could not be jettisoned, and landing with an armed bomb on return to base was too hazardous to contemplate. As a consequence, Violet Club could not be used on an airborne alert, or even flown to a remote dispersal base.|$|E

He soon finds out that cows have found an old {{typewriter}} in the barn, and are using it to type notes requesting things from Farmer Brown such as <b>electric</b> <b>blankets</b> to keep them warm at night. Farmer Brown refuses, so the cows, {{who are willing to}} withhold their milk until they get what they ask for, go on strike. Soon, the hens type a similar note asking for <b>electric</b> <b>blankets</b> as well, and after Farmer Brown furiously refuses to provide them, the hens go on strike as well and refuse to lay eggs.Farmer Brown realizes this makes it impossible to run a farm. In a furious attempt to re-establish normalcy, he uses another typewriter to send a note back to the cows, declaring they do not need the things they are asking for and that their job is to produce milk and eggs so he can run his farm. The cows hold an emergency meeting, {{at the end of which}} they seemingly come to a resolution. They promise the farmer that if he gives them <b>electric</b> <b>blankets,</b> they will give up their typewriter. A duck who acts as a neutral party agrees to deliver the typewriter when the cows have received the electric blankets.Farmer Brown decides the deal is fair, so he leaves <b>electric</b> <b>blankets</b> for the cows and waits for the duck to deliver the typewriter. Instead, the ducks send him a note which states that their pond is boring and they would like a diving board, at which point the story ends.|$|R

50|$|Much like heating pads, <b>electric</b> <b>blankets</b> use an {{insulated}} wire or heating element inserted into a fabric that heats {{when it is}} plugged in.
