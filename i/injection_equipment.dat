25|$|Intravenous {{drug use}} {{represents}} {{the largest single}} cause of HIV transmission in China, accounting for 44.3% of infections {{at the end of}} 2005. Ministry of Public Security data suggests that the number of registered drug users has risen steadily {{at a rate of about}} 122% per year, from 70,000 in 1990 to 1.16 million in 2005. The total number, including unregistered drug users, is thought to be much higher, with one estimate placing the figure at 3.5 million; the UNODC World Drug Report estimated that in 2003, 0.2% of 16- to 64-year-olds (i.e., 1.7 million people) were opiate abusers. The most commonly used drug is heroin, which accounts for 85% of total reported drug use, although amphetamines are becoming more common, especially in urban areas. Many drug users begin heroin use by smoking, but later find it more cost effective to inject because of the stronger effect gained from injecting a smaller amount.

25|$|Throughout the 1950s {{there was}} an {{increasing}} demand for a diesel-engined Land Rover. Diesel technology had improved, making small-capacity high-speed engines practical. Diesel power had also become prominent in industrial and agricultural uses throughout the world, and fleet users of Land Rovers were often in the situation where their Land Rovers were the only petrol-engined vehicles in their fleet, making spares, servicing and fuel supply more complex. The Rover Motor Company was in talks with Standard-Triumph in 1954, {{with the possibility of}} a merger. Standard were Britain's pioneers of road-going small diesel engines with the 20C engine fitted to Ferguson tractors and the Standard Vanguard car (Britain's first diesel car). Rover engineers were able to study Standard's diesel designs as part of these. The merger was called off, but Rover had gained vital experience and knowledge in developing small diesel engines. The result was a wet-liner 4-cylinder engine. Fuel <b>injection</b> <b>equipment</b> was from CAV, and the engine used Ricardo's Comet swirl chambers, but with Rover-developed dimples to produce quieter and smoother running. Heater plugs were fitted to each combustion chamber to improve starting. The engine was launched in the Land Rover in 1957. The vehicle had to have an extra 2inches let into the chassis in the engine bay to enable the new engine to fit. The engine's power output and speed range was close enough to the existing petrol engine to allow the same transmission unit to be used on all vehicles.|$|E

The DB could also be run on higher octane C3 fuel but use of MW 50 was forbidden. The DC ran on C3 fuel and could generate a potential 2,000PS when using C3 fuel with MW 50 and a boost of 1.98 ata, otherwise the power ratings were {{similar to that of}} the DB.

40|$|AbstractTransport of CO 2 {{is a key}} {{component}} in the CCS chain for commercial projects, and CO 2 shipping is being reconsidered {{as an alternative to}} pipeline transport even when the distance across the sea is not so quite long. The ship-based transport will make it possible to couple CO 2 recovery plant and storage site without being limited to a single sink-source match, and decoupling and moving to another sink can be done with relative ease when necessary. It also removes the pipeline construction and removal activities in coastal zone where the social activities like fishery are often high. In this paper, the technical and economic feasibility of shuttle-type shipping and offshore operation for CO 2 injection from the ship to the well(s) are studied.

40|$|AIM: Although a safe {{injection}} {{does not}} harm to patient, unsafe injection practices may leads some health problems. The most affected category {{of health care}} providers are the nursing personnel. METHOD: This hospital based cross sectional observational study was conducted among 80 nurses involved in patient care to assess their knowledge regarding safe injection practices and to assess certain aspects of their practice while administering injection and disposal of the disposables. RESULTS: About 52. 5 % subjects were protected by hepatitis B vaccination. During the last 6 months, 6. 3 % nurses got accidental needle stick injury three or more times. About 12. 5 % study subjects washed their hands {{with soap and water}} before administering injection. About 60 % of the nursing personnel maintained correct procedure during giving injection; while sterile gloves were used only by 3. 7 % nurses. During disposal of used needles, in 57. 5 % cases hub cutters were used, while needles were recapped in 42. 5 % of cases. Used syringes were disposed off correctly in 41. 2 % of cases.

40|$|Background: Injection {{drug use}} {{has been the}} major cause of HIV/AIDS in China {{in the past two}} decades. We {{measured}} the prevalences of HIV and hepatitis C virus (HCV) prevalence and their associated risk factors among current injection drug users (IDUs) in Ruili city, a border region connecting China with Myanmar that has been undergoing serious drug use and HIV spread problems. An estimate of the number of current IDUs is also presented. Methods: In 2012, Chinese IDUs who had injected within the past six months and aged $ 18 years were recruited using a respondent-driven sampling (RDS) technique. Participants underwent interviews and serological testing for HIV, HBV, HCV and syphilis. Logistic regression indentified factors associated with HIV and HCV infections. Multiplier method was used to obtain an estimate {{of the size of the}} current IDU population via combining available service data and findings from our survey. Results: Among 370 IDUs recruited, the prevalence of HIV and HCV was 18. 3 % and 41. 5 %, respectively. 27. 1 % of participants had shared a needle/syringe in their lifetime. Consistent condom use rates were low among both regular (6. 8 %) and non-regular (30. 4 %) partners. Factors independently associated with being HIV positive included HCV infection, having a longer history of injection drug use and experience of needle/syringe sharing.
