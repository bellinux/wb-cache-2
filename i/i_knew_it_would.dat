25|$|A {{collaboration}} {{is like a}} good conversation, Nicola came to my studio {{a couple of times}} and I went to hers; we initially chatted about her music, the forthcoming album and how this related to her vision for the shoes. I went away and started designing my response to this. After our first meeting I was excited by her ideas and collaborating with people who have a strong vision is really fantastic. Nicola considers everything she does really carefully and has a totally clear view of what she wants to achieve. While the shoes are just a small part of this, <b>I</b> <b>knew</b> <b>it</b> <b>would</b> be interesting and fun to work together.|$|E
500|$|Moynahan {{moved to}} New York at age 18 and, a year later, began {{appearing}} in magazines such as Vogue and Elle, and on covers of other widely-known magazines. Her cover highlights include Vogue Paris (May 1993), Elle (October 1993), and Glamour (six times). In an interview given in July 2004, Moynahan, discussing her early work, said: [...] "It was a crazy world that {{paid a lot}} of money. I liked being a model, but <b>I</b> <b>knew</b> <b>it</b> <b>would</b> never last, so I looked into acting." ...|$|E
500|$|Early on, I {{realized}} {{that what this}} particular crew needed from me was not pressure but the light touch. [...] Once informed of our objective, their enthusiasm infected everything they did, and here and there might easily have caused stress-related dysfunction. [...] Extended separation from home and family with no means of communications {{was not a problem}} — submariners are used to that — but bearing down too much on the job might be. [...] My concern was about our performance in an emergency, being at the same time unable to predict what emergencies might be in store for us. [...] It was important, I thought, to hold back on the pressure until a really tough problem came up. [...] This happened several times, as <b>I</b> <b>knew</b> <b>it</b> <b>would,</b> and I was glad I had something in reserve.|$|E
6000|$|... 'Yes, <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>it</b> <b>would</b> grieve {{him most}} dreadfully, {{if it came}} to an end now, dear fellow. <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>it</b> <b>would</b> break my heart, too, but never mind that, I would go away, out of his reach, and he might get over <b>it.</b> <b>Would</b> <b>it</b> not be better than his being always ashamed of an inferior, incompetent creature, always {{dragging}} after him?' ...|$|R

500|$|When {{casting the}} two leading {{actors in the}} film, Bertino sought Liv Tyler {{for the role of}} Kristen. Tyler, who had not worked for several years after the birth of her son, {{accepted}} the part after being impressed by the script: [...] "I especially liked Bryan's way of saying a lot, but not saying everything. Often in movies, it's all spelled out for you, and the dialogue is very explanatory. But Bryan doesn't write like that; he writes how normal people communicate—with questions lingering. <b>I</b> <b>knew</b> <b>it</b> <b>would</b> be interesting to act that." [...] Canadian actor Scott Speedman was cast as James. Speedman was also impressed by the script, stating that [...] "the audience actually gets time to breathe with the characters before things get scary as hell. That got me interested from the first pages".|$|E
500|$|The {{hospital}} corpsman and sniper of a four-man reconnaissance {{and surveillance}} team, SEAL Team 10. Wahlberg {{was the first}} actor to sign on as a star of the film during its early stages of development. He agreed to portray Luttrell after reading Peter Berg's script. Wahlberg chose not to read Luttrell's book Lone Survivor during production to avoid arguments with Berg over events and details that were {{left out in the}} book. [...] "The problem when adapting a piece of material like that is that you always feel like something is missing", he explained. [...] "I wanted to come at it from this perspective." [...] Of Wahlberg's portrayal, Luttrell stated, [...] "Wahlberg is a consummate professional, and he's a great actor. It was a little strange watching somebody trying to play me, but we talked about it and <b>I</b> <b>knew</b> <b>it</b> <b>would</b> turn out great. I was more worried about the other guys because they’re not around to speak for themselves." [...] Wahlberg has since cited Lone Survivor as his favorite film role as an actor and producer: [...] "This is the best working experience I’ve ever had, under the toughest conditions. I remember early on as an actor, you worked a long, hard day, but you did something you felt was special, and that car ride home you couldn’t stop thinking about it. I had that feeling every day on this movie." ...|$|E
500|$|As {{her story}} {{progresses}} following her constant manipulative behavior, Chloe reveals her true identity: Kate Valentine, {{the daughter of}} the Chancellor maid Esther Valentine (Kate Linder). The storyline was dubbed [...] "Chloe is Kate". Hendrickson was pleased that the writers decided to give Chloe a backstory, saying, [...] "I was so excited when I found out Chloe was going to have some family ties. <b>I</b> <b>knew</b> <b>it</b> <b>would</b> give me, as an actor, a chance to finally explain to viewers why Chloe is the way she is." [...] The actress felt that her family reveal proved that she's not [...] "this bitch who likes to destroy people's lives", attesting her behavior to not being raised by parents; [...] "She never had anyone tell her wrong from right," [...] Hendrickson stated. Her backstory revealed that Chloe hadn't seen her mother or her employer Katherine Chancellor (Jeanne Cooper) and Jill Abbott (Jess Walton) since she [...] "was young and overweight with braces". Kate Linder was also pleased with the writing direction, describing it as an [...] "honor" [...] to work with Hendrickson. She said, [...] "When they decided to bring [...] back, I was stunned and pleasantly surprised. Maria Bell called me and {{told me that it was}} top secret. It was a great reveal." [...] Chloe initially gives Esther the cold shoulder. Of her reasoning behind this, Hendrickson said, [...] "Chloe is very young and immature — as well, hurt and ashamed about her upbringing. She’s not going to let her mother forget it easily." [...] She described their initial relationship as [...] "realistic" [...] and similar to [...] "a lot of mother-and-daughter relationships".|$|E

40|$|Recently I set {{myself the}} task of {{learning}} the French language. <b>I</b> <b>knew</b> the undertaking would be fraught with frustration. <b>I</b> did not <b>know</b> <b>it</b> <b>would</b> provide me with insights into the demands made upon the child who is learning to read and write. Neither did <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>it</b> <b>would</b> so soundly reaffirm my belief in the whole language approach to literacy instruction...|$|R

2500|$|According to an {{interview}} with the co-creators in SFX magazine, Shyamalan came across Avatar when his daughter wanted to be [...] for Halloween. Intrigued, Shyamalan researched and watched the series with his family. [...] "Watching Avatar has become a family event in my house ... so we are looking forward to how the story develops in season three," [...] said Shyamalan. [...] "Once I saw the amazing world that Mike and Bryan created, <b>I</b> <b>knew</b> <b>it</b> <b>would</b> make a great feature film." [...] He added he was attracted to the spiritual and martial arts influences on the show.|$|E
2500|$|After {{a series}} of {{appearances}} in low-budget films and guest roles on TV series in the mid and late 1990s, he gained media attention {{once again in the}} 1999 Emmy-nominated TNT original movie Pirates of Silicon Valley, co-starring Noah Wyle as Apple Computer's Steve Jobs. Hall was widely praised for his portrayal of Microsoft billionaire Bill Gates. [...] "I really fought for this part because <b>I</b> <b>knew</b> <b>it</b> <b>would</b> be the role of a lifetime," [...] Hall said. [...] "It was a thrill and a daunting challenge to play someone of his stature and brilliance." [...] Hall described his physical appearance as 20-year-old Gates to the San Francisco Chronicle: ...|$|E
2500|$|On May 23, 1959 Shunryu Suzuki {{arrived in}} San Francisco {{to attend to}} Soko-ji, {{at that time the}} sole Soto Zen temple in San Francisco. He was 55. Suzuki took over for the interim priest, Wako Kazumitsu Kato. Suzuki was taken aback by the Americanized and watered-down Buddhism practiced at the temple, mostly by older {{immigrant}} Japanese. He found American culture interesting and not too difficult to adjust to, even commenting once that [...] "if <b>I</b> <b>knew</b> <b>it</b> <b>would</b> be like this, I would have come here sooner!" [...] He was surprised to see that Sokoji was previously a Jewish synagogue (at 1881 Bush Street, now a historic landmark). His sleeping quarters were located upstairs, a windowless room with an adjoining office.|$|E

2500|$|During {{his early}} career, Ó Domhnaill played a dark journeyman's Guild {{dreadnought}} guitar {{on stage and}} on recordings. In 1977, he commissioned a custom-made guitar from luthier Kenny White who was based out of Portland, Oregon. During the 1990s, he played a 1975 Martin D-28, which he used on his later recordings and stage appearances. In a 1996 interview, Ó Domhnaill observed, [...] "It's gotten louder, fuller, clearer, and more bell-like. It wasn't a great instrument when I bought it, {{but it was a}} Martin, and <b>I</b> <b>knew</b> <b>it</b> <b>would</b> improve if I played it. I have, and it's worked." [...] Ó Domhnaill also owned a custom-made guitar by another Portland luthier Terry Demezas. He preferred medium-gauge phosphor-bronze strings, and used a large triangular Fender medium flatpick when not fingerpicking. For much of his career, he performed with a small quiver of tin whistles and a pedal harmonium.|$|E
2500|$|Anger {{has always}} been an [...] "extremely private individual," [...] {{although}} he has given various interviews over the years, with one interviewer, David Wingrove, describing him in 2008 as [...] "a joy. Gentle, soft-spoken, immaculately tanned, he looks a good two decades younger than his 78 years". In such interviews, he refuses to disclose information on his name change from Anglemeyer to Anger, telling an interviewer who brought the topic up in 2004 that [...] "You're being impertinent. It says Anger on my passport, that's all you need to know. I would stay away from that subject if I were you." [...] In a 2010 interview, however, he stated that [...] "I just condensed my name. <b>I</b> <b>knew</b> <b>it</b> <b>would</b> be like a label, a logo. It's easy to remember." [...] Anger is openly gay, with one of his friends describing how he [...] "was attracted to people who were either well endowed or the Arnold Schwarzenegger type." [...] He once joked that he was [...] "somewhat {{to the right of the}} KKK" [...] in his views about black people, opening him up to criticism for racism. He is a passionate supporter of the Tibetan independence movement.|$|E
2500|$|In June 2014, Derby {{rejected}} {{an offer}} from Burnley for Bryson. Bryson was however given permission to speak to Burnley, later saying that [...] "it doesn't matter what team it is, when someone puts an offer in for you I think you owe them the respect {{to sit down and}} speak to them... but just because I did that didn't mean I was going to sign for them." [...] Soon afterwards, he agreed a new five-year contract with Derby, saying that his bond with the fans was {{part of the reason that}} he chose to stay: [...] "I've got a good bond with the fans as well and that was a big part in my decision to stay here. The fans have been excellent ever since I walked through the door. When you come to a new club it can take time to win over the fans, but they have been fantastic with me... they helped me make the biggest decision of my career, if not my life. I took a while to think about it and <b>I</b> <b>knew</b> <b>it</b> <b>would</b> be a massive decision. I went through stages where one minute I thought I was leaving and then the next minute I think I'm staying. But in the end it turned out to be an easy decision for me because Derby are such a great club to be part of." ...|$|E

2500|$|Costumes for Broadchurch were {{designed}} by freelance costume designer Ray Holman. Holman worked with the actors portraying major characters {{to ensure that the}} costumes fit the character. He spent hours discussing the characters with the actors, and sometimes took the actors shopping or to costume suppliers to find the right look. Holman crafted the [...] "old and saggy" [...] look of Alec Hardy's character to reflect the fact that Hardy [...] "didn't really care what he wore." [...] Often arriving on the set at 6 a.m., Holman ensured that Tennant's suit was appropriately crumpled every day. Holman also designed Ellie Miller's [...] "unflattering grey work suit". Holman and actress Olivia Colman agreed that Ellie was a person who'd lived in a small town her entire life. Having been a uniformed police officer, she'd worked her way up in the ranks but still retained an unconscious desire to appear in uniform. The grey trouser suit was critical to that look. [...] "I did apologise to her about that, but it looked fantastic and characterised her," [...] Holman said. Beth Lattimer's red dress, seen in episode one, was also Holman's idea. There was disagreement about it, but Holman said he insisted on the red dress. [...] "I wanted the red dress because <b>I</b> <b>knew</b> <b>it</b> <b>would</b> move quite beautifully and she has to run on the beach and I wanted the red against the cliffs," [...] he said.|$|E
2500|$|Coonan's casting as Carl was {{announced}} on 6 May 2013, {{when it was}} revealed that the character is Kirsty Branning's (Kierston Wareing) ex-boyfriend and has been in prison, where he had shared a cell with Derek Branning (Jamie Foreman). Coonan said of his casting, [...] "EastEnders {{has been a part of}} my life since I was 12 years old. I even remember talking about the storylines in school playgrounds in Tottenham and I am very happy and proud to now be a small part of its life." [...] Executive producer Lorraine Newman said: [...] "It's wonderful to have Daniel Coonan joining us in Walford to play Carl White. Oozing confidence and with a dangerous edge, will Kirsty be able to resist his bad boy charms for long, or can [...] Max [...] save her from the lure of the dark side?" [...] This is Coonan's second role in EastEnders, as he played David Priors in 2011. Coonan said the four-episode role helped him prepare for a bigger role in the programme, though describing his first day on set as Carl, he said, [...] "it still hits you when you walk on to the Square for the very first time. It's like walking into your TV." [...] Coonan filmed his first scene on the Bridge Street market set. Heat reported that Carl's introduction was part of a [...] "rescue plan" [...] to increase ratings for EastEnders, especially with the announced departures of popular characters Tanya Branning (Jo Joyner), Jack Branning (Scott Maslen) and Michael Moon (Steve John Shepherd), saying [...] "with ever-dwindling ratings and an unusually bare trophy cabinet, producers have been forced to plan some major shake-ups in an attempt to revive the ailing drama with new characters, returning familiar faces and exciting storylines." [...] Coonan later said of being cast, [...] "When they offered the part of Carl to me, I thought about it as long as it takes to blink your eyelids. <b>I</b> <b>knew</b> <b>it</b> <b>would</b> be a great character and fun to play. Something like this can massively raise your profile. I'm beaming into thousands of people's homes four times a week." [...] Coonan was originally contracted to appear in 28 episodes over a six-month period, but instead filmed over 60 episodes. After Danny Dyer was cast as Mick Carter in the show, he revealed that he was approached to play Carl.|$|E
