5|$|It is {{possible}} that the Byzantine flavour to these images was also connected with contemporary attempts through diplomacy to achieve reconciliation with the Greek Orthodox Church, in which van Eyck's patron Philip the Good took a <b>keen</b> <b>interest.</b> Van Eyck's Portrait of Cardinal Niccolò Albergati (c. 1431) depicts one of the papal diplomats most involved with these efforts.|$|E

In an attempt to obtain them, he met with Fermi, von Halban and George Placzek in New York in April 1942. He was unable to secure the supplies he wanted, but Fermi showed an unexpected <b>keen</b> <b>interest</b> in the Wells Surveys work.|$|E

5|$|As a child, Keenor had a <b>keen</b> <b>interest</b> in football, using {{tennis balls}} or rags tied {{together}} to form a ball, due to the expensive nature of footballs at the time, to play the game in his local streets.

One of his former teachers at the school, Walter Riden, would later go on to join the board at Cardiff City while Keenor was a player.|$|E

In his early teens, he became an avid amateur mechanic, fixing the family motor car and learning to drive. Marmaduke was never a hard worker and did not embark upon an academic career, but was considered to possess above average intelligence. In 1929, he passed the Junior Certificate Exam with first class honours. The certificate qualified him for Victoria Boy's High School from which he graduated in 1931.|$|E
5|$|Born into a well-read {{and educated}} family, Hambro {{developed}} {{a penchant for}} French literature, marking an incongruity to the literary taste of his parents—they had been readers of English literature in the Anglo-American tradition. Making his debut in 1960 with the satirical novel De frafalnes klubb, Hambro published trilogies and other novels {{for the next two}} decades. He had a <b>keen</b> <b>interest</b> in linguistics; in the 1969 book Ting, tanke, tale he problematized linguistic questions in a popular scientific way. A translator of French literature, he chaired the Norwegian Association of Literary Translators in the early 1960s.|$|E

5|$|Ehlers' {{research}} {{focused on}} the foundations of general relativity {{as well as on}} the theory's applications to astrophysics. He formulated a suitable classification of exact solutions to Einstein's field equations and proved the Ehlers–Geren–Sachs theorem that justifies the application of simple, general-relativistic model universes to modern cosmology. He created a spacetime-oriented description of gravitational lensing and clarified the relationship between models formulated within the framework of general relativity and those of Newtonian gravity. In addition, Ehlers had a <b>keen</b> <b>interest</b> in both the history and philosophy of physics and was an ardent populariser of science.|$|E
5|$|In April 1878, L'Estrange reappeared on the Australian {{scene with}} a new {{performance}} – gas ballooning. The first balloon ascent in Australia {{had been made in}} Melbourne in 1853, with Sydney following five years later in December 1858. The idea that people could be lifted from the ground to fly and return safely fired the imagination of the public, and the novelty of balloon ascents continued to draw large crowds through the 1860s and 1870s. No doubt the very real chance of disaster and injury added to the crowd's <b>keen</b> <b>interest,</b> as mishaps were not uncommon.|$|E
5|$|In {{central and}} eastern Europe, the state played {{a greater role in}} organising these pilgrimages. The National Orthodox Romanian Women's Society, {{supported}} by the church and the state, played an important part in enabling regular pilgrimages to important Romanian sites up until 1939. In Germany and Italy, the Fascist governments took a <b>keen</b> <b>interest</b> in organising such journeys. In Italy, these involved large, state-influenced organisations, and the government steadily discouraged private visits or unofficial groups from taking part in alternative ceremonies at these sites. In Nazi Germany, pilgrimages were organised to the new war memorials sponsored by the government in the 1930s.|$|E
