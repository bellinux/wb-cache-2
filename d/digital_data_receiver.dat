40|$|In this paper, we {{analyzed}} and measured the electrical crosstalk {{characteristics of a}} 1. 25 Gbps triplexer module for Ethernet passive optical networks to realize fiber-to-the-home services. Electrical crosstalk characteristic of the 1. 25 Gbps optical triplexer module on a resistive silicon substrate should be more serious than on a dielectric substrate. Consequently, using the finite element method, we analyze the electrical crosstalk phenomena and propose a silicon substrate structure with a dummy ground line that is the simplest low-crosstalk layout configuration in the 1. 25 Gbps optical triplexer module. The triplexer module consists of a laser diode as a transmitter, a digital photodetector as a <b>digital</b> <b>data</b> <b>receiver,</b> and an analog photodetector as a cable television signal receiver. According to IEEE 802. 3 ah and ITU-T G. 983. 3, the digital receiver and analog receiver sensitivities have to meet- 24 dBm at BER= 10 - 12 and- 7. 7 dBm at 44 dB SNR. The electrical crosstalk levels have to maintain less than- 86 dB from DC to 3 GHz. From analysis and measurement results, the proposed silicon substrate structure that contains the dummy line with 100 µm space from the signal lines and 4 mm separations among the devices satisfies the electrical crosstalk level compared to a simple structure. This proposed structure can be easily implemented with design convenience and greatly reduce the silicon substrate size by about 50 %...|$|E
40|$|Data {{compression}} is {{of interest}} in business data processing, both {{because of the cost}} savings it offers and because of the large volume of data manipulated in many business applications. A method and system for transmitting a digital image (i. e., an array of pixels) from a digital data source to a <b>digital</b> <b>data</b> <b>receiver.</b> More the size of the data be smaller, it provides better transmission speed and saves time. In this communication we always want to transmit data efficiently and noise free. Both the LZW and Huffman data compression methods are lossless in manner. These methods or some versions of them are very common in use of compressing different types of data. Even though on average Huffman gives better compression results, it determines the case in which the LZW performs best and when the compression efficiency gap between the LZW algorithm and its Huffman counterpart is the largest. In the case of Hybrid compression it gives better compression ratio than in single compression. So, at first I wanted to compress original data by Huffman Encoding Technique then by the LZW Encoding Technique. But it did not give better compression ratio than in single LZW compression. At that time I have found that if we compress the data by Huffman first and then by LZW all the cases it gives better compression ratio. Then it named as “Data compression using Huffman based LZW Encoding”. Its compression ratio most of the cases above 2. 55 and in some cases it becomes above 3. 25 or more. It will provide cheap, reliable and efficient system for data compression in digital communication system...|$|E

40|$|A Radio Frequency (RF) based <b>digital</b> <b>data</b> {{transmission}} scheme with 8 channel encoder/decoder ICs {{is proposed}} for surface electrode switching of a 16 -electrode wireless Electrical Impedance Tomography (EIT) system. A RF based wireless <b>digital</b> <b>data</b> transmission module (WDDTM) is developed and the electrode switching of a EIT system is studied {{by analyzing the}} boundary data collected and the resistivity images of practical phantoms. An analog multiplexers based electrode switching module (ESM) is developed with analog multiplexers and switched with parallel <b>digital</b> <b>data</b> transmitted by a wireless transmitter/receiver (T-x/R-x) module working with radio frequency technology. Parallel digital bits are generated using NI USB 6251 card working in LabVIEW platform and sent to transmission module to transmit the <b>digital</b> <b>data</b> to the <b>receiver</b> end. The transmitter/receiver module developed is properly interfaced with the personal computer (PC) and practical phantoms through the ESM and USB based DAQ system respectively. It is observed that the digital bits required for multiplexer operation are sequentially generated by the digital output (D/O) ports of the DAQ card. Parallel to serial and serial to parallel conversion of <b>digital</b> <b>data</b> are suitably done by encoder and decoder ICs. Wireless <b>digital</b> <b>data</b> transmission module successfully transmitted and received the parallel data required for switching the current and voltage electrodes wirelessly. 1 mA, 50 kHz sinusoidal constant current is injected at the phantom boundary using common ground current injection protocol and the boundary potentials developed at the voltage electrodes are measured. Resistivity images of the practical phantoms are reconstructed from boundary data using EIDORS. Boundary data and the resistivity images reconstructed from the surface potentials are studied to assess the wireless <b>digital</b> <b>data</b> transmission system. Boundary data profiles of the practical phantom with different configurations show that the multiplexers are operating in the required sequence for common ground current injection protocol. The voltage peaks obtained at the proper positions in the boundary data profiles proved the sequential operation of multiplexers and successful wireless transmission of digital bits. Reconstructed images and their image parameters proved that the boundary data are successfully acquired by the DAQ system which in turn again indicates a sequential and proper operation of multiplexers {{as well as the}} successful wireless transmission of digital bits. Hence the developed RF based wireless <b>digital</b> <b>data</b> transmission module (WDDTM) is found suitable for transmitting digital bits required for electrode switching in wireless EIT data acquisition system.

Therefore, from a dynamic capability perspective, this paper examines whether companies' ability to leverage <b>digital</b> <b>data,</b> which we call their <b>Digital</b> <b>Data</b> dynamic capability, leads to better financial performance, and whether there are moderating effects on this relationship. In order to achieve these goals, the following research questions are addressed: 1) To what extent do firms that develop <b>Digital</b> <b>Data</b> dynamic capabilities achieve better financial performance? 2) To what extent do organisational and industry-related environmental conditions moderate the relationship between a firm's <b>Digital</b> <b>Data</b> dynamic capability and financial performance?
