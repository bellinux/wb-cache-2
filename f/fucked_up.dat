5|$|The production’s incredible. The beat {{is just so}} {{constant}} and powerful. That was the first song that I wrote with Dimitri and Maya. I felt like I’d found my sound. And I was kind {{of looking at it}} like an outfit. So it was, ‘if this was an outfit, what would this song need now?’ So we had the pretty dress, which was the chorus. We had the lovely shoes, which was the verse. ‘But what do we need to really set this song off? A big, fancy, bow in the hair would really set this song off.’ So when I got to the middle eight I wanted to go really erratic, almost like taTu on All The Things She Said. I wanted it to be proper <b>fucked</b> <b>up</b> and crazy – hands in the air.|$|E
5|$|Culver first {{appeared}} as Casey Donovan in Boys in the Sand, directed by Wakefield Poole, in 1971. The film {{was an instant}} success and {{is considered one of}} the great classics of male erotic cinema. With the success and celebrity he garnered from the film, Donovan believed that he would be able to cross over into mainstream film. While there were meetings with directors like John Schlesinger and Raymond St. Jacques and talk of casting him in mainstream projects including adaptations of novels by Mary Renault and Patricia Nell Warren, the only film opportunities opened for him were as the star of more erotic films. These included the bisexual porn film Score, The Back Row with George Payne, L. A. Tool & Die with Bob Blount and Richard Locke, The Other Side of Aspen with Al Parker and Dick Fisk, Boys in the Sand II and Inevitable Love, with Jon King and Jamie Wingo. Shortly before his death he starred, heavily intoxicated, in the fisting movie <b>Fucked</b> <b>Up,</b> for Christopher Rage. He also appeared in a number of heterosexual porn films, most notably The Opening of Misty Beethoven where he had a scene with Constance Money.|$|E

Gadget also assisted in vocal production for the album's three vocal tracks, [...] "Organism", [...] "It Gets Heavy" [...] and [...] "Getting It Together". In contrast to Guerrero's previous studio album A Little Bit of Somethin (2000), production for Soul Food Taqueria was more polished, despite Guerrero stating {{that he is}} [...] "still down with the <b>fucked</b> <b>up</b> 4 track action" [...] upon the album's release.

While Stan is cynical and profane, Parker still notes that there is an [...] "underlying sweetness" [...] to the character, and Time magazine described Stan and his friends as [...] "sometimes cruel but with a core of innocence". He is amused by bodily functions and toilet humor, and his favorite television personalities are Terrance and Phillip, a Canadian duo whose comedy routines on their show-within-the-show revolve substantially around fart jokes.|$|E

[...] "Just one last puff and two last regrets/Three spirits and 12 lonely steps", Gaga sings, before uttering the hook, [...] "I need you more than dope". The lyrics meant that the singer wanted her lost love more than an addict pines for drugs. [...] "Dope" [...] {{is one of the}} most personal songs of Gaga, according to Joe Lynch from Fuse. With lines like [...] "I promise this drink is my last one / I know I <b>fucked</b> <b>up</b> again / Because I lost my only friend", Lynch believed that Gaga was referring to her former assistant Jennifer O'Neil who had months ago moved to court against the singer for unpaid wages.|$|E
500|$|The {{video for}} [...] "Stupid Girl" [...] is a {{performance}} piece, {{inspired by the}} title sequence from David Fincher's 1995 movie Se7en. The clip was shot in just four hours entirely within a warehouse decorated with plexiglas sheets on which the song lyrics were written. Bayer cut the film into pieces, and soaked it in his bath, applying deliberate fingerprints and abrasions to the footage before putting it back together by hand. Vig would compliment the video for mirroring the band's sound: [...] "some of it looked beautiful, some of it looked distorted, and kinda <b>fucked</b> <b>up</b> - and it sorta described some of our music visually". Bayer later re-edited a second version of the video, with alternative footage from the original shoot for a remix version of [...] "Stupid Girl" [...] by Todd Terry.|$|E

[...] Furthermore, she deemed the video [...] "literal", confirming that the actors look [...] "just like [...] real family" [...] and that the set designer built the set from photos of the house she grew up in.

500|$|Due to {{the success}} of [...] "Give it Away", the band did not foresee [...] "Under the Bridge" [...] as being equally viable. Warner Bros. sent representatives to a Chili Peppers' concert in order to figure out what would {{ultimately}} be the next single. When Frusciante began playing [...] "Under the Bridge", Kiedis missed his cue; the entire audience began singing the song, instead. Kiedis was initially [...] "mortified that I had <b>fucked</b> <b>up</b> in front of Warner's people... I apologized for fucking up but they said 'Fucking up? Are you kidding me? When every single kid at the show sings a song, that's our next single.'" [...] "Under the Bridge" [...] was, therefore, selected as Blood Sugar Sex Magiks second single. By January 1992, [...] "Under the Bridge" [...] had exploded, peaking at number 2 on the Billboard Hot 100.|$|E
500|$|During {{press for}} the popular 2015 film Straight Outta Compton, {{questions}} about the portrayal and behavior of Dr. Dre and other prominent figures in the rap community about violence against women – and the question about its absence in the film – were raised. The discussion about the film led to Dr. Dre addressing his past behavior in the press. In August 2015, {{in an interview with}} Rolling Stone, Dre lamented his abusive past, saying, [...] "I made some fucking horrible mistakes in my life. I was young, fucking stupid. I would say all the allegations aren't true—some of them are. Those {{are some of the things}} that I would like to take back. It was really <b>fucked</b> <b>up.</b> But I paid for those mistakes, and there's no way in hell that I will ever make another mistake like that again." ...|$|E
500|$|During {{recording}} sessions, Higgs {{suffered from}} depression.

He was affected by frequent mood swings {{as a result of his}} medication; Pritchard said that these [...] "affected [...] pretty adversely". Drummer, Michael Spearman, explained to Q that Higgs's attempt to channel his depression into his writing worried the rest of the group. At one point during writing sessions, Higgs presented his bandmates with [...] "Pigdog", a song about [...] "how [...] a horrible person and [...] want to be one any more". Spearman objected to this style: [...] "For me that was a turning point. I was like, 'Let's make a record that’s energetic and <b>fucked</b> <b>up</b> and exciting.'" ...|$|E

500|$|The explicitness of the album's lyrics {{mandated}} a Parental Advisory logo in the United States, {{largely due}} to the lurid nature of the songs as well as their usage of profanity. Derogatory terms such as [...] "bitch", [...] "slut", and [...] "whore" [...] are used prominently in the songs. [...] "I try to place [...] next to <b>fucked</b> <b>up</b> imagery, because that's how I view things", said Love in a 1991 interview with Everett True. [...] "I sometimes feel that no one's taken the time to write about certain things in rock, that there's a certain female point of view that's never been given space." [...] In spite of its graphic lyrics, the underlying female themes in many of the songs led some journalists to tag the band as being part of the riot grrl movement, which Love was not directly associated with.|$|E
500|$|As Planet Terror took shape, Tarantino {{developed}} {{the story for}} Death Proof, based on his fascination for the way stuntmen would [...] "death-proof" [...] their cars. As {{long as they were}} driving, stuntmen could slam their cars headfirst into a brick wall at 60mph (97km/h) and survive. This inspired Tarantino to create a slasher film featuring a deranged stuntman who stalks and murders sexy young women with his [...] "death-proof" [...] car. Tarantino remembers, [...] "I realized I couldn't do a straight slasher film, because with the exception of women-in-prison films, there is no other genre quite as rigid. And if you break that up, you aren't really doing it anymore. It's inorganic, so I realized—let me take the structure of a slasher film and just do what I do. My version is going to be <b>fucked</b> <b>up</b> and disjointed, but it seemingly uses the structure of a slasher film, hopefully against you." ...|$|E
500|$|The paper {{maintains}} a strict profanity policy. A 2007 {{review of a}} concert by punk band <b>Fucked</b> <b>Up,</b> for example, completely avoided mention of the group's name.

Times politics editor Carolyn Ryan said: [...] "It's a rare thing for us to use this language in our stories, even in quotes, and we discussed it at length," [...] ultimately deciding to publish it because of its news value and because [...] "o leave it out or simply describe it seemed awkward and less than forthright to us, especially given {{that we would be}} running a video that showed our readers exactly what was said." ...|$|E
