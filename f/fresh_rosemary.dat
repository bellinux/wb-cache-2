40|$|ABSTRACT Although its {{importance}} as vegetable, {{a considerable amount}} of onion bulbs is lost in storage. That's why storage condition {{is one of the most}} important issues to maintain post-harvest quality. For this purpose, a factorial experiment based on randomized complete block design with two factors and three replicates was carried out. The factors were storage conditions of onion bulbs with five levels (4 oC in the seed storage apparatus, 25 and 30 oC without using rosemary leaves and branches in the incubator, and 25 and 30 oC using rosemary leaves and branches in the incubator) and storage times with ten levels (10 consecutive weeks). The storage feedbacks of bulbs in terms of the weight loss (WL) and the average bud length (ABL) of bulbs were analyzed. The storage of bulbs at 25 oC using <b>rosemary</b> <b>fresh</b> leaves and branches inside each bag of bulbs after 10 weeks resulted in the lowest weight loss and average bud length, and significantly controlled the post-harvest fungal rotting and improved the shelf life of bulbs. The findings of this study indicated the high potential of <b>rosemary</b> <b>fresh</b> leaves and branches, which can be considered as an alternative strategy to control post-harvest fungal rotting and to improve the storage life of bulbs considering its simplicity and efficacy in decreasing the storage cost, the weight loss and sprouting without causing any environmental toxicity...|$|R
40|$|Distillation wastewaters (DWWs) are {{generated}} during the essential oil steam distillation from aromatic herbs. Despite of growing interest on novel source of natural antioxidant compounds as food additives, studies on DWWs are scarse. Herein, {{the potential of}} DWWs produced by the distillation of packaged <b>fresh</b> basil, <b>rosemary</b> and sage wastes was evaluated by chemical and antioxidant characterization. HPLC-DAD-HRMS profiling revealed that DWWs contain water-soluble phenolic compounds, mainly caffeic acid derivatives and flavonoid glycosides, with rosmarinic acid (RA) as predominant components (29 â 8 ̆ 09 ̆ 3135 mg/ 100 mL). DWWs demonstrated high levels of total phenolic compounds (TPC, 152 â 8 ̆ 09 ̆ 3443 mg GAE/ 100 mL) and strong antioxidant capacities, in ORAC, DPPH and ABTS assays (1101 â 8 ̆ 09 ̆ 34720, 635 â 8 ̆ 09 ̆ 34244 and 571 â 8 ̆ 09 ̆ 33145 Î¼mol TE/ 100 mL, respectively). Highly significant correlations of TEAC values with TPC and RA contents revealed that phenolic compounds and high RA content were responsible of DWWs antioxidant properties. Thus, DWWs are proposed as a new promising source of natural food additives and/or functional ingredients for cosmetic, nutraceutical and food applications...|$|R
60|$|As {{time went}} on, the chasteness and pure virginity of this mutual reservation, {{only served to}} dress the {{portrait}} in sweeter, because still more mysterious attractions; and to fling, as it were, <b>fresh</b> fennel and <b>rosemary</b> around the revered memory of the father. Though, indeed, as previously recounted, Pierre now and then loved to present to himself for some fanciful solution the penultimate secret of the portrait, in so far, as that involved his mother's distaste; yet the cunning analysis in which such a mental procedure would involve him, never voluntarily transgressed that sacred limit, where his mother's peculiar repugnance began to shade off into ambiguous considerations, touching any unknown possibilities in the character and early life of the original. Not, that he had altogether forbidden his fancy to range in such fields of speculation; but all such imaginings must be contributory to that pure, exalted idea of his father, which, in his soul, was based upon the known acknowledged facts of his father's life.|$|R

40|$|A rapid {{analytic}} {{method for}} isolation, separation and determination of some phenolic diterpenes and triterpenes from <b>fresh</b> and dry <b>rosemary</b> leaves (Rosmarinus officinalis L.) has been developed. The components {{identified in the}} plant extract were trimethylsilylated derivatives of rosmarinic acid, phenolic diterpenes, carnosol and carnosic acid, pentacyclic triterpenoids, ursolic, oleanolic, betulinic acid and betulin. Experiments were performed to establish the optimum conditions for solvent selection, mode and duration of extraction, derivatisation, and to set chromatographic conditions, as well. The enumerated compounds have numerous similarities in the chemical and pharmacological character. Publications dealing with separation and determination of diterpenes and triterpenes in plant material report many different analytic methods, but most extended are high performance liquid chromatography and thin layer chromatography. The procedures are complicated, since the separation and the determination of terpenic compounds are difficult because of structure similarity. Therefore, gas chromatography and mass spectrometry were used as methods enabling good separation and parallel determination of phenolic diterpenes and triterpenes...|$|R
40|$|Essential oils (EOs) {{extracted}} from <b>fresh</b> leaves of <b>rosemary</b> (Rosmarinus officinalis L.), lavender (Lavandula angustifolia Miller), chan (Hyptis suaveolens (L.) Poiteau (Lamiaceae) and arborvitae (Thuja occidentalis L. e Cupressaceae) were evaluated for their toxicity against adult Mediterranean fruit fly, Ceratitis capitata (Wiedemann) (Diptera Tephritidae), a worldwide fruit pest. The chemical {{composition of the}} EOs was also investigated. T. occidentalis and H. suaveolens EOs were dominated by monoterpene hydrocarbons, followed by sesquiterpene hydrocarbons in H. suaveolens and oxygenated sesquiterpenes in T. occidentalis. Oxygenated monoterpenes were the main chemical class in R. officinalis and L. angustifolia EOs. In ingestion toxicity assays, T. occidentalis was the most toxic oil, with an LC 50 of 5371 ppm. At the highest dose (2. 5 % w/v), no differences between the four EOs were observed in the ingestion toxicity assay. Topical applications revealed that all the EOs had a good insecticidal activity at 24 h. At 0. 1 mL/fly, R. officinalis, L. angustifolia and T. occidentalis causedmortality rates higher than 70 %. In fumigation trials, the essential oils of L. angustifolia and R. officinalis were the most toxic at 24 h, with CL 50 of 9. 09 and 16. 73 mg/L air, respectively. Generally, all the EOs showed remarkable toxic effects against medfly adults, regardless of the bioassay used. The development of a technology that allows the incorporation of the EO in a food bait could provide an alternative method of C. capitata attract and kill field application...|$|R

Focaccia al rosmarino may be served as antipasto (appetizer), table bread or snack. Whole or sliced <b>fresh</b> <b>rosemary</b> leaves may be used, as can dried rosemary. It may be garnished with sprigs of <b>fresh</b> <b>rosemary</b> after baking and sprinkled with salt.|$|E

50|$|In the Elizabethan era, wedding guests would scatter flower petals {{from the}} bride's {{home to the}} church. Flower girls {{followed}} musicians in the wedding procession, carrying a gilded rosemary branch and a silver bride's cup adorned with ribbons. The cup was usually filled with flower petals or rosemary leaves, {{as an alternative to}} a basket. Other alternatives included a small bunch of rosemary sprigs used as a sweet posy or a small floral bouquet, incorporating sprigs of <b>fresh</b> <b>rosemary.</b>|$|E
50|$|The exact {{date of the}} {{invention}} of Hungary water is lost to history. It is equally unclear who in particular created it. Some sources say that a monk-recluse who first gave it to Elisabeth, though most likely it was made by a court alchemist (who could also have been a monk, thus reconciling the two traditions). The oldest surviving recipes call for distilling <b>fresh</b> <b>rosemary</b> (and possibly thyme) with strong brandy, while later formulations contain lavender, mint, sage, marjoram, costus, orange blossom and lemon.|$|E
50|$|It {{is made by}} {{stirring}} chickpea flour into {{a mixture}} of water and olive oil to form a loose batter, pouring it into a pan to make a pancake typically 4mm thick, and baking {{it for a few}} minutes, traditionally in an open oven in a tin-plated copper baking-pan. Farinata may be seasoned with <b>fresh</b> <b>rosemary,</b> pepper and sea salt. Traditionally farinata is cut into irregularly shaped triangular slices, and eaten (with no toppings) on small plates with optional black pepper. Elsewhere in Italy - traditionally in Tuscany, where it is called cecina (from the Italian word for chickpea, ceci) - it is served stuffed into small focaccia (mainly in Pisa) or between two slices of bread, as it is traditional in Livorno. It is sold in pizzerias and bakeries.|$|E
