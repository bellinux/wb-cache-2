When he is in his demon form, his hair grown longer, has black wings, and wears a mask that looks like a crow's beak.

500|$|Both Fishburne and Bassett also {{remarked that}} an {{important}} message of Akeelah and the Bee is to [...] "speak properly" [...] rather than strictly in vernacular, although Bassett {{emphasized the importance of}} the film's themes beyond spelling and spelling bees.

[...] In spite of knowing its importance, it [...] "deconstruct the 'competition' paradigm of learning", according to Ingman.

[...] It {{is for this reason that}} she is sought by Pompey the Great's son, Sextus Pompeius. <b>He</b> <b>wants</b> <b>her</b> to perform a necromantic rite so that he might be able to learn the outcome of the Battle of Pharsalus.

She cleans the corpse's organs, and fills the body with a potion (consisting of, among other things, a mixture of warm blood, [...] "lunar poison", and [...] "everything that nature wickedly bears") so as to bring the dead body back to life. The spirit is summoned, but, at first, refuses to return to its old body. She then promptly threatens the entire universe by promising to summon [...] "that god at whose dread name earth trembles". Immediately following this outburst, the corpse is reanimated and offers a bleak description of a civil war in the underworld, as well as a rather ambiguous (at least, to Sextus Pompeius) prophecy about the fate that lies in store for Pompey and his kin.|$|E
