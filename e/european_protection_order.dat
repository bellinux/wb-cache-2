It forms the legal basis for mutual {{recognition}} of criminal and administrative protection orders issued in the Member States. A protection order is a prohibition {{to enter a}} certain street or area, to contact a person, to enter ones home, or another legal order which tries to influence someone’s behavior or limit his or her freedom {{with the aim of}} protecting (an) other person(s). When a protection order is issued in an EU Member State, the victim no longer has to initiate legal proceedings when he or she moves to or stays in another Member State.

40|$|Since the 1994 Violence Against Women Act (VAWA) {{was signed}} into law, {{individuals}} (namely, women) seeking safety from intimate partner violence have increasingly sought out civil <b>protection</b> <b>orders.</b> Each year, approximately one million civil <b>protection</b> <b>orders</b> are issued in the United States. This means that, everyday thousands of individuals experiencing violence apply for <b>protection</b> <b>orders</b> through the civil court system. Despite being widely {{considered the most}} commonly sought-out legal remedy for victims, mainly women, trying to stop violence committed primarily by men, {{the vast majority of}} research on domestic violence or intimate partner violence has neglected to study civil <b>protection</b> <b>orders.</b> This article presents a summary of research on <b>protection</b> <b>orders,</b> including the effectiveness of <b>protection</b> <b>orders,</b> the effectiveness of justice system responses and interventions in conjunction with <b>protection</b> <b>orders,</b> victims’ experiences with <b>protection</b> <b>orders</b> (i. e., barriers to help-seeking and experiences both with criminal and civil justice systems), marginalized women’s experiences with <b>protection</b> <b>orders,</b> how victims understand the process of applying for an <b>order</b> of <b>protection,</b> perceptions of court helpfulness (both victim perceptions as well as court/system actor perceptions), advocacy models associated with <b>protection</b> <b>orders</b> (i. e., victim-centered, community-based, and court-based), an assessment of risk for future abuse, and synopses of research on domestic violence offenders and abusers.

40|$|Despite {{the pervasiveness}} of {{violence}} in teen relationships, civil <b>protection</b> <b>order</b> statutes largely ignore teens. The accessibility of <b>protection</b> <b>orders</b> for teens depends primarily on the scope of their rights to standing and legal capacity to pursue claims for protection. Because states largely fail to detail expressly {{the circumstances under which}} teens are accorded standing to seek <b>protection</b> <b>orders</b> and legal capacity to represent their own interests in related court proceedings, the accessibility of <b>protection</b> <b>orders</b> for teens in most states remains in flux. This article explores legal principles and policy arguments that support the extension of standing and legal capacity to teens to seek <b>protection</b> <b>orders</b> without adult involvement where laws are ambiguous.

40|$|With the {{introduction}} of the Treaty of Lisbon came the possibility for Member States to launch an initiative under the Ordinary Legislative Procedure. This came into being as the scope of co-decision was expanded to cover the more sensitive issues of the third pillar (such as judicial cooperation in criminal matters and police cooperation).

40|$|During {{the past}} 15 years, {{researchers}} have documented the pervasiveness, severity, and lasting impact of dating violence on American adolescents. Time and again studies also have shown teens to be firmly resistant to disclosing abuse to adults. Nonetheless, state civil <b>protection</b> <b>order</b> statutes-the gateways {{to the civil}} legal remedy most effective at preventing future violence and addressing individual safety needs in abusive adult relationships - remain barriers to access to justice for abused teens. State <b>protection</b> <b>order</b> statutes exclude teens from their protections by restricting rights to standing by age {{and the relationship between}} the parties. When states grant teens standing, they often deter teens from pursuing the protections extended to them by restricting teens’ legal capacity and requiring them to enlist adults to seek protections on their behalf, or by notifying parents that teens have initiated cases on their own. Furthermore, despite the widespread recognition of the problem of teen dating violence today, many <b>protection</b> <b>order</b> statutes say nothing at all about whether and under what circumstances minors are accorded standing to seek their protections and the legal capacity to represent their own interests in related proceedings. Where children’s rights are left undefined, they are often presumed not to exist. Thus, many <b>protection</b> <b>order</b> statutes that appear to offer protections without regard to age exclude teens in practice by failing to articulate the extent and scope of teens’ rights. This article explores the failure of civil <b>protection</b> <b>order</b> statutes to offer effective protections for teens who experience abuse. It first discusses the problem of teen dating violence and the singularity of the civil <b>protection</b> <b>order</b> remedy. It then analyzes {{the extent to which the}} civil <b>protection</b> <b>order</b> statutes in the fifty states and the District of Columbia facilitate and limit teens’ access to <b>protection</b> <b>orders</b> through provisions on (1) standing, (2) legal capacity, and (3) parent notification. The article challenges legislatures to solidify legal protections for abused teens by explicitly granting teens standing and legal capacity to seek <b>protection</b> <b>orders</b> independently, without parent notification. In the interim, many teens may be left without protection. To this end, the article examines how established legal principles support court extension of civil <b>protection</b> <b>orders</b> to teens pursuing relief on their own under ambiguous statutes. Finally, the article proposes statutory reforms to ensure abused teens ready access to justice...|$|R

40|$|Abstract While {{reasons for}} {{returning}} to abusive partners have received considerable attention {{in research on}} intimate partner violence, {{few studies have examined}} the reasons why victims fail to follow through with the <b>protection</b> <b>order</b> process, {{regardless of whether or not}} they return to their abusive partners.

Recognizing that reasons given for withdrawing a <b>protection</b> <b>order</b> often follow common themes, individual responses were organized into several “domains, ” or groupings of such reasons.

This was closely followed by the domain addressing emotional attachment to the abuser. Implications for future research and policy are discussed...|$|R

40|$|This {{article focuses}} on Title II, Safe Homes for Women, specifically, interstate {{enforcement}} of <b>protection</b> <b>orders.</b> Prior to the enactment of VAWA, the majority of states did not afford full faith and credit to <b>protection</b> <b>orders</b> issued in sister states! This was a serious breach in the protection afforded victims of domestic violence. Without full faith and credit statutes, a state only {{has the power to}} protect victims of domestic violence within its boundaries, limiting the protection afforded to victims if they are forced to move or flee to another state. Prior to the VAWA, in <b>order</b> to receive <b>protection</b> in the foreign state, a victim had to petition the foreign state 2 ̆ 7 s court for a new <b>protection</b> <b>order.</b> Because of due process requirements, the batterer had to be served with notice regarding pending protection proceedings, thus revealing the victim 2 ̆ 7 s whereabouts and putting the victim in a dangerous situation. In the absence of a full faith and credit statute, jurisdictional problems could arise. A state may not have jurisdiction to issue a new <b>protection</b> <b>order</b> unless abuse takes place within its boundaries. In addition, there are other problems that arise out of the requirement of refiling for a <b>protection</b> <b>order</b> including: additional filing fees; language barriers; the difference in each state 2 ̆ 7 s domestic violence laws regarding availability, duration, and scope of protection; inadequate transportation; access to legal assistance; and child care facilities. This article examines existing procedures for enforcing interstate <b>protection</b> <b>orders</b> in states that have full faith and credit statutes. It then proposes methods by which practitioners can utilize the VAWA under their state 2 ̆ 7 s existing systems and explores model approaches to implementing the VAWA by looking at the roles that practitioners, courts, and law enforcement officials should play. Finally, this article will address the issues of mutual <b>protection</b> <b>orders</b> {{and the creation of a}} new federal crime under the VAWA...|$|R
