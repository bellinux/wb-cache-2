It is based on simulations carried out with the 3 D biomechanical tongue model developed at ICP, which is now controlled with the Lambda model (Equilibrium-Point Hypothesis). The influence of short-delay orosensory feedback on posture stability is assessed by testing different muscle force/muscle length relationships (Invariant Characteristics). Muscle activation patterns necessary to maintain the tongue in a schwa position are proposed, and the relations <b>of</b> <b>head</b> position, <b>tongue</b> shape and muscle activations are analyzed...|$|R

40|$|Abstract: In {{this paper}} we {{described}} the tongue textures with Fractal Geometry method.

The variation of intensity and texture complexity <b>of</b> <b>Tongue</b> images are calculated by Fractal dimension methods. Box Counting Method and Harfa programmed software {{are used to}} find out the dimension <b>of</b> the <b>Tongue</b> textures. Lacunarity is used to measure the “gappiness ” <b>of</b> the <b>Tongue</b> structures. Gliding box algorithm is used to find the Lacunarity.

2500|$|Besides {{acting as}} a prayer language, tongues also {{function}} as the gift <b>of</b> <b>tongues.</b> Not all Spirit-filled believers possess the gift <b>of</b> <b>tongues.</b> Its purpose is for gifted persons to publicly [...] "speak with God in praise, to pray or sing in the Spirit, or to speak forth in the congregation". There is a division among Pentecostals {{on the relationship between}} the gifts <b>of</b> <b>tongues</b> and prophecy. One school of thought believes that the gift <b>of</b> <b>tongues</b> is always directed from man to God, in which case it is always prayer or praise spoken to God but in the hearing of the entire congregation for encouragement and consolation. Another school of thought believes that the gift <b>of</b> <b>tongues</b> can be prophetic, in which case the believer delivers a [...] "message in tongues"—a prophetic utterance given {{under the influence of the}} Holy Spirit—to a congregation.|$|R

40|$|Objective: In this study, optical data on color <b>of</b> <b>tongue</b> tips were {{collected}} by using a visible reflection spectrum system. Quantitative method <b>of</b> <b>tongue</b> inspection and classification <b>of</b> <b>tongue</b> states including pale, pale red, red and crimson manifestations were investigated. Methods: Chromaticity coordinates <b>of</b> the <b>tongue</b> tips from 98 subjects were calculated {{on the basis of}} the visible reflection spectrum. The tongue color was quantified and classified by the visible reflection spectrum in the range from 590 nm to 780 nm, based on the higher red-band energy distribution on the tongue tip color. Results: It was found that comparison and analysis <b>of</b> <b>tongue</b> tip color from different samples would be well-suited after spectrum vector normalization, and the difference <b>of</b> <b>tongue</b> tip color between different samples could be observed easily when the tongue tip optical data were sited in CIE 1931 chromaticity diagram. The tongue tip colors were analyzed quantitatively and classified by the spectral energy intensity at the wavelength of 670 nm and (or) spectral energy ratio of red bank from 590 nm to 780 nm. The results of classification showed that there was sound corresponding accuracy with the clinical diagnosis <b>of</b> pale <b>tongue,</b> pale red tongue, red tongue and crimson tongue. Conclusion: In this study, based on the collection of the information data on tongue tip characteristics with the visible spectrum from 380 nm to 780 nm, the quantitative analysis <b>of</b> <b>tongue</b> inspection for pale tongue, pale red tongue, red tongue and crimson tongue was established. The quantitative value for tongue tip color is an effective method for classification of the condition <b>of</b> the <b>tongue</b> tip, which provides a useful tool for the modernization <b>of</b> <b>tongue</b> inspection in traditional Chinese medicine...|$|R

40|$|OBJECTIVES: Tongue {{cleaning}} {{has been}} advocated to improve oral malodor {{and to reduce}} reinfection of periodontal niches by eliminating tongue coating and/or reducing putrefaction by bacteria. MATERIAL AND METHODS: This cross-over, single-blind study on periodontitis-free, non-smoking, subjects with habitual oral hygiene (n= 16), evaluated the effect <b>of</b> <b>tongue</b> cleaning (with either plastic scraper or nylon multi-tufted toothbrush), on the microbial load <b>of</b> the <b>tongue</b> dorsum (anterior and posterior of the sulcus terminalis), the extent <b>of</b> <b>tongue</b> coating, and taste sensation for bitter, sweet, salt, and sour. Both devices had been used twice daily for 2 weeks (toothbrush three forward-backward movements along the linea mediana and for each longitudinal third of the tongue; two strokes with the scraper along the linea mediana and along the borders <b>of</b> the <b>tongue).</b> RESULTS: Two weeks <b>of</b> <b>tongue</b> brushing or scraping resulted in only negligible reductions in aerobic and anaerobic bacteria on the tongue (reductions < 0. 5 log). The amount <b>of</b> <b>tongue</b> coating, however, decreased significantly (p< 0. 05), with both devices. The taste sensation improved after 2 weeks <b>of</b> <b>tongue</b> cleaning, especially with the scraper (significant improvements for quinine and sodium chloride). CONCLUSION: Tongue cleaning improves taste sensation and seems to reduce the substrata for putrefaction, rather than the bacterial load. status: publishe...|$|R
