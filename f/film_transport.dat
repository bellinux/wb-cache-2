500|$|In 1992, Panavision {{launched}} {{a project to}} develop a camera that involved rethinking {{every aspect of the}} company's existing 35mm system. [...] Nolan Murdock and Albert Mayer Sr. headed up the design team. The new Millennium camera, replacing the Platinum as the company's flagship, was introduced in 1997. The Millennium XL came to the market in 1999 and was led by Al Mayer, Jr. [...] It soon established itself as Panavision’s new 35mm workhorse. [...] The XL was the first product in Panavision history to win both an Academy Award and a Primetime Emmy Award within the first year of official release. [...] The update to the XL, the XL2 was initially released in 2004[...] [...] The first feature films to use these latter two systems were, respectively, The Perfect Storm (2000) and Just Like Heaven (2005). The XL series not only had a much smaller camera body—making it suitable for studio, handheld, and steadicam work—but also marked the first significant change to the <b>film</b> <b>transport</b> mechanism in the camera since the Panaflex: two smaller sprocket drums for feed and take-up (a design similar to the Moviecam and subsequent Arricam) instead of one large drum to do both. As of 2006, Panavision has no further plans to develop additional film camera models.|$|E

In films with sheet resistance R< 5000 Ω the correlation singularity appears as the usual perturbative ln(V) zero bias anomaly (ZBA) in the DOS.

40|$|We have {{investigated}} the electronic properties of epitaxial orthorhombic SrIrO 3 thin-films under compressive strain. The metastable, orthorhombic SrIrO 3 thin-films are synthesized on various substrates using an epi-stabilization technique. We have observed that as in-plane lattice compression is increased, the dc-resistivity (h̊o̊) of the thin films increases by a few orders of magnitude, and the dh̊o̊/dT changes from positive to negative values. However, optical absorption spectra show Drude-like, metallic responses without an optical gap opening for all compressively-strained thin <b>films.</b> <b>Transport</b> measurements under magnetic fields show negative magneto-resistance at low temperature for compressively-strained thin-films.

50|$|A {{company called}} Photo-Pac {{produced}} a cardboard camera beginning in 1949 which shot eight exposures {{and which was}} mailed-in for processing.

Stiles had invented a way to enclose 35mm film in an inexpensive enclosure without the expensive precision <b>film</b> <b>transport</b> mechanism. It cost $1.29. Though incredibly similar to the familiar single-use cameras today, Photo-Pac failed to make a permanent impression on the market.|$|E

Our transport measurements on bulk MgB_ 2 ceramic samples also show the TAFF behavior, but do not show the quadratic field dependence of U(T,B).

Our results indicate that thermal fluctuations can be essential in determining the irreversibility field in MgB 2 though to a much lesser extent than in high-temperature superconductors.

40|$|Semiconductor {{colloidal}} {{quantum dots}} (CQDs) are being increasingly exploited in electronics, optoelectronics, and solar energy harvesting, {{using a variety}} of different architectures, mostly based on ordered 2 D or 3 D arrays of these nanostructures. A crucial issue for optimizing the performance of such devices is the ability to predict and tune the transport properties of these assemblies. In this work we provide general guidelines to precisely that effect, indicating specific materials, crystal structures, lattice arrangements, surface stoichiometries, and morphologies that favor high electron mobilities in these systems and, conversely, materials that will exhibit low mobilities if nanostructured. At the same time our results evidence a surprising independence of the <b>film’s</b> <b>transport</b> properties from those of the bulk material from which the dots are made, highlighting the crucial role of theoretical modeling to guide device design...|$|R
