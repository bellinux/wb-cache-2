40|$|This {{paper offers}} an {{approach}} for handling retention time shifts in resolving chromatographic data using the PARAFAC 2 model. In Part I {{of this series}} an algorithm for PARAFAC 2 was developed and extended to N-way arrays. It was discussed that the PARAFAC 2 model {{has a number of}} attractive features. It is unique under mild conditions though it puts fewer restrictions on the data than the well-known PARAFAC 1 model. This has important implications for the modeling of chromatographic data in which retention time shifts can be regarded as a violation of the assumption of parallel proportional profiles underlying the PARAFAC 1 model. The PARAFAC 2 model does not assume parallel proportional <b>elution</b> <b>profiles,</b> but only that the matrix of <b>elution</b> <b>profiles</b> preserve its 'inner-product structure' from sample to sample. This means that the cross-products of the matrix holding the <b>elution</b> <b>profiles</b> in its columns remain constant. Here an application using chromatographic separation based on the molecular size of thick juice samples from the beet sugar industry illustrates the benefit of using the PARAFAC 2 model.

40|$|Global {{analysis}} {{has been applied}} to resolve components in multiple gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC/MS) data sets. Global analysis methodology is based upon a parametrized model of the observed data, including random (and possibly also systematic) errors. Each elution profile is described as a function of a small number of parameters. We successfully based the description of <b>elution</b> <b>profiles</b> on an exponentially modified Gaussian. The mass spectra were described non-parametrically. Model usefulness is judged by the quality of the fit and whether the estimated parameters that describe the <b>elution</b> <b>profiles</b> and mass spectra of components are physically interpretable. Advantages of the method are most evident with multiple data sets and overlapping <b>elution</b> <b>profiles.</b> Differences between data sets are described by alignment parameters and by relative amplitude parameters. The estimated mass spectrum is identical between experiments. Global analysis and multivariate curve resolution alternating least squares (MCR-ALS) are the only methods currently developed for component resolution for the case of completely co-eluting compounds in mass spectrometry data. In the present contribution global analysis is shown to have better performance than MCR-ALS in terms of the estimated mass spectra for a variety of simulated GC mass spectrometry datasets representing components that are completely co-eluting. © 2008 Elsevier B.

40|$|This study {{addresses}} the simulation of ion chromatographic (IC) separations performed under conditions where the elution profile {{consists of a}} sequence of isocratic and gradient elution steps (referred to as "complex elution profiles"). First, models for prediction of retention under gradient elution conditions in IC were evaluated using an extensive database of gradient elution retention data. It is shown that one such model is preferred {{on the basis that}} {{it can be used to}} predict gradient retention times on the basis of isocratic input data. A method is then proposed for using this model for complex <b>elution</b> <b>profiles</b> whereby each step of the elution profile is treated separately and analyte movement through the column is mapped. An empirically based algorithm for predicting peak width under complex elution conditions is also proposed. Evaluation of the suggested approaches was undertaken on a set of 24 analyte anions and 13 analyte cations on 5 different Dionex columns using a range of 5 -step complex <b>elution</b> <b>profiles</b> that gave R 2 values for correlations between predicted and observed retention times of 0. 987 for anions and 0. 997 for cations. The simulation of separations of anions and cations using a 3 -step complex elution profile is demonstrated, with good correlation between observed and predicted chromatograms.

40|$|At pH 7. 4 {{and in the}} {{presence}} of NaHCO 3, human milk and bovine colostrum inhibited the growth of Escherichia coli O 111. Adding sufficient iron to saturate the iron-binding capacity of the lactoferrin present in the milk or colostrum prevented bacteriostasis. At pH 6. 8 neither molk nor colostrum inhibited E. coli 0111. Adjusting the pH to 7. 4 with NaHCO 3 resulted in the development of bacteriostatic activity. Adjusting the pH to 7. 4 with NaOH was ineffective. Dialyzed colostrum and milk inhibited bacterial growth at pH 6. 8 in the absence of added NaHCO 3; addition of citrate or iron abolished bacteriostasis. The chromatographic <b>elution</b> <b>profile</b> of tyrosyl-transfer ribonucleic acid (tRNA) from iron-replete E. coli differs significantly from that of tyrosyl-tRNA from iron-deficient organisms. Examination of the <b>elution</b> <b>profile</b> tyrosyl-tRNA from E. coli 0111 growing in colostrum without added NaHCO 3 showed that such bacteria were fully replete in iron. The nature of the <b>elution</b> <b>profile</b> of tyrosyl-tRNA also showed that iron was freely available to the bacteria when citrate was added to dialyzed colostrum but not available in its absence, even at pH 6. 8.

40|$|The {{shape of}} {{breakthrough}} curves and <b>elution</b> <b>profiles</b> depends strongly {{on the course}} of the specific equilibrium functions characterizing the chromatographic system. For a highly efficient system the equilibrium theory provides a methodology how to predict the band profiles.

However, adsorption isotherms often possess more complicated shapes and have inflection points in their courses. This leads to the development of composite concentration waves and results in complex shapes of breakthrough curves and <b>elution</b> <b>profiles.</b> In this paper, the equilibrium theory is used to predict breakthrough curves for a chromatographic system characterized by an adsorption isotherm with two inflection points.

Then, films were made from FL, CL and SKL. The mesostructure (macromolecular structure and aggregates or gel) of the natural rubber films was studied by size exclusion chromatography coupled to a multiangular light scattering detector (SEC-MALS). The mesostructure was analyzed on fresh films and on films stored in the laboratory for three months (slow structuring). This study showed that FL and CL films had bimodal <b>elution</b> <b>profiles</b> of long and short polyisoprene chains as revealed by the two peaks on the chromatograms at low and high elution volumes, respectively.
