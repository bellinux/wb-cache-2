5|$|The Hopewell {{tradition}} is an Aboriginal culture that flourished along American rivers from 300BCE–500CE. At its greatest extent, the Hopewell <b>Exchange</b> <b>System</b> networked cultures and societies with the peoples on the Canadian shores of Lake Ontario. Canadian {{expression of the}} Hopewellian peoples encompasses the Point Peninsula, Saugeen, and Laurel complexes.|$|E
5|$|AAC {{systems for}} this {{population}} generally begin with communication boards and/or object or picture exchanges such as the Picture Exchange Communication System (PECS). A 2009 descriptive review provided preliminary evidence that PECS is easily learned by most individuals with autism, provides communication to those {{with little or no}} functional speech, and has some limited positive impact on social interaction and challenging behaviours. A study that compared the use of a speech generating device to a picture <b>exchange</b> <b>system</b> found that both were reasonable options for children with autism, as the ease and speed of acquisition of each system was similar.|$|E
5|$|The {{land was}} officially renamed Melville Island in late 1804 or early 1805 {{in honour of}} Henry Dundas, Viscount Melville (who at the time had just been {{appointed}} First Lord of the Admiralty). A wooden barracks-style military prison was constructed to house common prisoners, the cornerstone of which was laid in 1808 and is today preserved as a monument, while a multi-storey building was designed to hold officers. As no <b>exchange</b> <b>system</b> was established with the French, the prison quickly became overcrowded. Some Spanish prisoners were also housed in the prison at this time.|$|E

5|$|Common {{threshers}} are active, strong swimmers; {{there are}} infrequent reports of them leaping {{completely out of}} the water. Like the fast-swimming sharks of the family Lamnidae, the common thresher has a strip of aerobic red muscle along its flank that is able to contract powerfully and efficiently for long periods of time. In addition, they have slow-oxidative muscles centrally located within their bodies and a blood vessel countercurrent <b>exchange</b> <b>system</b> called the rete mirabile ("wonderful net"), allowing them to generate and retain body heat. The temperature inside the red muscles of a common thresher averages 2°C (3.6°F) above that of the ambient seawater, though there is significant individual variation. Unlike the pelagic and bigeye threshers, the common thresher lacks an orbital rete mirabile to protect its eyes and brain from temperature changes.|$|E
5|$|Prior to the Inca dominance, {{specialized}} {{long distance}} merchants provided the highlanders with goods such as gold nuggets, copper hatchets, cocoa, salt etc. for redistribution among the locals, and were {{key players in}} the politics of the region. Hatchet shaped copper currency was produced by the Peruvian people, in order to obtain valuables from pre Columbian Ecuador. A maritime <b>exchange</b> <b>system</b> stretched from the west coast of Mexico to southernmost Peru, trading mostly in Spondylus, which represented rain and fertility and was considered the principal food of the gods by the people of the Inca empire. Spondylus was used in elite rituals, and the effective redistribution of it had political effect in the Andes during the pre-Hispanic times.|$|E
5|$|The Great North {{had opened}} using {{a system of}} telegraphic train orders, and as the {{signalling}} was being upgraded this was being replaced with electric tablet working over the single line sections. Now express trains had to slow to exchange tokens {{in a process that}} frequently left railwaymen injured, so James Manson, the locomotive superintendent, designed an automatic token <b>exchange</b> <b>system</b> based on apparatus used to move cotton in a factory. At first tokens were exchanged at , but soon they were exchanged at line speed. After trialling on the Fraserburgh line, the system was installed on the coast route in May 1889, and by 1 January 1893 it was in operation on all single-line sections.|$|E

5|$|Symbols are visuals used to {{represent}} objects, actions, and concepts {{through the use of}} items such as the physical object itself, colored or black and white photographs, line drawings, and written words. For users with literacy skills, alphabet-based symbols including individual letters, whole words, or parts thereof may be used in combination with the other types of symbols.Tactile symbols which are textured objects, real objects or parts of real objects that are used as a communication symbols particularly for individuals with visual impairments and/or significant intellectual impairments. Both low- and high-tech devices can incorporate the use of symbols. With low-tech devices, a communication partner is involved and must interpret the symbols chosen. Picture Communication <b>Exchange</b> <b>System</b> (PECS) is a commonly used low-tech communication system that teach individuals how to request, comment, and answer questions through the use of line drawings known as picture communication symbols (PCS). , a high-tech communication system, is an app that incorporates various symbols and motor planning. Symbols are placed in fixed position on the screen which allow users to develop motor patterns associated with certain requests or statements. The choice of symbols and aspects of their presentation, such as size and background, depend on an individual's preferences as well as their linguistic, visual, and cognitive skills. This can be determined using an assessment for symbolic understanding.|$|E
25|$|The Hopewell {{tradition}} {{was not a}} single culture or society, but a widely dispersed set of related populations, who were connected by a common network of trade routes, known as the Hopewell <b>Exchange</b> <b>System.</b> At its greatest extent, the Hopewell <b>exchange</b> <b>system</b> ran from the Southeastern United States into the southeastern Canadian shores of Lake Ontario. Within this area, societies participated in a high degree of exchange; most activity was conducted along the waterways that served as their major transportation routes.

25|$|At its {{greatest}} extent, the Hopewell <b>exchange</b> <b>system</b> {{ran from the}} Southeastern United States {{as far south as}} the Crystal River Indian Mounds into the southeastern Canadian shores of Lake Ontario in the north. Within this area, societies participated in a high degree of exchange with the highest amount of activity along waterways. The Hopewell <b>exchange</b> <b>system</b> received materials from all over what is now the United States. Most of the items traded were exotic materials and were received by people living in the major trading and manufacturing areas. These people then converted the materials into products and exported them through local and regional exchange networks. The objects created by the Hopewell <b>exchange</b> <b>system</b> spread far and wide and have been seen in many burials outside the Midwest.|$|E

50|$|In {{the gold}} {{standard}} and the Bretton Woods system, the major developed countries mainly implemented fixed <b>exchange</b> rate <b>systems.</b> Due to the devaluation of the pound around the 1970s {{and the collapse of}} the Bretton Woods system, many developed countries switched to floating exchange rates. In 1971, France started to adopt the dual <b>exchange</b> rate <b>system.</b> After that, in 1973, Italy also adopted this system. Both countries maintained these dual <b>exchange</b> rate <b>systems</b> through the early 1970s. The Belgium-Luxembourg Economic Union has been using this system since the early 1990s. Around the same time, many Latin American countries also shifted from a single <b>exchange</b> rate <b>system</b> to a dual <b>exchange</b> rate <b>system</b> or a multiple <b>exchange</b> rate <b>system.</b> With the structural adjustment to international trade that has occurred since the mid-1980s, especially the deepening of trade reform, Latin American countries have begun gradually abandoning multiple <b>exchange</b> rate <b>systems,</b> favoring instead the implementation of single <b>exchange</b> rate <b>systems.</b>|$|R
