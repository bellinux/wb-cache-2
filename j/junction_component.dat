Mechanistically, αE-catenin likely regulates cortical precursor differentiation by maintaining β-catenin signaling, as reduction of αE-catenin leads to reduction of β-catenin signaling in vivo. These results demonstrate that, at the cellular level, αE-catenin serves to maintain precursors in the proliferative ventricular zone, and suggest an unexpected function for αE-catenin in preserving β-catenin signaling during cortical development...|$|E

In developing skin, tight junctions interconnected the peridermal cells, and after the fetal stratification localized to the granular cell layer. Immunolabeling of psoriasis, lichen planus, and ichthyosis vulgaris, representing aberrant differentiation of the epidermis, showed that these conditions were associated with relocation of ZO- 1 and occludin to the spinous cells. Cultures of epidermal keratinocytes, which offer a useful model {{for the formation of}} cellular contacts, revealed that tight <b>junction</b> <b>components,</b> ZO- 1 and occludin, displayed a marked degree of colocalization relatively late during the process when the fusion zone had assumed a linear appearance.

40|$|The {{expression}} {{levels of}} the metastasis suppressor gene Nm 23 {{have been shown to}} correlate positively or inversely with prognosis in different cancer cohorts. This indicates that Nm 23 may be needed at different expression levels and may function differently in various tissues. Here we report a novel epithelial function of the Drosophila melanogaster homolog of human Nm 23, abnormal wing discs (awd). We show a dynamic expression pattern of the Awd protein during morphogenesis of the Drosophila follicle cells during oogenesis. Loss-of-function awd mutant cells result in the accumulation and spreading of adherens <b>junction</b> <b>components,</b> such as Drosophila E-cadherin, β-catenin/Armadillo, and α-spectrin, and the disruption of epithelial integrity, including breaking up of the epithelial sheet and piling up of follicle cells. In contrast, overexpression of awd diminishes adherens <b>junction</b> <b>components</b> and induces a mesenchymal-cell-like cell shape change. The gain-of-function phenotype is consistent with a potential oncogenic function of this metastasis suppressor gene. Interestingly, we demonstrate that the epithelial function of awd is mediated by Rab 5 and show that the Rab 5 expression level is downregulated in awd mutant cells. Therefore, awd modulates the level and localization of adherens <b>junction</b> <b>components</b> via endocytosis.

However, mechanisms controlling the rate of stem cell renewal are poorly understood. Additionally, whether deregulation of these mechanisms within epidermal stem cells leads to skin cancer is not known.

Loss of the long isoform from the niche causes defects in niche organization and cell size and increases the number of GSCs attached to the niche.

In patients with breast cancer, single-cell resolution RNA sequencing of CTC clusters and single CTCs, matched within individual blood samples, identifies the cell <b>junction</b> <b>component</b> plakoglobin as highly differentially expressed. In mouse models, knockdown of plakoglobin abrogates CTC cluster formation and suppresses lung metastases.

Different nephron segments exhibit unique combinations of ion channels, transporter proteins, and cell junction proteins that govern permeability between neighboring cells. The zebrafish pronephros is a valuable model to study the mechanisms of vertebrate nephrogenesis, but many basic features of segment gene expression in renal progenitors and mature nephrons have not been characterized. Here, we analyzed the temporal and spatial expression pattern of tight <b>junction</b> <b>components</b> during zebrafish kidney ontogeny.

Methodology/Principal Findings: In this work we characterise the function of the Drosophila cold gene, that codes for a protein belonging to the Ly 6 superfamily of extracellular ligands. Analysis of cold mutants shows that this gene is specifically required for the organisation of the septate junctions in epithelial tissues and in the nervous system, where its contribution is essential for the maintenance of the blood-brain barrier.

Deletion of the corresponding NC 14 A region in a genetically modified mouse model (ΔNC 14 A) decreased the amount of ColXVII in skin, but it did not prevent ectodomain shedding.

In an effort to assess host factors interacting with dengue virus, we identified claudin- 1, a major tight <b>junction</b> <b>component,</b> as an essential cell surface protein for dengue virus entry. When claudin- 1 was knocked down in Huh 7. 5 cells via shRNA, the amount of dengue virus entering host cells was reduced.

Furthermore, restoring the expression of claudin- 1 in the knockdown cells facilitated dengue virus entry. The interaction between claudin- 1 and dengue viral prM protein was further demonstrated using the pull-down assay. Deletion of the extracellular loop 1 (ECL 1) of claudin- 1 abolished such interaction, so did point mutations C 54 A, C 64 A and I 32 M on ECL 1. These results suggest that the interaction between viral protein prM and host protein claudin- 1 was essential for dengue entry.

Junction formation was monitored by transepithelial resistance measurements and localization of junctionspecific proteins by immunofluorescence. The tight <b>junction</b> <b>components</b> ZO- 1, ZO- 2, endogenous ZO- 3, and occludin were mislocalized {{during the early stages}} of tight junction assembly. Similarly, the adherens junction proteins E-cadherin and �-catenin were also delaye...|$|R
40|$|Thesis (Ph. D.) [...] University of Washington, 2012 The {{blood-testis barrier}} {{includes}} a tight junction barrier between Sertoli cells that restricts solutes of varying size and charge from crossing the paracellular space thus enabling {{the formation of}} unique microenvironments within seminiferous tubules and providing immune privilege to meiotic and postmeiotic cells. Remarkably, large syncytial chains of germ cells are able to transit the Sertoli cell tight junctions (SCTJs) without compromising their integrity. We studied how germ cell cysts migrate across the SCTJs using confocal microscopy to visualize the interplay of SCTJ components during the transit event. Consequently, {{we were able to}} determine that the germ cells accomplish this remarkable feat by becoming briefly enclosed within a network of transient compartments fully­bounded by old tight junctions on the adluminal side and new tight junctions on the basal side. We also found that claudin- 3 (CLDN 3), a tight junction protein, is transiently incorporated into new tight junctions and that formation of new tight junctions is disrupted in mice lacking androgen signaling in somatic Sertoli cells. We followed up on these initial discoveries by generating mice that had floxed Cldn 3 locus. To our surprise, we found that Cldn 3 knockout mice were fertile and had an intact SCTJ barrier. We then further investigated the expression of tight <b>junction</b> <b>components</b> in mice lacking androgen signaling in somatic Sertoli cells, and found that several tight <b>junction</b> <b>components</b> we down-regulated in these mice in addition to Cldn 3, including Cldn 13, Cldn 20, Tjp 1 and Tjp 2 isoform C...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. Tight {{junctions}} are {{the most}} apical components of endothelial and epithelial intercellular cleft. In the endothelium these structures {{play an important role}} in the control of paracellular permeability to circulating cells and solutes. The only known integral membrane protein localized at sites of membrane–membrane interaction of tight junctions is occludin, which is linked inside the cells to a complex network of cytoskeletal and signaling proteins. We report here the identification of a novel protein (junctional adhesion molecule [JAM]) that is selectively concentrated at intercellular junctions of endothelial and epithelial cells of different origins. Confocal and immunoelectron microscopy shows that JAM codistributes with tight <b>junction</b> <b>components</b> at the apical region of the intercellular cleft. A cDNA clone encodin...|$|R
