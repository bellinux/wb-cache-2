5000|$|The EB-1 {{had a solid}} {{mahogany}} body {{finished with}} a brown stain, and a raised pickguard. It had a 30.5" [...] scale set neck—rather than the 34" [...] scale of the Fender Precision Bass or the 41.5" [...] scale of the 3/4-sized upright bass favored by many upright bassists of the time. To appeal to upright bass players, the EB-1 had a telescopic <b>end</b> <b>pin</b> so bassists could choose to play the EB-1 in an upright position, as well as horizontally. False f-holes and purfling on the body imitated the appearance of an upright bass.|$|E
5000|$|Following Fender's lead, in 1953, Gibson {{released}} the first short scale violin-shaped electric bass with extendable <b>end</b> <b>pin,</b> {{allowing it to}} be played upright or horizontally. Gibson renamed the Electric Bass in 1958 to the EB-1. Also in 1958 Gibson {{released the}} maple arched top EB-2 described in the Gibson catalogue as [...] "A hollow-body electric bass that features a Bass/Baritone pushbutton for two different tonal characteristics". In 1959 these were followed by the more conventional-looking EB-0 Bass. The EB-0 was very similar to a Gibson SG in appearance (although the earliest examples have a slab-sided body shape closer {{to that of the}} double-cutaway Les Paul Special).|$|E
40|$|Abstract [...] DWDM is a {{transmission}} technique which can multiplex many different wavelengths {{on a single}} fiber medium. Each fiber contains a set of optical channel in parallel form with slightly different wavelengths. DWDM employs light wavelength to transfer data bit by bit in parallel. In this work we have designed and simulated 32 -channel with 40 Gbps, DWDM system having specific external transmitter with NRZ encoder and Mech-Zehnder modulator over 100 Km. At the receiving <b>end</b> <b>PIN</b> photo diode is used with low pass Bessel filter. The whole DWDM is simulated by taking into consideration EDFA amplifier.

40|$|Abstract. In {{this paper}} {{critical}} buckling loads for axially functionally graded (FG) beams are studied. It {{is assumed that}} material properties of the beam vary exponentially through the axial direction.

Unboundedness of solutions of boundary value problems for Timoshenko beam equations is studied, and it is shown that {{the magnitude of the}} displacement of the beam grows up to ∞ as under some assumptions on the forcing term. Our approach is to reduce the multidimensional problems to one-dimensional problems for fourth-order ordinary differential inequalities...|$|R

5000|$|As the authenticist {{movement}} developed, it grew {{ever more}} devoted to historical rather than revival-style technology. Plexiglas or metal {{upper and lower}} guides were abandoned for the historical wooden guides, heavy jack <b>end</b> <b>pins</b> were abandoned, piano-style keyboards were replaced by the lighter historical type, and steel piano-wire strings were replaced by iron or brass. The authenticist instruments have largely vanquished the heavy revival instruments of the earlier 20th century.|$|R
5000|$|In a {{crossover}} cable, pins do not so correspond; {{most often}} in crossover cables some cables are swapped, meaning that if pin 1 on one <b>end</b> goes to <b>pin</b> 2 on the other <b>end,</b> then <b>pin</b> 2 on the first <b>end</b> goes to <b>pin</b> 1 on the second end, and not to pin 3 or some other: such crossover cables are symmetric, meaning that they work identically regardless of which way you plug them in (if you turn the cable around, it still connects the same pins as before).|$|R

50|$|A mode of {{vibration}} {{is characterized}} by a modal frequency and a mode shape. It is numbered according to the number of half waves in the vibration. For example, if a vibrating beam with both <b>ends</b> <b>pinned</b> displayed a mode shape of half of a sine wave (one peak on the vibrating beam) it would be vibrating in mode 1. If it had a full sine wave (one peak and one trough) it would be vibrating in mode 2.|$|R
40|$|The main aim of {{this study}} is to compare the {{buckling}} phenomenon of metal strip under both <b>ends</b> <b>pinned</b> setting. Buckling may be demonstrated by pressing the opposite edge of a plate toward one another. In achieving the objective, this research involves design and fabrication of the buckling test rig, run the experiment on test rig under condition both <b>ends</b> are <b>pinned</b> and to compare the experimental result with computer simulation. This thesis describes the methods of designing, fabricating and experiment the lateral bending test equipment. Started with test rig design, it has been developed. using SOLIDWORKS 2011. It is continued with fabrication work in FKM laboratory. Specific for the <b>pinned</b> <b>ends</b> design, V shape feature has been adopted in the design using a rectangular aluminum. The next stage is on experimental work, where the tests have been conducted as the planned test loading. The specimen showed buckling phenomenon and strain has been measured using the strain gauge connected to data logger system. The value of strain from experimental will be compare with strain values from ABAQUS simulation. From this project, we can prove that the experimental result is same with the simulation result...|$|R

50|$|At {{the other}} end of the neck is the tailblock which {{contains}} pins or brads for securing the other (loop) end of the strings. Strings are stretched between the <b>end</b> <b>pins</b> and tuners, passing over a bridge (at the tailblock end), and a nut (at the headstock), which determines the sounding length of the strings. In between the nut and the bridge lies the fingerboard, which is fitted with (typically) 12-16 metal, diatonically-spaced frets; a zero fret may or may not be employed. Between the end of the fingerboard and the bridge the neck is carved down creating a scalloped hollow that passes close to the top of the soundbox. This area, called the strum hollow, is the space in which the plectrum, fingers, or beater is employed to sound the strings (see Playing).|$|R
