40|$|The {{objectives}} {{of this study}} were primarily to investigate the design and the use of a patient workstation in a <b>gastro-enterology</b> clinic. In particular, to investigate a more interactive form of patient-computer interviewing by combining computer interrogation of the patient with patient interrogation of the computer. The main question that this study addressed was whether or not patients should be offered more 'freedom' in their interaction with the computer such that they could stop or 'interrupt' the computer interview to find out more information. A subordinate question to the main question was whether or not, within the combined system, a 'tailored' or an adaptive type of information provision is 'better' than a more general type. A patient workstation was developed and evaluated to combine computer interrogation of the patient and patient interrogation of the computer. A new version of the existing GLAsgow diagnostic system for DYSpepsia-GLADYS was developed. This version allowed the combination of the 'pure' interviewing system GLADYS and an interactive health information system focused on the health needs of dyspeptic patients. Evaluation studies compared three situations for the system, where patients were automatically randomised to use on the of the three styles. (1) Style A: Computer interview or interrogation of the patient followed by patient interrogation of the computer, where the patient can seek general health information in <b>gastro-enterology</b> after the computer interview. (2) Style B: Same as style A but allows the patients to interrupt the computer interview to seek health information in <b>gastro-enterology.</b> (3) Style C: half of the patients from style B were presented with a selected range of information in <b>gastro-enterology</b> adapted to some degree to their own characteristics and to their interview responses...|$|E

The risk to have a missed appointment is higher for patients that come {{for the first time in}} the hospital, coming for a visit, having an appointment in the afternoon, having less than 26 years and that have taken an appointment a long time ago. The loss of income in <b>gastro-enterology</b> was 77 Euro and 32 Euro outside <b>gastro-enterology</b> for a loss of income of 109. 20 Euro by patient. The estimated loss of income for 711 patients that have missed their appointment is 71, 984 Euro. Two preventive strategies of reminders were tested: the telephone reminder and the mail reminder. The non-attendance rate was lower for patients with a mail reminder. The percentage of deferred or cancelled appointments is higher for patients with a telephone reminder. The low cost of a reminder (telephone or mail) should stimulate the hospital direction to develop a system of reminders to limit the non-attendance rate, at least for patients with a higher risk of non-attendance.

A new mesalamine formulation, balsalazide disodium, is now available for the treatment of ulcerative colitis (UC). Balsalazide may be utilized as first line therapy for patients with UC, or patients who are intolerant to other mesalamine preparations. In the area of irritable bowel syndrome, alosetron was removed from the market after reports that it was associated with severe constipation and death, although a causal relationship could not be established. Published data examines the risk of certain medications and the devel-opment of reflux disease and esophageal adenocarcinoma.

Hence, orthopedic surgeons routinely use a shaver to remove the femoral and tibial remnant. Future studies need to assess photo toxicity of excitation wavelengths in violet (390  nm- 405  nm) to the tissues within the joints. Though, previous applications within the urology <b>gastro-enterology</b> and abdominal surgery have shown that the illumination with fluorescence excitation wavelengths in violet (390  nm- 405  nm) is safe and harmless (Schmidbauer et al. 2004). Additionally, excitation will be short in duration (seconds). The use of fresh bovine knees and fresh-frozen cadaveric human knees have demonstrated its robustness. Therefore, we have the confidence that the native insertion site will be visible in patients. Another concern was that the image quality of the cadaveric bovine knee had a better SNR than the cadaveric human knees. A reason for this difference {{can be explained by the}} difference in freshness and storage of the samples. The bovine knees were fresh and never frozen while the human knees were frozen and stored for at least a year. Literature has shown that the autofluoresence of collageneous tissue decreases with tissue freshness and with freezing-thaw cycles (Palmer et al. 2002).|$|E
40|$|A patient-centred {{approach}} is increasingly advocated and incorporated in medical education. Due to its multi-dimensionality, however, {{the concept of}} patient-centredness appears {{to be hard to}} measure and, consequently, to evaluate. The objective {{of this study was to}} develop an instrument to measure patient-centredness in line with one central dimension, i. e. physicians' explorative communication skills: the tendency to encourage (or discourage) patients to express their perspective on illness and treatment, by displaying facilitating and inhibiting behaviours. The paper describes the development of the patient-centred behaviour coding instrument (PBCI), and first results of validity and reliability of the instrument. The study was conducted in the outpatient division of an academic teaching hospital in The Netherlands, where follow-up encounters were videotaped and coded. Participants were 30 residents and specialists in general internal medicine, rheumatology and <b>gastro-enterology,</b> and 323 patients having a (video-taped) follow-up appointment with one of these physicians. All recorded consultations were coded using the PBCI. Statistical analyses verified the existence of two dimensions of the PBCI: facilitating and inhibiting behaviours. Interestingly, open and closed questions generally appeared to be indicative of both the facilitating and the inhibiting dimension; only open and closed questions with a psycho-social content were unambiguously classified as facilitating behaviours. Reliability of the facilitating behaviours was high, while reliability of the inhibiting behaviours was moderate. Besides infrequent observations of the inhibiting behaviours, low reliability was partly due to individual inter-rater variability. A global rating of patient-centredness appeared to correlate with the two dimensions in the expected direction: positively with the facilitating and negatively with the inhibiting dimension, indicating the convergent validity of the instrument.

40|$|OBJECTIVES: To achieve {{international}} consensus {{across multiple}} specialties on a generic ultrasound rating scale using a Delphi technique. METHODS: Ultrasound experts from Obstetrics-Gynaecology, Surgery, Urology, Radiology, Rheumatology, Emergency Medicine, and <b>Gastro-Enterology</b> representing North America, Australia, and Europe were identified. A multi-round {{survey was conducted}} to obtain consensus between these experts. Of 60 invited experts, 44 experts {{agreed to participate in}} the first Delphi round, 41 remained in the second round, and 37 completed the third Delphi round. Seven key elements of the ultrasound examination were identified from existing literature and recommendations from international ultrasound societies. All experts rated the importance of these seven elements on a five-point Likert scale in the first round and suggested potential new elements for the assessment of ultrasound skills. In the second round, the experts re-rated all elements and a third round was conducted to allow final comments. Agreement on which elements to include in the final rating scale was pre-defined as more than 80 % of the experts rating an element four or five, on importance to the ultrasound examination. RESULTS: Two additional elements were suggested by more than 10 % of the experts in the first Delphi round. Consensus was obtained to include these two new elements along with five of the original elements in the final assessment instrument: 1) Indication for the examination 2) Applied knowledge of ultrasound equipment 3) Image optimization 4) Systematic examination 5) Interpretation of images 6) Documentation of examination and 7) Medical decision making. CONCLUSION: International multispecialty consensus was achieved on the content of a generic ultrasound rating scale. This is the first step to ensure valid assessment of clinicians in different medical specialties using ultrasound...|$|E
40|$|Aim : Monocentric {{retrospective}} paediatric study describing indications for gastrostomy {{and major}} complications, compared to literature data {{as part of}} a quality check. Methods : Records of all gastrostomy patients consulting at the UZ Ghent paediatric <b>gastro-enterology</b> department between January 2007 -December 2009 were reviewed in December 2010 regarding indication, age and weight at tube insertion, insertion method, major complications and current gastrostomy tube type. Results : 178 patients were included of which 165 (93 %) were placed using the endoscopic pull technique, the others were placed surgically (n = 13). Neurodevelopmental disability with oral motor dysfunction was the major indication (113, 63 %). Other indications were failure to thrive due to concomitant disease (65, 37 %). Median age at tube insertion was 3 yr (interquartile range (IQR) 0. 6 - 9) with median tube time of 3. 9 yr (IQR 1. 9 - 7. 2). Immediate complications were 1 peritonitis and 1 post-insertion fever episode. Late complications (10, 5. 6 %) were 1 gastrocolic fistula, 1 dislocation and 8 buried bumpers after 4 yr (range 3. 5 - 10. 4) of tube insertion. The incidence of buried bumper increased significantly with increasing PEG tube time (P < 0. 01). Gastro-oesophageal reflux disease (GORD) led to Nissen fundoplication in 45 (25. 3 %) patients. The proportion of patients receiving a fundoplication remained about 20 % over time but the time lapse between the 2 procedures decreased significantly. Conclusion : The development of buried bumper is associated to prolonged PEG tube use. In case of important GORD laparoscopic Nissen procedure and PEG placement can be performed simultaneously without increasing complication rate...|$|E
