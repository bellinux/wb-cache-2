50|$|<b>Hydrometeor</b> loading is the {{induced drag}} {{effects on the}} {{atmosphere}} from a falling <b>hydrometeor.</b> When falling at terminal velocity, {{the value of this}} drag is equal to grh, where g is the acceleration due to gravity and rh is the mixing ratio of the hydrometeors. <b>Hydrometeor</b> loading has a net-negative effect on the atmospheric buoyancy equations. As the <b>hydrometeor</b> falls toward the surface, the surrounding air provides resistance against the acceleration due to gravity, and the air {{in the vicinity of the}} <b>hydrometeor</b> becomes denser. The increased weight of the atmosphere can support a present downdraft or even cause a downdraft to occur. <b>Hydrometeor</b> loading can also lead to increased high pressure inside of a mesohigh in a thunderstorm.|$|E
50|$|An {{additional}} {{source of}} increased pressure is <b>hydrometeor</b> loading, {{the weight of}} precipitation increasing {{the speed of the}} downdraft, leading to increased pressure as the air converges at the surface. While <b>hydrometeor</b> loading is not a main contributor of increased pressure to the mesohigh, and it is a non-hydrostatic process, it can increase the pressure as much as 2 mb.|$|E
50|$|The {{definition}} of Z above {{shows that a}} large number of small hydrometeors will reflect as one large <b>hydrometeor.</b> The signal returned to the radar will be equivalent in both situations, so a group of small hydrometeors is virtually indistinguishable from one large <b>hydrometeor</b> on the resulting radar image. The reflectivity image is just one type of image produced by a radar. Using it alone a meteorologist could not tell with certainty the type of precipitation and distinguish any artifacts affecting the radar return.|$|E

40|$|A {{numerical}} algorithm {{based on}} Eddington's second approximation to {{the equation of}} radiative transfer has been developed in order to compute the radiances with horizontal and vertical polarization that emerge from precipitating clouds. This algorithm yields a rapid solution to problems pertaining to clouds with vertically inhomogeneous structure. Precipitating clouds containing liquid, mixtures of phases, and ice <b>hydrometeors</b> are modelled. It is shown that the lower-frequency radiances are sensitive to liquid precipitation at low altitudes while the higher-frequency radiances are {{more sensitive to the}} ice <b>hydrometeors</b> at the cloud tops. The extinction coefficients of aspherical <b>hydrometeors</b> are presented as a function of rainfall rates. The fact that vertically polarized radiances are warmer than horizontally polarized ones at high rainfall rates, with the difference diminishing at lower frequencies, is due to aspherical ice <b>hydrometeors</b> in the upper regions of precipitating clouds...|$|R
50|$|The Doppler width, or Doppler {{spectrum}} width, is {{the standard}} deviation of the spectrum. Accordingly, small values stand for narrow spectra, while higher spectrum width corresponds to a bigger spreading of the hydrometeors over the velocity domain (frequency domain). Reasons for a higher width could be bi- or multiple-modal spectra. This means that the measured volume contains more than one <b>hydrometeor</b> population, which leads to two or more modes in the Doppler spectrum because of the different terminal velocities. A rapid change in Doppler width {{in combination with the}} mean Doppler velocity {{can also be used to}} separate two <b>hydrometeor</b> population.|$|E
50|$|A concept used in {{precipitation}} measurement is the <b>hydrometeor.</b> Bits {{of liquid}} or solid {{water in the}} atmosphere are known as hydrometeors. Formations due to condensation, such as clouds, haze, fog, and mist, are composed of hydrometeors. All precipitation types {{are made up of}} hydrometeors by definition, including virga, which is precipitation which evaporates before reaching the ground. Particles blown from the Earth's surface by wind, such as blowing snow and blowing sea spray, are also hydrometeors.|$|E
5000|$|As {{the cloud}} radars sample the atmosphere, they measure the {{backscatter}} signal produced by different <b>hydrometeor</b> types (cloud droplets, drizzle, rain drops, ice particles, snow, etc.) and non-hydrometeorological targets.

[11] used a semi-supervised {{approach}} {{to realize the}} classification of <b>hydrometeors.</b> In this study, the K-medoids (KM) approach is used to cluster the sample data and the clustering results are evaluated by the Kolmogorov-Smirnov (KS) test method. Finally, the fuzzy logic algorithm is applied to realize the highly precise classification of <b>hydrometeors</b> based on the clustering results [11].|$|R
5000|$|Assessing the {{formation}} and stability of snowpacks {{is important in the}} study and prediction of avalanches. [...] Scientists study the physical properties of snow under different conditions and their evolution, and more specifically snow metamorphism, snow hydrology (that is, the contribution of snow melt to catchment hydrology), the evolution of snow cover with climate change and its effect on the ice-albedo feedback and hydrology, both on the ground and by using remote sensing. Snow is also studied in a more global context of impact on animal habitats and plant succession. An important effort is put into snow classification, both as an <b>hydrometeor</b> and on the ground.|$|E
5000|$|Cooling due to <b>hydrometeor</b> fallout is {{a second}} {{proposed}} formation mechanism. As hydrometeors fall into the dry sub-cloud air, the air containing the precipitation cools due to evaporation or sublimation. Being now cooler than the environmental air and unstable, they descend until in static equilibrium, at which point a restoring force curves {{the edges of the}} fallout back up, creating the lobed appearance. One problem with this theory is that observations show that cloud-base evaporation does not always produce mammatus. This mechanism could be responsible for the earliest stage of development, but other processes (namely process 1, above) may come into play as the lobes are formed and mature.|$|E
5000|$|The above {{processes}} specifically {{relied on}} the destabilization of the sub-cloud layer due to adiabatic or latent heating effects. Discounting the thermodynamical effects of <b>hydrometeor</b> fallout, another mechanism proposes that dynamics of the fallout alone are enough to create the lobes. Inhomogeneities in the masses of the hydrometeors along the cloud-base may cause inhomogeneous descent along the base. Frictional drag and associated eddy-like structures create the lobed appearance of the fallout. The main shortcoming of this theory is that vertical velocities in the lobes have been observed to be greater than the fall speeds of the hydrometeors within them; thus, {{there should be a}} dynamical downward forcing, as well.|$|E

30|$|When {{planning}} FSO systems, {{a pragmatic}} approach is usually adopted {{to estimate the}} availability performance from the link parameters. Attenuation statistics are then derived from the local statistics of atmospheric visibility {{using some of the}} standard models available [3 – 7]. However, the different influence of different types of <b>hydrometeors</b> is not taken into account in this approach since the atmospheric visibility is measured during the occurrence of all types of <b>hydrometeors</b> but the pertinent models were only derived for specific atmospheric conditions like fog or even only for more specific types of fog [5, 6]. As will be demonstrated in this paper, the pragmatic approach, despite the advantage of its simplicity, cannot avoid inherent inaccuracy due to the different influences of different <b>hydrometeors.</b>|$|R
5000|$|The anvil of a {{cumulonimbus}} cloud gradually subsides as {{it spreads}} out from its source cloud. As air descends, it warms. However, the cloudy air will warm more slowly (at the moist adiabatic lapse rate) than the sub-cloud, dry air (at the dry adiabatic lapse rate). Because of the differential warming, the cloud/sub-cloud layer destabilizes and convective overturning can occur, creating a lumpy cloud-base. The {{problems with this}} theory are that there are observations of mammatus lobes that {{do not support the}} presence of strong subsidence in the lobes, and {{that it is difficult to}} separate the processes of <b>hydrometeor</b> fallout and cloud-base subsidence, thus rendering it unclear as to whether either process is occurring.|$|E
40|$|A {{procedure}} for the retrieval of <b>hydrometeor</b> latent heating from TRMM active and passive observations is presented. The procedure {{is based on}} current methods for estimating multiple-species <b>hydrometeor</b> profiles from TRMM observations. The species include: cloud water, cloud ice, rain, and graupel (or snow). A three-dimensional wind field is prescribed based on the retrieved <b>hydrometeor</b> profiles, and, assuming a steady-state, the sources and sinks in the <b>hydrometeor</b> conservation equations are determined. Then, the momentum and thermodynamic equations, in which the heating and cooling are derived from the <b>hydrometeor</b> sources and sinks, are integrated one step forward in time. The <b>hydrometeor</b> sources and sinks are reevaluated based on the new wind field, and the momentum and thermodynamic equations are integrated one more step. The reevalution-integration process is repeated until a steady state is reached. The procedure is tested using cloud model simulations. Cloud-model derived fields are used to synthesize TRMM observations, from which <b>hydrometeor</b> profiles are derived. The procedure {{is applied to the}} retrieved <b>hydrometeor</b> profiles, and the latent heating estimates are compared to the actual latent heating produced by the cloud model. Examples of procedure's applications to real TRMM data are also provided...|$|E
30|$|Wet {{scavenging}} (i.e., impaction of {{aerosol particles}} by <b>hydrometeor</b> particles) does not only cause {{a significant decrease}} in aerosol concentration but also triggers several cloud microphysical processes, such as contact or immersion freezing. The scavenging process is divided into two types: dissolution or impaction {{as a result of the}} nucleation process through condensation or deposition of water vapor on aerosol particles, and impaction through collision between aerosol particles and already extant <b>hydrometeor</b> particles. As highlighted in the section about contact freezing, Brownian diffusion, thermophoresis, diffusiophoresis, electrophoresis, and/or inertial impaction are major causes of collisions between aerosol and <b>hydrometeor</b> particles. There are significant uncertainties associated with modeling these effects, especially as regards the electromagnetic attraction between aerosol and <b>hydrometeor</b> particles, because of insufficient theoretical knowledge and measurement data. In addition, tracing solutions and impurity components in <b>hydrometeor</b> particles is technically difficult if only limited computational resources are available. At present, a few models explicitly predict solution and impurity components in <b>hydrometeor</b> particles in their SBM frameworks (e.g., Chen and Lamb 1994). As an alternative approach, solution and impurity components are assumed to be statistically (Poissonian) distributed according to the volume of a <b>hydrometeor</b> particle when the total mass of the components scavenged by <b>hydrometeor</b> particles is predicted (Phillips et al. 2008). Although these authors applied this approach to their parametrization for immersion freezing, the same approach is applicable to the calculation of aerosol particle emission from evaporated <b>hydrometeor</b> particles.|$|E
40|$|Global {{precipitation}} measurements from space-based radars {{and microwave}} radiometers {{have been the}} subject of numerous studies during the past decade. Rainfall retrievals over land from spaceborne microwave radiometers depend mainly on scattering from frozen <b>hydrometeors.</b> Unfortunately, the relationship between frozen <b>hydrometeors</b> and rainfall varies considerably. The large field of view and related beam filling of microwave radiometer footprints introduce additional difficulties. Some of these problems will be addressed by the improved sensors that will be placed on the Global Precipitation Measurement (GPM) core satellite. Two shuttle missions demonstrated that X-band synthetic aperture radar (X-SAR) could observe rainfall over land. Several X-band SARs that can provide such measurements will be launched in the coming decade. These include four Constellation of Small Satellites for Mediterranean Basin Observations (COSMO-SkyMed), two TerraSAR-X, and a fifth Korea Multipurpose Satellite (KOMPSAT- 5) to be launched by the Italian, German, and Korean Space Agencies, respectively. Data from these satellites could augment the information available to the GPM science community. The present study presents computations of normalized radar cross sections (NRCS) that employed a simple, idealized two-layer cloud model that contained both rain and frozen <b>hydrometeors.</b> The modeled spatial distributions of these <b>hydrometeors</b> varied with height and horizontal distance. An exploratory algorithm was developed to retrieve the shape, width, and simple representations of the vertical profiles of frozen <b>hydrometeors</b> and rain from modeled NRCS scans.

In situ measurements gathered by {{a suite of}} probes on an armored T- 28 aircraft and radar data from both the prototype dual-polarimetric WSR- 88 D in Norman, Oklahoma (KOUN) {{as well as the}} CSU-CHILL dual-polarimetric radar were obtained from with-in thunderstorms. Radar volumes co-located with the positions of the aircraft were found and the polarimetric va-riables from these volumes extracted and compared with <b>hydrometeor</b> images from the T- 28 imaging probes. It was found that Zh, Zdr, and ρhv show the most promise in distinguishing between <b>hydrometeor</b> classes.

The employed supervised algorithm is a support vector machine (SVM), trained over 60 s precipitation time steps labeled by visual inspection. In this way, eight dominant <b>hydrometeor</b> classes can be discriminated.

The prototypes are then grouped together to produce a PDF for each <b>hydrometeor</b> type, which is modeled as a Gaussian mixture. The cluster-based method is applied to polarimetric radar data collected with the CP- 2 S-band radar near Brisbane, Queensland, Australia. The results are illustrated and compared with theoretical classification boundaries in the literature. Some notable differences are found. Automated <b>hydrometeor</b> classification algorithms can be built using the PDFs of polarimetric variables associated with each <b>hydrometeor</b> type presented in this paper...|$|E

As mentioned above in Section 4.1, the measurement of visibility at meteorological stations and airports do not differentiate among lower visibility due to fog-only events, due to individual <b>hydrometeors,</b> and due to all the <b>hydrometeors</b> combined. In spite of this, it follows from Figure 12 that this visibility data can be used for attenuation calculations by common methods.|$|R
