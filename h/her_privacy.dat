5|$|However, the King did {{not want}} the house himself, and he offered it to his heir-apparent, Beatrice's nephew George, who declined, objecting to the high cost of maintenance. Edward {{subsequently}} extended the grounds of Beatrice's home, Osborne Cottage, to compensate her for the impending loss of <b>her</b> <b>privacy.</b> Shortly afterwards, the King declared to Arthur Balfour, the Prime Minister, that the main house would go to the nation as a gift. An exception was made for the private apartments, which were closed to all but the royal family members, who made it a shrine to their mother's memory.|$|E
5|$|During {{his second}} term as {{representative}} from San Augustine, Houston was elected in 1841 to once again serve as the Republic's president. Margaret disliked campaign events and, giving up <b>her</b> <b>privacy,</b> frequently staying home while her husband traveled about the Republic canvassing for votes. Yet, when she rose to the occasion, such as the extended post-election tour of San Augustine County and victory celebrations in Washington County and Houston City, the public adored her, and she became an impressive political asset. She rode in a local presidential parade, but stayed home rather than travel to the inauguration in Austin. When the couple appeared at several events in Nacogdoches, his old friends took notice of his total avoidance of alcohol, and he continued to assure {{her that he was}} giving it up completely. He also began to clean up his language to please his new wife, and would eventually claim to have eliminated his profanity altogether.|$|E

Through the years Sonya chose {{to stay away from}} the media and keep <b>her</b> <b>privacy</b> and the privacy of her family, despite her husband's extensive political career. Sonya Peres was unable to attend Shimon's 2007 presidential inauguration ceremony because of ill health. With the election of Peres for president, Sonya Peres, who had not wanted her husband to accept the position, announced that she would stay in the couple's apartment in Tel Aviv and not join her husband in Jerusalem.

[...] Scheduled for release in November 2001, St. Martin's Press added that about 500,000 copies of the first print were ordered, and Morton received a six figure undisclosed amount as advance for writing the book. Madonna {{had always wanted to}} protect <b>her</b> <b>privacy</b> and reports had initially suggested that she was furious that Morton had decided to write the book, and commanded her friends and relatives not to give any interview to him. She added, [...] "I don't want anyone talking to that snivelling little worm. How dare he invade my privacy?" ...|$|E
500|$|This {{book is a}} {{successor}} to An Omelette and a Glass of Wine, consisting, like its predecessor, of magazine articles, essays and other earlier writings. When selecting the material for the earlier book, David and Jill Norman, who assisted her, found too many articles {{to fit into a}} single volume, and many were filed away for a sequel. After David's death, Norman supplemented them with articles written by David in the 1980s. The first section of the book is a short autobiographical piece, a rarity from David, who guarded <b>her</b> <b>privacy</b> carefully. David's interest in the historical aspects of cuisine is given scope in essays on the history of Oxo and Bovril, Alexis Soyer and the potato. Articles aimed at the domestic cook include [...] "Do not Despair over Rice", [...] "Making Ice Cream", and one propounding a view for which she was famous: [...] "Garlic Presses are Utterly Useless".|$|E
500|$|David had {{intended}} to publish a second such volume, and eight years after the author's death, Norman, her literary executor, published a sequel, Is There a Nutmeg in the House? (2000). Like its predecessor, it was drawn from magazine articles, essays and other earlier writings, to which Norman added articles written by David in the 1980s. The first section {{of the book is}} a short autobiographical piece, a rarity from David, who guarded <b>her</b> <b>privacy</b> carefully.

[...] Burns joined Press for Change in 1993, but only made her transsexual background public in 1995.

5000|$|Dinoire died {{of cancer}} at a French {{hospital}} in April 2016. Her death was not announced until September 2016 to give <b>her</b> family <b>privacy,</b> according to hospital officials. According to newspaper Le Figaro, Dinoire's body had rejected the transplant in 2015 [...] "and she had lost part {{of the use of}} her lips." [...] The daily immunosuppressive drugs she was required to take left her vulnerable to cancer. Two cancers had developed, the paper said.|$|R
500|$|In April 2002, Hewson {{was one of}} {{the leaders}} of an effort which {{delivered}} over a million postcards demanding that the facility be shut down; recipients included British Prime Minister Tony Blair, Prince Charles, and Norman Askew, head of British Nuclear Fuels Limited. (The message to the first said, [...] "Tony, look me in the eye and tell me I'm safe.") She personally delivered a giant postcard to Blair at 10Downing Street. The Shut Sellafield Campaign had its postcards stocked in Superquinn and Dunnes Stores supermarkets, and Hewson publicly engaged Tesco when they refused to do the same. The campaign was backed by celebrities, including Ronan Keating and Samantha Mumba, and Hewson made many newspaper and radio appearances on its behalf. It was the first prolonged exposure Hewson had to the public eye, after two decades of mostly being focused upon maintaining <b>her</b> <b>privacy.</b> Her continued activism also meant that she too would not always be around for the couple's children.|$|E
500|$|On another occasion, {{when she}} visited Bermuda, she {{was invited to}} a {{reception}} and chose to walk rather than be driven. She became thirsty along the way and stopped at a house, where she asked a black woman named Mrs McCarthy {{for a glass of}} water. Owing to the scarcity of water, the woman had to go some distance to obtain it, but was reluctant because she had to finish her ironing. When Louise offered to continue the ironing, the woman refused, adding that she was in a great hurry to finish so that she could go and see Princess Louise. Realising that she had not been recognised, Louise enquired whether McCarthy would recognise her again. When the woman said that she would have thought so, but was admittedly unsure, Louise replied: [...] "Well {{take a good look at}} me now, so you can be sure to know me tomorrow at St. Georges." [...] The Princess clung to <b>her</b> <b>privacy,</b> and enjoyed not being recognised.|$|E
500|$|The song's lyrics, {{written by}} Cyrus, Antonina Armato, Tim James and Devrim Karaoglu, have been mistakenly {{interpreted}} {{in a variety}} of ways. The song's protagonist sings in first person perspective while condemning an unspecified subject for wanting to invade <b>her</b> <b>privacy.</b> The majority of reviewers thought the protagonist was referring to a [...] "controlling boyfriend". Ben Ratliff of The New York Times sided with the boyfriend, and believed the song's protagonist was [...] "bullying some poor boy for the sin of wanting to know what she talks about with her friends." [...] Sarah Rodman of The Boston Globe believed the song could have described a number of subjects, such as [...] "a former boyfriend, the media, and even her fans." [...] However, in an interview with Jocelyn Vena of MTV News, Cyrus said the song was about [...] "the media" [...] and [...] "how they think they know everything about , when they don't.

500|$|Lyrically, [...] "Miles Away" [...] {{deals with}} a {{relationship}} in trouble.

5000|$|The Roman Empress Helena of Constantinople who {{temporarily}} {{resided in}} nearby Sebastia used {{to swim in}} the lake in Ijinsinya with her maids.

500|$|... "Lithium" [...] is a slow-tempo rock song; {{the protagonist}} sings about {{the fear of}} lithium in a lower {{register}} while [...] "embrac feeling over numbness". Lee originally wrote its chorus on a guitar when she was 16 years old, but the instrument was later changed to piano when the verses were written. The song is about the choice between the comfort of sorrow {{and the possibility of}} happiness, and shows the protagonist's sadness as an excuse to make music. Critics noted similarities between the [...] "tinkling" [...] piano introduction and the band's previous material, particularly [...] "My Immortal" [...] (2003). MTV News' Chris Harris compared [...] "Lithium" [...] with the songs of Tori Amos. Rolling Stones Rob Sheffield said the song was Lee's ode to Kurt Cobain and Nirvana's song of the same name. [...] "Cloud Nine" [...] was inspired by a break-up. It uses strings, studio effects and Lee's [...] "layered moaning". [...] "Snow White Queen", the first song written for The Open Door, was inspired by Lee's experiences of stalkers. According to Lee's experience, <b>her</b> <b>privacy</b> had been invaded to the point that she could not stay in her house. Entertainment Weeklys Jon Dolan found similarities between the song and Tori Amos [...] "Me and a Gun". Musically, it uses several industrial beats in its composition.|$|E
500|$|As Giuliani mulled {{over his}} medical options, on May 1 Hanover {{announced}} that she was postponing her appearance in The Vagina Monologues due to [...] "personal family circumstances." [...] On May 2 the New York Daily News published a brief item about Giuliani's other woman, without name or description. [...] On May 3 the New York Post finally published its photographs of Giuliani and the woman, now identified as Judith Nathan, leaving a restaurant together, under the front page headline [...] "Rudy's Mystery Brunch Pal is Upper East Side Divorcée". [...] (Some observers felt that Giuliani, known {{for his ability to}} manipulate the New York media, had been eager for news of the relationship to come out.) [...] Later that day, Giuliani responded to a barrage of questions on the subject at a news conference by acknowledging Judith Nathan publicly for the first time, calling her [...] "a very good friend" [...] and expressing his annoyance that <b>her</b> <b>privacy</b> was being invaded. [...] The next days were filled with New York media coverage on Nathan's background and on the relationship. [...] On May 6 Hanover held an unusually-located news conference at the back of St. Patrick's Cathedral before the funeral of Cardinal John O'Connor; visibly trembling, she said, [...] "I will be supportive of Rudy in his fight against his illness, as this marriage and this man have been very precious to me." [...] The following day half the press tried to stake out Nathan's known locations while the rest pestered Nathan's hometown relatives in Hazleton, Pennsylvania; Giuliani looked weak in a public appearance.|$|E
2500|$|In {{the autumn}} of 1845, Charlotte {{discovered}} the notebooks and insisted that the poems be published. Emily, furious at the invasion of <b>her</b> <b>privacy,</b> at first refused, but relented when Anne brought out her own manuscripts and revealed to Charlotte {{that she had been}} writing poems in secret as well. As co-authors of Gondal stories, Anne and Emily were accustomed to read their Gondal stories and poems to each other, while Charlotte was excluded from their privacy. Around this time she had written one of her most famous poems [...] "No coward soul is mine", probably as an answer to the violation of <b>her</b> <b>privacy</b> and her own transformation into a published writer. Despite Charlotte's later claim, it was not her last poem.|$|E

In fact, she was found to have slipped through a hole in the hay-mow into the nest of a very domestic sitting-hen, whose clamors at the invasion of <b>her</b> family <b>privacy</b> added no little to the general confusion.|$|R
50|$|It was {{implied in}} the fourth season that <b>her</b> intense <b>privacy,</b> {{combined}} with <b>her</b> toughness and style change to masculine clothing, had led to some speculation {{that she might be}} a lesbian; upon seeing Kay with a mystery date, Det John Munch said as much, although this may have just been a tactic to get her to tell him who the man is. The DVD commentaries for the show reveal that the producers were aware that the character was extremely popular in the LGBT community.|$|R
