50|$|In 2006 the Dutch <b>Equal</b> <b>Treatment</b> <b>Commission</b> got 694 {{requests}} to judge if a treatment legislation law had been broken. By {{far the most}} cases concerned age discrimination (219), race discrimination followed (105) and lesser number of sex discrimination cases. The Dutch <b>Equal</b> <b>Treatment</b> <b>Commission</b> brought out 261 judgements; 46 per cent of the cases were declared discrimination. In the early 2012 the Dutch Right-wing Party for Freedom established an anti-Slavic (predominantly anti-Polish) and anti-Romani website, where native Dutch people could air their frustration about losing their job because of cheaper workers from Poland, Bulgaria, Romania and other non-Germanic Central and Eastern European countries. This led to commentaries involving hate speech and other racial prejudice mainly against Poles and Roma, but also aimed at other Central and Eastern European ethnic groups.|$|E
40|$|The {{focus on}} basic {{tensions}} or conflicts between basic rights may be easily misunderstood. Tensions or conflicts between rights are, indeed, normative tensions {{but not of}} the kind of „normativity‟ characteristic for moral philosophy. Quite to the contrary, these are tensions inherent in empirical norms (i. e. norms claiming legal validity) both in International Covenants of Civil and Political Rights or the ECHR as well as in (Constitutional) Law of Member States, whether we call these constitutions „liberal democratic‟ or „constitutional democracy‟ or not. In this „socio-legal‟ part of RELIGARE, we are interested in the empirical way in which Courts and <b>Equal</b> <b>Treatment</b> <b>Commissions</b> practically deal with them, how they argue for - often widely diverging - balancing and weighing in judging cases in specific contexts and circumstances - and whether and, if so how these processes are influenced by deeper, implicit cultural biases...|$|R

40|$|It {{is clear}} from the {{proliferation}} of cases and complaints challenging programmatic disparities in school and college athletic programs that Title IX’s goal of <b>equal</b> <b>treatment</b> has not been fully realized. As the scholarship addressing <b>equal</b> <b>treatment</b> in athletics has been minimal, this Article is an effort to add to this scholarship in order to provide a greater understanding of <b>equal</b> <b>treatment</b> provisions. It examines why many school officials administer athletic departments in apparent oblivion to Title IX’s <b>equal</b> <b>treatment</b> mandate. The Article provides the history of Title IX’s <b>equal</b> <b>treatment</b> provisions and their enforcement at the high school and collegiate levels since the 1970 s. Trends in the types of <b>equal</b> <b>treatment</b> violations and the success of both public and private enforcement are also discussed. The Author analyzes why the <b>equal</b> <b>treatment</b> mandate remains largely absent from the public discourse about Title IX through a discussion of the political philosophy and climate in the United States, constructions of masculinity, and the role of amateurism in sport. She also offers recommendations to address the relative invisibility of Title IX’s <b>equal</b> <b>treatment</b> mandate with the goal of facilitating greater enforcement of <b>equal</b> <b>treatment</b> provisions and improving the overall equality of athletics...|$|R

40|$|In this article, I {{examine how}} {{ordinary}} citizens and legal professionals in The Netherlands understand non-discrimination law, using the theoretical framework of legal consciousness. In 2006, the Dutch <b>Equal</b> <b>Treatment</b> <b>Commission</b> {{ruled that a}} school was wrong to suspend a female Muslim teacher who, for religious reasons, refused {{to shake hands with}} men. This ruling provoked a wave of controversy. This article examines to what extent these critical reactions were indicative of the overall level of public support for the Dutch Equal Treatment Act. I first provide a brief summary of Dutch non-discrimination law. Next, following recent critiques in the literature, I introduce three modifications to the original legal consciousness framework. People's understandings of legal equality are then examined using data from a large-scale multi-method study, which included an online survey, case-studies and in-depth interviews. Moreover, I provide a brief reconstruction of the handshake case. I argue that the controversy in this case was not an isolated incident, but an important illustration of how non-discrimination law matters - or fails to matter - in The Netherlands...|$|E
40|$|The <b>Equal</b> <b>Treatment</b> <b>Commission</b> in the Netherlands, {{which was}} {{established}} in 1994, is a quasi-judicial body which can, {{among a number of}} other competences, issue opinions as to whether discrimination has taken place. Any individual who thinks they have been discriminated against can file a complaint with the Commission. Following a background sketch of the Commission’s history, composition and mandate, the procedure for dealing with a request from an individual is described, from the initial contact to the formal opinion of the Commission. The Commission was expressly set up to be easily accessible for victims of discrimination and to provide them with a cost-free, simple and quick way to settle discrimination complaints. This article assesses whether these aims are being achieved and whether the procedure is generally satisfactory for victims of discrimination and can be seen as an example of good practice for other countries. Attention will also be given to the imminent establishment of the Netherlands National Human Rights Institute because the present Commission will become part of this Institute...|$|E

40|$|Original title: Discriminatiemonitor niet-westerse allochtonen op de arbeidsmarkt 2007. Members of non-Western ethnic {{minorities}} {{are in a}} disadvantaged position on the Dutch labour market compared with the indigenous population. They are more at risk of unemployment and are more frequently dependent on temporary work. How big a role does discrimination play here? Are members of ethnic minority groups systematically turned down more often for (permanent) jobs?

Based on a literature survey, information from opinion polls and population surveys, opinions from the Dutch <b>Equal</b> <b>Treatment</b> <b>Commission,</b> an inventory of complaints registered with antidiscrimination bureaus and interviews with various groups of non-Western ethnic minorities, this study attempts to ascertain {{the nature and extent of}} labour discrimination in the Netherlands.

40|$|Purpose – Equal {{treatment}} in the workplace {{is considered one of}} the most fundamental rights of employees. This right also implies that employees must be able to address any form of unequal treatment freely and effectively, without fear of retaliation. The purpose of this paper is to investigate the prevalence of retaliation against complaints of unequal {{treatment in}} The Netherlands and its underlying factors. Design/methodology/approach – This article is based on a telephone survey among employees who filed a formal complaint about unequal treatment at work to the Dutch <b>Equal</b> <b>Treatment</b> <b>Commission.</b> Findings – The main finding is that retaliation against equal treatment reports is commonplace in The Netherlands and in many cases takes on serious forms. Furthermore it is found that the nature and extent of retaliation are primarily explained by the circumstances in which unequal treatment develops and that the extent of retaliation is neither explained by the manner in which unequal treatment is addressed nor by the level of institutionalized protection that is available. Originality/value – The need for a better understanding of retaliation is high, because retaliation and fear of retaliation have broad consequences for the psychological and physical well-being of individual employees and for employment relationships. Yet, studies on retaliation in the context of employment discrimination are rare, especially outside the USA. This article contributes to a better understanding of retaliation, which may be used by policy makers, employees and employers to address it more effectivel...|$|E

The {{existence}} of discrimination, harassment and offensive behavior should according to Swedish school law not exist in the school environment. Since the year 2006, when a law on <b>equal</b> <b>treatment</b> was passed, all the schools in Sweden must have a treatment plan that is revised annually to prevent discrimination, harassment and abusive treatment. In this master thesis, I will examine the <b>equal</b> <b>treatment</b> plan between four different elementary schools in Nynäshamn. The {{purpose of this paper is}} to examine how the <b>equal</b> <b>treatment</b> plan exposes the bullying and the types of problems and solutions addressed in the elementary schools <b>equal</b> <b>treatment</b> plans.

This thesis is based on text analysis and content analysis on the schools <b>equal</b> <b>treatment</b> plans. The study is based on the theories from a norm critical perspective.

40|$|<b>Equal</b> <b>treatment</b> of {{shareholders}} {{is regulated}} in Art. 269 of Company Act (2011) of Republic of Serbia. <b>Equal</b> <b>treatment</b> of shareholders {{means that all}} shareholders are to be treated equally under same circumstances. Obligation to treat all shareholders equally rests on all company bodies, predominantly general meeting. The standard whether an action violates the principle of <b>equal</b> <b>treatment</b> of all shareholders regarding the main rights of shareholders (such as voting right etc.) is the nominal value of shares, or the <b>equal</b> <b>treatment</b> per person regarding ancillary rights (such as right to speak in shareholders' meeting etc.).

40|$|Drawing on {{his work}} in two {{previous}} articles, Christopher Peters contends that uncertainty about substantive moral norms cannot justify a presumption of <b>equal</b> <b>treatment.</b> Arguments for <b>equal</b> <b>treatment</b> {{in the face of}} uncertainty are types of consequentialist claims; they are not claims of what Peters calls prescriptive equality, that is, for treating likes alike merely because they are alike. Peters contends that the consequentialist case for <b>equal</b> <b>treatment</b> as a response to uncertainty fails in two respects. First, it fails to demonstrate that <b>equal</b> <b>treatment</b> {{is likely to be a}} more satisfactory response to moral uncertainty than unequal treatment. Second, it is logically incoherent because it simultaneously relies upon and denies the possibility of confidence in moral judgment. Peters concludes that no valid case can be made for defaulting to <b>equal</b> <b>treatment</b> in the face of moral uncertainty...|$|R
50|$|<b>Equal</b> <b>treatment</b> {{theory or}} formal equity often works {{in tandem with}} libertarianism in that <b>equal</b> <b>treatment</b> theorists believe governments should treat men and women {{similarly}} when their situations are similar. In countries whose governments have taken to legislation eliminating sex segregation, <b>equal</b> <b>treatment</b> theory is most frequently used as support for such rules and regulation. For example, <b>equal</b> <b>treatment</b> theory {{was adopted by the}} many feminists during the United States' feminist movement in the 1970s. This utilization of <b>equal</b> <b>treatment</b> theory led to the adoption of intermediate scrutiny as a standard for sex discrimination on the basis that men and women should be treated equally when in similar situations. While <b>equal</b> <b>treatment</b> theory provides a sound framework for equality, application is quite tricky, as many critics question the standards by which men and women should be treated similarly or differently. In this manner, libertarianism and <b>equal</b> <b>treatment</b> theory provide good foundations for their agendas in sex segregation, but conceptually do not prevent it, leaving room for mandatory and administrative sex segregation to remain as long as separation is based on celebrated differences between men and women. Some forms of mandatory and administrative segregation may perpetuate sex segregation by depicting a difference between male and female employees where there is no such difference, as in combat exclusion policies.|$|R
40|$|Can {{perceptions}} of <b>equal</b> <b>treatment</b> buffer {{the negative effects}} of threat on the school success of minority students? Focusing on minority adolescents from Turkish and Moroccan heritage in Belgium (M_age = 14. 5; N = 735 in 47 ethnically diverse schools), multilevel mediated moderation analyses showed: (1) Perceived discrimination at school predicted lower test performance; (2) Experimentally-manipulated stereotype threat decreased performance (mediated by increased disengagement); (3) Perceived <b>equal</b> <b>treatment</b> at school predicted higher performance (mediated by decreased disengagement); and (4) Personal and peer {{perceptions of}} <b>equal</b> <b>treatment</b> buffered negative effects of discrimination and stereotype threat. Thus,(situational) stereotype threat and perceived discrimination at school both undermine minority student success, whereas perceived <b>equal</b> <b>treatment</b> can provide a buffer against such threats...|$|R

The justifications for automatic unequal treatment put forward before, and accepted with alacrity by, the Court of Appeal, are poorly reasoned and ill-matched with the rules in question – most notably because Zambrano families may have strong connections with the UK.
