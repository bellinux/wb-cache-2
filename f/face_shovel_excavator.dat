40|$|Abstract. Excavators can {{be divided}} into two categories: {{hydraulic}} excavator and mechanical excavator. Due to the flexibility and mobility, hydraulic excavator has almost replaced the mechanical excavator. But there still exists some problems such as hydraulic leaks and high costs of manufacturing and maintaining. On the other hand, the latter one is the excavator of choice in oil sands digging and surface mining for its durability, high productivity and low ownership costs resulting from long economic operating life, but lacks flexibility due to the structural limitations. This paper introduces an innovative design of mechanical excavator with controllable mechanism based on functional analysis of the traditional hydraulic excavator. The solving model in the form of Function-Effect-Technical Action Process-Executive Action-Mechanism (F-E-P-A-M) is used. A planar 2 Degree-OF-Freedom (DOF) controllable mechanism is adopted as the executive mechanism. A backhoe type and a <b>face</b> <b>shovel</b> type <b>excavator</b> both with the ability to accomplish flexible output trajectories by the joint operations of three servo-motors are proposed...|$|R

50|$|A {{steam shovel}} {{is a large}} steam-powered {{excavating}} machine designed for lifting and moving material such as rock and soil. It is the earliest type of power <b>shovel</b> or <b>excavator.</b> They {{played a major role}} in public works in the 19th and early 20th century, being key to the construction of railroads and the Panama Canal. The development of simpler, cheaper diesel-powered shovels caused steam shovels to fall out of favor in the 1930s.|$|R

40|$|Approximately, 40 % of {{the total}} energy used in surface mines is related to diesel consumption. Truck haulage is {{responsible}} {{for a majority of}} this.

The chapter discusses factors that contribute to the energy-efficient operation of such equipment. Based on gross weight hauled per unit weight of payload, belt conveyors appear to be the most energy-efficient means of transporting material in surface mines.

5000|$|Though the {{original}} colliery closed, mining was practised until quite recently: {{as late as}} 1997, mining company The Banks Group opened up a 170 acre open-pit mine at Pegswood Moor, from which they extracted some 1.4 million tons of coal, {{with the help of}} a 236-ton <b>face</b> <b>shovel</b> made by Orenstein & Koppel. Also reaped was 84,000 tons of fire clay, a kind of high temperature resistant clay often found between coal layers. Mining there stopped in 2004, and the pit was converted into the Pegswood Community Park, which includes [...] "a dedicated nature reserve, a new woodland and ponds." [...] The second phase of the park's construction would also [...] "provide a fishing lake, an amphitheatre sculpted out of the landform and a footpath link from Pegswood to Morpeth." [...] Extensive open-pit mining still takes place in the area, but such operations remain controversial even when former sites are restored.|$|R
40|$|Aims: This study {{aimed to}} monitor the {{vibration}} levels of mining machinery and duration of exposure to vibration; to study work practices of operators of mining machineries and to predict health risk from vibration exposure to operators. Materials and Methods: Vibration levels of 157 mining equipment including dumpers, dozers, etc. in 10 opencast mines were measured through accelerometer and recorded in vibration analyzer. Root mean square (RMS) values of acceleration as well as vibration dose values along with duration of exposures per day were used to predict health risk in accordance with ISO 2631 - 1 : 1997 standard. Video records of equipment operation were used to analyze job components. Results: Health risk was evaluated using RMS acceleration (0. 21 - 1. 82 m/s 2) and corresponding daily durations of exposure (2 - 7. 5 h). Forty two (27 %) of the equipment showed minimal health risk, 83 (53 %) equipment showed moderate and 32 (20 %) equipment showed high health risk to operators. While <b>shovels</b> and <b>excavators</b> showed minimal health risk, dozers and dumpers showed high health risk potential. x-axis was the dominant axis of vibration for loaders and dozers, whereas {{for the majority of}} dumpers and tippers, z-axis was dominant. Conclusion: Dumpers require engineering control for reducing the vibration in z-axis while measures are required for x-axis in loaders or dozers. <b>Shovels</b> or <b>excavators</b> do not require immediate attention except regular monitoring. Improvement in work practices are required to safeguard the workers from vibration related illness. It is recommended that proper guidelines for measurement and control of vibration at workplace should be formulated...|$|R

40|$|The {{objective}} of this project {{was to develop a}} roadmap that identifies how ACARP expenditure on automation based research for surface coal mining should be invested to achieve maximum benefit for the Australian Coal Industry over the next 3 to 10 years. The roadmap developed is equipment focused and considers the following major equipment groups and their support systems: (i) dump trucks; (ii) <b>shovels,</b> <b>excavators</b> and wheel loaders; (iii) blast hole drills; (iv) dozers; and (v) draglines. For each piece of equipment the report identifies: scope for potential automation, the benefits sought from the introduction of automation, pathways and technology milestones needed to travel towards specific automation goals, the challenges associated with realizing milestones, and (v) interim benefits that might result from the reaching these milestones as precursors to full automation. The pathways to travel towards specific automation goals were identified by reviewing the attributes required of fully automated systems and juxtaposing these with the existing state of automation technologies. Wide consultation with researchers equipment manufacturers and mine site personnel was used to broadened the perspective of the study. The broad conclusion from the work is that at this point in time, ACARP investment towards automation should not focus on the full automation for any equipment types per se, but rather should seek definite progress steps that strategically enhance understanding of the requirements and capability for automation. Four areas are identified as offering the best opportunities for returns on ACARP research expenditure in the short-to-medium term while making progress towards the longer term {{objective of}} full automation. These areas are: Projects that develop and prove advanced sensing technologies in the mine environment. Projects that help evolve understanding of the requirements for mine-wide information systems and how these can be used to facilitate unit interactions. Projects that make use of existing sensors on unit operations equipment to deliver improved understanding of machine operation. Projects that improve understanding of trade-offs between equipment productivity and damage and/or predict failures, leading to the development of duty meters. These project types are cross referenced to identified technology milestones in the automation road map. Feedback obtained from a mine-site based focus group was obtained on the relevance of several of these the automation technology milestones to current operations...|$|R

40|$|The overall aim of {{this article}} is to outline the {{progress}} of the research on how to develop an economically and scientifically justified backhoe buckets boreholes renewal technology by using mobile on-site technological equipment. Today the new mobile (in-situ) repair technologies are extensively used for the specialized equipment and machinery repairs.

The bucket bores central axes are used as a reference base and damaged layer of material is removed mechanically applying turning operation. Subsequently the renewable surface is covered by new material layer by means of regular MIG/MAG welding. The last technological operation is final turning to the nominal diameter.
