5|$|In each of {{the cases}} above, the actual score is irrelevant; the {{projectiles}} simply have to hit the target sheet within the circles. Also in each case, the applicant is allowed 3 test shots to familiarize with the particular firearm used for the test. The shotgun <b>is</b> <b>an</b> <b>exception</b> to this, where only one round is allowed as a test shot.|$|E

However, lawrencium <b>is</b> <b>an</b> <b>exception,</b> since its last electron is transferred to the 7p1/2 subshell due to relativistic effects.|$|E
5|$|An error as to a jurisdictional, or precedent, fact <b>is</b> <b>an</b> <b>exception</b> to {{the general}} rule that the High Court does not judicially review errors of fact. Under the {{threefold}} classification of the broad grounds of judicial review set out in Council of Civil Service Unions v. Minister for the Civil Service ("the GCHQ case", 1983) – illegality, irrationality and procedural impropriety – an error as to a precedent fact may {{be regarded as a}} form of illegality.|$|E

5|$|Bayern <b>is</b> <b>an</b> <b>exception</b> in professional, {{international}} football, having generated {{profits in}} {{nine of the}} last ten seasons. Other clubs often report losses, realizing transfers via loans, whereas Bayern always uses current assets. Also Bayern differs from other European top clubs in their income composition. While other clubs derive more than 35% of their revenues from broadcasting right, Bayern earn only 22% of their revenues that way. This is often accounted for by Bayern not marketing their broadcasting right themselves. Instead the Deutsche Fußball Liga negotiates broadcasting rights for the whole Bundesliga.|$|E
5|$|Errors as to {{precedent}} facts, {{sometimes called}} jurisdictional facts, in Singapore administrative law are errors committed by public authorities concerning facts that must objectively exist or not exist before the authorities {{have the power}} to take actions or make decisions under legislation. If an error concerning a precedent fact is made, the statutory power has not been exercised lawfully and may be quashed by the High Court if judicial review is applied for by an aggrieved person. The willingness of the Court to review such errors of fact <b>is</b> <b>an</b> <b>exception</b> to the general rule that the Court only reviews errors of law.|$|E
5|$|In India, a 14th-century Indian text {{mentioning}} {{a lesbian}} couple {{who had a}} child {{as a result of}} their lovemaking <b>is</b> <b>an</b> <b>exception</b> to the general silence about female homosexuality. This invisibility disappeared with the release of a film titled Fire in 1996, prompting some theaters in India to be attacked by extremists. Terms used to label homosexuals are often rejected by Indian activists for being the result of imperialist influence, but most discourse on homosexuality centers on men. Women's rights groups in India continue to debate the legitimacy of including lesbian issues in their platforms, as lesbians and material focusing on female homosexuality are frequently suppressed.|$|E

5|$|Mercury dissolves {{many other}} metals such as {{gold and silver}} to form amalgams. Iron <b>is</b> <b>an</b> <b>exception,</b> and iron flasks have {{traditionally}} been used to trade mercury. Several other first row transition metals {{with the exception of}} manganese, copper and zinc are reluctant to form amalgams. Other elements that do not readily form amalgams with mercury include platinum. Sodium amalgam is a common reducing agent in organic synthesis, and is also used in high-pressure sodium lamps.|$|E
5|$|Most americium(III) halides form {{hexagonal}} crystals with slight {{variation of}} the color and exact structure between the halogens. So, chloride (AmCl3) is reddish and has a structure isotypic to uranium(III) chloride (space group P63/m) and the melting point of 715°C. The fluoride is isotypic to LaF3 (space group P63/mmc) and the iodide to BiI3 (space group R). The bromide <b>is</b> <b>an</b> <b>exception</b> with the orthorhombic PuBr3-type structure and space group Cmcm. Crystals of americium hexahydrate (AmCl3·6H2O) can be prepared by dissolving americium dioxide in hydrochloric acid and evaporating the liquid. Those crystals are hygroscopic and have yellow-reddish color and a monoclinic crystal structure.|$|E
5|$|The {{nucleus of}} the lithium atom verges on instability, since the two stable lithium {{isotopes}} found in nature have among the lowest binding energies per nucleon of all stable nuclides. Because of its relative nuclear instability, lithium is less common {{in the solar system}} than 25 of the first 32 chemical elements even though its nuclei are very light: it <b>is</b> <b>an</b> <b>exception</b> to the trend that heavier nuclei are less common. For related reasons, lithium has important uses in nuclear physics. The transmutation of lithium atoms to helium in 1932 was the first fully man-made nuclear reaction, and lithium deuteride serves as a fusion fuel in staged thermonuclear weapons.|$|E

5|$|Those {{who have}} {{bacteria}} in the urine but no symptoms should not generally be treated with antibiotics. This includes those who are old, those with spinal cord injuries, {{and those who have}} urinary catheters. Pregnancy <b>is</b> <b>an</b> <b>exception</b> and it is recommended that women take 7days of antibiotics. If not treated it causes up to 30% of mothers to develop pyelonephritis and increases risk of low birth weight and preterm birth. Some also support treatment of those with diabetes mellitus and treatment before urinary tract procedures which will likely cause bleeding.|$|E
5|$|Between 1996 and 1999, the {{administration}} added crucifixes to many classroom walls, {{a change that}} attracted national attention. Before 1996, crucifixes had hung only in hospital rooms and historic classrooms. Some of these crucifixes are historic works of art, and are noted as such. According to Imam Yahya Hendi, the school's on-campus Muslim cleric, pressure to remove the crucifixes comes from within the Catholic community, while he and other campus faith leaders have defended their placement. The Intercultural Center <b>is</b> <b>an</b> <b>exception</b> to this controversy, rotating displays of various faith and culture symbols in the lobby. In 2009, Georgetown's religious symbols were brought back to national attention after the university administration concealed the name of Jesus in preparation for President Barack Obama's speech on campus.|$|E
5|$|In {{uncomplicated}} cases, UTIs {{are treated}} with a short course of antibiotics such as nitrofurantoin or trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole. Resistance {{to many of the}} antibiotics used to treat this condition is increasing. In complicated cases, a longer course or intravenous antibiotics may be needed. If symptoms do not improve in two or three days, further diagnostic testing may be needed. Phenazopyridine may help with symptoms. In those who have bacteria or white blood cells in their urine but have no symptoms, antibiotics are generally not needed, although during pregnancy <b>is</b> <b>an</b> <b>exception.</b> In those with frequent infections, a short course of antibiotics may be taken as soon as symptoms begin or long-term antibiotics may be used as a preventative measure.|$|E

5|$|The Doddagaddavalli Lakshmi Devi ("Goddess of Wealth") Temple <b>is</b> <b>an</b> <b>exception</b> {{as it is}} {{dedicated}} to neither Vishnu nor Shiva. The defeat of the Jain Western Ganga Dynasty (of present-day south Karnataka) by the Cholas in the early 11th century and the rising numbers of followers of Vaishnava Hinduism and Virashaivism in the 12th century was mirrored by a decreased interest in Jainism. However, two notable locations of Jain worship in the Hoysala territory were Shravanabelagola and Kambadahalli. The Hoysalas built Jain temples to satisfy the needs of its Jain population, a few of which have survived in Halebidu containing icons of Jain tirthankaras. They constructed stepped wells called Pushkarni or Kalyani, the ornate tank at Hulikere being an example. The tank has twelve minor shrines containing Hindu deities.|$|E
5|$|The Puget Sound Convergence Zone is an {{important}} feature of Seattle's weather. In the convergence zone, air arriving from the north meets air flowing in from the south. Both streams of air originate over the Pacific Ocean; airflow is split by the Olympic Mountains to Seattle's west, then reunited to the east. When the air currents meet, they are forced upward, resulting in convection. Thunderstorms caused by this activity are usually weak and can occur {{north and south of}} town, but Seattle itself rarely receives more than occasional thunder and small hail showers. The Hanukkah Eve Wind Storm in December 2006 <b>is</b> <b>an</b> <b>exception</b> that brought heavy rain and winds gusting up to , an event that was not caused by the Puget Sound Convergence Zone and was widespread across the Pacific Northwest.|$|E
5|$|There is {{a general}} rule that a {{landlord}} who leases a property is not liable for nuisances created after the occupier takes control of the land. There <b>is</b> <b>an</b> <b>exception</b> where the lease is granted for a purpose which constitutes a nuisance, as in Tetley v Chitty, or where the nuisance is caused by their failure to repair the premises, as in Wringe v Cohen. The landlord is also liable were the nuisance existed before the land was let, and he knew or ought to have known about it. Under the principle of vicarious liability, an occupier of land can also be liable {{for the actions of}} their employees; in Matania v National Provincial Bank, it was also established that they could be liable for the activities of independent contractors under certain circumstances.|$|E

5|$|U.S. Routes {{that run}} north–south have odd numbers, {{increasing}} {{from east to}} west, while those that run east–west have even numbers, increasing from north to south. Major north–south U.S. Routes have numbers ending in 1 while major east–west U.S. Routes have numbers ending in 0. Three-digit U.S. Routes serve as branches of their parent route. As such, U.S. Route 13 (US 13) runs north–south through {{the entire length of}} Delaware while US 40, a major U.S. Route running from Utah to New Jersey, passes east–west through northern New Castle County. US 113 serves as a branch of US 13 {{in the southern part of}} the state. US 9 <b>is</b> <b>an</b> <b>exception</b> to the numbering pattern as it runs east–west across Sussex County, though the route runs north–south in New Jersey and New York.|$|E
5|$|Cerium is {{the second}} element of the {{lanthanide}} series. In the periodic table, it appears between the lanthanides lanthanum to its left and praseodymium to its right, and above the actinide thorium. It is a ductile metal with a hardness {{similar to that of}} silver. Its 58 electrons are arranged in the configuration 4f15d16s2, of which the four outer electrons are valence electrons. Immediately after lanthanum, the 4f orbitals suddenly contract and are lowered in energy {{to the point that they}} participate readily in chemical reactions; however, this effect is not yet strong enough at cerium and thus the 5d subshell is still occupied. Most lanthanides can use only three electrons as valence electrons, as afterwards the remaining 4f electrons are too strongly bound: cerium <b>is</b> <b>an</b> <b>exception</b> because of the stability of the empty f-shell in Ce4+ and the fact that it comes very early in the lanthanide series, where the nuclear charge is still low enough until neodymium to allow the removal of the fourth valence electron.|$|E
5|$|The Majin Tensei {{titles are}} {{strategy}} {{games in which}} the player takes {{the role of a}} human character who battles against demons. They navigate a field – seen in a top-down perspective in Majin Tensei and in a three-quarters perspective starting in Majin Tensei II – with characters represented by small, stick figure-like sprites, and switch to scenes with large, detailed characters when engaging in battle; in the first Majin Tensei, only the opponent is shown in battle scenes, while Majin Tensei II uses a split-screen presentation to show both sides. Ronde <b>is</b> <b>an</b> <b>exception,</b> and instead uses 3D graphics with a scrolling camera. On the field, the player can access pools that regenerate their energy, and starting in Majin Tensei II, they can use the terrain to gain an advantage in battles, increasing their defense rating. The player can also use items, which are bought using money they earn from battles. To attack enemies or support allies, the player needs to move their units on the field so that they are adjacent to the target of the action.|$|E
