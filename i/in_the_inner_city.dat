5|$|In 1913, {{at the age}} of five, Fingleton's {{father was}} elected into state {{parliament}} {{as a representative of the}} centre left, labour-union oriented Australian Labor Party, and the family moved into a larger house. It was here that Fingleton learned to play street cricket. Fingleton was educated at the Roman Catholic St Francis's School, <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>inner</b> <b>city</b> suburb of Paddington before moving to Waverley College. There he began a lifelong association with prose.|$|E

5|$|The Royal Library, {{belonging}} to the University of Copenhagen, is the largest library in the Nordic countries with an almost complete collection of all printed Danish books since 1482. Founded in 1648, the Royal Library is located at four sites in the city, the main one being on the Slotsholmen waterfront. Copenhagen's public library network has over 20 outlets, the largest being the Central Library (Københavns Hovedbibliotek) on Krystalgade <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>inner</b> <b>city.</b>|$|E
5|$|Archaeological {{evidence}} {{under the}} Aros settlement's defences indicate {{the site was}} a town {{as early as the}} last quarter of the 8thcentury, considerably earlier than had been generally supposed. Discoveries after a 2003 archaeological dig unearthed half-buried longhouses, firepits, glass pearls and a road dated to the late 700s. Archaeologists have conducted several excavations <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>inner</b> <b>city</b> since the 1960s revealing wells, streets, homes and workshops. In the buildings and adjoining archaeological layers, everyday utensils like combs, jewellery and basic multi-purpose tools from approximately the year 900 have been found.|$|E
5|$|In 1977-78, the West Australian Government, {{under the}} {{leadership}} of Charles Court, announced plans for a nuclear power reactor near Perth. 1977 was seen as the year of mass mobilization in WA, with 300 at the first anti-nuclear demonstration to 9,000 at the third protest <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>inner</b> <b>city</b> of Perth. Despite public protest, the WA Government selected a first site for a nuclear reactor in 1979 at Wilbinga, 70 kilometres north of Perth. Court predicted that at least another 20 nuclear power plants would be needed {{by the end of the}} century to meet rapidly growing power demand, but all of this never eventuated.|$|E
50|$|The {{houses were}} built <b>in</b> <b>the</b> suburbs, not <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>inner</b> <b>cities</b> where <b>the</b> slums were. This was <b>in</b> part because <b>the</b> cost of {{building}} <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>inner</b> <b>cities</b> was higher, and <b>in</b> part because <b>the</b> government believed that children were better raised in suburban sections {{rather than on the}} streets. The urban poor also were largely unable to afford the rents for the new state houses. The government favoured married couples with at least one child as tenants to encourage an increase <b>in</b> <b>the</b> birth rate. Māori were excluded, in part because they could not afford the rentals, but also because the government believed the races should be kept apart.|$|R

5|$|The tax {{increase}} was implemented {{not only to}} improve accessibility and the environment, but also to help develop the infrastructure. The additional funds will contribute to finance {{the extension of the}} Stockholm metro. As the Stockholm congestion tax varies by time of the day, the highest increase took place at the two busiest rush hour periods, 7:30 to 8:29, and 16:00 to 17:29, from SEK 20 to SEK 30. The objective was to steer the traffic towards other times of the day and public transport, and in this way reduce congestion <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Inner</b> <b>City</b> area. Also the maximum amount levied was raised to SEK 105 per day and vehicle.|$|E
5|$|The streets Volden (The Rampart) and Graven (The Moat) {{testify to}} the defences of the initial Viking {{settlement}} and Allégaderingen in Midtbyen roughly follows the boundaries of that settlement. The street network <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>inner</b> <b>city</b> formed during the Middle Ages with narrow, curved streets and low, dense housing by the river and coast. Vesterport (Westward Gate) still bears {{the name of a}} medieval city gate and the narrow alleyways Posthussmøgen and Telefonsmøgen are remnants of toll stations from that time. The inner city has the oldest preserved buildings, especially the Latin Quarter, with houses dating back to the early 17thcentury in Mejlgade and Skolegade. Medieval merchants' mansions with courtyards can be seen in Klostergade, Studsgade and Skolegade. By far, the largest part of the present day city was built during and after the industrialization of the late 1800s and the most represented architectural styles are historicism and modernism, especially Danish functionalism of which there are many fine examples.|$|E

50|$|In {{terms of}} location, poverty-stricken {{communities}} tend to reside <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>inner</b> <b>cities</b> while affluent communities tend to reside <b>in</b> <b>the</b> suburbs. <b>In</b> addition, better neighborhoods contain better educational services and {{easier access to}} various occupations. This spatial and economic segregation further perpetuates residential segregation. Across all minority groups, there is a residential gap based on income.

5000|$|<b>In</b> 1963 <b>the</b> FHA had {{approved}} federal home mortgage insurance exclusively for condominiums or for homes in subdivisions {{which had a}} qualifying homeowner association. The rationale was that developers wanted to get around density laws. The effect, however, was to divert investment from multi-family housing and home construction or renovation <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>inner</b> <b>cities.</b> This accelerated <b>the</b> middle-class exodus to the suburbs and into common-interest housing. The rapid expansion of federally subsidized highways under federal programs made access to new areas easy.|$|R
5000|$|To {{deal with}} {{economic}} stagnation <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>inner</b> <b>cities,</b> <b>the</b> Government introduced [...] "enterprise zones" [...] starting <b>in</b> 1981; <b>the</b> idea began <b>in</b> Britain and {{was adopted by}} the United States and some EU countries. It targeted designated small, economically depressed neighbourhoods and exempted them from some regulations and taxes. The goal was to attract private capital and new business activity that would bring jobs and progress to declining areas. Important projects included those in London Docklands, Salford and Gateshead.|$|R
