50|$|When only 28 years old, Mendenhall {{discovered}} the cell for Hodgkin’s {{disease and the}} evolution of the cells. Previously Hodgkin’s disease was considered a form of tuberculosis but her contribution (1901) established that it was a form of cancer, not infection. She tested the concept on rabbits by showing that Hodgkin’s disease was not transmissible unlike tuberculosis. Dorothy used microscopic specimens to compare tissue samples from TB and Hodgkin’s patients. It was then that she observed the large giant cells (The <b>Dorothy</b> <b>Reed</b> <b>Cell</b> later termed the Reed-Sternberg Cell). Since the giant cells were distinct in the characteristics it possessed, Hodgkin’s disease had a clear diagnostic marker. Having a way to clearly identify the condition allowed the development of effective treatment. Five-year survival of Hodgkin’s is about 80% vs about 40% for Non-Hodgkin’s Lymphoma.|$|E
40|$|A puzzling {{clinical}} picture which was first described by Hodgkin in 18321, {{and since then}} studied and clarified by many medical men and pathologists, has recently been {{recognized as one of}} the problems confront-ing the bone surgeons. The peculiar hypertrophy and metaplasia of the cervical, mediastinal, and other lymph glands was at first not differentiated from the enlargement of these glands in lymphosarcoma, tuberculosis, and the leucaemias. Later, cases presenting symptoms of intermittent fever, anaemia, and enlargement of the spleen and lymph glands, coupled with degeneration of the hemopoietic structures and appearance of <b>Dorothy</b> <b>Reed</b> <b>cells</b> and eosinophils, were grouped under the name lymphogranu-loma. This disease was variously thought to be due to a specific bacillus, the tubercle bacillus, or to a neoplasm. In the exhaustive investigation of cases, the osseous system was at first only casually examined. Hyperplasia and degeneration of the bone marrow and thinning of the cortex were noted as a part of the hemopoieti...|$|R

The young Thomas Mendenhall grew up in Madison, Wisconsin and went to Andover before graduating from Yale University in 1932. At Yale, he served on the business staff of campus humor magazine The Yale Record. Awarded a Rhodes Scholarship, he attended Balliol College, Oxford in 1935-36, earning a B.Litt. degree. While at Oxford, he was captain of the Balliol Boats. Mendenhall returned to Yale, where he wrote his doctoral dissertation on the Welsh wool trade in the 16th and 17th centuries, receiving his Ph.D. in history in 1938. As a graduate student, he rowed on the Berkeley College (Yale) intramural crew.|$|R

At {{the turn of}} the century, Dr. Holt was a major figure in pediatrics. He was a charter member of the American Pediatric Society and would be elected its president twice, an honor bestowed upon only one other doctor.

Following excretion, these substances may persist in the environment and impact non-target organisms.

40|$|Canine minute virus (CnMV) is {{a member}} of the Bocavirus genus, {{together}} with Bovine parvovirus (BPV), which emerged as new pathogen of dogs in 1967. The genus Bocavirus gained more recognition after the recent identification of Human bocavirus in pooled specimens from the respiratory tract of children. The cell culture host range of CnMV appears to be restricted to the Walter <b>Reed</b> canine <b>cell</b> (WRCC) line, although there is a report that indicates susceptibility of the Madin–Darby canine kidney (MDCK) cell line. In order to study the susceptibility of different cell lines to CnMV, the replication in cell cultures of canine-, bovine-, and human-origin, and the interaction of the virus with freshly isolated canine peripheral blood mononuclear cells, were evaluated. The in vitro host range was unexpectedly wide. As shown by indirect fluorescent antibody and polymerase chain reaction assays, CnMV replicates efficiently in the A 72 and MDCK canine cell lines. Bovine and human cell lines support the replication of CnMV less efficiently. In contrast, canine mononuclear blood cells are permissive to replication of CnMV in vitro.

40|$|Several species-specific {{molecular}} {{forms of}} acid phosphatase arc known {{to exist in}} the unicellular green alga Acetabularia. In graft combinations between cells of Acetabularia mediterranea (reed) and Acicularia Schenckii (acic) the expression of the reed phosphatase is dominant over acic phosphatasc. There is good evidence that in such grafts the preexisting acic phosphatase is converted on the molecular level via an intermediate form to the reed phosphatase. This conversion can be initiated by the transplantation of a med cell nucleus to an anucleate acic cell, but will also take place in grafts between anuclcate reed and anuclcate aeic cells, indicating that the direct participation of a cell nucleus is not required. An incomplete conversion of acic phosphatase, which terminates at the intermediate stage, is induced in acie cells by injection of a concentrated homogenatc of reed cytoplasm. A similar partial conversion occurs in vitro in a mixture of homogcnates from <b>reed</b> and acic <b>cells.</b> Subcellular particles, such as chloroplasts or mitochondria, can be removed from the homogenatcs by centrifugation without impairing the reactions leading to the intermediate phosphatase type. Experimental evidence suggests that the transformation of phosphatase types is enzymatically catalyzed and may involve the conjugation of small molecules with the phosphatasc protein. It was shown, however, that sialic acid is not involved, since the incubation of reed or acic homogenates with neuraminidase did not modify the electrophoretic mobility of either enzyme type. Another type of phosphatase, which occurs in Acetabularia crenulata (cren) and can be distinguished electrophoretically from the aforementioned types, is not subject to interaction. In various mono- and multi-nucleate graft combinations between cren cells on one hand, and <b>reed</b> or acic <b>cells</b> on the other hand, the cren phosphatase is synthesized independently of the enzyme of the graft partner...|$|R
