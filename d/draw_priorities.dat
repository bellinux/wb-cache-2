Accordingly, advances in waste management are currently being applied to minimize {{the environmental impact of}} existing sites. This has given rise to the need to undertake an environmental diagnosis of existing facilities in order to analyse the problems they present and take the necessary measures for reducing adverse effects. Taking into account the country's territorial division, the study began with an analysis of the seventeen points of deposit located in the Fifth Region of Valparaiso. Researchers used a methodology for measuring environmental impact of urban waste landfills developed by the University of Granada in collaboration with the Catholic University of Valparaiso. By applying this methodology a series of environmental indexes were obtained making it possible to quantify the impact of deposit points on the environmental elements surface water, groundwater, atmosphere, soil and human health. These indexes were as follows: Environmental-Landfill Interaction index; Environmental Risk Index; Environmental Weighting Coefficient; Environmental Value and Probability of Contamination. Analysis of results showed an absence of statistically significant differences in the environmental impact of the landfills, classified as low in all cases. Environmental elements most affected were groundwater and soil. The study also made it possible to compile a catalogue of all the points of deposit and <b>draw</b> up <b>priorities</b> for action. With the exception of one landfill which should be sealed, these action priorities will be aimed at improving the exploitation and design of existing facilities.

Since denim washing itself is involved with processing of dyes and chemicals that affect the environment, a total prevention of pollution cannot be expected. On the other hand denims are customer driven products and more fashionable out looks are always demanded and of which end result could also be producing a lot of impacts to the environment. So {{that it is necessary}} to control the washing processes and take every steps to minimize industry wastes and environmental pollution by employing alternative applications with learned limitations on the products and washing processes. This research attempts to examine process improvements in denim washing in three directions; product quality, process quality and environment pollution. In order to enhance customer satisfaction, garment quality is to be ensured against customer's stated and unstated needs while monitoring the washing process. The contributory factors in deter mining the quality of process are cost reduction, productivity improvement, waste minimization, optimum use of resources etc. In case of pollution prevention, water conservation, reuse of chemicals, waste minimization, waste recovery, effluent control, of environmental hazards etc. are examined. This study shows the means of increasing the quality of garments and productivity of processes. It proposes the use of bio-degradable enzymes in place of harmful chemicals.

40|$|The {{limitations}} {{of a formal}} interpretation {{of the right to}} equality are now well recognized. However, the meaning of substantive equality remains deeply contested. This article argues that the right to substantive equality should not be collapsed into a single formula, such as dignity, or equality of opportunity or results. Instead, drawing on familiar conceptions, a four dimensional approach is proposed: to redress disadvantage; address stigma, stereotyping, prejudice, and violence; enhance voice and participation; and accommodate difference and achieve structural change. This reflects the principle that the right to equality should be responsive to those who are disadvantaged, demeaned, excluded, or ignored. The four-dimensional approach is deliberately framed in terms of dimensions, to permit us to focus on their interaction and synergies, rather than asserting a pre-established lexical <b>priority.</b> <b>Drawing</b> attention to all the dimensions and insisting on building complementarities can move us positively towards furthering substantive equality. Conflicts should be addressed by referring to the whole framework, to create a synthesis rather than prioritizing.

40|$|Background: Like many {{countries}} in Southeast Asia, Vietnam’s rapid population and economic growth has met challenges in infrastructure development, especially sanitation in rural areas. Objective: As an entry point, we developed scenario planning as an actionresearch tool in a peri-urban community to identify first steps towards improving their complex sanitation problem and to, systemically, address emerging/re-emerging infectious diseases, as these are commonly linked to unsafe water and inade-quate sanitation conditions. As an integrated approach, the process of constructing scenarios allowed us to work across sectors and stakeholders to incorporate this knowledge into a common vision. Design: We conducted focus group discussions to identify and rank driving forces, orally constructed scenarios for the most uncertain drivers, discussed scenario implications and options, and examined the overall process for usefulness and sustainability. During a one-month scoping phase and in between focus group meetings, we carried out household visits which helped us understand the context of data and gather feedback from participants outside of the formal data collection process. Recorded results from these activities were used to develop subsequent tools.
