For genotype 1 hepatitis C treated with Pegylated interferon-alpha-2a or Pegylated interferon-alpha-2b combined with ribavirin, a GWA study has shown that SNPs near the human IL28B gene, encoding interferon lambda 3, are associated with significant differences {{in response to the}} treatment. A later report demonstrated that the same genetic variants are also associated with the natural clearance of the genotype 1 hepatitis C virus.

The proposed algorithm is a cascaded filter employing a Modified <b>Decision</b> <b>Based</b> Median Filter as its first stage of operation. The second stage involves a combination of a new algorithm that calculates mean of difference in neighborhood pixels and a Modified Unsymmetric Trimmed Mean Filter. The proposed algorithm when compared with existing non-linear filters such as Standard Median Filter (SMF), Adaptive Median Filter (AMF), <b>Decision</b> <b>Based</b> Algorithm (DBA), Progressive Switch Median Filter (PSMF), Modified <b>Decision</b> <b>Based</b> Algorithm (MDBA) and Modified <b>Decision</b> <b>Based</b> Unsymmetric Trimmed Median Filter (MDBUTMF) produces a better Peak Signal-to-Noise Ratio (PSNR) and Image Enhancement Factor (IEF) even at high density salt and pepper noise. The proposed algorithm is tested for different images and the results are compared with other filters. The proposed algorithm results better in terms of image restoration and quantitative measures...|$|R

5|$|Oregon’s {{state courts}} are courts of general jurisdiction, unlike federal courts. That is, the state courts can hear all cases {{regardless}} of whether the dispute is based on state law, federal law, or a combination of both, with a few exceptions. Thus the Oregon Supreme Court can hear appeals for cases based on both federal and state law. Although the U.S. Supreme Court is the only court that can overturn decisions of the Oregon court, Oregon Supreme Court decisions as to federal law are only binding on other Oregon state level courts. Federal courts are not required to follow the decisions of the Oregon Supreme Court for <b>decisions</b> <b>based</b> on federal law, regardless as to if the federal court is located within the state. However, federal courts are bound to follow Oregon law and decisions of the Oregon Supreme Court for cases that involve disputes based on Oregon law, even when those federal courts are not based in Oregon, per the Erie Doctrine developed by the U.S. Supreme Court. For this reason federal courts, and courts from other states, can certify questions about Oregon law to the Oregon Supreme Court in order to clarify what the law in Oregon is in regards to the specific fact pattern that the federal court has before it in their case (see ORS 28.200 to 28.255 and ORAP 12.20).|$|E
5|$|Schneider started Vancouver's {{next game}} against the Calgary Flames. For the second-straight game, Vancouver lost a two-goal lead in a game which {{eventually}} went to a shootout. In contrast to his first start, Schneider had a strong game, making 34 saves {{by the end of}} overtime. In the shootout, he stopped four of the five shooters he faced, earning the Canucks their first win of the season. Two nights later, as they began their first road trip, the Canucks played a rematch with the Ducks in Anaheim. Schneider made the start and earned some redemption, stopping all 30 Anaheim shots, helping the Canucks to the 5–0 win and earning his fifth career shutout. Following the win, Schneider started the next game, a 4–1 loss to the San Jose Sharks. Luongo started the next four games, finishing off the month of January and beginning February. Vigneault joked that he was making his starting goaltender <b>decisions</b> <b>based</b> on coin tosses. He further noted that the two goaltenders were team guys and they would do what was asked of them and never complain. The coin became a running joke for Vigneault and the Canucks in general, as Ryan Kesler stated he flipped it before announcing his return from injury.|$|E

40|$|An {{advanced}} non-linear cascading filter algorithm for {{the removal}} of high density salt and pepper noise from the digital images is proposed. The proposed method consists of two stages. The first stage <b>Decision</b> <b>base</b> Median Filter (DMF) acts as the preliminary noise removal algorithm. The second stage is either Modified <b>Decision</b> <b>Base</b> Partial Trimmed Global Mean Filter (MDBPTGMF) or Modified <b>Decision</b> <b>Based</b> Unsymmetric Trimmed Median Filter (MDBUTMF) which is used to remove the remaining noise and enhance the image quality. The DMF algorithm performs well at low noise density but it fails to remove the noise at medium and high level. The MDBPTGMF and MDUTMF have excellent performance at low, medium and high noise density but these reduce the image quality and blur the image at high noise level. So the basic idea behind this paper is to combine the advantages of the filters used in both the stages to remove the Salt and Pepper noise and enhance the image quality at all the noise density level. The proposed method is tested against different gray scale images and it gives better Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Peak Signal to Noise Ratio (PSNR) and Image Enhancement Factor (IEF) than the Adaptive Median Filter (AMF), <b>Decision</b> <b>Base</b> Unsymmetric Trimmed Median Filter (DBUTMF), Modified <b>Decision</b> <b>Base</b> Unsymmetric Trimmed Median Filter (MDBUTMF) and <b>Decision</b> <b>Base</b> Partial Trimmed Global Mean Filter (DBPTGMF).

40|$|In this {{research}} a Collaborative Optimization (CO) approach for multidisciplinary systems design {{is used to}} develop a <b>decision</b> <b>based</b> design framework for non-deterministic optimization.

By transforming this framework for use in collaborative optimization one can decompose the business and engineering decision making processes. In the new multilevel framework of <b>Decision</b> <b>Based</b> Collaborative Optimization (DBCO) the business decisions are made at the system level. These business decisions result in a set of engineering performance targets that disciplinary engineering design teams seek to satisfy as part of subspace optimizations.
