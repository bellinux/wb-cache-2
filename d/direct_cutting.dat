50|$|The {{original}} {{route of}} the London to Holyhead road ran through Tettenhall, though on a different course from the current A41 Tettenhall Road. The road, when heading north east from Wolverhampton, ran behind the shops at Newbridge, on bridges over the Staffordshire and Worcestershire Canal (when built in 1772) and the river Smestow, then across to Old Hill, where a steep climb was had for any carriages on route. The road then cut across Upper Green, swayed left into Wrottesley Road as far as Woodthorne Road, and then continuing on as the present Wergs Road. This route, because of {{the problems associated with}} carriages traversing the steep Old Hill, was looked at in the early seventeenth century by the Wolverhampton Trust and Thomas Telford, with a view to engineering a new route - either around, under, or through the ridge. Due to a dispute Thomas Telford dropped out of the plans, leaving the Wolverhampton Trust to go it alone. The preferred method was a cutting through the ridge, with the course of the road sloping up on a gradual gradient from near the Newbridge area, cutting through and rising above Lower Green, before the <b>direct</b> <b>cutting</b> through the ridge to come out next to Upper Green. The spoil from the cutting through the ridge is what was used to create the incline of the road. Work was completed in 1823.|$|E
40|$|Purpose: The {{work was}} aimed at {{temperature}} measurement {{with respect to the}} heating process in the bundles of metal sheets in the <b>direct</b> <b>cutting</b> zone during the cutting process conducted on a guillotine. Design/methodology/approach: The paper presents a methodology to analyse the process of heating the bundles of metal sheets during cutting on a guillotine, designed and built from scratch. The temperature in bundles in the <b>direct</b> <b>cutting</b> zone has been determined in an experimental way using a specialised infrared camera. The research has been conducted {{in order to reduce the}} number of randomly occurring defects during cutting of metal sheets on a guillotine. Findings: Possibilities of finding of the optimum cutting parameters on account of maximum permissible temperature in the bundles of metal sheets have been determined. The experimental data indicates that it is possible to select a set of guillotine parameters which allow for reducing of temperature measured in the <b>direct</b> <b>cutting</b> zone. Temperature reduction allows for avoidance of defects which might occur in the <b>direct</b> <b>cutting</b> zone as the result of progressing heat transfer during cutting. The defects occurring on the blade of a cutting tool might also contribute to the local growth of temperature corresponding to the positions of the defects on the blade. Research limitations/implications: The experimentally assumed characteristics of temperature versus time for in advance chosen cutting parameters may be generalized for a wide gamut of materials and for changeable cutting conditions; however, the obtained experimentally values of temperature are specific and related to the chosen types of materials and fixed cutting conditions of a guillotine. Practical implications: The appropriate selection of the cutting parameters on account of temperature characteristics is essential in terms of industrial economy. It enables reducing the amount of waste caused by defects in cutting bundles of sheets and decreases wear of the cutting tool. Originality/value: The results acquired from the research form a base for selection of the best parameter settings required for conducting the optimum cutting process on a guillotine. The optimum set of cutting parameters combined with the lowest possible value of temperature generated in the <b>direct</b> <b>cutting</b> zone leads to the reduction of defects’ number occurring during the process...|$|E

40|$|Aim To select {{appropriate}} preprocessing {{methods for}} different substrates {{by comparing the}} effects of four different preprocessing methods on touch DNA samples and {{to determine the effect}} of various storage times on the results of touch DNA sample analysis. Method Hand touch DNA samples were used to investigate the detection and inspection results of DNA on different substrates. Four preprocessing methods, including the <b>direct</b> <b>cutting</b> method, stubbing procedure, double swab technique, and vacuum cleaner method, were used in this study. DNA was extracted from mock samples with four different preprocessing methods. The best preprocess protocol determined from the study was further used to compare performance after various storage times. DNA extracted from all samples was quantified and amplified using standard procedures. Results The amounts of DNA and the number of alleles detected on the porous substrates were greater than those on the non-porous substrates. The performances of the four preprocessing methods varied with different substrates. The <b>direct</b> <b>cutting</b> method displayed advantages for porous substrates, and the vacuum cleaner method was advantageous for non-porous substrates. No significant degradation trend was observed as the storage times increased. Conclusion Different substrates require the use of different preprocessing method in order to obtain the highest DNA amount and allele number from touch DNA samples. This study provides a theoretical basis for explorations of touch DNA samples and may be used as a reference when dealing with touch DNA samples in case work...|$|E

40|$|Purpose: The {{work was}} aimed at {{elaboration}} of methods and algorithms for thermal process optimisation during cutting the bundles of various types of metal sheets made of copper, brass and bronze interleaved with paper on a guillotine {{with respect to the}} heating process. Design/methodology/approach: The numerical simulations were conducted using an author’s computer program prepared in the object oriented language C++ using the finite difference method. The optimisation has been conducted employing the genetic algorithms which were also implemented in C++ language and elaborated as an author’s computer program. As the objective function the maximum values of temperatures occurring in the <b>direct</b> <b>cutting</b> zone of the sheet bundles were assumed and the cutting velocity was established as a design variable. Findings: Possibilities of designation of the optimum cutting parameters on account of maximum admissible temperature of the bundles of various metals have been indicated. The constraints imposed on the temperature were needed to avoid defects which might occur in the <b>direct</b> <b>cutting</b> zone as the result of progressing heating during cutting.

40|$|A strain {{analysis}} of the foams used as cosmeses for artificial limbs was conducted. It was found that on flexion of an artificial limb strain occurred in the knee region. The mechanical properties of cosmeses materials suggested that the foams would not fail at the strain levels measured when undamaged. However, when the foam became cracked {{the properties of the}} foams were reduced to a level that would make failure likely to occur when the cracks reached critical lengths. The failure mechanism of the foam coverings was established via the use of a test rig, designed and built to simulate the interaction between the artificial limb patella piece and the foam. Foam samples were tested both with and without protective elastic netting. The primary cause of failure was found to be wear induced cracking. It was recommended that the design of the patella piece should be changed so as to be less damaging, and that netting should be used for all foams. Silicone foam materials were formulated and investigated for their suitability as a cosmesis foam. Silicone foam samples were tested on the fatigue test rig. Skinned silicone foams with netting had lifetimes three times that of any cosmesis foam tested in a condition currently used in production procedure, and 35 % longer than any foam tested in any condition. It was found from leg measurement studies that there was a general leg shape for males and females. Details of leg shapes were transferred to a C. A. D. system. A match from the C. A.
