In other cultures the surname is placed first, followed by the given name or names. The latter is often called the Eastern order because Europeans are most familiar with the examples from the East Asian cultural sphere, specifically Japan, China and Taiwan, <b>Korea</b> (<b>Republic</b> of Korea and Democratic People's Republic of Korea) and Vietnam. This is also the case in Hungary, parts of Romania, Bavaria, Austria, Albania and Kosovo, parts of South India, Sri Lanka, and Madagascar.|$|E

2500|$|Although both rival factions tried {{initially}} to diplomatically reunite the divided nation, the Northern faction eventually {{tried to do}} so with military force. The North hoped {{that they would be}} able to unify the peninsula via insurgency, but the success of South <b>Korea</b> (<b>Republic</b> of Korea: ROK) in suppressing insurgency brought about the realization for the North that they would require military force. North Korea (Democratic People's Republic of Korea: DPRK) had expanded their army and Korean volunteers fighting in Manchuria in the Chinese Civil War had given their troops battle experience. [...] The North expected to win with the war in a matter of days. [...] Troops from Kim Il Sung's North Korean Army (KPA) crossed the 38th parallel on 25 June 1950 beginning a civil war.|$|E
2500|$|In the 31st {{minute of}} the game between France and <b>Korea</b> <b>Republic,</b> the French midfielder Patrick Vieira had a header at goal which {{appeared}} to be saved by Korean goalkeeper Lee Woon-Jae from behind the goal line. Mexican referee Benito Archundia and his linesmen {{did not believe the}} ball had passed the line, and no goal was awarded. The game resulted in a last minute 1–1 draw, shocking the French. French coach Raymond Domenech believed that France [...] "scored a second time, but the referee did not recognize that." [...] Television replays showed that the goal should have been awarded. French player Thierry Henry claimed the team was [...] "really upset" [...] when they saw the ball had passed the goal-line as [...] "if he (the referee) had given us the valid goal, that would not have offered the Koreans the opportunity to come back into the match." [...] However, {{it should also be noted}} that the corner kick leading to the header should have been a goal kick, as the ball had gone out of bounds off a French player. [...] In addition, there appeared to be a whistle on the play for a foul on France, which would have negated the goal anyway.|$|E
