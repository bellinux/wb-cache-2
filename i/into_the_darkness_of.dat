5|$|The {{spacecraft}} {{in which}} the telescope and instruments were to be housed was another major engineering challenge. It would have to withstand frequent passages from direct sunlight <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>darkness</b> <b>of</b> Earth's shadow, which would cause major changes in temperature, while being stable enough to allow extremely accurate pointing of the telescope. A shroud of multi-layer insulation keeps the temperature within the telescope stable and surrounds a light aluminum shell {{in which the}} telescope and instruments sit. Within the shell, a graphite-epoxy frame keeps the working parts of the telescope firmly aligned. Because graphite composites are hygroscopic, there was a risk that water vapor absorbed by the truss while in Lockheed's clean room would later be expressed in the vacuum of space; resulting in the telescope's instruments being covered by ice. To reduce that risk, a nitrogen gas purge was performed before launching the telescope into space.|$|E
500|$|In {{the right}} panel, Dyer is shown {{with his eyes}} shut, {{vomiting}} into a hand basin. In the two outer frames his figure is shadowed by arrows, pictorial devices that Bacon often used to place a sense of energy into his paintings. In this work, the arrows point to a man about to die, and according to Tóibín they scream [...] "Here!", [...] "Him!". The arrow of the right panel, according to Tóibín, points to a [...] "dead figure on the lavatory bowl, as though telling the Furies where to find him". The triptych is centralised by the lightbulb, and {{by the fact that}} Dyer faces inwards in the two outer canvasses. The triptych's composition and setting are poised to suggest instability, and the doors in each side panel are splayed outwards as if to look <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>darkness</b> <b>of</b> the foreground.|$|E
2500|$|Touched by {{controversy}} and repressed by both nationalists and communists, Sanielevici's {{work has been}} ignored {{by the general public}} in the decades after he died. Marxist sociologist Henri H. Stahl reports: [...] "Sanielevici is an isolated dissident, read for only as long as a momentary interest lasted for his paradoxical polemics, then forgotten and in any case unable to group around him either disciples or offspring." [...] Writing in 2009, Antonio Patraş noted that the sociologist had [...] "sunk into oblivion even when alive, later to be literally buried <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>darkness</b> <b>of</b> totalitarianism". In 2010, Adrian Jicu described Sanielevici as [...] "almost unknown", despite the [...] "revolutionary" [...] role he had in the [...] "interdisciplinary" [...] study of literature, and despite the pains Sanielevici took to make himself memorable as a [...] "Dinaric" [...] racial specimen.|$|E

2500|$|... "After {{studying}} 19th-century Inuit oral testimony– {{which included}} eyewitness descriptions of starving, exhausted men staggering {{through the snow}} without condescending to ask local people how they survived in such a wilderness– [...] believes the 19th-century official accounts that all the surviving expedition members abandoned their ice-locked ships are wrong. [...] He believes both ships drifted southwards, {{with at least two}} crew remaining until the final destruction of their vessels. One broke up, but Inuit hunters arriving at their summer hunting grounds reported discovering another ship floating in fresh ice in a cove."They're not very strong on location or date," [...] Grenier said. [...] "They have all the space and time in the world, but what they reported seems quite clear."The ship, probably the Terror, was very neat and orderly, but the Inuit descended <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>darkness</b> <b>of</b> the hull with their seal-oil lamps, where they found a tall dead man in an inner cabin. [...] Grenier believes it was there they recovered the copper, which was more valuable than gold to them, and tools including shears from the ship's workshop with which to work it. [...] Hauntingly, they also reported that one of the masts was on fire. Grenier wonders if what they saw was the funnel from the galley still smoking from a meal cooked that morning, before the last of Franklin's men disappeared from history.|$|E
2500|$|The poem {{begins on}} the night of Maundy Thursday on March 24 (or April 7) 1300 A.D., shortly before dawn of Good Friday. The narrator, Dante himself, is thirty-five years old, and thus [...] "midway in the journey of our life" [...] (Nel mezzo del cammin di nostra vita) – half of the Biblical {{lifespan}} of seventy (Psalm 89:10, Vulgate; Psalm 90:10, KJV). The poet finds himself lost in a dark wood (selva oscura), astray from the [...] "straight way" [...] (diritta via, also translatable as [...] "right way") of salvation. He sets out to climb directly up a small mountain, but his way is blocked by three beasts he cannot evade: a lonza (usually rendered as [...] "leopard" [...] or [...] "leopon"), a leone (lion), and a lupa (she-wolf). The three beasts, taken from the Jeremiah 5:6, are thought to symbolize the three kinds of sin that bring the unrepentant soul into one of the three major divisions of Hell. According to John Ciardi, these are incontinence (the she-wolf); violence and bestiality (the lion); and fraud and malice (the leopard); Dorothy L. Sayers assigns the leopard to incontinence and the she-wolf to fraud/malice. It is now dawn of Good Friday, April 8, with the sun rising in Aries. The beasts drive him back despairing <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>darkness</b> <b>of</b> error, a [...] "lower place" [...] (basso loco) where the sun is silent (l sol tace). However, Dante is rescued by a figure who announces that he was born sub Iulio (i.e. in the time of Julius Caesar) and lived under Augustus: it is the shade of the Roman poet Virgil, author of the Aeneid, a Latin epic.|$|E
