25|$|One {{method to}} confirm that the bra is the best fit has been nicknamed the Swoop and Scoop. After {{identifying}} a well-fitting bra, the woman bends forward (the swoop), allowing their breasts to fall into the bra, filling the cup naturally, and then fastening the bra on the outermost set of hooks. When the woman stands up, she uses the opposite hand to place each breast gently into the cup (the scoop), and she then runs her index <b>finger</b> <b>along</b> <b>the</b> inside top edge of the bra cup to make sure her breast tissue does not spill over the edges.|$|E
500|$|Gary Rydstrom and {{his team}} at Skywalker Sound were hired for the film's sound production. Like Howard, Rydstrom {{employed}} different sounds for the two cultures. Focusing on the machine and mechanical sounds of the early industrial era for the explorers, {{he felt that the}} Atlanteans should have a [...] "more organic" [...] sound utilizing ceramics and pottery. The sound made by the Atlantean flying-fish vehicles posed a particular challenge. Rydstrom revealed that he was sitting at the side of a highway recording one day when a semi-truck drove by at high speed. When the recording was sped up on his computer he felt it sounded very organic, and that is what is heard within the film. Rydstrom created the harmonic chiming of the Heart of Atlantis by rubbing his <b>finger</b> <b>along</b> <b>the</b> edge of a champagne flute, and the sound of sub-pods moving through water with a water pick.|$|E
6000|$|... “She won’t stand much of this,” Jimmy said gravely, {{running the}} end of his <b>finger</b> <b>along</b> <b>the</b> shallow groove made by the sharp teeth of the {{splitting}} ice.|$|E
60|$|Kate hung her head, and ran her <b>fingers</b> <b>along</b> <b>the</b> {{mouldings}} of his chair.|$|R
60|$|Having {{received}} it, {{he ran his}} <b>fingers</b> <b>along</b> <b>the</b> columns, and dashing {{down the}} book, declared that no such name was there.|$|R
60|$|Having {{taken his}} leave {{of the friends}} who had flocked about him with the {{observation}} {{that he had a}} long journey before him, he called for the axe, and, when presented to him, ran his <b>fingers</b> <b>along</b> <b>the</b> edge, and smiled.|$|R
6000|$|... "For awhile. Until {{they get}} {{reinforcements}} {{from some other}} area." [...] Tasso began to clean {{the interior of the}} gun with a bit of rag. She finished and pushed the mechanism back into place. She closed the gun, running her <b>finger</b> <b>along</b> <b>the</b> barrel.|$|E
6000|$|Helen ran {{the point}} of her slim <b>finger</b> <b>along</b> <b>the</b> sketch until it reached a tiny dormer window in the {{left-hand}} corner, half-hidden by an irregular chimney-stack. The curtains were closely drawn. Keeping her finger upon the spot, she said, interrogatively, [...] "And you saw THAT window?" ...|$|E
60|$|Crossing to the {{obviously}} tight window, {{he ran his}} <b>finger</b> <b>along</b> <b>the</b> edge of the sash with infinite care. He trembled. In a second, now, he had to {{turn and}} make light of the lips which he would fain have approached with ceremony pompous and lingering.|$|E
6000|$|... "Here it is," [...] {{she whispered}} joyously, [...] "here {{it has been}} all the time." [...] Running her <b>fingers</b> <b>along</b> <b>the</b> molding until she found a little hidden spring, she pushed it, {{and one of the}} great panels swung slowly in, {{revealing}} the yawning mouth of a black opening behind.|$|R
60|$|But Mother Gunga {{would not}} fight as Peroo desired. After the first {{down-stream}} plunge there came no more walls of water, but the river lifted herself bodily, as a snake when she drinks in mid-summer, plucking and <b>fingering</b> <b>along</b> <b>the</b> revetments, and banking {{up behind the}} piers till even Findlayson began to recalculate {{the strength of his}} work.|$|R
50|$|Tadoma is {{a method}} of {{communication}} used by deafblind individuals, in which the deafblind person places their thumb on the speaker's lips and their <b>fingers</b> <b>along</b> <b>the</b> jawline. The middle three <b>fingers</b> often fall <b>along</b> <b>the</b> speaker's cheeks with the little finger picking up the vibrations of the speaker's throat. It is {{sometimes referred to as}} 'tactile lipreading', as the deafblind person feels the movement of the lips, as well as vibrations of the vocal cords, puffing of the cheeks and the warm air produced by nasal sounds such as 'N' and 'M'. There are variations in the hand positioning, and it {{is a method}} sometimes used by people to support their remaining hearing.|$|R
60|$|He feverishly ran a <b>finger</b> <b>along</b> <b>the</b> upper rim of {{his left}} ear, sprang up, stooped to take her hand, glared into her eyes till she shrank--and then a nail-cleaner, a common, ten-cent file, fell out of his inner pocket and clinked on the stone step.|$|E
6000|$|... 'She is a curate's daughter,' said Traddles; 'one of ten, down in Devonshire. Yes!' For {{he saw me}} glance, involuntarily, at the {{prospect}} on the inkstand. 'That's the church! You come round here to the left, out of this gate,' tracing his <b>finger</b> <b>along</b> <b>the</b> inkstand, 'and exactly where I hold this pen, there stands the house--facing, you understand, towards the church.' ...|$|E
60|$|Soames {{watched his}} {{daughter}} give her hand, saw her wince at the squeeze it received, and distinctly heard the young man's sigh {{as he passed}} out. Then she came from the window, trailing her <b>finger</b> <b>along</b> <b>the</b> mahogany edge of the billiard-table. Watching her, Soames {{knew that she was}} going to ask him something. Her finger felt round the last pocket, and she looked up.|$|E
5000|$|Also {{called the}} [...] "dinner knife" [...] grip. The handle is held {{with the second}} through fourth <b>fingers</b> and secured <b>along</b> <b>the</b> base of the thumb, with <b>the</b> index <b>finger</b> {{extended}} <b>along</b> <b>the</b> top rear of the blade and <b>the</b> thumb <b>along</b> <b>the</b> side of the handle. This grip is best for initial incisions and larger cuts.|$|R
5000|$|Use {{the middle}} finger to {{identify}} the posterior fontanelle, then move <b>the</b> <b>finger</b> forward <b>along</b> <b>the</b> sagittal suture approximately 3 cm / 1 inch.|$|R
50|$|The {{contemporary}} {{history of}} ASMR began on 19 October 2007 when a 21-year-old registered user of a discussion forum for health-related subjects at a website called 'Steady Health', with the username 'okaywhatever', submitted a post {{in which they}} described having experienced a specific sensation since childhood, comparable to that stimulated by tracing <b>fingers</b> <b>along</b> <b>the</b> skin, yet often triggered by seemingly random and unrelated non-haptic events, such as 'watching a puppet show' or 'being read a story'.|$|R
60|$|Next {{morning about}} half-past ten Mr. Polly found himself seated under {{a clump of}} fir trees by the {{roadside}} and about three miles {{and a half from}} the Potwell Inn. He was by no means sure whether he was taking a walk to clear his mind or leaving that threat-marred Paradise for good and all. His reason pointed a lean, unhesitating <b>finger</b> <b>along</b> <b>the</b> latter course.|$|E
60|$|They talked {{but little}} {{until they had}} eaten, and then their tongues were loosened. He spoke of the {{happiness}} that was now certainly theirs, of the folly of not breaking sooner out of that magnificent prison of latter-day life, of the old romantic days that had passed from the world for ever. And then he became boastful. He took up the sword that {{lay on the ground}} beside him, and she took it from his hand and ran a tremulous <b>finger</b> <b>along</b> <b>the</b> blade.|$|E
60|$|Equally fixed {{were the}} details of the grubby office itself. Like many men who have pride in the smartest {{suburban}} homes available, Mr. Wilkins was content with an office shabby and inconvenient. He regarded beautiful offices as in some way effeminate.... His wasn't effeminate; it was undecorative as a filled ash-tray, despite Una's daily following up of the careless scrubwomen with dust-cloth and whisk. She knew every inch of it, as a gardener knows his plot. She could never keep from noticing and running her <b>finger</b> <b>along</b> <b>the</b> pebbled glass of the oak-and-glass partition about Mr. Wilkins's private office, each of the hundreds of times a day she passed it; and when she lay awake at midnight, her finger-tips would recall precisely the feeling of that rough surface, even to the sharp edges of a tiny flaw in the glass over the bookcase.|$|E
5000|$|The {{instrument}} {{consists of}} two strings on a fretless neck. A crank is affixed to a small nylon wheel mounted on the body. The player turns the crank, causing the wheel to spin and [...] "bow" [...] the strings. This concept {{is similar to that}} employed by the hurdy-gurdy. Unlike most hurdy-gurdies, Onoue's instrument has no keybox, but is <b>fingered</b> <b>along</b> <b>the</b> neck. This detail is similar to the dulcigurdy, a hurdy-gurdy variant recorded by Michael Praetorius.|$|R
5000|$|A {{straight}} {{pitch is}} achieved by gripping the ball with the fingers across the wide part of the seam (called a [...] "four-seam fastball") so that both the index and middle fingers are touching two seams perpendicularly. A sinking fastball is thrown by gripping it across the narrow part (a [...] "two-seam fastball") so that both the index and middle <b>fingers</b> are <b>along</b> a seam. Lateral motion {{is achieved by}} holding a four-seam fastball off-center (a [...] "cut fastball"), and sinking action with a lateral break is thrown by splitting <b>the</b> <b>fingers</b> <b>along</b> <b>the</b> seams (a [...] "split-finger fastball").|$|R
2500|$|Since Braille {{is one of}} the few writing systems where tactile {{perception}} is used, as opposed to visual perception, a braille reader must develop new skills. [...] One skill important for Braille readers is the ability to create smooth and even pressures when running one's <b>fingers</b> <b>along</b> <b>the</b> words. [...] There are many different styles and techniques used for the understanding and development of braille, even though a study by B. F. Holland suggests that there is no specific technique that is superior to any other.|$|R
6000|$|... "How very provoking! You don't {{understand}} Flemish, and I don't understand Flattery. I should so like to {{know what}} it means. Ah, I see books in this lovely room. Is there a dictionary among them?" [...] She darted to the bookcase, and discovered a dictionary. [...] "Now I shall understand Flattery," [...] she remarked--"and then we shall understand each other. Oh, let me find it for myself!" [...] She ran her raw red <b>finger</b> <b>along</b> <b>the</b> alphabetical headings at the top of each page. [...] "'FAD.' That won't do. 'FIE.' Further on still. 'FLE.' Too far the other way. 'FLA.' Here we are! 'Flattery: False praise. Commendation bestowed for the purpose of gaining favor and influence.' Oh, Helena, how cruel of you!" [...] She dropped the book, and sank into a chair--the picture, if such a thing can be, of a broken-hearted old maid.|$|E
6000|$|... "You {{will find}} that a little {{difficult}} at first, but you will soon get accustomed to it, and your little finger will rapidly gain strength, and, you see, the hold of your first <b>finger</b> <b>along</b> <b>the</b> barrel helps the other two to steady it. By having the middle and third fingers both on the trigger, you give a pressure rather than a pull to it, and they will soon come to give that pressure {{at the very moment}} when the first finger gets on the mark aimed at. Now try it half a dozen times with the pistol unloaded, and after pressing the trigger keep your hand and arm in as nearly the same position, so as to see if it is pointing truly at the mark. Very good! Now try with the left hand. There, you see, that hand is not so accustomed to its work, and though you might have hit the target, I doubt if either of the shots would have struck the inner circle. Now we will try with the pistol loaded." ...|$|E
6000|$|But he {{remained}} composed; and never took his eye off {{the patch of}} flame which had begun by spreading, but now seemed to shrink a little as it hissed under the torch of the long silver spear of water. He kept his <b>finger</b> <b>along</b> <b>the</b> nozzle of the pipe to ensure the aim, and attended to no other business, knowing only by the noise and that semi-conscious corner of the eye, the exciting incidents that began to tumble themselves about the island garden. He gave two brief directions to his friends. One was: [...] "Knock these fellows down somehow and tie them up, whoever they are; there's rope down by those faggots. They want to take away my nice hose." [...] The other was: [...] "As {{soon as you get}} a chance, call out to that canoeing girl; she's over on the bank with the gipsies. Ask her if they could get some buckets across and fill them from the river." [...] Then he closed his mouth and continued to water the new red flower as ruthlessly as he had watered the red tulip.|$|E
60|$|What strange {{business}} had he here {{among the dead}} that demanded such caution in its pursuit? Presently he advanced toward the pile of corpses. Quickly he tore open coats and searched pockets. He ran his <b>fingers</b> <b>along</b> <b>the</b> <b>fingers</b> of the dead. Two rings had rewarded his search and he was busy with a third that encircled the finger of a body that lay beneath three others. It would not come off. He pulled and tugged, and then he drew a knife from his pocket.|$|R
40|$|We {{reconsider the}} radial Saffman-Taylor instability, when a fluid {{injected}} {{from a point}} source displaces another fluid with a higher viscosity in a Hele-Shaw cell, where the fluids are confined between two neighboring flat plates. The advancing fluid front is unstable and forms <b>fingers</b> <b>along</b> <b>the</b> circumference. The so-called Brinkman equations is {{used to describe the}} flow field, which also takes into account viscous stresses in the plane and not only viscous stresses due to the confining plates like the Darcy equation. The dispersion relation agrees better with the experimental results than the classical linear stability analysis of radial fingering in Hele-Shaw cells that uses Darcy's law {{as a model for the}} fluid motion...|$|R
6000|$|... "Now {{light the}} sacred fire {{to make our}} feast, before I slay the victims," [...] the god said, in a gloating voice, running his <b>finger</b> again <b>along</b> <b>the</b> edge of his huge hatchet.|$|R
6000|$|In fast-failing daylight, FALDER, in his stockings, is seen [...] {{standing}} motionless, {{with his}} head inclined towards the door, [...] listening. He moves {{a little closer to}} the door, his stockinged [...] feet making no noise. He stops at the door. He is trying [...] harder and harder to hear something, any little thing that is [...] going on outside. He springs suddenly upright--as if at a [...] sound-and remains perfectly motionless. Then, with a heavy [...] sigh, he moves to his work, and stands looking at it, with his [...] head doom; he does a stitch or two, having the air of a man so [...] lost in sadness that each stitch is, as it were, a coming to [...] life. Then turning abruptly, he begins pacing the cell, moving [...] his head, like an animal pacing its cage. He stops again at the [...] door, listens, and, placing the palms of hip hands against it [...] with his fingers spread out, leans his forehead against the [...] iron. Turning from it, presently, he moves slowly back towards [...] the window, tracing his way with his <b>finger</b> <b>along</b> <b>the</b> top line [...] of the distemper that runs round the wall. He stops under the [...] window, and, picking up the lid of one of the tins, peers into [...] it. It has grown very nearly dark. Suddenly the lid falls out [...] of his hand with a clatter--the only sound that has broken the [...] silence--and he stands staring intently at the wall where the [...] stuff of the shirt is hanging rather white in the darkness--he [...] seems to be seeing somebody or something there. There is a [...] sharp tap and click; the cell light behind the glass screen has [...] been turned up. The cell is brightly lighted. FALDER is seen [...] gasping for breath.|$|E
6000|$|He {{picked up}} one of the burnt {{feathers}} from the little pile by his side and looked at it attentively. [...] "Perhaps, Baba, you have been told--my ears are very sharp, and I thought I heard some such words floating through the air just now--that we poor Kaffir Inyangas can prophesy nothing true unless we are paid, and perhaps that is a fact so far as something of the moment is concerned. And yet the Snake in the Inyanga, jumping over the little rock which hides the present from it, may see the path that winds far and far away through the valleys, across the streams, up the mountains, till it is lost in the 'heaven above.' Thus on this feather, burnt in my magic fire, I seem to see something of your future, O my father Macumazana. Far and far your road runs," [...] and he drew his <b>finger</b> <b>along</b> <b>the</b> feather. [...] "Here is a journey," [...] and he flicked away a carbonised flake, [...] "here is another, and another, and another," [...] and he flicked off flake after flake. [...] "Here is one that is very successful, it leaves you rich; and here is yet one more, a wonderful journey this in which you see strange things and meet strange people. Then"--and he blew on the feather in such a fashion that all the charred filaments (Brother John says that laminae is the right word for them) fell away from it--"then, there is nothing left save such a pole as some of my people stick upright on a grave, the Shaft of Memory they call it. O, my father, you will die in a distant land, but you will leave a great memory behind you that will live for hundreds of years, for see how strong is this quill over which the fire has had no power. With some of these others it is quite different," [...] he added.|$|E
6000|$|... "I think," [...] he said, [...] "that {{we shall}} {{both of us}} {{remember}} the coincidence of this meeting {{as long as we}} live. At that luncheon-table, within a few yards of us, sits Russia, the new Russia, raising his head after a thousand years' sleep, watching the times, weighing them, realising his own immeasurable strength, pointing his inevitable <b>finger</b> <b>along</b> <b>the</b> road which the Russia of to-morrow must tread. There isn't a man in that great country so much to be feared to-day, from our point of view, as the Grand Duke Augustus. And look, too, at the same table, within a few feet, Simpson, of you and of me--Selingman, Selingman who represents the real Germany; not the war party alone, intoxicated with the clash of arms, filled with bombastic desires for German triumphs on sea and land, ever ready to spout in flowery and grandiloquent phrases the glory of Germany and the Heaven-sent genius of her leaders. I tell you, Simpson, Selingman is a more dangerous man than that. He sits with folded arms, in realms of thought above these people. He sits with a map of the world before him, and he places his finger upon the inevitable spots which Germany must possess to keep time with the march of the world, to find new homes for her overflowing millions. He has no military fervour, no tinselly patriotism. He knows what Germany needs and he will carve her way towards it. Look at him with his napkin tucked under his chin, broad-visaged, podgy, a slave, you might think, to the joys of the table and the grosser things of life. You should see his eyes sometimes when the right note is struck, watch his mouth when he sits and thinks. He uses words for an ambush and a barricade. He talks often like a gay fool, a flood of empty verbiage streams from his lips, and behind, all the time his brain works." ...|$|E
50|$|Transverse flute: The {{transverse}} flute {{is similar to}} the modern flute with a mouth hole near the stoppered end and <b>finger</b> holes <b>along</b> <b>the</b> body. The player blows in the side and holds the flute to the right side.|$|R
60|$|She {{had nearly}} sunk into another sound sleep when {{precisely}} the same phenomena were repeated; <b>fingers</b> brushing <b>along</b> <b>the</b> wall close to her head, down, downward, the soft opening of the door, its close, and silence again.|$|R
50|$|The 29 {{vertical}} poles {{correspond to}} the 29 Aboriginal clans from around Sydney. As the work is designed not to be viewed from a distance but experienced up close {{as part of the}} sensual and spatial encounter, the audience are invited to touch and run their <b>fingers</b> <b>along</b> <b>the</b> engraved names and to feel the textures of the different materials. Walking between the pillars you hear a soundscape of Koori voices reciting the names of places in the Sydney region that have today been swallowed up by the metropolis. This is also a way to celebrate the moment in time.|$|R
