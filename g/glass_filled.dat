Beyoncé enters the club with a different outfit and hairstyle and some friends. Male patrons seated at the tables look on. She and Usher notice each other. They meet {{on the dance floor}} and dance intimately. Beyoncé performs an elaborate dance scene with female backing dancers. She swirls around in a champagne <b>glass</b> <b>filled</b> with bubbles. In the final scene, Beyoncé sits atop a piano and after being lifted down by a gentleman, she dances and poses as confetti falls everywhere.|$|E
500|$|Two {{scenes in}} which Stewie {{graphically}} beats up Brian using a <b>glass</b> <b>filled</b> with orange juice, various household objects, and guns polarized people who viewed it. Several production members were offended. Cast members—as well as MacFarlane's mother and an animal rights advocate—enjoyed the scene; MacFarlane quoted his mother: [...] "I don't {{see what the}} problem is? He (Brian) owed him (Stewie) money!", {{and so it was}} kept in the final cut. When Lois gives the finger to the camera during the interview with Peter and Brady, her hand was blurred out on Fox airings of the episode. However, reruns on Adult Swim and TBS left the gesture intact. The gesture was also left intact on the DVD of [...] "Volume Four"; the production team enjoyed having this level of freedom. After the initial airing of the episode, where newscaster Tom Tucker announces a report on a fictional curse word, clemen, many viewers looked up the word on the Internet {{to try to find a}} definition. MacFarlane stated in the episode's DVD commentary that if someone invents an obscene definition for the word, the show will have to stop using it (it has not been used since this episode).|$|E
2500|$|Charles Sporck retold another incident: {{during a}} European {{roadshow}} Widlar got drunk and publicly {{refused to speak}} to the audience unless he got more gin. Sporck said that [...] "We had no choice. We had to get his <b>glass</b> <b>filled</b> up. And then he went on with the lecture. And he, you know, he got plastered, but the interesting part of it is he was just so damn smart, you know. Even drunk he could just wow these people." ...|$|E

2500|$|The {{earliest}} historical {{reference to}} magnification {{dates back to}} ancient Egyptian hieroglyphs in the 5th century BC, which depict [...] "simple glass meniscal lenses". The earliest written record of magnification {{dates back to the}} 1st century AD, when Seneca the Younger, a tutor of Emperor Nero, wrote: [...] "Letters, however small and indistinct, are seen enlarged and more clearly through a globe or <b>glass</b> <b>filled</b> with water". Emperor Nero is also said to have watched the gladiatorial games using an emerald as a corrective lens.|$|E
2500|$|However, like da Vinci's, Young's {{device was}} not {{intended}} to correct refraction errors. Sir John Herschel, in a footnote of the 1845 edition of the Encyclopedia Metropolitana, posed two ideas for the visual correction: the first [...] "a spherical capsule of <b>glass</b> <b>filled</b> with animal jelly", and [...] "a mould of the cornea" [...] that could be impressed on [...] "some sort of transparent medium". Though Herschel reportedly never tested these ideas, they were both later advanced by several independent inventors such as Hungarian Dallos with István Komáromy (1929), who perfected a method of making molds from living eyes. This enabled the manufacture of lenses that, for the first time, conformed to the actual shape of the eye.|$|E
2500|$|In the art {{and life}} of Europe during the early Middle Ages, blue played a minor role. The nobility wore red or purple, while only the poor wore blue clothing, {{coloured}} with poor-quality dyes made from the woad plant. Blue played no part in the rich costumes of the clergy or the architecture or decoration of churches. This changed dramatically between 1130 and 1140 in Paris, when the Abbe Suger rebuilt the Saint Denis Basilica. He installed stained glass windows coloured with cobalt, which, combined with {{the light from the}} red <b>glass,</b> <b>filled</b> the church with a bluish violet light. The church became the marvel of the Christian world, and the colour became known as the [...] "bleu de Saint-Denis". In the years that followed even more elegant blue stained glass windows were installed in other churches, including at Chartres Cathedral and Sainte-Chapelle in Paris.|$|E

2500|$|The {{traditional}} French preparation involves {{placing a}} sugar cube {{on top of}} a specially designed slotted spoon, and placing the spoon on a <b>glass</b> <b>filled</b> with a measure of absinthe. Iced water is poured or dripped over the sugar cube to mix the water into the absinthe. The final preparation contains 1 part absinthe and 3-5 parts water. As water dilutes the spirit, those components with poor water solubility (mainly those from anise, fennel, and star anise) come out of solution and cloud the drink. The resulting milky opalescence is called the [...] (Fr. opaque or shady, IPA [...] ). The release of these dissolved essences coincides with a perfuming of herbal aromas and flavours that [...] "blossom" [...] or [...] "bloom," [...] and brings out subtleties that are otherwise muted within the neat spirit. This reflects what is perhaps the oldest and purest method of preparation, and {{is often referred to as}} the French Method.|$|E
2500|$|Kocher {{notes that}} Tolkien's {{literary}} techniques {{require us to}} increasingly view hobbits as like us, especially when placed under moral pressure to survive a war that threatens to devastate their land. Frodo becomes {{in some ways the}} symbolic representation of the conscience of hobbits, a point made explicitly in the story [...] "Leaf by Niggle" [...] which Tolkien wrote {{at the same time as}} the first nine chapters of The Lord of the Rings. Niggle is a painter struggling against the summons of death to complete his one great canvas, a picture of a tree with a background of forest and distant mountains. He dies with the work incomplete, undone by his imperfectly generous heart: [...] "it made him uncomfortable more often than it made him do anything". After discipline in Purgatory, however, Niggle finds himself in the very landscape depicted by his painting which he is now able to finish with the assistance of a neighbour who obstructed him during life. The picture complete, Niggle is free to journey to the distant mountains which represent the highest stage of his spiritual development. Thus, upon recovery from the wound inflicted by Angmar on Weathertop, Gandalf speculates that the hobbit Frodo [...] "may become like a <b>glass</b> <b>filled</b> with a clear light for eyes to see that can". Similarly, as Frodo nears Mount Doom he casts aside weapons and refuses to fight others with physical force: [...] "For him struggles for the right must hereafter be waged only on the moral plane." ...|$|E

50|$|There is a {{drinking}} game based on Russian roulette. The game involves six shot <b>glasses</b> <b>filled</b> by a non-player. Five {{are filled with}} water, the sixth with vodka. Among some groups, low quality vodka is preferred as it makes the <b>glass</b> representing the <b>filled</b> chamber less desirable. The glasses are arranged in a circle, and players take turns choosing a glass {{to take a shot}} from at random.|$|R

60|$|And Israel {{departed}} for the Pont Neuf. Succeeding in his errand thither, {{he returned to}} Dr. Franklin, and found that worthy envoy waiting his attendance at a meal, which, according to the Doctor's custom, had been sent from a neighboring restaurant.

A decanter-like bottle of uncolored <b>glass,</b> <b>filled</b> with some uncolored beverage, stood at the venerable envoy's elbow.|$|E

60|$|Next evening Dick {{went to see}} Bethune {{and found}} him lying in a hammock hung between the posts of the veranda of his {{galvanized}} iron hut.

60|$|He {{shook the}} door-knob of a {{bungalow}} so new that laths and mortar were still {{scattered about the}} yard. The door was locked. He tried the windows as well. But {{he could not get}} in. Three other bungalows they tried, and the fourth, the last of the row, was already occupied. But they did steal up on the porch of one bungalow, and they exclaimed like children when they beheld the big living-room, the huge fireplace, the built-in shelves and, beyond the living-room, what seemed to be the dining-room, with an enormous chandelier which may not, perhaps, have been of the delicate reticence of a silver candlestick, but whose jags and blobs of ruby and emerald and purple <b>glass</b> <b>filled</b> their hearts with awe.|$|E
