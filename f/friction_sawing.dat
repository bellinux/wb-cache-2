50|$|The {{popularity}} of cold saw blades is increasing {{due to the}} technological advancements in cold saw machines. They are the sawing method of choice when high production requirements are needed. They consistently produce the lowest cost per cut among all sawing methods: hot sawing, <b>friction</b> <b>sawing,</b> bandsawing and hacksawing.|$|E
40|$|This work {{deals with}} the issue of defects {{generation}} during the separation of the castings from a nickel-based superalloy, Inconel 738 LC. The technology of investment casting is presented, followed by a description of metallurgy of superalloys, their physical and mechanical properties, as well as their technical applications. The machinability of superalloys and method of castings separation were also described {{as well as some of}} the casting defects that were reported to have impact on the generation of the defects after cutting. In the experimental part, the material microstructure and casting defects were analyzed. The experimental machining part consisted first of a comparative study of the <b>friction</b> <b>sawing</b> and plasma arc cutting technology at the standard operating conditions actually used in production. Second, an optimization study for the <b>friction</b> <b>sawing</b> was carried out, with a special focus on the suitability of an alternative cutoff wheel for the chosen application. Application of this wheel allows reducing the security distance between the cut and the part, thus reducing the production cost of the part...|$|E
50|$|Operation <b>Friction</b> <b>saw</b> {{approximately}} 4,500 CF personnel {{deployed to}} the Persian Gulf from August 1990 - February 1991 with a peak deployment of 2,700 personnel during the Gulf War in January 1991.|$|R
5000|$|Operation <b>Friction</b> {{initially}} <b>saw</b> MARCOM {{order the}} destroyers [...] and [...] {{to assist with}} enforcing the United Nations trade blockade against Iraq. The supply ship [...] was deployed with the destroyers to provide underway replenishment as well as command/control and at-sea medical services to the small task force which operated in the Persian Gulf, Straits of Hormuz and Gulf of Oman.|$|R
50|$|His reign, however, also <b>saw</b> <b>friction</b> {{between the}} County of Savoy and the Duchy of Austria. He pursued an {{alliance}} with the Kingdom of France and received Maulévrier in Normandy {{as a result of}} initial good relations.|$|R
50|$|The name carbide saw {{came from}} the tool, a {{circular}} saw blade, with silver soldered carbide tips. It competed with and just about replaced, solid or segmental HSS blades, because carbide is much harder than HSS. Before HSS saws were developed, abrasive, <b>friction</b> or hot <b>saws</b> were used and are still manufactured for certain applications. These processes create heat and are therefore called hot saws. However, HSS blades use coolant and the cut surfaces don’t get hot, thus called cold saws. With the unique geometry of the teeth of carbide circular saws, the heat, developed by the cutting process is transferred into the chips and carried away with the chips. The cut surfaces stay cool. Therefore, carbide saws were also called cold saws. Other names include cold cut saws, cold circular saws, cold cut off saws or circular cold saws.|$|R
50|$|Hawke's Prime Ministership <b>saw</b> <b>friction</b> {{between himself}} and the {{grassroots}} of the Labor Party, who were unhappy at what they viewed as Hawke's iconoclasm and willingness to co-operate with business interests. The Socialist Left faction, as well as prominent Labor figure Barry Jones, offered severe criticism of a number of government decisions. He has also received criticism for his 'confrontationalist style' in siding with the airlines in the 1989 Australian pilots' strike. The Hawke Government did, however, significantly increase the social wage as part of its Accord with the trade unions, a social democratic policy continued by the Keating Government. Improvements to the social wage included improved affordability of and access to key services such as health and child-care and health, together with large increases to payments for low-wage and jobless families with children. Indexation of child payments was also introduced, while coverage of occupational superannuation pensions was also widened significantly, from 46% of employees in 1985 to 79% in 1991.|$|R
