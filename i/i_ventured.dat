[...] Morrison described it as [...] "one of those songs {{where you can see}} {{the light at the end}} of the tunnel... I don't think I can elaborate on it any more than that." [...] The words in the song: [...] "Talkin' to Huddie Ledbetter/Showin' pictures on the wall" [...] appear to be based on Morrison's real life custom of carrying around a poster of Lead Belly and hanging it on the wall wherever he lived. (This was revealed in a Rolling Stone interview in 1978.) ...|$|E
500|$|A {{correspondent}} from The Daily Telegraph visited Ellen about 22months {{after she}} fell ill. He wrote:The girl's face {{is by no}} means cadaverous. There is flesh on the cheeks, which have a pinkish tint, and there is some colour in the thin lips. The eyes are calmly closed, as though in healthy sleep. <b>I</b> <b>ventured</b> to raise one of the lids and touch the eye beneath... but there was not even a quivering of the eyelash.... The girl's [...] was quite warm and moist, and the finger nails were neatly trimmed. The fingers are not the least bit stiffened... It is not a skeleton hand, neither are any of the girl's limbs so emaciated as, under the extraordinary circumstances alleged, might be expected.... The child's body is very thin as compared with her limbs.... There is not much substance in her flesh, however; it is soft and flabby... almost ice-cold.... As regards the child's breathing, it is so feeble that {{it is almost impossible to}} detect it; you cannot feel it by holding the cheek to her mouth, and the only faintest flutter is felt when the hand is laid over the region of the heart.|$|E

"My {{own people}} {{condemned}} my action (performing Koothu and Kutiyattam outside the precincts of the temples), Once, after I had given performances at Vaikom, they {{even thought about}} excommunicating me.

2500|$|... 'More {{than three}} years ago <b>I</b> <b>ventured</b> during a debate in the House of Commons on the Irish land question, to predict that if the {{proposal}} then before the House to deprive the landlords of the power of eviction and rack-renting – that is to say the proposal in favour of fixity of tenure at fair rents – was not accepted, the Irish people would rise up and protest against the institution of landlordism, root and branch, and demand its abolition.' ...|$|E
2500|$|When Newman {{died there}} {{appeared}} in a monthly magazine a series of very unflattering sketches by one who had lived under his roof. <b>I</b> <b>ventured</b> to ask Cardinal Manning if he had seen these sketches. He replied that he had and thought them very shocking; the writer must have a very unenviable mind, , and then, having thus sacrificed to propriety, after a moment's pause he added: [...] "But {{if you ask me}} if they are like poor Newman, I am bound to say – a photograph." ...|$|E

[...] "I get off on working with creative energy", Aguilera said. [...] "That's when I'm most at home and feel happiest. And all these people brought about new sides of me. It was a big collaboration-fest, and it felt so good and rewarding in the end, because I was just so happy with the work and the new territories that <b>I</b> <b>ventured</b> out to." [...] Aguilera also remarked that her son inspired her to experiment in ways [...] "that maybe I've been afraid {{to do in the}} past, to allow myself to go to a place of 'less singing,' [...] " [...] she says. [...] " [...] is just about the future – my son in my life, motivating me to want to play and have fun." ...|$|E
