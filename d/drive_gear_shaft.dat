Some defects were found from the test, such as oversized impact of hyperboloidal gear pair, eccentricity of <b>drive</b> <b>gear</b> <b>shaft,</b> and poor roughness of tooth face. Several improvement measures were put forward and confirmed by bench test. The results indicate that noise reduced greatly, thus the improvement measures are effective and positive. ...|$|E

The AC motor is turned at an accurate rate by the alternating current, which power companies carefully regulate. <b>Gears</b> <b>drive</b> a <b>shaft</b> at the desired rate, {{and turn the}} cam.

50|$|One of {{the common}} early {{problems}} was with the clutch basket which was eventually replaced under warranty. The intermediate gear was strengthened and concentricity improved. However, the problem then moved to the next weakest part, the alternator <b>drive</b> shaft/Z25 <b>gear,</b> which, in extreme cases could break at a lubrication hole. It commonly manifested itself in the 1130 variant of the engine, as a difficulty {{to crank the engine}} when hot. The root cause of the clutch / alternator drive problem was thermal expansion, which reduced the Z25 / intermediate gear clearances to negative. The solution was to improve the concentricity of both the clutch intermediate and alternator <b>drive</b> <b>shaft</b> <b>gears,</b> and increase their clearance. At the same time, the alternator drive hub fastening method was changed from a lock washer to a belleville washer to stop the bolt from working loose due to heat cycling.|$|R
50|$|The first road {{locomotives}} {{started to}} emerge from the St Nicholas works in the late 1870s, with 14 engines specifically designed for the job of road haulage produced between 1878 and 1890. Following the changes to the Locomotive Act and Locomotive on Highways in 1896 the market for Road Locomotives expanded considerably. Charles Burrell & Sons Road Locomotives were slightly modified versions of their general-purpose engines to allow for faster rates of travel over long journeys. A general-purpose engine was designed to spend much of its life stationary, powering belt-driven equipment, whereas a road locomotive was constantly on the move, therefore subtle design differences were needed. These modifications included stronger <b>drive</b> <b>shafts,</b> <b>gears</b> and wheels; additional water-carrying capacity; generally a canopy was fitted; solid flywheels and additional platework around the engine's cylinder motion.|$|R

40|$|AbstractThe 17 CrNiMo 6 {{steel is}} mainly {{used for the}} <b>gear</b> <b>shaft</b> of large modulus in many fields of heavy {{industry}} such as mining, transit, hoist, forging and so on[1]. The size of addendum circle and common normal line is changed a lot beyond the tolerance because of the long time of carburizing process and the out-of-step structural stress and thermal stress during the quenching process. And thus the posterior grinding efficiency and quality are influenced. In the paper comparison {{and analysis of the}} deformation affected by solid and hollow <b>gear</b> <b>shafts</b> were done and the methods of simulation and practice were both used. The results are as follows: the deformation of <b>gear</b> <b>shaft</b> was small before and after carburizing while that of <b>gear</b> <b>shaft</b> was large before and after quenching because of different cooling velocity, structure and hardness of each position. And the deformation of hollow was much smaller than that of solid.

40|$|Abstract. This paper takes a helical <b>gear</b> <b>shaft</b> as {{research}} subject and discusses the main structural parameters {{to see how}} it would affect natural frequency sensitivity. The parametrical model of helical <b>gear</b> <b>shaft</b> is created by using software PROE 3. 0. The natural frequencies and vibration shapes are calculated by the modal analysis. The relationship between the structural parameters and the natural frequency sensitivity can be obtained by means of ANSYS. The result shows that the structural parameters can affect the natural frequency sensitivity. The variation in low order natural frequency is similar to that in high order natural frequency. The effect of module on the natural frequency sensitivity is more remarkable comparing with pressure angle, modification coefficient and helical angle. Selecting structural parameters reasonably may reduce vibration and noise of the helical <b>gear</b> <b>shaft</b> effectively...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{results of}} laboratory tests that {{were aimed at}} detecting early stages of various faults in toothed wheels by measurement and analysis of transverse vibration speed of the transmission <b>gear</b> <b>shafts.</b> In experimental investigation, cracking of the root tooth and chipping of the tooth were detected. The laser vibrometer Ometron VH 300 + was used for non-contact measurement of shaft transversal vibration speed. Gear vibrations were recorded in selected points of gear housing and <b>gear</b> <b>shafts</b> at different speeds and gear loads. Results were analyzed and compared but in this paper is presented only selected examples. This paper shows that {{on the basis of}} the transverse vibration speed of transmission <b>gear</b> <b>shafts,</b> it is possible to detect defects at an earlier stage than {{on the basis of the}} housing vibration accelerations. In the case of measuring <b>gear</b> <b>shaft</b> vibration velocity, the way of the signal generated by the defect of a gear wheel (or bearing) is shortened as well as the influence of composed transmittance of the bearing-gear housing system is eliminated.
