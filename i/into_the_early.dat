5|$|By {{the end of}} the 1990s and <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>early</b> 2000s {{pop music}} {{consisted}} mostly of a combination of pop-hip hop and R pop, including a number of boy bands. Notable female singers also cemented their status in American and worldwide popular music, such as Beyoncé (with her solo career and as lead singer of Destiny's Child), Britney Spears, Christina Aguilera, Katy Perry, Lady Gaga and Taylor Swift. Also notable was the influence of hip-hop producers on popular music in the mid-late 2000s, including the Neptunes and Timbaland, who made the sounds first heard on Justin Timberlake's FutureSex/LoveSounds and Nelly Furtado's Loose imitated throughout popular radio with artists Madonna, Akon and Lady Gaga.

5|$|A highway roughly {{parallel}} to the modern I-275 was included in early planning maps for the Interstate Highway System in the 1950s.

Some plans in the 1970s had the northern Novi–Davisburg section numbered as a state highway M-275. The southern half of I-275 was built in segments that were completed in January 1977. Later that month, the state canceled the northern section because of local opposition. A later attempt to revive the proposal failed in 1979. Additional plans to complete M-275 through Oakland County were kept on the drawing boards through the 1980s, but failed to materialize. M-5 (Haggerty Connector) opened along part of the former I-275/M-275 right-of-way between 1994 and 2000.|$|E

However, similarities were often observed between aetosaurs and Crocodilia, the group to which aetosaurs were initially referred in the 19th century.
