40|$|Background: This paper {{presents}} the outcomes from a workshop of the European Network on the Health and Environmental Impact of Nanomaterials (NanoImpactNet) held in June 2008. During this workshop 45 {{experts in the}} field of safety assessment of <b>engineered</b> <b>nanomaterials</b> from academia, non-profit organizations and industry addressed a list of essential metrics of <b>engineered</b> <b>nanomaterials</b> that need to be characterized as a minimum. Results: The group discussed the need to systematically study sets of <b>engineered</b> <b>nanomaterials</b> to generate a dataset that allows for the establishment of dose-response data related to specific metrics of <b>engineered</b> <b>nanomaterials.</b> Concomitantly the availability of analytical methods to determine the physicochemical characteristics was discussed. Given the measurement challenges specific for <b>engineered</b> <b>nanomaterials</b> the issue of harmonizing protocols was raised. Conclusion: The group concluded that international cooperation and worldwide standardization of terminology, reference materials and protocols are needed to make progress in establishing lists of essential metrics. The need for high quality data necessitates the development of harmonized study approaches and adequate reporting of data. Priority metrics can only be based on well-characterized dose-response relations (as regards biological interactions and physiochemical characteristics) of <b>engineered</b> <b>nanomaterials.</b> This requires the systematic study of the biokinetics and biointeractions of nanomaterials at both organism and (sub) cellular levels.

40|$|Products {{based on}} {{nanotechnology}} are rapidly {{emerging in the}} marketplace, sometimes with little notice to consumers of their nanotechnology pedigree. This wide variety of nanotechnology products will result (in some cases) in unintentional human exposure to purposely engineered nanoscale materials via the dermal, inhalation, ingestion, and ocular pathways. Occupational, consumer, and environmental exposure to the nanomaterials should be characterized during the entire product lifecycle—manufacture, use, and disposal. Monitoring the fate and transport of <b>engineered</b> <b>nanomaterials</b> {{is complicated by the}} lack of detection techniques and the lack of a defined set of standardized metrics to be consistently measured. New exposure metrics may be required for <b>engineered</b> <b>nanomaterials,</b> but progress is possible by building on existing tools.

Nanomaterial toxicity was assessed in ten representative cell lines.

Results from heterogeneous and chemically identical particles suggested that surface chemistry, surface coating and chemical composition are likely determinants of nanomaterial toxicity.

40|$|Owing {{to their}} {{antimicrobial}} properties, silver nanoparticles (NPs) {{are the most}} commonly used <b>engineered</b> <b>nanomaterial</b> for use in a wide array of consumer and medical applications. Many discussions are currently ongoing {{as to whether or not}} exposure of silver NPs to the ecosystem (i. e. plants and animals) may be conceived as harmful or not. Metallic silver, if released into the environment, can undergo chemical and biochemical conversion which strongly influence its availability towards any biological system. During this process, in the presence of moisture, silver can be oxidized resulting in the release of silver ions. To date, it is still debatable as to whether any biological impact of nanosized silver is relative to either its size, or to its ionic constitution. The aim of this review therefore is to provide a comprehensive, interdisciplinary overview [...] for biologists, chemists, toxicologists as well as physicists [...] regarding the production of silver NPs, its (as well as in their ionic form) chemical and biochemical behaviours towards/within a multitude of relative and realistic biological environments and also how such interactions may be correlated across a plethora of different biological organisms...|$|E
40|$|<b>Engineered</b> <b>nanomaterial</b> {{emission}} {{and exposure}} characterization {{studies have been}} completed at more than 60 different facilities by the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH). These experiences have provided NIOSH the opportunity to refine an earlier published technique, the Nanoparticle Emission Assessment Technique (NEAT 1. 0), into a more comprehensive technique for assessing worker and workplace exposures to engineered nanomaterials. This change {{is reflected in the}} new name Nanomaterial Exposure Assessment Technique (NEAT 2. 0) which distinguishes it from NEAT 1. 0. NEAT 2. 0 places a stronger emphasis on time-integrated, filter-based sampling (i. e., elemental mass analysis and particle morphology) in the worker's breathing zone (full shift and task specific) and area samples to develop job exposure matrices. NEAT 2. 0 includes a comprehensive assessment of emissions at processes and job tasks, using direct-reading instruments (i. e., particle counters) in data-logging mode to better understand peak emission periods. Evaluation of worker practices, ventilation efficacy, and other engineering exposure control systems and risk management strategies serve to allow for a comprehensive exposure assessment.

40|$|In {{spite of}} the still {{increasing}} number of <b>engineered</b> <b>nanomaterial</b> (ENM) applications, large knowledge gaps exist {{with respect to their}} environmental fate, especially after release into air. This review aims to summarize the current knowledge of emissions and behavior of airborne engineered nanomaterials. The whole ENM lifecycle is considered from the perspective of possible releases into the atmosphere. Although in general, emissions during use phase and end-of-life seem to play a minor role compared to entry into soil and water, accidental and continuous emissions into air can occur especially during production and some use cases such as spray application. Implications of ENMs on the atmosphere as e. g.; photo-catalytic properties or the production of reactive oxygen species are reviewed as well as the influence of physical processes and chemical reactions on the ENMs. Experimental studies and different modeling approaches regarding atmospheric transformation and removal are summarized. Some information exists especially for ENMs, but many issues can only be addressed by using data from ultrafine particles as a substitute and research on the specific implications of ENMs in the atmosphere is still needed. © 2017 by the authors...|$|E

30|$|Therefore, to {{contrive}} nanomaterials for biomedical applications, {{it is imperative}} to rationally <b>engineer</b> <b>nanomaterials</b> with controlled physicochemical properties to dictate nano-bio interface toward desired interactions to achieve highest level of safety with better functionality, sensitivity, efficiency and specificity. Moreover, basic understanding of nano-bio interfacial interactions between <b>engineered</b> <b>nanomaterials</b> and biological objects will allow predictive relationships at the nano-bio interface. Such predictive interactions are essential for the perspective of further development of designing strategies and safe usage of nanomaterials [53 – 55]. From the discussion, it can be established that prior to utilizing nanomaterials in the field of medicine or biology, the effects of nanomaterials must be anticipatable and defined, and nanomaterials must exhibit desired therapeutic outcomes without or negligible cytotoxicity.|$|R

Despite the fantastic potential, a number of research on the toxicological impact of <b>engineered</b> <b>nanomaterials</b> have also been performed on the plants and its surrounding environment [6 – 8] because thousands of tons of <b>engineered</b> <b>nanomaterials</b> are calculated to be released into air, water and soil [9]. The bioavailability and cytoxicity of nanoparticles depend on their shape, size, concentration and mobility in the aqueous medium [10 – 12].|$|R
40|$|The {{evaluation}} of <b>engineered</b> <b>nanomaterial</b> safety has been hindered by conflicting reports demonstrating differential degrees of toxicity {{with the same}} nanoparticles. The unique properties of these materials {{increase the likelihood that}} they will interfere with analytical techniques, which may contribute to this phenomenon. We tested the potential for: 1) nanoparticle intrinsic fluorescence/absorbance, 2) interactions between nanoparticles and assay components, and 3) the effects of adding both nanoparticles and analytes to an assay, to interfere with the accurate assessment of toxicity. Silicon, cadmium selenide, titanium dioxide, and helical rosette nanotubes each affected {{at least one of the}} six assays tested, resulting in either substantial over- or under-estimations of toxicity. Simulation of realistic assay conditions revealed that interference could not be predicted solely by interactions between nanoparticles and assay components. Moreover, the nature and degree of interference cannot be predicted solely based on our current understanding of nanomaterial behaviour. A literature survey indicated that ca. 95 % of papers from 2010 using biochemical techniques to assess nanotoxicity did not account for potential interference of nanoparticles, and this number had not substantially improved in 2012. We provide guidance on avoiding and/or controlling for such interference to improve the accuracy of nanotoxicit...|$|E
40|$|The early {{incorporation}} of exposure assessment can be invaluable to help design, prioritize, and interpret toxicological studies or outcomes.

With regard to <b>engineered</b> <b>nanomaterial</b> inhalation toxicology in particular, a single type of material (e. g. carbon nanotube, graphene) can have {{a vast array of}} physicochemical characteristics resulting in the potential for varying toxicities. To compound the matter, the methodologies necessary to establish a material adequate for in vivo exposure testing raises questions on the applicability of the outcomes. From insights gained from evaluating carbon nanotubes, we recommend the following integrated approach involving exposure-informed hazard assessment and hazard-informed exposure assessment especially for materials as diverse as engineered nanomaterials: 1) market-informed identification of potential hazards and potentially exposed populations, 2) initial toxicity screening to drive prioritized assessments of exposure, 3) development of exposure assessment-informed chronic and sub-chronic in vivo studies, and 4) conduct of exposure- and hazard-informed epidemiological studies.

40|$|<b>Engineered</b> <b>nanomaterial</b> (ENM) -mediated {{toxicity}} {{often involves}} triggering immune responses. Mast cells can regulate both innate and adaptive immune responses and are key effectors in allergic diseases and inflammation. Silver nanoparticles (AgNPs) {{are one of}} the most prevalent nanomaterials used in consumer products due to their antimicrobial properties. We have previously shown that AgNPs induce mast cell degranulation that was dependent on nanoparticle physicochemical properties. Furthermore, we identified a role for scavenger receptor B 1 (SR-B 1) in AgNP-mediated mast cell degranulation. However, it is completely unknown how SR-B 1 mediates mast cell degranulation and the intracellular signaling pathways involved. In the current study, we hypothesized that SR-B 1 interaction with AgNPs directs mast cell degranulation through activation of signal transduction pathways that culminate in an increase in intracellular calcium signal leading to mast cell degranulation. For these studies, we utilized bone marrow-derived mast cells (BMMC) isolated from C 57 Bl/ 6 mice and RBL- 2 H 3 cells (rat basophilic leukemia cell line). Our data support our hypothesis and show that AgNP-directed mast cell degranulation involves activation of PI 3 K, PLCγ and an increase in intracellular calcium levels. Moreover, we found that influx of extracellular calcium is required for the cells to degranulate in response to AgNP exposure and is mediated at least partially via the CRAC channels. Taken together, our results provide new insights into AgNP-induced mast cell activation that are key for designing novel ENMs that are devoid of immune system activation...|$|E
