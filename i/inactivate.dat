5|$|Irreversible {{inhibition}} {{is different}} from irreversible enzyme inactivation. Irreversible inhibitors are generally specific for one class of enzyme and do not <b>inactivate</b> all proteins; they do not function by destroying protein structure but by specifically altering the active site of their target. For example, extremes of pH or temperature usually cause denaturation of all protein structure, {{but this is a}} non-specific effect. Similarly, some non-specific chemical treatments destroy protein structure: for example, heating in concentrated hydrochloric acid will hydrolyse the peptide bonds holding proteins together, releasing free amino acids.|$|E
5|$|Suicide {{inhibition}} is {{an unusual}} type of irreversible inhibition where the enzyme converts the inhibitor into a reactive form in its active site. An example is the inhibitor of polyamine biosynthesis, α-difluoromethylornithine or DFMO, which is an analogue of the amino acid ornithine, and is used to treat African trypanosomiasis (sleeping sickness). Ornithine decarboxylase can catalyse the decarboxylation of DFMO instead of ornithine, as shown above. However, this decarboxylation reaction {{is followed by the}} elimination of a fluorine atom, which converts this catalytic intermediate into a conjugated imine, a highly electrophilic species. This reactive form of DFMO then reacts with either a cysteine or lysine residue in the active site to irreversibly <b>inactivate</b> the enzyme.|$|E
5|$|In 1991 the Base Realignment and Closure Commission {{recommended}} {{the closing of}} Fort Ord due to the escalating cost of living on the Central California coastline.

The 2nd Brigade, to include its Headquarters and Headquarters Company along with the 3rd Brigade's 3rd Battalion 17th Infantry Regiment and other assigned military police companies participated in one final mission in the United States before inactivation; quelling the 1992 Los Angeles Riots, called Operation Garden Plot. In 1993 the division was slated to move to Fort Lewis, WA and <b>inactivate</b> {{as part of the}} post-Cold War drawdown of the US Army, but the 2nd and 3rd Brigades of the 7th inactivated at Ft.

40|$|The termostable direct hemolysin of Vibrio parahaemolyticus is <b>inactivated</b> by heating {{at around}} 55 C with an <b>inactivating</b> factor {{isolated}} from culture filtrates of V. parahaemolyticus. The {{characteristics of the}} temperature-dependent <b>inactivating</b> factor were studied by using polyacrylamide gel disc electrophoresis. It was found that when heated with the hemolysin, the <b>inactivating</b> factor destroyed the hemolysin and thus <b>inactivated</b> the hemolytic activity, suggesting that the <b>inactivating</b> factor has proteolytic activity. It was also demonstrated that the <b>inactivating</b> factor itself is heat labile, losing its activity on heating with the hemolysin at 95 C for 15 min. The <b>inactivating</b> factor was stimulated {{by the presence of}} NaCl or MgCl 2 and showed maximal activity at around pH 8. 0. The results support our previous hypothesis that the Arrhenius effect observed with crude hemolysin of V. parahaemolyticus is due to the presence of a temperature-dependent <b>inactivating</b> factor. The fact that the factor is activated on heating at 50 to 60 C but is <b>inactivated</b> on heating at 70 to 100 C explains the Arrheius effect of crude hemolysin of V. parahaemolyticus...|$|R
5|$|Most {{bacteria}} {{enter the}} lungs via small aspirations of organisms {{residing in the}} throat or nose. Half of normal people have these small aspirations during sleep. While the throat always contains bacteria, potentially infectious ones reside there only at certain times and under certain conditions. A minority of types of bacteria such as Mycobacterium tuberculosis and Legionella pneumophila reach the lungs via contaminated airborne droplets. Bacteria can spread also via the blood. Once in the lungs, bacteria may invade the spaces between cells and between alveoli, where the macrophages and neutrophils (defensive white blood cells) attempt to <b>inactivate</b> the bacteria. The neutrophils also release cytokines, causing a general activation of the immune system. This leads to the fever, chills, and fatigue common in bacterial pneumonia. The neutrophils, bacteria, and fluid from surrounding blood vessels fill the alveoli, resulting in the consolidation seen on chest X-ray.|$|E
5|$|People with Birt–Hogg–Dubé {{syndrome}} {{are born}} with one mutated copy of the FLCN gene in each cell. Haploinsufficiency—only having one functional copy of the FLCN gene—is enough to cause the fibrofolliculomas and pulmonary cysts, however, one copy of the gene is enough to keep kidney cells in check. During their lifetime, random mutations might <b>inactivate</b> the normal copy of the gene in a subset of cells. When this occurs, {{the result is that}} these cells have no functional copies of the FLCN gene, allowing the cells grow out of control. This loss of heterozygosity is a common mechanism in cancer, and it is frequently detected in the renal cancers associated with BHD. The molecular genetic defects in renal tumors of people with BHD are different from two other similar kidney tumors, chromophobe renal cell carcinoma and renal oncocytoma. BHD-associated tumorigenesis differs between the kidney, where loss of FLCN heterozygosity is responsible for cancers, and the skin, where FLCN is strongly expressed in heterozygotes. FLCN {{has been found to be}} overexpressed in fibrofolliculoma tissue and to have very low levels of expression in affected kidneys. Furthermore, the mTOR pathway is shown to be activated in tumor tissue from both humans and mice.|$|E
5|$|Redback {{antivenom}} {{was developed}} by Commonwealth Serum Laboratories, then a government body involved with discovering antivenoms for many venomous Australian creatures. Production involves the milking of venom from redbacks and repeatedly inoculating horses with non-lethal doses. The horse immune systems makes polyclonal antibodies. Blood plasma, containing the antibodies, is extracted by plasmapheresis. The plasma is treated with pepsin, and the active F(ab')2 fragments are separated and purified. Each vial contains 500 units of redback antivenom in approximately 1.5 ml, which is enough to <b>inactivate</b> 5mg of redback spider venom in a test tube. The antivenom has been safely administered to women {{in various stages of}} pregnancy. Redback antivenom has been widely used in Australia since 1956, although evidence from controlled studies for its effectiveness has been lacking. Recent trials show antivenom has a low response rate little better than placebo, and any effect is less than might be achieved with optimal use of standard analgesics. Further studies are needed to confirm or refute its effectiveness. It appears clinically active against arachnidism caused by Steatoda spiders; however, as these cases are often mild and the evidence of its effectiveness is limited, this treatment is not recommended. Similarly, the antivenom has been reported as effective with bites of L. katipo, and L. tredecimguttatus. Animal studies also support its use against envenomation from other widow spiders, having successfully been tested against venom from L. mactans, L. hesperus, and L. tredecimguttatus (synonym L.lugubris).|$|E

40|$|Porcine {{reproductive}} {{and respiratory}} syndrome (PRRS) causes significant economic losses to the swine industry worldwide. Although <b>inactivated</b> and live vaccines are commercially {{available for the}} control of PRRS, both types of vaccine have not always proven successful in terms of generating a protective immune response, {{particularly in the case}} of <b>inactivated</b> vaccines. In this study, we tested whether an <b>inactivated</b> vaccine could induce a humoral immune response to PRRS during a homologous challenge. Amino acid substitutions were introduced into glycoprotein (GP) 5 of the FL 12 strain of the PRRS virus (PRRSV) using site-directed mutagenesis with a pFL 12 infectious clone. The substitutions led to double deglycosylation in the putative glycosylation moieties on GP 5. The mutant virus was subsequently <b>inactivated</b> with binary ethylenimine. The efficacy of the <b>inactivated</b> mutant virus was compared with that of the <b>inactivated</b> wild-type PRRSV. Only the <b>inactivated</b> mutant PRRSV induced serum neutralizing antibodies at six weeks post-vaccination. The group that was administered the <b>inactivated</b> mutant virus twice exhibited a significantly increased neutralizing antibody titer after a challenge with the virulent homologous strain and exhibited more rapid clearing of viremia compared to other groups, including the groups that were administered either the <b>inactivated</b> mutant or wild-type virus only once and the group that was administered the <b>inactivated</b> wild-type virus twice. Histopathological examination of lung tissue sections revealed that the group that was administered the <b>inactivated</b> mutant virus twice exhibited significantly thinner alveolar septa, whereas the thickness of the alveolar septa of the other groups were markedly increased due to lymphocyte infiltration. These results indicated that the deglycosylation of GP 5 enhanced the immunogenicity of the <b>inactivated</b> mutant PRRSV and that twice administrations of the <b>inactivated</b> mutant virus conferred better protection against the homologous challenge. These findings suggest that the <b>inactivated</b> PRRSV that expresses a hypo-glycosylated GP 5 is a potential <b>inactivated</b> vaccine candidate and a valuable tool for controlling PRRS for the swine industry...|$|R
