40|$|Although {{several studies}} show that inward foreign direct {{investment}} often leads to greater host country productivity, researchers have yet to determine {{the relative importance of}} direct technology transfer and competitive pressure. To assess the relative importance of the two channels, we examine the U. S. auto-component industry between 1979 and 1991. During this period, Japanese automobile assemblers began to produce vehicles in North American and began to purchase inputs from U. S. auto-component manufacturers. Those U. S. manufacturers that sold components to Japanese transplants would be the direct recipients of any technologies transferred from the Japanese. Although we find that the direct investment by Japanese assemblers was associated with overall productivity improvement in the U. S. auto-component industry, we find little evidence of direct technology transfer. The productivity growth of U. <b>S.</b> <b>suppliers</b> affiliated with Japanese assemblers was no greater than other non-affiliated U. <b>S.</b> <b>suppliers.</b> Further, we find that the Japanese assemblers tended to purchase components from less productive U. <b>S.</b> <b>suppliers</b> and, moreover, that low productivity suppliers that sold goods to Japanese assemblers had a higher survival rate than low productivity suppliers that did not sell t...|$|R

40|$|This article {{presents}} the results of a questionnaire survey sent to a sample of automobile manufacturers in the United States and Japan (including Japanese-managed plants in the United States) during the spring of 1990. The data support observations that Japanese and U. S. practices tend to differ in key areas and Japanese suppliers perform better in dimensions such as quality (defects) and prices (meeting targets, reducing prices over time); and that Japanese-managed auto plants established in the United States have, in general, adopted Japanese practices and receive extremely high levels of quality from Japanese as well as U. <b>S.</b> <b>suppliers.</b> These findings provide evidence that Japanese practices and performance levels are transferable outside Japan and suggest that considerable improvements are possible for U. <b>S.</b> <b>suppliers</b> supplying U. <b>S.</b> auto plants. In addition, the survey indicates that U.

40|$|In {{this paper}} {{we examine the}} {{determinants}} of supplier trust in the buyer in 453 supplier-automaker relationships in the U. S., Japan, and Korea. We define trust and derive a model of its determinants drawing upon (1) an embeddedness (relationship-based) perspective, (2) a processbased perspective, and an (3) economic (hostage-based) perspective. Our findings indicate {{strong support for the}} process-based perspective in all countries; embeddedness (e. g., length of relationship) was only important as a determinant of trust in Japan, and the hostage-based variable (stock ownership) was not important in any country. More specifically, we found that high supplier trust emerges when (1) automakers have developed supplier-selection routines that favor incumbents and which maintain a continuing (repeated) exchange relationship with the supplier, and (2) automakers have developed assistance-giving routines to help suppliers solve problems and improve. Although there were some differences across institutional environments, notably higher trust in Japan, the findings are quite robust across the institutional environments. Indeed, in a sample of U. <b>S.</b> <b>suppliers</b> selling to both U. S. and Japanese automakers in the United States, we found that Japanese automakers were more effective than U. S. automakers at building trusting relations with U. <b>S.</b> <b>suppliers.</b> The ability of Japanese automakers to build high levels of trust with suppliers in the United States suggests that the institutional environment may be less important than firm-level practices in the production of inter-organizational trust...|$|R
