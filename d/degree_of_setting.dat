Furthermore, the {{relationship}} <b>of</b> the <b>degree</b> <b>of</b> <b>set</b> and dimensional stability is analyzed. After relaxation treatments, the yarns in a fabric would be set at a certain level. As the fabric is subjected to prolonged relaxation treatments, the yarn will become more set until {{the shape of the}} unraveled yarn is similar to the shape of the loop in the fabric. The yarn that is removed from a knitted fabric has a curvature value close to zero, and the curvature is exactly as the corresponding position at the knitted loop. From previous research, it is known that the <b>degree</b> <b>of</b> <b>set</b> affects the dimensional properties in a plain knitted fabric. In this article, the <b>degree</b> <b>of</b> <b>set</b> increases with resin level. It explains why the resin finish can stabilize the dimensional properties indirectly.
