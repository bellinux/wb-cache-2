40|$|The main {{objective}} of this work was to investigate a possible two step hydrodynamic mechanism {{for the production of}} combustion resonance in fully <b>premixed</b> <b>gas</b> <b>burners.</b> This two step mechanism was modelled numerically using a two stage procedure. In the first stage, the stability of a low Reynolds number, impinging shear layer to acoustic forcing, similar to that in a burner at resonance, was investigated. This was carried out using an unsteady, higher order, incompressible, finite volume Navier-Stokes solver specifically developed for this purpose. Simulation of the isothermal entry flow for a range of parametric forcing conditions was carried out. Results indicate quite strongly that at Reynolds numbers where the unforced flow is steady, acoustic forcing may result in the roll up of the shear layer into coherent vortices by a convective instability mechanism. Flow visualisation was carried out, primarily using vorticity contours and quantitative measurements were made of the vortex characteristics.;In the second stage of the work, the interaction of vortices (representative of those formed at the entry of the burner and simulated in the first stage of this work) with a laminar flame front were calculated using a simple, inviscid, Lagrangian flame model. The flame was represented as a discontinuity across which cold unburnt reactants were transformed into hot combustion products. Preliminary results from this study indicate the usefulness of this method for investigating flame-vortex interaction of the type thought to occur in these burners, though further refinement of the model is required.;The results of this study would therefore indicate that flow instability may be the primary mechanism by which resonance occurs in fully <b>premixed</b> <b>gas</b> <b>burners</b> of a design investigated in this work, though at very low Reynolds numbers this would become increasingly difficult...|$|R

Particularly, the main goal of the research activity was a systematic analysis of the influence of an acoustic excitation upon the jet development and entrainment of the surrounding stagnant air. The analised jet presents a quite low Reynolds number (3600), constituting a test case not yet thoroughly studied in literature, but peculiar of some technical appliances, for instance in the field of <b>premixed</b> <b>gas</b> <b>burners.</b> At first, the flow field generated by the stationary free jet has been characterised both through laser Doppler velocimetry, to estimate the global and local entrainment coefficient, and hot wire anemometry, to attain the natural frequency (Strouhal number) of the jet. Subsequently, the jet has been acoustically excited through an active loudspeaker placed in a stagnation chamber upstream the jet outflow, operating at a frequency corresponding to the natural one of the stationary jet (210 Hz). The flow field induced by the excited jet has been analised through laser Doppler velocimetry, comparing the jet development (mean axial velocity and turbulence intensity profile) and the entrainment phenomenon with respect to the stationary (i. e. : not-excited) jet. The results put into evidence that the excited jet presents, especially in the initial region, higher turbulence levels and a larger radial expansion, contributing to a noticeable reduction of the potential core length (backwarding of the jet virtual origin). Moreover, this induces an increase of the entrainment phenomenon with respect to the stationary jet (up to 25 % of the entrained flow rate from the surrounding stagnant air) ...|$|R

40|$|Large Eddy Simulation (LES) {{has become}} an {{increasingly}} useful tool for the prediction of turbulent reactive flows with the increasing availability of cheaper and faster computing power. In the context of premixed combustion, LES encounters the challenge of resolving the flame thickness, which is normally smaller than the filter width used in typical engineering applications. This thesis considers the Flame Surface Density (FSD) approach to provide closure to the filtered LES reaction rate. The FSD can either be modelled algebraically (FSDA) or determined through a transport equation (FSDT) and both approaches are investigated in the LES of three different test cases. The first case explores the response of different FSDA models towards changes in turbulence levels, and compares the instantaneous flame structures and reaction rates predicted by FSDA and FSDT methods. The remaining cases examine the LES of two turbulent <b>premixed</b> <b>burners.</b> A relatively large range of FSDA models are tested under the same operating conditions for the first time, and the LES-FSDT equation is applied to premixed flames that involve {{a higher level of}} geometric complexity than earlier work. Generally, the results show that the performance of some FSDA models are inconsistent between the two <b>premixed</b> <b>burners,</b> suggesting that the models may operate optimally under different turbulent conditions. By contrast, the consistently good agreement of the FSDT results with experiments suggests that the method has much potential in the LES modelling of turbulent premixed flames. However, the improved FSDT predictions were dependent on the value of the model constant within the sub-grid curvature model, and the value yielded an additional dependency on filter width. For these reasons {{as well as for the}} higher computational expense, the effective use of FSDT requires further development, while the application of the FSDA models remains a viable alternative to the FSDT approach.

One of the objectives of this experimental work was to perform an analysis {{on the effect of}} the bluff-body shape on flame stabilization. A method of aerodynamically stabilizing lean <b>premixed</b> natural <b>gas</b> flames on a conventional burner was investigated. The analysis of premixed flames stabilization process was focusing mainly on the shape and sizes of flame holders. To study the influence of the bluff-body shape on the stabilization process, four flame-holders were considered: a rod, a wire and rings of several diameters. Flames were anchored in the wake behind a small ring placed in the exit plane of a conventional burner. The stabilization conditions were based on the description of the stability domain and of the characteristic flame modes. Direct visualizations allow a better knowledge of these different regimes: laminar stable flame, transition and unstable flame. An aerothermodynamic description of the reacting flow in the bluff-body wake was performed over a range of Reynolds numbers and mixture equivalence ratios. The objective was to extract from this analysis, the differences in the flame structure due to the bluff-body geometry and their consequences on the stabilization diagram. Results show the existence of various types of flames, according to the classical <b>premixed</b> <b>burner</b> flame, but the influence of the bluff-body shape on these stabilization regimes is also demonstrated. Comparison between the flow without bluff body and with bluff body on flow as well as flame stabilization was discussed. It was found that the stabilization of the flame is improved by having bluff bodies on downstream of the flow. Without bluff body the stability region of the flame is limited or in general the flame is easier to blow off and flashback. The overall with bluff body stability regime of the burner was significantly increased, permitting stable lean premixed combustion.

On the basis of aerodynamic analysis of <b>premixed</b> <b>burners</b> flow path several recommendations on the geometry resulted in proposing two ejectors, which transport the combustion air. In the first ejector the fuel jet, generated by flow through a nozzle, draws the specified part of the combustion air, and then the mixture is a driving agent of the second ejector. The remaining part of combustion air flows first through the radial curved vanes, and second its tangential velocity component is augmented by axial vanes prior it enters mixing part of the second ejector. For the additional contribution to the rotating motion the inclined axial vanes built inside the nozzle of the second ejector are responsible. The resulting swirling number reaches the values up to 2. 6. For the burner so arranged fire stability and low NOx emissions in the wide operating conditions can be expected. Within the frame of extensive testing program in the field of diffusion burners several modifications have been carried out such as setting of axial vanes which secure the swirling motion, changes of combustion air flows path, and modifications of secondary nozzles, these resulted in extending zone of stabilized flame and reducing the formation of NOx, e. g.

The main development included the use of numerical methods involving CFD codes to vary different nozzle parameters and operating conditions. The author defined the critical parameters for the nozzle design operating in such a burner, and suggested a new type of nozzle. This nozzle was designed and modelled, and proved to be the optimal solution providing the lowest emissions for a Dry oil burner available in the power generation business...|$|R
