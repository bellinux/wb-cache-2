40|$|In 2000, an {{outbreak}} of Mycobacterium fortuitum furunculosis affected customers using whirlpool <b>footbaths</b> at a nail salon. We swabbed 30 <b>footbaths</b> in 18 nail salons from 5 California counties and found mycobacteria in 29 (97 %); M. fortuitum was the most common. Mycobacteria may pose an infectious risk for pedicure customers. In October 2000, we investigated the first known outbreak of Mycobacterium fortuitum cutaneous infections acquired from whirlpool <b>footbaths,</b> also called footspas, at a nail salon in northern California (1). Over 100 pedicure customers had prolonged boils on the lower legs that left scars when healed (1, 2). In the investigation, we swabbed the area behind the screen of the recirculation inlet in each of 10 footspas at the nail salon and recovered strains of M. fortuitum from all 10. Isolates from 3 <b>footbaths</b> and 14 patients were indistinguishable by pulsedfield gel electrophoresis and by multilocus enzyme electrophoresis (1). Before this outbreak, M. fortuitum and other rapidly growing mycobacteria (RGM) caused localized cutaneous infections but usually in a healthcare-associated setting with surgical or clinical devices contaminated with water from the hospital or from the municipal water system (3). In the nail salon outbreak, we suspected that the mycobacteria entered the footspas through the municipal tap water and thrived in {{the large amount of}} organic debris accumulated behind the footspa recirculation screens. However, cultures of tap water at that nail salon later in the investigation yielded RGM in the M. chelonae-abscessus group but not M. fortuitum (1). Since RGM are commonly found in municipal water systems (4 – 6), and since the nail care business is a $ 6 billion and growing industry in this country (7), we hypothesized that similar whirlpool footbath–associated RGM infections occurred sporadically but went unnoticed. Soon after we alerted the health communities to this outbreak, 3 cases of lower extremity RGM infections associated wit...|$|R

I had a little serious talk with Mataafa on the floor, and {{we went down to}} the boat, where we got our food aboard, such a cargo - like the Swiss Family Robinson, we said. However, a squall began, Tauilo refused to let us go, and we came back to the house for half-an-hour or so, when my ladies {{distinguished}} themselves by walking through a Fono (council), my mother actually taking up a position between Mataafa and Popo! It was about five when we started - turtle, pigs, taro, etc., my mother, Belle, myself, Tauilo, a portly friend of hers with the voice of an angel, and a pronunciation so delicate and true that you could follow Samoan as she sang, and the two tired boys Frank and Jimmie, with the two bad oars and the two slippery rowlocks to impel the whole. Sale Taylor took the canoe and a strong Samoan to paddle him. Presently after he went inshore, and passed us a little after, with his arms folded, and TWO strong Samoans impelling him Apia-ward. This was too much for Belle, who hailed, taunted him, and made him return to the boat with one of the Samoans, setting Jimmie instead in the canoe. Then began our torment, Sale and the Samoan took the oars, sat on the same thwart (where they could get no swing on the boat had they tried), and deliberately ladled at the lagoon. We lay enchanted. Night fell; there was a light visible on shore; it did not move. [...] The two women sang, Belle joining them in the hymns she has learned at family worship. Then a squall came up; we sat a while in roaring midnight under rivers of rain, and, when it blew by, there was the light again, immovable. A second squall followed, one of the worst I was ever out in; we could scarce catch our breath in the cold, dashing deluge. When it went, we were so cold that the water {{in the bottom of the}} boat (which I was then baling) seemed like a warm <b>footbath</b> in comparison, and Belle and I, who were still barefoot, were quite restored by laving in it.|$|E
60|$|Gerty MacDowell who {{was seated}} near her companions, lost in thought, gazing far {{away into the}} {{distance}} was, in very truth, as fair a specimen of winsome Irish girlhood as one could wish to see. She was pronounced beautiful by all who knew her though, as folks often said, she was more a Giltrap than a MacDowell. Her figure was slight and graceful, inclining even to fragility but those iron jelloids she had been taking of late had done her a world of good {{much better than the}} Widow Welch's female pills and she was much better of those discharges she used to get and that tired feeling. The waxen pallor of her face was almost spiritual in its ivorylike purity though her rosebud mouth was a genuine Cupid's bow, Greekly perfect. Her hands were of finely veined alabaster with tapering fingers and as white as lemonjuice and queen of ointments could make them though it was not true that she used to wear kid gloves in bed or take a milk <b>footbath</b> either. Bertha Supple told that once to Edy Boardman, a deliberate lie, when she was black out at daggers drawn with Gerty (the girl chums had of course their little tiffs from time to time like the rest of mortals) and she told her not to let on whatever she did that it was her that told her or she'd never speak to her again. No. Honour where honour is due. There was an innate refinement, a languid queenly hauteur about Gerty which was unmistakably evidenced in her delicate hands and higharched instep. Had kind fate but willed her to be born a gentlewoman of high degree in her own right and had she only received the benefit of a good education Gerty MacDowell might easily have held her own beside any lady in the land and have seen herself exquisitely gowned with jewels on her brow and patrician suitors at her feet vying with one another to pay their devoirs to her. Mayhap it was this, the love that might have been, that lent to her softlyfeatured face at whiles a look, tense with suppressed meaning, that imparted a strange yearning tendency to the beautiful eyes, a charm few could resist. Why have women such eyes of witchery? Gerty's were of the bluest Irish blue, set off by lustrous lashes and dark expressive brows. Time was when those brows were not so silkily seductive. It was Madame Vera Verity, directress of the Woman Beautiful page of the Princess Novelette, who had first advised her to try eyebrowleine which gave that haunting expression to the eyes, so becoming in leaders of fashion, and she had never regretted it. Then there was blushing scientifically cured and how to be tall increase your height and you have a beautiful face but your nose? That would suit Mrs Dignam because she had a button one. But Gerty's crowning glory was her wealth of wonderful hair. It was dark brown with a natural wave in it. She had cut it that very morning on account of the new moon and it nestled about her pretty head in a profusion of luxuriant clusters and pared her nails too, Thursday for wealth. And just now at Edy's words as a telltale flush, delicate as the faintest rosebloom, crept into her cheeks she looked so lovely in her sweet girlish shyness that of a surety God's fair land of Ireland did not hold her equal.|$|E

The 2 ̆ 7 {{tropical}} 2 ̆ 7 race 4 strain (Foc TR 4) {{has a significant}} impact on the banana industry worldwide. To prevent this soilborne disease from spreading, the best practice is to minimise movement of infested soil. Investigations were made on three products, Farmcleanse (R), Sporekill (R) and Domestos (R), to determine their suitability as surface sterilants for use in <b>footbaths</b> and on machinery. Assessments involved analysing the rates of microconidia germination, following treatment with fresh preparations of each product, at a range of concentrations and exposure times; and also with preparations of each, after exposure to heat and sunlight, for a range of times. Sporekill (R) was a better surface sterilant than Farmcleanse (R) and Domestos (R), preventing germination of microconidia after the minimum exposure time of 30 s. Sporekill (R) was also able to inhibit microconidia germination after 6 months of exposure to heat and sunlight. This study demonstrated that Sporekill (R) is more effective than Farmcleanse (R) in inhibiting the germination of Foc TR 4 spores, and may be beneficial for use in <b>footbaths</b> and the general disinfestation of machinery contaminated with Foc TR 4.

These are always destroyed in the remnants of the early Megaron, so the definite roof type is not known. See Ancient Roofs for examples. In the theory of architecture, the Megaron is considered to be the earliest architectural act. The floor was of patterned concrete, covered in carpet. On the walls were inlaid paintings called frescoes, these were often of Phoenician style. [...] The Megaron is considered to be the predecessor of all orders in architectural theory. Originally it was very colourful, made with the Minoan architectural order, the insides made of fired brick and a wooden roof supported on beams. The rooftop was tiled with ceramic and terracotta tiles. There were wood ornamented metal doors often two leaved, and <b>footbaths</b> were also used in the megaron.
