5|$|Banksiamyces is {{classified}} in the Helotiaceae, a widespread but poorly known family of fungi, many species of which are saprobic on herbaceous or woody tissues.

He conceded, however, {{that he had not}} examined any specimens.|$|E
5|$|Tests on the thorium uptake {{of workers}} {{involved}} in monazite processing showed thorium levels above recommended limits in their bodies, but no {{adverse effects on}} health were found at those moderately low concentrations. No chemical toxicity <b>has</b> <b>yet</b> <b>been</b> observed in the tracheobronchial tract and the lungs from exposure to thorium. People who work with thorium compounds are at a risk of dermatitis. It can take as much as thirty years after the ingestion of thorium for symptoms to manifest themselves.|$|E

5|$|There {{is little}} doubt that early Christianity {{influenced}} Mingulay (for example the nearby islands of Pabbay and Berneray both have cross-inscribed slabs) but no direct evidence <b>has</b> <b>yet</b> <b>been</b> found.

5|$|A 2016 {{analysis}} of archaeological finds from Southwark in London, {{the site of}} the ancient Roman city Londinium in Roman Britain, suggests that two or three skeletons from a sample of twenty-two dating to the 2nd to the 4th centuries AD are of Asian ancestry, and possibly of Chinese descent. The assertion is based on forensics and the {{analysis of}} skeletal facial features. The discovery has been presented by Dr Rebecca Redfern, curator of human osteology at the Museum of London. No DNA analysis <b>has</b> <b>yet</b> <b>been</b> done, the skull and tooth samples available offer only fragmentary pieces of evidence, and the samples that were used were compared with the morphology of modern populations, not ancient ones.|$|E
5|$|Hans Asperger {{described}} common symptoms {{among his}} patients' family members, especially fathers, and research supports this observation and suggests a genetic contribution to Asperger syndrome. Although no specific gene <b>has</b> <b>yet</b> <b>been</b> identified, multiple factors {{are believed to}} play a role in the expression of autism, given the phenotypic variability seen in children with AS. Evidence for a genetic link is the tendency for AS to run in families and an observed higher incidence of family members who have behavioral symptoms similar to AS but in a more limited form (for example, slight difficulties with social interaction, language, or reading). Most behavioral genetic research suggests that all autism spectrum disorders have shared genetic mechanisms, but AS may have a stronger genetic component than autism. There is probably a common group of genes where particular alleles render an individual vulnerable to developing AS; if this is the case, the particular combination of alleles would determine the severity and symptoms for each individual with AS.|$|E

5|$|In April 1321 the French Dominican friar Jordanus Catalani of Severac (in {{south-western}} France) {{landed at}} Thana {{with four other}} friars. He then travelled to Bhatkal in North Canara, a port town on the coastal route from Thana to Quilon. Being the first bishop of India and the Quilon Diocese, he was entrusted the spiritual nourishment of Christian community in Mangalore {{and other parts of}} India by Pope John XXII. According to historian Severine Silva, no concrete evidence <b>has</b> <b>yet</b> <b>been</b> found that there were any permanent settlements of Christians in South Canara before the 16th century. It was only after the advent of the Portuguese in the region that Christianity began to spread.|$|E
5|$|Kaikhosru Shapurji Sorabji {{was born}} Leon Dudley Sorabji in Chingford, Essex (now Greater London), on 14 August 1892. His father, Shapurji Sorabji, was a civil {{engineer}} of Parsi parentage from Bombay, India, born on 18 August 1863. His mother, Madeleine Marguerite Mathilde Sorabji (née Madeline Matilda Worthy; 13 August 1866– 5 May 1959), was English. She {{is said to have}} been a singer, pianist and organist, but no evidence has been found to support these claims. They married on 18 February 1892. Shapurji Sorabji had married in India in 1880 but, as no record of his first wife's death or his divorce from her <b>has</b> <b>yet</b> <b>been</b> traced, it is possible that he married the composer's mother bigamously.|$|E
5|$|Sea snakes were {{at first}} {{regarded}} as a unified and separate family, the Hydrophiidae, that later came to comprise two subfamilies: the Hydrophiinae, or true/aquatic sea snakes (now 16genera with 57species), and the more primitive Laticaudinae, or sea kraits (one genus, Laticauda, with five species). Eventually, as it became clear just how closely related the sea snakes are to the elapids, the taxonomic situation became less well-defined. Some taxonomists responded by moving the sea snakes to the Elapidae, thereby creating the subfamilies Elapinae, Hydrophiinae, and Laticaudinae, although the latter may be omitted if Laticauda {{is included in the}} Hydrophiinae. No one <b>has</b> <b>yet</b> <b>been</b> able to convincingly work out the phylogenetic relationships between the various elapid subgroups, and the situation is still unclear. Therefore, others opted to either continue to work with the older traditional arrangements, if only for practical reasons, or to lump all of the genera together in the Elapidae, with no taxonomic subdivisions, to reflect the work that remains to be done.|$|E

5|$|Supporters of the {{original}} doctrine of privity {{say that it is}} reasonable not to allow third parties to enforce contracts, arguing that to allow them to do so would hamper the rights of {{the original}} parties in relation to amending or terminating contracts. Another argument put forward is that the doctrine was deliberately retained by judges to protect consumers from exclusion clauses designed to protect third party manufacturers from liability. The general view of academics, however, is that no legal argument <b>has</b> <b>yet</b> <b>been</b> advanced as to why the original doctrine should be good law. Patrick Atiyah argues that the doctrine came from a time of rising trade through middlemen, and was designed to simplify commercial transactions and encourage enterprise liability.|$|E
5|$|Thus, {{engineer}} and physicist Hannes Alfvén identified two fundamental prerequisites for effective management of high-level radioactive waste: (1) stable geological formations, and (2) stable human institutions {{over hundreds of}} thousands of years. As Alfvén suggests, no known human civilization has ever endured for so long, and no geologic formation of adequate size for a permanent radioactive waste repository <b>has</b> <b>yet</b> <b>been</b> discovered that has been stable for so long a period. Nevertheless, avoiding confronting the risks associated with managing radioactive wastes may create countervailing risks of greater magnitude. Radioactive waste management is an example of policy analysis that requires special attention to ethical concerns, examined in the light of uncertainty and futurity: consideration of 'the impacts of practices and technologies on future generations'.|$|E
5|$|Roman Catholics {{from the}} South Canara {{district}} on the south-western coast of India, {{under the jurisdiction}} of the Mangalore Diocese, are generally known as Mangalorean Catholics. They are Konkani people who speak the Konkani language. All earlier records of South Canara's Christians were lost at the time of their deportation by Tipu in 1784 and it is not known when Christianity was introduced in South Canara. It is possible that Syrian Christians settled in South Canara as they had in Malabar, a region south of Canara. During the 13thcentury Italian traveller Marco Polo recorded that there were considerable trading activities between the Red Sea and the Canara coast. Scholars have surmised that foreign Christian merchants were visiting the coastal towns of South Canara during that period for commerce, and that some Christian priests possibly accompanied them in their evangelical work. In 1321, the French Dominican friar Jordanus Catalani of Severac in south-western France, arrived in Bhatkal, North Canara. According to historian Severine Silva, no concrete evidence <b>has</b> <b>yet</b> <b>been</b> found that there were any permanent settlements of Christians in South Canara before the 16thcentury.|$|E
