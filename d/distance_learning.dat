40|$|<b>Distance</b> metric <b>learning</b> is an {{important}} component for many tasks, such as statistical classification and content-based image retrieval. Existing approaches for <b>learning</b> <b>distance</b> metrics from pairwise constraints typically suffer from two major problems. First, most algorithms only offer point estimation of the distance metric and can therefore be unreliable when the number of training examples is small. Second, since these algorithms generally select their training examples at random, they can be inefficient if labeling effort is limited. This paper presents a Bayesian framework for <b>distance</b> metric <b>learning</b> that estimates a posterior distribution for the distance metric from labeled pairwise constraints. We describe an efficient algorithm based on the variational method for the proposed Bayesian approach. Furthermore, we apply the proposed Bayesian framework to active <b>distance</b> metric <b>learning</b> by selecting those unlabeled example pairs with the greatest uncertainty in relative distance. Experiments in classification demonstrate that the proposed framework achieves higher classification accuracy and identifies more informative training examples than the non-Bayesian approach and state-of-the-art <b>distance</b> metric <b>learning</b> algorithms. ...|$|R

40|$|We {{present a}} novel {{approach}} to <b>learn</b> <b>distance</b> metric for information retrieval. <b>Learning</b> <b>distance</b> metric {{from a number of}} queries with side information, i. e., relevance judgements, has been studied widely, for example pairwise constraint-based <b>distance</b> metric <b>learning.</b> However, the capacity of existing algorithms is limited, because they usually assume that the distance between two similar objects is smaller than the distance between two dissimilar objects.

To address this problem explicitly, we propose rankbased <b>distance</b> metric <b>learning.</b> Our approach overcomes the drawback of existing algorithms by comparing the distances only among the relevant and irrelevant objects for a given query. To avoid over-fitting, a regularizer based on the Burg matrix divergence is also introduced.

In our method, the distance metric is trained on positive and negative difference spaces, which are built from the neighborhood of each training instance, so that the local discriminative information is preserved. We show how to solve this problem with a closed-form solution rather than using tedious optimization procedures. The solution is easy to implement, and tractable for large-scale problems.
