5|$|During the 1952 presidential election, the Eisenhower {{campaign}} toured Wisconsin with McCarthy. In {{a speech}} delivered in Green Bay, Eisenhower declared {{that while he}} agreed with McCarthy's goals, he disagreed with his methods. In draft versions of <b>his</b> <b>speech,</b> Eisenhower had also included a strong defense of his mentor, George Marshall, which was a direct rebuke of McCarthy's frequent attacks. However, under the advice of conservative colleagues who were fearful that Eisenhower could lose Wisconsin if he alienated McCarthy supporters, he deleted this defense from later versions of <b>his</b> <b>speech.</b> The deletion was discovered by William H. Laurence, a reporter for The New York Times, and featured on its front page the next day. Eisenhower was widely criticized for giving up his personal convictions, and the incident became the low point of his campaign.|$|E

500|$|Lewis {{prevented}} the communists from making inroads at Oxford. Ted Jolliffe stated [...] "there {{was a difference}} between <b>his</b> <b>speeches</b> at the Union and <b>his</b> <b>speeches</b> at the Labour Club. [...] <b>His</b> <b>speeches</b> at the Union had more humour in them; the atmosphere was entirely different. But <b>his</b> <b>speeches</b> at the Labour Club were deadly serious... His influence at the Labour Club, more than anyone else's, I think, explains {{the failure of the}} Communists to make headway there. [...] There were so many naive people around who could have been taken in." [...] He increased the Labour Club's membership by three quarters by the time he left.|$|R

5|$|On 23 June 2011, Wilders {{was acquitted}} of all charges. A Dutch court said that <b>his</b> <b>speech</b> was {{legitimate}} political debate, but on the edge. Because both the public prosecutor and the defence requested complete acquittal, the verdict will most likely not be appealed.|$|E
5|$|Rambhadracharya {{was one of}} {{the spiritual}} and {{religious}} Gurus from India at the Millennium World Peace Summit, organised by the United Nations in New York City from 28 to 31 August 2000.

At the end of <b>his</b> <b>speech,</b> he recited the Shanti Mantra.|$|E

5|$|After {{a search}} {{that had taken}} several years, Wheeler was able to secure a {{premises}} for the Institute of Archaeology: St. John's Lodge in Regent's Park, central London. Left empty since its use as a hospital during the First World War, the building was owned by the Crown and was controlled by the First Commissioner of Works, William Ormsby-Gore; he was very sympathetic to archaeology, and leased the building to the Institute at a low rent. The St. John's Lodge premises were officially opened on 29 April 1937. During <b>his</b> <b>speech</b> at the ceremony, the University of London's Vice-Chancellor Charles Reed Peers {{made it clear that}} the building was only intended as a temporary home for the Institute, which it was hoped would be able to move to Bloomsbury, the city's academic hub. In <b>his</b> <b>speech,</b> the university's Chancellor, Alexander Cambridge, 1st Earl of Athlone, compared the new institution to both the Institute of Historical Research and the Courtauld Institute of Art.|$|E

5|$|At an {{unscheduled}} session, Albert expresses {{his frustration}} that while <b>his</b> <b>speech</b> has improved when talking to most people, he still stammers when talking to David and reveals {{the extent of}} Edward VIII's folly with Simpson.

5|$|At {{his first}} {{speech to the}} {{assembled}} troops, Alcibiades complained bitterly about {{the circumstances of his}} exile, but the greatest part of the speech consisted of boasting about his influence with Tissaphernes. The primary motives of <b>his</b> <b>speech</b> were to make the oligarchs at Athens afraid of him and to increase his credit with the army at Samos. Upon hearing <b>his</b> <b>speech</b> the troops immediately elected him General alongside Thrasybulus and the others. In fact, he roused them so much that they proposed to sail at once for Piraeus and attack the oligarchs in Athens. It was primarily Alcibiades, along with Thrasybulus, who calmed the people and showed them the folly of this proposal, which would have sparked civil war and led to the immediate defeat of Athens. Shortly after Alcibiades's reinstatement as an Athenian general, the government of the Four Hundred was overthrown and replaced by a broader oligarchy, which would eventually give way to democracy.|$|E

5|$|Before Peter is {{preparing}} to leave for jury duty, the family is seen watching a television sitcom entitled How Henry Kissinger Met Your Mother, a parody of the CBS sitcom How I Met Your Mother, which features Henry Kissinger, whose heavy accent makes <b>his</b> <b>speech</b> unintelligible.
