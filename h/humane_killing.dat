40|$|Non-lead hunting {{ammunition}} is {{an alternative}} to bullets that contain lead. The use of lead ammunition can result in severe contamination of game meat, thus posing a health risk to consumers. With any kind of ammunition for hunting, the terminal effectiveness of bullets is an animal welfare issue. Doubts {{about the effectiveness of}} non-lead bullets for a humane kill of game animals in hunting have been discussed. The length of the escape distance after the shot has been used previously as an indicator for bullet performance. The object {{of this study was to}} determine how the bullet material (lead or non-lead) influences the observed escape distances. 1, 234 records of the shooting of roe deer (Capreolus capreolus) and 825 records of the shooting of wild boar (Sus scrofa) were evaluated. As the bullet material cannot be regarded as the sole cause of variability of escape distances, interactions of other potential influencing variables like shot placement, shooting distance, were analyzed using conditional regression trees and two-part hurdle models. The length of the escape distance is not influenced by the use of lead or non-lead ammunition with either roe deer or wild boar. With roe deer, the length of the escape distance is influenced significantly by the shot placement and the type of hunting. Increasing shooting distances increased the length of the escape distance. With wild boar, shot placement and the age of the animals were found to be a significant influencing factor on the length of the escape distance. The length of the escape distance can be used as an indicator for adequate bullet effectiveness for <b>humane</b> <b>killings</b> of game animals in hunting.

40|$|Disease control {{measures}} require poultry {{to be killed}} on farms {{to minimize the risk}} of disease being transmitted to other poultry and, in some cases, to protect public health. We assessed the welfare implications for poultry of the use of high-expansion gas-filled foam as a potentially <b>humane,</b> emergency <b>killing</b> method. In laboratory trials, broiler chickens, adult laying hens, ducks, and turkeys were exposed to air-, N 2 -, or CO 2 -filled high expansion foam (expansion ratio 300 : 1) under standardized conditions. Birds were equipped with sensors to measure cardiac and brain activity, and measurements of oxygen concentration in the foam were carried out. Initial behavioral responses to foam were not pronounced but included headshakes and brief bouts of wing flapping. Both N 2 - and CO 2 -filled foam rapidly induced ataxia/loss of posture and vigorous wing flapping in all species, characteristic of anoxic death. Immersion in air-filled, high expansion foam had little effect on physiology or behavior. Physiological responses to both N 2 - and CO 2 -filled foam were characterized by a pronounced bradyarrythymia and a series of consistent changes in the appearance of the electroencephalogram. These were used to determine an unequivocal time to loss of consciousness in relation to submersion. Mean time to loss of consciousness was 30 s in hens and 18 s in broilers exposed to N 2 -filled foam, and 16 s in broilers, 1 s in ducks, and 15 s in turkeys exposed to CO 2 -filled foam. Euthanasia achieved with anoxic foam was particularly rapid, which is explained by the very low oxygen concentrations (below 1 %) inside the foam. Physiological observations and postmortem examination showed that the mode of action of high expansion, gas-filled foam is anoxia, not occlusion of the airway. These trials provide proof-of-principle that submersion in gas-filled, high expansion foam provides a rapid and highly effective method of euthanasia, which may have potential to provide <b>humane</b> emergency <b>killing</b> or routine depopulatio...|$|R

40|$|International audienceFrom January 2013 {{scientific}} projects involving cephalopods became {{regulated by}} Directive 2010 / 63 /EU, but at present {{there is little}} guidance specifically for cephalopods {{on a number of}} key requirements of the Directive, including: recognition of pain, suffering and distress and implementation of humane end-points; anaesthesia and analgesia, and <b>humane</b> <b>killing.</b> This paper critically reviews these key areas prior to the development of guidelines and makes recommendations, including identifying topics for further research. In particular: a) Evidence on how cephalopods might experience pain is reviewed; and a draft scheme of behavioural and physiological criteria for recognising and assessing pain, suffering and distress in cephalopods used in scientific procedures is presented and discussed. b) Agents and protocols currently used for general anaesthesia and analgesia are evaluated. Magnesium chloride, ethanol and clove oil are the most frequently used agents, but their efficacy and potential for induction of aversion need to be systematically investigated, according to the species of cephalopod and factors such as body weight, sex and water temperature. Means of sedating animals prior to anaesthesia should be investigated. Criteria for assessing depth of anaesthesia, including depression of ventilation, decrease in chromatophore tone (paling), reduced arm activity, tone and sucker adhesiveness, loss of normal posture and righting reflex, and loss of response to a noxious stimulus, are discussed. c) Analgesia should be provided for cephalopods used in scientific procedures, whenever this would be the case for vertebrates. However, research is needed to evaluate effective agents and administration routes for cephalopods. d) Techniques for local anaesthesia need to be defined and evaluated. e) Currently used methods of killing and criteria for confirmation of death in cephalopods are evaluated. Based on present knowledge, a protocol for <b>humane</b> <b>killing</b> of cephalopods is proposed. However, further evaluation is needed, along with development of humane methods of killing that will not compromise study of the brain. On humane grounds: i. mechanical (as opposed to chemical) methods of killing should not be used on conscious cephalopods (unless specifically authorised by the national competent authority); and ii. hatchlings and larvae should be killed by overdose of anaesthetic and not by immersion in tissue fixative. Key gaps in current knowledge are also highlighted, so as to encourage research that will contribute to the evidence base needed to develop guidelines to the Directive...|$|E
40|$|There {{is a need}} {{to ensure}} that the care and welfare for fish {{maintained}} in the laboratory are to the highest standards. This extends to the use of anaesthetics for both scientific study, <b>humane</b> <b>killing</b> and euthanasia at end of life. An anaesthetic should not induce negative behaviours and fish should not seek to avoid the anaesthetic. Surprisingly little information is available to facilitate a humane choice of anaesthetic agent for fish despite over 100 years of use and the millions of fish currently held in thousands of laboratories worldwide. Using a chemotaxic choice chamber we found different species specific behavioural responses among four closely related fish species commonly held in the laboratory, exposed to three widely used anaesthetic agents. As previously found for zebrafish (Danio rerio), the use of MS- 222 and benzocaine also appears to induce avoidance behaviours in medaka (Oryzias latipes); but etomidate could provide an alternative choice. Carp (Cyprinus carpio), although closely related to zebrafish showed avoidance behaviours to etomidate, but not benzocaine or MS- 222; and rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss) showed no avoidance to the three agents tested. We were unable to ascertain avoidance responses in fathead minnows (Pimephales promelas) and suggest different test paradigms are required for that species...|$|E

40|$|The {{purpose of}} the project was to {{introduce}} the application of suitable and efficient stunning methods to render livestock unconscious prior to slaughtering, with a view to minimizing post-harvest losses of meat and by-products. A total of 17 slaughter stations throughout the country were selected to participate in the project. Captive bolt pistols and <b>humane</b> <b>killing</b> cartridges were provided to all participating stations. Demonstrations were conducted on the utilization of the stunning equipment, and refresher training was provided on methods of minimizing post-harvest losses. Utilization of the stunning methods was quickly adopted at all selected slaughter stations. The new method was found to be safe, effective and significantly time-saving. The use of stunning equipment was found to greatly reduce the risk of injury to both livestock and slaughter station personnel. Reduced animal injury during slaughter resulted in a remarkable improvement in the quality of both meat and hides. Water should be provided for livestock at all slaughter stations. Handling facilities at all slaughter stations should be maintained in good condition, as this contributes to a more effective use of the stunning equipment.

5000|$|Ikejime (活け締め) or Ikijime (活き締め) is {{a method}} of paralyzing fish to {{maintain}} {{the quality of its}} meat. The technique originated in Japan, but is now in widespread use. It involves the insertion of a spike quickly and directly into the hindbrain, usually located slightly behind and above the eye, thereby causing immediate brain death. [...] When spiked correctly, the fish fins flare and the fish relaxes, immediately ceasing all motion. Destroying the brain and the spinal cord of the fish will prevent reflex action from happening; such muscle movements would otherwise consume adenosine triphosphate (ATP) in the muscle, and as a result produce lactic acid, making the fish sour. Furthermore, the blood contained in the fish flesh retracts to the gut cavity, which produces a better coloured and flavoured fillet.
