5|$|Monson {{initiated}} French-speaking proselytizing {{efforts in}} Quebec. He directed increased missionary work to {{immigrants from the}} Netherlands, Germany, Poland, Italy, Soviet Union and Hungary. Jacob de Jager, a future LDS <b>general</b> <b>authority,</b> was among the immigrant converts. Monson encouraged members to remain in eastern Canada, instead of migrating to Utah or Alberta as many members had done before, to help build the church's presence. To help encourage members to stay in Canada, increase the perception of permanence, and better reach potential converts, he started a major construction program for new meetinghouses. Until then, most branches had used rented halls.|$|E

5|$|Singapore's Elected Presidency {{scheme was}} {{created as a}} {{constitutional}} safeguard for the nation's future to prevent irresponsible governance. Being directly elected by the people gives the President legitimacy and moral authority {{to serve as a}} check on the executive's powers. The President's two main responsibilities are the protection of Singapore's past reserves and the preservation of the integrity of the public service. However, the President's role is custodial and ceremonial – he does not exercise executive powers. In fact, the President is generally required to act in accordance with the advice of the Cabinet, or of a Minister acting under the <b>general</b> <b>authority</b> of the Cabinet, in the exercise of his functions under the Constitution or any other written law, unless the contrary is expressly provided for.|$|E
5|$|In {{addition}} to giving the originals of his diaries to USU, Arrington had given microfilm of his diary from his boyhood until 1982 to the Church Archives, {{but with the}} condition that his diaries not be read until 25 years after his death. Shortly after Arrington's death, a <b>general</b> <b>authority</b> asked Arrington's daughter, Susan Madsen, to excise 40 parts of her father's diary. By making this request, the LDS Church representatives revealed that they read Arrington's journals without proper permission. George Daines, the Arrington family attorney, explained that the family had grounds to take legal action against the LDS Church and the negotiations were quickly over. Arrington's family agreed to give the LDS Church some of the materials, including minutes to meetings with the Twelve Apostles and materials related to the temple ceremony.|$|E
5|$|The Constitution {{defines the}} Government of Singapore as the President and the Cabinet of Singapore. The {{executive}} authority of Singapore is vested in the President and is exercisable by him {{or by the}} Cabinet of Singapore or any Minister authorized by the Cabinet. However, the President normally plays a nominal and largely ceremonial role {{in the executive branch}} of government. Although the President acts in his personal discretion in the exercise of certain functions as a check on the Cabinet and Parliament of Singapore, he is otherwise required to act in accordance with the advice of the Cabinet or of a Minister acting under the <b>general</b> <b>authority</b> of the Cabinet. It is the Cabinet that has the general direction and control of the Government. As Singapore follows the Westminster system of government, the legislative agenda of Parliament is determined by the Cabinet. At the start of each new Parliamentary session, the President gives an address prepared by the Cabinet that outlines what the Cabinet intends to achieve in the session.|$|E

[...] One of these men, Bruce A.
