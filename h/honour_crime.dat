40|$|In 2009 the New York Times ran a {{story about}} the {{marriage}} of a Pakistani woman, Mukhtaran Bibi, who had been caught up in a village honour dispute several years earlier. While there are numerous accounts of the event, {{it is clear that the}} village council was controlled by the MastOi clan, which was richer and far more powerful than Bibi&# 039;s clan the Gujjar Tatla. The Mastoi accused Bibi&# 039;s 12 year-old brother of;iadti (rape, sodomy or illegal sex) or zina (fornication or adultery) on the grounds that he had been seen walking unaccompanied with a Mastoi girl. According to the brother&# 039;s testimony delivered much later to an authorized, state court, he had himself been raped and sodomized by three Mastoi men, who then invented the <b>honour</b> <b>crime</b> story in order to deflect attention from their own crime. When the Mastoi abducted the accused brother, Bibi&# 039;s family offered a settlement arrangement, even though they believed the boy to be entirely innocent...|$|E
40|$|The {{purpose of}} the study was to {{determine}} the causes of death as reported in court files of the female victims of honour crimes, the Jordanian penal codes regarding crimes of honour, the evidence used in the sentencing of the defendants, the types of weapons used, the characteristics of the physical assaults on the victims and the sentencing of the offenders. A retrospective study of crimes of honour in Jordan was conducted, and the 16 homicide cases considered to be crimes of honour were reviewed. The autopsy reports of the victims provided information on the physical condition of the victims, including the type and severity of injuries. In over 60 % of the <b>honour</b> <b>crime</b> cases, multiple gunshot wounds were the direct cause of death. In cases where the victim was a single pregnant female, the offender was acquitted of murder or received a reduced sentence. The majority of murders were committed by the brother of the victim and the length of sentence received by the offender varied from no sentence to life with hard labour. Offenders who received the harshest punishment were those whose victims married without the family consent. PublishedN/...|$|E

40|$|This paper {{discusses}} <b>honour</b> related <b>crimes</b> and {{the judicial}} process within the legal system in a Swedish context. The empirical base {{of the study is}} four cases, with an honour background, and we have used discourse analysis as our method. We have developed four tools for analysing the sentences with which we observed aspects such as; language, the roles of victim and perpetrator that the involved can undertake, the different identities that the sentence might create and finally how the stories change when they enter the legal context. We connect our results to our theoretic backgrounds such as Kolfjord who discusses the legalization of conflicts, the holistic and individual perspective, the legal system as a theoretic background and finally the UN:s definition of <b>honour</b> <b>crimes.</b> These four theoretic perspectives have helped analyse the empiric base. The study reveals that the courts handle cases of honour without discussing that fact. It emerges aspects from the stories that are specific for <b>honour</b> <b>crimes.</b> The courts show a difficulty when handling cases with an honour background, there is a conflict between the group norms and the individualistic perspective. The courts describe honour in the empirical material despite the fact that honour has no legal grounds in the Swedish laws...|$|R

We argue that the agenda and demands of (ethnic minority) women′s organizations are selectively included and bent to serve other, non-feminist agendas. Ethnic minority women′s organizations and female ethnic minority politicians have acted as agenda-setters, asking attention for their marginalized position, discrimination against them and experiences of violence, yet these issues were co-opted by (mainly) right-wing politicians to problematize the "deviant" culture of minorities and propose policies that further exclude them and paternalize them instead of improving their situation...|$|R

40|$|This book {{attempts}} {{to persuade a}} new generation of scholars, criminologists, activists, and policy makers sympathetic to the quest for global justice to open the envelope, to step out of their comfort zones and typical frames of analysis to gaze at a world full of injustice against the female sex, much of it systemic, linked to culture, custom and religion. In some instances the sources of these injustices intersect with those that produce global inequality, imperialism and racism. This book also investigates circumstances where the globalising forces cultivate male on male violence in the anomic spaces of supercapitalism – the border zones of Mexico and the United States, and the frontier mining communities in the Australian desert. However systemic gendered injustices, such as forced marriage of child female brides, sati the cremation of widows, genital cutting, <b>honour</b> <b>crimes,</b> rape and domestic violence against women, are forms of violence only experienced by the female sex. The book does not shirk away from female violence either. Carrington argues that if feminism wants to have a voice in the public, cultural, political and criminological debates about heightened, albeit often exaggerated, social concerns about growing female violence and engagement in terrorism, then new directions in theorising female violence are required. Feminist silences about the violent crimes, atrocities and acts of terrorism committed by the female sex leave anti-feminist explanations uncontested. This allows a discursive space for feminist backlash ideologues to flourish. This book contests those ideologies to offer counter explanations for the rise in female violence and female terrorism, in a global context where systemic gendered violence against women is alarming and entrenched. The world needs feminism to take hold across the globe, now more than ever...|$|R

40|$|This {{research}} {{demonstrate how}} <b>crimes</b> of <b>honour</b> functions and consequently could lay the path in which females do need help and support {{in order to}} escape from (or manage) their environment of oppression. Thus, females {{all over the world}} are violated in the name of honour and every year around 5, 000 women and girls are murdered in the name of honour by her relatives. The exact number how many that is affected by <b>crimes</b> of <b>honour</b> could only be guessed, due to, we only see the registered crimes. Nevertheless, this phenomenon is still evident within multicultural societies as in Sweden. Hence, those females that do not want to live in oppression or expose themselves to violence and crimes such as murder, instead escape and as a result necessitate protection and societal aid. The legal and practical support targeting these victims must therefore be known. The aim with this research is to highlight this support in an empirical research. In addition, various theoretical and legal perspectives explain a broader understanding of the phenomenon of crimes of honour; in which relevant regulations of the Swedish jurisdiction and the Human Rights are dispositional. The empirical research takes departure from semi-structured interviews with eight local agents in the city of Malmö (Sweden), and also, an interview with a woman affected by <b>crimes</b> of <b>honour</b> was conducted in order to highlight strengths and weaknesses of the local support. The result demonstrates that both the legal and practical support has its affirmative elements; however this support is also limited. For instance, victims of <b>honour</b> <b>crimes</b> lack information how to access this support. Moreover, the Swedish Penal Code do not have any uttered criminal classification about this sorts of violence, leading to the lack of registration unless not considered being a crime according to the Swedish Penal Code. Since <b>crimes</b> of <b>honour</b> affects many people’s lives and exists in many different shapes, conducts and societies it is required that the right kind of support is carried out; whereas the importance of local agents taking responsibility must be acknowledged...|$|R
40|$|The {{murders of}} Pela Atroshi, Sara Abed Ali and Fadime Sahindal, started a debate {{concerning}} the underlying motives of honour related violence. This paper aimed {{to describe and}} explain in what way honour related violence is perceived in publications by academics, public authorities and voluntary organisations to name a few. Different types of literature were thematically analysed as well as analysed using a model by Lorentzon. The scope {{of this paper was}} narrowed down to Swedish conditions and excluded men as victims of <b>honour</b> related <b>crimes.</b> The conclusion suggests a definition of honour related violence as a result of general patriarchy with different features. For example, men’s honour is connected to women’s behaviour and retaining of virginity. The only way to restore a lost honour is to eliminate the woman physically or socially. The use of postcolonial theories in analyzing the definition resulted in an understanding of honour related violence perceived as something different from Swedish culture...|$|R
5000|$|Denis Healey was {{the guest}} of <b>honour</b> at a <b>Crime</b> Writers' Association dinner a few years ago, one of those years when he {{was no more than}} a shadow Minister, and so had time for {{criminal}} frivolity. In the course of his speech Mr. Healey showed a considerable, almost a dazzling, knowledge of crime fiction. It was an impressive performance, one nearly too much for some of the audience. People who write crime stories are often not great readers of them, feeling perhaps that anything they read will be inferior to what they have written. And when, near the end of his peroration, Mr. Healey picked out for special praise the crime novels of John Franklin Bardin, they looked at each other in astonishment. Who was John Franklin Bardin? One is safe in saying than no more than a dozen of the hundred and fifty people at dinner than night had ever heard of him.|$|R
40|$|Paper {{presented}} at the 600 th ANNIVERSARY OF THE BATTLE OF AGINCOURT CONFERENCE 2015 War on Land and SeaFriday 31 July to Monday 3 August 2015 The Treaty of Troyes laid the foundations of a new regime in France, 1420. The king of England was to become king of France {{after the death of}} his adoptive father Charles VI. He acted as a regent in the meantime and had for duty to subdue the rebels. The city and market of Meaux opposed a strong resistance to Henry V, in 1421 / 1422; it turned out to be the longest that the English king met on French territory. It was followed up by a harsh repression against the besieged. A recent contribution on the siege of Meaux presents Henry as both cruel and unjust in his retribution, further tarnishing the portrait of this controversial king. In this paper, I would like to scrutinise and replace this case-study within the broader normative framework of the time, engaging with the notions of <b>honour,</b> rebellion and <b>crime,</b> and devoting particular attention to four individuals for whom Henry preferred 'rigour of justice' rather than mercy...|$|R
40|$|Honour', an {{undefined}} notion in {{a patriarchal}} society like Pakistan, {{is used as}} a tool to justify the crime of murder. Violence in the name of honour is not a new phenomenon. Historically, it has been justified in the name of culture but the scope of this tradition has broadened with time and there is an enormous {{increase in the number of}} its victims. This cultural notion is interpreted in a way to control women's sexuality and to keep women subordinate to men. Honour killing is not legally sanctioned but the judiciary, the administration and the society often condone it one way or the other. In the tribal areas of Pakistan where such murder is not considered a <b>crime,</b> <b>honour</b> killing is a punishment for those who contravene against the traditional honour code. The wide acceptance of honour killing has made women suffer as a whole against their basic rights; human, constitutional and Islamic. This thesis focuses on the judicial redress against the <b>crime</b> of <b>honour</b> killings, which could be achieved by proper administration of justice. It contests that to control the crime in the patriarchal society of Pakistan, legislative measures are not enough. There is a dire need to eliminate the inadequacies of the administration of justice. The State could build a judicial framework to eliminate the inequality and discrimination against women. The judiciary could play an important role in bringing justice to the victims and in curbing this heinous crime...|$|R
6000|$|... "It is true, we may repeat to ourselves, in {{alleviation}} of {{this poor}} man's unhappy action, that his {{case is a}} very peculiar one. The country which he inhabits was, {{in the days of}} many now alive, inaccessible to the laws, not only of England, which have not even yet penetrated thither, but to those to which our neighbours of Scotland are subjected, and which must be supposed to be, and no doubt actually are, founded upon the general principles of justice and equity which pervade every civilized country. Amongst their mountains, as among the North American Indians, the various tribes were wont to make war upon each other, so that each man was obliged to go armed for his own protection. These men, from the ideas which they entertained of their own descent and of their own consequence, regarded themselves as so many cavaliers or men-at-arms, rather than as the peasantry of a peaceful country. Those laws of the ring, as my brother terms them, were unknown to the race of warlike mountaineers; that decision of quarrels by no other weapons than those which nature has given every man must to them have seemed as vulgar and as preposterous as to the NOBLESSE of France. Revenge, on the other hand, must have been as familiar to their habits of society as to those of the Cherokees or Mohawks. It is indeed, as described by Bacon, at bottom a kind of wild untutored justice; for the fear of retaliation must withhold the hands of the oppressor where there is no regular law to check daring violence. But though all this may be granted, and though we may allow that, such having been the case of the Highlands {{in the days of the}} prisoner's fathers, many of the opinions and sentiments must still continue to influence the present generation, it cannot, and ought not, even in this most painful case, to alter the administration of the law, either in your hands, gentlemen of the jury, or in mine. The first object of civilisation is to place the general protection of the law, equally administered, in the room of that wild justice which every man cut and carved for himself, according to the length of his sword and the strength of his arm. The law says to the subjects, with a voice only inferior to that of the Deity, 'Vengeance is mine.' The instant that there is time for passion to cool, and reason to interpose, an injured party must become aware that the law assumes the exclusive cognisance of the right and wrong betwixt the parties, and opposes her inviolable buckler to every attempt of the private party to right himself. I repeat that this unhappy man ought personally to be the object rather of our pity than our abhorrence, for he failed in his ignorance, and from mistaken notions of <b>honour.</b> But his <b>crime</b> is not the less that of murder, gentlemen, and, in your high and important office, it is your duty so to find. Englishmen have their angry passions as well as Scots; and should this man's action remain unpunished, you may unsheath, under various pretences, a thousand daggers betwixt the Land's-End and the Orkneys." ...|$|R
