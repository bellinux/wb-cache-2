50|$|The verb 'to be' is {{actually}} composed {{of three different}} stems:The <b>present</b> <b>forms</b> of wesan are almost never used.

Only the <b>present</b> <b>forms</b> of bēon contrast with the <b>present</b> <b>forms</b> of sindon/wesan in that bēon tends to be used to refer to eternal or permanent truths, while sindon/wesan is used more commonly to refer to temporary or subjective facts. This semantic distinction (made only during the present tense) was lost as Old English developed into modern English, so that the modern verb 'to be' is a single verb which takes <b>its</b> <b>present</b> indicative <b>forms</b> from sindon, its past indicative <b>forms</b> from wesan, <b>its</b> <b>present</b> subjunctive <b>forms</b> from bēon, its past subjunctive forms from wesan, and its imperative and participle forms from bēon.
