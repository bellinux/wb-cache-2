5|$|C-terminal truncation: The C-terminal end {{segment is}} the most conserved region of TnI. As an {{allosteric}} structure regulated by Ca2+ in the troponin complex, it binds and stabilizes the position of tropomyosin in low Ca2+ state implicating {{a role in the}} inhibition of actomyosin ATPase. A deletion of the C-terminal 19 amino acids was found during myocardial ischemia-reperfusion injury in Langendorff perfused rat hearts. <b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>also</b> <b>seen</b> in myocardial stunning in coronary bypass patients. Over-expression of the C-terminal truncated cardiac TnI (cTnI1-192) in transgenic mouse heart resulted in a phenotype of myocardial stunning with systolic and diastolic dysfunctions. Replacement of intact cTnI with cTnT1-192 in myofibrils and cardiomyocytes did not affect maximal tension development but decreased the rates of force redevelopment and relaxation.|$|E
5|$|France even {{linked the}} issue of the seat to the ongoing dispute {{regarding}} the seat of the European Parliament. Frankfurt was criticised as symbolising German dominance, although the Deutsche Bundesbank had effectively been running the Communities currencies for the previous years, while Luxembourg has a banking tradition that wasn't so careful. London was discredited because the UK remained outside the eurozone. <b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>also</b> <b>seen</b> as important to locate the bank in a city not already hosting a national government or EU institution, in order to emphasise its independence. Others, such as {{the former head of the}} Bundesbank Karl Otto Pöhl, favoured a small country with a stable currency. The advantages of hosting the Bank were also in dispute by some economists. While there was seen by some as little to gain in terms of attracting other banks and financial institutions, others saw it as affecting which cities would be financial hubs in the years to come.|$|E
5|$|One {{source of}} {{tensions}} in the western and southwestern states was the influx of Mexicans to the U.S. following the 1910 Mexican Revolution. Many Mexicans also smoked marijuana to relax after working in the fields. <b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>also</b> <b>seen</b> as a cheaper alternative to alcohol, due to Prohibition (which went into effect nationally in 1920). Later in the 1920s, negative tensions grew between the small farms and the large farms that used cheaper Mexican labor. Shortly afterwards, the Great Depression came which increased tensions as jobs and resources became more scarce. Because of that, {{the passage of the}} initial laws is often described as a product of racism, yet use of hashish by near eastern immigrants was also cited, as well as the misuse of pharmaceutical hemp, and the laws conformed with other legislation that was being passed around the country. Mexico itself had passed prohibition in 1925, following the International Opium Convention (see below).|$|E

In reality, the issue was much more complex than even those reasons suggest.|$|E

The album was released in 2006 under the ‘’Good News 4 Music’’ productions. It peaked the top rankings in the charts from the release day and stayed top 1 several weeks; <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>also</b> <b>seen</b> in the top 20 after four years from its release. The work is still selling well after six years, and a new copy by EMI Music is now selling out after the previous label was sold out.|$|E
25|$|The 2008 Liechtenstein tax affair is {{a series}} of tax {{investigations}} in numerous countries whose governments suspect that some of their citizens have evaded tax obligations by using banks and trusts in Liechtenstein; the affair broke open with the biggest complex of investigations ever initiated for tax evasion in the Federal Republic of Germany. <b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>also</b> <b>seen</b> as an attempt to put pressure on Liechtenstein, then one of the remaining uncooperative tax havens—along with Andorra and Monaco—as identified by the Paris-based Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development in 2007. On 27 May 2009 the OECD removed Liechtenstein from the blacklist of uncooperative countries.|$|E

25|$|The scene {{gradually}} became increasingly {{common in the}} art of the Western church, and increasingly rare in Orthodox art. Various themes in theological exegesis of the event influenced the treatment in art. As the first drawing of Christ's blood, <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>also</b> <b>seen</b> as a forerunner of, or even the first scene of, the Passion of Christ, {{and was one of the}} Seven Sorrows of Mary. Other interpretations developed based on it as the naming ceremony equivalent to Christian baptism, the aspect which was eventually to become most prominent in Catholic thinking. Both in this respect and in terms of finding a place in a pictorial cycle, consideration of the circumcision put it in a kind of competition with the much better established Presentation of Jesus; eventually the two scenes were to be conflated in some paintings.|$|E
25|$|In {{classical}} rabbinical literature, it {{was argued}} that the Biblical regulations concerning left-overs only applied to corn fields, orchards, and vineyards, and not to vegetable gardens; the classical rabbinical writers were much stricter in regard to who could receive the remains. It was stated that the farmer was not permitted {{to benefit from the}} gleanings, and was not permitted to discriminate among the poor, nor try to frighten them away with dogs or lions (Hullin 131a, Pe'ah 5:6) the farmer was not even allowed to help one of the poor to gather the left-overs. However, it was also {{argued that the}} law was only applicable in Canaan, (Jerusalem Talmud. Pe'ah 2:5) although many classical rabbinical writers who were based in Babylon observed the laws there (Hullin 134b) <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>also</b> <b>seen</b> as only applying to Jewish paupers, but poor non-Jews were allowed to benefit for the sake of civil peace (Gittin 59b).|$|E
25|$|The {{novel was}} {{published}} by Ebers in July 1826. Ebers became interested in Ainsworth's novel early on and started to add discussions about it in The Literary Souvenir {{in order to promote}} the work. Although the work was jointly written and sometimes claimed by Aston as solely his, many of the reviews described the novel as Ainsworth's alone. The novel also brought Ainsworth to the attention of historical novelist Walter Scott, who later wrote about the work in various articles; the two later met in 1828. During that year, J. G. Lockhartt published Scott's private journals and instigated the notion that the novel was an imitation of Scott. Sir John Chiverton is neither a true historical novel nor is it a gothic novel. <b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>also</b> <b>seen</b> by Ainsworth as an incomplete work and he later ignored it when creating his bibliography. The novel does serve as a precursor to Ainsworth's first major novel, Rookwood.|$|E

500|$|Released to {{negative}} reviews, Cyberpunk polarised the internet {{communities of the}} period. Detractors viewed it {{as an act of}} cooptation and opportunistic commercialisation. <b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>also</b> <b>seen</b> as part of a process that saw the overuse of the term [...] "cyberpunk" [...] until the word lost meaning. Alternatively, supporters saw Idol's efforts as harmless and well-intentioned, and were encouraged by his new interest in cyberculture.|$|E
500|$|Stunt co-ordinator Vince Deadrick Jr. choreographed the Ushaan fight scene between Shran and Archer, with stuntmen Gary Wayton and Kim Koscki {{doubling}} for Combs and Bakula in wide shots. The Ushaan-Tor {{itself was}} created by Dan Curry, whose previous work had included a variety of Klingon weapons including the bat'leth. The script had simply called for [...] "a dangerous-looking Andorian weapon", with the design fully coming from Curry. To demonstrate the different physiology of the Andorians, the make-up department created a quantity of blue blood for use in that scene. <b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>also</b> <b>seen</b> in a intravenous therapy prop in sickbay and for an earlier scene where Shran pours a quantity of it onto a Tellarite to issue his challenge.|$|E
500|$|At {{a meeting}} of Durham County Council on 26 July 1944, J.W. Foster, {{chairman}} of the Finance Committee of the council, spoke in favour of the proposals, claiming they would fulfill the Government's White Paper on Employment Policy, and its policy on the rehabilitation of depressed areas. [...] At the outbreak of war, {{the north of the}} country had still not fully recovered from the Great Depression of the 1930s, and Foster believed the employment the station's construction and maintenance provided would help prevent a return to those conditions. <b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>also</b> <b>seen</b> that the station would generally improve the supply of electricity for industry. He pointed out that the criticism of the scheme was based entirely on assumption that the station would [...] "destroy the Medieval charm of the city", without taking into account the thoughts of the experts who designed the station. He also pointed out that the critics made their comments without any suggestion of an alternative, and that their campaign against the scheme had attracted publicity through a BBC broadcast.|$|E

2500|$|This {{concept of}} [...] "seeds" [...] was espoused by the Sautrāntika in debate with the Sarvāstivādins over the metaphysical status of {{phenomena}} (dharmas). It is {{a precursor to}} the ālaya-vijñāna, the store-consciousness of the Yogācāra school which contains all these seeds. Originally [...] ālaya-vijñāna simply meant defiled consciousness: defiled by {{the workings of the}} five senses and the mind. <b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>also</b> <b>seen</b> as the mūla-vijñāna, the base-consciousness or [...] "stream of consciousness" [...] from which awareness and perception spring.|$|E
2500|$|According to Vreme’s {{military}} analyst Miloš Vasić the Graz agreement was [...] "the {{single most important}} document of the war" [...] and was meant to limit conflict between Serb and Croat forces by allowing both parties to concentrate on taking Bosniak territory from the Bosnian forces. The agreement was seen as Bosnian Croats betraying their Bosniak allies. <b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>also</b> <b>seen</b> as a sequel to the Karađorđevo agreement by the ICTY judgement in the Blaškić case.
