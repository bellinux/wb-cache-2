However, it is revealed in the following game, The Curse of Monkey Island, that the Carnival of the Damned seen in the LeChuck's Revenges conclusion was actually part of Monkey Island. The game's creator, Ron Gilbert, departed from Lucas Arts after the second game. He stated on his blog that he had a clear vision what the ending in the second game meant, how the story will develop from <b>here,</b> <b>and</b> <b>that</b> the story development Lucas Arts came up with in his absence was not close to his ideas.|$|E

In a July 2008 interview with Entertainment Weekly, Alan Moore {{had this to say}} about the use of the Guy Fawkes motif, adopted from his comic V for Vendetta: [...] "I was also quite heartened the other day when watching the news to see that there were demonstrations outside the Scientology headquarters over <b>here,</b> <b>and</b> <b>that</b> they suddenly flashed to a clip showing all these demonstrators wearing V for Vendetta [...] masks. That pleased me. That gave me a warm little glow." ...|$|E

500|$|The group {{obtained}} a duplicate nuclear football and Gold Codes card, {{and kept it}} in the situation room. (Reagan's football was still with the officer at the hospital, and Bush also had a card and football.) The participants discussed whether to raise the military's alert status, {{and the importance of}} doing so without changing the DEFCON level, although the number of Soviet submarines proved to be normal. Upon learning that Reagan was in surgery, Haig declared, the [...] "helm is right <b>here.</b> <b>And</b> <b>that</b> means right in this chair for now, constitutionally, until the vice president gets here." [...] However, Haig made an inaccurate statement. As the sitting Secretary of State, he was fourth behind Vice President [...] Bush, [...] Speaker of the House Tip O'Neill, and President pro tempore of the Senate Strom Thurmond in the line of succession and, under , O'Neill and Thurmond would have had to resign their positions to become acting president. Although others in the room knew that Haig's statement was constitutionally incorrect, they did not object at the time to avoid a confrontation.|$|E
500|$|Smith Hempstone {{later wrote}} that the former Prime Minister had {{resolved}} to [...] "go down... with all rhetorical guns blazing". This was in spite of increasingly unstable health; in June 1982 he collapsed in the House of Assembly, clutching at his side and shaking. Half {{a year later he}} had to arrange treatment in South Africa for a condition stemming from hardening of the arteries. The government's confiscation of his passport and two refusals of its return prevented him from going, so in April 1983 Smith successfully applied for a British passport. [...] "I'll still try to get my Zimbabwean passport back," [...] he said. [...] "I was born <b>here</b> <b>and</b> <b>that</b> is the passport I should travel on." [...] Smith regained his Zimbabwean papers after about a year. In 1984 he declared his intention to renounce his British nationality to abide by a new Zimbabwean law outlawing multiple citizenship. Britain did not recognise this legislation; according to Smith, British officials refused to take his UK passport when he tried to return it.|$|E
2500|$|Unlike {{his artistic}} ally Afanasy Fet, Maykov always {{felt the need}} for {{maintaining}} 'spiritual bonds' with common people and, according to biographer Yampolsky, followed [...] "the folk tradition set by Pushkin, Lermontov, Krylov and Koltsov". Yet he was skeptical {{of the doctrine of}} narodnost as formulated by Dobrolyubov and Chernyshevsky, who saw active promotion of the democratic movement as the mission of Russian literature. In 1853, horrified by Nekrasov's poem [...] "The Muse", Maykov wrote [...] "An Epistle to Nekrasov", in which he urged the latter to [...] "dilute his malice in nature's harmony." [...] Yet he never severed ties with his opponent and often gave him credit. [...] "There is only one poetic soul <b>here,</b> <b>and</b> <b>that</b> is Nekrasov," [...] Maykov wrote in an October 1854 letter to Ivan Nikitin.|$|E

2500|$|Scene I: Sir Oliver (as Mr. Stanley) now visits Joseph. Joseph, like Charles, {{does not}} {{recognise}} his long-lost uncle. He greets [...] "Stanley" [...] with effusive professions of goodwill, but refuses to give [...] "Stanley" [...] any financial assistance, saying he has donated {{all his money}} to support Charles. [...] "Stanley" [...] suggests that Sir Oliver would help {{him if he was}} <b>here,</b> <b>and</b> <b>that</b> Joseph might pass on some of what Sir Oliver has given him. But Joseph tells [...] "Stanley" [...] that Sir Oliver is in fact very stingy, and has given him nothing except trinkets such as tea, shawls, and [...] "Indian crackers". Furthermore, Joseph has lent a great deal to his brother, so that he has nothing left for [...] "Stanley". Sir Oliver is enraged, as he knows both statements are flat lies – he sent Joseph 12,000 pounds from India. He stifles his anger, and departs amid further effusions. Rowley arrives with a letter for Joseph announcing that Sir Oliver has arrived in town.|$|E
2500|$|In 1999, Bale played {{serial killer}} Patrick Bateman in American Psycho, {{director}} Mary Harron's adaptation of Bret Easton Ellis' controversial novel. Bale was briefly {{dropped from the}} project in favour of Leonardo DiCaprio, but DiCaprio eventually dropped out to star in The Beach, and Bale was cast once again. He researched his character by studying the novel and prepared himself physically for the role by spending months tanning and exercising {{in order to achieve}} the [...] "Olympian physique" [...] of the character as described in the original novel. He {{went so far as to}} distance himself from the cast and crew to maintain the darker side of Bateman's character. American Psycho premiered at the 2000 Sundance Film Festival to much controversy. Roger Ebert condemned the film at first, calling it pornography and [...] "the most loathed film at Sundance," [...] but gave it a favourable review, writing that Harron had [...] "transformed a novel about bloodlust into a film about men's vanity." [...] Of Bale's performance, he wrote, [...] "Christian Bale is heroic in the way he allows the character to leap joyfully into despicability; there is no instinct for self-preservation <b>here,</b> <b>and</b> <b>that</b> is one mark of a good actor." ...|$|E
2500|$|It {{will begin}} early – before {{some of us}} are up, no doubt, and it will {{continue}} late. [...] The sidewalks will be worse obstructed in every street than Wall-street is where the brokers are in full blast. Old beds and ricketty bedstands, handsome pianos and kitchen furniture, will be chaotically huddled together. [...] Everything will be in a muddle. Everybody in a hurry, smashing mirrors in his haste, and carefully guarding boot boxes from harm. Sofas that go out sound will go in maimed, tables that enjoyed castors will scratch along and [...] "tip" [...] on one less than its complement. [...] Bed-screws will be lost in the confusion, and many a good piece of furniture badly bruised in consequence. [...] Family pictures will be sadly marred, and the china will be a broken set before night, in many a house. All houses will be dirty – never so dirty – into which people move, and the dirt of the old will seem enviable beside the cleanliness of the new. [...] The old people will in their hearts murmur at these moving dispensations. The younger people, though aching in every bone, and [...] "tired to death," [...] will relish the change, and think the new closets more roomy and more nice, and delight themselves fancying how this piece of furniture will look <b>here</b> <b>and</b> <b>that</b> piece in the other corner. The still [...] "younger ones" [...] will still more enjoy it. [...] Into the cellar and upon the roof, into the rat-holes and on the yard fence, into each room and prying into every cupboard, they mill make reprisals of many things [...] "worth saving," [...] and mark the day white in their calendar, as little less to be longed for in the return than Fourth of July itself.Keep your tempers, good people. Don't growl at the carmen nor haggle over the price charged. When the scratched furniture comes in don't believe it is utterly ruined, – a few nails, a little glue, a piece of putty, and a pint of varnish will rejuvenate many articles that will grow very old 'twixt morning and night, and undo much of the mischief that comes of moving, and which at first sight seems irreparable.|$|E

2500|$|David Balls of Digital Spy {{gave the}} song a {{positive}} review: [...] "Unafraid {{to drop a}} line like [...] "My name's Shaniqua and what?", {{it was only a}} matter of time before N-Dubz turned their large underground following into mainstream success. Now, having shifted over 500,000 copies of debut disc Uncle B and reached No.1 alongside Tinchy Stryder, the Camden trio are aiming to become leaders of the Brrap pack with second album Against All Odds. Reflecting their move up pop's pecking order, this trailer single is their biggest, most bombastic moment yet. It's got hawkish sirens and loads of clubby synths - evidently inspired by Fraser T Smith's production on the Tinchy album - but N-Dubz haven't lost their usual quirky charm, dropping in oh-so-relevant references to Facebook and LBDs (that's [...] "little black dress", fellas). With an appeal that extends far beyond the back of the bus, 'I Need You' is – to borrow a word from the inimitable Dappy - probably best described as a [...] "smasher"." [...] Sarah-Louise James of the Daily Star reviewed the single as: [...] "British hip-house at its fizziest." [...] Alt-Uk.net reviewed the track: [...] "I Need You is an absolute fun-packed single from N-Dubz, and whilst listening to this one it really is difficult not to start singing along. N-Dubz once again demonstrates here a great knack for penning a perfect pop song, and this group certainly seems to know what it's doing when it comes to making the music as infectious as possible." [...] Fraser McAlpine of the BBC Chart Blog also positively reviewed the song, mentioning: [...] "It's this kind of bonkers happenstance which I love. I basically do internal bogglejumps whenever they do something like that. Pop songs are so safe, and N-Dubz seem to wander over the lines of acceptable behaviour almost as if they don't realise they are there." [...] The Chemistry Is Dead described the single as being [...] "much more mainstream" [...] as well as something that would [...] "appeal to their old fans and new fans alike." [...] Inside Gossip labelled [...] "I Need You" [...] as a [...] "club banger that has set the standards and told the world that they are <b>here</b> <b>and</b> <b>that</b> they are not one hit wonders." ...|$|E
