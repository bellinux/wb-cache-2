40|$|Small agglomerative {{microphone}} array {{systems have been}} proposed for use with speech communication and recognition systems. Blind source separation methods based on frequency domain independent component analysis have shown significant separation performance, and the {{microphone array}}s are small enough to make them portable. However, the level of computational complexity involved is very high because the conventional signal collection and processing method uses 60 microphones. In this paper, we propose a band selection method based on magnitude squared coherence. Frequency bands are selected based on the spatial and geometric characteristics of the microphone array device which is strongly related to the dodecahedral shape, and the selected bands are nonuniformly spaced. The estimated reduction in the computational complexity is 90 % with a 68 % {{reduction in the number}} of <b>frequency</b> <b>bands.</b> <b>Separation</b> performance achieved during our experimental evaluation was 7. 45 [*](dB) (signal-to-noise ratio) and 2. 30 [*](dB) (cepstral distortion).

The DMT scheme is realized by a transceiver that divides the frequency selective channel into {{a set of}} frequency nonselective parallel subchannels.

40|$|International audienceIn this work, a new {{base station}} antenna is proposed. Two {{separate}} <b>frequency</b> <b>bands</b> with separate radiating elements {{are used in}} each <b>band.</b> The <b>frequency</b> <b>band</b> <b>separation</b> ratio is about 1. 3 : 1. These elements are arranged with different spacing (wider spacing for the lower <b>frequency</b> <b>band,</b> and narrower spacing for the higher <b>frequency</b> <b>band).</b> Isolation between bands inherently exists in this approach. This avoids the grating lobe effect, and mitigates the beam narrowing (dispersion) seen with fixed element spacing covering the whole wide bandwidth. A new low-profile cross dipole is designed, which is integrated in the array with an EBG/AMC structure for reducing the size of low band elements and decreasing coupling at high band...|$|R
50|$|Unlike {{traditional}} dial-up modems, which modulate bits into {{signals in}} the 300-3400 Hz baseband (voice service), DSL modems modulate frequencies from 4000 Hz to {{as high as}} 4 MHz. This <b>frequency</b> <b>band</b> <b>separation</b> enables DSL service and {{plain old telephone service}} (POTS) to coexist on the same copper pair facility. On the subscriber's end of the circuit, inline low-pass DSL filters (splitters) are installed on each telephone to filter the high-frequency signals that would otherwise be heard as hiss, but pass voice frequencies. Conversely, high-pass filters already incorporated in the circuitry of DSL modems filter out voice frequencies. Although ADSL and RADSL modulations do not use the voice-frequency band, nonlinear elements in the phone could otherwise generate audible intermodulation and may impair the operation of the data modem in the absence of high-pass filters.|$|R
40|$|Abstractâ€”Discrete multitone {{modulation}} transceivers (DMTs) {{have been}} shown to be very useful for data transmission over frequency selective channels. The DMT scheme is realized by a transceiver that divides the channel into subbands. The efficiency of the scheme depends on the frequency selectivity of the transmit-ting and receiving filters. The receiving filters with good stopband attenuation are also desired for combating narrowband noise. The filterbank transceiver or discrete wavelet multitone (DWMT) system has been proposed as an implementation of the DMT transceiver that has better <b>frequency</b> <b>band</b> <b>separation,</b> but usually, inrtersymbol interference (ISI) cannot be completely canceled in these filterbank transceivers, and additional equalization is required.

A single-layer, multi-band microstrip patch antenna is described, which operates over the frequency ranges of the Iridium and Globalstar satellite communication systems, 1. 6 and 2. 5 GHz. The attenna excites: the TM 10 and TM 30 resonant modes which can operate with either dual linear polarisation or either hand of circular polarisation.

40|$|AbstractThe {{purpose of}} this study is to observe the effect of mutual {{coupling}} on microstrip antenna (MSAs). A modification is done in such a way that, a gap coupling is used to increase the <b>separation</b> between the <b>frequency</b> <b>bands.</b> Before this phenomenon was introduced, there were problems such as destructive interference caused by the multiple resonant frequencies which implies the mutual coupling effect. In multi-resonant configurations, separation between the resonant frequencies is varied to make them operate in desired <b>frequency</b> <b>band.</b> The <b>separation</b> between the resonant frequencies of individual elements, is sufficiently increased and by appropriately providing the matching for different resonances, dual or multi frequency operation is obtained. Also, a brief summary of radiation characteristics of these microstrip antennas is presented, which can help in deciding whether these structures are suitable for their use in various applications with particular requirement for radiation pattern.

40|$|For size {{miniaturization}} {{and cost}} reduction, {{the design of}} dual band devices has become an emerging research area in recent years. A desirable dual-band solution should offer size compactness, high performance (e. g. low insertion loss) and compatible with conventional printed circuit broad (PCB) technology, especially microstrip lines. In this research, several new devices, including rat-race coupler, power divider and crossover junction, capable of operating at dual <b>frequency</b> <b>bands</b> are proposed. These structures involve only simple branch-line sections and a minimal number of shunt stubs. All characteristic impedances are ranged from 20 O to 100 O. Most designs can operate with wide frequency spacing between the two bands. These designs offer low insertion loss as well as good return loss performances, and are small in size, in compared to the broadband approach. For design purposes, explicit closed-form equations are derived {{for the evaluation of}} circuit parameters. In addition, the usable range of these devices with respect to <b>frequency</b> <b>band</b> <b>separation</b> is examined. For verification, various prototypes are constructed by using microstrip technology and in-house fabrication facilities. Both simulated and measured results are presented and compared with state-of-the-art examples. Microwave passive couplers are widely used in microwave and millimeter-wave applications and communication systems. Common examples are branch line coupler, rat race coupler, power divider, and crossover junction. They are used for the dividing, combining and re-directing of signal power. Very often, a passive coupler utilizes simple quarter-wavelength transmission lines for implementation which will lead to narrow-band operation. Therefore, it is difficult to deploy such circuit for wide-band or multi-band applications. Multi-section topologies may be used to broaden the operating bandwidth, with which the major drawbacks are enlarged circuit size and the requirement of extreme high (or low) branch-line characteristic impedances. Both are not attractive for mass and low cost production. Conventional design approaches are, therefore, not suitable for modern communication systems with multi-band operation. Wong, Fai Leung.

40|$|Abstract â€” In {{each country}} today, {{cellular}} networks operate on carefully separated <b>frequency</b> <b>bands.</b> This careful <b>separation</b> is {{imposed by the}} regulators of the given country to avoid the interference between these networks. But, the separation is only valid for the network operators within the borders of their country, hence the operators are left {{on their own to}} resolve cross-border interference of their cellular networks. In this paper, we focus on the scenario of two operators, who want to fine-tune the emitting power of the pilot signals (i. e., beacon signals) of their base stations. This operation is crucial, because the pilot signal power determines the number of users they can attract and hence the revenue they can obtain. In the case of no power costs, we show that operators should be strategic in their borders, meaning to fine-tune the emitting power of their pilot signals. In addition, we study Nash equilibrium conditions in an empirical model and show the efficiency of the Nash equilibria for different user densities. Finally, we modify our game model to take power costs into account. In the model with power costs, the players should still be strategic, but their strategic behavior results in a well-known Prisonerâ€™s Dilemma and hence in a sub-optimal Nash equilibrium.
