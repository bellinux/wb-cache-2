25|$|An {{important}} {{benefit of}} an ETF is the stock-like features offered. A mutual fund is bought or {{sold at the}} end of a day's trading, whereas ETFs can be traded whenever the market is open. Since ETFs trade on the market, investors can carry out the same types of trades that they can with a stock. For instance, investors can sell short, use a limit order, use a stop-loss order, buy on margin, and invest as much or as little money as they wish (there is no minimum <b>investment</b> <b>requirement).</b> Also, many ETFs have the capability for options (puts and calls) to be written against them. Covered call strategies allow investors and traders to potentially increase their returns on their ETF purchases by collecting premiums (the proceeds of a call sale or write) on calls written against them. Mutual funds do not offer those features.|$|E

A {{subsidiary}} of the JBG Cos., Wardman Investor LLC, filed a notice with the city's Contract Appeals Board in early 2009 to have the entire project set aside for being an [...] "invalid sole source procurement". JBG Cos. argued that the original proposal required the hotel to be built on private land and financed with private money. JBG did not submit a proposal because it could not meet these conditions.

50|$|In {{terms of}} {{asymmetric}} information assumption, borrowers are better informed than lenders about {{the persistence of}} their output shocks. If borrowers default at first period, upon observing this default, lenders will make an inference about the likely realization {{of the magnitude of}} borrowers’ first period shocks indirectly and update their expectations to be pessimistic on borrowers’ future output and their repayment prospects on future loans. Although borrowers can get fresh lending again, they need to pay higher interest rates than the case they did not default in the past. The gap between the interest rates for fresh lending with and without past default is defined as default premium, which can also be seen as the difference between the new debt issue prices with and without past default. Therefore, if borrowers default, they will face a positive default premium, namely higher interest rates and lower new debt issuing price. If the <b>investment</b> <b>requirement</b> is relatively inelastic, in another word, the amount of <b>investment</b> <b>requirement</b> relatively not affected by debt issuing price, borrowers have to issue more debts to compensate for low issue prices to acquire the required amount of investment. As a result, the ratio of debt to expected output increases and induce higher probability of future default.|$|E

5000|$|Centrifugal casting, also {{commonly}} known as spin casting is typically used for industrial manufacturing of cast parts. It {{was the work of}} A. G.

Centrifugal casting {{is one of the few}} casting processes that can be used both to manufacture metals as well as plastic parts.

Spin casting or centrifugal casting is considered to be a relatively inexpensive process ranging to a total cost of no more than a $20,000 <b>investment</b> <b>requirement,</b> in comparison to a process such as investment molding that costs a lot more (usually millions).

40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{consists of}} three essays, of which two are related. In the first essay I model the interaction between a franchisor and its franchisees. I examine how a franchisor uses the <b>investment</b> <b>requirements</b> she asks franchisees {{as a tool to}} reduce franchisees' underprovision of sales effort. Theoretically, I show that if the franchisor's reputation is highly important the franchisor asks for higher <b>investment</b> <b>requirements</b> when penalizing a misbehaving franchise is more difficult (weaker law enforcement) and when directly monitoring franchisees is more costly. In the second essay, I empirically test the theoretical predictions of the first essay using two datasets at the franchisor level. I measure weak law enforcement using the passing of state level good-cause termination/nonrenewal laws for franchise contracts and I measure monitoring costs using the number of states in which a franchisor operates. Using a database that contains information for 278 franchisors, before and after the laws were passed in some states, I find that the passing of the laws implied an incremental 4. 7 % increase in <b>investment</b> <b>requirements</b> for franchisors located in states where the laws were passed. Using a large database (10, 047 franchisor-year observations), posterior to the passing of the laws, I find that franchisors located in states where good-cause termination/nonrenewal laws were passed ask for <b>investment</b> <b>requirements</b> 4. 5 % higher than franchisors located in states without such laws. Using both datasets I find evidence that franchisors that expand their operations to an additional state increase the average <b>investment</b> <b>requirements</b> they ask a prospective franchisee between 0. 6 - 1 %. The third essay, which is in conjunction with Gordon Phillips, empirically studies how financial distress and bankruptcy affects firms' choices of product quality and prices using data from the airline industry. We find that an airline's quality and pricing decisions are differentially affected by financial distress and bankruptcy. Product quality decreases when airlines are in financial distress, consistent with financial distress reducing a firm's incentive to invest in quality. In addition, firms price more aggressively when in financial distress consistent with them trying to increase short-term market share and revenues. In contrast, in bankruptcy product quality increases relative to financial distress periods...|$|R

The three-person board of trustees, presides by Mrs Isabelle Cart, owns the full confidence by the Weber family. The master plan presented on 31 March 2015 includes the renovation of the cement sculptures of the water garden {{within the next two}} years, hence, temporarily some of the sculptures are not accessible to the public when the park was re-opened on 4 April 2015, and, despite the entry fee had to be raised. The renovation of the infrastructure and the consolidation of the financial base are set on the schedule of the new board of trustees to 2018 respectively 2022. As of September 2015, the canton of Aargau still stops its financial support, unless a master plan will be presented by the board of trustees. The sculptures and structures, exposed for decades to wind and weather, must be rehabilitated, by overall an <b>investment</b> <b>requirement</b> of 2 to 2.5 million Swiss Francs; at least 250,000 Swiss Francs immediately, and additional 200,000 Swiss Francs a year are needed for longtime operation of the Bruno Weber Park.|$|E
