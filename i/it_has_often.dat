5|$|The Jockey Club {{decided not}} to re-run the race, {{and as a result}} <b>it</b> <b>has</b> <b>often</b> been called the race that never was. Bookmakers were forced to refund an {{estimated}} £75 million in bets staked. The Jockey Club launched an inquiry which led to a number of changes in the starting and recall procedures in future races.|$|E
5|$|However, <b>it</b> <b>has</b> <b>often</b> {{been the}} case that league players have joined Andover after {{retiring}} from professional football. One of the most notable of these in modern times is Matt Crossley, who ended {{his career with the}} Lions after playing more than 100 matches for Wycombe Wanderers. After leaving Andover in 2001, Crossley later became assistant manager at Woking where he gained notoriety in December 2006 after he headbutted an opposing player who had tried to break up a fight. Maurice Evans is another former professional who, after briefly taking over as Andover's player-manager in 1967, went on to lead Reading to the Fourth Division championship, and Oxford United to Milk Cup victory.|$|E

5|$|<b>It</b> <b>has</b> <b>often</b> been {{claimed that}} ceratopsian dinosaurs were herding animals, {{due to the}} large number of known bone beds {{containing}} multiple members of the same ceratopsian species. In 2010, Hunt and Farke pointed out that this was mainly true for centrosaurine ceratopsians. Horner assumed that the horned dinosaurs at Landslide Butte lived in herds that had been killed by drought or disease. Dodson concluded that the fact that the Achelousaurus bone beds were monospecific (containing only one species) confirmed the existence of herds.|$|E
5|$|It is {{difficult}} to discuss the MSA of Africa without first considering the immense size of the continent. There are archaeological sites and evidence from across the continent, and, {{for the sake of}} ease, <b>it</b> <b>has</b> <b>often</b> been divided into five regions: northern Africa, which is often, though not without controversy, taken into consideration more so with Southwest Asia and Europe than with the rest of Africa; eastern Africa, stretching roughly from the highlands of Ethiopia to the southern part of Kenya; central Africa, which is arguably the least explored region, stretching from the borders of Tanzania and Kenya to include Angola; southern Africa, which includes the numerous cave sites of South Africa; and western Africa.|$|E
5|$|On May 18, 1980, a major {{volcanic}} eruption occurred at Mount St. Helens, a volcano located in Skamania County, {{in the state}} of Washington, United States. The eruption (a VEI 5 event) was the most significant {{volcanic eruption}} to occur in the contiguous 48 U.S. states since the 1915 eruption of Lassen Peak in California. <b>It</b> <b>has</b> <b>often</b> been declared as the most disastrous volcanic eruption in United States history. The eruption was preceded by a two-month series of earthquakes and steam-venting episodes, caused by an injection of magma at shallow depth below the volcano that created a large bulge and a fracture system on the mountain's north slope.|$|E

5|$|String bikinis {{and other}} {{revealing}} clothes {{are common in}} surfing, though most surfing bikinis are more robust with more coverage than sunning bikinis. Surfing Magazine printed a pictorial of Kymberly Herrin, Playboy Playmate March 1981, surfing in a revealing bikini, and eventually started an annual bikini issue. The Association of Surfing Professionals often pairs female surf meets with bikini contests, an issue that divides the female pro-surfing community into two parts. <b>It</b> <b>has</b> <b>often</b> been more profitable to win the bikini contest than the female surfing event.|$|E
5|$|The {{placement}} of P.auricoma within Parasola is somewhat controversial. <b>It</b> <b>has</b> <b>often</b> been {{classified in the}} section Auricomi, a grouping of species characterized {{by the absence of}} a veil, and the occasional presence of caulocystidia (cystidia on the stem), pileocystidia (cystidia on the cap surface), or dark setae-like elements. Several molecular phylogenetics studies have confirmed its inclusion in the Parasola clade, but its relationship to other members of the group have not been fully resolved due to limited sampling. A recent analysis suggests that in the phylogenetic tree of Parasola, P.auricoma and P.conopilus form a tritomy with the crown Parasola species.|$|E
5|$|The {{stone was}} venerated at the Kaaba in pre-Islamic pagan times. According to Islamic tradition, {{it was set}} intact into the Kaaba's wall by the prophet Muhammad in the year 605 AD, five years before his first revelation. Since then it has been broken {{into a number of}} {{fragments}} and is now cemented into a silver frame {{in the side of the}} Kaaba. Its physical appearance is that of a fragmented dark rock, polished smooth by the hands of pilgrims. Islamic tradition holds that it fell from heaven as a guide for Adam and Eve to build an altar. <b>It</b> <b>has</b> <b>often</b> been described as a meteorite, a hypothesis which is now uncertain.|$|E

5|$|Thorpe, {{whose parents}} were both half Caucasian, was raised as an American Indian. His accomplishments {{occurred}} {{during a period of}} severe racial inequality in the United States. <b>It</b> <b>has</b> <b>often</b> been suggested that his medals were stripped because of his ethnicity.* Elfers. pg. 18 While it is difficult to prove this, the public comment at the time largely reflected this view. At the time Thorpe won his gold medals, not all Native Americans were recognized as U.S.citizens. (The U.S.government had wanted them to make concessions to adopt European-American ways to receive such recognition.) Citizenship was not granted to all American Indians until 1924.|$|E
5|$|Though child-sized bikinis {{appeared}} in the 1950s, in many European countries, swimsuits under size 11 are commonly not sold with a top part, but in the United States, Britain, and Canada, <b>it</b> <b>has</b> <b>often</b> been considered unacceptable for girls in late childhood (ages 7–11) to go topless. Several incidents of families being evicted from public pools due to their child being topless have been reported. In 2002, clothing retailer Abercrombie & Fitch came under criticism for selling child-sized thong bikinis and underwear.|$|E
5|$|Berge Meere und Giganten presciently invokes {{such topics}} as world war, urbanization, the {{alienation}} from nature, mechanization, the dehumanization of the modern world, as well as mass migration, globalization, totalitarianism, fanaticism, terrorism, state surveillance, genetic engineering, synthetic food, the breeding of humans, biochemical warfare, and others. Döblin's experiences during the First World War, when he served in Alsace as a military doctor, left their mark on the novel: psychically damaged veterans, devastated landscapes, and all-destructive technological excesses give this novel its particularly apocalyptic feeling. Because of the bleak {{vision of the future}} that the novel presents, <b>it</b> <b>has</b> <b>often</b> been described by critics as a fundamentally pessimistic, irrationalistic, or regressive work. Hannelore Qual argues against this that Berge Meere und Giganten is instead characterized by an optimistic view of social and historical perfectibility; the portrayals of catastrophic destruction and brutally authoritarian regimes reflect, in this reading, not Döblin's own world view but instead different historical possibilities, alongside which more egalitarian and peaceful social orders are to be found.|$|E

5|$|Due to the town's {{traditional}} seaside appearance, <b>it</b> <b>has</b> <b>often</b> {{been used}} as a setting for television programmes and films. The seafront has been featured in programmes such as the ITV period drama Upstairs, Downstairs, the 1984 BBC seaside comedy Cockles, CBBC's The Tweenies and the BBC comedy Little Britain. The town's railway station was seen in an episode of the 1970s comedy Some Mothers Do 'Ave 'Em. The town has featured in movies such as Ken Russell's French Dressing, and The Medusa Touch, starring Richard Burton. In fiction, Jeeves from the stories by P. G. Wodehouse regularly holidays at the town, spending much of his time there fishing. Herne Bay was the hometown of the three main characters in the 1990s BBC sitcom, Game On.|$|E
5|$|In 1497 Bristol was the {{starting}} point for John Cabot's voyage of exploration to North America. For many years Bristol merchants had bought freeze-dried cod, called stockfish, from Iceland for consumption in England. However the Hanseatic League, which was trying to control North Atlantic trade at this time, sought to cut off supplies to English merchants. <b>It</b> <b>has</b> <b>often</b> been suggested that this drove Bristol's merchants to look West for new sources of cod fish. On the other hand, while Bristol merchants did largely abandon Iceland in the late-15th century, Hull merchants continued to trade there. Moreover, recent research has shown that England's fisheries off Iceland actually grew significantly from the 1490s, albeit the centre for this activity shifted from Bristol to East Anglia. This makes it hard to sustain the argument that Bristol merchants were somehow 'pushed out' of Iceland.|$|E
5|$|In 1961, {{the third}} species, P. cyrtocristatus was named by John Ostrom. Its three known specimens, {{have been found}} in the Fruitland and Kaiparowits {{formations}} from Utah and New Mexico. The second specimen, the first known from the Kaiparowits Formation, was originally unassigned to a specific taxon. Of the Parasaurolophus species, P. cyrtocristatus it is the smallest, and has the most curved crest. Because of its possession of the two above features, <b>it</b> <b>has</b> <b>often</b> been speculated that it was a female of P. walkeri or P. tubicen, which were males, although P. tubicen lived approximately a million years later. As noted by Thomas Williamson, the type material of P. cyrtocristatus is about 72% the size of P. tubicen, close to the size at which other lambeosaurines are interpreted to begin showing definitive sexual dimorphism in their crests (~70% of adult size). Even though many scientists have supported the possible fact of P. cyrtocristatus being a female, many other studies have found that it is not, because of the differences in age, distribution, and the large differences in the crest and its internal structure.|$|E
50|$|Babylonia {{was subject}} to and {{dominated}} by Assyria during the Neo-Assyrian period (911-616 BC), as <b>it</b> <b>had</b> <b>often</b> been during the Middle Assyrian Empire (1365-1020 BC). The Assyrians of Upper Mesopotamia had usually been able to pacify their southern relations through military might, installing puppet kings, or granting increased privileges.|$|R
60|$|The Council talked {{over this}} report for some days, {{and then the}} king {{made up his mind}} that he would judge for himself, and pretend to be his own ambassador.

5|$|It {{had been}} the {{tradition}} of the Sociedad to elect the First Lady of Argentina as president of the charity. But the ladies of the Sociedad did not approve of Eva Perón's impoverished background, lack of formal education, and former career as an actress. Fraser and Navarro write that the ladies of the Sociedad were afraid that Evita would set a bad example for the orphans, therefore the society ladies did not extend to Evita the position of president of their organization. <b>It</b> <b>has</b> <b>often</b> been said that Evita had the government funding for the Sociedad cut off in retaliation. Fraser and Navarro suggest that this version of events is in dispute, but that the government funding that had previously supported the Sociedad now went to support Evita's own foundation. The Fundación María Eva Duarte de Perón was created on 8 July 1948. It was later renamed to, simply, the Eva Perón Foundation. Its funding began with 10,000 pesos provided by Evita herself.|$|E
5|$|Since medical {{literature}} began to describe homosexuality, <b>it</b> <b>has</b> <b>often</b> been approached from {{a view that}} sought to find an inherent psychopathology as the root cause, influenced by the theories of Sigmund Freud. Although he considered bisexuality inherent in all people, and said that most have phases of homosexual attraction or experimentation, exclusive same-sex attraction he attributed to stunted development resulting from trauma or parental conflicts. Much literature on mental health and lesbians centered on their depression, substance abuse, and suicide. Although these issues exist among lesbians, discussion about their causes shifted after homosexuality {{was removed from the}} Diagnostic and Statistical Manual in 1973. Instead, social ostracism, legal discrimination, internalization of negative stereotypes, and limited support structures indicate factors homosexuals face in Western societies that often adversely affect their mental health.|$|E
5|$|In 1955, Soviet {{paleontologist}} Evgeny Maleev named a new species, Tyrannosaurus bataar, from Mongolia. By 1965, {{this species}} had been renamed Tarbosaurus bataar. Despite the renaming, many phylogenetic analyses have found Tarbosaurus bataar {{to be the}} sister taxon of Tyrannosaurus rex, and <b>it</b> <b>has</b> <b>often</b> been considered an Asian species of Tyrannosaurus. A recent redescription of the skull of Tarbosaurus bataar has shown that it was much narrower than that of Tyrannosaurus rex and that during a bite, the distribution of stress in the skull {{would have been very}} different, closer to that of Alioramus, another Asian tyrannosaur. A related cladistic analysis found that Alioramus, not Tyrannosaurus, was the sister taxon of Tarbosaurus, which, if true, would suggest that Tarbosaurus and Tyrannosaurus should remain separate. The discovery and description of Qianzhousaurus would later disprove this and revealed that Alioramus belonged to the clade Alioramini. The discovery of the tyrannosaurid Lythronax further indicates that Tarbosaurus and Tyrannosaurus are closely related, forming a clade with fellow Asian tyrannosaurid Zhuchengtyrannus, with Lythronax being their sister taxon. A further study from 2016 by Steve Brusatte, Thomas Carr et al., also indicates Tyrannosaurus may have been an immigrant from Asia, as well as a possible descendent of Tarbosaurus. The study further indicates the possibility that Tyrannosaurus may have driven other tyrannosaurids that were native to North America extinct through competition. Other finds in 2006 indicate giant tyrannosaurs may have been present in North America as early as 75 million years ago. Whether or not this specimen belongs to Tyrannosaurus rex, a new species of Tyrannosaurus, or a new genus entirely is still unknown.|$|E
