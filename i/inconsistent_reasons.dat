40|$|National audienceIn the {{framework}} of the study of the Environmental links to physical activity, nutrition and health (ELIANE), we performed a systematic review of the associations between objective spatial measurements of the built environment and weight status in youth. Of the 25 identified papers, 18 reported at least one significant relationship, although only almost one-third of the associations tested were significant. Inverse relationships of weight with different walkability indices were the most consistent (7 / 9 papers). Weight was also positively related to spatial accessibility to convenience stores (3 / 6 papers), and inversely to the accessibility to recreational physical activity facilities (4 / 9 papers).

40|$|Abstract Background Sterile syringe {{access is}} a {{critical}} component of HIV prevention programs. Although retail pharmacies provide convenient outlets for syringe access, injection drug users (IDUs) may encounter barriers to syringe purchase even where purchase without a prescription is legal. We sought to obtain an objective measure of syringe access in Tijuana, Mexico, where IDUs report being denied or overcharged for syringes at pharmacies. Methods Trained "mystery shoppers" attempted to buy a 1 cc insulin syringe according to a predetermined script at all retail pharmacies in three Tijuana neighborhoods. The same pharmacies were surveyed by telephone regarding their syringe sales policies. Data on purchase attempts were analyzed using basic statistics to obtain an objective measure of syringe access and compared with data on stated sales policies to ascertain consistency. Results Only 46 (28. 4 %) of 162 syringe purchase attempts were successful. Leading reasons for unsuccessful attempts were being told that the pharmacy didn't sell syringes (35. 3 %), there were no syringes in stock (31. 0 %), or a prescription was required (20. 7 %). Of 136 pharmacies also surveyed by telephone, a majority (88. 2 %) reported selling syringes but only one-third (32. 5 %) had a successful mystery shopper purchase; the majority of unsuccessful purchases were attributed to being told the pharmacy didn't sell syringes. There was similar discordance regarding prescription policies: 74 pharmacies said in the telephone survey that they did not require a prescription for syringes, yet 10 of these pharmacies asked the mystery shopper for a prescription. Conclusions IDUs in Tijuana have limited access to syringes through retail pharmacies and policies and practices regarding syringe sales are <b>inconsistent.</b> <b>Reasons</b> for these restrictive and inconsistent practices must be identified and addressed to expand syringe access, reduce syringe sharing and prevent HIV transmission. </p...|$|E

Three studies have examined the link between saturated fat intake and intraparenchymal hemorrhage, consistently showing an inverse association. However, the association for ischemic stroke is less clear, although it is generally inverse. As for myocardial infarction, the findings in Japanese studies are inconsistent, as are those of Western studies. The JPHC study, however, found a positive association, the first report in Asia.

The results of a number of experimental animal studies also showed that cell therapy (bone marrow cells [BMCs], hematopoietic stem cells [HSCs], mesenchymal stem cells [MSCs]) might have the potential to rescue animals from organ injuries. However, when BMCs or HSCs were injected into rodents subjected to ischemic or toxin-induced acute tubular necrosis (ATN), the results with regard to whether they could rescue rodents from ATN were <b>inconsistent.</b> The <b>reasons</b> for the conflicting results of BMC or HSC therapy in ATN are unknown, but {{may be due to the}} different types of cells injected, number of cells injected, route of injection, or injury model of acute renal failure. It is known that MSCs can contribute to renal tubular regeneration after ATN, although the exact mechanism, either transdifferentiation or effects of paracrine/cytokines, is uncertain. In the future, the most pertinent issue is to determine how MSCs protect the renal tubule from injury, and then to imitate this protective or reparative effect pharmacologically...|$|R

This system consists of grain “banker plants” infested with R. padi, an alternative hosts for the parasitoid Aphidius colemani. Thus A. colemani can reproduce on the banker plant when M. persicae populations are low.

In this study, using a protocol based on a combination of both kinetic and equilibrium binding approaches, we have assessed the expression and the density of M 1 -M 5 muscarinic cholinergic receptors in the hippocampus of Fisher 344 rats aged 6, 15 and 22 months. An age-related decrease of the density of M 1 receptor was found in pyramidal neurons of the CA 1 subfield. In this area, other subtypes of muscarinic receptors were unchanged {{with the exception of a}} loss of M 2 receptor in the radial layer. In the CA 3 subfield, receptor changes involved M 2, M 3 and M 5 subtypes, whereas in the dentate gyrus, the main changes affected M 1 and M 2 receptors of the granular layer and M 2 and M 3 receptors of the molecular layer. The above findings indicate that analysis of age-related changes of different muscarinic cholinergic receptors might represent a useful contribution to identifying the basis of cholinergic neurotransmission impairment in adult-onset cognitive dysfunction...|$|R

Unsupervised learning approaches may assist in understanding disease heterogeneity. Methods We selected 31 phenotypic variables and 12 SNPs from five candidate genes in 308 subjects in the National Emphysema Treatment Trial (NETT) Genetics Ancillary Study cohort. We used factor analysis to select a subset of phenotypic variables, and then used cluster analysis to identify subtypes of severe emphysema. We examined the phenotypic and genotypic characteristics of each cluster. Results We identified six factors accounting for 75 % of the shared variability among our initial phenotypic variables. We selected four phenotypic variables from these factors for cluster analysis: 1) post-bronchodilator FEV 1 percent predicted, 2) percent bronchodilator responsiveness, and quantitative CT measurements of 3) apical emphysema and 4) airway wall thickness. K-means cluster analysis revealed four clusters, though separation between clusters was modest: 1) emphysema predominant, 2) bronchodilator responsive, with higher FEV 1; 3) discordant, with a lower FEV 1 despite less severe emphysema and lower airway wall thickness, and 4) airway predominant. Of the genotypes examined, membership in cluster 1 (emphysema-predominant) was associated with TGFB 1 SNP rs 1800470.

40|$|The {{therapeutic}} transplantation of olfactory ensheathing cells (OECs) {{is being}} trialled in humans for spinal injury regeneration and other neural disorders. However in humans and in animal models of these therapies, {{the results have}} been limited or <b>inconsistent.</b> One <b>reason</b> for the variation in results is that it is often assumed that OECs are a uniform population of cells that have the same characteristics, and are therefore uniformly suitable for neural regenerative therapies. We have now used time-lapse imaging of OEC interactions to examine in detail the behavioural characteristics of anatomical and developmental subpopulations of OECs. We have found that OECs are a heterogeneous population of cells with fundamental differences in their behaviour and migration. Not only were peripheral OECs significantly different from OECs derived from the olfactory bulb, but OECs from different anatomical regions of the olfactory bulb displayed vastly different characteristics. These behaviours were consistent with their proposed roles in vivo with OECs from the olfactory bulb display a mix of adhesion, repulsion or indifference following cell-cell contact. Consistent with our previous findings, lamellipodial waves along the shaft of the OEC processes are always associated with initiating cell-cell contact and mediating the resultant behaviours of both peripheral and central OECs. These results have important implications for the use of OECs in neural regeneration therapies as it is clear that OECs are not a uniform population of cells. Instead, these cells display distinct behavioural differences depending on their topographical location and age. These differences in cell origin and behaviour are likely to contribute to the variations in OEC transplantation outcomes...|$|R

This study used a new non-immersive virtual reality assessment of executive functions known as JEF© (the Jansari Assessment of Executive Function) alongside the ‘classic’ Stroop Colour- Word task to assess the effects of a normal dose of caffeinated coffee on executive function. Method: Using a double-blind, counterbalanced within participants procedure 43 participants were administered either a caffeinated or decaffeinated coffee and completed the ‘JEF©’ and Stroop tasks, as well as a subjective mood scale and blood pressure pre- and post condition on two separate occasions a week apart. JEF© yields measures for eight separate aspects of executive functions, in addition to a total average score. Results: Findings indicate that performance was significantly improved on the planning, creative thinking, event-, time- and action-based prospective memory, as well as total JEF© score following caffeinated coffee relative to the decaffeinated coffee. The caffeinated beverage significantly decreased reaction times on the Stroop task, but there was no effect on Stroop interference. Conclusion: The results provide further support for the effects of a caffeinated beverage on cognitive functioning. In particular, it has demonstrated the ability of JEF© to detect the effects of caffeine across a number of executive functioning constructs, which weren’t shown in the Stroop task, suggesting executive functioning improvements {{as a result of a}} ‘typical’ dose of caffeine may only be detected by the use of more real-world, ecologically valid tasks...|$|R

Design: Retrospective, case series Methods: Chart review of all patients discharged from Aga Khan University Hospital between January 1988 - December 2012 (24 years) with anaphylaxis definition as per second National Institute of Allergy and Infection disease/Food Allergy and Anaphylaxis Network Symposium Results: Total of 129 cases were found with mean age of 41. 6 years (SD 18. 8). Majority of patients had cutaneous features (76. 7 %), followed by respiratory (68. 9 %), cardiac (64. 3 %) and gastrointestinal (20. 9 %) symptoms respectively. About 22. 4 % of patients had positive history for allergens out of which 31 % (n= 9) {{were exposed to the}} same allergens.

40|$|The {{pathogenesis}} of {{bipolar disorder}} may involve, {{at least in}} part, aberrations in serotonergic neurotransmission. Hence, serotonergic genes are attractive targets for association studies of bipolar disorder. We have reviewed the literature in this field. It is difficult to synthesize results as only one polymorphism per gene was typically investigated in relatively small samples. Nevertheless, suggestive associations are available for the 5 HT 2 A receptor and the serotonin transporter genes. With the availability of extensive polymorphism data and high throughput genotyping techniques, comprehensive evaluation of these genes using adequately powered samples is warranted. We also report on our investigations of the serotonin transporter, SLC 6 A 4 (17 q 11. 1 -q 12). An insertion/deletion polymorphism (5 HTTLPR) in the promoter region of this gene has been investigated intensively. However, {{the results have been}} <b>inconsistent.</b> We <b>reasoned</b> that other polymorphism/s may contribute to the associations and the inconsistencies may be due to variations in linkage disequilibrium (LD) patterns between samples. Therefore, we conducted LD analyses, as well as association and linkage using 12 polymorphisms, including 5 HTTLPR. We evaluated two samples. The first sample consisted of 135 US Caucasian nuclear families having a proband with bipolar I disorder (BDI, DSM IV criteria) and available parents. For case-control analyses, the patients from these families were compared with cord blood samples from local Caucasian live births (n = 182). Our second, independent sample was recruited through the Systematic Treatment Enhancement Program for Bipolar Disorder (STEP-BD, 545 cases, 548 controls). No significant associations were detected at the individual polymorphism or haplotype level using the case-control or family-based analyses. Our analyses do not support association between SLC 6 A 4 and BDI families. Further studies using sub-groups of BDI are worthwhile...|$|R
5000|$|In Linguistics, reporting, telling, {{and saying}} are {{recognised}} as verbal processes that project a wording (or locution). If a person says that [...] "Paul told x" [...] and [...] "Mary told y", this person stated {{only that the}} telling took place. In this case, the person who made these two statements did not represent a person inconsistently. In addition, if two people are talking to each other, let's say Paul and Mary, and Paul tells Mary [...] "John is five feet tall" [...] and Mary rejects Paul's statement by saying [...] "No, he is actually six feet tall", the socially constructed model of John does not become <b>inconsistent.</b> The <b>reason</b> for that is that statements are {{to be understood as}} an attempt to convince the addressee of something (Austin's How to do things with words), alternatively as a request to add some attribute to the model of Paul. The response to a statement can be an acknowledgement, in which case the model is changed, or it can be a statement rejection, in which case the model does not get changed. Finally, the example above for which John is said to be [...] "five feet tall" [...] or [...] "six feet tall" [...] is only incompatible because John can only be a single number of feet tall. If the attribute were a possession as in [...] "he has a dog" [...] or [...] "he also has a cat", a model inconsistency would not happen. In other words, the issue of model inconsistency has to do with our model of the domain element (John) and not with the ascription of different range elements (measurements such as [...] "five feet tall" [...] or [...] "six feet tall") nor with statements.|$|R
40|$|Several {{recent studies}} have {{employed}} a tacit precognition protocol to test the notion that extra-sensory perception may occur on a nonintentional basis, drawing inspiration from psi theories such as Stanford’s psi-mediated instrumental response (PMIR) model. After remarkable initial success, outcomes have subsequently become more <b>inconsistent.</b> One possible <b>reason</b> for the observed variability in results {{is that they were}} conducted by different experimenters. The current study therefore considered a number of dimensions regarding participants’ interaction with either a male or female experimenter. 52 participants took part in 12 nonintentional precognition trials and a positive or negative outcome task contingent on their performance. The total number of precognitive hits participants scored was marginally above the mean chance expectation but failed to reach statistical significance. There were significant positive correlations between participants’ precognition scores and their ratings of the positivity of their interaction with the experimenter, their rapport with the experimenter and their level of relaxation. There was also a notable difference between the two experimenters with respect to the relationships between their participant-experimenter interaction ratings and participants’ tacit precognition scores; all correlations were in the predicted direction for the female experimenter, but in the opposite direction for the male experimenter...|$|R
