40|$|Earlier {{short-term}} {{studies have}} shown productivity of intensively farmed common sole (S. solea) to be closely dependent on rearing density. Irrespective of fish size, elevating crowding conditions led to declining growth rates while the effect of density on mortality remains controversial. To what extent water temperature could affect productivity of growing sole subjected to varying crowding conditions, warrants investigation as very few studies have tried to quantify {{the effects of this}} fundamental rearing parameter on growth and survival in this fish species. This is particularly crucial for developing suitable farming protocols in Italy, where common sole may experience a broad range of water temperatures throughout the rearing cycle. The aim {{of this study was to}} evaluate productivity and blood cortisol level as a measure of stress response, in growing sole subjected to different stocking densities and temperature conditions. Six hundred juveniles (ind. weight 21. 8 ± 1. 5 g) were randomly allotted among eight groups kept in 0. 38 m 2 (0. 1 m 3) rectangular vessels, according to a factorial design combining two stocking densities (D, 150 vs 300 ind/m 2; i. e. 3. 3 vs 6. 5 kg/m 2) and two rearing temperature ranges (T, 18 - 20 vs 22 - 24 °C) with duplicate groups per treatment. Fish were fed over 148 days an extruded dry diet distributed at 1 % biomass/d in two meals. After 32 and 134 days on trial, blood samples were obtained after caudal puncture from five specimens per group. Plasma cortisol levels were analysed by EIA. Growth performance, survival, feed conversion rate (FCR) and productivity (biomass gain/m 2 /d) were calculated per group at the end of the trial. All response variables were subjected to a two-factor ANOVA. No significant interaction was found between main factors for the various response parameters. The different rearing temperature did not affect (p> 0. 05) growth performance (<b>final</b> <b>individual</b> <b>weight,</b> 59 ± 11 g, specific growth rate, 0. 67 ± 0. 11 %d - 1), survival (83. 5 ± 11 %), FCR (1. 6 ± 0. 2), productivity (35. 5 ± 5. 8 g/m 2 /d) or plasma cortisol levels (6. 6 ± 0. 5 ng/ml). Doubling the initial stocking density resulted in reduced growth (final weight, 49 vs 68. 5 g; specific growth rate, 0. 59 vs 0. 75, p < 0. 05), lower survival (76 vs 91. 3 %, p< 0. 05) and impaired FCR (1. 8 vs 1. 4, p< 0. 05). On the opposite, productivity was significantly improved at the higher density (39. 1 vs 31. 8 g/m 2 /d) while plasma cortisol levels were unaffected by crowding. The results here obtained confirm a density-dependent growth performance in sole which appears unrelated to rearing temperature. Plasma cortisol levels did not suggest rearing density or water temperature to be chronic stressors within the range of values here investigated. In this study, sole was shown to be able to adapt to a wide range of intensive culture conditions. This could provide clues on possible farming strategies aimed at promoting fast growth and/or high productivity by modulating stocking density...|$|E

No primeiro experimento, em delineamento estatístico fatorial inteiramente casualizado, estudaram-se os efeitos de duas densidades de estocagem (0, 5 e 0, 75 peixes/m²) e de dois períodos de cultivo subseqüentes (com cinco e quatro meses de duração, respectivamente). No segundo experimento, compararam-se duas densidades de estocagem(0, 5 e 0, 75 peixes/m²) em um período de cultivo equivalente ao somatório dos dois períodos de cultivo do primeiro experimento. No primeiro experimento, houve efeito estatístico significativo para períodos quanto ao ganho de peso {{individual}}, peso médio, biomassa final e ganho de biomassa. Foi observado efeito de densidade de estocagem quanto à biomassa final e ganho de biomassa, não havendo efeito interativo entre as duas variáveis estudadas. O peso individual final e ganho de peso no período de cinco meses de cultivo, com densidades de 0, 50 e 0, 75 peixes/m², foram de 608, 1 e 531, 4 g e 550, 2 e 473, 5 g, respectivamente, e no período subseqüente de quatro meses, de 274, 2 e 188, 3 e 211, 3 e 182, 3 g, respectivamente. Para biomassa final e ganho de biomassa, os valores observados no período inicial foram, respectivamente, de 298, 0 e 262, 1 e 397, 9 e 354, 5 g/m², e no período subseqüente, de 132, 9 e 89, 9 e 179, 9 e 119, 9 g/m², respectivamente. No segundo experimento, não houve efeito estatístico significativo para os parâmetros estudados; os valores de peso individual final, ganho de peso, biomassa final e ganho de biomassa foram, respectivamente, para as densidades de 0, 50 e 0, 75 peixes/m², 941, 1 e 758, 1; 885, 1 e 701, 2; 491, 7 e 587, 1; e 463, 1 e 535, 4 g/m². A sobrevivência média foi de 98 % e os parâmetros físico-químicos da água mantiveram-se dentro da normalidade. Concluiu-se ser viável a produção do Ictalurus punctatus nas condições climáticas em que foi conduzido o estudo. Two {{experiments were}} performed to study the effect of stocking rate and growing season {{on the performance of}} channel catfish (Ictalurus punctatus). In the first experiment, a completely randomized design in a factorial arrangement was used to study the effect of two stoking rates (0. 50 and 0. 75 fishes/m²) and two subsequently growing seasons (with five and four month of duration time, respectively). In the second experiment, two stoking rates were compared (0. 50 and 0. 75 fishes/m²) in a growing season equivalent to a sum of the two growing season of the first experiment. In the first experiment, there was a significant effect for growing seasons in relation to the individual weight gain, average weight, final biomass and biomass gain. The effect of stoking rate was only observed for final biomass and biomass gain, with non-interactive effect between the two studied factors. The <b>final</b> <b>individual</b> <b>weight</b> and weight gain in the growing season of five months with the stoking rate of 0. 50 and 0. 75 fishes/m 2 were 608. 1 and 531. 4 g; 550. 2 and 473. 5 g, respectively. In the subsequently growing season of four months were 274. 2 and 88. 3 g, 211. 3 and 183. 2 g, for the two stoking rates, respectively. At the initial growing season the final biomass and biomass gain values were, respectively, 298. 0 and 262. 1 g/m², 397. 9 and 354. 5 g/m², for the two stoking rates, respectively. In the subsequently growing season were 132. 9 and 89. 9 g/m² and 179. 9 and 119. 9 g/m², for the two stoking rates, respectively. In the second experiment, there was no effect for the studied characteristics and the values for the individual final weight, weight gain, final biomass and biomass gain were, respectively, for 0. 50 and 0. 75 fishes/m 2 socking rates, 941. 1 and 758. 1 g; 885. 1 and 701. 2 g; 491. 7 and 578. 1 g/m²; 463. 1 and 535. 4 g/m².

40|$|Traditionally, the {{aquaculture}} {{industry has}} utilized fish oil in aquafeeds {{as a source}} of energy and n- 3 long-chain polyunsaturated fatty acids (LC-PUFA). Use of fish oil has the added benefit of increasing the n- 3 LC-PUFA content of farmed fish, increasing its nutritional value to human consumers. Aquaculture continues to rely heavily on reduction fisheries and fish oil as the only economically viable source of n- 3 LC-PUFA, however this practice is arguably unsustainable. In order to meet growing demand for fish and its associated health benefits, aquafeed ingredients and feeding strategies that yield equivalent production performance and edible product fatty acid (FA) profile must be developed. My goal was to screen a range of plant oils as alternatives to fish oil in feeds for hybrid Striped Bass Morone chrysops x M. saxatilis (objective 1), and then assess the optimal alternative oil in the context of graded fish oil sparing and implementation of finishing as a strategy to augment fillet n- 3 LC-PUFA content prior to harvest. In objective 1, production performance and fillet FA profile were evaluated in juvenile hybrid Striped Bass (67. 8 ± 0. 2 g, mean ± SE) fed practical feeds (40 % protein, 15 % lipid) containing fish oil (FO) or 50 / 50 blends of fish oil and standard (STD SO), saturated fatty acid (SFA) -enriched (SFA SO), low alpha-linolenic acid (LO ALA SO), or monounsaturated fatty acid (MUFA) -enriched (MUFA SO) soy oil. Feeds were offered to quadruplicate tanks of fish (8 fish/tank, 67. 8 ± 0. 2 g) in a water reuse system for 12 weeks. Production performance was largely unaffected by dietary treatment. No significant differences were observed in weight gain (214 ± 5 %) or specific growth rate (1. 4 ± 0. 0 % body weight/day) among treatments. Some differences were observed in feed conversion ratio among SO-fed treatments; however, these treatments were not significantly different from the FO control (1. 2 ± 0. 0). Fillet fatty acid composition was generally observed to reflect dietary fatty acid composition and intake. The STD SO and LO ALA SO diets resulted in a significant decrease in LC-PUFA content and substantial increases in medium-chain polyunsaturated fatty acids (MC-PUFA) and n- 6 fatty acids within the fillet. Both the SFA SO and MUFA-SO diets resulted in fillet LC-PUFA levels similar to the FO diet; however, the MUFA-SO feed yielded significantly elevated levels of MUFA. Of the alternative oils evaluated, all would be acceptable as partial substitutes for fish oil in terms of production performance, though the SFA SO appeared to be the most suitable in terms of both production performance and maintaining a fatty acid profile similar to that associated with feeding fish oil. 	The goal of objective 2 was to further evaluate the SFA-enriched soy oil at graded levels of fish oil sparing in grow-out diets fed in conjunction with finishing with a fish oil-based feed for different durations prior to harvest. Quadruplicate tanks of fish (8 fish/tank, 110. 6 ± 0. 4 g) were fed experimental diets in which 50, 75, or 100 % of the dietary fish oil was replaced with SFA-enriched soy oil in conjunction with 4, 8, or 12 weeks of finishing with a 100 % fish oil feed (10 feeding regimens total) for 21 weeks. Significant differences in growth performance were found among the feeding regimens evaluated in this experiment. <b>Final</b> <b>individual</b> <b>weight</b> was significantly different between treatments with the 50 -SFA-SO + 8 weeks and 100 -SFA-SO + 12 weeks, but none of the treatments was significantly different from the 100 -FO control; when expressed in terms of percent weight gain, growth did not vary significantly among treatments. FCR varied significantly among feeding regimens, with the lower values generally associated with regimens receiving greater amounts of fish oil; more specifically, FCR values were significantly elevated among all three 100 -SFA compared to the 100 -FO control (1. 4 - 1. 5 vs. 1. 2). Furthermore, treatments providing the least amount of fish oil exhibited increased levels of MUFA, MC-PUFA and n- 6 FA. Finishing significantly affected fillet fatty acid profile, with longer finishing periods generally resulting in more comprehensive fillet modification, effectively reversing the deviations associated with feeding the SFA-enriched soy oil. My results indicate that fish oil can be replaced with SFA-SO at 50 % and 75 % with minimal effects on both growth performance and fillet FA. Although substantial amounts of fish oil may still be needed in concurrence with SFA-SO in order to provide ideal FA composition in fillets, any significant reduction in fish oil may be useful in further alleviating the oceans finite resources as well as decreasing production costs for the aquaculture industry...|$|E

40|$|Graduation date: 2000 Results of {{this study}} suggest that {{laboratory}} growth of full-sib families of five month old Pacific oyster spat can be predictive of growth to market size at different grow-out sites. Seven to ten millimeter spat were selected from each of fifteen full-sib families and commercially available polyploids. Each family was split into two groups and exposed to either variable salinity (V. S., 3 - 30 ppt) or constant salinity (C. S., 30 ppt) laboratory conditions for five months, then planted at either an upriver or downriver subtidal site in the Yaquina estuary, Oregon. After six months of growth in the estuary, the rankings of the families based on average <b>individual</b> <b>weights,</b> specific growth rates (SGR), survival and yields were compared between laboratory and estuary sites. There was a significant effect of family, laboratory treatment and site upon <b>final</b> <b>individual</b> live <b>weights</b> of oysters in the estuary (P= 0. 0001). The rankings of families based on average <b>individual</b> laboratory <b>weights</b> were correlated with average <b>individual</b> estuary <b>weights</b> at the downriver site (C.

S. tetraploids averaging 79. 4 g live weight by fifteen months of age. Laboratory family rankings based on SGRs were negatively correlated with estuary rankings of family SGRs for all treatments (P< 0. 0001, Rho=- 0. 668). Rankings of families based on laboratory yields on day 60 were correlated with standardized estuary yield rankings for all treatments, except V. S. oysters planted downriver. Laboratory yields of families were also found to be predictive of estuary yields at an intertidally planted site in Sequim Bay, Washington, indicating the potential for predicting yields across a wide range of sites and culture methods (subtidal vs. intertidal). Oyster breeding programs may realize more efficient progress from the results {{of this study}}.

BRD is a multifaceted group of pathogens, both viral and bacterial, that take advantage of an immune compromised calf to cause disease. This study took aim at comparing metaphylactic treatments for BRD in both the feedlot and pasture setting. In the feedlot study, heifers (n= 579, 403. 7 ± 27. 4 lbs) from Southwest Texas were identified as being high risk for BRD and shipped to the Clayton Livestock Research Center in Clayton, NM. Cattle were randomly allocated within truck load lots into 18 to 20 head treatment pens (30 pens; 3 treatments; 10 reps). Cattle were given one of three metaphylactic treatments based on the randomly assigned treatment for their pen within a replicate. The three antibiotic treatments administered at initial processing were: 1) Tulathromycin (2. 5 mg/kg), 2) Tilmicosin (13. 3 mg/kg), and 3) Gamithromycin (6. 0 mg/kg). Cattle were fed a typical commercial starter diet for the first 56 - 60 d with a step-up ration change at day 28. At the end of the feeding period, pens were weighed and body weights recorded. Dry Matter Intake, morbidity, and mortality were recorded by CLRC personnel daily. Cattle administered tulathromycin had higher daily gains than cattle administered gamithromycin by 0. 29 lbs/d (P<. 01) and tended (P= 0. 09) have higher daily gains than cattle that received tilmicosin by 0. 18 lbs/d. Tulathromycin treated cattle tended (P = 0. 12) to have improved feed efficiency compared to gamithromycin treated cattle. Cattle that received tulathromycin (5. 2 %) had lower morbidity rates (P <. 02) than tilmicosin (14. 6 %) and gamithromycin (12. 79 %) treated cattle. There were no treatment differences in dry matter intake or mortality in cattle. For the wheat pasture study, heifers (n= 120, 393. 2 ± 28. 6 lbs) from the same origin and risk were shipped to the CLRC and processed before being trailed to a nearby wheat pasture. Cattle were randomly assigned into three treatment groups (3 treatments, 40 reps), and were given one of three metaphylactic treatments. The three antibiotic treatments administered at initial processing were: 1) Tulathromycin (2. 5 mg/kg), 2) Tilmicosin (13. 3 mg/kg), and 3) Gamithromycin (6. 0 mg/kg).

40|$|Within a {{population}} of pigs, variation in performance and nutritional requirements can be important. Nutritionists elaborate feeding strategies that maximize economic return at the batch scale while (in some countries) accounting for N and P excretion. To evaluate the effect of feeding strategy and feed price on performance, its variability, economic return and environmental impact, a simulation study was carried out using both a virtual population of 2, 000 gilts and barrows and the InraPorc® growth model. The 2, 000 virtual animal profiles were generated randomly from the average of five parameters that describe growth and feed intake, while using the covariance structure of parameters obtained in a preliminary study. The effects of factors such as feed restriction, number of diets used and amino acids level in each diet were simulated with diets formulated using the least-cost principle. Five different contexts of feedstuff prices, corresponding to average prices recorded for five harvesting campaigns (2005 / 06 to 2009 / 10) were used. Calculations were performed for the 2, 000 individual animals to obtain performance at the average final BW of 115 kg for the group. With reference to the French payment grid, carcass value was calculated using the <b>final</b> <b>individual</b> carcass <b>weights</b> and lean meat contents. Economic return was calculated as the difference between carcass value {{and the costs of}} feed and labor. Results suggest that the variability of final BW was reduced with an increased supply of amino acids. Feed restriction had a greater impact on variability.

One hundred eight fish (mean body weight 204 ? 12. 7 g) were randomly divided among 9 groups kept in a marine recirculating tank system ensuring nearly optimal water condition to sea bass (temperature 21 ?C, salinity 28 ?). Fish were fed the test diets to visual satiety over 15 weeks according to a randomized design with 3 replicates per dietary treatment. At the end of the trial, final biomass, specific growth rate (SGR) and feed conversion ratio (FCR) were calculated per group and 6 fish per dietary treatment were sacrificed and immediately subjected to blood and intestine sampling for further analysis of plasma metabolite levels (glucose, cholesterol, triglyceride, total proteins and albumin levels) and activity of mucosal brush border enzymes in different sections. No diet-induced effects were noted in the <b>final</b> <b>individual</b> live <b>weight,</b> 420 ? 14. 5 g, SGR, 0. 68 ? 0. 003 and FCR, 1. 7 ? 0. 11. Amongst plasma metabolites, only cholesterol and total proteins were affected by dietary treatments resulting in reduced levels only in fish given the diet highest in microalgae relative to controls (347. 2 vs. 276. 6 mg/dL and 5. 90 vs. 5. 37 mg/dl; respectively, P< 0. 05). The activity of the intestinal mucosal enzymes varied according to the different intestinal tracts but did not show major diet-dependent changes. This study suggests that a blend of dried marine microalgae biomass could further reduce reliance on fish meal and fish oil in practical diets for adult sea bass without adversely affecting growth response and digestive-absorptive functions...|$|R
