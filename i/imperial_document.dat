2500|$|After Emperor Wenxuan died in 559 and was {{succeeded by}} his son Emperor Fei, Zu was {{recalled}} to the government {{to serve as a}} commandery governor—but he never actually took office, as Yang Yin, who commissioned him to that office, was killed in a coup. Instead, he again became an <b>imperial</b> <b>document</b> drafter. [...] After Emperor Fei was deposed in 560 and replaced by his uncle Emperor Xiaozhao, Zu drew the new emperor's ire by submitting secret petitions excessively; Emperor Xiaozhao ordered his secretaries to refuse further submissions by Zu, but did not appear to remove him from his office.|$|E

50|$|Bligger II (1152-1210) was a poet of the Minnesang and fief lord of Steinach. He {{was also}} a {{companion}} to two Staufer and contemporary of the Minnesinger Gottfried von Strassburg. Bligger's poems mention Damascus and Saladin and Bligger's homesickness, which some scholars take as an indication that Bligger either accompanied his father and uncle to Constantinople in 1171 or Bligger went on a crusade with Frederick I. Bligger was certainly a trustworthy companion to Henry IV and not just an entertainer. Bligger's signature appears on four <b>imperial</b> <b>documents</b> from 1193 to 1196 as Blikerus de Steinaha. A report of a Pentecostal festival from 1194 in Milano, in which the emperor Henry VI, Conrad II, Duke of Swabia, Philip of Swabia, Henry V, Count Palatine of the Rhine, and Bligger von Steinach. Bligger was also present when Henry VI was crowned king of Sicily in Palermo 1194. Two further <b>imperial</b> <b>documents</b> refer to the name Blikerus from the Toscana in 1194, but historians dispute whether this refers to Bligger II or his son Bligger III. Bligger appears from 1152 to 1208 in numerous documents of Schönau Abbey, Lorch Abbey, Eberbach Abbey, and in <b>imperial</b> <b>documents.</b>|$|R
50|$|Pomerania {{was first}} {{mentioned}} in an <b>imperial</b> <b>document</b> of 1046, {{referring to a}} Zemuzil dux Bomeranorum (Zemuzil, Duke of the Pomeranians). Pomerania is mentioned repeatedly in the chronicles of Adam of Bremen (c. 1070) and Gallus Anonymous (ca. 1113).|$|E
50|$|The place {{known as}} Linn was first {{mentioned}} in an <b>Imperial</b> <b>document</b> composed between 1090 and 1120. By {{the beginning of}} the fourteenth century, Linn must have been raised to the status of a city, as in another document in 1314, city jurors were named.|$|E
5000|$|The {{communal}} land of Flein {{already was}} settled during the linear pottery {{culture of the}} neolithic. The village was first mentioned in 1188 within an <b>imperial</b> <b>document</b> as Flina.

50|$|The {{limits and}} {{specifics}} of a pronoia {{was recorded in}} an <b>Imperial</b> <b>document</b> called praktika ("records"); holders of pronoia (the grantees, in other words) were called pronoiarios, and those working the income stream in question (for instance, farmers on the land) were called paroikoi in the documents. The word pronoia could refer to the grant itself (land, for instance), its monetary value, or the income it produced.|$|E
50|$|A sigillion (Greek σιγίλλιον), plural sigillia, was a type {{of legal}} {{document}} publicly affirmed with a seal, usually of lead. It originated in the Byzantine Empire in the ninth century, and is first attested at the imperial chancery in 883. It was subsequently used by lower-level public officials, including tax collectors and judges, {{as well as by}} provincial governors. It is distinct from an <b>imperial</b> <b>document</b> bearing a golden seal, a chrysobull (chrysoboullon sigillion).|$|E
50|$|During the 12th {{century the}} {{settlement}} {{and its surrounding}} area, including the Sulm valley to the west, became territories of the Archbishopric of Salzburg and remained so for more than 400 years. The relocation of the civilian settlement was initiated (or at least heavily supported) by Archbishop Konradin of Salzburg, probably by 1130. In March 1170, Emperor Barbarossa discussed matters associated with Salzburg’s authority in Leibnitz, and an <b>imperial</b> <b>document</b> dated 14 June 1178 granted full jurisdiction to Salzburg.|$|E

5000|$|The {{island was}} {{controlled}} by the Ottoman Empire for many years, but it enjoyed certain privileges, mostly related to tax-free trade by the monastery as certified by Ottoman <b>imperial</b> <b>documents</b> held in the Library.. Ottoman rule in Patmos ("Batnaz" [...] in Ottoman Turkish) was interrupted by initially Venetian occupation during Candian War between 1659 and 1669, then Russian occupation during Orlov Revolt between 1770 and 1774 and finally during Greek War of Independence.|$|R
50|$|Allied to {{his close}} {{relations}} the Counts of Oldenburg and the Duke of Gelderland/Gelre, Balthasar Oomkens von Esens resisted the doubtful political power-grabbing attempted by the Cirksenas (which included a forged <b>imperial</b> <b>document</b> {{relating to the}} lordship of Harlingerland) and also championed {{the interests of the}} Catholic Church against the Reformation-minded allies of the Cirksenas. As a result of his resistance, Harlingerland remained a free county under its own jurisdiction until it came through inheritance to Frederick the Great in 1744.|$|E
50|$|The town of Polygyros {{is first}} {{mentioned}} in a medieval <b>imperial</b> <b>document,</b> chryssovoulon (with golden stamp), of Eastern Roman Emperor Nikephoros III Botaneiates about 1080 CE.

On 17 May 1821 the people of Polygyros rose against the Ottoman authority and managed, temporarily, to expel the Ottoman guard. Many residents of Polygyros took part in the 1854's unsuccessful revolutionary movement against the Ottomans.|$|E

50|$|Böhmer's {{historical}} {{work was}} chiefly concerned with collecting and tabulating charters and other <b>imperial</b> <b>documents</b> of the Middle Ages. First appeared an abstract, the Regesta chronologico-diplomatica regum atque imperatorum Romanorum 911-1313 (Frankfurt, 1831), which {{was followed by}} the Regesta chronologico-diplomatica Karolorum. Die Urkunden sämtlicher Karolinger in kurzen Auszügen (Frankfurt, 1833), and a series of Regesta imperii. For the period 1314-1347 (Frankfurt, 1839) the Regesta was followed by three, and for the period 1246-1313 (Frankfurt, 1844) by two supplementary volumes. The remaining period of the Regesta, as edited by Böhmer, is 1198-1254 (Stuttgart, 1849). These collections contain introductions and explanatory passages by the author.|$|R
40|$|Two <b>imperial</b> <b>documents</b> in Greek dated in {{the years}} 475 - 476, the Encyclion and the Antiencyclion by Basilisk (Zeno usurper), have not been {{translated}} and carefully analyzed to assess the content relatively to the Orthodox Creed, but rather to verify their nature as acts of legislation. Their text is presented in a form very ambiguous perhaps {{because they have not}} been compilated by officia scholars who were the only experts in law matter; this difficulty of identification was also met by the immediately following legislator since, in 477 A. D., he repealed both documents with the law in CI. 1, 2, 16...|$|R
50|$|On 27 January 1642 Johann Bertram Weschpfennig von Scheidt (as he {{is called}} on the <b>imperial</b> <b>documents</b> in Vienna) was {{elevated}} to the noble rank of baron of the Empire (original title; rechsfreiherr) by Emperor Ferdinand the 3rd in Vienna. That title is hereditary. In 1632 he is the Bergi marshal, 'Kammerherr' and 'Amtmann' to Ángermund and Landsberg. As envoy of duke Wolfgang von Jülich-Berg, Johann Bertram baron von Scheidt genannt Weschpfennig was sent into the enemy lines to convince Swedish general Baudissin that the duke of Jülich-Berg remained neutral in the religious wars at that time (catholic vs reformed).|$|R

5000|$|Eusebius's known {{sources for}} {{painting}} a textual portrait of Constantine and his rule come from eight legal texts, forty-six biblical references, and eight literary references. [...] Eusebius often referenced his own former works, forty-one times in Life of Constantine, most notably Ecclesiastical History (Historia Ecclesiastica) and the Tricennalian Oration (Laus Constantini). The Ecclessiastical History itself has many <b>imperial</b> <b>documents</b> and letters from Constantine, some repeating their appearance in Life of Constantine. Eusebius often quotes verbatim both {{his own work}} and the imperial documents; however, he also quotes without citing, often to help build his narrative of Constantine as a god-sent emperor.|$|R

40|$|The {{political}} project {{pursued by}} the emperor Henry VII to achieve the reconciliation and the reaffirmation of imperial sovereignty during his Italian expedition (1310 - 1313), could not be carried out apart from the decisive role of a small but influential group of employees trained in a typically Italian political culture. They are on one hand the notaries who oversee the writing of <b>imperial</b> <b>documents,</b> {{and on the other}} hand the heterogeneous group of vicars to whom the emperor entrusted the government of the city. The contributions collected here deepen various aspects concerning this political group, and show the ephemeral successes and failures of the Emperor's politics...|$|R
