5|$|The {{road was}} {{originally}} a Roman road, {{part of the}} Via Trinobantina between Essex and Hampshire via London. It was known as Tyburn Road through the Middle Ages and was once notorious as a street where prisoners from Newgate Prison would be transported towards a public hanging. It became known as Oxford Road and then Oxford Street in the 18th century, and began to change character from a residential street to commercial and retail purposes by the late 19th century, also attracting street traders, confidence tricksters and prostitution. The first department stores in Britain opened on Oxford Street in the early 20th century, including Selfridges, <b>John</b> <b>Lewis</b> and HMV. Unlike nearby shopping streets such as Bond Street, it has retained an element of downmarket street trading alongside more prestigious retail stores. The street suffered heavy bombing during World War II, and several longstanding stores including <b>John</b> <b>Lewis</b> were completely destroyed and rebuilt from scratch.|$|E

5|$|Historian Wilson D. Miscamble {{argues that}} Kennan played a {{critical}} role in developing the foreign policies of the Truman administration.

Like historian <b>John</b> <b>Lewis</b> Gaddis, Miscamble concedes that although Kennan personally preferred political containment, his recommendations ultimately resulted in a policy directed more toward strongpoint than to global containment.|$|E
