40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study has been to compare how fiber {{reinforced}} concretes, using different amounts and types of fiber, behave compared to standard offshore concretes without fiber in regard to <b>ice</b> <b>abrasion.</b> The effect of fiber addition on the freeze-thaw resistance has also been studied. Due to various observations during testing, a large part of this study has gradually come to deal with the accuracy and the reliability of the measurement equipment and methods used during these <b>ice</b> <b>abrasion</b> tests. A literature review has been done on the effect of various parameters on the <b>ice</b> <b>abrasion</b> of concrete. Previous studies have shown the beneficial effect of the use of fiber reinforcement on both the abrasion resistance and freeze-thaw resistance of concrete. Studies have also shown that a decreased abrasion rate can be expected with an increase in flexural and compressive strength, and that the surface topography has an effect on the abrasion rate. Few studies, though, have specifically looked into the <b>ice</b> <b>abrasion</b> resistance of fiber reinforced concrete. <b>Ice</b> <b>abrasion</b> tests have been performed at the NTNU <b>ice</b> <b>abrasion</b> laboratory on five different concrete mixes. These mixes include a B 70 reference concrete and concretes with the following fiber additions: 0. 5 % steel fiber, 1. 5 % steel fiber, 1. 5 % polypropylene fiber and 1. 5 % basalt fiber. Freeze-thaw testing, according to ASTM C 666 Procedure A, and air void analysis using fresh concrete, the PF-test and image analysis, have also been performed on the different concrete mixes. It has been observed that all of the fiber additions, except for the 1. 5 % steel addition, have improved the <b>ice</b> <b>abrasion</b> resistance of the concrete. The ranking of these different fiber concretes in regard to their <b>ice</b> <b>abrasion</b> resistance {{has been found to be}} difficult, due to the fact that the abrasion rates are all lower than the average deviation of the measurements. Therefore, the mixes showing a better <b>ice</b> <b>abrasion</b> resistance than the others may just as well be due to the inaccuracy of the measurements than to the actual <b>ice</b> <b>abrasion</b> resistant properties of the material. However, the abrasion rates observed in this study are generally very low. The maximum abrasion rate found is 0. 011 mm/km, and the abrasion rates here are on average 11 times lower than the rates found in similar tests done by (Kirkhaug 2013). Correlations showing the positive effect on <b>ice</b> <b>abrasion</b> resistance with increasing Surface Average Roughness and Root Mean Square Roughness parameters have also been observed. All concrete mixes failed the freeze-thaw testing requirements and the addition of fiber reinforcement has not given the expected improvement in freeze-thaw durability. Through air void analysis, it has been shown that the reason for this low concrete quality, in regard to freeze-thaw resistance, has been due to a poor air void content and structure in all of the mixes. The accuracy of both the abrasion and roughness values has been questioned, and the average deviation of the measurements has been found to be large compared to the abrasion rates. This is due to, among other factors, the large distances between measuring points, systematical irregularities on the specimen surfaces, and an inaccuracy in the measuring equipment and procedures used. This doubt on the reliability of these results has been backed up by the poor correlation found between abrasion rates on specimens of the same product type and tested under the same conditions. A more thorough discussion is recommended on the accuracy and reliability of the measuring equipment and procedures at the NTNU <b>ice</b> <b>abrasion</b> laboratory when testing materials with very low <b>ice</b> <b>abrasion,</b> such as those tested here.

The objectives of this paper were to study the effect of footwear sole abrasive wear on slip resistance on ice with respect to temperature, and to compare the slip resistance of abraded soles on melting and hard ice with that on lubricated steel plate. The kinetic coefficient of friction (COF) of nine pairs of footwear were measured with the stationary step simulator developed at the Finnish Institute of Occupational Health, {{before and after the}} new footwear soles were artificially abraded. Two-way factorial ANOVA showed that the abrasion of nine pairs of footwear had no significant effect on COF on melting ice (Mean COF with abrasion= 0. 056, std= 0. 0158, COF without abrasion= 0. 055, std= 0. 0205, P= 0. 805). On hard ice, however, the COF of abraded soles measured (mean COF= 0. 244) was significantly higher than without abrasion (mean COF= 0. 180, p< 0. 001), and than abraded soles on lubricated steel (mean= 0. 137, p< 0. 001). There is statistical significance between the three types of surfaces (p< 0. 001). On hard <b>ice,</b> regardless of <b>abrasion,</b> curling footwear with crepe rubber soling showed significantly higher COF (mean= 0. 343 after abrasion, 0. 261 before abrasion) than other types (p< 0. 001). The results indicate that artificially abraded footwear is more slip resistant than new one for use on hard <b>ice.</b> The <b>abrasion</b> requirement could be specified if developing a new standard to measure COF on ice in the future. Of the footwear measured, the curling footwear with crepe rubber soling performed best in terms of slip resistance property. Therefore, Crepe rubber soling is highly recommended for use on hard ice. Melting ice is much more slippery, in which sole abrasion does not improve slip resistance. Thus, additional measures should be taken to reduce slip and fall risk...|$|R

A total of four concretes sample were tested. All four of them were saturated after this saturation period 2 of them was abrasion tested directly and 2 of them were dried, resaturated and then abrasion tested. Abrasion results were distorted by cracking of the concrete samples. No conclusive data on the abrasion rate were obtained. Two possible reasons for cracking of the concrete samples were found.

Testing equipment and procedures are described for <b>ice</b> <b>abrasion</b> and bond strength tests. Test conditions were chosen to evaluate the influence of sliding distance, contact pressure, sliding velocity and initial surface roughness on the abrasion rate. Seven different products; Densit, Reforcetech, Rockbond, B 60 concrete, B 70 concrete, MapeCoat (elastic epoxy) and Polyurethane (rigid epoxy) are <b>ice</b> <b>abrasion</b> tested. MapeCoat and Polyurethane showed no visible signs of abrasion, while all repair mortars were found to have significantly higher abrasion resistance than the standard B 60 reference concrete.

A bergschrund forms when the movement of the glacier separates the moving ice from the stationary ice forming a crevasse. The method of erosion of the headwall lying between the surface of the glacier and the cirque’s floor has been attributed to freeze-thaw mechanisms. The temperature within the bergschrund changes very little, however, studies have shown that ice segregation (frost shattering) may happen with only small changes in temperature. Water that flows into the bergschrund can be cooled to freezing temperatures by the surrounding ice allowing freeze-thaw mechanisms to occur.|$|R
5000|$|A fjord {{is formed}} when a glacier cuts a U-shaped valley by <b>ice</b> {{segregation}} and <b>abrasion</b> {{of the surrounding}} bedrock. Glacial melting is accompanied by the rebounding of Earth's crust as the ice load and eroded sediment is removed (also called isostasy or glacial rebound). In some cases this rebound is faster than sea level rise. Most fjords are deeper than the adjacent sea; Sognefjord, Norway, reaches as much as 1300 m below sea level. Fjords generally have a sill or shoal (bedrock) at their mouth caused by the previous glacier's reduced erosion rate and terminal moraine. In many cases this sill causes extreme currents and large saltwater rapids (see skookumchuck). Saltstraumen in Norway {{is often described as}} the world's strongest tidal current. These characteristics distinguish fjords from rias (e.g. the Bay of Kotor), which are drowned valleys flooded by the rising sea.

40|$|A {{significant}} amount of the world’s undiscovered oil- and gas resources are located North of the Arctic Circle. In the light of this, there is currently an increasing interest in developing necessary infrastructure to support sustainable development of these resources. Also increased availability to the Arctic due to reduced amounts of ice {{for longer periods of}} the year will ease the access for ship transport and increase the seasonal window for construction activities in these areas. Towards {{the end of the last}} millennium, the exploration of oil and gas in the North Sea was the main driving force behind development in concrete technology for use in large offshore concrete structures. Knowledge and expertise derived from this period has benefited in other sectors of the concrete industry as well, such as costal bridges and quay structures where durability is important. Going forward, the ability of concrete structures to withstand exposure from sea ice and low temperatures is decisive and calls for increased knowledge and new technology. <b>Ice</b> <b>abrasion</b> is a severe degradation mechanism responsible for reduced service life in marine concrete structures exposed to sea ice. The phenomenon is caused by ice-concrete friction forces and results in gradual loss of concrete cover. In extreme cases, <b>ice</b> <b>abrasion</b> has brought about complete deterioration of the reinforcement cover of marine concrete structures, which represents a potential threat regarding the safety against load-carrying failure. Current regulations with regard to material selection and design of concrete structures exposed to <b>ice</b> <b>abrasion</b> are defined in ISO 19903 : 2006 and ISO 19906 : 2010, where most of the regulations are given as functional descriptions. The interpretation of the regulations is therefore mainly based on considerations without sufficient documentation, which calls for reliable and research-based estimation methods. As a first approach, an investigation was performed in order to develop equations for rough estimation of expected abrasion rates based on the experimental results in the current study. The equations were derived on the basis of a regression analyses where the measured <b>ice</b> <b>abrasion</b> rates from the experiments were taken as the response parameter and the three explanatory variables in the experiments; compressive strength, ice pressure and ice temperature, as predictors. Based on simplified assumptions, a direct application of the equations provided fairly good approximations of maximum abrasion depths when benchmarked against a marine concrete structure with known abrasion depths. The best prediction was achieved for the parts of the structure with orientation parallel to the dominating ice drift directions. For the faces with lower ice exposure, the equations underpredicted the associated abrasion depths significantly. The ice-concrete coefficient of friction is reported to increase with decreasing drift speed and cause higher abrasion rates. As our equations did not include the speed of ice as predictor, they were not able to account for this effect. The distribution of <b>ice</b> <b>abrasion</b> on structures is highly dependent on the direction of the ice drift. In previous field studies dealing with concrete abrasion due to ice drift, reliable information about site specific ice conditions is sparse. On this basis, results from in-situ measurements of three severely damaged concrete lighthouses due to long term sea ice exposure are presented and discussed. As one of the inspected lighthouses showed particular severe damage, this structure formed the main basis of the investigation. The focus was on local ice conditions with main emphasise on the amount of ice drift per direction and its influence on distribution of abrasion depths along the perimeter of the lighthouse. The investigation revealed that the largest abrasion depths were observed on the faces oriented parallel with the dominating ice drift direction(s). Further, the rate of abrasion increased significantly with decreasing annual ice drift. This trend was most pronounced for the faces with the lowest ice exposure. The investigation revealed that abrasion depths on faces oriented diametrically opposite to each other increased linearly with the amount of ice drift along these faces. In previous experimental- and field investigations, <b>ice</b> <b>abrasion</b> rates were traditionally reported as average values, often without quantification of the uncertainty in the results. In order to allow a probabilistic approach in the results analysis, an appropriate probability distribution function to represent abrasion rates is needed. Based on our experimental results we performed goodness of fit tests and found that the abrasion rates were well represented by a 3 -parameter Weibull distribution. The distribution was statistically significant based on a confidence level of 95...|$|E
40|$|An {{increasing}} number of activities are moved into Arctic regions. As oil and gas companies are exploring the options in these regions, structures are required which can withstand the severe environmental conditions. Existing structures are subjected to heavy mechanical loads due to moving ice sheets. For concrete structures in particular <b>ice</b> <b>abrasion</b> damage has been observed on the surfaces. In extreme cases, <b>ice</b> <b>abrasion</b> has caused deterioration of the entire concrete cover on offshore structures. Most research on concrete-ice abrasion is quite empirical. Little {{is known about the}} material science of concrete-ice abrasion. As the theoretical frameworks supporting the concrete-ice abrasion process are quite limited, {{it is very difficult to}} predict service life deterioration of concrete structures and to define measures against <b>ice</b> <b>abrasion</b> damage. A numerical model in which the onset of wear in the concrete-ice abrasion process is simulated, is defined in order to increase the understanding of the mechanics of the abrasion process and to define measures against <b>ice</b> <b>abrasion</b> damage. Onset of wear is de?ned as the crack initiation and propagation in the concrete material due to ice loading. Hertz contact theory which predicts excessive tensile stresses on the concrete surface due to sliding of ice asperities is used as an analytical basis for the numerical model. In order to define an appropriate numerical model for the simulation of cracking in concrete, several modelling approaches can be employed. The simulations are performed on meso-scale, which means that concrete is modelled as a three-phase material in which paste, aggregates and the interface transition zone are distinguished. This is one of the main reasons to use a lattice model for the concrete. Contact between concrete and ice is decoupled. Decoupling of the two materials is justified as long as the materials exhibit linear elastic behaviour in the contact area. On meso-scale, ice crystals fail in a brittle compressive way under the loading conditions employed in this report. This means that decoupling is justified. The loads exerted on the concrete surface by the ice crystal follow from Hertz theory and are applied externally on the concrete surface. Two numerical models are defined, namely a model with a smooth concrete surface and a model with a rough concrete surface. A rough surface profile is generated in a simplified manner by using roughness parameters found in experiments performed in the NTNU lab. Even though the rough model does not have a flat surface, the assumptions made in Hertz theory with respect to the loads in the contact area are still valid. Roughness parameters found in the experiments are quite large compared to the dimensions of the contact. Several numerical simulations are performed on the smooth model. The difference between normal and sliding contact is simulated on a homogenous concrete to make validation possible with analytical solutions proposed by Hertz. Sliding contact is applied on both a homogeneous and a heterogenous concrete to see whether this influences the results. The influence of the coefficient of friction on the onset of wear in the concrete surface is discussed by simulating sliding contact for increasing coefficients of friction. The influence of the concrete compressive strength on the initiation of damage is also simulated by using different concrete qualities. The influence of surface roughness on the onset of wear is simulated by applying sliding contact on various concrete surface profiles. Four different surface profiles have been generated and their response to the sliding ice loads is compared to the response of a smooth concrete surface. It can be concluded that a numerical model which simulates sliding contact between ice and concrete on meso-scale can be used to simulate the onset of wear during the concrete-ice abrasion process. Such model is able to capture both surface and subsurface cracking in the concrete. However, simulations show that (sliding) contact between concrete and ice is not purely a Hertzian thing. The locations at which the cracks initiate on the surface do not coincide with the location of maximum tensile stresses predicted by Hertz theory. This might be due to the loss of accuracy in decoupling the contact between concrete and ice. Nodal equivalent forces in the contact area deviate from the exact contact pressure. Also, the size of the contact area is not updated in each load step during the sequence of linear analyses. It is recommended that coupled contact is implemented in future research to increase accuracy of the results. Simulations have shown that high concrete compressive strength increase resistance against cracking due to sliding contact between ice and concrete. Also, reducing friction between these two materials and keeping the surface roughness to a minimum, increase the resistance against the onset of wear in the <b>ice</b> <b>abrasion</b> process.

Progress in Physical Geography 28, 1, pp. 43 ? 75 Glacial inversion modelling of continental-scale palaeo-ice sheets is now {{recognized as an}} important tool in palaeoglaciology. Existing palaeoglaciological reconstructions of the dimensions, geometry and dynamics of former ice sheets are based mainly on glacial depositional, as opposed to glacial erosional, landforms. Part {{of the reason for}} this is a lack of detailed understanding of the origin and significance of glacial erosional landforms. Here we review recent developments in our understanding of the processes and landforms of glacial erosion and consider their value in palaeoglaciology. Glacial erosion involves the removal and transport of bedrock and/or sediment by glacial quarrying, glacial abrasion and glacial meltwater. These processes combine to create a suite of landforms that are frequently observed in areas formerly occupied by ice sheets and glaciers, and which can be used in palaeoglaciological reconstructions. For example, all landforms of glacial erosion provide evidence for the release of subglacial meltwater and the existence of warm-based ice. Landforms of glacial quarrying such as roches moutonn?es, rock basins and zones of areal scouring are created when cavities form between an ice sheet and its bed and therefore are indicative of low effective basal pressures (0. 1 ? 1 MPa) and high sliding velocities that are necessary for ice?bed separation. Fluctuations in basal water pressure also play an important role in the formation of glacially quarried landforms. Landforms of glacial abrasion include streamlined bedrock features (?whalebacks?), some ?p-forms?, striae, grooves, micro-crag and tails, bedrock gouges and cracks. Abrasion can be achieved by bodies of subglacial sediment sliding over bedrock or by individual clasts contained within <b>ice.</b> Although <b>abrasion</b> models depend critically on whether clasts are treated as dependent or independent of subglacial water pressure, it appears that abrasion is favoured in situations where effective basal pressures are greater than 1 MPa and where there are low sliding velocities. Consequently, landforms dominated by glacial abrasion are created when there is no ice?bed separation. Landforms of glacial meltwater erosion include both subglacial and ice-marginal meltwater channels. Investigations of the relationship between glacial meltwater channels and other aspects of the subglacial drainage system, such as areas of ice?bed contact, areas of ice?bed separation and precipitate-filled depressions, enable inferences to be made concerning former subglacial water pressure-drainage relationships, effective pressures and glacier velocities. Meltwater palaeovelocity and palaeodischarge can also be calculated from measurements of channel shape, channel width and the size of material transported within former glacial meltwater channels. We surmize that glacial erosional landforms offer insight into former glaciological conditions at both the landform- and landscape-scale within palaeoglaciology. Exposureage dating techniques, including cosmogenic isotope dating of bedrock surfaces, will be important in increasing our understanding of the age and chronological significance of landforms of glacial erosion. We conclude that landforms of glacial erosion are of great value in ice mass reconstruction and speculate that these landforms will achieve greater recognition within palaeoglaciology in line with improvements in exposure-age dating techniques.

40|$|ABSTRACT. The {{discovery}} of the “Boulder Patch”, an area of cobbles and boulders with attached kelp and invertebrate life, is reported from Stefansson Sound, near Prudhoe Bay, Alaska. Geophysical surveys using side-scan sonar and low-frequency recording fathometers reveal that cobbles and boulders occur in patches of various sizes and densities. Despite a seasonal influx of sediments, the Boulder Patch is a nondepositional environment. Physical disruption of cobbles and boulders by deep draft ice is minimal due to offshore islands and shoals which restrict the passage of large ice floes into Stefansson Sound. The apparent absence of similar concentrations of rocks with attached biota along the Alaskan Beaufort Sea coast is explained by the scarcity of rocks in areas protected from <b>ice</b> <b>abrasion</b> and with no net sediment deposition. In Stefansson Sound, the rocks provide a substratum for a diverse assortment of invertebrates and several species of algae. Recolonization by the biota was minimal on twelve boulders denuded and then left undisturbed for a three-year period. Sedimentation and grazing activity {{appear to be the}} major factors inhibiting recolonization. Linear growth in the kelp, Laminaria solidungula, is greatest in winter and early spring when nutrients are available for new tissue growth. The plant draws on stored food reserves to complete over 90 % of its annual linear growth during the nine months of darkness under a turbid ice canopy. These reserves are accumulated by photosynthetic activity during the preceding summer. The total carbon contribution made by kelp in Stefansson Sound under these conditions is about 146 x lo 6 gyr ” or 7 g. m- 2. yr”. A small percentage of this carbon is consumed directly by herbivores, but its importance to other organisms is not known and is under investigation...|$|E
40|$|Owing to {{the winter}} {{conditions}} in Sweden, {{the effects of}} frost action may have a considerable impact on the deterioration of concrete. Both superficial and internal damage, which are suspected to {{have been caused by}} frost action, have been found in concrete in hydraulic structures. These observations have raised questions about the long-term behaviour of hydraulic structures in cold regions. Superficial damage, similar in appearance to salt scaling of concrete, can be seen at the waterline of hydraulic structures, such as hydro power structures. Progressive damage to the concrete surface results in exposure of coarse aggregate and also exposed reinforcing steel in the long-term perspective. A possible deterioration process of concrete at the waterline is leaching of the concrete surface, which takes place during the snowmelt runoff period. The concrete surface is thus more susceptible to frost action. During the following winter, the surface layer is damaged by frost action and later removed due to <b>ice</b> <b>abrasion.</b> During the next snowmelt runoff period, the process starts all over again. Experimental results obtained in this work confirm this deterioration process. Spalling of concrete has been observed below the water level in water retaining concrete structures subjected to long periods of freezing temperatures in winter. The hypothesis is that either poor quality concrete or the effects of aging make hardened concrete susceptible to macroscopic ice lens growth, i. e. ice segregation. Given constant thermal conditions, ice segregation occurs in undamaged concrete with water to cement-ratio (w/c-ratio) 0. 9 or higher. In frost-damaged concrete, ice segregation occurs within a few days regardless of the w/c-ratio. Ice segregation may also occur in concrete with cavities or imperfections. The period of freezing required to facilitate ice segregation increases with decreasing w/c-ratio. Hence, the risk of concrete spalling in actual structures cannot be overlooked since unfavourable temperature and moisture conditions may exist in winter. Knowledge about concrete deterioration is important in order to improve the efficiency of maintenance of hydraulic structures. However, the overall purpose of gathering knowledge about damage mechanisms is to secure {{and to be able to}} safely extend the service life of hydraulic structures...|$|E
