40|$|This paper {{analyzes}} the institutional framework that has historically governed the cost-benefit analysis (CBA) of <b>financial</b> <b>regulation.</b> Although U.

The existence of these distinct paradigms highlights that a formal CBA requirement need not lead to regulatory paralysis, but the uneven application of CBA they engender provides {{reason to believe that}} this institutional framework is far from ideal. To the extent that the goal of CBA is to provide meaningful, transparent analysis of rule making while avoiding regulatory paralysis, the paper argues in favor of moving toward a more uniform institutional <b>framework</b> for <b>financial</b> <b>regulation.</b> In particular, adopting a single CBA paradigm that requires interagency coordination but avoids judicial review provides the greatest promise for achieving this goal in <b>financial</b> <b>regulation...</b>|$|R

40|$|Abstract: Within {{the context}} of the Global Crisis, this paper {{examines}} the ongoing policy challenges in establishing a European <b>framework</b> for <b>financial</b> <b>regulation</b> and supervision. We do so taking into account the evidence provided during the crisis of pervasive spillover effects and cross-country interdependence. The paper applies the language and analyses of gametheoretic models as tools to think rigorously about the cross-country aspects of European financial integration over time. Specifically, the paper applies the economic theory of alliances of Olson and Zechauser (1966) and the private provision of public goods of Bergstrom, Blume and Varian (1986). We contrast the Nash equilibrium outcome with the Coase equilibrium that obtains under zero transaction costs. We follow Coase in taking the zero transaction costs benchmark as a starting point to discuss what factors favor cooperation in specific circumstances. We offer some reflections on the on-going process of institutional change in <b>financial</b> <b>regulation</b> and supervision in Europe...|$|R

40|$|May 26, 2010 The {{financial}} crisis that began {{nearly three years}} ago has caused great hardship for people {{in many parts of}} the world and represented the most profound challenge to central banks since the Great Depression. Faced with unprecedented financial stresses and sharp contractions in economic activity, many central banks, including the Federal Reserve, responded with extraordinary measures. In the United States, we lowered the federal funds rate target to a range of 0 to 1 / 4 percent to help mitigate the economic downturn; we expanded the scale, scope, and maturity of our lending to provide needed liquidity to financial institutions and to address dislocations in financial markets; we jointly established currency swap lines with foreign central banks (including the Bank of Japan) to ensure the global availability of dollar funding; and we purchased a large quantity of longer-term securities to help improve the functioning of financial markets and support economic recovery. 1 Looking to the future, central banks around the world are working with their governments to prevent future crises by strengthening <b>frameworks</b> for <b>financial</b> <b>regulation</b> and supervision...|$|R
40|$|The global {{financial}} crisis has highlighted {{the need to}} regulate and monitor risk allocation at the macro level. Therefore, {{in the aftermath of}} the worldwide turmoil, the international <b>financial</b> regulatory <b>framework</b> has been reformed adopting a new approach to <b>financial</b> <b>regulation</b> and supervision. This approach takes account the regulatory objective of “financial stability” from a macro-prudential perspective concerning the financial system as a whole, namely intended as “systemic stability”. Starting from this new prospective, this work aims at advancing the feasible future <b>framework</b> of <b>financial</b> <b>regulation</b> in the global context, identifying what seems to be - at least for the moment - the best model of <b>financial</b> <b>regulation</b> to assure a sound governance of {{global financial}} markets and, thus, a more crisis-resistant global financial system. This model should represent the most reasonable and feasible solution to the political “financial trilemma”, which states that financial stability, financial integration and national financial policies are conflicting. It is possible to combine any two of the three objectives but not all three: one has to give. In fact, financial integration of markets implies more freedom or lack of regulation (free regulation), and, consequently it compromises financial stability; national regulatory autonomy (territorial <b>regulation)</b> obstructs <b>financial</b> integration; financial stability, pursued by international guidelines (global or universal regulation) limits national autonomy. Therefore, assuming that free regulation has to be neglected, we are seeking to identify the best combination of national and global regulation to ensure a better governance of globalised financial markets, namely the extent to which one can go without obstructing the progress of the other...|$|R
40|$|The global {{financial}} crisis {{that started in}} 2007 sparked several academic debates about the role that financial sector regulators played in the crisis and prompted policy reforms in the financial supervision architectures of several countries. This book focuses {{on the question of}} what accountability, independence, transparency and, more generally, governance mechanisms applicable to financial regulators can better contribute to building responsive, responsible and effective regulatory and supervisory frameworks that tackle the weaknesses of the pre-crisis regimes. It re-visits the concepts of accountability and independence of financial regulators as well as the main economic theories underlying financial services policy-making, in light of the crisis experience. In addition, it critically examines the post-crisis institutional <b>frameworks</b> of <b>financial</b> <b>regulation</b> and supervision in the EU, the US and Canada with a view to assessing whether the financial regulators of the post-{{global financial}} crisis era are well suited to effectively address the challenges and threats that global financial markets pose to the stability, integrity and good functioning of financial systems {{as well as to the}} protection of consumers, investors and society at large. Topics addressed in this volume include: - The theoretical foundations of accountability and independence in <b>financial</b> <b>regulation</b> after the crisis; - The influence of economic theory on the quality of <b>financial</b> <b>regulation</b> and supervision; - Accountability in the European Banking Union and the European System of Financial Supervision; - Post-crisis structures of <b>financial</b> <b>regulation</b> in the US and their impact on consumer/investor protection and financial stability; and - The role of financial supervision architecture in the stability of the Canadian financial system.

40|$|In the {{aftermath}} of the 2007 - 2009 Global <b>Financial</b> Crisis, <b>financial</b> <b>regulation</b> in the European Union, following an international trend, underwent a process of intensive legal reforms that led to the revision of the legal premises underpinning the EU architectural <b>framework</b> for <b>financial</b> <b>regulation</b> and supervision. The EU has attempted to design a better equipped supranational apparatus for the governance of financial markets and crises. This effort accompanies a more general questioning of the role of law in the financial sector. The interaction between financial entities and legal rules has been reexamined and novel theories have focused on the idea that legal norms are constitutive elements of finance, rather than exogenous phenomena that intervene upon markets’ spontaneous order as a deus ex machina. In addition, the behavioral dynamics influencing the choices financial consumers, professional investors and other actors of the financial markets has been scrutinized. The interaction between financial markets and regulators has been also considered through an enriched, socio-legal vision. These novel approaches helps to understand that the interaction among regulators, financial entities and consumers occurs through legal and social constructions. Furthermore, the postulate of rationality developed in financial economics and influencing the regulators’ understanding of finance has been questioned. It is now largely understood that individual cognitive processing has limited capacity and that the brain economizes upon such processing by relying on heuristics and other shortcuts, which will save time but also generate biases and predictable errors. Behavioral finance moved from the fringes of financial economics to the mainstream stage: regulatory actions are refined in order to take into account these insights that depart from the traditional rationality paradigm...|$|R

40|$|Purpose - {{this paper}} aims {{to focus on}} a number of {{unexpected}} disclosures by major Australian banks, to highlight the subjectivity of financial reports and their failure to present an accurate portrayal of the underlying realities, and to propose that corporate governance disclosures are required to provide reassurance that financial reports are trustworthy. Design/methodology/approach - Moouck's institutional <b>framework</b> of <b>financial</b> <b>regulation</b> portrays <b>financial</b> reporting as a "game" played within a set of rules. It provides insights about the subjectivity of financial reports which are iillustrated with archival evidence from banks' reports and activities. Findings - The banks' financial reports were shown, in the light of later revelations, to portray an unrealistic view of their operations. Disclosures about corporate governance practices play a strong legitimising role, enhancing perceptions that financial reports correspond with organisational realities. Research limitations/implications - This study considers a narrow population of companies within one industry. By extending the focus, greater evidence could be provided that accountings tandards and financial reporting requirements have lost their connection with business practices. Practical implications - In spite of financial reporting reforms, financial reports are becoming less reflective of companies' activities and performance. This questions the usefulness of accounting standards, and the effectiveness of regulatory systems. Future reforms to accounting standards need to address these issues. Originality/value - The paper demonstrates the contention that the financial reports of several Australian banks fail to match the realities that lie beneath is really a broader challenge to the usefulness and credibility of Australia's system of <b>financial</b> reporting and <b>regulation...</b>|$|R

40|$|Independent {{agencies}} have long dominated the institutional structure of <b>financial</b> <b>regulation.</b> But after the 2007 - 08 crisis, this Article argues, the independent agency paradigm is under attack. To monitor financial institutions more thoroughly and address future failures more effectively, the U. S. and other industrialized nations redesigned the <b>framework</b> of <b>financial</b> <b>regulation.</b> Post- 2008 laws allocate new powers not to independent bureaucrats, but to elected politicians and their direct appointees. To document this global paradigm shift, the Article examines {{the laws of}} fifteen key jurisdictions for international banking: the U. S., the U. K., France, Germany, Japan, Spain, Switzerland, Belgium, Ireland, Italy, Denmark, Canada, Australia, Mexico, and South Korea. This analysis points to a marked increase in the influence of elected politicians over banking. Politicians 2 ̆ 7 new powers extend not only over emergencies, but also over financial institutions 2 ̆ 7 regular operations. Politicians are now {{at the helm of}} innovative institutional arrangements, typically in the form of regulatory councils that encompass pre-existing independent agencies. In these councils, supermajority requirements and veto rights designate politicians as the ultimate decision-makers. The Article shows how this paradigm shift resulted from the interplay of factors unique to the 2008 crisis and long run trends. The collapse of institutions in diverse areas of financial activity, including investment banks, insurance companies, and thrifts, created a sense that independent regulators as a class had failed. Concerns about regulatory capture, combined with disillusionment with the markets 2 ̆ 7 potential to self-correct, further undermined confidence in past paradigms. Developments in financial markets attracted great interest from ordinary Americans, who {{over the last two decades}} have increasingly relied on the financial system for their pension savings, housing credit, and other investments. Politicians could not remain as distant from <b>financial</b> <b>regulation</b> as in the past. From a normative standpoint, politicians 2 ̆ 7 greater involvement in <b>financial</b> <b>regulation</b> is in line with calls for enhanced presidential control over independent agencies. Scholars have argued that the President 2 ̆ 7 s stamp of approval will increase accountability and boost the legitimacy of hard choices, such as bank bailouts. However, greater political involvement might endanger financial stability, this Article argues. Electoral strategizing can influence politicians 2 ̆ 7 bailout choices, as incumbents might be particularly sensitive to upheavals as elections approach. Politicians are also under pressure from groups at ideological extremes, which often express a deep distrust to the financial system. In this climate, financial institutions are likely to lobby politicians more intensely. Thus, the risk of a financial catastrophe may now hinge upon considerations that have little to do with the health of the financial system...|$|R

We consider the importance of iterated interactions through the theory of repeated games, case studies, and experimental evidence to identify factors favoring or hindering successful cooperation. The total number of participants, time, foresight, multiple equilibria, leadership, the magnitude and volatility of gains and losses, imperfect and asymmetric information, decision and bargaining costs, monitoring, and enforcement are all important factors. In the paper we stress the importance of an institutional approach that minimizes obstacles to reaching cooperative outcomes. We highlight the need for effective procedures to deal with systemic risk, an agreed set of rules underpinning the single European financial market (e. g. state aid rules and a single rule book), and effective restructuring, resolution and crisis management mechanisms. ...|$|R
40|$|The application, {{or to be}} more precise, the misapplication of {{securitization}} in {{the mortgage}} market had fatal consequences for the financial sector worldwide.

The aim {{of the study was}} to investigate the impact of <b>financial</b> <b>regulation</b> on economic growth in developing countries. The study was undertaken by formulating one overall research question, which was supported by two hypotheses. The study employed quantitative methodology to analyse the data. Secondary data was collected on a sample of ten developing countries in three regions (Africa, Americas and Asia Pacific). Time series data was obtained on the following variables: gross domestic products, inflation rate, interest rate, unemployment rate and financial freedom index. The data was initially analysed using trend analysis, which was followed by regression analysis. Trend analysis indicates that <b>financial</b> <b>regulation</b> is good for economic growth in developing countries. <b>Financial</b> <b>regulation</b> was measured by the financial freedom index and economic growth was measured by growth in gross domestic products. The results show a negative correlation between the two variables. When strict <b>financial</b> <b>regulations</b> are imposed, growth in gross domestic product increases. This relationship was tested statistically to quantify the percentage of change in gross domestic product attributable to <b>financial</b> <b>regulation</b> as well as its significance.

40|$|Book synopsis: The {{financial}} {{system and its}} regulation have undergone exponential growth and dramatic reform over the last thirty years. This period has witnessed major developments in the nature and intensity of financial markets, as well as repeated cycles of regulatory reform and development, often linked to crisis conditions. The recent financial crisis has led to unparalleled interest in <b>financial</b> <b>regulation</b> from policymakers, economists, legal practitioners, and the academic community, and has prompted large-scale regulatory reform. The Oxford Handbook of <b>Financial</b> <b>Regulation</b> is the first comprehensive, authoritative, and state-of-the-art account {{of the nature of}} <b>financial</b> <b>regulation.</b> Written by an international team of leading scholars in the field, it takes a contextual and comparative approach to examine scholarly, policy, and regulatory developments in the past three decades. The first three Parts of the Handbook address the underpinning horizontal themes which arise in financial regulation: {{financial system}}s and regulation; the organization of <b>financial</b> system <b>regulation,</b> including regional examples from the EU and the US; and the delivery of outcomes and regulatory techniques. The final three Parts address the major reoccurring objectives of <b>financial</b> <b>regulation,</b> widely regarded as the anchors of <b>financial</b> <b>regulation</b> internationally: <b>financial</b> stability; market efficiency, integrity, and transparency; and consumer protection. The Oxford Handbook of <b>Financial</b> <b>Regulation</b> will be an invaluable resource for scholars and students of <b>financial</b> <b>regulation,</b> and for economists, policy-makers and regulators...|$|R

40|$|<b>Financial</b> <b>regulation</b> {{in sports}} is usually {{discussed}} {{in the context of}} representing an instrument against "financial doping". Notwithstanding the merits of this discussion, this paper takes the opposite perspective and analyses how market-internal <b>financial</b> <b>regulation</b> itself may anticompetitively influence sporting results. Virtually every regulative financial intervention distorts sporting competition to some extent and creates beneficiaries and losers. Sometimes, the actual winners and losers of <b>financial</b> <b>regulation</b> stand in line with the (legitimate) goals of the <b>regulation</b> like limiting <b>financial</b> imbalances or preventing distortive midseason insolvencies of teams. However, <b>financial</b> <b>regulation</b> may also display unintended side-effects like protecting hitherto successful teams from new challengers, cementing the competitive order, creating foreclosure and entry barriers, or serving vested interests of powerful parties. All of these effects may also be hidden agendas by those who are implementing and enforcing market-internal <b>financial</b> <b>regulation</b> or influencing it. This paper analyses various types of budget caps (including salary caps) with respect to potentially anticompetitive effects. UEFA's so-called <b>Financial</b> Fair Play <b>Regulations</b> are highlighted as an example. Furthermore, the paper discusses allocation schemes of common revenues (like from the collective sale of broadcasting rights) as another area of <b>financial</b> <b>regulation</b> with potentially anticompetitive effects.
