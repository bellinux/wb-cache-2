"Of course, Mr. Thorndyke," [...] the {{official}} said, [...] "the Governor {{in his report}} does not gives us the names of any of those concerned in the matter; he simply says that although the mutiny was general, it was wholly {{the work of a}} small number of the worse class of prisoners.

We did not miss a reception, which would rather have embarrassed us.

He informed us that the place we had passed was Hillside-- Fordyce property,--but this was Earlscombe, our own. It was a great stony bit of pasture with a few scattered trees, but after the flat summit was past, the southern side was all beechwood, where a gate admitted us into a drive cut out in a slant down the otherwise steep descent, and coming out into an open space.

25|$|Surveys {{taken in}} the High Adriatic Hinterland {{indicate}} that the totality of people with first hand experience of jackals (hunters, <b>game</b> <b>keepers</b> and local people) regularly mistook red foxes affected by sarcoptic mange (or in a problematic state of moult) for golden jackals.

50|$|In early 1999, Wizards {{released}} the Pokémon TCG {{to the mass}} market. The game benefited from the Pokémon fad also of that year. At first there wasn't enough product to meet demand. Some retailers perceived the shortage to be, in part, related to Wizards's recent purchase of the <b>Game</b> <b>Keeper</b> stores where it was assumed they received Pokémon shipments more often than non-affiliated stores. By the summer of 1999, the Pokémon TCG became the first CCG to outsell Magic: The Gathering. The success of Pokémon brought renewed interest to the CCG market and many new companies began pursuing this established customer base. Large retail stores such as Walmart and Target began carrying CCGs {{and by the end}} of September, Hasbro was convinced on its profitability and bought Wizards of the Coast for $325 million.|$|E

At this location a 9-hole course was established in 1968 upon the initiative of Graham Lockey, an active member of the club who enlisted the services of Commander John Harris for the purpose, later extended to 18 holes in 1976. Following the upgrading of the course done by Henrick Jaconson, in 2006 Chris Haspel upgraded it with the addition of another course of nine holes with assistance from the head <b>game</b> <b>keeper.</b> It was converted into a 27-hole course with three loops of nine holes.|$|E

Nazinga offered a topologically-varied environment, but endemic poaching was rapidly decimating the wildlife. He and Rob set up a conservation project with their families: using local labor they constructed dams, developed some 600 km of roads, built test paddocks and an administrative base, negotiated local subsistence farmers to abandon fields within the ranch boundaries, and banned all livestock from its land. They hired local poachers as <b>game</b> <b>keepers</b> {{in order to give}} them an incentive to protect it, established a fishing management program, and invited biologists from several countries to help them carry out wildlife and ecological studies.
