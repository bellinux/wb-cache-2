500|$|Once {{the player}} gains {{access to the}} job system, {{characters}} begin to earn a separate form of experience—Ability Points—in conjunction with regular experience points.

As job levels increase, new skills become available for the character to use in {{a new form of}} customization; characters learn job-specific abilities that may be transferred to a new job. For example, a character with the Knight job who has also earned job levels as a Black Mage may set Black Magic as a secondary command, enabling both Black Mage and Knight abilities in battle. The nature of these abilities varies; while some serve as special commands in battle, others may be innate to the class or activated automatically when conditions are met, such as the Thief's [...] "Caution" [...] skill, which prevents rear attacks from enemies.

Hence, understanding what motivates people is particularly important for managers in order to develop and sustain a competitive edge. As a result, numerous theories have been advanced to help our understanding of the subject matter and from these theories many motivational methods have evolved to enhance motivation within the workplace. In addition, research has been conducted on the various types of motivational techniques utilised by companies within Ireland. However, very little research has been completed within specific geographical regions in Ireland concerning the types of motivational techniques implemented at different <b>job</b> <b>levels</b> and their impact on employees work performance. Thus the objective of this research was to identify the motivational techniques utilised at different <b>job</b> <b>levels</b> within large manufacturing and service companies in the Northwest of Ireland and examine how these techniques influence the performance levels of employees. Furthermore, the study examined if these companies have changed from traditional ways of motivating employees to newer techniques. The research methodologies used to undertake the research included interviews with the HR managers and questionnaires completed by different employees at various <b>job</b> <b>levels</b> within the participating companies. Overall the conclusions were varied. Many different types of motivation techniques were found within the study’s participating companies. Irish companies are improving their motivational techniques, however most of these techniques are only used within higher <b>job</b> <b>levels.</b> In contrast to their American counterparts, a variety of motivational techniques are utilised and implemented at all <b>job</b> <b>levels.</b> On a more positive note, the majority of these motivational techniques do increase performance <b>levels</b> at all <b>job</b> <b>levels.</b> From the extensive primary and secondary research conducted, the thesis concludes by offering a number of recommendations to assist companies in further development of their motivational techniques for all <b>job</b> <b>levels.</b> These recommendations hope to augment the success of companies through an enhanced motivated workforce...|$|R

Research data were gathered through Minnesota Job Satisfaction and Social Comparison questionnaires, respectively. According to the research findings, there is no statistically meaningful difference between the teachers’ gender, position at the school, experience in teaching and their job satisfaction and social comparison levels. However, the research shows that school level, teachers’ marital status and age have affected the teachers’ <b>job</b> satisfaction <b>levels.</b> Accordingly, primary teachers’ general <b>job</b> satisfaction <b>level</b> is higher than secondary <b>level</b> teachers’ general <b>job</b> satisfaction <b>level.</b> Single teachers’ external <b>job</b> satisfaction <b>level</b> is also higher than married teachers’ external <b>job</b> satisfaction <b>level.</b> General <b>job</b> satisfaction <b>level</b> is the highest with the teachers at the age of 20 - 25, but it is the lowest with the teachers at the age of 31 - 35.

By creating an extensive framework, this study aims to examine whether perceived work-related factors affect turnover intention in South Korean construction companies. Research design – The paper is {{based on the results of}} a questionnaire of 136 employees that was conducted and provided by a Korean construction company. Research hypotheses were tested via correlation analyses. The most influencing work-related factors, as well as differences among <b>job</b> <b>levels,</b> were determined by multiple regression analyses. Findings – Communication, immediate leaders, organizational commitment, and organizational pride substantially affect turnover intentions. All of these factors can be considered as relational factors. The most influencing factors differ among <b>job</b> <b>levels.</b> Discussion/practical implications – Immediate leaders should be aware of their role in retaining employees and enhance communication, organizational commitment and pride. This study shows how the importance of certain variables differs for groups of employees. Theoretical implications/limitations– This study is based on a sample of employees from a Korean construction company. Therefore, the generalizability of the findings has to be tested. Future research should test the proposed framework with other factors or resources. Originality/value – This study shed light on the turnover subject in the South Korean construction industry.

Political, social, technological and economic changes constantly challenge businesses to adopt new approaches in this strive for survival. These challenges affect the roles, and possibly the <b>job</b> satisfaction <b>levels</b> of first-line supervisors and middle-level managers. In this paper, the writer aimed to study and compare <b>job</b> satisfaction <b>levels</b> of first-line supervisors and middle-level managers in the Nelson Mandela Metropolitan area. The effects of job satisfaction, or the lack thereof must be clearly identifiable to the top managers. These can either be positive or negative. In the case of positive effects, managers must strive to maintain the conditions {{that contribute to the}} positive effects of job satisfaction. In the study it was observed that middle-level managers scored higher and therefore they had higher overall <b>job</b> satisfaction <b>levels</b> than first-line supervisors. The <b>job</b> satisfaction <b>levels</b> of the first-line supervisors are found to be lower in all the areas that were stated as factors affecting job satisfaction. These areas were the personality job fit, the job content, the job context, the organisational environment and the macro environment. The companies therefore have a task of improving the <b>job</b> satisfaction <b>levels</b> in these areas. The writer recommends that organisations in the Nelson Mandela Metropolitan area {{take a closer look at}} the <b>job</b> satisfaction <b>levels</b> of their first-line supervisors.

Instead of a second class, characters that are born can transcend to a new second job, different from those of a character that hasn't been reborn.
