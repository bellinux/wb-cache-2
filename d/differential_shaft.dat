The <b>differential</b> <b>shafts</b> ensure an even tension across the full {{width of the}} material. Closed-loop control of the winding tension using feedback from load cells provides the total tension-control system required for running tension-sensitive materials. Precise and accurate tension control {{is the key to}} good roll slitting. Modern machines use AC vector drives with closed-loop feedback from AC motors. When used with the correct control algorithms, they produce excellent results with the minimum of maintenance.|$|R

25|$|Locking {{differentials}} work by temporarily locking {{together a}} <b>differential's</b> output <b>shafts,</b> causing all wheels to {{turn at the}} same rate, providing torque in case of slippage.

25|$|The advertised February {{introduction}} of a fully synchronized, four-speed transmission RPO 651 was postponed until the 1961 model year. This was due to casting problems with the aluminum three speed transmission case which resulted in technical service bulletins to dealers advising {{of the potential for}} differential failure due to external leaks {{at the front of the}} transmission's counter gear shaft. The revision of the four speed transmission designated for 1961 introduction incorporated a cast iron case and a redesign of the <b>differential</b> pinion <b>shaft</b> to interface with a longer transmission output shaft and a concentric pilot for the revised transmission case. These are among many of the course corrections undertaken by Chevrolet by the end of the 1960 model year.|$|R

The shock absorber and spring mount to the lower arm to control vertical movement. The double-wishbone suspension can also be referred to as ‘double A-arm,’ though the arms themselves can be A-shaped, L-shaped, or even a single bar linkage.

50|$|Applications {{for use in}} this {{industry}} {{take full advantage of}} the many benefits electroless nickel has to offer. Deposit properties such as uniformity, corrosion resistance, lubricity and wear resistance are all reasons why the use of EN for automotive applications continues to grow. Historically, a cost sensitive market segment, auto makers have embraced the use low cost materials plated with a thin film of electroless nickel to meet strict requirements in an economical fashion. Fuel injection systems, aluminum fuel filters, brake pins and bleed valves are just a few applications that take full advantage of the deposit’s corrosion resistance. <b>Differential</b> pinion <b>shafts</b> and a variety of pins and washers are plated in large quantities due to the coatings lubricity, wear resistance and anti-galling properties (Figure 15). Brake pistons are plated in bright, medium phosphorus electroless nickel and heat treated to increase hardness and wear resistance. High deposit luster is desired and actually improves the surface finish of the piston resulting in reduced friction (Figure 16). Cast iron slip yokes are plated with EN to eliminate noise associated with galling.|$|R
5000|$|The final pre-war {{model was}} the 1938 Minx. There {{were no more}} factory-built tourers but some were made by Carbodies.

The De Luxe model had leather trim, opening quarterlights, extra trim pads, and various other comfort benefits. The 1938 model was not the final iteration before the outbreak of war, however, as the 1939 model was considerably different mechanically, with virtually the entire drivetrain improved to the extent that few parts are interchangeable with the 1938 model.

50|$|Since Protean Electric’s motors fit {{behind the}} wheels of a vehicle, {{they can be used}} as part of a drive system that does not require a gearbox, <b>differential,</b> or drive <b>shafts.</b> This creates an {{energy-efficient}} drivetrain that potentially saves cost, reduces weight and frees up space on board the vehicle that was previously dedicated to drivetrain components. According to Protean Electric, its in-wheel motors can increase fuel economy by over 30 percent depending on the battery size and driving cycle in a hybrid or plug-in hybrid vehicle. It is also capable of enabling torque vectoring by applying individual torque at optimal levels to each wheel to improve vehicle safety and handling.|$|R

Adding four-wheel drive reduced towing capability {{due to increased}} curb weight, which resulted from additional driveline components (transfer case, front axle, front <b>differential,</b> front propeller <b>shaft,</b> and so on) needed to facilitate four-wheel drive. A properly equipped K-Series half-ton or three quarter-ton class pickup could tow up to 6,500 lbs (3.25 tons) of braked trailer, whilst a properly equipped K-Series one-ton class pickup could tow 500 lbs more, up to 7,000 lbs (3.5 tons) of braked trailer.|$|R
