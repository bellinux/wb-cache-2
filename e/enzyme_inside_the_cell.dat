5000|$|... mTOR (mammalian {{target of}} rapamycin) is a kinase <b>enzyme</b> <b>inside</b> <b>the</b> <b>cell</b> that {{collects}} and interprets the numerous and varied {{growth and survival}} signals received by tumor cells. When the kinase activity of mTOR is activated, its downstream effectors, the synthesis of cell cycle proteins such as cyclin D and hypoxia-inducible factor-1a (HIF-1a) are increased. HIF-1a then stimulates VEGF. Whether or not mTOR kinase is activated, determines whether the tumor cell produces key proteins needed for proliferation, growth, survival, and angiogenesis.|$|E
40|$|High {{hydrostatic}} pressure (HP) processing is a non-thermal pasteurization technique that inactivates vegetative microorganisms while {{it tends to}} keep the sensorial aspects of the food intact. Although the exact microbial perception and inactivation mechanism of HP stress are still cryptic, our group has previously shown that the endogenously expressed Mrr restriction endonuclease of Escherichia coli K 12 plays {{a central role in}} the HP physiology of this model bacterium. In fact, previous studies have shown that moderate HP exposures (i. e. 15 min at 100 MPa at 20 °C) triggers Mrr to cause double strand breaks in the E. coli chromosome, while until then Mrr restriction activity was only found to be triggered by the methylation pattern imposed by particular methyltransferases (MTases; such as HhaII). In order to better understand the cellular impact of HP stress on E. coli, this dissertation has further scrutinized the activity and regulation of this peculiar Mrr <b>enzyme</b> <b>inside</b> <b>the</b> <b>cell.</b> Through constructing and expressing a functional Gfp-Mrr fusion protein in E. coli K 12, we were able to examine the intracellular whereabouts of Mrr, and found that this enzyme behaved as a nucleoid associated protein with a distinct multifocal localization on the nucleoid. Activation of cellular Mrr either by HP shock (100 MPa, 15 min, 20 °C) or conditional incuction of HhaII MTase activity caused nucleoid condensation, an unexpected coalescence of Mrr foci, and eventually oftenthe loss of cellular integrity. Interestingly, Mrr variants with different single amino acid substitutions, could be isolated that were specifically compromised in either HP- or HhaII-dependent activation, underscoring a mechanistic difference in the way that both triggers tend to activate Mrr. In fact, a genome-wide methylomics analysis strongly suggested that, in contrast to HhaII-mediated activation, HP-mediated activation of Mrr does not require a particular methylation imprint. To further probe for the embedment of Mrr in the cellular physiology of E. coli K 12, subsequent approaches were aimed to look for regulators of mrr expression or for proteins interacting with Mrr. By replacing the mrr gene with the lacZ reporter gene, mrr promoter activity could be examined, revealing very low basal expression levels. Nevertheless, genetic approaches failed to identify potential regulatorsof mrr expression. At the protein level, Bacterial Two Hybrid studies suggested that Mrr could interact with itself as well as with the MogA protein of E. coli, which is involved in intracellular molybdenum chelation. The latter interaction, however, was surprising and remains to be corroborated. Finally, a Strep -tag based affinity chromatography purification strategy for the Mrr protein was established, allowing future in vitro structure-function studies of this enzyme. In summary, our results reveal that Mrr can take part in complex spatial distributions on the E. coli nucleoid, and that its activation by HP is fundamentally different from its normal activation in response to specific methylation patterns. status: publishe...|$|E

Rate of inversion increases exponentially with temperature; the temperature characteristic in the Arrhenius equation is 10, 700 below 13 – 17 °C., and 8, 300 above that temperature. Temperature inactivation occurs above 40 °C. The effects of temperature upon rate of inversion were the same using Fleischmann's yeast cake, the same yeast killed with toluene, and a pure strain (G. M. No. 21062) of bakers' yeast. The last differed from the other two only {{in the fact that}} its critical temperature was 13 °C. as compared with 17 °C. for the others.

40|$|Strains of Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium LT 2 {{lacking a}} {{functional}} 2 -methylcitric acid cycle (2 -MCC) display increased sensitivity to propionate. Previous work from our group {{indicated that this}} sensitivity to propionate is {{in part due to}} the production of 2 -methylcitrate (2 -MC) by the Krebs cycle enzyme citrate synthase (GltA). Here we report in vivo and in vitro data which show that a target of the 2 -MC isomer produced by GltA (2 -MCGltA) is fructose- 1, 6 -bisphosphatase (FBPase), a key enzyme in gluconeogenesis. Lack of growth due to inhibition of FBPase by 2 -MCGltA was overcome by increasing the level of FBPase or by micromolar amounts of glucose in the medium. We isolated an fbp allele encoding a single amino acid substitution in FBPase (S 123 F), which allowed a strain lacking a functional 2 -MCC to grow in the presence of propionate. We show that the 2 -MCGltA and the 2 -MC isomer synthesized by the 2 -MC synthase (PrpC; 2 -MCPrpC) are not equally toxic to <b>the</b> <b>cell,</b> with 2 -MCGltA being significantly more toxic than 2 -MCPrpC.

30|$|The {{delivery}} of drug molecules across the BBB follows two basic perspective, molecular approach, and polymeric carrier approach. In the molecular approach, drugs are nanoionized or ligand attached {{and can be}} administered to target brain <b>cells.</b> <b>The</b> drugs can be further activated by <b>enzymes</b> afterwards <b>inside</b> <b>the</b> target <b>cells.</b> Yet {{due to the lack}} of availability of such customized drugs, only certain drugs with specific functionality can be targeted molecularly. Additionally, a metabolic pathway is always required for the activation of these drugs inside CNS—further narrowing options. Another approach of employing nanodrug to CNS is to deliver drug via polymeric carriers. These vectors can be tuned by choosing the matrix or polymer system and can be administered intrathecally, intravenously, or as an implantable cerebral device. Nanocarriers such as liposomes and polymeric nanoparticles are adept for protecting the payload drugs from being metabolized and ensure a sustained release of the embedded substances. For instance, Gliadel® is a wafer composed of polyanhydride polymer (poly [1, 3 -bis(carb-oxyphenoxy) propane-co-sebacic acid]) (PPCP-SA) releases carmustine (BCNU) in a sustained manner post-brain implantation [240, 241].|$|R
40|$|Nucleoside reverse {{transcriptase}} inhibitors (NRTIs) remain {{the cornerstone of}} {{highly active antiretroviral therapy}} (HAART) combination regimens. However, it has been known for some time that these agents have the potential to cause varied side effects, many of which are thought to be due to their effects on mitochondria. Mitochondria, the key energy generating organelles in <b>the</b> <b>cell,</b> are unique in having their own DNA, a double stranded circular genome of about 16 000 bases. There is a separate <b>enzyme</b> present <b>inside</b> <b>the</b> <b>cell</b> that replicates mitochondrial DNA, polymerase gamma. NRTIs can affect the function of this enzyme and this may lead to depletion of mitochondrial DNA or qualitative changes. The study of inherited mitochondrial diseases has led to further understanding of the consequences of mutations or depletion in mitochondrial DNA. Key among these is the realisation that there may be substantial heteroplasmy among mitochondria within a given cell, and among cells in a particular tissue. The unpredictable nature of mitochondrial segregation during cellular replication makes it difficult to predict the likelihood of dysfunction in a given tissue. In addition, there is a threshold effect for the expression of mitochondrial dysfunction, both at the mitochondrial and cellular level. Various clinical and in vitro studies have suggested that NRTIs are associated with mitochondrial dysfunction in different tissues, although the weight of evidence is limited in many cases. The heterogeneity in the tissues affected by the different drugs raises interesting questions, and possible explanations include differential distribution or activation of these agents. This article reviews the major recognised toxicities associated with NRTI therapy and evidence for mitochondrial dysfunction in these complications. Data were identified through searching of online databases including Medline and Current Contents for relevant articles, along with abstracts and posters from recent conferences in the HIV and mitochondrial fields...|$|R
25|$|Oxygen has a {{very low}} {{solubility}} in water, and is therefore carried in the blood loosely combined with hemoglobin. The oxygen is held on the hemoglobin by four ferrous iron-containing heme groups per hemoglobin molecule. When all the heme groups carry one O2 molecule each the blood {{is said to be}} “saturated” with oxygen, and no further increase in the partial pressure of oxygen will meaningfully increase the oxygen concentration of the blood. Most of the carbon dioxide in the blood is carried as bicarbonate ions (HCO3−) in the plasma. However the conversion of dissolved CO2 into HCO3− (through the addition of water) is too slow for {{the rate at which the}} blood circulates through the tissues on the one hand, and through alveolar capillaries on the other. The reaction is therefore catalyzed by carbonic anhydrase, an <b>enzyme</b> <b>inside</b> <b>the</b> red blood <b>cells.</b> <b>The</b> reaction can go in both directions depending on the prevailing partial pressure of CO2. A small amount of carbon dioxide is carried on the protein portion of the hemoglobin molecules as carbamino groups. The total concentration of carbon dioxide (in the form of bicarbonate ions, dissolved CO2, and carbamino groups) in arterial blood (i.e. after it has equilibrated with the alveolar air) is about 26mM (or 58ml/100 ml), compared to the concentration of oxygen in saturated arterial blood of about 9mM (or 20ml/100 ml blood).|$|R

Specifically, we use the FLIM FRET of living <b>cells</b> via <b>the</b> confocal fluorescence microscopy. A specially designed lentivector pLVT with the DNA fragment of TagRFP- 23 -KFP was applied for transduction of A 549 cell lines. Computer simulations are carried out to estimate FRET efficiency and to analyze possible steric restrictions of the reaction between the substrate TagRFP- 23 -KFP and caspase- 3 dimer. Successful use of the fuse protein TagRFP- 23 -KFP to register the caspase- 3 activation based on average life-time measurements is demonstrated. We show that the average life-time distribution is dramatically changed for <b>cells</b> with <b>the</b> modified morphology that is typical for apoptosis. Namely, the short-lived component at 1. 8 - 2. 1 ns completely disappears and the long-lived component appears at 2. 4 - 2. 6 ns. The latter is a fingerprint of the TagRFP molecule released after cleavage of the TagRFP- 23 -KFP complex by caspase- 3. Analysis of life-time distributions for population of cells allows us to discriminate apoptotic and surviving cells within single frame and to peform statistical analysis of drug efficiency. This system can be adjusted for HTS by using special readers oriented on measurements of fluorescence life-time. </p...|$|R

So, it is an event that begins with pancreatic injury, elicits an acute inflammatory response, encompasses a variety of complications and generally resolves over time. Different conditions are known to induce this disorder, although the innermost mechanisms and how they act to develop the disease are still unknown. We summarize some well established aspects. A phase sequence has been proposed: etiology factors generate other conditions inside acinar <b>cells</b> that favor <b>the</b> AP development with some systemic events; genetic factors could be involved as susceptibility and modifying elements. AP is a disease with extremely different clinical expressions. Most patients suffer a mild and limited disease, but about one fifth of cases develop multi organ failure, accompanied by high mortality. This great variability in presentation, clinical course and complications has given rise to the confusion related to AP related terminology. However, consensus meetings have provided uniform definitions, including the severity of the illness. The clinical management is mainly based on the disease 4;s severity and must be directed to correct the underlying predisposing factors and control the inflammatory process itself. The first step is to determine if it is mild or severe. We review the principal aspects to be considered in this treatment, as reflected in several clinical practice guidelines. For the last 25 years, there has been a global increase in incidence of AP, along with many advances in diagnosis and treatment. However, progress in knowledge of its pathogenesis is scarce...|$|R
50|$|Retroviruses are RNA viruses {{with two}} {{positive}} (directly encode viral proteins) single-strand genomes. They are enveloped viruses (i.e. have a non-rigid lipid outer membrane surface) with embedded ligands for binding to cell surface target molecules. <b>The</b> <b>cell</b> and viral membranes fuse, releasing the virus inner core particle which packages the RNA genomes, the reverse transcriptase and integrase <b>enzymes.</b> Once <b>inside</b> <b>the</b> target <b>cell,</b> <b>the</b> reverse transcriptase copies the RNA into DNA {{and then to}} double stranded DNA, the complex moves to the nucleus and the DNA is inserted into the host genome by the viral integrase. Toca 511 is a RRV derived from a mouse gammaretrovirus and has an amphotropic envelope, meaning that it can infect both mouse cells and cells of other species, including human cells. RRVs selectively infect and integrate into the DNA of cancer cells, which then serve as factories to produce more RRVs by budding. These progeny RRVs infect neighboring cancer cells, providing long-term presence of the encoded therapeutic gene or genes.Toca 511 infects human cells with selectivity for cancer cells in vivo, because genome integration is dependent on cell division and viral replication is inhibited by innate and adaptive immune responses, defective in malignant tissues. Toca 511 spreads through cancer cells and stably delivers the transgene CD. The CD enzyme therefore converts courses of the oral prodrug Toca FC into high concentrations of 5-FU only in <b>the</b> infected tumor <b>cell</b> microenvironment, thus avoiding toxic side-effects. In addition to the direct killing of Toca 511-infected cancer cells, 5-FU can kill neighboring uninfected cancer cells and immune-suppressive myeloid cells, including myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSCs), as well as tumor associated macrophages (TAMs). Cancer cell death releases previously immune-invisible cancer antigens, and causes release of inflammatory damage-associated molecular signals, resulting in antigen presentation and activation of CD4 (helper) and CD8 (killer) T cells. This activation results in acquired anti-tumor immunity, with further induction and harnessing of <b>the</b> T <b>cells</b> against <b>the</b> tumor, and provides durable control of the cancer. This approach is designed to selectively destroy cancer <b>cells</b> and <b>the</b> surrounding immune suppressed tumor microenvironment, while leaving healthy cells unharmed.
