This paper study equilibrium state-of-stress in metrically-incompatible 2 D elastic materials.

We develop a perturbative approximation method for solving this stress function, valid for any constitutive relation. We apply the method for the case of a <b>Hookean</b> <b>solid</b> to solve prototypical examples in which the classical Airy approach is either inaccurate or inapplicable.

40|$|This {{paper is}} {{concerned}} with the modelling of problems involving viscoelastic materials which, even in their simplest form, exhibit behaviour characteristic of both classical <b>Hookean</b> <b>solids</b> and Newtonian fluids. The resulting effects are important when the material is deforming under an applied load.

See for example [21, 6, 28]. Moreover, the material somehow keeps a record of its response history and, for this reason, viscoelastic materials are said to possess memory. This memory is manifest in the constitutive relationship between the stress and strain tensors, oe and ", and as a result mathematical models of viscoelastic behaviour take the form of partial differential Volterra (pdv) equation problems.

This classical setup has received considerable attention lately, being used by various experimental groups as a probe to measure the surface properties and stretching modulus of thin solid films. Despite the apparent simplicity of this method, the geometric nonlinearity inherent in the mechanical response of thin solid objects renders the analysis of the resulting data a nontrivial task. Importantly, the essence of this difficulty is in the geometric coupling between in-plane stress and out-of-plane deformations, and hence is present in the behaviour of <b>Hookean</b> <b>solids</b> even when the slope of the deformed membrane remains small. Here we take a systematic approach to address this problem, using the membrane limit of the Föppl-von-Kármán equations.

40|$|Abstract—In {{a simple}} impact {{experiment}} with a <b>Hookean</b> <b>solid,</b> {{such as a}} glass beam, the energy absorbed is simply related to the modulus of elasticity and fracture strength at short times. However, with plastics under nearly all conditions, the energy absorption due to pure elastic deformations is small and toughness is achieved through large deformations taking place after yield. Even in "brittle " plastics the energy required for crack propagation is mainly determined by the plastic deformation processes, such as crazing, which {{take place in a}} small volume of material at the crack tip. In such cases a major factor in determining the total energy absorbed by the test-piece is the volume of plastically strained material. Generally it is found that plastic deformation processes in polymers tend to be unstable leading to large localised strains instead of to uniform deformation. This is seen in necking under tension and in shear bands. A basic condition for such localization is the occurrence of strain softening and, in tension, material attenuation—as originally proposed by Considere. This conclusion is broadly in line with known stress—strain relations. For example, in the case of polycarbonate it can be shown that an annealing treatment leads to increased strain softening, a decrease in the volume of plastic strain during impact and a lower impact strength. This occurs without changes in relaxation behaviour. Since the energy absorbed in the brittle fracture of many plastics involves crazing, which is of course a plasti...|$|E
40|$|Rheology {{deals with}} the {{deformation}} and flow of any material {{under the influence of}} an applied stress. In practical applications, it is related with flow, transport, and handling any simple and complex fluids [1]. It deals with a variety of materials from elastic <b>Hookean</b> <b>solids</b> to viscous Newtonian liquid. In general, rheology is concerned with the deformation of solid materials including metals, plastics, and rubbers, and liquids such as polymer melts, slurries, and polymer solutions. Any rheometric technique involves the simultaneous assessment of force, and deformation and/or rate as a function of temperature. Through the appropriate rheometrical equations, such basic measurements are converted into quantities of rheological interest, for instance, shear or extensional stress and rate in isothermal condition. The rheometrical equations are established by considering the test geometry and type of flow involved, with respect to several hypotheses dealing with the nature of the fluid and the boundary conditions; the fluid is generally assumed to be homogeneous and incompressible, and ideal boundaries are considered, for instance, no wall slip...|$|R

40|$|Bacterial {{attachment}} to a fluid interface {{can lead to}} the formation of a film with physicochemical properties that evolve with time. We study the time evolution of interface (micro) mechanics for interfaces between oil and bacterial suspensions by following the motion of colloidal probes trapped by capillarity to determine the interface microrheology. Initially, active bacteria at and near the interface drive superdiffusive motion of the colloidal probes. Over timescales of minutes, the bacteria form a viscoelastic film which we discuss as a quasi-two-dimensional, active, glassy system. To study late stage mechanics of the film, we use pendant drop elastometry. The films, grown over tens of hours on oil drops, are expanded and compressed by changing the drop volume. For small strains, by modeling the films as 2 D <b>Hookean</b> <b>solids,</b> we estimate the film elastic moduli, finding values similar to those reported in the literature for the bacteria themselves. For large strains, the films are highly hysteretic. Finally, from wrinkles formed on highly compressed drops, we estimate film bending energies. The dramatic restructuring of the interface by such robust films has broad implications, e. g. in the study of active colloids, in understanding the community dynamics of bacteria, and in applied settings including bioremediation...|$|R
40|$|AbstractSeparation of two {{particles}} {{is characterized}} by a magnitude of the bond energy, which limits the accumulated energy of the particle interaction. In the case of a solid composed of many particles a magnitude of the average bond energy – the failure energy – exists, which limits the energy that can be accumulated in an infinitesimal material volume under strain. The energy limiter controls material softening, which indicates failure. Thus, by limiting the stored energy density it is possible to include a description of material failure in the constitutive model. When the failure energy, i. e. the energy limiter, is introduced in the constitutive model it can be calibrated in macroscopic experiments. Traditional elasticity models do not have energy limiters and they allow for the unlimited energy accumulation under the strain increase, which is physically meaningless because no material can sustain large enough strains without failure. We use elasticity with energy limiters for modeling dynamic failure propagation in brittle solids. Two models of isotropic <b>Hookean</b> <b>solids</b> with energy limiters are introduced and examined in simulations of the penetration of a projectile into a brittle plate in the present work. The first model uses the energy limiter with the overall energy term while the second model has separate energy limiters for the volumetric and deviatoric components. The results of the penetration simulation obtained by using both models are similar qualitatively. It is remarkable that the penetration depth is mesh-independent for fine meshes even without the special regularization procedures. This is the first work where the methods of elasticity with energy limiters are used in dynamic analysis of brittle failure...|$|R
40|$|In this paper, {{we examine}} the {{applicability}} of the approximation, fg≈ f g, within Backus (1962) averaging. This approximation is a crucial step in the method proposed by Backus (1962), which is widely used in studying wave propagation in layered <b>Hookean</b> <b>solids.</b> According to this approximation, the average of the product of a rapidly varying function and a slowly varying function is approximately equal to the product of the averages of those two functions. Considering that the rapidly varying function represents the mechanical properties of layers, we express it as a step function. The slowly varying function is continuous, since it represents the components of the stress or strain tensors. In this paper, beyond the upper bound of the error for that approximation, which is formulated by Bos et al. (2017), we provide a statistical analysis of the approximation by allowing the function values to be sampled from general distributions. Even though, according to the upper bound, Backus (1962) averaging might not appear as a viable approach, we show that-for cases representative of physical scenarios modelled by such an averaging-the approximation is typically quite good. We identify the cases for which there can be a deterioration in its efficacy. In particular, we examine a special case for which the approximation results in spurious values. However, such a case-though physically realizable-is not likely to appear in seismology, where the Backus (1962) averaging is commonly used. Yet, such values might occur in material sciences, in general, for which the Backus (1962) averaging is also considered. Comment: Has been submitted to the Journal of Elasticity for peer revie...|$|R

40|$|The surface {{oscillations}} in a deformable wall {{are known}} to induce an instability in the adjacent flow {{even in the absence}} of inertia. This instability, if understood properly, can be exploited to generate a well-mixed flow pattern with improved transport coefficients in microfluidic systems, wherein the benefits of inertial instabilities can not be realised. In order to utilise the wall deformability in micro-devices as well as other biotechnological applications, the quantitative knowledge of the critical parameter for the on-set of instability and the nature of bifurcation in the region of transition point are essential. With this objective, a major portion of this thesis deals with the stability analysis of flow past a flexible surface. For Newtonian flow over a deformable solid medium, the analyses of hydrodynamic stability in two flow regimes are presented: the viscous mode instability in the limit of zero Reynolds number, and the wall mode instability in the limit of high Reynolds number. The flexible solid in both analyses is described as a neo-Hookean solid continuum of finite thickness. The previous work on viscous instability using the same solid model ignored the viscous dissipation in the solid. In the present study, a purely elastic neo-Hookean model is augmented to incorporate the viscous stresses accounting for the dissipative mechanism in an aqueous gel-like solid medium. The linear stability analysis for this neo-Hookean viscoelastic solid shows a dramatic influence of solid viscosity on the stability behaviour. The important parameter here is where ηr is the solid viscosity relative to the fluid viscosity and H is the solid-to-fluid thickness ratio. While the effect solid viscosity is stabilizing for a further increase in viscosity in the regime reduces the critical shear rate for transition, indicating a destabilizing influence of solid viscosity. The weakly nonlinear analysis indicates that the bifurcation is subcritical for most values of H when ηr = 0. However, for non-zero solid viscosity, the analysis reveals a range of ηr for which the nature of bifurcation is supercritical. The results are in contrast to the behaviour for the <b>Hookean</b> (linear) elastic <b>solid,</b> for which the effect of solid viscosity is always stabilising and the bifurcation is subcritical for all values of H and ηr. For the wall mode instability, critical parameters for the linear and the neo-Hookean elastic solid are found to be very close. The weakly nonlinear analysis of the wall mode instability shows that the instability is driven to a supercritically stable branch, indicating the possibility of a stable complex flow pattern which is) correction to the base flow. The amplitude of the supercritically bifurcated equilibrium state, A 1 e, is derived in the vicinity of the critical point, and its scaling with the flow Reynolds number is obtained. The nonlinear analysis is also carried out using the asymptotic analysis in small parameter Re− 1 / 3. The asymptotic results are found to be in good agreement with the numerical solutions for For a polymeric flow over a deformable solid medium, the viscous instability is analysed by extending the viscous mode for the Newtonian fluid to the ﬂuid with finite elasticity. The viscoelastic fluid is described by an Oldroyd-B model which introduces two additional parameters: the Weissenberg number, W, and β, the ratio of solvent-to-solution viscosity. The polymer viscosity parameter β is an indirect measure of polymer concentration with the extreme cases of β = 1 representing the Newtonian fluid and β = 0 the upper convected Maxwell fluid. The analysis considers both the linearly elastic and the neo-Hookean models to describe the deformable solid. The analysis reveals the presence of two classes of modes: the finite wavelength modes and the shortwave modes. The behaviour of the finite wavelength modes is similar for both the models of solid medium. The effect of increasing fluid Weissenberg number and also increasing polymer concentration (achieved by reducing β below 1) on the finite wavelength instability is stabilising. The viscous instability ceases to exist for W larger than a certain maximum value Wmax. The behaviour of the shortwave mode is remarkably different for both the models of solid. Using the shortwave asymptotic, the differences are elucidated and it is shown that the shortwave instabilities in both the models are qualitatively different modes. For a linear elastic solid model, the shortwave mode is attributed to the normal-stresses in polymeric fluid with high Weissenberg number. This mode does not exist for the Newtonian flow and is a downstream travelling disturbance wave. On the other hand, the shortwave mode for the neo-Hookean model is attributed to the normal-stress difference in the elastic solid. Hence, this mode does exist for the Newtonian fluid and is an upstream travelling disturbance wave. The role of polymer concentration in the criticality of finite wavelength and shortwave modes is examined for a wide range of Weissenberg number. The results are condensed in a map showing the stability boundaries in parametric space covering β, W and H. The weakly nonlinear analysis reveals that the bifurcation of linear instability is subcritical when there is no dissipation in the solid. The nature of bifurcation, however, changes to supercritical when the viscous effects in the solid are taken into account. The final problem of this thesis deals with the flow past a rigid surface. Here, the stability of base profile in a plane Couette flow of dilute polymeric fluid is studied at moderate Reynolds number. Three variants of Oldroyd-B model have been analysed, viz. the classical Oldroyd-B model, the diffusive Oldroyd-B model, and the non-homogeneous Oldroyd-B model. The Newtonian wall modes are modified marginally for the polymeric fluid described by the classical Oldroyd-B model. The Oldroyd-B model with artificial diffusivity introduces the additional ‘diffusive modes’ which scale with P´eclet number. The diffusive modes become the slowest decaying modes, in comparison to the wall modes, for large wavenumber disturbances. For these two models, the polymeric flow is linearly stable. Using the equilibrium flow method, wherein the nonlinear flow is assumed to be at the transition point, the finite amplitude disturbances are analysed, and the threshold energy necessary for subcritical transition is estimated. The third variant of Oldroyd-B model accounts for non-homogeneous polymer concentration coupled with the stress field. This model exhibits an instability in the linear analysis. The ‘concentration mode’ becomes unstable when the fluid Weissenberg number exceeds a certain transition value. This instability is driven by the stress-induced fluctuations in polymer number density...|$|R
