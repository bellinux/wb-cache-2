500|$|In {{the early}} 1950s, Ford {{declined}} offers {{to run for}} either the Senate or the Michigan governorship. Rather, his ambition was to become Speaker of the House, which he called [...] "the ultimate achievement. To sit up there and be the head honcho of 434 other people and have the responsibility, aside from the achievement, of trying to run the greatest legislative body {{in the history of}} mankind ... I think <b>I</b> <b>got</b> <b>that</b> ambition within a year or two after I was in the House of Representatives".|$|E

She described what her album is about and then she sent me some CDs of what type of stuff's been inspiring her to make the record, and {{it happened to be}} a lot of stuff that I grew up on in the early '70s, 'cause I'm 40. Aretha Franklin, Etta James, Marvin Gaye, Esther Williams, all kinds of different things. Once I saw that's the vibe she wanted, I still had to make it sound like the way my beats thump and stuff but still give her the atmosphere she's trying to bring out on the singing side.|$|E
500|$|In March 1984, when NYU student Rick Rubin and promoter-manager Russell Simmons {{founded the}} then-independent Def Jam label, 16yearold St. Albans, Queens native James Todd Smith was {{creating}} demo tapes in his grandparents' home. His grandfather, a jazz saxophonist, purchased him $2,000 worth of stereo equipment, including two turntables, an audio mixer and an amplifier. Smith later discussed his childhood background and rapping, stating that [...] "By the time <b>I</b> <b>got</b> <b>that</b> equipment, I {{was already a}} rapper. In this neighborhood, the kids grow up in rap. It's like speaking Spanish if you grow up in an all-Spanish house. I got into it when I was about 9, and since then all I wanted {{was to make a}} record and hear it on the radio." [...] By using the mixing table he had received from his grandfather, Smith produced and mixed his own demos and sent them to various record companies throughout New York City, including Simmons' and Rubin's own Def Jam Recordings.|$|E

500|$|Patton's [...] "big break" [...] came in 2002, when he {{was cast}} to replace Steve Burns as Joe, the second host of the Nickelodeon children's {{television}} program Blue's Clues. [...] He was up for a part in [...] at the time, but considered the role as Joe [...] "a happy accident". [...] Patton became a [...] "household name" [...] and has been called [...] "an unqualified star to the 5-and-under set and their parents". [...] He was subjected to [...] "the same kind of scrutiny" [...] as Burns, {{who was involved in}} Patton's selection and helped train him, to earn the role. [...] Patton was selected out of 1,500 auditions. [...] He had never seen the show before his audition, but like Burns was the favorite with preschool test audiences. [...] He said, [...] "I am convinced that <b>I</b> <b>got</b> <b>that</b> part because of a Christopher Walken impression I sometimes do. [...] There's a tape out there, somewhere, with both Steve Burns and myself doing a Blue's Clues scene both as Christopher Walken, which we did at the screen test. I haven't seen the tape, but I know somewhere it still exists". [...] Beginning in September 2000, Burns trained Patton to take over the host spot and advised him not to [...] "think of [...] as children's TV", but rather as [...] "acting and telling the truth".|$|E
2500|$|Immediately {{after the}} fight, Henderson stated that [...] "I hit him hard, but <b>I</b> <b>got</b> <b>that</b> last blow in just to {{shut him up}} a little bit." [...] After UFC {{president}} Dana White said Henderson had made the comment in jest, Henderson clarified by stating, [...] "When you're {{in the heat of}} the moment, the ref hadn't stopped me yet, who knows what's going to happen, if he's going to recover. I really only hit him twice, once on my feet, once on the ground. I didn't keep going. I didn't go after him after the ref tried to stop me, it was nothing like that. It was a reaction of mine to keep going until I was stopped—and you know, it did feel good though." ...|$|E
2500|$|On March 17, 2014, Gossow {{released}} a statement announcing her departure from the group and welcoming her replacement, former vocalist of Canadian extreme metal band The Agonist, Alissa White-Gluz. In the statement, she wrote that while she had enjoyed her time with the group, {{it was time for}} her to move on, be with her family and pursue other interests. Gossow did confirm that she would remain Arch Enemy's business manager, and would be [...] "passing the torch to the super talented Alissa White-Gluz, whom I’ve known as a dear friend and a superb vocalist for many years. I always thought she deserved a chance to shine – and now she’s getting it. Just like <b>I</b> <b>got</b> <b>that</b> chance back in 2001." ...|$|E

I still do." [...] Hanks won his second Best Actor Academy Award for his role in Forrest Gump, becoming only the second actor to have accomplished the feat of winning consecutive Best Actor Oscars. (Spencer Tracy was the first, winning in 1937–38. Hanks and Tracy were the same age at the time they received their Academy Awards: 37 for the first and 38 for the second.) ...|$|E
2500|$|While filming Beneath the Planet of the Apes, Harrison {{was cast}} {{as one of}} a trio of starlets in the Fox-produced NBC TV series Bracken's World. It was, she said, [...] "a series Dick for a long time had wanted to do. So <b>I</b> <b>got</b> <b>that</b> part and I had to finish Beneath and go right into the pilot..." [...] She played Paulette Douglas, a naive young woman and {{aspiring}} actress, who tried to balance studio pressures with her romance with a studio stuntman (Harrison's Felony Squad co-star Dennis Cole). The series also starred Emmy Award-winning actress Jeanne Cooper as Douglas's pushy mother. Harrison began filming the day after she finished her work on Beneath the Planet of the Apes.

2500|$|DeLonge {{first began}} skateboarding {{in the third}} grade, which would consume much his {{activity}} outside of school. [...] "I lived, ate, and breathed skateboarding. All I did all day long was skateboard. It was all I cared about," [...] he later remarked. He and friends would begin at one side of San Diego and attempt to skateboard to the other half, intermittently pulling pranks on people in the process. As such, he was an average student: [...] "I knew exactly how hard I had to work in school. As long as <b>I</b> <b>got</b> <b>that</b> C, I wouldn't try one minute extra to get a B. I just cared about skateboarding and music." [...] His parents were constantly fighting in his formative years, culminating in a divorce when DeLonge was 18. [...] Shortly thereafter, his mother lost her job. DeLonge promptly moved out, feeling as though he needed to start his life. His brother was also away {{at that time in}} the United States Army, and his departure affected his family. [...] "My mom and sister were left asking, 'What happened to our family?'".|$|E
