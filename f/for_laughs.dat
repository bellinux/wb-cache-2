25|$|Terry Teachout, National Review (August 12, 2002) — Chaykin and Hutton {{are as good}} {{in tandem}} as they are separately, for they {{understand}} that the Wolfe books are less mystery stories than domestic comedies, the continuing saga of two iron-willed codependents engaged in an endless game of one-upmanship. … At least half the fun of the Wolfe books comes from {{the way in which}} Stout plays this struggle <b>for</b> <b>laughs,</b> and Chaykin and Hutton make the most of it, sniping at each other with naughty glee.|$|E
25|$|Off screen, Farley {{was well}} known for his pranks {{in the offices of}} Saturday Night Live. Sandler and Farley would make late-night prank phone calls from the SNL offices in Rockefeller Center, with Sandler {{speaking}} in an old woman's voice and Farley farting into the phone and mooning cars from a limousine. He was also known to frequently get naked and do various stunts <b>for</b> <b>laughs.</b> Chris Rock once claimed that he probably saw Farley's private parts more than Farley's girlfriend did.

The Bushwhackers and Men on a Mission defeated Bigelow, Bastion Booger, and the Headshrinkers in a match that played more <b>for</b> <b>laughs</b> than serious wrestling. The team also faced another recently signed team: Steven Dunn and Timothy Well also known as Well Dunn. By 1995, the Bushwhackers were used almost exclusively to put over teams such as The Blu Twins.|$|E

Ann Zivotsky, {{a writer for the}} North County Times, commented, [...] "Watching Tucci and Shalhoub play this <b>for</b> <b>laughs</b> would have been enough for some shows, but the Monk writers take the opportunity to let the movie actor share with Monk the insights he's learned about the detective, which may help, or hurt, Monk." [...] Finley and David Kronke of Los Angeles Daily News also highlighted the line [...] " [...] wanted to play a character that wasn't so depressing and dark. He's in England doing Hamlet." ...|$|E
500|$|Stampede {{officials}} {{estimated in}} 2009 {{that the city}} of Calgary had a gross economic impact of $172.4 million from the ten-day event alone, with a wider provincial total of $226.7 million. [...] In terms of economic impact, the Stampede is the highest grossing festival in Canada, ahead of Ottawa's Winterlude, the Canadian National Exhibition in Toronto, and the Just <b>for</b> <b>Laughs</b> festival in Montreal. [...] Additionally, Stampede officials estimate that for every dollar spent at Stampede Park, tourists spend $2.65 {{in the rest of}} the city. A poll conducted in 2011 found that 40 percent of Calgarians who intended to attend the Stampede expected to spend $150–$400 over the course of the event, and 7 percent stated that they would spend more than that.|$|E
500|$|The episode, however, was {{not without}} its critics. Tor.com {{reviewer}} Meghan Deans was more critical of the episode, writing {{that it had a}} [...] "flawed construction that diminishes what should {{have been one of the}} series' smartest and most affectionate demonstrations of self-parody". She found the way it attempted to depict Van Blundht as a sympathetic villain and play rape <b>for</b> <b>laughs</b> to be unsettling. However, she did praise the way the episode continued the comedic tradition of making fun of Mulder. Cyriaque Lamar from i09 called Eddie Van Blundht one of [...] "The 10 Most Ridiculous X-Files Monsters". The reviewer, however, did amend his article, writing, [...] "Some readers are concerned that I'm hating on 'Small Potatoes,' which is not the case. That episode was definitely fun, but Eddie impregnated a woman while impersonating Mark Hamill. If that's not a ridiculous monster-of-the-week, I don't know what is." ...|$|E

500|$|Reviewers echoed {{that while}} the mission served as {{political}} commentary {{on the use of}} torture by the United States government, its use of torture was in poor taste. IGN's Keza MacDonald felt the torture sequence [...] "pushed the boundaries of taste" [...] and Polygons Chris Plante commented: [...] "The script plays it <b>for</b> <b>laughs.</b> I felt nauseated". Carolyn Petit of GameSpot felt that placing the torture scene in context with the monologue created a hypocrisy in the mission's function as a commentary device. In an editorial, Tom Bramwell of Eurogamer discussed whether the political commentary was overshadowed by the violent content and compared the mission to s [...] "No Russian" [...] controversy. He said that the close-up camera and quick time events accentuated the sequence's impact beyond the violence depicted in previous Grand Theft Auto games. Summarising its function as [...] "flawed", he considered the sequence lacking enough context to justify its violence.|$|E
500|$|Several critics praised {{this episode}} for its {{character}} development, {{something that they}} said was missing in the previous episodes. Robert Canning of IGN said that although there was still {{plenty of room for}} growth, the episode gave a better understanding of Liz and Jenna's friendship. He felt that prior to the episode, nothing was known about Liz and Jenna's longtime friendship, {{and that there was no}} depth to it. Canning said that Liz's admission of being somewhat jealous of Jenna's success was a much needed storyline for the show, and one that gave the audience something deeper to latch onto. However, Canning pointed out that small hints of what their friendship was like in the past were played <b>for</b> <b>laughs</b> as opposed to establishing any sort of history. Canning found that their verbal sparring really [...] "solidified their bond", and that by the end of the episode the audience had seen their [...] "human side" [...] and the [...] "characters had become people".|$|E
500|$|The second film, Mr. Bean's Holiday, was {{announced}} {{to be in}} development in March 2005, and would see Mr. Bean going to France, [...] despite an earlier rumor in February 2001 stating that unproduced script outline by screenwriter Richard Curtis would see him on an Australian misadventure. Work on the film occurred during 2006 and was directed by Steve Bendelack, with its released in the United Kingdom on 30 March 2007; it premiered in North America on 17 July that year, at the Just <b>for</b> <b>Laughs</b> festival in Canada where the character had been launched 20 years earlier, before being released nationwide over a month later on 24 August. The film follows Bean on an eventful journey across France for a holiday in the French Riviera, which {{after a number of}} misfortunes culminates in an unscheduled screening of his video diary at the Cannes Film Festival. The film is notable for a mixture of traditional movie filmography, and home-shot video camera filmography. The film grossed nearly US$230million globally ($33million in the United States).|$|E
