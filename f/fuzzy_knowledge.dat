In this paper, we propose a FKM (<b>Fuzzy</b> <b>Knowledge</b> Management) approach to managing <b>fuzzy</b> <b>knowledge</b> through knowledge engineering and fuzzy logic.

The proposed approach consists of two phases: PSO-based <b>fuzzy</b> <b>knowledge</b> encoding, and PSO-based <b>fuzzy</b> <b>knowledge</b> fusion. In the encoding phase, the fuzzy rule sets and fuzzy sets with its corresponding membership functions are encoded as a string and are put together in the initial knowledge population.
