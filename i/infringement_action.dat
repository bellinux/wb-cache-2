40|$|Forum selling” is {{jurisdictional}} competition {{intended to}} attract litigants. While consensual forum selling may be beneficial, non-consensual forum selling is harmful because it encourages jurisdictions {{to adopt an}} inefficient pro-plaintiff bias. In the last 20 years, the Eastern District of Texas has adopted an aggressive and remarkably successful policy of non-consensual forum selling in patent <b>infringement</b> <b>actions.</b> In 2016, 44 % of all patent <b>infringement</b> <b>actions</b> were filed in the Eastern District of Texas, and 93 % of them were filed by patent assertion entities or “patent trolls. ” In December 2016, the Supreme Court granted certiorari in TC Heartland v. Kraft, to consider the definition of corporate residence {{for the purpose of}} patent venue. If the Court adopts the narrow definition suggested by TC Heartland, it would effectively prevent the Eastern District of Texas from engaging in non-consensual forum selling in patent <b>infringement</b> <b>actions.</b> However, it could also unduly restrict patent venue. This Article argues that the Court could stop non-consensual forum selling in patent <b>infringement</b> <b>actions</b> by requiring district courts to decide motions to transfer venue before deciding any other motions or entering any substantive orders. This would prevent non-consensual forum selling by making it impossible for a district to offer bias as a salient incentive to marginal plaintiffs, and it would make litigation more efficient by ensuring that actions reach the appropriate district as quickly as possible...|$|R

Section II discusses the various types of evidence which trademark infringement plaintiffs have proffered in attempting to prove the existence of actual confusion, and the weight which the courts have given to these types of evidence. This section also discusses whose confusion (e. g., consumers, suppliers, competitors) is relevant to and probative of actual confusion, and how much evidence of actual confusion is necessary to have this factor support a finding of a likelihood of confusion. Finally, Section III discusses the evidentiary problems, such as hearsay and other concerns, encountered by those attempting to introduce evidence of actual confusion...|$|R

[...] As there was no dispute over whether Steinberg owned a valid copyright in his image, the only issue to be decided was whether the defendants had copied the image when they created the movie poster. To determine whether the defendants had copied the image, the court turned to circumstantial evidence of access and substantial similarities between the two works. The court found ample evidence of the defendants' access to the copyrighted work; indeed, the defendants admitted at trial that they had used Steinberg’s poster as inspiration for their own. As {{to the question of}} [...] "substantial similarity" [...] between the two works, the court asked [...] "whether an average lay observer would recognize the alleged copy as having been appropriated from the copyrighted work." ...|$|E

The scheme is based on blacklists of known unauthorized content and compromised players, which are maintained by content providers and shipped alongside the content.

Prior to Supreme Court’s decision in eBay v. MercExchange, L. L.

This Article will further examine preliminary injunctions in Hatch-Waxman actions in the District of New Jersey since eBay in 2006 and argue that courts still tacitly apply the irreparable harm presumption...|$|R

Unsurprisingly, the patentee also did not disclose those facts to the PTO or to co-litigants in the <b>infringement</b> <b>actions.</b> The defendants in the second action discovered and presented evidence of the malfeasance, and while the trial court refused dismissal on that ground, on appeal the Sixth Circuit reversed the trial court and remanded for dismissal, and the Supreme Court affirmed.|$|R

Indeed, despite numerous Treaty reforms and several enlargements, this control is still governed by the same principles.

Second, I have proposed several ideas {{in order to improve}} the current situation. One of the main arguments is to suggest a new mechanism able to deal with the lack of transposition of Directives. Furthermore other aspects are explored such as the necessity to include the European Parliament in the control of the application of European law. ...|$|R
