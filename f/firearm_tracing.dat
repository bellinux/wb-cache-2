Under this definition, most, but not all, <b>traced</b> <b>firearms</b> are 'crime guns.'" [...] The CRS report notes certain methodological limits on <b>firearms</b> <b>trace</b> data: (1) <b>traced</b> <b>firearms</b> are generally those recovered by law enforcement, and so [...] "may not be representative of firearms possessed and used by criminals" [...] more generally; (2) [...] "there remains significant variation over time and from jurisdiction to jurisdiction as to 'when, why, and how' a firearm is recovered and selected to be traced"; and (3) [...] "a substantial percentage of recovered firearms cannot be successfully traced for several reasons including poor recordkeeping by FFLs." [...] The ATF describes the <b>firearms</b> <b>trace</b> database as [...] "an operational system designed to aid in ongoing investigations, rather than a system to capture 'crime gun' statistics." [...] Despite these limitations, the CRS report notes [...] "combined with multiple handgun sales reports and other investigative data, <b>firearm</b> <b>trace</b> data have proven to be a viable tool for ATF in targeting regulatory and investigative resources with greater effect." ...|$|R
