40|$|In {{this paper}} we explore large non-faradaic {{contributions}} occurring at individual nanowire electrodes and nanowire array de-vices. We report fabrication of well-defined individual gold nanowires and nanowire arrays at silicon chip substrates via hybrid E-beam/photolithography. Nanowire electrodes and their arrays exhibit good electrical conductivity. We demonstrate highly re-producible sigmoidal, quasi-steady-state voltammograms at nanowire arrays in the model redox probe hexaminoruthenium (III) chloride. We observe large, unexpected contributions in measured non-faradaic or capacitive currents at these nanowire devices. We undertake experimental analysis {{in the absence of}} redox active molecules and demonstrate through finite element simulations, that these increased capacitive signals may be caused by a buildup of charged species at the insulated buried metal <b>interconnection</b> <b>tracks...</b>|$|E
40|$|A {{technique}} {{has been developed}} for the assembly of GaAs MMICs using flip-chip solder bonding. The additional process steps needed to permit solder bonding are compatible with fabrication in the Plessey GaAs MMIC Foundry. Flip-chip bonding allows reproducible, high integrity interconnections {{to be made in}} a single assembly operation, while adding the design freedom of mid-chip connections. The key {{to the success of the}} technology is the provision of a barrier metallisation layer interposed between the solder and the gold bond pads of the MMIC and MIC substrate circuitry. Demonstrator receiver MMICs were designed, fabricated, assembled and tested. The GaAs chip was designed as unconnected building block circuits and the receiver function generated by <b>interconnection</b> <b>tracks</b> on the MIC substrate. Clearly different microwave operating parameters were derived from the same GaAs chip design by altering the MIC design. Selective receiver operation was demonstrated between 2 and 7 GHz, with up to 20 dB conversion gain...|$|E

40|$|Presented at Proceeding of the 2004 American Control Conference Boston. Massachusetts June 30 -July 2, 2004. A {{decentralized}} adaptive output {{feedback control}} design is proposed for large-scale interconnected systems. It is assumed that all the controllers share prior information about the system reference models. A linearly parameterized neural network is introduced for each subsystem to partially cancel {{the effect of the}} <b>interconnections</b> on <b>tracking</b> performance. Boundedness of error signals is shown through Lyapunov's direct method.

40|$|We are {{developing}} a method to build arrays of Ge-based microcalorimeters for soft X-rays detection using micro-photolithographic techniques. A key element of the process is the electrical and thermal connection between the germanium sensors and the <b>interconnection</b> electrical <b>tracks,</b> that lay on a substrate acting as mechanical support and thermal sink. The geometry of the sensors, that have a square base truncated pyramid shape, makes feasible a connection through indium soldering. We describe a technique, based on microlithography and electroplating, adopted to grow indium bumps of a few tens of square microns of area and several microns high {{on top of the}} contact pads patterned on the substrate. The sensor array is placed over the bumps and a subsequent baking melts the indium, soldering the sensors to the pads...|$|R
40|$|The {{quasi-static}} {{mechanical properties}} of Fused Deposition Modelling ABS parts are largely {{influenced by the}} quality of the <b>interconnection</b> between adjacent <b>tracks</b> and layers. During the process, coalescence of the interconnection is obtained through the thermal energy, present in the deposited material. The obtained coalescence is therefore strongly dependent on the temperature of the material and is therefore influenced by many factors related to the production process. However, the process parameters influencing this thermal history are often not monitored. Furthermore, when printing large batches in a single build, {{it is very difficult to}} control the process such that the optimal thermal history is obtained at every location in the build. Moreover, a profound knowledge on the influence of the thermal history on the coalescence of the <b>interconnection</b> between adjacent <b>tracks</b> is still lacking. This research is therefore aimed at investigating the influence between the inter-layer cooling time, i. e. the time between de deposition of two consecutive layers, and the resulting quasi-static mechanical properties, because this the latter is an important factor contributing to the temperature of the material at the moment of deposition of the next layer. Uniaxial test samples are built considering the build orientation and the number of parts in the envelope, in order to influence this inter-layer cooling time. Tensile tests are performed and the fracture surfaces are investigated using digital microscopy. status: publishe...|$|R
40|$|A {{decentralized}} {{adaptive control}} design procedure for large-scale uncertain systems is developed using single hidden layer neural networks. The subsystems {{are assumed to}} be feedback linearizable and non-a#ne in the control, and their interconnections bounded linearly by the tracking error norms. Single hidden layer neural networks are introduced to approximate the feedback linearization error signal online from available measurements. A robust adaptive signal is required in the analysis to shield the feedback linearizing control law from the <b>interconnection</b> e#ects. The <b>tracking</b> errors are shown to be uniformly ultimately bounded, and all other signals uniformly bounded. The proposed adaptive algorithm is implemented in simulation to stabilize an interconnected double inverted pendulum. ...|$|R
40|$|The total dose {{effects and}} SEEs of RT 54 SX, a new {{radiation}} tolerant antifuse FPGA family, are presented. This device family employs a metal-to-metal antifuse technology and a sea-of-modules architecture. Devices manufactured by both 0. 6 µm and 0. 25 µm technology levels are tested. The devices demonstrate the total dose tolerance better than 100 krad(Si). They are SEL and SEDR immune. For SEU, 0. 6 µm has LETth of 12 MeV-cm 2 /mg and {{cross section of}} 2 x 10 - 6 cm 2, and 0. 25 µm has a lower LETth but approximately the same cross section. Total dose hardening and SEU hardening are also investigated. I. RT 54 SX The RT 54 SX family is the subset of the Actel 54 SX family of products. It has enhanced radiation performance for total dose effects and SEEs (single event effects). The present RT 54 SX family uses 0. 6 and 0. 25 µm CMOS technologies. The power supply compatibility for 0. 6 µm is 3. 3 / 5. 0 V, and for 0. 25 µm is 2. 5 / 3. 3 / 5. 0 V. A brief introduction of the 54 SX device is presented in this section. A. Architecture and Basic Logic Modules Figure 1 shows the “Sea-of-Module ” architecture of the device. The logic module tiles are built underneath the <b>interconnection</b> routing <b>tracks.</b> Compared to the channeled architecture employed in the ONO antifuse FPGA, the area is drastically reduced. The reduction in area improves both the cost and performance...|$|R
40|$|The {{quasi-static}} {{and fatigue}} properties of Fused Deposition Modelling ABS parts are largely {{influenced by the}} quality of the <b>interconnection</b> between adjacent <b>tracks</b> and layers. During this process, coalescence of the interconnection is obtained through he thermal energy of the deposited material and build environment and is strongly influenced by many factors related to the production process. However, the process parameters influencing this thermal history are often not monitored. Furthermore, when printing large batches in a single build, it is often impossible to control the process such that the optimal thermal history is obtained at every location in the build. Therefore, any designer has {{to take into account the}} inherent product variability resulting from the local and time-dependent variations in the production process. This work focuses on the identification of the variation that is caused in the mechanical behaviour, more specifically in the quasi-static and fatigue properties of the final component. The variability in material properties between different identical components (inter-variability) is identified based on measurements on a sample population, and related to the production process. status: publishe...|$|R
