50|$|In 1690-1790 the <b>freemen</b> of {{the three}} {{remaining}} boroughs were entitled to vote.

The electorate increased to about 500 in the 1754-1790 period.|$|R

5|$|Fleming and {{the judge}} {{who presided over the}} trial each spoke with her; both argued that they did not deserve blame for the lynching. A schoolteacher who had known Washington told <b>Freeman</b> that Washington was illiterate, and that all {{attempts}} to teach him to read had been futile. <b>Freeman</b> concluded that white residents were generally supportive of Washington's lynching, although many disliked that his body was mutilated. She determined that the mob was led by a bricklayer, a saloonkeeper, and several employees of an ice company. The NAACP did not publicly identify them. <b>Freeman</b> concluded that Washington killed Fryer, and that he was motivated by her domineering attitude towards him.|$|E

5000|$|The {{right to}} vote was {{exercised}} by the <b>freemen</b> of the borough. Originally, these <b>freemen</b> could vote {{even if they did}} not live in the borough, and at times this was abused as elsewhere, notably in 1670 when 500 non-resident <b>freemen</b> were created to swamp the resident voters. From 1709, however, by a resolution of the House of Commons, the franchise was restricted to resident <b>freemen</b> who were not receiving alms. By the 19th century, the maximum number of <b>freemen</b> had been set at 32, of whom the two [...] "patrons", Lord Huntingfield and Snowdon Barne, could nominate eight each, so that between them they controlled half of the votes and needed only one other voter to gain control of elections.|$|R

5000|$|Originally, each Stray was {{controlled}} and managed by Pasture Masters for the exclusive {{benefit of the}} <b>Freemen</b> resident in their Ward. In 1905, the City took over Micklegate Stray, and in 1907 an Act of Parliament extinguished the Freemen's rights over it {{in exchange for the}} payment of an annual sum of money. In 1947, the City approached the Pasture Masters of the other three Strays with a view to making similar arrangements in their cases. Agreements were signed with the <b>Freemen</b> of Bootham Ward in that year, with the <b>Freemen</b> of Walmgate Ward in 1948 and with the <b>Freemen</b> of Monk Ward in 1958. In each case, the <b>Freemen</b> agreed that, in exchange for a small annual payment to them, the City should in future administer their Stray [...] "as an open space for the benefit and enjoyment of the citizens of York for all time". Currently, the Pasture Masters are elected annually by the <b>Freemen</b> of their Wards, and are consulted by the City about major changes of usage. Their permission has to be obtained if the City wishes to erect any building on their Stray other than those intended for the recreation or convenience of the public (sports pavilions, public lavatories, etc.). In 1995, payments were still being made to <b>Freemen</b> of Micklegate Ward and their widows, but payments to <b>Freemen</b> of the other Wards had ceased.|$|R

50|$|Before {{parliamentary}} {{reform in}} 1832, {{freedom of the}} city or town conferred {{the right to vote}} in the 'parliamentary boroughs' for the MPs. Until the Municipal Corporations Act 1835 the <b>freemen</b> were the exclusive electorate for some of the boroughs. These two acts together curtailed the power of the <b>freemen</b> and extended the franchise to all 'householders' (defined as local rate payers; in fact therefore property owners). The private property belonging to the <b>freemen</b> collectively was retained. The <b>freemen</b> of York, Oxford and Newcastle upon Tyne still own considerable areas within their towns, although the income is effectively given to support charitable objects. The Local Government Act 1972 specifically preserved freemen's rights. The Local Democracy, Economic Development and Construction Act 2009 removed any restrictions entitling only men to be <b>freemen.</b>|$|R

As <b>Freeman</b> escapes the city, Civil Protection units raid the resistance base of Black Mesa East and capture resistance leader Eli Vance, who is transferred to holding facilities at Nova Prospekt. <b>Freeman</b> and Vance's daughter Alyx break into the facility to rescue him, but Eli Vance is teleported to the Combine Citadel by double agent Judith Mossman. However, the strike against Nova Prospekt is seen as the start of a revolution by the citizens of Earth, who take up arms against the Combine. In response, Combine Overwatch are deployed to City 17, and heavy street fighting takes place. <b>Freeman</b> manages to infiltrate the Citadel but is captured and taken to Breen. Mossman allows <b>Freeman</b> to break free of his captivity, and Breen flees to the Citadel's trans-dimensional teleporter, intent on escape. However, <b>Freeman</b> destroys the teleporter's reactor before Breen can escape, causing a large explosion that destroys the top of the Citadel.|$|E
