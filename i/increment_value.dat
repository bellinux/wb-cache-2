In an attempt to examine the variables which control titration, an interlocking progressive-ratio schedule was devised. Under an interlocking progressive-ratio schedule, the number of responses required for reinforcement increases by a constant (the <b>increment</b> <b>value)</b> after every ratio, but during each ratio the response requirement can be lowered (the decrement value) by emitting pauses of a specified duration (the stepdown duration). The first experiment sought to determine if children would titrate when exposed to interlocking progressive-ratio schedules.

Experiment 2 was conducted {{to determine the effects of}} a series of <b>increment</b> <b>value</b> manipulations on the level of titration.

In Experiment 3 the effects of a series of decrement manipulations on titration level were examined. The decrement manipulations were investigated under two increment values. The results indicated that as the decrement value was decreased the titration level tended to increase under both increment conditions. In all of the experiments, rate of responding, pausing, titration variability, and patterns of responding were examined. Generally rate of responding, pausing, and response patterning were found to be related to changes in increment and decrement values. Titration variability showed no systematic changes across manipulations. Analysis of subjects 2 ̆ 7 behavior in terms of preference indicated that the subjects tended to minimize number of responses rather than maximize reinforcement frequency.

The quantitative evaluation on the <b>value</b> <b>increment</b> of each section of a production process could propose an objective criterion to describe the contribution of a section on a value chain, and could also provide an important evidence for distributing resources more reasonably. In this paper, a quantitative model is proposed to calculate the <b>value</b> <b>increment</b> of each section. An index system is also presented, which includes all the main factors influencing on <b>value</b> <b>increment</b> in a production activity.
