He said, [...] "If we do a verse two or three times, we're already bored with it. So we weren't {{trying to make the}} songs shorter—that's <b>just</b> <b>what</b> <b>we</b> were into," [...] which resulted in the album's short duration of 29 minutes. King had stated that while hour-long records seem to be the trend, [...] "ou could lose this part; you could cut this song completely, and make a much more intense record, which is what we're all about." [...] When the record was completed, the band met with Rubin, who asked: [...] "Do you realize how short this is?" [...] Slayer members looked at each other, and replied: [...] "So what?" [...] The entire album was on one side of a cassette; King stated it was [...] "neat," [...] as [...] "You could listen to it, flip it over, and play it again."

[...] Scott Juba of The Trades rated the song with A, and wrote: [...] "As far as the band's single, 'Everybody's Fool', is concerned, it is a song about the stinging betrayal of deception and the refusal to become blinded by deceit any longer. There is a defiance in Lee's voice that gives the track a bold edge, and the song's heavy drums and soaring guitars further enhance the strong sound. The band surely has another chart topping hit on their hands." [...] Simon Cusens of ABC Online gave the song 3 out of 5 stars calling it [...] "a cold, sad and angry song that I would only like to listen to without it being repeated again." [...] Joe D'Angelo of MTV News wrote that [...] "rolling acoustic guitar and billowing synthesizers {{pave the way for}} the harsh power chords that open the song" [...] adding that Lee's voice was [...] "disembodied" [...] in the opening lines [...] "Perfect by nature/ Icons of self-indulgence/ <b>Just</b> <b>what</b> <b>we</b> all need/ More lies about a world that/ Never was and never will be." ...|$|E

500|$|The {{season is}} {{structured}} into three [...] "pods" [...] {{based on its}} airing schedule: the first eight episodes, subtitled Ghost Rider; LMD (Life Model Decoy) for the subsequent seven episodes; and a third pod for the final seven episodes called Agents of Hydra. Elements and characters cross over between the different pods, but the sections [...] "definitely have a different feel" [...] from one another, as Tancharoen explained that 22 episodes [...] "is {{a long time to}} hold a big bad or a single plot line, especially for an audience", and for the past two seasons, the series was able to have two separated halves that [...] "allows us to introduce a big bad. And then, something happens and we rise somebody new ... Now, there's three of those." [...] "Financial considerations" [...] were also taken into account in creating the pods for the season, as using LMDs does not [...] "cost as much as setting a guy's head on fire via CGI". In terms of writing the [...] "complicated season", Whedon said the writers were [...] "aware that our fans are our fans and have spent some time with these characters and are clever and see things coming sometimes ... Part of our job is to create not <b>just</b> <b>what</b> <b>we</b> are presenting on plot, but letting the audience be one step ahead of us and being one step ahead of that." [...] He added that the writers knew that they wanted to tell a Ghost Rider story, an LMD story, and a [...] "what if" [...] scenario, and the hardest part was making each pod still fit together as a single season. The major connection ultimately became the Darkhold, which leads from the magic of Ghost Rider to the advanced science of LMD and then the Framework in Agents of Hydra. Ghost Rider also reappears in the final episode of the season, [...] "World's End", as an additional connection.|$|E

[...] Grossmith had appeared in charity performances of Trial by Jury, where both Sullivan and Gilbert had seen him (indeed, Gilbert had directed one such performance, in which Grossmith played the judge), and Gilbert had earlier commented favourably on his performance in Tom Robertson's Society at the Gallery of Illustration.

Daniel Wilcox of 411mania.com described the song as [...] "a sassy and soulful number {{along the lines of}} Amy Winehouse's bigger singles, only more powerful and sexy, and that much more vocally impressive". Digital Spy music editor Nick Levine wrote that [...] "Mama Do (Uh Oh, Uh Oh)" [...] "is a soulful slice of retro-pop that lands somewhere between the realms of Duffy and Natasha Bedingfield". In a positive review for the BBC Chart Blog, Fraser McAlpine commented that the song [...] "is mined from the same gently retro school of blues that guided Duffy to all those Brit awards earlier in the year".

2500|$|Seward's {{reply was}} [...] "a long, highly {{political}} document." [...] Seward stated that Wilkes had acted {{on his own}} and denied allegations by the British that the seizure itself had been conducted in a discourteous and violent manner. [...] The capture and search of Trent was consistent with international law, and Wilkes' only error was in failing to take Trent to a port for judicial determination. [...] The release of the prisoners was therefore required in order [...] "to do to the British nation <b>just</b> <b>what</b> <b>we</b> have always insisted all nations ought to do to us." [...] Seward's reply, in effect, accepted Wilkes' treatment of the prisoners as contraband and also equated their capture with the British exercise of impressment of British citizens off of neutral ships. This response contradicted itself in a number of ways. Citing the precedent of impressment implied that Mason and Slidell had been removed for their status as American nationals, rather than as contraband; it was a reversal of America's previous position on the topic, referred to a right the British had not exercised for half a century, and—as Mason and Slidell were taken prisoner rather than being conscripted into the navy—was irrelevant to the case. More fundamentally, Seward's stance assumed that a state of war was in effect: otherwise, Federal warships would have had no legal status as belligerents with the right of search. However, {{at the time of the}} Trent Affair, the North was not only refusing to acknowledge a state of war, but was still demanding that the British government withdraw its recognition of Confederate belligerency in the form of the Proclamation of Neutrality.|$|E
