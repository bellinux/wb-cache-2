5|$|Playford {{had begun}} {{experiencing}} {{serious health problems}} since his first heart attack in June 1971, and underwent treatment and procedures for ten years. On 16 June 1981, he experienced a massive heart attack and died. Two days later his memorial service {{was held at the}} Flinders Street Baptist Church. The funeral procession carried his coffin from the city, along Magill and Old Norton Summit Roads where thousands turned out to pay their respects, to the Norton Summit cemetery where his forebears had been buried. There his gravestone was emblazoned with the phrase: 'a <b>good</b> <b>man</b> who did good things'.|$|E
5|$|Written by Gareth Roberts. Before {{settling}} {{upon the}} storyline {{that would become}} The Lodger, Roberts initially developed a different storyline for the 2010 series which would have featured a disgraced Sontaran called Strom. This idea reached draft stage before being abandoned altogether. However the idea of Strom was later recycled into Sontaran Commander Strax, who first appeared in A <b>Good</b> <b>Man</b> Goes to War and became a recurring character.|$|E
5|$|The court enmities {{provoked}} by his twenty years unbroken intimacy and influence with the king, and the denigration of less gifted or less fortunate soldiers, followed him in death. Prince William expressed {{the bitterness of}} his hatred in almost his last words, and Prince Henry's memoirs give a wholly incredible portrait of Winterfeldt's arrogance, dishonesty, immorality and incapacity. Frederick, however, was not apt to encourage incompetence in his most trusted officers, {{and as for the}} rest, Winterfeldt stood first among the very few to whom the king gave his friendship and his entire confidence. On hearing of Winterfeldt's death, he said, I will never ever find again another Winterfeldt,and a little later, He was a <b>good</b> <b>man,</b> a soulful man; he was my friend. Winterfeldt's strength was thinking and acting strategically.|$|E

5|$|The first subplot {{involves}} the courtship of Mary Lowther, {{a childhood friend}} of the vicar's wife. Harry Gilmore, a Bullhampton squire {{and a friend of}} the Fenwicks, falls deeply in love with her. Mary recognises that Gilmore is a <b>good</b> <b>man,</b> but she fears that she does not adore him as a woman should adore the man she marries. The Fenwicks and her guardian aunt all urge her to accept his proposal, telling her that the affection she does not now feel will come after marriage. In the face of this advice, she does not reject Gilmore outright, but asks for time to consider.|$|E

60|$|I mention them, {{because they}} were <b>good</b> <b>men.</b> And why were they <b>good</b> <b>men?</b> For any <b>good</b> works of their own? Not in the least. What made them <b>good</b> <b>men</b> was, just the having the humble and the contrite heart; just feeling that in {{themselves}} they were {{as bad as the}} sinners round them; that the only thing which kept them out of the idolatry and profligacy of their neighbours was confessing their own weakness, and clinging fast to God by faith; confessing that their own righteousness was as filthy rags, and that God must clothe them with his righteousness.|$|R

25|$|You're a <b>Good</b> <b>Man,</b> Charlie Brown is a 1967 {{musical comedy}} {{with music and}} lyrics by Clark Gesner, based on the {{characters}} created by cartoonist Charles M.

25|$|Then the debaters {{return to}} their {{previous}} analysis of Pittacus' and Simonides' poetry. On Socrates' interpretation, Pittacus claims {{that it is difficult}} to be a <b>good</b> <b>man,</b> but presumably possible. Simonides, on the other hand, claims that it is impossible to live without ever being a bad man, and even to be a <b>good</b> <b>man</b> on occasion is difficult (344a45d). Simonides praises those who at least do not do wrong willingly. Socrates' interpretation is that, since Simonides was a wise man, he must know that no one does any wrong willingly; accordingly, he must mean that he will willingly praise those who do no wrong, not that some do wrong willingly and others unwillingly, only the latter garnering his praise (345d46b). Socrates thus argues that the authority of Simonides does not stand against his understanding of virtue and whether anyone willingly does wrong.|$|E

25|$|The {{father of}} the Fowler family, Arthur was {{essentially}} a <b>good</b> <b>man,</b> but he made some foolish choices and he always ended up paying dearly for them, also being bossed {{to the brink of}} insanity by his mother-in-law and wife, Lou Beale (Anna Wing) and Pauline Fowler (Wendy Richard). During his time in Albert Square he had an affair with another woman, suffered with mental disorder, was sent to prison twice and eventually died of a brain haemorrhage in 1996.|$|E

At a welcoming party thrown in his honor, Rachel crossed paths with wealthy publisher, Mac Cory (Douglass Watson). Originally, Mac was a love interest for Liz Matthews, but Lemay noticed the chemistry between Watson and Wyndham and wrote a love story for them. Fearing backlash from viewers who may have found an older man-younger woman relationship tasteless, Lemay penned chance encounters for the two characters, which led to innocent yet intimate conversations.|$|E
