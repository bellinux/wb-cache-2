6000|$|... "Tell me first," [...] said Louisa, in {{her most}} prosy, most matter of fact tone of voice, [...] "all that is <b>known</b> <b>about</b> <b>your</b> uncle Arthur." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "You {{looked very}} nice," [...] he said, slowly, {{as he led}} the way down the street. [...] "Of course, I <b>knew</b> <b>about</b> <b>your</b> singing, but {{everything}} else--seemed such a surprise." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{think she}} told me all that she <b>knew</b> <b>about</b> <b>your</b> father's ruin, and his death. It {{was very hard to}} listen to, Jimmy--but did it really happen that way?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "And I'll {{tell what}} I <b>know</b> <b>about</b> <b>your</b> sneaking {{in and out}} of the dormitories at night," [...] added Paxton. And then he and Coulter went off together.|$|E
6000|$|... "That's a {{precious}} odd thing," [...] he went on, [...] "that you {{showed me the}} other day, don't you <b>know,</b> <b>about</b> <b>your</b> signature and Cyril's being so absolutely identical." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I'd like to {{know one}} other thing," [...] went on Andy, and now his face showed a slight grin. [...] "What do you <b>know</b> <b>about</b> <b>your</b> Uncle Jarley's auto running away by itself?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "It was talked about," [...] Mr. Watkins answered. [...] "We {{decided it}} wouldn't be {{in keeping with}} what we <b>knew</b> <b>about</b> <b>your</b> character, and you'd {{certainly}} be sorry you had done it afterward." ...|$|R

6000|$|... "All {{the while}} we've been playing cards--and playing the still more {{dangerous}} game of being married--I've been thinking how glad I am to <b>know</b> <b>about</b> <b>your</b> life. Somehow----I {{wonder if you}} have told so very many?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... “I {{might also}} tell you a {{thousand}} lies. What do I <b>know</b> <b>about</b> <b>your</b> tears? I am not a susceptible idiot. It all depends upon the cause. There are tears of quiet happiness. Peeling onions also will bring tears.” ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I don't <b>know</b> <b>about</b> <b>your</b> nice time, but I {{feel pretty}} certain of my own. How do you know--Oh, do get up, you implacable cripple!" [...] {{he broke off}} to the lame mare he was driving, and pulled at the reins.|$|E

6000|$|... "Nobody in the {{neighborhood}} would let you have a cottage. You might get a laborer's job in the town, but {{you would have to}} work hard, and I don't <b>know</b> <b>about</b> <b>your</b> father. He's rheumatic and old. None of the farmers would engage you." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Excuse the liberty. I believe I have a {{right to}} inspect all correspondence," [...] {{observed}} Shackleby, coolly leaning over and picking up the message.

6000|$|... "I own I {{was helped}} by {{inquiries}} about your habits," [...] said the doctor, smiling. [...] "If {{you like a}} game, try pool, with boys like yourself, and bet fifty cents.

6000|$|... "Well then, Margaret, look here. I want to <b>know</b> {{something}} <b>about</b> <b>your</b> brother's affairs. From what I have heard, I {{fear they}} were not very good." ...|$|R

6000|$|Capt. G. Thanks. I say, Pussy, I don't <b>know</b> much <b>about</b> <b>your</b> {{religious}} beliefs. You {{were brought}} up to believe in a heaven and all that, weren't you? ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I don't <b>know</b> <b>about</b> <b>your</b> storms here, Captain; {{but if it}} were in the Levant I {{should get}} every stitch of canvas off her {{excepting}} closely- reefed topsails, a storm jib, and fore stay-sail. The first burst over, one can always shake out more canvas. However, you know these seas, and I do not." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Walk with me, Beric," [...] he said. [...] "For {{three hours}} I {{have been going}} into {{the affairs of the}} city, and hearing letters read from the {{governors}} of the provinces. It will be a change to talk of other things. Tell me about this Britain of yours. I <b>know</b> <b>about</b> <b>your</b> wars, tell me of your life at home." ...|$|E
6000|$|... “And elusive,” {{struck in}} Mills {{in a low}} voice. “Some of them are like that. She will never change. Amid all the shames and shadows of that life there will always lie the ray of her perfect honesty. I don’t <b>know</b> <b>about</b> <b>your</b> honesty, but yours will be the easier lot.

6000|$|... 'YOUR meaning exactly, you brazen scarecrow,--what's your meaning?' {{retorted}} Quilp. 'Why do {{you talk}} to me of combining together? Do I combine? Do I <b>know</b> anything <b>about</b> <b>your</b> combinings?' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "This is cool, however!" [...] exclaimed Mr. Yorke. [...] "What right {{have you}} to reckon {{on me to}} provide for your {{dismissed}} workmen? What do I <b>know</b> <b>about</b> <b>your</b> Farrens and your Williams? I've heard he's an honest man, but am I to support all the honest men in Yorkshire? You may say that would be no great charge to undertake; but great or little, I'll none of it." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Impossible! Nothing {{should be}} impossible. All {{the people that}} one hears of that are really true to their loves never find {{anything}} impossible. Does he love me, Miss Carbury? It all depends on that. That's what I want to know.' She paused, but Hetta could not answer the question. 'You must <b>know</b> <b>about</b> <b>your</b> brother.

5000|$|... "The {{creative}} urge matters. Stories matter. Images matter. It {{matters that}} you were born with a genius, a guiding spirit, a daimon that may <b>know</b> more <b>about</b> <b>your</b> destiny than you do." ...|$|R
6000|$|Carmen firmly {{brought him}} back to the subject. [...] "Do you <b>know</b> much <b>about</b> <b>your</b> partner's relatives? It's obvious that he belongs to a good family. However, you'll have him with you." ...|$|R
