Abstract Earth block walling has the lowest environmental impacts of any masonry material. Its embodied carbon dioxide can be one tenth that of fired bricks or autoclaved blocks. It can be recycled and locally made with limited technology thus reducing {{the environmental impacts of}} transport. Earth blocks can be made from waste earth produced as a by-product of other construction activities. The particular advantage of earth block walling over other earth construction methods, lies in the prefabrication of the masonry units. The production process is less weather dependent and the blocks are <b>fully</b> <b>shrunk</b> so that dimensional changes in the completed walls are less severe. Blocks can be pre-tested for strength and durability prior to their inclusion in the building. This gives greater certainty in design. Earth block walling has the potential to replace conventional masonry in a significant proportion of UK dwellings. This thesis examines earth block walling from a practitioner's point of view. From design through to block production and site construction, it considers the obstacles to its wider use. It emphasises the cost penalties of earth block walling, believed to be the principal reason for its decline and its limited revival. It examines options for earth block production through case studies of earth block producers in France, the USA and the UK and assesses their potential for reducing production costs Earth mortars are also assessed and tested for strength. The cost savings of earth slurry mortars are considered both in terms of the speed of construction and the possibilities for reducing the thickness of walls by utilising the higher flexural bond strengtiis available with slurry mortars. Earth slurry mortars are tested for flexural bond strength. The results indicate that slurry mortars can offer considerable improvements in flexural bond strength particularly where the mortar is reinforced. Through these improvements in flexural strength comes the possibility of reducing the overall wall thickness which could offer significant cost savings over thick joint techniques using earth lime and cement mortars. Earthen codes current in the USA and France are reviewed and compared with UK Building Regulations and masonry design codes to identify the additional costs associated with earth design in the UK. It concludes that the absence of a specific earthen code in the UK is a major obstacle to the revival of earth as a contemporary construction material. This thesis wresties with the dilemma of whether earth blocks should be produced on a local, small scale, using limited technology, thereby maximising the enviroimiental benefits; or whether the commercial benefits of mass production can offer economic viability without compromising the environmental advantages. It finds that the argument turns on the question of transportation and the distance between the production facility and the site of use. This thesis identifies the principal obstacles to the wider use of earth block walling. It emphasises the high cost of earth block constraction and the limited scope for reducing these costs down to that of conventional masonry. It identifies a need for greater fiscal and regulatory mtervention to tip the economic balance in favour of natural, low carbon materials such as earth block. It quantifies the environmental benefits of earth block wallmg and sets these against the additional costs involved...|$|E

Compacted soil specimens were allowed to swell and either <b>shrank</b> <b>fully</b> or partially <b>shrank</b> to several predetermined heights in each cycle. The tests {{were carried out}} at a surcharge pressure of 50 kPa. The test results revealed that shrinkage of compacted saturated soil specimens to predetermined height in each shrinkage cycle provides similar conditions {{as that of the}} controlled suction tests with an increasing number of swell–shrink cycles. The water content of soil specimens and hence soil suction was found to remain nearly constant for each pattern of shrinkage. For soil specimens equilibrated to a given swell–shrink pattern, suction at the end of shrinkage cycles was changed from a higher suction to a lower suction, and also from a lower to a higher suction. The experimental results showed that there may be an immediate equilibrium state attained by the soil in terms of swell–shrink potential if suction at the shrinkage cycles was less than the past suction; otherwise, the equilibrium state was accompanied by fatigue of swelling. The volumetric deformation of the soil specimen subjected greater shrinkage was found to be much larger than the corresponding vertical deformation. The compressibility index of microstructure, κm, was determined for several shrinkage patterns. It is shown that κm is heavily influenced by suction at the end of shrinkage cycles...|$|R

50|$|Establishment of land banks could {{increase}} land values and tax revenues for further innovation of the shrinking cities. Nevertheless, The process of acquiring foreclosures can be troublesome as “it may require involvement {{on the part}} of several jurisdictions to obtain clear title,” which is necessary for redevelopment. Economic problems that local residents have, including income disparities between local residents, cannot be solved by the land bank, with the addition of increasing rents and land values led by the revitalization of vacant land. Local leaders also lack the authority to interrupt works that Land Banks do. Environmental justice problems that are from previous polluting industry may not be <b>fully</b> addressed through <b>shrinking</b> city intervention and without opinions from local people. Therefore, a new approach of dealing with these vacant lots will be to work with non-profit local community groups to construct more green open spaces among the declining neighborhoods to reduce vacant lots and create strong community commitments.|$|R

In this work, evidence for an additional factor is provided; a physical effect that occurs during the drying of the hydrothermally treated calcined material due to the intense capillary stress exerted in water. Depending on both physical (i. e. mechanical) and chemical (i. e. hydrolysis) resistances, the structure undergoes differently. Three MCM- 41 samples with different degree of condensation were investigated. The most remarkable results are found with un-aged TEOS based material, which gets <b>fully</b> disordered and <b>shrunk</b> for all applied hydrothermal temperatures in water. Comparison between water and a low-surface-tension-solvent drying revealed that capillarity is responsible for the loss of ordering (and shrinkage) at moderate hydrothermal temperatures. The material's structure is hexagonal and shrinkage-free under the low-surface-tension-solvent route. At a high hydrothermal temperature, hydrolysis is extensive and responsible for the loss of ordering. The other remarkable finding regards the aged MCM- 41 meso-structure that maintains the hexagonal features at all applied temperatures in water, and it is more stable against capillarity at high temperature. The Na-metasilicate based material is mechanically very stable and gets disordered at high temperature due to hydrolysis. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved...|$|R
40|$|AbstractThe {{coat protein}} of tobacco mosaic virus {{is known to}} form three {{different}} classes of aggregate, depending on environmental conditions, namely helical, disk, and A-protein. Among the disk aggregates, there are four-layer, six-layer, and long stacks, which {{can be obtained by}} varying the ionic strength and temperature conditions during the association process. The four-layer aggregate has been crystallized, and its structure solved to atomic resolution. The stacked disk aggregate had been presumed to be built of a polar two-layer disk related to the crystalline A and B rings. A study using monoclonal antibodies specific to the bottom surface of TMV protein demonstrated that the stacked disk aggregate is bipolar, and suggested that the repeating two-layer unit might be similar to the dihedrally symmetrical A-ring pair in the disk crystal. In this paper we present a three-dimensional reconstruction of the stacked disk aggregate obtained by electron microscopy of ice-embedded samples. After modeling of the structure, we found the ring pairs to have the same quaternary structure as the A-ring pair of the four-layer aggregate. The resolution achieved in the image processing of the electron micrographs is on the order of 9 Å in the meridional direction and 12 Å in the equatorial. The identification {{of the structure of the}} stacked disk with the A-ring pair of the disk crystal provides an explanation of the observation that the axial periodicity of the disk pair, which is ∼ 53 Å when <b>fully</b> hydrated, can <b>shrink</b> to ∼ 43 Å in the dry state...|$|R
