5000|$|An {{enteric coating}} is a polymer barrier applied on oral {{medication}} that prevents its dissolution or disintegration in the gastric environment. This helps by either protecting drugs from the acidity of the stomach, the stomach from the detrimental {{effects of the}} drug, or to release the drug after the stomach (usually in the upper tract of the intestine). Some drugs are unstable at the acid gastric pH, {{and need to be}} protected from degradation. Enteric coating is also an effective method to obtain drug targeting (such as <b>gastro-resistant</b> drugs). Other drugs such as some anthelmintics may need to reach a high concentration in a specific part of the intestine. Enteric coating may also be used during studies as a research tool to determine drug absorption. Enteric coated medications pertain to the [...] "delayed action" [...] dosage form category. From a pharmacological point of view the term [...] "enteric coating" [...] is not entirely correct, as gastric resistance can be also obtained by adding enteric polymeric systems to the matrix of the dosage form. Tablets, mini-tablets, pellets and granules (usually filled into capsule shells) are the most common enteric-coated dosage forms.|$|E

The pellets formation was accompanied by analysis of morphological parameters and didanosine dissolution. In the most cases, pellets showed diameter around 1. 0 mm and shape parameters acceptable. The variations of the process did not interfere significantly in pellets size. In turn, drying in fluid bed favored the dissolution of didanosine, in contrast to binder addition on powder form that impaired. In another hand, this last resulted in the best aspect factor (about 1. 1). <b>Gastro-resistant</b> pellets showed adequate dissolution, compatible with this type of dosage form.

30|$|Polymeric-coated {{compounds}} {{can resist}} gastric degradation and reduce GI symptoms provoked by acid sensitive compounds, such as NaHCO 3 [15]. Hydroxypropyl methylcellulose, contained in delayed-release capsules, can resist degradation in acidic environments (pH ~[*] 1 – 2 arbitrary units (AU)), and therefore, provides <b>gastro-resistant</b> properties. Instead, degradation {{occurs in the}} duodenum where the pH is far more alkaline (pH ~[*] 6 – 7 [*]AU) and absorption can take place rapidly. Since GI distress is partly attributable to degradation in the stomach [8], {{it has been suggested}} that <b>gastro-resistant</b> capsules may alleviate symptoms that are typical with NaHCO 3 ingestion [16]. Given that less bicarbonate is lost in the stomach, it has also been suggested that smaller doses may produce comparable acid-base changes to larger doses [16]. In contrast, as gut transit time is reduced with <b>gastro-resistant</b> formulations [15], this may reduce bicarbonate bioavailability when administered in this form. No study to date has examined the use of delayed-release NaHCO 3 on markers of GI distress, nor on bicarbonate bioavailability and subsequent blood acid-base responses. Reducing GI distress following NaHCO 3 ingestion may enhance use by athletes, particularly among those who are deterred by potential side-effects.|$|E

30|$|This is {{the first}} study to {{investigate}} the effects of <b>gastro-resistant</b> capsules on GI distress, bicarbonate bioavailability and subsequent acid-base responses following NaHCO 3 ingestion. The main finding was that delayed-release NaHCO 3 mitigated GI distress, as hypothesised. Fewer GI symptoms (~[*] 45.1 %) were reported with the delayed-release capsules, and the overall severity was reduced (~[*] 47.1 %) {{when compared to the}} aqueous solution. Interestingly, reductions in GI symptoms were due to gastric but not intestinal symptoms, a finding that has been suggested in the relevant literature [15]. Gastrointestinal symptoms were negated with the delayed-release capsules, with a reduction in the most severe symptom experienced up to 3 [*]h following supplementation (Table  1). Given that GI symptoms may be ergolytic [13, 14, 26], delayed-release NaHCO 3 may be more ergogenic in those who experience severe GI distress with the aqueous solution. Furthermore, since GI distress may deter some individuals from using NaHCO 3 as an ergogenic aid [7, 10], delayed-release NaHCO 3 would appear to be a more favourable option for athletes and coaches.|$|E
40|$|Abstract: This paper {{present a}} tandem technique, {{based on the}} {{combination}} of prilling and microwave (MW) assisted treatments, to produce biodegradable alginate carriers of piroxicam with different drug controlled release behaviour. Results showed that alginate/piroxicam beads demonstrated high encapsulation efficiency and very narrow dimensional distribution. Beads dried by MW retained shape and size distribution of the hydrated particles while drying rate was strongly increased compared to convective drying processes. Moreover, different MW irradiation regimes promoted interactions between the drug and alginate matrix, affected drug polymorphism as well as inner and surface matrix structure leading to different piroxicam release profiles. High level MW irradiation led to beads with highly porous and swellable matrix able to release piroxicam in few minutes in the intestine while convective drying produced <b>gastro-resistant</b> beads that exhibit sustained piroxicam release (total release in 5. 5 hours) in intestinal environment.

The MSKE-loaded pectinate beads were prepared using ionotropic gelation with varying pectin-to-MSKE ratios, MSKE concentrations, and concentrations of two cross-linkers (calcium chloride and zinc acetate). The formulated beads were spherical in shape and ranged in size between 1. 13 mm and 1. 88 mm. Zinc-pectinate (ZPG) beads containing high amounts of MSKE showed complete entrapment efficiency (EE) of MSKE (100 %), while calcium-pectinate (CPG) beads demonstrated 70 % EE. The in vitro release tests indicated that MSKE-loaded CPG beads were unstable in both simulated gastric medium (SGM) and simulated intestinal medium (SIM), while MSKE-loaded ZPG beads were stable in SIM but unable to prevent the release of MSKE in SGM. The protection of ZPG beads with <b>gastro-resistant</b> capsules (Eudragit® L 100 - 55) resulted in stability in both SGM and SIM; they disintegrated immediately in simulated colonic medium containing pectinolytic enzymes.

To counteract morning symptoms of early morning pathologies, a drug delivery system able to delay ketoprofen release after oral administration has been proposed. Particles made of a pectin matrix were produced by means of prilling; core-shell systems were produced covering the drug particles with Eudragit S 100 ®. The systems developed, containing different drug/polymer ratios, were fully characterized in terms of drug content, efficiency of encapsulation, morphology and drug release kinetics. The results indicated that the loading of larger amounts of drug in the feed solution led to spherical and mono-disperse beads, with high encapsulation efficiency and a reduced drug delivery in gastric simulated fluids (22 %).

The release profiles of five of these commercial formulations were evaluated in bicarbonate buffer using a novel dissolution model that mimics the dynamic conditions of the gastrointestinal tract. Monolithic and multi-particulate mesalazine formulations with pH-dependent and/or independent release mechanisms were evaluated (Asacol® 800, Octasa®, Mezavant® XL, Salofalk®, Pentasa®), and each of the products displayed a distinctive dissolution profile. The dissolution results for Mezavant® XL (Lialda®) (lag time 290 min) demonstrated good correlation with previously reported in vivo disintegration times assessed by gamma-scintigraphy in humans. Octasa® showed a similar lag time to Mezavant® XL. Drug release from Asacol® 800 (Asacol® HD) showed a wide standard deviation, reflecting the great variability in vivo. Salofalk® displayed both delayed release and extended release characteristics. Pentasa® released more than 50 % of its drug load in the stomach compartment of the model, which is attributed to the absence of a <b>gastro-resistant</b> coating in this product. The new dissolution method provided a realistic and discriminative in vitro assessment of mesalazine release from different formulations.

The effect of polymer concentration, viscosity, and drug/polymer ratio on bead micromeritics and drug release rate was studied. Ketoprofen and ketoprofen lysinate loaded alginate beads were obtained in a very narrow dimensional range when the Cross model was used to set prilling operative conditions. Size distribution of alginate beads in the hydrated state was strongly dependent on viscosity of drug/polymer solutions and frequency of the vibration. The release kinetics of the drugs showed that drug release rate was related with alginate concentration and solubility of the drug. Alginate solutions with concentration higher than 0. 50 % (w/w) were suitable to prepare ketoprofen <b>gastro-resistant</b> formulation, while for ketoprofen lysinate alginate, concentration should be increased to 1. 50 % (w/w) in order to retain the drug in gastric environment.

The methacrylic acid polymers (Eudragit L and Eudragit S) were added separately to aqueous solutions of ammonium hydrogen carbonate; the solutions were then spray-dried. FTIR {{analysis of the}} harvested microparticle products identified the presence of ammonium methacrylate {{with the appearance of}} a peak at 1550 cm− 1 corresponding to the stretching of the N–H bond. Incubating the microparticles for three hours at 70 °C and 130 °C for the Eudragit S and L products, respectively, was sufficient to eradicate the ammonium residues. The microparticles, loaded with the model drug prednisolone, were spherical and small in size (2 – 5 μm). Moreover, the particles were <b>gastro-resistant,</b> and release was rapid and complete at small intestinal conditions. The pH threshold of release of the Eudragit S and Eudragit L microparticles was lowered from 7 and 6 to 6. 5 and 5. 5, respectively. In bicarbonate media, which are physiological and representative of the conditions of the proximal small intestine (mHanks) and the distal small intestine (Kreb’s), drug release from these spray-dried microparticles was faster compared to microparticles produced from conventional emulsion solvent evaporation methods.

40|$|The {{establishment}} of physiologically relevant in vitro-in vivo correlations (IV-IVCs) is key for any biorelevant dissolution test. Historically, bicarbonate buffers have produced better correlations than compendial phosphate buffered media, though such tests are usually performed {{at a constant}} pH experiment, overlooking {{the notion that the}} pH of the luminal fluids is variable and fluctuating. In this work, we have devised a dynamic dissolution test method employing a physiological bicarbonate buffer under pH conditions of the proximal gut in order to assess the dissolution behaviour of various enteric polymer-coated (<b>gastro-resistant)</b> prednisolone tablets. The pH of the media is modulated and controlled by an Auto pH System™ which exploits the physiological equilibria between [H 2 CO 3] and [HCO 3 -], to match it to the aboral change in pH with transit of the dosage form through the proximal small intestine (from pH 5. 6 up to 6. 8). The lag time values for an accelerated release and standard EUDRAGIT® L 30 D- 55 coated formulation (25 min and 60 min, respectively) were close to the previously reported initial tablet disintegration time data obtained in-vivo by γ-scintigraphy (28 min and 66 min, respectively).

These nanoparticles were prepared by a coacervation process, stabilized with either lysine or arginine and, finally, dried by spray‐drying. For some batches, the effect of a supplementary treatment of nanoparticles (before drying) with hydrodynamic high pressure on the properties of the resulting carriers was also evaluated. The resulting nanoparticles displayed a mean size close to 150 nm and a folic acid content of around 25 mg per mg nanoparticle. From the in vitro release studies, it was observed that casein nanoparticles acted as <b>gastro‐resistant</b> devices and, thus, folic acid was only released under simulated intestinal conditions. For the pharmacokinetic study, folic acid was orally administered to laboratory animals as a single dose of 1 mg/kg. Animals treated with folic acidloaded casein nanoparticles displayed significantly higher serum levels than those observed in animals receiving an aqueous solution of the vitamin.

From the differential (f 1) and similarity factor (f 2), Formulation F 5 was the formulation most similar to the commercially available oral formulation as reference standard. The drug release performance was greatly affected by the materials used in microparticle preparations, which allow absorption in the intestinal tract...|$|E
40|$|Quercetin (Q, 3, 5, 7, 3 ’, 4 ’-pentahydroxyflavone), {{a common}} dietary {{component}} occurring in various edible plant and herbal medicines, has shown anti-oxidant and anti-inflammatory properties in numerous mammalian cell systems, in vitro {{as well in}} vivo. Although the variety of its biological effects, the Q bioavailability is an important unsolved problem. Q, in fact, is poorly soluble and is unstable in gastric conditions, {{even if it is}} well absorbed by the small intestine. In the attempt to ensure gastric protection and better deliver of this drug, in this study we prepared Q <b>gastro-resistant</b> microspheres by solvent evaporation method, using cellulose acetate phthalate (C-A-P), cellulose acetate propionate (CAP) or their blends in different ratios as coating polymers. The formulation and preparation conditions (stirring speed, polymer concentration, drug-to-polymer ratio, temperature) were optimized to obtain high encapsulation efficiency and production yield. The synthesized microspheres were submitted to several chemical-physical analyses (light scattering, fluorescence and scanning electron microscopy, X-ray diffractometry, calorimetry, infrared spectroscopy) in order to evaluate the effect of the matrices composition on the morphology and properties of the microparticulate systems. Moreover, the release properties were investigated performing in vitro dissolution studies. The analyses evidenced that the microspheres were free-flowing and spherical in shape, Q was microencapsulated in the amorphous state and the drug content was near to the theoretical one. In vitro dissolution studies, carried out using a pH change method, showed that all samples ehibit a fairly gastroresistance with a typical biphasic drug release trend, due to the pH dependent solubility of the enteric polymers used as matrices. However, the matrices composition strongly affect the amount of drug released at high pH values: in fact, the amount of Q released in simulated intestinal fluid is about complete (ca. 90 %) in the case of C-A-P microspheres but proportionally decreases with the CAP percentage in the system...|$|E
40|$|International audiencePosaconazole is {{extensively}} {{used for}} prophylaxis for invasive fungal infections. The <b>gastro-resistant</b> tablet formulation {{has allowed the}} bioavailability issues encountered with the oral suspension to be overcome. However, overexposure is now frequent. This study aimed to (i) describe the pharmacokinetics of posaconazole tablets in a real-life cohort of patients with hematological malignancies and (ii) perform Monte Carlo simulations to assess {{the possibility that the}} daily dose can be reduced while keeping a sufficient exposure. Forty-nine consecutive inpatients were prospectively included in the study. Posaconazole trough concentrations (TC) were measured once a week, and biological and demographic data were collected. The concentrations were analyzed by compartmental modeling, and Monte Carlo simulations were performed using estimated parameters to assess the rate of attainment of the target TC after dose reduction. The pharmacokinetics of posaconazole were well described using a one-compartment model with first-order absorption and elimination. The values of the parameters (interindividual variabilities) were as follows: the absorption constant (k(a)) was 0. 588 h(- 1) (fixed), the volume of distribution (V/F) was 420 liters (28. 2 %), and clearance (CL/F) was 7. 3 liters/h (24. 2 %) with 31. 9 % interoccasion variability. Forty-nine percent of the simulated patients had TC at steady state of >= 1. 5 mu g/ml and maintained a TC above 1 mu g/ml after a reduction of the dose to 200 mg daily. A third of these patients eligible for a dose reduction had TC of >= 1. 5 mu g/ml as soon as 48 h of treatment. Though posaconazole tablets were less impacted by bioavailability issues than the oral suspension, the pharmacokinetics of posaconazole tablets remain highly variable. Simulations showed that approximately half of the patients would benefit from a reduction of the dose from 300 mg to 200 mg while keeping the TC above the minimal recommended target of 0. 7 mu g/ml, resulting in a 33 % savings in the cost of this very expensive drug...|$|E
30|$|While {{necessary}} to achieve erogenicity [27], large boluses (~[*] 200 – 300 [*]mg kg− 1 body mass) of NaHCO 3 can induce significant GI symptoms. In the current study, there was {{a high incidence of}} GI distress with the aqueous solution, which is in agreement with some authors [13] but not others [10, 28]. Symptoms are considered to have both gastric and intestinal causes [8], a finding that is supported by the current study. On entering the stomach, NaHCO 3 dissociates to sodium and bicarbonate ions, the latter of which produces carbon dioxide during the neutralisation of gastric acid [8]. Consequently, carbon dioxide tension increases exponentially with exposure and is associated with gastric symptoms, such as belching, nausea and stomach ache. Intestinal symptoms, though partly induced from elevated carbon dioxide tension in the intestinal lumen, originate from excess sodium that aggravates the intestinal mucosa and creates osmotic fluctuations leading to bowel urgency and diarrhoea [13]. Delayed-release capsules, partly formulated with a polymeric barrier, have <b>gastro-resistant</b> properties and can minimise disintegration in the stomach. Mitigating gastric symptoms may indeed have implications for performance. Previous research indicates that symptoms can inhibit high-intensity cycling performance [14], while others have reported improvements irrespectively [26]. Since numerous participants have withdrawn from studies due to GI distress [29], previous research may have underestimated the ergolytic effect of such symptoms. Studies that have attempted to mitigate GI symptoms following NaHCO 3 ingestion have done so using alternative dosing strategies. Gelatine capsules co-ingested with a small high-carbohydrate (1.5 [*]g kg− 1 body mass) meal are currently regarded as the formulation least likely to induce GI symptoms following NaHCO 3 ingestion [10]. In the current study, delayed-release capsules were ingested after an overnight fast, largely to minimise potential confounding effects of food on acid-base changes. Nevertheless, co-ingestion with a small high-carbohydrate meal may have further reduced GI symptoms and warrants further investigation. Furthermore, while comparison with an aqueous solution was chosen based on its frequency of use within the literature, {{this may not be the}} case in the practice and is thus a limitation to the study. Future work should look to assess the pharmacokinetics of NaHCO 3 administered based on capsule composition only, so that the mechanism underpinning bioavailability and reductions in GI distress may be better understood.|$|E
40|$|INTRODUCTION: Multiple Sclerosis (MS) is a {{condition}} with a significant economic and social burden that affects young adults, in their active working phase. The most recent evaluations show an annual average social cost of € 38 - 39 thousand per patient. Today {{the approval of the}} new oral therapies allows physicians to select further options that can meet patients’ clinical unmet needs. OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the economic impact of a recently approved therapy, delayed-release dimethyl-fumarate (DMF; also known as <b>gastro-resistant</b> DMF), on the overall management costs of relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis (RRMS) in Italy. METHODS: A budget impact model, adopting the perspective of the Italian National Healthcare Service (NHS), was used to compare healthcare costs of two different treatment scenarios: a) base-case, where DMF is not available for RRMS patients (Scenario A), vs. b) alternative-case, where DMF is available for RRMS patients (Scenario B). Healthcare costs sustained by the Italian NHS to manage the RRMS population (drug treatment, administration, therapy and disease monitoring, relapse management, treatment-related adverse events) have been calculated over 3 years and compared for the two scenarios. Impact of relapses for the disease modifying therapies (DMTs) included in the analysis was estimated using an elaboration of the results from published mixed treatment comparison. RRMS population treated with DMTs was estimated using Italian prevalence and incidence data. According to these estimates, the number of treated patients amounted to 36, 078 at Year 1, 38, 832 at Year 2, and 40, 673 at Year 3. RESULTS: According to the current price and to the assumptions reported in the methodology section, it was estimated that the introduction of DMF (Scenario B) determines a decrease of the budget impact, if compared with the base case (Scenario A) in the perspective of Italian NHS. Over three years, the budget impact would be € 1, 376 mln in the Scenario A and € 1, 354 mln in the Scenario B (- 22. 18 mln €; - 1. 61 % relative budget variation). The main drivers for cost-saving were pharmacological treatment costs and reduced burden of relapses (corresponding to more than 1, 800 avoided relapses). CONCLUSIONS: At the current cost conditions applied in Italy and according to the described assumptions, the use of DMF is economically sustainable for the Italian NHS. Plausibly, the introduction and usage of this new therapy in RRMS patients will ensure clinical benefits for patients without resulting in additional costs for the Italian NHS. [In Italian...|$|E
40|$|Summary: This work {{reports a}} {{clinical}} trial performed at palermo University Hospital "paolo Giaccone". From January 2004 to December 2011, 79 patients were enrolled (40 men and 39 women). All patients suffered from Inflammatory Bowel Disease (IBD) and were subjected to orthopedic consultation at the institute of Orthopaedics, University Hospital of palermo, for arthropathy to IBD. The patients {{were divided into two}} groups (A and B) and dealt with different therapies for the resolution of the inflammatory picture of the colonic mucosa and the treatment of the extraintestinal articular manifestations. Group A was treated with drug therapy: Diclofenac (75 mg im/ day for 10 days 9 and Mesalazine (800 mg <b>gastro-resistant</b> tabletes, one tablet twice a day in mild forms, and one tablet three times per day in moderate forms). In group B, in addition to the previous treatment protocol, two probiotic mixture were added in a time of two weeks: in the first week, twice a day, one capsule containing mixture of Enterococcus faecium and saccharomices boluard was administered, with the main purpose to mitigate the intestinal inflammation; in the second week, twice a day too, one capsule containing a mixture of lactobacillus salivarius and lactobacillus acidophilus was administered, with the main purpose to mitigate the intestinal inflammation, in the second week, twice a day too, one capsule containing a mixture of lactobacillus salivarius and lactobacillus acidophilus was administered, with the aim to promote the restoration of a normal intestinal microenvironment. The attenuation of intestinal inflammation, improved by the presence of probiotics, could have important effects on the articular manifestations, resulting in a significant improvement of the arthropathy. All patients were evaluated with the Harvey-Bradshaw Index. Both Crohn Disease and Ulcerative Cholitis diagnosis was made with clinical, laboratory, endoscopic and instrumental tests; the degree of disease activity was evaluated using the criteria of Truelove and witts. The WOMAC-Score (Western Ontario Mcmaster) was used in our study to investigate the degree of articular involvement of the patients. The data were statistically evaluated and these are shown that the B group of patients treated with conventional therapy + probiotic mixture had a better resolution of the clinical and of this post-treatment parameters: WOMAC score, ESR, CRP and white blood cells; and also the B group of patients have a better response to standard therapy compared with patients who did not receive the probiotic with a remarkable statistic significance (p> 0, 0001) ...|$|E
40|$|Objective Delayed-release {{dimethyl}} fumarate (DMF; {{also known}} as <b>gastro-resistant</b> DMF) and fingolimod are approved oral disease-modifying treatments for relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis. In phase 3 trials, DMF (DEFINE/CONFIRM) and fingolimod (FREEDOMS/FREEDOMS II) resulted in significant reductions in clinical and magnetic resonance imaging activity, with acceptable safety profiles. Direct comparisons of these treatments are not possible {{due to a lack}} of head-to-head trials. We compared 2 -year efficacy of DMF versus fingolimod at the approved dosage using a matching-adjusted indirect approach. Research design and methods Individual patient data from DEFINE and CONFIRM, and aggregate data from FREEDOMS and FREEDOMS II, were pooled and compared using the matching-adjusted indirect method. To account for cross-trial differences, data from trials with available individual patient data were adjusted to match aggregate data (i. e., average patient characteristics) from trials without patient-level data. Data from DMF-treated patients were weighted such that average baseline characteristics matched those of fingolimod-treated patients. After matching, weighted treatment outcomes for DMF-treated patients (240 [*]mg twice daily) were compared with summary outcomes for fingolimod-treated patients (0. 5 [*]mg once daily). All comparison results of DMF versus fingolimod used fingolimod as the reference. Clinical trial registration NCT 00420212 (DEFINE); NCT 00451451 (CONFIRM); NCT 00289978 (FREEDOMS); NCT 00355134 (FREEDOMS II). Results After matching, baseline characteristics were balanced between DMF and fingolimod. At year 2, the efficacy of DMF was similar to that of fingolimod for annualized relapse rate (rate ratio 1. 11; 95 % confidence interval [CI]: 0. 88, 1. 40), 12 -week confirmed disability progression (hazard ratio 0. 90; 95 % CI: 0. 63, 1. 29), and Multiple Sclerosis Functional Composite (mean difference 0. 04; 95 % CI: - 0. 05, 0. 13). For patient-reported outcomes (EuroQoL 5 -Dimensions questionnaire), the mean differences (95 % CI) were 0. 05 (0. 01, 0. 08) for utility score and 3. 22 (0. 58, 5. 86) for visual analog scale score, significantly favoring DMF. There was no significant difference in the percentage of patients with no evidence of disease activity (NEDA) for DMF versus fingolimod among matching-adjusted patients with complete NEDA data: rate ratio (95 % CI) : 0. 92 (0. 51, 1. 64). Conclusions Using the matching-adjusted indirect comparison approach, the efficacy of DMF and fingolimod were similar on all clinical outcomes, while patient-reported outcomes showed greater benefit with DMF. Study limitations include possible confounding from unobserved/unknown differences between trials, and trial length may have been insufficient to detect significant differences on disability progression...|$|E
40|$|INTRODUCTION: Disease Modifying Therapies (DMTs) have {{significantly}} improved clinical conditions of Relapsing Remitting Multiple Sclerosis (RRMS) patients. However, several unmet needs are still relevant in RRMS. Recently, a new therapy, delayed-release dimethyl-fumarate (DMF; {{also known as}} <b>gastro-resistant</b> DMF), has been approved and reimbursed by the Italian Drug Agency (AIFA) {{for the treatment of}} RRMS. OBJECTIVE: To compare the cost-effectiveness of DMF vs. pharmacological alternatives indicated for the first-line treatment of RRMS in Italy. METHODS: The analysis was conducted {{from the perspective of the}} Italian National Healthcare Service (NHS) and outcomes and costs were evaluated over a 50 -year time horizon (equivalent to a lifetime horizon). Both outcomes and costs were discounted at 3. 5 %. The Markov model estimates the clinical and economic consequences of treating RRMS patients with the following therapeutic options: DMF, interferon (IFN) beta- 1 a intramuscular (IM); IFN beta- 1 a subcutaneous (SC) at two different doses, 22 mcg and 44 mcg; IFN beta- 1 b SC; glatiramer acetate (GA) SC 20 mg; oral teriflunomide. Clinical efficacy data used in this analysis came from an elaboration of the mixed treatment comparison (MTC) already published. According to the Italian NHS perspective, only the following direct costs were considered: pharmacological treatment acquisition, treatment monitoring, relapse management, direct costs associated with disability, adverse event management. Administration costs were assumed equal to € 0, because every treatment included in the economic analysis can be self-administered. One-way and probabilistic sensitivity analyses were developed and cost effectiveness acceptability curves generated. RESULTS: In the base-case analysis, DMF was more efficacious than alternatives, in terms of both survival (19. 496 vs. 19. 297 - 19. 461 discounted LYs, respectively), and QALYs (6. 548 vs. 5. 172 - 6. 212 discounted QALYs, respectively). Per-patient lifetime costs with DMF amounted to € 276, 500, similarly to the other options. DMF was the drug with the largest effect of disability cost reduction. DMF was dominant vs. IFN beta- 1 a 44 mcg and cost-effective vs. all other IFNs, GA and teriflunomide, with incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICERs) between € 11, 272 and € 23, 409. All ICER values were lower than the € 50, 000 per QALY threshold. One-way sensitivity analysis showed that, for all tested scenarios, ICER of DMF vs. therapeutic alternatives remained favourable (≤ 50. 000 €/QALY gained) and the results of probabilistic sensitivity analysis showed that the probability for DMF of being favourable (≤ 50. 000 €/QALY gained) was between around 70 % and 93 %, thus ensuring robustness of the results. CONCLUSIONS: The results of this economic analysis show that, at the current price and the described assumptions, DMF represents a cost-effective option vs. other available first-line treatments indicated in RRMS in the perspective of the Italian NHS.
