2500|$|Michael {{ascended the}} throne {{for the second}} time, while Antonescu's dictatorial powers were {{confirmed}} and extended. On September 6, the day Michael formally assumed the throne, he issued a royal decree declaring Antonescu Conducător (leader) of the state. [...] The same decree consecrated a ceremonial role for the monarch. Among his subsequent measures was ensuring the safe departure into self-exile of Carol and his mistress Elena Lupescu, granting protection to the royal train when it was attacked by armed members of the Iron Guard. The regime of King Carol had been notorious for been the most corrupt regime in Europe during the 1930s, and when Carol fled Romania, he took with him {{the better part of}} the Romanian treasury, leaving the new government with enormous financial problems. Antonescu had expected-perhaps naïvely-that Carol would take with him enough money to provide for a comfortable exile, and was surprised that Carol had cleared out almost the entire national treasury. For the next four years, a major concern of Antonescu's government was attempting to have the Swiss banks where Carol had deposited the assets to return the money to Romania; this effort did not meet with success. Horia Sima's subsequent cooperation with Antonescu was endorsed by high-ranking Nazi German officials, many of whom feared the Iron Guard was too weak to rule on its own. Antonescu therefore received the approval of Ambassador Fabricius. Despite early promises, Antonescu abandoned projects for the creation of a national government, and opted instead for a coalition between a military dictatorship lobby and the Iron Guard. He later justified his choice by stating that the Iron Guard [...] "represented the political base of the country at the time." [...] Right from the onset, Antonescu clashed with Sima over economic questions, with Antonescu's main concern to <b>get</b> <b>the</b> <b>economy</b> growing to provide taxes for a treasury looted by Carol while Sima favored populist economic measures that Antonescu insisted that there was no money for.|$|E

5000|$|In 1974, Kemp and Teague began devising tax {{legislation}} aimed at <b>getting</b> <b>the</b> national <b>economy</b> {{out of its}} doldrums. The earliest bills consisted of proposed tax changes to encourage savings and investment. A 2011 article in Forbes detailed their work on the legislation: [...] "In 1974, Kemp (assisted by staffer Randal Teague, who spoke last week in Charlottesville) started devising legislation aimed at <b>getting</b> <b>the</b> <b>economy</b> out of its inflationary torpor. At first his resolutions included mixes of tax cuts for businesses and savers. But in 1977, he introduced what {{would become one of}} the iconic bills of modern political history - the Kemp-Roth personal income tax cut, which would reduce rates by 30% across-the-board. Kemp-Roth thundered out of the gate, picking up sponsors and votes as inflation went from a high 8% per year to a nosebleed 14%. The ’70s gave way to 1980, but President Jimmy Carter would not let Kemp-Roth pass, making compromises to <b>get</b> it off <b>the</b> table and expunging even its rhetoric in House-Senate conference sessions. It took Ronald Reagan to pick up the ball." [...] This bill became the basis for the Reagan tax cut law in 1981.|$|R

Second, perhaps the most important change is the shift in people’s feelings about Japan’s future, from resignation to optimistic hope.
