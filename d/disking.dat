In the DVD commentaries, creator Matt Groening and the majority of people who work on the show state several times that they are very liberal, but some, such as John Swartzwelder (the writer of this and many other The Simpsons episodes), are conservative. In his book The Really Inconvenient Truths: Seven Environmental Catastrophes Liberals Don't Want You to Know About- Because They Helped Cause Them, Iain Murray described [...] "The Frying Game" [...] as [...] "subversively conservative", and wrote that it shows [...] "The best popular explanation of the liberal environmentalist model for endangered species." [...] In the episode, Homer buys a koi pond for Marge, only to find a screamapillar has taken residence in their garden. When Homer tries to squash it, an EPA official tells him that allowing an endangered species to die is a federal offense, under the [...] "Reversal of Freedoms Act of 1994." [...] Homer is forced to coddle the screamapillar, and when he accidentally squashes it, Homer is found guilty of [...] "attempted insecticide and aggravated buggery." [...] The [...] "Reversal of Freedoms Act" [...] is a reference to the Endangered Species Act, an environmental law that Murray opined had [...] "indeed become the Reversal of Freedoms Act." [...] He continued, [...] "Landowners who happened to have threatened or endangered species on their lands or who simply have habitat that might be used by endangered species are routinely prevented from using their lands or property. They are stopped from undertaking such activities as harvesting their trees, grazing their cattle, irrigating their fields, clearing brush along fence lines, <b>disking</b> firebreaks around their homes and barns, or building new homes.|$|E

Haferkamp and colleagues compared seed drill planting to imprinting on loose and firm seedbeds on a Wyoming big sagebrush and needlegrass habitat. Drilling produced more seedlings on firm seedbeds, whereas imprinting produced two times more seedlings on loose soils, compared to drilling. Haferkamp and colleagues used brushbeating plus <b>disking</b> to create the loosened soil treatment in that study.

We demonstrate that these anemic <b>disks</b> are not a homogenous class of objects corresponding to a unique evolutionary state. Rather, such <b>disks</b> around early (B/A) spectral type stars are most likely warm, terrestrial zone debris disks; MIPS-detected anemic <b>disks</b> around later (M) stars are likely evolved primordial <b>disks</b> such as transition <b>disks</b> in their mid-IR colors, accretion signatures, and <b>disk</b> luminosities. Anemic <b>disks</b> surrounding G and K stars contain both populations. The difference in evolutionary states between anemic <b>disks</b> surrounding early type vs. late-type stars is consistent with a mass-dependent evolution of circumstellar <b>disks</b> from the primordial <b>disk</b> phase through the debris <b>disk</b> phase. Specifically, <b>disks</b> characteristically get to the debris <b>disk</b> phase faster for early-type stars; debris <b>disks</b> dominate the <b>disk</b> population of early-type stars by ∼ 3 – 5 Myr.

40|$|Abstract—The Popular <b>Disk</b> Concentration (PDC) {{technique}} and the Massive Array of Idle <b>Disks</b> (MAID) technique are two effective energy saving schemes for parallel <b>disk</b> systems. The goal of PDC and MAID is to skew I/O load towards a few <b>disks</b> so that other <b>disks</b> can be transitioned to low power states to conserve energy. I/O load skewing techniques like PDC and MAID inherently affect reliability of parallel <b>disks</b> because <b>disks</b> storing popular data {{tend to have}} high failure rates than <b>disks</b> storing cold data. To achieve good tradeoffs between energy efficiency and <b>disk</b> reliability, we first present a reliability model to quantitatively study the reliability of energy-efficient parallel <b>disk</b> systems equipped with the PDC and MAID schemes. Then, we propose a novel strategy— <b>disk</b> swapping—to improve <b>disk</b> reliability by alternating <b>disks</b> storing hot data with <b>disks</b> holding cold data. We demonstrate that our diskswapping strategies not only can increase the lifetime of cache <b>disks</b> in MAID-based parallel <b>disk</b> systems, but also can improve reliability of PDC-based parallel <b>disk</b> systems.

5000|$|In various {{regions of}} the United States, farmers call these {{implements}} just discs (or disks), and they reserve the word harrow for the lighter types of harrow, such as chain and tooth harrows. Therefore, in these regions, the phrase [...] "plowing, <b>disking,</b> and harrowing" [...] refers to three separate tillage steps. This is not any official distinction but is how farmers tend to speak.|$|E
50|$|Mechanical soil {{cultivation}} practices, including primary tillage (mold-board or chisel plowing) followed by secondary tillage (<b>disking,</b> harrowing, etc.), break up and aerate soil. When soils become degraded and compacted, such tillage practices are often deemed necessary. The tilth created by tillage, however, {{tends to be}} unstable, because the aggregation is obtained through the physical manipulation of the soil, which is short lived, especially after years of intensive tillage. Aggregates in such soils readily dissolve during subsequent rains, causing the soil to settle and become dense and hard, requiring further tillage.|$|E

5000|$|The grass spreads {{primarily}} via its rhizome. It {{has been}} noted to grow 1.3 cm in length per day. The stems and rhizomes also produce tillers. The rhizome can endure drying and flooding. Dry or wet conditions may {{reduce the amount of}} shoots produced by the rhizome, but they do not kill it. The rhizome can disperse when parts of it break off and drop onto the substrate elsewhere, anchoring and putting up new shoots. The plant survives and sprouts after herbicide application, grazing, cutting, plowing or <b>disking,</b> and burning. The grass rarely reproduces by seed. It {{has been noted}} to reproduce by seed in Portugal, but does not do so in the United States, and it was described as [...] "incapable of fruiting" [...] in Japan. Seeds are sometimes observed but they are apparently rarely viable, with many studies describing zero germination.|$|E
50|$|In {{addition}} to the increased runoff that results from plasticulture, {{there is also the}} problem of the increased amount of waste form the plastic mulch itself. The use of plastic mulch for vegetables, strawberries, and other row and orchard crops exceeds 110 million pounds annually in the United States. Most plastic ends up in the landfill, although there are other disposal options such as <b>disking</b> mulches into the soil, on-site burying, on-site storage, reuse, recycling, and incineration. The incineration and recycling options are complicated by the variety of the types of plastics that are used and by the geographic dispersal of the plastics. Plastics also contain stabilizers and dyes as well as heavy metals, which limits the amount of products that can be recycled. Research is continually being conducted on creating biodegradable or photodegradable mulches. While there has been minor success with this, there is also the problem of how long the plastic takes to degrade, as many biodegradable products {{take a long time to}} break down.|$|E

50|$|Management of mixedwoods in the Prairie Provinces in the 1990s usually used clearcutting. When aspen is {{the main}} species to be regenerated, little {{treatment}} {{is applied to the}} site, but slash piles, compaction of soil, and damage to aspen root systems are minimized as much as is feasible in order to encourage suckering. In the coniferous harvest, aspen that is not harvested is usually left standing to reduce suckering, {{as well as for the}} benefit of wildlife. Regeneration of white spruce is more difficult. In general, plantation techniques are used, with mechanical site preparation following clearcutting. Depending on site conditions and availability of equipment, disk trenching, double <b>disking,</b> blading, ripper, or Marttiini plowing, Bracke spot scarification, high-speed mixing, or spot mounding are used. Plantings of white spruce have come to favour the use of large container or transplant stock. In the early years after clearcutting, site preparation and planting, shade-intolerant vegetation, such as aspen, Calamagrostis canadensis, and green alder compete strongly with the young outplants, frequently causing death.|$|E
50|$|After establishment, switchgrass {{management}} {{will depend}} on the goal of the seeding. Historically, most switchgrass seedings have been managed for the Conservation Reserve Program in the US. Disturbance such as periodic mowing, burning, or <b>disking</b> is required to optimize the stand’s utility for encouraging biodiversity. Increased attention is being placed on switchgrass management as an energy crop. Generally, the crop requires modest application of nitrogen fertilizer, as it is not a heavy feeder. Typical nitrogen (N) content of senescent material in the fall is 0.5% N. Fertilizer nitrogen applications of about 5 kg N/hectare (ha) applied for each tonne of biomass removed is a general guideline. More specific recommendations for fertilization are available regionally in North America. Herbicides are not often used on switchgrass after the seeding year, as the crop is generally quite competitive with weeds. Most bioenergy conversion processes for switchgrass, including those for cellulosic ethanol and pellet fuel production, can generally accept some alternative species in the harvested biomass. Stands of switchgrass should be harvested no more than twice per year, and one cutting often provides as much biomass as two. Switchgrass can be harvested with the same field equipment used for hay production, and it is well-suited to baling or bulk field harvesting. If its biology is properly taken into consideration, switchgrass can offer great potential as an energy crop.|$|E
