5|$|Karnataka {{consists}} of four main types of geological formations— the Archean complex made up of Dharwad schists and granitic gneisses, the Proterozoic non-fossiliferous sedimentary formations of the Kaladgi and Bhima series, the Deccan trappean and intertrappean deposits and the tertiary and recent laterites and alluvial deposits. Significantly, about 60% {{of the state is}} composed of the Archean complex which consist of gneisses, granites and charnockite rocks. Laterite cappings that are found in many districts over the Deccan Traps were formed after the cessation of volcanic activity in the early tertiary period. Eleven groups of soil orders are found in Karnataka, viz. Entisols, <b>Inceptisols,</b> Mollisols, Spodosols, Alfisols, Ultisols, Oxisols, Aridisols, Vertisols, Andisols and Histosols. Depending on the agricultural capability of the soil, the soil types are divided into six types, viz. red, lateritic, black, alluvio-colluvial, forest and coastal soils.|$|E

40|$|ABSTRACT: Adsorption of anilofos was {{studied in}} four soils (topsoil from alfisol, <b>inceptisol,</b> oxisol and vertisol). The order of {{adsorption}} of anilofos was Vertisol> Oxisol> Alfisol> <b>Inceptisol.</b> The soil sorption coefficient K and the soil organic carbon sorption coefficient Koc {{are the basic}} parameters used for describing the environmental fate of the herbicides. In top soil the calculated K values were 5. 43, 3. 35, 9. 41, 11. 73; Koc values were 1086. 00, 1288. 46, 1191. 14, 771. 71 and Kc values were 9. 05, 33. 5, 20. 02 and 36. 66 from Alfisol, <b>Inceptisol,</b> Oxisol and Vertisol respectively. Field experimental plots with no previous history of anilofos were selected and studied the degradation of anilofos in top soil collected from Alfisol and <b>Inceptisol.</b> The half-life of anilofos in topsoil from Alfisol: T 1 - 3. 17 days and T 2 3. 67 days and in Inceptisol: T 1 - 3. 91 days and T 2 - 4. 55 days.

A presence of calcium in the soil is common to white spruce found in northern New York. White spruce most commonly grows in the soil orders of Alfisols and <b>Inceptisols.</b> Soil properties such as fertility, temperature, and structural stability are partial determinants of the ability of white spruce to grow in the extreme northern latitudes.

25|$|Podzolized, brunisolic, luvisolic, gleysolic, and regosolic (immature) {{soils are}} typical of those {{supporting}} white spruce throughout {{the range of the}} species (Nienstaedt 1957). Soils supporting white spruce are most commonly Alfisols or <b>Inceptisols</b> (Nienstaedt and Zasada 1990). In the podzol region of Wisconsin, white spruce occurs on loam podzols, podzolized gley loams, strongly podzolized clays, gley-podzol clays, stream-bottom soils, and wood peat (Wilde et al. 1949). Moist sandy loams also support good growth (Harlow and Harrar 1950). On sandy podzols (Wilde et al. 1949), it is usually a minor species (Nienstaedt and Zasada 1990). Good development occurs on moist alluvium (Seeley, cited by Nienstaedt 1957; Jeffrey 1961, 1964; Lacate et al. 1965; Viereck 1973) on the banks of streams and borders of swamps (Sargent 1898, Kenety 1917, Rowe 1972). White spruce makes good growth on well-drained lacustrine soils in Alberta Mixedwoods (Heger 1971), on moderately-well-drained clay loams in Saskatchewan (Kabzems 1971), and on melanized loams and clays (with sparse litter and a dark-coloured organically-enriched mineral horizon) in the Algoma district of Ontario (Wilde et al. 1954).|$|E

40|$|Significant {{discrepancies}} {{exist in}} global {{estimates of the}} atmospheric methane (CH 4) budget. This is particularly true for tropical South America where bottom-up approaches, rooted in field observation, tend to under estimate atmospheric observations. As such, {{a better understanding of}} soil environments, which are capable of acting as both source and sink for atmospheric CH 4, is required. Soil-atmosphere CH 4 exchange is fundamentally determined by the balance between strictly anaerobic methanogenic and aerobic methanotrophic microbial processes. For this reason, CH 4 emissions are typically associated with anoxic wetland soils, whilst, oxic upland soils are thought to uptake CH 4 from the atmosphere. However, there is increasing evidence that upland soils may act as sources of CH 4 through methanogenic activity within cryptic wetlands or anoxic microsites. This thesis aims to: document soil-atmosphere CH 4 fluxes in poorly represented tropical upland and montane ecosystems, investigate controls on CH 4 flux with a focus on soil oxygen (O 2) concentration and investigate relationships between methanogenic and methanotrophic processes under oxic conditions. These aims are addressed in three chapters focusing on lowland terra firme, premontane and montane forests and montane humid puna grasslands and wetlands along an Amazonian to Andean transect spanning 3300 m of elevation in southeastern Peru. In the lowland rainforest intensive seasonal field campaigns and laboratory incubations were conducted on higher porosity ultisol and lower porosity <b>inceptisol</b> soils. Mean (s. e.) net CH 4 fluxes for dry and wet seasons were, respectively, - 1. 59 (0. 06) and - 1. 39 (0. 07) mg CH 4 -C m− 2 d− 1 for the ultisol and - 0. 95 (0. 06) and - 0. 41 (0. 10) mg CH 4 -C m− 2 d− 1 for the <b>inceptisol.</b> Greater uptake rates in the ultisol than the <b>inceptisol</b> were best explained by lower water-filled pore space (WFPS). Similarly, WFPS best explained between season variation in net CH 4 flux from the <b>inceptisol,</b> whilst, we were unable to explain the smaller variations observed for the ultisol.

Lagerh f. sp. subterranea Tomlinson, which is an obligate parasite that replicates in roots and tubers of potato (Solanum tuberosum). This replication results in resistant structures which are denominated cystosori. Production of cystosori was investigated in the potato variety Diacol Capiro, which was cultivated in three types of soil (<b>Inceptisol,</b> Entisol, and Andisol) that were infested with cystosori. Concentration of cystosori was determined at planting (Initial), at plant senescence (Harvest), and at plant disintegration (Postharvest). The experimental design was completely randomized with two treatments and three levels each. Soil type with the levels <b>Inceptisol,</b> Entisol and Andisol, was one treatment; and the sampling time with the initial, harvest and postharvest, was the other. Additionally, a test of simple regression to analyze correlation of the initial and final concentration of cystosori was performed. In all types of soil, cystosori concentration increased significantly (P < 0. 05) from planting to postharvest; the mean increase was 48 %. There was no significant (P < 0. 05) difference among types of soil at any time sampling. The final concentration of cystosori (Postharvest) was significantly (P < 0. 05) which correlated with the initial concentration of cystosori (Initial). These results suggest that cystosori concentration can have a substantial increase after a single potato crop cycle, and harvest residuals, such as contaminated tubers, can contribute to this increase...|$|R
