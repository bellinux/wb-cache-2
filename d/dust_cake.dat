50|$|Reverse-air baghouses are {{compartmentalized}} {{to allow}} continuous operation. Before a cleaning cycle begins, filtration is {{stopped in the}} compartment to be cleaned. Bags are cleaned by injecting clean air into the dust collector in a reverse direction, which pressurizes the compartment.

40|$|AbstractThe {{control of}} {{particulate}} emissions from various {{applications such as}} power generation, cement plants, minerals processing etc. is essential to meet government regulatory standards. Filter bags and cartridge elements are typical common mediums used to separate particulates. A common method used to clean filters in the extraction of particulate matter from a fluid stream, is Reverse Pulse-Jet (RPJ) cleaning systems. The operation of the RPJ cleaning system relies on stored {{energy in the form}} of compressed gas, which is usually air. In this paper, the design and application of an efficient cleaning system to minimise the use of compressed gas to achieve the required filter cleaning is described. In an RPJ cleaning system, a high-energy pulse of compressed gas is delivered into the filter medium to rapidly increase the internal pressure and, in the case of filter bags, accelerate the filter material to force the break-up of <b>dust</b> <b>cakes</b> that form on the filter surface. One key component of the cleaning system is an extremely fast acting valve that controls the flow of the high pressure gas, the other is the blowtube. The blowtube is a commercial steel pipe with a number of outlet orifices distributed along the longitudinal axis and centrally located above each filter. The cleaning system improvements have been achieved by advances in valve and blowtube design that have enabled increases in the peak pressures developed in the filters whilst minimising the response rate of the system to decrease the air consumption. The store of potential energy must be effectively and efficiently converted into kinetic energy to utilise the available energy to build pressure in the filter. Thus, by improving the RPJ cleaning system the operating costs associated with the compressors are reduced thereby decreasing the environmental impact of operating filter cleaning systems, to more efficiently remove particulate matter from fluid streams...|$|R
40|$|Ceramic filters have {{revealed}} {{to have good}} thermal resistance and chemical corrosion resistance, but they are brittle and lack of toughness, and liable to rupture under large temperature swings. Metallic filters with their high strength and toughness and good heat conduction ability have showed good thermal shock resistance, 310 S and FeAl intermetallic filter elements have exhibited additionally good chemical corrosion resistance in oxidizing and sulfidizing atmosphere(Sawada 1999 and Sunil et al. 1999). The behavior of metallic filter elements at high temperature was investigated and the filtration efficiency of the filter units for hot gas from a coal gasifier unit was tested. Pulse-jet cleaning of filter elements is a key component {{in the operation of}} the filtration unit. The pulse-jet is introduced into the filter element cavities from the clean side, and the <b>dust</b> <b>cakes</b> on the outer surfaces of the filter elements are detached and fall into the filter vessel. Sequential on-line cleaning of filter element groups yields a filter operation with no shutdown for filter regeneration. Development of advanced technologies in the design and operation of the pulse cleaning is one of the important tasks in order to increase the system reliability, to improve the filter life and to increase the filtering performance. The regeneration of filter element in gas filtration at high temperature plays a very important role for the operation of the process. Based on experimental observation and field operation, a numerical model is set up to numerically simulate the momentum and heat transport phenomena in the regeneration process, which is essential for understanding of the process, the optimization of process parameters and improvement of the design of the structure of venturi nozzle and the configuration of the apparatus...|$|R
5000|$|Snow powder (or snow sugar) is a non-melting form of {{icing sugar}} usually {{consisting}} of dextrose, starch and anti-binding agents, useful for retaining its structure when <b>dusted</b> onto <b>cakes</b> or pastries that require refrigeration.

Use of this sugar is for visual appeal without the sugar melting into the pastry from moisture. It is mostly used on baked goods that are slightly wet like fruit bars and tarts. It will not melt {{even if it is}} sprinkled on whipped cream or ice cream. Snow sugar is less sweet than regular powdered sugar because dextrose (a type of sugar made when starchy plants are broken down into monosaccharides using enzymes) around 205% less sweet than regular sugar.|$|R
50|$|Bags are cleaned by a {{short burst}} of {{compressed}} air injected through a common manifold over a row of bags. The compressed air is accelerated by a venturi nozzle mounted at the reverse-jet baghouse top of the bag. Since {{the duration of the}} compressed-air burst is short (0.1s), it acts as a rapidly moving air bubble, traveling through {{the entire length of the}} bag and causing the bag surfaces to flex. This flexing of the bags breaks the <b>dust</b> <b>cake,</b> and the dislodged dust falls into a storage hopper below.|$|E
50|$|Air flow {{gives the}} bag structure. Dirty air {{flows through the}} bag from the inside, {{allowing}} dust to collect on the interior surface. During cleaning, gas flow is restricted from a specific compartment. Without the flowing air, the bags relax. The cylindrical bag contains rings that prevent it from completely collapsing {{under the pressure of}} the air. A fan blows clean air in the reverse direction. The relaxation and reverse air flow cause the <b>dust</b> <b>cake</b> to crumble and release into the hopper. Upon the completion of the cleaning process, dirty air flow continues and the bag regains its shape.|$|E
50|$|This type of {{baghouse}} cleaning (also {{known as}} pressure-jet cleaning) {{is the most}} common. A high pressure blast of air is used to remove dust from the bag. The blast enters {{the top of the}} bag tube, temporarily ceasing the flow of dirty air. The shock of air causes a wave of expansion to travel down the fabric. The flexing of the bag shatters and discharges the <b>dust</b> <b>cake.</b> The air burst is about 0.1 second and it takes about 0.5 seconds for the shock wave to travel {{down the length of the}} bag. Due to its rapid release, the blast of air does not interfere with contaminated gas flow. Therefore, pulse-jet baghouses can operate continuously and are not usually compartmentalized. The blast of compressed air must be powerful enough to ensure that the shock wave will travel the entire length of the bag and fracture the dust cake.The efficiency of the cleaning system allows to have much higher gas to cloth ratio (or volumetric throughput of gas per unit area of filter) than shaking and reverse air bag filters. This kind of filter thus require smaller area to admit a same volume of air.|$|E
40|$|In South Africa, the {{ferrochromium}} industry produces approximately 100, 000 t {{bag house}} filter dust and slurry, while {{the stainless steel}} industry produces 24, 000 t of dust annually [17, 39]. The toxic substances in these wastes potentially {{pose a threat to}} the environment and human health, especially Cr (VI) due to its toxic, carcinogenic, highly soluble and strongly oxidizing properties. Therefore, the existence and treatment of wastes from stainless steel and ferrochrome production remain a challenge and an issue of concern. The increase of environmental legislation globally and the trend towards sustainable development are drives for alternatives to landfill. In the present thesis, the characteristics, formation mechanisms, leachability and stabilisation of the Cr (VI) -containing electric furnace <b>dust</b> and filter <b>cake</b> were investigated using various techniques such as XRD, XRF, TG/DTA, XPS, SEM-EDS, FT-IR, Raman spectrometer and UV/Vis spectrometer. The electric furnace <b>dust</b> and filter <b>cake</b> are very fine particles. Stainless steel dust forms by the entrainment of charge materials, evaporation or volatilisation of elements and ejection of slag and metal by spitting or the bursting of gas bubbles. It was found that ferrochrome dust is formed by the ejection of slag and metals droplets from the electrode hole, the entrainment of charge materials, vaporisation as well as the formation and precipitation of compounds from vaporised species in the off-gas duct. Filter cake contains crystal phases (CaF 2 and CaSO 4) and metal rich amorphous phases. It is formed due to super saturation and precipitation. Leaching experiments on the wastes showed that Cr (VI) rapidly leaches out by distilled water. Bricks were produced by mixing wastes (stainless steel plant dust, ferrochrome <b>dust</b> and filter <b>cake)</b> and clay. The optimum sinter parameter was found to be 1100 oC and 5 hours for a 50 wt% SPD- 50 wt% AS mixture in the brick. The leachability of Cr(VI) is strongly influenced by the mass%CaO/mass%SiO 2 ratio and alkali metal oxides content in the wastes. The emission factors from the stabilised wastes (SPD, FCD 1, FCD 2 and FC) are similar to those reported for the cement industry. Semi-dynamic leaching tests indicated that the predominant leaching mechanisms of chromium species are initial surface wash-off followed by matrix diffusion.

Experiments were conducted {{to evaluate the effectiveness}} ofEM in improving the organic materials in the soils and hence the nutrient content and the yield of maize. Two formulations of fertilizers were prepared: (i) quail dung, rice brain, Tongkat Ali, water, molasses, EM activation solution and (ii) quail dung, saw <b>dust,</b> palm kernel <b>cake,</b> zeolite water, molasses, EM activation solution. Pure soil was also use as control. The results showed that EM can increase the concentration of macronutrient and micronutrient for the quail dung following EM treatment compared to quail dung without EM treatment. The physical properties ofthe soils such as moisture and ash content have also been significantly increased with EM treatment. These results showed that EM positively increased the organic materials, nutrient content and the dry matter of the fertilizer. EM fermented compost has also promoted the health ofthe maize plant as all maize produced were free from visible nutritional deficiency symptoms. On the other hand, in the absence of EM, deficiency symptoms were found on the grains, ears corns and leaves of the maize plant. These results indicated that the application of EM promoted plant growth, grain yield and the photosynthetic activity of the maize by increasing root development and root activity. It was concluded that the incorporation of a mixture of EM intensified the biological soil activity and improved the physical and chemical soil properties, hence contributing healthier plant growth and development...|$|R

40|$|Effective high {{temperature}} ceramic filters are indispensable in the advanced, coal based power systems (IGCC and PFBC). To meet the environmental particulate emission requirements and improve thermal efficiency, ceramic filters are utilized to cleanup the hot gas particulate to protect downstream heat exchanger and gas turbine components from fouling and corrosion. The mechanical integrity of ceramic filters and an efficient <b>dust</b> <b>cake</b> removal system {{are the key}} issues for hot gas cleanup systems.

40|$|Actual {{operating}} {{results have been}} used to empirically determine the relationship between fabric filter (baghouse) differential pressure and stack gas flow in a reverse gas cleaned fabric filter. Assumptions are made that the tubesheet pressure drop is the sum of the pressure loss across the filter media and the <b>dust</b> <b>cake.</b> The <b>dust</b> <b>cake</b> is comprised of a component that remains on the bag after cleaning and a removable component that accumulates between cleaning cycles. The component that accumulates between cleaning is proportionate to the inlet dust concentration, the filter velocity and the time between cleaning. This relationship was examined with conventional fiberglass filter bags and with filter bags that have an ePTFE membrane laminated to the woven fiberglass. On average, the results show a 41 % decrease in fabric filter drag that allowed actual stack gas flow to increase by 5 % and baghouse pressure differential to decrease by 39 %. Results suggest the lower drag is attributable to improved ash removal from the bag during cleaning and not due to lower resistance through the filter media itself. Maximum electric power generation increased by 2. 8 % during the peak summer demand period due to the higher gas flow achieved with the ePTFE membrane bags. ...|$|E
40|$|AbstractThis paper {{describes}} possibilities {{to separate}} particles with difficult dust properties from gases. Difficult dust properties {{are related to}} extreme values of particle size and shape and to the flowability, the adhesion properties or the reactivity of the particles. Special emphasis is given to submicron particles. In cyclones, conductive particles such as diesel soot can be removed by means of additional electrostatic forces. Experimental investigations into wet tubular electrostatic precipitators show that the measured separation efficiencies are much higher than theoretically anticipated. This result is explained by higher particle charges than predicted by the existing charging models. For small flow rates where electrostatic precipitators are economically not feasible, {{a new type of}} wet scrubber may be an alternative. The critical issue of surface filters is the adhesion of the <b>dust</b> <b>cake</b> at the surface of the filter medium.

40|$|International audienceIt is {{currently}} admitted that for each filtration process using pleated filters, {{at least three}} steps can be distinguished: depth and surface filtration, which are common to flat filters, and surface reduction. This step is caused by inefficient filling of the pleat due to the filter geometry. For combustion aerosol, it has been proved that this third step strongly depends on the filtration velocity resulting in an increase of the resistance when air flow decreases. This observation leads one to think that Brownian diffusion, higher for low velocities, could influence the clogging dynamic of a pleated filter.

These measurements provided a description of filter medium behaviour during cleaning. It was found {{that a number of}} mechanisms cause <b>dust</b> <b>cake</b> dislodgement. Sudden movement of the medium, recorded over the full height of the filter element, is linked to intense shaking of the medium {{at the top of the}} bag and strong permeation of reverse airflow through the fabric at the bottom of the bag.

Filter medium properties changes, following gradual internal clogging, modify extensively the reaction of the bag during pulse-jet cleaning. A further innovative aspect of this experimental study is that impacts of main cleaning parameter and filtration operating condition were investigated using the same test equipment. The number of results represents a significant contribution to understanding pulse-jet cleaning phenomena.

Hot filtration experiments up to 7 hours were performed with beech wood as feedstock. It was possible to produce fast pyrolysis oils with a solid content below 0. 01 wt%. The additional residence time of the pyrolysis vapours and secondary vapour cracking on the filter cake caused an increase of non-condensable gases {{at the expense of}} organic liquid yield. The oils produced with hot filtration showed superior quality properties regarding viscosity than standard pyrolysis oils. The oils were analysed by rotational viscosimetry and gel permeation chromatography before and after accelerated aging. During filtration the separated particulates accumulate on the candle surface and build up the filter cake. The filter cake leads to an increase in pressure drop between the raw gas and the clean gas side of the filter candle. At a certain pressure drop the filter cake has to be removed by reverse pulse cleaning to regenerate the pressure drop. The experiments showed that successful pressure drop recovery was possible during the initial filtration cycles, thereafter further cycles showed minor pressure drop recovery and therefore a steady increase in differential pressure. Filtration with pre-coating the candle to form an additional layer between the filter candle and cake resulted in total removal of the <b>dust</b> <b>cake.</b> EThOS - Electronic Theses Online ServiceGBUnited Kingdo...|$|E
40|$|The {{main purpose}} of {{developing}} high temperature gas cleaning technologies are to clean the gas under high temperature {{in order to be}} cost effective and to improve energy efficiency. Moving granular bed filters are technically and economically applicable for high temperature cleaning system because of low cost, possible to keep operation at a constant pressure drop, simple structure, easy in operation and maintenance, no high risk internals, and more tolerant to process thermal flow. Energy and Resource Laboratories, Taiwan Industrial Technology Research Institute (ERL/ITRI) has been developing a moving granular bed filter (MGBF) for BIGCC(Biomass Integrated Gasification Combined Cycle) high temperature gas cleanup. The filter granules move downwards directed by louver-like guide plates and the hot gases penetrate the MGBF horizontally. Filtration mechanisms include collection of the <b>dust</b> <b>cake</b> over the bed media surface and deep bed filtration. Stagnant zones of filter granules combining with the dusts always exist along the louver walls. Such stagnant zones often corrode the louver-like guide plates, increase the system pressure drop and decrease the total reaction efficiency that may endanger MGBF operation. Series louver and inert structure research that modify the granular flow pattern have been designed to eliminate the formation of these stagnant zones. By connecting to an auxiliary dust/bed media separation system, MGBF can be operated continuously at a stable pressure drop with a stable high efficiency. There are several MGBF R&D activities in progress: (1) a 3 -dimensional cold flow system for testing the MGBF filtration efficiency; (2) a high temperature gas cleanup experimental system that has been designed and installed; (3) a 2 -dimensional flow pattern experimental system for approving design concepts...|$|E
