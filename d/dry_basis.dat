50|$|The {{nutrient}} or {{mineral content}} of foods, animal feeds or plant tissues are often expressed on a <b>dry</b> matter <b>basis,</b> i.e. as {{a proportion of}} the total dry matter in the material. For example a 138-gram apple contains 84% water (116 g water and 22 g dry matter per apple). The potassium content is 0.72% on a <b>dry</b> matter <b>basis,</b> i.e. 0.72% of the dry matter is potassium. The apple, therefore, contains 158 mg potassium (0.72/100 X 22 g). Dried apple contains the same concentration of potassium on a <b>dry</b> matter <b>basis</b> (0.72%), but is only 32% water (68% dry matter). So 138 g of dried apple contains 93.8 g dry matter and 675 mg potassium (0.72/100 x 93.8 g).|$|R

40|$|An {{innovative}} {{process to}} add value to a corn-to-ethanol co-product, Thin stillage, was studied for pilot-scale viability. A 1500 L bioreactor was designed, operated, and optimized to cultivate Rhizopus microsporus var. oligosporus via submersed fermentation in Thin Stillage. The biomass was harvested and processed into a feed suitable for storage and ultimately for animal feeding trials. Characterization of the biomass and feed trials revealed {{that there is}} substantial potential as a nutrient dense feed supplement with 41. 1 % protein, 26. 3 % fat, and metabolizable energy on s <b>dried</b> <b>basis.</b> The amino acid profile is superior to that of DDGS, with most notably 1. 7 % Lys on <b>dried</b> <b>basis.</b> This process produces a significantly more nutrient dense product than DDGS, and could increase water-reclaimation in a dry-grind corn to ethanol plant. Industrially it would replace the energy intensive process of converting thin stillage into syrup that adds only $ 10 - 25 /ton to DDG, while maintaining production of DDG. Using thin stillage as used a growth media for R. microsporus var. oligosporus, should not only lead to saving in energy costs, but also generate a high-value co-product {{which could lead to}} economic gains. Also there is still unexplored potential of enzymes, chitin, and co-culturing to further add value...|$|R

The study focused on the proximate composition of Labeo bata both in moisture and <b>dry</b> matter <b>basis.</b> The established AOAC (Association of Official Agricultural Chemist, USA) methods were followed for nutrient composition of fish. In case of moisture basis the percentage of moisture, protein, lipid, ash and carbohydrate was 72. 41 ± 0. 81, 18. 51 ± 0. 31, 3. 79 ± 0. 25, 4. 67 ± 0. 18, 0. 90 ± 0. 03, respectively, while in <b>dry</b> matter <b>basis</b> it was 27. 64 ± 0. 17, 66. 75 ± 0. 39, 13. 44 ± 0. 08, 16. 63 ± 0. 20, 3. 51 ± 0. 17, respectively.
