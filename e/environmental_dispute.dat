Therefore, it is important {{to evaluate the effectiveness of}} environmental ADR empirically. However, the majority of empirical literature of environmental ADR provides merely descriptive case studies. Using a large micro-level database from Japan, this paper identifies the characteristics of pollution disputes addressed by ADR and correlates those characteristics to the duration of disputes. Using the strike analysis for reference, we estimate the standard duration models of environmental ADR. The analyses demonstrate that pollution disputes involving health damage are resolved promptly. Air pollution problems affecting multiple households are also expeditiously resolved. Moreover, we find that representative actions prolong the settlement of <b>environmental</b> <b>disputes.</b> <b>Environmental</b> <b>disputes</b> Alternative dispute resolution Duration analysis...|$|R

Since 1989, when the <b>Environmental</b> <b>Dispute</b> Resolution Fund was established, it has provided over $4 million in grants, which have helped support and resolve more than 500 legal cases in British Columbia. In one such case marine biologist and fish farm activist, Alexandra Morton, used funding from West Coast Environmental Law, to successful challenge the constitutionality of allowing fish farms in British Columbia.

With the environmentalists' new constitutional standing, Con Ed envisioned costly litigation ahead. In 1980, Con Ed sought a settlement accord, resulting in the Hudson River Peace Treaty. This agreement cancelled the hydropower plant, mandated the land become a park and forced Con Ed to donate $12 million to endow a Hudson River Foundation to study the river. Con Ed was spared costs of constructing infrastructure at Indian Point to solve the fish intake problem, but had to research alternative solutions to reduce fish kills.

The Elwha settlement was extremely fortunate that one of the major players in the negotiations, Daishowa America, chose to be represented in Washington by Terry Bracy. Terry had been Mo Udall’s chief of staff. Terry knows exactly how Capitol Hill works. Terry was a creature of the House, but he knew the Senate equally well and was a true master of the legislative process. He was smart, intuitive, trustworthy, and knew his business. He had the unenviable job of explaining Congress to a foreign-owned paper company, and convincing very skeptical business people that their interest lay in a deal that would separate their mill from the generators that fed it power. For most of the last 20 years since the settlement, Terry has chaired the Udall foundation, the premier grantor of college scholarships for Native Americans, and as Chair led the establishment of the U.S. Institute for Environmental Conflict Resolution. I’ve heard him say that the Elwha settlement was a major inspiration for the creation of what is now the nations’ most prestigious and successful <b>environmental</b> <b>dispute</b> resolution center.

On the basis 4 of several cases in which mediation or mediation-type activities were used to resolve the environmental conflict I want to show why, in the end, environmental mediation probably will never be so widespread in Switzerland as it is in other countries. The paragraph ends with a case study about mediation experiences in Switzerland over nuclear waste disposal. Nevertheless, this aforementioned case study shows that the Swiss decision-making system offers a good basis for mediation procedures in areas of politics where there is yet little participation as longs as certain preconditions for a successful procedure are fulfilled. In paragraph D I deal with the use of mediation in South Africa to resolve <b>environmental</b> <b>disputes.</b> The focus shifts in a first step on the National Environmental Management Act (NEMA), especially Chapter 4 NEMA which deals with Alternative Dispute Resolution and, in particular, with environmental mediation. In a next step I examine if this Chapter has been already implemented or if there is still a big gap between theory and practice.
