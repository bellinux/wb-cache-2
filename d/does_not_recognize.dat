5|$|By {{the time}} Longwang made landfall, 37shelters opened across the island, {{accommodating}} nearly 1,000people. Additionally, 5,464Chinese fishermen temporarily sheltered at Taiwanese ports. All airports were closed on October2 and sea travel was suspended. With international airports shut down, President Chen, who was {{returning from a}} visit to the United Arab Emirates, was forced to land in Indonesia. The landing in Indonesia was seen as a political breakthrough for Taiwan as Indonesia <b>does</b> <b>not</b> <b>recognize</b> them as a separate nation from China.|$|E

Sterling Williams, a black shoeshine man in the French Quarter whom Griffin regarded as a casual friend, <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>recognize</b> him. Because Griffin wanted assistance in entering into the black community, he decided to tell Sterling about his identity and project. He first hinted that he wore the same unusual shoes as somebody else, but Sterling still <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>recognize</b> him until Griffin told him.|$|R

5|$|D: Paul Muni's {{performance}} in Black Fury was not {{nominated for an}} Oscar. For two years only, the Academy allowed a write-in vote. Technically, this meant that any performance was eligible for the award.

Muni came 2nd in the vote; however, the Academy <b>does</b> <b>not</b> <b>recognize</b> Davis or Muni as nominees in these years.|$|E
5|$|For example, Erik Pogosyants {{composed}} the study at right, with White {{to play and}} win. His intended main line was 1. Ne3 Rxh2 2. 0-0-0#! A tablebase discovered that 1. h4 also wins for White in 33 moves, even though Black can capture the pawn (which {{is not the best}} move – in case of capturing the pawn black loses in 21 moves, while Kh1-g2 loses in 32 moves). Incidentally, the tablebase <b>does</b> <b>not</b> <b>recognize</b> the composer's solution because it includes castling.|$|E

5|$|Several {{branches}} of creationism, including creation science, neo-creationism, and intelligent design, {{argue that the}} idea of life being directly designed by a god or intelligence is at least as scientific as evolutionary theory, and should therefore be taught in public education. Such arguments against evolution have become widespread and include objections to evolution's evidence, methodology, plausibility, morality, and scientific acceptance. The scientific community <b>does</b> <b>not</b> <b>recognize</b> such objections as valid, pointing to detractors' misinterpretations of such things as the scientific method, evidence, and basic physical laws.|$|E
5|$|The High Court {{also held}} that the orders were neither irrational nor disproportionate. The order banning all WTBTS {{publications}} was reasonable {{as it would be}} administratively impossible to monitor any order other than a blanket ban. As for the deregistration order, the Court accepted that the Jehovah's Witnesses' refusal to perform national service prejudiced national security, and was thus appropriately issued in the interest of public order. The Court noted that Singapore's administrative law <b>does</b> <b>not</b> <b>recognize</b> proportionality as a distinct ground of judicial review.|$|E

5|$|For a subplot, Chaplin first {{considered}} a character even {{lower on the}} social scale, a black newsboy. Eventually he opted for a drunken millionaire, a character previously used in the 1921 short The Idle Class. The millionaire plot {{was based on an}} old idea Chaplin had for a short in which two millionaires pick up the Little Tramp from the city dump and show him a good time in expensive clubs before dropping him back off at the dump, so when he woke up, the Tramp would not know if it was real or a dream. This was rewritten into a millionaire who is a friend of the Tramp when drunk but <b>does</b> <b>not</b> <b>recognize</b> him when sober.|$|E

Although the four still retain an adult mind, the crew have trouble taking them seriously, and Picard (David Tristan Birkin) is convinced by Dr. Beverly Crusher (Gates McFadden) to temporarily relinquish command of the ship. After turning over command of the Enterprise to Commander William Riker, Picard ponders resigning his Starfleet commission, albeit temporarily, in order to pursue other interests. Meanwhile, Keiko (Caroline Junko King) is dismayed by her husband Miles's (Colm Meaney) reluctance {{to be with her}} and is further saddened her daughter (Hana Hatae) <b>does</b> <b>not</b> <b>recognize</b> her.

5|$|If {{the player}} instead waits, the cabin gets transported to Aosagi Island. Yomogi, Mayuzumi, and Cocoro avoid the {{avalanche}} that was {{mentioned in the}} newspaper. The Yuni from 2011 is left at Akakura to be rescued by the rescue team in 2011, and to go to SPHIA in 2012 to repeat the loop, making sure that Cocoro, Yomogi, and Mayuzumi survive the week. Satoru reviews his theory regarding Inubushi; he thinks that she, too, was experiencing the transfer phenomenon, and that her consciousness ended up at Mount Akakura in the dying body of Hotori. He thinks the consciousness of Hotori inhabited Inubushi's body, rendering it free of homicidal tendencies, but realizes that since both his and Inubushi's consciousnesses remain at the island, Hotori cannot occupy Inubushi's body when he occupies his; Cocoro runs towards Inubushi, who is holding Utsumi's infant child {{over the edge of}} a cliff while singing. The game ends with Satoru meeting Mayuzumi, who says she <b>does</b> <b>not</b> <b>recognize</b> him.|$|E
