John Leeds Barroll argues in his cultural biography of Anne that her political interventions in Scotland were more significant, and certainly more troublesome, than previously noticed; and Clare McManus, among other cultural historians, has highlighted Anne's influential role in the Jacobean cultural flowering, not only as a patron of writers and artists but as a performer herself.|$|E

In 1990, 63% of the Asian Americans identified as Christians, while in 2001 only 43% did. This development <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>accompanied</b> by a rise in traditional Asian religions, with the people identifying with them doubling during the same decade.|$|E
