5|$|Commercially navigable only at its mouth, the Saw Mill River {{itself was}} useless {{as a way}} to bring crops to market, {{limiting}} settlement further upriver. Nevertheless, the roots of present-day communities along the river were established during the colonial era. In 1695, a land agent named Isaac See settled at the north bound of Philipse Manor, <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>flat</b> land between a bend in the river. Other farmers came to the area, and the settlement ultimately became today's village of Pleasantville.|$|E
5|$|In 1951, Shaughnessy {{was rumored}} as a {{candidate}} for the vacant Washington Redskins head coaching job, but nothing came of it. From 1951 to 1962, Shaughnessy served {{on the staff of the}} Chicago Bears as a technical advisor, vice president, and defensive specialist. Halas retained responsibility for the offense, including the Bears' T formation. Ironically, Shaughnessy was tasked with developing a defense to counter the T formation. One of his solutions was the 5–3–3 defense, which left outside linebackers available to defend against end runs and passes <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>flat.</b>|$|E
5|$|Sir Robert Menzies, the Australian politician, {{became the}} Lord Warden in 1965 and visited the castle {{on an annual}} basis, staying <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>flat</b> there.

This required moving furniture, silverware and other furnishings from London and caused difficulties for English Heritage, who managed the property. The current Lord Warden, Admiral the Lord Boyce, took up his post in 2004.|$|E

5|$|An inquest {{was held}} on 22 December; the jury could not {{determine}} whether the death was accidental or suicide and an open verdict was returned.

Shortly after half past midnight, Reardon contacted the police and Yeates' parents to report her missing.|$|E

5|$|Bedsitcom {{documented}} {{the lives of}} six young adults living in a loft flat in London. Eight episodes in total were created, which {{were divided into two}} distinct halves. The first four episodes centred on the lives of Mel, Paul and Rufus, the three actors, as they lived <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>flat</b> with Bob, Dave and Shirine, the three unaware members of the public who believed they were taking part in a genuine reality TV show. After Bob, Dave and Shirine had learnt {{the true nature of the}} show at the end of episode four, they moved out and were replaced by three new members of the public named Barrington, David and Jessica.

These six contestants {{were told that they}} would be starring in a new reality TV series called Making Friends, and featured on the show three at a time over a period of eight weeks. The programme ran for a single series of eight episodes and featured various storylines, involving dead goldfish, dodgy dealings, promiscuous mothers and telephone psychics.|$|E
5|$|Both were arrested, with Lennon {{pleading}} guilty to hashish possession, absolving Ono, who miscarried not long after. Lennon was fined £150 ($360).

He was {{convicted and sentenced to}} four years imprisonment. After the raid, the landlord sought an injunction against Starr on 19February1969, forbidding anyone but Starr or his family to live there, and allowing no music or instruments to be played. Starr appealed, and a compromise was offered; only Starr or a family member would live <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>flat.</b> To finally settle the case, Starr sold the lease on 28February1969.|$|E

Anthony Hardy, a mentally ill alcoholic who lived <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>flat</b> in which her body was found locked in a bedroom, later murdered two women and placed their body parts in bin bags.

5|$|Investigators {{determined}} Yeates {{had spent}} the evening of 17 December 2010 with colleagues at the Bristol Ram pub on Park Street, leaving at around 8:00pm to begin the 30-minute walk home.

Yeates was seen on closed-circuit television (CCTV) at around 8:10pm leaving a Waitrose supermarket without purchasing anything. She phoned her best friend, Rebecca Scott, at 8:30pm to arrange a meeting on Christmas Eve. The last known footage of Yeates recorded her buying a pizza from a branch of Tesco Express at around 8:40pm.

5|$|On {{the morning}} of 20 January, the Avon and Somerset Constabulary arrested 32-year-old Dutch {{engineer}} Vincent Tabak, who lived with his girlfriend <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>flat</b> next door to Yeates. However, authorities declined to reveal additional details while the suspect was being interrogated due to concerns over controversial media coverage of Jefferies' arrest, which had breached the rules governing what can be reported when an individual is arrested. The Tabak arrest followed an anonymous tip from a female caller, shortly after a televised appeal by Yeates' parents on Crimewatch. Canynge Road was closed by police while scaffolding was constructed around Yeates' home; and officers sealed off Tabak's adjacent flat. Investigators also searched the nearby townhouse of a friend, where Tabak was {{believed to have been}} staying, about a mile away.

One pre-race analysis viewed Petacchi's 2007 Giro and season as a chance at redemption for him.
