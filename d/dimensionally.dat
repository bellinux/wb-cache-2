5|$|There {{has been}} {{significant}} controversy regarding Holden's decision {{to retain the}} Commodore name for the 2018 model, despite it being <b>dimensionally</b> smaller than its predecessor, lacking a V8 engine option and switching from a RWD to a FWD drivetrain. Whilst the decision has been {{considered to be a}} safe choice in order to preserve sales, the retention of the Commodore name has been critiqued for Holden missing the opportunity to rebrand its sedan range and push its offering into the more lucrative semi-premium end of the market.|$|E
5|$|Dragon Quest VII is {{best known}} for its huge size. Without {{completing}} the game's side quests, a single game of Dragon Quest VII can take a hundred hours or more. In terms of gameplay, not much has changed from previous installments; battles are still fought in a turn-based mode from a first person perspective. Although non-battle sequences are rendered in 3D, battles themselves are still portrayed two <b>dimensionally.</b> The ability to talk with the party characters in and outside of battles was added to this game. They offer advice about battle strategies and plot points, or simply comment on how they feel at a given moment. There are four ways and means of locomotion: feet, boat, magic carpet, and skystone. Each of these can move across different terrain.|$|E
5|$|When {{thermoplastics}} are moulded, typically pelletised {{raw material}} is fed through a hopper into a heated barrel with a reciprocating screw. Upon {{entrance to the}} barrel, the temperature increases and the Van der Waals forces that resist relative flow of individual chains are weakened {{as a result of}} increased space between molecules at higher thermal energy states. This process reduces its viscosity, which enables the polymer to flow with the driving force of the injection unit. The screw delivers the raw material forward, mixes and homogenises the thermal and viscous distributions of the polymer, and reduces the required heating time by mechanically shearing the material and adding a significant amount of frictional heating to the polymer. The material feeds forward through a check valve and collects {{at the front of the}} screw into a volume known as a shot. A shot is the volume of material that is used to fill the mould cavity, compensate for shrinkage, and provide a cushion (approximately 10% of the total shot volume, which remains in the barrel and prevents the screw from bottoming out) to transfer pressure from the screw to the mould cavity. When enough material has gathered, the material is forced at high pressure and velocity into the part forming cavity. To prevent spikes in pressure, the process normally uses a transfer position corresponding to a 95–98% full cavity where the screw shifts from a constant velocity to a constant pressure control. Often injection times are well under 1 second. Once the screw reaches the transfer position the packing pressure is applied, which completes mould filling and compensates for thermal shrinkage, which is quite high for thermoplastics relative to many other materials. The packing pressure is applied until the gate (cavity entrance) solidifies. Due to its small size, the gate is normally the first place to solidify through its entire thickness. Once the gate solidifies, no more material can enter the cavity; accordingly, the screw reciprocates and acquires material for the next cycle while the material within the mould cools so that it can be ejected and be <b>dimensionally</b> stable. This cooling duration is dramatically reduced by the use of cooling lines circulating water or oil from an external temperature controller. Once the required temperature has been achieved, the mould opens and an array of pins, sleeves, strippers, etc. are driven forward to demould the article. Then, the mould closes and the process is repeated.|$|E
25|$|The {{magnitude}} {{of the components of}} a vector are to be considered <b>dimensionally</b> distinct. For example, rather than an undifferentiated length dimension L, we may have L represent dimension in the x-direction, and so forth. This requirement stems ultimately from the requirement that each component of a physically meaningful equation (scalar, vector, or tensor) must be <b>dimensionally</b> consistent.|$|E

25|$|Also, {{the unit}} newton metre is <b>dimensionally</b> {{equivalent}} to the joule, which is the unit of energy. However, {{in the case of}} torque, the unit is assigned to a vector, whereas for energy, it is assigned to a scalar.|$|E

25|$|The <b>dimensionally</b> {{equivalent}} newton-metre (N⋅m) {{is sometimes}} {{used as the}} measuring unit for work, but this can {{be confused with the}} unit newton-metre, which is the measurement unit of torque. Usage of N⋅m is discouraged by the SI authority, since it can lead to confusion as to whether the quantity expressed in newton metres is a torque measurement, or a measurement of work.|$|E
25|$|The Ruger SR40c {{started to}} ship in June 2011. Like the SR9c {{is to the}} SR9, the SR40c is a compact version of the SR40. It is <b>dimensionally</b> equal to the SR9c; and unlike the SR40 is to the SR9, it also weighs the same. The SR40c ships {{standard}} with a 9-round magazine with an optional extended baseplate, {{as well as a}} full-size 15-round SR40 magazine with a removable sleeve. In jurisdictions that prohibit large-capacity magazines, it ships with two 9-round magazines and two extended baseplates instead.|$|E
25|$|This {{casting process}} is {{advantageous}} for very complex castings, that would regularly require cores. It is also <b>dimensionally</b> accurate, requires no draft, {{and has no}} parting lines so no flash is formed. As compared to investment casting, it is cheaper {{because it is a}} simpler process and the foam is cheaper than the wax. Risers are not usually required {{due to the nature of}} the process; because the molten metal vaporizes the foam the first metal into the mold cools more quickly than the rest, which results in natural directional solidification.|$|E
25|$|Since work {{function}} is normally given in electronvolts (eV), {{and it is}} often convenient to measure fields in volts per nanometer (V/nm), values of most universal constants are given here in units involving the eV, V and nm. Increasingly, this is normal practice in field emission research. However, all equations here are ISQ-compatible equations and remain <b>dimensionally</b> consistent, as is required by the modern international system. To indicate their status, numerical values of universal constants are given to seven significant figures. Values are derived using the 2006 values of the fundamental constants.|$|E
25|$|Two other {{well-known}} {{projects of}} the artist were developed {{in cooperation with the}} agency Jung von Matt/Next for tagged in motion and nextwall. For the project nextwall DAIM and other graffiti artists created a mural. Later interactive elements such as QR Codes and object recognition were inserted that allowed to transfer information to mobile devices. Tagged in motion meanwhile was an experiment to connect augmented reality and graffiti. With 3D- glasses it was possible for Mirko Reisser to spray his works into space and watch them three <b>dimensionally.</b> The video on YouTube achieved over 500.000 clicks within the first few days.|$|E
25|$|The heavy, {{close-grained}} yellow-orange wood is very {{dense and}} is prized for tool handles, treenails, fence posts, and other applications requiring a strong <b>dimensionally</b> stable wood that withstands rot. Although its wood is commonly knotty and twisted, straight-grained Osage orange timber makes very good bows. In Arkansas, {{in the early}} 19th century, a good Osage bow was worth a horse and a blanket. Additionally, a yellow-orange dye can be extracted from the wood, {{which can be used}} as a substitute for fustic and aniline dyes. At present, florists use the fruits of M. pomifera for decorative purposes.|$|E
25|$|The 747-400F has a {{main deck}} nose {{door and a}} {{mechanized}} cargo handling system. The nose door swings up so that pallets or containers up to 40ft (12 m) can be loaded straight in on motor-driven rollers. An optional main deck side cargo door (like the 747-400M (Combi)) allows loading of <b>dimensionally</b> taller cargo modules. A lower deck ("belly") side door allows loading of unit load devices (ULD) up to 163cm in height. Boeing delivered 126 Boeing 747-400F aircraft with no unfilled orders as of November 2009. The last −400F was delivered to Nippon Cargo Airlines on August 2, 2008.|$|E
25|$|Sodium {{borosilicate}} glass, Pyrex: silica + boron trioxide (B2O3) + soda (Na2O) + alumina (Al2O3). Stands {{heat expansion}} {{much better than}} window glass. Used for chemical glassware, cooking glass, car head lamps, etc. Borosilicate glasses (e.g. Pyrex, Duran) have as main constituents silica and boron trioxide. They have fairly low coefficients of thermal expansion (7740 Pyrex CTE is 3.25/°C as compared to about 9/°C for a typical soda-lime glass), making them more <b>dimensionally</b> stable. The lower {{coefficient of thermal expansion}} (CTE) also makes them less subject to stress caused by thermal expansion, thus less vulnerable to cracking from thermal shock. They are commonly used for reagent bottles, optical components and household cookware.|$|E
25|$|The {{original}} Contender is {{now known}} as the generation one (G1) Contender and was replaced by the G2 Contender in 1998. The new design is <b>dimensionally</b> the same as the original Contender, but uses an Encore-style trigger group. Due to the changes in the trigger mechanism, and to differences in the angle of the grip relative to the boreline of the gun, the buttstocks and pistol grips are different between the G1 and G2 Contenders and will not interchange. The G2 uses essentially the same barrels and fore-ends as the original Contender and barrels will interchange, with the only two exceptions being the G2 muzzleloading barrels, which will only fit the G2 frame, and the Herrett barrels/fore-ends, which are specific for use only on a G1 frame.|$|E

500|$|In 1934, Walt Disney {{gathered}} {{several key}} {{staff members and}} announced his plans to make his first feature animated film. Despite derision {{from most of the}} film industry, who dubbed the production [...] "Disney's Folly," [...] Disney proceeded undaunted into the production of Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs, which would become the first animated feature in English and Technicolor. Considerable training and development went into the production of Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs, and the studio greatly expanded with established animators, artists from other fields, and recent college graduates joining the studio to work on the film. The training classes, supervised by the head animators such as Les Clark, Norm Ferguson, and Art Babbit and taught by Donald W. Graham, an art teacher from the nearby Chouinard Art Institute, had begun at the studio in 1932 and were greatly expanded into orientation training and continuing education classes. In the course of teaching the classes, Graham and the animators created or formalized many of the techniques and processes that became the key tenets and principles of traditional animation. Silly Symphonies such as The Goddess of Spring (1934) and The Old Mill (1937) served as experimentation grounds for new techniques such as the animation of realistic human figures, special effects animation, the use of the multiplane camera, an invention which split animation artwork layers into several planes, allowing the camera to appear to move <b>dimensionally</b> through an animated scene.|$|E
500|$|Sustainability {{of such a}} tall {{building}} {{would include}} issues such as vertical transportation limitations, with elevators only {{being able to go}} so far, building sway, caused by wind, and supercolumn settling, which occurs because concrete tends to shrink as it hydrates and settles under load, whereas steel is <b>dimensionally</b> stable, thereby causing the floors to become unlevel. Additionally, a very large core size is required in very tall buildings to support the structure as well as to house the large number of elevators needed. The core size consumes a significant amount of the space on the lower and middle floors. One of the ways Jeddah Tower attempts to overcome these issues is with its smooth, sloped-exterior design, which, although more expensive to build, offers superior aerodynamic performance over [...] "stepped" [...] designs such as the Burj Khalifa, allowing it to have a more conservative core overall. This was determined by wind tunnel tests performed at Burj Khalifa. Jeddah Tower will also utilize copious stiffening materials to prevent the excessive sway that would otherwise make the occupants of upper floors nauseated on windy days, including very high strength concrete that will be up to several metres thick in certain parts of the core. This, along with the highly integrated steel frame and shear walls, is also intended to prevent catastrophic failure of the structure {{in the event of a}} terrorist attack. Traditionally, the space consumed by elevators was considered to make a building become increasingly less profitable past 80 floors or so. More recently, it has been the advent of truly mixed-use design such as Shanghai Tower and Burj Khalifa, as well as improved building technology, that have outdated this rule of thumb, which generally applied to single use buildings.|$|E
500|$|In late 1977, Koubek also {{completed}} the Camden Yards Sports Complex master site plan, which laid out projected baseball and football stadiums, museums, restaurants, and retail shopping buildings {{in an attempt}} to revitalized the economically depressed Camden Yards area of downtown Baltimore. In September 1978, Koubek was commissioned to design an addition to the American Security Bank operations center at 635 Massachusetts Avenue NW. (National Public Radio purchased the building in 1992, but sold the black-glass and travertine marble structure to Boston Properties in 2008. After the broadcaster's new building at 1111 North Capitol Street was completed in 2013, Boston Properties tore down 635 Massachusetts Avenue. A Class A office building will be erected in its place by 2015.) Also in 1978, Koubek's 22-story Virginia Electric and Power Company headquarters in Richmond also opened. (It is now known as One James River Plaza.) In March 1979, Koubek agreed to design the interior renovations to the East Capitol Street Car Barn, an 83-year-old trolley barn at 14th and East Capitol Streets NE listed on the National Register of Historic Places, turning the old industrial site into a $10 million apartment and condominium complex. The renovation was called [...] "striking". Koubek also participated in the redevelopment of Vermont Avenue NW. [...] In June 1979, as buildings were razed across the street for the construction of 1090 Vermont Avenue, he was commissioned by the D.C. chapter of the American Medical Association to build a Modernist 12-story office building at 1100 Vermont Avenue NW. A month later, construction began on Koubek's Spring Valley Center, a luxury shopping, restaurant, and office building located at 4801 Massachusetts Avenue NW (on the site of the old Apex Theater). The six-story post-Modernist brick structure was not well received. In 1998, one critic noted that it is [...] "a structure easy to dislike. Clad in brick and encircled by horizontal window bands, it [...] volumetrically and <b>dimensionally</b> out of scale with its more domestically scaled neighbors. Unrelieved planar walls and minimalist detailing made it even less charming."
