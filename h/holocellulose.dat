30|$|The {{degradation}} of hemicelluloses {{and the relative}} increasing in lignin content explain the decrease in water absorption {{and the increase in}} wood hydrophobicity. It was well known that the <b>holocelluloses</b> (hemicellulose and cellulose) exhibit white color, while the lignin has dark brown color. Thus, the increase in lignin proportion deepens the color of the wood surface after THM treatment. This phenomenon is attributed to the combined effect of heating and pressure during THM process.

Here, high-pressure homogenizers, microfluidizers, ultrafine friction grinders (i.e., Super Masscolloiders®), high-speed blenders, aqueous counter-collision [18], and twin screw-type extruders were used for nanofibrillation, in some cases with thermo-plastics used as fibrillation media instead of water. Each apparatus has both advantageous and disadvantageous points in terms of nanofibrillation efficiency, depending on the targeted nanofibrillation level and also the pretreatments applied to the original wood cellulose. Characteristics and potential applications of the NFCs thus obtained were evaluated in terms of mechanical strengths, optical transparency, and thermal stability as composites prepared with acrylic resins and other thermo-plastics [12 – 17, 19 – 27]. Not only composites, but also some NFC-based hydrogels prepared by alkali treatment had unique properties [28, 29]. The presence of hemicelluloses in wood pulps and <b>holocelluloses</b> enhances the degree of nanofibrillation of NFCs during the mechanical disintegration treatment in water, primarily because carboxyl groups present in hemicelluloses bring about electrostatic repulsion between cellulose microfibrils in water [11, 15 – 17]. When the number of grinding treatment of wood cellulose in water was increased, the degrees of both polymerization and cellulose I crystallinity decreased to some extent, resulting in clear decreases in mechanical strength and thermal stability of NFC-containing composite films [14].|$|R

A room-temperature electron spin resonance spectroscopy study was conducted on original wood, herbaceous biomass, <b>holocelluloses,</b> lignin and their chars, prepared at high temperatures in a wire mesh reactor, an entrained flow reactor, and a tubular reactor. The radical concentrations in the chars from the decay stage range up between 7 · 1016 and 1. 5 · 1018 spins g− 1. The {{results indicated that the}} biomass major constituents (cellulose, hemicellulose, lignin) had a minor effect on remaining radical concentrations compared to potassium and silica contents. The higher radical concentrations in the wheat straw chars from the decay stage of pyrolysis in the entrained flow reactor compared to the wood chars were related to the decreased mobility of potassium in the char matrix, leading to the less efficient catalytic effects of potassium on the bond-breaking and radical re-attachments. The high Si levels in the rice husk caused an increase in the char radical concentration compared to the wheat straw because the free radicals were trapped in a char consisting of a molten amorphous silica at heating rates of 103 – 104  K s− 1.

40|$|The present {{invention}} is {{a process}} for treating a feedstock comprising <b>holocellulose.</b> The process comprises mixing the feedstock with a solution comprising cellulose binding domains to form a mixture. The mixture is then subjected to conditions sufficient to reduce the crystallinity of <b>holocellulose.</b> Subsequent enzymatic hydrolysis may show an improved rate and/or fermentable sugar yield as compared to processes which do not employ the process.

30|$|The <b>holocellulose</b> {{fraction}} {{was prepared}} using sodium chlorite [15]. The required volumes and weights of components were scaled to the sample mass. The <b>holocellulose</b> fraction was collected by centrifugation and the precipitate was extracted with 10  % sodium hydroxide for 16  h at room temperature. The concentration of <b>holocellulose</b> in the alkaline solution was determined from an approximately 45  % recovery of <b>holocellulose</b> from the starting powder {{in a preliminary}} experiment. Insoluble material in the extract was removed by centrifugation and the supernatant was neutralized with dilute hydrochloric acid. The neutralized solution was dialyzed against deionized water using dialysis tubing (molecular weight cut off 3500; Fisher Scientific). The dialyzed solution was mixed with 4 volumes of ethanol (80  % ethanol), and after centrifugation the precipitate was freeze-dried and designated as the hemicellulose fraction (AHC) from P. densiflora leaves. AHC was suspended in the cold water (2  %, w/v) and stirred to separate the water-soluble fraction (AHC-X) from the water-insoluble fraction (AHC-M). Subsequently, AHC-X and AHC-M fractions were separated by centrifugation and freeze-dried.|$|E
30|$|We {{could see}} that rice straw {{contained}} 56.02  % of <b>holocellulose</b> and 14.00  % of lignin and lignin content reduced to 5.77  % in <b>holocellulose</b> after pretreatment. In other words, the delaminating rate of lignin reached as high as 58.79  % with the pretreatment of SO 3 micro-thermal explosion. As shown in Table  1, the change of hemicellulose content of rice straw before and after pretreatment was minor, what is mean xylose content could be equal after hydrolyzing. Besides, the content of water and ash was reduced to 6.60 and 1.38  %, respectively. This phenomenon was because that the small molecule or soluble substances were vaporized and washed. The <b>holocellulose</b> content increased to 86.17  %, which is predominantly attributed to the decrease of lignin, water and ash. This outcome would be conductive to enzymatic hydrolyzing by cellulase to obtain more available sugars.|$|E
30|$|Contents of cellulose, hemicellulose, pectin, {{crystalline}} cellulose, and non-cellulosic monosaccharide {{were performed}} {{in compliance with}} a previous study [25], {{as reported in the}} following. <b>Holocellulose</b> was determined by delignification of biomass dry powder (7.5  g) for 3  h at 75 °C in a mixture (240  mL water, 0.75  mL glacial acetic acid and 2.25  g sodium chlorite) to which further acid and chlorite amounts, equal to previous, were hourly added. The resulting <b>holocellulose</b> residue was dried at 105 °C and weighed after washing with cold water, warm water and acetone. The pectin content was determined by <b>holocellulose</b> weight loss after pectin extraction. For this, <b>holocellulose</b> (1.3  g) was treated at 75 °C with potassium acetate 0.6  mol L− 1 (26  mL), and adding ammonium oxalate 0.04  mol L− 1 (26  mL) after 3  h. The suspension was filtered, then the residue was washed, dried at 105 °C and weighed. Cellulose was isolated from <b>holocellulose</b> (3.8  g) by treatment with sodium hydroxide 4.4  mol L− 1 (100  mL) for 30  min. The filtered residue of cellulose was washed with warm water, acetic acid 2  mol L− 1, and water, then dried at 105 °C and weighed. The hemicellulose was calculated as <b>holocellulose</b> minus cellulose and pectin. Cellulosic monosaccharide was determined by hydrolysis of biomass dry powder (4  mg) treated with trifluoroacetic acid, TFA, 2  mol L− 1 (0.5  mL) in argon fluxed vials at 100 °C for 4  h. The pellets, resulting by drying vials in centrifugal evaporator, were washed with 2 -propanol, vacuum dried and water resuspended, then filtered with 0.45  mm PTFE filters and analyzed by HPAEC. Crystalline cellulose was determined by hydrolysis with 72 % sulphuric acid (90  mL) for 4  h of the TFA hydrolysed pellets obtained as above and washed with water and acetone. The hydrolizate was added of 1.89  mL water and heated for 4  h at 120 °C, then glucose was assessed in supernatant by anthrone method.|$|E
40|$|Holocelluloses {{have been}} {{prepared}} in substantially quantitative yields from extractive-free straws of wheat, oats, barley, rye, and flax by acid chlorite treatments. Estimation of the pentosan, uronic acid anhydride, Cross and Bevan cellulose, and acetyl contents of the recovered holocelluloses showed that little loss of carbohydrate material had occurred during isolation. Lignin contents of the holocelluloses from the various straws varied between 2. 5 and 3. 5 %. Extension of the chlorite treatments beyond the number required to isolate the <b>holocellulose</b> resulted in only minor diminution of lignin but caused considerable loss of carbohydrate material. Mild delignifying treatments of crude <b>holocellulose</b> with hypochlorite (acid and neutral), hypochlorite and sulphite extraction, bromine, and alcoholic ethanolamine had effects {{similar to those of}} acid chlorite. The major portion of protein in the straws was removed by acid chlorite. The isolated <b>holocellulose</b> contained more ash than the original straws. Peer reviewed: YesNRC publication: Ye...|$|E
40|$|The {{chemical}} {{constituents of}} oil-cured 3 years-old tropical bamboo Gigantochloa scortechinii were investigated in this study. The bamboo splits were oil-cured using organic palm oil at temperature of 140, 180 and 220 °C for duration of 30 and 60 min. The bamboo splits were then grinded into small particles and air-dried {{prior to the}} chemical analysis to obtain the compositions: <b>holocellulose,</b> hemicellulose, cellulose, lignin and starch. Untreated samples were used as control for comparison. The results obtained showed an overall reduction in the chemicals constituents after treatments compared to the control. Significant changes were however noted after the bamboo samples underwent treatment at temperature above 180 °C. The <b>holocellulose</b> content decreased slightly from 81. 4 to 79. 7 % for treatment conditions at 220 °C for 30 min. On the other hand <b>holocellulose</b> content diminished significantly when the sample was treated at 180 °C for 30 min and further treatment resulted in 72. 7 % <b>holocellulose</b> content at 220 °C for 60 min treatment. The hemicellulose content of bamboo ranged from 24. 1 to 27. 8 % when treated at 140 and 220 °C for 30 to 60 min, respectively. The cellulose content of heat-treated samples ranged 47. 4 to 55. 2 %. Starch contents were largely reduced from 4. 1 to 1. 9 % for control to oil-cured samples at 220 °C for 60 min...|$|E
