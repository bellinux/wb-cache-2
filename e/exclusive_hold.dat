25|$|Congress {{has several}} powers related {{to war and}} the armed forces. Under the War Powers Clause, only Congress may declare war, but in several cases it has, without declaring war, granted the President the {{authority}} to engage in military conflicts. Five wars have been declared in United States' history: the War of 1812, the Mexican–American War, the Spanish–American War, World War I and World War II. Some historians argue that the legal doctrines and legislation passed during the operations against Pancho Villa constitute a sixth declaration of war. Congress may grant letters of marque and reprisal. Congress may establish and support the armed forces, but no appropriation made {{for the support of}} the army may be used for more than two years. This provision was inserted because the Framers feared the establishment of a standing army, beyond civilian control, during peacetime. Congress may regulate or call forth the state militias, but the states retain the authority to appoint officers and train personnel. Congress also has exclusive power to make rules and regulations governing the land and naval forces. Although the executive branch and the Pentagon have asserted an ever-increasing measure of involvement in this process, the U.S. Supreme Court has often reaffirmed Congress's <b>exclusive</b> <b>hold</b> on this power (e.g. Burns v. Wilson, 346 U.S. 137 (1953)). Congress used this power twice soon after World War II with the enactment of two statutes: the Uniform Code of Military Justice to improve the quality and fairness of courts martial and military justice, and the Federal Tort Claims Act which among other rights had allowed military service persons to sue for damages until the U.S. Supreme Court repealed that section of the statute in a divisive series of cases, known collectively as the Feres Doctrine.|$|E

5000|$|The {{search for}} wisdom has been {{prevalent}} in both ancient Greek and ancient Chinese texts. Socrates thought of philosophy as a lifestyle search for wisdom. Rather than {{a form of}} academic thought, philosophy meant a path towards truth and wisdom. Despite the differences in methodology, both the ancient Greeks and ancient Chinese discussed the same topics. [...] The subject of philosophy has been a tradition for both. [...] Hence, the West cannot {{be said to have}} an <b>exclusive</b> <b>hold</b> on the term. Philosophy has existed for the Chinese in the Aristotelian sense.

Although men exercise power over women in a variety of ways, a review of the findings of social psychology indicates that almosL all types of power derive from men 2 ̆ 7 s activities in the public sphere. The exercise of power has {{become a part of the}} male gender role and a primary source of men 2 ̆ 7 s identity and self esteem.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this {{research}} is to take up Edmund Morgan’s thesis in The Puritan Family that the family incorporated “economic as well as political and ecclesiastical functions” and discover how the Puritan family interacted with social and political structures, in this case religion, belief, and the community, in colonial Connecticut. In order to explore such dynamics, several cases of incest will be explored. Colonial Connecticut’s history of incest prosecution provides a window into the workings of family government and its function in preparing individuals to integrate fully into Puritan society. Even as the American Puritan justice system based on sola scriptura began to give way {{at the close of the}} seventeenth- century as a result of pressure from England to conform to English common law and judicial practice, the influence of Puritan familial ideology continued to be felt well into the eighteenth century, despite seventeenth-century ministerial assertions that the New England family was in decline. With an eye on maintaining social order, the descendants of Connecticut’s founders continued to insist that the family constituted a vital force in socializing individuals into society, even as Puritanism was losing its <b>exclusive</b> <b>hold</b> over New England’s institutions...|$|E
40|$|This study {{analyzes}} {{the integration of}} the Japanese into the politics of race and nation in Peru during the period from 1899 to 1942. The first generation of Japanese immigrants arrived in Peru at the apex of debates on national racial identity and popular challenges to the white oligarchy's <b>exclusive</b> <b>hold</b> on national political and economic power. This dissertation examines how not only elites, but also working- and middle-class movements advocated the exclusion of the Japanese as a way of staking their claims on the nation. In this study, I argue that Peru's marginalization of the Japanese sprang from racist structures developed in the colonial and liberal republican eras as well as from global eugenic ideologies and discourses of yellow peril that had penetrated Peru. The Japanese were seen through Orientalist eyes, conceptualized and homogenized as a race that acted as a single organism and that would bring only detriment to the Peruvian racial whitening project. Eugenics conflated women with their reproduction, leading racial science advocates to portray Japanese women in Peru as the nation's ultimate danger and accuse them of attempting to conquer Peru "through their wombs. " The Japanese men and women who settled in Peru, however, were also actors in their Peruvian communities. Many Japanese laborers, largely Okinawan, were participants in rural labor movements in Peru. Policymakers, hacienda owners, and local power holders, however, undermined class-based challenges to their authority by demonizing the Japanese as a cultural, racial, and political threat to the Peruvian nation. In stepping out of their rung on the racial hierarchy, the Japanese shop keepers also provoked resentment both among their fellow Peruvian business owners and elements within the urban labor movement. The deeper the Japanese Peruvians sank their roots into Peru, the more shrill became the accusations that they were "inassimilable. " Finally, opportunistic politicians played upon the Peruvian elites' deepest fears by accusing the Japanese immigrants of joining with Peru's indigenous people to launch a race war...|$|E

40|$|This study {{considers}} the boundaries around which power and knowledge are negotiated {{in a college}} classroom between teacher and students. I argue that if students are to be active, reflective learners, {{what is needed is}} a way of viewing the teacher 2 ̆ 7 s authority, not as that which legitimates and exercises control over students, but as that which serves as a mediator for helping students situate themselves in relation to knowledge and interest. It therefore becomes necessary to consider the consequences of deconstructing authority in the classroom. For if teachers give up their <b>exclusive</b> <b>hold</b> in authority (of both rules and knowledge), {{what does that mean for}} (1) the experience of the individual student; (2) the class as a collective; and, (3) the teacher who is shorn of his or her official authority?^ This study uses broad-based ethnographic methods of participant observation and data analysis. Data which are drawn from field notes, audio-tapes of classroom dialogue, interviews with participants, and dialogue journals between teacher and student have been used as a way of systematically learning reality from the point of view of the participant, and that includes both teacher and student perspectives. The data are presented as analytic narrative vignettes, organized according to empirical assertions derived through both inductive and deductive methods. ^ The study suggests implications for teacher research and critical pedagogy by recognizing the slippery notions of power and authority in the classroom. It is suggested that teachers desiring to enable their students to become more independent learners in the college classroom should consider the dialectical nature of the teacher-student relationship where the teacher 2 ̆ 7 s authority changes as the students evolve. Since years of school scripts have been ingrained in students, teachers in the critical classroom must be rulers in disguise, or mobile authorities (as Shor and Freire call them), while never becoming authoritarian, in order to set the scenes for learning experiences which students must ultimately work out for themselves. ...|$|E
40|$|Cultural critic bell hooks says, 2 ̆ 2 Movies make magic. They change things. They {{take the}} real and make it into {{something}} else right before our very eyes. 2 ̆ 2 Movies do not, of course, have an <b>exclusive</b> <b>hold</b> on this ability to change one thing into something else. Law, too, possesses this power. Certainly, one must acknowledge some {{significant differences in the}} 2 ̆ 2 magic 2 ̆ 2 of filmic and legal texts. For the most part, as willing consumers of cultural products, we 2 ̆ 2 choose 2 ̆ 2 to subject ourselves to the magic of film. We sit in a darkened theater and let ourselves be taken away to a different place. Or, we sit in the darkness resisting the film 2 ̆ 7 s attempts at enchantment or provocation. Law, on the other hand, works its magic notwithstanding the resistance of its objectors. Through judicial and legislative pronouncements, law changes 2 ̆ 2 the real, 2 ̆ 2 and declares that something once named thus shall henceforth be named otherwise. With the flick of a pen, transformation occurs before our eyes: the hiring of a white woman by an Asian man is a punishable offense; a First Nations woman marries a white man and is 2 ̆ 2 an Indian 2 ̆ 2 no more; women are 2 ̆ 2 persons 2 ̆ 2 capable of sitting in the Canadian senate; marriage is no longer an exclusively heterosexual institution. One might, of course, protest {{the use of the word}} 2 ̆ 2 magic 2 ̆ 2 to describe such modifications of 2 ̆ 2 the real 2 ̆ 2 law can both change the world and prevent it from changing, situated as it is between the demands of stability and change. But, the skeptic might assert, law 2 ̆ 7 s ability to bring about and resist change is a product of democratic mechanisms and judicial decision-making (albeit supplemented by relations of force). 2 ̆ 2 Magic 2 ̆ 2 may not be the most apt descriptor. And yet, there is something in the comparison. Reflecting back on the experience of first reading and then teaching Orit Kamir 2 ̆ 7 s book Framed: Women in Law and Film, I am reminded of Robert Gordon 2 ̆ 7 s comment that the true power of a legal regime lies less in the relations of force it inscribes and brings to bear, than in 2 ̆ 2 its capacity to persuade people that the world described in its images and categories is the only attainable world in which a sane person would want to live. 2 ̆...|$|E
40|$|The riots of October 1988, {{the most}} violent {{uprising}} since independence against FLN-rule, forced president Chadli Bendjedid to accelerate and to extend the constitutional reforms announced earlier. An adaption of the constitutional law to the ongoing economic liberalization-process had become a necessity, but the popular pressure now not only asked economic changes, but also profound political reform. The new constitutional text was rapidly elaborated by a small circle of persons around the President and then submitted directly to a popular referendum. In contradiction with the procedure fixed by the previous constitution, the National Assembly was not involved nor even consulted. The constitution of 1989 generates an entirely new political regime. The word "socialism", basis of the official doctrine since independence and largely confirmed by {{the provisions of the}} constitution of 1976, is banned completely. The new constitution also provides for the political responsibility of the Head of the Government {{and the members of the}} Government to the National People's Assembly, and not any more to the Presidentonly. In the chapter on fundamental freedoms and the rights of man, it is explicitly provided that the State guarantees the right to form political associations. This new timorous formulation entails the end of the one-party system and the FLN's <b>exclusive</b> <b>hold</b> on power. Some basic principles remain: Algeria is still considered a popular democratic state. Islam is the state religion and the official language is Arabic. No reference is made to the Berber language or culture. New is that the exercise of the guaranteed fundamental freedoms and rights can not be submitted any more to the imperatives of a socialist revolution. It is also stated that judges only obey to the law, they are not submitted any more to the revolutionary legality. A Constitutional Council is created to ensure that the constitution is respected but citizens have no right to submit a case, only the President and the President of the Assembly have. The tasks of the army are limited to safeguard the national independence and sovereignty; the army has no duties any more to safeguard the socialist revolution. The introduction of a responsible Government affects the presidential powers only in a minor way. The President presides over the Council of ministers, where bills are discussed. The President can ask the Assembly for a second reading of a law and this new vote requires a two-thirds majority. Only the President has the initiative for a constitutional revision. The President chairs a number of other councils. Finally the declaration of the state of emergency is depending only on the decision of the President; this attributes him large exceptional powers. Thus, the constitution of 1989 confirms a strong presidential regime but on the other hand it has introduced a real multi-party system in Algeria. More than 20 political parties are recognised. During the local elections of 1990 the ruling FLN was defeated in most places by a massive victory of the islamic fundamentalist party, the FIS. A new electorial law, voted by the - still exclusive FLN - National Assembly beginning 1991, had to ensure a better result for the FLN during the forthcoming first free national elections. In June 1991 violent and even armed protest, organised by the fundamentalists against the law forced president Bendjedid to postpone elections, to declare the state of emergency but also to promise early presidential elections. Meanwhile manyfundamentalists, and between them the main party-leaders, were arrested. The army played a crucial role in reestablishing public order and as a consequence gained more importance, but there were no signs that it exceeded its authority. Under present difficulties one wonders whether the constitution of 1989 will help to create a representative democratic multi-partyism, with an equitable liberal economy, whether it will help to open the way for a regime dominated by islamic fundamentalists...|$|E
