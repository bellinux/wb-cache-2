40|$|Epidemiological {{studies suggest}} that {{consumption}} <b>of</b> <b>wine,</b> grape products, and other foods containing polyphenols is associated with decreased risk for cardiovascular <b>disease.</b> The benefits <b>of</b> <b>wine</b> consumption appear to be greater than other alcoholic beverages. Experimental studies indicate that grape polyphenols could reduce atherosclerosis {{by a number of}} mechanisms, including inhibition of oxidation of LDL and other favorable effects on cellular redox state, improvement of endothelial function, lowering blood pressure, inhibition of platelet aggregation, reducing inflammation, and activating novel proteins that prevent cell senescence, e. g. Sirtuin 1. Translational studies in humans support these beneficial effects. More clinical studies are needed to confirm these effects and formulate dietary guidelines. The available data, however, strongly support the recommendation that a diet rich in fruits and vegetables, including grapes, can decrease the risk for cardiovascular disease...|$|R

40|$|The aim of {{this thesis}} was to compare the {{analytical}} and sensory attributes <b>of</b> <b>wines</b> aged in different storage containers for {{a certain period of}} aging. The theoretical section describes wine storage containers from history to the present, their advantages and disadvantages. There are more details of barrique barrels, their processing and burning. The following section discusses the selection of appropriate containers for alcoholic fermentation. There is an important process of biological degradation of acid before red wine maturing, which is described in the next chapter. A large part of the chapter is devoted to wine aging. There are some effects in terms of oxygen, depending on maturation, pH for red <b>wine</b> colours, pH <b>of</b> the acid. An important chapter is the aging <b>of</b> <b>wines</b> in barrique barrels, followed by a change of phenolic compounds, dependence of oak and volatile compounds on physico -chemical characteristics <b>of</b> <b>wines.</b> In subsequent chapters there is explained the concept <b>of</b> <b>wine</b> aging, there are cataracts, <b>diseases</b> and defects <b>of</b> <b>wines</b> that may occur during aging. In the experimental part I used two red wines and one white wine. Wines were divided into inert containers and various barrels of different manufacturers and volumes. Red wines were produced in the same technology manner and the aging conditions (temperature, humidity) were the same as well. The aim was to evaluate the analytical and sensory values <b>of</b> <b>wines</b> for the time of one year. The attempt for white wine was aimed for the time of three months. The main intention was to monitor changes in the content of phenolic compounds : polyphenols, anthocyanins, polyphenols amount of gallic acid, hydroxycinnamic acids and flavonoids. Differences for each wine were observed depending on the container size and the ripening time. The senzory evaluation was an important parameter. Wines matured in barrels showed aromatic complexity and tannin structure with finesse...|$|R
40|$|This bachelor's {{thesis is}} {{dedicated}} to using wood in wine-making. Firstly, is focused on chemical composition of wood and its physical parametres, its individual components in particular. There are described types of woods mostly used in viticulture and its consecutive utilisation at coopery. An individual chapter {{is dedicated to}} coopery where are described: technological manufacturing of timber, burning out the barrels {{and its effect on}} the change of their chemical characteristics as well as analysing the barrels as means to wine fertilisation and wine ripening. There is also mentioned individually the barrique-type barrels and barrels for ageing of special (mostly fortified) wines. In this connection possible <b>diseases</b> and flaws <b>of</b> <b>wines</b> connected to ageing in wooden barrels are described. The following chapter focuses on using preparations replacing barrique barrels which also add oak and vanilla shades to wine such as wooden chippings, desks and oak bore dust. A special attention is paid to corks, their production, types and effect on wine while ageing in bottles. The end of this thesis dealt with using tannins extracted from timber which are recently becoming very popular...|$|R
