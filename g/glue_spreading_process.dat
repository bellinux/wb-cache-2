40|$|The paper {{analyses}} {{causes of}} disorders of the shape stability of water-resistant plywoods produced by an important producer in the CR. Deformations of plywoods {{are caused by}} many reasons, such as wood structure (the course of wood fibres), plywood construction (the construction balance as for size and material regularity), the moisture of processed veneers and boards, <b>glue</b> <b>spread,</b> actual pressing <b>process,</b> the storage and climatization of finished plywoods. Basic technological parameters affecting the shape stability of plywoods were analysed, such as parameters of the hydrothermic pre­pa­ra­tion of raw material, parameters of veneer drying and the moisture of peeled veneers after drying as well as pressing parameters. At the conclusion, recommendations to improve the shape stability of plywood sheets are presented...|$|R

30|$|Fire retardancy of melamine-modified urea–formaldehyde resin (MUF) {{containing}} intumescent fire-retardant ammonium polyphosphate (APP) (MUF/APP) {{was conducted}} by cone calorimeter with surface treatment of medium density fiberboard (MDF). The {{results showed that the}} six MUF resins synthesized with different F/(M + U) and M/U molar ratios containing APP significantly improved the fire retardancy of the MDF by prolonging ignition time, reducing heat release rate and total heat release, and decreasing mass loss rate. The fire-retardant properties of the six synthesized MUF/APP acted differently even though each MUF resin containing the same mass ratio of APP. The melamine content in the MUF should not be too high, otherwise it would decrease the fire-retardant properties of MUF/APP. Based on this study, the higher the APP amounts, the better the fire-retardant performance of the resin was. The fire retardancy of MUF/APP increased with the increase in the amount of <b>glue</b> that <b>spread</b> on the material surface.

30|$|Modeling <b>spreading</b> <b>processes</b> {{that are}} governed by human {{mobility}} in prehistoric times faces several additional difficulties compared to <b>spreading</b> <b>processes</b> in modern times. First, the available data is very sparse, indirect and uncertain [31]. The {{reason for this is}} that there is a limited amount of archaeological traces at hand which may or may not represent the true, complete data set. Second, besides the limited data resources, we cannot replicate or observe anymore a process that had happened in prehistoric times in order to obtain new data. Third, given the level of socio-technological development in ancient times, the possibility for humans to interact were restricted to close distances. And thus the produced patterns of the dynamical properties of <b>spreading</b> <b>processes</b> are quite different compared to the ones that can be observed nowadays. For all these reasons, when modeling mobility and <b>spreading</b> <b>processes</b> in ancient times, we can not directly apply many of the state-of-the-art modeling approaches, based on data-fitting and validation [7], data assimilation [25] or methods that assume perfect social mixing [32].|$|R

40|$|Most {{theoretical}} tools {{available for}} the analysis of <b>spreading</b> <b>processes</b> over networks assume exponentially distributed transmission and recovery times. In practice, the empirical distribution of transmission times for many real <b>spreading</b> <b>processes,</b> such as the spread of web content through the Internet, are far from exponential. To bridge this gap between theory and practice, we propose a methodology to model and analyze <b>spreading</b> <b>processes</b> with arbitrary transmission times using phase-type distributions. Phase-type distributions are a family of distributions that is dense in the set of positive-valued distributions and can be used to approximate any given distributions. To illustrate our methodology, we focus on a popular model of spreading over networks: the susceptible-infected-susceptible (SIS) networked model. In the standard version of this model, individuals informed about a piece of information transmit this piece to its neighbors at an exponential rate. In this paper, we extend this model to the case of transmission rates following a phase-type distribution. Using this extended model, we analyze the dynamics of the spread based on a vectorial representations of phase-type distributions. We illustrate our results by analyzing <b>spreading</b> <b>processes</b> over networks with transmission and recovery rates following a Weibull distribution...|$|R
