40|$|This project {{analyzes}} {{designs for}} physical redundancy which are modeled abstractly as a bipartite graph. The {{goal is to}} determine the characteristics of graph structures which optimize the trade-off between the number of edges and the number of redundant components or nodes needed while correcting a deterministic number of worst-case errors. This thesis looks at finite-sized designs, asymptotically large designs with finite error correcting values, and designs with asymptotically large error correcting values. Results include some small optimal graph structures and fundamental limits on what the optimal design structure can achieve for the cases where a small number of errors are corrected and for where the number of errors to be correctly grows asymptotically. by <b>Jennifer</b> Tang.

40|$|The {{regeneration}} of rainforest onto land {{cleared for}} grazing early this century was studied on several sites in northern Tasmania. Drimys lanceolata, a bird-dispersed species, {{was the main}} invader. The climax forest species. Nothofagus cunninghamii and Atherosperma moschatum were invading slowly from the forest edge with occasional trees established in the field. Woody plants in the old-field were clumped around logs. This {{was related to the}} role of logs in attracting seed and to possible roles as competition-free sites and sites safe from browsing and climatic stresses. Changes in dominance by particular life forms appeared to be related to dispersal events, environmental modification by the developing vegetation and life history characteristics. The extremely slow invasion by climax species is due to the absence of bare mineral soil as well as to dispersal characteristics, browsing and possibly exposure to climatic stresses. <b>Jennifer</b> Read, Robert <b>S.</b> Hil...|$|R

40|$|Zoogeographic, palaeontological and {{biochemical}} {{data support}} a Southern Hemisphere origin for passerine birds, while accumulating molecular {{data suggest that}} most extant avian orders originated in the mid-Late Cretaceous. We obtained DNA sequence data from the nuclear c-myc and RAG- 1 genes of the major passerine groups and here we demonstrate that the endemic New Zealand wrens (Acanthisittidae) are the sister taxon to all other extant passerines, supporting a Gondwanan origin and early radiation of passerines. We propose that (i) the acanthisittids were isolated when New Zealand separated from Gondwana (ca. 82 - 85 Myr ago), (ii) suboscines, in turn, were derived from an ancestral lineage that inhabited western Gondwana, and (iii) the ancestors of the oscines (songbirds) were subsequently isolated by the separation of Australia from Antarctica. The later spread of passerines into the Northern Hemisphere reflects the northward migration of these former Gondwanan elements. Per G. P.

40|$|In this thesis, I {{present the}} design and {{implementation}} of a novel cantilever probe holder {{that is capable of}} tapping mode operation. The probe holder is implemented in a previously designed high-speed, large-range atomic force microscope (AFM). This AFM used a cantilever probe holder that was only capable of contact mode operation, placing limitations on imaging speed and increasing the risk of probe tip damage. Therefore, the focus of this thesis presents the improved design of a cantilever probe holder that actuates and utilizes probe dynamics. This will allow for more flexible and sustainable use of the AFM system. Additionally, two versions of this improved design are developed for operation in air and in liquid. Classical plate theory, finite element analysis (FEA), and non-parametric system identification are used to validate the structure dynamics of the cantilever probe holder. by <b>Jennifer</b> Yu.

Physicians attempt to consider {{as much of the}} relevant information as possible, but the astronomically large amounts of data collected make it impossible to consider all available information within a reasonable amount of time. In this thesis, I explore Bayesian Networks as a way to integrate patient data into a probabilistic model. I present a small Bayesian Network model of the cardiovascular system and analyze the network's ability to estimate unknown patient parameters using available patient information. I test the network's estimation capabilities using both simulated and real patient data, and I discuss ways to exploit the network's ability to adapt to patient data and learn relationships between patient variables. by <b>Jennifer</b> Roberts.
