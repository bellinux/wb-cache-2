Tharoor said <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>because</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> delayed {{readiness}} of his official residence {{and that he had}} paid out of his own pocket for the accommodation. Later, on Pranab Mukherjee's request, Tharoor and Krishna moved out of the hotels.|$|E
5|$|The Germans {{decided to}} {{concentrate}} on the notes with the largest number in circulation, the £5. Samples of British notes were sent to technical colleges for analysis, which reported back that it was rag paper with no added cellulose. Naujocks and Langer realised that the paper would have to be handmade. The colour of the first samples differed from the original; the Germans had used new rags. After tests at the Hahnemühle paper factory, the rags were used by local factories and then cleaned before being used to make the paper; the colours of the counterfeit and original notes then matched. When the initial paper samples were produced, at a factory in Spechthausen, they looked identical to British notes in normal light, but looked dull in ultraviolet light when compared to the originals. Langer surmised <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>because</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> chemical composition of the water used for making the paper and in the ink. He duplicated the chemical balance of British water {{in order to make the}} colours match.|$|E

25|$|<b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>because</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> {{difficulties}} Wade encountered marching {{his troops}} cross-country from Newcastle to Carlisle, that {{he built his}} Military Road west of Newcastle in 1746, entailing such destruction of Hadrian's Wall. Wade helped plan the road, but had died before construction began in 1751. His Military Road is still in use today as the B6318; {{it should not be}} confused with the Military Way built by the Romans immediately south of Hadrian's Wall.|$|E

25|$|Following {{the reforms}} of 1729, the treasury's income {{increased}} from 32,622,421 taels in 1721 to about 60 million taels in 1730, surpassing the record set during the Kangxi Emperor's reign; but the pacification of the Qinghai {{area and the}} defence of border areas were heavy burdens on the treasury. Safeguarding the country's borders cost 100,000 taels per year. The total military budget came up to about 10 million taels a year. By the end of 1735, military spending had depleted half the treasury, leaving 33.95 million taels. <b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>because</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> cost of war that the Yongzheng Emperor considered making peace with the Dzungars.|$|E
25|$|Shown this {{evidence}} by UNSCOM, Taha admitted to inspectors {{that she had}} grown 19,000 litres of botulism toxin; 8,000 litres of anthrax; 2,000 litres of aflatoxins, which can cause liver cancer; clostridium perfringens, a bacterium that can cause gas gangrene; and ricin, a castor bean derivative which can kill by inhibiting protein synthesis. She also admitted conducting research into cholera, salmonella, foot and mouth disease, and camel pox, a disease that uses the same growth techniques as smallpox, but which is safer for researchers to work with. <b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>because</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> discovery of Taha's work with camel pox that the US and British intelligence services feared Saddam Hussein may have been planning to weaponize the smallpox virus. Iraq had a smallpox outbreak in the 1970s and UNSCOM scientists believe the government would have retained contaminated material.|$|E
25|$|Her {{father was}} a tax inspector, exempt from {{military}} service in the First World War due to his high rank in a reserved occupation. <b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>because</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> nature of the tax-collecting profession, and the different promotions he received, that the family moved around the country on different occasions. Having moved to Bradford in 1922, the Betts family swiftly became involved with the Independent Labour Party. Although her father was prohibited from formal political activity because of {{his role as a}} civil servant, he became editor of the Bradford Pioneer, the city's socialist newspaper, after William Leach was elected to Parliament in 1935. Castle's mother ran the family home, while also operating a soup-kitchen for the town's miners. After Barbara had left home, Annie was elected as a Labour Councillor in Bradford, a role which she kept quite secret from even her close family.|$|E

25|$|Superman debuted as {{the cover}} {{feature of the}} {{anthology}} Action Comics #1 (cover-dated June 1938 and published on April 18, 1938). The series was an immediate success, and reader feedback showed <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>because</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Superman character. In June 1939, Detective Comics began a sister series, Superman, dedicated exclusively to the character. Action Comics eventually became dedicated to Superman stories too, and both it and Superman have been published without interruption since 1938 (ignoring changes to the titles and numbering). A large number of other series and miniseries have been published as well. Superman has also appeared as a regular or semi-regular character {{in a number of}} superhero team series, such as Justice League of America and World's Finest Comics, and in spin-off series such as Supergirl. Sales of Action Comics and Superman declined steadily from the 1950s, but rose again starting in 1987. Superman #75 (Nov 1992) sold over 6 million copies, making it the best-selling issue of a comic book of all time, thanks to a media sensation over the possibly permanent death of the character in that issue. Sales declined from that point on. In February 2016, Action Comics sold just over 31,000 copies. The comic books are today considered a niche aspect of the Superman franchise due to low readership.|$|E
25|$|Torishima {{is a fan}} {{of video}} games and was {{therefore}} put in charge of the first video game-related articles in Weekly Shōnen Jump, for which he brought in Yuji Horii to help. When his manager told him to figure out why CoroCoro Comic was doing so well, Torishima determined <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>because</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> sealed pages that had to be cut opened and included cheats and tips for video games. In addition to including similar pages in Jump, they also began to rate games, something new at the time, with the resulting content being voted third in the magazine's reader polls. This was the birth of , the video game section of Weekly Shōnen Jump issues. After finding success with video game articles and wanting to show readers of Jump how one is developed, the magazine decided to develop their own role-playing game like Ultima so that they would have exclusive coverage of it. He decided to have Horii, who had begun working at Enix, write the scenario and Toriyama design the characters. Torishima claimed that he purposefully had Enix fully fund the game, intentionally keeping Shueisha out of the decision making process {{for the good of the}} product while still reserving the option to create a manga based on it and not pay any royalties. The video game was Dragon Quest.|$|E
500|$|Gerald Reitlinger {{describes}} Nebe's {{reasons for}} joining the Einsatzgruppen as [...] "placation" [...] {{and a desire}} to hold on to his position in the Criminal Police Department, which, since 1934, had been [...] "invaded by amateur Gestapo men" [...] and was later taken over by Heydrich. [...] "If Nebe did in fact retain his office till 1944, <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>because</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> five months he spent in Russia, or, as his friend Gisevius politely referred to, 'at the front'."

500|$|Eminem, born Marshall Bruce Mathers III, began rapping at age fourteen. In 1996, {{his debut}} album Infinite, which was {{recorded}} at the Bassmint, {{a recording studio}} owned by the Bass Brothers, was released under their independent record label Web Entertainment. [...] Infinite achieved very little commercial success and was largely ignored by Detroit radio stations. [...] The disappointment from this experience greatly influenced his lyrical style: [...] "After that record, every rhyme I wrote got angrier and angrier. A lot of <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>because</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> feedback I got. Motherfuckers was like, 'You're a white boy, {{what the fuck are}} you rapping for? Why don't you go into rock & roll?' All that type of shit started pissing me off." [...] After the release of Infinite, Eminem's personal struggles and abuse of drugs and alcohol culminated in an unsuccessful suicide attempt.|$|E
500|$|The album {{begins with}} a number of up-tempo songs before {{expanding}} to a variety of tempos for its second half. Vedder attributed the faster and more aggressive songs to the band writing a lot of material that kept getting pared down, with the band leaving behind mid-tempo songs, while Ament suggested that <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>because</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> band balancing recording and touring which resulted in [...] "physicality... from being out on the road." [...] The band attempted to create an environment in which McCready and drummer Matt Cameron could play much as they do live. Ament said that there was [...] "a lot of honing of the guitars and vocals in the middle and toward the end," [...] which resulted in the album sounding [...] "more polished." [...] On the overall feeling of the album, Ament said, [...] "The band playing in a room—that came across. There's a kind of immediacy to the record, and that's what we were going for." ...|$|E
500|$|The Welsh Springer Spaniel {{was also}} at one time called the Welsh Spaniel, and also at one point was {{included}} in the Kennel Club (UK) studbook as Cocker Spaniels, and was known as the Welsh Cocker. During the 19th century were several different varieties of Cocker Spaniel, including the English, the Welsh and the Devonshire as the term was used to describe the size of the dog rather than the breed. Unusually, in John George Wood's 1865 book The Illustrated Natural History, an image is described showing a Welsh Cocker Spaniel as a solid coloured dark spaniel. The same inscription is used in the 1867 work The Dog in Health and Disease by Stonehenge and he further describes the Welsh Cocker and the Devonshire Cocker as [...] "both being of a deep-liver colour". The Welsh Springer was relatively unknown during the 19th Century, but this changed in 1900 when Mr. A. T. Williams of Ynis-y-Gerwn won the team stake at the Sporting Spaniel Club Trials. The trials were held on Mr. Williams' own estate, and it was thought that when his team defeated eight well known teams <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>because</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> home advantage. This was disproved when dogs from the same kennel went on to win in successive years around the UK. His conformation show champion dog Corrin was the first Welsh Springer Spaniel to be photographed.|$|E

500|$|In January1994, Simon co-created with comedian George Carlin {{the sitcom}} The George Carlin Show for Fox. It aired for 27 episodes before being {{canceled}} in December1995. Simon served as showrunner throughout its run and directed several episodes. Simon persuaded Carlin {{to do the}} show after writing it as something which would not be [...] "typically sitcomy." [...] He conceived the show as what Carlin's {{life would have been}} like had he never become a comedian; Carlin played a heavy drinking New York taxi driver. Simon commented: [...] "When I was doing The Simpsons, people couldn't see how smart <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>because</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> low moments. There's something about this show. People who like it say it's classy. They don't see how vulgar it is." [...] Carlin wrote negatively of his relationship with Simon. On his own website, Carlin wrote of the show: [...] "always check mental health of creative partner beforehand. Loved the actors, loved the crew. Had a great time. Couldn't wait to {{get the fuck out of}} there." [...] In his final book, the posthumously published Last Words (2009), Carlin elaborated: [...] "I had a great time. I never laughed so much, so often, so hard as I did with cast members Alex Rocco, Chris Rich, Tony Starke. There was a very strange, very good sense of humor on that stage ... The biggest problem, though, was that Sam Simon was a fucking horrible person to be around. Very, very funny, extremely bright and brilliant, but an unhappy person who treated other people poorly."
