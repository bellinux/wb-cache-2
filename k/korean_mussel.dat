5000|$|Mytilus coruscus, {{common name}} the <b>Korean</b> <b>mussel</b> or the {{hard-shelled}} mussel, [...] is {{a species of}} mussel, a marine bivalve mollusc in the family Mytilidae. This species is heavily exploited as a food item via mariculture in Korea and in China.|$|E
5000|$|Molluscs are {{the second}} most {{important}} group of marine aquaculture products. The primary species produced, including the oysters (Crassostrea gigas and Pinctada fucata), <b>Korean</b> <b>mussel</b> (Mytilus coruscus [...] ), the sea squirt red oyas (Halocynthia roretzi), the Japanese carpet shell (Ruditapes philippinarum [...] ), ark shells (Anadara satowi and A. broughtonii), cockles (A. granosabisenensis and A. subcrenata), Yesso scallop (Patinopecten yessoensis) and abalone (Haliotis discus hannai). [...] Production of molluscs reached 391,060 tonnes in 2006, making up 31.1% of the total aquaculture production of South Korea.|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACT The {{physiological}} {{activities of}} cultivated <b>Korean</b> blue <b>mussel</b> (Mytilus edulis) and New Zealand green-lip-ped mussel (Perna canaliculus) were analyzed and compared. Both hot water extracts of blue mussel flesh (BMF) and green-lipped mussel flesh (GMF) showed increased activities of alcohol dehydrogenase (ADH) and acetaldehyde dehydrogenase (ALDH). BMF showed increased ADH and slightly decreased ALDH activities compared to GMF. 1, 1 -Diphenyl- 2 -picrylhydrazyl radical scavenging activity of BMF {{was higher than}} that of GMF at the same concen-tration. BMF and GMF showed similar inhibitory activity against angiotensin converting enzyme at a concentration of 30 mg/mL. These results suggest that cultivated <b>Korean</b> blue <b>mussel</b> has similar physiological activity with Ne...|$|R
