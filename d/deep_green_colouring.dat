50|$|Lieberman-Burchard is a reagent {{used in a}} colourimetric test {{to detect}} cholesterol, which gives a <b>deep</b> <b>green</b> <b>colour.</b> This colour begins as a purplish, pink colour and {{progresses}} through to a light green then very dark <b>green</b> <b>colour.</b> The colour {{is due to the}} hydroxyl group (-OH) of cholesterol reacting with the reagents and increasing the conjugation of the un-saturation in the adjacent fused ring. Since this test uses acetic anhydride and sulfuric acid as reagents, caution must be exercised so as not to receive severe burns.|$|R
50|$|Aracha (荒茶), {{also known}} as Unrefined or Crude Tea, {{is a type of}} green tea {{produced}} in Japan. Unlike most other teas, aracha green tea is produced using the entire leaf of the tea plant, including the leaf blade, leaf stem, broken particles of the leaf, and the fine leaf hair. This often gives the tea a <b>deep</b> <b>green</b> <b>colour</b> and a bold taste though variations are greatly affected by the cultivation and production processes.|$|R

25|$|The {{biggest change}} to Blackheath {{resulted}} from extensive mineral extraction in the 18th and early 19th centuries, when gravel, sand and chalk were extracted. This left large pits on {{many parts of}} the heath. In 1945, pits were filled in with bomb rubble from World War II, then covered with topsoil and seeded with rye grass, leaving only Vanbrugh Pits to the north-east side and Eliot Pits in the south-west. Infilled areas can be spotted easily, especially in late spring and early summer, because of the <b>deeper</b> <b>green</b> <b>colour</b> of the rye grass.|$|R
50|$|Cassine laneana, {{commonly}} known as the Bermuda olivewood, is a species of large tree in the staff vine family, Celastraceae, that is endemic to the islands of Bermuda. Although once found in the extensive subtropical coniferous forests that covered the islands, it is currently restricted to small protected areas, such as Spittal Pond. C. laneana can grow anywhere from 25 to 40 ft tall, with leaves that are 1 to 2.5 in long and 0.5 to 1.5 in wide. The leaves are also a <b>deep</b> <b>green</b> <b>colour</b> when they are older and a bright <b>green</b> <b>colour</b> when they are younger. C. laneana flowers in late spring and early summer and produces a small ovate berry that is an olive colour and 0.25 to 0.5 in long.|$|R

5000|$|Today's {{terminus}} {{building was}} erected in 1964 and houses the station master's office, a waiting area and passenger toilets. Prior {{to this the}} station staff occupied various locations, most notably an office within the now-demolished cinema from which the station gains its name. Directly opposite the passenger area lies the former goods shed which has served a number of purposes in recent years. Used to house goods stock for many years, it was changed into a small museum housing the [...] "Royal Trailer" [...] No. 59 for some years, before being converted to its current use as [...] "The Shed", a youth club.

60|$|This bird differs {{very much}} from the two large species which I had already obtained, and, {{although}} it wants the grace imparted by their long golden trains, is in many respects more remarkable and more beautiful. The head, back, and shoulders are clothed with a richer yellow, the <b>deep</b> metallic <b>green</b> <b>colour</b> of the throat extends further over the head, and the feathers are elongated on the forehead into two little erectile crests. The side plumes are shorter, but are of a rich red colour, terminating in delicate white points, and the middle tail-feathers are represented by two long rigid glossy ribands, which are black, thin, and semi-cylindrical, and droop gracefully in a spiral curve. Several other interesting birds were obtained, and about half-a-dozen quite new ones; but none of any remarkable beauty, except the lovely little dove, Ptilonopus pulchellus, which with several other pigeons I shot on the same fig-tree close to my house. It is of a beautiful <b>green</b> <b>colour</b> above, with a forehead of the richest crimson, while beneath it is ashy white and rich yellow, banded with violet red.|$|R
60|$|He {{looked in}} the {{direction}} in which she pointed, but at first he saw nothing. The wind was still behind them, and a brisk sea was running of a <b>deep</b> rich <b>green</b> <b>colour,</b> with long creamy curling caps to the larger waves. The breeze would catch these foam-crests from time to time, and then there would be a sharp spatter upon the decks, with a salt smack upon the lips, and a pringling in the eyes. Suddenly as he gazed, however, something black was tilted up upon the sharp summit of one of the seas, and swooped out of view again upon the further side. It was so far from him that he could make nothing of it, but sharper eyes than his had caught a glance of it. Amos Green had seen the girl point and observed what it was which had attracted her attention.|$|R
60|$|Many of {{the species}} of Cicindela, or tiger beetle, will {{illustrate}} this mode of protection. Our common Cicindela campestris frequents grassy banks, and is of a beautiful <b>green</b> <b>colour,</b> while C. maritima, which is found only on sandy sea-shores, is of a pale bronzy yellow, {{so as to be}} almost invisible. A great number {{of the species}} found by myself in the Malay islands are similarly protected. The beautiful Cicindela gloriosa, of a very <b>deep</b> velvety <b>green</b> <b>colour,</b> was only taken upon wet mossy stones in the bed of a mountain stream, where it was with the greatest difficulty detected. A large brown species (C. heros) was found chiefly on dead leaves in forest paths; and one which was never seen except on the wet mud of salt marshes was of a glossy olive so exactly the colour of the mud as only to be distinguished when the sun shone, by its shadow! Where the sandy beach was coralline and nearly white, I found a very pale Cicindela; wherever it was volcanic and black, a dark species of the same genus was sure to be met with.|$|R
60|$|On the Somerset coast {{the bird}} is not so badly off, and I have had many happy days with him there. Simply to watch the birds at feed, when the tide goes out and they are busy searching for the small marine creatures they live on among the {{stranded}} seaweed, is a great pleasure. At such times they are most active and loquacious, uttering a variety of wild goose-like sounds, frequently rising to pursue one another in circles, or to fly {{up and down the}} coast in pairs, or strings of half a dozen birds, with a wonderfully graceful flight. If, after watching this sea-fowl by the sea, a person will go to some park water to look on the same bird, pinioned and tame, sitting or standing, or swimming about in a quiet, listless way, he will be amazed at the difference in its appearance. The tame bird is no bigger than a domestic duck; the wild sheldrake, flying about in the strong sunshine, looks almost as large as a goose. A similar illusion is produced in the case of some other large birds. Thus, the common buzzard, when rising in circles high above us, at times appears as big as an eagle, and it has been conjectured that this magnifying effect, which gives something of sublimity to the soaring buzzard, is caused by the sunlight passing through the semi-translucent wing and tail feathers. In the case of the sheldrake, the exaggerated size may be an effect of strong sunlight on a flying white object. Seen on the wing at a distance the plumage appears entirely of a surpassing whiteness, the dark patches of chestnut, black, and <b>deep</b> <b>green</b> <b>colour</b> showing only when {{the bird is}} near, or when it alights and folds its white wings.|$|R

60|$|We {{were much}} struck with the <b>deep,</b> rich <b>green</b> <b>colour</b> of its broad leaves, which were twelve or {{eighteen}} inches long, deeply indented, {{and of a}} glossy smoothness, like the laurel. The fruit, with which it was loaded, was nearly round, {{and appeared to be}} about six inches in diameter, with a rough rind, marked with lozenge-shaped divisions. It was of various colours, from light pea-green to brown and rich yellow. Jack said that the yellow was the ripe fruit. We afterwards found that most of the fruit-trees on the island were evergreens, and that we might, when we wished, pluck the blossom and the ripe fruit from the same tree. Such a wonderful difference from the trees of our own country surprised us not a little. The bark of the tree was rough and light-coloured; the trunk was about two feet in diameter, and it appeared to be twenty feet high, being quite destitute of branches up to that height, where it branched off into a beautiful and umbrageous head. We noticed that the fruit hung in clusters of twos and threes on the branches; but as we were anxious {{to get to the top}} of the hill, we refrained from attempting to pluck any at that time.|$|R
