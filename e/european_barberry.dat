50|$|This {{species is}} {{sometimes}} confused with Berberis canadensis (American barberry), Berberis vulgaris (<b>European</b> <b>barberry),</b> and other deciduous Berberis species; {{it is most}} readily distinguished by the flowers being produced in umbels, not racemes.|$|E
5|$|Most {{land around}} the oxbow is steep. It {{is covered by}} hemlock and {{hardwood}} forests, as well as skunk cabbage seeps. The forests around the lake also contain black birch, yellow birch, white oak, red oak, sugar maple, tulip poplar, and Norway maple, while the understory contains slippery elm, <b>European</b> privet, Japanese <b>barberry,</b> American elderberry, wild hydrangea, witch hazel, mountain laurel, ironwood, and the rare American yew. The American yew population was in significant decline by 2004 due to heavy grazing by deer.|$|R
5000|$|Due to {{the useful}} nature of both {{barberry}} and wheat plants, they were eventually brought to North America by <b>European</b> colonists. <b>Barberry</b> {{was used for}} many things like making wine and jams from the berries to tool handles from the wood. Ultimately, {{as they did in}} Europe, the colonists began to notice a relationship between barberry and stem rust epidemics in wheat. Laws were enacted in many New England colonies, but as the farmers moved west, the problem with the stem rust moved with them and began to spread to many areas, creating a devastating epidemic in 1916. It wasn't until two years later in 1918 that the United States created a program to remove barberry. The program was one that was supported by state and federal entities and was prompted by the looming fear of food supplies during the war. The [...] "war against barberries" [...] was waged and called upon the help of citizens through radio and newspaper advertisements, pamphlets, and fair booths asking for help from all in the attempt to rid the barberry bushes of their existence. Later, in 1975-1980, the program was reestablished under state jurisdiction. Once this happened, a federal quarantine was established against the sale of stem rust susceptible barberry in those states that were part of the program. A barberry testing program was created to ensure that only the species of barberry and other variations of plants that are immune to stem rust will be grown in the quarantine area.|$|R
50|$|Berberis vulgaris L., {{also known}} as common barberry, <b>European</b> <b>barberry</b> or simply barberry, is a shrub in the genus Berberis. It {{produces}} edible but sharply acidic berries, which people in many countries eat as a tart and refreshing fruit.|$|E
5000|$|It {{has been}} widely {{cultivated}} for hedges in New Zealand. [...] Berberis vulgaris (<b>European</b> <b>barberry)</b> is the alternate host species of the wheat rust fungus (Puccinia graminis), a grass-infecting rust fungus that is a serious fungal disease of wheat and related grains. For this reason, cultivation of B. vulgaris is prohibited in Canada and {{some areas of the}} United States (Connecticut, Massachusetts, Michigan, New Hampshire).|$|E
50|$|Berberis vulgaris (<b>European</b> <b>barberry)</b> and Berberis canadensis (American barberry) {{serve as}} {{alternate}} host {{species of the}} wheat rust fungus (Puccinia graminis), a grass-infecting rust fungus that is a serious fungal disease of wheat and related grains. For this reason, cultivation of B. vulgaris is prohibited in many areas, and imports to the United States are forbidden. The North American B. canadensis, native to Appalachia and the Midwest United States, was nearly eradicated for this reason, and is now rarely seen extant, with the most remaining occurrences in the Virginia mountains.|$|E
5000|$|Berberis (...) , {{commonly}} known as barberry, is a large genus of deciduous and evergreen shrubs from 1 - 5 m tall found throughout the temperate and subtropical {{regions of the world}} (apart from Australia). Species diversity is greatest in South America, Africa and Asia; Europe and North America have native species as well. The most well-known Berberis species is the <b>European</b> <b>barberry,</b> Berberis vulgaris, which is common in Europe, North Africa, the Middle East, and central Asia. Many of the species have spines on the shoots and along the margins of the leaves.|$|E
50|$|The small purplish-black fruits, {{which are}} quite tart and contain large seeds, are {{included}} in smaller quantities in the traditional diets of Pacific Northwest aboriginal peoples, mixed with Salal or another sweeter fruit. Today they are sometimes used to make jelly, alone or mixed with salal. Oregon grape juice can be fermented to make wine, similar to <b>European</b> <b>barberry</b> wine folk traditions, although it requires an unusually high amount of sugar. The inner bark of the larger stems and roots of Oregon-grape yield a yellow dye; the berries give purple dye. As the leaves of Oregon-grape are holly-like and resist wilting, the foliage is sometimes used by florists for greenery and a small gathering industry {{has been established in}} the Pacific Northwest.|$|E
40|$|It {{has been}} {{definitely}} known since 1865 that the <b>European</b> <b>barberry</b> is the alternate host of stem rust (Puccinia graminis); yet the exact relation of this shrub {{to the annual}} appearance of stem rust of our grains and grasses is not well understood. Tulasne brothers (18) (1847), de Bary (1) (1865) and others rarely described and figured the morphology of teleutosporic germination. They gave little consideration, however, to the questions as to what environmental conditions influence such germination and the production, dissemination, viability and growth of the sporidiaâ€”conditions that have a fundamental bearing on serious attacks of stem rust...|$|E
40|$|Japanese {{barberry}} is a dense, deciduous, spiny shrub {{that grows}} 2 to 8 ft. high. The branches are brown, deeply grooved, somewhat zig-zag {{in form and}} bear a single very sharp spine at each node. The leaves are small (to 1 inches long), oval to spatula-shaped, green, bluish-green, or dark reddish purple. Flowering occurs from mid-April to May in the northeastern U. S. Pale yellow flowers about in (0. 6 cm) across hang in umbrella-shaped clusters of 2 - 4 flowers each {{along the length of}} the stem. The fruits are bright red berries about 1 / 3 in (1 cm) long that are borne on narrow stalks. They mature during late summer and fall and persist through the winter. NOTE: Japanese barberry may be confused with American barberry (Berberis canadensis), the only native species of barberry in North America, and common or <b>European</b> <b>barberry</b> (Berberis vulgaris) which is an introduced, sometimes invasive plant.
