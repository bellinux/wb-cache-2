25|$|The {{role of the}} <b>centre</b> half <b>forward</b> {{who wears}} the number 11 jersey, is to build up attacks and feed {{the ball to the}} full <b>forward</b> line. The <b>centre</b> half <b>forward</b> is {{responsible}} for taking shots on goal and points when opportunities present themselves. The <b>centre</b> <b>forward</b> will cover a lot of ground and utilising speedy half forwards to run at defences is a common tactic. The <b>centre</b> <b>forward</b> also helps win breaking ball in the midfield, helping to win the possession to bring the ball <b>forward.</b> The <b>centre</b> <b>forward</b> operates from the midfield to the opposition's 45-metre line.|$|R

50|$|Secondly, he was {{responsible}} for the tactical concept of a deep-lying <b>centre</b> <b>forward.</b> At the time, the majority of footballing sides adopted the WM formation, where the <b>centre</b> <b>forward</b> spearheaded an attack line of 3 forwards and 2 wingers. Sebes's tactic was to withdraw the <b>centre</b> <b>forward</b> back to the midfield, as well as dropping the wingers back to the midfield when necessary. This effectively created an extremely flexible 2-3-3-2 formation, allowing the team to quickly switch between attack and defense. The tactic also drew defenders out of position, as centre halves used to man-marking a <b>centre</b> <b>forward</b> would follow the deep-lying <b>centre</b> <b>forward</b> back to the midfield.|$|R
