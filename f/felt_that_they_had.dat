5|$|The Montreal Expos hired Virdon {{as their}} manager before the 1983 season, {{replacing}} Jim Fanning, {{and signed a}} two-year contract. During the 1984 season, Virdon expressed his to Expos general manager John McHale {{that he did not}} want to return to the Expos in 1985. With a 64–67 record in August 1984, the Expos fired Virdon during the 1984 season, replacing him with Fanning. Gary Lucas, a pitcher for the Expos, <b>felt</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>had</b> lost many one-run games because Virdon was too conservative in his managing, not employing the hit and run play and relying on the starting pitcher for long in the game.|$|E
5|$|Ratchet & Clank: Up Your Arsenal was {{the main}} focus of the Insomniac Team during development. The team of around 115 people were aiming to create a new Ratchet and Clank game that would differ {{significantly}} from its predecessors and almost end up being two games in one. Insomniac believed that one of the key processes in the development process was the rigorous testing. Working closely with Sony and listening to fans of the Ratchet and Clank series, they gathered feedback and made improvements to the game. They <b>felt</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>had</b> created a game that would appeal to a number of genres with the inclusion of elements of platform, action and side-scrolling gameplay.|$|E
5|$|The {{size of the}} Legions {{decreased}} {{after the}} Treaty of Luneville (9 February 1801), which to the disappointment of the legionnaires {{made no mention of}} Poland. The Legions was transferred to police duties in the Kingdom of Etruria. The Legions' morale weakened as Poles were not used in any fights that seemed to directly affect the chance of Poland regaining independence. Many legionnaires, including General Kniaziewicz, <b>felt</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>had</b> been used by the French and resigned. Dąbrowski remained in command, and reorganized both Legions at Milan into two 6,000-strong units in March 1801. On 21 December 1801 the Legions were reorganized by the French government into three demi-brigades, with the Italian (First) Legion forming the core of the First and Second Foreign Demi-Brigades (1er and 2e Demi-Brigade Étrangère), and the Danube (Second) Legion, the Third Foreign Demi-Brigade (3e Demi-Brigade Étrangère).|$|E

5|$|While {{policies}} {{were brought in}} to improve the living conditions of the working classes, conversely many middle-class Bolivians <b>felt</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>had</b> seen their social standing decline, with Morales personally mistrusting the middle-classes, deeming them fickle. A 2006 law reallocated state-owned lands, with this agrarian reform entailing distributing land to traditional communities rather than individuals. In 2010, a law was introduced permitting the formation of recognised indigenous territories, although the implementation of this was hampered by bureaucracy and contesting claims over ownership. Morales' regime also sought to improve women's rights in Bolivia. In 2010, it founded a Unit of Depatriarchalization to oversee this process. Further seeking to provide legal recognition and support to LGBT rights, it declared June 28 to be Sexual Minority Rights Day in the country, and encouraged {{the establishment of a}} gay-themed television show on the state channel.|$|E
5|$|With {{the support}} of the population, Van der Noot {{launched}} a persecution of Vonckists known as the Statist Terror (Statistisch Schrikbewind). Verlooy and Vandermersh were arrested and imprisoned. Vonck and his remaining supporters forced into exile in Lille where they tried to raise opposition to the Statists but in vain. Faced with an increasingly reactionary government in the United Belgian States, many of the exiled Vonckists <b>felt</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>had</b> more to gain from negotiating with Leopold II than with the revolutionaries. Amid rumours of Austrian military forces nearing Belgium, the Statists put their faith in a foreign military intervention and began lobbying the Prussians, who were believed to be sympathetic, for support.|$|E
5|$|During {{the pulp}} era, {{explicit}} sexuality {{of any kind}} was rare in genre science fiction and fantasy. For many years, the editors who controlled what was published <b>felt</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>had</b> to protect the adolescent male readership that they identified as their principal market. Although the covers of some 1930s pulp magazines showed scantily clad women menaced by tentacled aliens, the covers were often more lurid than the magazines' contents. In such a context, writers like Edgar Pangborn, who featured passionate male friendships in his work, were exceptional; almost {{until the end of}} their careers, including so much as a kiss would have been too much. Implied or disguised sexuality was as important as that which was openly revealed. As such, genre SF reflected the social mores of the day, paralleling common prejudices; This was particularly true of pulp fiction, more so than literary works of the time.|$|E

IGN's Rad found the character of Reza to be likable, and Game Informers Javy Gwaltney considered his story fascinating. The game's acting also received high praise; IGN's Rad called the performances [...] "powerful", and Kotakus Narcisse <b>felt</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>have</b> the ability to [...] "pull players into the drama". Gameplanet's Todd <b>felt</b> <b>that</b> the characters often [...] "speak in exposition rather than emotion", but that [...] "when the drama works, it really works".|$|R
5|$|Over the winter, {{there was}} some tension among the Allies. In particular, the Athenians, who were not {{protected}} by the Isthmus, but whose fleet {{was the key to}} the security of the Peloponnesus, <b>felt</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>had</b> been treated unfairly, and so they refused to join the Allied navy in the spring. Mardonius remained in Thessaly, knowing an attack on the Isthmus was pointless, while the Allies refused to send an army outside the Peloponessus. Mardonius moved to break the stalemate, by offering peace to the Athenians, using Alexander I of Macedon as an intermediate. The Athenians made sure that a Spartan delegation was on hand to hear the Athenians reject the Persians' offer. Athens was thus evacuated again, and the Persians marched south and re-took possession of it. Mardonius now repeated his offer of peace to the Athenian refugees on Salamis. Athens, with Megara and Plataea, sent emissaries to Sparta demanding assistance, and threatening to accept the Persian terms if they were not aided. In response, the Spartans summoned a large army from the Peloponnese cities and marched to meet the Persians.|$|E
5|$|Scott {{frequently}} {{clashed with}} the legislature, including once when the Senate refused to confirm the appointment of Dr. Walter Brashear as lieutenant colonel commandant of the state militia's second regiment. The governor refused to nominate anyone else for the position, saying that Brashear was the best person for it, and he assumed the senators {{would not want to}} be sent a worse nomination. He employed his gubernatorial veto three times {{over the course of his}} tenure, but all three were overridden by the legislature. Measures creating Harrison County and allowing squatters to purchase occupied land on more favorable terms were both vetoed because Scott <b>felt</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>had</b> been passed too hastily to allow proper debate. Scott also vetoed the revocation of a pension granted to recently retired Kentucky Court of Appeals justice George Muter, because he felt it undermined citizens' confidence in the promises of their government.|$|E
5|$|A {{state of}} civil {{disorder}} {{existed in the}} island's mountainous region after {{the invasion of the}} United States. The local Criollo, who now found themselves unemployed and <b>felt</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>had</b> been exploited by their former employers, formed bands called 'Partidas". The Partidas, at first attacked and robbed many of the wealthy plantation owners, who were loyal to the Spanish Crown, in vengeance, however they later began to attack the businesses owned by the local natives. One of the most notable leaders of the Partidas was José Maldonado Román a.k.a. 'Aguila Blanca". Maldonado, who operated in the areas of Juana Díaz and Ponce, harassed the Spanish Civil Guard and later did the same to the American Forces. Another factor contributing to the state of civil disorder on the island was the lack of discipline of the American troops who were stationed on the island. These troops were not professional soldiers and were composed of volunteers. Many instances were reported where these men would act disorderly, under the influence of alcohol, and get into fights with the local residents. The state of civil disorder came to a halt on the island after the military government began to rebuild Puerto Rico's infrastructure, thereby providing employment for many of the discontented and unemployed population, and when the volunteer troops were replaced by the regular Army.|$|E

2500|$|As {{stated above}} in [...] "Concerns and Controversies", many female writers <b>have</b> <b>felt</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>have</b> no {{place within the}} long poem genre because of its epic roots. The epic is a {{historically}} masculine genre and has not welcomed female writers or other authors who are not male and white. The long poem is often understood as the epic reborn, making it seem like a genre inaccessible to women. Women who did participate within the long poem and epic forms were often highly criticized or overlooked until recently, as there has been increasing interest in such authors as H.D.|$|R
5000|$|Another essay titled Popular Protest and the Free Goa Press (pp 91-113) in Norman Dantas' The Transformation of Goa (The Other India Press, Mapusa, 1999) argues: [...] "In Goa, {{the daily}} newspapers' {{editorial}} stances on various protest movements {{would tend to}} reveal a largely unfriendly attitude towards such actions. It is not perhaps coincidental that individuals and groups involved in protest issues in Goa <b>have</b> often <b>felt</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>have</b> received an unfair deal from the media." [...] It looks at protest and the media response to it in Goa over a three decade period, from the early 1960s to the 1990s.|$|R
5|$|Aside from Æthelberht's {{granting}} {{of freedom of}} worship to his wife, the choice of Kent was probably dictated {{by a number of}} other factors. Kent was the dominant power in southeastern Britain. Since the eclipse of King Ceawlin of Wessex in 592, Æthelberht was the leading Anglo-Saxon ruler; Bede refers to Æthelberht as having imperium (overlordship) south of the River Humber. Trade between the Franks and Æthelberht's kingdom was well established, and the language barrier between the two regions was apparently only a minor obstacle, as the interpreters for the mission came from the Franks. Lastly, Kent's proximity to the Franks allowed support from a Christian area. There is some evidence, including Gregory's letters to Frankish kings in support of the mission, that some of the Franks <b>felt</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>had</b> a claim to overlordship over some of the southern British kingdoms at this time. The presence of a Frankish bishop could also have lent credence to claims of overlordship, if Bertha's Bishop Liudhard was felt to be acting {{as a representative of the}} Frankish church and not merely as a spiritual advisor to the queen. Frankish influence was not merely political; archaeological remains attest to a cultural influence as well.|$|E
5|$|So the {{production}} could be managed {{in the short}} time available, the movie's development was separated into three phases, with each phase being dedicated to a particular part of {{the production}} process and run by a different unit director answering to Nozue. The movie went through multiple phases of trial and error until the final product was solidified. Kingsglaive was kept a secret until 2016 when it was near completion, as the developers <b>felt</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>had</b> announced its parent video game too early. So as to remain close to the development of Final Fantasy XV, the lead staff of Kingsglaive moved from Visual Works to Business Division 2, the department of Square Enix responsible for the game's development. This was part of an overall shift in development methods when the game was changed from a spin-off to a mainline entry. In addition to the staff of Advent Children, Western companies in gaming and movie production were involved: Digic Pictures, who had worked on the graphics for the Assassin's Creed series; and Image Engine, who had worked on multiple films including Jurassic World (2015) and the television series Game of Thrones. According to Nozue, around 50 different companies were involved in the film's production: among these was Europe-based company Puppetworks Animation Studio. The internal team was estimated at around 50 people. The cooperation of studios overseas meant that work on the movie could proceed continuously. Without this external aid, Nozue estimated that they would have needed a staff of five hundred people to complete the film in the given timeframe.|$|E
5|$|These {{troubles}} {{were followed}} in 1347 by the Black Death, a pandemic that spread throughout Europe {{during the following}} three years. The death toll was probably about 35 million people in Europe, {{about one-third of the}} population. Towns were especially hard-hit because of their crowded conditions. Large areas of land were left sparsely inhabited, and in some places fields were left unworked. Wages rose as landlords sought to entice the reduced number of available workers to their fields. Further problems were lower rents and lower demand for food, both of which cut into agricultural income. Urban workers also <b>felt</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>had</b> a right to greater earnings, and popular uprisings broke out across Europe. Among the uprisings were the jacquerie in France, the Peasants' Revolt in England, and revolts in the cities of Florence in Italy and Ghent and Bruges in Flanders. The trauma of the plague led to an increased piety throughout Europe, manifested by the foundation of new charities, the self-mortification of the flagellants, and the scapegoating of Jews. Conditions were further unsettled by the return of the plague {{throughout the rest of the}} 14th century; it continued to strike Europe periodically during the rest of the Middle Ages.|$|E

[...] Most of the secondary school teachers are studying for a higher qualification that is not for teaching. This shows that the incentive for further education is low {{and there are other}} jobs that have a higher benefit as compared to teaching in Rwanda. Overall, the lack of quality in the education system, such as the standards of the teachers, lack of facilities and resources makes schooling unattractive.|$|R
