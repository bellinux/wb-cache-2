In September 2002, NBC also aired a situation comedy entitled In-Laws. During the development of the sitcom, NBC called it [...] "a Meet the Parents project" [...] which prompted an investigation by Universal into whether NBC was infringing on Universal's copyright. Universal did not pursue any action against NBC but neither show lasted more than one season.|$|E
500|$|As {{children}} {{coming of}} age, Scout and Jem face hard realities {{and learn from}} them. Lee seems to examine Jem's sense of loss about how his neighbors have disappointed him more than Scout's. Jem says to their neighbor Miss Maudie {{the day after the}} trial, [...] "It's like bein' a caterpillar wrapped in a cocoon... I always thought Maycomb folks were the best <b>folks</b> <b>in</b> the world, least that's what they seemed like". This leads him to struggle with understanding the separations of race and class. Just as the novel is an illustration of the changes Jem faces, it is also an exploration of the realities Scout must face as an atypical girl on the verge of womanhood. As one scholar writes, [...] "To Kill a Mockingbird can be read as a feminist Bildungsroman, for Scout emerges from her childhood experiences with a clear sense of her place in her community and an awareness of her potential power as the woman she will one day be." ...|$|E

A lot of the folks who represented summer and spring and fall had been killed and assassinated. The only season left is winter. ...Bobby Kennedy and Dr. King and John Kennedy, those were folks who represented spring and summer, and they killed them. So we wanted to do an album about where we were. And we weren't trying to depress people, hell, they were living it, they already knew but we were trying to describe it and were certainly not alone... we felt as though a part of it was the <b>folks</b> <b>in</b> charge of the political structure.

IGN reviewer Cindy White commented: [...] "This episode {{proved that the}} show can be funny without him (Steve Carell)". She also praised Rainn Wilson and John Krasinski's performance in the episode calling it [...] "one of my favorite dynamics on the show". However, she criticized the Andy-Gabe-Erin love triangle storyline, commenting: [...] "It's only been made worse by the way they've turned Gabe from meek, bumbling burocrat [...] into unhinged stalker guy." [...] She ultimately gave the episode an 8.0/10. Alan Sepinwall of HitFix called the episode [...] "fun" [...] and a [...] "drastic improvement from 'The Inner Circle. He mainly praised the return of [...] "The Dwight/Jim dynamic", writing that he [...] "briefly rethought the idea of Dwight as long-term boss", {{and went on to}} praise the writers for featuring Dwight as manager for only one episode. He ultimately concluded that [...] "the first real impression of the show after Michael was a strong one." [...] TV Squad writer Joel Keller was very positive towards the episode commenting that [...] "The story also gave me faith that Lieberstein and company might actually do a credible job of exploring the other <b>folks</b> <b>in</b> the office now that the show's dominant force, Michael, is gone".|$|E
500|$|Reagan's {{health and}} {{well-being}} became a prominent concern in 2008. In February, she suffered a fall at her Bel Air home and was taken to Saint John's Health Center in Santa Monica, California. Doctors reported {{that she did not}} break her hip as feared, and she was released from the hospital two days later. News commentators noted that Reagan's step had slowed significantly, as the following month she walked in very slow strides with John McCain. NBC's Brian Williams, who attended a dinner with Reagan in mid-2008, recalled, [...] "Mrs. Reagan's vision isn't what it always was so she was taking very halting steps as a lot of folks her age do... It is so important for <b>folks</b> <b>in</b> her age bracket and in her bracket of life to remain upright and captain of their own ship. She very much is captain of her own ship." [...] As for her mental ability, Williams remarked, [...] "She's as sharp as ever and enjoys a robust life with her friends in California, but falling is always a danger of course. She's a very stoic, hardy person full of joy and excitement for life... She is not without opinions on politics and political types these days... She is, as most of her friends described her, a pistol." ...|$|E
500|$|Moondance was {{released}} by Warner Bros. on 27 January 1970 in the United Kingdom and on 28 February 1970 in the United States, receiving immediate acclaim from critics. In a contemporary review for The Village Voice, Robert Christgau claimed that Morrison had finally fulfilled his artistic potential: [...] "Forget Astral Weeks—this is a brilliant, catchy, poetic, and completely successful LP." [...] Greil Marcus and Lester Bangs jointly reviewed the album in Rolling Stone, hailing it {{as a work of}} [...] "musical invention and lyrical confidence; the strong moods of 'Into the Mystic' and the fine, epic brilliance of 'Caravan' will carry it past many good records we'll forget in the next few years." [...] Fellow Rolling Stone critic Jon Landau found the singer's vocals overwhelming: [...] "Things fell into place so perfectly I wished there was more room to breathe. Morrison has a great voice and on Moondance he found a home for it." [...] Ralph J. Gleason from the San Francisco Chronicle also wrote of Morrison's singing as a focal point of praise: [...] "He wails as the jazz musicians speak of wailing, as the gypsies, as the Gaels and the old <b>folks</b> <b>in</b> every culture speak of it. He gets a quality of intensity in that wail which really hooks your mind, carries you along with his voice as it rises and falls in long, soaring lines." ...|$|E

500|$|Computer Gaming World writer Arinn Dembo {{called the}} storyline {{of a couple}} buying a haunted mansion [...] "a cliché so {{familiar}} that it needs no explanation", but said it still worked in a computer game because the player could directly experience it in that medium, rather than simply watching it in a film. Dembo also praised the game for featuring a female protagonist, though she said Adrienne {{was too much of}} an exaggeratedly feminine [...] "girlie-type girl". Overall, Dembo said the game [...] "achieved a new height of realism and beauty in a computer game" [...] and was [...] "an important technological leap, and represents a step forward for the whole industry". Another Computer Gaming World review said Phantasamagoria [...] "appears to deliver on its ambitious promises" [...] and that although the puzzles are too simple for experienced gamers, the appeal of the game is exploring a setting that [...] "would have had even the <b>folks</b> <b>in</b> Amityville making tracks". Harley Jebens of the Austin American-Statesman said some of the acting was [...] "hilariously bad" [...] and the storyline was predictable, but that the game keeps you engaged, the story draws you in and the controls were well executed. Fort Worth Star-Telegram writer Andy Greiser said the game was a beautiful combination of live actors and computer-built backgrounds, but said the action doesn't start to pick up until the halfway point. In a mixed review, Phil LaRose of The Advocate praised the game for having a female protagonist and excellent special effects, and said it had gone further toward merging the realms of film and game than any other computer game. He also said the game was too linear, with overly simple puzzles and a plotline with [...] "so many recycled concepts in this game, players will feel like they've seen it all before".|$|E
500|$|Teetotal and a non-smoker, O'Hara {{rejected}} the Hollywood party lifestyle, and was relatively moderate in her personal grooming. In her earlier career {{she refused to}} appear to smoke and drink on screen, {{and it was only}} later that she relented to avoid being out of a job. O'Hara was considered to be prudish in Hollywood. Malone wrote that [...] "her attitude towards sex bordered on puritanical at times, which wasn't what one expected from a sex symbol". When asked why she would not pose for scantily clad photographs O'Hara remarked: [...] "I come from a very strict family, and I can't do some of the things other actresses can because my <b>folks</b> <b>in</b> Dublin would think I turned out bad", and in 1948 she stated that she wouldn't be photographed in a bathing suit [...] "Because I don't think I looked like Lana Turner in a bathing suit, frankly. O'Hara later commented that [...] "I'm not prudish but my training was strict". She believed that her squeaky-clean lifestyle took its toll on her career. She once said, [...] "I'm a helpless victim of a Hollywood whispering campaign. Because I don't let the producer and director kiss me every morning or let them paw me they have spread around town that I am not a woman, that I am a cold piece of marble statuary" [...] and [...] "I wouldn't throw myself on the casting couch, and I know that cost me parts. I wasn't going to play the whore. That wasn't me". She vented her frustration on not being given edgier roles in an interview with The Los Angeles Times, saying [...] "Producers look at a pretty face and think: 'She must have got this far on her looks'. Then comes along a girl with a plain face and they think, 'She must be a great actress, she isn't pretty'. So they give her the glamour treatment and the pretty girl gets left behind". O'Hara believed that she missed out on a number of roles in some of the classic black and white films because she aesthetically pictured so well in Technicolor productions. Such was her natural beauty that {{she was one of the}} few actresses in Hollywood during her career to not undergo cosmetic surgery, though she had one crooked tooth which she refused to part with.|$|E
