5|$|After {{holding the}} Volunteers to a three-and-out {{to open the}} second half, the Alabama {{offensive}} responded with their first of three third-quarter touchdowns with a two-yard AJ McCarron touchdown run. On the following Tennessee drive, the Alabama defense stopped quarterback Matt Simms on a fourth-and-one to give the Crimson Tide offense {{the ball on the}} Volunteers' 39-yard line. On the next play, McCarron threw a 39-yard touchdown pass to Kenny Bell to extend the Alabama lead to 20–6. Trent Richardson then scored his first touchdown of the game on the following Alabama possession on a 12-yard run to cap a six-play, 63-yard drive. Cade Foster scored early in the fourth quarter with his 45-yard field goal, and after a Dont'a Hightower interception, Richardson scored his second touchdown of the <b>day</b> <b>on</b> <b>a</b> one-yard run to make the final score 37–6.|$|E
5|$|After {{winning the}} toss, the Australians made all their {{runs on the}} first day, with centuries for Hassett (103), Harvey (126) and Johnson (113*) and 99 for Hamence. The Australians put on 255 for the second wicket, through Hassett and Barnes, who was {{replaced}} by Harvey after retiring ill. The other Australian batsmen had all made centuries, and were keen to see Hamence do the same. The {{rest of the team}} left their card games in readiness to applaud his impending milestone, only to see him stumped for 99, his highest score for the season. On the Monday, the second <b>day,</b> <b>on</b> <b>a</b> pitch that was taking spin, Somerset collapsed twice inside four hours and less than 82 overs in total. McCool took 4/21 and 4/23, and Johnston also took eight, including 5/34 in the second innings. He took the last two wickets of the Somerset first innings as a spinner, and then had Harold Gimblett lbw with the second ball of the second innings as a fast-medium bowler to take three wickets in four balls.|$|E
5|$|He was {{released}} by Doncaster {{at his own request}} on 13 January 2009 and joined Conference Premier club Oxford United the next <b>day</b> <b>on</b> <b>a</b> contract {{until the end of the}} 2008–09 season. He made his debut in a 1–0 victory over Altrincham on 17 January 2009 and scored his first goal four days later with a shot into the top-left corner of the goal, which gave Oxford a 1–0 victory against Mansfield Town. Nelthorpe was named on standby for the England C team, who represent England at non-League level, in February 2009, for a friendly against Malta under-21s. He was sent off against Torquay United after clashing with Mustapha Carayol, which resulted in a three-match suspension, and following this he said he was looking to use his aggression more effectively. He made his return in a 2–1 victory over Kettering Town on 19 March 2009, during which he opened the scoring with a 20-yard free kick and assisted the second goal with a corner kick that was headed in by Chris Willmott. He finished the season with 16 appearances and 2 goals for Oxford.|$|E

5|$|In February 2013 Tuscaloosa Police arrested four {{football}} {{players from the}} 2012 season: Brent Calloway, Tyler Hayes, D. J. Pettway and Eddie Williams. Williams was involved in four separate incidents on February 10 and 11. On February 10 he had a dispute with a gas station clerk about paying for gas {{and said he had}} to get something in the trunk of his car. The clerk called the police, the police arrested Williams with carrying a pistol without a license, but Williams was released later that <b>day</b> <b>on</b> <b>a</b> $500 bond. Later that night around 12:30a.m., Williams attacked an Alabama student with Hayes and Pettway and they stole the student's backpack. In a separate incident almost an hour later, Williams attacked another student while Hayes and Pettway waited in a car. Later Williams used one of the students' credit cards. Calloway was also arrested after he used a victim's student debit card with knowledge it was stolen. Following the arrests, Alabama suspended all four from the football team. Alabama also prohibited Hayes, Pettway and Williams from entering campus. On February 27, Alabama dismissed all four players from the university after completing a judicial review.|$|E
5|$|Longstanding racial {{tensions}} between {{whites and blacks}} exploded in five days of violence that started on July 27, 1919. On that hot summer <b>day,</b> <b>on</b> <b>a</b> segregated Chicago beach, a white man was throwing rocks at black swimmers in the water at a beach on the South Side which resulted in Eugene Williams' death. Tensions escalated when a white police officer not only failed to arrest the white man responsible for Williams' death, but arrested a black man instead. Objections by black observers were met with violence by whites. Attacks between white and black mobs erupted swiftly. At one point, a white mob threatened Provident Hospital, many of whose patients were African American. The police successfully held them off.|$|E
5|$|On McGovern's December 15 mission over Linz, {{his second}} as pilot, {{a piece of}} {{shrapnel}} from flak came through the windshield and missed fatally wounding him by only a few inches. The following <b>day</b> <b>on</b> <b>a</b> mission to Brüx, he nearly collided with another bomber during close-formation flying in complete cloud cover. The following day, he was recommended for a medal after surviving a blown wheel on the always-dangerous B-24 take-off, completing a mission over Germany, and then landing without further damage to the plane. On a December 20 mission against the Škoda Works at Pilsen, Czechoslovakia, McGovern's plane had one engine out and another in flames after being hit by flak. Unable to return to Italy, McGovern flew to a British airfield on Vis, a small island in the Adriatic Sea off the Yugoslav coast that was controlled by Josip Broz Tito's Partisans. The short field, normally used by small fighter planes, was so unforgiving to four-engined aircraft {{that many of the}} bomber crews who tried to make emergency landings there perished. But McGovern successfully landed, saving his crew, a feat for which he was awarded the Distinguished Flying Cross.|$|E
