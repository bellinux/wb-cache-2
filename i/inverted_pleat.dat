50|$|Wrap blouses {{and dresses}} {{did away with}} a need for zippers, buttons and belts. Halter tops did away with collars. Flared and gored skirts {{provided}} fullness and ease of movement while avoiding the stiffness and puffiness of a gathered waistline. Judicious draping on dresses and jackets, <b>inverted</b> <b>pleats</b> on pants, set-in panels; all continued this body-conscious philosophy. Waistbands and cuffs became ribbed and elasticized, offering more comfort and a sleeker line, as well as protection against the elements. Scarves were built into blouses or jackets, or looped through a belt. Short sleeved jackets provided both polish and practicality. Pockets freed up a woman’s hands, as did chains and clips, which held a clip-on cigarette case, a visor, or a pair of gloves. Collars disappeared from coats and jackets, or were shrunk down to a simple stand-up style. Kimono cut coats closed with sashes or one or two oversized buttons. A slim ribbed turtleneck pullover became one with the body and removed {{the need for a}} scarf to keep the wearer’s throat warm. Thin ribbed pullovers were layered, making them ideal for cool temperatures or outdoor sports, but also easy to peel off once inside for maximum comfort.|$|R
