500|$|This {{extremely}} violent EF5 wedge tornado, with estimated {{winds of}} up to , struck the town of Smithville, Mississippi, at 3:47p.m. CDT (2047 UTC) on April 27, resulting in catastrophic damage and numerous fatalities. The tornado began [...] west-southwest of Smithville along the Tennessee–Tombigbee Waterway near the Glover Wilkins Lock at 3:42p.m. CDT (2042 UTC), snapping numerous trees near the Smithville Recreation Area. The tornado then rapidly intensified as it approached town, reaching EF5 intensity. As the storm crossed Davis Road South, the ground was deeply scoured in a nearby field. The tornado swept away numerous homes and structures as it moved northeast, following Highway 25. A semi-truck was thrown a considerable distance and destroyed in this area, and at one residence that was swept away, part of the concrete <b>foundation</b> <b>slab</b> was pulled up and dislodged slightly. A large brick funeral home {{was reduced to a}} bare slab as the tornado exited at the northeast side of town, with the debris scattered and wind-rowed into an adjacent wooded area. Nearby granite tombstones were blown over in the opposite direction of the tornado's passage. Overall, the tornado destroyed 117 structures in Smithville and damaged 50 others, killing 16 people. The tornado weakened as it continued through rural areas northeast of town and moved into Itawamba County, where it downed numerous trees and power lines and caused roof damage to a house before exiting the county.|$|E
40|$|This paper {{focuses on}} the causes and {{consequences}} of early-age cracking of mass concrete <b>foundation</b> <b>slabs</b> due to restrained volume changes. Considering the importance of water leaking through cracks {{in terms of the}} serviceability, durability and environmental impact of watertight concrete structures, emphasis is placed on the effect of temperature loads on <b>foundation</b> <b>slabs.</b> <b>Foundation</b> <b>slabs</b> are usually restrained to some degree externally or internally. To evaluate the effect of external restraints on <b>foundation</b> <b>slabs,</b> friction and interaction models are introduced. The reinforcement of concrete cannot prevent the initiation of cracking, but when cracking has occurred, it may act to reduce the spacing and width of cracks.

40|$|Abstract Concrete <b>foundation</b> <b>slabs</b> {{are usually}} exposed to {{unilateral}} drying during the curing process. The unilateral drying causes an axial shrinkage and a concave {{curvature of the}} construction. The curvature results {{from the fact that}} the upper part of the slab is drying and shrinking faster than the lower part. This is called gradient shrinkage. A problem occurs when the slab is considered fully restrained by adjoining structural parts. The deformations caused by axial contraction due to the constant part of the shrinkage and the curvature caused by gradient shrinkage of the slab are then prevented by the fact that the slab is fully restrained. When the shrinkage and the curvature are prevented, constraints occur in terms of an axial force and a bending moment. These constraints cause cracking in the upper part of the slab. These cracks can cause inconveniences for the user of the slab and the cracks should therefore be minimized. It is important to determine the precise magnitude of the constraints so that sufficient amount of reinforcement can be applied into the concrete and the crack widths can be reduced. The construction consultancy company WSP has an interest in structural design methods for reducing the risk for concrete cracking through establishing engineering guidelines for the structural design of <b>foundation</b> <b>slabs</b> which are exposed to axial and gradient shrinkage. The result in this report shows the magnitude of the constraints for slabs of varying thickness and molded with different types of concrete. The constraints are later used to determine the crack widths. Two different reinforcement standards, both in compliance with the minimum requirements of Eurocode 2, are included in the study. A conclusion based on the results shows that the amount of reinforcement can be reduced in <b>foundation</b> <b>slabs</b> up to 300 millimeters thickness without significant impact on the crack widths...|$|R
