40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this research is}} to study the effects of career development, perception of organizational justice and job satisfaction on teacher’s organizational citizenship behavior of The Public Senior High School in Gorontalo Regency, Gorontalo Province. This research used the quantitative approach with the survey method. The samples of this research were 178 employees selected randomly. The data were obtained by distributing questionnaires and analyzed by using the descriptive statistics and path analysis in inferential statistics. The results of the research can be concluded that: career development <b>had</b> <b>a</b> <b>direct</b> effect on teacher’s organizational citizenship behavior, perception of organizational justice <b>had</b> <b>a</b> <b>direct</b> effect on teacher’s organizational citizenship behavior, job satisfaction <b>had</b> <b>a</b> <b>direct</b> effect on teacher’s organizational citizenship behavior, career development <b>had</b> <b>a</b> <b>direct</b> effect on teacher’s job satisfaction, perception of organizational justice <b>had</b> <b>a</b> <b>direct</b> effect on teacher’s job satisfaction.

For factors that are variable, the table notes if it <b>has</b> <b>a</b> <b>direct</b> relationship or an inverse relationship.

If the factor is a toggle (enabled or disabled) function then it has either a positive or negative relationship.|$|E
5|$|Series creator Stephen Hillenburg {{has served}} as the {{executive}} producer {{over the course of the}} series' entire history, and functioned as the showrunner from the series' debut in 1999 until 2004. The series went on hiatus in 2002, after Hillenburg halted production to work on a feature film of the series, The SpongeBob SquarePants Movie. Once the film was finalized and the third season finished, Hillenburg resigned as the series' showrunner. Although he no longer <b>has</b> <b>a</b> <b>direct</b> role in the production of the series, he still maintains an advisory role and reviews each episode.|$|E
5|$|The fan {{diameter}} {{varies with}} the different models of the CFM56, and that change <b>has</b> <b>a</b> <b>direct</b> impact on the engine performance. For example, the low-pressure shaft rotates {{at the same speed}} for both the CFM56-2 and the CFM56-3 models; the fan diameter is smaller on the -3, which lowers the tip speed of the fan blades. The lower speed allows the fan blades to operate more efficiently (5.5% more in this case), which increases the overall fuel efficiency of the engine (improving specific fuel consumption nearly 3%).|$|E

5|$|The {{meaning of}} the word law in Article 9(1) <b>has</b> <b>a</b> <b>direct</b> bearing on the scope of the Article. If law is read broadly (for example, as {{incorporating}} customary international law principles), the scope of the fundamental liberties would be wider. It would be narrower if, on the other hand, law is construed narrowly, as the Legislature would be able to curtail such rights through legislation more easily. This could lead to a watering-down of the emphasis on fundamental liberties, as any infringement might be considered legitimate so long as the statute in question was validly enacted.|$|E

Although {{it has been}} argued that clock shifts correlate with decreased economic efficiency, and that in 2000 the daylight-saving effect implied an estimated one-day loss of $31billion on U.S. stock exchanges, the estimated numbers depend on the methodology. The results have been disputed, and the original authors have refuted the points raised by disputers.|$|E

5|$|East of I-405, SR522 enters Woodinville {{and follows}} Little Bear Creek {{as it turns}} north away from the city's downtown, {{intersecting}} SR202. The freeway enters Snohomish County and intersects SR9 south of the Brightwater sewage treatment plant. It continues in a stairstep pattern, moving north and east with sharp turns to parallel the Eastside Rail Corridor, through a predominantly rural area In Maltby, the freeway reaches an at-grade intersection with Paradise Lake Road (SR524) and becomes a two-lane undivided highway. SR522 travels northeast from Maltby, intersecting Echo Lake Road in a single-point urban interchange, and crosses the Snohomish River into Monroe. Within Monroe, the highway widens to a four-lane freeway with median separation and intersects Main Street in a dogbone interchange near the Monroe Correctional Complex. SR522 cuts across suburban housing areas in Monroe, and crosses over US2 and the BNSF Railway near the Evergreen State Fairgrounds. The highway makes a 180-degree turn south to intersect with US2, where it terminates; the intersection also <b>has</b> <b>a</b> <b>direct</b> offramp for eastbound traffic from SR522 to eastbound US2.|$|E

5|$|Nicolas Roeg had {{employed}} the fractured editing style of Don't Look Now on his previous films, Performance and Walkabout, {{but it was}} originated by editor Antony Gibbs on Petulia. Roeg served as the cinematographer on Petulia, which incidentally also starred Julie Christie, and Gibbs went on to edit Performance and Walkabout for Roeg. Roeg's use of colour—especially red—can {{be traced back to}} earlier work: both Performance and Walkabout feature scenes where the whole screen turns red, similar in nature to the scene during Christine's drowning when the spilt water on the church slide causes a reaction that makes it—along with the whole screen—turn completely red. The mysterious red-coated figure and its association with death <b>has</b> <b>a</b> <b>direct</b> parallel with an earlier film Roeg worked on as cinematographer, The Masque of the Red Death, which depicted a red clad Grim Reaper character. The fleeting glimpses of the mysterious red-coated figure possibly draw on Proust: in Remembrance of Things Past, while in Venice, the narrator catches sight of a red gown in the distance which brings pack painful memories of his lost love.|$|E

Formerly, railways connected Odense to most of Funen's coastal cities, but these links were closed down in the 1950s and 1960s. Today, these regional routes are served by buses operated by the public company FynBus, which also operates the town's municipal bus service, connecting the town's suburbs to the city centre.|$|E

On the other hand, if the Tribunal decides to the contrary, the Prime Minister may opt to submit the bill to the electorate. If the bill is supported at a national referendum by not less than two-thirds of the total number of votes cast, the President is deemed to have assented to the bill on the day immediately following the day when the results of the referendum have been published in the Government Gazette.|$|E
