5|$|A Hero's Song is musically {{structured}} like a four-movement symphony, {{beginning with}} an allegro con fuoco, transitioning {{to a slow}} poco adagio lacrimosa, then including a scherzo and concluding with a coda. The piece {{is based on a}} short, energetic theme in B minor played in the violas, cellos, and basses {{at the start of the}} piece.

Following this, a slow section is marked by quiet music which symbolizes the hero's <b>grief.</b> It includes a funeral march, a musical form Dvořák also used in his Requiem, Stabat Mater, and Piano Quintet No. 2.

Finally, the triumph of the hero is represented by the victorious coda. The piece has a run time of approximately 22 minutes.|$|E
