40|$|Infrared multiphoton {{dissociation}} {{experiments with}} one or two wavelengths in perfluoropropene and <b>difluorochloromethane</b> have been carried out. It is shown that the additional nonresonant wavelength induces an increase of the yield and selectivity of the dissociation process in the larger molecule and an enhancement of the vibrational intermode coupling in the smaller molecule. A rather surprising structure in the dissociation yield-pressure plot has also been discovered for perfluoropropene at the most effective low pressures. © 1990.

40|$|Introduction. Biologically active {{substances}} (BAS) of barberry roots represented by alkaloids of isoquinoline group are perspective substances {{for development of}} preparations with multiple pharmacological activities. However, now manufacture of them in Ukraine is stopped. One of the reasons of this is out-of-date production technologies of alkaloids involving use of toxic and/or flammable solvents. In the article possibility for application of liquefied gases in technology of obtaining of alkaloids from barberry roots has been studied. Materials and methods. Initial raw herb drug were barberry (Berberis vulgaris) roots harvested in spring on the territory of Southern Ukraine. Their moisture content was 11 %, comminuting degree was 0, 5 - 1, 4 mm. At the first stage purification of raw herb drug from lipophilic impurities (defatting) was made with use of some liquefied gases: tetrafluoroethane, isobutane, <b>difluorochloromethane</b> and difluoromethane. Extraction of the alkaloid sum was made with difluoromethane mixed with various quantities of liquid ammonia or diethylamine as alkaline agent. Crude extracts were exposed to two-level liquefiedgas purification. At first the alkaloid bases were transformed into saline forms with aqueous solutions of acids and purified from ballast impurities with liquefied freon- 22. Then alkaloid salts were reextracted from aqueous phase in the base form with liquefied mixture of difluoromethane and ammonia. Mixing of liquid phases was provided by creation of alternate gradients of temperatures and, as consequence, pressures between separators feeding alternately cool water into jacket of one of them, and warm water – into jacket of another one. Quantity of lipophilic ballast impurities and also weight of extractives were determined gravimetrically. Quantitative analysis of the alkaloid sum was made by titrimetric method after sedimentation of alkaloids with volumetric solution of phosphomolybdic acid. Results and discussion. It {{has been found that}} at stage of degreasing of raw crude drug the most selective solvent to lipophilic ballast compounds was isobutane and <b>difluorochloromethane,</b> but the latter was more rational for using in industrial scale concerning its fire-safety and economic availability. It has been also found that efficiency of the purification stage of Berberis alkaloids appreciably depends on composition of extracting solvent while obtaining of crude extracts. The best parameters in the finished product have been revealed after purification of the extracts obtained with difluoromethane containing 12 % of liquid ammonia: quantity of BAS (alkaloids) in the finished product reached 95 %, and their losses were insignificant – 3, 5 %. Increasing of cosolvent (ammonia) content in the extracting solvent considerably complicated purification of extractives, and losses of alkaloids raised to 13, 2 %, obviously as a result of presence of considerable quantity of hydrophylic ballast substances. Reducing of the ammonia content in the extracting solvent down to 1 % also caused negative impact on process of obtaining of the alkaloids which yield was the lowest among investigated assays. It’s possible to explain this by lower рН value in extracting medium, change of solvent polarity, therefore middle-polar and hydrophobic compounds preferably passed into composition of crude extracts. Conclusions. Acceptability for use of liquefied gases and their mixtures for purification of the alkaloid sum from barberry roots has been proved. It has been shown that prior to stage of extraction of these BAS it’s expedient to withdraw lipophilic impurities from the crude herbal drug with liquified <b>difluorochloromethane</b> (freon- 22). Purification efficiency of the finished product considerably depends on composition of extracting solvent during obtaining of crude extracts. The best parameters were found after purification of the extracts taken with difluoromethane containing 12 % of liquid ammonia. It’s the most expedient to purify crude extracts by two-step procedure using on the first step liquefied <b>difluorochloromethane</b> (freon- 22) as organic phase and on the second one – difluoromethane mixed with 10 % of ammonia, and as aqueous phase – 10 % acidic solutions; at the second step it’s necessary to provide liquid reextraction of the alkaloid bases in triplicate...|$|E
40|$|Multiphoton {{dissociation}} {{experiments in}} perfluoropropene and <b>difluorochloromethane</b> {{have been carried}} out with one or two wavelengths. It is shown that the increase of selectivity induced by a nonresonant radiation is attributable to an enlagement of the unimolecular reaction regime. The behaviour of large and small molecules when irradiated with two IR laser beams is different. Whereas the distinguishability between unimolecular and collisional regimes is enhanced for sufficiently large molecules, it tends to be smoothed in the case of small molecules. © 1990.

40|$|The {{inhibition}} of methane oxidation by cell suspensions of Methylococcus capsulatus (Bath) exposed to hydrochlorofluorocarbon 21 (HCFC- 21; <b>difluorochloromethane</b> [CHF(inf 2) Cl]), HCFC- 22 (fluorodichloromethane [CHFCl(inf 2) ]), and various fluorinated methanes was investigated. HCFC- 21 inhibited methane oxidation {{to a greater}} extent than HCFC- 22, for both the particulate and soluble methane monooxygenases. Among the fluorinated methanes, both methyl fluoride (CH(inf 3) F) and difluoromethane (CH(inf 2) F(inf 2)) were inhibitory while fluoroform (CHF(inf 3)) and carbon tetrafluoride (CF(inf 4)) were not. The {{inhibition of}} methane oxidation by HCFC- 21 and HCFC- 22 was irreversible, while that by methyl fluoride was reversible. The HCFCs also proved inhibitory to methanol dehydrogenase, which suggests that they disrupt other aspects of C(inf 1) catabolism in addition to methane monooxygenase activity...|$|E
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this work was to make {{qualitative}} and quantitative analysis of phenolic biologically active substances (BAS) in the extracts produced from lime flowers with condensed gases, using method of high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC). Materials and methods: materials {{for this study were}} the extracts obtained by consequent processing of the herbal drug and marcs thereof with various condensed gases: <b>difluorochloromethane</b> (Freon R 22), difluoromethane (Freon R 32), azeotropic mixture of difluoromethane with pentafluoroethane (Freon 410 A) and freon-ammonium mixture. Extracts obtained with the latter were subjected to further fractionation by liquidliquid separation into hexane, chloroform, ethyl acetate and aqueous-alcohol phases. Besides, the supercritical СО 2 extract, obtained from the herbal drug under rather strong conditions (at temperature 60 °С and pressure 400 bar), was studied in our previous research. Presence of phenolic BAS and their quantity in the researched samples were determined by method of HPLC with UVspectrometric detection.

40|$|Introduction. The {{article is}} devoted to the {{development}} of techniques for quantitative analysis of lime flower in order to make amendments to existing pharmacopoeian monographs for this herbal drug. Lime inflorescences contain lipophilic biologically active substances (BAS) causing notable antimicrobial and anti-inflammatory effects and also more polar phenolic compounds with antiulcer activity. Considering this, it’s necessary to regulate all these groups of BAS quantitatively. Materials and methods. For this study six batches of lime flowers harvested in 2008 - 2009 yrs. in Kharkiv, Rivno and Zhitomir regions were used as crude herbal drug. Loss on drying was determined by routine pharmacopoeian procedures. Total content of lipophilic substances was determined gravimetrically after Soxhlet extraction of samples 1, 5, 7 and 10 g in weight with methylene chloride, considering that by its extracting ability this solvent is close to liquefied <b>difluorochloromethane</b> (freon R 22) used by us for obtaining of lipophilic complexes. The duration of complete analytical extraction was determined by infusion of six 10 g assays of lime flowers during 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 hours, then quantity of lipophilic extractives was revealed gravimetrically. Quantity of essential oil in lime flowers was evaluated under the procedure of ЕР 7, 2. 8. 12. Weight of the herbal drug sample was 200 g, distillation rate – 2, 5 - 3, 5 ml/min, volume of distillation liquid (water) – 500 ml, volume of xylene in the graduated tube – 0, 50 ml. Total flavonoid content recalculated to quercetin was determined after hydrolysis with acidified acetone, withdrawing of flavonoid aglycones with ethylacetate and by further spectrophotometry of their complexes with aluminium chloride. All quantitative determinations were replicated five times for each assay. All chemicals and reagents were of analytical grade. Results and discussion. It was found that adequate accuracy of the analysis of lipophilic extractives taken with methylene chloride was achieved if assay weight is not less than 7 g: relative error was less than 2 %. Study of extraction kinetics showed that after 4 hours lipophilic substances soluble in methylene chloride were taken almost completely. Analyzing 6 batches of lime flowers from different Ukrainian regions, it was found that yield of total extractives taken with methylene chloride did fall within insignificant limits – 1, 86 - 2, 26 %, that testifies onto rather stable accumulation of these biologically active substances in lime flowers even despite different climatic conditions. Essential oil content varied in rather wide limits – 0, 34 - 0, 55 ml/kg of herbal drug and considerably depended on harvest place: in the batches from Northwest of Ukraine this value was less than in the Eastern ones. Year of harvesting had less influence on quantity of essential oil in lime flowers. The relative error of the quantitative determinations was within 4 – 8 %. Total flavonoid content in the analyzed batches of lime flowers was considerably variable (from 0, 30 to 0, 52 %) and depended mainly on place of harvesting, and this crude herbal drug from the northwest of Ukraine (Rivno region) showed the highest results among the analyzed samples. Besides, if consider the lower limit regulated by the monograph of Belarusian Pharmacopoeia, p. 370, then only one batch conformed to the norm (not less than 0, 5 %). Therefore it’s recommended to fix the lower limit 0, 3 % for content of total flavonoids in the corresponding monograph draft or analytical normative documentation. The relative error of the quantitative determinations of flavonoids was within 1, 5 – 3, 1 %. Conclusion. Six batches of lime flowers harvested in various regions of Ukraine in 2008 and 2009 yrs. were investigated. Based on the results obtained it is offered to regulate the following quantity parameters in the amended monograph draft for lime flower: total extractives taken with methylene chloride – not less than 1, 8 %, essential oil content – not less than 0, 3 ml/kg, total flavonoid content recalculated as quercetin - not less than 0, 3 %...|$|E
