5|$|Regarding public housing, Tufaro {{called for}} renovations rather than <b>demolishing</b> vacant buildings, which drew criticism, as Housing Commissioner Daniel P.

Tufaro further proposed a plan for school vouchers and to drug test students, which drew opposition from the Baltimore Teachers Union and from O'Malley, who favored expanding pre-kindergarten and after-school programs, while making summer school mandatory. When discussing the problem of HIV/AIDS in Baltimore, which disproportionately affects African Americans, both O'Malley and Tufaro promised to continue the city's needle exchange program.|$|E

Widening and straightening of Princess Street in 1939-1940 resulted in the <b>demolishing</b> of Kew's gatehouses, loss of land and the relocation of the main gates to Victoria Park, Kew.

5|$|By 1999, the Newby-McMahon Building {{had proved}} to be an {{excessive}} burden on the limited capital reserves of the WCHS.

Others opposed to the project complained about the high taxes resulting from its high cost, poor compensation for seized property and the lack of public input into the project. The press accused Anspach of being responsible for <b>demolishing</b> Brussels' old town, and published numerous caricatures mocking him.|$|E
