25|$|The {{relationship}} between Baldwin IV and Guy of Lusignan deteriorated. Baldwin IV removed <b>Guy</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> regency and denied his right of succession, making Guy's stepson (Sybilla's son {{from her first}} marriage), Baldwin V, his heir and co-ruler on 20 November 1183. A version of Ernoul's chronicle suggests that the child Baldwin V was made heir, because the ailing Baldwin IV wanted to avoid a debate between his sisters' supporters about his succession. Guy's principal supporters, Joscelin of Courtenay and Raynald of Châtillon, were not present at Baldwin V's coronation, because they attended the wedding of Isabella and Humphrey of Toron.|$|E

According to Bell, [...] "The way the shows usually work out, Mulder is the one to figure out who the bad guys are. So I went into the story meeting with the idea of having Mulder being wrong. Because Mulder believes so strong it's the other guy, it helped hide the true identity of the bad <b>guy</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> audience." ...|$|E
500|$|Religious writer Michel Clasquin {{said the}} episode also {{demonstrates}} {{the ease with}} which people blend their religious convictions with lessons from pop culture, particularly with Stan's confusion of a Star Trek quote with a lesson from Jesus Christ. Additionally, Clasquin said the fact that even Priest Maxi recognizes Jesus as [...] "that <b>guy</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> public access show" [...] demonstrates that even the supposedly most religious people are not always the most open to genuine religious experiences. Clasquin also said elements of the Crucifixion of Jesus are alluded to in the boxing match with Satan.|$|E

500|$|Dylan McDermott {{was cast}} as the lead Ben Harmon in late April 2011. His {{character}} was initially described as [...] "a handsome and masculine but sensitive therapist who loves his family but has hurt his wife." [...] McDermott stated {{that he wanted to}} do the role to break away from his previous role as Bobby Donnell in the ABC series The Practice. [...] "This was exactly why I wanted to do this show – to change it up and do a different kind of character. People think of me as the <b>guy</b> <b>from</b> <b>The</b> Practice... I wanted to turn that [...] on its head and hopefully I'm doing that [...] ", he said.|$|E
500|$|At his pizzeria, Nino reveals to Bernie that a {{low-level}} Philadelphia wise <b>guy</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> [...] "East Coast mob" [...] stashed the {{money at the}} pawnshop. Since anyone tied to the robbery could lead the East Coast Italian Mafia to them, they need to kill everyone involved. Bernie warns Nino that nobody steals from the Italian Mob. Nino is angry because the Italian Mob has marginalized and insulted {{him because of his}} Jewish heritage. He convinces Bernie to follow his plan. Bernie then murders Cook, as he is the sole witness to their agreement. After Shannon refuses to divulge the whereabouts of the Driver, Bernie kills him at the auto shop with a straight razor.|$|E
500|$|Although the Daddies were {{experiencing}} commercial success {{under the guise}} of swing revivalists, having been declared the [...] "leaders" [...] of the movement by Rolling Stone, the band openly contested being labeled a retro act at the exclusion of their dominant ska and punk influences and modernist lyricism. While still vocal supporters of both the swing revival and its bands, the Daddies adamantly tried to disassociate themselves from the swing scene and in particular its nostalgia-based mentality. Perry explained to Spin in July 1998, [...] "it's not our mission to be a swing band. I'm not a <b>guy</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> '40s. That's why we play ska and use heavy guitars", noting elsewhere [...] "I can't fully take us out of the retro classification, but we harp on the fact that we're contemporary music". Thusly, the Daddies avoided touring with swing bands, selecting Latin rock group Ozomatli and ska/soul band The Pietasters as support on their first headlining U.S. tour, and opening for Argentine rock band Los Fabulosos Cadillacs on their 1998 North American tour. At one point, the Daddies attempted to arrange a tour with Primus which never materialized; said Perry, [...] "I know there are people who come to our shows who'd like nothing more than for us to play swing 24/7...there are plenty of bands who want to be swing bands and swing bands only. We're trying to find the audience who'll let us write songs and just be who we are".|$|E

500|$|Lyrically, [...] "Soldier" [...] is a {{continuation}} of the previous song on Destiny Fulfilled, [...] "Lose My Breath". As the singers feel that their man does not fulfill them in the way they want, they tell him [...] "I need a soldier", further [...] "upping their standards". They request their man to be a [...] "", proclaiming their love for [...] "country boys"; their preference include a [...] "soldier" [...] who is [...] "street" [...] and [...] "hood". MacPherson further felt that the trio cruised the ghetto for suitable men with [...] "Soldier", an [...] "ode to gangsta love". Corey Moss of MTV felt that the song {{was one of the most}} personal moments on Destiny Fulfilled in the sense that Beyoncé's then-relatively secret relationship with rapper Jay-Z was acknowledged [...] "on record for the first time". Moss further elaborated, [...] "Albeit minor, her [...] verse (about falling for a <b>guy</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> BK, as in Jay's Brooklyn stomping grounds) offers a rare moment of commentary on the couple, which has thus far only been chronicled by tabloid photographers." [...] The song opens with T.I. rhyming lines and glorifying the profound love [...] "between a thug and a thugette". As the song progresses, each member of Destiny's Child describes their own favorite type of man, later harmonizing together for the chorus. Midway through the song, Lil Wayne's verse contains a reference to rapper B.G.. Williams is the last artist to sing her solo lines, which were described as [...] "the sexiest" [...] by Rashod Ollisong of The Baltimore Sun.|$|E
2500|$|On 21 October 2012, Van Damme {{was honored}} with a life-size statue {{of himself in}} his {{hometown}} of Brussels.

He is the husband of Kirsten, the father of Seth Cohen, and the legal {{guardian}} of Ryan Atwood. Although he lives in a large upper class house, his politics are left-leaning and open-minded, causing friction between himself and the community. Peter Gallagher described the character as a [...] "leftie Jewish <b>guy</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> Bronx." [...] Sandy deals with many conflicts throughout the series, such as trying to gain acceptance from his father-in-law while being financially supported by his wife, and raising two teenagers in a (sometimes) corrupt environment.|$|E

2500|$|Scenes {{from the}} film A Clockwork Orange were filmed in Friars Square in Aylesbury but {{did not make it}} to the final cut. This is the 'Librarian Scene' where outtakes from the shoot and {{rehearsal}} can be seen in Alison Castle's The Stanley Kubrick Archives published by Taschen. The opening scene when the droogs beat up the elderly Irishman is mistakenly cited as being filmed in the underpass linking Friars Square Shopping Centre with the railway station. Although Christiane Kubrick's book Stanley Kubrick– A Life in Pictures states this the underpass in the film has a different shape to the one in Aylesbury and these sequences were actually filmed in Wandsworth. According to Malcolm McDowell: [...] "We did a sequence in Aylesbury. The town square was decorated with giant rubber ducks, weird animals, they were huge, and we accosted an old <b>guy</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> library. I ripped out these priceless books that he had and I threw them up. I remember my line, it was taken from the book, it was: 'There's a mackerel of a cornflake for you.' The pages from the ripped books fall like confetti. The retribution was that Alex goes to the library when he is cured and all the old codgers in the library go: 'You were the one!'" ...|$|E
2500|$|LOD {{would return}} {{a short time}} later with their {{original}} manager Paul Ellering at WrestleMania VIII. The team later incorporated a ventriloquist dummy called [...] "Rocco" [...] (Originally introduced as [...] "Freckles" [...] in front of a live crowd at a WWF TV Taping, the segment bombed so badly that it never aired) which served as their “inspiration”, but this gimmick was short-lived. Hegstrand left the company in disgust with the Rocco gimmick immediately after SummerSlam 1992 at the Wembley Stadium where LOD rode to the ring on motorbikes in front of over 80,000 fans. He then went AWOL in London after the event with John Nord (The Berzerker) and missed the flight back to the U.S., while Laurinaitis stuck around and finished the team's contractual obligations with former Demolition member Crush (now repackaged from his Demolition character to being a face, becoming a tanned muscle <b>guy</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> beaches of his native Hawaii) replacing Hawk on house shows in Europe in Mid September 1992, after Hawk left the WWF. Crush and Animal teamed to defeat the Beverly Brothers five times and Kato and Skinner once. Paul Ellering also joined Crush and Animal in some six man tag team matches. When the newly formed team returned to North America, Animal and Crush both started wrestling singles matches and the team was no more. Shortly after Animal then left the WWF, because an injury to his back forced him into a lengthy hiatus.|$|E
2500|$|Although Bill and I {{performed}} {{at a very}} young age, and Bill, I, Barry and John did a lot of frat parties at Brown University and clubs in Newport ... the most memorable performance of what I would view as the precursor of what The Cowsills would be was at Kings Park in Newport (right at the foot of Halidon Hall) at some carnival. The family angle just evolved ... first Bill and me, then Bill me and Barry, then Bill, me, Barry and John, then Bill, me, Barry, John and Mom, then Bill, me, Barry, John, Mom and Paul, then later, me, Paul, John, Barry, Mom and Susan, then back to Bill, me, Barry and John (very briefly in the end) and then to me, Paul, John and Susan. Our first real break came when we were playing the MK Hotel in Newport (in the basement there) and a <b>guy</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> [...] "Today Show" [...] saw us and asked if we wanted to be on the [...] "Today" [...] show. We weren't famous or anything but we were young and we were related and we were quite good. So we went on [...] "The Today Show" [...] (I doubt a tape exists of that but if it did it would be priceless to see) and someone from Mercury Records saw us, which ultimately led to our signing with that label and putting out [...] "Most Of All" [...] (a great [...] "school's out" [...] song that should have been our first hit in my opinion), which led to Artie Kornfeld and Steve Duboff. Mercury dropped us, but Artie and Steve had written [...] "The Rain, The Park and Other Things" [...] and we went in and recorded that song at A studios in New York and took the whole package to MGM, who decided wouldn't it just be terrific if their mother performed with them and, voila, the rest, as they say, is history.|$|E
