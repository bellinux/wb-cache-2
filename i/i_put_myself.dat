I've had lots of friends who've gone through 'Battlefield' situations in their relationships, so when I was singing the song <b>I</b> <b>put</b> <b>myself</b> in their position and {{tried to imagine what}} they were going through. I got so, so into it and I think you can tell.|$|E

500|$|... "Fight for You" [...] is an urban-pop ballad with {{a length}} of four minutes and two seconds. According to Meena Rupani of DesiHits, the song finds Derulo as the male protagonist singing [...] "that he's got a girl in his life he isn't ready {{to let go of}} just yet". The song {{contains}} a sample of the song [...] "Africa" [...] (1982) by American rock band Toto. Lewis Corner of Digital Spy noted that [...] "Fight for You" [...] features [...] "airy synths and bouncy castle-sized beats". During an interview with New! magazine, Derulo explained the concept of [...] "Fight for You", saying: [...] "It's very relationship-based and the line [...] means so much, whatever you believe in you should go for. The song is based on a personal experience, I was in a relationship and <b>I</b> <b>put</b> <b>myself</b> in that place again where you would do anything to keep the relationship together so I went back to that place." ...|$|E

500|$|Aaron Ashmore plays Jimmy Olsen, Chloe's {{photographer}} boyfriend {{who works}} at the Daily Planet. Ashmore, a recurring guest in season six, became a regular cast member in season seven. He called his casting a welcome surprise: [...] "I auditioned for [...] and <b>I</b> <b>put</b> <b>myself</b> on tape. I hadn't heard anything, and a couple of weeks later, all of the sudden (sic), I got the call saying, 'You're going to Vancouver to start shooting Smallville.' It's a dream come true, really." [...] After three seasons on the series (two as a regular), Ashmore's character was killed off. Although Ashmore's Jimmy Olsen was murdered, he said his character was not the [...] "real" [...] Jimmy Olsen, his real name revealed to be Henry James Olsen. Jimmy's younger brother, who appears briefly in the season-eight finale, is intended to be the Jimmy who works with Clark and Lois. Ashmore returns as the younger Jimmy in the series finale.|$|E
500|$|Shortly {{after leaving}} his car, Martin felt the {{championship}} was an achievement {{that he was}} unable to secure: [...] "They tell me {{a lot of people are}} having trouble anyway, but we didn't need to throw that away," [...] He said he was unaware that Yeley intended to make a pit stop and, from his viewpoint, it allowed Kenseth to pass him while Yeley was coming from the centre of the track. Yeley said the pit stop was planned and signalled his intentions to Martin for over a mile. He felt Martin placed him in a position to hit the backstretch wall. Hamlin said the first-lap crash that he was involved in was part of auto racing, and stated it was problematic being involved in difficulties in the Chase for the Nextel Cup: [...] "We checked up and somebody else (Waltrip) didn't. <b>I</b> <b>put</b> <b>myself</b> back there in qualifying. We'll take our lumps and go on." [...] Seventh-place finisher Raines was happy to hold the first position for 28 laps saying it was [...] "extra special" [...] to lead a race at Charlotte. Tom Bowles of Frontstretch opined that had the caution flag not been displayed for the three safety vehicles on lap nine, it could have resulted in [...] "one of the most disastrous accidents in NASCAR history." ...|$|E
500|$|In April 2010, The Hollywood Reporter {{revealed}} that Jon Bernthal and Andrew Lincoln were chosen by producers {{for the main}} cast of the series. Bernthal was to portray Shane Walsh, while Lincoln provided the role of Rick Grimes, the central character of The Walking Dead. While Hurd didn't expect to cast Lincoln, Kirkman was ecstatic with his acting, evaluating him as an [...] "amazing find". In his interview with Dread Central, Kirkman added that [...] "writing Rick Grimes month after month in the comic series, I {{had no idea he}} was an actual living, breathing human being, and yet, here he is. I couldn't be more thrilled with how this show is coming together." [...] Although he was initially shocked upon hearing of The Walking Dead, Lincoln thought the episode's script was well written. [...] "I read it and thought it was well written, and <b>I</b> <b>put</b> <b>myself</b> on tape just for one scene. I didn't know who was involved at this point." [...] The succeeding day, his agent called him about the development of the pilot. Lincoln described the moment as [...] "kind of like a dream list". He later communicated with Darabont via Skype; [...] "We spoke for about 40 minutes about his ideas for the project, about what I liked about Episode One and then he asked would I fly over to come and test." [...] Lincoln flew to Darabont's home, where he viewed [...] "Days Gone Bye" [...] in his garage. He opined that was [...] "brilliant" [...] and [...] "very intimate".|$|E

500|$|Ashmore {{indicates}} that his casting {{was both a}} surprise and what he wanted. The actor states, [...] "I auditioned for [...] and <b>I</b> <b>put</b> <b>myself</b> on tape. I hadn't heard anything, {{and a couple of}} weeks later, all of the sudden, I got the call saying, 'You're going to Vancouver to start shooting Smallville.' It's a dream come true, really." [...] Aaron Ashmore's twin, Shawn, who is better known as Bobby [...] "Iceman" [...] Drake in the X-Men film series, appeared in two episodes of Smallville as the power leeching Eric Summers. After three seasons with the show, two as a series regular, Ashmore was written out of the series. According to Ashmore, when the producers were first trying to get permission to use the character on Smallville, DC Comics had qualms over how close Jimmy was in age to Clark and Lois, as the character was supposed to be at least ten years younger. The producers guaranteed the department they would eventually reveal the Jimmy Olsen who appeared on the show was not the Jimmy Olsen who would one day work alongside Clark and Lois. At the character's funeral, his full name is shown to be [...] "Henry James Olsen", and it is alluded that Jimmy's younger brother, who is given a brief appearance at the funeral, is the DC Comics version of Jimmy Olsen who will one day work at the Daily Planet with Clark and Lois. Although Ashmore was sad to leave the show, he feels that the redemptive story that was given to Jimmy in the finale, through the self-sacrifice he makes for Chloe, makes a good send off for his character.|$|E

2500|$|The band {{continued}} {{this transformation}} with an unexpected cover of Joy Division's [...] "Love Will Tear Us Apart", which was released {{as a single}} in 1988 on Product Inc. in a confusing array of 7" [...] and 12" [...] inch formats. Both Gira and Jarboe sang lead vocals on {{different versions of the}} song. In later years Gira dismissed this release as a mistake, {{and for a long time}} refused to reissue his own vocal version, although Jarboe's version was re-released much sooner. However their version of the song was a hit on US college radio in 1988, which led to the group being offered a major label deal at Uni/MCA. [...] "I'd worked so hard all my life", said Gira. [...] "At 15, I was digging ditches in the desert in Israel, and <b>I</b> <b>put</b> <b>myself</b> through college painting houses. I never saw any money from any of our records.
