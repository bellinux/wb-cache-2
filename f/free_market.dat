50|$|Various {{forms of}} {{socialism}} based on <b>free</b> <b>markets</b> have existed since the 19th century. Early notable socialist proponents of <b>free</b> <b>markets</b> include Pierre-Joseph Proudhon, Benjamin Tucker, and the Ricardian socialists. These economists believed that genuinely <b>free</b> <b>markets</b> and voluntary exchange could not exist within the exploitative conditions of capitalism.|$|R
50|$|Classical {{liberals and}} libertarians support <b>free</b> <b>markets</b> on moral, ideological grounds: {{principles}} of individual liberty morally dictate support for <b>free</b> <b>markets.</b> Supporters {{of the moral}} grounds for <b>free</b> <b>markets</b> include Ayn Rand and Ludwig von Mises. The liberal tradition is suspicious of government authority, and prefers individual choice, and hence tends to see capitalist economics as the preferable means of achieving economic ends.|$|R
50|$|Modern conservatives, on {{the other}} hand, derive support for <b>free</b> <b>markets</b> from {{practical}} grounds. <b>Free</b> <b>markets,</b> they argue, are the most productive markets. Thus the modern conservative supports <b>free</b> <b>markets</b> not out of necessity, but out of expedience. The support is not moral or ideological, but driven on the Burkean notion of prescription: what works best is what is right.|$|R
5|$|During the 1997 Asian crisis several Asian economies ran {{critically}} low {{on foreign}} reserves, leaving them {{forced to accept}} harsh terms from the IMF, and often to accept low prices for the forced sale of their assets. This shattered faith in <b>free</b> <b>market</b> thinking among emerging economies, and from about 2000 they generally began intervening to keep {{the value of their}} currencies low. This enhanced their ability to pursue export led growth strategies {{while at the same time}} building up foreign reserves so they would be better protected against further crises. No currency war resulted because on the whole advanced economies accepted this strategy—in the short term it had some benefits for their citizens, who could buy cheap imports and thus enjoy a higher material standard of living. The current account deficit of the US grew substantially, but until about 2007, the consensus view among <b>free</b> <b>market</b> economists and policy makers like Alan Greenspan, then Chairman of the Federal Reserve, and Paul O'Neill, US Treasury secretary, was that the deficit was not a major reason for worry.|$|E
5|$|For centuries, the Somali community, {{as opposed}} to the state, has been in charge of Islamic {{education}} in all aspects, providing financial and administrative support. The majority of the schools are provided by the <b>free</b> <b>market,</b> sustained by school fees (typically $10 per month); in cases where there are state-supported public schools, private schools are often coveted for their academic excellence, outperforming their public competitors in academic achievement tests.|$|E
5|$|John Ralston Saul {{expressed}} the view in The Unconscious Civilization that in contemporary developed nations {{many people have}} acquiesced in turning over their {{sense of right and}} wrong, their critical conscience, to technical experts; willingly restricting their moral freedom of choice to limited consumer actions ruled by the ideology of the <b>free</b> <b>market,</b> while citizen participation in public affairs is limited to the isolated act of voting and private-interest lobbying turns even elected representatives against the public interest.|$|E
50|$|A {{number of}} {{models of the}} {{capitalist}} peace equate <b>free</b> <b>markets</b> with capitalism. In this usage, <b>free</b> <b>markets</b> and trade cause economic development, which in turn accounts for the peace among nations with advanced economies.|$|R
50|$|Although <b>free</b> <b>markets</b> are {{commonly}} associated with capitalism within a market economy in contemporary usage and popular culture, <b>free</b> <b>markets</b> have also been advocated by free-market anarchists, market socialists, and some proponents of cooperatives and advocates of profit sharing.|$|R

5|$|The {{economic}} development in India followed socialist-inspired politicians {{for most of its}} independent history, including state-ownership of many sectors; India's per capita income increased at only around 1% annualised rate in the three decades after its independence. Since the mid-1980s, India has slowly opened up its markets through economic liberalisation. After more fundamental reforms since 1991 and their renewal in the 2000s, India has progressed towards a <b>free</b> <b>market</b> economy.|$|E
5|$|The naturalism {{of natural}} {{selection}} conflicted with presumptions of purpose in nature and while this could be reconciled by theistic evolution, other mechanisms implying more progress or purpose were more acceptable. Herbert Spencer had already incorporated Lamarckism into his popular philosophy of progressive <b>free</b> <b>market</b> human society. He popularised the terms evolution and survival of the fittest, and many thought Spencer was central to evolutionary thinking.|$|E
5|$|After the election, Paul was speculated {{to run for}} {{president}} in 1992 but opted instead to work on the campaign for Pat Buchanan. That year, Marrou received the Libertarian presidential nomination. Paul later returned to the Republican Party and was re-elected to his seat in Congress in 1996, without much support from establishment Republicans, who supported the party-switching Democratic incumbent of the seat. Back in Congress, Paul regained his nickname of Dr. No, favoring a <b>free</b> <b>market</b> and advocating a reduction {{in the size of the}} federal government. He was drafted to challenge President George W. Bush in the 2004 Republican primaries, but chose not to run. He ran {{for president}} again in 2008 and 2012 as a Republican, attracting a large amount of grassroots support.|$|E

5|$|Friedman was an {{advisor to}} Republican U.S. President Ronald Reagan and Conservative British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher. His {{political}} philosophy extolled {{the virtues of}} a <b>free</b> <b>market</b> economic system with minimal intervention. He once stated that his role in eliminating U.S. conscription was his proudest accomplishment. In his 1962 book Capitalism and Freedom, Friedman advocated policies such as a volunteer military, freely floating exchange rates, abolition of medical licenses, a negative income tax, and school vouchers. His support for school choice led him to found the Friedman Foundation for Educational Choice, later renamed EdChoice.|$|E

However, although {{he could not get}} federal funding for empowerment zones passed during his tenure, by 1992 38 states had created empowerment zones, and in 1994 $3.5billion was approved for them under President Clinton. A <b>free</b> <b>market</b> Kemp initiative to allow homeowners to subdivide their houses for the purpose of creating rental units without inordinate bureaucracy did not get executed under the Clinton administration, however. In 1992, with H. Ross Perot mounting a formidable campaign, Kemp was again considered a Vice Presidential candidate.|$|E

5|$|This period saw a {{political}} alignment with the Eastern Bloc countries and a shift toward economic insularity. These policies, coupled with economic pressures {{stemming from the}} 1973 oil crisis, resulted in the rapid collapse of Madagascar's economy and {{a sharp decline in}} living standards, and the country had become completely bankrupt by 1979. The Ratsiraka administration accepted the conditions of transparency, anti-corruption measures and <b>free</b> <b>market</b> policies imposed by the International Monetary Fund, World Bank and various bilateral donors in exchange for their bailout of the nation's broken economy.|$|E
5|$|To {{meet the}} <b>free</b> <b>market</b> situation, the company's {{management}} introduced measures {{to keep costs}} low. On 19 August 1993, ten of eleven trade unions agreed to a three-year wage contract, which contained bonuses for all employees based on the company's profit. The cabin crew's union had a two-day strike, before reaching an agreement. At the same time, the company needed NOK400 million in share capital. Braathens Rederi sold the sister company Braathens Helikopter to Helkopter Service for NOK225 million on 30 September 1993, and the money was used to buy Braathens SAFE stock. The company raised further capital in an initial public offering, and the company was listed on the Oslo Stock Exchange on 10 January 1994. After the listing, Braathens Rederi retained 69% of the company.|$|E
5|$|Anarky is {{a fictional}} character, {{appearing}} in comic books published by DC Comics. Co-created by Alan Grant and Norm Breyfogle, he {{first appeared in}} Detective Comics No. 608 (November 1989), as an adversary of Batman. Introduced as Lonnie Machin, a child prodigy with knowledge of radical philosophy and driven to overthrow governments to improve social conditions, stories revolving around Anarky often focus on political and philosophical themes. The character, who is named after the philosophy of anarchism, primarily espouses anti-statism; however, multiple social issues have been addressed through the character, including environmentalism, antimilitarism, economic inequality, and political corruption. Inspired by multiple sources, early stories featuring the character often included homages to political and philosophical books, and referenced anarchist philosophers and theorists. The inspiration {{for the creation of}} the character and its early development was based in Grant's personal interest in anti-authoritarian philosophy and politics. However, when Grant himself transitioned to the philosophy of Neo-Tech, developed by Frank R. Wallace, he shifted the focus of Anarky from a vehicle for socialist and populist philosophy, to rationalist, atheist, and <b>free</b> <b>market</b> thinking.|$|E

40|$|This paper elaborates on the {{economic}} operating system (EOS) the role it can play in growth. It focuses on markets, price determination and forces of demand and supply in order to illustrate how an EOS model offers greater economic growth, stability and safety. It delves into market theory to determine whether what is commonly understood about <b>market</b> forces and <b>free</b> <b>markets</b> in contemporary economics is as reliable as might be expected; do <b>free</b> <b>markets</b> encourage or retard economic growth? It is often, for amusement, brought up how modern medicine despite its advances cannot cure the common cold. Contemporary economics has a similar pet peeve; it {{does not know how}} to cure common inflation and deflation. The same way medicine leaves the body’s immune system to deal with colds until a cure is found contemporary economics leaves inflation and deflation to market forces to sort out with the occasional booster shot of intervention when this process seems to fail. To this day the stand off between Keynesian and Monetarist models demonstrates the irascible nature of this economic bug; it seems in contemporary economics {{there is only one way}} to control it and that’s do nothing about it. This nothing in contemporary economics is what is referred to as <b>free</b> <b>markets.</b> Allowing <b>free</b> <b>markets</b> to set prices and act as a mechanism for managing inflation works, what doesn’t work is that <b>free</b> <b>markets</b> systems based on a Monetarist model lack reliable growth and not being able to do anything comprehensive when market forces begin to act up. In a downturn, suddenly the liberty of <b>free</b> <b>markets</b> can become a threat to economic stability. <b>Free</b> <b>markets</b> may work best in an economic operating system (EOS) model better able to exploit the efficiency of markets. whilst accelerating economic growth. ...|$|R

5|$|Farmer {{was also}} criticized for his {{management}} of the agriculture department's vehicle fleet. Late in his first term, Farmer had removed the vehicles used by the Agriculture Department from the state fleet, opting to have department officials manage them separately. In 2010, the Bluegrass Institute for Public Policy Solutions, a <b>free</b> <b>market</b> think tank, criticized the department's {{management of the}} vehicles under its control, citing {{the frequency with which}} the department's vehicles were being replaced. The Lexington Herald-Leader noted in 2010 that the department's fleet had grown from 178 to 206 vehicles since 2007 while the state's fleet had shrunk by 5%, and that all but three of the department's vehicles were fewer than four years old. A department spokesman defended the moves, citing decreased maintenance costs and higher resale values of vehicles being replaced. The Lexington Herald-Leader noted that such incidents could undermine Williams and Farmer's traditional Republican message of the need for less government spending.|$|E
5|$|Market Forces is a science-fiction thriller set nearly {{fifty years}} after its writing {{featuring}} a protagonist who fights lethal battles to win contracts for his company and to retain his position within the company. While the story is fictional, the author included a bibliography section that informed the story's satire of globalisation and modern corporate practices. Morgan extrapolates trends in <b>free</b> <b>market</b> capitalism out fifty years {{to a point where}} corporations are unfettered by domestic governments. It is a dystopian vision where large corporations constantly battle to rule entire countries using humans as pawns. The protagonist, Chris Faulkner, {{can be viewed as a}} personification of the story's take on the development of its economic system; the character is written to be likeable but becomes increasing brutal as he invests himself deeper into the corporate culture.|$|E
5|$|Of equal profile was Rutherford's government's {{management}} of the province's railways. Alberta's early years were optimistic ones, which manifested itself in a pronounced enthusiasm {{for the construction of}} new railway lines. Every town wanted to be a railway centre, and the government had great confidence in the ability of the <b>free</b> <b>market</b> to provide low freight rates to the province's farmers provided sufficient charters were issued to competing companies. The legislature passed government-sponsored legislation setting out a framework for new railways in 1907, but interest from private firms in actually building the lines was limited. In the face of public demand and support by legislators of all parties for as rapid as possible an expansion of the province's lines, the government offered loan guarantees to several companies in exchange for commitments to build lines. Rutherford justified this in part by his conviction that railways needed to expand along with population, rather than having railway expansion follow population growth as would be the case without government intervention. The Conservatives argued that this strategy didn't go far enough, and called for direct government ownership.|$|E
