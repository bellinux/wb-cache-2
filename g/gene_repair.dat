50|$|The use of {{synthetic}} oligonucleotides in gene therapy is to deactivate the genes {{involved in the}} disease process. There are several methods by which this is achieved. One strategy uses antisense specific to the target gene to disrupt the transcription of the faulty gene. Another uses small molecules of RNA called siRNA to signal the cell to cleave specific unique sequences in the mRNA transcript of the faulty gene, disrupting translation of the faulty mRNA, and therefore expression of the gene. A further strategy uses double stranded oligodeoxynucleotides as a decoy for the transcription factors that are required to activate the transcription of the target gene. The transcription factors bind to the decoys instead of the promoter of the faulty gene, which reduces the transcription of the target gene, lowering expression. Additionally, single stranded DNA oligonucleotides {{have been used to}} direct a single base change within a mutant gene. The oligonucleotide is designed to anneal with complementarity to the target gene {{with the exception of a}} central base, the target base, which serves as the template base for repair. This technique is referred to as oligonucleotide mediated <b>gene</b> <b>repair,</b> targeted <b>gene</b> <b>repair,</b> or targeted nucleotide alteration.|$|E

40|$|Abstract Background The {{repair of}} single base {{mutations}} in mammalian genes can be directed by single-stranded oligonucleotides {{in a process}} known as targeted <b>gene</b> <b>repair.</b> The mechanism of this reaction is currently being elucidated but likely involves a pairing step in which the oligonucleotide align in homologous register with its target sequence and a correction step in which the mutant base is replaced by endogenous repair pathways. This process is regulated by the activity of various factors and proteins that either elevate or depress the frequency at which <b>gene</b> <b>repair</b> takes place. Results In this report, we find that addition of selenomethionine reduces <b>gene</b> <b>repair</b> frequency in a dose-dependent fashion. A correlation between <b>gene</b> <b>repair</b> and altered cell cycle progression is observed. We also find that selenium induces expression of Ref- 1 which, in turn, modifies the activity of p 53 during the cell cycle. Conclusion We can conclude from the results that the suppression of <b>gene</b> <b>repair</b> by introduction of selenomethionine occurs through a p 53 -associated pathway. This result indicates that the successful application of <b>gene</b> <b>repair</b> for treatment of inherited disorders may be hampered by indirect activation of endogenous suppressor functions. </p...|$|E
40|$|Single-stranded DNA {{oligonucleotide}} (SSO) -mediated <b>gene</b> <b>repair</b> {{has great}} potentials for gene therapy and functional genomic studies. However, its underlying mechanism remains unclear. Previous studies from other groups {{have suggested that}} DNA damage response via the ATM/ATR pathway {{may be involved in}} this process. In this study, we measured the effect of two ATM/ATR inhibitors caffeine and pentoxifylline on the correction efficiency in SSO-mediated <b>gene</b> <b>repair.</b> We also checked their effect on double-stranded break (DSB) -induced homologous recombination repair (HRR) as a control, which is well known to be dependent on the ATM/ATR pathway. We found these inhibitors could completely inhibit DSB-induced HRR, but could only partially inhibit SSO-mediated process, indicating SSO-mediated <b>gene</b> <b>repair</b> is not dependent on the ATM/ATR pathway. Furthermore, we found that thymidine treatment promotes SSO-mediated <b>gene</b> <b>repair,</b> but inhibits DSB-induced HRR.

40|$|Adeno-associated virus (AAV) vectors {{are ideal}} for {{performing}} <b>gene</b> <b>repair</b> due {{to their ability to}} target multiple different genomic loci, low immunogenicity, capability to achieve targeted and stable expression through integration, and low mutagenic and oncogenic potential. However, many handicaps to <b>gene</b> <b>repair</b> therapy remain. Most notable is the low frequency of correction in vivo. To date, this frequency is too low to be of therapeutic value for any disease. To address this, a point-mutation–based mouse model of the metabolic disease hereditary tyrosinemia type I was used to test whether targeted AAV integration by homologous recombination could achieve high-level stable <b>gene</b> <b>repair</b> in vivo. Both neonatal and adult mice were treated with AAV serotypes 2 and 8 carrying a wild-type genomic sequence for repairing the mutated Fah (fumarylacetoacetate hydrolase) gene. Hepatic <b>gene</b> <b>repair</b> was quantified by immunohistochemistry and supported with reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction and serology for functional correction parameters. Successful <b>gene</b> <b>repair</b> was observed with both serotypes but was more efficient with AAV 8. Correction frequencies of up to 10 � 3 were achieved and highly reproducible within typical dose ranges. In this model, repaired hepatocytes have a selective growth advantage and are thus able to proliferate to efficiently repopulate mutant livers and cure the underlying metabolic disease. Conclusion: AAV-mediated <b>gene</b> <b>repair</b> is feasible in vivo and can functionally correct an appropriate selection-based metabolic liver disease in both adults and neonates. (HEPATOLOGY 2010; 51 : 1200 - 1208.) Gene therapy is a promising means to cure many monogenic diseases.

40|$|We {{describe}} a simple, efficient and inexpensive means of stimulating targeted <b>gene</b> <b>repair</b> in mammalian cell lines. Methyl methanesulfonate (MMS) is an alkylation agent capable of inducing DNA lesions and subsequent single strand breaks (ss breaks) and double strand breaks (ds breaks). This damage activates the non-homologous end joining (NHEJ) and homologous recombination (HR) DNA repair pathways, a response that {{can enhance the}} frequency of synthetic oligonucleotide-directed <b>gene</b> <b>repair.</b> We show in mammalian cells that the conversion frequency of a mutant base pair to wild-type in an integrated enhanced green fluorescent protein gene is increased by pretreatment with MMS. This stimulation is dose-dependent and correlates {{to the level of}} ds breaks induced by MMS treatment. These ds breaks result in Rad 51 p nuclear-relocalization and foci formation, a specific indication that HR pathway has been activated. In presence of MMS the cell cycle is slowed with an accumulation in S phase where coincidently, the highest level of <b>gene</b> <b>repair</b> takes place.

40|$|Camptothecin (CPT) is an anticancer {{drug that}} {{promotes}} DNA breakage at replication forks {{and the formation}} of lesions that activate the processes of homologous recombination (HR) and nonhomologous end joining. We have taken advantage of the CPT-induced damage response by coupling it to <b>gene</b> <b>repair</b> directed by synthetic oligonucleotides, a process in which a mutant base pair is converted into a wild-type one. Here, we show that pretreating DLD- 1 cells with CPT leads to a significant stimulation in the frequency of correction of an integrated mutant enhanced green fluorescent protein gene. The stimulation is dose-dependent and coincident with the formation of double-strand DNA breaks. Caffeine, but not vanillin, blocks the enhancement of <b>gene</b> <b>repair</b> suggesting that, in this system, HR is the pathway most responsible for elevating the frequency of correction. The involvement of HR is further proven by studies in which wortmannin was seen to inhibit <b>gene</b> <b>repair</b> at high concentrations but not at lower levels that are known to inhibit DNA-PK activity.

40|$|Conditional <b>gene</b> <b>repair</b> {{mutations}} in the mouse {{can assist in}} cell lineage analyses and provide a valuable complement to conditional gene inactivation strategies. We present a method for the generation of conditional <b>gene</b> <b>repair</b> mutations that employs a loxP-flanked (floxed) selectable marker and transcriptional/translational stop cassette (neostop) located within the first intron of a target gene.

Certain parameters, such as the length of the vector and the genetic background of the organism, {{have a significant impact on}} the process of targeted <b>gene</b> <b>repair,</b> and point mutations are corrected at a higher frequency than frameshift mutations. Genetic analyses reveal that expression levels of the recombination/repair genes RAD 51, RAD 52 and RAD 54 can affect the frequency of <b>gene</b> <b>repair.</b> Overexpression of RAD 51 enhances the frequency 4 -fold for correction of an episomal target and 5 -fold for correction of a chromosomal target; overexpression of RAD 54 is also effective in stimulating <b>gene</b> <b>repair,</b> to the same extent as RAD 51 in the chromosomal target.

As a result, nonviral methods for gene transfer in hepatocytes {{have also been}} explored. <b>Gene</b> <b>repair</b> by small synthetic single-stranded oligodeoxynucleotides (ODNs) produces targeted alterations in the genome of mammalian cells and represents a great potential for nonviral gene therapy. To test the feasibility of ODN-mediated <b>gene</b> <b>repair</b> within chromosomal DNA in human hepatocytes, two new cell lines with stably integrated mutant reporter genes, namely neomycin and enhanced green fluorescent protein were established. Targeting theses cells with ODNs specifically designed for repair resulted in site-directed and permanent gene conversion of the single-point mutation of the reporter genes. Moreover, the frequency of gene alteration was highly dependent on the mitotic activity of the cells, indicating that the proliferative status {{is an important factor}} for successful targeting in human hepatocytes. cDNA array expression profiling of DNA repair genes under different cell culture conditions combined with RNA interference assay showed that mismatch repair (MMR) in actively growing hepatocytes imposes a strong barrier to efficient <b>gene</b> <b>repair</b> mediated by ODNs.

40|$|The role of {{transcription}} in oligonucleotide (ODN) -directed {{gene modification}} {{has been investigated}} in mammalian cells. The importance of transcription is demonstrated using mammalian cell lines {{with varying degrees of}} transcription of the mutant LacZ reporter gene, residing in both episome and chromosome. Gene correction occurs more efficiently when the target gene is actively transcribed and antisense ODN is more active than sense ODN. Using an approach that combines biochemical studies with a cell-based assay to measure the functional activity of intermediates it is shown that a joint molecule, consisting of supercoiled DNA and homologous ODN targeted to correct the mutated base, is a functional intermediate in the <b>gene</b> <b>repair</b> process. Furthermore, this approach showed that a resected joint molecule is a downstream intermediate of the D-loop. These results indicate that the primary reason for efficient <b>gene</b> <b>repair</b> exhibited by the antisense ODN is its increased accessibility to the non-transcribed strand, and as a consequence an increased formation of intermediate during active transcription. Moreover, the processing of intermediates was also affected by transcription, suggesting that ODN-directed <b>gene</b> <b>repair</b> may be linked to transcription-coupled repair.

40|$|Gene {{addition}} {{strategies to}} correct inherited diseases are showing promise for {{treatment in the}} clinic, but an improved approach to treat both dominant and recessive genetic disorders would be to repair the mutant gene by homologous recombination-mediated gene targeting. Recently, gene targeting frequencies have dramatically increased {{through the development of}} (i) improved designer nuc 1 eases, including zinc finger nucleases (ZFN), able to introduce specific double-strand breaks at their target locus; and (ii) efficient DNA delivery tools, including integration-deficient lentiviral vectors (IDL Vs). Even when using these state-of-the-art systems, <b>gene</b> <b>repair</b> frequencies in stem cells are moderate. To obtain proof-of-principle of phenotypic rescue in the haematopoietic system, a model in which corrected cells had selective advantage would be optimum. An ex vivo strategy to correct the classical scid mouse, a model of human DNA-dependent protein kinase catalytic subunit (DNA-PKcs, PRKDC) deficiency, is hereby presented. Donor templates to correct the scid point mutation and a ZFN were produced, optimised and incorporated into IDLVs. Specific ZFN activity in mouse scid fibroblasts and haematopoietic progenitors was demonstrated by Cel-I assay (which detects modifications introduced at the target site upon repair by non-homologous end- joining) and by deep sequencing. ZFN- and template-mediated <b>gene</b> <b>repair</b> of the scid mutation was demonstrated via the incorporation of a selection cassette and/or a diagnostic restriction site from the donor template into the targeted locus.
