Just {{for it to be}} out there to show that it happens. This is a real issue that needs to be addressed. To be a part of that, and to spread awareness feels so nice because I’ve personally experience bullying and I know many friends who have. Whether people’s reason behind it are good or bad, nonetheless, it affects kids to such an extent especially young, vulnerable kids." [...] Of the character's [...] "dark side", Ehrich stated: [...] "I love playing dark, but justifiably dark. It's never coming from a psychopathic place. First, he got obsessed with Summer, and that caused the bullying storyline, and now he's dealing with his parents' problems and possible divorce. Fenmore's issues come from a place that makes sense. It's interesting, because everyone around him is pretty much lying, and Fen {{is supposed to be the}} crazy one. Yet he's actually the truthful one." [...] He also stated that [...] "as an actor, it's fun to go out of control", saying: [...] "As an actor, it’s fun when you’re out of control, and you don’t even know you’re acting. Like, literally, you just escape. And I got to feel that. And I’ve had numerous times on this show where I’ve <b>gotten</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> out of control, and it’s a really nice feeling. It’s exhilarating." [...] He also revealed that he had been listening to the music of John Mayer and Bruno Mars to get into Fenmore's head space. Ehrich also conceded that he didn't want Fenmore to go [...] "too far", saying: [...] "He's a really troubled kid who is just trying to find his way in life. He's not evil. I don't think he's asking for too much except for some love and trust. He's on a journey—a long, long journey to find some peace." ...|$|E

(Coincidentally, in an interview with Diane Sawyer on ABC's World News with Diane Sawyer, Zuckerberg revealed that Eisenberg's cousin, Eric Fisher, was a Facebook product designer.) Several days later, Justin Timberlake and Andrew Garfield were confirmed to portray the roles of Sean Parker and Eduardo Saverin, respectively. In October 2009, Brenda Song, Rooney Mara, Armie Hammer, Shelby Young, and Josh Pence were cast. Max Minghella and Dakota Johnson were also confirmed to star in the film. In a 2009 interview with The Baltimore Sun, Eisenberg said, [...] "Even though I've <b>gotten</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> in some wonderful movies, this character seems so much more overtly insensitive in so many ways that seem more real to me in the best way. I don't often get cast as insensitive people, so it feels very comfortable: fresh and exciting, as if you {{never have to worry about}} the audience. Not that I worry about the audience anyway – it should be just the furthest thing from your mind. The Social Network is the biggest relief I've ever had in a movie".|$|E

60|$|While the {{commodore}} {{was holding}} Mrs. Abbott at bay, in this manner, Captain Truck, {{who had given}} him a wink to that effect, was employed in playing off a practical joke {{at the expense of the}} widow. It was one of the standing amusements of these worthies, who had <b>gotten</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> sworn friends and constant associates, after they had caught as many fish as they wished, to retire to the favourite spring, light, the one his cigar, the other his pipe, mix their grog, and then relieve their ennui, when tired of discussing men and things, by playing cards on a particular stump. Now, it happens that the captain had the identical pack which had been used on all such occasions in his pocket, as was evident in the fact that the cards were nearly as distinctly marked on their backs, as on their faces. These cards he showed secretly to his companion, and when the attention of Mrs. Abbott was altogether engaged in expecting the terrible announcement of her daughter's errors, the captain slipped them, kings, queens and knaves, high, low, jack and the game, without regard to rank, into the lady's work-basket. As soon as this feat was successfully performed, a sign was given to the commodore that the conspiracy was effected, and that disputant in theology gradually began to give ground, while he continued to maintain that jumping the rope was a sin, though it might be one of a nominal class. There is little doubt, had he possessed a smattering of phrases, a greater command of biblical learning, and more zeal, that the fisherman might have established a new shade of the Christian faith; for, while mankind still persevere in disregarding the plainest mandates of God, as respects humility, the charities, and obedience, nothing seems to afford them more delight than to add to the catalogue of the offences against his divine supremacy. It was perhaps lucky for the commodore, who was capital at casting a pickerel line, but who usually settled his polemics with the fist, when hard pushed, that Captain Truck found leisure to come to the rescue.|$|E

Stills also had a short-term relationship with Rita Coolidge, as had Graham Nash. This apparently led to the initial break-up of CSN in 1970. During a Manassas tour in France, Stills met and married his first wife, singer-songwriter Véronique Sanson. They divorced in 1976.

50|$|In the 1960s Interstate 57 {{was built}} and {{it passes through}} the east half of Peotone Township. An exit and {{entrance}} ramp off the interstate serves as a main entrance {{to the town of}} Peotone. While I-57 borders Peotone's west village limits, Route 50 passes through the east side of town. Many of Peotone's businesses are located on along Route 50. Running parallel to Route 50 for much of its path through Peotone Township is the Canadian National Railway. The village of Peotone sprung up alongside this railroad in 1856. The railroad is what brought early settlers to the township. Another main route that passes through Peotone Township is Route 45. Running 1 mi east of the townships west boundary is the two-lane highway. The Peotone Township stretch of Route 45 was completely resurfaced during the summer of 2008, following a winter full of angry motorists complaining about the serious pothole condition of the highway, which had <b>gotten</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> a public safety hazzard.|$|E

40|$|Metaphor {{has been}} {{generally}} contemplated and broke down inside the schema of verbal and written discourse, scholarly works and artistic studies. It {{has been identified}} with metaphorical language and has been viewed as quite recently a sort of aesthetic frivolity (Murray & Moon, 2006). In addition, conventional instructing of metaphors presents language as an abnormal or different method for using it (Goatly, 1997). Likewise, as Goatly has put it, scholars have needed figures of speech strictly limited to writing, talk and craftsmanship. Moreover, metaphor is viewed as something that fits in with abstract structures which {{is more concerned with}} novel or intriguing uses of words. Lakoff & Johnson (1980) presented an alternate idea and perspective of metaphor which is known as reasonable metaphorical dissection. The theory underlying this new approach is that the reasonable metaphors enter our understanding of our general surroundings and they shape our demeanor. Appropriately, as pointed out by Lakoff & Johnson (1980), metaphor is available in ordinary discourse, in every language, and is to a certain degree, has <b>gotten</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> culturally specific. Besides both contend that metaphors affect our way of viewing the meanings and are discovered widely in a significant number of our languages, contemplations and activities...|$|E
