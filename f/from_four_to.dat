5|$|The {{sections}} originally {{designated as}} the Willow Run Expressway were rebuilt from Rawsonville Road in Belleville to Ozga Road in Romulus starting in 1972. As part of this reconstruction, the segment between Haggerty Road and Ozga Road was widened <b>from</b> <b>four</b> <b>to</b> six lanes, and the eastbound lanes were realigned to facilitate construction of an interchange with I-275, a western bypass of Detroit which was under construction at the time. The Willow Run segment was also resurfaced at this point, as the old road bed did not contain steel mesh. Construction of this interchange also obliterated a partial interchange with Huron River Drive.|$|E

5|$|Although the Paris Peace Accords of 1973 were {{supposed}} {{to end the war}} in Vietnam, fighting continued between South Vietnam and North Vietnam and the Viet Cong. Despite a pledge of support from U.S. President Richard Nixon, military aid to South Vietnam was sharply reduced. By the end of 1972 the Republic of Vietnam Air Force was the fourth largest air force in the world, with 2,075 aircraft and over 61,000 personnel. However, Republic of Vietnam Air Force operations were severely affected by cutbacks in military aid, flying hours had to be reduced by 51% and bomb loads on fighter aircraft halved <b>from</b> <b>four</b> <b>to</b> two pieces of ordnance.|$|E
5|$|Breslau {{was built}} in 1901 by the Bremer Vulkan yard at Vegesack for the North German Lloyd line as the fourth of seven ships of the Köln class. The Köln-class ships, all named after German cities, were {{designed}} for the Bremen to Baltimore and Galveston route, and were specially fitted for steerage traffic. Though the class was designed with accommodations for 120 cabin-class passengers and up to 1,850 steerage passengers for service from Germany, Breslaus capacity was somewhat lower, with room for 66 cabin-class and 1,660 in steerage. The Köln-class steerage compartments had portholes for better light and ventilation than was typical, and included cabins that housed <b>from</b> <b>four</b> <b>to</b> ten passengers. Köln-class ships were specially designed to carry large freight loads on return voyages to Germany, with holds customized for carrying wheat and cotton.|$|E

5|$|During November1993, {{assembly}} of the first prototype commenced at two separate locations, these being Sikorsky's facility in Stratford, Connecticut and Boeing's manufacturing plant in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania; later on, all of the rotorcraft's sub-assemblies were transferred to the former location where final assembly occurred. In the following year, the number of prototypes to be produced was reduced <b>from</b> <b>four</b> <b>to</b> two rotorcraft. On 25May1995, the first Comanche prototype was formally rolled out at Sikorsky's production facility, after which it was transferred to West Palm Beach, Florida to commence flight testing activities. On 4January1996, the prototype, flown by test pilots Bob Gradle and Rus Stiles, performed its 39-minute maiden flight. The first flight had been originally planned to take place during August 1995, but had been delayed {{by a number of}} structural and software problems that had been encountered. On 30 March 1999, the second prototype conducted its first flight, before joining the flight test program shortly thereafter.|$|E
5|$|Following this, {{they were}} {{withdrawn}} from the front line. By this time casualties amongst the Australian Corps had reached critical level {{and as a result}} many battalions—from an authorised strength of over 1,000 men—were only able to field between 300 and 400. As a result, {{the decision was made to}} reduce the number of infantry battalions in each brigade <b>from</b> <b>four</b> <b>to</b> three by disbanding one battalion and using its personnel to reinforce the others. The 29th Battalion was one of those chosen to be broken up and as a result on 19 October 1918, the 29th Battalion was disbanded. The majority of the battalion's personnel—29 officers and 517 other ranks—were transferred to the 32nd Battalion as reinforcements.|$|E
5|$|In September 1939, Fegelein {{commanded}} the SS Totenkopf Reiterstandarte (Death's-Head Horse Regiment), which arrived in Poland {{shortly after the}} end of the Polish Campaign. The unit was placed under the command of the Ordnungspolizei (Orpo; order police) and was split into small groups assigned to support police activities at posts throughout the Poznan district. On 15 November, Himmler ordered the expansion of the regiment <b>from</b> <b>four</b> <b>to</b> thirteen squadrons and renamed it as 1. SS-Totenkopf-Reiterstandarte (1st Death's Head Cavalry Regiment). Additional men were recruited from ethnic Germans living in the General Government and further afield. Many of the officers, including Fegelein, had never attended officer training school, so much of the training provided to new recruits was rudimentary. However, it was rigorous, and the men developed a strong camaraderie. Fegelein's unit was involved alongside the Orpo in the extermination, ordered by Hitler, of members of the Polish elite such as intellectuals, aristocrats, and clergy, in an action called Intelligenzaktion. On 7 December 1939 Fegelein's unit was involved in the mass shooting of 1,700 such people in the Kampinos Forest.|$|E
