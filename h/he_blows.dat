500|$|The single's {{video was}} {{directed}} by Jake Nava, and contains numerous wardrobe changes by Carey in a storyline involving luxurious scenery in which the singer leaves her significant other. It is presented in one continuous shot, with no edits. The video begins with a TV screen and the word 'Mimi' appearing, while on the monitor, Dupri raps his introduction. As the television fades, Carey is then shown lying in a bathtub overflowing with water and rose petals, with her hair flowing {{over the side of}} the tub. Next, the camera follows down one floor of the mansion to find Carey, decked out in bright blue makeup and high heels, as she sings [...] "By the time you get this message / It's gonna be too late / So don't bother paging me / 'Cause I'll be on my way," [...] into the phone.

500|$|Seungsahn also {{developed}} his own kōan study program {{for students of}} the Kwan Um School, known today as the [...] "Twelve Gates". These twelve kōans are a mixture of ancient cases and cases which he developed. Before receiving inka to teach (in Kwan Um, inka is not synonymous with Dharma transmission), students must complete the Twelve Gates, though often they will complete hundreds more. One of the more well known cases of the Twelve Gates is [...] "Dropping Ashes on the Buddha", the Sixth Gate, {{which is also the}} title of one of his books. In the book The Compass of Zen, this kong-an is transcribed as follows: [...] "Somebody comes to the Zen center smoking a cigarette. <b>He</b> <b>blows</b> smoke and drops ashes on the Buddha." [...] Seungsahn then poses the question, [...] "If you are standing there at that time, what can you do?" [...] Not included in this version of the kōan is the Kwan Um School of Zen's following side note on the case, [...] "ere {{is an important factor in}} this case that has apparently never been explicitly included in its print versions. Zen Master Seung Sahn has always told his students that the man with the cigarette is also very strong and that he will hit you if he doesn't approve of your response to his actions." ...|$|E

Achenar's journal reveals that he and Sirrus planned to trap their mother Catherine on Riven and use a [...] "Memory Chamber", a gigantic flower-like structure used to preserve {{the memories of the}} dead, to take control of Atrus' body and steal his knowledge of the Art of Writing. The Life Stone that Achenar stole is used to power the Memory Chambers, leaving the current one in danger of collapse. Shortly afterwards, the Stranger finds Sirrus in an underwater harvester used for collecting memory globes for storing those memories; <b>he</b> <b>blows</b> up the harvester and flees to an older Memory Chamber, decrepit and abandoned. After encountering the Stranger there, Sirrus tells the Stranger that Achenar is the guilty one, and asks the Stranger to find Atrus and bring him to Serenia to set things right.|$|E

Escaping the ship in a lifeboat after sending a radio message to the police about the cargo, a seaplane tries to attack them.

Amy rescues him, but Shadow, Eggman, and the duplicitous Rouge escape to the space colony ARK, where Eggman threatens to use a weapon called the Eclipse Cannon to destroy Earth if Earth does not submit to his rule; <b>he</b> <b>blows</b> up half of the Moon to prove his power. Eggman collects the Emeralds to power the Cannon, but this triggers a program Gerald set up decades ago, which will cause space colony ARK to hurtle into Earth, destroying the planets in less than half an hour.

[...] A filmed bit had him driving around New York looking morose until inspiration strikes, and <b>he</b> <b>blows</b> up the ABC building.
