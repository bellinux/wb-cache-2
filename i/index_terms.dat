The quality of both kinds of indexing terms depends, of course, on the qualifications of provider.

40|$|Most {{information}} retrieval systems use stopword lists and stemming algorithms. However, {{we have found}} that recognizing singular and plural nouns, verb forms, negation, and prepositions can produce dramatically different text classification results. We present results from text classification experiments that compare relevancy signatures, which use local linguistic context, with corresponding <b>indexing</b> <b>terms</b> that do not. In two different domains, relevancy signatures produced better results than the simple <b>indexing</b> <b>terms.</b> These experiments suggest that stopword lists and stemming algorithms may remove or conflate many words {{that could be used to}} create more effective <b>indexing</b> <b>terms.</b> Introduction Most {{information retrieval}} systems use a stopword list to prevent common words from being used as <b>indexing</b> <b>terms.</b> Highly frequent words, such as determiners and prepositions, are not considered to be content words because they appear in virtually every document.

This bag-based representation causes a problem for specialists when they deal with a specific domain like medical one. We present {{an alternative to the}} bag of <b>indexing</b> <b>terms</b> representation depending on semantic query structuring, in order to fulfill this need of precision in a specific domain. This structure of a query is obtained by grouping <b>indexing</b> <b>terms</b> using pre-defined categories called dimensions. These dimensions represent the different aspects that could appear in a query or a document. By using this notion, the relevant document to a given query should not only has a maximum number of shared <b>indexing</b> <b>terms</b> but also have a similar structure.

For this purpose, it relies on matching representations of documents, as provided by authors and indexers to user queries. In this paper, we describe the growth of author keywords in biomedical journal articles and present a comparative study of author keywords and MeSH® <b>indexing</b> <b>terms</b> assigned by MEDLINE indexers to PubMed Central Open Access articles. A similarity metric is used to assess automatically the relatedness between pairs of author keywords and <b>indexing</b> <b>terms.</b> A set of 300 pairs is manually reviewed to evaluate the metric and characterize the relationships between author keywords and <b>indexing</b> <b>terms.</b> Results show that author keywords are increasingly available in biomedical articles and that over 60 % of author keywords {{can be linked to}} a closely related <b>indexing</b> <b>term.</b> Finally, we discuss the potential impact of this work on indexing and terminology development...|$|R

40|$|Automatic image {{annotation}} is {{an attractive}} approach for enabling convenient access to images found {{in a variety of}} documents. Since image captions and relevant discussions found in the text can be useful for summarizing the content of images, {{it is also possible that}} this text can be used to generate salient <b>indexing</b> <b>terms.</b> Unfortunately, this problem is generally domainspecific because <b>indexing</b> <b>terms</b> that are useful in one domain can be ineffective in others. Thus, we present a supervised machine learning approach to image annotation utilizing non-lexical features 1 extracted from image-related text to select useful terms. We apply this approach to several subdomains of the biomedical sciences and show that we are able to reduce the number of ineffective <b>indexing</b> <b>terms.</b> ...|$|R

50|$|An index term, subject term, subject heading, or descriptor, in {{information}} retrieval, {{is a term}} that captures {{the essence of the}} topic of a document. <b>Index</b> <b>terms</b> make up a controlled vocabulary for use in bibliographic records. They {{are an integral part of}} bibliographic control, which is the function by which libraries collect, organize and disseminate documents. They are used as keywords to retrieve documents in an information system, for instance, a catalog or a search engine. A popular form of keywords on the web are tags which are directly visible and can be assigned by non-experts. <b>Index</b> <b>terms</b> can consist of a word, phrase, or alphanumerical term. They are created by analyzing the document either manually with subject indexing or automatically with automatic indexing or more sophisticated methods of keyword extraction. <b>Index</b> <b>terms</b> can either come from a controlled vocabulary or be freely assigned.|$|E

We managed to obtain experimental evidence that the phrase-based retrieval model performs better than keyword-based models.
