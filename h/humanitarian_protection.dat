500|$|The Gateway Protection Programme was {{subsequently}} established in March 2004, {{with the first}} refugees arriving in the UK on 19 March. Initially, the programme quota was set at 500 per year. The British government has faced criticism from academics and practitioners over {{the small number of}} refugees it has resettled in comparison with other developed states. For example, in 2001 the countries with the largest quota schemes were the United States (80,000 refugees), Canada (11,000) and Australia (10,000). Initially, David Blunkett had intended to raise the quota to 1,000 in the second year of the programme's operation, but local councils' reluctance to participate in the scheme meant that it was slow to take off. It has been argued that their reluctance showed that hostile attitudes towards asylum seekers had carried over to affect the most genuinely needy refugees. [...] The quota remained at 500 per year until the 2008/09 financial year, when it was increased to 750 refugees per year. The number of refugees resettled under the scheme is small in comparison to the number of asylum seekers offered protection in the UK. For example, in 2013, 17,647 initial decisions on asylum claims were made by the Home Office, of which 5,734 (32.5 per cent) determined the applicant to be a refugee and granted them asylum, 53 (0.3 per cent) granted <b>humanitarian</b> <b>protection</b> and 540 (3.1 per cent) granted discretionary leave. 11,105 applications (62.9 per cent) were refused. Worldwide, there were 51.2 million forcibly displaced people at the end of 2013, 16.7 million of whom were refugees.|$|E
500|$|The {{programme}} {{has been}} supported by the main British political parties {{at the national level}} since its inception, and there has also been support from councillors from each of the main parties at the local authority level. On the occasion of the tenth anniversary of the scheme in 2014, refugee groups and others praised it as a successful programme and called for it to be expanded, particularly in light of the Syrian refugee crisis. In early 2014, Amnesty International and the Refugee Council campaigned for the government to offer resettlement or <b>humanitarian</b> <b>protection</b> to Syrian refugees above and beyond the Gateway quota of 750 per year, [...] "to ensure that resettlement opportunities continue to be available to refugees {{from the rest of the}} world". The anniversary of the programme was also the occasion of further criticism of the 750 quota, with some commentators arguing that this is mean-spirited and continues to compare unfavourably with the refugee resettlement programmes of states including the United States, Canada and Australia. Others, such as academic Jonathan Darling, have been more skeptical about expanding the scheme, for fear that any such move will be accompanied by greater restrictions on the ability of people to claim asylum in the UK. He argues that [...] "we must be critical of any attempts to expand such a quota-based scheme at the expense of a more progressive asylum system". Furthermore, he argues that the [...] "hospitality" [...] of the scheme is highly conditional and can be viewed as a form of [...] "compassionate repression", with the UNHCR, the Home Office and local authorities all involved in [...] "sorting, decision, and consideration over which individuals are the 'exceptional cases'", to the exclusion of others.|$|E

50|$|By far {{the most}} common outcome for {{separated}} children is a grant of discretionary leave to remain. Discretionary leave to remain is provided most frequently when there are inadequate return arrangements for these children in their country of origin. This leave to remain is usually granted for three years or until the young person reaches 17 ½, whichever is sooner. The child may appeal if he thinks {{he should have been}} granted refugee status or <b>humanitarian</b> <b>protection,</b> but only if he was initially granted more than twelve months’ leave. It should be noted that both grants of <b>humanitarian</b> <b>protection</b> and of discretionary leave are still rejection of asylum claims, so the young people granted either of these have the right to appeal this decision.|$|E

It was first announced in January 2014 and in September 2015 the expansion to 20,000 refugees was made. It is run in partnership between the UK Home Office, the Department for International Development, the Department for Communities and Local Government and NGOs such as Refugee Action. Only 2,659 Syrian refugees were resettled through the programme by the end of June 2016. The National Audit Office estimated the Programme's cost at £1,112 million.

5000|$|Many of the {{migrants}} seek an asylum status under the Convention {{relating to the}} Status of Refugees of the United Nations. However, many of them, mostly citizens of Eritrea and Sudan, cannot be forcibly deported from Israel. The Eritrea citizens (who, since 2009, form {{the majority of the}} undocumented workers in Israel) cannot be deported due to the opinion of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees that Eritrea has a difficult internal situation and a forced recruitment and therefore the Eritrean immigrants are defined as a [...] "temporary <b>humanitarian</b> <b>protection</b> group". Despite the fact that a similar opinion does not exist in relation to citizens of Sudan, Israel does not deport them back to Egypt due to a real fear for their fate. Although the immigrants entered Israel from Egypt, Israel cannot deport them back to Egypt because the Egyptians refuse to give an undertaking not to deport the immigrants to their countries of origin. Accordingly, the Israeli authorities grant a temporary residence permit to the undocumented workers, which need to be renewed every three months. Various authorities in Israel estimate that 80-90 percent of the undocumented workers live primarily in two centers: Tel Aviv (more than 60 percent) and Eilat (more than 20 percent), with a few in Ashdod, Jerusalem and Arad.|$|E

50|$|United Nations Action Against Sexual Violence in Conflict is {{committed}} to aligning the United Nation’s work more effectively behind national efforts to address sexual violence, and to deepen partnerships with the many NGOs and civil society organizations that have been actively working to end sexual violence in conflict for many years.

It strengthens {{the work of the}} <b>humanitarian</b> <b>Protection</b> Cluster, and supports efforts {{to put an end to}} sexual exploitation and abuse by United Nations personnel. United Nations Action Against Sexual Violence in Conflict aims to strengthen efforts to protect women and girls from sexual violence during and after conflict - recognizing that the problem is much more than a security or humanitarian issue. United Nations Action Against Sexual Violence in Conflict supports women’s engagement in conflict prevention and enhances women’s influence over peace negotiations and post conflict recovery processes. This helps ensure that sexual violence is on the agenda of the police, security forces, justice, and government sectors after conflict. United Nations Action Against Sexual Violence in Conflict seeks to strengthen services provided to survivors, including medical care, legal support and economic security required to rebuild their lives. United Nations Action Against Sexual Violence in Conflict also connects with governance and reform processes that improve women’s access to decision-making and strengthen their voices in public affairs, with the long term view of tackling gender-specific power imbalances.|$|E
5000|$|Regarding immigration, UPyD wish to {{transfer}} immigration policy to the European Union as an exclusive competence because {{it affects the}} whole of Europe. Therefore, the party asks the European Commission {{for the inclusion of}} Ceuta and Melilla in the European customs area as full-fledged territories and, hence, external borders of the European Union. UPyD states that controlled immigration is good and necessary for Europe because of its demographic ageing and advocates a common immigration policy with strict respect for international law and human rights that entails a European action protocol to contain illegal immigration. On the one hand, the magenta party supports greater immigration control by arguing that Ceuta's and Melilla's Spanish border fences must be protected. UPyD believes that the Civil Guard should stop illegal immigrants and legally repatriate them to their country of origin or return them to the country which they entered from without violating their human rights, thereby banning deterrents like firing rubber bullets and the use of razor wires. On the other hand, the party stands up for giving asylum and <b>humanitarian</b> <b>protection</b> to displaced people outside their countries because of armed conflicts, without discriminating against Muslim refugees. Likewise, UPyD is favourable to earmark financial resources for promoting democracy in countries where there is no democracy and even to intervene militarily if financial resources are insufficient [...] "to defend and protect human rights and thus no one has to leave those countries".|$|E
