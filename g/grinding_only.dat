40|$|International audienceAn {{in-depth}} study of mechanochromic and thermochromic luminescent copper iodide clusters exhibiting structural polymorphism is reported and gives {{new insights into}} the origin of the mechanochromic luminescence properties. The two different crystalline polymorphs exhibit distinct luminescence properties with one being green emissive and the other one being yellow emissive. Upon mechanical <b>grinding,</b> <b>only</b> one of the polymorphs exhibits great modification of its emission from green to yellow. Interestingly, the photophysical properties of the resulting partially amorphous crushed compound are closed to those of the other yellow polymorph. Comparative structural and optical analyses of the different phases including a solution of clusters permit us to establish a correlation between the Cu-Cu bond distances and the luminescence properties. In addition, the local structure of the [Cu 4 I 4 P 4] cluster cores has been probed by (31) P and (65) Cu solid-state NMR analysis, which readily indicates that the grinding process modifies the phosphorus and copper atoms environments. The mechanochromic phenomenon is thus explained by the disruption of the crystal packing within intermolecular interactions inducing shortening of the Cu-Cu bond distances in the [Cu 4 I 4] cluster core and eventually modification of the emissive state. These results definitely establish the role of cuprophilic interactions in the mechanochromism of copper iodide clusters. More generally, this study constitutes a step further into the understanding of the mechanism involved in the mechanochromic luminescent properties of metal-based compounds...|$|E

Community Dent Oral Epidemiol 2011. (C) 2011 John Wiley & Sons A/S Abstract Objectives: Previous studies have found an association between bruxism and emotional and behavioral problems in children, but reported data are inconsistent. The objective {{of this study was}} to estimate the prevalence of bruxism, and of its components clenching and grinding, and its associations with mental problems and depression. Methods: Data from two Brazilian birth cohorts were analyzed: one from 869 children in Ribeirao Preto RP (Sao Paulo), a more developed city, and the other from 805 children in Sao Luis SL (Maranhao). Current bruxism evaluated by means of a questionnaire applied to the parents/persons responsible for the children was defined when the habit of tooth clenching during daytime and/or tooth grinding at night still persisted until the time of the assessment. Additionally, the lifetime prevalence of clenching during daytime only and grinding at night only was also evaluated. Mental health problems were investigated using the Strength and Difficulties Questionnaire (SDQ) and depression using the Childrens Depression Inventory (CDI). Analyses were carried out for each city: with the SDQ subscales (emotional symptoms, conduct problems, peer problems, attention/hyperactivity disorder), with the total score (sum of the subscales), and with the CDI. These analyses were performed considering different response variables: bruxism, clenching only, and <b>grinding</b> <b>only.</b> The risks were estimated using a Poisson regression model. Statistical inferences were based on 95 % confidence intervals (95 % CI). Results: There was a high prevalence of current bruxism: 28. 7 % in RP and 30. 0 % in SL. The prevalence of clenching was 20. 3 % in RP and 18. 8 % in SL, and grinding was found in 35. 7 % of the children in RP and 39. 1 % in SL. Multivariable analysis showed a significant association of bruxism with emotional symptoms and total SDQ score in both cities. When analyzed separately, teeth clenching was associated with emotional symptoms, peer problems, and total SDQ score; grinding was significantly associated with emotional symptoms and total SDQ score in RP and SL. Female sex appeared as a protective factor for bruxism, and for clenching and grinding in RP. Furthermore, maternal employment outside the home and white skin color of children were associated with increased prevalence of teeth clenching in SL. Conclusions: Mental health problems were associated with bruxism, with teeth clenching only and grinding at night only. No association was detected between depression and bruxism, neither clenching nor grinding. But it is necessary to be cautious regarding the inferences from some of our results...|$|E

40|$|Drilling and {{blasting}} are {{the major}} unit operations in opencast mining. Inspite of the best efforts to introduce mechanization in the opencast mines, blasting continue to dominate the production. Therefore to cut down the cost of production optimal fragmentation from properly designed blasting pattern has to be achieved. Proper adoption of drilling and blasting can contribute significantly towards profitability and therefore optimization of these parameters is essential. Introduction Rock breaking by drilling and blasting is {{the first phase of}} the production cycle in most of the mining operations. Optimization of this operation is very important as the fragmentation obtained thereby affects the cost of the entire gamut of interrelated mining activities, such as drilling, blasting, loading, hauling, crushing and to some extent grinding. Optimization of rock breaking by drilling and blasting is sometimes understood to mean minimum cost in the implementation of these two individual operations. However, a minimum cost for breaking rock may not be in the best interest of the overall mining system. A little more money spent in the rock-breaking operation can be recovered later from the system and the aim of the coordinator of the mining work should be to achieve a minimum combined cost of drilling, blasting, loading, hauling, crushing and <b>grinding.</b> <b>Only</b> a “balance sheet” of total cost of the full gamut of mining operations vis-à-vis production achieved can establish whether the very first phase- rock breaking- was “optimum” financially; leaving aside factors of human safety. An optimum blast is also associated with the most efficient utilization of blasting energy in the rock- breaking process, reducing blasting cost through less explosive consumption and less wastage of explosive energy in blasting, less throw of materials, and reduction of blast vibration resulting in greater degrees of safety and stability to the nearby structures. Development of a Blast Optimization Model Selection of proper explosive in any blasting round is an important aspect of optimum blast design. Basic parameters include VOD of explosive (m/s), Density (g/cc), Characteristic impedance, Energy output (cal/gm), and Explosive type (ANFO, Slurry, Emulsion etc.). However, all these parameters can not be taken for optimizing the blasting method successfully. Some of the parameters are taken for minimizing the blasting cost. These cost reduction and optimum blast design parameter will give an economical result. The parameters are i. Drill hole diameter, ii. Powder factor (desired), iii. Cost of explosive, iv. Numbers of holes required to blast. Methodology The study of the various parameters of blasting suggests that the powder factor should be constant as per the requirement. The number of holes desired as per the explosive, the drill ihole diameter as available and the cost of explosive are kept as input. The spacing, bench height, burden, charge per hole as depending on the previous parameters can be calculated. From the different input and calculated parameters the total cost of the method is calculated and the least expensive method is selected as the optimized model. Blasting related information were collected from three different mines of Mahanadi Coalfields Ltd. (MCL) for implementation of the optimization model. A program was designed using visual basic on. net platform taking the above parameters into consideration to select the optimized model. It was observed that the program gives satisfactory results. A sample output of the program is as presented below: Conclusion The blast optimization model has been developed with simple methodologies which can be adopted by the mining industry to compare the explosive costs and achieve better blasting results and. The model developed is a user friendly one, since by keeping the powder factor and number of choices of explosives available as constant and by varying the parameters like drill hole diameter, number of holes and cost of explosives one can compare the explosive performance and accordingly take a decision to select the proper type of explosives for blasting. It may be noted, that the model has been developed based on case studies of three different mines of MCL, and it can be modified with collection of information from a large number of mines.

Teeth {{grinding}} in piglets is therefore often practiced to reduce these lesions. The {{aim of this study}} was to assess the consequences of grinding piglet teeth in regard to the occurrence of lesions. In this study the piglets' teeth were grinded in 28 litters, and in 36 litters the piglets' teeth were kept intact. Twice, one time during the first week and one time during the second week after birth facial lesions of the piglets were scored and the teats of the sows were examined for lesions. The facial lesion score accounted for the amount and severity of lesions. The individual observations on piglets in the litter were synthesized in a litter facial lesion score. Findings 69. 8 % and 43. 5 % of the piglets had facial lesions in week 1 and week 2 respectively. The effect of treatment was not significant on litter facial lesion score. The litter facial lesion score was higher in week 1 than in week 2 (p p = 0. 003) than in small litters. Mortality between week 1 and week 2 was higher in litters with intact teeth (p = 0. 02). Sow teat lesions only occurred if litters had intact teeth. Conclusions According to our results teeth <b>grinding</b> is <b>only</b> justifiable in large litters. </p...|$|R

In many places, the collected pulverised fuel ash has to be processed through a classifying stage {{before it can be}} used as a construction material. The rejected portion of the classifying process has remained unused due to its high carbon content and large particle size (> 45 μm). However, the rejected ash may be used in certain areas, such as in solidification and stabilisation processes of hazardous waste, and materials for road base or sub-base construction, which require relatively lower strength and reactivity. This paper presents the results of a study on the pozzolanic properties of cementitious materials prepared by blending rejected fly ash (rFA) with calcium hydroxide. The effects of adding chemical activators, elevating curing temperature, and grinding of the ash particles on the activation of rFA were compared by means of compressive strength, differential scanning calorimetry-thermogravimetric analysis, X-ray diffraction analysis and mercury intrusion porosimetry tests. The results show that the addition of Na 2 SO 4 can significantly accelerate the strength development both at 28 and 90 days. K 2 SO 4 is only effective at 28 days.
