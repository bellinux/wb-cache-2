25|$|De facto {{standards}} became formalised as official {{national and}} international standards. Old installations with obsolete sockets exist. The International Electrotechnical Commission in 1934 established technical committee TC 23 for <b>electrical</b> <b>fittings.</b> Only two meetings were held before {{the outbreak of the}} Second World War. In Europe, since 1951 the International Commission on the Rules for the Approval of Electrical Equipment (CEE) has published a standard (CEE 7 Specification for Plugs and Socket-Outlets for Domestic and Similar Purposes) describing the plugs and sockets used. In 1953 the CEE published Technical Report 83 (later 60083), which was a listing of plugs and sockets then in use. In North America the National Electrical Manufacturers' Association (NEMA) publishes standards for plugs and sockets.|$|E
500|$|At {{the end of}} December 1943, Unicorn joined Illustrious, the battlecruiser [...] and the battleships [...] and , {{the other}} {{reinforcements}} for the Eastern Fleet. Only four Swordfish from 818 Squadron were carried aboard at this time. The ship delivered a consignment of aircraft to Royal Navy Air Station Cochin, India, on 27 January 1944 before arriving at Trincomalee, Ceylon on 2 February. In addition to her repair duties, the ship was often used for deck-landing practice. She was given a brief refit in Bombay during May. On 23 August, 818 Squadron was transferred to [...] and later disbanded. On 7 November, 817 Squadron flew aboard to provide anti-submarine protection with its Fairey Barracudas as Unicorn was ordered to Durban, South Africa. There {{she was to be}} modified with separate workshops and additional equipment to accommodate American engines which used different screw threads and <b>electrical</b> <b>fittings.</b>|$|E

[...] Bare's inspection of the aircraft was very detailed and involved considerable maintenance, repair and modification. There were two stages. The first was an assembly-line type of operation in the largest hangar where everything was checked. Examples of some of the problems found were leakage of hydraulic fittings, generators not working, loose <b>electrical</b> <b>fittings,</b> instruments inoperative, low fluid levels and missing parts, especially clocks. One C-46 arrived with a block of wood in a carburetor air filter.|$|E
2500|$|Original {{proprietor}} Thomas Molloy leased {{the theatre}} to others, including Ben and John Fuller, and local producer Anita Fitzgerald. Another lessee of the theatre, J.C. Williamson Ltd, {{is said to}} have made His Majesty's Theatre the Perth home of musical theatre. The theatre was renovated in 1912 at a cost of £9,000, and again in 1948 at a cost of £11,000. The latter renovation included new backstage <b>electrical</b> <b>fittings</b> and may also have been the time the verandah balconies were removed from the street frontage of the theatre. In 1952, the theatre was leased by the Edgley family and used for [...] "Russian spectaculars". The theatre was redecorated for Edgley and Dawe in 1960, this time at a cost of £7,000. Edgley went on to purchase His Majesty's in 1969. After the Perth Entertainment Centre was completed in 1974, the Edgley productions shifted there, and the newly completed Perth Concert Hall was also favoured as a performance venue due to outdated equipment and general disrepair at His Majesty's. The theatre was sold in 1976 to Sir Norman Rydge.|$|E
2500|$|Joseph Wilson [...] Swan {{was born}} in 1828 at Pallion Hall in Pallion in the Parish of Bishopwearmouth, Sunderland, County Durham. His parents were John Swan and Isabella Cameron. He {{was said to have}} had an enquiring mind even as a child. He {{augmented}} his education with a fascination of his surroundings, the industry of the area and reading. He attended lectures at the Sunderland Atheneum. He later became a partner in Mawson's, a firm of manufacturing chemists in Newcastle upon Tyne, started by John Mawson (9 Sep 1819 – 17 December 1867) the husband of his sister, Elizabeth Swan (22 Nov 1822 – 2 August 1905). This company existed as Mawson, Swan and Morgan until 1973, formerly located on Grey Street in Newcastle upon Tyne near Grey's Monument. The premises are now occupied by hamburger chain Byron and can be identified by a line of Victorian-style electric street lamps in front of the store on Grey Street. Swan lived at Underhill, Low Fell, Gateshead, a large house on Kells Lane North, where he conducted most of his experiments in the large conservatory. The house was later converted into a private fee paying, grant aided co-educational grammar school named Beaconsfield School. Here, students could still find examples of Swan's original <b>electrical</b> <b>fittings.</b>|$|E

5000|$|Almost {{immediately}} after the maintenance period Asheville began a work-up for another six-month deployment to the Western Pacific. This work-up included various underway periods, for weekly operations. At the end of May 1999, Asheville conducted two family day cruises. The first left Pearl Harbor and steamed to Lahaina, Maui. Asheville anchored a mile off the Maui coast for five days. She returned to Pearl Harbor, {{at the end of}} the week, with the second group of family members aboard. In July 1999, Asheville deployed to the Eastern Pacific (EASTPAC) for two months, continuing work-ups with the John C. Stennis Carrier Strike Group. During this deployment, she visited San Diego, CA, Esquimalt/Victoria, British Columbia, Canada, and Ketchikan, Alaska. While conducting sound testing off the coast of Ketchikan, Asheville was suspended at a depth of 400 feet, and held in position by four mooring buoys above. During this 36-hour period, the crew made phone calls with a line rigged though an <b>electrical</b> <b>fitting.</b> After the testing, the boat surfaced. The crew ate hamburgers, and [...] "got some sun". Some of the crew members swam in the 50 degree waters of Behm Canal. She returned to Pearl Harbor, at the end of August, 1999. She conducted a six-week upkeep period, after which a Change of Command Ceremony was held on 15 October 1999, as CDR Grooms was relieved by CDR Ingalls. At the end of October 1999, Asheville returned to San Diego for three weeks where she completed final work-ups with the Stennis Battle Group, including staged attacks on the ship. Asheville was the only ship in the Battle Group that was not successfully boarded or attacked. Another part of this final work up included SPEC WAR, off the coast of California, when Asheville launched a BGM-109 Tomahawk Cruise Missile. After the launch, an F-14 Tomcat pilot took control of the missile. The missile flew to Naval Air Weapons Station China Lake, California, hitting the target perfectly. Asheville returned to Pearl Harbor at the end of November, 1999. She completed a six-week upkeep period, and made final preparations for her forthcoming deployment.|$|R

Voltammetric investigations showed that the polymer exhibited quasireversible kinetics in a potential window of - 400  mV to 700  mV, with a formal potential of 322  mV vs. Ag/AgCl. The diffusion coefficient was calculated to be 1. 02 × 10 - 6 cm 2 s- 1 for a thin film with a surface concentration of 1. 83 × 10 - 7 mol cm- 2 having a rate constant of 2. 20 × 10 - 3 cm s- 1 at 5  mV s- 1. Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy provided quantitative information about the conductivity changes within the modified polymer and support for the quasireversible kinetics suggested by voltammetry.

40|$|Nanoscale {{structures}} {{have been}} at the core of research efforts dealing with integration of nanotechnology into novel electronic devices for the last decade. For instance, the unique electrical and optical properties of nanowires, nanotubes and nanocables with vertical orientation, assembled in nanoscale arrays, have been used in many device applications such as sensors that hold the potential to augment brain functions. However, the challenge in creating nanowires/nanotubes or nanocables arrays based sensors lies in making individual <b>electrical</b> connections <b>fitting</b> both the features of the brain and of the nanostructures. This review discusses two of the most important applications of nanostructures in neuroscience. First, the current approaches to create nanowires and nanocable structures are reviewed to critically evaluate their potential of developing unique nanostructure based sensors to improve recording and device performance to reduce noise and the detrimental effect of the interface on the tissue. Second, the implementation of nanomaterials in neurobiological and medical applications will be considered from the brain augmentation perspective. Because the size of nanomaterials is of the same order of magnitude with that of biomolecules, these materials are valuable tools for nanoscale manipulation in a broad range of neurobiological systems. Novel applications for diagnosis and treatment of brain diseases such as multiple sclerosis, meningitis, stroke, epilepsy, Alzheimer disease, schizophrenia, and autism will be considered. Because the blood brain barrier (BBB) has a defensive mechanism in preventing nanomaterials arrival to the brain, various strategies to help them to passing through the BBB will be discussed. The nanostructures at the interface between nanotechnology and neuroscience will play a pivotal role not only in addressing the multitude of brain disorders but also to repair/augment brain functions...|$|R
