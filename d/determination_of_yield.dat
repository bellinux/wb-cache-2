The correlations between these physiological traits and traits related to yield were examined and localized with the corresponding QTLs on a genetic map. Glycine and serine metabolism in developing kernels and the cognate genes appeared to be of major importance for kernel production. The importance of kernel glutamine synthesis in the <b>determination</b> <b>of</b> <b>yield</b> was also confirmed. The genetic and physiological bases of N metabolism in the developing ear can be studied in an integrated manner by means of a quantitative genetic approach using molecular markers and genomics, and combining agronomic, physiological and correlation studies.

Experimental tests have been carried out on five steel qualities (low and ultra-low carbon) with thickness between 0. 8 and 1. 5 mm.

40|$|This study {{presents}} a new theoretical <b>determination</b> <b>of</b> <b>yield</b> stress for pure mono-crystal materials {{based on the}} concept of the Efficient Area of Stress (EAS). From the atomic yield stress on the atomic surface a², given by the model of Orowan, the macroscopic yield stress is then obtained through a Scale Law of Measure (SLM) which depends only on the lattice spacing and a constant L. This relation shows that the efficient atomic dimension is a fractal dimension. The precision obtained by the SLM is of an atomic order compared to the error (102 to 104 MPa) obtained by classical theories. The SLM gives also new theoretical relations for the elastic limit of strain, the toughness and the fracture strength. The SLM is finally extended to non pure materials {{to take into account the}} microstructures (grain size, impurity, phases, solutions, etc.) and the temperature effects by introducing the concept of an "efficient atomic distance"...|$|E

40|$|The {{degradation}} of teak forest plantations in Java that are managed by Perum Perhutani (PP) continues to happen, {{and this is}} caused by some risk factors such as illegal logging, grazing, forest fire, and encroachment.

40|$|Nowadays, {{more oil}} and gas {{transportation}} pipelines are constructed in areas with permafrost and/or higher seismic activity. These pipelines can be subjected to longitudinal plastic deformations necessitating a strain based design. Since girth- and seam welds are critical in terms of structural integrity, it is desirable to know their mechanical properties. In a strain based design context, the accurate <b>determination</b> <b>of</b> <b>yield</b> strength and hardening are necessary. A longitudinally extracted (is parallel to the pipe axis) specimen notched at the weld region and loaded in tension, in combination with inverse modelling {{is assumed to be}} a valuable tool to determine these properties. This notched cross weld test ensures that the largest deformations will occur at the weld, thereby allowing to fully determine the stress-strain behaviour of the weld metal. Inverse modelling combines experimental full-field strain data with numerical simulations to determine the constitutive parameters. Strains will be measured experimentally and compared with simulated data. By minimizing their difference, i. e. a certain cost function, a correspondence is found and the desired parameters are determined.
