5|$|Booth {{held his}} bloody knife over <b>his</b> <b>head,</b> <b>and</b> yelled {{something}} to the audience.|$|E
5|$|His head {{hangs in}} exhaustion, {{and his hands}} bleed from the {{puncture}} wounds suffered during his nailing to the cross. His arms are placed higher above <b>his</b> <b>head</b> <b>and</b> strain to carry {{the weight of his}} body, which visibly slumps. His body takes on a dramatic, almost feminine curve, the result of the contortions forced upon a body nailed to a vertical support.|$|E
5|$|In {{a similar}} legend {{related to the}} birth of Ayyappa, the demon Surpanaka earns the power to turn anyone into ashes by his austerities. The tale mirrors all other aspects of the Buddhist version of the Bhasmasura tale, where he is forced by Mohini to severe {{fidelity}} by keeping his hand on <b>his</b> <b>head</b> <b>and</b> is burnt.|$|E
60|$|Ginger shook <b>his</b> <b>'ead,</b> <b>and,</b> arter {{thinking}} a bit, Peter shook his too.|$|R
60|$|Then {{the little}} man fell to with both <b>his</b> <b>heads,</b> <b>and</b> soon {{finished}} the last morsel.|$|R
60|$|Mr. Scutts raised <b>his</b> <b>head</b> sharply <b>and</b> <b>his</b> lips parted; then <b>his</b> <b>head</b> sank again, <b>and</b> {{he became}} a dead weight in the grasp of his assistants.|$|R
5|$|On November 28, 2015, Hardy {{lost the}} WrestleCade Championship to Jeff Jarrett at WrestleCade IV in Winston-Salem, NC after taking two guitar shots to the head, which opened a six-inch gash on <b>his</b> <b>head,</b> <b>and</b> {{required}} 38 stitches to close. Hardy regained the Wrestlecade Championship in a triple-threat cage match against Jarrett and Ethan Carter III in Hickory, NC on May 20, 2016.|$|E
5|$|The family {{continues}} {{to sing and}} more videos are shown. Snake again breaks {{into the house and}} claims that he got a song stuck in <b>his</b> <b>head</b> <b>and</b> {{the only way to get}} rid of it is to kill the Simpsons. He tries to shoot them, but discovers that his gun is out of ammunition and leaves again.|$|E
5|$|A snow {{called the}} Unity {{was added to}} the fleet, and used as a tender, but was {{abandoned}} during an encounter with a man of war named the Mermaid. As Low's success increased in the Caribbean, so did his notoriety. Eventually, a bounty was placed on <b>his</b> <b>head,</b> <b>and</b> Low set out for the Azores, again teaming up with Charles Harris. As they terrorised the Azores, the pressure increased from the authorities, who by then had taken special notice of Low, despite the hordes of pirates in operation at the time.|$|E
6000|$|Bill ’ung <b>his</b> <b>’ead</b> <b>and</b> {{looked a}} bit silly. [...] "I’d rather not, mate," [...] he ses, at last. [...] "I’ve been teetotal for eleven months now." ...|$|R
5000|$|And behold a {{great red}} dragon, having seven <b>heads</b> <b>and</b> ten horns, and seven crowns upon <b>his</b> <b>heads.</b> <b>And</b> <b>his</b> tail drew {{the third part}} {{of the stars of}} heaven, and did cast them to the earth. (Rev. 12:3-4, KJV) ...|$|R
60|$|Bill Chambers sat {{staring at}} 'im <b>and</b> {{scratching}} <b>his</b> <b>'ead,</b> <b>and</b> just {{then they all}} 'eard the voice of Bob Pretty, very distinct, outside, asking for Henery Walker. Then the door opened, and Bob Pretty, carrying <b>his</b> <b>'ead</b> very 'igh, walked into the room.|$|R
5|$|As {{part of the}} coaster's major refurbishment, a new, {{original}} storyline {{was added}} with a completely redesigned queue experience that places guests inside a perilous scientific experiment led by General Thaddeus Ross. The entrance features a statue of Hulk holding one of the ride's vehicles over <b>his</b> <b>head,</b> <b>and</b> arching tracks passing over him. These arching coaster tracks came from the original Hulk Roller Coaster. The televisions now show CGI animations of test subjects being exposed to gamma radiation and being transformed into Hulk-like creatures. As of April 2015, riders must pass through metal detectors and security personnel and must rid themselves of all loose items from their pockets.|$|E
5|$|Both sexes reach sexual {{maturity}} at {{one year of}} age. The male mates with the female by swimming close to her with his head lowered and tail raised, continually whistling. If there {{is a group of}} males, they will chase the female in flight until only one drake is left. The female prepares for copulation, which takes place in the water, by lowering her body; the male then bobs his head up and down and mounts the female, taking the feathers {{on the back of her}} head in his mouth. After mating, he raises <b>his</b> <b>head</b> <b>and</b> back and whistles.|$|E
5|$|Captain Blackadder's trench {{receives}} {{a phone call}} from HQ: a full-scale attack has been ordered for the next day at dawn. Realising that this is likely to mean his death, Blackadder plans to escape by pretending to be mad: he puts underpants on <b>his</b> <b>head</b> <b>and</b> sticks pencils in his nostrils. His plan is thwarted when General Melchett arrives to see what is happening and remarks that he shot an entire platoon that used this exact method; Blackadder overhears and narrowly escapes Melchett's punishment by pretending he is relating the story to Baldrick.|$|E
6000|$|LONG--[Bitterly.] It's {{straight}} enuf. [With grim humor.] They wouldn't bloody well {{pay that}} for a 'airy ape's skin--no, nor for the 'ole livin' ape with all <b>'is</b> <b>'ead,</b> <b>and</b> body, and soul thrown in! ...|$|R
60|$|Bill Chambers shook <b>his</b> <b>'ead,</b> <b>and</b> George Barstow, {{more and}} more certain that he 'ad caught 'im trying to kill 'is cat and that 'e wouldn't eat the stuff, rose 'im up to ten shillings.|$|R

5|$|Cornwallis {{refused to}} attend the {{surrender}} ceremony, citing illness. Instead, Brigadier General Charles O'Hara led the British army onto the field. O'Hara first attempted to surrender to Rochambeau, who shook <b>his</b> <b>head</b> <b>and</b> pointed to Washington. O'Hara then offered his sword to Washington, who also refused and motioned to Benjamin Lincoln. The surrender finally took place when Washington's second-in-command accepted the sword of Cornwallis' deputy.|$|E
5|$|Dr Sadiq Alekry, a 44-year-old plastic surgeon, voluntarily {{offered his}} {{services}} at the roundabout {{on the evening of}} 16February, shortly after he had returned from Houston. According to Human rights watch, Alekry along with other staff were wearing special medical jackets showing the Red Crescent. During the raid, riot police attacked his tent and cut through it; despite telling them he was a physician, police handcuffed him from his back and a number of security officers repeatedly punched, kicked and hit him with sticks on <b>his</b> <b>head</b> <b>and</b> other parts of the body.|$|E
5|$|Female okapis become {{sexually mature}} at about one-and-a-half years old, while males reach {{maturity}} after two years. Rut in males and estrus in females {{does not depend}} on the season. In captivity, estrus cycles recur every 15 days. The male and the female begin courtship by circling, smelling and licking each other. The male shows his dominance by extending his neck, tossing <b>his</b> <b>head</b> <b>and</b> protruding one leg forward. This is followed by mounting and copulation.|$|E
60|$|He shook <b>his</b> <b>'ead</b> <b>and</b> smiled agin, and, arter {{opening the}} wicket a trifle {{and telling the}} cabman he shouldn't be long, {{he turned to me}} and asked me for the sixpence, to wear on his watch-chain.|$|R
60|$|He smiled, shook <b>his</b> <b>head</b> slowly, <b>and</b> {{watched her}} disappointment.|$|R
60|$|Once {{more the}} {{ambassador}} shook <b>his</b> <b>head,</b> slowly <b>and</b> thoughtfully.|$|R
5|$|Ferb {{was given}} a simplistic {{structure}} so that young audiences {{would be able to}} draw him easily. As with the other characters of Phineas and Ferb, Ferb's design is constructed of geometric shapes in homage to animator Tex Avery. Ferb's head is based on a rectangle with a wider top than bottom. A square is used for his nose, and an egg-shaped oval is used for his eyes. The eye furthest from the screen is always drawn larger than the other. Povenmire uses a nine-step process to draw Ferb, starting with <b>his</b> <b>head</b> <b>and</b> ending with touch ups.|$|E
5|$|First-class {{relics of}} Kolbe exist, {{in the form}} of hairs from <b>his</b> <b>head</b> <b>and</b> beard, {{preserved}} without his knowledge by two friars at Niepokalanów who served as barbers in his friary between 1930 and 1941. Since his beatification in 1971, more than 1,000 such relics have been distributed around the world for public veneration. Second-class relics such as his personal effects, clothing and liturgical vestments, are preserved in his monastery cell and in a chapel at Niepokalanów, and may be viewed by visitors.|$|E
5|$|Given {{began the}} 2016–17 season as first choice 'keeper due to Butland being sidelined. On 27 August 2016, he conceded an unfortunate own goal in a 1–0 away defeat to Everton. Given had palmed a Leighton Baines penalty onto the post but the ball rebounded against <b>his</b> <b>head</b> <b>and</b> {{went over the}} line. After conceding four goals against Tottenham Hotspur and Crystal Palace in September, Given lost {{his place in the}} side to Lee Grant. He was {{released}} by Stoke {{at the end of the}} 2016–17 season.|$|E
60|$|He {{went off}} up the 'ill shaking <b>his</b> <b>'ead,</b> <b>and</b> Sam's pal, arter {{watching}} {{him for a}} few seconds, said good-bye in a hurry and went off arter 'im to tell him to keep 'is mouth shut about it.|$|R
60|$|He nodded <b>his</b> <b>head</b> gloomily, <b>and</b> seemed pondering {{a serious}} question.|$|R
60|$|He {{stood before}} her, with <b>his</b> <b>head</b> down, <b>and</b> sighed bitterly.|$|R
5|$|He {{was dressed}} in a strange way. A šajkača was pulled to the front of <b>his</b> <b>head</b> <b>and</b> almost {{completely}} covered his forehead. His eyebrows were hardly visible. Under its weight, the ears seemed to have collapsed. He wore a kind of long, black coat, covered in mud and held in place by a string. He used another piece of string for a belt, and from it hung a pot for boiling water, a tea strainer, a canteen, and other useful things. He walked slightly bent forward, followed everywhere by the noise of the things clashing at his waist.|$|E
5|$|In Brussels, Rodin {{created his}} first {{full-scale}} work, The Age of Bronze, having returned from Italy. Modeled after a Belgian soldier, the figure {{drew inspiration from}} Michelangelo's Dying Slave, which Rodin had observed at the Louvre. Attempting to combine Michelangelo's mastery of the human form with his own sense of human nature, Rodin studied his model from all angles, at rest and in motion; he mounted a ladder for additional perspective, and made clay models, which he studied by candlelight. The result was a life-size, well-proportioned nude figure, posed unconventionally {{with his right hand}} atop <b>his</b> <b>head,</b> <b>and</b> his left arm held out at his side, forearm parallel to the body.|$|E
5|$|In October 1917, Cooper went to France {{with the}} 201st Squadron. He {{attended}} flying school in Issoudun. While flying with his friend, Cooper hit <b>his</b> <b>head</b> <b>and</b> {{was knocked out}} during a 200-foot plunge. After the incident, Cooper suffered from shock and had to relearn how to fly. Cooper requested to go to Clermont-Ferrand to be trained as a bomber pilot. He became a pilot on the 20th Aero Squadron (which later became the 1st Day Bombardment Group).|$|E
