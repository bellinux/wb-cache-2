I have traveled through all of the province and have inspected all of the villages and, considering carefully the usefulness the Spanish subjugation has brought to us, I have not found a single thing but painful and inexorable servitude.... The demand for tribute is not appeased by the poverty that locks up our comrades as in a jail, nor is the thirst for our blood satisfied by the continuous whippings that bite and tear our bodies to pieces.|$|E

500|$|During the {{exhibition}} Etty suffered a serious bout of rheumatic fever. Exhausted by illness and {{the stress of}} {{the exhibition}}, when the exhibition was complete he returned to York in very poor health. On 3November 1849 he suffered a serious asthma attack, thought to have been made worse by his neglecting to wear his flannel undershirt the night before. His condition deteriorated rapidly, and by 10November he was bedridden. On Tuesday 13November, watching the sun set over the River Ouse, he was heard to say [...] "Wonderful! Wonderful! This death!" [...] Later that night, Betsy Etty wrote to Joseph Gillott that [...] "Uncle paid the last debt to nature at [...] past Eight [...] tonight. <b>I</b> <b>do</b> <b>not</b> <b>know</b> <b>what</b> to do.

500|$|The {{film was}} well {{received}} by film critics {{and even the}} passing mentions in The Moving Picture World remarked {{that it was a}} good offering with good photography. Jack Harvey's debut film as a director was well received by the public due to its [...] "universally appealing" [...] theme. Thanhouser writes that the [...] "loyal dog's attachment to his little girl playmate is treated with pictorial beauty and simple, honest sentiment", and notes that when it was released on October 4, 1914, reviewers praised the [...] "double-exposure passages for their dramatic effectiveness". Louis Reeves Harrison of The Moving Picture World review of the film stated, [...] "This play becomes one of delicate pathos toward the end through some remarkable feats of double exposure, and it is one of beauty throughout because of the acting of a four-year-old tot, Baby Helen, a veritable star in her class. Shep contributes with exceptional intelligence - he is not eternally looking at his master out of scope for a word of command. ... <b>I</b> <b>do</b> <b>not</b> <b>know</b> <b>what</b> director handled this subject, but I suggest he apply his thought visualizations to the human characters of future stories. It is the exhibition of what passes in the minds and hearts of characters that brings an audience into closer sympathy with them and makes tense interest possible when melodrama merely brings a laugh. The double exposures are timed with such skill in this instance that all concerned in their production deserve high praise. They give beauty and dignity to a very simple story." ...|$|E
500|$|A {{few years}} later, Griswold {{moved back to}} New York City, leaving his younger {{daughter}} {{in the care of}} the Myers family and his elder daughter, Emily, with relatives on her mother's side. He had by now earned the nickname [...] "Grand Turk", and in the summer of 1847 made plans to edit an anthology of poetry by American women. He believed that women were incapable of the same kind of [...] "intellectual" [...] poetry as men and believed they needed to be divided: [...] "The conditions of aesthetic ability in the two sexes are probably distinct, or even opposite", he wrote in his introduction. The selections he chose for The Female Poets of America were not necessarily the greatest examples of poetry but instead were chosen because they emphasized traditional morality and values. That same year, Griswold began working on what he considered [...] "the maximum opus of his life", an extensive biographical dictionary. Although he worked on it for several years and even advertised for it, it was never produced. He also helped Elizabeth F. Ellet publish her book Women of the American Revolution, and was angered when she did not acknowledge his assistance in the book. In July 1848, he visited poet Sarah Helen Whitman in Providence, Rhode Island, although he had been suffering with vertigo and exhaustion, rarely leaving his apartment at New York University, and was unable to write without taking opium. In autumn of that year, he had an epileptic fit, the first of many he would suffer for the remainder of his life. One fit caused him to fall out of a ferry in Brooklyn and nearly drown. He wrote to publisher James T. Fields: [...] "I am in a terrible condition, physically and mentally. <b>I</b> <b>do</b> <b>not</b> <b>know</b> <b>what</b> the end will be... I am exhaustedbetwixt life and deathand heaven and hell." [...] In 1849, he was further troubled when Charles Fenno Hoffman, with whom he had become good friends, was committed to an insane asylum.|$|E

The journalist Giampaolo Pansa [...] visited the old boss that year and described the decline in an article entitled The sunset of the mafia (in Italian: Il tramonto del mafioso) in which he depicted the old boss in rather squalid and degenerating circumstances {{after the death of}} his wife Rosalia. He did not answer the many questions and denied the existence of the Mafia: [...] "Mafia? Mafia in Sicily? Out of the question!

2500|$|Whom {{shall we}} in future trust? Here is Sir Morton Peto, saying expressly, ‘These {{debentures}} are not debentures; <b>I</b> <b>do</b> <b>not</b> <b>know</b> <b>what</b> they are, but debentures they are not. I got money on them, it is true, {{but they are}} not worth anything.

We could not have believed that such a defence could have been offered. How is Lombard-street ever to rely on having good debentures, when it finds men of the greatest repute and the highest standing offering it documents so very like debentures, but after all not real? ... Of course the company was primarily responsible; but Sir Morton Peto was acting as their trusted financial agent, ... and therefore he must be held responsible, not of course exclusively, but conjointly with those with whom he acted." ...|$|E
2500|$|Reynolds joined {{several of}} his fellow {{officers}} in urging that Hooker be replaced, {{in the same way}} he had spoken out against Maj. Gen. Ambrose Burnside after Fredericksburg. On the previous occasion, Reynolds wrote in a private letter, [...] "If we do not get some one soon who can command an army without consulting 'Stanton and Halleck' at Washington, <b>I</b> <b>do</b> <b>not</b> <b>know</b> <b>what</b> will become of this Army." [...] President Abraham Lincoln met with Reynolds in a private interview on June 2 and is believed to have asked him whether he would consider being the next commander of the Army of the Potomac. Reynolds supposedly replied that {{he would be willing to}} accept only if he were given a free hand and could be isolated from the political influences that had affected the Army commanders throughout the war. Unable to comply with his demands, Lincoln promoted the more junior George G. Meade to replace Hooker on June 28.|$|E
2500|$|Rousseau also {{mentioned}} the watchmaker theory. He wrote the following in his 1762 book, Emile: [...] I am {{like a man}} who sees the works of a watch for the first time; he is never weary of admiring the mechanism, though he does not know the use of the instrument and has never seen its face. <b>I</b> <b>do</b> <b>not</b> <b>know</b> <b>what</b> this is for, says he, but I see that each part of it is fitted to the rest, I admire the workman in the details of his work, and I am quite certain that all these wheels only work together in this fashion for some common end which I cannot perceive. Let us compare the special ends, the means, the ordered relations of every kind, then let us listen to the inner voice of feeling; what healthy mind can reject its evidence? Unless the eyes are blinded by prejudices, can they fail to see that the visible order of the universe proclaims a supreme intelligence? What sophisms must be brought together before we fail to understand the harmony of existence and the wonderful co-operation of every part for the maintenance of the rest? ...|$|E

2500|$|The {{practice}} of foot binding became popular among the elite during the Song dynasty, and {{the earliest known}} references to bound feet appeared in the later part of the eleventh century. In the twelfth century, in the earliest extant discourse on the {{practice of}} foot binding, [...] considered that a bound foot should be arch-shape and small. A thirteenth-century writer, , complained that [...] "little children not yet {{four or five years}} old, who have done nothing wrong, nevertheless are made to suffer unlimited pain to bind [...] small. <b>I</b> <b>do</b> <b>not</b> <b>know</b> <b>what</b> use this is". Evidence from archaeology indicates that footbinding was practiced among the wives and daughters of officials in the thirteenth century. However, the style of bound feet found in Song Dynasty tombs, where the big toe was bent upwards, appears to be different from the norm of later eras, and the excessive smallness of the feet, the [...] "three-inch golden lotus", may be a later development in the 16th century. [...] By the end of the Song dynasty, men would drink from a special shoe whose heel contained a small cup. During the Yuan dynasty, some would also drink directly from the shoe itself. This practice was called [...] "toast to the golden lotus" [...] and lasted until the late Qing dynasty.|$|E
2500|$|During the 15th century {{opinion was}} more evenly split {{as to the}} nature of the Pyramids. [...] An {{anonymous}} traveler in 1420 speaks of going [...] "to see the most marvelous fourteen granaries of Pharaoh, five or six miles distant from Cairo." [...] He continues, [...] "you must cross the river Nile that flows from the Earthly Paradise ... and from the top [...] there is a good view of the very large city of Cairo. [...] But there, around these granaries, there is such a great colony of rats that it sometimes seems as if they cover the entire ground." [...] In 1436 the Spaniard Pero Tafur visited and left a rather fanciful account: [...] "We went to see the Granaries of Joseph, which are three leagues from the mouth of the river, in the desert. Although they say that there are many more further inland, there are only three here, two great ones, and one lesser one. They are diamond shaped, with the apex raised, and they must be much higher than the Great Tower at Seville. As one enters through the door there is a wall joined to another, making a circular stairway which reaches to the top, with many windows. And the beasts, when they are laden, climb up and are unloaded through those windows, and so they fill the granaries to the top. [...] Certainly I never thought that there was such a great building in the world to-day, nor have I seen the like before or since." [...] Another curious interpretation was offered by Georges Lengherand, Mayor of Mons, who visited in 1486: [...] "These granaries are very marvelous buildings and there used to be fourteen and now there are only six or seven. [...] It is impossible to enter, and they are all of dressed stone ... and are in the manner of a hill ... And while we were there, we found four wolves asleep on the stones ... And around these granaries are small little chambers, several cut into the rock; <b>I</b> <b>do</b> <b>not</b> <b>know</b> <b>what</b> could be their use, unless at the time theses granaries were in existence there were guards in these little chambers." [...] The German traveler Arnold von Harff paid a visit in 1497 and left a fairly objective report: [...] "We went across the Nile to these three Kassa Pharaonis. [...] As we approached near these three towers we saw that they were very strange buildings ... We climbed up outside for three full hours to the top, which is about two roods square. [...] From there we saw far out over the whole of the land of Egypt, and over the country to Alexandria and the western sea ... They say that King Pharaoh caused the towers to be built during the lean years, and kept them full of corn. [...] That is why they are called the Kassa Pharaonis. [...] But I could find no entrance. [...] Some say that they are the tombs of the old kings of Egypt." ...|$|E
