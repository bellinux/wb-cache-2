40|$|Further {{growth of}} {{cross-border}} e-commerce in the European Union markets requires improved express delivery services. The framework {{presented in this}} paper identifies relevant contextual factors that affect express delivery adoption rates in European cross-border e-commerce. This framework leads to a set of hypotheses, both on the effects of <b>express</b> <b>deliveries</b> on financial performance indicators (order incidence, order size, and repurchase rate) and on the factors that drive demand for <b>express</b> <b>deliveries</b> (consumer income, logistic costs, and lead-time benefits). A case study provides empirical tests of the hypotheses, using data on about forty thousand sales transactions from a consumer electronics manufacturer’s cross-border online shop. The findings are that express delivery has positive effects on financial performance, as it leads to higher order incidence, larger order size, and higher repurchase rates in cross-border transactions. Demand for express delivery services increases with higher income, larger lead-time benefits, and lower logistic costs. Managers can employ the presented framework to formulate and analyse their own targets for performance and express delivery services...|$|E

40|$|The goal of {{this thesis}} is to assess how would a {{potential}} deal between Deutsche Post DHL (also referred to as DPDHL or simply DHL) and Austrian Post (also referred to as Österreichische Post or simply OP) result {{in terms of value}} creation for both companies.

The top capabilities of DHL as well as geographic proximity with OP could leverage very important efficiencies of many kinds. Common practices on valuations are used to assess the individual value of both companies, which serve as basis to project future trends based in case a merger would take place. Decreasing traditional Mail volume and opportunities in <b>Express</b> <b>deliveries</b> due to e-commerce are found to be the main factors affecting the value of these companies.

40|$|AbstractA Mobile Depot (MD) is {{a trailer}} {{fitted with a}} loading dock, {{warehousing}} facilities and an office. The trailer {{is used as a}} mobile inner city base from where last-mile deliveries and first-mile pick-ups are done with electrically supported cyclocargos. In the morning and evening it is used to transport shipments from and to a peripheral depot. The MD was developed by TNT Express {{as a response to the}} challenging urban working conditions: narrow streets, mixed traffic, traffic congestion, congestion charging, environmental zones, etc. TNT Express tested this innovative concept in Brussels for a period of three months in 2013 as part of the European FP 7 project STRAIGHTSOL. Regular TNT <b>Express</b> <b>deliveries</b> and pick-ups in Brussels are carried out from the TNT depot at the Brussels freight airport using diesel trucks for pallets and using diesel vans for parcels and documents. During the trial period, the parcels and documents destined for a part of the inner city were delivered and picked up through the MD. This new way of working resulted in a decrease of the number of diesel kilometres from 1. 34 km per stop in the Business-As-Usual scenario to 0. 52 km per stop in the Mobile-Depot scenario. This decrease can be linked to a positive environmental impact with, for example, 24 % less emission of CO 2 and up to 59 % less emission of PM 2. 5. TNT Express was able to successfully integrate the MD in their operations. Service levels dropped slightly mainly due to the additional time needed to load the cyclocargos. However, none of the TNT customers complained about the quality of service. For TNT, delivering through the MD was twice as expensive as before. However, they feel it is possible to further decrease the operational costs by using the MD at its full capacity (the MD was only used at 40 % of its full capacity) and by further refining the handling. A multi-actor multi-criteria analysis (MAMCA) of the MD concept revealed under which conditions it would become a more profitable concept to TNT Express: internalised external costs, higher capacity use and higher drop density. The MAMCA also revealed that the benefits are mostly for the other stakeholders, especially society...|$|E
40|$|Although inevitable, {{urban traffic}} causes air {{pollution}}, noise pollution and congestion. Up to 20 % of urban traffic {{is related to}} freight transport and service trips and, proportionally, it contributes more to the negative side-effects of urban traffic than passenger related traffic. Throughout the past few decades, a range of solutions to reduce {{the negative impact of}} urban freight transport have been researched, tested and implemented. Two possible solutions are: freight flow consolidation and off-hour deliveries. They have two things in common. First, {{despite the fact that it}} is generally accepted that there are considerable benefits to both solutions they seem to remain permanently promising and have not been widely adopted yet. Second, they require support of both public and commercial stakeholders to be successful in the long term. The purpose of this thesis is to identify feasible, consensual and successful applications of urban freight flow consolidation and off-hour deliveries. To reach that goal a twofold approach is adopted: (i) reassessing the generally accepted logic behind freight flow consolidation and off-hour deliveries as well as their impact and (ii) evaluating both concepts and/or their applications from the perspective of all stakeholders. One possible freight flow consolidation solution is to implement an Urban Consolidation Centre (UCC). A review of the available UCC impact assessment made me conclude that 87 % of UCCs have a positive impact on the number of urban freight vehicle kilometres. However, this positive impact might have to partially be put down to the lack of high-quality urban freight data and the consequent too positive estimations. Despite the dominant attention for UCCs in the literature on urban freight flow consolidation, there are alternative approaches. This thesis identifies and categorizes them and cites existing, often small-scale examples. One possible alternative approach is to use a Mobile Depot for <b>express</b> <b>deliveries</b> and pick-ups. Evaluating this concept revealed that it decreases the amount of emitted pollutants and the number of diesel vehicle kilometres but doubles the operational costs for the express service provider. The thesis also demonstrates that there is no overall stakeholder support for a general shift of urban freight flows to off-hours in Belgium. There are, however, freight flows that are more suited than others to be shifted to off-hours. My research identifies these freight flows and characterizes them. Based on this research, one particularly suited freight flow would be supermarket deliveries. Evaluating a trial that took place in Brussels revealed that there are considerable time and fuel savings when deliveries to two supermarkets in Brussels are shifted to off-hours and that this solution would be able to receive overall stakeholder support when sufficient measures are taken to keep the noise nuisance for local residents to a minimum. Finally, the thesis contributes to the research field of urban freight transport by introducing the concept of stakeholder involvement in the evaluation of urban freight transport solutions by using Multi Actor Multi Criteria Analysis which is an evaluation tool that explicitly includes the goals and objectives of all stakeholders...|$|E
