2500|$|In the 1920s, the New Negro Movement {{represented}} a [...] "race-conscious, assertive, race-proud" [...] generation of Black Americans who rejected White paternalism and White run Black colleges. The growing prominence of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People, Marcus Garvey's Universal Negro Improvement Association, and the Niagara Movement helped foment Black discontent with prevailing social conditions. Black soldiers, after fighting {{for democracy in}} World War <b>I,</b> <b>returned</b> <b>home</b> and resented the lack of democratic processes afforded them. Increased Black geographic mobility, especially to the North, and better economic opportunities furthered feelings of Black empowerment. Social changes in broader U.S. society also contributed to growing Black self-determination. Throughout the 1920s, the United States experienced what one historian characterized as a, [...] "revolution in morals and manners," [...] especially among both White and Black youth. The religious piety that had long served {{as a basis for}} personal and social customs gave way to motivations for pleasure, wealth, and the nouveau. Emerging technologies such as the automobile, motion pictures, and musical recordings combined with bold new expressions in women's fashion and behavior that seeded growing antagonism toward outdated and overly conservative aspects of life. Improvements in dissemination of news and culture provided many Blacks views of the world outside the South. The rise of Harlem, New York, as the capital of Black America and the flowering of Negro arts, including music and literature, attracted considerable attention among Blacks and Whites. Black advancement on so many different fronts encouraged Black youth to throw off the shackles of compromise and accommodation and boldly assert the rights and privileges promised them as citizens of the United States. There was a White backlash to New Negro movement. Influenced by the proponents of scientific racism and eugenics, many Americans considered Blacks intellectually inferior and resented their growing self-determination and empowerment.|$|E
