50|$|Mitahara is a Sanskrit {{combination}} word, from Mita (मित, moderate) and Ahara (आहार, taking food, diet), {{which together}} mean moderate diet. In Yoga and other ancient texts, {{it represents a}} concept linking nutrition {{to the health of}} one’s body and mind. It is considered a yamas or self-restraint virtue in some schools of Indian traditions, where one refrains from either <b>eating</b> <b>too</b> much or <b>eating</b> <b>too</b> little quantity of food, and where one refrains from either <b>eating</b> <b>too</b> much or too little of certain qualities of food. Mitahara is synonymous with Mātrāśin (मात्राशिन्).|$|R
50|$|Mitahara (Sanskrit: मिताहार, Mitāhāra) means {{moderation}} in food (light, {{sweet and}} nutritious food), {{and in the}} Yoga tradition, it {{is the concept of}} integrated awareness about food, drink, balanced diet and consumption habits and its effect on one’s body and mind. It is one of the ten Yamas in ancient Indian texts. Mitahara is neither <b>eating</b> <b>too</b> much nor <b>eating</b> <b>too</b> little quantity of food, and self-restraint from either <b>eating</b> <b>too</b> much or too little of certain qualities of food. Verse 1.3 and 1.4 of the Yoga-kundalini Upanishad state that one must eat nourishing and sapient food.|$|R
25|$|Still, {{it may be}} doubted {{whether this}} {{multiplication}} of fast-days can {{be taken as a}} sign of an increased tendency to Asceticism. Probably the theory of Robertson Smith (The Religion of the Semites, p.413) still holds good to a large extent in explanation of many of the fast-observances of later Judaism, as undoubtedly it does for the voluntary and occasional fast-days mentioned in the historical books of the Bible; namely, that Oriental fasting is merely a preparation for the eating of the sacrificial meal. The rabbinical injunction, not to <b>eat</b> <b>too</b> late a meal {{on the eve of the}} Sabbath-day, so as to enjoy all the more that of the Sabbath, tends to corroborate the theory. Perhaps this also underlies the rabbinical report that some examples of rabbinical piety fasted every Friday (in preparation for the Sabbath).|$|E
500|$|The Food Album has {{received}} mixed reviews from most critics; many felt {{that while the}} album was amusing {{it was not an}} essential release.

Just don't <b>eat</b> <b>too</b> much, or you'll probably get sick." [...] Likewise, The Rolling Stone Album Guide awarded the album three out of five stars. Anthony [...] of The Buffalo News gave the album a moderately positive review and wrote that, [...] "here are two kinds of people in the world: those who love Weird Al Yankovic and those who can't stand him. Count me among the Weird One's biggest fans, and that's why I flipped out when listening to The Food Album." [...] He concluded that the album was [...] "like reading Mad magazine"; he gave the record three stars out of five. Tim Grobaty of the Press-Telegram, on the other hand, wrote negatively of the album, stating [...] "Yankovic's songs {{are the kinds of things}} that are sort of funny in concept, less funny when you actually hear them once, and increasingly irritating with each subsequent listen [...] his food songs are among his worst." ...|$|E
