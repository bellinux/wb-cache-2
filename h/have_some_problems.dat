25|$|Because of the {{enormous}} chemical energy in rocket propellants (greater energy by weight than explosives, but lower than gasoline), consequences of accidents can be severe. Most space missions <b>have</b> <b>some</b> <b>problems.</b> In 1986, following the Space Shuttle Challenger disaster, American physicist Richard Feynman, having served on the Rogers Commission estimated that the chance of an unsafe condition for a launch of the Shuttle was very roughly 1%; more recently the historical per person-flight risk in orbital spaceflight has been calculated to be around 2% or 4%.|$|E

During that time, he did <b>have</b> <b>some</b> <b>problems</b> with his brother Vince who was shown displeased with what happened at Cobra Pharmaceuticals and stated that their parents are in doubt about what happened. After Duke saves his parents and reunites with the other Joes, they arrive at the Hauser household where Connie wanted to treat them to a meal. Unfortunately, Vince had called Flint after he had warned Duke to stay away. Duke ends up defending his actions towards the other Joes and tells Flint upon the group's arrest to see that their families are protected.|$|E
25|$|Recent {{research}} suggests that patients with elevated basal levels of CRP are at {{an increased risk of}} diabetes, hypertension and cardiovascular disease. A study of over 700 nurses showed that those in the highest quartile of trans fat consumption had blood levels of CRP that were 73% higher than those in the lowest quartile. Although one group of researchers indicated that CRP may be only a moderate risk factor for cardiovascular disease, this study (known as the Reykjavik Study) was found to <b>have</b> <b>some</b> <b>problems</b> for this type of analysis related to the characteristics of the population studied, and there was an extremely long follow-up time, which may have attenuated the association between CRP and future outcomes. Others have shown that CRP can exacerbate ischemic necrosis in a complement-dependent fashion and that CRP inhibition can be a safe and effective therapy for myocardial and cerebral infarcts; so far, this has been demonstrated in animal models only.|$|E

500|$|Opinions on {{the film}} were mixed in Gulu, one of former centers of rebel {{activities}} in northern Uganda, during a showing of the film, with several of the leaders expressing support and criticism. One of the attendees, State Minister for Foreign Affairs Henry Oryem Okello, said that the criticisms directed at the film and Invisible Children were [...] "unfounded", going on to state, [...] "Invisible Children has done visible things in Acholi, for example offering scholarships to thousands of children and anyone against them is our enemy." [...] Betty Bigombe, a Ugandan cabinet minister and former peace negotiator, said, [...] "I {{do not know whether}} it makes any difference as far as taking [...] out is concerned. However, what is important is bringing this to the attention of policymakers. I hope that something innovative will come out of it." [...] Norbert Mao, Ugandan politician and president of the opposition Democratic Party, stated his support for the film, explaining that while it does <b>have</b> <b>some</b> <b>problems,</b> such as implying Ugandans did not try to fight back against the LRA and not explaining how many of the issues in the film were also exacerbated by the Ugandan government itself, the film is still a [...] "positive development" [...] for the issue, adding that while Invisible Children may not be [...] "the foremost analysts of the complicated political, historical and security dynamics" [...] in the situation, [...] "they have the most beautiful trait on earth -- compassion." ...|$|E
500|$|In an {{interview}} with Greg Hernandez, Mills explained: [...] "I {{knew that she was}} going to be a trouble maker but actually knowing the writers and the producers, I knew that the character would be rounded and have dimension and that was really fun for me to play. It wasn’t one-note all the time, it was a lot of different colors." [...] Television personality Julie Chen said, [...] "The women of Knots, Michele Lee, Joan Van Ark, and Donna Mills have been compared to earth, wind, and fire, with Donna Mills bringing the heat as Abby, the conniving vixen that everybody loved to hate." [...] According to Mills, many people were wary of meeting her in person because they assumed she would be like Abby. She said, [...] "They were very trepedacious about what I was going to do." [...] Mike Celizic of NBC said that her character was [...] "the archetypal predatory female", while Meredith Vieira said [...] "even the bad girl could show a tender side every once in a while", in reference to her daughter's on-screen drug addiction. It was this very storyline that showed Abby at her most vulnerable and human, a story which audiences recall as perhaps one of her most desperate and motherly of moments. In addition to that, Abby also helped Val get her kidnapped babies back, even though she was blamed she said she [...] "could never do a thing like that to anyone". When Karen and Mack began to <b>have</b> <b>some</b> <b>problems</b> in their marriage and Karen distanced herself from Mack, Abby confronted Karen aggressively and told her she was wrong for doing so to him.|$|E

500|$|John Beresford of TV Scoop {{felt that}} [...] "Meat" [...] finally {{provided}} [...] "a {{story that was}} well conceived, realised and paced" [...] opining that at last [...] "Torchwood came of age" [...] {{and that it was}} [...] "easily the best Torchwood story so far." [...] He did <b>have</b> <b>some</b> <b>problems</b> such as [...] "really pathetic alien, the odd off-colour innuendo about alien [...] "meat" [...] and the lazy convenience of the amnesia pills" [...] but felt that these were relatively minor. The strongest points of the episode for him were the acting which he felt to be [...] "uniformly better than usual and on occasion almost incandescent" [...] and the dialogue which was [...] "so natural it didn’t actually sound like [...] "dialogue" [...] at all". Stephen James Walker, in his own analysis of the episode, gave a mostly favourable review. He criticised the alien space whale as the [...] "one less-than-wonderful" [...] aspect of the episode but praised the opening sequence {{and the use of the}} [...] "bleak industrial setting" [...] by director Colin Teague. He felt that the expanded role of Rhys was one of the most pleasing aspects of the scripts and praised the humorous interactions that constituted [...] "male bonding" [...] between him and Jack. He singled out a scene where Gwen turns [...] "a gesture of affection" [...] toward Rhys [...] "into a teasing come-on" [...] to Jack by making eye-contact with the latter whilst kissing the former as characteristic of the [...] "moral ambiguity" [...] which makes her [...] "such a great character". He also felt that whilst they did not have much to do, Tosh, Owen and Ianto had some good scenes which further demonstrated [...] "Tregenna's adeptness at handling the show's regular characters".|$|E
2500|$|Utzon's plywood {{corridor}} designs, and his acoustic and seating {{designs for}} the interior of both major halls, were scrapped completely. His design for the Concert Hall was rejected as it only seated 2000, which was considered insufficient. Utzon employed the acoustic consultant Lothar Cremer, and his {{designs for the}} major halls were later modelled and found to be very good. The subsequent Todd, Hall and Littlemore versions of both major halls <b>have</b> <b>some</b> <b>problems</b> with acoustics, particularly for the performing musicians. The orchestra pit in the Joan Sutherland Theatre is cramped and dangerous to musicians' hearing. The Concert Hall has a very high roof, leading {{to a lack of}} early reflections onstage—perspex rings (the [...] "acoustic clouds") hanging over the stage were added shortly before opening in an (unsuccessful) attempt to address this problem.|$|E
2500|$|In early 1983, Mitchell began a world tour, visiting Japan, Australia, Ireland, the United Kingdom, Belgium, France, Germany, Italy and Scandinavia {{and then}} {{going back to the}} United States. A {{performance}} from the tour was videotaped and later released on home video (and later DVD) as Refuge of the Roads. As 1984 ended, Mitchell was writing new songs, when she received a suggestion from Geffen that perhaps an outside producer with experience in the modern technical arenas that they wanted to explore might be a worthy addition. British synthpop performer and producer Thomas Dolby was brought on board. Of Dolby's role, Mitchell later commented: [...] "I was reluctant when Thomas was suggested because he had been asked to produce the record , and would he consider coming in as just a programmer and a player? So on that level we did <b>have</b> <b>some</b> <b>problems...</b> He may {{be able to do it}} faster. He may be able to do it better, but the fact is that it then wouldn't really be my music." ...|$|E
