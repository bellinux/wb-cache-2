5|$|At the time, {{according}} to German sociologist , Vizzini {{could easily have}} had himself elected as a parliamentary deputy. Nevertheless, he preferred to remain <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>background</b> <b>and</b> instead advise voters and elected officials, {{playing the role of}} benevolent benefactor, strengthening his clientele and prestige. He was present at a dinner in July 1922 with the future ruler of Italy, Benito Mussolini, in Milan and supported the March on Rome by Mussolini in October 1922, financing the column that marched from Sicily.|$|E
5|$|During a video {{interview}} at Gamescom, {{most of the}} setlist was inadvertently leaked because someone was scrolling through the setlist in the background. Harmonix released a video response to the leak the next day, officially denying the rumored setlist, while once again showing the setlist <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>background</b> <b>and</b> confirming additional songs. The full setlist was formally announced on August 25 on the Rock Band website.|$|E
5|$|EastEnders: E20 {{originally}} aired {{as part of}} {{the main}} show's 25th anniversary celebrations. It was devised in a bid to develop and nurture new talent, including writers, actors, composers and remixers, and target a younger audience, as well as to attempt to drive more people onto the Internet. The series was the idea of executive producers Diederick Santer, who wanted a show where regular EastEnders characters would be <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>background,</b> <b>and</b> John Yorke, who wanted to improve the portrayal of teenagers in EastEnders and to get younger people writing for it.|$|E

5|$|In an interview, Auerbach {{confessed that}} he lost {{interest}} in big-time managing in the early 1990s, preferring to stay <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>background</b> <b>and</b> concentrating on his pastimes, racquetball and his beloved cigar-smoking. He would, however, stay on with the Celtics as president until 1997, as vice chairman until 2001, and then became president again, a position he held until his death, although in his final years, he was weakened by heart problems and often used a wheelchair.|$|E
5|$|In {{protest of}} the decision, {{multiple}} photographs of We Are Our Mountains were displayed during {{the presentation of}} voting results from Armenia; one was displayed on a video screen at Yerevan's Republic Square <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>background,</b> <b>and</b> another was displayed {{on the back of}} a clipboard that the presenter Sirusho was reading results from. Despite the controversy, 1,065 Armenians voted for the Azerbaijani entry, enough to give the country a single point. A total of 43 Azerbaijanis voted for the Armenian entry.|$|E
5|$|Masaccio {{is often}} {{compared}} to contemporaries like Donatello and Brunelleschi as {{a pioneer of}} the renaissance, particularly for his use of single-point perspective. One technique that was unique to Masaccio, however, {{was the use of}} atmospheric, or aerial perspective. Both the mountains <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>background,</b> <b>and</b> the figure of Peter on the left are dimmer and paler than the objects in the foreground, creating an illusion of depth. This technique was known in ancient Rome, but was considered lost until reinvented by Masaccio.|$|E

5|$|On October 1, 2009, a New Xbox Experience premium {{theme for}} the game was {{released}} for the Xbox 360.

The PlayStation 3 received a free theme, featuring a Brotherhood of Steel Knight <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>background,</b> <b>and</b> includes symbols from the game as icons on the PS3 home menu. In December 2008 the official editor, known as the G.E.C.K. (Garden of Eden Creation Kit) was made available for the Windows version of the game as a free download from the Fallout 3 website.|$|E
5|$|The {{scenes in}} Calgary were {{actually}} {{shot in the}} back of the Universal Studios lot in Los Angeles.

5|$|Wild Guns is a 1994 space western {{shooting}} gallery video game developed by Natsume for the Super Nintendo Entertainment System. Set in the Wild West with steampunk and sci-fi influences, the story follows Annie and her bounty hunter Clint, seeking revenge {{for the death}} of her family. The player controls either Annie or Clint sidestepping and jumping in the foreground while shooting down enemy robots <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>background</b> <b>and</b> dodging enemy bullets. These gameplay mechanics combine elements from third-person shooters and light gun games.|$|E

5|$|IGN {{wrote that}} the game's story and environments {{remained}} <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>background</b> <b>and</b> were ultimately forgettable, {{or in the case}} of the former, a hindrance, especially when the scenes could not be skipped on later replays. By the same token, predecessors such as Lara Croft Go hid treasures in its background such that players would revisit its levels, but Deus Ex Go had little to interest players besides its primary mission. The game's sole challenge of completing the puzzle in the fewest moves, GameSpot explained, quickly became uninteresting. Gamezebo reviewer instead faulted the series and wrote that after three games, its formula felt repetitive. TouchArcade concluded that, unlike the other Go games, Deus Ex Go was less creative overall and did not subvert the themes of its parent series quite like the others.|$|E
5|$|In 1836 {{architect}} John Harper {{arranged a}} small exhibition in York {{of works by}} modern artists, which included 11 Etty paintings. This included the first public showing of Venus and her Doves, which had been commissioned by Daniel Grant. Although the exhibition broke even it met with little public interest, and no further Etty retrospectives were held for some years. Harper did {{take the opportunity to}} buy Etty's A Family of the Forest (also known as Flowers of the Forest), which had failed to sell at the 1836 Summer Exhibition. A Family of the Forest illustrates a passage from the Ancient Greek poem Theogony, dealing with the Golden Age before humanity suffered pain, misery or the need to work. The setting sun <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>background</b> <b>and</b> the man looking away from the woman and child, and instead into the distance, signify his knowledge that his days of ease are coming to an end.|$|E
5|$|In some rhythm games, {{the screen}} {{displays}} an avatar who performs {{in reaction to}} the player's controller inputs. However, these graphical responses are usually <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>background,</b> <b>and</b> the avatar is more important to spectators than it is to the player. In single-player modes, the player's avatar competes against a computer-controlled opponent, while multiplayer modes allow two player-controlled avatars to compete head-to-head. The popularity of rhythm games has created a market for speciality input devices. These include controllers that emulate musical instruments, such as guitars, drums, or maracas. A dance mat, for use in dancing games, requires the player to step on pressure-sensitive pads. However, most rhythm games also support more conventional input devices, such as control pads.|$|E

5|$|Shantae is a {{platform}} adventure game, in which players play as the eponymous Shantae, a half-genie who must travel across various areas {{in order to}} stop the evil lady pirate Risky Boots. Shantae's default attack involves using her hair like a whip. Shantae can also use gems obtained from defeated enemies to purchase items, such as life-restoring potions and damaging items with various uses, as well as learn upgraded combat moves. The game features five towns, with various areas filled with enemies and obstacles in between them. In order to progress through the game, Shantae must seek out various characters who will open up dungeons, with each dungeon containing a guardian genie that will teach Shantae a new dance. By using these dances, Shantae can transform herself into different animals, including a monkey that can climb on walls, an elephant that can smash objects such as boulders and tree stumps, a spider that can climb across webbing <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>background,</b> <b>and</b> a harpy that can fly in mid-air. Shantae must use these abilities to reach new areas or find hidden items.|$|E
5|$|The Battle of Alexander at Issus {{is painted}} on a limewood panel {{measuring}} , and portrays {{the moment of}} Alexander the Great's victory. The vertical format was dictated by the space available in the room for which the painting was commissioned – each in William's set of eight was made {{to be the same}} size. At an unknown date, the panel was cut down on all sides, particularly at the top, so the sky was originally larger and the moon further from the corner of the scene. The scene is approached from an impossible viewpoint – at first only feet from the fray, the perspective gradually ascends to encompass the seas and continents <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>background</b> <b>and</b> eventually the curvature of the Earth itself.|$|E
5|$|The {{original}} {{concept for}} the episode {{came from a}} story idea by Greg Daniels, and the writing staff came up with three major concepts. The first involves the Simpson family moving out of Springfield, which the writers initially hoped would fool the audience into thinking it was a permanent move. As a result, they tried to work in as many characters as they could during the first act of the episode {{to make it seem}} that the family really was leaving. The second involved Homer getting a new job for an employee-friendly boss in contrast to the tyrannical Mr. Burns. The third was that Homer's new boss would be a supervillain resembling Ernst Stavro Blofeld. This element was meant to be <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>background</b> <b>and</b> Homer would be ignorant to it.|$|E

5|$|Xbox One {{games are}} {{distributed}} at retail on Blu-ray Disc, and digitally as downloads through Xbox Games Store. All Xbox One games must be installed to the console's storage: users {{can begin to}} play portions of a game (such as opening levels) once the installation or download reaches a specific point, while {{the remainder of the}} game is downloaded or installed in the background. Updates to games and system software are also downloaded <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>background</b> <b>and</b> while in standby. If the game is installed from physical media, the disc is still required for validation purposes. If the game is installed on another console, and that console owner no longer has access to the disc, the owner has the option of unlocking the install on their hard drive by purchasing it through Xbox Live; the installed game then acts as a game installed on the hard drive. An active internet connection may be required for some games, particularly those that rely on server-side processing..|$|E
