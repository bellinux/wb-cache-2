The Jurassic Yan’an Formation contains five minable coal seams, the top layer of which is thick, covered by shallow overburden and located under aquifers. Therefore, the mining induced water flowing fractured zone can easily extend to the aquifers of both the Quaternary Sarahu and Jurassic Zhiluo Formation. This would result in a series of negative hydrological and ecological effects, including groundwater leakage, <b>groundwater</b> <b>lowering,</b> furtherly causing surface vegetation withering and dying, surface water body reduction, spring drying out, and water flow of river being decreased substantially. To solve these environmental problems, several technologies have been carried out by Chinese scientists, one of which is water-preserved coal mining.

For several years, the gas flow regime of mineral springs at Bad Brambach (Germany) and mofettes in the Nature Park Soos (Czech Republic) and its dependence on hydro-/meteorological parameters have been studied. The mineral spring ‘Wettinquelle’, Bad Brambach, is a well-known seismo- hydrologically sensitive location for swarmquakes at a special epicentral area of NW Bohemia. Since 2000, a slight upward trend in the gas flow of three Bad Brambach mineral springs has been observed, which became stronger after the ‘Eisenquelle’ spring capture reconstruction (winter 2003 / 2004). Similar behaviour could be detected at a mofette in Soos. The results correspond to a 3 He/ 4 He mantle ratio increase in gases at mofettes in the Cheb Basin (CZ) traced by other authors for more than 12 years, and could give hints for a higher degassing activity of the magma body below that area. Common and special properties in the degassing regimes of the Bad Brambach and Soos locations are discussed. It is demonstrated that the long-term gas flow trend was interrupted in 2003 because of very low groundwater levels.

Insufficient delivery of canal water in comparison to increasing cropping intensities and water demands has lead share of groundwater irrigation to be at par with canal supplies.

Soil improvement and construction of building foundations or embankments can be quite complicated and expensive in such areas. Construction costs need to be balanced against high maintenance costs.

Two different test sites were chosen for back-calculation, a test embankment at Nödinge and a <b>groundwater</b> <b>lowering</b> at Kaserntorget. There was also one hypothetical test site. In this thesis a short description is presented of the fundamental behaviour of soft clays with regard to compressibility as well as a short explanation of the theory for the three different models that has been used within this thesis – Embankco, GS Settlement and the Soft Soil Creep model. Soil parameter determination for long-term settlement analysis is discussed together with some of the inherent complications. For the IL oedometer test the study shows that if the time for the load stage of interest is not sufficiently long the evaluated creep parameter could be misleading. Back-calculation of CRS oedometer tests, using the Soft Soil Creep model, is performed for this model and a procedure is suggested. The outcome of the analysis shows that all three models produce similar results for the hypothetical case. For the two test sites in question, both GS Settlement and the Soft Soil Creep model were capable of predicting the measured settlement with acceptable accuracy.

40|$|In {{the lower}} River Murray in Australia, a {{combination}} of a reduction in the frequency, duration and magnitude of natural floods, rising saline water tables in floodplains, and excessive evapotranspiration have led to an irrigation-induced groundwater mound forcing the naturally saline groundwater onto the floodplain. It is during the attenuation phase of floods that these large salt accumulations are likely to be mobilised and discharged into the river. This has been highlighted as the most significant risk in the Murray–Darling Basin and the South Australian Government and catchment management authorities have subsequently developed salt interception schemes (SIS). The aim of these schemes is to reduce the hydraulic gradient that drives the regional saline groundwater towards the River Murray. This paper investigates the interactions between a river (River Murray in South Australia) and a saline semi-arid floodplain (Clark's floodplain) that is significantly influenced by <b>groundwater</b> <b>lowering</b> due to a particular SIS. The results confirm that groundwater extraction maintains a lower water table and a higher amount of fresh river water flux to the saline floodplain aquifer. In terms of salinity, this may lead to less solute stored in the floodplain aquifer. This occurs through three mechanisms, namely extraction of the solute mass from the system, reducing the saline groundwater flux from the highland to the floodplain and changing the floodplain groundwater regime from a losing to a gaining one. It is shown that groundwater extraction is able to remove some of the solute stored in the unsaturated zone and this can mitigate the floodplain salinity risk. A conceptual model of the impact of groundwater extraction on floodplain salinization has been developed...|$|E

40|$|This Systematic Review aims to {{consider}} the impact {{of changes in the}} ground water table and soil moisture regime on structural stability of buildings and foundation systems. The possible changes in the water table levels and soil moisture conditions are expected as a result of environmental change. Building and infrastructure damage occurs where differential movements exceed the thresholds that the buildings or infrastructure can sustain. At locations where uniform vertical settlement dominates, buildings often move vertically with the subsiding ground surface and little damage occurs. It is when excessive differential deformation occurs that buildings and infrastructure are more prone to damage. A number of criteria for damage risk assessment are described. The expectation is that that settlement (downward movement of the ground surface) will occur during <b>groundwater</b> <b>lowering</b> and heave (upward movement of the ground surface) during groundwater rise. However, no cases of damage due to heave resulting from groundwater level rise per se were found in the literature reviewed. However, there were a significant number of cases of damage due to collapse settlements due to inundation during groundwater level rise. Collapse settlements in fill materials due to rising ground water levels are of major concern in the UK. Capillary rise may occur in soil above the water table. Capillary rise can cause deterioration to structures formed from monumental sandstone through dissolution of cementing minerals reducing the strength of stone and recrystallisation of dissolved salts leading to expansion of the stone. Flooding, where surface water exists above the ground surface, can be one circumstance that can lead to wetting and ground water table rise within the soil. In the first stage of flooding, the building structure is subject to the destructive impacts of water streams. In the aftermath of flooding, when water levels subside, the subsoil remains saturated with water. A further effect of flooding is that of soil erosion and scour which can do significant damage to foundations. Rises in groundwater level, can cause reductions in strength of the soil that can lead to failures of slopes. In regions of significant slope instability, significant damage to buildings can occur as a result of landslides. Lowering of the groundwater table can cause the soil to consolidate, which induces settlement. With softer, more compressible soils, settlements can become large. Many of the cases of damage reported are due to large scale land-surface subsidence induced by ground water abstraction. In some of these examples, the ground surface has fallen by as much as 8 m. Other cases deal with more localised ground water control measures, usually associated with dewatering during construction of a tunnel or deep excavation such as an underground car park or metro station. The evidence suggests that significant consolidation settlements can be induced by <b>groundwater</b> <b>lowering.</b> In soft compressible soils, very large settlements can be induced. Settlements of the order of metres can be induced by large drops in groundwater level (30 + metres). Even land subsidence of less than 1 metre can induce significant damage to buildings. Much of the damage reported that is associated with <b>groundwater</b> <b>lowering</b> occurs in buildings on shallow foundations. However, deep foundations on piles can also be affected. If soil settles relative to the pile, this can result in downdrag on the pile (known as “negative skin friction”). This additional load could potentially overstress the pile and lead to failure. A further particular problem occurs with wooden piles when the groundwater level is lowered. If the water table is lowered, this exposes {{the upper part of the}} pile to aerobic conditions and rotting and decay can start to take place. There are examples of building damage due to rotting of wooden piles Karstic conditions exist in soluble rocks such as limestone and dolomite, where ground water flow causes dissolution of the rock leading to the formation of caverns. Sinkhole formation and ground surface subsidence due to dissolution of soluble rocks is a major cause of damage to buildings in karstic areas. This is often associated with <b>groundwater</b> <b>lowering</b> changing the dynamics of the hydrogeology in calcareous rocks. However, there are examples where damage has resulted from additional flow under high water table conditions, as the greater flow causes more dissolution of the soluble rocks and erosion or removal of clay filling from the fissures. Shrinkage and swelling of clay soils is the single most common cause of foundation-related damage to low-rise buildings in the UK. Vegetation, particularly larger trees, has a significant effect of removing water from the soil and inducing shrinkage. Seasonal shrinkage and swelling will be a major factor of concern if climate change produces drier summers and wetter winters, as predicted for the UK, since greater extremes of wetting and drying will induce greater cycles of swelling and shrinkage. The evidence suggests that shrinkage during periods of drought causes the greatest degree of damage. There is evidence from France that soil conditions are becoming progressively drier and this is consistent with a long-term drying trend predicted for the UK. Peat poses particular geotechnical problems due to its high compressibility. It is made from decaying vegetation and can be very fibrous with a very open, compressible structure. Due it its high compressibility, any changes in stress resulting from groundwater level changes are likely to result in large surface settlement or heave. To be able to assess the future implications of damage to structures due to environmental change it is important to understand the economic cost of damage to buildings due the mechanisms of groundwater level change, shrink/swell etc. The costs of damage due to shrink/swell movements on clay soils have resulted in economic losses of over £ 1. 6 billion in the UK during drought years in the 1990 s. Similar figures are evident from France where losses have been as high as 3. 3 billion Є (£ 2. 7 billion) in a single year. In China, losses due to land subsidence in Shanghai are estimated to be about £ 10 billion over a decade with £ 0. 3 billion a year in losses in three other cities. Consideration has been given by researchers and strategists to the impacts of climate change on the UK built environment and what might be needed for adaption. A consensus is that potential problems to foundations could be addressed through higher specification of foundations, including greater depths for foundations, as well as by new construction methods. It is also possible that higher [increasing] minimum temperatures and fewer cold days could reduce problems associated with frost heave. It may be that an increase in the number of properties suffering damage could result in changes in the perception of the severity of damage and householders may become willing to accept minor levels of damage. Discussions about building performance in New Zealand also lead to the suggestion that risks of future climate change to buildings should be managed and this means that building codes and practices around the world will need to change to suit new climate conditions. However, changing codes and practices requires a good foundation of evidence and research. This is difficult to establish given the uncertainty of current climate change scenarios and their long timescale. There is also an awareness that buildings built now will still be in use in 50 - 100 years time. This produces a need for early action in the construction sector...|$|E
40|$|In the {{beginning}} of the 1980 s the Netherlands has been confronted with its industrial history, due to some cases of severe subsurface contamination. The former gasworks site in the city of Utrecht {{was one of the main}} cases. The surrounding neighborhood had been promised a park, which would be named after the Grift River that flows through the park: The Griftpark. After years of discussion the best approach was chosen, the contamination would be sealed within a 1. 2 kilometer long and 60 meter deep Bentonite wall. This wall had to prevent spreading of contaminated water. The actual park was built on topsoil with clean sand. To guarantee that no contaminated water would flow out of the park, an everlasting, <b>groundwater</b> <b>lowering,</b> pumping scheme was implemented. The extracted water has been brought to its own purification plant ever since. After 15 years of containment of the contaminants in the subsurface within the Bentonite walls and sanitation of the area outside the Bentonite walls, positive signals indicated that an endless solution might be possible. The biological decay goes faster than expected, new research techniques and remediation methods are developed and the environmental policy has changed. This environmental policy gives possibilities in terms of horizontal spreading, but the drinking water regulations regarding the protection of the second aquifer have been tightened. All together the municipality of Utrecht sees enough reasons to investigate whether safe control of the pollution is also possible with less active measures, for example by increasing the self-remediating capacity of the subsurface or to make use of the extracted water. A group of experts has defined a couple of promising scenarios that the municipality of Utrecht would like to research. There are however 2 barriers: 1. The current state of the subsurface pollution within the Bentonite walls is unknown. After 1992 hardly any research has been done and the size and depth of the contamination has not been determined. 2. There is no knowledge about the geohydrological impact of the defined scenarios, a validated model is missing. This research is divided in two: 1. The first part describes the built up and validation of a geohydrological and solute transport model for the Griftpark and the surrounding area. 2. The second part uses the model created as a tool to answer the questions outlined next: a. What soil volume, located within the Bentonite walls, has the highest risk of contaminant spreading towards the second aquifer? b. Which of the scenarios defined by the group of experts has most potential in terms of contamination control and cost/benefit? c. What happens to the fastest spreading, most polluting contaminants within the high risk area in the promising scenarios? Summarized the conclusions are: A. About 1 / 3 th of the total volume of the Griftpark proposes a direct risk to the water in the second aquifer. This area is located around the ‘hole’ in the Kedichem clay layer. This ‘hole’ in the Kedichem clay layer is the main gateway for water flow from the first aquifer to the second aquifer, because the sand that is present instead of the clay, has got a hydraulic conductivity that is almost a 1000 times larger. B. The most promising scenarios are: Scenario 1, an optimized form of the current situation with minimal discharge and only one working pumping well (B 20) can help to reduce the costs and still maintain the controlled situation. This is no finite solution, but reduces the costs significantly, while further research can investigate the other options. Scenario 2, turning off the pumping wells while monitoring the water that flows from the first to the second aquifer can significantly reduce the pumping costs. No contaminated water is allowed to reach the second aquifer, but as long as the monitored water remains clean, it is allowed to spread freely and there is no need to pump it. When contaminated water is observed, the pumping wells have to be turned on again. Scenario 4, the optimized Aquifer Thermal Energy Storage (ATES) system can potentially create benefit by storing heat and in the meantime increase biological degradation. More research is needed to determine whether this measure has potential. It has to be implementable and a useful application of the heat stored has to be present. Scenarios 5 and 6, these scenarios cover part of the Griftpark or the whole Griftpark reducing the amount of infiltration, so less extraction is needed for the current situation to be maintained. C. The amount of spreading and biological degradation is calculated, but the decay constants and retardation factors chosen largely influence the outcome. More research is needed before real conclusions can be drawn...|$|E

Vegetation degeneration {{is related to the}} reduced inflow from the upstream, reduced recharge to riparian <b>groundwater,</b> <b>lowered</b> water table and increased salinity of the groundwater system. Systematic chemical and isotopic sampling of river water and groundwater transects perpendicular to the river show that riparian groundwater is fed by the river. River water picks up salts from the river bed and/or from irrigation returns as it flows downstream, and groundwater from riverbank sediments mirror this pattern. Mineral dissolution and evapotranspiration are the main mechanisms of salt accumulation in groundwater. Reduced recharge from the river has resulted in a distinctive zoning pattern in groundwater salinity. Groundwater residence times derived from tritium contents indicate that the extent of modern recharge (since the 1960 s) is limited to approximately 1500 m from the riverbank {{in the middle}} reaches of the Tarim River. Vegetation grows better in habitats with modern groundwater than in other areas.

Model predictions show that the required ground water table lowering is not economically feasible at present and that any sustained large-scale dewatering scheme will significantly increase lake losses within a period done to two years. It is thus concluded that exploitation of the new lignite-bearing horizons should not reach the karstic marbles at the boundary of the basin, but a zone of the relatively impermeable alluvium should be left to act as a seal. This scheme should be combined with partial <b>lowering</b> of the <b>groundwater</b> table to relieve the hydrostatic pressures on the seal, thus increasing the margin of safety against piping and slope failure...|$|R
30|$|Given the {{relationship}} between the sand content/coarse-grained materials and permeability, higher weightage was given to soils with relatively higher permeability; thus sandy loam units are assigned a weightage factor of 0.48 compared with that of clayey loam with a factor of 0.21 indicating <b>lower</b> <b>groundwater</b> potentials, while loam soils have intermediate value of 0.30 representing moderate groundwater potential.|$|R
30|$|Kelly’s index in {{the present}} study varied as follows: 0.05 – 3.26 for upper {{groundwater}} layer and 0.01 – 261.02 for <b>lower</b> <b>groundwater</b> layer (Table  8). These ranges of values indicate that 53 and 64  % of the groundwater samples are unsuitable for irrigation in respect of the upper and lower layers as presented in Table  9.|$|R
