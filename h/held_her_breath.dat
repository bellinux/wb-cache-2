25|$|In {{the special}} bonus chapter, Lyra {{has a new}} dream. She was in the Town of Wish, her family was calling for her, but Lyra couldn't hear them over the sound of rushing water. Her body became light {{as if she had}} been floating. Lyra <b>held</b> <b>her</b> <b>breath</b> and fell deeper into that strange dream. Once again, she finds herself alone in another unrecognizable place, a small office in the Barge City, and looks for a magic map.|$|E
60|$|M'liss {{moved slowly}} down the staircase, and Clytie from the passage above <b>held</b> <b>her</b> <b>breath.</b>|$|E
60|$|Marguerite {{could not}} see the door; she <b>held</b> <b>her</b> <b>breath,</b> trying to imagine what was happening.|$|E
50|$|And {{when the}} time of labour is come, in the same stoole ought to be put many clothes or crows in the backe of it, the which the midwife may remove {{from one side to}} another, {{according}} as necessity shall require. The Midwife her selfe shall sit before the labouring woman, and shall diligently observe and waite, how much, and after what meanes the child sitrreth itselfe: also shall with hands, first anoynted with the oyle of almonds or the oyle of those white lillies, rule and direct everything as shall seeme best. Also the midwife must instruct and comfort the party, not only refreshing her with good meate and drinke, but also with sweet words, giving her hope of a good speedie deliverance, encouraging and enstomacking her to patience and tolerance, bidding <b>her</b> to <b>held</b> in <b>her</b> <b>breath</b> as much as she may, also stroking gently with her hands her belly about the Navell, for that helpeth to depress the birth downeward.|$|R
60|$|Myra had <b>held</b> <b>her</b> father's {{hand while}} he was speaking; <b>her</b> <b>breath</b> had come fast, {{and her eyes were}} full of tears.|$|R
60|$|He stooped {{down and}} kissed the pale, {{trembling}} lips, and <b>held</b> <b>her</b> hands tightly. <b>Her</b> <b>breath</b> was coming fast, and she spoke with difficulty.|$|R
60|$|The night {{suddenly}} seemed full of movement. She <b>held</b> <b>her</b> <b>breath.</b> Things were passing--one, two, three--subtly sneaking shadows.... Jackals.|$|E
6000|$|She <b>held</b> <b>her</b> <b>breath.</b> She {{recognized}} the voice. She {{had not seen}} him fall. Was he pursuing her there dead, or perhaps [...] . alive? ...|$|E
60|$|A {{light was}} burning there, {{and showed her}} Florence in her bloom of innocence and beauty, fast asleep. Edith <b>held</b> <b>her</b> <b>breath,</b> and felt herself drawn on towards her.|$|E
60|$|And now as Luke de Mountford <b>held</b> <b>her</b> hands, and {{she stood}} close beside him, <b>her</b> <b>breath</b> coming and going in quick gasps, with the {{suppressed}} excitement of latent self-sacrifice, her eyes glowing and tearless, he half slid from the chair on which he was sitting, and one knee was on the ground, and his face turned up to hers.|$|R
6000|$|... "I used {{rather to}} like Solitude--to fancy her a {{somewhat}} quiet and serious, yet fair nymph; an Oread, descending {{to me from}} lone mountain-passes, something of the blue mist of hills in her array and of their chill breeze in <b>her</b> <b>breath,</b> but much also of their solemn beauty in her mien. I once could court her serenely, and imagine my heart easier when I <b>held</b> <b>her</b> to it--all mute, but majestic.|$|R
6000|$|The {{suspense}} was mercifully ended. Lucille Haldane half {{opened her}} eyes, {{and looked up}} at me without recognition, closed them, and caught at <b>her</b> <b>breath</b> audibly, while I <b>held</b> <b>her</b> hands fast in a restraining grasp. Then, as she looked up again, the blood came back, mantling the clear skin, and she said, brokenly: [...] "I fell out of the wagon, did I not? How long have I been here?--and my head is wet. I--I must get up." ...|$|R
60|$|Marguerite <b>held</b> <b>her</b> <b>breath.</b> She felt now as if {{the whole}} {{universe}} must stand still during the next supreme moment, until she had heard what Chauvelin's next words would be.|$|E
60|$|Then she {{wondered}} if her own numbness and despair meant death, and she <b>held</b> <b>her</b> <b>breath</b> to think harder upon it. She concluded at last, grimly, that she didn't care--only for the children.|$|E
6000|$|Their {{friends had}} {{slightly}} separated and now, as Sir Claude spoke, suddenly faced round, showing all the splendour of her ladyship {{and all the}} mystery of her comrade. Maisie <b>held</b> <b>her</b> <b>breath.</b> [...] "They're coming!" ...|$|E
60|$|I {{was running}} on, very fast indeed, when my eyes rested on little Em'ly's face, which was bent forward over the table, {{listening}} with the deepest attention, <b>her</b> <b>breath</b> <b>held,</b> <b>her</b> blue eyes sparkling like jewels, and the colour mantling in her cheeks. She looked so extraordinarily earnest and pretty, that I stopped {{in a sort}} of wonder; and they all observed her at the same time, for as I stopped, they laughed and looked at her.|$|R
60|$|She linked {{her arms}} around his neck; her cheek touched his for a moment, and he was {{surprised}} to find it as hot as fire. He stepped out bravely enough, but with every step {{it seemed to him that}} she was growing heavier. Her hands were still tightly linked around his neck, but her limbs were inert. She seemed to be falling away. He <b>held</b> <b>her</b> tighter, his <b>breath</b> began to grow shorter. The perfume of the clover, fragrant and delicate, grew stronger with every step they took. Somehow he felt that that walk along the narrow path was carving its way into his life. The fingers at the back of his neck were cold, yet she, too, was breathing as though she had been running. Her eyes were half closed. He looked once into her face, bent over her until his lips nearly touched hers. He set his teeth hard. Some instinct warned him of the dangers of the moment. Her stick slipped and a lump arose in his throat. The moment had passed. He kissed her softly upon the forehead.|$|R
60|$|When at {{last she}} {{recovered}} <b>her</b> <b>breath</b> and <b>her</b> life, she got up, and laughing in a queer way, began to put up her hair. She went into the scullery where were the brush and combs, and Emily followed with a candle. When she returned, ordered once more, with a little pallor succeeding the flush, and with a great black stain of sweat on her leathern belt where his hand had <b>held</b> <b>her,</b> {{he looked up at}} her from his position on the sofa, with a peculiar glance of triumph, smiling.|$|R
6000|$|... "I didn't ask him anything. I {{only know}} that {{something}} has happened which has robbed him of his power of thinking [...] . Hadn't I better go to the hut? Don Martin ought to have someone {{with him when he}} wakes up." [...] Mrs. Travers remained perfectly still and even now and then <b>held</b> <b>her</b> <b>breath</b> with a vague fear of hearing those footsteps wandering in the dark. D'Alcacer had disappeared. Again Mrs. Travers <b>held</b> <b>her</b> <b>breath.</b> No. Nothing. Not a sound. Only the night to her eyes seemed to have grown darker. Was that a footstep? [...] "Where could I hide myself?" [...] she thought. But she didn't move.|$|E
60|$|She <b>held</b> <b>her</b> <b>breath</b> to listen--not at all frightened, for {{the sound}} of those footsteps, the {{presence}} of that human creature close by, were in tune with her mood of expectancy of something that was foredoomed to come.|$|E
60|$|These {{appeared}} to be mere steps leading her sight farther and higher to the cloud-navigated sky, where rosy and golden effulgence betokened {{the sun and the}} east. Carley <b>held</b> <b>her</b> <b>breath.</b> A transformation was going on before her eyes.|$|E
60|$|She {{seemed to}} catch <b>her</b> <b>breath.</b> <b>Her</b> voice was still tremulous.|$|R
60|$|The {{next wave}} would have carried her back, but {{she began to}} comprehend, and, {{assisted}} by the yielding sand, <b>held</b> <b>her</b> own and <b>her</b> <b>breath</b> until the under-tow sucked her a few yards seaward; the sand was firmer now; she floated a few yards farther, when her arm was seized; she was conscious of being impelled swiftly through the water, of being dragged out of the surge, of all her back hair coming down, that she had left her boots behind her in the quicksand, that her rescuer was a stranger, and a young man--and then she fainted.|$|R
60|$|She leaned {{forwards}} and upwards {{to pierce}} the darkness; he, also straining to look, felt <b>her</b> <b>breath</b> on his cheek, and turning, saw the pallor {{of her face}} close to his, and felt the dark glow of her eyes. He caught her in his arms, and <b>held</b> <b>her</b> mouth in a kiss. Then, when he released her, he turned away, saying something incoherent about going to fetch the lantern to look. She remained with her back towards me, and pretended to be feeling among the mistletoe for the berries. Soon I saw the swing of the hurricane lamp below.|$|R
60|$|The {{children}} {{crowded around}} Grandfather and looked earnestly into his face. Even little Alice opened her sweet blue eyes, with her lips apart, and almost <b>held</b> <b>her</b> <b>breath</b> to listen; so instinctive is the reverence of childhood {{for the father}} of his country.|$|E
60|$|Grandma Sheldon <b>held</b> <b>her</b> <b>breath</b> {{while she}} looked him over. Was he a pickpocket? He didn't appear like one, {{but you can}} never be sure of the people you meet on the train. Grandma remembered with a sigh of thankfulness that she had no money.|$|E
60|$|Holster {{approached}} him, menacingly, {{until the}} two men stood almost touching, {{and for a moment}} it seemed to Janet as if the agent of the Clarendon were ready to strike Ditmar. She <b>held</b> <b>her</b> <b>breath,</b> her blood ran faster,--the conflict between these two made an elemental appeal.|$|E
60|$|Pand. She's {{making her}} ready; she'll come strait: {{you must be}} witty now!--she does so blush, and fetches <b>her</b> <b>breath</b> so short, {{as if she were}} frighted with a sprite; 'tis the prettiest villain! she fetches <b>her</b> <b>breath</b> so short, as 'twere a new-ta'en sparrow.|$|R
6000|$|The {{logic of}} this theory did not strike Matt, {{but the girl}} <b>held</b> <b>her</b> head in such a strong way, she drew <b>her</b> short <b>breaths</b> with such a smoothness, she so visibly {{concealed}} her anxiety in the resolution to believe herself what she {{said that he could}} not refuse it the tribute of an apparent credence. [...] "Yes, that certainly makes it seem probable." ...|$|R
60|$|It took Mistress Charity {{some little}} time to recover <b>her</b> <b>breath.</b>|$|R
60|$|With that he leveled the rifle, {{resting his}} left elbow on his knee. The {{front end of}} the rifle, {{reaching}} out of the shade, shone silver in the moonlight. Man and weapon became still as stone. Helen <b>held</b> <b>her</b> <b>breath.</b> But Dale relaxed, lowering the barrel.|$|E
60|$|Elizabeth <b>held</b> <b>her</b> <b>breath</b> to listen. It {{was new and}} odd. She did {{not like}} to say Amen; she did not know if the governess were not taking a liberty. Perhaps it was a new way of telling her she was wrong--Christabel, whom she had thought on her side.|$|E
60|$|The {{street was}} empty when she {{inserted}} the little {{key in the}} front door. There was not a soul there to see her step in as it swung open and then softly, noiselessly, but without any conscious effort of hers, closed again behind her. She <b>held</b> <b>her</b> <b>breath</b> and looked around.|$|E
60|$|Miss Pilbeam, only {{daughter}} of Sergeant Pilbeam, caught <b>her</b> <b>breath</b> sharply.|$|R
60|$|She {{leaned forward}} as she spoke, until <b>her</b> <b>breath</b> fanned his face.|$|R
60|$|Virginia drew in <b>her</b> <b>breath,</b> {{and looked}} at the Colonel in amazement.|$|R
