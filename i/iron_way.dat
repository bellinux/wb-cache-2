Across the desolate plain, stripped bare of all vegetation, and made hideous forever by the growth of a mighty industry, where the furnace fires reddened the sky, and only the unbroken line of ceaseless lights showed where town dwindled into village and suburbs led back again into town. An ugly, thickly populated neighborhood, whose area of twinkling lights seemed to reach almost to the murky skies; hideous, indeed by day, not altogether devoid now of a certain weird attractiveness by reason of low-hung stars. On, through many tunnels into the black country itself, where the furnace fires burned oftener, but the signs of habitation were fewer. Down the great <b>iron</b> <b>way</b> the huge locomotive rushed onward, leaping and bounding across the maze of metals, tearing past the dazzling signal lights, through crowded stations where its passing was like the roar of some earth-shaking monster. The station-master at Crewe unhooked his telephone receiver and rang up Liverpool.|$|E

A set of Fe-MFI samples was investigated which differed in the concentration of <b>iron,</b> <b>ways</b> of preparation and activation. Iron species in zeolites do not significantly activate molecular oxygen, as all the investigated zeolites exhibited low activity in the propane oxidation with molecular oxygen. The yield of propene reached a maximum of 2 %. On the other hand, particularly over steamed Fe-zeolites, propane oxidation with nitrous oxide resulted in high propene yields, and formation of propanal and acetone. The reaction pathway. Sites exhibiting acidic properties (Broensted and Lewis sites), if present, yield significant amount of C 4 hydrocarbons and aromates, and {{are responsible for the}} catalysts deactivation by coke. Steam-activated Fe-zeolites exhibited much higher activity than calcined zeolites and a lower rate of deactivation caused by lower concentration of Broensted acid sites. The propene yields range from 10 to 20 % depending on the population of the individual Fe species. We suggest that a part of well-isolated Fe species is extremely active in the propane conversion to propene, whereas there is no evidence for the activity of the oxide-like species...|$|R

5000|$|The double {{meaning of}} this name has long been appreciated: “The proprietors the {{railroad}} have christened it Mazo-Manie, The-Iron-that-Walks, after a somewhat noted Indian chief; and {{as it is the}} offspring of an <b>iron</b> <b>way,</b> the name is not inappropriate.” The actual village of Iron Walker was located near Watertown, about 45 miles to the east. Dodsworth, however, adduces considerations that greatly complicate the eponymy of the present day Mazomanie. The town for some time was known as [...] "Mazo Manie," [...] and recalls in its spelling the name of a pair of Wahpeton Dakota chiefs of that era named Maz-zo-ma-nee. The Dakota (Sioux) language is akin to Winnebago, and it may be immediately appreciated that these names are exactly cognate to one another. Both of the Dakota chiefs were known to H.L.

To mechanism we owe the factories from which we send out our cloths to supply the world's markets; to mechanism we owe that giant power which, with equal facility, propels our ships in the ocean storm, as in the calm waters of our inland rivers. It is mechanism, well arranged and modified, which whirls the traveller along the <b>iron</b> <b>way</b> with an untiring speed which the swiftest race-horse bred by man can never rival; it is mechanism, finely constituted and cunningly devised, which forms the plainly useful {{as well as the}} beautifully elegant of our numerous and varied fabrics; in fact and in short, there is scarcely an article we use but what owes its production to one of the many combinations of mechanism. Nothing to the accomplished mechanician comes amiss; constructing the simple mechanism which effects a single purpose with ease, he as freely masters that which is imitative of operations which, apparently, nothing less than human skill could execute or human brains dictate. No matter what the operation to be effected : let it be complex in its details, to a degree stultifying to an ordinary mind, no sooner is it required than machinery is devised and set to work; and the operation is effected apparently with as much ease as the forms are made which constitute written language by the pen of the ready writer, or the throwing of the shuttle in the weaver's hand-loom." ...|$|E

The {{use of this}} type of cast iron as an engineering material has been increasing day by day ever since its discovery. It is now replacing steel in many important engineering applications. The production of S. G Iron increased to a large extent during last two decades. The excellent combination of mechanical properties obtained in S. G. iron can further be informed by the heat treatment. The most recent development in this regard is the production of Austempered Ductile Iron (ADI). It provides an excellent combination of high tensile strength, wear resistance along with good corrosion resistance and quite significant amount of ductility. Due to these factors, S. G. or ductile iron are austempered when a very favourable combination of various properties is required. But this type of treatment is bit tricky,since it require controlled heating and isothermal holding of the material. So it is necessary to find some attractive methods for property development in S. G. iron. In the present work conventional heat treatment proceeds like annealing, normalizing and tempering of the material has been performed. The mechanical properties obtain by various technique have been compared to one another. In this work two different grades of S. G. Iron (one with copper and another without copper) have been used. The effect of the alloying element (i. e. copper) has also been studied. ...|$|E
