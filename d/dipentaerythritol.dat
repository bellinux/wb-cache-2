Characteristic parameters of these versions were optimized for <b>dipentaerythritol</b> hexapentanoate (DiPECS), <b>dipentaerythritol</b> hexaheptanoate (DiPEC 7), and <b>dipentaerythritol</b> isononanoate (DiPEiC 9), using experimental vapor pressures and densities. With these parameters, compressed densities were predicted. Experimental vapor pressures, determined by a gas saturation apparatus, range between 2 x 10 (- 5) Pa and 16 Pa, whereas the absolute deviations obtained in the correlations for both versions of the model (PC-SAFT and SAFT-VR) are between 10 (- 6) Pa and 1 Pa. In the case of saturated densities, the average absolute deviation (AAD) values, for both models, range from 0. 2 % to 1. 3 %, except for DiPEC 7, where the AAD is 4. 4 % when using the SAFT-VR model.

Polyesters of D,L-lactic acid and glycolic acid, branched using pentaerythritol, <b>dipentaerythritol</b> or tripentaerythritol in different concentrations, plasticized by 30 % trietylcitrate were examined. The theoretical part summarizes the liberation of drugs from different modified drug systems and properties of natural and synthetic degradable polymers. Modified static dissolution test was done at 37 řC using phosphate citrate buffer. The acyclovir was released within 24 hours at the tested carriers branched by <b>dipentaerythritol</b> with low molecular weight. Therefore it is suitable for short-term liberation.

Several pressure-induced phase transitions were detected. Some new information and general conclusions about the structure, chemical bonding and hydrogen bonding in these materials are presented. The high-pressure experimental method was improved. The interactions between dentin, collagen and hydroxyapatite and the dental materials, 2 -hydroxyethylmethacrylate and <b>dipentaerythritol</b> pentaacrylate phosphoric acid ester were explored by FT-IR, FT-Raman and NMR spectroscopy.

40|$|One of {{the most}} common {{polymers}} is polyvinylchloride (PVC), which is on the third place after polyethylene and polypropylene in the world in overall production. High demand for PVC is caused by the possibility of its modification and production of wide range of materials and articles with improved properties as well as by cost-advantageous price – performance ratio, availability of raw materials, saving natural resources. Along with many advantages PVC has a serious drawback: abnormally low stability. The observed thermal aging of PVC begins at 100 оC, especially intensively the polymer decomposes during processing in the range of 160 – 180 оC. Therefore, to obtain high-quality products based on PVC one needs effective stabilization of polymer, that provides high technology in the processing and long service life without deterioration of consumer properties. An effective way to improve the efficiency of stabilizer is to add available, well-known secondary stabilizers, which action mechanisms are different, namely <b>dipentaerythritol</b> (DPET) that acts as an acceptor of HCI, and dinonylphenol (phosphite NF), that inhibits thermal degradation of PVC interaction with unstable carbonrally groups. The paper presents the results of development of complex stabilizer containing not only heat stabilizer and lubricant but also nanoadditives that are secondary stabilizers <b>dipentaerythritol</b> and phosphite NF. The influence of nanoadditives on the technological properties of PVC-materials has been studied. It is shown that the secondary stabilizers can significantly improve the efficiency of multifunctional stabilizer to provide thermal stability and color stability of PVC–compositions for construction purposes.

The 150, 0 mg matrices composed of carrier, Acyclovir of 4 % and plasticizer either TEC of 30 % or EP of 20 % were prepared. They were put to the static dissolution test using phosphate citrate buffer pH 6, 0 at 37 řC. The ACV released was determined spectrophotometricaly at 256 nm. The best release behaviour was found at the carrier 3 M with the linear ACV released during 20 day. Significant acceleration at the 6 th hour going on to the 1 st day was observed...|$|E
40|$|This study {{presents}} the synthesis and physical characterization {{of a series}} of structurally well-defined star-shaped poly(lactic acids). Polymer stars are prepared from a series of multifunctional alcohol cores including flexible polyols pentaerythritol and <b>dipentaerythritol</b> (four-armed and six-armed cores, respectively) and rigid substituted arenes tri(hydroxymethyl) benzene and hexa(hydroxymethyl) benzene. Utilizing a tin(II) octanoate catalyst, arms of 10 monomer units long are built from rac-lactide and l-lactide to form atactic and isotactic star polymers. Polymers were subsequently characterized by means of NMR spectroscopy, gel permeation chromatography, differential scanning calorimetry, and thermogravimetric analysis. Our results support previous work that suggests that the length of the individual arms, not the total molecular weight, correlates to physical characteristics including glass, melt, crystallization, and decomposition temperatures. In addition, differences between core molecules suggest that the chemical nature of the core can significantly alter the physical properties of the star polymer. Trends in crystallization and glass transition temperatures relative to the core used merit further study and correlate closest to the molecular weight and the number of arms emanating from the star core. It is also clear that the rigidity provided by aromatic cores has a significant effect on the melting temperatures of these macromolecules...|$|E
40|$|The aim of {{this paper}} is to prepare and {{characterize}} the free radical photopolymer with carbon black nano-particles. At first, carbon black nano-powder was wetted by the co-solvent composed from propylene glycol mono-methyl ether acetate with normal butyl alcohol lowing surface tension to enhance the permeability of agglomerated carbon black, and then polymeric dispersant was added to stable carbon black nano-particles in liquid after milling process. The dispersed solution was taken out to blend with cresol novolac epoxy acrylate, <b>dipentaerythritol</b> pena-hexa-acrylate, ethanone, 1 -[9 -ethyl- 6 - (2 -methylbenzoyl) - 9 H-carbazole- 3 - 3 -yl]-, 1 -(O-acetyle oxime), and 2 -benzl- 2 -N, N-dimenthylamino- 1 -(4 -morpho-linophenyl) butanone to form the free radical type photosensitive resin with carbon black nano-particles. In order to understand the state of the carbon black nano-particle dispersion in the solution and photosensitive resin, respectively, the dynamic laser light scattering particle analyzer, transmission electron microscopy, Brunauer-Emmett-Teller, and atomic force microscopy were applied. Additionally, polymerizing quantification and lithographic performance of photosensitive resin with carbon black nano-particle were carried out by differential photo calorimeter and wedge curve analysis, respectively, in this study...|$|E
40|$|The PEA {{photopolymer}} {{is composed}} of <b>dipentaerythritol</b> penta/hexa-acrylate as monomer and binder, N-vinyl pirrolidone as crosslinker, ethyl eosin as dye and N-methyl diethanolamine as radical generator. This photopolymer is suitable to work with dispersed liquid crystal molecules in dynamic holographic and diffractive applications. In order to characterize these materials we have analyzed the behaviour of different compositions at zero spatial frequency limit. This method {{is based on an}} interferometer that has been successfully applied in the phase-shift versus applied voltage characterization of liquid-crystal displays, in addition to that it has been applied to characterize PVA/AA and PVA/NaAO photopolymers. In PEA case there is no shrinkage since the photopolymer is coverplated. Samples have a glass substrate as the cover plate. In our analysis we have studied the importance of the monomer, crosslinker and crystal liquid molecules concentrations, in the phase shift produced in the layer during photopolymerization process.

40|$|Lenka veselá Diploma theses 2008 There are {{summarized}} the basic theories and mechanisms of bioadhesion, the factors influencing bioadhesion, the bioadhesive polymers {{and the most}} common methods of bioadhesive testing in vitro in the theoretic part of this thesis. There were measured the dynamic viscosity of plasticized polymers of D, L- lactic and glykolic acid branched with mannitol (M) or <b>dipentaerythritol</b> (D) in the concentration of 3 %, 5 % and 8 % in the experimental part of this thesis. Like plasticizer there was used methylester of salicylic acid (MS) in the concentration of 10 - 50 %. The dynamic viscosity was measured on the digital viscometer Brookfield DV-E with the adapter for small volume of samples and there was used the spindle No. 15. The samples were heated up 40 řC. There was found, that applies by all tested plasticized carriers with different type and concentration of branching component, that the viscosity falls with increasing concentration of plasticizer. The viscosity falls by one rank with increasing concentration of plasticizer by 10 %. The viscosity of branched polymers is also influenced by the molecular weight {{and the degree of}} branching. There was found, that oligoesters with higher molecular weight and with lower degree of branching have higher viscosity. If there is the [...] ...|$|E

Petra Dvořáková SUMMARY The {{aim of this}} thesis was the study of adhesive {{properties of}} branched terpolymers of D,L-lactic acid, glycolic acid and <b>dipentaerythritol,</b> and release of fluconazole and aciclovir from these carriers. All tested carriers were plasticized with 30 % of triethyl citrate (TEC). In the theoretical part of this thesis mechanisms of bioadhesion, biological substrates, polymers used in drug delivery systems and mechanisms of drug release are described. In the experimental part adhesivity of plasticized oligoesters was measured. Hydrated mucin isolated from porcine stomach {{was used as a}} model substrate for bioadhesion. The rate of adhesivity is the maximal force Fmax [N], which is required for the detachment of tested samples from the substrate. This force was related {{to the size of the}} contact surface and expressed in units mN/mm 2. The highest adhesivity was measured in oligoesters labelled 5 D and 8 D, which had low dynamic viscosity. However, it is impossible to state linear relationship between adhesivity and dynamic viscosity. The release of [...] ...|$|E
40|$|Hlavsová, L. : Branched oligoesters {{plasticized}} using methylsalicylate as {{carriers of}} drugs Summary The {{aim of this}} work was to study acyclovir release from plasticized oligoester matrices. Tested matrices are branched terpolymers of D,L-lactic acid, glycolic acid and mannitol or <b>dipentaerythritol.</b> Carriers were plasticized using 10 %, 20 % or 30 % of methyl salicylate. Theoretical part is concerned with synthesis, degradation and application of polyesters, drug release from polymers, infections caused by herpetic viruses and antivirotics. Within the experimental part of this work 150, 0 mg matrices by method of melting of carriers together with plasticizer at temperature less than 80 řC was prepared. In addition to matrices with drug the matrices without drug (placebo) were prepared. The static dissolution test was done using phosphate citric buffer pH 6, 0 at temperature of 37 řC. The absorbation of the dissolution liquid at given intervals was measured at wave length 256 nm against both the buffer and placebo dissolution liquid. Drug release was influenced first of all by the properties of oligoester carrier, minor by plasticizer concentration in matrices. The elution of the methyl salicylate was arisen {{at the beginning of}} the dissolution, so there is no plasticizer in the system in the later phases of the [...] ...|$|E
