5|$|Apart {{from the}} {{exchange}} {{project of the}} late 1980s, activity to export the Finnhorse has been minimal. However, a 2008 study stated that increased international interest and <b>demand</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> Finnhorse was advisable to ensure {{the survival of the}} breed. To this end, the objectives of the national breeding program, as of 2008, include increasing international recognition of the Finnhorse and generating <b>demand</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> breed for recreational and educational uses such as in Pony Club; to make it the standard breed used in Finland for equestrian tourism; and to improve the opportunities for Finnhorse trotters to participate in Swedish and Norwegian heats.|$|E

5|$|Mustering is a {{labour-intensive}} {{process that}} results {{in one of two}} major outcomes: slaughter for sale, or relocation.

40|$|An {{analysis}} {{of the structure of}} demand was performed on household data classified into income groups for urban Indonesia. A demographically augmented Linearized Almost Ideal Demand System was used to estimate the structural parameters of the demand equations. Endogenous switching regression techniques yielded unbiased and consistent <b>demand</b> parameter estimates <b>for</b> <b>the</b> low income group, which had a large number of zeros for some food groups. Standard, seemingly unrelated, equation techniques were used to estimate <b>the</b> <b>demand</b> parameters <b>for</b> <b>the</b> other income groups. <b>The</b> results showed <b>demands</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> medium-high and high income households to be responsive to prices, income and demographic variables. <b>Demands</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> medium-low income households were responsive to income and prices only. <b>Demands</b> <b>for</b> low income households were responsive to income and prices of rice and fish only...|$|R

The Dirty Dancing album spent 18weeks at numberone on the Billboard 200 album sales charts and went {{platinum}} eleven times, selling more than 32 million copies worldwide. It spawned a follow-up multi-platinum album in February 1988, entitled More Dirty Dancing.|$|E
5|$|A {{period of}} {{national}} prosperity followed {{the end of}} the War of 1812. In Kentucky, rapid population growth and strong <b>demand</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> state's goods led to land speculation becoming a popular enterprise. The charter of the Kentucky Insurance Company in 1802 and the Bank of Kentucky in 1806 made currency for loans plentiful. The establishment of branches of the Second Bank of the United States in Louisville and Lexington further augmented the availability of credit. In 1818, the General Assembly chartered 40 more state banks, and later added six more.|$|E

5|$|After {{the end of}} the war Norsk Hydro had {{a strong}} liquidity, while the Green Revolution and {{increased}} industrialization of agriculture in Europe boomed the <b>demand</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> products; from 1945 to 1955 production increased eightfold. The increased transport was a heavy burden on the two steamships, and in 1953 Norsk Transport ordered MF Storegut, a diesel powered ship of 1119 gross tonnes. She was launched on 25 May 1956, and the two older ferries were put to reserve duty in the meantime. A number of upgrades were made to the line, and the two locomotives 9 and 10 were bought in 1958. This was followed by the three diesel locomotives 20, 21 and 22 from Henschel. In 1966 two NSB El 1 locomotives were bought, and the voltage on the line increased from 10 to 15 kV.|$|E
5|$|Although {{working within}} the Neo-Gothic school of design, they {{differed}} from Neo-Gothic architects like Gilbert Scott who simply included certain Gothic features on modern styles of building; instead they sought to return completely to Medieval Gothic methods of craftmanship. The products created by the Firm included furniture, architectural carving, metalwork, stained glass windows, and murals. Their stained glass windows proved a particular success in the firm's early years {{as they were in}} high <b>demand</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> surge in the Neo-Gothic construction and refurbishment of churches, many of which were commissioned by the architect George Frederick Bodley. Despite Morris's anti-elitist ethos, the Firm soon became increasingly popular and fashionable with the bourgeoisie, particularly following their exhibit at the 1862 International Exhibition in South Kensington, where they received press attention and medals of commendation. However, they faced much opposition from established design companies, particularly those belonging to the Neo-Classical school.|$|E
5|$|As Schwarzenegger only {{signed on}} for the film in February and the film was shot so quickly, only {{six and a half}} months were {{available}} for merchandising, instead of the ideal year. As such, merchandising was limited to a 13.5 inch replica $25 Talking Turbo-Man action figure and the West Coast exclusive Turbo-Man Time Racer vehicle, while no tie-in promotions could be secured. Despite this, several critics wrote that the film was only being made in order to sell the toy. Columbus dismissed this notion, stating that with only roughly 200,000 Turbo-Man toys being made, the merchandising was far less than the year's other releases, such as Space Jam and 101 Dalmatians. The film's release coincided with the Tickle Me Elmo craze, in which high <b>demand</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> doll during the 1996 Christmas season lead to store mobbing similar to that depicted for Turbo-Man.|$|E
