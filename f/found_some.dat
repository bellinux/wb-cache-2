The discovery offers hope of a possible pathway to effective treatment in humans.|$|E
5|$|Mites of {{the genus}} Ptilonyssus, such as P. sittae, {{have been found in}} the Eurasian nuthatch's nasal cavities. Intestinal worms include the {{nematodes}} Tridentocapillaria parusi and Pterothominx longifilla. Small studies in Slovakia and Spain found no blood parasites, but a larger Spanish survey <b>found</b> <b>some</b> evidence of Plasmodium infection.|$|E
5|$|Recent {{studies have}} <b>found</b> <b>some</b> {{traditional}} Russulaceae species to comprise several cryptic species (see Systematics and taxonomy: Species diversity).

5|$|A {{study of}} central bank {{interventions}} on the US dollar and Deutsche mark found only limited {{evidence of any}} substantial effect on deviations from UIRP. UIRP {{has been found to}} hold over very small spans of time (covering only a number of hours) with a high frequency of bilateral exchange rate data. Tests of UIRP for economies experiencing institutional regime changes, using monthly exchange rate data for the US dollar versus the Deutsche mark and the Spanish peseta versus the British pound, have <b>found</b> <b>some</b> evidence that UIRP held when US and German regime changes were volatile, and held between Spain and the United Kingdom particularly after Spain joined the European Union in 1986 and began liberalizing capital mobility.|$|E

5|$|All I Want Is You was {{eventually}} released on November 30, 2010, selling poorly at first. With {{the help of}} its subsequent singles, the album became sleeper hit on the Billboard 200 and sold 404,000 copies by September 2012. It also received positive reviews; critics <b>found</b> <b>some</b> of the music inconsistent but praised Miguel's singing/songwriting abilities while drawing comparisons to American recording artist Prince. Miguel toured in promotion of the album as a supporting act for the singers Usher and Trey Songz.|$|E
5|$|Ann is <b>found</b> <b>some</b> {{time later}} by the police, {{clutching}} Miles's dead body, but she refuses to speak of what happened until meeting Dr Fisher. He seems to accept Ann's story, unconvinced by his own psychosexual explanations of her visions. Fisher is dismayed to see Ann led away by the police, accused of Miles's murder, and he sees Quint's face {{on one of the}} officers. The film closes with a new governess arriving at Bly.|$|E
5|$|As for Casler's third {{possible}} explanation for nominative determinism, genetics, researchers Voracek, Rieder, Stieger, and Swami <b>found</b> <b>some</b> evidence for it in 2015. They reported that today's Smiths still tend to have the physical capabilities of their ancestors who were smiths. People called Smith reported above-average aptitude for strength-related activities. A similar aptitude for dexterity-related activities among people with the surname Tailor, or equivalent spellings thereof, was found, {{but it was not}} statistically significant. In the researchers' view a genetic-social hypothesis appears more viable than the hypothesis of implicit egotism effects.|$|E

5|$|Discovered in 1834 by Johann Friedrich Engelhardt and {{described}} {{three years later}} by Hermann von Meyer, Plateosaurus was the fifth named dinosaur genus that is still considered valid. Although it had been described before Richard Owen formally named Dinosauria in 1842, it {{was not one of}} the three genera used by Owen to define the group, because at the time, it was poorly known and difficult to identify as a dinosaur. It is now among the dinosaurs best known to science: over 100 skeletons have been <b>found,</b> <b>some</b> of them nearly complete. The abundance of its fossils in Swabia, Germany, has led to the nickname Schwäbischer Lindwurm (Swabian lindworm).|$|E
5|$|Elements of {{the game}} were criticized. Sullivan <b>found</b> <b>some</b> side {{missions}} repetitive, and Sliwinski was disappointed {{with some of the}} boss battles. Miller wrote that some Shadow of Mordor features are too complex and inaccessible for new players or those unwilling to use strategy. Critics disagreed about the Nemesis system. Miller wrote that the system fell flat in the game's final hours; according to VanOrd, the system was unappealing until the game's second half. Carter found the unskippable cutscenes after a player died annoying.|$|E
5|$|In his 1918 {{revision}} of North American Oryzomys, Goldman considered O.nelsoni {{to be most}} {{closely related to the}} nearest mainland subspecies of O.couesi, O.couesi mexicanus. In 2009, Michael Carleton and Joaquin Arroyo-Cabrales revised the Oryzomys of western Mexico and confirmed that O.nelsoni is a very distinct species. Their morphometrical analysis <b>found</b> <b>some</b> resemblance between the species and Oryzomys albiventer of interior mainland Mexico, and they suggested that although O.nelsoni likely represents an old, distinctive lineage, it may have derived from a common ancestor with O.albiventer.|$|E

5|$|In the 1980s, {{the country}} music charts were {{dominated}} by pop singers with only tangential influences from country music, a trend that has continued since. The 1980s saw a revival of honky-tonk-style country {{with the rise of}} people like Dwight Yoakam and the new traditionalists Emmylou Harris and Ricky Skaggs, as well as the development of alternative country performers like Uncle Tupelo. Later alternative country performers, like Whiskeytown's Ryan Adams and Wilco, <b>found</b> <b>some</b> mainstream success.|$|E
5|$|Invalided out {{of service}} in June 1941, Bradman spent months recuperating, unable even to shave himself or comb his hair due {{to the extent of}} the muscular pain he suffered. He resumed {{stockbroking}} during 1942. In his biography of Bradman, Charles Williams expounded the theory that the physical problems were psychosomatic, induced by stress and possibly depression; Bradman read the book's manuscript and did not disagree. Had any cricket been played at this time, he would not have been available. Although he <b>found</b> <b>some</b> relief in 1945 when referred to the Melbourne masseur Ern Saunders, Bradman permanently lost the feeling in the thumb and index finger of his (dominant) right hand.|$|E

On January 23, Manning flew to the United States via Germany, for two weeks of leave. It was during this visit that she first went out dressed as a woman, wearing a wig and makeup. After her arrest, her former partner, Tyler Watkins, told Wired that Manning had said during the visit that she had <b>found</b> <b>some</b> sensitive information and was considering leaking it.|$|E

5|$|Much of the {{research}} into the properties of neptunium since then {{has been focused on}} understanding how to confine it as a portion of nuclear waste. Because it has isotopes with very long half-lives, it is of particular concern in the context of designing confinement facilities that can last for thousands of years. It has <b>found</b> <b>some</b> limited uses as a radioactive tracer and a precursor for various nuclear reactions to produce useful plutonium isotopes. However, most of the neptunium that is produced as a reaction byproduct in nuclear power stations {{is considered to be a}} waste product.|$|E
5|$|Octavarium {{peaked in}} the top five in the Finnish, Italian, and Swedish charts, and {{in the top}} ten in the Dutch, Japanese, and Norwegian charts. Critical {{reception}} of the album was generally positive; the diversity of the music was praised, although critics <b>found</b> <b>some</b> of the songwriting to be inconsistent. Dream Theater promoted the album on a year-long world tour, with the majority of concerts lasting almost three hours and featuring a different setlist each night. The tour finished at Radio City Music Hall accompanied by an orchestra; this performance was recorded and released as a live album and concert video entitled Score. They co-headlined the 2005 North American Gigantour with Megadeth.|$|E
