50|$|Each yacht fell {{within a}} Class based upon its {{measured}} tonnage. In the early 19th century four ranges of tonnage and hence four Classes were defined. Based on experience {{gained from the}} results of numerous races each Class was allocated a <b>distance</b> <b>allowance</b> that the Class had to give away to the next lower Class. This was equivalent to a Class 1 having to sail more distance than a Class 4 yacht during a race.|$|E
40|$|Study objective: We seek to {{determine}} whether patients living in areas affected by emergency department (ED) closure, with subsequent increased distance to the nearest ED, have {{a higher risk of}} inpatient death from time-sensitive conditions. Methods: Using the California Office of Statewide Health and Planning Development database, we performed a nonconcurrent cohort study of hospital admissions in California between 1999 and 2009 for patients admitted for acute myocardial infarction, stroke, sepsis and asthma or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. We used generalized linear mixed-effects models comparing adjusted inpatient mortality for patients experiencing increased distance to the nearest ED versus no change in distance. Results: Of 785, 385 patient admissions, 67, 577 (8. 6 %) experienced an increase in distance to ED care because of an ED closure. The median change for patients experiencing an increase in distance to the nearest ED was only 0. 8 miles, with a range of 0. 1 to 33. 4 miles. Patients with an increase did not have a significantly higher mortality (adjusted odds ratio 1. 04; 95 % confidence interval 0. 99 to 1. 09). In subgroups, we also observed no statistically significant differences in adjusted mortality among patients with acute myocardial infarction, stroke, asthma or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, and sepsis. We did not observe any significant variations in mortality for time-sensitive conditions in sensitivity analyses that incorporated a lag effect of time after change in <b>distance,</b> <b>allowance</b> for a larger affected population, or removal of ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction from the acute myocardial infarction subgroup. Conclusion: In this large population-based sample, less than 10 % of the patients experienced an increase in distance to the nearest ED, and of that group, the majority had less than a 1 -mile increase. These small increased distances to the nearest ED were not associated with higher inpatient mortality among time-sensitive conditions.

40|$|Among {{the phases}} of flight {{operations}} pilots feel much pressure in landing segment. There {{is a number}} of factors affecting landing safety while pilots reduce aircraft speeds and make a touchdown and stop completely. If runway length is sufficient for landing, there maybe is no problem. But it is not the case all the time. So it is necessary to confirm whether landing performance is within limits or not. Required landing distance is actual landing distance demonstrated by flight test pilot plus allowances for average airline pilots. FAR(Federal Aviation Regulations) AFM certification is based upon manual landing for dry and wet runway. Other runway conditions are not the certification basis. JAR dictates even contaminated/slippery runway is included by prescribed allowances. Automatic landing is not certification basis, so actual landing distances are provided. In this paper I would like to analyze <b>distance</b> <b>allowances</b> included in each type of runway condition. In addition there is no regulation about allowances for specific runway condition, I would suggest adequat...|$|R
5000|$|Verrazano was unraced as a two-year-old, {{making his}} racecourse debut on January 1, 2013, in a Maiden Special Weight over {{six and a}} half furlongs at Gulfstream Park. Ridden as in all his races by the Puerto Rican-born Hall of Fame jockey John Velazquez, he took the lead in the {{straight}} and drew away from his ten opponents to win by seven and three-quarter lengths in a time of 1:16.48. A month later at the same course, Verrazano was moved up in <b>distance</b> for an <b>allowance</b> race over one mile and started the 1/5 favourite. Taking the lead on the final turn, he increased his lead throughout the closing stages to win by sixteen lengths in a time of 1:34.8, just over a second outside Commentator's track record. The Blood-Horse described the performance as a [...] "spectacular" [...] one which established Verrazano as a Kentucky Derby prospect. Following the race a half share in the colt was bought for an undisclosed sum by the Coolmore organisation, represented by Michael Tabor, Susan Magnier and Derrick Smith. Verrazano remained in Florida for his next race on March 9, when he was stepped up in class and distance to contest the Grade II Tampa Bay Derby over one and one sixteenth miles. Starting the 2/5 favourite, he bobbled leaving the starting gate but recovered quickly and took the lead after three furlongs. He was never seriously challenged and won by three lengths [...] "with a bit in reserve". After the race, Pletcher said: [...] "It was a good performance. He is a lot like his sire; he has a great disposition and a great mind... he is so naturally fast for a big horse".|$|R
