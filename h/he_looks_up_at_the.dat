6000|$|HE, sinking {{mechanically}} {{into the}} chair she indicates: [...] "Oh, just as you like!" [...] <b>He</b> <b>looks</b> <b>up</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> ceiling in hopeless bewilderment, while she writes.|$|E
60|$|Mr. George is mightily curious {{in respect}} of the room. <b>He</b> <b>looks</b> <b>up</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> painted ceiling, looks round at the old law-books, contemplates the portraits of the great clients, reads aloud {{the names on the}} boxes.|$|E
6000|$|Well, sir, that fairly {{made them}} shout; {{and even the}} judge he let go and laughed. Tom he was just feeling like a rainbow. When they was done {{laughing}} <b>he</b> <b>looks</b> <b>up</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> judge and says: ...|$|E
60|$|<b>He</b> <b>looked</b> <b>up</b> <b>at</b> her, the slow, derisive smile curling his lips.|$|R
60|$|<b>He</b> <b>looked</b> <b>up</b> <b>at</b> her sharply. She nodded slowly, like a {{porcelain}} mandarin.|$|R
60|$|<b>He</b> <b>looked</b> <b>up</b> <b>at</b> {{the moving}} cloud, which was fringed with ragged streamers.|$|R
6000|$|... "Good, bad, or indifferent," [...] she said, [...] "the pupil's {{sketches}} {{must pass}} through the fiery ordeal of the master's judgment--and there's an end of it. Suppose we take them {{with us in the}} carriage, Laura, and let Mr. Hartright see them, for the first time, under circumstances of perpetual jolting and interruption? If we can only confuse him all through the drive, between Nature as it is, when <b>he</b> <b>looks</b> <b>up</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> view, and Nature as it is not when he looks down again at our sketch-books, we shall drive him into the last desperate refuge of paying us compliments, and shall slip through his professional fingers with our pet feathers of vanity all unruffled." ...|$|E
60|$|Forth, in a barouche, ride Mr Dombey, Major Bagstock, and Mr Carker, to the church. Mr Sownds the Beadle {{has long}} {{risen from the}} steps, and is in waiting with his cocked hat in his hand. Mrs Miff curtseys and proposes chairs in the vestry. Mr Dombey prefers {{remaining}} in the church. As <b>he</b> <b>looks</b> <b>up</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> organ, Miss Tox in the gallery shrinks behind the fat leg of a cherubim on a monument, with cheeks like a young Wind. Captain Cuttle, on the contrary, stands up and waves his hook, in token of welcome and encouragement. Mr Toots informs the Chicken, behind his hand, that the middle gentleman, he in the fawn-coloured pantaloons, {{is the father of}} his love. The Chicken hoarsely whispers Mr Toots that he's as stiff a cove as ever he see, but that it is within the resources of Science to double him up, with one blow in the waistcoat.|$|E
6000|$|... § LXIII. But of {{all these}} {{branches}} the most important are the inlaying and mosaic of the twelfth and thirteenth centuries, represented in a central manner by these mosaics of St. Mark's. Missal-painting could not, from its minuteness, produce the same sublime impressions, and frequently merged itself in mere ornamentation of the page. Modern book-illustration has been so little skilful as hardly to be worth naming. Sculpture, though in some positions it becomes of great importance, has always a tendency to lose itself in architectural effect; and was probably seldom deciphered, in all its parts, by the common people, still less the traditions annealed in the purple burning of the painted window. Finally, tempera pictures and frescoes were often of limited size or of feeble color. But the great mosaics of the twelfth and thirteenth centuries covered the walls and roofs of the churches with inevitable lustre; {{they could not be}} ignored or escaped from; their size rendered them majestic, their distance mysterious, their color attractive. They did not pass into confused or inferior decorations; neither were they adorned with any evidences of skill or science, such as might withdraw the attention from their subjects. They were before the eyes of the devotee at every interval of his worship; vast shadowings forth of scenes to whose realization he looked forward, or of spirits whose presence he invoked. And the man must be little capable of receiving a religious impression of any kind, who, to this day, does not acknowledge some feeling of awe, as <b>he</b> <b>looks</b> <b>up</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> pale countenances and ghastly forms which haunt the dark roofs of the Baptisteries of Parma and Florence, or remains altogether untouched by the majesty of the colossal images of apostles, and of Him who sent apostles, that look down from the darkening gold of the domes of Venice and Pisa.|$|E
60|$|Then <b>he</b> <b>looked</b> <b>up</b> <b>at</b> me again, {{and swore}} {{one of his}} great oaths.|$|R
60|$|<b>He</b> <b>looked</b> <b>up</b> <b>at</b> {{his friend}} and {{secretary}} in an amazement that overcame his shame.|$|R
60|$|And then {{a thought}} raced along Stephen's mind and <b>he</b> <b>looked</b> <b>up</b> <b>at</b> his friend.|$|R
60|$|First {{comes the}} {{ancestor}} himself, {{in his black}} cloak, steeple-hat, and trunk-breeches, girt about the waist with a leathern belt, in which hangs his steel-hilted sword; he has a long staff in his hand, such as gentlemen in advanced life used to carry, {{as much for the}} dignity of the thing as for the support to be derived from it. <b>He</b> <b>looks</b> <b>up</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> portrait; a thing of no substance, gazing at its own painted image! All is safe. The picture is still there. The purpose of his brain has been kept sacred thus long after the man himself has sprouted up in graveyard grass. See! he lifts his ineffectual hand, and tries the frame. All safe! But is that a smile?--is it not, rather a frown of deadly import, that darkens over the shadow of his features? The stout Colonel is dissatisfied! So decided is his look of discontent as to impart additional distinctness to his features; through which, nevertheless, the moonlight passes, and flickers on the wall beyond. Something has strangely vexed the ancestor! With a grim shake of the head, he turns away. Here come other Pyncheons, the whole tribe, in their half a dozen generations, jostling and elbowing one another, to reach the picture. We behold aged men and grandames, a clergyman with the Puritanic stiffness still in his garb and mien, and a red-coated officer of the old French war; and there comes the shop-keeping Pyncheon of a century ago, with the ruffles turned back from his wrists; and there the periwigged and brocaded gentleman of the artist's legend, with the beautiful and pensive Alice, who brings no pride out of her virgin grave. All try the picture-frame. What do these ghostly people seek? A mother lifts her child, that his little hands may touch it! There is evidently a mystery about the picture, that perplexes these poor Pyncheons when they ought to be at rest. In a corner, meanwhile, stands the figure of an elderly man, in a leathern jerkin and breeches, with a carpenter's rule sticking out of his side pocket; he points his finger at the bearded Colonel and his descendants, nodding, jeering, mocking, and finally bursting into obstreperous, though inaudible laughter.|$|E
6000|$|The small houses {{which were}} {{scattered}} {{along the river}} at intervals of a mile or more were commonly out of sight to us, but sometimes, when we rowed near the shore, we heard the peevish note of a hen, or some slight domestic sound, which betrayed them. The lock-men's houses were particularly well placed, retired, and high, always at falls or rapids, and commanding the pleasantest reaches of the river,--for it is generally wider and more lake-like just above a fall,--and there they wait for boats. These humble dwellings, homely and sincere, in which a hearth was still the essential part, were more pleasing to our eyes than palaces or castles would have been. In the noon of these days, as we have said, we occasionally climbed the banks and approached these houses, to get {{a glass of water}} and make acquaintance with their inhabitants. High in the leafy bank, surrounded commonly by a small patch of corn and beans, squashes and melons, with sometimes a graceful hop-yard on one side, and some running vine over the windows, they appeared like beehives set to gather honey for a summer. I have not read of any Arcadian life which surpasses the actual luxury and serenity of these New England dwellings. For the outward gilding, at least, the age is golden enough. As you approach the sunny doorway, awakening the echoes by your steps, still no sound from these barracks of repose, and you fear that the gentlest knock may seem rude to the Oriental dreamers. The door is opened, perchance, by some Yankee-Hindoo woman, whose small-voiced but sincere hospitality, out of the bottomless depths of a quiet nature, has travelled quite round to the opposite side, and fears only to obtrude its kindness. You step over the white-scoured floor to the bright [...] "dresser" [...] lightly, as if afraid to disturb the devotions of the household,--for Oriental dynasties appear to have passed away since the dinner-table was last spread here,--and thence to the frequented curb, where you see your long-forgotten, unshaven face at the bottom, in juxtaposition with new-made butter and the trout in the well. [...] "Perhaps you would like some molasses and ginger," [...] suggests the faint noon voice. Sometimes there sits the brother who follows the sea, their representative man; who knows only how far it is to the nearest port, no more distances, all the rest is sea and distant capes,--patting the dog, or dandling the kitten in arms that were stretched by the cable and the oar, pulling against Boreas or the trade-winds. <b>He</b> <b>looks</b> <b>up</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> stranger, half pleased, half astonished, with a mariner's eye, {{as if he were a}} dolphin within cast. If men will believe it, sua si bona norint, there are no more quiet Tempes, nor more poetic and Arcadian lives, than may be lived in these New England dwellings. We thought that the employment of their inhabitants by day would be to tend the flowers and herds, and at night, like the shepherds of old, to cluster and give names to the stars from the river banks.|$|E
50|$|As the Inquisitor {{leaves the}} trial room, she gives {{instructions}} to the Keeper of the Matrix. As <b>he</b> <b>looks</b> <b>up</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> camera, he is revealed to be the Valeyard.|$|E
60|$|<b>He</b> <b>looked</b> <b>up</b> <b>at</b> {{her sitting}} her great black horse beside {{which he had}} been pacing.|$|R
60|$|<b>He</b> <b>looked</b> <b>up</b> <b>at</b> her, and {{the ghost}} of an unholy smile flickered upon his lips.|$|R
60|$|<b>He</b> <b>looked</b> <b>up</b> <b>at</b> the house, and saw Carmina at {{the open}} window of her bedroom.|$|R
50|$|During {{the ending}} credits, Jed, who also survived, {{is shown in}} a mental {{institution}} {{and appears to be}} obsessively writing a letter. <b>He</b> <b>looks</b> <b>up</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> camera and smiles while the end credits roll.|$|E
50|$|As Bryan {{leaves the}} place where he has buried Castro, <b>he</b> <b>looks</b> <b>up</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> {{vultures}} circling and tells them that they have feasted on many things but if they should ever have done so on Castro, they would have feasted on a real man.|$|E
5000|$|The 30-second {{version of}} the first PSA, from 1987, shows a man (played by John Roselius) in a starkly {{furnished}} apartment who asks if there is anyone out there who still doesn't understand the dangers of drug abuse. He holds up an egg and says, [...] "This is your brain," [...] before motioning to a frying pan and adding, [...] "This is drugs." [...] He then cracks open the egg, fries the contents, and says, [...] "This is your brain on drugs." [...] Finally <b>he</b> <b>looks</b> <b>up</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> camera and asks, [...] "Any questions?" ...|$|E
60|$|He scanned {{his finger}} nails. <b>He</b> <b>looked</b> <b>up</b> <b>at</b> Redwood with eyes bland through his glasses.|$|R
60|$|Mr. Fentolin stopped painting. His {{face was}} full of concern as <b>he</b> <b>looked</b> <b>up</b> <b>at</b> Hamel.|$|R
60|$|<b>He</b> <b>looked</b> <b>up</b> <b>at</b> her. A {{small smile}} of misery twisted his face. He shrugged his shoulders.|$|R
5000|$|In [...] "Journey's End" [...] because Donna's {{memory was}} wiped, Wilfred sees the Doctor {{off on her}} behalf, and {{promises}} whenever <b>he</b> <b>looks</b> <b>up</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> stars, he'll think of the Doctor, whom he considers a very close friend and almost a family member. Against Sylvia's claims that Donna was just as good before travelling with the Time Lord, Wilfred stands his ground and compels his daughter {{to admit that the}} Doctor made Donna a better person. While he agrees to keep the Doctor a secret, he also promises to keep watch for him in Donna's place in memory of his actions.|$|E
50|$|Jacob has {{subsequently}} {{been featured}} on Weekend Update, {{to tell the}} stories of Hanukkah and Passover. In each of these appearances, he reads from a prepared speech peppered with corny jokes (usually repeating a punchline on a later joke, even if it doesn't make sense); after each joke, <b>he</b> <b>looks</b> <b>up</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> audience with a grin. When Seth Meyers or Michael Che tells him he doesn't need to read from a script, or tries to engage him in dialogue, Jacob just smiles and then resumes his speech. Jacob is also incredibly shy when talking to Cecily Strong and most likely girls in general.|$|E
50|$|The cartoon {{begins with}} Wile E. Coyote chasing the Road Runner. Road Runner zooms off, and Wile stops. <b>He</b> <b>looks</b> <b>up</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> sun, and Road Runner enters {{and does the}} same. After {{a shot of the}} hot sun, the Road Runner zooms offscreen again. The Coyote sees Road Runner in an oasis and jumps in. The oasis {{turns out to be a}} mirage, and Wile falls between two cliffs. After landing, he sees another oasis, but he thinks that this one is a mirage as well. It turns out that that oasis was real, as Wile falls in. As he sinks, Wile holds up one hand as he counts to three as he drowns before the screen fades.|$|E
60|$|The Duke looked thoughtfully {{for several}} moments at the table before him. Then <b>he</b> <b>looked</b> <b>up</b> <b>at</b> me.|$|R
60|$|There was a moment's silence. Lord Cheisford {{turned again}} to his notes. Then <b>he</b> <b>looked</b> <b>up</b> <b>at</b> me.|$|R
60|$|<b>He</b> <b>looked</b> <b>up</b> <b>at</b> {{her with}} a sudden {{accession}} of confidence; her interest in the hat had flattered him.|$|R
50|$|At {{a trading}} post, a bigoted missionary {{identifies}} Blake {{and attempts to}} kill him but is killed by Blake, instead. Shortly after, Blake is shot again; and his condition rapidly deteriorates. Nobody takes him by river to a Makah village and convinces the tribe {{to give him a}} canoe for Blake's ship burial. Delirious, Blake trudges through the village before collapsing from his injuries. He awakens in a canoe on a beach wearing Native American funeral dress. Nobody bids Blake farewell and then pushes the canoe out to sea. As he floats away, Blake watches Cole sneak up behind Nobody; but he is too weak to cry out and can only watch as the two shoot and kill each other. As <b>he</b> <b>looks</b> <b>up</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> sky one last time, Blake dies and his canoe drifts out into the sea.|$|E
50|$|Tom chases Jerry {{all over}} the house (clips from Love That Pup, The Flying Cat, Professor Tom, and The Missing Mouse) until Jerry gets back at Tom by beating him up to a pulp in the closet and {{throwing}} him out (which was a clip from Jerry and the Lion). The lion in Jerry and the Lion was really beating him because it was a clip from that cartoon. Tom begs for mercy as they both call a truce with white flags, both become even and started to walk happily along down the street, they stop by the local cinema, where they both notice a poster advertising their cartoons (implying that Tom and Jerry have occupations as actors). The man who was standing by the wall noticed this cat and mouse. <b>He</b> <b>looks</b> <b>up</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> poster, then shrugs.|$|E
5000|$|In Revenge of the Sith [...] "The Imperial March" [...] {{is first}} played when Anakin rebukes the Jedi Council for denying him {{the rank of}} Jedi Master, {{although}} being appointed to the Council. The track can also be heard when Anakin tells Mace Windu about Palpatine's true identity. It is later played when Anakin is dubbed as the Sith Darth Vader, shortly {{after the death of}} Mace Windu. [...] "The Imperial March" [...] is quoted when Clone Troopers find dead wookiees on Kashyyyk and when Padmé confronts Anakin on Mustafar. A few notes of the [...] "March" [...] are played when Vader arrives on Mustafar to kill the Separatists. The piece is played more clearly during the [...] "Battle of the Heroes" [...] scene between Obi-Wan and Darth Vader at the movie's climax and in the simultaneous battle between Yoda and Palpatine. It is also played when Darth Vader receives his armor and when <b>he</b> <b>looks</b> <b>up</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> first Death Star.|$|E
60|$|<b>He</b> <b>looked</b> <b>up</b> <b>at</b> her calmly. His {{face was}} round and chubby {{and his eyes}} were big, blue, and earnest.|$|R
60|$|<b>He</b> <b>looked</b> <b>up</b> <b>at</b> her then, sidelong. The {{curve of}} her cheek and chin looked very soft, and rather jolly.|$|R
60|$|He rallied at {{the sound}} of that beloved voice. <b>He</b> <b>looked</b> <b>up</b> <b>at</b> her as she knelt at his head.|$|R
