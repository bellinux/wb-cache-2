These species share similarities in that they are both annual grasses with similar seed type. They differ, however, in that B. tectorum is non-native and highly invasive while V. microstachys is native to North America. For each ofthese species, I recorded germination time courses on bare soil and two types of biological soil crusts; one composed predominantly of the lichen Diploschistes muscorum (lichen crust) and the other comprised of an assortment of lichens and mosses (mixed crust). On the lichen crust, the final germination percentage (GP) for both grass species was about a third of that on the soil surface. In addition to differences in GP, the mean germination time (MGT) was three to four days longer on the lichen crust than on bare soil. In contrast to the lichen crust, the mixed crust did not reduce the GP or increase the MGT compared to the soil treatment. Similar results were observed in the two species studied.

Genotypic variation {{in the ability of}} roots to penetrate a hardpan has been reported for other cereals, using a pot technique, where a thin wax-layer of paraffin wax and petroleum jelly is placed in a soil column to simulate a hardpan. Previously we have modified and validated this technique for measuring <b>root</b> <b>penetration</b> ability of wheat seedlings under contrasting water regimes. Here we report on a series of five experiments (runs), two in well-watered and three in drought stress conditions, which evaluated seminal and nodal <b>root</b> <b>penetration</b> ability through thin wax layers among 24 Australian wheat cultivars and breeding lines (entries). These results were compared with observations on their rooting depths in two contrasting soil types in field trials, including a sandy duplex that contained a hardpan and a red clay that increased in soil strength with depth. Nodal roots ceased growth early under soil water deficit, and water uptake was instead dependant on seminal roots under conditions imposed in the pots.

Eight entries had superior <b>root</b> <b>penetration</b> ability in both well-watered and drought stressed conditions. Roots of three other entries, which failed to penetrate the wax layers, died under drought stress conditions.

40|$|In this review, {{we examine}} how roots {{penetrate}} a structured soil. We first {{examine the relationship}} between soil water status and its mechanical strength, as well as the ability of the soil to supply water to the root. We identify these as critical soil factors, because it is primarily in drying soil that mechanical constraints limit root elongation. Water supply to the root is important because root water status affects growth pressures and root stiffness. To simplify the bewildering complexity of soil–root interactions, the discussion is focused around the special cases of root elongation in soil with pores much smaller than the root diameter and the <b>penetration</b> of <b>roots</b> at interfaces within the soil. While it is often assumed that the former case is well understood, many unan-swered questions remain. While low soil–root friction is often viewed as a trait conferring better penetration of strong soils, it may also increase the axial pressure on the root tip and in so doing reduce the rate of cell division and/or expansion. The precise trade-off between various root traits involved in root elongation in homogeneous soil remains to be determined. There is consensus that the most important factors determining <b>root</b> <b>penetration</b> at an interface are the angle at which the root attempts to penetrate the soil, root stiffness, and the strength of the soil to be penetrated.

Nitrogen applications to the soil ranged from 0. 1 to 2. 75 g N per plant. Trees in the field at high N levels grew rapidly during summer, particularly in CO₂-enriched atmosphere, but suffered high mortality during summer heatwaves. Generally, wider and more numerous secondary xylem vessels at the root–shoot junction in CO₂-enriched trees conferred fourfold higher below-ground hydraulic conductance. Enhanced hydraulic capacity was typical of plants at elevated [CO₂] (in which root and shoot growth was accelerated), but did not result from high N supply. However, because high rates of N application consistently made trees prone to dehydration during heatwaves, glasshouse studies were required to identify the effect of N nutrition on root development and hydraulics.
