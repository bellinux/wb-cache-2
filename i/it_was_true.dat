5|$|For years, stories {{circulated}} of {{a treasure}} being buried within the amphitheater. W. T.

Spectators attended the planned explosion, but it was stopped just in time by CoE attorney David Waid.|$|E
5|$|Under section 505(c) of the Penal Code, it is {{an offence}} to make, publish or {{circulate}} any statement, rumour or report in written, electronic or other media with an intent to incite, or {{which is likely to}} incite, any class or community of persons to commit any offence against any other class or community of persons. The penalty is imprisonment for up to three years, a fine, or both. No offence is committed if the person who made, published or circulated the statement had reasonable grounds for believing <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>true,</b> and did not intend to incite one community against another.|$|E

25|$|Despite apologising on {{a number}} of platforms, in 2016, MacKenzie made a joke in The Sun {{newspaper}} that if <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>true</b> that George Osborne (the then Chancellor of the Exchequer) was putting gongs up for sale, he should be made 'Lord MacKenzie of Anfield (Liverpool FC's home stadium).|$|E
25|$|In 1623 she {{was arrested}} in Huamanga, Peru, because of a dispute. To prevent her {{execution}} she begged for mercy to Bishop Agustin de Carvajal, and confessed that she was actually {{a woman who had}} been in a convent. Following a review by a group of matrons, they determined <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>true</b> that she was a woman and a virgin, the bishop protected her and she was sent to Spain.|$|E
25|$|According to his great-great-grandson, d'Alembert {{received}} him rather poorly, {{and to get}} rid of him {{gave him}} a thick mathematics book, saying to come back when he had read it. When Laplace came back a few days later, d'Alembert was even less friendly and did not hide his opinion that it was impossible that Laplace could have read and understood the book. But upon questioning him, he realised that <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>true,</b> and from that time he took Laplace under his care.|$|E

25|$|Andrews himself {{believed}} that he was primarily used for away matches particularly against tough opposition. The evidence doesn't entirely support this since of his 49 matches in these 3 seasons 22 were at home and 27 were away, although these included the 3 matches away to Yorkshire. <b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>true,</b> however, that priority was often given to Amateurs and since they were most often available in the summer holidays in August when Somerset played many of their home games, he was likely to play more often away that at home.|$|E
25|$|The Évian Conference was convened 6–15 July 1938, at Évian-les-Bains, France, {{to discuss}} the Jewish refugee problem and {{the plight of the}} {{increasing}} numbers of Jewish refugees fleeing persecution by Nazi Germany. It was convened at the initiative of United States President Franklin D. Roosevelt who perhaps hoped to obtain commitments from some of the invited nations to accept more refugees, although he took pains to avoid stating that objective expressly. <b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>true</b> that Roosevelt desired to deflect attention and criticism from American policy that severely limited the quota of Jewish refugees admitted to the United States.|$|E
25|$|In later years, she {{was seen}} {{outside in the}} garden alone, and Přiklopil's {{business}} partner has said that Kampusch seemed relaxed and happy when she and Přiklopil called at his home to borrow a trailer. After her eighteenth birthday, she was allowed {{to leave the house}} with Přiklopil, but her kidnapper threatened to kill her if she made any noise. He later took her on a skiing trip to a resort near Vienna for a few hours. She initially denied that they had made the trip, but eventually admitted that <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>true,</b> although she said she had no chance to escape during that time.|$|E

25|$|This {{recruitment}} policy implied that usually {{half of the}} States Army consisted of foreign troops, and in times of expansion of the army even more. The army had a Scotch brigade during its entire existence. The English regiments were regretfully paid off after they refused to swear allegiance just {{before the start of}} the Second Anglo-Dutch War in 1663. The French regiments disappeared during the wars with France at the end of the century, but were replaced with Swiss regiments for the remainder of the existence of the army. Though it is often maintained that the Republic only recruited Protestants in reality this was not a condition of employment. <b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>true</b> that only Protestant chaplains had access to the army, but Catholics were allowed to enroll, and some did.|$|E
25|$|A 2002 {{report by}} a {{researcher}} at Manchester Metropolitan University found that while <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>true</b> that {{a higher proportion of}} City season ticket holders came from Manchester postcode areas (40% compared to United's 29%), there were more United season ticket holders, the lower percentage being due to United's higher overall number of season ticket holders (27,667 compared to City's 16,481). However, the report warned that since the compiling of data in 2001, the number of both City and United season ticket holders had risen hugely; expansion of United's ground and City's move to the City of Manchester Stadium have caused season ticket sales to increase further. The 2002 report has lost most of its validity as both clubs season tickets sales have fluctuated further as of 2010, with United selling 52,000 season tickets and City selling out all of its allocated 36,000 season tickets.|$|E
25|$|Pasteur was {{responsible}} for disproving the doctrine of spontaneous generation. He performed experiments that showed that without contamination, microorganisms could not develop. Under {{the auspices of the}} French Academy of Sciences, he demonstrated that in sterilized and sealed flasks nothing ever developed, and in sterilized but open flasks microorganisms could grow. Although Pasteur was not the first to propose the germ theory, his experiments indicated its correctness and convinced most of Europe that <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>true.</b> Today, he is often {{regarded as one of the}} fathers of germ theory. Pasteur made significant discoveries in chemistry, most notably on the molecular basis for the asymmetry of certain crystals and racemization. Early in his career, his investigation of tartaric acid resulted in the first resolution of what is now called optical isomers. His work led the way to the current understanding of a fundamental principle in the structure of organic compounds.|$|E

5000|$|Knowledge is {{a thought}} in the individual's mind, which is {{characterized}} by the individual's justifiable belief that <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>true.</b> <b>It</b> can <b>be</b> empirical and non-empirical, {{as in the case of}} logical and mathematical knowledge (e.g., [...] "every triangle has three sides"), religious knowledge (e.g., [...] "God exists"), philosophical knowledge (e.g., [...] "Cogito ergo sum"), and the like. Note that knowledge is the content of a {{thought in the}} individual's mind, which {{is characterized by the}} individual's justifiable belief that <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>true,</b> while [...] "knowing" [...] is a state of mind which is characterized by the three conditions: (1) the individual believes that <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>true,</b> (2) S/he can justify it, and (3) <b>It</b> <b>is</b> <b>true,</b> or <b>it</b> appears to <b>be</b> <b>true.</b> (Italics added.

25|$|Despite {{the large}} number of people inquiring after other people, the {{received}} wisdom of the wee morning hours was that most, if not all, people had gotten out alive. Among the police and fire fighters, this idea stemmed largely from the last searches of District Engineer Farley: no one had been seen in the parquet or parquet circle. No one had been seen in the dress circle. <b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>true</b> that no one had physically checked the gallery, but people had called up there and received no reply, nor were there sounds of movement. The inclination was to hope for the best. True, when Charles Vine dropped himself off the gallery there had still been hundreds of people struggling on the staircase, but Vine had sought medical assistance for his deep cuts, so what he knew was not general knowledge. When the morning papers went to press, none carried news of casualties.|$|E
25|$|General Edmund Hogan {{was also}} a veteran of several heated {{political}} campaigns for seats in the council of the Territorial Legislature. Hogan represented Arkansas in the Territorial General Assembly of Missouri in 1816 and 1818, when Arkansas {{was part of the}} Missouri Territory. In the election of 1827, there were three candidates, Colonel Walker, General Hogan and Judge Scott. The election was apparently very heated. After the election was over, tensions appeared to calm and everything appeared quiet. On May 31, 1828 a public hanging occurred in Little Rock, which drew spectators from far and near. When the hanging was over Judge Scott {{made his way to the}} store of McLane & Badgett on the west side of Main street. He was discussing the circumstances of the hanging, when General Hogan entered the store. General Hogan was a man weighing nearly three hundred pounds, and stood over six feet tall. Judge Scott was a small man, not weighing more than one hundred and thirty pounds. The conversation went on, with both Scott and Hogan taking part, neither showing any animosity to the other. The conversation soon diverged from the hanging to politics, and before the men knew it they were discussing the old Walker and Hogan political race. This seemed to revive in the mind of General Hogan something that occurred in the triangular race between himself, Walker and Scott. He turned to Scott and accused him of writing a letter which was derogatory to Hogan. Scott at once informed the general that he had been misinformed. Hogan reiterated the statement and said that he believed that <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>true.</b> Scott denied it again, and apparently accused Hogan of lying. Both men were standing up and as soon as Scott made the last remark, Hogan struck him, knocking him to the floor. Scott remained on the floor for a moment, apparently knocked senseless. As Scott revived, he struggled to his feet, and Hogan prepared to strike another blow. As Scott arose he unsheathed a dirk from a sword cane which he carried and plunged the dirk several times into the body of General Hogan. Hogan fell and expired within an hour. Judge Scott was arrested by his brother, United States Marshal George Scott, and taken before an officer for trial. The facts as stated above were there proven, and the court held Hogan to have been the aggressor and released Judge Scott.|$|E
500|$|Critic Vladimir Stasov, who {{along with}} Balakirev had founded The Five, wrote in 1882, [...] "Beginning with Glinka, all the best Russian musicians have been very skeptical of book {{learning}} and have never approached it with the servility and the superstitious reverence with which it is approached to this day {{in many parts of}} Europe." [...] This statement was not true for Glinka, who studied Western music theory assiduously with Siegfried Dehn in Berlin before he composed his opera A Life for the Tsar. <b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>true</b> for Balakirev, who [...] "opposed academicism with tremendous vigor," [...] and <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>true</b> initially for Rimsky-Korsakov, who had been imbued by Balakirev and Stasov with the same attitude.|$|E
