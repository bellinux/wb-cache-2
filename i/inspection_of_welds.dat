40|$|AbstractClassical {{ultrasonic}} <b>inspection</b> <b>of</b> <b>welds</b> {{is currently}} done for plates thicker than 8 mm. The inspection of but welds in thin walled pipes has considerable implementation difficulties, due to guided waves dominating ultrasonic pulses propagation. Generation of purely symmetric modes, either torsional or longitudinal, requires a circumferential uniform distribution of transducers and dedicated inspection equipment, which are increasing the inspection costs. Moreover, if {{the surface is}} paint coated, the received signals {{are close to the}} detection level. The present work implies a single transducer, coupled to the painted surface. The proper choice of the guided mode and frequency range, allows the detection of a standard, small diameter through thickness hole. In this way, the inspection of pipe welds can use the same equipment as for thick materials, with only wedge adaptation...|$|E
30|$|In this article, the {{anisotropic}} diffusion {{scheme for}} defect detection in the TFT-LCD screens is {{extended to the}} defect detection in radiographic images.

Until now and in several industrial applications radiographic film analysis are done exclusively by the radiograph inspector who is required to visually inspect each film and detect the presence of possible defects. Consequently the automatization of such a procedure becomes necessary. The new proposed method allows to automatically detect the possible defects through enhancing and sharpening the radiographic images. The multiple simulations carried out show good performance of the proposed detection scheme. Plots of multiple 2 D intensity profiles taken from the areas containing the defects show that the new method highlights the defect details and allows efficient distinctions between the faultless background and the defect details.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. In the German {{pipeline}} industry {{ultrasonic testing}} (UT) {{has been and}} still is the method favoured over radiographic testing (RT) for the inspection of girth welds. However, in the internationally widely applied Standard API 1104 (Welding of Pipelines and Related Facilities) till the nineteenth edition, September 1999, UT was of secondary importance when compared to RT. The NDT requirements in API 1104 are contrary to the NDT requirements in API 5 L (Line Pipes), which are applied in pipe mills for the longitudinal and spiral welds, specifically for the continuous and uninterrupted <b>inspection</b> <b>of</b> <b>welds</b> by ultrasonic means (Automatic respectively mechanized UT). Common line pipe specifications like API 5 L and EN 10208 (Steel Pipes for pipe lines for combustible fluids) include clear definitions about the reference standards used and define clearly the acceptance criteria for the applied ultrasonic inspection. As long as the NDT of girth welds is based on European Standards, the testing parameters including reference criteria and acceptance criteria for the ultrasonic inspection are also clearly defined. Depending on the quality requirements of the pipeline girth welds, a quality level, a testing class and an acceptance level are to be specified and on that basis reliable and reproducible UT result...|$|E

40|$|The {{detection}} of defects in thick butt joints {{in the early}} phase of multi-pass arc welding would be very valuable to reduce cost and time in the necessity of reworking. As a non-contact method, the laser-ultrasonic technique (LUT) {{has the potential for}} the automated <b>inspection</b> <b>of</b> <b>welds,</b> ultimately online during manufacturing. In this study, testing has been carried out using LUT combined with the synthetic aperture focusing technique (SAFT) on 25 and 50 mm thick butt welded joints of steel both completed and partially welded. EDM slits of 2 or 3 mm height were inserted at different depths in the multi-pass welding process to simulate a lack of fusion. Line scans transverse to the weld are performed with the generation and detection laser spots superimposed directly {{on the surface of the}} weld bead. A CCD line camera is used to simultaneously acquire the surface profile for correction in the SAFT processing. All artificial defects but also real defects are visualized in the investigated thick butt weld specimens, either completed or partially welded after a given number of passes. The results obtained clearly show the potential of using the LUT with SAFT for the automated inspection of arc welds or hybrid laser-arc welds during manufacturing.

40|$|A {{prototype}} {{of a novel}} device for RT <b>inspection</b> <b>of</b> <b>welds</b> for tube-to-tube sheet joints on heat exchangers was constructed and applied in chemical industry for more than 5 years. State of the art is radiographic testing based on Gammamat B 3 containing an Ir 192 isotope as radiation source and NDT film (typically system class C 3 acc. to EN 584 - 1) as detector. The sensitivity of this testing method {{is limited by the}} properties of the radiation source. In 2006 a new specialized, direct converting detector based on CdTe was designed by Ajat Oy, Finland.

The handling of this novel inspection unit as well as the computer based image acquisition reduces the expense for this RT inspection considerably. The computer based evaluation of the digital radiographs and the direct connection to the inspection data base of the complete heat exchanger create significant advantages for inspection planning and documentation.

40|$|Computed Radiography (CR) {{is gaining}} {{importance}} in industries for <b>inspection</b> <b>of</b> <b>welds</b> and castings using x-rays. CR is preferred because of lesser exposure time, no chemical processing, lesser cost of consumables and {{advantage of a}} digital image output. It also allows archiving of digital images over many years, which is mandatory as per standards. Hence, Heavy engineering industries, manufactures of high-pressure boilers, Oil & Gas and Energy industries are interested to use Computed Radiography (CR) for testing weld integrity and corrosion monitoring of process pipes. These applications require radiography {{to be carried out}} using radioactive isotopes such as Se- 75, Ir- 192 and Co- 60. However, industries do not have enough experience of using CR with isotopes. They require information on choosing the right isotope for different range of thicknesses of a material, {{in order to meet the}} ASME Section–V standards. It will also be helpful if there exists data on comparative performance of CR with respect to films on image quality. The authors have done extensive study at various engineering industries and characterized the performance of CR with isotopes.
