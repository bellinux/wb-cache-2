25|$|Contrary to {{a popular}} myth, the AMC V8 was not built by Ford or anyone else {{although}} it bears an uncanny resemblance to the later Buick V8 engines (400, 430, 455). It shares the same design employing a timing <b>gear</b> <b>case</b> that mounts both distributor and oil pump. It also shares the same oiling scheme employing a single passage to feed both cam and crank from the right lifter bank by tangentially intersecting the cam bore instead of two drilled passages, one from the cam to crank and another from the crank to the right lifter bank. Some electrical parts (starter and distributor) were shared with Fords, and some models used Motorcraft (Ford) carburetors, but {{the balance of the}} engine design is unique.|$|E

50|$|Mr. Joseph G. Grose, {{who began}} {{work as a}} leather currier in Ambush Street, St. James' End, Northampton. He took an {{interest}} in cycle racing and held several national records before becoming a cycle repairer and maker. In 1897 he invented the Grose patent <b>gear</b> <b>case</b> made of leather that covered the cycle's driving mechanism to protect ladies skirts from catching in the chain. This sold in large numbers and was so successful that the Grose <b>Gear</b> <b>Case</b> Company Ltd. was formed in July,1897 to manufacture it. The case was later used to cover the drive chain of early motor cars.|$|E

50|$|Because {{the drive}} train was still {{developed}} from the same source, the available engines were identical: The same 2.4 L four-cylinder (22R-E) and 3.0 L V6 (3VZ) engines were available in rear-wheel-drive and four-wheel-drive layouts. The new 4Runner used the independent front suspension that had been developed on the previous generation. The older style <b>gear</b> driven transfer <b>case</b> was phased out on the V6 models and they now had a chain driven <b>case.</b> The older <b>gear</b> driven <b>case</b> was retained on the 4-cylinder models.|$|R
50|$|Quadra-Trac was {{the trade}} {{name for the}} Borg-Warner 1305 and 1339 <b>gear</b> <b>cases.</b> It was a chain-drive system {{introduced}} in 1973 on the full-sized Jeep line behind the AMC version of the Turbo-Hydramatic 400 automatic transmission. CJ7s also received the Quadra-Trac starting in 1976. The BW1305 included 1) a differential with a cone-type slip-limiting clutch to distribute torque between {{the front and rear}} output shafts and 2) a vacuum-switch-operated differential lock. It offered only 4WD Hi modes in full-time (open) or part-time (locked) modes. The BW1339 added a 2.57:1 low range gearset to the BW1305, enabling 5 modes: 4WD Hi Locked, 4WD Hi Open, Neutral, 4WD Low Open, and 4WD Low Locked.|$|R

5000|$|In 1950 Mercury {{engineers}} {{came out}} with the Super 10 Hurricane, Model KG-7. This motor was based on previous models KE-7 Lightning and KF-7 Super 10. Upgrades included redesigned connecting rods, upgraded aluminum clamp and swivel brackets, a new high RPM magneto, improved porting, an 8 Reed valve cage (as opposed to KE-7 and KF-7’s 4) and larger crankcase opening. Hurricane was also advertised at 10 hp*, way below the actual horsepower developed, Mercury noted this asterisk by stating that horsepower varies with rpm; really the Hurricane could deliver up to 18 hp. Shortly after the introduction of the Hurricane, Mercury came up with their first performance <b>gear</b> <b>case</b> with the capability of mating to a standard driveshaft housing of a KG-7 or similar green top engine of the time. This was named “Quicksilver” and promised an extra 20 to 30% increase in top speed. Essentially, it boasted a significantly slimmer pointed <b>gear</b> <b>case</b> that housed an integrated rubber rotex water pump and forward only 1:1 gears along with the necessary bearings. After a few months of use, Mercury found that the average race boat's transom would not elevate the standard driveshaft housing and quicksilver <b>gear</b> <b>case</b> high enough for peak performance. Rectifying this problem, Mercury developed the Quicksilver driveshaft housing. This new driveshaft housing was three inches shorter which in turn lowered the motor's center of gravity on the boat which helped turning ability, reduced the strain on the boat's transom and motor's clamp brackets, and decreased underwater drag while increasing top speed as less gearcase was below the boat. In addition the motor had a sort-of cut down lower anti-cavitation plate, protruding forward upper anti-cavitation plate (spray plate), a stronger rear-mounted steering bar design, and finally, an exhaust opening above the water surface that reduced exhaust back pressure while increasing noise levels when the boat was on plane. When the dealer installed the quicksilver driveshaft housing and <b>gear</b> <b>case</b> (packaged at $82.25) he had authorization to hand stamp a small [...] "Q" [...] behind the serial numbers on the tag and block. Some did, some did not - and so, the [...] "Stamped Q" [...] came to be. 1951 saw the first production race-ready outboard models; KG-4Q, KG7-Q, and KG-9Q. These motors were pulled off the production line at random, given the quicksilver <b>gear</b> <b>case,</b> driveshaft housing, and [...] "Q" [...] stamp behind the tag serial number and block serial number. These KG-7Qs worked fine on runabouts but were too long for hydroplanes - and the racers made this known to Mercury. So thus was born the 2" [...] shorter [...] "H" [...] driveshaft housing in 1952. Right before Mercury released this [...] "H" [...] driveshaft housing, they still had several [...] "Q" [...] length driveshaft housings, so they introduced a factory KG-7Q which had a green silk screened Q behind the serial number on the tag and a factory stamped [...] "Q" [...] on the block. These motors are very rare; they fall into the serial range of 532404-532963.|$|E

50|$|A <b>gear</b> <b>case,</b> {{also known}} as a chain case or chainguard, is an {{enclosure}} for the bicycle chain and sprocket assemblages commonly employed by utility bicycles. It serves to protect the cyclist from being soiled or trapped in the chain rings and tends to fully enclose the drive train. It may also contain an oil bath to keep the chain lubricated. Modern examples are usually moulded in plastic. Similar devices may be found in connection with chains used on larger vehicles and machinery.|$|E
50|$|The ZF S6-650 - Heavy Duty 6 speed manual {{transmission}} has an aluminium alloy main <b>gear</b> <b>case</b> and tail housing with the bell housing {{integral to the}} case. It is built in two-wheel drive and four-wheel drive versions. The model used in the Ford trucks has an internal oil pump to circulate and cool the lubricant, which is uncommon in {{manual transmission}}s. While the GM versions are not equipped with an oil pump. All gears are synchronized. There is a dual cone synchronizer on 2nd and 3rd gears with an input torque rating of 520 ft-lb.|$|E

"C" [...] series engines were {{developed}} for highly streamlined pursuit aircraft for the USAAC, and are easily {{identified by the}} long reduction <b>gear</b> <b>case.</b> The military models were V-1710-3, -5, -7, -11. -13, -15, -19, -21, -23, -33, producing between [...] at 2600 rpm. These engines came in two groups, one group rated at full power at sea level, the other rated at full power at high altitude. The altitude rating difference was in the supercharger gear ratio, four of which were used: 6.23:1, 6.75:1, 8.0:1 and 8.77:1. These engines received heavier crankcases, a stronger crankshaft, SAE #50 propeller shaft, and Bendix pressure carburetors.|$|E

50|$|There are two {{different}} types of internal power-transfer mechanism found in most transfer cases. Gear-driven transfer cases use sets of gears to drive either the front or both the front and rear driveshafts.

50|$|During {{the winter}} of 1998, a severe ice storm cut off power to many homes and {{businesses}} in Ontario and Quebec. CN M-420 3502 was hoisted off the rails by crane and rolled along a street in Boucherville QC {{in order to provide}} power in the community. The engine was driven approximately 1000 ft under its own power to the city hall, where it then became a portable power generator. M-420 3508 was also lifted from the tracks to provide power to a school being used as a shelter, but problems prevented this from happening, and 3508 remained on standby. Both engines suffered minor <b>gear</b> <b>case</b> damage and carved grooves in the pavement.|$|E

5000|$|Truck {{transmissions}} use many physical layouts. For example, {{the output}} of an N-speed transmission may drive an M-speed secondary transmission, giving a total of N*M gear combinations; for example a 4-speed main box and 3-speed splitter gives 12 ratios. Transmissions may be in separate cases with a shaft in between; in separate cases bolted together; or all in one case, using the same lubricating oil. The second transmission is often called a [...] "Brownie" [...] or [...] "Brownie box" [...] after a popular brand. With a third transmission, gears are multiplied yet again, giving greater range or closer spacing. Some trucks thus have dozens of gear positions, although most are duplicates. Sometimes a secondary transmission is integrated with the differential in the rear axle, called a [...] "two-speed rear end". Two-speed differentials are always splitters. In newer transmissions, there may be two countershafts, so each main shaft gear can be driven from {{one or the other}} countershaft; this allows construction with short and robust countershafts, while still allowing many gear combinations inside a single <b>gear</b> <b>case.</b>|$|E

40|$|A {{planetary}} gearbox {{is widely used}} in various rotating systems {{because it can be}} used as a speed reducer or increaser without change in direction of shaft while transferring great driving power. Despite many attempts it is still challenging to diagnose potential faults of the {{planetary gearbox}} because of multiple contacts and axis rotation of planet gears resulting in complex vibration characteristics. This paper thus presents an original method to isolate vibration signals induced by the planet gears from the complex vibration signals for fault diagnostics of the planetary gearbox. First, an in-depth study on the vibration characteristics of planet gears is presented using the autocorrelation function of the vibration signal. The autocorrelation-based time synchronous averaging (ATSA) method is then developed for the isolation of the vibration signals produced by the planet gears. The vibration signals were utilized for extracting health related data which facilitate the efficient fault diagnostics of the planet <b>gears.</b> <b>Case</b> study with a wind turbine testbed showed that the proposed method can diagnose the root crack of the planet gears. 1...|$|R
