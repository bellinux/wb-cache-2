40|$|Abstract Missing genotypes are {{a common}} feature of high density SNP {{datasets}} obtained using SNP chip technology and {{this is likely to}} decrease the accuracy of genomic selection. This problem can be circumvented by imputing the missing genotypes with estimated genotypes. When implementing imputation, the criteria used for SNP data <b>quality</b> <b>control</b> and whether to perform imputation before or after data <b>quality</b> <b>control</b> need to consider. In this paper, we compared six strategies of imputation and <b>quality</b> <b>control</b> using different imputation methods, different <b>quality</b> <b>control</b> criteria and by changing the order of imputation and <b>quality</b> <b>control,</b> against a real dataset of milk production traits in Chinese Holstein cattle. The results demonstrated that, no matter what imputation method and <b>quality</b> <b>control</b> criteria were used, strategies with imputation before <b>quality</b> <b>control</b> performed better than strategies with imputation after <b>quality</b> <b>control</b> in terms of accuracy of genomic selection. The different imputation methods and <b>quality</b> <b>control</b> criteria did not significantly influence the accuracy of genomic selection.
