500|$|On 24 July 2011, Hooper had {{a penalty}} saved by Graham Stack in Celtic's first match of the 2011–12 season, a 2–0 win over Hibs. On 13 August, he scored his first {{goal of the}} season in a 5–1 win over Dundee United. He also picked up an ankle injury which ruled him out for the next two matches. On 25 August he made his return in Celtic's 3–1 loss to FC Sion. Three days later, he scored both goals in a 2–0 win over St Mirren. English Premier League clubs Queens Park Rangers and Wolverhampton Wanderers {{expressed}} interest in signing Hooper on transfer deadline day of summer 2011, however Celtic rejected their enquiries about his availability. Hooper's regular strike partner Anthony Stokes said [...] "He's a top, top player. I have no doubt one day he could play at the very top level but we want to keep him <b>here</b> <b>as</b> <b>long</b> <b>as</b> possible." ...|$|E
500|$|In 1974, writer Peter Benchley {{published}} Jaws, a {{novel about}} a rogue great white shark that terrorizes the fictional coastal community of Amity Island. Chief of police Martin Brody, biologist Matt Hooper, and fisherman Quint hunt the shark after it kills four people. The novel was adapted as the film Jaws by Steven Spielberg in 1975. Spielberg's film makes reference {{to the events of}} 1916: Brody (Roy Scheider) and Hooper (Richard Dreyfuss) urge Amity's Mayor Vaughn (Murray Hamilton) to close the beaches on the Fourth of July after the deaths of two swimmers and a fisherman. Hooper explains to the mayor, [...] "Look, the situation is that apparently a great white shark has staked a claim in the waters off Amity Island. And he's going to continue to feed <b>here</b> <b>as</b> <b>long</b> <b>as</b> there is food in the water." [...] Brody adds, [...] "And there's no limit to what he's gonna do! I mean we've already had three incidents, two people killed inside of a week. And it's gonna happen again, it happened before! The Jersey beach!... 1916! Five people chewed up on the surf!" [...] Richard Ellis, Richard Fernicola, and Michael Capuzzo suggest that the 1916 Jersey Shore attacks, Coppleson's rogue shark theory, and the exploits of New York fisherman Frank Mundus inspired Benchley. While Benchley states Mundus was an inspiration for Quint, he has denied the book was inspired by attacks off New Jersey in 1916. [...] The attacks are also briefly referred to in Benchley's novel White Shark (1994).|$|E

2500|$|On May 29, Halladay {{was placed}} on the 15-day {{disabled}} list with a shoulder strain. It was his first DL stint since 2009. In a press conference on June 6, Halladay stated, [...] "Ultimately, my goal is to finish my career with the Phillies and win a World Series here. Some of those things are not fully in my control, but my intent is to play here and finish my career here and be <b>here</b> <b>as</b> <b>long</b> <b>as</b> I can." [...] Halladay stated this during his press conference about his shoulder injury, which he revealed that he will sit out three more weeks, and then re-evaluate his condition. The injury would eventually be diagnosed as a strained latissimus dorsi and Halladay was hopeful {{he would be able to}} return shortly after the All-Star break in July.|$|E
2500|$|A {{siege of}} Khartoum by the Mahdist forces {{commanded}} by the Mahdi himself started on 18 March 1884. Initially, {{the siege of}} Khartoum was more in nature a blockade rather than a true siege as the Mahdi's forces lacked the strength to wage a proper siege, for example only cutting the telegraphy lines in April 1884. The British had decided to abandon the Sudan, {{but it was clear}} that Gordon had other plans, and the public increasingly called for a relief expedition. Gordon's last telegrams were clearly meant for the British public with one message addressed to Baring reading: [...] "You state your intention of not sending any relief force up here to Berber...I shall hold on <b>here</b> <b>as</b> <b>long</b> <b>as</b> I can, and if I can suppress the rebellion, I shall do so. If I cannot, I shall retire to the Equator and leave you with the indelible disgrace of abandoning the garrisons".|$|E

Roe deer have lived <b>here</b> for <b>as</b> <b>long</b> <b>as</b> the forest itself, while fallow deer were introduced {{at some point during the}} middle ages.

Other climbs, while still at Doon, included Trisul with Gurdial Singh, a teacher from Doon. While Singh went on to reach the peak of Trisul, where he performed a headstand asana to honor the Hindu god Shiva, Jayal noted his own feelings in lyrical terms: [...] "The grass on which we camped was like a cushion sprinkled with tiny mauve primula and the gentle lapping of the running water recalled melodies from Beethoven’s Pastoral Symphony.

During the occupation, Payne commented that they would [...] "be <b>here</b> for <b>as</b> <b>long</b> <b>as</b> it takes."

Payne was arrested and taken into custody on January 26 during a traffic stop on U.S. Route 395 in Harney County, Oregon. He helped coordinate community meetings outside the refuge during the occupation.|$|R
