5|$|Abbe {{was born}} on 15 December 1915 in a village in Tokushima Prefecture, {{on the island of}} Shikoku, Japan. He was the son of Toshizo Abbe, who was the local school's {{headmaster}} and a kendo instructor, and his wife, Kote Abbe. The couple had four sons and five daughters, and Abbe was the youngest child in the family. On 4 September 1919, when Abbe was not yet four years old, his father drowned <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>flash</b> flood while training in the mountains. A young schoolteacher, Manpei Hino, subsequently became a father figure for the young boy and introduced him to the martial arts, including sumo.

5|$|Following {{his term}} in office, Combs was {{appointed}} to the Sixth Circuit Court of Appeals by President Johnson. He served for three years before resigning and running for governor again in 1971. He lost in the Democratic primary to Wendell Ford, his former executive secretary. In 1984, Combs agreed to represent sixty-six of the state's poor school districts in a lawsuit challenging the state's system of financing public education. The suit, Rose v. Council for Better Education, resulted in the Kentucky Supreme Court declaring the state's entire system of public schools unconstitutional. In response, the Kentucky General Assembly drafted a sweeping education measure known as the Kentucky Education Reform Act in 1991. On December 3, 1991, Combs was caught <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>flash</b> flood while driving and was killed.|$|E

5|$|The Overlords {{are eager}} to escape from their own {{evolutionary}} dead end by studying the Overmind, so Rodricks's information is potentially of great value to them. By radio, Rodricks describes a vast burning column ascending from the planet. As the column disappears, Rodricks experiences {{a profound sense of}} emptiness when the children have gone. Then material objects and the Earth itself begin to dissolve into transparency. Jan reports no fear, but a powerful sense of fulfillment.

5|$|In a {{parallel}} universe, a fantasy world of Enchantia is suffering under the terrible rule {{of a powerful}} coven of wicked witches. Their queen, who managed to surpass the rest in her boundless cruelty and depravity, frantically seeks a live male child from another dimension as the main ingredient of her desired spell of eternal youth. Having borrowed magic powers {{from all the other}} witches in Enchantia on the promise to make them too young forever, she created an invisible portal connection to Earth. One day in our world in the 1990s, an American young teenager named Brad plays a baseball practice with his sister Jenny when the witch spots him through the portal and incants a summoning spell, making him suddenly vanish <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>flash</b> of light. The game begins as Brad, dressed in medieval-style clothing, wakes up in a dungeon cell. But the boy soon manages to escape, and then sets out on a journey to return home safely. In the course of his surreal adventure, he braves various dangers, meets a host of friendly and hostile characters, and rises to become a reluctant hero who just might break the titular curse and bring down the evil's reign.|$|E

25|$|Strobe lights usually use flashtubes {{with energy}} {{supplied}} from a capacitor, an energy storage device {{much like a}} battery, but capable of charging and releasing energy much faster. Recently, some strobe lights {{have been found to}} use rectified mains electricity and no capacitors at all. In a capacitor-based strobe light, the capacitor is charged up to around 300 V. Once the capacitor has been charged, a small amount of power is diverted into a trigger transformer, a small transformer with a high turns ratio. This generates the weak but high voltage spike required to ionize the xenon gas <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>flash</b> tube. An arc is created inside the tube, which acts as a bridge for the much bigger pulse to flow down later. Arcs present almost a direct short circuit, allowing the capacitors to quickly release their energy into the arc. This rapidly heats the xenon gas, creating an extremely bright plasma discharge, which is seen as a flash.|$|E
25|$|Surrounded in mystery, {{the object}} of fear, hatred, and even worship {{by members of the}} Church of the Final Atonement (the Shrike Cult), the Shrike's origins are {{described}} as uncertain. It is portrayed as composed of razorwire, thorns, blades, and cutting edges, having fingers like scalpels and long, curved toe blades. It has the ability to control the flow of time, and may thus appear to travel infinitely fast. The Shrike may kill victims <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>flash</b> or it may transport them to an eternity of impalement upon an enormous artificial 'Tree of Thorns,' or 'Tree of Pain' in Hyperion's distant future. The Tree of Thorns is described as an unimaginably large, metallic tree, alive with the agonized writhing of countless human victims of all ages and races. It is also hinted in the second book that the Tree of Thorns is actually a simulation generated by a mystical interface which connects to human brains via a strong and pulsing (as if it were alive) cord.|$|E
25|$|The {{control of}} the time machine is the same in all three films. The {{operator}} is seated inside the DeLorean (except the first time, when a remote control is used), and turns on the time circuits, activating a unit containing multiple fourteen- and seven-segment displays that show the destination (red), present (green), and last-departed (yellow) dates and times. After entering a target date, the operator accelerates the car to , which activates the flux capacitor. As it accelerates, several coils around the body glow blue/white while a burst of light appears in front of it. Surrounded by electrical current similar to a Tesla coil, the whole car vanishes <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>flash</b> of white/blue light seconds later, leaving a pair of fiery tire tracks. A digital speedometer {{is attached to the}} dashboard so that the operator can accurately gauge the car's speed. Various proposals have been brought forth in the past by fans of the movie franchise for why the car has to be moving at 88mph to achieve temporal displacement, but actually the production crew chose the velocity simply because they liked how it looked on the speedometer.|$|E

Lola also {{narrowly}} misses the cyclist; the cyclist instead offers his bike to the homeless man in a restaurant, who uses Manni's money to buy it. Lola falls onto the bonnet of Mr. Meier's car, preventing his collision with the white BMW, allowing him to pick up Lola's dad on time. Since Lola can no longer speak to her dad, she continues running until she encounters a casino. Having only 99 marks, she convinces the cashier to give her a 100 mark chip. Betting the chip on a roulette table, she wins two consecutive bets, raising 126,000 marks. The people in the casino are shocked to see her win. Approaching the ambulance from behind, Lola climbs inside as it avoids the glass pane. Recognizing the patient inside as a security guard from the bank, Lola realizes he has suffered a heart attack. She holds his hand to calm him and, to the doctor's surprise, his heart rate immediately becomes normal.|$|E

There, Aer and Neviril learn that Emerald Ri Mājon allows the sibyllae piloting the Simoun to travel through time. Rimone and Dominūra are shown to have landed {{in the distant past}} where they pass on the knowledge of the Emerald Ri Mājon. Chor Tempest continue to fight as they slowly retreat back, and eventually Simulacrum sues for peace. The allied Plumbish and Argentum forces demand in their terms that all sibyllae become adults by visiting the holy Spring, thereby no longer being able to pilot Simoun. While the members Chor Tempest head off to the Spring, Aer and Neviril stay back and soon confess their feelings for each other. The allied occupation arrest them, however with the help of their former choirmates and the Plumbish priestesses, Aer and Neviril break free and say their farewells.

25|$|The dumping of sludge {{in the sea}} {{ended in}} 1998, {{following}} a European Community Directive, and the remaining sludge boats were sold. The sludge pipeline was used to transfer sludge to Shell Green, near Widnes, where it is turned into ash, or used in agriculture. Parts of the old secondary beds became the Davyhulme Millennium Nature Reserve in 2000, and low-profile geodesic domes were built over the primary settlement tanks in 2003, {{as part of a}} £20 million odour control scheme. The works continues to be innovative. In 2013, the world's largest thermal hydrolysis plant was commissioned. Sludge is heated to 165 degrees Celsius under pressure, and the pressure is then released <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>flash</b> tank. This process breaks up complex organic substances, allowing it to be digested more easily. Large volumes of methane are a by-product, which enables the site to be self-sufficient for gas and electricity. A £200 million upgrade to the second Activated Sludge Plant began in 2014, and is expected to be completed in 2018. The works now handles sewage for a population of 1.2 million people, most of which is water. Income is generated from the processing of trade effluent, which accounts for 70 percent of the organic load. Its output forms around 40 percent of the ship canal below Barton Locks.|$|E
