5000|$|Increased {{wheel weight}} and {{rotating}} mass (spokes, rim, and tire are all larger) makes the wheels <b>harder</b> <b>to</b> accelerate and <b>harder</b> <b>to</b> brake.|$|R
50|$|Beasthide {{shifters}} {{can increase}} their natural Armor Class, making them <b>harder</b> <b>to</b> damage, while gaining a bonus to Constitution and therefore extra Hit Points, making them <b>harder</b> <b>to</b> bring down.|$|R
5|$|However, , {{with the}} {{exception}} of Spiroplasma mirum strain SMCA causing spongiform microcystic encephalitis in suckling rats, other researchers have been unable to duplicate these findings, casting doubt on the Spiroplasma hypothesis. In defense of the Spiroplasma hypothesis, Bastian pointed out that Spiroplasma is <b>hard</b> <b>to</b> culture and that strain variation makes it <b>hard</b> <b>to</b> detect certain strains using PCR and other techniques, thus giving a false negative.|$|E
5|$|I {{was playing}} the nice girl. It's really <b>hard</b> <b>to</b> play. All the other {{characters}} came from somebody and I said to Mike , 'Where do I come from?' And he said, 'You were the fantasy girl.' I found it <b>hard</b> <b>to</b> make anything of that. In the end I felt the only thing I could do was {{to make it as}} hyper real as I could. I'm not a natural comedienne.|$|E

50|$|The book's overall theme {{points out}} {{while it is}} {{becoming}} easier to get power, it is also becoming <b>harder</b> <b>to</b> use it to control others and <b>harder</b> <b>to</b> keep it once you have it.|$|R
50|$|Dynamic: Dynamic {{machines}} {{are good at}} maintaining long drifts and are much more capable of controlling more adventurous drifts, but they are <b>harder</b> <b>to</b> recover from drifts and are <b>harder</b> <b>to</b> control than the other categories.|$|R

50|$|The cross {{constrictor}} knot is <b>harder</b> <b>to</b> tighten, <b>harder</b> <b>to</b> untie, more stable, builds more knot height {{than the}} double constrictor knot, more knot width than either constrictor knot or the strangle knot due to 3 turns rather than 2.|$|R
5000|$|Hackers are {{reportedly}} learning their market and changing tactics (i.e., mobile malware) so that operations are <b>harder</b> <b>to</b> trace and <b>harder</b> <b>to</b> shut down. Said markets also include specific countries, since charging practices can vary on either a country or carrier basis.|$|R
30|$|All {{of these}} aspects {{become even more}} {{important}} when offsets are considered. They are <b>harder</b> <b>to</b> identify (both manually and automatically), and the auditory relevance of their deviations is <b>harder</b> <b>to</b> define numerically. For this reason, many AMT systems ignore offsets and only work with onsets.|$|R
5|$|The {{presence}} of a strictly freshwater species on the Seychelles is <b>hard</b> <b>to</b> explain, biogeographically. Several possible explanations have been proposed.|$|E
5|$|The red wattlebird is <b>hard</b> <b>to</b> confuse {{with any}} other species, though in poor {{visibility}} might be mistaken for the spiny-cheeked honeyeater, or little or western wattlebirds.|$|E

5000|$|Changes to stored {{procedures}} are <b>harder</b> <b>to</b> {{keep track of}} within a version control system than other code. Changes must be reproduced as scripts to be stored in the project history to be included, and differences in procedures can be <b>harder</b> <b>to</b> merge and track correctly.|$|R
5000|$|BOPP is a non-fibrous and non-porous polymer. Compared {{with paper}} {{banknotes}}, banknotes made using BOPP are <b>harder</b> <b>to</b> tear, {{more resistant to}} folding, more resistant to soil, waterproof (and washing machine proof), <b>harder</b> <b>to</b> burn, easier to machine process, and are shreddable and recyclable {{at the end of}} their lives.|$|R

5|$|A total {{solar eclipse}} {{provides}} {{a rare opportunity}} to observe the corona (the outer layer of the Sun's atmosphere). Normally this is not visible because the photosphere is much brighter than the corona. According to the point reached in the solar cycle, the corona may appear small and symmetric, or large and fuzzy. It is very <b>hard</b> <b>to</b> predict this in advance.|$|E
5|$|After the war ended, Christy {{accepted}} an assistant professorship at the University of Chicago, at {{a salary of}} $5,000 per annum, twice {{what he had been}} making before the war. He moved back to Chicago in February 1946, but suitable housing was <b>hard</b> <b>to</b> find in the immediate post-war period, and Christy and his family shared a mansion with Edward Teller and his family.|$|E

5|$|Aggressive {{resemblance}} {{is used by}} predators or parasites. In special aggressive resemblance, {{the animal}} looks like something else, luring the prey or host to approach, for example when a flower mantis resembles {{a particular kind of}} flower, such as an orchid. In general aggressive resemblance, the predator or parasite blends in with the background, for example when a leopard is <b>hard</b> <b>to</b> see in long grass.|$|E
5|$|Algebraic K-theory {{is related}} to the group of {{invertible}} matrices with coefficients the given field. For example, the process of taking the determinant of an invertible matrix leads to an isomorphism K1(F) = F. Matsumoto's theorem shows that K2(F) agrees with K2M(F). In higher degrees, K-theory diverges from Milnor K-theory and remains <b>hard</b> <b>to</b> compute in general.|$|E
5|$|Animal {{coloration}} is {{the general}} appearance of an animal resulting from the reflection or emission of light from its surfaces. Some animals are brightly coloured, while others are <b>hard</b> <b>to</b> see. In some species, such as the peafowl, the male has strong patterns, conspicuous colours and is iridescent, while the female is far less visible.|$|E
