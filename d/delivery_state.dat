40|$|This article revisits the {{assumption}} that the welfare <b>delivery</b> <b>state</b> does not fit into the vertical or hierarchical model of political accountability in light of its recent organizational arrangements. Although a distinction in any analytical framework between managerial and political accountability bears some fruit, the replacement of the latter with the former is contestable and misleading. In contrast to the claims that managerial accountability is a technical and neutral exercise in the application of politics-free criteria, and, as such, it more readily fits the complexity of the 21 st-century welfare state, this article suggests that the new organizational arrangements of state schools and hospitals indicate that traditional forms of accountability to elected officials have not withered. The process of developing new welfare state organizational arrangements cannot be divorced from fundamental institutional questions about each democracy. By empirically investigating the effects of the introduction of managerialism on democratic accountability in Britain and Germany, the article aims to further our understanding of the link between the managerial and political dimensions of accountability in the welfare <b>delivery</b> <b>state.</b> Copyright (c) 2007 IIAS, SAGE Publications (Los Angeles, London, New Delhi and Singapore).

The change in exergy from the stratified state to the <b>delivery</b> <b>state</b> depends on the stored energy and the stratification. lt can thus be used to define the storage efficiency for sensible heat storage devices. The effect of temperature distribution, delivery temperature and tank cross section on exergy is investigated. The advantage that stratification offers over a mixed tank is examined in terms of the storage efficiency and overall solar water heating system performance. Exergy is used to assess the operation of mantle heat exchangers in solar water heating systems and it is shown that an exergy, rather than energy, should be used to ascertain the performance of such heat exchangers. ...|$|E

40|$|A high-efficiency {{wireless}} power transfer system which is capable of supporting more than one receiver using class E operation for transmitter via inductive coupling has been designed and fabricated. The design approach of the system is also presented in this paper. The system requires no complex external control system but relies on its natural impedance response to achieve the desired power delivery profile across a wide range of load resistances while maintaining high efficiency to prevent any heating issues. A switch circuit is used to decouple the fully charged receiver from the system so that power delivery to the other receiver can be improved. The fabricated system at 12 [*]V supply voltage is compact and capable of approximately 2. 5 [*]W of power delivery to each of the two receivers in a dual receiver setup and 5 [*]W to a single receiver alone or when the other receiver is decoupled by the receiver switch.

In the <b>delivery</b> <b>state</b> diagram loading is substantially parabolic throughout, while in the martensitic state contains only linear strain hardening step and in the sorbitol state the plastic flow curve is three-step. The velocity of ultrasonic surface waves (Rayleigh waves) was measured simultaneously with the registration of the loading curve in the investigated steel in tension.

40|$|Abstract Background The HIV/AIDS {{pandemic}} in sub-Saharan Africa {{is widely}} recognised as a development disaster threatening poverty reduction, {{economic growth and}} not merely a health issue. Its mitigation includes the societal-wide adoption and implementation of specific health technologies, many of which depend on functional institutions and State. Discussion Donor and International Institutions' strategies to mitigate HIV/AIDS in sub-Saharan Africa are premised on a single optimal model of the State, one which focuses on the decentralised delivery of public goods alone (such as healthcare) – the service <b>delivery</b> <b>state.</b> The empirical evidence, though sparse, of "successful" and "unsuccessful" sub-Saharan Africa states' performance in mitigating HIV/AIDS does not support this model. Rather, the evidence suggests an alternative model that takes a country context specific approach – encompassing political power, institutional structures {{and the level of}} health technology needed. This model draws on the historical experience of East Asian countries' rapid development. Summary For international public health policies to be effective, they must consider a country tailored approach, one that advocates a coordinated strategy designed and led by the State with involvement of wider society specific to each country's particular history, culture, and level of development. </p...|$|E

40|$|Normally, the {{weldability}} {{of aluminum}} alloys is {{ruled by the}} temperature range of solidification of an alloy according to its composition by the formation of hot cracks due to thermal shrinkage. However, for materials at nonequilibrium conditions, advantage can be taken by multiple phase formation, leading to an annihilation of temperature stress at the microscopic scale, preventing hot cracks even for alloys with extreme melting range. In this paper, several spray-compacted hypereutectic aluminum alloys were laser welded. Besides different silicon contents, additional alloying elements like copper, iron and nickel were present in some alloys, affecting the microstructure. The microstructure was investigated at the <b>delivery</b> <b>state</b> of spray-compacted material {{as well as for}} a wide range of welding speeds ranging from 0. 5 to 10 m/min, respectively. The impact of speed on phase composition and morphology was studied at different disequilibrium solidification conditions. At high welding velocity, a close-meshed network of eutectic Al-Si-composition was observed, whereas the matrix is filled with nearly pure aluminum, helping to diminish the thermal stress during accelerated solidification. Primary solidified silicon was found, however, containing considerable amounts of aluminum, which was not expected from phase diagrams obtained at the thermodynamic equilibrium...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{findings from}} an action research project that investigated {{the application of}} Multiple Intelligences (MI) theory in classrooms and schools. It shows how MI theory {{was used in the}} project as a basis for suggestions to generate classroom practices; how participating teachers evaluated the project; and how teachers responded to the professional experience. Teachers reported successful student outcomes including more interest and motivation, better recall and deeper understanding, higher attainment, improved self-esteem, and more fun and enjoyable classroom experiences. For teachers themselves, the project was a challenge. They needed more planning time, more persistence, more collegiality, and more management support. All involved in the project found the experiment worthwhile, exciting, and a stimulus for radical change in their pedagogic practice and thinking. Teachers renamed and extended existing practices to include MI approaches and this led to a methodsshift and, ultimately, to indications of a mind-shift. It was apparent in the Irish MI Project that the premising of curriculum content and <b>delivery,</b> <b>state</b> certificate assessment, school organisational practices, and attitudes on a narrow, untenable and unfair construct of intelligence can result in educational exclusion and disadvantage for many students.

40|$|The {{empirical}} {{study of}} the organisational changes of the State of welfare since the 1980 s in Germany, Britain, France and Italy suggests a convergent and consistent process of homogenisation driven chiefly by institutional mimetic isomorphism. This new ‘organisational settlement’ is increasingly shaped by the structural autonomisation of individual service delivery units. This paper argues that, when organisational autonomy becomes normatively sanctioned, that this {{increases the likelihood of}} its adoption, {{even in the face of}} different institutional conditions and welfare regimes. Hence, the paper is foremost concerned with explaining similarities and decreasing variance across countries and across sectors, and with accounting for the main driver of this homogenisation process. Why would different organisational fields across countries and welfare regimes adopt similar structures, in light of inconclusive evidence of economic efficiency gains? The convergence of the organisational settlement of the welfare <b>delivery</b> <b>state</b> is not only driven by economic globalisation or efficiency linked to performance, but primarily by the political demand to find new sources of legitimation in an age of increasing displacement of political authority to managers. The paper is structured in three main parts. First, it revisits the theory of organisational isomorphism by its application to the new patterns of change of welfare delivery. Secondly, it discusses the reform trajectories of autonomisation in schooling and hospital care in Britain, in comparative terms with France and Italy. Thirdly, it concentrates on Germany and it establishes empirically how this case does no longer fit the characterisation of ‘immobilisme’, especially in the health care sector. Lastly, the wider implications of organisational homogenisation for the TRUDI constellation are discussed...|$|E

40|$|State Departments of Transportation (DOTs) are {{increasingly}} interested in developing new {{strategies for the}} design and construction of transportation projects. As a result, they are adopting more integrated process. Projects that previously used separate steps and parties may now {{be included in a}} single Design-Build system. When making a decision between a traditional Design-Bid-Build delivery system or a more integrated project delivery system like Design-Build, the DOTs consider potential more cost savings, time savings, and quality improvement. In order to maximize success in Design-Build project <b>delivery,</b> <b>state</b> DOTs need {{to pay attention to the}} initial steps, like procurement. DOTs should prepare the procurement phase carefully based on project size, complexity, risks, timing, external factors, environmental issues, selection methods, etc. To assist in improving the success of Design-Build projects, this paper analyzes the relationship between procurement duration and Design-Build project success. Schedule growth, cost growth and total project time growth are used to measure project success in this paper. Linear regression analysis is used to analyze the relationship between procurement duration and each of the three project success factors. The results of the linear regression analyses show that there is a strong linear correlation between procurement duration and schedule growth. The longer the procurement duration, the less the schedule growth as a percent of the total project schedule. However, the research results do not indicate any linear or non linear correlation between procurement duration and cost growth. There is no evidence to indicate that a longer procurement duration will reduce cost growth. The research also shows that the effects of procurement duration on project success are variable based on different selection methods and project complexities. This research strongly suggests that DOTs focus on procurement duration as a way to improve project success. Civil EngineeringMastersUniversity of New Mexico.

40|$|This D. Phil. {{thesis is}} an {{international}} comparative study looking at {{the development and implementation}} stages of policies tasked to reduce emissions from transport. The substance of policy is all too often the primary focus of research, leaving the settings in which these policies are developed and implemented relatively underexplored. Examining the relationships and interplay that exists between departments responsible for climate change and transport at the sub-national (state) level and those with their local and national counterparts, this research tries to unpick the organisational intricacies that may act as barriers to <b>delivery.</b> <b>State</b> governments have become a promising source of action to reduce emissions from other sectors for which they have legislative responsibility; however, the private road transport sector remains a challenge. This research examines the barriers preventing such progress and whether the lack of collaboration between departments and across levels of government are responsible in part for these challenges. Taking a specific policy intervention designed to reduce transport-related emissions from four case study governments (Bavaria, California, Scotland and South Australia) this research is about organisational structures of government and policy processes. The main hypothesis of the research is that conventional environmental/climate change- and transport-policymaking practices are incompatible – and that this incompatibility is hampered by organisational structures of government. Together these factors render implementation of policies to reduce the climate impact of transport difficult. The hypothesis is guided by four research themes – scale, scope, leadership and process. Each of these themes has a distinct yet important part to play in understanding and comparing the case study contexts, in terms of the cross-departmental and cross-level interactions occurring within each of the sub-national governments. Each of the subject case study governments have been chosen since they are self-determined ‘leaders’ on climate change. This research serves to highlight some of the governance issues that need to be overcome or removed for such positive political intent to be realised. It posits that without successfully linking frameworks and interested stakeholders in the process, tangible emissions reductions will be difficult to achieve. The main objective of the research is to investigate the frameworks, interplay and dynamics at the sub-national level of government across departments and between levels of government. The relationship and collaboration with industry is also examined as a supplementary consideration. The second objective is to look at how and whether climate change policy can be more closely integrated with transport policy and the barriers to this integration. This investigation is underpinned by cross-disciplinary governance theory, as well as notions from socio-political governance and applies the concept of institutional interplay in this context between levels of government. It develops the concept of sub-national governance which argues that relationships between levels are distinct and non-hierarchical in terms of policy development and implementation.
