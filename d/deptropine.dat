40|$|Objective: To {{describe}} {{the choice of}} drugs {{as well as the}} dosage forms of anti-asthmatic drugs in children with regard to different age groups. Methods: Cross-sectional study based on computerized pharmacy dispensing records of 1999 for children aged 0 - 16 years in the north of the Netherlands. All children were selected and divided in the following age groups: 0 - 1, 2 - 5, 6 - 11 and 12 - 16 -year-olds. Results: Inhaled beta 2 -agonists and inhaled corticosteroids were the most widely used anti-asthmatic drugs in all age groups (respectively 59 and 58 users per 100 anti-asthmatic using 0 - 16 year-olds). Cromones were rarely used. Up to four years of age the use of treatment with aerosol inhalers increased simultaneously with a decrease of oral dosage forms. The use of dry powder inhalers started at the age of approximately 4 years old and increased to about 85 % of the users at the age of 11, with the strongest increase around the age of 6 and 7. Conclusion: The choice of drugs and dosage forms corresponds with what might be expected based on guidelines for the treatment of asthma in children, except for the high use of <b>deptropine</b> in the youngest age group. Anti-asthmatic drugs for preventive treatment are used so frequently without beta 2 -agonists that questions about possible overtreatment need to be raised...|$|E
40|$|ECGscreening of nevvborns to avoi sudden {{infant death}} {{syndrome}}? I. M. van Langen, A. A. M. Wilde The World Health Organisation defines {{sudden infant death}} syndrome (SIDS) as 'The sudden death ofan infant under one year ofage, which remains unexplained after a thorough case investigation, including performance of a complete autopsy, exam-ination ofthe death scene, and a review ofthe clinical history'. In the Netherlands, a slightly different description of cot death is used, which includes the second year oflife and accepts the lack ofan autopsy, which is not obligatory in our country. From 1996 to 2001, 136 infants died ofcot death and most infants (36 %) died at between three and five months of age. The incidence ofSIDS in the Netherlands has become the lowest ofall Western countries since the start ofthe 'back to sleep ' campaign in 1987, stimulating supine sleeping. In 2000, the most recent year for which comparison is possible, 12 out of 10, 000 babies became SIDS victims in the Netherlands, compared to 78 in Germany, 40 in Norway and 53 in the USA. ' Well-known risk factors for SIDS, besides sleeping in the prone position, are passive smoking, sleeping under a duvet, low birth weight, male sex, the use of certain drugs (promethazine, <b>deptropine,</b> cisapride) and congenital long-QT syndrome (LQTS). LQTS is one of the heritable primary arrhythmia syndromes, virtually all caused by mutations in cardiac ion channel genes. Its incidence is estimated at one in 2000, based on genotyping in newborns with long-QT intervals. 2 Eight genes are currently known t...|$|E
