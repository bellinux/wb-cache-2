5|$|In 2006, Lawrence {{introduced}} Mars to {{his future}} A manager at Atlantic Records, Aaron Bay-Schuck. After <b>hearing</b> <b>him</b> play {{a couple of}} songs on the guitar, Bay-Schuck wanted to sign him immediately, but it took roughly three years for Atlantic records to finally sign Mars to the label, because they felt {{it was too early}} and that he still needed to develop as an artist.|$|E
5|$|The {{artist has}} {{performed}} at political rallies led by Beck, and at campaign rallies for Herman Cain. Her husband joined Cain's presidential campaign as state director for Tennessee after <b>hearing</b> <b>him</b> speak at events where Branch performed. Branch said Cain {{was a natural}} choice {{for her and her}} husband because she felt their beliefs aligned with Cain's. Since 2010, she received three payments that totaled $10,000 for live entertainment services provided at political rallies from several political action committees associated with Cain's campaign.|$|E
5|$|Nomura {{redesigned}} Cloud for {{his appearance}} in Kingdom Hearts. He is depicted with a claw and a crimson cape, and {{the blade of}} his sword is wrapped in bandages. Stating that Cloud's left arm was inspired by Vincent Valentine, Nomura explained {{that he wanted to}} give the character a more demon-like appearance due to his ties to the dark side in the game. Nomura stated that he wanted to leave the question of whether Cloud was searching for Aerith open to the player's interpretation. Teruaki Sugawara, the game's voice director, recommended Takahiro Sakurai, Cloud's Japanese voice actor, to Nomura for the role. Nomura had originally asked Sakurai to play the protagonist of The Bouncer, Sion Barzahd, but found that his voice best suited Cloud after <b>hearing</b> <b>him</b> speak. Sakurai received the script without any accompanying visuals, and first arrived for recording under the impression that he would be voicing a different character than the one featured in Final Fantasy VII.|$|E

25|$|During {{this period}} he could really do no wrong. Loaded with riches and honors, {{he was so}} famous and so {{formidable}} as a performer that his rival and friend, the castrato Gioacchino Conti ("Gizziello") {{is said to have}} fainted away from sheer despondency on <b>hearing</b> <b>him</b> sing. George Frideric Handel was also keen to engage Farinelli for his company in London, and while in Venice in January 1730, tried unsuccessfully to meet him.|$|E

50|$|The phrase <b>hear</b> <b>him,</b> <b>hear</b> <b>him!</b> {{was used}} in Parliament from late in the 17th century, and was reduced to hear! or hear, hear! by the late 18th century. The verb hear had earlier {{been used in the}} King James Bible as a command for others to listen.|$|R
25|$|An account {{preserved}} in Morkinskinna relates that Tryggvi was actually {{killed by a}} farmer after the battle.

After questioning the purported killer and <b>hearing</b> <b>him</b> confess, King Harald had the man hanged, citing the familial bond between him and Tryggvi and his duty to avenge the latter's death.|$|E
25|$|Featherston serves in {{the series}} as an analog to Adolf Hitler. (In , Sgt. Adolf Hitler – never {{explicitly}} named but his identity confirmed by Turtledove - appears as an aide to Lt. Col. Guderian, and after <b>hearing</b> <b>him</b> rant about Jews, an American soldier notes how similar he is to Jake Featherston.) One reviewer, however, {{has pointed out that}} Featherston is not an exact parallel to Hitler and found his image, rhetoric, and propaganda techniques for the most part credibly adapted to the American South.|$|E
25|$|Scott, {{the founder}} and only {{permanent}} member of The Waterboys, {{made a number of}} solo recordings in late 1981 and early 1982 while in a band named Another Pretty Face (later called Funhouse). These sessions at Redshop Studio are the earliest recordings that would be released under The Waterboys name. During the same period, Scott formed the short-lived band The Red and the Black, with saxophone player Anthony Thistlethwaite, after <b>hearing</b> <b>him</b> play on Waiting on Egypt, a Nikki Sudden album. The Red and the Black performed nine concerts in London. Thistlethwaite introduced Scott to drummer Kevin Wilkinson, who joined The Red and the Black. During 1982, Scott made a number of recordings, both solo and with Thistlethwaite and Wilkinson. These recording sessions, both of Scott's solo work and the group performances, would later be divided between The Waterboys' first and second albums.|$|E

25|$|Moving to London in 1545, Bourne {{became a}} prebendary of St Paul's Cathedral, and in 1549 Archdeacon of Bedford with the {{benefice}} of rector of High Ongar in Essex. At the time, {{the holding of}} such preferments involved acceptance of the Church of England as brought into being under King Henry VIII and his son Edward VI. Soon after Queen Mary's accession, while preaching at St Paul's Cross, Bourne narrowly escaped a dagger which a fanatic hurled at him on <b>hearing</b> <b>him</b> allude to Bishop Edmund Bonner's recent sufferings under the previous reign. On being appointed to the Bishopric of Bath and Wells, Bourne received absolution from Cardinal Reginald Pole, the papal legate, by letters dated 17 March 1554, from all censures incurred {{in the time of}} schism, and on 1 April was consecrated with five others by Bishop Bonner, assisted by Bishop Stephen Gardiner and Bishop Cuthbert Tunstall.|$|E

[...] Following the moderately successful Pain in My Heart and The Great Otis Redding Sings Soul Ballads, both of which performed well in the newly established Billboard R LP chart {{but not in the}} Billboard 200, preparations for the third studio album followed soon after. The album would be Redding's third studio album and second on Stax's sister label Volt.|$|E
500|$|Drake was obsessive about practising {{his guitar}} technique, and would often stay {{up through the}} night experimenting with tunings and working on songs. His mother remembered <b>hearing</b> <b>him</b> [...] "bumping around at all hours. I think he wrote his nicest melodies in the early-morning hours." [...] Self-taught, he {{achieved}} his guitar style {{through the use of}} alternative tunings to create cluster chords. These are difficult to achieve on a guitar using standard tuning; Drake used tunings which made cluster chords available using more conventional chord shapes. In many songs he accents the dissonant effect of such non-standard tunings through his vocal melodies.|$|E

500|$|During {{his time}} at KVOW, Jennings was visited by DJ Sky Corbin, who worked at KLVT in Levelland. Corbin was {{impressed}} with his voice, and decided to visit Jennings at the station after <b>hearing</b> <b>him</b> sing a jingle {{to the tune of}} Hank Snow's [...] "I'm Moving On". Jennings expressed his economic struggle to live on a US$50-a-week salary. Corbin invited Jennings to visit KLVT, where he eventually took Corbin's then-vacated position. The Corbin family later purchased KLLL, in Lubbock. They changed the format of the station to Country, becoming the main competition of KDAV. The Corbins hired Jennings as the station's first DJ.|$|E
500|$|At {{some time}} during the night of 24/25 November 1974, Nick Drake died at his home ("Far Leys") in Tanworth-in-Arden, from an {{overdose}} of amitriptyline, a type of antidepressant. He {{had gone to bed}} early after spending the afternoon visiting a friend. His mother said that around dawn he left his room for the kitchen. His family was used to <b>hearing</b> <b>him</b> do this many times before but, during this instance, he did not make a sound. They presumed he was eating a bowl of cereal. He returned to his room a short while later, and took some pills [...] "to help him sleep".|$|E
500|$|Angelou met novelist John Oliver Killens in 1959 and, at his urging, {{moved to}} New York to {{concentrate}} on her writing career. [...] She joined the Harlem Writers Guild, where she met several major African-American authors, including John Henrik Clarke, Rosa Guy, Paule Marshall, and Julian Mayfield, and was published for the first time. [...] In 1960, after meeting civil rights leader Martin Luther King Jr. and <b>hearing</b> <b>him</b> speak, she and Killens organized [...] "the legendary" [...] Cabaret for Freedom to benefit the Southern Christian Leadership Conference (SCLC), and she was named SCLC's Northern Coordinator.

500|$|Jennings {{had invited}} the then unknown Billy Joe Shaver to Nashville {{to write the}} songs for his next album after <b>hearing</b> <b>him</b> sing [...] "Willy the Wandering Gypsy and Me" [...] just before the 1972 Dripping Springs Reunion. [...] When Shaver got to Nashville he spent six months unsuccessfully trying to speak with Jennings, who had {{apparently}} forgotten the invite. Eventually, {{with the help of}} local D.J.

Shaver refused the money and told Jennings {{that he was willing to}} fight him if he would not listen to his songs. In the 2003 documentary Beyond Nashville, Shaver recalls: ...|$|E
500|$|Parliament President [...] John Henry Barrows said, [...] "India, the Mother of {{religions}} {{was represented by}} Swami Vivekananda, the Orange-monk who exercised the most wonderful influence over his auditors". Vivekananda attracted widespread attention in the press, which called him the [...] "cyclonic monk from India". The New York Critique wrote, [...] "He is an orator by divine right, and his strong, intelligent face in its picturesque setting of yellow and orange was hardly less interesting than those earnest words, and the rich, rhythmical utterance he gave them". The New York Herald noted, [...] "Vivekananda is undoubtedly the greatest figure in the Parliament of Religions. After <b>hearing</b> <b>him</b> we feel how foolish it is to send missionaries to this learned nation". American newspapers reported Vivekananda as [...] "the greatest figure in the parliament {{of religions}}" [...] and [...] "the most popular and influential man in the parliament".|$|E
