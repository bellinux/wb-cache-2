The magnetic field around Jupiter emanates {{from a number of}} different sources, including fluid circulation at the planet's core (the <b>internal</b> <b>field),</b> electrical currents in the plasma surrounding Jupiter and the currents flowing at the boundary of the planet's magnetosphere. The magnetosphere is embedded within the plasma of the solar wind, which carries the interplanetary magnetic field.|$|E
5|$|The {{shape of}} Jupiter's {{magnetosphere}} described above is {{sustained by the}} neutral sheet current (also known as the magnetotail current), which flows with Jupiter's rotation through the tail plasma sheet, the tail currents, which flow against Jupiter's rotation at the outer boundary of the magnetotail, and the magnetopause currents (or Chapman–Ferraro currents), which flow against rotation along the dayside magnetopause. These currents create the magnetic field that cancels the <b>internal</b> <b>field</b> outside the magnetosphere. They also interact substantially with the solar wind.|$|E

40|$|The Earth’s <b>internal</b> {{magnetic}} <b>field</b> {{controls to}} a degree the strength, geographic positioning, and structure of currents flowing in the ionosphere and magnetosphere, which produce their own (external) magnetic fields. The secular variation of the Earth’s <b>internal</b> magnetic <b>field</b> can therefore lead to long-term changes in the externally produced magnetic field as well. Here we will examine this more closely. First, we obtain scaling relations to describe how the strength of magnetic perturbations associated with various different current systems in the ionosphere and magnetosphere depends on the <b>internal</b> magnetic <b>field</b> intensity. Second, we discuss how changes in the orientation of a simple dipolar magnetic field will affect the current systems. Third, we use model simulations to study how actual changes in the Earth’s <b>internal</b> magnetic <b>field</b> between 1908 and 2008 have affected some of the relevant current systems.

40|$|A {{thermodynamic}} model is developed to study electrostatic coupling and interface intermixing in superlattices comprising alternate layers of ferroelectrics and paraelectrics. Interface intermixing leads to inhomogeneous <b>internal</b> electric <b>field</b> and polarization in superlattices.

Periodic modulation of the <b>internal</b> electric <b>field</b> and polarization in superlattices are correlated. Interface intermixing enhances the depolarization field of superlattices; however, it has a negligible effect on polarization and transition temperature.

50|$|NMR {{measurements}} of the resonance frequency on YBCO indicated that electrons in the copper oxide superconductors are paired in spin-singlet states. This indication came from {{the behavior of the}} Knight shift, the frequency shift that occurs when the <b>internal</b> <b>field</b> is different from the applied field: In a normal metal, the magnetic moments of the conduction electrons in the neighborhood of the ion being probed align with the applied field and create a larger <b>internal</b> <b>field.</b> As these metals go superconducting, electrons with oppositely directed spins couple to form singlet states. In the anisotropic HTS, perhaps NMR measurements have found that the relaxation rate for copper depends on the direction of the applied static magnetic field, with the rate being higher when the static field is parallel to one of the axes in the copper oxide plane. While this observation by some group supported the d symmetry of the HTS, other groups could not observe it.|$|E
