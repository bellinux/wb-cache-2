5|$|The {{nature of}} inferences {{that can be}} made from the A-not-B error has been challenged.

5|$|Biomedical {{researchers}} <b>have</b> <b>examined</b> <b>the</b> {{applications of}} rhodium compounds and their derivatives {{in medicine and}} reported one potential application for a rhodocene derivative as a radiopharmaceutical to treat small cancers. Rhodocene derivatives are used to synthesise linked metallocenes so that metal–metal interactions can be studied; potential applications of these derivatives include molecular electronics and research into the mechanisms of catalysis. The value of rhodocenes tends {{to be in the}} insights they provide into the bonding and dynamics of novel chemical systems, rather than their applications.|$|E

5|$|Ian Drake, an {{assistant}} professor of Political Science and another critic of the compact, has argued that the constitution both requires and prohibits Congressional approval of the compact. In Drake's view, only a constitutional amendment could make the compact valid. Authors Michael Brody, Jennifer Hendricks, and Bradley Turflinger <b>have</b> <b>examined</b> <b>the</b> compact and concluded that the NPVIC, if successfully enacted, would pass constitutional muster. Brody has put forth a unique theory that the legality of the NPVIC could potentially hinge on the notion that faithless electors are not necessarily obligated to vote for the candidate to whom they are pledged.|$|E

The judiciary has also been called upon to express an opinion on matters relating to the Law. This burning and recurrent question in the country's political dialogue not only reveals but also exacerbates differences of opinion between Israelis.|$|E
