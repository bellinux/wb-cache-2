50|$|This was a four-speed gearbox and clutch, {{operated}} by a <b>hydraulic</b> <b>controller.</b> To change gears, the driver flicked a lever {{behind the steering wheel}} to the next position and eased-up on the accelerator pedal. The <b>hydraulic</b> <b>controller</b> disengaged the clutch, engaged the nominated gear, and re-engaged the clutch. The speed of engagement of the clutch was controlled by a centrifugal regulator sensing engine rpm and driven off the camshaft by a belt, the position of the butterfly valve in the carburettor (i.e., the position of the accelerator), and the brake circuit. When the brake was pressed, the engine idle speed dropped to an rpm below the clutch engagement speed, thus preventing friction while stopped in gear at traffic lights. When the brake was released, the idle speed increased to the clutch dragging speed. The car would then creep forward much like automatic transmission cars. This drop in idle throttle position also caused the car to have more engine drag when the brakes were applied even before the car slowed to the idle speed in gear, preventing the engine from pulling against the brakes. In the event of loss of hydraulic pressure (following loss of system fluid), the clutch would disengage, to prevent driving, while brake pressure reserves would allow safe braking to standstill.|$|E

5000|$|Some {{transmissions}} have a mode {{in which}} the driver has full control of ratios change (either by moving the selector, or {{through the use of}} buttons or paddles), completely overriding the automated function of the <b>hydraulic</b> <b>controller.</b> Such control is particularly useful in cornering, to avoid unwanted upshifts or downshifts that could compromise the vehicle's balance or traction.

With the near-universal prevalence of electronically controlled transmissions, they are comparatively simple and inexpensive, requiring only software changes, and the provision of the actual manual controls for the driver. The amount of true manual control provided is highly variable: some systems will override the driver's selections under certain conditions, generally in the interest of preventing engine damage. Since these gearboxes also have a throttle kickdown switch, it is impossible to fully exploit the engine power at low to medium engine speeds.|$|E

The controller has been ex-perimentally tested to assess its performance in different conditions and operating ranges. The device in all cases has showed good performance by modulating the outlet pressure as expected between two points corre-sponding to the minimum and the maximum flow. The mathematical models of the controller have been im-plemented and solved using the Mathematical software package to represent both steady state and dynamics conditions. The results of the steady state model have been compared with experimental data and showed a good agreement in the magnitude and trends. The steady state model can be used to simulate the behaviour of a PRV and the AQUAI-MOD® <b>hydraulic</b> <b>controller</b> in typical network applications. It can be also used at the design stage and to compute the required adjustments for the minimum and maximum head set points before installing the controller in the field.

40|$|Hydraulic pump/motor {{units have}} {{a wide range of}} commer-cial applications, each {{requiring}} a separate bolt-on <b>hydraulic</b> <b>controller.</b> This paper outlines the results of laboratory feasibility tests, aimed at replacing these hydraulic con-trollers with an electromechanical valve actuated by a universal microprocessor based controller. Since the majority of controller functions include a pressure override capability, the constant pressure override control (CPOC) function has been investigated in detail. The CPOC controller varies the pump flow rate to ensure that the hydraulic pipeline pres-sure remains constant despite variations in load. The micro-processor required an accurate measure of average line pressure. Preliminary tests showed that the axial pump superimposed large synchronous pressure ripples onto this average level. The results show that if careful signal con-ditioning is used to remove this ripple, a microprocessor based control unit can mimic the main control function of existing hydraulic controllers successfully. Design features required for a suitable prototype controller necessary for field trials are discussed. ...|$|E
40|$|Some unknown {{parameter}} estimation of electro-hydraulic system (EHS) {{should be considered}} in <b>hydraulic</b> <b>controller</b> design due to many parameter uncertainties in practice. In this study, a parametric adaptive backstepping control method is proposed to improve the dynamic behavior of EHS under parametric uncertainties and unknown disturbance (i. e., hydraulic parameters and external load). The unknown parameters of EHS model are estimated by the parametric adaptive estimation law. Then the recursive backstepping controller is designed by Lyapunov technique to realize the displacement control of EHS. To avoid explosion of virtual control in traditional backstepping, a decayed memory filter is presented to re-estimate the virtual control and the dynamic external load. The effectiveness of the proposed controller has been demonstrated by comparison with the controller without adaptive and filter estimation. The comparative experimental results in critical working conditions indicate the proposed approach can achieve better dynamic performance on the motion control of Two-DOF robotic arm...|$|E

30|$|Prior {{research}} purports {{that the}} frictional {{effect can be}} suppressed using adaptive control [6, 7]; however, adaptive control requires significant tuning parameters and is quite difficult to implement. For practical implementation, <b>hydraulic</b> <b>controllers</b> should be easy to design. Feedback modulators (FMs) have been successfully implemented in a hydraulic system to suppress static friction [8]. When an FM’s minimum force is set to exceed the maximum static frictional force, systems are then free from static friction. However, FMs cannot suppress disturbances caused by gravity, viscosity, modeling errors, etc. Disturbance observers (DOBs) can instead be used to suppress these types of disturbances [9 – 11]. However, DOBs generate residual oscillation if the static friction is large. Yao et al. proposed an extended state observer to compensate for disturbances in hydraulic systems [12]. However, the controller was designed for open hydraulic circuits. To address these issues, we proposed a new controller that integrates FMs and DOBs [13]. In the previously proposed controller, FMs are only activated in the low-speed domain and DOB compensation value updates are concurrently suspended. The previously proposed controller offers three advantages: (1) in the low-speed domain, the FMs eliminate frictional effects; (2) in other speed domains, DOBs operate as normal; (3) the design is simple and does not require strict parameter tuning.|$|R
40|$|This study {{examined}} and compared two energy storage technologies, i. e. batteries and pumped hydro storage (PHS), for the renewable energy powered microgrid {{power supply system}} on a remote island in Hong Kong. The problems of energy storage for off-grid renewable energy were analyzed. The sizing methods and economic models were developed, and finally applied in the real project (case study). The results provide the most suitable energy storage scheme for local decision-makers. The two storage schemes were further divided into 4 options. Accordingly, the life-cycle costs (LCC), levelized costs for the renewable energy storage system (LCRES) and the LCC ratios between all options were calculated and compared. It {{was found that the}} employment of conventional battery (Option 2) had a higher LCC value than the advanced deep cycle battery (Option 1), indicating that using deep cycle batteries is more suitable for a standalone renewable power supply system. The pumped storage combined with battery bank option (Option 3) had only 55 % LCC of that of Option 1, making this combined option more cost-competitive than the sole battery option. The economic benefit of pumped storage is even more significant in the case of purely pumped storage with a <b>hydraulic</b> <b>controller</b> (Option 4), with the lowest LCC among all options at 29 - 48 % of Option 1. Sensitivity analysis demonstrates that PHS is even more cost competitive by controlling some adjustments such as increasing energy storage capacity and days of autonomy. Therefore, the renewable energy system coupled with pumped storage presents technically feasible opportunities and practical potential for continuous power supply in remote areas.

When a higher pressure is applied to one end of the bore and a lower pressure to the other end, the piston moves in response to the pressure differential and drives a valve attached to it.
