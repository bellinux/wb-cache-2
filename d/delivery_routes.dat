5|$|Harding {{retired in}} 1859 and was succeeded {{by his son}} William White Harding, who had become a partner three years earlier. William Harding changed {{the name of the}} {{newspaper}} to its current name, The Philadelphia Inquirer. Harding, in an attempt to increase circulation, cut the price of the paper, began <b>delivery</b> <b>routes</b> and had newsboys sell papers on the street. In 1859, circulation had been around 7,000; by 1863 it had increased to 70,000. Part of the increase was due to the interest in news during the American Civil War. Twenty-five to thirty thousand copies of The Inquirer were often distributed to Union soldiers during the war and several times the U.S. government asked The Philadelphia Inquirer to issue a special edition specifically for soldiers. The Philadelphia Inquirer supported the Union, but Harding wanted their coverage to remain neutral. Confederate generals often sought copies of the paper, believing that the newspaper's war coverage was accurate.|$|E

Most of these contracts stretch beyond 2025–2030 and obligations to these contracts remain despite the crisis. Thus European countries can do little in the short-medium term in the ways of diversification away from Russian gas, but diversification of <b>delivery</b> <b>routes</b> away from Ukraine could potentially be achieved within a few years via projects such as the South Stream and Nord Stream pipeline systems.|$|E

They also maintained an efficient postal service nicknamed the hot-foot relay, which featured thousands of postal officers managed by the central government. [...] Postal clerks kept records of dispatches, and postal stations maintained a staff of cantonal officers who guarded mail <b>delivery</b> <b>routes.</b> After the Song period, the Yuan dynasty transformed the postal system into a more militarized organization, with couriers managed under controllers. This system persisted from the 14th century until the 19th century, when the telegraph and modern road-building were introduced to China from the West.|$|E

The arrival {{of these types of}} chemical plants to inhabited parts of the city provoked public criticism of the new technology. This was also directed at poisonous effluent generated by the plant operations. These harsh critiques were especially fierce once accidental explosions occurred at some plants. Accum, who by this point was a leading proponent of gaslight in addition to his work as a chemist, strongly refuted these criticisms in his writings. Through careful analysis he showed that as a whole, accidents were caused by carelessness of plant workerman rather than problems with the technology, and were therefore avoidable.|$|E

On August 13, Secretary of Labor Alexis Herman privately intervened in the strike {{with the support of}} President Clinton, and was able to get the two sides talking again. Carey and the Teamsters also undertook a sophisticated public relations effort. They depicted the union members as average people (the union's spokespeople were often rank and file Teamsters), and mobilized the public's sympathy for UPS drivers by having strikers drive their regular <b>delivery</b> <b>routes</b> to give their customers information about the strike. They also made strategic use of the Internet, using the union's Web site to issue updates and put pressure on Congress. UPS also engaged in a strong public relations effort (using full-page newspaper advertisements and pressuring customers to ask the President to invoke Taft-Hartley), but most observers as well as some UPS officials agreed that the union had the better P.R. effort. A Gallup poll found that 55 percent of respondents supported the union.|$|E

Phil Foster is the owner and manager of Phil Foster Ranches, a 252 -acre organic vegetable, fruit, and nut farm in the Central Coast Valley of California. Until the last few years, most of the sales were to a number of produce brokers who sold the produce for Phil in the wholesale market on a commission basis. Believing he could get better prices by selling direct to retailers, two years ago Phil started a local <b>delivery</b> <b>route</b> to small grocery stores wishing to sell organic produce. The <b>delivery</b> <b>route</b> has enjoyed success, but now requires significant additional investment of both time and money {{if it is to be}} maintained and expanded.

5000|$|Despite the {{geographic}} derivation of most ZIP Codes, the codes themselves {{do not represent}} geographic regions; in general, they correspond to address groups or <b>delivery</b> <b>routes.</b> As a consequence, ZIP Code [...] "areas" [...] can overlap, be subsets of each other, or be artificial constructs with no geographic area (such as 095 for mail to the Navy, which is not geographically fixed). In similar fashion, in areas without regular postal routes (rural route areas) or no mail delivery (undeveloped areas), ZIP Codes are not assigned or are based on sparse <b>delivery</b> <b>routes,</b> and hence the boundary between ZIP Code areas is undefined. For example, some residents in or near Haubstadt, Indiana, which has the ZIP Code 47639, have mailing addresses with 47648, the ZIP Code for neighboring Fort Branch, Indiana, while others living in or near Fort Branch have addresses with 47639.
