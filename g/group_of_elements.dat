5|$|Palladium is a {{chemical}} element with symbolPd and atomic number 46. It {{is a rare}} and lustrous silvery-white metal discovered in 1803 by William Hyde Wollaston. He named it after the asteroid Pallas, which was itself named after the epithet of the Greek goddess Athena, acquired by her when she slew Pallas. Palladium, platinum, rhodium, ruthenium, iridium and osmium form a <b>group</b> <b>of</b> <b>elements</b> {{referred to as the}} platinum group metals (PGMs). These have similar chemical properties, but palladium has the lowest melting point and is the least dense of them.|$|E
5|$|Platinum is {{a member}} of the {{platinum}} <b>group</b> <b>of</b> <b>elements</b> and group 10 of the periodic table of elements. It has six naturally occurring isotopes. It is one of the rarer elements in Earth's crust, with an average abundance of approximately 5μg/kg. It occurs in some nickel and copper ores along with some native deposits, mostly in South Africa, which accounts for 80% of the world production. Because of its scarcity in Earth's crust, only a few hundred tonnes are produced annually, and given its important uses, it is highly valuable and is a major precious metal commodity.|$|E

5|$|The first {{element of}} the actinides, {{actinium}} gave the group its name, much as lanthanum had done for the lanthanides. The <b>group</b> <b>of</b> <b>elements</b> is more diverse than the lanthanides and therefore {{it was not until}} 1928 that Charles Janet proposed the most significant change to Dmitri Mendeleev's periodic table since the recognition of the lanthanides, by introducing the actinides, a move suggested again in 1945 by Glenn T. Seaborg.|$|E
5|$|Group 3 is a <b>group</b> <b>of</b> <b>elements</b> in the {{periodic}} table. This group, like other d-block groups, should contain four elements, {{but it is}} not agreed what elements belong in the group. Scandium (Sc) and yttrium (Y) are always included, but the other two spaces are usually occupied by lanthanum (La) and actinium (Ac), or by lutetium (Lu) and lawrencium (Lr); less frequently, it is considered the group should be expanded to 32 elements (with all the lanthanides and actinides included) or contracted to contain only scandium and yttrium. When the group is understood to contain all of the lanthanides, its trivial name is the rare-earth metals.|$|E
5|$|Manganese {{is part of}} {{the iron}} <b>group</b> <b>of</b> <b>elements,</b> which are thought to be {{synthesized}} in large stars shortly before the supernova explosion. 53Mn decays to 53Cr with a half-life of 3.7 million years. Because of its relatively short half-life, 53Mn is relatively rare, produced by cosmic rays impact on iron. Manganese isotopic contents are typically combined with chromium isotopic contents and have found application in isotope geology and radiometric dating. Mn–Cr isotopic ratios reinforce the evidence from 26Al and 107Pd for the early history of the solar system. Variations in 53Cr/52Cr and Mn/Cr ratios from several meteorites suggest an initial 53Mn/55Mn ratio, which indicates that Mn–Cr isotopic composition must result from in situ decay of 53Mn in differentiated planetary bodies. Hence, 53Mn provides additional evidence for nucleosynthetic processes immediately before coalescence of the solar system.|$|E

40|$|To assess, analyse {{and control}} complex {{processes}} and phenomena, {{the knowledge of}} their inherent structure is needed. The structures describing it are hierarchical {{because there is a}} subordinating relationship between their <b>elements</b> and <b>groups</b> <b>of</b> <b>elements.</b> The formation <b>of</b> the structure of a particular process or phenomenon commences by grouping its elements into relational groups. If the number <b>of</b> <b>elements</b> in a <b>group</b> is too large, an additional hierarchical level is formed. If the number <b>of</b> <b>groups</b> <b>of</b> <b>elements</b> is too large, yet another level is added to reduce this number.

5|$|The bulk {{properties}} of astatine {{are not known}} with any certainty. Many {{of them have been}} estimated based on the element's position on the periodic table as a heavier analog of iodine, {{and a member of the}} halogens (the <b>group</b> <b>of</b> <b>elements</b> including fluorine, chlorine, bromine, and iodine). Astatine is likely to have a dark or lustrous appearance and may be a semiconductor or possibly a metal; it probably has a higher melting point than that of iodine. Chemically, several anionic species of astatine are known and most of its compounds resemble those of iodine. It also shows some metallic behavior, including being able to form a stable monatomic cation in aqueous solution (unlike the lighter halogens).|$|E
25|$|Recall {{from the}} {{previous}} section {{that there is a}} homomorphism from the Clifford group onto the orthogonal group. We define the special orthogonal group to be the image of Γ0. If K does not have characteristic 2 this is just the <b>group</b> <b>of</b> <b>elements</b> of the orthogonal group of determinant 1. If K does have characteristic 2, then all elements of the orthogonal group have determinant 1, and the special orthogonal group is the set of elements of Dickson invariant 0.|$|E
500|$|Ramsay {{continued}} {{to search for}} these gases using the method of fractional distillation to separate liquid air into several components. In 1898, he discovered the elements krypton, neon, and xenon, and named them after the Greek words [...] ( [...] , [...] "hidden"), [...] ( [...] , [...] "new"), and [...] ( [...] , [...] "stranger"), respectively. Radon was first identified in 1898 by Friedrich Ernst Dorn, and was named radium emanation, but was not considered a noble gas until 1904 when its characteristics {{were found to be}} similar to those of other noble gases. Rayleigh and Ramsay received the 1904 Nobel Prizes in Physics and in Chemistry, respectively, for their discovery of the noble gases; in the words of J. E. Cederblom, then president of the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences, [...] "the discovery of an entirely new <b>group</b> <b>of</b> <b>elements,</b> of which no single representative had been known with any certainty, is something utterly unique in the history of chemistry, being intrinsically an advance in science of peculiar significance".|$|E
50|$|In {{these cases}} the {{requirement}} of a surjective &fnof; means that every label {{is to be used}} at least once, respectively that every <b>element</b> <b>of</b> X be included in the selection at least once. Such a requirement is less natural to handle mathematically, and indeed the former case is more easily viewed first as a <b>grouping</b> <b>of</b> <b>elements</b> <b>of</b> N, with in addition a labelling <b>of</b> the <b>groups</b> by the <b>elements</b> <b>of</b> X.|$|R
40|$|It is {{well known}} that the {{performances}} of the acoustic imaging arrays are degraded by the inter-element coupling sustained via the backing, the matching layers, and the kerf filler. In this work the effect of the cross-coupling due to the backing, and the matching layers is investigated. A hybrid experimental-numerical technique is used. We built several arrays with and without matching layers, and using a classical backing material; on every piezoelectric element we built-in a probe of small dimensions, in order to capture the waveform on its emitting surfaces. In order to evidence the backing contribution to the coupling, every array is divided in two <b>groups</b> <b>of</b> <b>elements</b> and in one group the kerf-filling material was not inserted. The cross-coupling waveforms were recorded for all the <b>groups</b> <b>of</b> <b>elements</b> when: only the central <b>element</b> <b>of</b> the <b>group</b> was driven; all the elements were driven with the same pulse applied at the same time; the elements were phased excited. Fourier transforming the temporal signals, the cross-coupling transfer function <b>of</b> each <b>element</b> was computed and the radiation pattern simulated by means of a numerical model based on the Rayleigh-Sommerfeld integral. A comparison among the radiation patterns for all the <b>groups</b> <b>of</b> <b>elements,</b> for the above mentioned cases, is presented...|$|R

500|$|An {{analogous}} {{case is that}} of the screwball comedy, {{widely accepted}} by film historians as constituting a [...] "genre": the screwball is defined not by a fundamental attribute, but by a general disposition and a <b>group</b> <b>of</b> <b>elements,</b> some—but rarely and perhaps never all—of which are found in each of the genre's films. Because of the diversity of noir (much greater than that of the screwball comedy), certain scholars in the field, such as film historian Thomas Schatz, treat it as not a genre but a [...] "style". Alain Silver, the most widely published American critic specializing in film noir studies, refers to film noir as a [...] "cycle" [...] and a [...] "phenomenon", even as he argues that it has—like certain genres—a consistent set of visual and thematic codes. Other critics treat film noir as a [...] "mood", characterize it as a [...] "series", or simply address a chosen set of films they regard as belonging to the noir [...] "canon". There is no consensus on the matter.|$|E
60|$|The next <b>group</b> <b>of</b> <b>elements</b> in the man-making {{complex that}} occurs to {{one after the}} home, is the school. Let me repeat a {{distinction}} already drawn between the home element in boarding-schools and the school proper. While the child {{is out of the}} school-room, playing--except when it is drilling or playing under direction--when it is talking with its playmates, walking, sleeping, eating, it is under those influences that it has been convenient for me to speak of as the home influence. The schoolmaster who takes boarders is, I hold, merely a substitute for the parent, the household of boarders merely a substitute for the family. What is meant by school here, is that which is possessed in common by day school and boarding-school--the schoolroom and the recess playground part. It is something which the savage and the barbarian distinctively do not possess as a phase in their making, and scarcely even its rudimentary suggestion. It is a new element correlated with the establishment of a wider political order and with the use of written speech.|$|E

50|$|The {{chemical}} {{state of}} an element is often confused with its oxidation state. The chemical state of an element or a <b>group</b> <b>of</b> <b>elements</b> {{that has a}} non-zero ionic charge, e.g. (1+), (2+), (3+), (1-), (2-) (3-), {{is defined as the}} oxidation state of that element or <b>group</b> <b>of</b> <b>elements.</b> Elements or chemical groups that have an ionic charge can usually be dissolved to form ions in either water or another polar solvent. Such a compound or salt is described as an ionic compound with ionic bonds which means that, in effect, all of the electron density of one or more valence electrons has been transferred from the less electronegative <b>group</b> <b>of</b> <b>elements</b> to the more electronegative <b>group</b> <b>of</b> <b>elements.</b> In the case of a non-ionic compound the chemical bonds are non-ionic such meaning the compound will probably not dissolve in water or another polar solvent. Many non-ionic compounds have chemical bonds that share the electron density that binds them together. This type of chemical bond is either a non-polar covalent bond or a polar covalent bond.|$|E
