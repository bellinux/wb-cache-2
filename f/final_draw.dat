25|$|Casket (or the $2 Casket) was {{the name}} given to the draw lottery {{administered}} by Queensland's lottery operator, Golden Casket. The {{name of the game}} dates back to the first Queensland draw lotteries – with cash prizes originally prohibited by law, the first prize was awarded as a casket of gold valued at a certain amount, which was then immediately bought back from winners for its cash value. The first Casket draw was held on 14 June 1917, with the <b>final</b> <b>draw</b> (Draw 301) held on 3 April 2013.|$|E
25|$|Although it was {{reported}} in the build-up to the <b>final</b> <b>draw</b> that seedings would be used, as had been the case at the previous two World Cup Finals, the FIFA Organising Committee ultimately announced {{that there would be no}} seeding of teams. Instead the sixteen teams were divided into four 'geographical groupings', which also took into account the teams' strengths and even political considerations; the system ensured that Israel and Morocco would not be drawn to face each other after Morocco had earlier threatened to withdraw from the tournament, as they had done from the Olympic football tournament two years earlier, if that were the case.|$|E
25|$|The tournament {{took place}} from 9 to 19 July 2015 at Praia da Baía in Espinho, Portugal, after the country's bid was {{selected}} by the FIFA Executive Committee on 28 May 2013, from among twelve proposals.

Fifteen teams advanced through their respective continental qualification competitions to join the host team in the final tournament. The <b>final</b> <b>draw</b> occurred on 28 April 2015 at the Espinho Multimedia Auditorium, setting up a total of 32 matches that were played at the Espinho Stadium – a purpose-built temporary venue with a capacity of 3,500 – and attended by a total of 96,300 people.|$|E

25|$|The {{framework}} of the 2000 FIFA Club World Championship was laid years in advance. According to Sepp Blatter, {{the idea of the}} tournament was presented to the Executive Committee in December 1993 in Las Vegas, USA, by A.C. Milan president Silvio Berlusconi. Initially, there were nine candidates to host the competition, of which only Saudi Arabia, Mexico, Brazil and Uruguay confirmed their interest to FIFA. On 3 September 1997, FIFA selected Brazil to host the competition, which was initially scheduled to take place in 1999. The competition gave away US$28 million in prize money and its TV rights, worth US$40 million, were sold to 15 broadcasters across five continents. The <b>final</b> <b>draw</b> of the first Club World Championship was done on 19 October 1999 at the Copacabana Palace Hotel in Rio de Janeiro.|$|E
25|$|Three nations bid for host duties: United States,Brazil, andMorocco. The {{vote was}} held in Zurich on 4 July 1988, and only took one round with the United States bid {{receiving}} a little {{over half of the}} votes by the Exco members. FIFA hoped that by staging the world's most prestigious tournament there, it would lead to a growth of interest in the sport. One condition FIFA imposed was the creation of a professional soccer league - Major League Soccer was founded in 1993 and began operating in 1996. There was some initial controversy about awarding the World Cup to a country where soccer was not a nationally popular sport, and at the time, in 1988, the U.S. did not have a professional league of its own anymore; the North American Soccer League, set up in the 1970s, had folded in 1984 after fading attendance figures. Despite the controversy, the U.S. staged a hugely successful tournament, with average attendance of nearly 69,000 breaking a record that surpassed the 1966 FIFA World Cup average attendance of 51,000, thanks to the large seating capacities the stadiums in the United States provided for the spectators in comparison to the smaller venues of Europe and Latin America. To this day, the total attendance for the final tournament of nearly 3.6million remains the highest in World Cup history, despite the expansion of the competition from 24 to 32 teams at the 1998 World Cup in France. Germany, Brazil, Argentina, Belgium, Italy, and the United States were seeded for the <b>final</b> <b>draw</b> that took place in Las Vegas, Nevada, on 19 December 1993.|$|E

Roteiro was the first official tournament football to employ the new thermal-bonding technique in its production, {{which resulted in a}} seamless surface and a more homogenous design. Portuguese Football Federation president Gilberto Madaíl praised the ball, stating: [...] "Adidas has delivered a stunning, modern and state-of the-art Portuguese football. This is very much how we envisage the UEFA Euro 2004 event to be". Roteiro was also used at the 2004 AFC Asian Cup, and during the mid-season of the 2004–05 German Bundesliga.|$|E
