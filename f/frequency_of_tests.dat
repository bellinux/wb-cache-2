5|$|Test cricket {{is played}} between {{international}} cricket teams who are Full Members of the International Cricket Council (ICC). Unlike One Day Internationals, Test matches consist of two innings per team, having no limit in their number of overs. Test cricket is first-class cricket, so statistics and records set in Test matches are also counted toward first-class records. The duration of Tests, currently limited to five days, has varied through Test history, ranging from {{three days to}} timeless matches. The earliest match now recognised as a Test was played between England and Australia in March 1877; since then there have been over 2,000 Tests played by 11 teams. The <b>frequency</b> <b>of</b> <b>Tests</b> has steadily increased {{partly because of the}} increase in the number of Test-playing countries, and partly as cricket boards seek to maximise their revenue.|$|E
50|$|The {{atmospheric}} tests conducted {{throughout the}} 1950s were {{critical to the}} definition of nuclear weapons effects for the design of survivable U.S. offensive and defensive weapons systems.

In early nuclear test series, the USAF assembled one Air Task Group per test to perform air support and missions. The <b>frequency</b> <b>of</b> <b>tests</b> and these issues justified a permanent group, and the USAF looked to AFSWC to fill the requirements.

40|$|Abstract: Secondary school {{tests are}} very {{important}} component of the student’s assessment process and their frequency {{is directly related to the}} success of year examinations. On the other hand, the number of students could restrict the <b>frequency</b> <b>of</b> <b>tests</b> that is not desirable in terms of quality educations. Obviously such a dilemma is a challenging methodological and technological problem. In such cases a Multiple Choice test paper could be the only feasible solution, taking into account staff and time constraints. There are a few ways of marking such papers, mainly: a fully manual procedure with preset answer sheets (punched templates); fully automated marking process, applying optical character recognition (OCR) and scanners; the use of special pens and answer sheets could reduce to a certain extent the human factor involvement. The first case is time consuming, error prone and the stress under which the staff involved is working, contributes additionally to the relatively low quality of marking. The other two techniques require additional investment and technological infrastructure, but the marking process is significantly improved (Mogey, N. Watt, H. 2009).

TAT titers of 1, 253 sera tested in both laboratories were compared. In one laboratory, 1, 270 sera were tested by the TAT and SAT, while the other laboratory tested 1, 261 sera by both methods.

40|$|BACKGROUND: Given the {{controversy}} of selecting a diagnostic and treatment approach for the febrile child {{at risk for}} occult bacteremia, {{the purpose of this}} study is to survey the diagnostic and treatment strategies chosen by pediatricians for a febrile child at risk for occult bacteremia seen in three different settings (private office, emergency department, their own child) to see if any differences exist. STUDY DESIGN: Survey of pediatricians given a case scenario of a febrile female child without a source of the fever presenting in three different clinical settings: 1) Office. 2) Emergency Department (E. D.). 3) Pediatrician's daughter. RESULTS: 138 pediatrician surveys were tabulated. Pediatricians ordered the most tests and empiric antibiotic treatments in the E. D., the fewest tests and empiric antibiotic treatments on their daughter, and intermediate <b>frequency</b> <b>of</b> <b>tests</b> and empiric antibiotic treatments in the office. Roughly half the pediatricians ordered the same level of tests in all three clinical settings, while the other half varied their test ordering in the different clinical settings. CONCLUSION: The clinical setting has an effect on the diagnostic and treatment strategies chosen when evaluating a febrile child at risk for occult bacteremia with patients seen in the E.

The study {{is based on the}} results of comprehensive studies conducted in 122 patients with nosocomial urinary tract infection, detected in 823 patients with urolithiasis treated by various methods. A cohort of 823 patients is isolated from 2688 patients treated without at admission signs of infections in the urinary tract for the period 2011 – 2014. All patients were treated at the Urological department of Avicenna Tajik State Medical University in the Republican Clinical Center of Urology. Main results. By the method of randomly selected 823 medical records of patients with urolithiasis various operations we carried out with 122 patients revealed cases of nosocomial infections.

To better understand the current practice {{as it pertains to}} exercise testing, a self-administered questionnaire was distributed to 25 pediatric lung transplant centers within the IPLTC across Australia, Europe, and North America. All centers perform standardized exercise tests. Fifteen centers perform one single-field test (6 MWT/ 12 MWT), while seven perform a six-min walk plus an additional test: SWT (N = 1), 3 MST (N = 1), and CPET (N = 5). <b>Frequency</b> <b>of</b> <b>testing</b> is markedly different among centers.

40|$|Introduction: HIV {{self-testing}} (HIVST) is {{a discreet}} and convenient {{way to reach}} people with HIV {{who do not know}} their status, including many who may not otherwise test. To inform World Health Organization (WHO) guidance, we assessed the effect of HIVST on uptake and <b>frequency</b> <b>of</b> <b>testing,</b> as well as identification of HIV-positive persons, linkage to care, social harm, and risk behaviour. Methods: We systematically searched for studies comparing HIVST to standard HIV testing until 1 June 2016. Meta-analyses of studies reporting comparable outcomes were conducted using a random-effects model for relative risks (RR) and 95 % confidence intervals. The quality of evidence was evaluated using GRADE. Results: After screening 638 citations, we identified five randomized controlled trials (RCTs) comparing HIVST to standard HIV testing services among 4, 145 total participants from four countries. All offered free oral-fluid rapid tests for HIVST and were among men. Meta-analysis of three RCTs showed HIVST doubled uptake <b>of</b> <b>testing</b> among men (RR =  2. 12; 95 % CI: 1. 51, 2. 98). Meta-analysis of two RCTs among {{men who have sex with}} men showed <b>frequency</b> <b>of</b> <b>testing</b> nearly doubled (Rate ratio =  1. 88; 95 % CI: 1. 17; 3. 01), resulting in two more tests in a 12 – 15 -month period (Mean difference =  2. 13; 95 % CI: 1. 59, 2. 66). Meta-analysis of two RCTs showed HIVST also doubled the likelihood of an HIV-positive diagnosis (RR =  2. 02; 95 % CI: 0. 37, 10. 76, 5. 32). Across all RCTs, there was no indication of harm attributable to HIVST and potential increases in risk-taking behaviour appeared to be minimal. Conclusions: HIVST is associated with increased uptake and <b>frequency</b> <b>of</b> <b>testing</b> in RCTs. Such increases, particularly among those at risk who may not otherwise test, will likely identify more HIV-positive individuals as compared to standard testing services alone. However, further research on how to support linkage to confirmatory testing, prevention, treatment and care services is needed. WHO now recommends HIVST as an additional HIV testing approach...|$|R
40|$|This study {{aimed to}} examine the gender and age {{differences}} of the quantitative osteo-sono assessment index (OSI) {{and the effects of}} the past and present lifestyle and nutrition habits on OSI in adult males and females from 20 to 70 years of age. The subjects were 155 males (20 - 79 years) and 399 females (20 - 78 years). The bone mass was estimated by the right-calcaneal OSI using an ultrasonic transmission method with an AOS- 100 device (ALOKA). The <b>frequency</b> <b>of</b> <b>tests</b> for OSI in women tended to increase rapidly in the 50 - 70 age group requiring close examination or guidance. In 50 - 70 year- old females, the proportion of dairy products and vitamin D intake in the past (junior high school and high school days) was significantly lower in the group requiring close examination or guidance (OSI < 2. 428) than in the normal group (OSI ≧ 2. 428). That is, there was insufficient calcium intake (through dairy products) and vitamin D intake, which is instrumental in calcium absorption, (through fish, chicken eggs, and fungi) during puberty, when bone mass increases with skeletal growth. In conclusion, the number in the group requiring close examination or guidance was high for 50 - 70 year-old males and females. The OSI decreases rapidly in females after their 50 s and the number in the group requiring close examination or guidance increased rapidly...|$|E

Design: Retrospective cohort analysis of computerized laboratory data (complete blood count, sodium, potassium, and creatinine levels, prothrombin time, and partial thromboplastin time). Setting: Urban tertiary care Veterans Affairs Hospital. Patients: Consecutive sample of 1109 patients who had elective surgery in 1988. Measurements and Main Results: At admission, 7549 preopera-tive tests were done, 47 % of which duplicated tests performed in the previous year. Of 3096 previous results that were normal as defined by hospital reference range and done closest to the time of but before admission (median interval, 2 months), 13 (0. 4 %; 95 % CI, 0. 2 % to 0. 7 %), repeat values were outside a range considered acceptable for surgery. Most of the abnormalities were predictable from the patient's history, and most were not noted in the medical record. Of 461 previous tests that were abnormal, 78 (17 %; CI, 13 % to 20 %) repeat values at admission were outside a range considered acceptable for surgery (P < 0. 001, frequency of clinically important abnormalities of patients with normal previous results with those with abnormal previous results). Conclusions: Physicians evaluating patients preoperatively could safely substitute the previous test results analyzed in this study for preoperative screening tests if the previous tests are normal and no obvious indication for retesting is present...|$|E
40|$|Abstract Background Deficiencies in {{the quality}} of {{diabetes}} and hypertension primary care and outcomes have been documented in Barbados. This study aimed to explore the knowledge, attitudes and practices, and the barriers faced by people with diabetes and hypertension in Barbados that might contribute to these deficiencies. Methods Five structured focus groups were conducted for randomly selected people with diabetes and hypertension. Results Twenty-one patients (5 diabetic, 5 hypertensive, and 11 with both diseases) {{with a mean age of}} 59 years attended 5 focus group sessions. Patient factors that affected care included the difficulty in maintaining behaviour change. Practitioner factors included not considering the "whole person" and patient expectations, and not showing enough respect for patients. Health care system factors revolved around the amount of time spent accessing care because of long waiting times in public sector clinics and pharmacies. Society related barriers included the high cost and limited availability of appropriate food, the availability of exercise facilities, stigma of disease and difficulty taking time off work. Attendees were not familiar with guidelines for diabetes and hypertension management, but welcomed a patient version detailing a place to record results, the <b>frequency</b> <b>of</b> <b>tests,</b> and blood pressure and blood glucose targets. Appropriate education from practitioners during consultations, while waiting in clinic, through support and education groups, and for the general public through the schools, mass media and billboards were recommended. Conclusions Primary care providers should take a more patient centred approach to the care of those with diabetes and hypertension. The care system should provide better service by reducing waiting times. Patient self-management could be encouraged by a patient version of care guidelines and greater educational efforts. </p...|$|E

40|$|Background: Patient-given global {{ratings are}} {{frequently}} interpreted as summary {{measures of the}} patient perspective, with limited understanding of what these ratings summarize. Global ratings may be determined by patient experiences on priority aspects of care. Objectives: (i) identify patient priorities regarding elements of care for breast cancer, hip- or knee surgery, cataract surgery, rheumatoid arthritis and diabetes, (ii) establish whether experiences regarding priorities are associated with patient-given global ratings, and (iii) determine whether patient experiences regarding priorities are better predictors of global ratings than experiences concerning less important aspects of care. Setting and participants: Data collected {{for the development of}} five consumer quality index surveys – disease-specific questionnaires that capture patient experiences and priorities – were used. Results: Priorities varied: breast cancer patients for example, prioritized rapid access to care and diagnostics, while diabetics favoured dignity and appropriate <b>frequency</b> <b>of</b> <b>tests.</b> Experiences regarding priorities were inconsistently related to global ratings of care. Regression analyses indicated that demographics explain 2. 4 – 8. 4 % of the variance in global rating. Introducing patient experiences regarding priorities increased the variance explained to 21. 1 – 35. 1 %; models with less important aspects of care explained 11. 8 – 23. 2 %. Conclusions: Some experiences regarding priorities are strongly related to the global rating while others are poorly related. Global ratings are marginally dependent on demographics, and experiences regarding priorities are somewhat better predictors of global rating than experiences regarding less important elements. As it remains to be fully determined what global ratings summarize, caution is warranted when using these ratings as summary measures. (aut. ref. ...|$|E

Aims: This study aims to evaluate anxiety, depression and suicidal intent in undergraduate dental students {{and to find out}} the various areas of stress. Materials and Methods: A cross-sectional study was conducted using a semi-structured questionnaire (to assess academic and nonacademic areas of stress) and three scales-Hamilton scale for anxiety (HAM-A); Hamilton depression rating scale (HDRS) and Beck′s Suicide Intent Scale (BSI). Descriptive statistics; Pearson′s Chi-square test; Multiple ANOVA; Kruskal-Wallis test and Mann-Whitney test were used to analyze the data at the significant level of P ≤ 0. 05. Results: In a total of 258 dental undergraduate students, academic areas of stress that were found to be statistically significant were long teaching hours (P = 0. 002); high workload (P ≤ 0. 001); <b>frequency</b> <b>of</b> <b>tests</b> (P ≤ 0. 001) and competition/fear of failure (P = 0. 009). Lack of interest in the profession was a statistically significant nonacademic area for stress (P ≤ 0. 001).

Because of differences in the delivery of health care, this trend in use of colonoscopy in fee-for-service settings might not be paralleled in the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA). Methods National inpatient and outpatient VA databases were searched for codes indicative of colonoscopy, flexible sigmoidoscopy, fecal occult blood testing, and double-contrast barium enema during fiscal years 1998 to 2003 among VA users aged 49 to 75 years. Results The <b>frequency</b> <b>of</b> <b>tests</b> for CRC screening increased from 432 778 in 1998 to 1 179 764 in 2003. Of those who were screened, only the proportion of subjects screened with fecal occult blood testing increased from 81. 7 % to 90. 4 %, while screening colonoscopy declined from 5. 7 % to 4. 7 %; flexible sigmoidoscopy declined from 8. 3 % to 3. 6 %; and double-contrast barium enema declined from 4. 1 % to 1. 3 %. The total use of screening colonoscopy procedures increased from 24 955 in 1998 to 55 199 in 2003, but the proportion of colonoscopy procedures performed for CRC screening purposes increased only slightly from 34. 3 % to 38. 4 %. In regression models adjusting for age, race, and sex, there was no consistent secular trend in the likelihood of undergoing screening colonoscopy for patients cared for in the VA health care system. Conclusions Colorectal cancer screening has dramatically increased in the VA, but unlike in other practice settings, fecal occult blood testing is the dominant mode of screening.

40|$|Abstract BACKGROUND: This {{retrospective}} study aimed {{to determine how}} often a perimetric examination should be carried out {{in order to identify}} visual field (VF) changes in patients with relatively early manifestation glaucoma. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Patients included had a relatively recent manifestation of primary open-angle glaucoma. Patients with a minimum follow-up of 5 years and a minimum of seven VF tests were included. Statistical analysis was performed to verify the trend of variations in mean defect (MD) over time (PeriData). The results were subjected to a t-test for a comparative analysis of progression of VF changes over time. The annual rate of progression provided by PeriData considering all the VFs analyzed was compared with that obtained on half of the VF examinations during the same follow-up period. An analysis of the MD trend over time was also carried out in relationship to the number of VF tests done and by dividing the sample into a high-frequency group (more than eight VFs) and a low-frequency group (fewer than eight VFs) in the follow-up period. RESULTS: A total of 96 eyes of 96 patients were included, and overall 846 VFs were examined. The paired t-test performed comparing the MD index of all the VFs against half of them did not show statistical significance (P= 0. 537). The high-frequency group comprised 39 eyes (average VF 11. 05 ± 1. 91, average time interval 0. 76 years) while the low-frequency group comprised 57 eyes (average VF 6. 95 ± 0. 6, average time interval 1. 21 years). The analysis of the MD trend in the high-frequency patients showed significance (P= 0. 017); the low-frequency group did not show statistical significance (P= 0. 08). CONCLUSION: The number of VFs in a determined time interval was not significant. However, a greater <b>frequency</b> <b>of</b> <b>tests</b> provides a predictive evaluation of the rate of progression of early manifestation open-angle glaucoma...|$|E
40|$|Introduction: Disease {{management}} programs often strive to enhance patient outcomes through {{improvements in the}} process of care. The {{purpose of this study was}} to determine the relationship of diabetes care process measures with self-rated health and patient satisfaction among managed care patients with diabetes mellitus, while controlling for the influence of demographics, co-morbidities and severity of illness. Study design and methods: This study was an integrated analysis of cross-sectional survey and retrospective claims data. The sample included 300 adult patients with diabetes mellitus enrolled in an Independent Practice Association-model health maintenance organization. Analyses consisted of two multiple regression models with self-rated health (100 -point scale, higher score = better health) and patient satisfaction (9 -point scale, higher score = greater satisfaction) being the dependent variables, respectively. Predictor variables in both models included: demographics (age, gender, education, income), severity of illness (insulin use, duration of diabetes mellitus), number of co-morbidities, receipt of foot and eye exams, diabetes mellitus education, lipid tests, microalbumin tests, frequency of self-monitoring of blood glucose and the <b>frequency</b> <b>of</b> <b>tests</b> for glycosylated hemoglobin (HbA 1 c) and blood glucose. Results: Mean (SD) for self-rated health and patient satisfaction scores were 49. 8 (25. 0) and 7. 8 (1. 8), respectively. The squared multiple regression coefficients (R 2) for model 1 (self-rated health) and model 2 (patient satisfaction) were 0. 20 and 0. 10, respectively. Significant predictors of self-rated health included co-morbidities (standardized regression coefficient [beta] = - 0. 12), income (beta = 0. 27), and HbA 1 c tests (beta = 0. 19). Significant predictors of patient satisfaction included co-morbidities (beta = - 0. 16), foot exams (beta = 0. 16), and diabetes mellitus education (beta = 0. 16). Conclusion: When controlling for demographics, co-morbidities and severity of illness, those patients who received more frequent HbA 1 c monitoring reported better health, and patients who received foot exams and diabetes education were more satisfied with the care they received for diabetes mellitus. Thus, disease management initiatives that optimize the education and monitoring of patients with diabetes mellitus are likely to produce better patient-reported outcomes.

Materials and methods: Patients included had a relatively recent manifestation of primary open-angle glaucoma. Patients with a minimum follow-up of 5 years and a minimum of seven VF tests were included. Statistical analysis was performed to verify the trend of variations in mean defect (MD) over time (PeriData). The results were subjected to a t-test for a comparative analysis of progression of VF changes over time. The annual rate of progression provided by PeriData considering all the VFs analyzed was compared with that obtained on half of the VF examinations during the same follow-up period. An analysis of the MD trend over time was also carried out in relationship to the number of VF tests done and by dividing the sample into a high-frequency group (more than eight VFs) and a low-frequency group (fewer than eight VFs) in the follow-up period. Results: A total of 96 eyes of 96 patients were included, and overall 846 VFs were examined. The paired t-test performed comparing the MD index of all the VFs against half of them did not show statistical significance (P= 0. 537). The high-frequency group comprised 39 eyes (average VF 11. 05 ± 1. 91, average time interval 0. 76 years) while the low-frequency group comprised 57 eyes (average VF 6. 95 ± 0. 6, average time interval 1. 21 years). The analysis of the MD trend in the high-frequency patients showed significance (P= 0. 017); the low-frequency group did not show statistical significance (P= 0. 08). Conclusion: The number of VFs in a determined time interval was not significant. However, a greater <b>frequency</b> <b>of</b> <b>tests</b> provides a predictive evaluation of the rate of progression of early manifestation open-angle glaucoma.  Keywords: open-angle glaucoma, visual field, progression, ocular hypertensio...|$|E
40|$|Over {{the past}} twenty years, there has been {{significant}} research conducted on the effects <b>of</b> large-scale standardized <b>tests</b> on academic achievement. Policy makers {{around the world have}} developed policies and allocated substantial sums of money in order to increase the <b>frequency</b> <b>of</b> large-scale standardized <b>tests,</b> although existing research offers inconclusive findings as to whether the use <b>of</b> large-scale standardized <b>tests</b> leads to higher achievement. This study was intended to empirically examine the use <b>of</b> standardized <b>testing</b> and its relationship with student achievement. The study focused on two questions: first, why do some nations require their students to take large-scale standardized tests more frequently than others? And second, is there a correlation between the <b>frequency</b> <b>of</b> large-scale standardized <b>tests</b> <b>frequency</b> and academic achievement? This study examined data from the 2003 and 2009 administrations of the Program for International Student Assessment (PISA) in order to address these questions. Results from this study indicated the <b>frequency</b> <b>of</b> large-scale standardized <b>tests</b> is most likely to be associated with testing consequence or stake (e. g., data are made public, etc.). Additionally, results suggest that the <b>frequency</b> <b>of</b> large-scale standardized <b>tests</b> is not significantly related to academic achievement...|$|R
40|$|The {{number and}} volume {{of meat and}} poultry recalls has {{increased}} substantially in recent years. This is likely due to regulatory emphasis on foodborne illness resulting in an increased <b>frequency</b> <b>of</b> <b>testing</b> for pathogens. We use an equilibrium-displacement model {{to examine the effects}} of recall costs on the beef, pork, and poultry industries. Results suggest that higher recall costs may have actually increased producer surplus to the broiler industry because of consumer substitution among products and that most losses resulting from recalls are accruing to the beef and pork industries.
