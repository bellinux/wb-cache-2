40|$|Programmed {{cell death}} (apoptosis) is the {{physiological}} process {{responsible for the}} demise of superfluous, aged, damaged, mutated, and ectopic cells. Its normal function is essential both for embryonic development and for maintenance of adult tissue homeostasis. Deficient apoptosis participates in cancerogenesis, whereas excessive apoptosis leads to unwarranted cell loss accounting for disparate diseases including neurodegeneration and AIDS. One critical {{step in the process}} of apoptosis consists in the permeabilization of mitochondrial membranes, leading to the release of proteins which normally are secluded behind the outer mitochondrial membrane[1]. For example, cytochrome c, which is normally confined to the mitochondrial intermembrane space, is liberated from mitochondria and interacts with a cytosolic protein, Apaf- 1, causing its oligomerization and constitution of the so-called apoptosome, a protein complex which activates a specific class of cysteine proteases, the caspases[2].

Accordingly, a disruption of the mitochondrial membrane barrier function with release of cytochrome into the cytosol {{has been shown to}} precede caspase activation {{in a number of different}} models of apoptosis. Here, we addressed the question of whether caspases themselves can affect mitochondrial membrane function. Recombinant caspases were added to purified mitochondria and were found to affect the permeability of both mitochondrial membranes. Thus, caspases cause a dissipation of the mitochondrial inner transmembrane potential. In addition, caspases cause <b>intermembrane</b> <b>proteins</b> including cytochrome c and AIF (apoptosis-inducing factor) to be released through the outer mitochondrial membrane. These observations suggest that caspases and mitochondria can engage in a circular self-amplification loop. An increase in mitochondrial membrane permeability would cause the release of caspase activators, and caspases, once activated, would in turn increase the mitochondrial membrane permeability. Such a self-amplifying system could accelerate the apoptotic process and/or coordinate the apoptotic response between different mitochondria within the same cell...|$|R

40|$|Since its {{discovery}} {{nearly a}} decade ago, apoptosis-inducing factor (AIF) has had any-thing but a staid and uneventful existence. AIF was originally described as a mito-chondrial <b>intermembrane</b> <b>protein</b> that, after apoptosis induction, can translocate to the nucleus and trigger chromatin condensation and DNA fragmentation. Over the years, an AIF-mediated caspase-independent cell death pathway has been defined. Rather than functioning as a general component of the cell death machinery, AIF is required for specific cell death pathways, including lethal responses to excitotoxins such as N-methyl-D-aspartate and glutamate, the DNA-alkylating agent N-methyl-N’-nitro-N-nitroso-guanidine, hypoxia–ischemia, or growth factor deprivation. Also, important roles of AIF in mitochondrial metabolism and redox control, and more recently in obesity and diabetes, have been discovered. Much of our knowledge has come from studies of AIF orthologs in model organisms, Saccharomyces cerevisiae, Caenorhabditis elegans,Drosophilamelanogaster, andmice, which have also highlighted the importance of AIF in animal physiology and human pathology.

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of the present study}} was to validate the presence and explore the characteristics of mitochondrial permeability transition (mPT) in isolated mitochondria from human heart tissue in order to investigate if previous findings in animal models of cardiac disorders are translatable to human disease. Mitochondria were rapidly isolated from fresh atrial tissue samples obtained from 14 patients undergoing Maze surgery due to atrial fibrillation. Human heart mitochondria exhibited typical mPT characteristics upon calcium overload such as swelling, evaluated by changes in light scattering, inhibition of respiration and loss of respiratory coupling. Swelling was a morphologically reversible event following transient calcium challenge. Calcium retention capacity (CRC), a quantitative measure of mPT sensitivity assayed by following extramitochondrial [Ca 2 +] and changes in respiration during a continuous calcium infusion, was significantly increased by cyclophilin D (CypD) inhibitors. The thiol-reactive oxidant phenylarsine oxide sensitized mitochondria to calcium-induced mPT. Release of the pro-apoptotic <b>intermembrane</b> <b>protein</b> cytochrome c was increased after, but not before, calcium discharge and respiratory inhibition in the CRC assay. From the present study, we conclude that adult viable heart mitochondria have a CypD- and oxidant-regulated mPT.

This release was not accompanied by release of adenylate kinase (AK), another <b>intermembrane</b> <b>protein,</b> and was not inhibited by Mg(2 +), dATP, inhibitors of the permeability transition or ligands of the peripheral benzodiazepine receptor. However, release was greatly reduced {{by the presence of}} 5 % (w/v) dextran (40 kDa), which caused a decrease in the light scattering (A(520)) of mitochondrial suspensions. Dextran also inhibited both mitochondrial oxidation of exogenous ferrocytochrome c in the presence of rotenone and antimycin, and respiratory-chain-driven reduction of exogenous ferricytochrome c. Hypo-osmotic medium or digitonin treatment of mitochondria caused a large additional release of both cytochrome c and AK that was not blocked by dextran. Polyaspartate, which stabilizes the low conductance state of the voltage-dependent anion channel (VDAC), increased cytochrome c release. VDAC and BAX are both found at the contact sites between the inner and outer membranes and dextran is known to stabilize these contact sites in isolated mitochondria. Thus our data suggest that regulation of a specific permeability pathway for cytochrome c may be mediated by changes in protein-protein interactions within contact sites. The adenine nucleotide translocase is known to bind to VDAC and thus provides an additional link between the specific cytochrome c release pathway and the permeability transitio...|$|E

The purpose of this study was to investigate the impact of CHCHD 4 haploinsufficiency on mitochondrial function and brain injury after cerebral hypoxia-ischemia (HI) in neonatal mice. CHCHD 4 +/− and wild-type littermate mouse pups were subjected to unilateral cerebral HI on postnatal day 9. CHCHD 4 haploinsufficiency reduced insult-related AIF and superoxide dismutase 2 release from the mitochondria and reduced neuronal cell death. The total brain injury volume was reduced by 21. 5 % at 3 days and by 31. 3 % at 4 weeks after HI in CHCHD 4 +/− mice. However, CHCHD 4 haploinsufficiency had no influence on mitochondrial biogenesis, fusion, or fission; neural stem cell proliferation; or neural progenitor cell differentiation. There were no significant changes in the expression or distribution of p 53 protein or p 53 pathway-related genes under physiological conditions or after HI.

Identification of the mechanisms involved in these lipid transport reactions has lagged significantly behind that for <b>intermembrane</b> <b>protein</b> traffic until recently. Application of methods that include fluorescently labeled and spin-labeled lipid analogs, new cellular fractionation techniques, topographically specific chemical modification techniques, the identification of organelle-specific metabolism, permeabilized cell methodology, and yeast molecular genetics has contributed to revealing a diverse biochemical array of transport processes for lipids. Compelling evidence now exists for ATP-dependent, ATP-independent, vesicle-dependent, and vesicle-independent transport processes that are lipid and membrane specific. ATP-dependent transport processes include the transbilayer movement of phosphatidylserine and phosphatidylethanolamine at the plasma membrane and the {{transport of}} phosphatidylserine from its site of synthesis to the mitochondria. ATP-independent processes include the transbilayer movement of virtually all lipids at the endoplasmic reticulum, the movement of phosphatidylserine between {{the inner and outer}} mitochondrial membranes, and the transfer of nascent phosphatidylcholine and phosphatidylethanolamine to the plasma membrane. The ATP-independent movement of lipids between organelles is believed to be due to the action of lipid transfer proteins, but this still remains to be proved. Vesicle-based transport mechanisms (which are also inherently ATP dependent) include the transport of nascent cholesterol, sphingomyelin, and glycosphingolipids from the Golgi apparatus to the plasma membrane and the recycling of sphingolipids and selected pools of phosphatidylcholine from the plasma membrane to the cell interior. The vesicles involved in cholesterol transport to the plasma membrane are different from those involved in bulk protein transport to the cell surface. The vesicles involved in recycling sphingomyelin to and from the cell surface are different from those involved in the assembly of newly synthesized sphingolipids into the plasma membrane.

40|$|The goal of my {{research}} is to understand the molecular mechanism by which hormones control seed germination and response to abiotic stresses, {{in order to reduce}} yield loss in rice via the development of biotech applications. Abscisic acid (ABA) inhibits, while gibberellins (GA) promote, seed germination. In addition, ABA plays a critical role in stress responses, such as the regulation of seed germination under salt and salinity stresses. Key components in these signaling pathways include receptors, secondary messengers, protein kinases and phosphatases, and transcription factors. My study focused on how WRKY transcription factors modulate ABA and GA signaling, therefore affecting seed germination and responses to abiotic stresses. Chapter 2 begins with the identification of OsWRKY 53 and - 70, close homologs to OsWRKY 24, followed by functional studies of these WRKY proteins in mediating ABA and GA response. The roles of these proteins as transcription factors are indicated by their localization in the nucleus, ability to bind to the W-box in promoters, and the transactivation activity of all three. Transient expression analyses indicated that all three antagonize the GA and ABA signaling pathways in a dosage-dependent manner. When the three transcription factors were paired, they acted additively in the antagonism of both ABA and GA signaling. A combination of all three led to additive antagonism of ABA signaling, but synergistic antagonism of GA signaling. These data suggest that OsWRKY 24, - 53, and - 70 may function in a partially redundant manner to antagonize the ABA and GA signaling pathways. Chapter 3 presents a functional study of OsWRKY 70 in regulating seed germination and response to abiotic stresses. Overexpression lines of OsWRKY 70 were successfully generated using Agrobacterium-mediated rice transformation. Studies of the knockout mutant and overexpression lines demonstrated that OsWRKY 70 negatively regulates seed germination when nutrients are insufficient. In addition, mutation of OsWRKY 70 in rice increased drought and salinity tolerance, which further suggests a negative role of OsWRKY 70 in the regulation of abiotic stress responses. Chapter 4 illustrates the interaction between an NHL protein, OsNHL 2, and two WRKY transcription factors, OsWRKY 53 and - 70. As with OsWRKY 53 and - 70, OsNHL 2 also negatively regulates the ABA and GA signaling pathways. Furthermore, paired with each of these WRKY transcription factors, the WRKY and NHL proteins functioned additively to repress the ABA-induced HVA 22 promoter, but antagonistically to repress the GA-induced Amy 32 b promoter. These data suggest a cooperative role between the WRKY transcription factors and OsNHL 2 in the regulation of ABA, but not GA, signaling. My research demonstrates the roles of WRKY transcription factors, in cooperation with an NHL <b>intermembrane</b> <b>protein,</b> in the regulation of seed germination and responses to abiotic stresses. My finding that oswrky 70 mutant has fast and uniform germination and better seedling establishment under abiotic stress will save great effort, time, and expense used in seed priming in the field.

Mitochondrial membrane permeabilization (MMP) is a critical event in cell death, as it regulates the degree of mitochondrial dysfunction {{and the release of}} <b>intermembrane</b> <b>proteins</b> that function in the activation and assembly of caspases. In addition to the crucial role of proapoptotic members of the Bcl- 2 family, the lipid composition of the mitochondrial membranes is increasingly recognized to modulate MMP and hence cell death. The unphysiological accumulation of cholesterol in mitochondrial membranes regulates their physical properties, facilitating or impairing MMP during Bax and death ligand-induced cell death depending on the level of mitochondrial GSH (mGSH), which in turn regulates the oxidation status of cardiolipin. Cholesterol-mediated mGSH depletion stimulates TNF-induced reactive oxygen species and subsequent cardiolipin peroxidation, which destabilizes the lipid bilayer and potentiates Bax-induced membrane permeabilization. These data suggest that the balance of mitochondrial cholesterol to peroxidized cardiolipin regulates mitochondrial membrane properties and permeabilization, emerging as a rheostat in cell death...|$|R
40|$|Apoptosis may {{be viewed}} as a {{triphasic}} process. During the premitochondrial initiation phase, very different pro-apoptotic signal transduction or damage pathways can be activated. These pathways then converge on the mitochondrion, where they cause the permeabilization of the inner and/or outer membranes with consequent release of soluble <b>intermembrane</b> <b>proteins</b> into the cytosol. The process of mitochondrial membrane permeabilization would constitute the decision/effector phase of the apoptotic process. During the post-mitochondrial degradation phase downstream caspases and nucleases are activated and the cell acquires an apoptotic morphology. Recently, a number of different second messengers (calcium, ceramide derivatives, nitric oxide, reactive oxygen species) and pro-apoptotic proteins (Bax, Bak, Bid, and caspases) have been found to directly compromise the barrier function of mitochondrial membranes, when added to isolated mitochondria. The effects of several among these agents are mediated at least in part via the permeability transition pore complex (PTPC), a composite channel in which members of the Bcl- 2 family interact with sessile transmembrane proteins such as the adenine nucleotide translocator.

Chelation of Ca 2 + shortly (within 2 min) after its addition to isolated mitochondria reestablished the mitochondrial transmembrane potential (ΔΨm), prevented induction of large amplitude swelling and release of both cytochrome c and AIF. In contrast, late Ca 2 + chelation (10 min after addition of Ca 2 +) failed to affect these parameters. Cytochrome c appears to be released through a mechanically damaged outer mitochondrial membrane rather than via a specific release mechanism. These findings clarify the mechanisms through which irreversible permeability transition occurs with subsequent large amplitude swelling culminating in the release of <b>intermembrane</b> <b>proteins</b> from mitochondria.

50|$|Cytochrome c {{release is}} {{proposed}} {{to take place}} in one of two ways. Firstly, the permeability transition pore (PTP) when the mitochondria receives a death inducing signal, and releases <b>intermembrane</b> space <b>proteins</b> (12). The PTP is composed of the voltage-dependent anion channel (VDAC), the inner membrane protein adenine nucleotide translocator (AdNT) and the matrix protein cyclophilin D (CyD) (12). This pore causes the mitochondria to swell and the outer mitochondrial membrane to rupture (Diamond & McCabe, 2007). With this change in permeability, proteins such as cytochrome c are released into the cytosol (12). This change likely causes the mitochondrial permeability transition (MPT), where the mitochondrial transmembrane potential collapses, and ATP production ceases (12). The inhibition of this method by the pharmaceutical agent cyclosporine A (CsA), lead to the discovery of the second pathway (13). The second method of cytochrome c release is independent of the PTP and involves only the VDAC. Members of the Bcl-2 family of pro-apoptotic proteins can induce the opening of the VDAC (12). This will cause the same release of <b>intermembrane</b> space <b>proteins,</b> including cytochrome c, and the subsequent MPT to occur (12).|$|R

Despite substantial efforts in the past, the mechanisms of acetaminophen-induced liver cell injury are still incompletely understood.

Bcl- 2 family members Bax and Bid then form pores in the outer mitochondrial membrane and release <b>intermembrane</b> <b>proteins,</b> e. g. apoptosis-inducing factor (AIF) and endonuclease G, which then translocate to the nucleus and initiate chromatin condensation and DNA fragmentation, respectively.

In addition to the diminishing capacity to synthesize ATP, endonuclease G and AIF are further released. Endonuclease G, together with an activated nuclear Ca 2 +,Mg 2 +-dependent endonuclease, cause DNA degradation thereby preventing cell recovery and regeneration. Disruption of the Ca 2 + homeostasis also leads to activation of intracellular proteases, e. g. calpains, which can proteolytically cleave structural proteins.

A specific issue is whether or not a mitochondrial PT is a requisite for the release of apoptogenic proteins, an issue that has generated conflicting results and a major controversy in the literature. A specific, PT-independent release mechanism has been proposed based on the finding that cytochrome c release occurs without measurable decrease of the mitochondrial membrane potential. This point remains very controversial, however. Other groups have indeed reported that cytochrome c release matches membrane depolarization, and that it is mediated by a PT, which has been indicated as the major determinant of AIF release.

V 2 −/− MEFs regain tBID sensitivity after VDAC 2 expression. Furthermore, V 2 −/− MEFs are deficient in mitochondrial BAK despite normal tBID–mitochondrial binding and BAX/BAK expression. tBID sensitivity of BAK−/− MEFs is also reduced, although not {{to the same extent}} as V 2 −/− MEFs, which might result from their strong overexpression of BAX. Indeed, addition of recombinant BAX also sensitized V 2 −/− MEFs to tBID. Thus, VDAC 2 acts as a crucial component in mitochondrial apoptosis by allowing the mitochondrial recruitment of BAK, thereby controlling tBID-induced OMM permeabilization and cell death...|$|R

Here we show that this process is accompanied by caspase activation and signs of mitochondrial membrane permeabilization (MMP), including the release of <b>intermembrane</b> <b>proteins</b> such as cytochrome c (Cyt-c) and apoptosis-inducing factor (AIF) from mitochondria. In Env-induced syncytia, caspase inhibition did not suppress AIF- and Cyt-c translocation, yet it prevented all signs of nuclear apoptosis. Translocation of Bax to mitochondria led to MMP, which was inhibited by microinjected Bcl- 2 protein or bcl- 2 transfection. Bcl- 2 also prevented the subsequent nuclear chromatin condensation and DNA fragmentation. The release of AIF occurred before that of Cyt-c and before caspase activation. Microinjection of AIF into syncytia sufficed to trigger rapid, caspase-independent Cyt-c release. Neutralization of endogenous AIF by injection of an antibody prevented all signs of spontaneous apoptosis occurring in syncytia, including the Cyt-c release and nuclear apoptosis. In contrast, Cyt-c neutralization only prevented nuclear apoptosis, and did not affect AIF release. Our results establish that the following molecular sequence governs apoptosis of Env-induced syncytia: Bax-mediated/Bcl- 2 -inhibited MMP [...] > AIF release [...] > Cyt-c release [...] > caspase activation [...] > nuclear apoptosis.

40|$|Acquired {{resistance}} to drugs commonly used for lymphoma treatment poses a significant barrier to improving lymphoma patient survival. Previous {{work with a}} lymphoma tissue culture model indicates that selection for {{resistance to}} oxidative stress confers resistance to chemotherapy-induced apoptosis. This suggests that adaptation to chronic oxidative stress can contribute to chemoresistance seen in lymphoma patients. Oxidative stress-resistant WEHI 7. 2 cell variants in a lymphoma tissue culture model exhibit a range of apoptosis sensitivities. We exploited this phenotype to test for mitochondrial changes affecting sensitivity to apoptosis in cells made resistant to oxidative stress. We identified impaired release of cytochrome c, and the <b>intermembrane</b> <b>proteins</b> adenylate kinase 2 and Smac/DIABLO, indicating inhibition of the pathway leading to permeabilization of the outer mitochondrial membrane. Blunting of a glucocorticoid-induced signal and intrinsic mitochondrial resistance to cytochrome c release contributed to both points of resistance. The level of Bcl- 2 family members or a difference in Bim induction were not contributing factors. The extent of cardiolipin oxidation following dexamethasone treatment, however, did correlate with apoptosis resistance. The differences found in the variants were all proportionate {{to the degree of}} resistance to glucocorticoid treatment. We conclude that tolerance to oxidative stress leads to mitochondrial changes that confer resistance to apoptosis. ...|$|R
40|$|Bax and Bak {{are known}} to {{play a central role}} in facilitating the release of {{mitochondrial}} <b>intermembrane</b> <b>proteins</b> during apoptosis. The detailed mechanism, however, is still not clear. Using live cell imaging techniques, we showed here that Bax underwent four distinct stages of dynamic redistribution during UV-induced apoptosis. At stage I, Bax was distributed diffusely in the cytosol. About an hour after UV treatment at stage II, Bax started to translocate to mitochondria and distributed uniformly at the mitochondrial outer membrane (MOM). Within a few minutes, at stage III, Bax and Bak began to form small complexes at the MOM. Later, at stage IV, these Bax and Bak complexes expanded to become large clusters. We found that the formation of Bax-Bak small complexes at stage III was responsible for permeabilizing the MOM to release cytochrome c and Smac. Using a FRET technique, we further showed that Bax binds to Bak within the complex formed at the MOM during stage III. Finally, using a quantitative fluorescence measurement, we determined that the Bax-Bak complex was about 0. 25 mu m wide and composed of more than 100 protein molecules. These findings suggest that the Bax-Bak structure responsible for releasing mitochondrial proteins during apoptosis is not channel-like...|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT Ceramides {{are known}} to have a {{regulatory}} function in apoptosis, including the release of cytochrome c and other proapoptotic factors from the mitochondrial intermembrane space. Ceramides can form large, stable channels in the outer mitochondrial membrane, leading to the proposal that ceramide channels are the pathway through which these proteins are released. Here, we report that sphingosine, a product of ceramide hydrolysis by ceramidase, is capable of destabilizing cer-amide channels, leading to their disassembly. Sphingosine is directly responsible for the disassembly of ceramide channels in planar membrane experiments and markedly reduces the ability of ceramide to induce the release of <b>intermembrane</b> space <b>proteins</b> from mitochondria in vitro. Low concentrations of both L and D sphingosine potentiate the release of <b>intermembrane</b> space <b>proteins</b> by long-chain ceramide and channel formation in liposomes. These results provide evidence for a mechanism by which the disassembly of ceramide channels, as initiated by ceramidase, could be accelerated by the direct interaction of the hydrolysis product with the ceramide channels themselves. This mechanism therefore could form a positive feedback loop for rapid shut-down of ceramide channels. However, potentiation of ceramide channel formation is also possible and thus both effects could influence the propensity for mitochondria-mediated apoptosis...|$|R
40|$|In most cell types, a {{key event}} in {{apoptosis}} is {{the release of}} proapoptotic <b>intermembrane</b> space <b>proteins</b> from mitochondria to the cytoplasm. In general, it is the release of these <b>intermembrane</b> space <b>proteins</b> {{that is responsible for}} the activation of caspases and DNases that are responsible for the execution of apoptosis. The mechanism for the increased permeability of the mitochondrial outer membrane during the induction phase of apoptosis is currently unknown and highly debated. This review will focus on one such proposed mechanism, namely, the formation of ceramide channels in the mitochondrial outer membrane. Ceramides are known to play a major regulatory role in apoptosis by inducing the release of proapoptotic proteins from the mitochondria. As mitochondria are known to contain the enzymes responsible for the synthesis and hydrolysis of ceramide, there exists a mechanism for regulating the level of ceramide in mitochondria. In addition, mitochondrial ceramide levels {{have been shown to be}} elevated prior to the induction phase of apoptosis. Ceramide has been shown to form large protein permeable channels in planar phospholipid and mitochondrial outer membranes. Thus, ceramide channels are good candidates for the pathway with which proapoptotic proteins are released from mitochondria during the induction phase of apoptosis...|$|R
