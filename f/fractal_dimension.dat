5|$|Fractals are {{infinitely}} self-similar, iterated mathematical constructs having <b>fractal</b> <b>dimension.</b> Infinite iteration is {{not possible}} in nature so all 'fractal' patterns are only approximate.

25|$|Unlike topological dimensions, the fractal index {{can take}} non-integer values, {{indicating}} that a set fills its space qualitatively and quantitatively differently from how an ordinary geometrical set does.

As tool wear increases, the vibration signals of cutting tool {{become more and more}} irregular in the turning processes. The degree of tool wear can be indirectly monitored according to these changes of vibration signals. In order to quantitatively describe these changes, fractal theory and fuzzy clustering method were introduced into the cutting tool wear monitoring area. Firstly, wavelet de-noising method was used to reduce the noise of original signals, and eliminate the effect of noise on <b>fractal</b> <b>dimensions.</b> Secondly, the <b>fractal</b> <b>dimensions</b> based on <b>fractal</b> theory were got from the de-noised signals, including box dimension, information dimension, and correlation dimension.

The <b>fractal</b> <b>dimension</b> of a curve can be explained intuitively thinking of a fractal line as an object too detailed to be one-dimensional, but too simple to be two-dimensional. Therefore its dimension might best be described not by its usual topological dimension of 1 but by its <b>fractal</b> <b>dimension,</b> which in this case is a number between one and two.|$|E

Pietronero argues that the universe shows a definite fractal aspect over a fairly wide range of scale, with a <b>fractal</b> <b>dimension</b> of about 2. The <b>fractal</b> <b>dimension</b> of a homogeneous 3D object would be 3, and 2 for a homogeneous surface, whilst the <b>fractal</b> <b>dimension</b> for a fractal surface is between 2 and 3.

30|$|The general {{analysis}} and {{comparison between the}} <b>fractal</b> <b>dimensions</b> before and after treatment shows that the tracer has the tendency to spread in higher dimensionality in healthy subjects and also when the treatment is successful. Typical healthy subjects demonstrate <b>fractal</b> <b>dimensions</b> (in physiological distribution of tracer) around 2.7 (see healthy subjects 1 and 2, {{at the end of}} Table  2). Since the tracer is not accumulated by malignant lesions in healthy subjects, it tends to spread almost homogeneously throughout the 3 D extension of the body, or concentrates in the 3 D volume covered by organs in which biochemical activity takes place. In these cases, the spreading is expected to show <b>fractal</b> <b>dimensions</b> almost equal (very close) to 3. The results from the PET/CT images of healthy subjects show smaller <b>fractal</b> <b>dimensions</b> because of the different tracer distribution in the organs, including some organs like the liver and brain that physiologically accumulate FDG.

25|$|This idea {{of being}} {{detailed}} relates to another feature that can be understood without mathematical background: Having a fractional or <b>fractal</b> <b>dimension</b> greater than its topological dimension, for instance, refers to how a fractal scales compared to how geometric shapes are usually perceived. A regular line, for instance, is conventionally understood to be 1-dimensional; if such a curve is divided into pieces each 1/3 {{the length of the}} original, there are always 3 equal pieces. In contrast, consider the Koch snowflake. It is also 1-dimensional for the same reason as the ordinary line, but it has, in addition, a <b>fractal</b> <b>dimension</b> greater than 1 because of how its detail can be measured. The fractal curve divided into parts 1/3 the length of the original line becomes 4 pieces rearranged to repeat the original detail, and this unusual relationship is the basis of its <b>fractal</b> <b>dimension.</b>|$|E

25|$|The {{relationship}} of an increasing <b>fractal</b> <b>dimension</b> with space-filling {{might be taken}} to mean fractal dimensions measure density, {{but that is not}} so; the two are not strictly correlated. Instead, a <b>fractal</b> <b>dimension</b> measures complexity, a concept related to certain key features of fractals: self-similarity and detail or irregularity. These features are evident in the two examples of fractal curves. Both are curves with topological dimension of 1, so one might {{hope to be able to}} measure their length or slope, as with ordinary lines. But we cannot do either of these things, because fractal curves have complexity in the form of self-similarity and detail that ordinary lines lack. The self-similarity lies in the infinite scaling, and the detail in the defining elements of each set. The length between any two points on these curves is undefined because the curves are theoretical constructs that never stop repeating themselves. Every smaller piece is composed of an infinite number of scaled segments that look exactly like the first iteration. These are not rectifiable curves, meaning they cannot be measured by being broken down into many segments approximating their respective lengths. They cannot be characterized by finding their lengths or slopes. However, their fractal dimensions can be determined, which shows that both fill space more than ordinary lines but less than surfaces, and allows them to be compared in this regard.|$|E
