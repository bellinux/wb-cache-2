40|$|Infectious {{livestock}} disease creates externalities for proximate {{animal production}} enterprises. The {{distribution of production}} scale within a region should influence and be influenced by these disease externalities. Taking {{the distribution of the}} unit costs of stocking an animal as primitive, we show that an increase in the variance of these unit costs reduces consumer surplus. The effect on producer surplus, total surplus, and animal concentration across feedlots depends on the demand elasticity. A subsidy to smaller herds can reduce social welfare and immiserize the farm sector by increasing the extent of disease. While Nash behavior involves <b>excessive</b> <b>stocking,</b> disease effects can be such that aggregate output declines relative to first-best. Disease externalities can induce more adoption of a cost-reducing technology by larger herds so that animals become more concentrated across herds. For strategic reasons, excess overall adoption of the innovation may occur. Larger herds {{are also more likely to}} adopt biosecurity innovations, explaining why larger herds may be less diseased in equilibrium. agricultural industrialization, biosecurity, inefficiency, Nash behavior, overinvestment, technology adoption. ...|$|E
40|$|Microbial {{pollution}} of surface waters in agricultural catchments {{can be a}} consequence of poor farm management practices, such as <b>excessive</b> <b>stocking</b> of livestock on vulnerable land or inappropriate handling of manures and slurries. Catchment interventions such as fencing of watercourses, streamside buffer strips and constructed wetlands {{have the potential to}} reduce faecal {{pollution of}} watercourses. However these interventions are expensive and occupy valuable productive land. There is, therefore, a requirement for tools to assist in the spatial targeting of such interventions to areas where they will have the biggest impact on water quality improvements whist occupying the minimal amount of productive land. SCIMAP is a risk-based model that has been developed for this purpose but with a focus on diffuse sediment and nutrient pollution. In this study we investigated the performance of SCIMAP in predicting microbial pollution of watercourses and assessed modelled outputs of E. coli, a common faecal indicator organism (FIO), against observed water quality information. SCIMAP was applied to two river catchments in the UK. SCIMAP uses land cover risk weightings, which are routed through the landscape based on hydrological connectivity to generate catchment scale maps of relative in-stream pollution risk. Assessment of the model's performance and derivation of optimum land cover risk weightings was achieved using a Monte-Carlo sampling approach. Performance of the SCIMAP framework for informing on FIO risk was variable with better performance in the Yealm catchment (r s =  0. 88; p    0. 05). Across both catchments much uncertainty was associated with the application of optimum risk weightings attributed to different land use classes. Overall, SCIMAP showed potential as a useful tool in the spatial targeting of FIO diffuse pollution management strategies; however, improvements are required to transition the existing SCIMAP framework to a robust FIO risk-mapping tool...|$|E

40|$|Spanish rangelands occupy {{more than}} 90, 000 km 2 of land grazed by {{millions}} of domestic and wild animals. Organic matter content of soil is an essential component for fertility and productivity in both, natural and human-induced ecosystems. Despite its importance to soil quality, soil organic carbon has been little studied in these rangelands. The main goal {{of this study is}} to assess the amounts and characteristics of soil organic matter in grazed open woodlands of SW Iberia as influenced by vegetation cover and land management. Soil properties were analysed from 22 environmental units selected from 10 farms distributed throughout the region of Extremadura being representative of different rangeland types: dehesas (wooded rangelands), scrublands of Retama sphaerocarpa and treeless grasslands. Some of the soil samples were used for a chemical fractioning of soil carbon. Farmer interviews were conducted in order to quantify livestock densities and stocking rates and to assess land management. Results showed that soils are generally shallow, acidic, with low soil organic carbon contents and poor in nutrients. Areas with higher soil carbon stocks corresponded to units encroached by Retama sphaerocarpa shrubs and dehesas with 49. 2 T·;ha - 1 and 46. 0 T·ha - 1, respectively, particularly those developed on schist. Soil organic carbon concentrated mainly in the top 5 cm soil layer, displaying large variability (mean: 2. 30 %). SOC was relatively high beneath the tree canopy (mean: 3. 35 %) and less concentrated and reduced in variability with depth. Regardless of the variation of total amount of carbon among cover types, the proportion of each carbon fraction from the total carbon was kept relatively constant whatever the cover type. A multivariate analysis performed and other results suggest that land mismanagement and <b>excessive</b> <b>stocking</b> rates could be related with the appearance of bare soil areas, therefore negatively affecting soil organic matter by removing the sensitive topsoil materials through water erosion. © 2013 Elsevier B.

40|$|Manufacturers' returns {{policies}} {{are a common}} feature {{in the distribution of}} many products. The obvious rationale for returns policies is insurance. Practitioners, not surprisingly, have a different perspective and view returns as a cost of doing business. In this paper, we study the strategic effect of returns policies on retail competition and highlight its profitability implications for a manufacturer. The setting for our research is the distribution of products with uncertain demand, limited shelf lives, and retail competition. Our objective is to provide a better understanding of when manufacturers should adopt returns policies. The insights are obtained with a model based on the economics of strategy and decision making under uncertainty. We show that when retailing is competitive and there is no uncertainty in demand, a returns policy subtly induces retailers to compete more intensely. The provision of a returns policy reduces retail prices without affecting wholesale prices, thereby reducing retailer margins and improving manufacturer profitability. The intuition is that with a returns policy, Cournot-like levels of retail stocks cannot be sustained. Each retailer will order stocks so that it will not be constrained by stocks, and so, intensifying retail competition. When, however, demand is uncertain and there is a single retailer, a returns policy encourages the retailer to over-stock, and so decreases (upstream) manufacturer profits. While the provision of a returns policy leads to lower retail margins, the optimality of returns policy depends on the overall uncertainty and marginal cost. A returns policy reduces the dispersion in retail prices between the high and low states of demand and the range of retail prices in the returns case is contained within the range of retail prices for the no-returns case. In the general setting, when there are competing retailers and demand is uncertain, there is a trade-off for the manufacturer between the benefits (more intense retail competition) and the costs (<b>excessive</b> <b>stocking)</b> of a returns policy. We find that a manufacturer should accept returns when the marginal production cost is sufficiently low and demand uncertainty is not too great. To validate the results of our theory, we conduct an empirical test with data from a major U. S. retailer. The tests confirm our prediction that a returns policy intensifies retail competition and reduces retailer margins. Our theory and empirical test should interest practitioners and researchers in distribution, especially those concerned with managing retail competition. returns policies, retail competition, pricing, perishables, demand uncertainty...|$|E

We {{determine}} {{and analyze}} the trading strategy that would allow an investor {{to take advantage of}} the <b>excessive</b> <b>stock</b> price volatility that has been documented in the empirical literature on asset pricing.

We analyze the trading strategy of the rational investors who are not overconfident about the signal. While rational risk-arbitrageurs benefit from trading on their belief that the market is being foolish, when doing so they must hedge future fluctuations in the market’s foolishness. We find that fixed-income instruments can be used for the purpose of hedging. Thus, our analysis illustrates that risk arbitrage cannot be based on just a current price divergence; it must include also a protection against trading risk.

Alternative monetary policies can be used to eliminate the inefficiencies of the post-accession adjustment, but some bring real costs in terms of lower growth and unemployment.

30|$|A {{growing body}} of {{research}} has established firm-specific return variation as an effective measure of firm private information impounded into stock price. French and Roll (1986) and Roll (1988) show that neither market returns nor public news explain stock return variation, suggesting that firm-specific return variation captures the impounding of private information into stock price. An influential study by Morck et al. (2000) finds that stock returns are less synchronous in developed markets with relatively strong property rights protection (and thus fewer impediments to informed trading) than in emerging markets with relatively poor protection, supporting the notion that firm-specific return variation is associated with the intensity of information-based trading. Empirical studies have largely supported their conclusions (Brockman and Yan, 2009; Durnev et al., 2003; Gul et al., 2009; Hutton et al., 2009; Kim and Shi, 2012). Piotroski and Roulstone (2004) show that insider trading reduces stock return synchronicity.

The scope of the standard extends beyond payments to employees, but {{for the purpose of}} this study, the focus is only on 'employee stock options'. IIFRS 2 requires a fair value of stock options records calculated on grant date, and recognized as compensation expenses over vesting periods. Prior to the introduction of IIFRS 2, stock options were not recognized and were only disclosed in the notes to the accounts. In Malaysia, the standard is mandatory for all companies listed on or after January 1, 2006. This study assumes the requirement existed in 2003. This study examines the impact of stock options expenses from 2003 to 2005, on the top 100 Malaysian companies. The three year observations show at least 24 % of the sample exceeds the 5 % materiality threshold on diluted EPS. The sectors that are impacted the most are the Trade/Service and Finance sectors. From the multiple-regression test, this study finds that fair value of stock options have a negative relationship with dividend yields (input of the Black-Scholes Merton (BSM) Model).

40|$|Because of the {{transformation}} from a seller's to a buyer's market and the increasing globalization of markets, companies now must compete internationally for potential customers and orders. At the same time, markets are characterized by constantly changing customer needs. Companies that {{want to continue to}} operate successfully in such a turbulent environment must differentiate themselves by having extremely flexible production systems. The high costs of the production resources employed require a high level of capacity utilization, so that the company's production will be profitable even with dynamic utilization rates and changing product lines. Within this context, effective peripheral systems, such as the operating resources system, take on added importance, in order to guarantee a high availability of jobs.
