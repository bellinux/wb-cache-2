5|$|In writing these {{desultory}} letters, I found I {{could not}} avoid being continually {{the first person}} – 'the little hero of each tale.' I tried to correct this fault, if it be one, for they were designed for publication; but in proportion as I arranged my thoughts, my letter, I found, became stiff and affected: I, therefore, determined to let my remarks and reflections flow unrestrained, as I perceived that I could not give a just description of what I saw, but by relating the effect different objects had produced on my mind and feelings, whilst the <b>impression</b> <b>was</b> still fresh.|$|E
5|$|Moonraker was {{published}} in the UK by Jonathan Cape in hardback format on 5 April 1955 with a cover designed by Kenneth Lewis, following Fleming's suggestions of using a stylised flame motif; the first <b>impression</b> <b>was</b> of 9,900 copies. The US publication was by Macmillan on 20 September that year. In October 1956 Pan Books published a paperback version of the novel in the UK, which sold 43,000 copies {{before the end of the}} year. In December that year the US paperback {{was published}} under the title Too Hot to Handle by Permabooks. This edition was rewritten to Americanise the British idioms used, and Fleming provided a number of explanatory footnotes such as the value of English currency against the dollar. Since its initial publication the book has been issued in numerous hardback and paperback editions, translated into several languages and has never been out of print.|$|E
5|$|Tuđman's initial stance {{was based}} on his belief that Croatia could not win a war against the JNA. The ZNG was {{therefore}} limited to conducting defensive operations, even though {{the actions of the}} JNA appeared to be coordinated with Croatian Serb forces. This <b>impression</b> <b>was</b> reinforced by buffer zones established by the JNA after fighting between Croatian Serb militia and the ZNG. The JNA often intervened after the ZNG had lost territory, leaving the Croatian Serbs in control of areas they had captured before the JNA stepped in. The JNA provided some weapons to the Croatian Serbs, although most of their weaponry was sourced from Serbia's TO and the Serbian Ministry of Internal Affairs.|$|E

5|$|The Croatian {{view of the}} JNA role in the Serb revolt {{gradually}} evolved between January and September 1991. The initial plan of Croatian President Franjo Tuđman was to win {{support for}} Croatia from the European Community (EC) and the United States, and he dismissed advice to seize JNA barracks and storage facilities in the country. Tuđman's stance was motivated by his belief that Croatia could not win a war against the JNA.

This <b>impression</b> <b>was</b> reinforced by buffer zones the JNA established after armed conflicts between the Croatian Serb militia and the ZNGthe JNA intervened after the ZNG lost ground, leaving the Croatian Serbs in control of the territory. Furthermore, the JNA provided some weapons to the Croatian Serbs, although the bulk of the weaponry was provided from Serbia's TO and Ministry of Internal Affairs stocks. After the start of the JNA intervention in Slovenia in late June, conscripts began deserting from the JNA and very few were drafted to replace them, except in Serbia.|$|E
5|$|The {{introduction}} of the euro has led to extensive discussion about its possible effect on inflation. In the short term, there was a widespread impression in the population of the eurozone that the {{introduction of}} the euro had led to an increase in prices, but this <b>impression</b> <b>was</b> not confirmed by general indices of inflation and other studies. A study of this paradox found that this was due to an asymmetric effect of the {{introduction of the}} euro on prices: while it had no effect on most goods, it had an effect on cheap goods which have seen their price round up after the {{introduction of the euro}}. The study found that consumers based their beliefs on inflation of those cheap goods which are frequently purchased. It has also been suggested that the jump in small prices may be because prior to the introduction, retailers made fewer upward adjustments and waited for the introduction of the euro to do so.|$|E

25|$|Completed a {{day ahead}} of {{schedule}} and under budget, The Stranger was the only film made by Welles {{to have been a}} bona fide box office success upon its release. Its cost was $1.034 million; 15 months after its release it had grossed $3.216 million. Within weeks of the completion of the film, International Pictures backed out of its promised four-picture deal with Welles. No reason was given, but the <b>impression</b> <b>was</b> left that The Stranger would not make money.|$|E
25|$|If {{one were}} to print {{only two or three}} copies, this method would be neither simple nor easy. But for {{printing}} hundreds or thousands of copies, it was marvelously quick. As a rule he kept two forms going. While the <b>impression</b> <b>was</b> being made from the one form, the type was being put in place on the other. When the printing of the one form was finished, the other was then ready. In this way the two forms alternated and the printing was done with great rapidity.|$|E
2500|$|The {{process of}} {{fabricating}} a denture usually {{begins with an}} initial dental impression of the maxillary and mandibular ridges. Standard <b>impression</b> materials <b>are</b> used during the process. The initial <b>impression</b> <b>is</b> {{used to create a}} simple stone model that represents the maxillary and mandibular arches of the patient's mouth. This is not a detailed impression at this stage. Once the initial <b>impression</b> <b>is</b> taken, the stone model is used to create a 'Custom <b>Impression</b> Tray' which <b>is</b> used to take a second and much more detailed and accurate impression of the patient's maxillary and mandibular ridges. Polyvinylsiloxane <b>impression</b> material <b>is</b> one of several very accurate impression materials used when the final <b>impression</b> <b>is</b> taken of the maxillary and mandibular ridges. [...] A wax rim is fabricated to assist the dentist or denturist in establishing the vertical dimension of occlusion. [...] After this, a bite registration is created to marry the position of one arch to the other.|$|R

No manus <b>impressions</b> <b>were</b> recognized. The average length of the pes <b>impressions</b> <b>is</b> 47.1  cm, and the average (length/width)-ratio is 1.4. The pes <b>impressions</b> <b>are</b> oval and the metatarso−phalangeal region is smoothly curved. All tracks are poorly preserved without clear digit impression. The average pes pace angulation is 124 °, which is relatively high for sauropods. Trackway XQ-S 2 only preserves an incomplete single step and is morphologically similar to XQ-S 1.|$|R
50|$|An artist's {{impression}} or artist's {{interpretation is}} {{the representation of}} an object or a scene created by an artist, when no other accurate representation is available. It could be an image, a sound, a video or a model. Artist's <b>impressions</b> <b>are</b> often created to represent concepts and objects that cannot {{be seen by the}} naked eye; that are very big, very small, in the past, in the future, fictional, or otherwise abstract in other ways. For example, in architecture, artists' <b>impressions</b> <b>are</b> used to showcase the design of planned buildings and associated landscape. Artists' <b>impressions</b> <b>are</b> particularly prominent in space art.|$|R
25|$|The general <b>impression</b> <b>was</b> that, {{as much as}} {{the senate}} was packed with men devoted to the royal couple and the {{government}} obtained a large majority at the general elections, King Alexander would not hesitate any longer to proclaim Queen Draga's brother as the heir presumptive to the throne. In spite of this, it had been agreed with the Serbian Government that Prince Mirko of Montenegro, who was married to Natalija Konstantinovic, the granddaughter of Princess Anka Obrenović, an aunt of King Milan, would be proclaimed heir-presumptive in the event that the marriage of King Alexander and Queen Draga was childless.|$|E
25|$|His first <b>impression</b> <b>was</b> {{that it was}} {{the remains}} of an animal, very mutilated, and in an {{advanced}} state of decomposition. The carcass was very pale pink, almost white, in colour, with a silver reflection in the sunlight. It was composed of a rubbery substance of a very hard consistency, such that it could only be cut with great difficulty. The part of the carcass that was visible measured 18 feet (approx. 6 meters) in length and 7 feet (approx. 2½ meters) in width. Webb estimated its weight at nearly 5 tons, if not more. He believed it was the remains of a giant octopus, as it appeared to have the stumps of four arms, with another arm buried nearby.|$|E
25|$|There {{was further}} {{controversy}} in July 2007 when Fincham {{was accused of}} misleading BBC One viewers. The incident involved a clip from forthcoming documentary A Year with the Queen which was shown to journalists during a press conference. It apparently showed the Queen storming out of a session with American photographer Annie Leibovitz over a disagreement about what she should wear, but the BBC subsequently admitted that the scenes used in the trailer had been edited out of their correct order, meaning that a false <b>impression</b> <b>was</b> given. Fincham admitted the error, but rejected calls that he should resign from his position as a result. His future was deemed uncertain following critical comments from Sir Michael Lyons, Chairman of the BBC Trust and he resigned on 5 October 2007.|$|E

25|$|From {{analysing}} {{the data}} collected in 1938-39, Bruce-Milford concluded that there were still unanswered questions. As {{a result of his}} interest in excavating previously unexplored areas of the Sutton Hoo site, a second archaeological investigation was organised. In 1965, a British Museum team began work, continuing until 1971. The ship <b>impression</b> <b>was</b> re-exposed and found to have suffered some damage, not having been back-filled after excavation in 1939. Nevertheless, it remained sufficiently intact for a plaster cast to be taken and a fiberglass shape produced. The decision was then made to destroy the impression in order to excavate underneath. The mound was later restored to its pre-1939 appearance. The team also determined the limits of Mound 5 and investigated evidence of prehistoric activity on the original land-surface. They scientifically analysed and reconstructed some of the finds.|$|E
25|$|The next Friday, 23 August, {{thousands}} of Arab villagers streamed into Jerusalem {{from the surrounding}} countryside to pray on the Temple Mount, many armed with sticks and knives. Harry Luke requested reinforcements from Amman. Towards 09:30 Jewish storekeepers began closing shop and at 11:00, 20–30 gunshots were heard on the Temple Mount, apparently to work up the crowd. Luke telephoned the Mufti to come and calm a mob that had gathered under his window near the Damascus Gate, but the commissioner's <b>impression</b> <b>was</b> that the religious leader's presence was having the opposite effect. By midday friction had spread to the Jewish neighborhood of Mea She'arim where two or three Arabs were killed. The American consulate documented the event in detail, reported that the killings had taken place between 12:00 and 12:30. The Shaw report described the excited Arab crowds {{and that it was}} clear beyond all doubt that at 12:50 large sections of these crowds were bent on mischief if not on murder. At 13:15, the Arabs began a massacre of the Jews.|$|E
25|$|Nottinghamshire, captained for {{the first}} time by William Sime, drew half of their matches and only the top three had less defeats. They lost Bill Voce early in the season to {{retirement}} and this placed a heavy burden on the remaining pace bowlers Arthur Jepson and Harold Butler. They did well, both taking over 100 wickets and Butler being picked for England, but they lacked support. The only other bowler to make any kind of <b>impression</b> <b>was</b> slow left armer Harry Winrow who took 56 championship wickets. Winrow was one of five batsmen to score 1,000 runs. The best of these by a distance was England's Joe Hardstaff junior who had an outstanding season, scoring 2,396 with seven centuries. Walter Keeton, Reg Simpson and Tom Reddick all topped 1,000 runs while Charles Harris was approaching the landmark when his season was ended early by illness. Wicketkeeper Eric Meads claimed 52 victims in championship matches. Cambridge University captain Guy Willatt batted well when available and young Peter Harvey, leg break and googly bowler, looked a good prospect, but Freddie Stocks did not fulfil the promise he showed in 1946. Nottinghamshire made exclusive use of their headquarters at Trent Bridge in Nottingham for their thirteen home matches.|$|E
