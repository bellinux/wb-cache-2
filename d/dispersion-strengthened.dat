40|$|Abstract. To {{improve the}} {{performance}} of NM 400, V, Ti and Ce were added in NM 400. The effect of alloy on grain size, precipitation, hardness and toughness was studied. The result shows that V and Ti can improve the performance by grain refiner and <b>dispersion-strengthening.</b> By further adding Ce, the size of grain and precipitations of V and Ti is significantly reduced, the solid solution quantity of V and Ti {{and the amount of}} precipitation are increased, and the precipitation shape transforms from cube to sphere. Therefore the hardness and toughness of steel are greatly improved. In this study, 0. 2 % V and 0. 2 % Ti were added into NM 400. As a result, the precipitation of V and Ti, in form of carbide and nitride, was the smallest and dispersed, and the grain size was the smallest, which leaded to the best performance. The conclusion is that, to ameliorate {{the performance of}} NM 400, the optimal additive amount of V and Ti is 0. 2 % no matter whether adding Ce or not...|$|R
40|$|This study {{develops}} strain-gradient theories for isotropic {{and crystal}} plasticity. The following four theories were developed and numerically implemented: * A one-dimensional theory {{to understand the}} basic nature of strain gradient theories; * A small deformation crystal plasticity theory; * A small deformation theory for isotropic viscoplastic materials; and, * A large deformation theory for isotropic viscoplastic materials. The theories are based on: (i) microstresses consistent with microforce balances; (ii) a mechanical version of the two laws of thermodynamics for isothermal conditions, that includes via the microstresses the work performed during viscoplastic flow; and (iii) a thermodynamically consistent constitutive theory. The microscopic force balance, when augmented by constitutive relations for the microscopic stresses, results in a nonlocal flow rule {{in the form of}} a second-order partial differential equation for the plastic strain. The flow rule, being nonlocal, requires microscopic boundary conditions. The theories are numerically implemented by writing a user-element for a commercial finite element program. Using this numerical capability, the major characteristics of the theory are revealed by studying the standard problem of simple shear of a constrained plate. Additional boundary-value problems representing idealized two-dimensional models of grain-size-strengthening and <b>dispersion-strengthening</b> of metallic materials are also studied using the small deformation version of the isotropic theory. For problems that do not involve boundary conditions on plastic strain, the flow rule may be considered to be in conventional form, with additional strengthening terms, instead of a partial differential equation. The finite deformation version of the isotropic theory is numerically implemented by writing a user material model for this approach. Using this implementation, the problems of stabilization of widths of localization shear bands, strengthening in pure bending, and depth dependence of micro and nano-indentation hardness are studied. by Suvrat Pratapsinh Lele.

40|$|In this study, various weight {{percentages}} (0, 0. 05 and 0. 1 wt. %) of graphene nanosheet doped lead-free Sn– 8 Zn– 3 Bi solder alloys {{were investigated}} {{in order to}} analyze the electromigration induced microstructural development and mechanical properties, such as the shear strength and microhardness, {{as well as the}} melting characteristics of the novel composite solders. The effect of electromigration on the solder joint was systematically studied by using a newly developed wire-type testing configuration. The samples were stressed under a current density of 5 × 103 A/cm 2 at 100 °C for different aging periods in order to study the electromigration induced reliability issues. For solders with and without the graphene, γ-Cu 5 Zn 8 intermetallic compounds (IMCs) were found at the solder and Cu pad interface. The majority of the added graphene nanosheets were proved to be uniformly distributed in the β-Sn matrix. After the graphene addition, needle-like Zn-rich phases with a finer microstructure were discovered in the solder matrix. The growth rate of the IMC layers of the graphene doped solder was slower in comparison to IMC layers in plain solder at the interfaces. With 0. 1 wt. % graphene addition, the measured IMC growth rate was decreased from 30. 9 × 10 − 14 to 24. 9 × 10 − 14 cm 2 /s. The melting temperature of the doped solder measured by differential scanning calorimeter (DSC) showed little difference from that of the plain solder. The Vickers hardness, up to 29. 9 Hv with 0. 1 wt. % graphene addition, is 9. 1 % higher than that of plain solder. The graphene doped solder consistently demonstrated higher ball shear strength as a function of aging time. The ball shear strength value was increased by 10. 2 ± 0. 8 % than that of plain solders during the whole aging period. The improvement was due to the <b>dispersion-strengthening</b> mechanism, refined microstructure and excellent intrinsic mechanical properties of graphene. Moreover, fracture occurred at the IMC interface of the doped samples showed a ductile fracture pattern with a large distribution of dimples on the rough surface.

40|$|To {{examine the}} {{potential}} of rapid solidification technology (RST) {{as a means to}} fabricate <b>dispersion-strengthened</b> aluminides, cylindrical compression samples were machined from the gauge section of their tensile specimens and tested in air at 1300 K.

A particularly strong dispersoid-dislocation interaction was identified as reason for the excellent creep properties of carbide <b>dispersion-strengthened</b> aluminum.

The alloy was prepared by reaction milling; its microstructural characterization by transmission electron microscopy had been recently reported elsewhere. Creep tests were here performed at 773, 973 and 1123 K, under loads that produced steady-state creep rates between 9 x 10 (- 7) and 2 x 10 (- 4) s(- 1). Two deformation models, available in the literature, were considered: dislocation creep, where the strain rate {{is controlled by the}} dislocation-particle interaction within the grains, and diffusional creep, controlled by the interaction between grain-boundary dislocations and particles.
