I resulted that the common wheat seeds can be produced with the low usage of water so that drought LEDCs can also produce common wheat seeds. However I resulted in two different aspects.

My original intention, that of using the computer as an educational tool in the ethical and social development of primary school children, has remained the same. The changes occurred in my methods of achieving this intention. My rationale for promoting the computer as an educational resource is manifold. For example, the world that these children will be entering as adults will be entirely computerized and automated. This next generation must have more than a passing familiarity with the computer, if they are to survive in an increasingly high-tech environment. Also, the computer has the potential to reach a greater audience, as people are becoming far more visually inclined than verbally inclined. Whether this trend is positive or negative, the fact remains that this is happening. Immediate visual impact is the goal of modern advertising. The advantage that this medium had in relation to my project was that an entire class of children could watch simultaneously, and then participate in a group discussion of what they had viewed...|$|R

40|$|This {{manuscript}} extends {{my research}} in two areas: Southern literature and music. As {{a poet and}} a Southerner, I am interested in language patterns distinct to the South and ways they translate into poetry. I use my own poetry to explore dialect and to respond to earlier works by established Southern poets. Contemporary popular music also influences my work. Like the southern dialect, contemporary music has its own language conventions, and my poetry responds to these conventions. ^ I began writing poems about the South and the Southern cultural experience, as I know it, along {{with a series of}} poems responding to/talking back to work by established Southern male writers. My intent is to add to the discourse a female view in an historic context. I am particularly interested in ways the stereotype of the Southern Lady translates into contemporary Southern culture, especially for female Southern poets. ^ When I began considering ways that my love of popular music might work with <b>my</b> poetry, <b>I</b> instantly <b>thought</b> <b>about</b> <b>my</b> own life memories inextricably wrapped up with my music memories. Using an historical framework, I wrote a series of autobiographical poems using chart-topping song titles from the week of my birth for each year of my life as ekphrastic cues. While the songs themselves became less important to me, the titles, and occasionally a few lyrics, forced me to rethink each year of my life through the lens of pop culture references. ^ Ultimately, I have created a semi-autobiographical collection based on particular cultural and historical frameworks. However, I do caution readers that I have frequently fictionalized portions of the text where <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> overall effect would be strengthened. ...|$|R

I have a queer family of origin (a few years after I was born, {{my mother and father}} separated, and my father came out as a gay man). I am also queer (I came out as a lesbian in my teens). <b>I</b> had never <b>thought</b> <b>about</b> <b>my</b> sexuality in intergenerational terms before. I’m second generation queer. I had not at that stage read anything about the experiences of a so-called second generation.

One obvious reason for this silence is the desire not to give ammunition to the enemy. That children may grow up to adopt a lesbian/gay subjectivity is a popular argument drawn on by those who oppose lesbian and gay parenting (Clarke, 2001; Clarke & Kitzinger, 2004; Hicks, 2003, 2005; Riggs, 2004). I do not want to use this piece to unpick reasons for this silence.

This was my general view of the matter. Of particular places, I recollected that Garval Hill was a famous piece of rough upland pasture for rearing young colts, and teaching them to throw their feet; that Minion Burn had the finest yellow trout in the country; that Seggy-cleugh was unequalled for woodcocks; that Bengibbert Moors afforded excellent moorfowl-shooting; and that the clear, bubbling fountain called the Harper's Well was the best recipe in {{the world on the}} morning after a HARD-GO with my neighbour fox-hunters. Still, these ideas recalled, by degrees, pictures of which I had since learned to appreciate the merit--scenes of silent loneliness, where extensive moors, undulating into wild hills, were only disturbed by the whistle of the plover or the crow of the heathcock; wild ravines creeping up into mountains, filled with natural wood, and which, when traced downwards along the path formed by shepherds and nutters, were found gradually to enlarge and deepen, as each formed a channel to its own brook, sometimes bordered by steep banks of earth, often with the more romantic boundary of naked rocks or cliffs crested with oak, mountain ash, and hazel--all gratifying the eye the more that the scenery was, from the bare nature of the country around, totally unexpected.|$|R

The four stories I included here all share the idea that people are not always as we think they are. Even those people we are close to and know for years are often full of surprises. Also, it is easy to misjudge someone we do not know and jump to conclusions about him or her as seen in "The Barn Swallow. " Another idea is that most of the stories in some way deal with a character leaving. I did not realize this until I was concentrating on finding connections. This idea I think stems from my fear of losing those I love. I fear this because I feel that in losing them, if not all, a part of me will be alone. All the understanding I share with a particular person is lost if they leave. In losing them, I lose a part of myself. While I wrote, <b>I</b> occasionally <b>thought</b> <b>about</b> <b>my</b> own life and how just during this past semester I have discovered more about myself. This change was not brought about solely by myself. I have been greatly affected by people I have come in contact with and those to whom I have recently grown close. This change has caused me to reevaluate my life and ask myself, "What do I really want?" There were times I was torn between two answers where neither one seemed entirely right, or even worse, both answers were ideal but I could only chose one. Looking back now, I think most of my decisions were for the best mostly because I have been a lot happier lately and feel understood by those who are important to me. Though I have created all the characters, I find it interesting that I can learn from the very people I created. Perhaps it is a meaning that only I as the writer can relate to, or maybe you as the reader will find something for yourself. I ask you to take from it whatever you find and make it your own, and if all you find is the enjoyment of reading a story, then either way I will feel I have succeeded.

40|$|Betty Tyson {{was convicted}} of murder in May 1973 in Rochester, NY. She was sentenced to 25 years to life in prison. Her trial was hasty and the jury of peers she faced was all white. The {{evidence}} against her was tainted yet she was still found guilty. I was 9 years old when I first heard this story. When I decided to pursue my Master in Fine Art, I remembered this story and wanted to use my journalism instincts that I developed during my undergraduate degree at SUNY Brockport. I approached my thesis committee for approval to pursue this story for my MFA thesis film. The struggle I endured during this journey was stressful at times but enlightening all the time. I discovered 2 ̆ 2 me 2 ̆ 2 inside the filmmaking process. Additionally I discovered that student film crews are not dependable and that I had to discover my own niche in the filmmaking community. During my research {{a lot of things}} came to light, even the unexpected, which filled this journey with adventurous and educational endeavors. Even Betty was a little complicated at times. She came through for me when <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> all was lost. Former Mayor William Johnson also came through as a primary source and a strong mentor to push me forward when <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> <b>about</b> giving up. <b>My</b> biggest dilemma was how to tell the story. The answer was to let Betty tell it and do not drown my film with the re-enactments I had planned and had filmed. When <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> my film was finished, it was too long. I did not want to part with some of my hard work. I learned to let go and I remembered to not underestimate the audience 2 ̆ 7 s intelligence, somebody is going to get it. Taking out the obvious things and redundant statements, I discovered a way to let all of the participants tell the story as they supported Betty 2 ̆ 7 s story. The film was received well and informed a new generation who had never heard of Betty Tyson...|$|R
40|$|As I {{have listened}} to, and {{recently}} reread the addresses of our WSCA Presidents, I {{have been moved}} and challenged by their words and their wisdom. And their speeches are challenging. They have exhorted us to embrace quality discourse, to welcome change, to maintain the centrality of communication in the university of the 21 st century, and to avoid becoming out-of-touch whiners. I wondered, what can I add to their words in my own address? Over this past year, <b>I</b> have <b>thought</b> <b>about</b> <b>my</b> life as a communication professor. How are my times similar and different {{from those who have}} come before me? I was born the year Disneyland opened. During my formative years, I watched movies and TV showing the life of the professor. This was a person, usually a man, who enjoyed great respect, worked in a large book-lined office with comfortable leather furniture, and lectured to enraptured students coming to class after the pep rally. Students lined up after class to gain just one more pearl of wisdom. These professors appeared to have ample time to think and write while smoking a pipe, and they left campus by 5 : 30 PM in a sporty English touring car, arriving to a spacious, comfortable home. When I compare this 1950 s vision of the professorate to my life, and I suspect, to your lives as well, at first glance, reality seems much different. And, in fact, when I gather together with academics, we seen to regale each other, not with stories of how wonderful our careers are, rather, with those things we wish were different or better. The theme seems to be that we are tired of trying to do more with less—to teach more, to adapt to changing economic and political environments, to publish more, and to cope with all the challenges my Presidential predecessors mentioned. In so many ways, it does feel like we are always expected to do more and do it with less. And yet, when I sit quietly and talk one-on-one with communication professors, I have yet to meet a single person who has told me they hate their job. They’ll complain all right, and I’ll join in with them. Yet, when we think about it, I suspect that most of us could not imagine a life that we would love as well as being a professor. For you students who are joining the professorate, it feels like your day cannot come soon enough. Why do we love what we do so much? Searching for an answer, I picked up the trusty WSCA convention program and thumbed through it. And, there I found my answer, not in the Presidential addresses, nor from the compelling, if esoteric, titles of convention papers, but rather from another event on the WSCA program. In fact, this event will take place just a few minutes from now, here at the WSCA luncheon—the Distinguished Service Award ceremony. I know that for many of us, besides the Sock Hop, this is our favorite part of the WSCA convention. Why? Perhaps because we enjoy the opportunity to look back on the careers of some extraordinary people. We get a vision of the academic we wish to be. When we look at the winners of the Distinguished Service Award each year, I believe that what we see are people who are not focusing on doing more with less. Rather, what these precious colleagues {{have in common is that}} they are people who are doing more with more...|$|R
