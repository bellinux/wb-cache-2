5|$|After {{moving to}} Amsterdam, Anne and Margot Frank were {{enrolled}} in school—Margot in public school and Anne in a Montessori school. Margot demonstrated ability in arithmetic, and Anne showed aptitude for reading and writing. Anne's friend, Hanneli Goslar, later recalled that from early childhood, Frank frequently wrote, although she shielded her work with <b>her</b> <b>hands</b> <b>and</b> refused to discuss the content of her writing.|$|E
5|$|Zero Mission is {{the first}} game in the Metroid series to include a {{sequence}} in which the player controls Samus without her Power Suit. In {{this portion of the}} game, Samus is more vulnerable to damage, must crawl through ducts on <b>her</b> <b>hands</b> <b>and</b> knees without the help of her Morph Ball mode, and has a weak pistol that briefly stuns enemies as her only weapon. However, Samus retains all energy tanks she acquired previously.|$|E
6000|$|He took <b>her</b> <b>hand</b> <b>and</b> held it. [...] "I'd do anything," [...] said Kipps, {{and had not}} the temerity to add, [...] "for you." [...] He stopped awkwardly. He shook <b>her</b> <b>hand</b> <b>and</b> said, [...] "Good-bye." ...|$|R
60|$|Walthew, bending down, kissed <b>her</b> <b>hand</b> <b>and</b> {{then lifted}} his hat.|$|R
60|$|The {{hand was}} still in <b>her</b> <b>hand,</b> <b>and</b> Jeanie began to wish for nothing {{so much in the}} world as to gather some of these roses. She put out <b>her</b> <b>hand</b> <b>and</b> she plucked one, and there before her stood a strange creature--a dwarf, dressed in yellow and red, with a very angry face.|$|R
5|$|Then {{the girl}} was pulled into the tent and the men started to beat on the shields so her screams could not be heard. Six men entered the tent to have {{intercourse}} with the girl, after which they forced her onto her master's bed. Two men grabbed <b>her</b> <b>hands,</b> <b>and</b> two men her wrists. The angel of death put a rope {{around her neck and}} while two men pulled the rope, the old woman stabbed the girl between her ribs with a knife. Thereafter, the relatives of the dead chieftain arrived with a burning torch and set the ship aflame. It is said that the fire facilitates the voyage to the realm of the dead.|$|E
5|$|There was {{no blood}} on her feet or other debris, such as the sugar {{that was on the}} downstairs floor. Low traces of lead were found on <b>her</b> <b>hands</b> <b>and</b> {{forehead}} at postmortem, but the levels were consistent with the everyday handling of things around the house. A scientist, Mr Elliott, testified that if she had loaded 18 cartridges into a magazine he would expect to see more lead on her hands. The {{blood on her}} nightdress was consistent with her own, and no trace of firearm-discharge residue was on it. Given that she was wearing just a nightdress, {{it was hard to see}} how she could have carried the cartridges.|$|E
5|$|From December 1559 Amy Dudley {{lived at}} Cumnor Place, near Abingdon in Berkshire (now in Oxfordshire). The house, an altered 14th century monastic complex, was rented {{by a friend}} of the Dudleys and {{possible}} relative of Amy's, Sir Anthony Forster. He lived there with his wife and Mrs. Odingsells and Mrs. Owen, relations of the house's owner. Lady Dudley's chamber was a large, sumptuous upper story apartment, the best of the house, with a separate entrance and staircase leading up to it. At the house's rear there were a terrace garden, a pond, and a deer park. Amy Dudley received the proceeds of the Robsart estate directly into <b>her</b> <b>hands</b> <b>and</b> largely paid for her own household, which comprised about 10 servants. She regularly ordered dresses and finery as accounts and a letter from her of as late as 24August 1560 show. She also received presents from her husband.|$|E
60|$|He pressed <b>her</b> <b>hand,</b> <b>and</b> was darting off, but she {{detained}} him.|$|R
60|$|He stooped over <b>her</b> <b>hand,</b> <b>and</b> slobbered kisses {{upon her}} unresponsive glove.|$|R
60|$|He took <b>her</b> <b>hand,</b> <b>and</b> {{waited a}} moment trying to compose himself.|$|R
5|$|The Vishnudharmottara Purana {{describes}} {{the iconography of}} Vishnu. While the lotus and shankha are held in the upper hands, the lower hands rest on two dwarf figures: the personified gada and chakra. The gada personified as a slim-waisted woman, holds a chamara (chowry) in <b>her</b> <b>hands</b> <b>and</b> is adored with ornaments, with Vishnu's right hand resting on her head; chakra stands as a man on Vishnu's left. The personified weapons known as Ayudhapurusha emerge in Gupta era (320–550 CE) sculptures. The personified Kaumodaki {{is also known as}} Gada-devi (the suffix devi means goddess) or Gada-nari ("gada-woman"). Since the Sanskrit word gada is feminine, gada is regarded as a woman. A Gupta Vishnu in Udayagiri Caves depicts Vishnu accompanied by Gadadevi and the personified chakra. Gadadevi often appears in Vishnu images from Kashmir, including Vishnu's four-headed form Vaikuntha Chaturmurti. She holds a chamara and looks in adoration towards her master, whose hand rests on her head. She wears a crown or has an elaborate hairstyle. Apart from a lower garment, she might wear a blouse or have a bare torso. She is depicted emerging from the gada.|$|E
5|$|Treatises {{such as the}} Vishnudharmottara Purana {{and various}} Agamas {{describe}} the iconography of the ayudhapurushas. Shakti is depicted as a red-hued woman seated on a wolf. The Danda is a fearful black-complexioned man with wrathful red eyes. The Khadga is also a dark and angry man. Pasha is depicted as a male snake with seven hoods. Dhvaja ("banner") is a yellow-coloured strong man with his mouth wide open. The Trishula is a handsome black-complexioned man with lovely eyebrows. The Shankha {{is described as a}} white male with adorable eyes. The Bana (arrow) is a red-coloured man with beautiful eyes, however the Vaikhaashagama describes it to be a black-complexioned eunuch with three eyes, dressed in white clothes and riding on the wind. The Dhanus (bow) is a red lotus coloured female with a stringed bow on her head. The Vishnudharmottara Purana describes Chakra as man with a fat belly and round eyes, decorated with various ornaments and holding a chamara (chowry) and with Vishnu's left hand on his head. The slim-waisted woman Gada holds a chowry in <b>her</b> <b>hands</b> <b>and</b> is adored with ornaments, with Vishnu's right hand resting on her head.|$|E
5|$|At {{the urging}} of both Yeesha and Esher, the player travels across four Ages, {{collecting}} four slates that unlock the tablet's power. Esher occasionally appears in the Ages to offer his counsel, or reveal the histories of his people and the worlds the player explores. Once all four slates are collected, Esher requests that the player bring the tablet {{to him in the}} now-unlocked Age of Myst. The player is then returned to K'veer, where they have four possible choices. Travelling to Myst without the tablet will cause Esher to angrily abandon the player with no way out. If Esher is given the tablet, he will explain he wishes to use the tablet for domination, and will also leave the player trapped. If the player gives the tablet to Yeesha, the tablet simply slips through <b>her</b> <b>hands</b> <b>and</b> disappears into the ground; she walks away, disappointed, leaving the player trapped in D'ni. The only good ending involves giving the Bahro the tablet, ending their enslavement. Arriving at Releeshahn, the new home Age of the D'ni, Yeesha and Atrus thank the player and speak of a new chapter for the D'ni people; Esher is handed over to the Bahro to be punished for his crimes. The game ends on a visit to Releeshahn.|$|E

5|$|Decorating of the Bride {{is one of}} Jovanović's Orientalist works, notable {{examples}} of which include The Wounded Montenegrin (1882), Fencing Lesson (1883) and Cockfight (1897). The painting is undated, and it remains unknown exactly when it was composed. Petar Petrović, the curator of the National Museum of Serbia, dates it to ca. 1885–86. Art historian Lilien Filipovitch-Robinson writes that it was painted in 1888. What is known for certain is that Jovanović painted it in the mid-1880s {{on one of his}} travels through the Balkans. One source contends that it was composed while the artist was visiting the Ottoman town of Shkodër, in present-day Albania. Another version of the painting {{is said to have been}} created by the artist not long after the original, but is considered lost. An 1891 journal article describes this version as depicting two women decorating the bride, while to her left the bride's mother clasps <b>her</b> <b>hands</b> <b>and</b> cries with joy. This version is said to have shown a girl on the verge of tears standing by a door to the far left. On the right, a woman and young girl could be seen offering gifts to the bride. During conservatory examinations in 2009, it was discovered that Decorating of the Bride had been painted over a similar, earlier work. The artist appears to have shortened the right side of the canvas by about , altered the appearance of the interior, and slightly modified the left side of the painting. Save for the shortened canvas length, the right side of the painting is identical to that in the final version.|$|E
5|$|In the Holy Roman Empire (and {{elsewhere}} in Central/Eastern Europe), women who killed their newborn could be {{liable to be}} placed in an open grave, and have a stake hammered into their heart. A detailed description of an execution in this manner comes from 17th century Košice (then in Hungary, now in eastern Slovakia). A woman to be executed for infanticide involved an executioner and two assistants to help him. First, a grave some one-and-a-half ell deep was dug. The woman was placed within it, <b>her</b> <b>hands</b> <b>and</b> feet secured by driving nails through them. The executioner placed a small thorn bush upon her face. He then placed, and held vertically, a wooden stave at her heart to mark its location, while his assistants piled earth on the woman, keeping her head free of earth {{at the behest of the}} clerics, however, as to do otherwise would have quickened the death process. Once the earth had been piled upon her, the executioner grabbed with a pair of tongs a rod made of iron, which had been made red hot. He positioned the glowing iron rod beside the wooden stave, and as one of his assistants hammered the rod in, the other assistant emptied a trough of earth upon the woman's head. It is said that a scream was heard, and that the earth actually moved upwards for a moment, before all was over.|$|E
5|$|In the Metamorphoses by Antoninus Liberalis, written {{somewhere in}} the 2nd or 3rd century A.D., the myth is set in Phoenicia, near Mount Lebanon. Here King Thias, son of Belus and Orithyia, had a {{daughter}} named Smyrna. Being of great beauty, she was sought by men from far and wide. She had devised many tricks in order to delay her parents and defer the day they would choose a husband for her. Smyrna had been driven mad by desire for her father {{and did not want}} anybody else. At first she hid her desires, eventually telling her nurse, Hippolyte, the secret of her true feelings. Hippolyte told the king that a girl of exalted parentage wanted to lie with him, but in secret. The affair lasted {{for an extended period of}} time, and Smyrna became pregnant. At this point, Thias desired to know who she was so he hid a light, illuminating the room and discovering Smyrna's identity when she entered. In shock, Smyrna gave birth prematurely to her child. She then raised <b>her</b> <b>hands</b> <b>and</b> said a prayer, which was heard by Zeus who took pity on her and turned her into a tree. Thias killed himself, and it was on the wish of Zeus that the child was brought up and named Adonis.|$|E

25|$|On March 26, 2004, Austin {{allegedly}} assaulted {{his girlfriend}} Tess Broussard during a dispute at his Texas home, {{according to a}} San Antonio Police Department report. Broussard claimed that Austin grabbed her, and she began struggling with him, who eventually threw her to the ground. Broussard landed on <b>her</b> <b>hands</b> <b>and</b> knees, and later told officers she had injured her right hand. Broussard provided a written statement to police, who photographed her injuries.|$|E
25|$|In Part 2 of his report, Usher {{stated that}} there were two deaths in recent years at the Casa that {{warranted}} investigations, but no one was charged. He also reported that in 2010, when de Faria visited Sedona, Arizona, the police department investigated him because a woman said he took <b>her</b> <b>hands</b> <b>and</b> placed them on his genitals; Mr de Faria also tried to pull down her skirt. The case never went to court; one of his associates encouraged the woman to drop the allegations.|$|E
25|$|In {{one of the}} Inuit {{myths of}} the Sun and the Moon, the sun deity Sukh-eh-nukh —known as Malina in Greenland carries an oil lamp which gets {{overturned}} spilling oil and soot on <b>her</b> <b>hands</b> <b>and</b> she blackens the face of her brother, the moon deity Ahn-ing-ah-neh (Anningan).
