5|$|When a party {{calling itself}} Conservative {{can think of}} {{nothing better than to}} outbid the Government's {{election}} promises; when <b>it</b> <b>demands</b> economy in one breath and increased spending in the next; when it proposes an immediate tax cut regardless of inflationary results... when in short, the Conservative party no longer gives us a conservative alternative after twenty-one years... then our political system desperately requires an opposition prepared to stand for something more than the improbable chance of quick victory.|$|E
5|$|Kant {{argued that}} {{rational}} beings {{can never be}} treated merely as means to ends; they must always also be treated as ends themselves, requiring that their own reasoned motives must be equally respected. This derives from Kant's claim that reason motivates morality: <b>it</b> <b>demands</b> that we respect reason as a motive in all beings, including other people. A rational being cannot rationally consent to being used merely {{as a means to}} an end, so they must always be treated as an end. Kant justified this by arguing that moral obligation is a rational necessity: that which is rationally willed is morally right. Because all rational agents rationally will themselves to be an end and never merely a means, it is morally obligatory that they are treated as such. This {{does not mean that we}} can never treat a human as a means to an end, but that when we do, we also treat him as an end in himself.|$|E

40|$|AbstractStrategic <b>IT</b> <b>demand</b> {{plays an}} {{important}} role in the success of a business. This process must be addressed at the strategic level by the board of directors and senior executives. This paper describes the results of an exploratory case study conducted to ascertain the status of strategic <b>IT</b> <b>demand</b> management in organizations. This case study indicates whether organizations have clear and well-defined processes and whether these processes are allocated the necessary resources, for example, whether demand interacts with the project portfolio, what use is made of this portfolio, and also what types of standards and methodologies are used for strategic <b>IT</b> <b>demand</b> management process. The results of the study provide a basis for the design of a global framework covering all three levels of the <b>IT</b> <b>demand</b> management process (strategic, tactical and operational), which we intend to use to design a methodology for strategic <b>IT</b> <b>demand</b> management...|$|R

If there is no guitarist available, the compás is rendered through hand clapping (palmas) or by hitting a table with the knuckles. The guitarist uses techniques like strumming (rasgueado) or tapping the soundboard (golpe). Changes of chords emphasize the most important downbeats.|$|E

If sung {{as written}} {{throughout}} (alternative phrases are provided at several {{points in the}} score), there are three high E-flats (above high C), two staccato and one sustained; there are also numerous uses of high C and D-flat.

25|$|UV water {{treatment}} devices {{can be used}} for well water and surface water disinfection. UV treatment compares favorably with other water disinfection systems in terms of cost, labor, and the need for technically trained personnel for operation. Water chlorination treats larger organisms and offers residual disinfection, but these systems are expensive because they need special operator training and a steady supply of a potentially hazardous material. Finally, boiling of water is the most reliable treatment method but <b>it</b> <b>demands</b> labor, and imposes a high economic cost. UV treatment is rapid and, in terms of primary energy use, approximately 20,000 times more efficient than boiling.|$|E

25|$|When organised, the {{defending}} team will offer no resistance until the attacking team has advanced {{to a certain}} height on the pitch. The pressure height, or at which depth the midfielders should start acting as first and second defenders, depends {{on a lot of}} factors. For example, as higher pressure is more tiring, <b>it</b> <b>demands</b> players with good stamina. In general, a defensive-minded team will tend to stay lower, thus diminishing defensive risks as opponents get less space. This however, also gives them a longer way to the goal {{in the event of a}} break and counter-attack, making the long through ball a typical alternative.|$|E
25|$|In Catalonia, the Catalan {{language}} {{policy has}} been challenged by some Catalan intellectuals like Albert Boadella. Since 2006, the liberal Citizens - Party of the Citizenry, currently the main opposition party, {{has been one of}} the most consistent critics of the Catalan language policy within Catalonia. The local Catalan branch of the People's Party has a more ambiguous position on the issue: on one hand, <b>it</b> <b>demands</b> a bilingual Catalan–Spanish education and a more balanced language policy that would defend Catalan without favoring it over Spanish, whereas on the other hand, a few local PP politicians have supported in their municipalities measures privileging Catalan over Spanish and it has defended some aspects of the official language policies, sometimes against the positions of its colleagues from other parts of Spain.|$|E
25|$|The 3–3–1–3 {{was formed}} of a {{modification}} to the Dutch 4–3–3 system Ajax had developed. Coaches like Louis van Gaal and Johan Cruyff {{brought it to}} even further attacking extremes and the system eventually {{found its way to}} Barcelona, where players such as Andrés Iniesta and Xavi were reared into 3–3–1–3's philosophy. <b>It</b> <b>demands</b> intense pressing high up the pitch especially from the forwards, and also an extremely high defensive line, basically playing the whole game inside the opponents' half. It requires extreme technical precision and rapid ball circulation since one slip or dispossession can result in a vulnerable counter-attack situation. Cruyff's variant relied on a flatter and wider midfield, but Van Gaal used an offensive midfielder and midfield diamond to link up with the front three more effectively. Marcelo Bielsa has used the system with some success with Argentina's and Chile's national teams and is currently one of the few high-profile managers to use the system in competition today. Diego Simeone had also tried it occasionally at River Plate.|$|E

25|$|Chase {{reports from}} orbit that an Ashiyyur warship is inbound at high speed. Then another appears, slowing to make orbit around Sim's world of exile. Alex warns Chase {{to abandon their}} rented ship for the Corsarius; she does so just before the first Ashiyyur warship destroys their rented ship. Alex joins her and learns that the Armstrong drive on the Corsarius won’t be fully charged for about a day. Their problem is to stay alive until the Armstrong drive is ready. They borrow a classic {{maneuver}} from one of Sim’s battles and leave orbit at high speed headed directly toward the incoming Ashiyyur warship, which cannot slow its speed quickly enough to meet them. It uses lasers to disable Corsarius magnetic drives; Chase realizes too late that she has forgotten to raise the ship’s shields. The Ashiyyur warship reverses its trajectory and reaches them about ten hours before they can jump. <b>It</b> <b>demands</b> their surrender. Through a strategem, Alex and Chase are able to fire Corsarius’ major weapons at it, damaging it badly and forcing it to flee. Ten hours later, the interstellar drive activates. It is not an Armstrong drive but something else, product of Rashim Machesney’s genius. In an eye blink, Corsarius is in orbit around Rimway, and safe.|$|E
500|$|... "From This Moment On" [...] {{was written}} during a soccer game in Italy. Twain once explained, “We were in Italy at a soccer game. My husband loves sports. I don’t know {{the game that}} well, so my mind drifted and I started writing.” Initially, Twain thought that [...] "From This Moment On" [...] would be perfect for singer Celine Dion; however, as Twain and Lange {{developed}} the song, they concluded that it would work best as a duet. While their first choice for the duet was Elton John, they chose country singer Bryan White. Twain later described White as [...] "the best male voice in country music. Beyond country music! He's an excellent singer. So {{he needed to be}} on this record, because the song soars. <b>It</b> <b>demands</b> that. <b>It</b> <b>demands</b> dynamics." [...] White explained that, by the time he went to the recording, the song was mostly finalized, and described it as 'extremely challenging' vocally.|$|E

At Metacritic, which assigns a normalized rating out of 100 to reviews from mainstream critics, the film received an average score of 66, based on 36 reviews. Claudia Puig of USA Today described the film as [...] "one of the most innovative, twisting, turning art films of the past decade." [...] Drew McWeeny gave the film a glowing review, saying <b>it</b> <b>demands</b> repeat viewing, with Peter Travers of Rolling Stone agreeing. Richard Roeper and guest critic A.O. Scott gave the film a [...] "two thumbs up" [...] rating. Todd Gilchrist of IGN applauded the performances of Jackman and Bale whilst praising Nolan for making [...] "this complex story as easily understandable and effective as he made the outwardly straightforward comic book adaptation (Batman Begins) dense and sophisticated... any truly great performance is almost as much showmanship as it is actual talent, and Nolan possesses both in spades." [...] CNN.com and Village Voice film critic Tom Charity listed it amongst his best films of 2006. Philip French of The Observer recommended the film, comparing the rivalry between the two main characters to that of Mozart and Salieri in the highly acclaimed Amadeus.|$|E
