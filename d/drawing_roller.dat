50|$|Ring {{spinning}} is {{a method}} of spinning fibres, such as cotton, flax or wool, to make a yarn. The ring frame developed from the throstle frame, which in its turn was a descendant of Arkwright's water frame. Ring spinning is a continuous process, unlike mule spinning which uses an intermittent action. In ring spinning, the roving is first attenuated by using <b>drawing</b> <b>rollers,</b> then spun and wound around a rotating spindle which in its turn is contained within an independently rotating ring flyer. Traditionally ring frames could only {{be used for the}} coarser counts, but they could be attended by semi-skilled labour.|$|R

2500|$|Whilst this {{is going}} on, the spindle {{carriage}} is being drawn away from the rollers, at a pace very slightly exceeding {{the rate at which}} the roving is coming forth. This is called the [...] gain of the carriage, its purpose being to eliminate all irregularities in the fineness of the thread. Should a thick place in the roving come through the rollers, it would resist the efforts of the spindle to twist it; and, if passed in this condition, it would seriously deteriorate the quality of the yarn, and impede subsequent operations. As, however, the twist, spreading itself over the level thread, gives firmness to this portion, the thick and untwisted part yields to the draught of the spindle, and, as it approaches the tenuity of the remainder, it receives the twist it had hitherto refused to take. The carriage, which is borne upon wheels, continues its outward progress, until it reaches the extremity of its traverse, which is [...] from the roller beam. The revolution of the spindles cease, the <b>drawing</b> <b>rollers</b> stop.|$|R
40|$|AbstractThis paper {{presents}} {{a new approach}} to the influence of the process parameters on non-conventional technology for <b>drawing</b> in cassette <b>roller</b> die. This technology combines two conventional methods of plastic deformation. The rolling, in this method the wire is passed through the two pairs of <b>roller</b> and, the <b>drawing,</b> using the drawing force that exist at the exit of the wire between the rolls. In conclusion there are two forces involved in the process of plastic deformation: drawing force and rolling force. It has been shown that these forces are strongly influenced by variation of certain process parameters such as: the initial diameter of the sample, the elongation coefficient, the contact surface roll/sample, the average pressure of rolling, the friction coefficient and the rollers working radius. The results depicts a helpful insight into the effects of the process parameters in the wire <b>drawing</b> with cassette <b>roller</b> die, thus furnishing the basic guidelines for process design and optimization...|$|R
40|$|In {{this thesis}} we derive {{mathematical}} {{models for the}} glass sheet redraw process {{for the production of}} very thin glass sheets. In the redraw process, a prefabricated glass block is fed into a furnace, where it is heated and stretched by the application of <b>draw</b> <b>rollers</b> to reduce its thickness. Redrawn sheets may be used in various applications including smartphone and battery technology. Our aims are to investigate the factors determining the final thickness profile of a glass sheet produced by this process, as well as the growth of out-of-plane deformations in the sheet during redraw. Our method is to model the glass sheet using NavierâStokes equations and free-surface conditions, and exploit small aspect ratios in the sheet to simplify and solve these equations using asymptotic expansions. We first consider a simple two-dimensional sheet to determine which physical effects should be taken into account in modelling the redraw process. Next, we derive a mathematical model for redraw of a thin threedimensional sheet. We consider the limits in which the heater zone is either short or long compared with the sheet half-width. The resulting reduced models predict the thickness profile of the redrawn sheet and the initial shape required to redraw a product of uniform thickness. We then derive mathematical models for buckling of thin viscous sheets during redraw. For buckling of a two-dimensional glass sheet due to gravity-induced compression, we predict the evolution of the centreline and investigate the early- and late-time behaviour of the system. For a three-dimensional glass sheet undergoing redraw, we use numerical solutions to investigate the behaviour of the sheet mid-surface. </p...|$|R

It was unveiled on August 25, 1934.The cross was carved in 1934 from a single block of gray granite, extracted from the Auguste Dumas quarry in Rivière-à-Pierre, Quebec. The cross weighs more than 42 tons and was transported to Quebec City on two cars by rail from Rivière-à-Pierre. The cross was then carried on a coaster to the Gaspé dock. From the dock, the cross was <b>drawn</b> on <b>rollers</b> using hoists by one of the first tractors to be used in Gaspé and erected using a rail system of pulleys and cables, driven by the strength of many horses and a tractor.A commemorative plaque located {{at the foot of the}} cross of Gaspé was inaugurated on August 23, 2009 (75 years after the erection of the granite cross), in memory of artisans of Rivière-à-Pierre, Quebec who extracted and cut this block of granite which become the monolithic cross.|$|R
5000|$|In 1867 {{the company}} began {{production}} of the first practical steam roller - the new machine's rollers were mounted at the front instead of the back and it weighed in excess of 30 tons. It was tested on the Military Road in Chatham, Star Hill in Rochester and in Hyde Park, London and the machine proved a huge success. Within a year, they were being exported around the world, including to France, India and the United States. A New York City chief engineer said of one of these, that [...] "in one day's rolling {{at a cost of}} 10 dollars, as much work was accomplished as in two days' rolling with a 7 ton <b>roller</b> <b>drawn</b> by eight horses at a cost of 20 dollars a day." ...|$|R
5000|$|These {{consist of}} a pair of rollers set 8-30 mm apart and {{counter-rotating}} with surface speed around 0.9 - 1.8 m.s−1. The bearings of the rollers are designed to deliver a pressure of 50 MPa or more. The bed of material <b>drawn</b> between the <b>rollers</b> emerges as a slab-like agglomeration of highly fractured particles. The energy efficiency of this process is comparatively high. Systems have been designed, including a de-agglomerator and separator, that will deliver material of cement fineness. However, particle size distribution is again a problem, and roll presses are now increasingly popular as a [...] "pre-grind" [...] process, with the cement finished in a single chamber ball mill. This gives good cement performance, and reduces energy consumption by 20-40% compared with a standard ball mill system.|$|R
50|$|The melt is cooled {{somewhat}} {{before leaving}} the die to yield a weak semi-solid tube. This tube's diameter is rapidly expanded via air pressure, and the tube is <b>drawn</b> upwards with <b>rollers,</b> stretching the plastic in both the transverse and draw directions. The drawing and blowing cause the film to be thinner than the extruded tube, and also preferentially aligns the polymer molecular chains in the direction that sees the most plastic strain. If the film is drawn {{more than it is}} blown (the final tube diameter is close to the extruded diameter) the polymer molecules will be highly aligned with the draw direction, making a film that is strong in that direction, but weak in the transverse direction. A film that has significantly larger diameter than the extruded diameter will have more strength in the transverse direction, but less in the draw direction.|$|R
25|$|Preparing is {{the process}} used in place of carding for long wools and hairs which would break on the card and {{therefore}} greatly reduce {{the quality of the}} worsted yarn produced. The maker-up or double-screw sheeting preparer is the first machine. This passes the fibre to and from delivery sheets via rollers, and ends with a lap of wool from six to eight feet long. The single screw can preparer is the most important machine of these, as it is here that the laps of wool or hair taken from the preceding boxes are prepared into a continuous sliver. The lap is placed on the feed sheet and carried forward to the back rollers. From the back rollers the fibres are delivered to the fallers, which with the aid of the front <b>rollers,</b> <b>draw</b> out the material into a continuous sliver. From the front rollers the sliver of fibres passes through a funnel, through the calender rollers and into a can which is placed directly underneath them. The material is now ready for the combing machine.|$|R
60|$|After {{looking at}} these things, we {{proceeded}} to view one of the model washing houses, which had been erected {{for the convenience of}} poor women. We entered a large hall, which was divided by low wood partitions into small apartments, in each of which a woman was washing. The whole process of washing clothes in two or three waters, and boiling them, can be effected without moving from the spot, or changing the tub. Each successive water is let out at the bottom, while fresh is let on from the top. When the clothes are ready to be boiled, a wooden cover is placed over them, and a stream of scalding steam is directed into the tub, by turning a stop cock; this boils the water in a few moments, effectually cleansing the clothes; they are then whirled in a hollow cylinder till nearly dry, after which they are <b>drawn</b> through two <b>rollers</b> covered with flannel, which presses every remaining particle of water out of them. The clothes are then hung upon frames, which shut into large closets, and are dried by steam in a very short space of time.|$|R
2500|$|Cleaning was {{important}} and until a formal ritual had been devised {{it was a}} dangerous operation. The vibration in a mule threw a lot of short fibres (or fly) into the air. It tended to accumulate on the carriage behind the spindles and {{in the region of}} the drafting rollers. Piking the stick meant placing the hand though the yarnsheet, and unclipping two sticks of underclearer rollers from beneath the drafting <b>rollers,</b> <b>drawing</b> them through the 1 ¼ in gap between two ends, stripping them of fly and replacing them on the next inward run. Cleaning the carriage top was far more dangerous. The minder would stop the mule on the outward run, and raise his hands above his head. The piecers would enter under the yarn sheet with a scavenger cloth on the carriage spindle rail and a brush on the roller beam, and run bent double {{the entire length of the}} mule, avoiding the rails and draw bands, and not letting themselves touch the yarn sheet. When they had finished they would run to agreed positions of safety where the minder could see both of them, and the minder would unclip the stang and start the mule. Before this ritual was devised, boys had been crushed. The mule was [...] long, the minder's eyesight might not have been good, the air in the mill was clouded with fly and another minder's boys might have been mistaken for his. The ritual became encoded in law.|$|R
40|$|An {{experimental}} apparatus for forming thin nominals glass by vertical drawing {{has been}} developed. The character {{and duration of}} transients {{in the area of}} sheet glass molding with thickness less than 2 mm in the stability of their geometri c parameters and physicochemical properties have been researched. The time-temperature regimes of drawing of thin nominals sheet glass have been determined. It was found that their molding should be carried out in the temperature range of 840 – 850 °C (glass viscosity 10 { 4. 8 }– 10 { 5 } Pa · s), since the detaching effect of surface tension forces does not lead to significant narrowing ribbon of the glass. According to the parameters of glass surface quality, glass drawn in this temperature range resembles float glass to some extent. However, it is characterized by the lower thickness (0. 5 mm). The temperature increase to 900 – 950 °C (in the active forming zone) causes the decrease of the surface quality and a significant narrowing of the glass ribbon at the expense of forces of surface tension. Being formed in the temperature range of 800 – 750 °C on the <b>roller</b> <b>drawing</b> device the glass ribbon requires more effort high. It reduces the efficiency of the process. The researches of toughness of thin nominals sheet glass demonstrate that the low-temperature ion-exchange treatment in the KNO 3 melt at the temperature of 400 – 500 °C causes significant increase of strength, microhardness and glass heat resistance. The concentration of K {+} ions exercises a decisive impact on glasses properties in this temperature range. Being processed the K{+}ions diffuse to a depth of 10 – 15 µm of a surface layer of the glass and cause high values of compressive stress...|$|R
40|$|Under the {{supervision}} of Professors William Beckman and John Mitchell; 139 pp. Heated rollers {{are used in the}} forest product, printing and plastic processing industry to regulate product temperature during web processing. Improved regulation of product temperatures during processing results in a higher quality product as well as reduced waste and energy usage. This project leads to better understanding of the thermal contact resistance and the thermal interactions between heated plastic webs and rollers. A new experimental method to measure the contact resistance between the two surfaces of one rigid and one pliable material is developed and used to measure the thermal contact resistance of a different plastic web to roller interfaces. Two blocks, initially at different temperatures, are brought together with the sample being studied between the blocks. The resulting time temperature profile can be used to determine the joint contact resistance. The physically static, thermally transient technique allows joint resistance measurements to be made quickly and easily using minimal equipment. The average joint resistances measured for the polyester, polypropylene and embossed polyethylene samples were 0. 0006, 0. 0007 and 0. 0028 m 2 -K/W respectively over a pressure range of 0. 25 to 6 kpa. A finite difference model of the web and roller system was used to model the heat transfer between rollers and webs. Given the required roller and web inlet conditions, the program could calculate the web outlet temperature and power <b>draw</b> from the <b>roller.</b> The roller model was developed with following intentions and results: 1. To simulate an internally heated roller as well as a roller having surface heat generation. Little difference was found in the surface temperature profiles of the differently heated rollers, but for the internally heated roller case, the hot fluid supply temperature needed was substantially higher than the actual roller surface temperature. 2. To develop a simple algebraic correlation that predicts the web heating effectiveness for thin webs accurately. This was achieved for plastic webs of less than 0. 30 mm thickness over a wide range of processing conditions. 3. To calculate the roller to web interface contact resistance based on measured web inlet, outlet and roller surface temperatures. A series of tests with a pilot scale facility was used to determine the effect of air entrainment on the contact resistance. The contact resistance measured in the static tests was then used to predict the web heating found in dynamic tests cases using the pilot scale facility. Infrared pyrometers were used extensively in the experiments and were the limiting factor in experimental accuracy. Good agreement was found for the opaque PVC sample within the experimental margin of error. For the highly translucent plastics, the static and dynamic tests did not show a good match, and the high error in the infrared temperature measurements was apparent...|$|R
2500|$|The batting captain {{is allowed}} seven minutes of rolling before his innings and Freddie Brown {{asked for the}} heavy roller to press down the wicket and {{take some of the}} demons out of it. In those days the Woolloongabba still used an old heavy <b>roller</b> <b>drawn</b> by a horse called Dobbin. As it had to be unhitched and led round after each pull of the roller over the pitch, most of the seven minutes was wasted and Brown didn't get much of the rolling he asked for. This was of great {{importance}} as if he had insisted on seven minutes actual rolling instead of messing about at either end the wicket would have been much less dangerous and England would have had less time to bat out before stumps. Though as Bill O'Reilly pointed out the time limits were devised when horse-drawn rollers were the norm and mechanical rollers were unheard of. Initially it made no difference as Reg Simpson was bowled first ball by a full toss from Ray Lindwall (2/21). The veteran England scorer Bill Ferguson was using his famous Ferguson Charts to record the details of each innings; how many runs a batsman had scored, how many balls, how many minutes, how many boundaries, etc. when Simpson was out one wag called out [...] "How long Bill, and how many fours?" [...] which produced a roar of laughter from the press box that astonished the crowd. Cyril Washbrook (6) and John Dewes (9) were determined to see out the day with dead bats and the wicket showed no signs of danger, but Sam Loxton took a superb catch {{to get rid of the}} Lancastrian off Lindwall. Jack Iverson was called up to bowl his first Test over 27 minutes before stumps and had Trevor Bailey in all kinds of trouble as his poked and prodded and could have been out five or six times in the mystery spinner's maiden over. Dewes was bowled by Keith Miller and with one over from Iverson remaining, Alec Bedser came out and immediately appealed against the bad light, but was turned down as he had yet to face a ball. He holed out to Neil Harvey off Iverson, Bailey gave a simple catch to Bill Johnston and Godfrey Evans ran out his fellow wicket-keeper Arthur McIntyre when he called for an unnecessary third run. Brown had fed in nightwatchman after nightwatchman in order to save Hutton, Compton and himself for the next day, but the Man from Pudsey still had to come out at 30/6 to survive the last two balls of an extraordinary day. When asked for his opinion that night Hutton said they might win [...] "if the others will stay till lunch and it doesn't rain again". It didn't rain again, but needing 163 to win with only four wickets in hand there was no room for mistakes. In the morning Brown, the umpires and a stopwatch ensured that England got their full 10 minutes rolling at the start of the day, which took nearly half an hour to complete. Evans (5) helped Hutton add 16 runs before he was caught by Loxton off Bill Johnston (2/30). Denis Compton came to the crease, but lasted one ball as he departed like Evans [...] "c Loxton, b Johnston". Brown came in at number 10 and held on grimly as Hutton peeled off 3 boundaries, though in the end the captain made 17 of their 29 runs together before he became Loxton's fourth victim when he was caught off Iverson (4/43). Doug Wright was the last man in at 77/9 and his batting tended to be a hit and miss affair which rarely reached double figures. Hutton (62 not out) farmed the bowling ruthlessly, making 43 of the 45 runs added for the last wicket. Wright managed to hold a straight bat up to the few balls he was left to face until the last four balls from Iverson before lunch. He kept out the first three, but spooned the last to Ray Lindwall at square leg and the match was over. The 12,000 strong crowd gave Hutton an heroic ovation and after lunch he replied to the congratulations showered on him with by admitting that [...] "with a bit of luck I'd have won the game".|$|R
