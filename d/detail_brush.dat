5000|$|Part of {{a series}} of [...] "white on white" [...] works begun by Malevich in 1916, the work depicts a white square, portrayed off centre and at an angle on a ground which is also a white square of a {{slightly}} warmer tone. The work measures 79.5 x 79.5 cm. Malevich dispenses with most of the characteristics of representational art, with no sense of colour, depth, or volume, leaving a simple monochrome geometrical shape, not precisely symmetrical, with imprecisely defined boundaries. Although the artwork is stripped of most <b>detail,</b> <b>brush</b> strokes are evident in this painting and the artist tried to make it look as if the tilted square is coming out of the canvas. Malevich intended the painting to evoke a feeling of floating, with the colour white symbolising infinity, and the slight tilt of the square suggests movement.|$|E
50|$|In View of Paris (F341) van Gogh {{demonstrates}} several Neo-impressionist techniques. To {{bring an}} intensity to his work, he uses complementary colors {{of red and}} green. He adapted the stippling technique, using tiny dots in areas where needed for <b>detail</b> and <b>brush</b> strokes for the background.|$|R
50|$|His works consist {{mostly of}} landscapes painted on location, of {{realistic}} historical naval scenes very precisely <b>detailed</b> and <b>brushed</b> by his ambidextrous hands, and of still-lives blended with eccentric imagery. His oeuvre {{is a reflection}} of his knowledge of the maritime world, his numerous travels, his interest in and taste for distinctly drawn landscapes, and a consequence of an overflowing imagination that made him a phenomenal story teller animated by nostalgia—at times even by a certain anguish.|$|R
2500|$|However, it was {{not until}} the final decline of the Academic {{hierarchy}} in Europe, and the rise of the Impressionist and Post-Impressionist painters, that technique and color harmony triumphed over subject matter, and that still life was once again avidly practiced by artists. In his early still life, Claude Monet shows the influence of Fantin-Latour, but is one of the first to break the tradition of the dark background, which Pierre-Auguste Renoir also discards in Still Life with Bouquet and Fan (1871), with its bright orange background. With Impressionist still life, allegorical and mythological content is completely absent, as is meticulously <b>detailed</b> <b>brush</b> work. Impressionists instead focused on experimentation in broad, dabbing brush strokes, tonal values, and color placement. [...] The Impressionists and Post-Impressionists were inspired by nature’s color schemes but reinterpreted nature with their own color harmonies, which sometimes proved startlingly unnaturalistic. As Gauguin stated, [...] "Colors have their own meanings." [...] Variations in perspective are also tried, such as using tight cropping and high angles, as with Fruit Displayed on a Stand by Gustave Caillebotte, a painting which was mocked at the time as a [...] "display of fruit in a bird’s-eye view." ...|$|R
5000|$|In the United States, John Singleton Copley, {{schooled in}} the refined British manner, became the leading painter of {{full-size}} and miniature portraits, with his hyper-realistic pictures of Samuel Adams and Paul Revere especially well-regarded. Copley is also notable {{for his efforts}} to merge portraiture with the academically more revered art of history painting, which he attempted with his group portraits of famous military men. Equally famous was Gilbert Stuart who painted over 1,000 portraits and was especially known for his presidential portraiture. Stuart painted over 100 replicas of George Washington alone. Stuart worked quickly and employed softer, less <b>detailed</b> <b>brush</b> strokes than Copley to {{capture the essence of}} his subjects. Sometimes he would make several versions for a client, allowing the sitter to pick their favorite. Noted for his rosy cheek tones, Stuart wrote, [...] "flesh is like no other substance under heaven. It has all the gaiety of the silk-mercer's shop without its gaudiness of gloss, and all the softness of old mahogany, without its sadness." [...] Other prominent American portraitists of the colonial era were John Smibert, Thomas Sully, Ralph Earl, John Trumbull, Benjamin West, Robert Feke, James Peale, Charles Willson Peale, and Rembrandt Peale.|$|R
50|$|Compared to {{his earlier}} paintings, Vermeer's brushwork in The Wine Glass is subdued, while the faces and clothes {{of the figures}} are {{depicted}} with wide smooth outlines. Only in the tapestry of the tablecloth and the window glass did the artist apply finely <b>detailed,</b> linear <b>brush</b> strokes. At the time Vermeer {{was not the only}} Dutch artist attempting to develop the ideas of De Hooch; contemporary paintings from Jan Steen, Gerard Ter Borch, and Frans van Mieris the Elder also display a refined technique.|$|R
6000|$|I {{have made}} the quoted remark myself, at one time and another, but I was not doing it to flatter the reader; I was merely doing it to save work. If I had known the <b>details</b> without <b>brushing</b> up, I would have put them in; but I didn't, and I {{did not want the}} labor of posting myself; so I said, [...] "The details of this {{tremendous}} episode are too familiar to the reader to need repeating here." [...] I do not like that kind of a lie; still, it does save work.|$|R
50|$|Kipniss's {{early work}} {{consisted}} of abstractions, biomorphic forms, landscapes, cityscapes, still lifes, and figures. The {{majority of these}} works were landscapes of subdued color, often with few <b>details,</b> and loosely <b>brushed.</b> Large Trees at Dusk (1962) {{was one of several}} paintings and drawings in 1961 and 1962 which introduced a boldness of form and a more pronounced moodiness.|$|R
40|$|Three {{students}} {{painting at}} their easels. The {{student in the}} foreground is bent over his canvas, working closely at a <b>detail</b> with his <b>brush.</b> Beside him is a stand covered with materials and cloths, along with a red sweater on a hanger, apparently set up as a still life.

50|$|Though {{advances}} in printing technology advanced {{over the course}} of the Edo period (1603-1868), allowing for the production of more and more elaborate and colorful prints, the medium of painting always allowed a greater degree of freedom to the artist, and involved a much larger product in any case; the paintings of many ukiyo-e artists survive today and are known for their bright colors, attention to <b>detail,</b> and bold <b>brush</b> strokes.|$|R
40|$|The aim of {{this work}} is to bring the {{cultural}} heritage of two-dimensional art closer to being accessible by {{blind and visually impaired}} people. We present a computer-assisted workflow for the creation of tactile representations of paintings, suitable {{to be used as a}} learning tool in the context of guided tours in museums or galleries. Starting from high-resolution images of original paintings, our process allows an artist to quickly design the desired form, and generate data suitable for rapid prototyping machines to produce the physical touch tools. Laser-cut layered depth diagrams, convey not only the individual objects in the painting and their spatial layout, but also augment their depth relations. CNC-milled textured reliefs additionally render fine <b>details</b> like <b>brush</b> strokes and texture suitable for the sense of touch. Our methods mimic aspects of the visual sense, make sure that the haptic output is quite faithful to the original paintings and do not require special manual abilities, like sculpting skills. ...|$|R
25|$|Slip is {{a liquid}} clay {{suspension}} of mineral pigments {{applied to the}} ceramics before firing. Slips are typically red, buff, white, and black; however, Nazca culture ceramic artists in Peru perfected 13 distinct colors of slips. They also used a hand-rotated turntable that allowed all sides of a ceramic piece to be painted with ease. These were first used in 500 BCE {{and continue to be}} used today. Slips can be applied overall in washes, creating large color fields, often with cloth, or they can be painted in fine <b>detail</b> with <b>brushes.</b> Yucca leaves, chewed slightly to loosen fibers, make excellent brushes that are still in use today in the American Southwest. Negative painting is a technique employed by precontact Mississippian potters in the Eastern Woodlands, Mayan potters in Mesoamerica, and others, which involves covering the ceramic piece in beeswax or another resist, incised a design in the resist, then soaking the piece with a slip. In the firing process the resists melts away, leaving the colored design.|$|R
50|$|Standing 1138 mm high, {{perhaps the}} most {{distinctive}} <b>details</b> were the <b>brushed</b> stainless steel roof and windscreen pillars. Inside, the bucket seats, dash, door trim, centre console and rear bulkhead were trimmed in leather, electric windows having been standard, most cars also getting air conditioners. The steering column was manually adjustable for rake and reach, whereas the LHM aux. circuit controls adjusted the driver's seat vertically, the pedal box of the brake, clutch and throttle pedals horizontally forwards and backwards by around three inches (76 mm)--a first such application {{in the world for}} a production car, and also to raise and lower the concealed headlights in the front fenders.|$|R
40|$|This Bachelor's thesis {{describes}} an issues of an revisions on electric engine equipped with brush. Electric engines with brushing {{are described in}} the first part. In the second one {{is focused on the}} introduction with necessary standards for performing of revisions of the electric equipment and on the clarification of terms used during the revisions of the electric equipment. The work continues with more <b>detailed</b> description of <b>brushing</b> contact in the electric engine and with the description of its parts. In the next part I have become more familiar with the electric engine that will be inspected. The final part of thesis contains sequence of measurements.

50|$|In {{keeping with}} the tenets of the Pre-Raphaelite Brotherhood, {{of which he was}} a member, Millais used bright colours, gave high {{attention}} to detail and faithful truth to nature. This rendition of Ophelia is the epitome of the PRB style; first, because of the subject matter, depicting a woman who has lived a life awaiting happiness, only to find her destiny on the verge of death: the vulnerable woman is a popular subject among Pre-Raphaelite artists. Also, Millais utilizes bright, intense colours in the landscape to make the pale Ophelia contrast with the nature behind her. All this is evident in the vivid attention to <b>detail</b> in the <b>brush</b> and trees around Ophelia, the contouring of her face, and the intricate work Millais did on her dress.|$|R
5000|$|Later, in 1983, Bannon, now Premier of South Australia, {{opened an}} {{exhibition}} of Scott’s ceramics at Bonython Art Gallery. [...] This exhibition was reviewed by Stephen Skillitzi in the Spring ’83 edition of S.A. Crafts. Skillitzi, the Lecturer in Charge of Ceramics at the South Australia School of Art at the time, praised ‘The intrinsic warmth and richness of clay, amber and black oxides, and white glaze are fused into composites that are bold in their simplicity and yet rich in their delicate <b>detail</b> of applied <b>brushed</b> and incised textural patterns and line and soft torn clay slab additions.’ [...] After surveying a number of individual artworks, Skillitzi concluded ‘These strongly conceived yet delicately executed and cogent statements in stoneware underline Joyce Scott’s gradual refinement and maturation into a ceramic artist with significant vision.’ ...|$|R
5000|$|Because Shawn isn't an {{official}} detective, he often has {{to resort to}} stealing, withholding evidence, obstruction of justice, tampering with evidence and witnesses, breaking and entering and numerous other crimes in order to solve a crime. Despite his high intelligence, Shawn does {{appear to have a}} poor grasp of history and other fields (assigned to write about a U.S. President, he wrote a paper on the fictional character from the movie [...] "Dave" [...] who he thought was real). He is also chided by Henry for not knowing all the details of a case beforehand (in one episode, Shawn is about to accuse an innocent man of murder before Henry stops him and reveals a detail Shawn would know from the case file he didn't read). Often, Shawn will accept a case without fully checking out the client or the <b>details</b> itself yet <b>brush</b> it off.|$|R
25|$|The new {{technique}} had the primary advantage of permitting {{a far better}} execution of internal detail. In black-figure vase painting such details had to be scratched into the painted surfaces, which was always less accurate than the direct application of <b>detail</b> with a <b>brush.</b> Red-figure depictions were generally more lively and realistic than the black-figure silhouettes. They were also more clearly contrasted against the black backgrounds. It was now possible to depict humans not only in profile, but also in frontal, rear, or three-quarter perspectives. The red-figure technique also permitted the indication of a third dimension on the figures. However, it also had disadvantages. For example, the distinction of sex by using black slip for male skin and white paint for female skin was now impossible. The ongoing trend to depict heroes and deities naked and of youthful age also made it harder to distinguish the sexes through garments or hairstyles. In the initial phases, there were also miscalculations regarding the thickness of human figures.|$|R
500|$|Author Peter <b>Brush</b> <b>details</b> that an [...] "additional 413 Marines {{were killed}} during Scotland II {{through the end}} of June 1968". He goes on to state that a further 72 were killed as part Operation Scotland II {{throughout}} the remainder of the year, but that these deaths are not included in the official US casualty lists for the Battle of Khe Sahn. Five and twenty US Air Force personnel who were killed are also not included. During February, 1969, TF Hotel started to complete its search and clear operations in Quang Tri Province. [...] On 25 February, the NVA launched a coordinated attack against FSB Neville killing 11 Marines and wounding 42 others. [...] Marines killed 36 NVA personnel in the engagement. [...] The NVA lost 51 killed when they attacked FSB Russell two hours later, causing the deaths of 19 more Marines. [...] III Marine Amphibious Force (III MAF) announced the termination of Operation Scotland II at midnight on 28 February 1969.|$|R

40|$|In the {{observed}} hunting district the most claimed damages {{have been caused}} by browsing and peeling over last five years. We have investigated 11 buck brushes in the 2 nd [...] 4 th age group where level of damage caused by browsing and peeling with red deer was methodically examined and then compared with forestry files. In one of the most damaged buck <b>brush</b> <b>detailed</b> survey of 5 examples of tree trunks was carried out. In these bush brushes we have found out that average damage the amount of 33. 45 %, in the forestry files the figure was 13 %. It {{is out of the question}} that our data are different from the data of the Czech Forestry Company; so we can suppose that the damages were overlooked or were collected after counting the damages. Average speed of widening the decay of Stereum sanguinoletum was 54. 8 cm per year - 1 and in horizontal bearing it was 1. 82 cm per year - 1. Age of hurt was about 10 years...|$|R
500|$|The canvas is {{dramatically}} divided in two by a diagonal line separated by colour and tone. The lower two-thirds {{are dominated by}} heavy red and white pigments; browns and whites are prominent in the upper right-hand section. This division is delineated by a diagonal reaching from the upper edge of the curtain down to Ottavio's leggings in the right mid-ground. Other echoes of the colours and patterns include the red of Paul's robes against the velvet of his chair and the overhanging curtain. This dramatic colour and luminosity can be in part attributed to this design, and to {{the manner in which}} Titian reverses the usual painterly technique in building tone: he began with a dark background, then layered the lighter hues before the darker passages. The effect {{has been described as a}} [...] "tour de force of symphonic colourism", and a high point of his blending of red and ochre pigments. Titian uses a variety of brushstrokes. While the pope's robes are painted with very broad strokes, his cape (mozzetta), ageing face and visible hand were captured in minute <b>detail</b> with thin <b>brushes,</b> with his hairs rendered at the level of individual strands.|$|R
40|$|In {{spite of}} the {{intensive}} research which {{has been carried out}} on the kidney, little is actually known about the ultrastructure of the brush border. This preliminary note refers to a structural <b>detail</b> of the <b>brush</b> border found in the proximal convolution of the nephrons in normal mouse kidney, as studied under the electron microscope. Normal mice were decapitated and immediately afterwards the kidney was exposed, stripped from its capsule, and a thin slice of its cortex was fixed for electron microscopy (Palade, 1952). The rest of the technique was routine. The material was examined at a Siemens electron microscope t~M 100 b model. Micrographs were taken at original enlargements of 1, 200, 7, 200, and 15, 000. The appearance of the brush border of all cells is basically the same as described by different authors (Sj 6 strand and Rhodin, 1953; P, hodin, 1954; Pease, 1955; Policard, 1957; and others), with the exception that in a few digitations (microvilli) of some brush borders, infoldings of the membrane (Fig. 1, A) and vesicles (Fig. 1, B) with an apparently dense content can be visualized. These vesicles, which measure about 200 A, are disposed along the middle of the units of the brush border (Figs. 1,C and 1,D). Fig. 3, at A, shows the same aspect in a somewhat less marked form.

40|$|The {{physical}} {{complexity of}} dense brush structures presents major challenges to analyzers. As they maintain their flexibility at elevated temperatures, which are typical in gas turbines, high density brush seals made of super-alloy bristles found popularity among engine designers. Typically brush-rotor contact occurs {{at very high}} surface speeds. If not managed properly, this may result in extreme wear conditions and damage to rotor. In order to ensure engine operational safety brush contact loads should be controlled through seal design and detail analysis. In addition to the physical complexity of these dense brush structures, frictional contacts among the bristles themselves, between the bristles and the support plates, and between the bristles tips and the high speed rotor further increase the analysis complexity, {{and make it a}} major undertaking if not impossible. <b>Detailed</b> understanding of <b>brush</b> seal contact loads is necessary to estimate seal and rotor wear performance. The complicated nature of bristle behavior under various combinations of pressure load and rotor interference requires computer analysis to study details that may not be available through analytical formulations. This work presents a 3 -D computational brush seal structural FE model {{that can be used to}} calculate bristle stress, tip force, and do wear analysis. The analysis includes a representative brush segment with bristles formed by 3 -D beam elements. Bristle interlocking and frictional interactions (interbristle, bristle-backing plate and bristle-rotor) are included to better simulate pressure-stiffness coupling. Various analysis results are presented and compared to full scale seal wear tests...|$|R
