40|$|The {{impressive}} performance improvements of laterally oxidized VCSELs come at {{the expense}} of increased fabrication complexity for 2 -dimensional arrays. Since the epitaxial layers to be wet-thermally oxidized must be exposed, non-planarity can be an issue. This is particularly important in that electrical contact to both the anode and cathode of the diode must be brought out to a package. They have investigated four fabrication sequences suitable for the fabrication of 2 -dimensional VCSEL arrays. These techniques include: mesa etched polymer planarized, mesa etched bridge contacted, mesa etched oxide isolated (where the <b>electrical</b> <b>trace</b> is isolated from the substrate during the oxidation) and oxide/implant isolation (oxidation through small via holes) all of which result in VCSELs with outstanding performance.

40|$|Electromechanical, adhesion, and {{viscoelastic}} {{properties of}} polymers and polymer nanocomposites (PNCs) {{are of interest}} for additive manufacturing (AM) and flexible electronics. Development/optimization of inks for AM is complex, expensive, and substrate/interface dependent. This study investigates properties of free standing films of a thermoplastic polyurethane (TPU) polymer and an Ag–carbon black (Ag-CB) TPU PNC in a lightly loaded low strain compression contact as a rough measure of their suitability for AM. The TPU exhibited high hysteresis and a large viscoelastic response, and sufficient dwell time was needed for polymer chain relaxation and measurable adhesion. A new discovery is that large enough contact area is needed to allow longer time constant polymer ordering in the contact that led to higher adhesion and better performance/reliability. This has previously unknown implications for interface size relative to polymer chain length in AM design. The standard linear model {{was found to be}} a good fit for the viscoelastic behavior of the TPU.

40|$|In {{multiple}} family dwellings {{of central}} Europe heat pumps {{are not only}} used for space heating but also increasingly for domestic hot water (dhw) supply. The water is often heated in a centralized or decentralized installation with a large distribution network. This leads to the combination of heat pumps with various trace heating systems to ensure both comfort and protection from legionella disease. The COP of the heat pump can be greatly affected by {{the choice of the}} heat tracing system which influences the overall efficiency (OE) of the domestic hot water supply system significantly. In this study several heat storage and heat tracing methods were coupled with heat pumps as the main heat source. The investigated installations feature either a recirculation loop or some kind of <b>electrical</b> <b>trace</b> heating. Focused on multiple family dwellings the energy consumption of the overall system including hot water supply system and water heating system is analyzed. A physics based model for four different systems was built and applied to several virtual building complexes sized from 8 to 192 apartments. After the validation of the model (using data from three different field measurements) each system was simulated for a week of domestic hot water consumption. In order to compare the systems the overall efficiency was evaluated using the amount of energy provided by hot water at the distributed tap devices in relation to the electrical power consumption of the complete installation. In general dhw supply systems using heat pumps can reach good performances especially when the dhw storage tank is kept unmixed. Installations featuring an externally reheated recirculation loop (using a dedicated heat pump) therefore show the best performances. Without this external reheating the overall efficiency is reduced by about 5 % in the best case. Installations using electric heating cables are showing a performance reduction of about 10 % compared to the optimized system. Installations using a central heat pump to increase the temperature of the overall heating system, which in turn is used to load decentral dhw-storage tanks, are consuming at least twice the amount of electrical energy compared to the other investigated systems...|$|E

40|$|BACKGROUND: For {{the human}} brain, {{habituation}} to irrelevant sensory input {{is an important}} function whose failure is associated with behavioral disturbances. Sensory gating can be studied by recording the brain's electrical responses to repeated clicks: the P 50 potential is normally reduced to the second of two paired clicks but not in schizophrenia patients. To identify its neural correlates, we recorded <b>electrical</b> <b>traces</b> of sensory gating directly from the human hippocampus and neocortex. METHODS: Intracranial evoked potentials were recorded using hippocampal depth electrodes and subdural strip and grid electrodes in 32 epilepsy patients undergoing invasive presurgical evaluation. RESULTS: We found evidence of sensory gating only in the hippocampus, the temporo-parietal region (Brodmann's areas 22 and 2), and the prefrontal cortex (Brodmann's areas 6 and 24); however, whereas neocortical habituating responses to paired clicks were peaking around 50 msec, responses within the hippocampus proper had a latency of about 250 msec. CONCLUSIONS: Consistent with data from animal studies, our findings show that the hippocampus proper contributes to sensory gating, albeit during a time window following neocortical habituation processes. Thus, sensory gating may be a multistep process, with an early phase subserved by the temporo-parietal and prefrontal cortex and a later phase mediated by the hippocampus...|$|R

Such electro-microfluidic devices require fluidic and electrical connection to larger packages.

Packaging is more challenging for surface micromachined devices than for larger bulk micromachined devices.

A new architecture for packaging surface micromachined electro-microfluidic devices is presented. This architecture relies on two scales of packaging to bring fluid to the device scale (picoliters) from the macroscale (microliters). The architecture emulates and utilizes electronics packaging technology. The larger package consists of a circuit board with embedded fluidic channels and standard fluidic connectors. The embedded channels connect to the smaller package, an Electro-Microfluidic Dual-Inline-Package (EMDIP) that takes fluid to the microfluidic integrated circuit (MIC).

However, {{regardless of the}} technology used, signals recorded by these electrodes degrade over time. The failure mechanisms of these electrodes are understood to be a complex combination of the biological reactive tissue response and material failure of the device over time. While mechanical mismatch between the brain tissue and implanted neural electrodes have been studied {{as a source of}} chronic inflammation and performance degradation, the electrode failure caused by mechanical mismatch between different material properties and different structural components within a device have remained poorly characterized.

40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{presents the}} design, fabrication, {{and testing of}} a microfluidic system {{to be used for}} whole-cell analysis. The study of cellular function and structure is essential for disease diagnosis and treatment. Microsystems developed to perform these bioanalyses add benefits such as requiring smaller samples and reagents, testing multiple samples in parallel, and supporting point-of-care testing, all of which increases throughput and reduces cost-per-analysis. Traditional methods for designing a microsystem use standard materials and techniques such as silicon, glass, photolithography, and wet and dry etching. This research is focused on utilizing materials and techniques that require less infrastructure, allow for a faster design-to-prototype cycle, and can integrate electrical and fluidic functionality to address a variety of possible applications. The microfluidic system presented in this thesis is comprised of multiple layers of Kapton, a polyimide available from DuPont. Kapton provides a biocompatible substrate that is flexible while maintaining structural stability and can be used in high temperature and other harsh environments. Microchannels with widths of 400 m and thru-hole fluidic vias less than 5 m in diameter are laser ablated through the flexible polyimide sheets using excimer and CO 2 lasers. <b>Electrical</b> <b>traces</b> and contact pads are defined on the substrate by vapor deposition through reusable microstencils rather than with photolithography. The patterned layers are bonded using heat staking and then packaged with the addition of wires and a fluidic interface. Validation of the system for whole-cell analysis was first performed with impedance spectroscopy measurements collected on air, DI water, phosphate buffered saline, clusters of human cancer cells, and human cancer tissue samples. This was followed by testing the ability to use the device to control the movement and position of 10 m diameter microbeads and dissociated cells.

40|$|Current {{microfabrication}} materials include silicon, a {{wide variety}} of metals, dielectrics, and some polymers. Because of the low cost and high processing flexibility that polymers generally have, expanding the use of polymers in microfabrication would benefit the microfabrication community, enabling new routes towards goals such as low-cost 3 D microfabrication. This work describes two main unconventional uses of polymers in microfabrication. The first unconventional use is as a carrier material in the self-assembly (SA) of millimeter-scale parts in which functional electronic components and electrical interconnects were cast into 5 mm cubes of Polymethylmethacrylate (PMMA). The second unconventional use is as a non-flat micromold for an alumina ceramic and as transfer material for multiple layers of micropatterned carbon nanotubes (CNTs). Both of these uses demonstrate 3 D low-cost microfabrication routes. In the SA chapter, surface forces induced both gross and fine alignment of the PMMA cubes. The cubes were bonded using low-melting temperature solder, resulting in a self-assembled 3 D circuit of LEDs and capacitors. The PMMA-encasulated parts were immersed in methyl methacrylate (MMA) to dissolve the PMMA, showing the possibility of using MEMS devices with moving parts such as mechanical actuators or resonators. This technique could be expanded for assembly of systems having more than 104 components. The ultimate goal is to combine a large number of diverse active components to allow the manufacture of systems having dense integrated functionality. The ceramic micromolding chapter explores micromolding fabrication of alumina ceramic microstructures on flat and curved surfaces, transfer of carbon nanotube (CNT) micropatterns into the ceramic, and oxidation inhibition of these CNTs through ceramic encapsulation. Microstructured master mold templates were fabricated from etched silicon, embossed thermally sacrificial polymer, and flexible polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS). The polymer templates were themselves made from silicon masters. Thus, once the master is produced, no further access to a microfabrication facility is required. Using the flexible PDMS molds, ceramic structures with mm-scale curvature were fabricated having microstructures on either the inside or outside of the curved macrostructure. It was possible to embed CNTs into the ceramic microstructures. To do this, micropatterned CNTs on silicon were transferred to ceramic via vacuum molding. Multilayered micropatterned CNT-ceramic devices were fabricated, and CNT <b>electrical</b> <b>traces</b> were encapsulated with ceramic to inhibit oxidation. During oxidation trials, encapsulated CNT traces showed an increase in resistance that was 62 % less than those that were not encapsulated. M. S.
