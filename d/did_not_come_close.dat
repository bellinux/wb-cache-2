5|$|Despite Vinokourov's hopes upon {{crashing}} out of {{the race}} that the squad would continue to be combative, they did not attain any noteworthy results over the remainder of the Tour. Grivko and Fofonov took top-ten stage placings from breakaways in stages 16 and 17, but <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>come</b> <b>close</b> to winning either day, finishing tenth and sixth respectively and over a minute off the winner's time both days. Vaitkus finished eighth on the Champs-Élysées stage to close out the Tour. The squad's best-placed rider in the final overall standings was Di Gregorio in 39th place, an hour and 22 minutes off Tour winner Cadel Evans' time.|$|E
5|$|In 1993, the Senators {{would sign}} Daigle to a $12.25 million contract, the largest rookie salary in League history, which {{would lead to}} a cap on rookie {{contracts}} a few years later. The club would promote Daigle over Alexei Yashin, nominating Daigle for rookie of the year over Yashin. His play did not justify full-time status and in 1995, coaches Rick Bowness and Alain Vigneault demoted Daigle to part-time status. The move led to Bowness and Vigneault being fired. In the end, Daigle <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>come</b> <b>close</b> to the career the Senators hoped for. After scoring only 74 goals in just over four seasons, he was traded to the Philadelphia Flyers, and is widely {{regarded as one of the}} biggest draft busts in sports history.|$|E

A four match unbeaten run in April, in which Young scored a winning goal against Bolton Wanderers, gave hope, but {{on the final day}} of the season Manchester City were relegated to the Second Division. For the following two seasons Young continued to be a regular first team player, though he missed the first two months of the 1964–65 season. Manchester City <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>come</b> <b>close</b> to promotion, and their 11th-place finish in 1965 was at that point the lowest in the club's history.

The impact of the Wallace campaign was substantial, winning the electoral votes of several states in the Deep South. He appeared {{on the ballot in}} all fifty states, but not the District of Columbia. Although he <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>come</b> <b>close</b> to winning any states outside the South, Wallace was the most popular 1968 presidential candidate among young men.

25|$|After his New York wins, he {{continued}} to regularly feature at major marathons, but <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>come</b> <b>close</b> to winning them. He was fifth in Boston and New York in 1999, then sixth at the Boston race and tenth in New York in 2000. He had a mixed 2001 season: after a lowly 32nd-place finish at the London Marathon {{he returned to the}} United States and won both the River Bank Run and Rock 'n' Roll San Diego Marathon. These proved to be his last major wins. He had seventh-place finishes at the 2001 New York Marathon and 2002 Chicago Marathon, as well as several top five finishes in half marathons in the same period. Top ten finishes in New York in 2003 and 2004 were his last high standard performances. His times declined from 2005 onwards and he failed to finish in New York, then scraped the top ten in the lower standard Los Angeles Marathon and Sapporo Marathon in 2006.|$|E

500|$|Tuck and Pitts, on {{the other}} hand, while {{impressed}} with Bushnell's hardware were not impressed with the game itself. They felt that Computer Space, a single-player game without the central gravity well of the original game, was a pale imitation of Spacewar, while their own Galaxy Game was a superior adaptation of the game. In November 1971, the Galaxy Game prototype debuted. The veneered walnut console, complete with seats for players, was located {{on the second floor}} of the building and connected to the PDP-11 in the attic by a 100-foot cable. It was very successful; Pitts later said that the machine attracted crowds of people [...] "ten-deep" [...] watching the players. They briefly attached a second monitor hanging above the console so that the watchers could more easily see the game. The low prices meant that they <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>come</b> <b>close</b> to making back the price of the PDP-11, but they were excited by the game's reception and had not intended the prototype to be profitable. As the initial Galaxy Game prototype was displayed to the public a few months after the first Computer Space prototype, it is believed to be the second video game to charge money to play.|$|E

500|$|The {{new owners}} of RKO made an initial effort {{to revive the}} studio, hiring veteran {{producer}} William Dozier to head production. A needed cash infusion was realized in 1954 when the 89 acre RKO Encino movie ranch was sold off {{to make way for}} a new tract home development. [...] During the first half of 1956, the production facilities were as busy as they had been in a half-decade. RKO Teleradio Pictures released Fritz Lang's final two American films, While the City Sleeps and Beyond a Reasonable Doubt (both 1956), but years of mismanagement had driven away many directors, producers, and stars. Other films included Bundle of Joy, a remake of the Ginger Rogers-starring Bachelor Mother which was re-tooled as a vehicle for star couple Eddie Fisher and Debbie Reynolds. Rogers herself would make a film for the new RKO (The First Traveling Saleslady) and would later comment that [...] "coming back to RKO was like coming back to a picnic you've been on last week, and pick up the bones all around and see what the ants have taken from the lunch that you left." [...] The studio was also saddled with the last of the inflated B movies such as Pearl of the South Pacific (1955) and The Conqueror (1956) that enchanted Hughes. The latter, starring John Wayne, was the biggest hit produced at the studio during the decade, but its $4.5 million in North American rentals <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>come</b> <b>close</b> to covering its $6 million cost.|$|E

This improvement is more important for the fermions compensating partially for their weaker interactions and slower equilibration. WU-B 97 / 30...|$|R
