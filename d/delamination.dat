5|$|Incapillo {{is part of}} a {{volcanic}} system active between 3.5 and 2mya that includes Ojos del Salado and Nevado Tres Cruces. It was the last volcanic centre formed in the region; subsequently, the shallowing of the subducting slab prevented volcanism east and south of it. Another volcanic trend considers Incapillo as part of a northeastsouthwest trend with Cerro Galan and Cerro Blanco. This trend may be related to <b>delamination</b> of the lower crust. Also, these centres are located between two domains of different rigidity, an Ordovician sedimentary domain of low rigidity and a higher rigidity basement.|$|E

Rocks beneath this unit include dacitic–trachyandesitic volcanites 9–7 mya old and an igneous-metamorphic granitic basement containing orthogneiss, quartz of Neoproterozoic-early Paleozoic age, containing paleozoic mafic to ultramafic volcanic inclusions. The Cordillera de San Buenaventura is formed from lava domes and volcanic complexes of intermediary composition of Upper Miocene–Quaternary age. During the Miocene-Pleistocene, the isotope and chemical composition of areal magmas has moved away from arc like magmas to distinctly water-poor and unoxidized petrologies. This finding is consistent with a hot mantle forming after <b>delamination</b> of the crust and migration of the arc.|$|E

Laminates {{with and without}} <b>delaminations</b> were studied. in laminates without <b>delaminations,</b> the free-edge interlaminar normal stress distribution in the outer ply groups was insensitive to total laminate thickness.

25|$|After {{fusion of}} the neural fold {{to create the}} neural tube, cells {{originally}} located in the neural plate border become neural crest cells. For migration to begin, neural crest cells must undergo a process called <b>delamination</b> that involves a full or partial epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT). <b>Delamination</b> {{is defined as the}} separation of tissue into different populations, in this case neural crest cells separating from the surrounding tissue. Conversely, EMT is a series of events coordinating a change from an epithelial to mesenchymal phenotype. For example, <b>delamination</b> in chick embryos is triggered by a BMP/Wnt cascade that induces the expression of EMT promoting transcription factors such as SNAI2 and FoxD3. Although all neural crest cells undergo EMT, the timing of <b>delamination</b> occurs at different stages in different organisms: in Xenopus laevis embryos there is a massive <b>delamination</b> that occurs when the neural plate is not entirely fused, whereas <b>delamination</b> in the chick embryo occurs during fusion of the neural fold.|$|E

25|$|Prior to <b>delamination,</b> {{presumptive}} {{neural crest}} cells are initially anchored to neighboring cells by tight junction proteins such as occludin and cell adhesion molecules such as NCAM and N-Cadherin. Dorsally expressed BMPs initiate <b>delamination</b> by inducing {{the expression of}} the zinc finger protein transcription factors snail, slug, and twist. These factors play a direct role in inducing the epithelial-mesenchymal transition by reducing expression of occludin and N-Cadherin in addition to promoting modification of NCAMs with polysialic acid residues to decrease adhesiveness. Neural crest cells also begin expressing proteases capable of degrading cadherins such as ADAM10 and secreting matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) that degrade the overlying basal lamina of the neural tube to allow neural crest cells to escape. Additionally, neural crest cells begin expressing integrins that associate with extracellular matrix proteins, including collagen, fibronectin, and laminin, during migration. Once the basal lamina becomes permeable the neural crest cells can begin migrating throughout the embryo.|$|E

40|$|ABSTRACT: Compression {{testing is}} {{conducted}} for specimens with well-documented initial damage states obtained from three-point bend testing. Strengths and failure modes are determined for specimens with four quasi-isotropic stacking sequences and two thick-nesses. Initial damage prior to compression testing {{is divided into}} three classifications based on the extent and location of the damage. These are (1) specimens with short <b>delaminations</b> distributed evenly through the specimen thickness, (2) specimens with few long <b>delaminations,</b> and (3) specimens with local fiber damage in the surface plies under the three-point bend contact point. Specimens without initial damage are also tested {{in order to determine the}} effects of the initial damage on the final compression strength and failure modes. It was found that specimens with short multiple <b>delaminations</b> experienced the greatest reduction in compression strength compared to the undamaged specimens. All of the sub-laminates formed by the <b>delaminations</b> failed at the same time with no indication of sub-laminate buckling. Individual sublaminate buckling was observed for longer, isolated <b>delaminations</b> near the surface of the laminate. Single <b>delaminations</b> far from the speci-men surface had little effect on the final compression strength, with moderate strength re-duction observed for specimens with localized surface ply damage...|$|R

25|$|Attempts at {{repair of}} ischaemic-damaged bone will usual occur in 2 phases. First, when dead bone abuts live marrow, {{capillaries}} and undifferentiated mesenchymal cells grow into the dead marrow spaces, while macrophages degrade dead cellular and fat debris. Second, mesenchymal cells differentiate into osteoblasts or fibroblasts. Under favorable conditions, layers of new bone {{form on the}} surface of dead spongy trabeculae. If sufficiently thickened, these layers may decrease the radiodensity of the bone; therefore, the first radiographic evidence of previous osteonecrosis may be patchy sclerosis resulting from repair. Under unfavorable conditions repeated attempts at repair in ischaemic conditions can be seen histologically and are characterized by extensive <b>delamination</b> or microcracking along cement lines as well as the formation of excessive cement lines. Ultimate failure of repair mechanisms due to persistent and repeated ischaemic events is manifested as trabecular fractures that occur in the dead bone under functional load.

25|$|As the war went on, the T-34 {{gradually}} {{lost some}} of its initial advantage. The Germans responded to the T-34 by fielding large numbers of improved anti-tank weapons such as the towed 75mm gun, while hits from 88mm-armed Tigers, anti-aircraft guns and PaK 43 88mm anti-tank guns usually proved lethal. A Wa Pruef 1 report estimated that, with the target angled 30° sideward, a Panther tank could penetrate the turret of a T-34-85 from the front at ranges up to 2000m, the mantlet at 1200m, and the frontal hull armour at 300m. According to the Pantherfibel, the T-34's glacis could be penetrated from 800m and the mantlet from 1500 m at 30° sideward angle.

A three-dimensional (3 D) finite element (FE) model, which is experimentally verified using data measured by 3 D scanning laser vibrometer, is used in the investigation. The study consists of two parts. The first part investigates the excitability of the fundamental anti-symmetric mode (A ₒ) of guided wave in laminated composite beams. It is found that there are some unique phenomena, which do not exist for guided waves in plate structures, make the analysis become more complicated. The phenomena are observed in numerical study using 3 D FE simulations.

The depression {{dates back to the}} Ordovician and slopes northward from [...] altitude on the southern side to [...] altitude on the northern side. A low gravity field anomaly is also found in the area. The basement consists of fractured rocks of Precambrian-Ordovician age, known as the Puncoviscana Formation and Faja Eruptiva, respectively, overlain with an impermeable Cretaceous unit named the Pirgua Formation. Volcanism in the area has existed since the Miocene, involving lava domes, ignimbrite eruptions (the 0.6mya Tuzgle ignimbrite) and monogenetic volcanism. Volcanoes located south of Tuzgle are Aguas Calientes, Negro de Chorrillos and San Jeronimo. This region belongs to the back-arc region of the Andes, and the formation of melts is dependent on the melting of a heated mantle, whereas melt generation under the arc proper is dependent on the interaction between fluids and mantle rocks, leading to a reduction in their melting point.
