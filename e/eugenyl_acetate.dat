40|$|Abstract The {{production}} of compounds via enzymatic esterification has great {{scientific and technological}} interest due to the several inconveniences related to acid catalysis, mainly by these systems do not fit {{to the concept of}} &# 8220;green chemistry&# 8221;. Besides, natural products as clove oil present compounds with excellent biological potential. Bioactives compounds are often toxic at high doses. The evaluation of lethality in a less complex animal organism can be used to a monitoring simple and rapid, helping the identification of compounds with potential insecticide activity against larvae of insect vector of diseases. In this sense, the toxicity against Artemia salina of clove essential oil and its derivative <b>eugenyl</b> <b>acetate</b> obtained by enzymatic esterification using Novozym 435 as biocatalyst was evaluated. The conversion of <b>eugenyl</b> <b>acetate</b> synthesis was 95. 6 %. The results about the evaluation of toxicity against the microcrustacean Artemia salina demonstrated that both oil (LC 50 = 0. 5993 µg. mL&# 8211; 1) and ester (LC 50 = 0. 1178 µg. mL&# 8211; 1) presented high toxic potential, being the <b>eugenyl</b> <b>acetate</b> almost 5 times more toxic than clove essential oil.

40|$|The {{changes in}} the {{essential}} oil yield and composition from Syzygium aromaticum leaf harvested at different phases of development from young leaves to mature leaves were studied. Separation of the essential oils was conducted by steam distillation in a Clevenger apparatus for about 4 h. Essential oils analyses were performed by GC/MS. The yield of essential oil (ml per 100 g of DM) of the leaf following the four phases of development was in order of: young leaves (5. 1 %) > expanded leaves 1 (4. 5 %) > expanded leaves 2 (4. 1 %) > mature leaves (3. 8 %). Sixteen compounds were detected by GC/MS. Eugenol and <b>eugenyl</b> <b>acetate</b> were the dominant components. Eugenol and <b>eugenyl</b> <b>acetate</b> amount had a divergent evolution during the four expansions of leaves. When eugenol reached its highest percentages at expanded leaves 2 (84. 00 - 90. 48 %) and mature leaves stage (88. 32 - 90. 22 %), <b>eugenyl</b> <b>acetate</b> reached the lowest ones with, respectively, 0. 96 - 7. 16 % and 0. 36 - 1. 64 %, but when the <b>eugenyl</b> <b>acetate</b> reached a maximum percentage at young leaves stage with 61. 44 - 65. 52 %, eugenol reached a minimum of 25. 43 - 30. 38 %. It is judicious to collect and extract S. aromaticum leaf in expended leaves 2 (pale green leaves) and mature leaves stage (dark green leaves) {{in order to obtain}} the optimal yield and maximum percentage of eugenol.

40|$|We {{investigated}} the conformational structure of eugenol and <b>eugenyl</b> <b>acetate</b> under torsional angle effect by performing semiempirical calculations using AM 1 and PM 3 methods. From these calculations, we have evaluated the strain energy of conformational interconversion.

So, we have determined five geometries of eugenol (three energy minima and two transition states) and three geometries of <b>eugenyl</b> <b>acetate</b> (two energy minima and one transition state). From the molecular orbital calculations, we deduce that the optimized trans form by AM 1 method is more reactive than under PM 3 method. We can conclude that both methods are efficient.

40|$|Semi-synthesis of {{vanillin}} from eugenol can {{be divided}} into two step reactions namely, isomerization of eugenol intoisoeugenol, and cleavage oxidation of isomerization product into expected reaction product (vanillin). In this work isomerization of eugenol or <b>eugenyl</b> <b>acetate</b> into isoeugenol or isoeugenyl acetate has been done via the following reactions: (1) Sigmatropic hydrogen (1, 3) thermalic rearrangement reaction: direct heating of eugenol or <b>eugenyl</b> <b>acetate</b> at 220 oC for 8 hours can produce 52. 2 % of isoeugenol or 65. 7 % of isoeugenyl acetate (both chemical yields are measured by means nmr-spectrometer), where products are viscose yellow-brownish liquid as mixture of unseparated starting material and isomerization product. (2) Prototropic (1, 3) rearrangement catalyzed by phase transfer catalyst (PTC) : (18) -crown ether- 6 at room temperature can be afforded 71. 4 % of isoeugenol as light yellow liquid (mixture of unseparated starting material and isomerization product). Without any separation of mixture between isomerization product and starting material followed by subsequent cleavage oxidation using KMnO 4 as oxidator in neutral condition catalyzed by phase transfer catalyst: (18) -crown ether- 6 at room temperature for 3 hours can be yielded 16. 5 - 22. 9 % of vanillin (from the starting material; eugenol or <b>eugenyl</b> <b>acetate).</b> The spectroscopical data of synthetical vanillin is not rather different with the spectroscopical data of authentical natural vanillin...|$|E

40|$|A green {{scalable}} flow-synthesis {{process for}} the production of <b>eugenyl</b> <b>acetate,</b> an eugenol derivative with potential applications in food and medicinal chemistry, was developed. Through batch experiments, the anion-exchange resin Amberlyst A- 21 was recognized as a suitable catalyst for the esterification of eugenol with acetic anhydride. Next, the process was switched from batch- to flow-mode by using a packed-bed microreactor integrated in an instrumental platform that permitted at the same time continuous control of the main process parameters (flow rate, feed mixture composition, temperature) and the on-line HPLC analysis of the reactor effluent. Thanks to this apparatus, a number of experiments with different reaction conditions have been easily performed to evaluate the effects of temperature and reagent molar ratios on <b>eugenyl</b> <b>acetate</b> production. The results have been used to carry out a central composite rotatable experimental design (CCRD) whose derived response surface model (RSM) suggested an optimal temperature and acetic anhydride to eugenol molar ratio of 95 °C and 3 : 1, respectively.

40|$|Essential oils {{are good}} {{candidates}} for the substitution of conventional medicinal treatments. Many articles and patents for their use {{have been published in}} recent years. The most attractive aspects of using essential oils as medicaments are their natural source and rapid permeability.

The Eugenol molecular modification may diminish the problems of water solubility and bioavailability.

Ceylon citronella oil (Cymbopogon nardus) used as a standard showed LC 50 s of 26. 5 and 24. 2 mg/dm 3 for the same exposure periods. Bioassay-guided fractionation of P. betle leaf oil revealed safrole and eugenol as the active principles against M. domestica, safrole showing LC 50 values of 4. 8 and 4. 7 mg/dm 3, and eugenol 7. 3 and 6. 2 mg/dm 3 for the 24 and 48 h exposure periods, respectively, while citronellal (synthetic standard) showed equal LC 50 values of 14. 3 mg/dm 3 for the same exposure periods. Using safrole as the starting compound, eight analogues were prepared to study structure–activity relationships.
