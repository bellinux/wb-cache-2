Findings of a survey of landholders participating or expressing interest in the Queensland Plantation <b>Joint</b> <b>Venture</b> Scheme are presented. <b>Joint</b> <b>venture</b> arrangements are found to overcome investment constraints, {{particularly with respect to}} capital, technical knowledge and resource security. Complementarities between resource supplies of <b>joint</b> <b>venture</b> partners lead to increased output relative to wholly owned investments. Participants expressed a high degree of satisfaction with this program, although making some suggestions for changes in arrangements.
