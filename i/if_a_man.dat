5|$|For these {{long-range}} desert operations, it {{was necessary}} for all supplies to be well-organised and suitably packaged for transportation on camels, moving with the column or following closely behind. It was vital that the soldiers were well trained for these conditions. <b>If</b> <b>a</b> <b>man</b> was left behind in the inhospitable Sinai, he might die in the burning desert sun during the day, or bitter cold at night. If a water bottle was accidentally tipped up or leaked, it could mean no water for its owner, for perhaps 24 hours in extreme temperatures.|$|E
5|$|The child's sex can be {{influenced}} by factors that affect temperature, including the weather, the wind direction, diet, and the father's age. Features other than sex also depend on whether the semen overpowers the menses, so <b>if</b> <b>a</b> <b>man</b> has strong semen, he will have sons who resemble him, while if the semen is weak, he will have daughters who resemble their mother.|$|E
5|$|The state {{constitution}} had come under considerable criticism {{beginning in the}} 1840s because it allowed most government positions to be filled by appointment. The problem with this method of filling positions did not manifest itself until {{the advent of the}} state's political parties. Once in power, a party could stack the government with its own members, making it difficult for the minority to regain power. Another problem was that the authority for many trivial issues were not delegated to other authorities. For example, <b>if</b> <b>a</b> <b>man</b> was to divorce his wife, the divorce bill had to be approved by the General Assembly before he or she could legally remarry.|$|E

The Whetstone of Tudwal Tudglyd (Hogalen Tudwal Tudclyd): <b>if</b> <b>a</b> brave <b>man</b> {{sharpened}} {{his sword}} on the whetstone, then the sword would certainly kill any man from whom it drew blood. <b>If</b> <b>a</b> cowardly <b>man</b> used the whetstone, though, his sword {{would refuse to}} draw blood at all.|$|R

'Thou who art in my house, name thyself! <b>If</b> {{thou art}} <b>an</b> old <b>man,</b> thou shalt be my father; <b>if</b> <b>a</b> middle-aged <b>man,</b> my brother; but <b>if</b> <b>a</b> young <b>man,</b> thou shalt be my husband dear.

6000|$|Q. But {{is it not}} {{the best}} way, if one can, to mend first?--A. This is just as <b>if</b> <b>a</b> sick <b>man</b> should say, Is it not best {{for me to be}} well before I go to the physician; or as <b>if</b> <b>a</b> wounded <b>man</b> should say, When I am cured I will lay on the plaster.[14] ...|$|R
25|$|The {{eleventh}} law is that <b>if</b> <b>a</b> <b>man</b> {{be trusted}} to judge between man and man, that he deal equally between them.|$|E
25|$|The {{husband is}} {{required}} to treat all wives equally. <b>If</b> <b>a</b> <b>man</b> fears {{that he will not}} be able to meet these conditions then he is not allowed more than one wife.|$|E
25|$|<b>If</b> <b>a</b> <b>man</b> {{does not}} fulfill his {{obligations}} {{according to the}} marriage contract, or causes his wife harm such as abandonment or violence, she {{has the right to}} file for divorce; the new law also provides for divorce in situations of mutual consent.|$|E

25|$|The law, such as, for {{a period}} of time, the right not to be {{impressed}} into the Royal Navy, <b>if</b> <b>a</b> <b>man</b> served in the local Island militias and as every man had to be in the militia, local sailors might avoid the forced service that afflicted so many English ports.|$|E
25|$|Desire {{satisfaction}} {{may occur}} without the agent's {{awareness of the}} satisfaction of the desire. For example, <b>if</b> <b>a</b> <b>man</b> wishes for his legal will to be enacted after his death, and it is, then his desire has been satisfied even though he will never experience or know of it.|$|E
25|$|As {{followers}} of Torah exclusively, the Karaite Jews {{say that a}} woman can claim a divorce. <b>If</b> <b>a</b> <b>man</b> refuses to give divorce to his wife, the beit din (Jewish legal court) may exercise its legal power to grant a divorce instead. Consequently, there are no agunot in Karaite Judaism.|$|E
5000|$|The {{statement}} U may {{be interpreted}} as [...] "One of two things, either whatever x may be, <b>if</b> x is <b>a</b> <b>man,</b> then x is white or whatever x may be, <b>if</b> x is <b>a</b> <b>man,</b> then x is non-white." ...|$|R

25|$|Netherlands: Marriage between {{more than}} two {{individuals}} prohibited; however, a samenlevingscontract may include {{more than two}} partners. It legally accepts immigrants who are in such a union from a country where it is legal; e.g. <b>if</b> <b>a</b> <b>man</b> with two wives immigrates to The Netherlands, all three will be legally recognized.|$|E
25|$|Consent may be {{complicated}} by law, language, context, culture and sexual orientation. Verbalized 'no' to sex {{may be interpreted}} as 'keep trying', or even 'yes' by offenders. Some may believe that when injuries are not visible, the woman must have consented. <b>If</b> <b>a</b> <b>man</b> solicits sex from another man, the pursuer may be regarded as virile.|$|E
25|$|Other legends tell of ivory-filled {{graves of}} {{elephants}} on the mountain, {{and of a}} cow named Rayli that produces miraculous fat from her tail glands. <b>If</b> <b>a</b> <b>man</b> tries to steal such a gland but is too slow in his moves, Rayli will blast a powerful snort and blow the thief hurling down into the plain.|$|E

25|$|By 1940 Hardrick's health {{prevented}} him from working in the family business and he began driving a taxi. He would often sell paintings {{out of the trunk}} and, while driving around, see a subject he would want to paint. <b>If</b> <b>a</b> <b>man</b> or woman agreed, he would drive them to his studio and complete the portrait in a few hours.|$|E
25|$|According to {{prominent}} Jewish {{writers of}} the Middle Ages, <b>if</b> <b>a</b> <b>man</b> is absent from his wife for a long period, the wife {{should be allowed to}} sell her husband's property, if necessary to sustain herself. Similarly, they argued that if a wife had to take out a loan to pay for her sustenance during such absence, her husband had to pay the debt on his return.|$|E
25|$|On formal {{occasions}} a taovala, a woven mat, is worn {{over the}} tupenu. It is {{wrapped around the}} waist and secured with a kafa rope. The tupenu may be smartly tailored and have a matching suit jacket. <b>If</b> <b>a</b> <b>man</b> cannot afford to have a suit tailored to fit him, he will buy a used Western jacket, or wear a threadbare jacket inherited from an older relative.|$|E

25|$|Rabbinic courts could {{compel the}} husband {{to make this}} provision, if he fails to do so voluntarily. Moses Schreiber, a {{prominent}} 19th century halachic decisor, argued that <b>if</b> <b>a</b> <b>man</b> could not provide his wife with this minimum, he should be compelled to divorce her; other Jewish rabbis argued that a man should be compelled to hire himself out, as a day-labourer, if he cannot otherwise make this provision to his wife.|$|E
25|$|The Lemba, a Bantu-speaking {{group of}} people from {{southern}} Africa, primarily Zimbabwe and South Africa, consider themselves of Jewish descent, although most practice Christianity or Islam. They emphasize eating only meats slaughtered by special ritual. They have endogamous marriage practices. <b>If</b> <b>a</b> <b>man</b> wants to marry a non-Lemba woman, she must adopt all the Lemba practices and traditions, including keeping meat and dairy foods separate. No male non-Lemba are accepted into the group, even by conversion.|$|E
25|$|Finally, <b>if</b> <b>a</b> <b>man</b> {{died with}} no children, the {{property}} was distributed between his nearest kinâ€”first the descendants of his father, {{and if there were}} no such descendants, then between the descendants of his grandfather, and so on. Any extra land that daughters could not inherit because of female inheritance limits also went to the wider kin. The head of a kin group was entitled to extra property since he was liable for debts a kinsman could not pay.|$|E
