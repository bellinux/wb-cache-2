The extract was orally administered at a dose of 2, 6. 6, or 20 mg/kg; a significant edema-inhibitory activity in the acute and chronic phases was observed with a dose of 2 and 20 mg/kg, respectively. The extract showed higher anti-inflammatory and anti-arthritic effects than the reference drug phenylbutazone (80 mg/kg). Moreover, the extract prevented the occurrence of secondary lesions associated to this pharmacological model...|$|R

It has translucent,linked ameroconidia and very small conidiophores— its unusually small, few conidiophores are the reason why the colonies are white rather than <b>gray.</b> <b>S.</b> keratitidis species have spherical, phialidic conidia. Sagenomella species are closely related to Acremonium, but distinguished by their linked conidia. Sagenomella species are also distinguished from Acremonium species by their sharp-tipped, abruptly-ending conidia. S. keratitidis lacks chlamydospores.S. keratitidis may superficially resemble another member of its genus,S.humicola, under a microscope, but can be distinguished from S.humicola because of its extremely slow growth and lack of chlamydospores.|$|R

40|$|When {{tracking}} {{more than}} one object a key problem is that of associating measurements with particular tracks. Recently, powerful statistical approaches such as Probabilistic Multi-Hypothesis Tracking (PMHT) and Probabilistic Least Squares Tracking have been proposed {{to solve the problem}} of measurement to track association. However, in practice other information may often be available, typically classification measurements from automatic target recognition algorithms, which help associate certain measurements with particular tracks. An extension to the Bayesian PMHT approach which allows noisy classification measurements to be incorporated in the tracking and association process is presented. Example results are given to illustrate the performance improvement that can result from this approach. D A <b>Gray,</b> <b>S</b> J Davey, and R L Streit[URL]...|$|R

In this issue, two groups provide direct evidence that the chemokine receptor CCR 7 is required for normal thymocyte migration (Ueno, T., F. Saito, D. <b>Gray,</b> <b>S.</b> Kuse, K. Hieshima, H.

Med. 200 : 481 – 491). The two papers focus on distinct and opposite migration events, an early outward migration and a later inward migration. Together these papers provide a fascinating picture of the complex role of CCR 7 in orchestrating thymocyte migration...|$|R
