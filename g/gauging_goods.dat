50|$|Under {{agreements}} of 1860 {{incorporated into}} Acts of Parliament, the GWR continued to run broad <b>gauge</b> <b>goods</b> trains to Crediton until {{the abolition of}} broad gauge on 20 May 1892; narrow <b>gauge</b> GWR <b>goods</b> trains continued operating until 1 October 1903.|$|R
50|$|Not all wagons {{are given}} UIC designations. In Germany the few {{remaining}} guards vans and narrow <b>gauge</b> <b>goods</b> wagons have retained their original classifications.|$|R
5|$|A narrow <b>gauge</b> <b>goods</b> railway was {{constructed}} for the transportation of bricks {{to some of}} the major building sites in central Canberra. This linked the brickworks to places such as Parliament House, and the Kingston Power House.|$|R
25|$|In {{preparation}} for the 2010 World Cup Soccer event the Humerail Station was extensively upgraded. Several disused narrow <b>gauge</b> <b>goods</b> wagons were scrapped and removed from the site, several buildings in the area have also been renovated and revamped.|$|R
50|$|Narrow <b>gauge</b> <b>goods</b> railway {{lines for}} the {{transportation}} of bricks linked Yarralumla {{to some of}} the major building sites in central Canberra such as Old Parliament House, and the Kingston Power House. No sign of this early Canberra transport system remains today.|$|R
50|$|A {{third rail}} was laid along the Basingstoke branch on 22 December 1856. This mixed gauge was to allow {{standard}} <b>gauge</b> <b>goods</b> trains {{to run through}} from the Midlands to ports on the South coast. Broad gauge trains stopped running on this route from 1 April 1869.|$|R
50|$|Today, on both systems, {{passenger}} traffic {{is carried out}} by electric units, single driving cars, coupled at busy times to trailers. Standard <b>gauge</b> <b>goods</b> traffic can transfer to the metre gauge where the wagons are transported on carrier trucks. The company still has few metre gauge wagons, all now connected with railway engineering.|$|R
50|$|They then {{proceeded}} {{with the work}} of laying broad gauge rails (i.e. converting the main line to mixed gauge) and to improving the very poor quality infrastructure on the West Cornwall main lines. Broad <b>gauge</b> <b>goods</b> trains started running on 6 November 1866 and passenger trains from 1 March 1867, with two through London services each way daily.|$|R
40|$|The {{development}} of a novel magnetoelastic sensor, based on the stress influence on amplitude of the resonant mechanical waves inside a Fe 62. 5 Co 6 Ni 7. 5 Zr 6 Cu 1 Nb 2 B 15 ribbon, for strain and/or stress real-time monitoring in civil buildings is reported. This novel sensor exhibits better sensitivity than resistive and vibrating wire strain <b>gauges,</b> <b>good</b> reliability and stability...|$|R
5000|$|The South Devon Railway was amalgamated {{into the}} Great Western Railway (GWR) on 1 February 1876. The lines were {{converted}} to [...] standard gauge on 21 May 1892, although standard <b>gauge</b> <b>goods</b> trains were working to the docks from 1878 over mixed gauge tracks. [...] The station was extensively rebuilt in 1900-03 when the old wooden buildings were replaced by a new stone terminus.|$|R
50|$|The LSWR {{was able}} to remove the {{obligation}} to maintain broad gauge tracks beyond Crediton; this had been used by a single daily broad <b>gauge</b> <b>goods</b> train for several years. The last broad gauge train beyond Crediton ran on 30 April 1877. Following this, the line from Yeoford to Coleford Junction (the point of divergence of the Lidford line) was doubled in standard gauge only on 16 May 1877.|$|R
50|$|The {{line was}} closed {{throughout}} most of September 2008 for upgrade work carried out by Network Rail. Capacity was increased from six trains per hour to eight (four each for passenger and goods trains). By replacing the overbridges carrying Sussex Way and Albert Road, and lowering the track in some other locations, it was made possible for W10 loading <b>gauge</b> <b>goods</b> trains to operate. Electrification was not included.|$|R
50|$|Wx18 {{is stored}} at the Pichi Richi Railway, Quorn. This {{locomotive}} entered service in July 1879 and was upgraded to Wx class in 1911. On 12 March 1959, Wx18 hauled the last narrow <b>gauge</b> <b>goods</b> train on the Kingston - Naracoorte line {{where it had}} spent its operational life. It was preserved in Pioneer Park in Naracoorte until being moved to Pichi Richi in July 1985. It is currently in a disassembled condition awaiting restoration.|$|R
50|$|The most {{important}} goods transported to Zermatt are foodstuffs, building materials and heating oil. Some other consumer goods are similarly transported by rail, and also tourist baggage. Transhipment facilities are provided at Visp station, where containers from trucks and standard <b>gauge</b> <b>goods</b> wagons are loaded onto narrow gauge wagons. To {{the east of}} Visp, there are facilities for filling tank wagons. At Zermatt, the station has been equipped since 1983 with partially underground facilities for transshipment of oil products.|$|R
500|$|On 29 May 1854 the Midland Railway laid a {{third rail}} along their line to Gloucester to provide mixed gauge {{so that it}} could operate [...] {{standard}} gauge passenger trains while broad <b>gauge</b> <b>goods</b> trains could still run to collieries north of Bristol. Sidings at South Wales Junction allowed traffic to be transhipped between wagons on the two different gauges. The GWR continued to operate its trains on the broad gauge, but on 3 September 1873 it opened the standard gauge Bristol and North Somerset Railway. This had a junction nearly [...] from the station on the London line and so mixed gauge was extended to that point. During the following year mixed gauge track was continued beyond Bath in connection with the conversion of the Wilts, Somerset and Weymouth Railway to standard gauge. Mixed gauge was laid through Box Tunnel on 16 May 1875 and so standard gauge trains could run to London, although broad gauge was retained west of Temple Meads and through trains from London to Penzance and other stations in Devon and Cornwall continued to be broad <b>gauge.</b> <b>Goods</b> traffic was transhipped between the two gauges in the B yard at Pylle Hill.|$|R

5000|$|With the {{construction}} of Australia's capital city underway, the Yarralumla brickworks were established in 1913 to supply building material. The bricks were used for many of Canberra's buildings, including the provisional Parliament House. In 1917, Walter Burley Griffin named the area surrounding the brickworks [...] "Westridge".A narrow <b>gauge</b> <b>goods</b> railway was constructed for the transportation of bricks {{to some of the}} major building sites in central Canberra. This linked the brickworks to places such as Parliament House, and the Kingston Power House.|$|R
50|$|The Indian Railways WG {{class was}} {{a type of}} broad <b>gauge</b> 2-8-2 <b>goods</b> {{locomotive}} introduced in the 1950s. Over 2000 of the class were built between 1950 and 1970.|$|R
50|$|Due to {{the simple}} construction, many {{mechanics}} build their own testers. Homemade instruments can function as well as commercial testers, providing they employ proper orifice sizes, <b>good</b> pressure <b>gauges,</b> and <b>good</b> regulators.|$|R
50|$|A quarry once lay {{nearby and}} a narrow gauge railway {{crossed the line}} {{bringing}} stone into the Killochan goods yard for loading into standard <b>gauge</b> <b>goods</b> trucks.In 1965 the signal box was still present as was the second platform and the old toilet block. A 1970 photograph shows the station substantially intact despite closure in 1951 although only a single platform remains. By 2011 the station buildings had been much altered with the signal box gone, toilet block demolished, waiting room converted into a garage and the substantial chimneys removed from the two storey station house.|$|R
50|$|Some {{narrow gauge}} trains {{continued}} to run, and from November 1871 until {{the abolition of}} broad <b>gauge,</b> some <b>goods</b> trains ran as mixed trains, conveying wagons of both gauges in the same train.|$|R
50|$|The LSWR {{dominated}} the E&CR board and shareholding, so independence was illusory, {{and the line}} was operated {{as a part of}} the LSWR (although a daily broad <b>gauge</b> <b>goods</b> train continued to run). The Bristol and Exeter Railway amalgamated with the Great Western Railway and other companies from 1 February 1876, the combined company using the title Great Western Railway (GWR). Negotiations took place for the LSWR to buy out the GWR shareholding in the E&CR. Not without difficulty, this was agreed and the purchase was valued at £217,687; as a majority shareholder itself, the LSWR paid out only £81,256. The transfer was effective on 26 June 1879.|$|R
5000|$|On 23 May 1892 {{the line}} south of Nanpean was {{converted}} to the [...] standard <b>gauge</b> used. <b>Goods</b> trains could now run through from St Dennis to Burngullow (although the line has never carried scheduled passenger trains).|$|R
50|$|Apart {{from the}} short LSWR running {{sections}} at Exeter and Yeovil, the B&ER had been exclusively broad gauge. Now in 1866 the Somerset and Dorset Railway (S&DR) proposed building a Bridgwater branch from their line. To head this encroachment off, the B&ER undertook to lay narrow gauge rails {{on their own}} line from Highbridge, where the S&DR joined it, to Bridgwater quay, {{and from there to}} Yeovil via Durston (where trains reversed). Narrow <b>gauge</b> passenger and <b>goods</b> rolling stock was acquired, and with the track works the scheme cost £125,000. A daily B&ER narrow <b>gauge</b> <b>goods</b> train ran from November 1867, and after resolution of authorisation difficulties with the LSWR, some narrow gauge passenger trains ran from Yeovil Pen Mill to Durston, with some extensions to Highbridge. However the volume of traffic was very disappointing, and five of the eight locomotives purchased for the workings were converted to broad gauge by 1871.|$|R
50|$|Railway traffic has sharply {{increased}} {{in recent years}} on the section between Nordhausen and Ilfeld. Since 2004 Nordhausen hybrid-trams have run directly from Ilfeld into the tram network at Nordhausen. Other trains run to Eisfelder Talmühle and continue onto the Selke Valley Railway. Apart from one pair of steam trains, all services are worked by diesel railbuses. The only remaining goods trains on the Harz Narrow Gauge Railways work the line between Nordhausen and Eisfelder Talmühle. These regularly transport standard gauge ballast wagons from the Hartsteinwerken Unterberg on rollbocks to Nordhausen. A number of converted diesel locomotives are available for this, which have couplers and buffers at the right height for handling standard <b>gauge</b> <b>goods</b> wagons.|$|R
5000|$|The {{station was}} opened by the Great Western Railway on 1 June 1877 {{on their new}} branch line from [...] to [...] No goods sidings were ever {{provided}} at the station, but a line was laid from the station out to sidings on Lelant Wharf where traffic could be transferred between railway wagons and boats. The St Ives branch was laid using [...] broad gauge but in October 1888 a third rail {{was added to the}} line from St Erth to allow [...] standard <b>gauge</b> <b>goods</b> trains to reach the wharf. The last broad gauge train ran on Friday 20 May 1892; since the following Monday all trains have been standard gauge.|$|R
50|$|In November 1993 {{the newly}} founded Döllnitzbahn GmbH {{took over the}} {{remaining}} lines of the Mügeln railway network between Oschatz, Mügeln and Kemmlitz. The primary aim of the company was initially {{the preservation of the}} remaining goods traffic from the kaolin mine at Kemmlitz. For that purpose used narrow <b>gauge</b> <b>goods</b> wagons were bought from the Mansfeld mining railway and a new transshipment site to the standard gauge railway network was built in Oschatz. With the help of used PKP diesel locomotives, they succeeeded initially in keeping the goods traffic going. In spite of this, the demand gradually fell so that goods services had to be closed in 2001. The Döllnitzbahn was the last narrow gauge railway in Saxony to run public freight services.|$|R
5000|$|The {{line was}} sold to the Great Western Railway and its [...] "Associated Companies" [...] (the Bristol and Exeter Railway and South Devon Railway) on 1 January 1866. The new owners quickly {{converted}} the line to mixed gauge using three rails so that both broad and [...] "narrow" [...] trains could operate. Broad <b>gauge</b> <b>goods</b> trains started running in November that year, with through passenger trains running to London from 1 March 1867. The last broad gauge train arrived at 8.49pm on 20 May 1892, having left London Paddington railway station at 10.15am that morning. The two locomotives, numbers 1256 and 3557, took the carriages away to Swindon railway works at 9.57pm, and all trains since have been standard gauge.|$|R
50|$|The impecunious West Cornwall company {{sold its}} railway {{to the more}} {{powerful}} broad gauge Associated Companies, dominated by the Great Western Railway, and the new owners converted the West Cornwall line to broad <b>gauge.</b> Through <b>goods</b> trains started running in 1866 and passenger trains in 1867.|$|R
40|$|A new 50 -ohm piezoresistive {{pressure}} gauge {{has been developed}} and calibrated in the range 0 to 4. 0 GPa. This ``pinducer`` consists of one half of 100 ohm, one quarter watt, carbon composition resistor mounted coaxially {{at the end of}} a small brass tube. Three techniques have been used to calibrate this new <b>gauge.</b> <b>Good</b> agreement is found between all calibration data, and a smooth curve is fit through all resistance change versus pressure data up to 1. 5 GPa. The gauges exhibit rise times of about 0. 5 {mu}s. They offer advantages in raggedness, cost, and flexibility of application. The pinducer can be successfully used in divergent flows, harsh environments, and positions where lead protection would be impossible with thin-film gauges. A unique application is demonstrated...|$|R
50|$|The {{system of}} German railway wagon classes (Wagengattungen) was {{introduced}} in Germany in 1902 and 1905 by the Prussian state railways based on their system of norms, and was soon {{taken up by the}} other state railways (Länderbahnen). On the formation of the Deutsche Reichsbahn, the system became mandatory across the whole of Germany. In the course of the years more and more adjustments to it were made. It was finally replaced between 1964 and 1968 when the two German railway administrations - the Deutsche Bundesbahn and the Deutsche Reichsbahn (East Germany) - adopted the internationally standard UIC classifications for passenger coaches and goods wagons. Today, you will still find the system regularly being used for narrow <b>gauge</b> <b>goods</b> wagons, because these were not generally given UIC designations, as well as on many historic vehicles.|$|R
50|$|The Danish Pile Driving Formula is {{a formula}} which enables one {{to have a}} <b>good</b> <b>gauge</b> of the bearing {{capacity}} of a driven pile.|$|R
50|$|The Great Western Railway and {{companies}} friendly to it used the broad gauge, while the narrow gauge (later known as standard gauge) was in use on most other lines. Where {{two lines of}} different <b>gauges</b> connected, <b>goods</b> and minerals making a through transit had to be physically transshipped, and passengers had to change trains.|$|R
25|$|The West Cornwall Railway {{had been}} opened as a {{standard}} gauge line {{but there was a}} legal provision that enabled the Cornwall Railway to demand that they install broad gauge rails. Since this was obviously conducive to more efficient operation, the Cornwall company activated the requirement in 1864. The West Cornwall company was in the same severe financial difficulty as the Cornwall Railway, and had to surrender its line to the Associated Companies, who themselves installed the broad gauge rails. The takeover took effect from 1 July 1865, and broad <b>gauge</b> <b>goods</b> trains started running on 6 November 1866, with passenger trains from 1 March 1867. This significantly improved operations, and with through passenger trains running from Penzance to London, the subordinate status of the Falmouth line was emphasised: it was now simply a branch line, thought of recapturing the packet traffic having long since been forgotten.|$|R
