5|$|Talal Hassan Abu Rahma studied {{business}} {{administration in the}} United States, and began working as a freelance cameraman for France2 in Gaza in 1988. At {{the time of the}} shooting, he ran his own press office, the National News Center, contributed to CNN through the Al-Wataneya Press Office, and was {{a board member of the}} Palestinian Journalists' Association. His coverage of the al-Durrah shooting brought him several journalism awards, including the Rory Peck Award in 2001. According to France2 correspondent Gérard Grizbec, Abu Rahma <b>had</b> <b>never</b> <b>been</b> a member of a Palestinian political group, had twice been arrested by Palestinian police for filming images that did not meet the approval of Yasser Arafat, and <b>had</b> <b>never</b> <b>been</b> accused of security breaches by Israel.|$|E

5|$|The {{head was}} {{conclusively}} seen on Westminster Hall {{as late as}} 1684, {{and it was on}} the south side of the Hall. Archaeological evidence also disproved its authenticity.

5|$|While {{lacking in}} the social qualities common to politicians, one {{characteristic}} served Goebel well in the political arenahis intellect.

5|$|In August 1923 Moriarty died, and Fortune—who <b>had</b> <b>never</b> <b>been</b> {{particularly}} popular among his followers—tried {{to convince them}} that she should be their new leader. A few accepted her offer, but many others instead accepted the leadership of Stafford-Allen. Meanwhile, Fortune's parents relocated to the garden city of Letchworth, Hertfordshire in 1922, and it was here that Fortune carried out what she deemed to be additional communications with the Masters through trance mediumship between 1923 and 1925.|$|E
5|$|In early July 1941, Rejewski and Zygalski {{were asked}} to try solving {{messages}} enciphered on the secret Polish Lacida cipher machine, which was used for secure communications between Cadix and the Polish General Staff in London. Lacida was a rotor machine {{based on the same}} cryptographic principle as Enigma, yet <b>had</b> <b>never</b> <b>been</b> subjected to rigorous security analysis. The two cryptologists created consternation by breaking the first message within a couple of hours; further messages were solved in a similar way.|$|E
5|$|Legal {{proceedings}} {{began when}} the insurers refused to compensate the owners of Zong. The dispute was initially tried at the Guildhall in London on 6March 1783, with the Lord Chief Justice, the Earl of Mansfield, overseeing the trial before a jury. Mansfield was previously the judge in Somersett's Case in 1772, which concerned the legality of keeping slaves in Britain. He had ruled that slavery <b>had</b> <b>never</b> <b>been</b> established by statute in Britain and was not supported by common law.|$|E

5|$|Technical {{difficulties}} {{included the}} very high transistor counts needed to support the wide instruction words and the large caches. There were also structural problems within the project, as the {{two parts of the}} joint team used different methodologies and had slightly different priorities. Since Merced was the first EPIC processor, the development effort encountered more unanticipated problems than the team was accustomed to. In addition, the EPIC concept depends on compiler capabilities that <b>had</b> <b>never</b> <b>been</b> implemented before, so more research was needed.|$|E
