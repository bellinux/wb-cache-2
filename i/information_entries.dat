40|$|INTRODUCTION: High quality {{entries in}} case notes are {{becoming}} increasingly important. Standards exist on what <b>information</b> <b>entries</b> should contain. We have compared case notes from surgical teams at the Royal Glamorgan Hospital with standards based on guidelines from The Royal College of Surgeons of England. PATIENTS AND METHODS: A total of 120 case notes, randomly selected {{from the department of}} general surgery, were reviewed. RESULTS: An 80 % compliance was achieved in 25 / 35 standards and 100 % was achieved in 6 (patient's name, date, surgeon's name and type of operation on the operation sheet and consent form signed and dated). The following fell short of 80 % compliance: PAS number on every page (75 %); entries timed (27 %); and clinician's name (16 %) and designation (27 %) printed. Social history was only recorded in 73 % of clerkings and family history in 33 %. Results of laboratory tests were signed in 65 % of notes and radiological tests were signed in 41 %. CONCLUSIONS: Healthcare professionals need to be aware of, and comply with, standards. House officers should be given information about standards at departmental induction or during medical training...|$|E
40|$|Electronic Healthcare {{record keeping}} can be daunting. The {{available}} software does not usually allow for clinicians to input information concordant with their clinical work- ow. This disrupts the clinician-patient encounter {{and can lead}} to frustration for both clinicians and patients. Because of this, the organic interaction between the patient and the clinician is not accurately recorded with available EHR systems. For example, the idiosyncrasies of individual patients—how and why they present certain information—as well as the clinician’s response can be signi cant but are ignored by the demands of EHR data entry. Patient or person-centered care is increasingly recognized as a fundamental principle and value in increasing bene cial health outcomes. Therefore, EHR systems ought to allow both collaborative <b>information</b> <b>entries</b> with clinicians and follow the patient’s lead in terms of setting priorities for care. This user interface is designed to accommodate the recording of the organic interface that takes place between the clinician and the patient while patient-centric. It also accommodates all the patient records in a singular interface, and yet make the interface easy to understand and use. A signi cant amount of project is dedicated to understand the user work ow and develop information architecture to make the software mold {{to the needs of the}} user rather than the other way around...|$|E
40|$|Background Due to {{the nature}} of {{information}} generation in health care, clinical documents contain duplicate and sometimes conflicting information. Recent implementation of Health Information Exchange (HIE) mechanisms in which clinical summary documents are exchanged among disparate health care organizations can proliferate duplicate and conflicting information. Materials and methods To reduce information overload, a system to automatically consolidate information across multiple clinical summary documents was developed for an HIE network. The system receives any number of Continuity of Care Documents (CCDs) and outputs a single, consolidated record. To test the system, a randomly sampled corpus of 522 CCDs representing 50 unique patients was extracted from a large HIE network. The automated methods were compared to manual consolidation of information for three key sections of the CCD: problems, allergies, and medications. Results Manual consolidation of 11, 631 entries was completed in approximately 150 h. The same data were automatically consolidated in 3. 3 min. The system successfully consolidated 99. 1 % of problems, 87. 0 % of allergies, and 91. 7 % of medications. Almost all of the inaccuracies were caused by issues involving the use of standardized terminologies within the documents to represent individual <b>information</b> <b>entries.</b> Conclusion This study represents a novel, tested tool for de-duplication and consolidation of CDA documents, which is a major step toward improving information access and the interoperability among information systems. While more work is necessary, automated systems like the one evaluated in this study will be necessary to meet the informatics needs of providers and health systems in the future...|$|E

40|$|Seamless and {{accurate}} hand-over of building information {{is a major}} bottleneck in promoting an automated facilities management (FM) practice and an integrated and life-cycle-oriented construction. Few Building Information Modelling (BIM) tools have so far been developed specifically for facility managers. Current data input methods applied for conventional Computerized Maintenance and Management Systems (CMMS) are prone to duplicate <b>information</b> <b>entries</b> and information loss. Such an approach to data management builds up additional costs and seriously hampers fulfilment of environmental goals. In search of a thorough acknowledgement of both technical and process-based requirements {{for dealing with the}} aforementioned deficiencies, this descriptive theoretical study takes a qualitative approach and focuses on status quo and potentials for migration of building information and analytical capabilities from AEC-centric BIM tools to facility managers, owners, and users. Data has been collected mainly through literature and workshops. It has been complemented by a number of exploratory studies on existing technologies. This is a basic research aimed at illuminating the path for further applied research activities. Results show that the bulk of the FM sector still confronts substantial challenges regarding appropriate access to building information that is often caused by deficiencies with current workflows, contracts, and IT infrastructure. Thorough implementation of established and developing standards such as IFC and COBie to be used in BIM-enabled FM systems entails a complete shift from as-designed and as-built documents to their as-commissioned and as-operated successors. In an interoperable FM information system based on or closely connected to post-constructional BIM technologies, performance data, and sensor data from Building Automation Systems (BAS’s) will be cycled back to inform both better design and better operation.

40|$|Thesis (MTech (Information Technology)) [...] Peninsula Technikon, 2005. This {{study was}} {{initiated}} {{to investigate whether}} power distance facilitates the successful implementation of a hospital information system. A comparative study was done to evaluate the effect of culture on the same information system (CLINICOM), implemented at the same time, but at different locations. The overall objective {{of this study was}} to identify the importance of culture in the implementation of In formation systems and how output influences the success of a system. • The first objective was to assess the organizational culture in each hospital in terms of one of the dimensions of culture on Hofstede's check Iist, namely power distance. • The second objective was to determine whether the speed with which a HIS was implemented was a success at the two academic hospitals in the Western Cape using the reduction of the level of backlog (paper based patient registration records) as a measure of implementation progress. The literature was reviewed on what determines the success of an information system. The effects of culture were studied and in particular power distance on the implementation of an information system and how this factor affected the backlog of <b>information</b> <b>entries.</b> Questionnaires were administered to the clerical staff at the hospitals, as they were the high users of the information system. The study showed that both institutions had a high power distance score, but the one institution had a Power distance Index (POI) that was considerable higher than the other. PDr relates to the concentration of authority. This finding suggests that the managers were more autocratic at the one hospital than at the other. The study found that the higher the PDI, the faster the backlog was reduced at implementation. Thus the higher the por the greater the concentration of authority...|$|E
