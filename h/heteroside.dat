40|$|Coffee species {{originating}} from Africa, {{in particular the}} two major cultivated species #C. arabica$ and #C. canephora$, usually contain caffeine in their beans, whereas almost all Malagasy coffee species are caffeine-free. However, one wild coffee species #C. pseudozanguebariae$, collected near the coast in south Kenya, is also caffeine-free. Beans of this species contain a specific <b>heteroside</b> diterpene (hereinafter referred to simply as <b>heteroside)</b> and give a bitter coffee beverage. We have investigated the inheritance of the caffeine and heteropside contents {{of the first and}} second generations of an interspecific cross between #C. pseudozanguebariae$ and #C. liberica$ var #dewevei$, for which the caffeine content is about 1 % dmb (dry matter basis). The caffeine content of F 1 hybrids (0. 2 % dmb) was lower than the parental average (0. 47 % dmb). Caffeine and <b>heteroside</b> contents appeared to be under polygenic control with a strong genetic effect. Nevertheless, one major gene with two alleles seemed {{to be involved in the}} control of both compounds. Absence of caffeine was apparently controlled by one recessive gene. <b>Heteroside</b> content seemed to be controlled by one co-dominant gene, heterozygotes being intermediate between the two different groups of homozygotes.

40|$|The {{inheritance}} {{and relationships}} between four traits of agronomic and quality interest-fructification time, caffeine, and <b>heteroside</b> contents and 100 -bean weight-were analyzed {{in the first}} backcross hybrids derived from an interspecific cross between Coffea pseudozanguebariae and Coffea canephora. We showed that short vs. long fructification time was governed by one major gene with two co-dominant alleles ft 1 and ft 2. Absence vs. presence of both caffeine and <b>heteroside</b> was also controlled by one major gene. The allele responsible {{for the presence of}} caffeine (caf 2) dominated over the absence one (caf 1) whereas both alleles controlling <b>heteroside,</b> het 1 and het 2, were co-dominant. The fructification time and the <b>heteroside</b> content were additive while the caffeine content seemed multiplicative. The 100 -bean weight was additive and under a polygenic control. The two genes ft and caf were linked, separated by 30. 8 cM, and were independent from the het gene. The relationships between the four traits were not strong enough, except between 100 -bean weight and fructification time (r = 0. 43) or caffeine content (r = 0. 41). Recombination occurred between the genes controlling the four traits suggesting that new introgressed Robusta varieties, characterized by short, medium, or long fructification time depending on demand, bigger seeds with low or no caffeine content, and being heteroside-free, could be produced...|$|E

The objective {{of this study was}} to investigate the chemical composition of the geopropolis of Melipona quadrifasciata anthidioides and to evaluate its antioxidant, antimutagenic, anti-inflammatory, and antimicrobial activities. The composition of the hydroethanolic extract of geopropolis (HEG) included di- and trigalloyl and phenylpropanyl <b>heteroside</b> derivatives, flavanones, diterpenes, and triterpenes. HEG showed antioxidant action via the direct capture of free radicals and by inhibiting the levels of oxidative hemolysis and malondialdehyde in human erythrocytes under oxidative stress. HEG also reduced the frequency of gene conversion and the number of mutant colonies of S. cerevisiae. The anti-inflammatory action of HEG was demonstrated by the inhibition of hyaluronidase enzyme activity. In addition, HEG induced cell death in all evaluated gram-positive bacteria, gram-negative bacteria, and yeasts, including clinical isolates with antimicrobial drug resistance.

40|$|Natural {{products}} {{can be a}} source of biomolecules with antioxidant activity which are able to prevent oxidative stress-induced diseases and show antitumor activity, making them important sources of new anticancer drug prototypes. In this context, this study aimed to analyze the chemical composition of an ethanol extract of Senna velutina leaves and to assess its antioxidant and cytotoxic activities in leukemic cells. The antioxidant properties were evaluated using a DPPH free radical scavenging assay and by examining the extract’s inhibition of AAPH-induced lipid peroxidation in human erythrocytes. Its cytotoxicity and possible mechanisms of action were assessed in Jurkat and K 562 leukemic cell lines. The ethanol extract contained flavonoids, such as epigallocatechin, epicatechin, kaempferol <b>heteroside,</b> rutin, and dimeric and trimeric proanthocyanidin derivatives. The extract exhibited antioxidant activity by scavenging free radicals and antihemolytic action, and it decreased malondialdehyde content in human erythrocytes. Furthermore, the extract also induced leukemic cell death by activating intracellular calcium and caspase- 3, decreasing mitochondrial membrane potential, and arresting the cell cycle in S and G 2 phases. Hence, S. velutina leaf extract contains antioxidant and antileukemic biomolecules with potential applications in diseases associated with oxidative stress and in the inhibition of tumor cell proliferation...|$|E
40|$|The {{qualitative}} and quantitative occurrence of low-molecular-weight carbohydrates (LMWCs) in the Florideophyceae was surveyed using 13 C-nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy and high-performance liquid chromatography. Besides the joint occurrence of the heterosides floridoside and digeneaside in various Florideophycean orders (Ceramiales, Rhodymeniales, Gelidiales and Gigartinales), the disaccharide trehalose was detected only in {{several members of the}} Ceramiales. While some taxa of the latter order such as Aglaothamnion exhibited only trehalose, others, such as Delesseria sanguinea, showed trehalose together with digeneaside. The biosynthesis and physiological function of trehalose in red algae remains an open question. In addition, recent data from the literature indicate strong variation between phenotypic and genotypic formation of trehalose among red algal orders, and hence there exists some uncertainty to use this disaccharide as a chemotaxonomic marker. The occurrence of digeneaside in so many phylogenetically different Florideophycean taxa clearly negates any diagnostic value for this particular <b>heteroside</b> in the Ceramiales. In conclusion, while trehalose and digeneaside are unsuitable as chemotaxonomic markers for red algal phylogeny, other LMWCs, such as polyols and D-/L-isofloridoside, well support recent molecular taxonomic treatments.

It was partially identified by NMR spectroscopic procedures. The {{presence of a}} megastigm- 4 -en- 9 -one structure with an enol-ether function in the C 4 position and a OH/OR function in the C 6 position was ascertained.

We have found the hydroalcoholic extract of this plant leaf {{has the potential to}} treat urolithiasis, a problem affecting similar to 7 % of the population. To isolate the functional compounds C. langsdorffii leaves were dried, ground, and macerated in a hydroalcoholic solution 7 : 3 to produce a 16. 8 % crude extract after solvent elimination. Urolithiasis was induced by introduction of a calcium oxalate pellet (CaOx) into the bladders of adult male Wistar rats. The treated groups received the crude extract by oral gavage at 20 mg/kg body weight daily for 18 days. Extract treatment started 30 days after CaOx seed implantation. To monitor renal function sodium, potassium and creatinine concentrations were analyzed in urine and plasma, and were found to be in the normal range. Analyses of pH, magnesium, phosphate, calcium, uric acid, oxalate and citrate levels were evaluated to determine whether the C. langsdorffii extract may function as a stone formation prevention agent. The HPLC analysis of the extract identified flavonoids quercitrin and afzelin as the major components. Animals treated with C. langsdorffii have increased levels of magnesium and decreased levels of uric acid in urinary excretions. Treated animals have a significant decrease in the mean number of calculi and a reduction in calculi mass. Calculi taken from extract treated animals were more brittle and fragile than calculi from untreated animals. Moreover, breaking calculi from untreated animals required twice the amount of pressure as calculi from treated animals (6. 90 +/- A 3. 45 vs. 3. 00 +/- A 1. 51). The extract is rich in flavonoid <b>heterosides</b> and other phenolic compounds. Therefore, we hypothesize this class of compounds might contribute significantly to the observed activity.

40|$|Hypericum perforatum L. is a plant {{which is}} well known for ages because of its {{medicinal}} properties. St. John Wort was even prescribed by Hippocrates, the father of medicine, Dioscorides the father of pharmacognosy and Pliny. This plant was used as a treatment for puncture wounds, headaches, burns and infections. It is believed that the black - red dots and the translucent perforations on the plant contain the most medicinal properties. The name Hypericum refers {{on the use of the}} plant to wart off evil, by hanging plants over a picture in the house during St. John’s day. The name perforatum refers to the presence of small oil glands in the leaves. Hypericum perforatum L. has long been used as an ancient folk cure for maladies including wounds kidney, lung ailments and depression. The European physicians used the plant for vertigo, burns, paranoia and spontaneous abortion. In ancient time this plant has a history in magic. Also it, was used to protect the live from ailments, protections from death and discover the length of life of family members. The black - red dots on the petals of the plant symbolize the blood shed by St. John at his beheading. In addition the translucent spots on the leaves represent the tears shed because of the event. It has wide range of medical uses because of its chemical composition. St. John’s wort contains procyanidins, antrachinons, carbohydrates, alcohols, triterpenes, sterols, <b>heterosides</b> of phenol carbonic acids and flavonoids, naftodiantronic compounds, phenolic acids, phloroglucinols and essential oils. In the 21 st century, science has offered scientific explanation of St. John’s wort’s features and explained its application, as well as its important role in pharmacy and medicine with its antibacterial, antiviral and antidepressive effects. Presentation of the development of the ideas associated with St. John’s wort, and the evolution of the notions, increased the ability of the pharmacists and physicians to respond to the challenges of their professional services in facilating the human life.

40|$|Cellular {{membranes}} {{are important}} sites {{of interaction between}} cells and their environment. Among the multitude of macromolecular complexes embedded in these membranes, transporters play a particularly important role. These integral membrane proteins perform a number of vital functions that enable cell adaptation to changing environmental conditions. Osmotic stress is a major external stimulus for cells. Bacteria are frequently exposed to either hyperosmotic or hypoosmotic stress. Typical conditions for soil bacteria, such as Corynebacterium glutamicum, vary between dryness and sudden rainfall. Physical stimuli caused by osmotic stress have to be sensed and used to activate appropriate response mechanisms. Hypoosmotic stress causes immediate and uncontrolled influx of water. Cells counteract by instantly opening mechanosensitive channels, which act as emergency valves leading to fast efflux of small solutes out of the cell, therebydiminishing the osmotic gradient across the cell membrane. Hyperosmotic stress, on the other hand, results in water efflux. This is counterbalanced by an accumulation of small, osmotically active solutes in the cytoplasm, the so-called compatible solutes. They comprise a large variety of substances, including amino acids (proline), amino acid derivatives (betaine, ectoine), oligosaccharides (trehalose), and <b>heterosides</b> (glucosylglycerol). Osmoregulated transporters sense intracellular osmotic pressure and respond to hyperosmotic stress by facilitating the inward translocation of compatible solutes across the cell membrane, to restore normal hydration levels. This work presents the first X-ray structure {{of a member of}} the Betaine-Choline-Carnitine-Transporter (BCCT) family, BetP. This Na+-coupled symporter from Corynebacterium glutamicum is a highly effective osmoregulated and specific uptake system for glycine-betaine. X-ray structure determination was achieved using single wavelength anomalous dispersion (SAD) of selenium atoms. Selenium was incorporated into the protein during its expression in methione auxotrophic E. coli cells, grown in media supplemented with selenomethionine. SAD data with anomalous signal up to 5 Å led to the detection of 39 selenium sites, which were used to calculate the initial electron density map of the protein. Medium resolution and high data anisotropy made the structure determination of BetP a challenging task. A specific strategy for data anisotropy correction and a combination of various crystallographic programs were necessary to obtain an interpretable electron density map suitable for model building. The crystal structure of BetP shows a trimer with glycine-betaine bound in a three-fold cation-pi interaction built by conserved tryptophan residues. The bound substrate is occluded {{from both sides of the}} membrane and aromatic side chains line its transport pathway. Very interestingly, the structure reveals that the alpha-helical C-terminal domain, for which a chemo- and osmosensory function was elucidated by biochemical methods, interacts with cytoplasmic loops of an adjacent monomer. These unexpected monomer-monomer interactions are thought to be crucial for the activation mechanism of BetP, and a new atomic model combing biochemical results with the crystal structure is proposed. BetP is shown to have the same overall fold as three unrelated Na+-coupled symporters. While these were crystallised in either the outward- or inward-facing conformation, BetP reveals a unique intermediate state, opening new perspectives on the alternating access mechanism of transport...|$|R
