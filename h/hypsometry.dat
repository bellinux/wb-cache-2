40|$|The tide acts on {{coastal and}} estuarine systems, amongst others by {{inducing}} (1) sediment transport and, as a consequence, (2) morphological change. The tide-induced behavior of suspended sediment transport {{has been studied}} by individually solving the 1 D vertical suspended sediment advection-diffusivity equation and the 1 D depth-averaged suspended sediment transport equation. The solutions provide {{a good understanding of}} two aspects of the problem, namely that (1) the phase lag increases linearly with height above the bed, whereas the amplitude of the SSC variation decreases exponentially with height; and that (2) the relative contributions of local resuspension and advection to depth-averaged suspended sediment concentration can be determined and that the empirical decomposition terms of horizontal residual fluxes of suspended sediment have clear physical explanations. The morphological modeling of back-barrier tidal basins in the Wadden Sea shows that, in equilibrium states, (1) the dimensional parameters of channel area and volume are proportional to the 1. 5 power of the basin area and tidal prism, respectively, whereas the dimensionless parameters of relative channel area and the ratio between channel volume and tidal prism are both proportional to the square root of basin area. The values of the coefficients before the power in these relations are of the order of 10 - 5, and (2) large basin areas and low tidal ranges favor strong concave-up <b>hypsometries,</b> whereas small basin areas and high tidal ranges favor less concave-up <b>hypsometries,</b> which have been interpreted {{as a response to the}} relative area of intertidal areas or channels in the tidal basins. The long-term (6, 000 years) modeling results of the large funnel-shaped tide-dominated estuarine morphology shows the development of a sand bar that reached equilibrium within about 3, 000 years as the leading order characteristics of the estuarine bed. Its general shape, size and position is consistent with historical observations in the Qiangtangjiang Estuary, China.

The wide range of glacier types allows for the first mass balance comparison between clean, debris, and lake-terminating (calving) glaciers in the region.

40|$|The {{anticipated}} {{retreat of}} glaciers {{around the globe}} will pose far-reaching challenges to the management of fresh water resources and significantly contribute to sea-level rise within the coming decades. Here, we present a new model for calculating the 21 st century mass changes of all glaciers on Earth outside the ice sheets. The Global Glacier Evolution Model (GloGEM) includes mass loss due to frontal ablation at marine-terminating glacier fronts and accounts for glacier advance/retreat and surface Elevation changes. Simulations are driven with monthly near-surface air temperature and precipitation from 14 Global Circulation Models forced by the RCP 2. 6, RCP 4. 5 and RCP 8. 5 emission scenarios. Depending on the scenario, the model yields a global glacier volume loss of 25 - 48 % between 2010 and 2100. For calculating glacier contribution to sea-level rise, we account for ice located below sea-level presently displacing ocean water. This effect reduces glacier contribution by 11 - 14 %, so that our model predicts a sea-level equivalent (multi-model mean +- 1 standard deviation) of 79 +- 24 mm (RCP 2. 6), 108 +- 28 mm (RCP 4. 5) and 157 +- 31 mm (RCP 8. 5). Mass losses by frontal ablation account for 10 % of total ablation globally, and up to 30 % regionally.

40|$|Lake {{sediment}} {{records from}} the Cordillera de Mérida in the northern Venezuelan Andes document the history of local glacial variability and climate changes during the Holocene (∼ 12 ka to the present). The valleys that contain these lakes have similar bedrock compositions and <b>hypsometries,</b> but have different headwall elevations and aspects, which makes them useful for investigating the magnitude of past glaciations. There was widespread glacial retreat in the Venezuelan Andes during the early Holocene, after which most watersheds remained ice free, and thus far only valleys with headwalls higher than ∼ 4400 m asl contain evidence of glaciation during the last ∼ 10 ka. There was a pronounced shift in sediment composition for the Montos (headwall: ∼ 4750 m asl) and Los Anteojos (headwall: ∼ 4400 m asl) records during the middle Holocene from ∼ 8. 0 to 7. 7 ka when conditions appear to have become ice free and drier. There is tentative evidence that the glacier in the Mucubají valley (headwall: ∼ 4609 m asl) advanced from ∼ 8. 1 to 6. 6 ka and then retreated during the latter stages of the middle Holocene. Clastic sediment accumulation in other nearby lake basins was either low or decreased {{throughout most of the}} middle Holocene as watersheds stabilized under warmer and/or drier conditions. In the Montos record, there was another major shift in sediment composition that occurred from ∼ 6. 5 to 5. 7 ka, similar to other regional records that suggest conditions were drier during this period. Overall, the late Holocene was a period of warmer and wetter conditions with ice extent at a minimum in the northern tropical Andes. There were also punctuated decadal to multi-centennial periods of higher clastic sediment accumulation during the last ∼ 4 ka, likely in response to periods of cooling and/or local precipitation changes. In watersheds with headwalls above 4600 m asl, there is evidence of glacial advances during the Little Ice Age (∼ 0. 6 – 0. 1 ka). The pattern of glacial variability is generally similar in both the northern and southern tropics during the Little Ice Age, suggesting that ice margins in both regions were responding to colder and wetter conditions during the latest Holocene. The observed pattern of Holocene climate variability in the Venezuelan Andes cannot be explained by insolation forcing alone, and tropical ocean influences were likely associated with the observed glacial and lake level changes...|$|R

40|$|<b>Hypsometry</b> has {{historically}} been used {{as an indicator of}} geomorphic form of catchments and landforms. Yet there has been little work aimed at relating <b>hypsometry</b> to landform process and scale. This paper uses the SIBERIA catchment evolution model to explore linkages between catchment process and <b>hypsometry.</b> SIBERIA generates results that are qualitatively and quantitatively similar to observed hypsometric curves for physically realistic parameters. However, we show that not only does the <b>hypsometry</b> reflect landscape runoff and erosion process, but it is strongly dependent on channel network and catchment geometry. We show that the width to length ratio of the catchment has a significant influence on the shape of the hypsometric curve, though little on the hypsometric integral. For landforms dominated by fluvial sediment transport, the classic Strahler mature hypsometric curve is only generated for catchments with roughly equal width and length. Narrow catchments show a hypsometric curve more similar to Strahler's monadnock form. For landscapes dominated by diffusive transport, the simulated hypsometric curve is concave-down everywhere, this being consistent with curves reported for some example catchments in France. Because the transition between diffusive dominance to fluvial is scale-dependent, with larger catchments exhibiting greater fluvial dominance, then the hypsometric curve is a scale-dependent descriptor of landforms. Experimental results for simulated landforms from a small-scale rainfall-erosion simulator are reported. It is shown that SIBERIA yields satisfactory fits to the data, confirming its ability to predict the form of the hypsometric curve from a simple model of geomorphic processes...|$|E
40|$|A {{survey of}} the modern {{physical}} setting of Lake El’gygytgyn, northeastern Siberia, is presented here to facilitate interpretation of a 250, 000 -year climate record derived from sediment cores from the lake bottom. The lake lies inside a meteorite impact crater that is approximately 18 km in diameter, with a total watershed area of 293 km 2, 110 km 2 of which is lake surface. The only surface water entering the lake comes from the approximately 50 streams draining from within the crater rim; a numbering system for these inlet streams is adopted to facilitate scientific discussion. We created a digital elevation model for the watershed {{and used it to}} create <b>hypsometries,</b> channel networks, and drainage area statistics for each of the inlet streams. Many of the streams enter shallow lagoons dammed by gravel berms at the lakeshore; these lagoons may {{play a significant role in}} the thermal and biological dynamics of the lake due to their higher water temperatures (3 ̆e 6 °C). The lake itself is approximately 12 km wide and 175 m deep, with a volume of 14. 1 km 3. Water temperature within a column of water near the center of this oligotrophic, monomictic lake never exceeded 4 °C over a 2. 5 year record, though the shallow shelves (3 ̆c 103 ̆em) surrounding the lake can reach 5 °C in summer. Though thermally stratified in winter, the water appears completely mixed shortly after lake ice breakup in July. Mean annual air temperature measured about 200 m from the lake was − 10. 3 °C in 2002, and an unshielded rain gage there recorded 70 mm of rain in summer of 2002. End of winter snow water equivalent on the lake was approximately 110 mm in May 2002. Analysis of NCEP reanalysis air temperatures (1948 – 2002) reveals that the 8 warmest years and 10 warmest winters have occurred since 1989, with the number of days below − 30 °C dropping from a pre- 1989 mean of 35 to near 0 in recent years. The crater region is windy as well as cold, with hourly wind speeds exceeding 13. 4 m s− 1 (30 mph) typically at least once each month and 17. 8 m s− 1 (40 mph) in winter months, with only a few calm days per month; wind may also play an important role in controlling the modern shape of the lake. Numerous lines of evidence suggest that the physical hydrology and limnology of the lake has changed substantially over the past 3. 6 million years, and some of the implications of these changes on paleoclimate reconstructions are discussed...|$|R
40|$|The Wadden Sea is {{characterized}} by barrier islands separated by tidal inlets consisting {{of a system of}} inter-tidal flats and channels. It is an ecologically valuable area. Accelerated sea-level rise due to climate change combined with human interference which may cause land subsidence can have significant impact on the Wadden Sea system. A major question of concern is how vulnerable the Wadden Sea system is to the relative sea-level rise. The present study focuses at the apparent deviant behaviour of the Lister Tief tidal basin compared to Dutch tidal basins in the Wadden Sea. All the tidal basins in the Dutch Wadden Sea appear to import sediment such that the deposition in the basins tend to cope with the low sea-level rise rate of about 20 cm/century at present. The Lister Tief, a tidal basin located between Germany and Denmark, appears to be eroding sediment despite the sea-level rise. Long-term modelling, needed for large scale systems like the Wadden Sea, can be done by the model ASMITA. It is a semi-empirical model which appears to be a powerful tool for simulating the long-term morphological development under influence of sea-level rise. In this study the Lister Tief basin is compared with the tidal basins in the Dutch Wadden Sea concerning aspects including the <b>hypsometry</b> and tidal asymmetry. Moreover, results of application of the ASMITA model are compared with the development of parameters representing <b>hypsometry</b> and tidal asymmetry under relative sea-level rise. The hypothesis was that the <b>hypsometry</b> of the Lister Tief could be the reason for the deviant behaviour of the Lister Tief tidal basin. From the analysis carried out in this study it appears that the Lister Tief tidal basin is not behaving differently than Dutch tidal basins under relative sea-level rise.

This paper aims at analyzing 3 D morphometric properties of channel networks {{on the basis of}} probabilistic relationships relating the drained area and the elevation. The methodology is an extension of the fundamental planar power-law description proposed by Rodriguez-Iturbe et al. () representing the probability that the drained area A is higher than a threshold area a, P[A>a]similar to a(-beta), where beta is constant and represents an invariant property of natural river networks. A new scaling factor taking into account <b>hypsometry</b> is introduced in the previous power-law relationship, as P[A>a]similar to a(-tau) F(a/theta(z)), where F is a scaling function and theta {{is a measure of the}} system scale and a function of <b>hypsometry.</b> The new power law has one empirical parameter tau. A procedure was developed to calibrate this parameter and to calculate the corresponding uncertainty for applications on a single basin and then extended to a set of 70 basins in the Southern Rocky Mountains. The results show that the 3 D power law exhibits scale-invariance properties with respect to theta, when applied to a single basin. Looking at the entire set of 70 basins, the criterion value associated with the uncertainty model shows a moderate loss in scaling quality compared with the basin-per-basin description but nevertheless remains acceptable.

Soil use is distributed in 1. 8 % urban area, 35. 5 % grazing, 12 % annual crops, 6. 3 % primary forest, 3. 2 % forest in regeneration, 40. 4 % reforestation and 1. 1 % of water bodies. The area of 482. 4 km 2 (9. 2 %) has restriction regarding to slope (higher than 30 %). All procedures were repeated for the other three sub-basins. Pages: 3405 - 341...|$|E
40|$|The Second Military Survey in {{the territories}} of the former Austro-Hungarian Monarchy was {{performed}} between 1806 and 1869. The territory of Bohemia was surveyed from 1842 to 1852 and Moravia and Silesia from 1836 to 1840. After detailed study of the Lehmann´s theory of displaying the topographic landforms using hachure’s, it was detected that the hachure’s in the maps of the Second Military Survey were created {{by means of the}} modified Lehmann´s scale. The representation of landforms in maps of the Second Military Survey was accomplished by spot heights represented mostly by points of geodetic control. The aim of this contribution is to propose and describe the methodology of creating the digital terrain model (DTM) from the Second Military Survey <b>hypsometry</b> and to analyse its accuracy. A part of the map sheet (W_II_ 11) of the Second Military Survey, representing the long-standing military training area Brdy, was chosen as a model area. The resulting DTM was compared with the recent reference digital ground model – DMR ZABAGED®. The conformity of terrain relief forms and elevation accuracy of the DTM derived from the Second Military Survey <b>hypsometry</b> were also investigated...|$|E
40|$|Techniques such as geomorphometry provide {{important}} contribution to geological mapping, particularly when integrated with field data. In this paper, we used <b>hypsometry</b> extracted from digital elevation model derived from the Shuttle Radar Topography Mission (SRTM) aiming to distinguish the Barreiras Formation (Miocene) from the Post-Barreiras Sediments (late Quaternary) in {{the central part of}} Paraíba Basin, northeastern Brazil. The processing included automatic extraction of watershed boundaries. The polygons were superimposed with the geological map in order to select seven watershed samples representative of the studied units. Thus, a layer with elevation data, which is the basic data input for the hypsometric integral (Hi), was obtained for each basin. This information was extracted from cumulative frequency distribution, with altitudes based on a third degree polynomial. The observed patterns are directly associated with the absolute age of the geological unit. Hence, convex curves and high Hi values in the Post-Barreiras Sediments reflect low influence of erosional processes, which is consistent with the late Quaternary age of these deposits, while the generally straight curves and low Hi values of the Barreiras Formation are related to its longer depositional time. Therefore, <b>hypsometry</b> might be an important morphometric variable to be explored aiming to distinguish the Barreiras Formation from the Post-Barreiras Sediments in northeastern Brazil.

It is currently believed that the volume {{response time}} is given approximately by the ratio of glacier thickness to ablation at the glacier terminus. The authors propose a new conceptual model of glacier <b>hypsometry</b> (area-altitude relation) and derive the volume response time where climatic and topographic parameters are separated. The former is expressed by mass balance gradients which they derive from glacier-climate modelling and the latter are quantified [...] ...|$|E
40|$|The {{interaction}} between tectonism and erosion produces rugged landscapes in actively deforming regions. In the northwestern Himalaya, {{the form of}} the landscape was found to be largely independent of exhumation rates, but regional trends in mean and modal elevations, <b>hypsometry</b> (frequency distribution of altitude), and slope distributions were correlated with the extent of glaciation. These observations imply that in mountain belts that intersect the snowline, glacial and periglacial processes place an upper limit on altitude, relief, and the development of topography irrespective of the rate of tectonic processes operating...|$|E
40|$|The ancient landscapes {{south of}} the Great Escarpment in {{southern}} Africa preserve large-scale geomorphological features despite their antiquity. This study applies and evaluates morphometric indices (such as <b>hypsometry,</b> long profile analysis, stream gradient index, and linear/areal catchment characteristics) to the Gouritz catchment, a large discordant catchment in the Western Cape. Spatial variation of morphometric indices were assessed across catchment (trunk rivers) and subcatchment scales. The hypsometric curve of the catchment is sinusoidal, {{and a range of}} curve profiles are evident at subcatchment scale. Hypsometric integrals do not correlate to catchment properties such as area, circularity, relief, and dissection; and stream length gradients do not follow expected patterns, with the highest values seen in the mid-catchment areas. Rock type variation is interpreted to be the key control on morphometric indices within the Gouritz catchment, especially <b>hypsometry</b> and stream length gradient. External controls, such as tectonics and climate, were likely diminished because of the long duration of catchment development in this location. While morphometric indices can be a useful procedure in the evaluation of landscape evolution, this study shows that care must be taken in the application of morphometric indices to constrain tectonic or climatic variation in ancient landscapes because of inherited tectonic structures and signal shredding. More widely, we consider that ancient landscapes offer a valuable insight into long-term environmental change, but refinements to geomorphometric approaches are needed...|$|E
40|$|Inland lakes are {{important}} water resources in arid and semiarid regions. Understanding climate effects on these lakes {{is critical to}} accurately evaluate the dynamic changes of water resources. This study focused on the changes in Sayram Lake of Xinjiang, China, and addressed the effects of climate fluctuations on the inland lake based on long-term sequenced remote sensing images and meteorological data from the past 40 years. A geographic information system (GIS) method was used to obtain the <b>hypsometry</b> of the basin area of Sayram Lake, and estimation methods for evaporation from rising temperature and water levels from increasing precipitation were proposed. Results showed that: (1) Areal values of Sayram Lake have increased over the past 40 years. (2) Both temperature and precipitation have increased with average increases of more than 1. 8 degrees C and 82 mm, respectively. Variation of the water levels in the lake was consistent with local climate changes, and the areal values show linear relationships with local temperature and precipitation data. (3) According to the <b>hypsometry</b> data of the basin area, the estimated lake water levels increased by 2. 8 m, and the water volume increased by 12. 9 x 10 (8) m(3) over the past 40 years. The increasing area of Sayram Lake correlated with local and regional climatic changes because it is hardly affected by human activities...|$|E
40|$|International audienceMany {{continental}} growth {{models have}} been proposed {{over the years to}} explain geological and geochemical data. Amongst these data, the evolution of the Sr- 87 /Sr- 86 of marine carbonates has been used as an argument in favour of delayed continental growth models and of a Neoarchean pulse in continental growth. This interpretation requires that continental freeboard and continental <b>hypsometry</b> have remained constant throughout Earth's history. However, recent studies suggest that Archean sea levels were higher, and Archean relief lower, than present-day ones. To assess the validity of the evolution of the Sr- 87 /Sr- 86 of marine carbonates as a proxy for continental growth, we have developed a model that evaluates the co-evolution of mantle temperature, continental <b>hypsometry,</b> sea level, ridge depth, emerged area of continental crust and the Sr- 87 /Sr- 86 of ocean water as a function of continental growth. We show that Archean sea levels were between similar to 500 m and similar to 1800 m higher than present-day ones, that Archean mid-oceanic ridges were between similar to 700 m and similar to 1900 m shallower than present-day ones, and that the Archean emerged land area was less than similar to 4 % of Earth's area. Importantly, the evolution of the area of emerged land, contrary to that of sea level and ridge depth, barely depends on continental growth models. This suggests that the evolution of surface geochemical proxies for felsic lithologies does not constrain continental growth. In particular, the evolution of the Sr- 87 /Sr- 86 of ocean water predicted for an early continental growth model is in broad agreement with the Sr- 87 /Sr- 86 data on marine carbonates when changes in continental freeboard and continental <b>hypsometry</b> are taken into account. We propose that the Neoarchean shift in the Sr- 87 /Sr- 86 of marine carbonates recorded the emergence of the continents rather than a pulse in continental growth. Since the evolution of other geochemical indicators for felsic crust used as proxies for continental growth is equally well explained by continental emergence, we suggest that there could be no need for delayed continental growth models...|$|E
