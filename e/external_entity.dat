He urged people to directly discover the underlying causes of the problems facing individuals and society, and stated that such discovery is the natural outcome of absolute and unconditional psychological freedom, which he declared as being within everyone's reach.|$|E
500|$|The Satanic Bible is a {{collection}} of essays, observations, and rituals published by Anton LaVey in 1969. It is the central religious text of LaVeyan Satanism, and is considered the foundation of its philosophy and dogma. It has been described as the most important document to influence contemporary Satanism. Though The Satanic Bible is not considered to be sacred scripture {{in the way that the}} Christian Bible is to Christianity, LaVeyan Satanists regard it as an authoritative text as it is a contemporary text that has attained for them scriptural status. It extols the virtues of exploring one's own nature and instincts. Believers have been described as [...] "atheistic Satanists" [...] because they believe that God is not an <b>external</b> <b>entity,</b> but rather something that each person creates as a projection of his or her own personality—a benevolent and stabilizing force in his or her life. There have been thirty printings of The Satanic Bible, through which it has sold over a million copies.|$|E

"Bernard Dukore {{develops}} a triadic theory in Didi, Gogo and the absent Godot, based on Sigmund Freud's trinitarian {{description of the}} psyche in The Ego and the Id (1923) and the usage of onomastic techniques.

2500|$|LaVey {{believed}} that the ideal Satanist should be individualistic and non-conformist, rejecting {{what he called the}} [...] "colorless existence" [...] that mainstream society sought to impose on those living within it. He praised the human ego for encouraging an individual's pride, self-respect, and self-realization and accordingly believed in satisfying the ego's desires. He expressed the view that self-indulgence was a desirable trait, and that hate and aggression were not wrong or undesirable emotions but that they were necessary and advantageous for survival. Accordingly, he praised the Seven Deadly Sins as virtues which were beneficial for the individual.

The dynamicity of homecare systems, caused by <b>external</b> <b>entities</b> like care-receivers and care-givers, can be addressed through combining distributed and heterogenous services both in design and runtime. In general, several research fields such as dynamic service composition, context-aware service composition and dynamic configuration contribute to provide solutions to handle the dynamicity. However, the dynamicity requirements and constrains in homecare domain demands its own solutions. In this paper, we explain our understanding of a homecare provisioning platform and its <b>external</b> <b>entities</b> which interact with the platform. Based on our application scenario and literature study, we identify different types of changes which are imposed by the <b>external</b> <b>entities.</b> Moreover, the characteristics of the <b>external</b> <b>entities,</b> which need to be taken into account to address the dynamicity, are discussed. Then, we study the existing dynamic service composition approaches to see their feasibility for the homecare domain. Finally, we explain our motivation for choosing a hybrid service composition approach as our basis for the homecare provisioning platform with respect to the identified changes and characteristics coming from the <b>external</b> <b>entities...</b>|$|R
