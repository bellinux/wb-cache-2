5|$|Bent {{completed}} a transfer to Charlton Athletic on 1 June 2005, which was worth an initial fee of £2.5million, {{but would have}} risen to £3million <b>if</b> <b>he</b> <b>made</b> an agreed number of appearances for Charlton and for England. On {{the opening day of}} the 2005–06 Premier League season, Bent scored two goals on his Charlton debut against Sunderland, and was named Premier League Player of the Month for August. He scored in his first four appearances for the club, one of only six players to perform this feat in the Premier League. Bent was the highest scoring Englishman in the Premier League in 2005–06, with 18 goals (22 overall), which made him third highest scorer and was given Charlton's Player of the Year award. He signed an extension to his contract at Charlton in July, which contracted him until June 2010. Bent finished 2006–07 with 13 goals in the Premier League, again finishing as Charlton's top goalscorer, but was unable to prevent them from being relegated into the Championship after seven successive seasons of Premier League football. Charlton accepted a bid from West Ham United for him in June 2007, but Bent was not interested in a move to Upton Park.|$|E
5|$|With Charlton {{approaching}} his 30th birthday, he {{was called}} up by Alf Ramsey to play for England against Scotland at Wembley on 10 April 1965. The game ended 2–2 despite England being forced to end the game with nine men after picking up two injuries; he assisted his brother Bobby for England's first goal. Ramsey later said that he picked Charlton to play alongside Bobby Moore as he was a conservative player able to provide cover to the more skilful Moore, who could get caught out <b>if</b> <b>he</b> <b>made</b> a rare mistake. The defence remained relatively constant in the build up to the 1966 FIFA World Cup: Gordon Banks (goalkeeper), Ray Wilson (left-back), Charlton and Moore (centre-backs), and George Cohen (right-back). After playing in a 1–0 win over Hungary the following month, Charlton joined England for a tour of Europe as they drew 1–1 with Yugoslavia and beat West Germany 1–0 and Sweden 2–1. He played in a 0–0 draw with Wales and a 2–1 win over Northern Ireland to help England win the British Home Championship, though sandwiched between these two games was a 3–2 defeat to Austria – the first of only two occasions {{he was on the}} losing side in an England shirt. He played all nine England games in 1965, the final one being a 2–0 win over Spain at the Santiago Bernabéu Stadium.|$|E

5|$|In the 2017 Rogers Cup, held in Montreal, Nadal had {{a chance}} to regain the ATP No. 1 ranking <b>if</b> <b>he</b> <b>made</b> the semi-finals; however, he lost in the 3rd round to Canadian {{teenager}} Denis Shapovalov. Federer progressed to the final, where he lost to Alexander Zverev and sustained an injury during the second set. Due to the renewed back injury, Federer then pulled out of the 2017 Cincinnati Masters, leaving Nadal as the only Big Four player competing there and allowing him to reclaim the ATP No. 1 ranking. In the 2017 Cincinnati Masters, Nadal was knocked out by Nick Kyrgios in the quarter-finals, breaking the streak of 42 consecutive Big Four appearances in Masters 1000 semi-finals and finals. At the US Open, Nadal was be seeded first (for the first time at a major since 2014), Murray second, and Federer, who is only 5 points behind Murray, third. The 2017 US Open would also be the first major Djokovic has missed after a streak of 51 consecutive appearances. Furthermore, Murray ultimately pulled out of the US Open, having not recovered from his hip injury suffered during Wimbledon, leaving just Nadal and Federer as the only Big Four players remaining in the draw. With this withdrawal, Murray would fall out of the top 2 {{for the first time since}} May 2016. Nadal made the semi-finals, while Federer lost in the quarter-finals to Juan Martin del Potro. This loss ended Federer's undefeated record in Grand Slam matches during 2017, and also marked the sixth time that both Federer and Nadal came within one match of meeting each other at the US Open, but did not do so due to one of them losing. This phenomenon previously occurred at the semi-finals of all US Opens between 2008 and 2011, and in the fourth round of the 2013 tournament. Nadal then defeated Del Potro to reach his first US Open final since 2013, and defeated Kevin Anderson in the final to win his third US Open title.|$|E

On his return, the lending merchant must give him a receipt for what was handed over to him. Any false entry or claim on the agent's part was penalised threefold; on the lending merchant's part, sixfold. In normal cases, profits were divided according to contract, usually equally.|$|E

25|$|Nasir al-Dawla {{had reason}} to be {{confident}} that he could defeat Mu'izz al-Dawla <b>if</b> <b>he</b> <b>made</b> an attempt to capture Baghdad. His army had been bolstered {{by the arrival of}} numerous Turkish soldiers who had fled from Baghdad just before Mu'izz al-Dawla's entrance into the capital, and he was much more familiar with the territory between Mosul and Baghdad than his rival was. Mu'izz al-Dawla, on the other hand, was on less secure ground; Baghdad was in a sorry state thanks to years of mismanagement and he was hamstrung by its numerous financial and military problems. Nasir al-Dawla furthermore gained a pretext for war when in January 946 Mu'izz al-Dawla deposed and blinded the caliph al-Mustakfi and replaced him with the more obedient al-Muti'. As a result of these factors, Nasir al-Dawla took a belligerent tone with the Buyids; he withheld the payment of tribute to Baghdad, refused to recognize al-Muti' as caliph and continued to mint coins in al-Mustakfi's name.|$|E
25|$|These {{desultory}} persecutions culminated {{with the}} reign of Diocletian and Galerius {{at the end of}} the third century and the beginning of the 4th century. The Great Persecution is considered the largest. Beginning with a series of four edicts banning Christian practices and ordering the imprisonment of Christian clergy, the persecution intensified until all Christians in the empire were commanded to sacrifice to the Roman gods or face immediate execution. Over 20,000 Christians are thought to have died during Diocletian's reign. One of the most prominent martyrs during the Diocletian persecution was Saint George, a Roman soldier who loudly renounced the Emperor's edict, and in front of his fellow soldiers and tribunes claimed to be a Christian by declaring his worship of Jesus Christ. Diocletian attempted to convert George, even offering gifts of land, money and slaves <b>if</b> <b>he</b> <b>made</b> a sacrifice to the Roman gods; he made many offers, but George never accepted any of them and was subsequently tortured and decapitated. Though Diocletian zealously persecuted Christians in the Eastern part of the empire, his co-emperors in the West did not follow the edicts so Christians in Gaul, Spain, and Britannia were virtually unmolested.|$|E
25|$|Ray Lindwall {{returned}} to Test bowling by dismissing Len Hutton {{with a beautiful}} swinging ball which moved from middle stump to flick {{the edge of his}} bat and was caught by Colin McCool at first slip. Bill Edrich joined Cyril Washbrook and together they took the score to 147/1 {{by the end of the}} second day, Edrich hit 10 fours in his 85 while Washbrook struck only 1 four in his 54. Resuming in the morning Lindwall (2/62) had Erich lbw for 89, much to his disappointment as like McCool he had been promised £1 a run <b>if</b> <b>he</b> <b>made</b> a century. Edrich had now made the highest score in the last three England innings (71, 119 and 89) and had returned the best figures in the last two Australian innings (3/79 and 3/50) and looked good for a big score. When he {{returned to}} the England dressing room he complained that he had hit the ball into his pads and should not have been out. This was overheard by an English pressman and was widely reported, becoming a major point of contention, especially as Denis Compton out lbw to Ernie Toshack when padding up of a ball that landed outside the stumps, causing the Middlesex player to stare at Umpire Scott in disbelief before his walked off. Wally Hammond came on and, annoyed at the two dismissals, gave a simple caught-and-bowled to Bruce Dooland, who then caught and bowled Cyril Washbrook for 62 and England had collapsed from 155/1 to 179/5. Jack Ikin (48) and Norman Yardley (61) dug in for two over hours and restored the innings with a stand of 113 until McCool (2/53) bowled the vice-captain and Dooland (4/69) removed Ikin and Voce with successive balls. With England 298/8 there was still a chance that they could overtake Australia for the first time in the series. Godfrey Evans made 17 and added 26 with Alec Bedser who swung the bat for 27 not out making 27 runs for the last wicket with Wright until the spinner was bowled by Johnson and England were out for 351, 14 runs behind.|$|E
