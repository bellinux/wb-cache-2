The new genus Elongatocystis was decribed, and the new combination Elongatocystis ecballocystiformis was proposed. The phylogenetic position of Oocystidium sp., and Quadricoccus ellipticus within the family was shown. The SSU rRNA phylogeny of Oocystaceae recovered a need for further studies to display the generic and species concept in this monophyletic group of green algae.

40|$|Itroductions of non-endemic fishes into <b>inland</b> <b>waters</b> in <b>Africa</b> are {{discussed}} with special reference to {{their influence on}} African fisheries. Fish introductions have been made for various reasons : introduction of fastgrowing fishies for fishculture, introduction of predatory fishes to control fish production in ponds, improvement of sport fisheries, control of unwanted organisms e. g. aquatic weeds, snails, mosquitoes, to fill apparently empty ecological niches in natural or artificial water bodies [...] . Many introduced species have created major problems in African water bodies [...] . The most serious problem relate {{to the influence of}} introduced fishes on native fish stocks.

In general, the "successful" introductions have increased fish yields, but these increases have often been in association with an expansion of fishing effort and the improvment of fishing gea...|$|R

40|$|The {{upward trend}} of various {{greenhouse}} gas (GHG) {{concentrations in the}} atmosphere since {{the outset of the}} Industrial Era (ca. 1750) is becoming unequivocally linked to anthropogenic-driven disruption of source-sink interactions binding the major carbon (C) reservoirs within the over-arching Earth System (atmosphere, ocean, land, lithosphere). It is imperative we develop a comprehensive understanding of the natural cycling of elements within each of these reservoirs, and quantitatively constrain the exchange fluxes between them, in order to drive informed land management decisions in the future. <b>Inland</b> <b>waters</b> are one component in this regard which have traditionally received less attention, yet we now recognise <b>inland</b> <b>waters</b> not only transport significant quantities of terrestrial subsidies to the coastal zone, but their typically heterotrophic nature drives carbon dioxide (CO 2) (and other GHG) evasion across the water-air interface, influencing global atmospheric chemistry. Further constraining the role of rivers systems will require the gathering of additional datasets over adequate spatial and temporal scales, especially for regions currently under-represented in the prevailing database, with Africa regarded as providing the highest degree of uncertainty at the global scale. The research here presents local and regional findings from <b>inland</b> <b>waters</b> of Madagascar and Kenya, for which little or no literature data are available characterising their source contributions, in-situ biogeochemical cycling or transport flux dynamics. Sampling regimes included basin-wide campaigns across variable hydrological conditions in each of the Betsiboka and Rianila river basins of Madagascar and the Athi-Galana-Sabaki (A-G-S) river basin of Kenya, as well as high frequency monitoring for two years in the latter. These datasets are often compiled with others from poorly represented <b>inland</b> <b>waters</b> of <b>Africa</b> to demonstrate variability at the regional scale, as well as providing first estimates to the age of riverine C fractions at the global scale. Traditionally, a lack of appropriate proxies has hampered the ability to distinguish riverine organic C (OC) sources at the landscape scale, though the dissection of C 4 grasslands by C 3 -enriched riparian vegetation in the Betsiboka basin provided a unique setting to assess the relative contribution of riparian and more distant landscapes to riverine C pools. The C 3 -rich Rianila basin afforded comparative analysis between C 3 and C 4 dominated river basins. Comparing delta 13 C ratios of bulk sub-basin vegetation (delta 13 CVEG) with those of riverine OC pools, results indicate riverine OC is disproportionately composed of C 3 -derived OM, irrespective of climatic season, even though delta 13 CVEG estimates suggest C 4 biomass accounts for up to 96 % of land cover in some Betsiboka sub-basins. Given the typically low rates of autotrophic production in Malagasy <b>inland</b> <b>waters,</b> and hence the dominance of terrestrial OM subsidies in riverine OC pools, the hydrological disconnection of the more remote C 4 grasslands (relative to the bordering C 3 -enriched riparian fringe) is considered the primary driver of the under-representation of C 4 -derived OM within riverine OC pools in the Betsiboka basin, and our results suggest caution when interpolating paleo-environmental conditions, such as C 3 and C 4 distribution, from the delta 13 C signatures stored in fluvial-derived sediment deposits. Despite the potential of D 14 C signatures to elucidate sources and cycling of different riverine C pools, no comprehensive attempts to synthesize the available information and examine global patterns in the 14 C content of different riverine C pools had been performed. Data from the three river basins comprising the primary focus of the research here in combination with the basins listed above provide ~ 100 new D 14 C measurements of OC transported by <b>inland</b> <b>waters</b> of <b>Africa.</b> Results indicate African riverine dissolved OC (DOC) is typically of modern C 3 origin, whereas the age of particulate OC (POC) was far more variable, reaching ~ 4200 yr BP with a mean and median age of ~ 250 and 80 % of the total load for TSM (~ 86 %), POC (~ 89 %), DOC (~ 81 %), PN (~ 89 %) and TPP (~ 82 %). Our estimated sediment yield of 85 Mg km- 2 yr- 1 remains low on the global scale, while sediment and OC yields were all ~ 2 - to 5 -fold greater than reported yields for the neighbouring and flow regulated Tana River. Rapid pulses of heavily 13 C enriched POC during dry season coincide with peak concentrations of PN, ammonium and CH 4, and suggest bulk inputs of degradable C 4 OM. We argue that large mammalian herbivores might mediate the delivery of C 4 OM to the river. These first estimates of material fluxes from the Sabaki River provide base-line data for future research initiatives assessing the ongoing anthropogenic perturbation of the A-G-S river basin.
