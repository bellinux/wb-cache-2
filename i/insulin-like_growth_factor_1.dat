5|$|Hormonal activity, such as {{occurs during}} menstrual cycles and puberty, may {{contribute}} to the formation of acne. During puberty, an increase in sex hormones called androgens causes the skin follicle glands to grow larger and make more oily sebum. Several hormones have been linked to acne, including the androgens testosterone, dihydrotestosterone (DHT), and dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA); high levels of growth hormone (GH) and <b>insulin-like</b> <b>growth</b> <b>factor</b> <b>1</b> (IGF-1) have also been associated with worsened acne. Both androgens and IGF-1 seem to be essential for acne to occur, as acne does not develop in individuals with complete androgen insensitivity syndrome (CAIS) or Laron syndrome (insensitivity to GH, resulting in very low IGF-1 levels).|$|E
5|$|Growth hormone {{deficiency}} {{is almost}} certain if all other pituitary tests are also abnormal, and <b>insulin-like</b> <b>growth</b> <b>factor</b> <b>1</b> (IGF-1) levels are decreased. If {{this is not the}} case, IGF-1 levels are poorly predictive of the presence of GH deficiency; stimulation testing with the insulin tolerance test is then required. This is performed by administering insulin to lower the blood sugar to a level below 2.2mmol/l. Once this occurs, growth hormone levels are measured. If they are low despite the stimulatory effect of the low blood sugars, growth hormone deficiency is confirmed. The test is not without risks, especially in those prone to seizures or are known to have heart disease, and causes the unpleasant symptoms of hypoglycemia. Alternative tests (such as the growth hormone releasing hormone stimulation test) are less useful, although a stimulation test with arginine may be used for diagnosis, especially in situations where an insulin tolerance test is thought to be too dangerous. If GH deficiency is suspected, and all other pituitary hormones are normal, two different stimulation tests are needed for confirmation.|$|E

40|$|OBJECTIVE: Our {{purpose was}} to {{evaluate}} which <b>factors</b> regulate <b>insulin-like</b> <b>growth</b> factor-I and <b>insulin-like</b> <b>growth</b> <b>factor</b> binding protein- <b>1</b> concentrations in preterm fetuses. STUDY DESIGN: We studied 76 singleton births between 25 and 36 weeks of gestation. Forty-nine pregnancies were complicated by hypertensive disease; 24 pregnancies were complicated by preterm labor or preterm rupture of membranes; and antenatal glucocorticoids were given in 49 pregnancies. Pathology reports showed infarct(s) or hematoma(s) in 31 of 69 placentas. We recorded blood gas values in umbilical artery and vein and measured glucose, C-peptide, and <b>insulin-like</b> <b>growth</b> factor-I and <b>insulin-like</b> <b>growth</b> <b>factor</b> binding protein- <b>1</b> concentrations in umbilical vein. RESULTS: Birth weight correlated with umbilical vein <b>insulin-like</b> <b>growth</b> factor-I (r = 0. 68, P 25 th percentile. Two-factor analysis of variance showed that umbilical vein <b>insulin-like</b> <b>growth</b> factor-I was determined by gestational age (P =. 0004) and birth weight percentile (P <. 0001), whereas <b>insulin-like</b> <b>growth</b> <b>factor</b> binding protein- <b>1</b> was not affected by gestational age. Umbilical vein C-peptide was highly correlated with <b>insulin-like</b> <b>growth</b> <b>factor</b> binding protein- <b>1</b> (r = - 0. 55, P <. 0001), but not <b>insulin-like</b> <b>growth</b> factor-I, levels. Blood gas values in umbilical artery and vein, particularly umbilical artery PO (2), were correlated with umbilical vein <b>insulin-like</b> <b>growth</b> factor-I and <b>insulin-like</b> <b>growth</b> <b>factor</b> binding protein- <b>1</b> (r = 0. 51 and - 0. 48, respectively; P <. 0001); changes in <b>insulin-like</b> <b>growth</b> factor-I and <b>insulin-like</b> <b>growth</b> <b>factor</b> binding protein- <b>1</b> occurred at umbilical artery PO (2) < 14. 8 mm Hg. Multiple regression analysis showed that umbilical vein <b>insulin-like</b> <b>growth</b> factor-I was predicted by umbilical artery PO (2), gestational age, {{and the presence of}} placental infarcts/hematomas (R (2) of model = 0. 58, P <. 0001), and umbilical vein <b>insulin-like</b> <b>growth</b> <b>factor</b> binding protein- <b>1</b> by umbilical vein C-peptide, umbilical artery PO (2), and placental infarcts/hematomas (R (2) = 0. 49, P <. 0001). CONCLUSION: In the preterm fetus, circulating <b>insulin-like</b> <b>growth</b> factor-I is related to gestational age and the in utero <b>growth</b> potential, whereas <b>insulin-like</b> <b>growth</b> <b>factor</b> binding protein- <b>1</b> is related only to the in utero growth potential.

40|$|OBJECTIVE: Our {{purpose was}} to {{determine}} the effects of labor and fetal hypoxia on the levels of <b>insulin-like</b> <b>growth</b> <b>factor</b> binding protein- <b>1</b> in the maternal and fetal circulation. STUDY DESIGN: Serum levels of <b>insulin-like</b> <b>growth</b> <b>factor</b> binding protein- <b>1</b> were determined in maternal and umbilical blood at delivery in two groups. The first group included 43 vaginal deliveries and 23 elective cesarean sections. The second group consisted of 44 women; in 24 the liquor was meconium stained and in 20 it was clear. RESULTS: Levels of <b>insulin-like</b> <b>growth</b> <b>factor</b> binding protein- <b>1</b> in the neonate were lower in deliveries occurring before onset of labor (p < 0. 001), Mann-Whitney U test) and higher in cases with severe meconium staining (p = 0. 01).

Samples included all gestational ages in the third trimester and a large range of birth weights. RESULTS: Cord serum <b>insulin-like</b> <b>growth</b> factor-I concentrations increased until 39 weeks (+ 84 % from 28 to 29 weeks), followed by a 21 % decline at 41 weeks. <b>Insulin-like</b> <b>growth</b> factor-I levels were decreased by 40 % in small-for-gestational-age (90 th percentile) newborns in the absence of diabetes. <b>Insulin-like</b> <b>growth</b> factor-I levels were best correlated with birth weight (R = 0. 48, p < 0. 001). Cord serum <b>insulin-like</b> <b>growth</b> factor-II concentrations were sixfold to tenfold higher than those of <b>insulin-like</b> <b>growth</b> factor-I and were 8 % to 10 % (p < 0. 001) higher in large-for-gestational-age than in average-weight and small-for-gestational-age newborns.

30|$|Breast cancer-associated macrophages express {{high levels}} of <b>insulin-like</b> <b>growth</b> <b>factors</b> <b>1</b> and 2 (IGFs) and are {{the main source of}} IGFs within both primary and metastatic tumors [73].

In addition, blockade of IGF in combination with paclitaxel showed a significant increase in chemosensitivity of tumor compared to paclitaxel monotherapy [73]. TAMs and its supernatants significantly prevent breast tumor cells from apoptosis caused by paclitaxel and the high level of IL- 10 secreted by TAMs was responsible for drug resistance of breast cancer [75]. The possible TAMs-modulated drug resistance mechanism involved may be associated with elevation of bcl- 2 gene expression and up-regulation of STAT 3 signaling in tumor cells, forming IL- 10 /STAT 3 /bcl- 2 signaling axis accounting for chemoresistance of breast cancer [75].|$|R
30|$|The {{peptides}} <b>insulin-like</b> <b>growth</b> <b>factors</b> <b>1</b> and 2 (IGF 1 / 2) are structurally homologous to insulin, {{and they}} participate in serum glucose metabolism. IGF 2 overexpression in neoplasms causes non-islet cell tumor hypoglycemia (NICTH). SFT is also known to be frequently associated with NICTH, owing to excessive IGF 2 production [4, 5]. The paraneoplastic syndrome of hypoglycemia due to IGF 2 hyper-secretion by pleural SFT is more commonly known as “Doege-Potter syndrome” [6, 7]. As a receptor ligand, IGF 2 binds to IGF 1 receptor (IGF 1 R), IGF 2 receptor (IGF 2 R), and insulin receptor (IR) [8].
