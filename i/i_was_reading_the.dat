I just thought once you poof'd, you poof'd! I thought that was it. So when they threw it out to me that I was coming back... They didn't tell me they were bringing her back to life. They just sent me the script for the season finale for season one of Angel, when they rose me from the dead. <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>reading</b> <b>the</b> script, and half way through, Darla still hadn't shown up. Benz went on to add, I was like, 'Alright...' I get three quarters of the way through and I think, 'Maybe they sent me the wrong script...?' And then I get to the last page, and I was like, 'Oh my god! I can't believe this! This is so cool!' At that time I'd been committed to another project too. We didn't even know if I was going to be available or not. But it all ended up working out.|$|E
500|$|... "The Arrival" [...] {{was written}} by co-creator J.J. Abrams and {{executive}} producer Jeff Pinkner. Paul A. Edwards directed the episode, his second of the season. Early in the series, actress Jasika Nicole feared her character {{was going to become}} liked by the audience only to suddenly die. She explained that [...] "When <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>reading</b> <b>the</b> script in the episode where Dr. Bishop stabs her in the neck with the sedative … and all [...] says is, 'Dr. Bishop grabs Astrid from behind and jams the needle into her neck.' Then it fades to black. My mouth hung open for awhile and I was like, 'Oh my God, I only made it through six episodes." ...|$|E
500|$|Ellie Kendrick, who portrays Meera Reed, {{spoke about}} {{the writing of the}} episode {{following}} its airing, and revealed that she was surprised by the scene, saying [...] "When <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>reading</b> <b>the</b> episode, I completely forgot that I was a character in the show. I was reading it with such excitement, because this is a real story unfolding, with so many mysteries and quantum leaps and Inception-style traveling between the past and the present. I found it very exciting. So the first time I read it, I was just reading it for enjoyment, really, because it was so well-written and exciting. Once I picked my jaw up off the floor, I was really keen to get started working on it, because it's such an epic sequence." ...|$|E

2500|$|Also at Cannes, McKellen {{was quoted}} as saying [...] "While <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>reading</b> <b>the</b> book I {{believed}} it entirely. Clever Dan Brown twisted my mind convincingly. But when I put it down I thought, 'What a load of [...] potential codswallop." [...] During a May 17, 2006 interview on The Today Show with the Da Vinci Code cast and director, Matt Lauer posed a question to the group about how they would have felt if the film had borne a prominent disclaimer that it is a work of fiction, as some religious groups wanted. (Some high-ranking Vatican cabinet members had called for a boycott of the film.) McKellen responded, [...] "I've often thought the Bible should have a disclaimer in the front saying 'This is fiction.' I mean, walking on water? It takes[...] [...] an act of faith. And I have faith in this movie—not that it's true, not that it's factual, but that it's a jolly good story." [...] He continued, [...] "And I think audiences are clever enough and bright enough to separate out fact and fiction, and discuss the thing when they've seen it." ...|$|E

"In a {{magazine}} <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>reading</b> <b>the</b> other day," [...] he continued, [...] "I was interested {{to observe that}} the modern idea as regards marriage is a changed one. A woman, they say, should not marry until she is twenty-seven or twenty-eight--a very excellent idea. I think we agree, do we not, on that, Esther?" ...|$|E
5000|$|Mawhood {{then sent}} a letter to Colonel Hand, warning him that if the militia did not put down their arms, he would [...] "attack the militia wearing arms, burn their houses, and reduce them, their unfortunate wives, and their {{children}} to beggary and distress." [...] Hand eloquently rejected the threat, writing that [...] "your threat to burn and destroy, induces me to imagine that <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>reading</b> <b>the</b> orders of a barbarous Attila, and not of a gentleman, brave, generous, and polished." ...|$|R

Well it may, by this time; and no blame to my father who built it, neither! <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>reading</b> <b>the</b> old Colonel's tombstone, no longer ago than last Sabbath; and, reckoning from that date, the house has stood seven-and-thirty years. No wonder if {{there should be a}} job to do on the roof." ...|$|E
60|$|The next duty to be accomplished, {{now that}} the answer had been received, was to acquaint Miss Fairlie with Sir Percival's explanation. Miss Halcombe had {{undertaken}} to do this, and had left the room {{to go to her}} sister, when she suddenly returned again, and sat down by the easy-chair in which <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>reading</b> <b>the</b> newspaper. Sir Percival had gone out a minute before to look at the stables, and no one was in the room but ourselves.|$|E
6000|$|The {{convention}} {{has not yet}} died out. <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>reading</b> <b>the</b> {{other day}} a most interesting book by a brilliant American authoress. Seeing I live {{far away from the}} lady's haunts, I venture to mention names. I am speaking of [...] "Patience Sparhawk," [...] by Gertrude Atherton. I take this book because it is typical of a large body of fiction. Miss Sparhawk lives a troubled life: it puzzles her. She asks herself what is wrong. Her own idea is that it is civilisation.|$|E

60|$|P.S. The oddest trio of coincidences {{yesterday}} afternoon. <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>reading</b> <b>the</b> delightful Letters of that peculiarly Suffolk genius (of Woodbridge) Edward FitzGerald ("Omar Khayyam") and, {{just finishing}} {{a story in}} one of them about his relations with a boatman of Saxmundham (a name--seen for the first time--that struck me--by its strangeness and handsomeness,) laid down the book and went a long walk--five miles along this coast, to where, in a very picturesque and lonely spot, I met a sea-faring man with whom I fraternised.|$|E
6000|$|... "'I {{have said}} that the house is a {{rambling}} one. One day last week--on Thursday night, to be more exact--I found that I could not sleep, having foolishly taken a cup of strong café noir after my dinner. After struggling against it until two in the morning, I felt that it was quite hopeless, so I rose and lit the candle with the intention of continuing a novel which <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>reading.</b> <b>The</b> book, however, had been left in the billiard-room, so I pulled on my dressing-gown and started off to get it.|$|E

Page one hundred and fifty-six as follows:--'I stood like one Thunderstruck, or as if I had seen an Apparition.' If that isn't as much as to say: 'Expect the sudden appearance of Mr. Franklin Blake'--there's no meaning in the English language!"

6000|$|... 'Oh yes,' said Elizabeth, {{speaking}} slowly, and pausing now and then; 'I {{remember her}} well; I sometimes fancy I {{can hear her}} voice and her step at night, when she used {{to come up to}} the nursery to see us in bed. I always used to listen for her; and when she began to grow weak, and could not come up so many stairs, I used to lie and cry for half an hour. And now, when <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>reading</b> <b>the</b> same books with the children that I read with her, things that she said to me come back upon me.' ...|$|R

They daren't really do anything to you, you know. Face it out." [...] And even while I was muttering, <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>reading</b> <b>the</b> words cut into a worn tombstone at my feet: [...] "Jenetta Parker"--only two-and-twenty, a year older than I.

6000|$|The {{next morning}} I sent for a hair-dresser.

[...] You will suppose that the brusquerie, as well as the purport of this interrogatory, occasioned some surprise. How he knew I was an American at all I am unable to say, but the fellow had been fidgeting the whole time to break out upon me with this question.|$|E
60|$|Those things I remember, {{but what}} <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>reading</b> <b>the</b> day before my writing life began I have forgotten. I {{have only a}} vague notion {{that it might have}} been one of Trollope's {{political}} novels. And I remember, too, the character of the day. It was an autumn day with an opaline atmosphere, a veiled, semi-opaque, lustrous day, with fiery points and flashes of red sunlight on the roofs and windows opposite, while the trees of the square with all their leaves gone were like tracings of indian ink on a sheet of tissue paper. It was one of those London days that have the charm of mysterious amenity, of fascinating softness. The effect of opaline mist was often repeated at Bessborough Gardens on account of the nearness to the river.|$|E
60|$|When <b>I</b> <b>was</b> younger, <b>reading</b> <b>the</b> popular novel {{used to make}} me sad. I find it vexes others also. <b>I</b> <b>was</b> {{talking to}} a bright young girl upon the subject not so very long ago.|$|R

I get so nervous when----Mr. Ericson, I'm very proud to think that one of our Joralemon boys should have done so well.

The poor wretch was brought before a magistrate, charged with breaking a window. His one last chance of escaping starvation in the streets was to get sent to prison. The magistrate questioned him, and brought to light a really heart-breaking account of misfortune, imbittered by neglect {{on the part of}} people in authority who were bound to help him. He was remanded, so that inquiries might be made. I attended the court on the day when he appeared there again, and heard his statement confirmed. I paid his fine, and contrived to put him in a way of earning a little money. He was very grateful, and came now and then to thank me. In that way I heard how his troubles had begun. He had asked for a small advance on the wretched wages that he received. Can you guess how the schoolmistress answered him?" ...|$|E
60|$|He {{soon came}} back {{to say that there}} were none (at which I was much surprised) and began to lay the cloth for my dinner in a box by the fire. While he was so engaged, he asked me what I would take with it; and on my {{replying}} 'Half a pint of sherry,'thought it a favourable opportunity, I am afraid, to extract that measure of wine from the stale leavings at the bottoms of several small decanters. I am of this opinion, because, while <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>reading</b> <b>the</b> newspaper, I observed him behind a low wooden partition, which was his private apartment, very busy pouring out of a number of those vessels into one, like a chemist and druggist making up a prescription. When the wine came, too, I thought it flat; and it certainly had more English crumbs in it, than were to be expected in a foreign wine in anything like a pure state, but I was bashful enough to drink it, and say nothing.|$|E
