The work {{described in this}} paper evaluates, characterizes, and demonstrates miniaturized H 2 production in a stand-alone ammonia-fuelled microchannel reformer. The performance of the microchannel reformer is investigated {{as a function of}} reaction temperature (450 – 700 °C) and gas-hourly-space-velocity (6520 – 32, 600 Nml gcat− 1 h− 1). The reformer operated in a daily start-up and shut-down (DSS) -like mode for a total 750 h comprising of 125 cycles, all to mimic frequent intermittent operation envisaged for fuel cell systems. The reformer exhibited remarkable operation demonstrating 98. 7 % NH 3 conversion at 32, 600 Nml gcat− 1 h− 1 and 700 °C to generate an estimated fuel cell power output of 5. 7 We and power density of 16 kWe L− 1 (based on effective reactor volume).

40|$|Hydrogen {{production}} from an ammonia-fuelled microchannel reactor is simulated in a three-dimensional (3 D) model implemented via Comsol Multiphysics™. The work {{described in this}} paper endeavours to obtain a mathematical framework that provides an understanding of reaction-coupled transport phenomena within the microchannel reactor. The transport processes and reactor performance are elucidated in terms of velocity, temperature, and species concentration distributions, {{as well as local}} reaction rate and NH 3 conversion profiles. The baseline case is first investigated to comprehend the behaviour of the microchannel reactor, then microstructural design and operating parameters are methodically altered around the baseline conditions to explore the optimum values. The simulation results show that an optimum NH 3 space velocity (GHSV) of 65, 000 Nml gcat− 1 h− 1 yields 99. 1 % NH 3 conversion and a power density of 32 kWe L− 1 at the highest operating temperature of 973 K. It is also shown that a 40 -μm-thick porous washcoat is most desirable at these optimum conditions. Finally, a low channel hydraulic diameter (225 μm) is observed to contribute to high NH 3 conversion. Mass transport limitations in the porous-washcoat and gas-phase are negligible as depicted by the Damköhler and Fourier numbers, respectively. The experimental microchannel reactor yields 98. 2 % NH 3 conversion and a power density of 30. 8 kWe L− 1 when tested at the optimum operating conditions established by the model. Good agreement with experimental data is observed, so the integrated experimental-modelling approach developed in this paper may well provide an incisive step toward the efficient design of ammonia-fuelled microchannel reformersHydrogen <b>Infrastructure</b> <b>Centre</b> of Competence, Department of Science and Technology of the Republic of South Africa (Grant numbers; KP 4 -I 05 and IFR 13022017531), and the North-West University[URL]...|$|E

Večina pasem ovc je sezonsko poliestričnih, kar pomeni, da se parijo le v določenem obdobju leta. Trajanje in začetek tega pa uravnava več mehanizmov, od katerih je najbolj pomembna fotoperioda oziroma dolžina dnevne svetlobe. Ovce spremembe dolžine dneva in noči zaznavajo preko hipotalamusa, ki uravnava izločanje hormona melatonina iz epifize. Pomembna dejavnika, ki pripomoreta k uravnavanju sezonskih reprodukcijskih ciklusov sta tudi temperatura zraka in padavine, predvsem v tropskem podnebju. Začetek pubertet je prav tako odvisen od več med seboj povezanih dejavnikov, kot so sezona rojstva, velikosti gnezda in pasma, pa tudi prehrana in posledično rejno stanje. Raziskave reprodukcijske aktivnosti slovenskih avtohtonih pasem ovc so bile izvedene na Centru za sonaravno rekultiviranje Vremščice Veterinarske fakultete UL. Rezultati raziskav so bili opisani v številnih znanstvenih publikacijah, ki sem jih uporabila kot vir {{literature}} za nalogo. V nalogi bom opisala, pri kateri starosti se pri ovcah teh pasem pojavi puberteta, v katerem obdobju leta se pojavi sezonska reprodukcijska aktivnost in koliko časa traja ter kakšen je potek in trajanje pojatvenega ciklusa. This paper aims {{to study}} the seasonal reproductive activity mechanisms of sheep and explore what are the reproductive characteristics of Slovenian indigenous sheep breeds: the Jezersko-Solčava sheep, the Bovec sheep and the Istrian pramenka sheep. The majority of sheep breeds are polyoestrous meaning they only mate in a certain time frame of the year. The beginning and {{the duration of the}} mating seasons are regulated by several mechanisms, the most important being the photoperiod or day length. Sheep sense the change in the day length via their hypothalamus that regulates the secretion of the hormone melatonin from the pineal gland. Other important factors in the regulation of seasonal reproductive cycles are also air temperature and precipitation, especially in a tropical environment. The start of sexual maturity also depends on several interconnected factors such as birth season, herd size and breed, as well as nutrition and breeding environment. The research on the reproductive activity of Slovenian indigenous sheep breeds was carried out at the <b>Infrastructure</b> <b>Centre</b> for Sustainable Recultivation (ICSR) Vremščica of the Ljubljana University Veterinary Faculty.

40|$|It is a {{critical}} time for India to prioritize nutrition in its health and development agendas. While dismal nutrition indicators persist, and the country‘s levels of hunger are considered ―alarming‖ on an international index, India is expected to miss the Millennium Development Goals targeting hunger and undernutrition. Without a targeted, multi-sectoral approach to nutrition, India is still struggling to deliver evidence-based interventions during the most important windows of opportunity. At the same time, the National Rural Health Mission (NRHM) and its Accredited Social Health Activists (ASHA) are gaining ground in delivering critical, community-based health services for women, children, and families. The current period of service delivery innovation and quality improvement presents an important opportunity to better integrate nutrition into health, and to push nutrition programming reform in the country. Recognizing this critical opportunity for nutrition programming innovation and integration in India, this report will examine the following research question: How can a nutrition strategy be better integrated into health programming? In pursuing this question, the paper intends to explore mechanisms for better integration in health planning at national, state, and district levels, and strengthened operational integration between frontline health workers and their supervisory structures. It will also examine how current nutrition efforts, namely Integrated Childhood Development Services (ICDS), can be more functional and thereby be better integrated into {{maternal and child health}} services. This report draws largely upon field visits throughout the country, and a field survey conducted in Chhattisgarh, Bihar, Uttar Pradesh, and Rajasthan with anganwadi workers (AWW), Accredited Social Health Activists (ASHA), and young mothers. Our findings from the field highlight strong needs for nutrition-focused outreach to families, and more structured collaboration between health and nutrition initiatives at community, block, district, state, and national levels. With these findings, we recommend actions to be taken within policy, human resources, and operations: We argue that India requires nutrition leadership at national, state, district, and community levels. A concrete, proactive national nutrition policy is needed to unite fragmented nutrition initiatives, hold relevant departments to nutrition outcomes, and drive nutrition programming in high-focus districts. A similar push has already been initiated by the Department of Women and Child Development. We recommend that states reinforce this commitment to nutrition by creating inter-ministerial councils to emphasize political will towards state nutrition policy and planning. We strongly recommend the creation of a community advocate for nutrition, termed an Accredited Nutrition Activist in this paper, to assume outreach operations from the anganwadi centre. This role would serve as {{a critical}} point person for community-based nutrition and an intermediary between the anganwadi worker and ASHA. This role would also seek to close critical gaps in nutrition, particularly infant feeding. We advocate mechanisms for improved targeting of nutrition interventions, particularly infant feeding. Targeting the most critical beneficiaries includes focusing on the age group under 24 months (e. g. the 1000 -day window of opportunity between pre-pregnancy and two years), and high-risk families through improved outreach operations. Targeting also involves innovative approaches to delivering interventions most effectively (e. g. demonstration-education for families, home-based action), and capturing beneficiaries at critical moments for nutrition counselling and support (e. g. when a child is sick, newborn feeding and care post-delivery). We reiterate calls for an overhaul of ICDS operations, particularly in anganwadi worker supervision, training and support, food supply and distribution, <b>infrastructure,</b> <b>centre</b> timings, oversight, and data management and use for action. The recommendations presented in this paper will also be piloted within the Earth Institute/MOHFW Model District project in Assam, and in due course we will be reporting back on our findings...|$|E
40|$|Generation {{of power}} from fossil fuels {{produces}} large amounts of carbon dioxide which is {{a major contributor to}} global warming and many other environmental problems. Alternative sources of energy are available but fossil fuels remain the main source of energy for on-board energy generation. One alternative source that has gained great popularity {{in recent years has been}} hydrogen. The characteristics which it possesses make it an ideal alternative to fossil fuels for on-board energy generation and also for stationary (portable) power applications. Widespread use of hydrogen as an energy carrier can only be realised once a reliable storage method which is safe and affordable becomes available. Such a storage medium should have sufficient hydrogen storage capacity, fast kinetics, and be capable of delivering hydrogen gas to a fuel cell at ambient or near-ambient conditions. This study investigated the storage of hydrogen using metal-organic frameworks (MOFs). MOFs are a class of porous inorganic-organic crystalline materials that store hydrogen by adsorption. What makes MOFs such an attractive option for hydrogen storage is that they have exceptionally high surface areas and porosity, as well as tunable pore sizes and internal surfaces. MOFs have provided successful hydrogen storage at cryogenic temperatures (77 K) and a major challenge is to reach high storage capacities at ambient temperatures and acceptable pressures. The HySA <b>Infrastructure</b> <b>Centre</b> of Competence (CoC), one of three centres of competence established by the Department of Science and Technology (DST) to implement the National Hydrogen and Fuel Cells Strategy, is tasked with R&D on hydrogen generation, storage and distribution. A major part of the hydrogen storage R&D is the development of MOFs for hydrogen storage with the ultimate aim of using the developed MOFs for practical applications, including fuel cell vehicles and portable power applications, using metals that promote the beneficiation of South African mineral resources. The MOFs that were investigated in this study are zinc-based MOF (Zn-MOF, MOF- 5), zirconium-based MOF (Zr-MOF, UiO- 66) and chromium-based MOF (Cr-MOF, MIL- 101). These MOFs were chosen because they were envisaged as potential hydrogen storage options. MOF- 5 in particular was seen as an ideal starting point for this study as it has been reported to have high surface area, permanent porosity, good thermal stability and a high synthetic yield. In addition, MOF- 5 is amongst the most widely investigated MOFs for hydrogen storage. In this study, MOF- 5 with high crystallinity and good morphology was synthesised using either N,N-diethylformamide (DEF) or dimethylformamide (DMF) as solvent. As DMF is a cheaper solvent than DEF the synthesis conditions were optimised for the DMF-synthesised MOF- 5 and detailed analyses performed. It was discovered at some point that MOF- 69 c was produced as a product instead of MOF- 5. Successful transition from MOF- 69 c to MOF- 5 was achieved by employing a simple heat treatment. Due to the moisture sensitivity of MOF- 5 which results from the weak interaction of Zn metal with O atoms in the framework, MOF- 5 and other MOFs with different metal centres were synthesised in an attempt to overcome the moisture sensitivity problem. This led to the investigation of Zr-MOF (UiO- 66) as it had the best results and had been reported to be moisture stable. Zr-MOF was synthesised using a solvothermal synthesis procedure and a microwave-assisted synthesis approach. The solvothermal synthesis was optimised using formic acid as a modulator and the microwave-assisted synthesis provided a rapid synthesis technique. The optimised synthesis produced octahedral-shaped Zr-MOF crystals of high crystallinity, with excellent moisture and thermal stability. As the synthesis of MOF- 5 and Zr-MOF employed DMF, an environmentally harsh solvent, the need to pursue a greener MOF synthesis led to the investigation of Cr-MOF (MIL- 101). A successful modulated synthesis of Cr-MOF using formic acid instead of HF as modulator, and water as the reaction solvent was achieved. The synthesised MOFs were characterised and their hydrogen adsorption capacity measured at 77 K and at pressures up to 1 bar. It was found that MOF- 5 had a maximum hydrogen uptake of 1. 60 wt% (DEF-synthesised MOF- 5) and 1. 40 wt% (DMF-synthesised MOF- 5) whilst MOF- 69 c had a maximum uptake of 1. 90 wt%. Zr-MOF had a maximum hydrogen uptake of 1. 50 wt% and a maximum hydrogen uptake of 1. 92 wt% was achieved for the Cr-MOF. Hydrogen uptake was found to be related to the quality of the MOF crystals and also directly related to the surface area, pore volume and/or pore size of the particular MOF.
