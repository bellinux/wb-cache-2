She began by insisting that they not call her [...] "Mrs. Dallas." [...] and that they use the title [...] "councilman," [...] not [...] "councilwoman," [...] since that was how it was written in the city charter. [...] "In private life, I'm Mrs. George Dallas," [...] she told a reporter shortly after the election, [...] "but in public life I'm Constance H. Dallas. <b>I</b> <b>object</b> to the use of Mrs." ...|$|E
500|$|Tunis' next novel, Go Team Go, set in 1954, {{returns to}} Indiana basketball. Again a coach risks {{the support of}} fans by cutting players, {{including}} the team star. The hero, Tom Williams, comes to see that his coach was right, and gets his father's respect – and the girl – by helping the new team move forward. Buddy and the Old Pro is a 1955 novel about Pop Warner football. Tunis disliked organized sports for young children, saying [...] "I've always believed Little League is harmful to the extreme. It's for the parents, and that's what <b>I</b> <b>object</b> to... I don't {{like the idea of}} having little boys playing in front of their parents and friends. Little boys should be playing their sports by themselves." [...] In what Michelle Nolan in Ball Tales calls a [...] "remarkable book", Tunis uses his only non-Dodgers baseball novel to emphasize a favorite theme when the young protagonist admits to his father [...] "it's better to lose, much as it hurts, than to play dirty".|$|E

2500|$|On the {{following}} morning, the clerk of the Crown went through formality of asking if Mitchel {{had anything to}} say why sentence should not be passed upon him. Mitchel said: [...] "I {{have to say that}} I have been found guilty by a packed jury—by the jury of a partisan sheriff—by a jury not empanelled even according to the law of England. That is the reason <b>I</b> <b>object</b> to the sentence being passed upon me." ...|$|E

Connell, Esq.):- We shall take your objection if you state it in writing. A protest was then entered by Mr. Payne and those who voted for Viscount Lowther; and Sir A.W. Clifford was declared duly elected." ...|$|E
2500|$|There are {{two things}} to which I am devoted: {{absolute}} academic and spiritual freedom, and the subordination {{of the state to}} the interests of the individual; expressed in other forms, the furthering of conditions in which the individual can develop to the best of his ability—as far as it is possible with a full understanding of the fetters imposed upon us by tradition; and the fight against all forms of power policy of states or private organizations. This means a devotion to principles of true democracy. <b>I</b> <b>object</b> to teaching of slogans intended to befog the mind, of whatever kind they may be.

2500|$|Dickens {{is often}} {{described}} as using idealised characters and highly sentimental scenes to contrast with his caricatures and the ugly social truths he reveals. The story of Nell Trent in The Old Curiosity Shop (1841) was received as extraordinarily moving by contemporary readers but viewed as ludicrously sentimental by Oscar Wilde. [...] "You would need to have a heart of stone", he declared in one of his famous witticisms, [...] "not to laugh at the death of little Nell." [...] G. K. Chesterton, stated: [...] "It is not the death of little Nell, but the life of little Nell, that <b>I</b> <b>object</b> to", arguing that the maudlin effect of his description of her life owed much to the gregarious nature of Dickens's grief, his [...] "despotic" [...] use of people's feelings to move them to tears in works like this.|$|E
2500|$|Early {{theories}} {{concerning the}} nature of the lowest-mass stars and the hydrogen-burning limit suggested that a population <b>I</b> <b>object</b> with a mass less than 0.07 solar masses (...) or a population II object less than [...] would never go through normal stellar evolution and would become a completely degenerate star. The first self-consistent calculation of the hydrogen-burning minimum mass confirmed a value between 0.08 and 0.07 solar masses for population I objects. The discovery of deuterium burning down to 0.012solar masses and the impact of dust formation in the cool outer atmospheres of brown dwarfs in the late 1980s brought these theories into question. However, such objects were hard to find as they emit almost no visible light. Their strongest emissions are in the infrared (IR) spectrum, and ground-based IR detectors were too imprecise at that time to readily identify any brown dwarfs.|$|E
2500|$|In many respects, Orville Hungerford, {{known for}} his honesty and industriousness, epitomized the self-made man of the nineteenth century. [...] Decades after his death, a {{journalist}} aptly stated that [...] " [...] had rare financial talents, and was a first-class business man." [...] In politics, he learned the ultimate lesson: rectitude will kill a career trying to serve the people. He was unafraid of voicing his opinion though. On February 21, 1846, the U.S. House of Representatives deliberated whether to break for two days in honor of George Washington's birthday. A voice demurred. Representative William L. Yancey, the Southern secessionist and duelist, was so enraged that he shouted out for the dissenter to make himself known. Hungerford retorted: [...] "I show my face, and <b>I</b> <b>object.</b> Are you satisfied?" [...] Alas, as time has gone by, Hungerford's achievements have faded along with the pages of old history books.|$|E
