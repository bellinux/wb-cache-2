However, this range fell short of that originally promised in the R&D stage and was not generally wide enough, to be useful for creating the kind of broad washes of soft-edged light, normally expected by users from this class of luminaire. The liquid lens fell further out of favour, after some users obtained the MSDS for the gel being used in the lens and expressed concerns at its potential toxicity. Following this, many VL5 Arcs were rented out without the liquid lens, using instead the same, fixed-focus range of lenses designed for the original VL5.|$|E

ChapmanThis thesis {{outlines}} {{the development of}} a centrifugal compressor model for the Turbocharger Component Matching System (TuCMS) software package {{that can be used to}} inexpensively analyze turbocharger performance. The TuCMS can also be used to match turbocharger components to integrate and optimize turbocharger-engine performance. The software system is being developed with the intent to reduce the time taken to experimentally match a turbocharger with an engine, a task that is key to engine emission reductions. The TuCMS uses one-dimensional thermo-fluid equations to analyze the compressor side of a turbocharger. For each compressor component, the program calculates the velocities, pressures, temperatures, pressure losses, work consumption, and efficiencies for a specified set of turbocharger geometry, atmospheric conditions, rotational speed, and fluid mass flow rate. The compressor includes established loss models found in the open literature. The TuCMS utilizes a component-based architecture to simplify model enhancements. The TuCMS can be used as a cost effective engineering tool for preliminary turbocharger testing during engine upgrades and modifications. In this thesis, the TuCMS compressor model was used as an analysis tool to further understand the Variable Geometry Turbocharger (VGT) experimental results. The VGT is a unique turbocharger that can change the <b>diffuser</b> <b>vane</b> angle over a wide range of positions. The change in <b>diffuser</b> <b>vane</b> angle results in optimal turbocharger performance at various operating conditions, and potentially increases the operating range. The purpose for the use of the TuCMS compressor model analysis is to identify the change in performance as the <b>diffuser</b> <b>vane</b> angles are adjusted.

40|$|This {{research}} program focuses on characterizing {{the effect of}} impeller-diffuser interactions in a centrifugal compressor stage on its performance using unsteady threedimensional Reynolds-averaged Navier-Stokes simulations. The computed {{results show that the}} interaction between the downstream diffuser pressure field and the impeller tip clearance flow can account for performance changes in the impeller. The magnitude of performance change due to this interaction was examined for an impeller with varying tip clearance followed by a vaned or vaneless diffuser. The impact of unsteady impeller-diffuser interaction, primarily through the impeller tip clearance flow, is reflected through a time-averaged change in impeller loss, blockage and slip. The results show that there exists a tip clearance where the beneficial effect of the impeller-diffuser interaction on the impeller performance is at a maximum. A flow feature that consists of tip flow back leakage was shown to occur at design speed for the centrifugal compressor stage. This flow phenomenon is described as tip flow that originates in one passage, flows downstream of the impeller trailing edge and then returns to upstream of the impeller trailing edge of a neighboring passage. Such a flow feature is a source of loss in the impeller. A hypothesis is put forth to show that changing the <b>diffuser</b> <b>vane</b> count and changing impeller-diffuser gap has an analogous effect on the impeller performance. The centrifugal compressor stage was analyzed using <b>diffusers</b> of different <b>vane</b> counts, producing an impeller performance trend similar to that when the impeller-diffuser gap was varied, thus supporting the hypothesis made. This has the implication that the effect impeller performance associated with changing the impeller-diffuser gap and changing <b>diffuser</b> <b>vane</b> count can be described by the non-dimensional ratio of impeller-diffuser gap to <b>diffuser</b> <b>vane</b> pitch.

40|$|Abstract. It {{is quite}} {{well known that}} the {{diffusers}} are required for efficient conversion of the dynamic head generated by the impeller in a centrifugal fan. Hence the flow into the diffuser passage {{plays a crucial role}} in determining the efficiency of conversion. The flow in the region bounded by the impeller exit and the diffuser entry i. e. the radial clearance space is generally considered to be highly complex. With the development of PIV as well as versatile numerical CFD tools such as moving mesh techniques, it has become possible to arrive at a prudent solution compatible with the physical nature of the flow. Hence, in this work a numerical solution with moving mesh technique is made use of in predicting the real flow behavior, as exhibited when a target blade of the impeller is made to move past a target blade on the diffuser. Many research works both experimental and numerical on the impeller diffuser interactive phenomenon have been undertaken so far. But it is found from the literature that the study on the impeller diffuser interaction as well on the performance of the fan by varying the number of <b>diffuser</b> <b>vanes</b> has not been the focus of attention in these works. Hence a numerical analysis has been carried out in this work to extensively explore impeller-diffuser fluid interaction as well as to predict the flow characteristics of the fan by changing the number of <b>diffuser</b> <b>vanes</b> while keeping the number of impeller blades same. It is found from the analysis that there is an optimum number of <b>diffuser</b> <b>vanes</b> which would yield maximum static pressure recovery and when the <b>diffuser</b> <b>vanes</b> are increased beyon...|$|E

The vane pressure fluctuations were larger on the vane suction than on the vane pressure side attaining their maximum value, of the same order of magnitude as the total pressure rise across the pump, near the leading edge. The resulting lift on the vane, both steady and unsteady, was computed from the pressure measurements at mid vane height.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} the work aiming for tonal noise reduction in a centrifugal fan. In previous studies, {{it is well}} documented that tonal noise is the dominant noise source generated in centrifugal fans. Tonal noise is generated due to the aerodynamic interaction between the rotating impeller and stationary <b>diffuser</b> <b>vanes.</b> The generation of tonal noise {{is related to the}} pressure fluctuation at {{the leading edge of the}} stationary vane. The tonal noise is periodic in time which occurs at the blade passing frequency (BPF) and its harmonics. Much of previous studies, have shown that the stationary vane causes the tonal noise and generation of non-rotational turbulent noise. However, omitting stationary vanes will lead to the increase of non-rotational turbulent noise resulted from the high velocity of the flow leaving the impeller. Hence in order to reduce the tonal noise and the non-rotational noise, guide vanes were designed as part of this study to replace the <b>diffuser</b> <b>vanes,</b> which were originally used in the chosen centrifugal fan. The leading edge of the guide vane is tapered. This modification reduces the strength of pressure fluctuation resulting from the interaction between the impeller outflow and stationary vane. The sound pressure level at blade passing frequency (BPF) is reduced by 6. 8 dB, the 2 nd BPF is reduced by 4. 1 dB and the 3 rd BPF reduced by about 17. 5 dB. The overall reduction was 0. 9 dB. The centrifugal fan with tapered guide vanes radiates lower tonal noise compared to the existing <b>diffuser</b> <b>vanes.</b> These reductions are achieved without compromising the performance of the centrifugal fan.

A compressor designer’s wish is to have one single stage unit design with good performance that can cover a wide rang of applications and a wide range of mass flow rates. This means a stage whose impeller and diffuser chocking areas can be varied, which is not impossible but difficult. Currently there are five main ways of dealing with this: 1.
