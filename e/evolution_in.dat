5|$|Because of {{the paucity}} of {{surviving}} attributed works, {{it is difficult to}} detect any <b>evolution</b> <b>in</b> Lochner's style. Art historians are unsure if his style became progressively more or less influenced by Netherlandish art. Recent dendrochronological examination of attributed works indicate that his development was not linear, suggesting that the more advanced Presentation in the Temple is of 1445, predating the more Gothic Saints panels now divided between London and Cologne.|$|E
5|$|Brachiopods are shelled {{marine organisms}} that superficially resembled {{bivalves}} {{in that they}} are of similar size and have a hinged shell in two parts. However, brachiopods evolved from a very different ancestral line, and the resemblance to bivalves only arose because of a similar lifestyle. The {{differences between the two groups}} are due to their separate ancestral origins. Different initial structures have been adapted to solve the same problems, a case of convergent <b>evolution.</b> <b>In</b> modern times, brachiopods are not as common as bivalves.|$|E

5|$|Columbia University's Jesup Lectures {{were the}} {{starting}} point for many of the most important works of the modern evolutionary synthesis. The presenters introduced the connection between two important discoveriesthe units of evolution (genes) with selection as the primary mechanism of <b>evolution.</b> <b>In</b> 1941, Edgar Anderson (whose work on hybridization in the genus Iris had interested Stebbins since they met in 1930) and Ernst Mayr co-presented the lecture series and Mayr later published his lectures as Systematics and the Origin of Species. In 1946, Stebbins was invited on Dobzhansky's recommendation to present the prestigious lectures. Stebbins' lectures drew together the otherwise disparate fields of genetics, ecology, systematics, cytology, and paleontology. In 1950, these lectures were published as Variation and <b>Evolution</b> <b>in</b> Plants, which proved {{to be one of the}} most important books in 20th-century botany. The book brought botanical science into the new synthesis of evolutionary theory, and became part of the canon of biological works written between 1936 and 1950 that formed the modern synthesis of evolution.|$|E
5|$|Convergent <b>evolution</b> <b>in</b> humans {{includes}} blue {{eye colour}} and light skin colour. When humans migrated out of Africa, {{they moved to}} more northern latitudes with less intense sunlight. It was beneficial to them to reduce their skin pigmentation. It appears certain {{that there was some}} lightening of skin colour before European and East Asian lineages diverged, as there are some skin-lightening genetic differences that are common to both groups. However, after the lineages diverged and became genetically isolated, the skin of both groups lightened more, and that additional lightening was due to different genetic changes.|$|E
