40|$|Thailandan outward-oriented {{regional}} production <b>hubis</b> one of East Asia's {{most active}} users {{of free trade}} agreements (FTAs) {{as an instrument of}} commercial policy. By December 2009, Thailand had 11 concluded FTAs, and more were either under negotiation or proposed. Thai trade negotiators have striven to secure market access via FTAs, but little is known on how FTAs actually affect exporting firms. A survey of 221 exporters in leading sectors forms the basis for the first systematic study of the business impact of FTAs in Thailand. Key findings are as follows : (i) 24. 9 % of respondents used Thai FTAs as of 20072008, and this figure seems set to rise; (ii) 45. 9 % of respondents said that FTAs had influenced their business plans; (iii) 26. 2 % of firms felt that dealing with multiple rules of origin adds to business costs, and this is estimated to be less than 1 % of export sales; (iv) more than half the sample firms have consulted with government and business associations on FTAs; and (v) a significant demand existed for business development services to adjust to FTAs, particularly for small and medium enterprises (SMEs). The findings suggest that Thailand should refine its FTA strategy to take better advantage of regional trade agreements. The study concludes with specific recommendations to improve business awareness of FTAs, encourage greater utilization of FTA preferences, increase competitiveness of local firms, and mitigate the potential effect of multiple rules of origin.

40|$|In 2006, Vetenskapsrådet [the Swedish Research Council] granted fundingfor the  {{development}} of three Swedish Centres of Gender Excellence;the recipients were Uppsala University, Umeå University and the interuniversityInstitute for Thematic Gender Studies between the Universitiesof Linköping and Örebro. As a result, with the Institute of ThematicGender Studies as its base, GEXcel: Gendering Excellence – Centre ofGender Excellence {{was launched in}} 2007. GEXcel is a five-year collegium-like excellence centre for Advanced Gender Studies. Its principal <b>hubis</b> a Visiting Fellowship Programme, where international researchers areinvited to join any of twelve different research themes. From the outset, a long-term aim of GEXcel has been to develop a permanent Swedish-based collegium for advanced gender studies that will be launched after GEXcel’s five-year term. Clearly, existing international excellence centres and institutes for advanced study, such as Harvard’s Radcliffe Institute, Stanford’s Michelle Clayman Institute, Berlin’s Wissenschaftskolleg and Uppsala’s Swedish Collegium for Advanced Study can provide important clues about how to organise a permanent advanced gender studies collegium. Nevertheless, it will not suffice to simply adopt an existing organisational model; not only does a  Swedishbased gender studies collegium have to be developed to fit its Nordic and European context, but {{it is essential that}} it is organised in ways that suit the special requirements of gender studies, and so that it retains the crucial insights of feminist scholarship. In order {{to pave the way for}} the opportunity to realise the long-term goal of developing a permanent, Swedish-based gender studies collegium, GEXcel has implemented a cross-cutting research theme dedicated to matters of academic organisation: Organizing a European Excellence Centre – Exploring Models. The ultimate aim of this theme is to provide a forum to explore what academic excellence may mean from a feminist point of view, and what would be required of an organisational structure to support and stimulate excellent gender studies research. The following Work in Progress Report contains initial steps towards a feminist analysis of models of and for excellence: here, a largely descriptive overview of  available ways of organising excellence is provided, and significant organisational differences and similarities are identified and assessed. Björn Pernrud’s paper A Review of Distinguished Research Clusters is based on an overview of collegium-like research institutions  nternationally, concentrating especially on gender studies centres and institutes, and providing brief descriptions of about 60 centres. The paper also considers the academic, political and economic motives underlying  efforts to organise research into large-scale centres. Finally, three centres are examined more closely in order to provide a more detailed picture ofdifferent models for organising large research milieus. While Pernrud’s paper concentrates on the internal organisation and structure of research centres and institutes, Sanne Bor explores how collaborative relations can be established between research institutions. In a paper entitled Some Reflections on Choices in Developing Collaborative Networks, Bor identifies and analyses five especially important points where significant choices have to be made as collaborative relations are established. Accordingly, Bor puts forward a number of questions that anyone seeking to initiate a network has to take into consideration, and she discusses how different answers to these questions lead to different forms of networks. Together, Pernrud’s paper provides a basis for beginning to compare and analyse ways of organising a permanent collegium for advanced gender studies in Sweden, and Bor’s paper contains insights into the conditions and possibilities for such a successor to GEXcel to enter into productive relations with other gender studies centres around the world. This volume is published in the hope that it will contribute to the further institutional {{development of}} gender studies in Sweden and beyond.

40|$|Low- and {{high-resolution}} {{spectra of}} the planetary nebulae HuDo 1 and <b>HuBi</b> 1, around [WC-late] stars, are analyzed. The objects {{belong to the}} galactic disk, with heliocentric radial velocities of - 12 km/s (HuDo 1) and 57 km/s (<b>HuBi</b> 1). C(Hbeta) reddening values are of 2. 04 for HuDo 1 and 1. 22 for <b>HuBi</b> 1. Plasma line ratios are used to estimate physical conditions and abundances. We find log (O/H) + 12 = 8. 43 and 8. 57, and N/O = 0. 2 and 0. 1 for HuDo 1 and <b>HuBi</b> 1 respectively. <b>HuBi</b> 1 is the only PN excited by a very late [WC] star showing intense nebular HeI recombination lines. From the stellar lines we derive a [WC 10] type for both stars, although <b>HuBi</b> 1 central star should be slightly hotter for providing {{a large amount of}} He^ 0 ionizing photons. Nebular and stellar parameters of HuDo 1 and <b>HuBi</b> 1 are compared with those of other [WC 10] objects, concluding that the stars of HuDo 1 and <b>HuBi</b> 1 should be intrinsically fainter. In particular <b>HuBi</b> 1 seems a low-density evolved nebula around a low-mass slowly-evolving star. Comment: 11 pages, 8 figures, accepted in Revista Mexicana de Astronomia y Astrofisic...|$|R

The second tells of {{how to make the}} "house" for the 'huru dombe' curse-prohibition. The first recording tells mostlyt about 'huru bote hate':, which is severe stomach ache, spreading from the livcer to the chest. She uses a machete, touching the lower parts from east and down five times. Then ashes ('awu') and adat comb (<b>hubi),</b> touching the same way [...] Then 'si'i' (grass) and 'seku' (kencur root), then 'wetho wa'i', five times each the same way. After this ritual, she chews the material with sirih pinang and lime (always lime, if not mentioned with sirih pinang). Later she also mentions tobacco as ingredient, applied after the other herbs. Different fromJustina Nona's (Poro) 'ngiru huru dombe', Methi's 'huru dombe' uses 'dombe' root, kencur (similar to ginger), tobacco, 'moro' and 'wetho wa'i'.
