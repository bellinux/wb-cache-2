5|$|Several ice ages {{shaped the}} land through glacial erosion, {{creating}} u-shaped valleys and <b>depositing</b> boulder clays, {{especially on the}} western seaboard. The last major incursion of ice peaked about 18,000 years ago, leaving other remnant features such at the granite tors on the Cairngorm mountain plateaux.|$|E

5|$|Another use {{concerns}} X-ray optics, especially X-ray telescopes. The mirrors of the Chandra X-ray Observatory are {{coated with}} a layer of iridium 60nm thick. Iridium proved to be the best choice for reflecting X-rays after nickel, gold, and platinum were also tested. The iridium layer, which had to be smooth to within a few atoms, was applied by <b>depositing</b> iridium vapor under high vacuum on a base layer of chromium.|$|E
5|$|Earth {{movements}} {{after the}} Carboniferous period {{resulted in the}} up-doming of the area and, particularly in the west, the folding of the rock strata along north–south axes. The region {{was raised in a}} north–south line which resulted in the dome-like shape and the shales and sandstones were worn away until limestone was exposed. At the end of this period, the Earth's crust sank here which led to the area being covered by sea, <b>depositing</b> a variety of new rocks.|$|E
5|$|Following the {{emplacement}} of late Pliocene lava domes, lesser activity {{continued into}} the Quaternary period (2.58 million years ago to present). Initial volcanism began on {{the summit of the}} volcano, <b>depositing</b> lava in and adjacent to the Level Mountain Range. This activity is indirectly dated as Pleistocene age , on the bases of the presence of subglacial and/or intraglacial deposits. Meszah Peak, the highest point of both Level Mountain and the Level Mountain Range, was volcanically active during this eruptive period.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{examines}} how international depositors respond to national <b>deposit</b> insurance policies. Countries with explicit <b>deposit</b> insurance {{are found to}} be relatively attractive to international non-bank depositors. <b>Deposit</b> schemes characterized by coinsurance, a private administration, and a low <b>deposit</b> insurance premium appear to be particularly favored by these depositors. The sensitivity of non-bank <b>deposits</b> to <b>deposit</b> insurance policies opens up the possibility of international regulatory competition in this area. The EU directive on <b>deposit</b> insurance imposes minimum standards on national <b>deposit</b> insurance policies. This directive, however, is silent on several important features of <b>deposit</b> insurance such as the level of the <b>deposit</b> insurance premium. Hence, it may not preclude regulatory competition in Europe. <b>deposit</b> insurance, international <b>deposit...</b>|$|R
50|$|<b>Deposit</b> risk is {{one type}} of {{liquidity}} risk of a financial institution that is generated by <b>deposits</b> with the defined maturity dates (then such <b>deposits</b> are called time or term <b>deposits)</b> or without the ones (then such <b>deposits</b> are called demand or non-maturity <b>deposits).</b>|$|R
5|$|Intensity of {{precipitation}} is primarily measured for meteorological concerns. However, {{it can be}} of concern to aviation as heavy precipitation can limit visibility. Also, intensity of freezing rain can determine how hazardous it is for pilots to fly nearby certain locations since {{it can be an}} in-flight hazard by <b>depositing</b> ice on the wings of aircraft, which can be detrimental to flight.|$|E
5|$|Rain is {{liquid water}} {{in the form of}} {{droplets}} that have condensed from atmospheric water vapor and then becomes heavy enough to fall under gravity. Rain is a major component of the water cycle and is responsible for <b>depositing</b> most of the fresh water on the Earth. It provides suitable conditions for many types of ecosystems, as well as water for hydroelectric power plants and crop irrigation.|$|E
5|$|Silver treasures, {{common in}} the Scandinavian countries, are found also in Slavic areas {{including}} Poland, especially northern Poland. Silver objects, coins and decorations, often cut into pieces, {{are believed to have}} served as currency units, brought in by Jewish and Arab traders, but locally more as accumulations of wealth and symbols of prestige. The process of hiding or <b>depositing</b> them, besides protecting them from danger, is believed by the researchers to represent a cult ritual.|$|E
50|$|Many {{different}} types of uranium <b>deposits</b> have been discovered and mined.There are mainly three types of uranium <b>deposits</b> including unconformity-type <b>deposits,</b> namely paleoplacer <b>deposits</b> and sandstone-type also known as roll front type <b>deposits.</b>|$|R
50|$|Lamosite <b>deposits</b> are {{the most}} {{abundant}} and largest oil shale <b>deposits</b> beside of marinite <b>deposits.</b> The largest lacustrine-type oil shale <b>deposits</b> are the Green River Formation in western United States, a number <b>deposits</b> in eastern Queensland, Australia, and the New Brunswick Albert Formation and several other <b>deposits</b> in Canada.|$|R
50|$|Many <b>deposits</b> {{need more}} {{exploration}} {{to determine their}} potential as reserves. Well-explored <b>deposits,</b> which could ultimately be classified as reserves, include the Green River <b>deposits</b> in the western United States, the Tertiary <b>deposits</b> in Queensland, Australia, <b>deposits</b> in Sweden and Estonia, the El-Lajjun <b>deposit</b> in Jordan, and <b>deposits</b> in France, Germany, Brazil, China, and Russia. It is expected that these <b>deposits</b> would yield at least 40 L of shale oil per metric ton of shale, using the Fischer Assay.|$|R
5|$|Sperm whales {{increase}} {{levels of}} primary production and carbon export by <b>depositing</b> iron-rich faeces into surface {{waters of the}} Southern Ocean. The iron-rich faeces cause phytoplankton to grow and take up more carbon from the atmosphere. When the phytoplankton dies, it sinks to the deep ocean and takes the atmospheric carbon with it. By reducing the abundance of sperm whales in the Southern Ocean, whaling has resulted in an extra 2 million tonnes of carbon remaining in the atmosphere each year.|$|E
5|$|The {{great spotted cuckoo}} (Clamator glandarius) {{has been}} {{recorded}} as a brood parasite of the western jackdaw, <b>depositing</b> its eggs in their nests in Spain and Israel. Nest robbers include the common raven in Spain, tawny owl, and least weasel (Mustela nivalis) in England, and brown rat (Rattus norvegicus) in Finland. The European pine marten (Martes martes) raids isolated nests in Sweden but is less successful when nests {{are part of a}} colony.|$|E
5|$|Two hazards {{are uniquely}} {{identified}} with the dam. One is that sedimentation projections are not agreed upon, {{and the other is}} that the dam sits on a seismic fault. At current levels, 80% of the land in the area is experiencing erosion, <b>depositing</b> about 40million tons of sediment into the Yangtze annually. Because the flow is slower above the dam, much of this sediment will now settle there instead of flowing downstream, and there will be less sediment downstream.|$|E

5|$|As the CIP allowed licensees {{to import}} goods at half price, it was {{regarded}} as a virtual guarantee of business success, regardless of entrepreneurial skill. As a result, the licenses were highly prized. For those who were not confident in their sales ability, a healthy profit was usually made by selling their license to other willing businessmen, especially as demand far outstripped supply. A 1966 US Government report concluded {{that it was possible to}} guarantee a 100% domestic profit on piasters, and that a 50% profit could be safely achieved by using black market exchange rates and <b>depositing</b> one's money in an American bank.|$|E
5|$|Common ravens {{have been}} {{observed}} calling wolves {{to the site of}} dead animals. The wolves open the carcass, leaving the scraps more accessible to the birds. They watch where other common ravens bury their food and remember the locations of each other's food caches, so they can steal from them. This type of theft occurs so regularly that common ravens will fly extra distances from a food source to find better hiding places for food. They have also been observed pretending to make a cache without actually <b>depositing</b> the food, presumably to confuse onlookers.|$|E
5|$|Continuing {{through the}} Cretaceous period {{and into the}} early Tertiary, there was {{uplifting}} {{in the area of}} the Colorado Plateau, the San Juan Mountains, and the La Plata Mountains, which led to the formation of the Mesa Verde pediment with the help of erosion. Small channels of water ran across this formation <b>depositing</b> gravel. Later in the tertiary, the last period of uplift and rock tilting towards the south caused these streams to cut rapidly into the rock removing loose sediment and forming the vast canyons seen today. This caused the isolation of the Mesa Verde pediment from surrounding rock. Today, since the climate is more arid, these erosional processes are slowed.|$|E

5|$|During the rut, males {{establish}} territories, {{ranging from}} , which they mark by urinating and <b>depositing</b> large piles of dung. Males in neighbouring territories frequently fight {{for access to}} females, which they do by twisting and levering {{at each other with}} their horns, interspersed with stabbing attacks. Females roam the territories of different males. Outside of the rut, mixed-sex herds can range from as few as three to as many as 180 individuals, while all-male bachelor herds are of typically no more than 50 individuals. Harem and nursery herds are much smaller, typically including no more than 10 individuals.|$|E
5|$|Histological {{examination}} {{reveals that}} pachycephalosaurid domes {{are composed of}} a unique form of fibrolamellar bone which contains fibroblasts that {{play a critical role}} in wound healing, and are capable of rapidly <b>depositing</b> bone during remodeling. Peterson et al. (2013) concluded that taken together, the frequency of lesion distribution and the bone structure of frontoparietal domes, lends strong support to the hypothesis that pachycephalosaurids used their unique cranial structures for agonistic behavior. CT scan comparisons of the skulls of Stegoceras validum, Prenocephale prenes, and several head-striking artiodactyls have also supported pachycephalosaurids as being well-equipped for head-butting.|$|E
5|$|It {{is thought}} that the energy {{necessary}} to heat the corona is provided by turbulent motion in the convection zone below the photosphere, and two main mechanisms have been proposed to explain coronal heating. The first is wave heating, in which sound, gravitational or magnetohydrodynamic waves are produced by turbulence in the convection zone. These waves travel upward and dissipate in the corona, <b>depositing</b> their energy in the ambient matter {{in the form of}} heat. The other is magnetic heating, in which magnetic energy is continuously built up by photospheric motion and released through magnetic reconnection in the form of large solar flares and myriad similar but smaller events—nanoflares.|$|E
