25|$|Events <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>next</b> <b>couple</b> {{of years}} {{increased}} the party's popularity. In 1982, Israel returned the Sinai Peninsula to Egypt, {{as part of}} the Egypt–Israel Peace Treaty which involved evacuating Israeli settlers living in the peninsula. There was fierce resistance, particularly in Yamit, the largest settlement, where several extremists had barricaded themselves inside a synagogue and were threatening to commit suicide. Menachem Begin's government asked Kahane to act as an intermediary and convince them to give in.|$|E
25|$|The Whites started {{shooting}} the surrendered Reds right after their capitulation. According to the eyewitnesses, victims were picked randomly amongst the men exiting the factory. They were then {{taken to the}} ice of the nearby Huruslahti Bay and shot. The first to be executed were the Varkaus Red Guard commander Matti Autio {{and the leaders of}} the Leppävirta, Lehtoniemi and Savonlinna guards Kaarlo Lähteenmäki, Adam Krogerus and Emil Parkkinen. <b>In</b> <b>the</b> <b>next</b> <b>couple</b> of hours, up to 80 Red Guard members were shot.|$|E
5000|$|The {{original}} name of {{the club}} was [...] "Avanhard" [...] during its first year of existence. Between 1961-70 the club was called Desna. In 1972 it was replaced with SC Chernihiv (team of the SKA Kiev) that played <b>in</b> Chernihiv for <b>the</b> <b>next</b> <b>couple</b> of years. <b>In</b> 1977 Desna was revived now <b>in</b> place of <b>the</b> amateur club [...] "Khimik Cherhihiv" [...] that won regional competitions.|$|R
50|$|On April 28, Tropical Disturbance 22F {{developed}} {{within a}} trough of low pressure, about 485 km {{to the northeast}} of Port Vila <b>in</b> Vanuatu. Over <b>the</b> <b>next</b> <b>couple</b> of days convection surrounding the system remained poor, as it moved south-eastwards into an area of high vertical windshear.

50|$|<b>In</b> 1899, <b>the</b> Granites {{joined the}} Ontario Rugby Football Union, {{replacing}} the Osgoode Hall {{team that had}} left to join the QRFU. The Granites finished tied for first place with the Ottawa Rough Riders and would challenge them for the ORFU championship game. Kingston came out victorious, winning 8-0, to claim the senior title over Ottawa {{in their first year}} of play. Because teams from both the ORFU and QRFU were unwilling to play a national title game that year, there was no Canadian Dominion Football Championship <b>in</b> 1899. <b>The</b> <b>next</b> <b>couple</b> of years would not be as successful, as the Granites would fall to 3rd place <b>in</b> <b>the</b> ORFU <b>in</b> 1900, and then to last place in 1901.|$|R
25|$|Žalgiris {{became the}} {{dominant}} force in Soviet Union and in Europe when they added new talents to the team: first came Valdemaras Chomičius then Rimas Kurtinaitis and Vladas Garastas became the new team coach. But everything changed {{when the team}} noticed a talented young kid named Arvydas Sabonis, who was 17 years old 209cm and he debuted in the club in 1981. He grew about 12 more cm <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>next</b> <b>couple</b> of years and could do everything on the court: play defense, assist his teammates, shoot 3 pointers and dominate inside the paint.|$|E
25|$|In {{an effort}} to escape, Schenck jumped into the river but his heavy armor weighed him down, and, {{although}} he tried to swim to a nearby vessel, the weight was too great. Most of the soldiers who could not get into a barge either drowned in the river, or were pulled downstream; the few who did not drown were hunted down <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>next</b> <b>couple</b> of days and summarily executed. Schenck's body also was found a few days later; the body was decapitated, his head placed on a pike, and his body quartered. The pieces were exhibited at four gates.|$|E
25|$|As {{part of its}} {{programme}} {{to revive}} after four years {{at the foot of}} the County Championship, Somerset had been looking far and wide for new players, and among the arrivals <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>next</b> <b>couple</b> of seasons were the Australians Colin McCool and Bill Alley, both of whom had been playing Lancashire League cricket. Lawrence went in the other direction: he left Somerset after the 1955 season and took up a contract to be the professional at Haslingden Cricket Club for 1956. Haslingden finished at the bottom of the league that season and Lawrence did not return for the 1957 season.|$|E
5000|$|Richard Spurr died in January 1855 (within 2 {{months of}} the Eureka Stockade) and so never saw true {{democracy}} introduced to England or Australia.

He abandoned his work there abruptly, and spent some time traveling around the Southwest before, settling in San Francisco. He married <b>in</b> 1931. Over <b>the</b> <b>next</b> <b>couple</b> of years, he and his wife spent <b>the</b> summers <b>in</b> Nevada, painting and selling his pictures from a wooden stand. He spent {{the rest of his life}} in Kentfield, California.|$|R
50|$|Text {{messaging}} {{will become}} a key revenue driver for mobile network operators <b>in</b> Africa over <b>the</b> <b>next</b> <b>couple</b> of years. Today, text messaging is already slowly gaining influence <b>in</b> <b>the</b> African market. One such person used text messaging {{to spread the word}} about HIV and AIDS. Also, in September 2009, a multi-country campaign in Africa used text messaging to expose stock-outs of essential medicines at public health facilities and put pressure on governments to address the issue.|$|R
25|$|New coach Jupp Heynckes, {{already at}} his former post in Mönchengladbach {{successor}} of Lattek, {{started with a}} title-free season, after which Matthäus and Andreas Brehme went to Internazionale from where a generous reimbursement was received. Also Pfaff and three more players left. As Olaf Thon and Stefan Reuter were the most prominent newcomers, hopes were not high, but <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>next</b> <b>couple</b> of years two more championships were won. Augenthaler's retirement and the sale of Jürgen Kohler and Stefan Reuter to Juventus badly depleted the squad. Two seasons without any trophies followed, and cost Heynckes his job.|$|E
25|$|High {{variable}} costs mean that Pandora {{does not have}} significant operating leverage, and <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>next</b> <b>couple</b> years might actually have negative operating leverage due to an unfavorable shift in product mix towards mobile. Pandora is currently estimated to monetize mobile hours at roughly one-ninth the rate of desktop hours. Since Pandora pays the same licensing cost per hour irrespective of the user's platform, the net contribution to earnings per mobile hour is even more skewed with respect to contribution to earnings from desktop hours. Mobile revenues will improve over time as Pandora shifts from relying on third-party ad networks to selling ad inventory internally at premium rates.|$|E
25|$|The Legion of Doom would {{challenge}} the Outlaws several times <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>next</b> <b>couple</b> of months {{but could not}} win the gold. On one episode of Raw, the Outlaws shaved the head of Road Warrior Hawk and were beaten down further by DX. On February 23, 1998, on Raw, the Legion of Doom seemed to have won the Tag Team titles back {{when they hit the}} Doomsday Device, but as Animal went for the pin, the referee was distracted by Hawk's celebration, allowing the Outlaws to take advantage and win the match. After the match, the Legion of Doom brawled with one another out of frustration and weren't seen on WWE television after that, indicating that the team was disbanded for good.|$|E
50|$|Canadian {{country as}} {{developed}} by Otto Wilke, Carter, Snow and Earl Heywood, used a less nasal and more distinctly pronounced vocal style than American music, and stuck with more traditional ballads and narratives while American country {{began to use}} more songs about bars and lovers' quarrels. This style of country music became very popular <b>in</b> Canada over <b>the</b> <b>next</b> <b>couple</b> of decades. Later popular Canadian country stars range from Stompin' Tom Connors to Shania Twain to Rick Tippe.|$|R
500|$|For <b>the</b> <b>next</b> {{few weeks}} we got {{twice as many}} {{requests}} for [...] "Another One Rides the Bus" [...] as for everything else put together. Thank goodness I had a tape rolling! We even got it <b>in</b> stereo. Over <b>the</b> <b>next</b> <b>couple</b> of months that tape was duplicated and re-duplicated all over the world, as the song took {{on a life of}} its own. [...] The Dr. Demento Show gained a couple of dozen new station affiliates just because of that song.|$|R
40|$|Current {{efforts to}} define and {{implement}} health data standards are driven by {{issues related to the}} quality, cost and continuity of care, patient safety concerns, and desires to speed clinical research findings to the bedside. The President’s goal for national adoption of electronic medical records <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>next</b> decade, <b>coupled</b> with <b>the</b> current emphasis on translational research, underscore the urgent need for data standards in clinical research. This paper reviews the motivations and requirements for standardized clinical research data, and the current state of standards development and adoption–including gaps and overlaps–in relevant areas. Unresolved issues and informatics challenges related to the adoption of clinical research data and terminology standards are mentioned, as are the collaborations and activities the authors perceive as most likely to address them...|$|R
500|$|On December24, President Lyndon B. Johnson ordered {{federal aid}} for the flooded areas.

500|$|The result {{marked the}} first time that Manchester United had lost in the {{calendar}} year, ending a 33-match unbeaten run. Wenger believed the result showed that Arsenal were [...] "ready for the season", albeit admitting that the defence had trouble coping with Yorke. He thought it was [...] "...psychologically important to beat United, especially after the great run they have had". Wenger confirmed afterwards that Anelka would sign for Real Madrid: [...] "I hope everything will be finalised <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>next</b> <b>couple</b> of days. In any case, he is not coming back here, and although the contract is not signed yet, I hope it will be after his medical and that is the end of it." [...] Kanu, who scored Arsenal's equaliser and set up the match winner, was pleased with his performance and relished the opportunity of establishing himself in the first team, after Anelka's departure.|$|E
500|$|Initially, the Olympic Village was to {{be located}} entirely on the McCormick Place truck yards, but in November 2006, The Michael Reese Hospital site became listed for sale. [...] Planners {{determined}} that the Hospital site would likely have been superior in terms of lower cost and more successful urban planning implementation. In November 2007, Mayor Daley announced a plan to acquire the [...] site, and the following June the hospital decided that it would cease operations. In July 2008 the city announced its official bid for the property: The city planned to borrow $85 million to buy the Michael Reese Hospital campus, near 31st and King Drive, from its current owner, Medline Industries. Medline would only get $65 million, because the company agreed to make a $20 million “charitable contribution” back to the city. The city would use that $20 million to pay {{up to five years}} of interest on its $85 million debt, demolish the hospital, and clean up the site. Then sometime <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>next</b> <b>couple</b> years it planned to sell the site for at least $85 million to a developer or developers, who in turn were expected to build a complex big enough to house about 15,000 Olympians. After the games the developer would sell or rent out the units.|$|E

50|$|Mackaill made {{a smooth}} {{transition}} to sound with the part-talkie The Barker (1928) and had success <b>in</b> talkies for <b>the</b> <b>next</b> <b>couple</b> of years. First National Pictures was acquired by Warner Brothers in September 1928, and her contract with First National was not renewed upon its expiration in 1931.
