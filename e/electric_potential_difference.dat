5|$|The {{concept of}} {{electric}} potential is {{closely linked to}} that of the electric field. A small charge placed within an electric field experiences a force, and to have brought that charge to that point against the force requires work. The electric potential at any point is defined as the energy required to bring a unit test charge from an infinite distance slowly to that point. It is usually measured in volts, and one volt is the potential for which one joule of work must be expended to bring a charge of one coulomb from infinity. This definition of potential, while formal, has little practical application, and a more useful concept is that of <b>electric</b> <b>potential</b> <b>difference,</b> and is the energy required to move a unit charge between two specified points. An electric field has the special property that it is conservative, which means that the path taken by the test charge is irrelevant: all paths between two specified points expend the same energy, and thus a unique value for potential difference may be stated. The volt is so strongly identified as the unit of choice for measurement and description of <b>electric</b> <b>potential</b> <b>difference</b> that the term voltage sees greater everyday usage.|$|E

25|$|Traditionally, {{weights and}} {{measures}} legislation in the United Kingdom only applied to trade, but when the United Kingdom joined the European Economic Community, it had to align its legislation with EEC directives that were in place. These directives included EEC directive 71/354/EEC which related to {{weights and measures}} and which required the United Kingdom to formally define in law a number of units of measure, hitherto formally undefined in law including those for electric current (ampere), <b>electric</b> <b>potential</b> <b>difference</b> (volt), temperature (degree Celsius and kelvin), pressure (pascal), energy (joule) and power (watt).Due to public opposition to metrication (in 1979, 46% were opposed to the programme), the programme stalled. In the late 1970s, the United Kingdom government asked the EEC to postpone the deadlines for the introduction of metric units. The result was the repeal of directive 71/354/EEC {{and the introduction of}} directive 80/181/EEC. This new directive contained a derogation allowing for the continued use in the United Kingdom, until the end of 1989 (subsequently extended to 1995), of many imperial units then in use for trade. The directive should have been transposed into United Kingdom law by 30 June 1981, but this transposition only occurred with the enactment of The Weights and Measures Act 1985, which also removed from the statute book a large number of imperial units of measure that had fallen into disuse {{as a result of the}} completed elements of the metrication programme.|$|E

On the base of Einstein's research ideas, we explain the recent experimental results [3, 4] and propose the consistent theory on the physical nature of the electric effects in an electric capacitor at an action of the second sound standing wave in the superfluid Helium (4 He) and in the rotational torsional mechanical resonator in Helium II. The use of the Einstein's research approach, based on the consideration of an interconnection between the thermal, mechanical and electrical fluctuations, allows us to obtain the quantitative theoretical research results, which are in a good agreement with the experimental data on the correlations of the alternate low temperatures difference in the second sound wave, and the alternate <b>electric</b> <b>potentials</b> <b>difference</b> between the capacitor plates in the superfluid Helium {{as well as in}} the rotational torsional mechanical resonator in Helium II.

50|$|The {{electric}} field {{is not the}} only factor determining charge flow in a material, and different materials naturally develop <b>electric</b> <b>potential</b> <b>differences</b> at equilibrium (Galvani <b>potentials).</b> The <b>electric</b> <b>potential</b> of a material is not even a well defined quantity, since it varies on the subatomic scale. A more convenient definition of 'voltage' can be found instead in the concept of Fermi level. In this case the voltage between two bodies is the thermodynamic work required to move a unit of charge between them. This definition is practical since a real voltmeter actually measures this work, not a <b>difference</b> in <b>electric</b> <b>potential.</b>|$|R

The following {{sequence of events}} has been proposed {{on the basis of}} electric field fluctuations in liquid water. Random fluctuations in molecular motions occasionally (about once every 10 hours per water molecule) produce an electric field strong enough to break an oxygen–hydrogen bond, resulting in a hydroxide (OH−) and hydronium ion (H3O+); the hydrogen nucleus of the hydronium ion travels along water molecules by the Grotthuss mechanism and a change in the hydrogen bond network in the solvent isolates the two ions, which are stabilized by solvation. Within 1picosecond, however, a second reorganization of the hydrogen bond network allows rapid proton transfer down the <b>electric</b> <b>potential</b> <b>difference</b> and subsequent recombination of the ions. This timescale is consistent with the time it takes for hydrogen bonds to reorientate themselves in water.|$|E
2500|$|In {{order to}} detect weakly {{electric}} fields, animals must possess electroreceptors (receptive organs) that detect <b>electric</b> <b>potential</b> <b>differences.</b> For <b>electric</b> fishes, receptive organs are groups of sensory cells rooted in epidermal pits, which look like small {{spots on the}} skin. In each receptive organ, there are sensory cells embedded {{in the bottom of}} the opened [...] "pit" [...] that faces outside. Electroreceptors detect electric signals by building up a <b>potential</b> <b>difference</b> between the outside environment and the fish body's internal environment. Current flow due to such <b>potential</b> <b>difference</b> further results in a receptor potential that is presynaptic to the sensory fibers. Finally, this receptor potential leads to action potential fired by sensory cells.|$|R
