In termites and in humans, these methanogens may in fact be mutualists, interacting with other microbes in the gut to aid digestion. Archaean communities also associate with a range of other organisms, such as on the surface of corals, and in the region of soil that surrounds plant roots (the rhizosphere).|$|E

50|$|Corviax, {{son of the}} Left Emperor, finally {{wins the}} right to lead a search expedition; they {{discover}} that <b>the</b> <b>humans</b> of Earth share many similarities to the Iani and, believing that the Iani emotional bond with the Lindauzi can be recreated <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>humans,</b> Corviax instigates an ambitious scheme tomake <b>the</b> <b>human</b> population more receptive to the Lindauzi. He begins by covertly releasing viruses to thin the planet's population, and his fleet endears itself to the sick and traumatized survivors by arriving with a cure for the virus, seemingly by pure coincidence. Once a bond of trust has been established, the Lindauzi begin building settlements and inviting humans to live with them. Further dependence is fostered <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>humans</b> by <b>the</b> systematic decimation of the humans' companion animals, such as dogs and cats, by more viruses. Withinthree or four generations, humanity is completely dependent upon and subservient to the Lindauzi, who have begun their breeding program in earnest.|$|R

5|$|Although the Coris were {{discouraged}} from working together at Roswell, {{they continued to}} do so, specializing in investigating carbohydrate metabolism.

They published fifty papers while at Roswell, with first author status going to {{the one who had}} done most of the research for a given paper. Gerty Cori published eleven articles as the sole author. In 1929, they proposed the theoretical cycle that later won them the Nobel Prize, the Cori cycle.|$|E
5|$|As of 2017, {{just under}} 20,000 protein-coding genes {{are seen to}} be {{expressed}} <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>human,</b> and some 400 of these genes are brain-specific. The data that has been provided on gene expression in the brain has fuelled further research {{into a number of}} disorders. The long term use of alcohol for example, has shown altered gene expression in the brain, and cell-type specific changes that may relate to alcohol use disorder. These changes have been noted in the synaptic transcriptome in the prefrontal cortex, and are seen as a factor causing the drive to alcohol dependence, and also to other substance abuses.|$|E
