40|$|On the Tibetan Plateau, {{the limited}} {{ground-based}} rainfall information owing to a harsh environment has brought great challenges to hydrological studies. Satellite-based rainfall products, which {{allow for a}} better coverage than both radar network and rain gauges on the Tibetan Plateau, can be suitable alternatives <b>for</b> studies <b>on</b> <b>investigating</b> the hydrological processes and climate change. In this study, a newly developed daily satellite-based precipitation product, termed Precipitation Estimation from Remotely Sensed Information Using Artificial Neural Networks – Climate Data Record (PERSIANN-CDR), is used as input for a hydrologic model to simulate streamflow in the upper Yellow and Yangtze River basins on the Tibetan Plateau. The {{results show that the}} simulated streamflows using PERSIANN-CDR precipitation and the Global Land Data Assimilation System (GLDAS) precipitation are closer to observation than that using limited gauge-based precipitation interpolation in the upper Yangtze River basin. The simulated streamflow using gauge-based precipitation are higher than the streamflow observation during the wet season. In the upper Yellow River basin, gauge-based precipitation, GLDAS precipitation, and PERSIANN-CDR precipitation have similar good performance in simulating streamflow. The evaluation of streamflow simulation capability in this study partly indicates that the PERSIANN-CDR rainfall product has good potential to be a reliable dataset and an alternative information source of a limited gauge network for conducting long-term hydrological and climate studies on the Tibetan Plateau...|$|R

The model outlined in detail in this work consists of coupled population balance equations with non-local integro terms and takes crystal growth and aggregation processes into account. Solving the full order model takes a high computational effort, yet various solution snapshot sets from different parameters are required <b>for</b> <b>investigating</b> <b>on</b> the unknown parameters appearing in the model. Therefore, a reduced order model is set up from a full order solution snapshot set by applying the Galerkin projection with a basis computed through the proper orthogonal decomposition method. Numerical results of the model reduction are presented and further numerical approaches, for example greedy methods, are discussed.

40|$|In {{the search}} <b>for</b> life <b>on</b> Mars, <b>investigating</b> fluvial {{deposits}} {{will be a}} high priority for future landers. Although there is abundant evidence that fluvial processes worked with great intensity in the past (e. g., outflow channels, valley networks, and modified impact craters), aeolian processes dominate under the current environmental conditions. In fact there is evidence that extensive aeolian deposits may have filled in valley networks [1] and even shallow depressions where water may have ponded [2]. Thus, quite often there may be a disparity between the geology identified by orbital data and the geology accessible to a lander. Determining where fluvial deposits occur on the surface is important for addressing NASA's goal to "follow the water. " In order to do that, however, existing remote sensing data must be evaluated and a set of diagnostic criteria for recognizing fluvial deposits must be established. To that end, we are conducting a first order analysis of the thermal characteristics of fluvial and aeolian materials collected from central Australia...|$|R

40|$|Rice {{is highly}} {{sensitive}} to cold stress during reproductive developmental stages, and {{little is known}} about the mechanisms of cold responses in rice anther. Using the HiSeq™ 2000 sequencing platform, the anther transcriptome of photo thermo sensitive genic male sterile lines (PTGMS) rice Y 58 S and P 64 S (Pei’ai 64 S) were analyzed at the fertility sensitive stage under cold stress. Approximately 243 million clean reads were obtained from four libraries and aligned against the oryza indica genome and 1497 and 5652 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were identified in P 64 S and Y 58 S, respectively. Both gene ontology (GO) and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) analyses were conducted for these DEGs. Functional classification of DEGs was also carried out. The DEGs common to both genotypes were mainly involved in signal transduction, metabolism, transport, and transcriptional regulation. Most of the DEGs were unique for each comparison group. We observed that there were more differentially expressed MYB (Myeloblastosis) and zinc finger family transcription factors and signal transduction components such as calmodulin/calcium dependent protein kinases in the Y 58 S comparison group. It was also found that ribosome-related DEGs may play key roles in cold stress signal transduction. These results presented here would be particularly useful <b>for</b> further studies <b>on</b> <b>investigating</b> the molecular mechanisms of rice responses to cold stress...|$|R

40|$|The aim of {{this work}} is to {{describe}} the morpho-dynamic processes of coastal and submarine areas based on morpho-bathymetric data and sub-bottom acoustic profiles from the Calabrian Ionian margin (from Capo Spartivento to Capo Rizzuto).

The relationship between these geo-hazard features and the active tectonics and some severe historical earthquakes and tsunami is also discussed. The studied area is characterized by several well developed canyon systems. The retrogressive erosion of the canyon heads affects the continental shelf and interacts with the coastal morpho-sedimentary processes, evidencing the intense geomorphic activity of this sector of Ionian margin. The widespread evidence of mass wasting processes and slope instability, together with the historical seismicity, makes this area also an ideal case study <b>for</b> <b>investigating</b> <b>on</b> the possible relationship between earthquakes and landslide-triggered tsunami and assessing the potential risk...|$|R

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this thesis {{was to develop a}} {{conceptual}} framework that shows the relationship between aesthetics, performance, and preference in computer interface design. To investigate this relationship, the thesis focused <b>on</b> <b>investigating</b> the effect of layout aesthetics on visual search performance and preference. This thesis begins with a literature review of related work followed by the rationale for conducting this research, in particular, defining what it meant by visual aesthetics in the context of interface design. Chapter 4 focused <b>on</b> <b>investigating</b> the effect of layout aesthetics on performance and preference. The results show that response time performance and preference increased with increasing aesthetic level. Preference and performance were found to be highly correlated. Chapter 5 focused <b>on</b> <b>investigating</b> users’ layout preference when they were not involved with a performance-based task. The results showed, surprisingly, that preference was highest with a “moderate” level of layout aesthetics and lowest with “high” and “low” levels of aesthetics. Chapter 6 focused <b>on</b> <b>investigating</b> visual effort by measuring eye movement pattern during task performance. The results showed that visual effort increased with a decreasing level of aesthetics. Chapter 7 extended the experiment in Chapter 4 using more “ecologically valid” stimuli. The results essentially replicated the results produced in Chapter 4. Chapter 8 focused <b>on</b> <b>investigating</b> the relationship between so-called “classical” aesthetics and background “expressive” aesthetics. The results showed that task performance using classical aesthetics was highest with high and low levels of aesthetics and worst with medium levels of aesthetics. Performance with expressive aesthetics increased with decreasing aesthetic levels.
