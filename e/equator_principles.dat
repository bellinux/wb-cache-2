5|$|Application {{of social}} {{sustainability}} requires stakeholders {{to look at}} human and labor rights, prevention of human trafficking, and other human rights risks. These issues {{should be considered in}} production and procurement of various worldwide commodities. The international community has identified many industries whose practices have been known to violate social sustainability, and many of these industries have organizations in place that aid in verifying the social sustainability of products and services. The <b>Equator</b> <b>Principles</b> (financial industry), Fair Wear Foundation (garments), and Electronics Industry Citizenship Coalition are examples of such organizations and initiatives. Resources are also available for verifying the life-cycle of products and the producer or vendor level, such as Green Seal for cleaning products, NSF-140 for carpet production, and even labeling of Organic food in the United States.|$|E

Today, new gods have emerged [...] - [...] the god of power, the god of money. The Republic of San Blas lies west of the Orinoco Basin, slightly north of the <b>Equator.</b> Its <b>principle</b> exports are coffee, copra, mahogany, maize and saffron. In a hundred odd years, the reigns of government have changed many times; in blood, and fire, and death.

40|$|A self-consistent {{model is}} {{analyzed}} for the spherical infall of weakly magnetized plasma into the magnetosphere of a slowly rotating, strongly magnetized neutron star. It is shown that spherical infall {{is probably a}} good approximation for X-ray sources which accrete from a stellar wind. The location of the standoff shock which halts the hypersonic infall is estimated along with the emission from the shocked layer. The location of the equilibrium magnetopause {{and the structure of}} the magnetic field within it are calculated; it is found that the magnetic poles are true cusps and that the entry of gas due to equilibrium flow across a cusp is almost certainly dominated by the interchange instability near the magnetic <b>equator.</b> The energy <b>principle</b> is applied to derive necessary conditions for the occurrence of this instability. The results indicate that the strong magnetic-pressure gradient stabilizes the gas unless moderately strong radiative cooling takes place and that the cooled plasma enters the magnetosphere as long filaments capable of moving between field lines. The rate at which the equilibrium magnetopause can 'absorb' mass and momentum is derived, the validity of the approximations employed is discussed, and the likely evolution of the sinking filaments is outlined to show that the spatial distribution of the plasma is determined mainly by the dynamics and thermodynamics of the filaments rather than the magnetic-field structure...|$|R
40|$|The time {{dependent}} {{circulation of}} the North Brazil Current is studied with three numerical ocean circulation models, which differ by the vertical coordinate used to formulate the primitive equations. The models are driven {{with the same}} surface boundary conditions and their horizontal grid-resolution (isotropic, 1 / 3 ° at the <b>equator)</b> is in <b>principle</b> fine enough to permit the generation of mesoscale eddies. Our analysis of the mean seasonal currents concludes that the volume transport of the North Brazil Current (NBC) at the equator is principally determined by {{the strength of the}} meridional overturning, and suggests that the return path of the global thermohaline circulation is concentrated in the NBC. Models which simulate a realistic overturning at 24 °N of the order of 16 – 18 Sv also simulate a realistic NBC transport of nearly 35 Sv comparable to estimates deduced from the most recent observations. In all models, the major part of this inflow of warm waters from the South Atlantic recirculates in the zonal equatorial current system, but the models also agree on the existence of a permanent coastal mean flow to the north-west, from the equator into the Carribean Sea, {{in the form of a}} continuous current or a succession of eddies. Important differences are found between models in their representation of the eddy field. The reasons invoked are the use of different subgrid-scale parameterisations, and differences in stability of the NBC retroflection loop because of differences in the representation of the effect of bottom friction according to the vertical coordinate that is used. Finally, even if differences noticed between models in the details of the seasonal mean circulation and water mass properties could be explained by differences in the eddy field, nonetheless the major characteristics (mean seasonal currents, volume and heat transports) appears to be at first order driven by the strength of the thermohaline circulation...|$|R

25|$|For major mining {{companies}} and any company seeking international financing, {{there are a}} number of other mechanisms to enforce good environmental standards. These generally relate to financing standards such as the <b>Equator</b> <b>Principles,</b> IFC environmental standards, and criteria for Socially responsible investing. Mining companies have used this oversight from the financial sector to argue for some level of industry self-regulation. In 1992, a Draft Code of Conduct for Transnational Corporations was proposed at the Rio Earth Summit by the UN Centre for Transnational Corporations (UNCTC), but the Business Council for Sustainable Development (BCSD) together with the International Chamber of Commerce (ICC) argued successfully for self-regulation instead.|$|E
