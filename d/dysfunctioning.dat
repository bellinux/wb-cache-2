Methods: Sexual <b>dysfunction</b> was assessed in fifty patients receiving antipsychotic medication and fifty normal controls using Arizona Sexual experience scale (ASEX). Results: Erectile <b>dysfunction</b> (48 %) and ejaculatory <b>dysfunction</b> (45 %) are the two most prominent sexual <b>dysfunction</b> affecting patients taking antipsychotics and the difference from controls is statistically significant.

40|$|Recent {{population-based}} surveys {{suggest that}} the prevalence of erectile <b>dysfunction</b> is between 30 % and 56 % among men {{over the age of}} 40. Most of these studies, however, are from the United States or Europe. We need estimates of erectile <b>dysfunction</b> from samples of Brazilian populations, as societies that differ ethnically, culturally, and economically may also differ with respect to potential risk factors for erectile <b>dysfunction.</b> OBJECTIVE: To determine the prevalence of erectile <b>dysfunction</b> and its potential correlates. SETTING: Santos, State of S??o Paulo. DESIGN: Cross-sectional study. PARTICIPANTS: A population-based sample of men aged 40 - 70 years. Out of 718 men invited, 342 (47. 6 %) returned a completed questionnaire. MAIN MEASUREMENTS: Data on demographic variables, medical history, lifestyle habits and degree of erectile <b>dysfunction.</b> RESULTS: The prevalence of any degree of erectile <b>dysfunction</b> was 45. 9 % (minimal, 33. 9 %; moderate, 8. 5 %; complete, 3. 5 %) and increased with age. In bivariate age-adjusted analyses comparing men with no erectile <b>dysfunction</b> or minimal erectile <b>dysfunction</b> with those with moderate or complete erectile <b>dysfunction,</b> histories of diabetes or hypertension, depressive symptoms, heavy smoking and obesity were significantly associated with increased prevalence of erectile <b>dysfunction,</b> whereas moderate alcohol consumption was inversely associated with erectile <b>dysfunction.</b> In the multivariate model, age was a strong predictor of erectile <b>dysfunction,</b> while history of diabetes or hypertension and heavy smoking remained significantly associated with increased prevalence of erectile <b>dysfunction.</b> CONCLUSION: We found higher prevalence of erectile <b>dysfunction</b> (45. 9 %) among men older than 40 years old in Brazil. The variables associated with erectile <b>dysfunction</b> may alert physicians to patients who are at risk of erectile <b>dysfunction</b> as well as offer clues to the etiology of erectile <b>dysfunction.</b> Physicians should routinely ask their patients about sexual health and erectile <b>dysfunction...</b>|$|R
40|$|Bladder <b>dysfunction</b> (urinary urgency/frequency), bowel <b>dysfunction</b> (constipation), {{and sexual}} <b>dysfunction</b> (erectile <b>dysfunction)</b> (also called “pelvic organ” <b>dysfunctions)</b> are common nonmotor {{disorders}} in Parkinson's disease (PD). In contrast to motor disorders, pelvic organ autonomic <b>dysfunctions</b> are often nonresponsive to levodopa treatment. The brain pathology causing the bladder <b>dysfunction</b> (appearance of overactivity) involves an altered dopamine-basal ganglia circuit, which normally suppresses the micturition reflex. By contrast, peripheral myenteric pathology causing slowed colonic transit (loss of rectal contractions) and central pathology causing weak strain and paradoxical anal sphincter contraction on defecation (PSD, also called as anismus) {{are responsible for}} the bowel <b>dysfunction.</b> In addition, hypothalamic <b>dysfunction</b> is mostly responsible for the sexual <b>dysfunction</b> (decrease in libido and erection) in PD, via altered dopamine-oxytocin pathways, which normally promote libido and erection. The pathophysiology of the pelvic organ <b>dysfunction</b> in PD differs from that in multiple system atrophy; therefore, it might aid in differential diagnosis. Anticholinergic agents are used to treat bladder <b>dysfunction</b> in PD, although these drugs should be used with caution particularly in elderly patients who have cognitive decline.

However, this <b>dysfunction</b> was rather more extensive than that found in the other diseases.

The <b>dysfunction</b> was rather severe in the cases with intracranial diseases, cirrhosis of the liver, and leukemia. In a case of pulmonary tuberculosis, although testicular fundings were normal, the tuberculosis was so acute that death ensued. 3) P rostatic cancer, 9 cases Spermatopoietic <b>dysfunction</b> was found in all 9 cases, among which moderate <b>dysfunction</b> was found in 3 cases and slight <b>dysfunction</b> in 6 cases. In these cases, the <b>dysfunction</b> by age was naturally under consideration.

Proliferation of interstitial connective tissue was found in 16 cases. However, proliferation of Leydig's cell was found in few {{cases in which the}} proliferation was slight and in most cases there was a tendency to be normal or rather decreased. 5) Tuberculous epididymitis, 21 case s Spermatopoietic <b>dysfunction</b> was found in all 21 cases, among which moderate <b>dysfunction</b> was found in 6 cases and slight <b>dysfunction</b> in 15 cases. Furthermore, the degree of the <b>dysfunction</b> was parallel to changes in the epididymis.

Microscopic fundings of the testicle was almost normal comparing with that of tuberculous epididymitis in which clinical findings were identical to simple epididymitis. 7) Diseases of the testicle and its adjacent tissue, 20 cases Sever s p ermatopoietic <b>dysfunction</b> was found in 2 cases, moderate <b>dysfunction</b> in 8 cases.

5000|$|Mucolipin1 {{is thought}} to be {{localized}} in endosomes. An important property of mucolipin1 is that decreasing pH (acidification) results in deactivation of the protein, likely through an assembly defect.

Milder mutations, such as ΔF408 and V446L, produce a <b>dysfunctioning</b> form of the cation channel. Mutations that alter only the C-terminal of the protein also result in a mild phenotype of the disorder, usually sparing the brain.
