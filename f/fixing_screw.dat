40|$|Introduction. Polyaxial screws {{had been}} only tested {{according}} to the ASTM standards (when they were perpendicularly positioned to the rod). In this study, effects of the pedicle screws angled fixation to the rod on the mechanical properties of fixation were investigated. Materials and Method. 30 vertically <b>fixed</b> <b>screws</b> and 30 <b>screws</b> <b>fixed</b> with angle {{were used in the}} study. Screws were used in three different diameters which were 6. 5 [*]mm, 7. 0 [*]mm, and 7. 5 [*]mm, in equal numbers. Axial pull-out and flexion moment tests were performed. Test results compared with each other using appropriate statistical methods. Results. In pull-out test, vertically <b>fixed</b> <b>screws,</b> in 6. 5 [*]mm and 7. 0 [*]mm diameter, had significantly higher maximum load values than angled <b>fixed</b> <b>screws</b> with the same diameters (P< 0. 01). Additionally, vertically <b>fixed</b> <b>screws,</b> in all diameters, had significantly greater stiffness according to corresponding size fixed with angle (P< 0. 005). Conclusion. <b>Fixing</b> the pedicle <b>screw</b> to the rod with angle significantly decreased the pull-out stiffness in all diameters. Similarly, pedicle <b>screw</b> instrumentation <b>fixed</b> with angle decreased the minimum sagittal angle between the rod and the screw in all diameters for flexion moment test but the differences were not significant...|$|R

40|$|In this thesis,a {{design of}} a {{portable}} measuring test rig is developed {{with the aim of}} measure the tangential force, the most characteristic component of the cutting force. This test rig can be used in different lathes without any large modification. The design is based on the lever law to transmit the tangential force to a piezoelectric senso rconnected to an amplifier, to a dataa cquisition system and to a computer to obtain the graph of the speed against the tangential cutting force. The sensor is preload using an original <b>fixing</b> <b>screw</b> of the lathe. The results show that the tangential force is measurable using the device. Due to the geometry, when the tangential force rises 100 N, the reaction in the sensor rises approximately 120 N. Using a preload in the sensor of 10 kN, with a tangential force of 500 N, the piezoelectric sensor receive about 13 kN...|$|E
40|$|Purpose. Subject {{matter of}} the present paper is to {{investigate}} the characteristics of hardness and fixation of fractures with standard and self-tightening screws, fixing the oblique fracture of the proximal epiphyse of tibia in real regimes of external load including the cyclic ones. Model / methodology / approach. During the experiment the specimen of limbs without pathology of the bone tissue had been used. Fixation of the bone fragments (osteosynthesis) had been performed by the means of standard and self-tightening screws. The tests had been conducted by the way of transmission of load through the distal joint of the epiphysial cartilage of the hip bone and through the injured distal condyle. Load regimes: single static influence and multiple cyclically changing loads, imitating the human weight. Conclusion. During the transmission of the compressing force onto the fragment, the type of the <b>fixing</b> <b>screw</b> greatly influences the deformation of the osteosynthetic systems {{at all levels of}} load; permanent residual deformations (mutual shift of fragments) of the systems with self-tightening screws are much more lower if compared to the ones of the systems, employing the standard ones. Employment of the new type of screws significantly increases the fixation stability and generally increases the mechanical durability of the fixation of the oblique fracture of the proximal epiphyse of tibia. ??????????? ?????????????? ????????? ? ?????????? ???????? ????????? ???????????? ? ?????????????????????? ???????, ??????? ????????? ????? ??????? ?????????????? ??????? ?????????????? ????? ? ????????, ??????? ???????????, ??????? ???????? ??????? ????????. ??? ???????? ?????????? ?????? ?? ??????? ??? ??????????? ?????? ??????????? ?????? ?? ?????????? ??????? ???????????? ??? ???? ??????? ????????; ?????????? ??????????
