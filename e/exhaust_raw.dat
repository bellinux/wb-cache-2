To prevent the startling and potentially damaging effects of the explosive combustion of this raw fuel, a diverter valve is used. This valve senses the sharp increase in intake manifold vacuum resulting from the sudden closure of the throttle, and diverts the air pump's outlet to atmosphere. Usually this diverted air is routed to the engine air cleaner or to a separate silencer to muffle objectionable pump noise.|$|E
40|$|New {{computational}} {{procedures are}} proposed {{for evaluating the}} exhaust brake specific mass emissions of each pollutant species in internal combustion (IC) engines. The procedures start from the chemical reaction of fuel with combustion air and, {{based on the measured}} <b>exhaust</b> <b>raw</b> emissions THC, CH 4, NOx, CO, O 2, CO 2, calculate the volume fractions of the compounds in the exhaust gases, including those that are not usually measured, such as water, nitrogen and hydrogen. The molecular mass of the exhaust gases is then evaluated and the brake specific emissions can be obtained if the exhaust flow rate and the engine power output are measured. The algorithm can also be applied to the evaluation of air/fuel ratio from measured raw volume emissions of IC engines. The new procedures take the effects of various fuel and combustion air compositions into account, with particular reference to different natural gas blends {{as well as to the}} presence of water vapor, CO 2, Ar and He in the combustion air. In the paper, the algorithms are applied to the evaluation of air-fuel ratio and brake specific mass emissions in an automotive bi-fuel Spark Ignition (SI) engine with multipoint sequential port-fuel injection. The experimental tests were carried out in a wide range of steady-state operating conditions under both gasoline and compressed natural gas operations. The specific emissions calculated from the new procedures are compared to those evaluated by applying Society of Automotive Engineers (SAE) and International Standards Organization (ISO) recommended practices and the air-fuel ratio results are compared to those obtained either from directly measured air and fuel mass flow rates or from Universal Exhaust Gas Oxygen (UEGO) sensor data. The sensitivity of the procedure results to the main engine working parameters, the influence of environmental conditions (in particular the effect of air humidity on NOx formation) and the experimental uncertainties are also determined...|$|E

40|$|Recently, a {{particle}} number (PN) limit {{was introduced in}} the European light-duty vehicles legislation. The legislation requires measurement of PN, and particulate mass (PM), from the full dilution tunnel with constant volume sampling (CVS). Furthermore, PN measurements will be introduced in the next stage of the European Heavy-Duty regulation. Heavy-duty engine certification can be done either from the CVS or from a partial flow dilution system (PFDS). For research and development purposes, though, measurements are often conducted from the <b>raw</b> <b>exhaust,</b> thereby avoiding the high installation costs of CVS and PFDS. Although for legislative measurements requirements exist regarding sampling and transport of the aerosol sample, such requirements do not necessarily apply for <b>raw</b> <b>exhaust</b> measurements. Thus, measurement differences are often observed depending on where in the experimental set up sampling occurs. The objective {{of this paper is to}} summarize and discuss particle loss mechanisms. Simple equations are given for the most important mechanisms. Topics like isokinetic sampling and agglomeration are discussed for various typical cases. Special emphasis is placed on thermophoretic losses since thermophoresis is the most important particle removal mechanism for <b>raw</b> <b>exhaust</b> sampling from modern engines. Sampling from high pressure exhaust gas is also mentioned, and comparisons of the effect of tubing materials on particle removal are carried out. Finally, expected losses for typical cases are shown.

The tests were conducted in the Vehicle Emission Laboratory (VELA) at the European Commission Joint Research Centre (EC-JRC) Ispra, Italy.

The measured ammonia concentrations and the emission profiles revealed that these three instruments are suitable to measure ammonia from the vehicles <b>raw</b> <b>exhaust,</b> presenting no significant differences. Furthermore, results showed that measurement of ammonia from the vehicle exhaust using online systems can be performed guaranteeing the reproducibility and repeatability of the results.

40|$|A high {{concentration}} of volatile nucleation mode particles (NUP) formed in the atmosphere when the exhaust cools and dilutes has hazardous health effects and it impairs the visibility in urban areas. Nucleation mechanisms in diesel exhaust are only poorly understood. We performed model studies using two sectional aerosol dynamics process models AEROFOR and MAFOR on the formation of particles in the exhaust of a diesel engine, equipped with an oxidative after-treatment system and running with low fuel sulfur content (FSC) fuel, under laboratory sampling conditions where the dilution system mimics real-world conditions. Different nucleation mechanisms were tested. Based on the measured gaseous sulfuric acid (GSA) and non-volatile core and soot particle number concentrations of the <b>raw</b> <b>exhaust,</b> the model simulations showed that the best agreement between model predictions and measurements in terms of particle number size distribution was obtained by barrier-free heteromolecular homogeneous nucleation between the GSA and a semi-volatile organic vapour combined with the homogeneous nucleation of GSA alone. Major growth of the particles was predicted to occur due to the similar organic vapour at concentrations of (1 - 2) x 10 (12) cm(- 3). The pre-existing core and soot mode concentrations had an opposite trend on the NUP formation, and the maximum NUP formation was predicted if a diesel particle filter (DPF) was used. On the other hand, the model predicted that the NUP formation ceased if the GSA concentration in the <b>raw</b> <b>exhaust</b> was less than 10 (10) cm(- 3), which was the case when biofuel was used...|$|R

40|$|An {{independent}} controller {{was proposed}} to perform real-time diagnosis and modeling based control for diesel aftertreatment devices, {{such as the}} diesel particulate filters (DPF) and the lean NOx traps (LNT). The diesel aftertreatment devices for this research were in active flow control configuration. As opposed to passive aftertreatment control where the engine tailors the <b>raw</b> <b>exhaust</b> conditions, in active aftertreatment configuration, the <b>raw</b> <b>exhaust</b> conditions were modified with independent controls, such as aftertreatment temperature control, exhaust flow control, and aftertreatment excess air/fuel ratio (A) control. The determination of the diesel engine transient exhaust gas temperature is essential for effective active flow aftertreatment control schemes. To overcome the slow response of the high-inertia thermocouples used in the harsh diesel exhaust environment, a temperature response model was developed {{as part of this}} research. The temperature response model was verified by tests conducted on a Yanmar NFD 170 single cylinder diesel engine setup. The model was then implemented into a National Instrument PCI- 6023 E multifunction data acquisition board with LabVIEW. The LabVIEW program was tested on the Yanmar engine setup and was capable of estimating the transient exhaust gas temperature in real-time using the temperature data obtained from two high-inertia thermocouples with a proper diameter ratio. The simplified transient aftertreatment model representing the regeneration behavior of the DPF and the performance of the LNT were also proposed. (Abstract shortened by UMI.)

40|$|A {{detailed}} {{study on the}} removal of oxides of nitrogen (NOx) from the exhaust of a stationary diesel engine was carried out using non-thermal plasma (dielectric barrier discharge) process. The objective {{of the study was}} to explore the effect of different voltage energizations and exhaust composition on the NOx removal process. Three types of voltage energizations, namely AC, DC and Pulse were examined. Due to the ease of generation of high voltage AC/DC electrical discharges from automobile/Vehicular battery supply for possible retrofitting in exhaust cleaning circuit, it was found relevant to investigate individual energisation cases in detail for NOx removal. AC and Pulse energisations exhibit a superior NOx removal efficiency compared to DC energisation. However, Pulse energisation is found to be more energy efficient.

In this study a diesel engine for non-road applications has been fuelled with Waste Cooking Oil biodiesel blended with commercial fossil fuel at 6 % and 30 % v/v. In line with literature trends, experimental results indicate a significant reduction of PM emissions and only a slight increase in NOx emissions.

Methods used to achieve these aims involved: a) The construction of a test rig to measure the efficiency and backpressure of new and used disposable filters b) The testing of the in service fleet at four of BHP Billiton Illawarra Coal mines using an R&P Series 5100 diesel analysis system mounted in a trailer c) Comparison of a newer design engine with three current vehicles under mining conditions d) A detailed statistical review of all available data from the Tower Colliery Research group. Key outcomes from research conducted for this thesis are: a) The filtration efficiency and backpressure of disposable diesel exhaust filters used by BHP Billiton Illawarra Coal have been improved. These improvements, together with changes to work practices, generate potential cost savings of $ 395, 000 per annum while affording increased protection to equipment operators. b) Seven engines with unacceptable <b>raw</b> <b>exhaust</b> elemental carbon emissions were identified in a fleet of 66 tested. Some faults identified as causing these elevated emission levels were- blocked exhaust flame traps (scrubber tanks), incorrectly set tappets and worn injectors. c) Testing of a prototype 4 WD fire protected vehicle powered by an "over the road" engine as against three current vehicles, highlighted reductions in atmospheric elemental carbon concentrations of 67 90 %. Significant reductions in <b>raw</b> <b>exhaust</b> elemental carbon levels were also observed. d) A statistical review of data produced by the Tower Colliery Diesel Research group identified elevated exposures within mine transportation roadways.

40|$|Emissions from marine {{vessels are}} being {{scrutinized}} {{as a major}} contributor to the total particulate matter (TPM), oxides of sulfur (SOx) and oxides of nitrogen (NOx) environmental loading. Fuel sulfur control is the key to SOx reduction. Significant reductions in the emissions from on-road vehicles have been achieved in the last decade and the emissions from these vehicles will be reduced by another order of magnitude in the next five years: these improvements have served to emphasize the need to reduce emissions from other mobile sources, including off road equipment, locomotives, and marine vessels. Diesel-powered vessels of interest include ocean going vessels with low- and medium-speed engines, as well as ferries with high speed engines, as discussed below. A recent study examined the use of intake water injection (WIS) and ultra low sulfur diesel (ULSD) to reduce the emissions from a high-speed passenger ferry in southern California. One of the four Detroit Diesel 12 V 92 two-stroke high speed engines that power the Waverider (operated by SCX, inc.) was instrumented to collect intake airflow, fuel flow, shaft torque, and shaft speed. Engine speed and shaft torque were uniquely linked for given vessel draft and prevailing wind and sea conditions. A <b>raw</b> <b>exhaust</b> gas sampling system was utilized to measure the concentration of NOx, carbon dioxide (CO 2), and oxygen (O 2) and a mini dilution tunnel sampling a slipstream from the <b>raw</b> <b>exhaust</b> was used to collect TPM on 70 mm filters. The emissions data were processed to yield brake-specific mass results. The system that was employed allowed for redundant data to be collected for quality assurance and quality control. To acquire the data, the Waverider was operated at five different steady state speeds. Three modes were in the open sea off Oceanside, CA, and idle and harbor modes were also used. Data have showed that the use of ULSD along with water injection (WIS) could significantly reduce the emissions of NOx and PM while not affecting fuel consumption or engine performance compared to the baseline marine diesel. The results showed that a nominal 40 % reduction in TPM was realized when switching from the marine diesel to the ULSD. A small reduction in NOx was also shown between the marine fuel and the ULSD. The implementation of the WIS showed that NOx was reduced significantly by between 11 % and 17 %, depending upon the operating condition.

Results are given for a test matrix made up of twelve steady-state operating conditions. For all conditions except the 1 / 4 rack (light load) condition, modest thermal efficiency gains were noted upon ethanol fumigation. Methanol showed the same increase at 3 / 4 and full rack (high load) conditions. However, engine roughness or the occurrence of severe knock limited the maximum amount of alcohol that could be fumigated. Brake specific nitrogen oxide concentrations were found to decrease for all ethanol conditions tested. Oxides of nitrogen emissions, on a volume basis, decreased for all alcohol conditions tested.

40|$|A new exhaust aerosol model CFD-TUTEAM (Tampere University of Technology Exhaust Aerosol Model for Computational Fluid Dynamics) was developed. It {{is based}} on modal aerosol {{dynamics}} modeling with log-normal assumption of particle distributions. The model has an Eulerian sub-model providing detailed spatial information within the computational domain and a computationally less expensive, but spatial-information-lacking, Lagrangian sub-model. Particle formation in a laboratory sampling system that includes a porous tube-type diluter and an aging chamber was modeled with CFD-TUTEAM. The simulation results imply that over 99 % of new particles are formed in the aging chamber region because the nucleation rate remains {{at a high level}} in the aging chamber due to low dilution ratio and low nucleation exponents.

A total of eight vehicles with low-emission vehicle (LEV) to super-ultra-low-emission vehicle (SULEV) certification were tested over the Federal Test Procedure (FTP 75), a US 06 cycle, a hot running 505, a New York City Cycle (NYCC), and a specially designed Modal Emissions Cycle (MEC 01 v 7) using both as-received and bench-aged catalysts. Modal NH 3 emissions measurements in the <b>raw</b> <b>exhaust</b> were obtained using a tunable diode laser (TDL). The results show that NH 3 emissions are cycle-dependent, with higher emissions found for more aggressive cycles. Modal emissions data show that NH 3 emissions are primarily generated during acceleration events, although for some vehicles NH 3 emissions are formed in the period immediately after catalyst light-off. Strong correlations were found between tailpipe NH 3 measurements and both vehicle specific power (VSP) and engine-out carbon monoxide (CO) emissions. The correlation with CO is consistent with the role of CO in forming NH 3 emissions via the water-gas shift reaction.

40|$|Two {{decades of}} rapid urban growth and {{increasing}} per capita water consumption has left water providers in Northwest Arkansas {{concerned about their}} ability to meet future demand for water. Beaver Water District (BWD) is the largest of four regional water providers that draw from Beaver Lake, the only source of potable water in the region. Growth projections and per capita consumption patterns indicate that BWD could <b>exhaust</b> its <b>raw</b> water allocation as early as 2031. Municipal water customers served by BWD were surveyed about their stated priorities for water use, their water conservation behaviors, and their attitudes and perceptions about urban growth, water resources, and willingness to pay fees for future water availability. A logistic regression, or 2 Ì† 2 logit 2 Ì† 2 model was developed from the survey to identify the attitudes that affect willingness-to-pay (WTP) and estimate mean WTP for water. Logit models are commonly used to estimate mean WTP for an environmental good, but the parameter estimates generated in a logit model describe a global relationship between the dependent and independent variables. Because the independent variables often represent Social processes that are spatially non-stationary, geographically weighted regression (GWR) provides a means to examine spatial variations in a model by calculating local parameter estimates for every data point. GWR was applied to the data to identify spatial variations in mean WTP and the attitudes that influence WTP. Using a logit model, mean WTP was estimated at 227 annually for the region, with subsets of the data by municipality showing WTP ranges from 209 to 245. Using GWR, mean WTP over the region was estimated at 229 annually, but actual WTP values calculated for each data point ranged from 67 to 442 per year, with a clear pattern of low values correlating to closer proximity to the water resource. Both the logit and the GWR models were successful in estimating mean WTP over a region, but GWR also illustrated important spatial patterns in the data that can enrich our understanding of the problem and lead to more successful long-term strategies and solutions for meeting the future needs of a rapidly-expanding population...|$|R

The MGT produces less <b>raw</b> <b>exhaust</b> gaseous emissions such as HC and CO in aerospace and static applications compared to the internal combustion engine. In addition, the MGT weight is less than an equivalent internal combustion engine and potentially can reduce the level of CO 2 further in a vehicle application. However, the use of the MGT in an automotive domain has some unique technical and commercial requirements that will require new validation approaches. An air filtration system is known to be one of the important elements to characterise the performance and the emissions of the MGT. In the past, most of the efforts on MGT were focused on the vehicle development and packaging studies, where the technical requirements of the test standards for the air filtration system were not considered. Furthermore, the validation techniques of the air filtration system for automotive applications have different requirements to those of a large scale turbine for aerospace use. A test method has been developed to investigate the effect of the automotive air filtration system on the MGTâ€™s characteristics in terms of the electrical power output and potentially the gaseous emissions.

Whole <b>raw</b> <b>exhaust</b> fumes from four catalysts {{of three different}} types were examined during their useful lifetime, from fresh to 80 000 km. Two were gasoline engine catalysts (PtÂ–PdÂ–Rh and PdÂ–Rh), while {{the other two were}} diesel engine catalysts (Pt). Samples were collected following the 91441 EUDC driving cycle for light-duty vehicle testing, and the sample collection device used allowed differentiation between the particulate and soluble fractions, the latter being the most relevant from an environmental point of view. Analyses were performed by inductively coupled plasma-mass spectrometry (ICP-MS) (quadrupole and high resolution), and special attention was paid to the control of spectral interference, {{especially in the case of}} Pd and Rh. The results obtained show that, for fresh catalysts, the release of particulate PGE through car exhaust fumes does not follow any particular trend, with a wide range (oneÂ–two orders of magnitude) for the content of noble metals emitted. The samples collected from 30 000 Â– 80 000 km present a more homogeneous PGE release for all catalysts studied. A decrease of approximately one order of magnitude is observed with respect to the release from fresh catalysts, except in the case of the diesel engine catalyst, for which PGE emission continued to be higher than in the case of gasoline engines. The fraction of soluble PGE was found to represent less than 10 % of the total amount released from fresh catalysts. For aged catalysts, the figures are significantly higher, especially for Pd and Rh. Particulate PGE can be considered as virtually biologically inert, while soluble PGE forms can represent an environmental risk due to their bioavailability, which leads them to accumulate in the environment...|$|R
40|$|Automotive {{catalytic}} converters, {{in which}} Pt, Pd and Rh (platinum-group elements; PGEs) are the active components for eliminating several noxious components from exhaust fumes, {{have become the}} main source of environmental urban pollution by PGEs. This work reports on the catalyst morphology through changes in catalyst surface by scanning electron microscopy/energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (SEM/EDX) and laser-induced breakdown spectrometry (LIBS) from fresh to aged catalytic converters. The distribution of these elements in the fresh catalysts analysed (PtÂ–PdÂ–Rh gasoline catalyst) is not uniform and occurs mainly in a longitudinal direction. This heterogeneity seems to be greater for Pt and Pd. PGEs released by the catalysts, fresh and aged 30 000 km, were studied in parallel. Whole <b>raw</b> <b>exhaust</b> fumes from four catalysts of three different types were also examined. Two of these were gasoline catalysts (PtÂ–PdÂ–Rh and PdÂ–Rh) and the other two were diesel catalysts (Pt). Samples were collected following the 91441 EUDC driving cycle for light-duty vehicle testing. The results show that at 0 km the samples collected first have the highest content of particulate PGEs and although the general tendency is for the release to decrease with increasing number of samples taken, exceptions are frequent. At 30 000 km the released PGEs in gasoline and diesel catalysts decreased significantly. For fresh gasoline catalysts the mean of the total amount released was approximately 100, 250 and 50 ng km&# 8722; 1 for Pt, Pd and Rh, respectively. In diesel catalysts the Pt release varied in the range 400 Â– 800 ng km&# 8722; 1. After ageing the catalysts up to 30 000 km, the gasoline catalysts released amounts of Pt between 6 and 8 ng km&# 8722; 1, Pd between 12 and 16 ng km&# 8722; 1 and Rh between 3 and 12 ng km&# 8722; 1. In diesel catalysts the Pt release varied in the range 108 Â– 150 ng km&# 8722; 1. The soluble portion of PGEs in the HNO 3 collector solution represented less than 5 % of the total amount for fresh catalysts. For 30 000 km the total amount of soluble PGEs released was similar or slightly higher than for 0 km...|$|R
40|$|The {{research}} {{presented in}} this document examines the results of melding three diesel engine emissions reduction methodologies: partially premixed low temperature combustion (LTC); the use of alternative, biodiesel fuel; and aftertreatment using a diesel oxidation catalyst (DOC). It shows how alternative fuels and novel combustion strategies complement each other {{on one hand and}} create new emissions challenges on the other. Partially premixed LTC simultaneously reduces soot and NOX emissions for both biodiesel and petroleum diesel fuels. The use of biodiesel in LTC has added benefits of lowering total hydrocarbon (THC) and CO emissions and reducing soot emissions to near undetectable levels. Light hydrocarbon species like ethylene emitted from biodiesel LTC as a fraction of THC are higher independent of ignition delay indicating that biodiesel burns more completely and results in less unburned hydrocarbon (UHC) emissions than petroleum diesel. However, the generally higher gas-phase UHC emissions from LTC compared to conventional combustion results in excessive particulate matter (PM) for biodiesel due to heterogeneous condensation of methyl esters onto soot particles after dilution with atmospheric air. In the work presented here, this condensation process resulted in over an order of magnitude increase in PM emissions for B 100 in a late injection LTC condition (LLTC) compared to petroleum-derived fuels. For an early injection LTC (ELTC) condition, PM emissions were almost 100 times higher than the diesel fuels tested. Low vapor pressure methyl esters making up biodiesel have a near 95 % conversion from the gas to the particle phase with an undiluted exhaust UHC concentration of 1000 ppm for a 10 : 1 dilution ratio and 47 Â°C collection temperature. Although the use of biodiesel in LTC increases PM emissions significantly following dilution of the <b>raw</b> <b>exhaust,</b> the results of this work indicate that 80 % of UHC in the exhaust is oxidized by a standard DOC with inlet temperature of 240 Â°C. Unfortunately, the remaining unburned biodiesel left unconverted still significantly contributes to the PM following dilution. Methyl esters were found to be the primary species contributing to the higher total organic fraction (> 90 %) on the PM for biodiesel compared with diesel LLTC following a DOC...|$|R
40|$|As {{part of the}} Diesel Emissions Evaluation Program (DEEP) consortium, Noranda Inc. has {{undertaken}} a field project to evaluate the overall performance of the latest diesel particulate filter technology (DPF) at its Brunswick Mine in Bathurst, New Brunswick. Performance of the filtration systems is evaluated {{with respect to their}} ability to reduce tailpipe emissions and concentrations of diesel particulate matter (DPM) and noxious gases in mine air, efficiency of filter regeneration process, maintenance requirements, reliability, and acceptance. Four different particulate filter systems deployed on heavy production vehicles are subjected to an 18 -month field evaluation. Over the evaluation period the vehicles will have accumulated approximately 4000 operating hours in production. This paper presents the results of testing conducted mid way through the 18 -month field trials. The 400 - meter section of the mine drift at 525 - 5 sub level, hereinafter referred to as the "isolated zone" was isolated between intake and exhaust fan systems and sealed with bulkheads against leakage. The isolated zone was ventilated at the rate required per CSA Standards and issued by CANMET for the engines tested. Four vehicles, two load-haul-dumps (LHDs) and two trucks, retrofitted with particulate filter systems were tested along with a new identical model LHD and truck equipped with exhaust systems consisting of a catalytic converter (DOC) and muffler. The test vehicles were operated individually inside the isolated zone for approximately 4 hours over simulated production duty cycles. Measurements of ambient concentrations of particulate matter, tailpipe emissions, and engine parameters were performed for each of the tested vehicles. The DPM samples for carbon were collected at the most up- stream end of the isolated zone, at the vehicle next to the operator, and at the most downstream or exhaust end of the isolated zone. The DPM samples were analyzed for total (organic and elemental) carbon using NIOSH Analytical Method 5040. Ambient concentrations of particulate matter at the exhaust end of the zone were also measured using Scanning Mobility Particle Sizer (SMPS), and real time PAH monitor (PAS 2000). Efficiency of the filters was also evaluated on a basis of tailpipe measurements performed using <b>raw</b> <b>exhaust</b> instruments the NanoMet and the UGAS. In addition, relevant engine parameters were obtained using Detroit Diesel Diagnostic Link (DDDL) and from exhaust backpressure and temperature measurements. Results from the tests proved conclusively that diesel particulate filters can significantly reduce the concentrations of air- borne DPM, but not without careful monitoring of both ambient and tailpipe emissions and not without careful attention with respect to maintaining the integrity of the DPF systems...|$|R
40|$|Soot {{particles}} pose significant {{adverse health}} effects and influence on earth's temperature and climate. Hence, the elimination of soot emissions from diesel engines has attracted a lot of attention. Prior to this work, the investigation of soot oxidation is done mostly under air environment. However, since it is typical for NO 2 {{to be used in}} promoting regeneration under low-temperature soot oxidation for modern DPF, this study focuses on deriving the kinetics of soot oxidation under the influence of NO 2 being a major oxidant. An online aerosol technique of high temperature oxidation-tandem-differential mobility analysis is used with soot being oxidized in a laminar flow reactor at temperature ranging from 500 to 900 &# 8451; with NO 2 concentration from 0 to 600 ppm. The exposure of soot particles to the non-uniform temperature and NO 2 mixing ratio inside the furnace causing NO 2 thermal decomposition is thoroughly accounted for the first time. The soot oxidation rates being calculated as a function of frequency factor Asoot and activation energy Esoot are found to be: Asoot = 2. 4 x 10 - 14 nmK- 0. 5 s- 1 cm 3 molecule- 1 and Esoot = 47. 1 kJ mol- 1. NO 2 oxidation shows significantly lower activation energy when compared to that for O 2 at temperatures below 500 &# 8451;. Even at higher temperature (800 to 900 &# 8451;), the soot oxidation rates with NO 2 is still comparable to that with air. This indicates that NO 2 is a stronger oxidant than O 2 since only parts per million levels of NO 2 are sufficient to cause such significant soot oxidation. After the emissions from diesel exhausts are released into the atmosphere, secondary organic aerosol (SOA) are formed from the photo-chemical oxidation of organic vapors and followed by gas-to-particle partitioning. This study aims to advance the understanding of diesel emission influences on SOA formation with a major focus on the photo-oxidation of aromatic hydrocarbons inside an environmental chamber that simulates atmospheric chemistry. The investigation through combining the real-time density measurement and other physical/chemical analysis (APM-SMPS, HR-ToF-AMS) demonstrates that mass-based measurement techniques are necessary for interpreting the physical processes (evaporation of SVOCs and condensation of secondary organic compounds) during SOA formation due to the external void space in the agglomerate particles. Analysis of O/C ratio has shown to increase rapidly from 0. 05 to 0. 25 within 12 hours inside the chamber, emphasizing that the multigenerational oxidation of volatile organic vapors from the exhaust to be an important source of SOA formation. The impact of different dilution methods on the diesel particles evolution inside the chamber is investigated for the first time. Lower effective densities and stronger evaporation of semi-volatile species is observed from the intense dilution by the ejector dilutor as opposed to the <b>raw</b> <b>exhaust</b> injection into a full bag inside the environmental chamber...|$|R
40|$|Introduction The {{transfer}} of knowledge (bridging) between lab scale and full scale catalyst research may sometimes be hindered by various reasons. These reasons include phenomena in the full scale that were not encountered at the lab scale or model parameters that were not precisely fit from the lab scale experiments. Also, when moving to full scale (engine bench) experimentation, other issues become important such as transport phenomena including heat losses (not to mention cost for engine rig experiments). The benefits of using real engine emissions in a reactor system that also possesses the lab scale benefits can be exemplified with two important issues: â€¢	Model hydrocarbon (HC) used in lab scale (often propene) is seldom a very good representative for real HC emissions (incl. acetylene and aromatics). â€¢	Engine Particulate Matter (PM) {{is very difficult to}} mimic using synthetic PM for studies of particulate oxidation and filter performance. This paper presents a reactor system design and discusses various aspects of reactor design of an Emission After Treatment System (EATS) {{to be used as a}} bridge between lab scale and full scale research. It will be exemplified for a study in particulate trapping for open filters but also discussed for other applications. Materials and Methods Most of the materials were standard components crafted at the department workshop. The process of the reactor system design included several practical aspects: engine rig environment, scope of objectives, requirements on robustness and accuracy as well as time and resources. The most important aspect is to enable efficient Design of Experiments (DoE) requiring independent variations in reactor conditions. The resulting design is presented in figure 1 below. Figure 1. A schematic picture of the reactor system. Results and Discussion The resulting design enables the following experimental features: â€¢	Independent residence time: By gas flow restriction (~ 0. 1 % of the total flow), by adding gases (air or any other gas) or a combination of both. By using catalysts of different size (10 cm 3 â€“ 2. 5 dm 3). â€¢	Independent gas temperature: Either by applying cooling or by heating or a combination of both. â€¢	Almost independent gas phase concentrations: By using the <b>raw</b> <b>exhaust</b> in combination with ad-gases (e. g. NO/NO 2, NH 3 /HC/H 2) preferably in combination with flow restriction. The system is capable of collecting various types of data including flows, temperatures and concentrations (gas phase components as well as PM). The reactor system can thus decouple the phenomena connected to residence time, temperature and gas composition which is of significant value. Significance By performing catalysis research at both scales, improved quality is achieved e. g. by: Relevant issues from the full scale can be pursued at the lab scale and findings from the lab scale can be precisely reproduced at the full scale. This kind of research bridges between the two research areas of Heterogeneous catalysis and Internal Combustion engine research. Research is planned in collaboration with industry (member companies of the competence centre for catalysis, KCK at Chalmers) and will contribute to more efficient development of aftertreatment systems...|$|R
