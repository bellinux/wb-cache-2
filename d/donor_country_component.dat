30|$|We {{now turn}} our {{attention}} to the in-space placebo study which artificially reassigns the reunification to all <b>donor</b> <b>countries,</b> thus treating Germany as a <b>donor</b> <b>country,</b> while at the same time, one of the <b>donor</b> <b>countries</b> takes the role of the treated unit. To evaluate the results, one calculates the ratios of post-treatment differences between actual and synthetic GDP values over corresponding pre-treatment differences. The results are displayed in Fig.  4 which, as a special case, contains Fig. 5 of Abadie et al. (2015). We find rather large ranges of ratios for some countries (Germany, Norway, the USA, Spain, Switzerland, the UK, and the Netherlands), and small to (almost) no ranges of ratios for other countries 13. In line with our heuristic rule of thumb, the countries with large ranges are characterized by rather small numbers of <b>donor</b> <b>countries</b> contributing in the training period: Switzerland (one <b>donor</b> <b>country),</b> the USA, Portugal, Spain (two <b>donor</b> <b>countries),</b> the UK, the Netherlands, Japan (three <b>donor</b> <b>countries),</b> and Norway (four <b>donor</b> <b>countries).</b> The range of ratios is largest for Norway, with a value of 3.28, the average range size is 0.87. Overall, notwithstanding the significant ambiguity of these ratios, the ratio for Germany is by far the largest, indicating that the reunification {{had a significant impact on}} German GDP per capita.|$|R

40|$|The paper {{presents}} a model where the median voter in the <b>donor</b> <b>country</b> determines {{the support of}} foreign aid. It is first established that an individual in the <b>donor</b> <b>country</b> {{is affected by the}} direct benefits (due to altruism) and costs (due to taxes) of giving aid, and by the indirect benefits or costs of a change in the terms of trade. Then it is shown that the latter effect works through changing both the <b>donor</b> <b>country's</b> average income and its distribution of income. Given the stylized facts of a capital-abundant <b>donor</b> <b>country</b> and relatively capital-poor median voter, it is shown how redistribution-of-income effects soften the impact of terms-of-trade changes on the political support for foreign aid...|$|R
40|$|Why do <b>donor</b> <b>countries</b> give foreign aid? The answers {{found in}} the {{literature}} are: (i) because <b>donor</b> <b>countries</b> care for recipient countries (e. g. altruism), and/or (ii) because there exist distortions that make the indirect gains from foreign aid (e. g. terms of trade effects) to be larger than the direct losses. This paper proposes a third answer to the above question, namely that aid is determined through the domestic political process of the <b>donor</b> <b>country.</b> The paper demonstrates how foreign aid affects the <b>donor</b> <b>country</b> 9 ̆ 2 s income distribution and how, in a direct democracy, the majority of voters might benefit from foreign aid giving even though the country 9 ̆ 2 s social welfare is reduced...|$|R

50|$|Tied aid {{is defined}} as project aid {{contracted}} by source to private firms in the <b>donor</b> <b>country.</b> It refers to aid tied to goods and services supplied exclusively by <b>donor</b> <b>country</b> businesses or agencies.

40|$|The present {{paper is}} a first attempt to develop a {{theoretical}} model using a short-term vis- 0 -vis long-term contract framework within which <b>donor</b> <b>countries</b> 2 ̆ 019 endorsement or rejection decision towards the recently proposed International Finance Facility (IFF) is rationalized.

The benefit of this system is in its flexibility. Frontloading aid, on the other hand, as proposed by the IFF proposal, has the benefit of smoothing out the flows over time. In the model presented in this paper, <b>donor</b> <b>countries</b> balance these two contract schemes to determine the endorsement or rejection of the IFF proposal.

40|$|The 1994 International Conference of Population and Development (ICPD) {{established}} {{goals for}} the expansion of population assistance.

Within this model, we find, among other things, that the best response of the developed <b>donor</b> <b>country</b> is to increase aid as the co-financing rate by the recipient country increases.
