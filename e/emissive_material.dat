50|$|In 2012 {{the first}} {{inherently}} stretchable LEC using an elastomeric <b>emissive</b> <b>material</b> (at room temperature) was reported. Dispersing an ionic transition metal complex into an elastomeric matrix enables the fabrication of intrinsically stretchable light-emitting devices that possess large emission areas (∼175 mm2) and tolerate linear strains up to 27% and repetitive cycles of 15% strain. This work demonstrates {{the suitability of}} this approach to new applications in conformable lighting that require uniform, diffuse light emission over large areas.|$|E
50|$|An {{electron}} multiplier is a vacuum-tube structure that multiplies incident charges. In {{a process called}} secondary emission, a single electron can, when bombarded on secondary <b>emissive</b> <b>material,</b> induce emission of roughly 1 to 3 electrons. If an electric potential is applied between this metal plate and yet another, the emitted electrons will accelerate to the next metal plate and induce secondary emission of still more electrons. This can be repeated a number of times, resulting in a large shower of electrons all collected by a metal anode, all having been triggered by just one.|$|E
30|$|In this work, we {{aimed at}} {{investigating}} {{the influence of}} temperatures, exciton concentrations, and electron transportation layers (ETLs) on the excimer emissions. Both excimer and monomer emissions were found to depend strongly on the annealing temperature and the doping concentration. The differences in spectra between the SiBN-based OLEDs with different ETLs have been revealed, while the mobility of ETL was found {{to play an important}} role in determining the distribution of emission intensity. Furthermore, sunlight-like and warm-light WOLEDs with wide-range spectra, using SiBN as the blue excimer <b>emissive</b> <b>material</b> and bis(2 -phenylbenzothiozolato-N,C 2 ′)iridium(acetylacetonate)(bt 2 Ir(acac)) as the yellow <b>emissive</b> <b>material,</b> have been developed.

40|$|We {{fabricated}} {{two kinds}} of white organic light-emitting diodes (WOLEDs); one consisted of two <b>emissive</b> <b>materials</b> of red and blue, and the other of three <b>emissive</b> <b>materials</b> of red, green, and blue. The red and blue <b>emissive</b> <b>materials</b> were phosphorescent. We evaluated the thickness dependence of the CIE coordinate, the external quantum efficiency (EQE), and the luminance by changing the thicknesses of the Ir(btp) 2 acac and FIrpic layers. Samples consisting of three <b>emissive</b> <b>materials</b> revealed the best CIE coordinate and the best EQE in the same sample structure. On the other hand, the samples consisting of two <b>emissive</b> <b>materials</b> revealed the best CIE coordinate and the best EQE in different structures.

30|$|To {{simplify the}} device fabrication, one {{approach}} is to use <b>emissive</b> <b>material</b> known to possess two emissive states: the common monomolecular fluorescence and an additional dimer emission. It is widely known that the excimer states can essentially modify the electronic properties of light-emitting molecular and open up the exceptional possibility to tailor the performance of organic optoelectronic devices [18]. Although the applications of excimer emission have been intensively investigated [19 – 22], very few reports have discussed the dependences of excimer emission for one specific <b>emissive</b> <b>material</b> in thin films and OLEDs. Recently, our group has reported a novel blue emitter material, 4, 4 ′-bis(4 ′′triphenylsilyl) phenyl- 1, 1 ′-binaphthalene (SiBN) with a binaphthyl backbone modified by (4 ′′-triphenylsilyl) group [23]. The photoluminescence (PL) spectra of SiBN showed a monomer emission at 415  nm and an excimer emission at 468  nm, which could fully cover the blue region, thus {{meeting the needs of}} a wide spectrum in WOLEDs. In addition, the high thermal stability of SiBN was demonstrated, showing a high glass transition temperature at 159.3  °C, which could contribute to the stability and eventual efficiencies of the whole device. As a result, it is worth considering SiBN as a promising candidate for blue <b>emissive</b> <b>material</b> in order to fabricate sunlight-like WOLED with high efficiencies and wide-range spectra.|$|E

30|$|Organic {{light-emitting}} diodes (OLEDs) have been energetically investigated for application to flat-panel displays and illumination light sources[1 – 6]. However, the operation lifetime of OLEDs is shorter {{than that of}} inorganic LEDs because OLEDs are strictly affected by the oxidant effect. Very recently, we fabricated organic–inorganic hybrid LEDs in which the active layers consisted of organic <b>emissive</b> <b>materials</b> dispersed in SiO 2 [7, 8]. These novel LEDs exhibit very long operation lifetime because the organic <b>emissive</b> <b>materials</b> in SiO 2 are protected against the oxidant effect[9]. However, the structures of the fabricated organic–inorganic hybrid active layers are still unknown. In this research, we observe them by transmission electron microscope (TEM).|$|R

The materials had solution photoluminescence quantum yields (PLQYs) of up to 55 % at room temperature with Commission Internationale de l’Eclairage co-ordinates of (0. 155, 0. 16). Stronger vibrational coupling was found to lead to an increased non-radiative decay rate and decreased PLQY.

30|$|White organic {{light-emitting}} diodes (WOLEDs) have been aggressively explored for display and solid-state lighting applications {{because of their}} excellent characteristics such as high efficiency, low power consumption, fast switching, and flexibility [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]. In general, there are three types of WOLEDs depending on the employed <b>emissive</b> <b>material,</b> which are all-phosphorescent, all-fluorescent, and hybrid WOLEDs. Among WOLEDs, the utilization of phosphorescent (P) emitters is desirable as phosphors can allow for an up to 100 % efficiency in converting injected charges into emitted photons (both singlet and triplet excitons are harvested), resulting in a theoretical internal quantum efficiency of unity [6, 7, 8, 9, 10]. Unfortunately, until now, no appropriate blue P material could be obtained in terms of lifetime and color stability, restricting the development of all-phosphorescent WOLEDs.|$|E
