500|$|... "Everybody's <b>Got</b> <b>Something</b> <b>to</b> Hide Except Me and My Monkey" [...] {{evolved from}} a jam session, and was {{originally}} untitled. The final mix was sped up by mixing the tape running at 43 hertz {{instead of the usual}} 50. Harrison claimed the title came from one of the Maharishi's sayings (with [...] "and my monkey" [...] added later).|$|E
500|$|Rogan {{writes in}} the book's introduction: [...] "an {{important}} caveat to any serious, well-researched biography or study of Morrison's life is that the reader {{should be aware that}} a number of allegations against the subject cannot be featured in print for legal reasons. The author may feel that the final portrayal is far too flattering in certain places, while the reader who neglects to read between the lines may think the biographer could have been a little more sympathetic at times. Death alone will open this Pandora's box." [...] Morrison himself is quoted on the first page of the book, saying: [...] "Rogan's <b>got</b> <b>something</b> <b>to</b> hide. What's he hiding? I'd like to do a book on him." ...|$|E
500|$|... "Rockist" [...] {{was coined}} in 1981 when English rock {{musician}} Pete Wylie announced his Race Against Rockism campaign, an inversion of [...] "Rock Against Racism". Former NME writer Paul Morley remembers that the [...] "one or two music journalists {{writing in the}} one or two music magazines that existed then were very pleased. I was one of them, and was using the term [...] "rockist" [...] the minute after I read Wylie say it. ... If the idea of rockism confused you, and you lazily thought Pink Floyd were automatically better than Gang of Four, and that good music had stopped with punk, you were a rockist and you were wrong. He explains that [...] "it's <b>got</b> <b>something</b> <b>to</b> do with" [...] the following five points: ...|$|E

500|$|... "Between You and Me" [...] {{is built}} around {{acoustic}} strumming and synthesized drums, courtesy of Scott Williamson. The song begins with acoustic strumming in the key of G major. The song then moves into the key of E major during the verses. [...] "Between You and Me" [...] features a chorus {{that is in the}} key of G major; in addition, the chorus is composed of [...] "boyish lead vocals", [...] "sweet harmonies", and [...] "whirling organs". During the verses, Michael Tait, Kevin Max, and Toby McKeehan take turns singing lead. The second chorus is followed by a melodic breakdown featuring minimalistic guitar and whispered vocals. The song then repeats the line [...] "It's my way to freedom" [...] and [...] "I've <b>got</b> <b>something</b> <b>to</b> say" [...] until the end.|$|E
500|$|... "Express Yourself" [...] {{begins with}} the sound of brass tinkling along, as Madonna chimes the opening line: [...] "Come on girls, do you believe in love? 'Cause I <b>got</b> <b>{{something}}</b> <b>to</b> say about it, And it goes something like this." [...] Handclaps and drum beats start as Madonna moves into the chorus of the song, with a thick vocal texture and high-pitched background singing. The chorus is aided by instrumentation from a saxophone and percussion. Madonna then sings the first verse of the song, as a violin sound is added after she finishes the bridge, [...] "Make you feel like a queen on the throne, make you love it till you never come down", a male voice repeating the last line. A synthesizer is played after the second verse as Madonna continues chanting the words [...] "Express yourself" [...] with background vocals singing [...] "Hey, hey, hey, hey" [...] alongside her.|$|E
500|$|Tracy {{was set to}} star in a {{film version}} of The Yearling for 1942, but on-set {{difficulties}} and bad weather forced the production to close. With {{the end of that}} project, he became available for the new Katharine Hepburn movie, Woman of the Year (1942). Hepburn greatly admired Tracy, calling him [...] "the best movie actor there was". She had wanted him for her comeback vehicle, The Philadelphia Story (1940). Hepburn was delighted that Tracy was available for Woman of the Year, saying [...] "I was just damned grateful he was willing to work with me." [...] The romantic comedy performed well at the box office and received strong reviews. William Boehnel wrote in the New York World-Telegram, [...] "To begin with, it has Katharine Hepburn and Spencer Tracy in the leading roles. This in itself would be enough to make any film memorable. But when you get Tracy and Hepburn turning in brilliant performances to boot, you've <b>got</b> <b>something</b> <b>to</b> cheer about." ...|$|E

500|$|In a {{negative}} review, Darren Gawle of Drop-D magazine criticised the lyrics for their vague observations about obvious truths, stating: [...] "The only shocking thing about Black Eye {{lies in a}} band trying to pass themselves off as Riot Grrls {{when in fact they}} pack as much 'Grrr' as a slightly vexed Yorkshire Terrier." [...] In contrast, Colin Weston of Drowned in Sound commented: [...] "The thing about Fluffy, is they aren't the most lyrically challenging of bands, but their music more then [...] makes up for it, and what they DO say, you understand immediately... not messing about with 'Deep and meaningful' lyrics, these girls have <b>got</b> <b>something</b> <b>to</b> say, and say it the only way they know how... in your face!!!" [...] Although Black Eye was not ranked in the Top 40 of The Village Voices Pazz & Jop critics' poll for 1996, Christgau placed it at number 3 in his own [...] "Dean's List".|$|E
500|$|The {{song was}} {{originally}} titled [...] "Transformer" [...] according to producer and featured guest Swizz Beatz in a September 2009 interview with MTV News. The song {{was set to}} be the first real record that Brown had released since [...] with then-girlfriend Rihanna {{at the beginning of the}} year. Another song [...] "Changed Man", an [...] "apologetic ode to Rihanna" [...] written by Brown, and several other tracks were leaked but Jive Records said the material was old. Swizz Beatz said that Brown had recorded [...] "60 or 70" [...] songs for the album, and that [...] "He's <b>got</b> <b>something</b> <b>to</b> prove." [...] Beatz also commented on Lil Wayne's contribution to the song, saying, [...] ""The Wayne part is just nothing to talk about, He really showed his ass on this one. It's probably the best feature verse since the 'It's Me ' remix. He really went in on the 'Transformer' joint." [...] It was originally supposed released on September 30, 2009, but Brown stated on his Twitter that the song would be released a day early on September 29, 2009.|$|E
500|$|There was a {{consensus}} amongst reviewers that Elite Force {{was the first}} truly successful Star Trek game, standing out from past titles deemed to be mediocre in quality and design. Game Revolution stated that Elite Force managed to [...] "fight off the curse which until now has plagued most Star Trek action games", while IGN enthusiastically proclaimed [...] "Trekkies, rejoice! You've finally <b>got</b> <b>something</b> <b>to</b> be proud of". GamePro further commented that [...] "you don't {{even have to be}} a full-fledged Trekker to appreciate the gaming goodness that Elite Force has to offer". GameSpot put Elite Forces success down to the influence of Half-Life and its expansion , noting that the influence of these games is [...] "evident in Elite Forces level design". GameSpy closed its review by putting Elite Force as one of the year's best first-person shooters, and [...] "almost certainly the best Star Trek game period, a franchise infamous for its string of bad titles". Likewise, PC Gamer UK commended the game as [...] "the best Star Trek game ever, and a first-rate FPS in its own right".|$|E
6000|$|... "Peckham Rye is a {{long way}} off, certainly," [...] added the indignant Mrs. Chalk, after a pause. [...] "It’s a pity you haven’t <b>got</b> <b>something</b> better <b>to</b> think of, at your time of life, too." ...|$|R

500|$|Meyer {{has been}} {{particularly}} well received by female Holby City fans, elevating Irving to sex-symbol status. The Dail Mail Lynda Lee-Potter described him as [...] "devastatingly attractive, brusque and autocratic" [...] and [...] "the kind of domineering, unsmiling hero who made Mills & Boon heroines swoon." [...] Irving {{felt that this was}} [...] "fairly predictable in terms of the nature of Meyer–tough and masterful–combined with the aphrodisiac of power, and the life and death aspects of his job." [...] He commented that he was surprised by the positive reaction to his character, explaining: [...] "He seems to have captured people's imaginations, but it's difficult to put your finger on what he has. I think it's <b>got</b> <b>something</b> <b>to</b> do with being a character who says exactly what he means all the time. He's got integrity, which I admire anyway, and I expect the audience responds to that. Surgeons seem to like him too. I find that particularly gratifying. He's got the courage to do what's right for his work and his patients and not worry about popularity or being liked." [...] Conversely, Irving noted that after assuming the role, members of the public would sometimes [...] "give a kind of shudder" [...] upon encountering him, associating him with his character.|$|E
500|$|The halftime show {{received}} critical acclaim. Said Marc Schneider of Billboard: [...] "It's Madonna Louise Ciccone's world, we're just {{living in}} it". Randall Roberts of the Los Angeles Times wrote {{that although the}} choice of Madonna as halftime-show performer was a subject of discussion, the singer was [...] "defiantly unconcerned with the more conservative red state wing of the football fanbase who'd never be caught dead singing along {{to one of her}} songs ... and her halftime show was pure spectacle by the Cleopatra of the game ... Madonna is Madonna for a reason. And we saw it firsthand Sunday." [...] Chicago Tribune critic Greg Kot called the show an [...] "S party to Ancient Egypt". Along with reminding the audience of her older hits, Madonna had [...] "important career-advancing work to do ... after all, never does anything unless she's <b>got</b> <b>something</b> <b>to</b> sell, and with a new studio album due out in March and a tour to follow, she had plenty on her to-do list". Jon Pareles of The New York Times wrote that although the singer was not as [...] "indefatigable" [...] as she had been, she was a [...] "party girl turned regent: a queen on her throne, a homecoming queen strutting in the bleachers, a church singer fronting a choir". Pareles called Madonna [...] "grown-up", and wrote that she put on a show appropriate for the NFL. Peter Robinson of The Guardian called the performance low-key for the singer, despite the large audience. Robinson wrote that the show's budget would [...] " [...] your average James Cameron effort look like Homes Under the Hammer", and called Madonna's entrance and exit his favorite parts of the show.|$|E
2500|$|In a February 1977 interview, Cosier {{admitted}} [...] "I've got {{doubts about}} my own ability. I'm not convinced I"m a test batsman yet. I've {{got a long way}} to go... At the moment I'm playing one good innings and then three bad ones. I don't know why. Maybe I need to relax myself more of perhaps it's <b>got</b> <b>something</b> <b>to</b> do with attitude. All I know is I'm trying to work on it... I've heard about the things they say about me outside the off stump and to an extent I go along with them... I admit I'm a bit overweight." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "No, it ain’t apples," [...] said Henry hotly; [...] "you {{never get}} more than one idea at a time into that ’ead of yours. Where’s the skipper? I’ve <b>got</b> <b>something</b> {{important}} <b>to</b> tell ’im—something that’ll make ’im dance." ...|$|R

6000|$|Saxton {{appeared}} reflective. [...] "Oh, yes," [...] he said, drily. [...] "The {{trouble is}} that most of them have <b>got</b> <b>something</b> better <b>to</b> do, and I can't think of one who has any special reason for wanting to get even with Devine." ...|$|R
2500|$|The Australian {{government}} {{denied that}} the media ban {{had anything to do}} with itself or the nearing 2007 Australian federal election, with Prime Minister Howard saying [...] "We did not impose the sentence, the sentence was imposed by the military commission and the plea bargain was worked out between the military prosecution and Mr Hicks's lawyers, and the suggestion... that it's <b>got</b> <b>something</b> <b>to</b> do with the Australian election is absurd." [...] Brigadier-General Thomas Hemingway, the legal adviser to the military tribunal convening authority, has since claimed the gag order as his idea. Federal Attorney-General Philip Ruddock stated that Australian law would not prohibit Hicks from speaking to media, although Hicks would be prevented from selling his story.|$|E
2500|$|Rundgren {{participated in}} the Hollywood Bowl's [...] "Beatles Celebration" [...] concert held July 9–11, 2010 along with the Hollywood Bowl Orchestra {{conducted}} by Thomas Wilkins. Featured guests over the three nights also included Patti Austin, Bettye LaVette, Rob Laufer and Brian Stokes Mitchell. He performed [...] "Being for the Benefit of Mr. Kite", outfitted in an outsized top hat, fake walrus mustache, black waistcoat, white gloves and white spats. He amped up the show's rock quotient with [...] "Everybody's <b>Got</b> <b>Something</b> <b>to</b> Hide Except for Me and My Monkey," [...] and took over the guitar solo in [...] "While My Guitar Gently Weeps", which he preceded with a nod to Ringo Starr's 70th birthday (which had been just two nights earlier). Finally, his performance of [...] "A Day in the Life" [...] concluded his set.|$|E
2500|$|During initial {{interrogation}} {{without a}} lawyer, the police used suggestive question techniques to introduce Andersen {{to the idea}} that Viggo Kristiansen was a participant and even the leading force of the crime. The interrogator wrote the following in the police rapport: [...] "I explained for Andersen that the police now knew {{he was one of the}} perpetrators. I also told Andersen about the advantages he would get by explaining everything", and furthermore: [...] "I asked Andersen if he himself could be a victim in some sense since his best buddy Viggo Kristiansen could have been the most active participant. When I said this, it was obvious that Andersen <b>got</b> <b>something</b> <b>to</b> think about. We talked a little bit back and forth about the relationship between Andersen and Kristiansen, and there was no doubt that Kristiansen was the strong one, the one in charge".|$|E
