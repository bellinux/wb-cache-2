These teachings are rather more conventional in tone and have differences in vocabulary and emphasis from the Memorial - which may reflect redaction by several hands. Nevertheless, the Instructions seem to reflect Angela’s teaching, albeit at some remove."No one can be saved without divine light. Divine light causes us to begin and to make progress, and it leads us to the summit of perfection. Therefore <b>if</b> <b>you</b> want to begin and to receive this divine light, pray. <b>If</b> <b>you</b> have begun to make progress, pray. And <b>if</b> <b>you</b> have reached the summit of perfection, and want to be super-illumined so as to remain in that state, pray. <b>If</b> <b>you</b> want faith, pray. <b>If</b> <b>you</b> want hope, pray. <b>If</b> <b>you</b> want charity, pray. <b>If</b> <b>you</b> want poverty, pray. <b>If</b> <b>you</b> want obedience, pray. <b>If</b> <b>you</b> want chastity, pray. <b>If</b> <b>you</b> want humility, pray. <b>If</b> <b>you</b> want meekness, pray. <b>If</b> <b>you</b> want fortitude, pray. <b>If</b> <b>you</b> want any virtue, pray."
