40|$|While {{in vitro}} studies had shown that {{fibroblast}} growth factor 2 (FGF 2) can induce cell death in Ewing tumours, it remained unclear how <b>Ewing</b> <b>tumour</b> cells survive in vivo within a FGF 2 -rich microenvironment. Serum- and integrin-mediated survival signals were, therefore, studied in adherent monolayer and anchorage-independent colony cell cultures. In a panel of <b>Ewing</b> <b>tumour</b> cell lines, either adhesion to collagen or exposure to serum alone only had a minor protective effect against FGF 2. However, both combined led to complete resistance to 5 [*]ng[*]ml− 1 FGF 2 in three of four FGF 2 -sensitive cell lines (RD-ES, RM- 82 and WE- 68), and to an increased survival as compared to other culture conditions in TC- 71 cells. Inhibition studies with LY 294002 demonstrated that the serum signal is mediated via the phosphoinositide 3 -OH kinase/AKT pathway. Thus, <b>Ewing</b> <b>tumour</b> cells escape FGF 2 -induced cell death by modulating FGF 2 signalling. The tumour microenvironment provides the necessary survival signals by integrin-mediated adhesion and soluble serum factor(s). These survival signals warrant further investigation as a potential resistance mechanism to other apoptosis-inducing agents in vivo...|$|E
40|$|Tumours of the Ewing family, which {{comprise}} Ewing's sarcoma and peripheral primitive neuroectodermal tumours, {{are highly}} aggressive and mostly affect children and adolescents. They {{are characterized by}} chromosomal translocations leading to the generation of fusion proteins between EWS (or very rarely FUS) {{and members of the}} E-twenty-six (ETS) family of transcription factors that are capable of transforming cells. EWS/FLI 1, the most frequent fusion, is thought to cause transformation through activation or repression of specific target genes. We present evidence demonstrating that the Wnt inhibitor and β-catenin/T-cell factor (TCF) -responsive gene DICKKOPF- 1 (DKK- 1) is a transcriptional target of EWS/FLI 1, which can inhibit both basal and β-catenininduced transactivation of the DKK- 1 promoter. Moreover, our data indicate that EWS/FLI 1 has a more general effect on β-catenin/TCF-mediated transcription since it can block transactivation of a consensus β-catenin/TCF reporter construct. Consistently, <b>Ewing</b> <b>tumour</b> cells expressing different EWS/ETS translocations cannot engage β-catenin/TCF-dependent transcription, whereas silencing of EWS/FLI 1 restores β-catenin responsiveness in A 673 and RD-ES <b>Ewing</b> <b>tumour</b> cells. Accordingly, gene set enrichment analysis shows that β-catenin/TCF target genes are significantly enriched among genes downregulated by EWS/FLI 1 in the Ewing cell line A 673. Mechanistically, the inhibitory effect of EWS/FLI 1 can be overcome by a constitutively active TCF 4 protein (TCF 4 -VP 16). Moreover, EWS/FLI 1 binds lymphoid enhancer factor 1, a TCF family member, and interferes with its binding to β-catenin, which could explain its negative effect on β-catenin/TCF-mediated transcription. Our results show that EWS/FLI 1 inhibits both DKK- 1 expression as well as β-catenin/TCF-dependent transcription, which could contribute to progression of tumours of the Ewing family. © The Author 2009.

40|$|Although {{greater than}} 50 % of Ewing tumours contain non-random {{cytogenetic}} aberrations {{in addition to}} the pathognomonic 22 q 12 rearrangements, little is known about their prognostic significance. To address this question, tumour samples from 134 <b>Ewing</b> <b>tumour</b> patients were analysed using a combination of classical cytogenetics, comparative genomic and fluorescence in situ hybridisation. The evaluation of the compiled data revealed that gain of chromosome 8 occurred in 52 % of Ewing tumours but was not a predictive factor for outcome. Gain of 1 q was associated with adverse overall survival and event-free survival in all patients, irrespective of whether the tumour was localised or disseminated (overall survival: P= 0. 002 and P= 0. 029; eventfree survival: P= 0. 018 and P= 0. 010). Loss of 16 q was a significant predictive factor for adverse overall survival in all patients (P= 0. 008) and was associated with disseminated disease at diagnosis (P= 0. 039). Gain of chromosome 12 was associated with adverse event-free survival (P= 0. 009) in patients with localised disease. These results indicate that in addition to a 22 q 12 rearrangement confirmation in Ewing tumours it is important to assess the copy number of 1 q and 16 q to identify patients with a higher probability of adverse outcome...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. The {{prognosis}} of high-risk <b>Ewing</b> <b>tumours</b> (HR-ET) remains poor. Melphalan-containing chemotherapy regimens {{are commonly}} applied for HR-ET patients. Moreover, melphalan (Mel) is a promising agent in thermochemotherapy. Therefore, we investigated the single effects, the synergism and the gene regulation of Mel and hyperthermia (HT) in an ET cell line (RD-ES). Dose-dependent cytotoxicity by Mel was demonstrated, which was {{enhanced by the}} concomitant application of HT (42 ˚C for 2 h). Mel, HT and their combination caused a significant activation of caspase- 3. Using the pan-caspase inhibitor z-VAD-fmk, we demonstrated that both stimuli mediated predominantly caspase-dependent cytotoxicity. With cDNA array analysis, 20 out of 198 apoptosis-related genes were identified to be differentially expressed by Mel and/or HT. Although a significant enhancement of three selected genes could not be proven at the protein level in subsequent experiments, this study gives insight into the complex molecular and genetic response of tumour cells to cytotoxic stimulation. <b>Ewing</b> <b>tumours</b> (ET) are the second most frequent bone tumours in childhood and adolescence, with an annual incidence of about 3 cases per million (43). Prognosis depends on tumour volume, tumour site, histological response to chemotherapy and, most importantly, the presence of metastases {{at the time of}} diagnosis. In particular, patients with metastases to bone or bone marrow still have a poor prognosis (43). These patients might benefit from intensification of conventional therapy, for instance by thermochemotherapy. It has been shown that melphalan (Mel) {{is one of the most}} promising agents in thermochemotherapy, as its anticancer effect was effectively enhanced by hyperthermia (HT) i...|$|R
40|$|Transcription {{factors are}} an {{important}} group of proteins. Changes in expression or activity of transcription factors result in diverse and manifold effects on the whole transcriptome of the cell. Therefore transcription factors are of special interest in physiological as well as pathological processes particularly tumour development and progression. In this review we focus on Ets- 1, the prototype of the ETS family of transcription factors. ETS family members play important roles in development, differentiation and proliferation of cells in general and {{they are involved in}} apoptosis and tissue remodelling as well. Most of them are downstream nuclear targets of Ras-MAP kinase signalling and the deregulation of ets genes results in malignant transformation of different cells. Several ets genes are rearranged in human leukaemia, <b>Ewing</b> <b>tumours</b> and prostate cancer to produce chimeric oncoproteins. Furthermore, an aberrant expression of several ets genes is often observed in various types of human malignant tumours. With regard to the involvement of some ETS transcription factors, especially Ets- 1, in malignant transformation and tumour progression (including invasion, metastasis and neoangiogenesis) through transactivation of cancer related genes, they are potential molecular targets for selective cancer therapy. In this review we focus on the roles of Ets- 1 for tumour development and progression with special emphasis on tumour vascularization and invasion. We then discuss specific strategies for Ets- 1 inhibition as a potential tool for cancer treatment...|$|R

Tumour contamination was assessed by reverse transcriptase–polymerase chain reaction (RT–PCR). The files of 88 patients who underwent HDCT followed by PBSC reinfusion were reviewed in detail, and their outcome compared to the PBSC RT–PCR results. Seven of 88 PBSC collections (8 %) contained tumour cells as detected by RT–PCR. Peripheral blood stem cells were collected after a median of five cycles of chemotherapy. No clinical factor predictive of tumour cell contamination of PBSC harvest could be identified.

40|$|Bone {{and soft}} tissue sarcomas are an {{infrequent}} group of tumours. Their prevalence is 4 in 100 000 people/year, making the disease quite rare. Some of these tumours, such as synovial sarcoma, <b>Ewing</b> <b>tumour</b> and osteosarcoma, are more usual in adolescents or in young adults; there are, though, some neoplasias such as leiomyosarcoma or liposarcoma {{that are more}} frequent in patients over 55 years. There {{are more than a}} hundred different types of sarcomas from the histological point of view. This is the main limitation at the time of finding major clinic essays on patients with specific types of sarcomas. From the molecular point of view, these neoplasias are grouped into two main types: (a) sarcomas showing specific genetic alterations and relatively simple karyotypes, and translocations which originate gene fusions (e. g., EWS-FLI 1 in Ewing tumour); or specific genetic mutations (e. g., c-kit in the gastrointestinal stromal tumour), and (b) sarcomas showing unspecific gene alterations and very complex karyotypes, and very numerous gains and losses.

40|$|Background Cixutumumab (IMC-A 12), a fully human {{immunoglobulin}} G 1 (IgG 1) monoclonal antibody, exerts preclinical {{activity in}} several sarcoma models {{and may be}} effective {{for the treatment of}} these tumours. Methods In this open-label, multicentre, phase 2 study, patients with previously treated advanced or metastatic rhabdomyosarcoma, leiomyosarcoma, adipocytic sarcoma, synovial sarcoma or <b>Ewing</b> family of <b>tumours</b> received intravenous cixutumumab (10 mg/kg) for 1 h every other week until disease progression or discontinuation. The primary end-point was the progression-free survival rate (PFR), defined as stable disease or better at 12 weeks. In each tier of disease histology, Simon's optimum 2 -stage design was applied (PFR at 12 weeks P 0 = 20 %, P 1 = 40 %, α = 0. 10, β = 0. 10). Stage 1 enrolled 17 patients in each disease group/tier, with at least four patients with stable disease or better required at 12 weeks to proceed to stage 2. Results A total of 113 patients were enrolled; all tiers except adipocytic sarcoma were closed after stage 1 due to futility. The 12 -week PFR was 12 % for rhabdomyosarcoma (n = 17), 14 % for leiomyosarcoma (n = 22), 32 % for adipocytic sarcoma (n = 37), 18 % for synovial sarcoma (n = 17) and 11 % for <b>Ewing</b> family of <b>tumours</b> (n = 18). Median progression-free survival (weeks) was 6. 1 for rhabdomyosarcoma, 6. 0 for leiomyosarcoma, 12. 1 for adipocytic sarcoma, 6. 4 for synovial sarcoma and 6. 4 for <b>Ewing</b> family of <b>tumours.</b> Among all patients, the most frequent treatment-emergent adverse events (AEs) were nausea (26 %), fatigue (23 %), diarrhoea (23 %) and hyperglycaemia (20 %). Conclusions Patients with adipocytic sarcoma may benefit from treatment with cixutumumab.

40|$|<b>Ewing</b> <b>tumours</b> (ET), {{including}} Ewing's sarcoma and peripheral primitive neuroectodermal tumour, {{are well}} characterised {{at the molecular}} level by a unique chromosomal rearrangement which fuses the EWS gene to one of two closely related ETS proto-oncogenes, FLI- 1 or ERG. Expression of the resulting chimaeric transcripts can be readily detected by reversed transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). This approach led to the identification of a number of different exon combinations at the junction site of coding sequences. The physiological consequences of the observed variability in the hinge region of EWS chimaeric proteins are not known. We have analysed tumour-derived material from 30 ET patients with well-documented clinical course (18 with localised and 12 with metastatic disease at diagnosis) for the presence of EWS/FLI- 1 or EWS/ERG RNA. Karyotypes were obtained in 21 out of 27 cases and analysed by routine cytogenetics. A chromosome 22 rearrangement was demonstrated in 18 cases (67 %). In contrast, RT-PCR revealed the presence of chimaeric transcripts in 28 tumours (93 %), with fusions of EWS exon 7 to FLI- 1 exons 6 (19 / 28), 5 (4 / 28) and 7 (1 / 28). In addition, EWS/FLI- 1 exon combinations 10 / 5 and 9 / 4 were observed in one case each. In the last tumour, the presence of at least four additional splicing variants corresponding to fusion of EWS exon 7 to FLI- 1 exons 4, 6, 8 and 9 was demonstrated. Two tumours expressed EWS/ERG fusion transcripts involving EWS exon 7 and ERG exon 6. In this study, EWS/FLI- 1 exon combinations 7 / 6 (type I) predominated over 7 / 5 (type II) in localised ET (14 versus 1) and were more abundant in tumours affecting the long bones (9 versus 0), whereas in central axis tumours and metastatic disease there was only little difference in the frequency of the two types. So far, no correlations between different chimaeric EWS transcripts and any other clinical parameters have been identified...|$|R

40|$|SummaryIntroductionBone reconstruction, after periacetabular tumour removal, is {{a complex}} {{procedure}} that carries a high morbidity rate and can result in poor clinical outcomes. Among the available options, the Puget pelvic resection-reconstruction procedure uses an autograft from the ipsilateral proximal femur to restore the anatomical and mechanical continuity of the pelvic ring before inserting an acetabular implant. Hypothesis and goalsThis reconstruction technique satisfactorily restores the pelvic anatomy such that functional results and morbidity are comparable to alternative reconstruction techniques. Patients and methodsThis was a retrospective study of 10 patients {{with an average age}} of 38. 2 years (range 19 to 75) at the surgical procedure (performed between 1986 and 2007). There were five chondrosarcomas, three <b>Ewing</b> <b>tumours,</b> one plasmacytoma and one giant cell tumour. The position of the hip centre of rotation after reconstruction and autograft integration were evaluated on radiographs. Functional results were evaluated through the Musculoskeletal Tumor Society (MSTS) score and the Postel and Merle d’Aubigné (PMA) score. ResultsAt the time of review, one patient was lost to follow-up and four had died. On radiographs, the hip centre of rotation after reconstruction was higher by a median value of 15 mm (range 5 to 35) and more lateral by a median value of 6 mm (range − 5 to 15). Upon evaluation of radiographs at a median time of 40 months (range 6 to 252 months), the autograft was completely integrated in five patients and partially integrated in three patients (two patients had a local recurrence). There were no cases of autograft fracture or non-union at the junctions of the graft. The median MSTS score was 25 out of 30 (range 20 to 29), or 83 % (range 67 to 97 %) at the median clinical follow-up of 82 months (range 49 to 264). The median PMA score was 13 out of 18 (range 12 to 18). All living patients were walking without assistance. Five patients required nine surgical revisions. Seven were attributed directly or indirectly to local recurrence; one revision was performed because of instability and one because of early acetabular loosening at 9 months. ConclusionThis challenging procedure provides satisfactory mechanical and anatomical results, while restoring hip anatomy and function. The primary cause of failure in this series was local recurrence of the tumour, which highlights the need to carefully select the indications and optimize the surgical tumour resection.

Methods Retrospective review of 16 patients treated at a single centre with VDC/IE.

30|$|In conclusion, we {{described}} in this case series of 18 primary intrathoracic malignant mesenchymal tumours some frequent radiological features, independent of tumour location. These features are not characteristic for other more common neoplasms affecting the thoracic cavity, originating from pleuropulmonary (bronchogenic carcinomas, mesotheliomas) or mediastinal (thymoma, lymphoma) tissue. A sarcoma should be included as a major differential diagnosis when the radiologist faces an intrathoracic mass of large size (> 70  mm) but with well-defined smooth or lobulated margins, especially if containing identifiable vessels inside the tumour, associated pleural effusion but no significant lymphadenopathy. Some tumours may even present more specific features, e.g. the intraluminal tumoural component of primary pulmonary artery sarcoma, a large mass with discrete rib erosion in a younger patient with <b>Ewing</b> sarcoma family <b>tumour,</b> and fatty tissue typical attenuation (on CT) or signal intensity (on MRI) of the liposarcoma.|$|R

Two resected tumours were treated with neo-adjuvant chemotherapy prior to surgery and showed partial response (necrosis). The four patients with diagnosis based on biopsy were not submitted to surgery and treated with primary radio-chemotherapy, but all them evolved with progressive disease, and only one was still doing clinical follow-up in our hospital. Among all 18 patients, one (6  %) had a fatal outcome documented in our clinical records (tumour-related death, 4  months after surgery)—the patient with a resected mediastinal leiomyosarcoma. Ten (56  %) patients presented unfavourable evolution of the disease, with stable or progressive disease despite adopted treatment, and three among these patients were still being treated/followed in our hospital {{at the time of}} the last review of the records. One (6  %) patient with a pulmonary synovial sarcoma had a partial response to first sessions of adjuvant chemotherapy until the last control in our institution, and it was decided to continue with the therapy scheme. Six out of 18 patients (33  %) presented a favourable outcome, with complete response to therapy and no complications after surgery, and uneventful follow-up. The complete response group (cured patients) included the patients with Ewing sarcoma and PNET (<b>Ewing</b> sarcoma <b>tumour</b> family), as well as both patients with resected SFT.|$|R
30|$|One Ewing sarcoma and one PNET were {{described}} in this series, in adult patients, aged 31 and 34  years, respectively (Fig.  5). Both lesions were radiologically described as intrathoracic pleural/wall based large masses, but only the PNET with associated rib erosion. Chest wall PNETs, also named Askin tumours, were previously classified as a separate group of neoplasms, but now are mostly accepted as an aggressive form of Ewing sarcoma, both representing the most common malignant tumours of the chest wall in children [3]. It was already described that this family of tumours, when originating from extraskeletal sites, occur in relatively older patients and may present as well-circumscribed, non-calcified masses, without the involvement of bone marrow (the hallmark of an osseous origin) [21]. Even though, finding of a large and heterogeneous mass with discrete rib destruction in a young patient is highly suspicious for a <b>Ewing</b> sarcoma family <b>tumour</b> [22].

30|$|The use of 18 F-FDG PET-CT in staging, restaging and {{assessment}} of therapy response in patients with Ewing sarcoma is increasing worldwide even though the method at present is not considered a standard examination in the diagnostic work-up of these patients (Group EESNW, 2014; Biermann et al., 2017). PET imaging with 18 F-FDG depicts upregulated glucose metabolism in cancer cells in Ewing sarcoma {{as well as in}} other solid tumours. Maximum standard uptake value (SUVmax) in <b>Ewing</b> sarcoma <b>tumours</b> is highly variable ranging from 3 to 21 (Charest et al., 2009) and 2 – 11 (Quartuccio et al., 2015) in different series. Highly aggressive, fast growing tumours (higher -grade tumours) usually demonstrate more intense 18 F-FDG uptake than lower grade tumours. This can be used to target biopsy to the most metabolic active area of a given tumour and to characterise indeterminate lesions (Lakkaraju et al., 2010). In a recently published study, Palmerini et al., found that SUVmax of primary tumours predicted outcome (event free survival) in patients with Ewing sarcoma and they suggest that it may be used as a prognostic factor along with other prognostic factors such as tumour size, localisation of primary tumour and patient age (Palmerini et al., 2017). Dedicated paediatric PET-CT protocols which include individual weight-based activities of 18 F-FDG (Lassmann & Treves, 2014) and low dose CT, are established at all the PET sites in Norway. Despite using child specific PET-CT protocols, patients will receive an effective radiation dose of 8  mSv to 13  mSv from a single investigation (Alessio et al., 2009), the CT component contributing to 40 %.|$|R

40|$|Background: Ewing sarcoma is {{a primary}} bone neoplasm, which is a high grade {{aggressive}} small round blue cell tumour, and is currently recognized {{as a part of}} the <b>Ewing</b> family of <b>tumours.</b> It is the most lethal bone tumor, and is a rare malignant bone tumor accounting for 10 % of all primary bone tumors, and 6 % of malignant bone tumors. It has an average annual incidence of 3 per 1 million, found almost exclusively in Caucasians. It commonly occurs in long bones and pelvis but rarely involves the scapula. 85 % of cases have metastasis within 2 years of diagnosis, rarely involving the meninges. Case presentation: We report a case of a 25 year old Sinhalese Sri Lankan female, presenting with a 1 day history of bilateral lower limb weakness and urinary incontinence. She had a sensory level with flaccid paralysis of lower limbs and a painless bony lump in the left dorsal scapula. Investigations showed scapular primary Ewing sarcoma giving rise to spinal intradural metastasis.

Southern blot analysis of the specimen with high-level amplification at 1 q 21 - 22 showed an amplification of FLG and SPRR 3, both mapped to this region. All cases with a gain of chromosome 12 simultaneously showed a gain of chromosome 8. Comparison of CGH findings with cytogenetic analysis of the same tumours and previous cytogenetic reports of ET showed, in general, concordant results. In conclusion, our findings confirm that secondary changes, which may have prognostic significance in ET, are trisomy 8, trisomy 12 and a gain of DNA sequences in 1 q...|$|R
40|$|Primary extraosseous Ewing sarcomas (EESs) are an {{extremely}} rare pathological entity. Less than 32 {{cases have been}} reported in the literature. Here we report an uncommon case with very rapid progression in the cervical region with extra- and intradural involvement. We present a thorough review of the literature and discuss possible treatment modalities. The Medline database was searched using the search terms: <b>Ewing</b> sarcoma, extraosseus <b>tumour,</b> treatment, management, cervical spine. A previously healthy 29 -year-old man complained of right-sided radiculopathy (C 7). Magnetic resonance imaging showed an enhancing foraminal, sandglass shaped neurinoma- like lesion. Surgery revealed an intraand extra-dural lesion, which was histologically diagnosed as Ewing sarcoma. Despite gross total resection, there was a massive symptomatic tumor recurrence within 6 weeks. A second gross total resection was realized. The patient was treated according to the EURO E. W. I. N. G. -Protocol (VIDE) and recovered very well (progression-free interval during therapy). Several decompressive re-surgeries were realized with adjuvant radio-chemotherapy. At the last follow-up (17 months after initial surgery) the patient was in remission with a good quality of live. This case is to illustrate that despite extensive therapeutic efforts, the progression- free survival in case of primary EES may be very short. To maintain neurological function and good quality of live as long as possible, a multimodal strategy seems to be adequate. Like in the present case this implies several surgeries and adjuvant chemo-and radiotherapy. Whether this improves overall survival remains unclear...|$|R
40|$|AIMS: The {{localisation}} of the translocation breakpoint of the Ewing sarcoma {{family of}} tumours shows significant variability on relatively large regions of fusion partner genes. As a consequence, many {{alternative forms of}} EWSR 1 -ETS translocation exist which make the RNA-based molecular diagnostics of Ewing sarcoma family of tumours complicated. In addition to the heterogeneity of fusion transcripts, the degradation of RNA also presents a significant difficulty in the molecular analysis of formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded (FFPE) tissues. Our aim was to establish a sensitive method which is able to identify all combinatorially possible EWSR 1 -FLI 1 and EWSR 1 -ERG translocation transcripts in FFPE tissue samples despite significant RNA-degradation. METHODS: The combination of fluorescent multiplex PCR with laser-induced capillary electrophoresis was used to detect and identify EWSR 1 -FLI 1 and EWSR 1 -ERG chimeric transcripts {{on the basis of}} amplicon size, and forward primers labelled by distinct fluorophores. RESULTS: Using this method, we processed 60 FFPE samples of Ewing sarcoma family of tumours, and identified six types EWSR 1 -FLI 1 and one type EWSR 1 -ERG chimeric transcripts acceptable for RT-PCR analysis in 27 out of 45 samples. This result shows 60 % sensitivity for detecting the most frequent <b>Ewing</b> family of <b>tumour</b> (EFT) -related fusion transcripts. CONCLUSIONS: The utilisation of fluorescent multiplex PCR and laser-induced fluorescent capillary electrophoresis is effective for the diagnosis of EFT in FFPE tissue, and after the defined modifications it can offer a sensitive method to overcome the diagnostic difficulties connected with heterogeneity of the variant translocations in EFT...|$|R
40|$|Background: <b>Ewing</b> Sarcoma Family <b>Tumours</b> (ESFT) {{are rare}} in early childhood. The {{aim of this}} study was to report the {{clinical}} characteristics and outcome of children under 6 years of age affected by ESFT of the bone in Italy. Methods: The records of all the children diagnosed with osseous ESFT in centres members of the Associazione Italiana di Ematologia ed Oncologia Pediatrica (AIEOP) from 1990 to 2008 were reviewed. The Kaplan–Meier method was used for estimating overall and progression-free survival (OS, PFS) curves; multivariate analyses were performed using Cox proportional hazards regression model. Results: This study includes 62 patients. An axial primary localization was present in 66 % of patients, with the primary site in the chest wall in 34 %. Fourteen (23 %) patients presented metastatic disease. The 5 -year OS and PFS were 73 % (95 % confidence interval, CI, 58 – 83 %) and 72 % (95 % CI 57 – 83 %) for patients with localized disease and 38 % (95 % CI 17 – 60 %) and 21 % (95 % CI 5 – 45 %) for patients with metastatic disease. Metastatic spread, skull/pelvis/spine primary localization, progression during treatment and no surgery predicted worse survival (P, 0. 01), while patients treated in the last decade had better survival (P = 0. 002). In fact, the 5 -year OS and PFS for patients diagnosed in the period 2000 – 2008 were 89 % (95 % CI 71 – 96 %) and 86 % (95 % CI 66 – 94 %), respectively...|$|R
40|$|Blue cell tumours are {{a diverse}} group that look alike in the H&E stained {{sections}} and are difficult to distinguish from each other except by immunohistochemistry. They include: Desmoplastic small-round-cell tumour, Ewing's Sarcoma/PNET, Neuroblastoma, Medulloblastoma, Rhabdomyosarcoma, Carcinoid tumor, Small cell lung cancer, Wilms' tumour, Retinoblastoma, Small-cell lymphoma and Hepatoblastoma. We have encountered all these in our practice. Because of the long list only some will be discussed. These are <b>Ewing</b> group of <b>tumours</b> and some uncommon but quite interesting members of the other Blue cell tumours. There are 3 main types of Ewing tumors: Ewing sarcoma of bone, Extraosseous Ewing tumor (EOT) and Peripheral primitive neuroectodermal tumor (PPNET). The latter is a rare childhood cancer that involves the brain and can also starts in the bone or soft tissue and shares many features with Ewing sarcoma of bone and EOT. Peripheral PNETs that start in the chest wall are known as Atkin tumors. We used certain immunohistochemical stains to correctly diagnosis these cases. Classic Ewing sarcoma is positive for CD 99, Vimentin but negative for the neural stain S- 100 protein. PPNET has the same markers as Ewing but they are s- 100 and Cytokeratin and/or EMA positive. We had odd sites for Ewing sarcoma such as the Esophagus. Some other interesting small round cell tumours are myelomas. When they have typical appearance of plasma cells the diagnosis is easy. However there is a poorly differentiated plasmacytoma that looked like other blue cell tumours. One was in the spine. It stained positive for the B cell marker CD 20 but was negative for LCA which led us to do immunostaining for plasma proteins. The cells were positive for IgG and negative for Ig A and Ig M. Mature plasma cells of multiple myeloma are negative for CD 20. Diagnosis: Myeloma of the small lymphocyte-like type involving D 11...|$|R
