The hits kept coming, but with less frequency, and were not charting as high as in the '40s. Dinah's biggest hits of this era were [...] "My Heart Cries for You" [...] and [...] "Sweet Violets", both peaking at number three in 1951. Several duets with Tony Martin did well, with [...] "A Penny a Kiss" [...] being the most popular, reaching number eight. [...] "Blue Canary" [...] was a 1953 hit, and her covers of [...] "Changing Partners" [...] and [...] "If <b>I</b> <b>Give</b> <b>My</b> Heart to You" [...] were popular top-20 hits. [...] "Love and Marriage" [...] and [...] "Whatever Lola Wants" [...] were top-20 hits from 1955.|$|E
2500|$|Sacco and Vanzetti went {{on trial}} for their lives in Dedham, Massachusetts, May 21, 1921, at Dedham, Norfolk County for the Braintree robbery and murders. [...] Webster Thayer again presided; he had asked to be {{assigned}} to the trial. Katzmann again prosecuted for the State. Vanzetti was represented by brothers Jeremiah and Thomas McAnraney. Sacco was represented by Fred H. Moore and William J. Callahan. The choice of Moore, a former attorney for the Industrial Workers of the World, proved a key mistake for the defense. A notorious radical from California, Moore quickly enraged Judge Thayer with his courtroom demeanor, often doffing his jacket and once, his shoes. Reporters covering the case were amazed to hear Judge Thayer, during a lunch recess, proclaim, [...] "I'll show them that no long-haired anarchist from California can run this court!" [...] and later, [...] "You wait till <b>I</b> <b>give</b> <b>my</b> charge to the jury. I'll show them." [...] Throughout the trial, Moore and Thayer clashed repeatedly over procedure and decorum.|$|E
2500|$|In {{their earlier}} appeals, {{the defense was}} limited to the trial record. The Governor's Committee, however, was not a {{judicial}} proceeding, so Judge Thayer's comments outside the courtroom could be used to demonstrate his bias. Once Thayer told reporters that [...] "No long-haired anarchist from California can run this court!" [...] According to the affidavits of eyewitnesses, Thayer also lectured members of his clubs, calling Sacco and Vanzetti [...] "Bolsheviki!" [...] and saying he would [...] "get them good and proper". During the Dedham trial's first week, Thayer said to reporters: [...] "Did you ever see a case in which so many leaflets and circulars have been spread...saying people couldn't get a fair trial in Massachusetts? You wait till <b>I</b> <b>give</b> <b>my</b> charge to the jury, I'll show them!" [...] In 1924, Thayer confronted a Massachusetts lawyer at Dartmouth, his alma mater, and said: [...] "Did you see what I did with those anarchistic bastards the other day. I guess that will hold them for a while.... Let them go to the Supreme Court now and see what they can get out of them." [...] The Committee knew that, following the verdict, Boston Globe reporter Frank Sibley, who had covered the trial, wrote a protest to the Massachusetts attorney general condemning Thayer's blatant bias. Thayer's behavior both inside the courtroom and outside of it had become a public issue, with the New York World attacking Thayer as [...] "an agitated little man looking for publicity and utterly impervious to the ethical standards one has the right to expect of a man presiding in a capital case." ...|$|E
