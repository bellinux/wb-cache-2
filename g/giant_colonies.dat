40|$|During their {{development}} and aging on solid substrates, yeast <b>giant</b> <b>colonies</b> produce ammonia, which {{acts as a}} quorum sensing molecule. Ammonia production is connected with alkalization of the surrounding medium and with extensive reprogramming of cell metabolism. In addition, ammonia signaling is important for both horizontal (colony centre versus colony margin) and vertical (upper versus lower cell layers) colony differentiations. The centre of an aging differentiated giant colony is thus composed of two major cell subpopulations, the subpopulation of long-living, metabolically active and stress-resistant cells that form the upper layers of the colony and the subpopulation of stress-sensitive starving cells in the colony interior. Here, we show that microcolonies originating from one cell pass through similar developmental phases as <b>giant</b> <b>colonies.</b> Microcolony differentiation is linked to ammonia signaling, and cells similar to {{the upper and lower}} cells of aged <b>giant</b> <b>colonies</b> are formed even in relatively young microcolonies. A comparison of the properties of these cells revealed a number of features that are similar in microcolonies and <b>giant</b> <b>colonies</b> as well as a few that are only typical of chronologically aged <b>giant</b> <b>colonies.</b> These findings show that colony age per se is not crucial for colony differentiation...|$|E
40|$|SUMMARY: An {{apparatus}} {{was designed}} to photograph colonies of micro-organisms on Petri dishes either under conditions of dark-field illumination or of top-lighting. It serves to reveal any motility of the organisms and is valuable {{as an aid to}} identi-fication, particularly in the genus Acetobacter, members of which have characteristic <b>giant</b> <b>colonies.</b> Recently (1949) we recorded particulars of <b>giant</b> <b>colonies</b> of Acetobacter species which had been grown on a semi-solid medium. In such conditions certain species, e. g., A. aceti (Kiitzing) Beijerinck, form highly characteristic colonies. Other species, including the majority of the known species of Acetobacter, characterized by colonies of a particular type, can be classified in a number of groups. Species which form cellulose, e. g. A. xylinum (Brown) Holland, A. kutzingianum (Hansen) Bergey et al., A. acetigenum (Henneberg) Bergey et al. belong to one group.

40|$|Production {{of ammonia}} by the colonies of mutants and aging of {{wrinkled}} colonies of Saccharomyces cerevisiae The {{aim of this}} diploma thesis is to observe the development, respectively the aging of cells in yeast colonies Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Yeast cells S. cerevisiea form multicellular organized structures on a solid substrate, i. e. colonies, which the intercellular interactions occur in. These interactions influence forming, morphology and aging of yeast colonies. This diploma thesis is focused partly on the changes in ammonia production by <b>giant</b> <b>colonies</b> of deletion mutants and partly on the aging of colonies with the wrinkled morphology. I characterized mutant strains of S. cerevisiae with the deletion in RTG 1, RTG 2, RTG 3, FIS 1, CIT 2 genes. Their products {{play an important role}} in the colony development.

40|$|Staphylococcus aureus forms <b>giant</b> <b>colonies</b> on soft-agar surfaces, {{which is}} called colony-spreading. In the present study, we searched for host factors that {{influence}} S. aureus colony-spreading activity. The addition of calf serum, porcine serum, or silkworm hemolymph to soft-agar medium stimulated S. aureus colony-spreading activity. Gel filtration column chromatography of calf serum produced a high molecular weight fraction and a low molecular weight fraction, both of which exhibited colony-spreading stimulatory activity. In the low molecular weight fraction, we identified the stimulatory factor as bovine serum albumin. The stimulatory fraction in the high molecular weight fraction was identified as high-density lipoprotein (HDL) particles. Delipidation of HDL abolished the stimulatory activity of HDL. Phosphatidylcholine, which is the major lipid component in HDL particles, stimulated the colony-spreading activity. Other phosphatidylcholine-containing lipoprotein particles, low-density lipoprotein and very low-density lipoprotein, also showed colony-spreading stimulatory activity. These findings suggest that S. aureus colony-spreading activity is stimulated by albumin and lipoprotein particles in mammalian serum...|$|E

Protoplasts from such cultures were prepared and regenerated on solid medium to obtain colonies from single cell units. Frequencies of auxotrophs and high alkaloid producers were on the order of 1 to 2 %. Some of the auxotrophic mutants derived from strain ATCC 20102 were constantly segregating prototrophs. High-alkaloid-producing derivatives showed sclerotia-like morphology and violet-brown pigmentation, in contrast to the parent strain; some of them also showed segregation sectors when grown as <b>giant</b> <b>colonies.</b> Mutagenesis of strain 1029, isolated during this study and having an increased level of alkaloid synthesis and sclerotia-like cell morphology, was done in the same fashion as with the original parent strain, ATCC 20102.

40|$|Competition {{is a very}} {{important}} natural phenomenon, which causes the rivalry of organisms, in cases such as space limitation or lack of nutrients. It occurs mainly in situations where organisms, including microorganisms live in large populations. Multicellular yeast colonies represent an example of such a population. After the population of yeast cells spends nutrients from the environment, the cells in colonies are able to respond to these changes by production of ammonia functioning as a signaling molecule. Subsequently, the cells are able to change their morphology and metabolism and, dependently on their location within the colony, to create a subpopulation of cells with specific characteristics and functions. It is likely {{that in the case of}} mixed colonies formed by the two different strains, a competition between the cells of these two strains could exist. Such rivalry can result in changes in the ratio of cells of the two strains within the colony population, so that the cells of one strain outweigh the other.

At present, the number of available antifungal agents in the clinic is limited, and most of them, such as itraconazole (ICZ), are toxic and show resistance. Berberine (BER) is a plant alkaloid used in the clinic mainly for alimentary infections. We have used BER and ICZ to measure in vitro resistance in A. fumigatus isolated from clinical patients. The minimum inhibitory concentration ranges of BER and ICZ were 4 – 256 and 0. 031 – 0. 250 μg/mL, respectively. In addition, against A. fumigatus IFM 40808 strain, the MIC 50 values of BER and ICZ were 8 and 0. 125 μg/mL.

In the pathogenic yeast species Candida albicans and Cryptococcus neoformans the PI 3 K signalling pathway is required for virulence. In the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae the PI 3 K signalling pathway consists of two proteins - phosphatidylinositol- 3 -kinase, Vps 34 p and its regulator Vps 15 p.

Deletion of VPS 34 or VPS 15 also increases sensitivity of cells to oxidative stress and detergents. Attempts to delete VPS 34 in natural strains were unsuccesful, probably because VPS 34 is essential in these strains. Constitutive expression of VPS 34 does not affect cell resistance in inhibitory tests, the size and differentiation of colonies or ammonia signalling but differences are notable in <b>giant</b> <b>colony</b> morphology and in patterns of invasiveness of the medium.

At the League of Nations in Geneva the Japanese actions were condemned. Japan left the League accusing the Western powers of hypocrisy. In Japan, in face of growing economic depression {{and a sense of}} the West's double standards, the call was to expand even further and conquer more territory within Asia. By 1937 the Japanese army was five times what it had been around 1900. Many in the military thought that in an army that had grown so much, to maintain discipline, it was necessary to make the training of recruits more brutal. If the soldiers made the smallest mistake they were beaten, with fists or bamboo sticks. Recruits were instructed also to hit each other. And the Japanese military did not just want to mould their own soldiers but the general population too. Japanese who adopted western values were ridiculed, women who rejected a tradition of subservience were attacked. Many ordinary Japanese, as well as politicians and businesspeople, now supported the drive toward a bigger empire on the Asian mainland, and the minority who openly opposed military expansion risked assassination. Seven prominent Japanese, including two Prime Ministers, were murdered by army officers during the 1930s. Seeking to create a <b>giant</b> <b>colony</b> the Imperial army moved in 1937 into eastern China. The Chinese were not worthy of the land according to the dominant ideology; they were called bugs, animals, below-human. Yoshio Tsuchiya, (Japanese Secret Military Police):" [...] The Chinese were inferior - didn't belong to the human race. That was the way we looked at it." [...] In December 1937 the Japanese Army reached the then capital of China, Nanking. (Film taken by John Magee is shown). Men were set on fire, women beaten, bayoneted, raped. After Nanking atrocities followed in the Chinese countryside - the Chinese used for bayonet practice. Yoshio Tsuchiya (imprisoned 1950-56 for war crimes): [...] " [...] The first time you still have a conscience and feel bad, but if you are honoured and given merit and praised, that will be the driving power for the second time - after the second time I didn't feel anything." [...] A soldier is asked why he felt no guilt or shame raping and killing women. He replies : [...] " [...] Because I was fighting for the emperor. He was a god; {{in the name of the}} emperor we could do whatever we wanted against the Chinese." [...] Meanwhile the god-emperor of Japan spent most of his time secluded behind the walls of his palace. Even today opinion is divided among historians as to the extent the emperor knew of the barbaric crimes his soldiers were committing in China. [...] " [...] What is certain is that no evidence has surfaced that he ever attempted to hold his soldiers to account for their vicious conduct in China" [...] Rees's film concludes.|$|R
40|$|For elusive mammals like bats, {{colonization}} of new areas and colony formation are poorly understood, as is {{their relationship with}} the genetic structure of populations. Understanding dispersal and group formation behaviors is critical not only for a better comprehension of mammalian social dynamics, but also for guiding conservation efforts of rare and endangered species. Using nuclear and mitochondrial markers, we studied patterns of genetic diversity and differentiation among and within breeding <b>colonies</b> of <b>giant</b> noctule bats (Nyctalus lasiopterus), their relation to a new colony still in formation, and the impact of this ongoing process on the regionwide genetic makeup. Nuclear differentiation among colonies was relatively low and mostly nonsignificant. Mitochondrial variation followed this pattern, contrasting with findings for other temperate bat species. Our results suggest that this may indicate a recent population expansion. On average, female giant noctules were not more closely related to other colony members than to foreign individuals. This was also true for members of the newly forming colony and those of another, older group sampled shortly after its formation, suggesting that contrary to findings for other temperate bats, <b>giant</b> noctule <b>colonies</b> are not founded by relatives. However, mother–daughter pairs were found in the same populations more often than expected under random dispersal. Given this indication of philopatry, the lack of mitochondrial differentiation among most colonies in the region is probably due to the combination of a recent population expansion and group formation events.

40|$|Purpose: A {{cell line}} spontaneously derived from human retinal pigment {{epithelium}} (hRPE) was cultured on alginate film gelatinized with different concentrations of neurobasal cell culture medium (NCCM) to assess its growth and morphological behavior on this naturally occurring polysaccharide. Methods: Neonatal human globes were used to isolate hRPE cells. They were cultured in Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s‑medium‑and‑Ham’s‑F 12 ‑medium‑(DMEM/F 12) supplemented with 10 % fetal bovine serum (FBS). Cultures were continuously studied using phase contrast microscopy. After the nineth passage, cells were characterized through immunocytochemical analysis for Oct 4, Chx 10, and Pax 6 and Ki 67 markers. In each well of a 6 ‑well microplate, 1 and 2 % weight/volume (w/v) alginate in deionized water was added and gelatinized using 1 × and 10 × NCCM. hRPE cells were cultured at a density of 2 × 105 cells/well in alginate‑coated microplates. After 5 days, hRPE colonies were harvested and re‑plated on polystyrene substrates. Morphology and growth of hRPE cultures were determined during the next 2 weeks. Results: The first few passages of the cultures were purely hRPE cells that revealed typical morphological features of the pigmented epithelium. They made spaces, devoid of cells, between hRPE cell monolayer and fill in the unoccupied spaces. They grew faster than native RPE cells and rapidly overgrew. Immunocytochemical test revealed that the founded cells expressed Chx 10, Pax 6, Ki 67 and Oct 4. The hRPE cells survived unlimitedly on alginate film and formed <b>giant</b> adjoining <b>colonies.</b> After re‑plating, hRPE colonies adhered quickly on polystyrene and displayed native hRPE morphological features. Conclusion: Alginate film can support the survival and growth of hRPE cells and induce the cells to re‑organize in tissue‑like structures...|$|R
40|$|Shimmering is a {{collective}} defence behaviour in Giant honeybees (Apis dorsata) whereby individual bees flip their abdomen upwards, producing Mexican wave-like {{patterns on the}} nest surface. Bucket bridging {{has been used to}} explain the spread of information in a chain of members including three testable concepts: first, linearity assumes that individual "agent bees" that participate in the wave will be affected preferentially from the side of wave origin. The directed-trigger hypothesis addresses the coincidence of the individual property of trigger direction with the collective property of wave direction. Second, continuity describes the transfer of information without being stopped, delayed or re-routed. The active-neighbours hypothesis assumes coincidence between the direction of the majority of shimmering-active neighbours and the trigger direction of the agents. Third, the graduality hypothesis refers to the interaction between an agent and her active neighbours, assuming a proportional relationship in the strength of abdomen flipping of the agent and her previously active neighbours. Shimmering waves provoked by dummy wasps were recorded with high-resolution video cameras. Individual bees were identified by 3 D-image analysis, and their strength of abdominal flipping was assessed by pixel-based luminance changes in sequential frames. For each agent, the directedness of wave propagation was based on wave direction, trigger direction, and the direction of the majority of shimmering-active neighbours. The data supported the bucket bridging hypothesis, but only for a small proportion of agents: linearity was confirmed for 2. 5 %, continuity for 11. 3 % and graduality for 0. 4 % of surface bees (but in 2. 6 % of those agents with high wave-strength levels). The complimentary part of 90 % of surface bees did not conform to bucket bridging. This fuzziness is discussed in terms of self-organisation and evolutionary adaptedness in <b>Giant</b> honeybee <b>colonies</b> to respond to rapidly changing threats such as predatory wasps scanning in front of the nest...|$|R
5000|$|Now 26 years old, Saki {{works for}} the village {{government}} in the [...] "Department of Mutant Management" [...] which oversees the Monster Rats. Yakomaru's colony slowly ascends to power while conquering other colonies and wiping out the <b>Giant</b> Hornet <b>colony,</b> eventually attacking Kamisu 66 with what {{is believed to be}} an Ogre that the Monster Rats refer to as their [...] "Messiah." [...] This is later revealed to be the biological child of Mamoru and Maria who Yakomaru raised after murdering the parents. After evading the Ogre and learning that Yakomaru intends to steal more human infants to create an army to wipe out the human race, Saki and Satoru are joined by Kiroumaru who guides them to the ruins of Tokyo to find the [...] "Psychobuster"; an anthrax-like anti-psychic weapon. With Yakomaru's forces surrounding them, Satoru attempts to kill the Messiah with the Psychobuster, but Saki destroys the weapon because its use at such close proximity would also have killed Satoru. With seemingly no options left, Saki eventually realizes that the Messiah is not truly an ogre, but actually a regular psychic like themselves, with one key difference: the Messiah considers Monster Rats as his kin which is what enables him to bypass the Death Feedback when attacking other humans. After having admitted his own disdain towards humans and their treatment of his kind, Kiroumaru asks for his colony to be spared the imminent retaliation of the humans against the Monster Rats and agrees to help Saki end the revolt. He disguises himself as a human and attacks the Messiah only to be killed by him, but upon realizing Kiroumaru's true race, the Messiah dies as well due to the Death Feedback response imposed by his kinship with the Monster Rats.|$|R
5000|$|The {{series is}} the first of the Gundam {{franchise}} set in the [...] "Cosmic Era" [...] in which mankind is divided between normal Earth dwelling humans, known as [...] "Naturals", and the genetically altered super-humans known as [...] "Coordinators". The primary conflict of the story plot derives from jealous hatred by Naturals of the abilities of Coordinators, leading to hate crimes, and eventually the emigration of almost all Coordinators who flee into space to live idyllic lives on <b>giant</b> orbital space <b>colonies</b> called PLANTS of their own design. War eventually breaks out between Earth and the Plants. The Earth is divided between two major factions, the Earth Forces formed from most of the natural born human nations, primarily the Eurasians and the Atlantic Federation, and a natural human supremacist group known as Blue Cosmos with its slogan, [...] "For the preservation of our blue and pure world". The Earth Forces are not a unified alliance, and infighting and mistrust exist between their various nation states. The second major Earth nation is the Orb Union, a staunchly politically neutral and isolationist nation located on small Pacific Ocean islands ruled by a hereditary monarchy and still contains Coordinator citizens.|$|R
50|$|In the 70's however Sabaneque Speleological Group from Sagua la Grande {{starts the}} {{production}} of a cartographic map of the region along with a flora and fauna catalog of the caverns in the mogotes. They discovered that the small caves were actually subterranean developed system of caverns with lakes and rivers. Numerous rare endemic animals were also discovered, among them a unique pseudo scorpion, not many species of scorpions live in Cuba, local farmers used to say they have spotted a different kind of scorpion that only lived in the Mogotes and the research of the scientist prove this true this fable. Also discovered; <b>giant</b> fisher bat <b>colonies,</b> cave tortoises, blind fishes and crabs, and the American ell Anguilla rostrata. In the case of the ells is also an impressive example of adaptation since this species usually live in the ocean, they move into rivers and lakes only to give birth. Fossils like the disappeared snail Pseudomiltha sp. and a giant rodent (Megalocnus rodens) that once roam Cuban forests were also uncovered. The Megalocnus is so big that is used to be described by paleontologists as the Cuban bear. Last but not least bones and other proof that Cuban indigenous people lived in the area prior to the Spanish conquest.|$|R
40|$|DUTCH POLITICS HAS A REPUTATION FOR DULLNESS AND STABILITY. But {{that was}} hardly the case in 2002, when Pim Fortuyn entered politics. His party came in second in that year's election, {{although}} it {{had not yet been}} formally founded and Fortuyn himself had been murdered a few days earlier. Yet it now {{remains to be seen if}} the party can survive the assassination of its founding father. The election for the European Parliament, to be held in June 2004, may be the final test. Canada is quite different from the Netherlands. A thinly populated geographical <b>giant,</b> a former <b>colony</b> and a rather decentralized federal state, Canada has ethnic, linguistic and religious diversity without much ideological variety, and a majoritarian political system dominated (at least until 1993) by two pragmatic "catch-all" parties. The Netherlands, once a colonial empire but now a densely populated and very small, highly centralized state, is ethnically fairly homogeneous but fragmented along ideological and religious lines, and hence used to proportional representation, ideological mass parties and consociational politics. Yet in recent decades, new parties emerged in both Canada and the Netherlands that shared a remarkable number of features: an ideological mixture of economic neoliberalism, cultural conservatism and democratic populism, along with personal leadership and a more confrontational political style. Perhaps it is more than a coincidence that Canada's populist party grew up on the prairies: flat land, divided into rectangular plots, in many ways similar to the Dutch polders...|$|R
