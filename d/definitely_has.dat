500|$|In April 2013, James Valentine {{said the}} band was in the studio {{recording}} songs for the upcoming fifth studio album: [...] "The stuff we're working on now, it <b>definitely</b> <b>has</b> gone maybe a little darker in its sound, maybe {{back a little bit}} more to what we kind of did on Songs About Jane, but at this point we do have all kinds of different songs and it is early".|$|E
500|$|Despite the {{problems}} during production, the album remained Wright's favourite: [...] "It's an album I {{can listen to}} for pleasure, and there aren't many Floyd albums that I can." [...] Gilmour shares this view: [...] "I for {{one would have to}} say that it is my favourite album, the Wish You Were Here album. [...] The end result of all that, whatever it was, <b>definitely</b> <b>has</b> left me an album I can live with very very happily. [...] I like it very much." ...|$|E

It all gets mixed up and then you find out what the drive is behind all of this. It's the big spanner in the works! The secret <b>definitely</b> <b>has</b> a huge impact on the lives of everyone involved." ...|$|E
500|$|The song's only {{official}} remix features guest vocals from rapper Eve, and {{an alternate}} {{version of the}} music video was created for it. Amerie that said she chose Eve {{to appear on the}} remix because most other female R singers were accompanied by male rappers, and that Eve [...] "epitomizes that whole independent fearless female doing her thing. She's fashionable and very much a woman even though she <b>definitely</b> <b>has</b> a lot of attitude, the strength that most would attribute to men. ... With '1 Thing' being such an aggressive track, it was perfect to see two females really doing it." ...|$|E
500|$|For the Blind Witch, Kitsis and co-creator Adam Horowitz cast actress Emma Caulfield, as {{they had}} been [...] "huge fans" [...] of hers since she had co-starred on Buffy the Vampire Slayer. Kitsis commented, [...] "We couldn’t think of anyone better to trap two {{children}} in a house and try to eat them." [...] Caulfield had previously worked with series writer Jane Espenson and producer Liz Tigelaar on Buffy and Life Unexpected. Morrison remarked that while viewers do not see the Blind Witch in Maine, [...] "Everyone who is in fairytale land <b>definitely</b> <b>has</b> a Storybrooke counterpart. Whether or not we see them immediately doesn’t mean they don’t exist." ...|$|E

500|$|De Fratus {{attended}} Rio Mesa High School in Oxnard, California, {{from which}} he graduated in 2005; he was {{a fan of the}} Los Angeles Dodgers. His high school coach, David Soliz, asserted that he could pitch in the major leagues for a long time, saying, [...] "He <b>definitely</b> <b>has</b> the stuff to pitch in the majors. Justin has the stuff, but he also has the confidence. The odds were against him being drafted in the 11th round out of Ventura College." [...] De Fratus was the first Rio Mesa player to reach the majors during Soliz's tenure. He went on to attend Ventura College where, like at Rio Mesa, he was a starting pitcher.|$|E
500|$|Mitzeee begins being stalked. Her portrayer Shenton said Mitzeee {{was unaware}} of who the stalker was and that [...] "Mercedes hasn't even crossed her mind. She thinks it's a crazed fan". The viewers learn that it was Mercedes. The {{stalking}} stopped but later was resumed when Mitzeee and Riley begin a relationship. Shenton explained that the stalker had a key to Mitzeee's flat and had been watching her every move, and said that [...] "not only has the stalker come back, but they've come back {{on a whole new}} level". Shenton added that at this point [...] "Mitzeee <b>definitely</b> <b>has</b> no idea that it's Mercedes - in fact, Mercedes is probably the last person that she'd suspect. She actually thinks that it's Lynsey and accuses her, because it seems to make sense".|$|E
500|$|Wadia {{warns that}} Yusef will {{ultimately}} get worse as time progresses. She said to Inside Soap: [...] "I was filming out on location recently with Ace {{and a bunch}} of women came over to him and said, 'God, you're such a horrible man!' It's funny because Ace is such a sweet man - and you haven't even seen the worst of Yusef yet!" [...] Wadia continued: [...] "Let's just say that what happens is the complete opposite of what you want to see. Zainab and Yusef share a dark and twisted love, and she <b>definitely</b> <b>has</b> feelings for him. It's not true and pure like what she used to have with Masood - and if Yusef manages to get her back to Pakistan, it will be the end for her. I wouldn't be surprised if Zainab ends up in some sort of home to recover from everything that's going to happen." ...|$|E

500|$|The PC {{version of}} Incoming was {{generally}} well-received. British magazine PC Zone {{described it as}} [...] "bloody good," [...] with [...] "some modest simulation elements." [...] The magazine praised {{the setting of the}} game, commenting: [...] "a refreshing change from the deep space of most futuristic combat sims, and something which <b>definitely</b> <b>has</b> a positive effect on gameplay." [...] The review concluded by saying that [...] "it's as fun as it looks. Just for once, all those people who don't read reviews and buy games purely on the strength of pretty pictures on the packaging are gonna find themselves playing a very, very enjoyable game." [...] Edge highlighted the game's efficient gameplay mechanics, stating that designers [...] "managed to produce something more than a lightshow, taking care to fine-tune a design that, if not exactly original, at least does its thing with flair and solid understanding of gameplay." ...|$|E
500|$|Becky Bain of 'Idolator' {{was more}} {{positive}} {{of the song}} saying she [...] "actually forgot Lopez is still considered a singer, what with her two-year hiatus to focus on all her fragrances and clothing lines and babies and such. It's nice to have her back—yes, not every J-Lo song was a hit, but we all danced to 'If You Had My Love' and 'Waiting for Tonight' back in the day. 'Louboutins' ... <b>definitely</b> <b>has</b> the catchiest chorus she's had in years. This could actually bring Jennifer out of the pit her last album Brave dug her into." [...] Nick Levine from Digital Spy described the track as [...] "a Tricky and The-Dream-produced club banger with a chorus that succeeds through sheer attrition, with a proper Janet Jackson-style dance break. [...] Truth be told, it's not a J.Lo classic to rival 'Play' or 'Love Don't Cost a Thing', and it's about as original as starting your day {{with a bowl of}} Kellogg's Cornflakes, but it does burrow into your brain after a few spins." ...|$|E
500|$|Upon its release, [...] "City Girl" [...] {{received}} moderate critical acclaim. Pitchfork Media writer Mark Richardson {{said that}} [...] "on first listen {{it sounds like}} a demo of a pre-Loveless track, possibly from the You Made Me Realise era" [...] and while there was [...] "no exploration on that front … the melody and voice are familiar and welcome." [...] Writing for Stylus Magazine, Andrew Unterberger called [...] "City Girl" [...] "a worthy opener" [...] and added that [...] " [...] where Kevin's at right now—making pretty pop songs. There is so little to this song that it's almost enough to make you think Kevin's lost his mind." [...] Unterberger summarised the song as [...] "gorgeous, and <b>definitely</b> <b>has</b> that sighing quality to it that makes the film so delectable." [...] Exclaim! journalist Michael White noted that it was [...] "the indisputable highlight of the soundtrack" [...] and AllMusics Heather Phares described [...] "City Girl" [...] as an [...] "open-ended piece" [...] and [...] "naïve [...] guitar-driven" [...] but added that it did not compare to Shields' compositions on Loveless (1991).|$|E
500|$|After {{serving as}} an {{associate}} producer for her 2004 film Three Way, Larter commented about future producing endeavors during an interview for , [...] "I <b>definitely</b> <b>have</b> many ideas and different avenues that I want to take as my career goes on." ...|$|R

500|$|In the original, non-broadcast pilot, Willow {{was portrayed}} by Riff Regan. However, network {{executives}} requested that Regan be replaced. Willow's character demanded {{that she be}} shy and unsure of herself, and the casting department encountered some difficulty finding actresses who could portray this effectively and still be likable. After seven auditions, Alyson Hannigan was eventually chosen for the role. She was chosen {{for being able to}} spin the character's lines with a self-effacing optimism; she stated, [...] "I didn't want to do Willow as someone who's feeling sorry for herself. Especially in the first season, she couldn't talk to guys, and nobody liked her. I was like, 'I don't want to play somebody who's down on herself." [...] Whedon conceived the character as introverted, saying [...] "I wanted Willow {{to have that kind of}} insanely colorful interior life that truly shy people have. And Alyson has that. She <b>definitely</b> <b>has</b> a loopiness I found creeping into the way Willow talked, which was great. To an extent, all the actors conform to the way I write the character, but it really stands out in Willow's case." ...|$|E
500|$|Scouting {{reports on}} Filatov were mixed {{in advance of}} the 2008 NHL Entry Draft. Sergei Nemchinov, head coach of Russia's {{national}} junior team, said of Filatov, [...] "He <b>definitely</b> <b>has</b> an NHL upside because he can score, is a well-rounded player and is responsible in the defensive zone." [...] Independent scouting service Red Line Report at one point declared Filatov [...] "the next best thing to Steven Stamkos" [...] (who was eventually selected first overall in the 2008 Draft). McKeen's Hockey scouts described him as a cross between Ilya Kovalchuk and Maxim Afinogenov. His strengths included his skating and vision, as well as the inclination to play at high intensity. The NHL's Director of European Scouting, Goran Stubb, assessed Filatov's NHL readiness as, [...] "Nikita is a leader, has a great attitude, an excellent work ethic and tons of talent." [...] Other scouts were not as impressed with his defensive game, however, preferring to focus on his offensive abilities. Off the ice, Filatov does not train in a traditional gym or weight room, preferring to run outside in sand and lift objects such as trees and boulders.|$|E
500|$|... "Ego" [...] {{was written}} by Elvis Williams, Harold Lilly and Beyoncé while {{production}} was handled by Williams and Beyoncé. It was originally written for singer Chrisette Michele for her 2009 album Epiphany. However, Michele turned it down because she had written all the songs on her then-upcoming album and feared that the song might not suit her. She said, [...] "You don’t know if they’re {{going to be able}} to capture your voice the same way that you captured it yourself." [...] "Ego" [...] was eventually proposed to Beyoncé, who used it for the deluxe edition of I Am... Sasha Fierce. It was officially remixed with added vocals from Kanye West, whom Beyoncé described as the [...] "perfect person" [...] to be on the remix. Elaborating on her collaboration with West, she told MTV News, [...] " [...] voice sounds so wonderful on it. He <b>definitely</b> <b>has</b> the confidence and he backs it up. And that's what this song is about." [...] The remix was included on the 2009 remix album Above and Beyoncé – Video Collection & Dance Mixes and the platinum edition of I Am... Sasha Fierce. Andrew Burgess of musicOMH criticized West's [...] "lackadaisical and disappointing appearance" [...] on the remix.|$|E

5000|$|Parker {{played on}} pianist Jacky Terrasson's first three albums.

500|$|Vickers is a Weyland Corporation {{employee}} who {{is sent to}} monitor the expedition. Theron described the character as [...] "a suit who slowly sheds [...] skin through the film", and also as [...] "somewhat of a villain... <b>definitely</b> <b>has</b> an agenda". She stated [...] "Vickers is pragmatic, and desperately wants to control the situation." [...] Scott wanted the character to lurk {{in the background of}} scenes watching other characters instead of being the focus. Theron said that this helped layer her character because [...] "you're just so suspicious of her, instantly." [...] The similarities between the appearances and mannerisms of Vickers and David were intended to raise the possibility that David was based on Vickers's DNA, or that Vickers is an android herself. After Theron was cast in the role, she developed three new scenes with Scott and Lindelof to expand her character. Physical action scenes, some of which involved her running through sand in [...] boots were a problem for Theron. It was intended that Theron would portray Shaw, but a prior commitment to [...] prevented her involvement. When that film was delayed, she was able to rejoin Prometheus. Michelle Yeoh and Angelina Jolie were considered for the role.|$|E
500|$|At Metacritic, which assigns a {{normalized}} rating out of 100 to {{reviews from}} mainstream publications, the album received an average score of 71, based on 13 reviews. From an artistic viewpoint, the album {{has been considered}} as Usher's best album to date, with writers calling it expansive and futuristic. Matt Cibula of PopMatters wrote that it [...] "might be the best English-language pop album of the year". Entertainment Weeklys Jem Aswad said that Usher [...] "reveals his new-found maturity by opening with the grittiest song he's ever done." [...] Laura Checkoway of Vibe said that, [...] "Though Confessions doesn't bring Usher {{all the way to}} the artistic maturity one might hope for, tracking this star's progression <b>definitely</b> <b>has</b> its satisfactions." [...] Q magazine observed [...] "addictive R hooks and all-dancin', all-lovin' subject matter boosted with hot production tweaks." [...] Amy Linden of The Village Voice commented that [...] "Usher's (alleged) character flaws are easily forgiven, though, because he can sing his cheating ass off," [...] and concluded, [...] "Like 2002's big-selling but underrated 8701, Confessions is a top-of-the-line pop-soul showcase that ... manages to be commercially savvy without coming off as too desperate. Sorta like Usher himself." [...] Kelefa Sanneh of The New York Times said that near the end, the songwriting [...] "fails" [...] Usher on a [...] "heavily front-loaded" [...] R album, but felt that his performance is solid throughout: ...|$|E

People magazine named Usher the [...] "Sexiest R Star" [...] in 1998, with singer Monica who said on stage sexiness was manifest in [...] "his movements, his gestures, the way he expresses his lyrics." [...] Actress Adrienne Frantz who played with Usher in The Bold and the Beautiful also said [...] "Usher <b>definitely</b> <b>has</b> a way with women. His smile is sweet and sexy at the same time", and added [...] "he's a great kisser." [...] He was included on it's [...] "Sexiest Men Alive" [...] list in 2004, as he was 4 years later again in 2008. Usher was ranked number-one on BET’s [...] "All Shades of Fine: 25 Hottest Men of the Past 25 Years" [...] in 2005. Madame Tussauds New York also unveiled a wax figure of Usher during a competition to launch The Usher Interactive Experience.
