40|$|Background— Diabetes {{and heart}} failure {{frequently}} coexist. Our {{aim was to}} assess the association between diabetes and short- and long-term outcomes in all patients admitted to the hospital {{for the first time with}} heart failure in Scotland between 1986 and 2003. Methods and Results— A total of 116 556 patients were studied, of whom 13 % (n= 15 161) had a diagnosis of diabetes. At 30 days, <b>diabetes</b> <b>was</b> associated with a lower case fatality. By 1 year, the association between diabetes and better outcome <b>was</b> reversed, and <b>diabetes</b> <b>was</b> a significant independent predictor of higher case fatality. The longer term risk of death associated with <b>diabetes</b> <b>was</b> greatest in younger patients. In patients aged 65 years or younger, the hazard ratio for mortality at 5 years associated with <b>diabetes</b> <b>was</b> 1. 41 (95 % CI, 1. 31 to 1. 52) for men and 1. 64 (1. 50 to 1. 79) for women. The risk associated with <b>diabetes</b> <b>was</b> less in patients aged 75 years or older: a hazard ratio in men 1. 16 (1. 10 to 1. 22) and in women 1. 15 (1. 10 to 1. 20). In the younger age group the risk associated with <b>diabetes</b> <b>was</b> significantly greater in women than in men (P= 0. 005 for diabetes-sex interaction). <b>Diabetes</b> <b>was</b> also a significant independent predictor of heart failure readmission, and again the risk was greatest in younger women. Conclusions— Although <b>diabetes</b> <b>was</b> associated with a lower case fatality at 30 days, by 1 year it was a significant independent predictor of higher case fatality. The risk associated with <b>diabetes</b> <b>was</b> greatest in young patients, and in young patients the risk was greatest in women...|$|R
40|$|Aims. The {{prevalence}} of diabetes mellitus in pancreatic cancer patients and control subjects was compared. Methods. Retrospective evaluation of 182 pancreatic cancer patients and 135 controls. The presence of <b>diabetes</b> <b>was</b> evaluated {{and the time}} period between the diagnosis of diabetes and pancreatic cancer was assessed. A subanalysis based on patient sex <b>was</b> conducted. Results. <b>Diabetes</b> mellitus <b>was</b> present in 64 patients (35. 2 %) in pancreatic cancer group and in 27 patients (20. 0 %) in control group (χ 2 = 8. 709; P= 0. 003). In 18 patients (28. 1 % of diabetic pancreatic cancer patients) <b>diabetes</b> <b>was</b> new-onset. <b>Diabetes</b> <b>was</b> new-onset in 23. 3 % of females compared to 38. 1 % of males (χ 2 = 1. 537; P= 0. 215). The overall {{prevalence of}} <b>diabetes</b> <b>was</b> significantly higher among female pancreatic cancer patients (25 % versus 43. 9 %; χ 2 = 7. 070, P= 0. 008), while <b>diabetes</b> prevalence <b>was</b> equally represented {{in the control group}} patients (22. 1 % versus 17. 2 %; χ 2 = 0. 484, P= 0. 487). Conclusion. The prevalence of diabetes mellitus in study group of pancreatic cancer patients was significantly higher when compared to control group. Pancreatic cancer patients with <b>diabetes</b> <b>were</b> predominantly females, while <b>diabetes</b> <b>was</b> equally prevalent among sexes in the control group. Therefore, patient sex may play important role in the risk stratification...|$|R
40|$|Objective. Transmission {{of family}} history of type 2 {{diabetes}} {{to the next generation}} is stronger for maternal than paternal diabetes in some populations. The aim {{of the present study was}} to investigate whether this difference is explained by diet, lifestyle factors and/or adiposity. Methods. We analysed 35 174 participants from the Dutch contribution to the European Prospective Investigation into Cancer and Nutrition, a prospective population-based cohort (aged 20 - 70 years) with a median follow-up of 10. 2 years. Parental history of <b>diabetes</b> <b>was</b> self-reported. Occurrence of <b>diabetes</b> <b>was</b> mainly identified by self-report and verified by medical records. Results. Amongst 35 174 participants, 799 incident cases of <b>diabetes</b> <b>were</b> observed. In age-and sex-adjusted analyses, hazard ratio (HR) and 95 % confidence intervals (CIs) for diabetes by maternal and paternal <b>diabetes</b> <b>were</b> 2. 66 (2. 26 - 3. 14) and 2. 40 (1. 91 - 3. 02), respectively. Maternal transmission of risk of <b>diabetes</b> <b>was</b> explained by diet (9. 4 %), lifestyle factors including smoking, alcohol consumption, physical activity and educational level (7. 8 %) and by adiposity, i. e. body mass index and waist and hip circumference (23. 5 %). For paternal transmission, the corresponding values were 2. 9 %, 0. 0 % and 9. 6 %. After adjustment for diet, lifestyle factors and adiposity, the HRs for maternal (2. 20; 95 % CI, 1. 87 - 2. 60) and paternal (2. 23; 95 % CI, 1. 77 - 2. 80) transmission of <b>diabetes</b> <b>were</b> comparable. Conclusions. Both maternal and paternal <b>diabetes</b> <b>are</b> associated with increased risk of type 2 diabetes, independently of diet, lifestyle and adiposity. The slightly higher risk conferred by maternal compared to paternal <b>diabetes</b> <b>was</b> explained by a larger contribution of diet, lifestyle factors and adiposity...|$|R

40|$|People with <b>diabetes</b> <b>are</b> at an {{increased}} risk of cardiovascular disease (CVD). Published data on risk of all-cause mortality, myocardial infarction (MI) and stroke in type 1 diabetes separately from risk in type 2 <b>diabetes</b> <b>are</b> scarce. Such data that do exist may be derived from studies limited to a specific geographical area with a high background risk of CVD. Cohorts and sample sizes are often small with limited data for the elderly or young. This thesis presents analyses of data taken from the General Practice Research Database (GPRD). This database provides longitudinal data from primary care representative of approximately 5 % of the UK population in 1992. Cohorts of patients with type 1 (n 7, 713) or type 2 (n 44, 230) <b>diabetes</b> <b>were</b> identified and followed from baseline to 1999. Risk of all-cause mortality MI and stroke in type 1 diabetes and type 2 <b>diabetes</b> <b>was</b> compared with that risk in people without diabetes. Patients with type 1 <b>diabetes</b> <b>were</b> at three to four times the risk of death or CVD than their peers without diabetes. In people with type 2 <b>diabetes</b> the risks <b>were</b> generally twice those of people without diabetes. The relative risks stratified by age and sex in type 1 and type 2 <b>diabetes</b> revealed risk <b>was</b> highest in the younger age-groups, reduced with age and that the risk associated with having <b>diabetes</b> <b>was</b> greater for women than for men.

40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{validate}} risk {{scores to}} predict occurrence of {{type 2 diabetes}} in the Dutch population. DESIGN: Prospective cohort study. METHODS: Twelve basic risk scores and 13 extensive risk scores with biomarkers were used to predict {{the risk of developing}} type 2 diabetes during 7. 5 years in a prospective cohort of 38, 379 Dutch men and women. Occurrence of <b>diabetes</b> <b>was</b> documented through repeated questionnaires and validated against medical records. The capacity of the risk scores to correctly identify those at high risk of developing <b>diabetes</b> <b>was</b> determined using the C-statistic. The capacity of the risk scores to correctly quantify the absolute risk of <b>diabetes</b> <b>was</b> determined by testing the difference between the predicted and observed risk in the population. RESULTS: The capacity of basic risk scores to identify those at high risk of <b>diabetes</b> <b>was</b> good, with C-statistics ranging from 0. 74 (95 %-CI: 0. 73 - 0. 75) to 0. 84 (0. 82 - 0. 85). The extended risk scores were very capable of identifying those at high risk of diabetes, with C-statistics ranging from 0. 81 (0. 80 - 0. 83) to 0. 93 (0. 92 - 0. 94). Most risk scores, however, were unable to correctly quantify the absolute risk of diabetes; the risk was usually overestimated. Only the basic KORA model correctly quantified the risk in this Dutch population. CONCLUSION: In the Dutch population, risk scores to predict the occurrence of type 2 <b>diabetes</b> <b>are</b> very capable of identifying those at high risk.
