25|$|The Charlottenburg version (260 × 226cm; 102⅓ × 89in) shows Napoleon {{in a red}} cloak {{mounted on}} a {{chestnut}} horse. The tack is simpler, lacking the martingale, and the girth is grey-blue. There are traces {{of snow on the}} ground. Napoleon's features are sunken with the faint <b>hint</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>smile.</b> The picture is signed L.DAVID YEAR IX.|$|E
500|$|For {{the naked}} scenes, Spears cleared the set, leaving only Kahn, Blackburn and Rushing {{with her to}} shoot the sequence. Spears also shot scenes {{in which she had}} to dance through a hallway of {{imaginary}} lasers in front of a green screen, something that Kahn deemed as [...] "incredible to watch". The last few scenes of the video in which Spears murders her boyfriend, concerned Kahn, who thought they would be censored. He explained [...] "the trick was to make it look pop at the same time" [...] and told Henderson [...] "'Would you like to be kissed by Britney Spears?'". According to Kahn, the <b>hint</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>smile</b> that appears on Henderson's face before Spears pours the poison into his mouth was what managed to get the shot past censors. Although Spears was at first going {{to be involved in the}} editing process with Blackburn, she did not contact Kahn after the media scandal over her wedding in Las Vegas. [...] "Toxic" [...] is Spears's most expensive music video to date, at a cost of $1 million.|$|E
500|$|McCann {{notes that}} Grant {{typically}} played [...] "wealthy privileged characters who {{never seemed to}} have any need to work {{in order to maintain}} their glamorous and hedonistic lifestyle. He became a star whose characters were good looking, quick witted, funny and athletic, a star whose characters seemed to win the hearts of women without even trying". Martin Stirling, commenting in the biography Cary Grant: In Name Only, thought that Grant had an acting range which was [...] "greater than any of his contemporaries, but understood why a number of critics underrated him as an actor. He believes that Grant was always at his [...] "physical and verbal best in situations that bordered on farce". Charles Champlin, commenting in Donald Deschner's The Complete Films of Cary Grant (1973) similarly identifies a paradox in Grant's screen persona, in his unusual ability to [...] "mix polish and pratfalls in successive scenes". He remarks that Grant was [...] "refreshingly able to play the near-fool, the fey idiot, without compromising his masculinity or surrendering to camp for its own sake. His ability to play off against his own image as the strong and handsome romantic hero-figure is, as a matter of fact, probably unique among superstars. Nobody else comes even close to mind who could similarly toy with his own dignity without losing it". Wansell further notes that Grant could, [...] "with the arch of an eyebrow or the merest <b>hint</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>smile,</b> question his own image", managing to [...] "blend irony and romance in a way that few other stars have ever done, by slyly never appearing to take himself too seriously, and mixing his own unique mixture of naïveté and worldliness". Stanley Donen, a director who had worked with Grant, stated that his real [...] "magic" [...] came from his attention to minute details and always seeming real, which came from [...] "enormous amounts of work" [...] rather than being God-given. Grant remarked of his career: [...] "I guess to a certain extent I did eventually become the characters I was playing. I played at being someone I wanted to be until I became that person, Or he became me". He would later profess that the real Cary Grant was more like his scruffy, unshaven fisherman in Father Goose than the [...] "well-tailored charmer" [...] of Charade.|$|E
60|$|She did {{not answer}} at once, but looked up at him, as he stood over her, {{with one of her}} strange, {{baffling}} gazes, in which there was the <b>hint</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> welcoming <b>smile.</b>|$|R
60|$|Mrs. Haldin's {{armchair}} by {{the window}} stood empty. On the sofa, Nathalie Haldin raised her charming grey eyes in <b>a</b> glance <b>of</b> greeting accompanied by the merest <b>hint</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> welcoming <b>smile.</b> But she made no movement. With her strong white hands lying inverted {{in the lap of}} her mourning dress she faced a man who presented to me a robust back covered with black broadcloth, and well in keeping with the deep voice. He turned his head sharply over his shoulder, but only for a moment.|$|R

2500|$|In this play, {{there are}} very few {{dialogue}} passages that are written without script directions (written in italics inside parentheses before the actual printed dialogue). Although it is common practice for playwrights to supply some interpretation of how the dialogue should be delivered, Albee supplies these directions quite liberally and quite specifically. For instance, in the opening scene, he directs Agnes’s first lines with these directions: “ (Speaks usually softly, with a tiny <b>hint</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>smile</b> on her face: not sardonic, not sad [...] [...] [...] wistful, maybe).” In a later line for Tobias, Albee directs the actor to deliver it in this way: (Very nice, but there is steel underneath). For one of Claire’s lines, Albee suggests that the actor speak, “ (to Agnes’ back, a rehearsed speech, gone through but hated)”.|$|E
2500|$|Vishniac's {{photographs}} from the 1930s are all of a very distinct style; they are all focused on achieving the same end: capturing the unique culture of Jewish ghettos in Eastern Europe, especially the religious and impoverished. His published pictures largely center on these people, usually in small groups, going about their daily lives: very often studying (generally religious texts), walking (many times through harsh weather), and sometimes just sitting; staring. The scenes are dramatic: [...] "There is barely a <b>hint</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>smile</b> {{on any of the}} faces. The eyes peer at us suspiciously from behind ancient casement windows and over a peddler's tray, from crowded schoolrooms and desolate street corners." [...] Gene Thornton, writer for The New York Times, called them [...] "somber with poverty and with the gray light of European Winter".|$|E

6000|$|Peter {{looked at}} Grandfather Frog sharply. He wasn't {{so sure that}} that was a real nap. It seemed to him that there was just the least little <b>hint</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>smile</b> in the corners of Grandfather Frog's big mouth. [...] "You sit here a minute," [...] he whispered in Johnny Chuck's ear.|$|E

Mother, as I've told you--" ...|$|E
60|$|I recall him {{tilted back}} in his chair in a debonnair manner beside his {{polished}} desk, the <b>hint</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>smile</b> on his lips; and leaning close to him was a yellow, owl-like person whose eyes, as they turned to me, gave the impression of having stared for years into hard, artificial lights. Mr. Watling rose briskly.|$|E
60|$|Caldwell, {{watching}} {{her as she}} read, was suddenly fascinated. During a trip abroad, while still an undergraduate, he had once seen {{the face of an}} actress, a really good Parisian actress, light up in that way; and it had revealed to him, in a flash, the meaning of enthusiasm. Now Janet became vivid for him. There must be something unusual in a person whose feelings could be so intense, whose emotions rang so true. He was not unsophisticated. He had sometimes wondered why Ditmar had promoted her, though acknowledging her ability. He admired Ditmar, but had no illusions about him. Harvard, and birth in a social stratum where emphasis is superfluous, enabled him to smile at the reporter's exuberance; and he was the more drawn toward her to see on Janet's flushed face the <b>hint</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>smile</b> as {{she looked up at him}} when she had finished.|$|E

5000|$|According to {{an article}} {{published}} in The News by Chris Cork, who in his article remarked, [...] "He was a quick painter, three or four sittings and the work was done. Looking at his pictures today they are almost ephemeral. Not for him the heavy brushstroke but instead a <b>hint</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>smile,</b> a slightly raised and querulent eyebrow and those Petman eyes, all so different but identifiably Petman eyes no matter who they belonged to in the first place." ...|$|E
5000|$|She {{is finally}} {{brought before the}} review board on whether she will stay there permanently. It is decided that her {{philosophy}} of helping people is dangerous for the fragile post-war society, and therefore she becomes locked up there permanently. The people she has helped, along with many she hasn't, stand outside her cell window, praying to her as their new [...] "patron saint."

Despite Mrs. Peters initial reluctance to engage in conversation, Ayesha wins her over, and an unlikely friendship develops between them. It is through Ayesha that the two families learn about each other so that various myths are understood and they realise they share many common views when Mrs. Peters is also on speaking terms {{with the rest of}} the Ali family, which brings their two contrasting families together, crossing religious, cultural and racial barriers.|$|E
5000|$|The lyrical {{nature of}} the artist’s character, to a great extent, defined his {{perspective}} on {{the interpretation of the}} soviet woman-worker image. Remaining confined to the unavoidable industrial themes of the official commissions, he first and for most emphasizes the femininity in his fish factory workers, helmswomen, attendants and electricians. Even the drab shapelessness of their working uniforms is powerless to conceal it. Every work reveals to the viewer a [...] "soviet Madonna"; slightly mysterious with her <b>hint</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>smile</b> and averted daydreaming gaze. Perhaps she is not always beautiful, but inimitably unique, and thusly so attractive.|$|E
50|$|By {{the time}} Cheng arrives to rescue Lucy, whom he so innocently adores, {{it is too}} late. Lucy's lifeless body lies on her modest bed as Battling has a drink in the other room. As Cheng gazes at Lucy's {{youthful}} face which, {{in spite of the}} circumstances, beams with innocence and even the slightest <b>hint</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>smile,</b> Battling enters the room to make his escape. The two stand for a long while, exchanging spiteful glances, until Battling lunges for Cheng with a hatchet, and Cheng retaliates by shooting Burrows repeatedly with his handgun. After returning to his home with Lucy's body, Cheng builds a shrine to Buddha and takes his own life with a knife to the chest.|$|E
