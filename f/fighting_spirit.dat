5|$|McKellar {{was also}} {{considered}} a capable leader in combat.

His dedication to {{his job as a}} fighter pilot and leader led him to refuse any leave from his Squadron while the Battle of Britain lasted. Invariably McKellar led from the front of his unit. He spent a large proportion of his time with his squadron practising combat tactics. While intensely loyal to anyone he considered a friend, McKellar's attitude to others outside the squadron was either of utmost friendliness or utter dislike. He is said to have tended to see everything and everyone in black and white.|$|E

Since Empire's presence in the United States market was minimal, a distribution deal was passed with Vivendi Universal for them to distribute the game, along with six other titles, in North America.|$|E
5|$|Victory at the Battle of Halmstad (17 August 1676), when Charles and his {{commander-in-chief}} Simon Grundel-Helmfelt defeated a Danish division, was the king's first {{glimmer of}} good luck.

The Danish army commanded by Christian V was positioned {{on the other}} side. It was impossible to cross the river and Charles {{had to wait for}} weeks until it froze over. This finally happened on 4 December and Charles launched a surprise attack on the Danish forces to fight the Battle of Lund. This was one of the bloodiest engagements of its time. Of the over 20,000 combatants, about 8,000 perished on the battlefield. All the Swedish commanders showed ability, but the chief glory of the day was attributed to Charles XI and his <b>fighting</b> <b>spirit.</b> The battle proved to be a decisive one for the rule of the Scanian lands and it has been described as the most significant event for Charles' personality.

40|$|The {{functional}} {{significance of}} the testis has been known {{since the time of}} Aristotle (121) who ascribed post-pubertal changes to the function of the gonads, as such manifestations were absent in castrates — both in man and in birds. Accurate knowledge of the nature and metabolism of the androgenically active substance secreted by the testis has, however, been acquired only during the past decade. It was not until {{the first half of the}} Nineteenth Century that the gonads were recognized as being ductless glands, and capable of secreting a substance into the blood-stream. That the testis is normally the main source of the androgenic substance in man and other animals was first indicated experimentally by Berthold in 1849 (4). He removed the testis of four roosters and replaced one testis in an unusual abdominal position in each of two capons. He killed these two capons six months later and found that because of the testicular grafts, “these animals remained male in regard to voice, reproduction, instinct, <b>fighting</b> <b>spirits,</b> and growth of comb and wattles”. Berthold further suggested that the testicle exerted its influence upon the organism via the blood, and this viewpoint is now the generally accepted one. [ [...] . ...|$|R

40|$|Despite the {{research}} by some authors on the Syrian Arab Republic and its {{stand in the}} Middle East Region, {{little is known about}} the perspective of the Syrian military, unofficially called the “elder statesman”, who rules this country. The overall image that emerges not only from the Arab media during the revolutionary year 2011 is ambivalent: lazy, corrupt, unpatriotic, apathetic soldiers with poor <b>fighting</b> <b>spirits</b> versus the Free Syrian Army newly formed in July 2011. This paper recovers some perspectives of the Syrian revolt and tries to answer, whether or whether not is the newly based military opposition in the country a real threat to the Assad regime. An analysis of historical background, Syrian veterans, relation between the official political doctrine and Islam brings new perspectives and own explanations that could even challenge some of the widely held assumptions about the Syrian military: 1) There is and won’t be any “civil war” in the Syrian Arab Republic at all; this conflict should be viewed as Islamic fitna and its roots come from the 1970 ’s. It is a regime strongly connected to rife corruption at the top ranks, hurting the morale of the lower, but stronger Islamic ranks; 2) Doctrinal relations between the Syrian army and official religious authorities in the Muslim world have been always tense; and 3) The Syrian army would have found the necessity of its own, inner transformation despite of the so-called “Arab Spring 2011 ”. This paper suggests that the character of the Syrian national revolt may be intended to reflect a deeper ideological antagonism between the Sunni and Shia Islam...|$|R
