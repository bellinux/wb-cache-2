50|$|Mubarak also {{engaged in}} affairs {{concerning}} the neighboring areas around him, which caused consternation {{on both the}} Ottoman and the British sides. Mubarak supported and smuggled British guns to local Arabian leaders. In 1904-1906, while the Ottoman military occupied the important sub-region of al-Qasim in central Najd, Mubarak supported the Ottoman’s opponent Ibn Sa’ud giving him strong “strong moral and material” support. In 1905 Mubarak {{also served as a}} mediator between the Saudis and the Ottomans, while simultaneously shaping Saudi strategy during the negotiations. A sign that the Ottoman attitude toward Mubarak was changing occurred in 1911 when in a <b>draft</b> <b>message</b> to Mubarak he was addressed not as “Kaymakam of Kuwait” but rather “Ruler of Kuwait and Chief of its Tribes.” This change in attitude, which included other pressures and troubles for the Ottoman Empire including the British lobbying on Kuwait’s behalf, led to the Anglo-Ottoman Convention of 1913, which recognized Kuwait as an autonomous kaza of the Ottoman Empire within the Green zone outlined in the map as well as an independent entity within the red zone outlined in the map.|$|E
40|$|In the {{immediate}} and early aftermath of a geological disaster, one major goal of communications by geoscientists should be to provide information that will help those impacted make safe and healthy behavioral choices.

40|$|Recent changes are: (1) There is {{no longer}} a logical node number, only a node number which does not change as the logical machine is define. Thus there are two styles of messaging: {{messages}} are sent to a node by node number, or messages are sent to a relative (logical) node. (2) Methods related to node numbers have been changed (some dropped, some added). This note presents: (1) the requirements for message passing within Lattice QCD applications; (2) a <b>draft</b> <b>message</b> API for both C and C++; and (3) implementation design ideas. The API is intended to be sufficiently flexible to be used by all Lattice QCD applications, and execute efficiently on all existing and anticipated platforms, so that {{there is no need to}} directly call non-portable message passing routines. Because of the highly regular grid communications with LQCD, MPI calls (which are more general) impose some additional overhead that is predicted to be non-negligible for large machines. Depending upon demand, a subset of MPI could be implemented above this new API so that legacy codes which use MPI could function on the new architectures which implement (only) the new API. Further, the new API has been implemented atop MPI so that new applications using this new API can still be run on older machines for which only MPI is available. Interspersed with the API description are some descriptions for how the API could be implemented for myrinet clusters and the QCDOC machine. These are meant to more fully illustrate the functionality, and are not intended as the final design. At the time of writing, the following implementations exist: (1) QMP-GM [...] Uses GM; (2) QMP-MPI [...] Uses MPI; tested above MPICH-GM, MPICH-SM (shared memory), and MPICH-P 4 (sockets) ...|$|E

Parents have the primary control over the home {{environment}} and {{play an important role in}} the child obesity prevention. Obesity prevention programs to help parents develop an obesity-preventive home environment are needed. The purpose of this study was to collect formative research from parents of 8 – 10 -year old African American girls about perceptions, expectations, and content for a text messaging based program. Mothers (n = 30) participated in surveys and interviews to inform message development and content. A professional expert panel (n = 10) reviewed <b>draft</b> text <b>messages</b> via a survey. All the mothers reported owning a cellphone with an unlimited texting plan, and they used their cellphones for texting (90. 0 %) and accessing the Internet (100. 0 %). The majority were interested in receiving text messages about healthy eating and physical activity (86. 7 %). Interviews confirmed survey findings. One hundred and seven text messages promoting an obesity-preventive home environment were developed.

Reduce offensiveness strategy garners bolstering, minimization, differentiation, transcendence, attack accuser, and compensation.|$|R

40|$|Objective: The project {{aimed to}} {{test of the}} quality and {{acceptability}} of researcher-developed Short Message Service (SMS) messages designed to support fathers of infants aged 12 months or less. Background: The findings of previous studies suggest antenatal and postnatal depression among fathers' impacts negatively {{on the health of}} family members. Method: <b>Draft</b> <b>messages</b> were first modified based on expert review. In a second phase, parents (mothers n = 56; fathers n = 46; unknown n = 4) were recruited through two early childhood parenting services to rate the clarity, usefulness and relevance of the 70 SMS messages using a paper-based survey. In a third phase, 15 fathers were recruited to receive texts at different times over three weeks. Results: Findings suggest that SMS items were easily understood by the majority of parents, with only 3 % of responses indicating an item was 'not easily understood'. Feedback from parents indicated that negatively rated SMS messages were considered as either poorly phrased, lacking enough information or as not offering sufficient support. The majority (88 %) of the SMS items were also rated as 'useful' by the parents. Conclusion: Fathers' responses indicated that receiving the texts at different times was acceptable and that message content was relevant to their fathering. The study has produced a set of brief text messages suitable and acceptable to new fathers and their partners...|$|R

One guideline that helps in the drafting stage is to write as though you are presenting the information to a friend. Rather than thinking of the audience as just “someone out there,” think of the audience as a specific person with whom you are building or maintaining a relationship.
