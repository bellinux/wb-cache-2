They scavenge animals either dead from natural causes (disease) or killed by other predators, and keep a constant lookout for circling vultures, being keenly aware that they indicate an animal dead or in <b>distress.</b> <b>In</b> fact, most dead prey on which both hyenas and lions feed upon are killed by the hyenas instead of the lions.|$|E

Troilus mocks the lovelorn glances of other men who put their trust in women before falling victim to love himself when he sees Cressida, here a young widow, in the Palladium, the temple of Athena. Troilus keeps his love secret and is made miserable by it. Pandarus, Troilus' best friend and Cressida's cousin in {{this version of the}} story, acts as go-between after persuading Troilus to explain his <b>distress.</b> <b>In</b> accordance with the conventions of courtly love, Troilus' love remains secret from all except Pandarus, until Cassandra eventually divines the reason for Troilus' subsequent distress.|$|E
5|$|Gomphus clavatus is edible; it {{is rated}} as choice by some, while others find it tasteless. It has an earthy flavor and meaty texture {{that has been}} {{regarded}} as suiting red meat dishes. Like many edible fungi, consumption may cause gastrointestinal <b>distress</b> <b>in</b> susceptible individuals. The flesh becomes bitter with age, and older specimens may be infested with insects. Insect infestation is unlikely {{if the weather is}} cool. G.clavatus has been used for cooking for some time—Fries included it in his 1867 book Sveriges ätliga och giftiga svampar (Edible and Poisonous Mushrooms in Sweden). It is highly regarded by the Zapotec people of Ixtlán de Juárez in Oaxaca, Mexico, and the Sherpa people in the vicinity of Sagarmatha National Park in Nepal.|$|E

However, baby Clara Shelley was sick and traveling made her even more ill. She died shortly after arriving in Venice. In the winter of 1818, Percy registered a child in Naples to himself and Mary: Elena Adelaide. However, it is unclear who this child's parents really were.|$|E

In addition, interest rates rose quickly, making the club unable to meet its financial obligations. At the same time, the club experienced falling attendance. In 1985, the club's auditor warned that the club was heading into financial <b>distress.</b> <b>In</b> 1986, the club spent NOK1 million to build terraces between the club house and the pitch on the northern short side, and terraces on the southern short side.

5|$|Air Europe {{fell under}} {{financial}} <b>distress</b> <b>in</b> 1991 and terminated all its Gatwick operations on 8 March. This resulted in Norway Airlines having to ground both its aircraft. Before operations could commence, the two creditors of the aircraft, Fokus Bank and Christiania Bank, had to refinance the two holding companies. As the aircraft remained grounded {{when the military}} contract started on 1 April, Norway Airlines had to lease aircraft externally to operate the charters. The aircraft were freed up {{towards the end of}} April, allowing the services with Gullivers Reiser to commence on 28 April. Originally the leases on the aircraft expired 1 April 1993 and 1994, respectively, but Norway Airlines renegotiated them to both expire 1 April 1994. The Gullivers Reiser contract involved flying from Norway to Greece, Spain, Portugal and Turkey. Air Europe's bankruptcy cost Norway Airlines NOK6 million and required the company to reduce its staff from 196 to 106 employees. One aircraft was fully utilized, although the second was occasionally operated for Star Tour, Vingreiser and British Airways.|$|E
5|$|Cleveland's {{enduring}} {{reputation as}} chief executive and his recent pronouncements on the monetary issues made him a leading contender for the Democratic nomination. His leading opponent was David B. Hill, a Senator for New York. Hill united the anti-Cleveland elements of the Democratic party—silverites, protectionists, and Tammany Hall—but was unable to create a coalition large enough to deny Cleveland the nomination. Despite some desperate maneuvering by Hill, Cleveland was nominated on the first ballot at the convention in Chicago. For vice president, the Democrats chose to balance the ticket with Adlai E. Stevenson of Illinois, a silverite. Although the Cleveland forces preferred Isaac P. Gray of Indiana for vice president, they accepted the convention favorite. As a supporter of greenbacks and Free Silver to inflate the currency and alleviate economic <b>distress</b> <b>in</b> the rural districts, Stevenson balanced the otherwise hard-money, gold-standard ticket headed by Cleveland.|$|E
