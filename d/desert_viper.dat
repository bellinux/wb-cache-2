25|$|The tournament was {{the first}} contesting of the Stanbic Bank 20 Series to be played {{following}} a restructure of Zimbabwean cricket that resulted in five franchises, the Mashonaland Eagles, Matabeleland Tuskers, Mid West Rhinos, Mountaineers and Southern Rocks. These five teams were joined by the <b>Desert</b> <b>Vipers,</b> a team representing Namibia. Hamilton Masakadza of the Mountaineers finished the competition with the most runs, amassing 317 {{at an average of}} 63.40, while Tony Palladino of the visiting <b>Desert</b> <b>Vipers</b> claimed the most wickets, taking 12 at an average of 9.66. Masakadza was named as player of the series, and also batsman of the series, and Palladino was chosen as bowler of the series. Masakadza scored the only century of the competition, passing 100 during the Mountaineers group match against the Southern Rocks.|$|R

50|$|The {{competition}} {{consisted of}} a round-robin group stage, followed directly by the final and third-place play-off. The Mashonaland Eagles topped the group stage, winning four of their five games, and faced the second-placed team, the Mountaineers in the final. The third-place play-off was contested between the teams finishing third and fourth in the group, the <b>Desert</b> <b>Vipers</b> and the Matabeleland Tuskers, both of which had won two matches, lost two, and had a match abandoned.|$|R

50|$|Claymore moved {{operations}} to the neighboring country. He was soon joined by Lt. Falcon, Dusty, Snake Eyes, and Scarlett. The five Joes ran a recon mission {{over the border}} to spy on some construction. They were attacked by Overkill and some <b>Desert</b> <b>Vipers</b> and captured. However, they were let go by the Crimson Twins {{in order not to}} cause an incident since Cobra just took control of Badhikstan from the Coil and did not want any retaliation from the Joes.|$|R

In Egypt it is called el-ṭorîsha (حية الطريشة); in Libya it is called [...] "um-Goron" [...] (ام قرون).|$|E
50|$|The exact {{species of}} serpents used varies by region. In India, the Indian cobra is preferred, though some charmers may also use Russell's vipers. Indian and Burmese pythons, and even {{mangrove}} snakes are also encountered, {{though they are}} not as popular.In North Africa, the Egyptian cobra, puff adder, carpet viper and horned <b>desert</b> <b>viper</b> are commonly featured in performances.|$|E
50|$|Lizards are {{the most}} common reptile in Qatar. There are more than 21 species of lizards, with the most common family being Gekkonidae (9 species). Other common {{families}} include Lacertidae (4 species), Agamidae (3 species), Scincidae (2 species), and Varanidae, Sphaerodactylidae, and Trogonophidae with one species each. The horned <b>desert</b> <b>viper,</b> a venomous viper species, has been recorded in the country but is rarely sighted.|$|E
50|$|Some animals use {{eavesdropping}} {{to either}} catch their prey or {{to avoid being}} caught by predators. Some snakes are able to perceive and react to substrate-borne vibrations. The vibrations are transmitted through the lower jaw, which is often rested {{on the ground and}} is connected with the inner ear. They also detect vibrations directly with receptors on their body surface. Studies on horned <b>desert</b> <b>vipers</b> (Cerastes cerastes) showed they strongly rely on vibrational cues for capturing prey. Localisation of the prey is probably aided by the two halves of the lower jaw being independent.|$|R
50|$|Some {{species of}} venomous snakes stridulate {{as part of}} a threat display. They arrange their body into a series of {{parallel}} C-shaped (counterlooped) coils that they rub together to produce a sizzling sound, rather like water on a hot plate. The best-known examples are members of the genus Echis (saw-scaled vipers), although those of the genus Cerastes (North African <b>desert</b> <b>vipers)</b> and at least one bush viper species, Atheris desaixi, do this as well. A bird species, the club-winged manakin, has a dedicated stridulation apparatus, while a species of mammal, the lowland streaked tenrec, (Hemicentetes semispinosus) produces a high-pitched noise by rubbing together specialised quills on its back.|$|R
50|$|The tournament {{was renamed}} as the Stanbic Bank 20 Series. Stanbic Bank (Uganda) Limited {{was the new}} sponsors. This was after the {{reorganization}} of Zimbabwean cricket and as a result, new franchises started {{taking part in the}} competition. They are Mashonaland Eagles (formerly Northerns), Southern Rocks (formerly Southerns), Mountaineers (formerly Easterns), Matabeleland Tuskers (formerly Westerns), and Mid West Rhinos (formerly Centrals). In addition, the <b>Desert</b> <b>Vipers</b> also participated as a sixth team. Craig Williams captained the side. Mountaineers was easily the strongest team in the tournament final, but they were quite shaky in the group stage. Among the 5 matches they played, they won 3 and lost 2. Stronger than them was Mashonaland Eagles, who had finished first in the pool. Particularly effective against them was Eagle's bowler Ray Price who downed them by 82 runs at Harare taking remarkable figures of 5/12 in just 17 deliveries finishing off the game by the stumping of Natsai Mushangwe.|$|R
40|$|International audienceCerastotin, a thrombin-like enzyme {{from the}} venom of the <b>desert</b> <b>viper</b> Cerastes cerastes, has been {{purified}} by gel filtration on Sephadex G- 75 and two ion-exchange chromatographies on Mono S columns. It is a neutral glycoprotein (pI = 6. 6), present {{as a single}} polypeptide chain of 40 kDa. Its N-terminal sequence shows strong similarity {{with those of other}} thrombin-like enzymes from snake venoms. Cerastotin possesses esterase and amidolytic activities measured with N(alpha) -tosyl-L-arginine methyl ester and the thrombin chromogenic substrate D-phenylalanyl-L-pipecolyl-L-arginine p-nitroanilide, respectively. The amidolytic activity is inhibited by phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, N(alpha) -tosyl-L-lysine chloromethane, N(alpha) -tosyl-L-phenylalanyl chloromethane, D-phenylalanyl-L-prolyl-L-arginyl chloromethane and benzamidine, suggesting that cerastotin is a serine protease. Cerastotin efficiently clots human plasma and cleaves preferentially the alpha chain of fibrinogen. Cerastotin did not induce aggregation of washed normal platelets, but did aggregate platelets in the presence of exogenous fibrinogen. A monoclonal antibody directed against glycoprotein (GPIb), which specifically inhibits induced agglutination by ristocetin also completely blocks platelet aggregation induced by cerastotin. However, another anti-GPIb monoclonal antibody, which specifically inhibits alpha-thrombin binding to GPIb, did not prevent this aggregation. Furthermore, platelets which were desensitised by alpha-thrombin still aggregate in the presence of cerastotin, but not alpha-thrombin. Similarly a monoclonal antibody, anti-GPIIb-IIIa, which blocks fibrinogen binding, did not inhibit cerastotin-induced platelet aggregation. This activity is abolished in the presence of 1 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride and/or 10 mM EDTA. Cerastotin also agglutinates formalin-fixed and washed platelets, only in the simultaneous presence of fibrinogen and of Von Willebrand factor...|$|E
50|$|This snake {{ranges from}} the white coastal sand dunes of Namibia, near Lüderitz, south to Hondeklip Bay, Little Namaqualand, South Africa. Mallow et al. (2003) {{describe}} the range as the transitional regions of the Namib <b>Desert.</b> The <b>viper's</b> habitat comprises a comparatively narrow strip of coastal dunes {{that appears to be}} characterized by particularly low seasonality, i.e. small temperature differences between seasons. The range may extend up to 60 km inland in the Sperrgebiet of southern Namibia.|$|R

Common birds include the owl, roadrunner, cactus wren, and various species of hawk. The area's reptilian life include the sidewinder <b>viper,</b> <b>desert</b> tortoise, and horned toad. The upper Sonoran zone boasts mammals such as the antelope, brown-footed woodrat, and ring-tailed cat. Birds unique to this zone are the California thrasher, bushtit, and California condor.|$|R
40|$|Background: The <b>desert</b> horned <b>vipers</b> (Cerastes cerastes and C. gasperettii) are {{the most}} {{familiar}} snakes of the great deserts of North Africa and the Middle East, including the plains of Iraq. They are responsible for many human snake bites. In Western countries, they are popular among exotic-snake keepers. Aim: To investigate mechanisms of life-threatening envenoming and treatment. Design: Clinical investigation. Methods: Clinical and laboratory studies with measurement of serum venom antigen concentrations by enzyme immunoassay. Results: Two men bitten while handling captive Saharan horned vipers (Cerastes cerastes) in Europe developed extensive local swelling and life-threatening systemic envenoming, characterized by coagulopathy, increased fibrinolysis, thrombocytopenia, micro-angiopathic haemolytic anaemia and acute renal failure. The clinical picture is explicable by the presence in C. cerastes venom of several thrombin-like, Factor-X-activating, platelet-aggregating, haemorrhagic and nephrotoxic components. In one case, prophylactic use of subcutaneous epinephrine {{may have contributed to}} intracranial haemorrhage. The roles in treatment of heparin (rejected) and specific antivenom (recommended) are discussed. Discussion: Cerastes cerastes is capable of life-threatening envenoming in humans. Optimal treatment of envenoming is by early administration of specific antivenom, and avoidance of ineffective and potentially-dangerous ancillary methods...|$|R
