500|$|The {{mayor of}} Rajneeshpuram, David Berry Knapp (known as Swami Krishna Deva or KD), turned state's {{evidence}} and gave {{an account of}} {{his knowledge of the}} Salmonella attack to the FBI. He claimed that Sheela said [...] "she had talked with [...] about the plot to decrease voter turnout in The Dalles by making people sick. Sheela said that [...] commented that it was best not to hurt people, but if a few died not to worry." [...] In Miller's , this statement is attributed to Sheela: According to KD's testimony, she played doubters a tape of Rajneesh's muffled voice saying, [...] "if it was necessary to <b>do</b> <b>things</b> <b>to</b> preserve [...] vision, then do it," [...] and interpreted this to mean that murder in his name was fine, telling doubters [...] "not to worry" [...] if a few people had to die. The investigation uncovered a September 25, 1984, invoice from the American Type Culture Collection of microbes, showing an order received by the Rajneeshpuram laboratory for Salmonella typhi, the bacterium that causes the life-threatening illness typhoid fever.|$|E

It was about letting the tape machine roll and getting the music down spontaneously." [...] When asked about {{the message of the}} song, Wade said, [...] "I think the main message of this song, at least for me personally when I was writing the lyrics, is just how difficult it can be to be in a relationship. Sometimes, you <b>do</b> <b>things</b> <b>to</b> disappoint the other person. Letting someone down and trying to repair a relationship that you feel is kind of slipping through your hands a bit." [...] "Whatever It Takes" [...] was originally released with the band's fourth studio album, Who We Are, on June 18, 2007 and was officially solicited as a single to mainstream radio on November 13, 2007.|$|E

2500|$|Whether {{scholars}} {{agree or}} {{not with the}} idea that, over time and place, cultures have [...] "forg and nourish" [...] links between women and compassion or {{with the idea that}} affective piety was primarily associated with the feminine and femininity, McNamer's book offers a new methodology for understanding what affective devotional practices sought to foster in their users: they were [...] "mechanisms for the production of feeling." [...] Building on work by Barbara Rosenwein and William Reddy, she argues that affective prayers and meditations [...] "are, quite literally, scripts for the performance of feeling—scripts that often explicitly aspire to performative efficacy." [...] McNamer writes that these scripts are much like 's category of [...] "Emotives." [...] In the passage from Reddy as quoted by McNamer, emotives are [...] "'first person, present tense emotion claims' that potentially, but not always, function as performatives; they are 'similar to performatives (and differ from constatives) in that emotives <b>do</b> <b>things</b> <b>to</b> the world. Emotives are themselves instruments for directly changing, building, hiding, intensifying emotions, instruments that may be more or less successful.'" ...|$|E
