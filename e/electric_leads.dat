50|$|Essential {{safety gear}} needed is {{closed-in}} footwear, very high grade ear protectors (especially {{if using a}} high-revving electric plane or router), eye shields when cutting or grinding metal, disposable gloves when gluing, close-fitting clothes that will not get caught in drills. Good light is essential. Boat builders should not work when they are tired and should keep the work floor clean so they don't trip over tools or wood or <b>electric</b> <b>leads.</b> A fan is handy for extra ventilation if the work space does not have many opening windows or doors. Many boat builders like smaller tools to be bright-coloured tools {{so they can see}} them easily amongst saw dust. With the recent technological advances in materials being used in modern boat building including GRP and FGRP repiratory protection masks have become essential in many workshops. The only suitable alternative being substantial dust extraction equipment by means of on-tool extraction or a fully fit out environmental cleaning workshop installation.|$|E
5000|$|Robert Fisk, the British {{journalist}} {{who has spent}} 25 years reporting from Lebanon, said about this prison:“The sadists of Khiam used to electrocute the penises of their prisoners and throw water over their bodies before plunging electrodes into their chests and kept them in pitch-black, solitary confinement for months. For many years, the Israelis even banned the Red Cross from visiting their foul prison. All the torturers fled {{across the border into}} Israel when the Israeli army retreated under fire from Lebanon almost seven years ago.”“There was the whipping pole and the window grilles where prisoners were tied naked for days, freezing water thrown over them at night. Then there were the <b>electric</b> <b>leads</b> for the little dynamo — the machine mercifully taken off to Israel by the interrogators — which had the inmates shrieking with pain when the electrodes touched their fingers or penises. And there were the handcuffs which an ex-prisoner handed to me yesterday afternoon. They were used over years to bind the arms of prisoners before interrogation. And they wore them, day and night, as they were kicked — kicked so badly in Sulieman Ramadan's case that they later had to amputate his arm. Another prisoner was so badly beaten, he lost the use of a leg. I found his crutch in Khiam prison yesterday, along with piles of Red Cross letters from prisoners — letters which the guards from Israel's now-defunct [...] "South Lebanon Army" [...] militia never bothered to forward”. http://www.robert-fisk.com/articles2.htmIn some prison cells, there were small metal cages, torturers used to make the prisoners sit inside of them and then start hitting the cage from the outside, sometimes for hours, as a form of mental torture.|$|E

40|$|Motivated by the Jaynes-Cummings (JC) model, we {{consider}} here a quantum dot coupled simultaneously to {{a reservoir of}} photons and to two <b>electric</b> <b>leads</b> (free-fermion reservoirs). This Jaynes-Cummings-Leads (JCL) model makes possible that the fermion current through the dot creates a photon flux, which describes a light-emitting device. The same model is also describe a transformation of the photon flux into current of fermions, i. e. a quantum dot light-absorbing device. The key tool to obtain these results is an abstract Landauer-Büttiker formula...|$|E
40|$|We use a novel {{technique}} to experimentally explore transport properties through a single metallic nanoparticle with variable coupling to <b>electric</b> <b>leads.</b> For strong dot-lead coupling the conductance is an oscillatory {{function of the}} gate voltage with periodicity determined by the charging energy, as expected. For weaker coupling we observe the appearance of additional multi-periodic oscillations of the conductance with the gate voltage. These harmonics correspond to a change of the charge on the dot by {{a fraction of an}} electron. This notion is supported by theoretical calculations based on dissipative action theory. Within this framework the multiple periodicity of the conductance oscillations arises due to non-pertubative instanton solutions. Comment: 4 pages, 5 figure...|$|E

40|$|We study {{shot noise}} in {{tunneling}} current through a double quantum dot connected to two <b>electric</b> <b>leads.</b> We derive two master equations in the occupation-state basis and the eigenstate basis {{to describe the}} electron dynamics. The approach based on the occupation-state basis, despite being widely used in many previous studies, is valid only when the interdot coupling strength is {{much smaller than the}} energy difference between the two dots. In contrast, the calculations using the eigenstate basis are valid for an arbitrary interdot coupling. Using realistic model parameters, we demonstrate that the predicted currents and shot-noise properties from the two approaches are significantly different when the interdot coupling is not small. Furthermore, properties of the shot noise predicted using the eigenstate basis successfully reproduce qualitative features found in a recent experiment. Department of Applied Physic...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. Here {{we propose}} a new design {{paradigm}} for a superconducting nanowire single photon detector {{that uses a}} multi-layer architecture that places the <b>electric</b> <b>leads</b> beneath the nanowires. This allows for {{a very large number}} of detector elements, which we will call pixels in analogy to a conventional CCD camera, to be placed in close proximity. This leads to significantly better photon number resolution than current single and multi-nanowire meanders, while maintaining similar detection areas. We discuss the reset time of the pixels and how the design can be modified to avoid the latching failure seen in extremely short superconducting nanowires. These advantages give a multi-layer superconducting number-resolving photon detector significant advantages over the current design paradigm of long superconducting nanowire meanders. Such advantages are desirable in a wide array of photonics applications. PACS numbers: 85. 25. Oj, 74. 78. -w a...|$|E

40|$|A {{system for}} the {{uninterrupted}} collection of distillate and for the accurate measurement of its production rate. developed for a flash evaporation research apparatus, is described. The system incorporates a non-contact level controller which can also have other applications. The uninterrupted collection of distillate and the accurate measurement of its production rate are important objectives {{in the design of}} most distillation units and are beset by difficulties for which a clear anstver is not found in the available literature. This brief note describes a system which has been developed and successfully used for this purpose in a flash evaporation research apparatus (I) for the desalination of seawater. The non-contact level controller developed at this Laboratory can have many other applications related to level control and moni-toring. It is simple, reliable, relatively inexpensive, and is free of the technical difficulties associated with the penetration of instruments and/or their <b>electric</b> <b>leads</b> through the walls of a vacuum/pressure enclosure, and with the immersion of such instruments in the hot liquid and vapor...|$|E
30|$|The {{observed}} {{enhancement of}} in-plane conductivity under illumination might be explained {{also by the}} bridging effect via the semi-conductive and photosensitive PPy. To resolve this issue, we have measured mobility of charge carriers using Hall effect. Mobility of holes in PPy and diamond differs by at least five orders of magnitude (H-terminated diamond: 100 - 102 cm 2 /Vs, PPy: 10 - 5 - 10 - 10 cm 2 /Vs). We prepared microscopic conductive square (10 × 10 μ m 2) with <b>electric</b> <b>leads</b> at the corners by selective hydrogen and oxygen terminations. A resin layer with the opening at {{the position of the}} square has been prepared by UV lithography to restrict the active area for electrochemical deposition. PPy was electrochemically synthesized under similar conditions as described in the previous sections. The Hall voltage was detected by two electrometers, and the current of 2 pA was supplied by Keithley 220 source. The magnetic field applied during the experiment was ± 0.2 T. The mobility was evaluated from the Hall voltages to 7 cm 2 /Vs [47]. However, the Hall voltages were slowly drifting in time, and thus the mobility was obtained with high error bar of 20 cm 2 /Vs.|$|E
40|$|A {{model is}} {{presented}} for the quantum transport of electrons, across finite atomic wire nanojunctions between <b>electric</b> <b>leads,</b> at zero bias limit. In order to derive the appropriate transmission and reflection spectra, familiar in the Landauer-Büttiker formalism, we develop the algebraic phase field matching theory (PFMT). In particular, we apply our model calculations {{to determine the}} electronic conductance for freely suspended monatomic linear sodium wires (MLNaW) between leads of the same element, and for the diatomic copper-cobalt wires (DLCuCoW) between copper leads on a Cu(111) substrate. Calculations for the MLNaW system confirm the correctness and functionality of our PFMT approach. We present novel transmission spectra for this system, and show that its transport properties exhibit the conductance oscillations for the odd- and even-number wires in agreement with previously reported first-principle results. The numerical calculations for the DLCuCoW wire nanojunctions are motivated by the stability of these systems at low temperatures. Our results for the transmission spectra yield for this system, at its Fermi energy, a monotonic exponential decay of the conductance with increasing wire length of the Cu-Co pairs. This is a cumulative effect which is discussed in detail in the present work, and may prove useful for applications in nanocircuits. Furthermore, our PFMT formalism {{can be considered as}} a compact and efficient tool {{for the study of the}} electronic quantum transport for a wide range of nanomaterial wire systems. It provides a trade-off in computational efficiency and predictive capability as compared to slower first-principle based methods, and has the potential to treat the conductance properties of more complex molecular nanojunctions.

40|$|Device-based baroreflex {{activation}} therapy (BAT) is {{a promising}} {{new approach to}} the treatment of drug-resis-tant hypertension. 1, 2 It is thought that stimulation of the carotid baroreceptor area lowers sympathetic outflow and increases vagal tone. Indeed, a close correlation has been observed between stimulation and muscle sympathetic nerve activity. 3 Indirect measures of autonomic function also suggest that the balance between its 2 arms is shifted toward less sympathetic and more parasympathetic tone. 4 The Rheos Pivotal trial (NCT 00442286), which to date is the only randomized clinical trial, which evaluated the long-term effects of BAT, has used the Rheos device. This device consists of an implantable pulse generator and 2 <b>electric</b> <b>leads,</b> which are fixed around both carotid arteries at the loca-tion where the greatest response on stimulation is observed. Thus, this device requires bilateral surgery, which may be a drawback for further introduction into clinical practice. If {{it would be possible to}} stimulate on one side only with similar effects as during bilateral stimulation this would substantially enhance the clinical acceptability of this invasive procedure. Technical developments have made it possible already to implant a device with 1 stimulation lead and preliminary data suggest that it is, indeed, feasible to apply one-sided stimu-lation. 5 Currently, trials are in progress, which evaluate the efficacy of this Barostim neo device in patients with heart fail-ure. However, we still need to answer the question whether unilateral stimulation is as effective as bilateral stimulation. Moreover, we need to know whether in case of unilateral stim-ulation the left or the right side is to be preferred. Fortunately, the database of the Rheos Pivotal trial offers an opportunity to answer these questions. In this trial all patients received bilat-eral stimulation electrodes but during the course of the trial a number of patients were stimulated unilaterally. This report summarizes the main findings in these patients...|$|E
