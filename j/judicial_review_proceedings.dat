If {{there is no}} appropriate authorized Government department, or the person wishing to commence proceedings has reasonable doubt as to which department (if any) is appropriate, proceedings should be commenced against the Attorney-General. This rule applies to <b>judicial</b> <b>review</b> <b>proceedings</b> in which prerogative orders or declarations are sought.|$|E
5|$|In {{the event}} that a person lacks standing, there is a {{possibility}} that he or she may be able to ask the Attorney-General to allow him or her to bring a relator action. In this scenario, the Attorney-General would be the nominal plaintiff in the <b>judicial</b> <b>review</b> <b>proceedings,</b> but the case would actually be conducted by the individual. Bringing a relator action is one means of circumventing the requirement of standing on the part of the individual applicant, because the Attorney-General has an interest in upholding the law for the public benefit.|$|E

25|$|A special {{aspect of}} the High Court's {{original}} jurisdiction is its <b>judicial</b> <b>review</b> jurisdiction. This jurisdiction is implied rather than expressly stated in any statute. The Court exercises two types of <b>judicial</b> review: <b>judicial</b> <b>review</b> under the Constitution of Singapore, and <b>judicial</b> <b>review</b> of administrative acts.

Their submission on the technical point was accompanied by cultural arguments that 'the youth of Tallaght will be restricted to a diet of Association football' and that a soccer-only ground would place the 'applicant at a severe disadvantage in attracting the youth of Tallaght to the club, the sport and the GAA culture.

5|$|Section 8B(2) {{contained}} an ouster clause that restricted {{the scope of}} judicial review to any question relating to compliance with any procedural requirements of the ISA governing acts or decisions by the President or the Home Affairs Minister. The amendments to the ISA were made retrospective by section 8D, which meant that they applied to <b>judicial</b> <b>review</b> <b>proceedings</b> that had been started before the amendment Act came into force. In addition, the Constitution was amended through the Constitution of the Republic of Singapore (Amendment) Act 1989 to prevent the Internal Security (Amendment) Act 1989 from being challenged as unconstitutional. Article 149(3) was inserted into the Constitution, with the effect that {{if the issue of}} whether any executive decision made pursuant to the ISA came before a court (whether before or after this constitutional amendment came into force on 27 January 1989), the court had to decide this issue according to the new provisions introduced by the 1989 ISA amendments. Article 149(1) was amended to add Articles 11 and 12 to the list of fundamental liberties that the ISA cannot be challenged against, and to extend its immunizing effect to the 1989 ISA amendments.|$|E
40|$|Should {{courts have}} the power to examine the legislature’s {{enactment}} process and strike down statutes enacted contrary to procedural lawmaking requirements? This idea remains highly controversial. While substantive <b>judicial</b> <b>review</b> is well-established and often taken for granted, many judges and scholars see <b>judicial</b> <b>review</b> of the legislative process as utterly objectionable. This Article challenges that prevalent position and establishes the case for <b>judicial</b> <b>review</b> of the legislative process. The Article contends that, ironically, some of the major arguments for substantive <b>judicial</b> <b>review</b> in constitutional theory, and even the arguments in Marbury v. Madison itself, are actually more persuasive when applied to <b>judicial</b> <b>review</b> of the legislative process. Furthermore, the Article claims that some of the arguments raised by leading critics of <b>judicial</b> <b>review</b> may actually be employed as arguments justifying <b>judicial</b> <b>review</b> of the lawmaking process. Therefore, countering the orthodoxy in American constitutional law and theory, the Article argues that <b>judicial</b> <b>review</b> of the enactment process is no less important and is, in fact, more justifiable than substantive <b>judicial</b> <b>review...</b>|$|R

25|$|Justice Chan {{began by}} affirming that the High Court has {{jurisdiction}} {{to issue an}} order of prohibition against the Government. Although section 27 of the Government Proceedings Act states that courts cannot grant an injunction in civil proceedings against the Government, he rejected the State Counsel's argument that based on this provision the Court did not have power to do so. He held that the reference in section 27 to civil proceedings it did not relate to <b>judicial</b> <b>review</b> <b>proceedings</b> and, hence, that provision {{did not affect the}} court's ability to grant an order of prohibition during a judicial review of government proceedings.|$|E

25|$|Yaw Shin Leong, {{a member}} of the Workers' Party of Singapore, was elected as a Member of Parliament (MP) for Hougang Single Member Constituency (SMC) at the 2011 general election.

As a result, pursuant to Article 46(2)(b) of the Constitution of the Republic of Singapore, he lost his parliamentary seat which became vacant, leaving the residents of Hougang SMC unrepresented. This spurred the applicant, Madam Vellama d/o (daughter of) Marie Muthu, a voter resident in Hougang SMC, to commence <b>judicial</b> <b>review</b> <b>proceedings</b> in the High Court on 2 March 2012 to compel the Government to call a by-election.

Minister for Home Affairs (1988) was a {{landmark}} Court of Appeal case in administrative law, specifically {{with regards to}} reviewing the grounds of detention without trial under the Internal Security Act. One of the main issues before the court was whether the test for judicial review was objective or subjective; in other words, whether judges could examine whether the executive's decision to detain a person was in fact based on national security considerations, as well as whether the executive's considerations in determining the detention fell {{within the scope of}} the purposes specified in section 8(1) of the Act. The court, in an obiter ruling, advocated the objective standard, stating: [...] "All power has legal limits {{and the rule of law}} demands that the courts should be able to examine the exercise of discretionary power."
