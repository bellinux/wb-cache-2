Sir Percival Perry, who had effectively established the British operations of the Ford Motor Company and who had been appointed Assistant Controller of the UK government's Agricultural Machinery Department during the war, and Sir Noel Mobbs, led the group of investors who acquired the depot, establishing the Slough Trading Co. Ltd. Repair and sale of ex-army vehicles continued until 1925 when the Slough Trading Company Act was passed allowing the company (renamed Slough Estates Ltd) to establish an Industrial Estate. The existing army buildings were tenanted as factories, and additional units were built. Those on the Bath Road and Farnham Road frontages were designed with fundamentally uniform simple Art Deco offices on the front. Shared facilities were provided for workforce and employers, including a fire station, restaurant, shops and banks, a large community centre (1937) and the Slough <b>Industrial</b> <b>Health</b> <b>Service</b> (1947).|$|E

40|$|Background: Non-communicable {{diseases}} (NCDs) {{and psychological}} hazards are increasingly observed in industries, necessitating {{the need to}} strengthen <b>industrial</b> <b>health</b> systems to control the same. District level data on level of functioning of <b>industrial</b> <b>health</b> systems and <b>services</b> with special focus on systems available for mental health care is lacking in India. This information is vital to plan need-based interventions for system strengthening. Objective: To assess the status of functioning of <b>industrial</b> <b>health</b> systems and <b>services</b> in Kolar district, India, with special focus on systems and services available for mental health care. Methods: This cross-sectional study was undertaken between October and December 2014 on a stratified random sample of 69 industries located in Kolar, which were stratified proportionately by their hazardous nature. Interview and observation checklist {{were used to assess}} and classify functioning of <b>industrial</b> <b>health</b> systems and <b>services</b> including those available for mental health care. Results: Occupational safety and health (OSH) policy was present in 56 % and health insurance in 39 % of the 69 industries assessed. Pre-placement and periodical medical examination were conducted in 23 % of industries. <b>Health</b> systems and <b>services</b> in hazardous industries were functioning at less than 50 % level of functioning. <b>Health</b> systems and <b>services</b> for mental <b>health</b> care were non-existent. Conclusion: There is a need in Kolar district, India, to integrate the mental health components within existing <b>industrial</b> <b>health</b> systems, as per policy directives to implement setting based approaches in mental health programs...|$|R
40|$|In 1985 Lord Taylor of Harlow {{offered his}} papers to Memorial University and the gift was welcomed - {{despite the fact}} that only a minor portion of the {{collection}} relates to his tenure as University President, - from 1967 - 1973. - - The significance of this collection rests in its integrity, spanning as it does a full life-time, and representing - all facets of Taylor's varied career, from his school days, through his medical training at St. Thomas's - Hospital, and his early clinical and psychiatric work. His wartime career with the Home Intelligence - Division of the Ministry of Information and the Wartime Social Survey generated two boxes of reports - which provide a wealth of material on conditions in wartime Britain. - - In political life he held advisory roles in the fields of health, housing, education and commonwealth - relations. - - Specifically these papers chronicle the life of a 'man and his times'. As a Labour M. P., an administrator - and a doctor, Taylor was in the fore-front of much of the social and political reform which took place in - post war Britain, and it is to the biographer and social historian of this era that the collection will prove its - value. - - Of particular interest are the Commonplace Books, a carefully annotated collection of medical, political - and social notes, and news cuttings including many of his Parliamentary speeches, in scrap-book form, - from 1954 to 1974. - - The collection includes personal papers from his career as Director of Home Intelligence and Wartime Social Survey in the British Ministry of Information (1940 - 1944), as Labour M.

40|$|In {{reviewing}} the Hungarian situation {{it is said}} that the ideals of a higher living standard and economic security have a much broader appeal in public opinion than equality. The impacts of state intervention to reduce inequalities are reduced by several factors such as the tipping system and centralization. Official statistics do not entirely shed light on prevailing inequities in health, in particular those related to phenomena outside the health system, i. e. there is a heavy biomedical bias. Some contradictory developments are identified. One of these is that successful factories have created independent <b>industrial</b> <b>health</b> care <b>services</b> for their workers which not infrequently provide a higher quality of care than the state system. Furthermore, sociology has not played that generalizing and integrating function in the uncovering of inequalities in health as it has in Western countries. One of the rare sociological studies in the field shows that the population considers health only fourth among other desired values. Due to the increase in mortality, the issue of health has recently become more focused in the public debate. In general, this paper considers that the health system conforms with other Hungarian social realities in the realm of economics and politics as well as in value-orientation. This has been reflected in the recently reorganized ministry that now also comprises social welfare. Hungary medical sociology health systems inequalities...|$|R

2500|$|The {{economy of}} Como, {{until the end}} of the 1980s, was {{traditionally}} based on industry; in particular, the city was world-famous for its silk manufacturers, but in recent years cheap competition from China has significantly reduced profit margins and many small and mid-sized firms have gone out of business. As a consequence manufacturing is no longer the economic driver and the city has been absorbed into Milan's metropolitan area where it mainly provides workers to the service industry sector. A significant number of residents are employed in the nearby industrial areas of the Swiss towns of Lugano and Mendrisio, primarily in the <b>industrial</b> sector, <b>health</b> care <b>services</b> and in the hospitality industry; the [...] commute is beneficial as wages in Switzerland are notably higher. For these reasons, tourism has become increasingly important for the local economy since the 1990s. The city and the lake have been chosen as the filming location for various recent popular feature films, and this, together with the increasing presence of celebrities who have bought lakeside properties, has heightened the city's international profile and given a further boost to international tourism.|$|R
50|$|Since 1921, Vaughan {{was a guest}} {{lecturer}} at the University of Michigan. In 1939, Rockefeller Foundation committee concluded that the nation had a shortage of well trained health personnel and should establish schools to train these professions. The University of Michigan responded quickly and agreed to create a school dedicated for that purpose. With the great depression, the University of Michigan Public Health School {{was made possible by}} the contribution of a half a million dollar each from the Rockefeller Foundation and the W.K. Kellog Foundation in 1941. The University of Michigan asked Vaughan to come back permanently in July 18, 1941 to be appointed as the first Dean of the Public Health School at the University of Michigan and create the public school from the Division of Hygiene and Public Health. With lack of resources and instructors, the opening of The School of Public Health offered only three departments: Public Health Practice, Epidemiology, and Environmental Health which included public <b>health</b> engineering and <b>industrial</b> <b>health.</b> With Vaughan’s expertise in environmental health, the School of Public Health was able to create an enriching curriculum that included 20 courses and a well established environmental health program. Tropical Disease was later added as the fourth department in 1943 because of the US involvement in World War II. By the end of 1949, there were a total of 15 departments. Vaughn emphasized public health research and developed virology and parasitic diseases, tropical disease, <b>industrial</b> <b>health,</b> and public health engineering laboratories. These laboratories were supported by the Foundation for Infantile Paralysis, Inc., the United States Public <b>Health</b> <b>Service</b> and other organizations. Among the breakthroughs in disease control during his deanship, the public health school contributed through the development of the first influenza vaccine by Dr. Thomas Francis Jr. and the polio vaccine by Dr. Jonas Salk in 1954. Vaughan was heavily involved with the construction of the Public Health Building. He was also able to attain Nathan Sinai, Thomas Francis, and Kenneth Easlick as faculties who are highly regarded in the field of public health to establish a real competence in <b>health</b> <b>services</b> organization and epidemiology. By the end of retirement in 1960, Vaughan created a school that is the largest program in environmental and <b>industrial</b> <b>health</b> in any academic institution in the country and whose graduates were highly sought out for positions in public health leadership worldwide.|$|R
