5|$|The engine used {{a single}} updraft carburetor; early {{versions}} used a Stromberg unit, which {{was replaced by}} a Schebler unit. The carburetor was {{on the right side of}} the engine, the mixture went into a passage through the engine block to the <b>intake</b> <b>manifold</b> on the left side of the engine. Ignition was by Delco coil and breaker points, with the distributor at the end of the generator/starter unit.|$|E
5|$|The E Series 3 was {{announced}} in September 2010. It carried the same motor and drivetrain as before, and only {{minor changes to the}} exterior. In this series HSV focused on changes to the interior of the car as well as major upgrades to the computer systems and a new electronic interface called the HSV Enhanced Driver Interface. External changes included the shock wave exhaust tips and grilles and new HID Xenon adaptive projector headlamps. The control panel changes included a new 'Oracle Dash' with upgraded trip computer, tire pressure monitors and fuel statistics; the center console was reworked, introducing the Holden touchscreen IQ system and the HSV EDI performance data logging system (similar to the Nissan GT-R), which displays real-time information on engine speed, brakes, gear shifts, g-forces on the car, steering angle, fuel economy, stability control, Magnetic Ride Control suspension, car dynamics, Bi-Modal Exhaust, battery voltage, oil pressure, power, torque, elevation, exhaust pressure, <b>intake</b> <b>manifold</b> pressure and air intake temp. The system includes preloaded race track locations, stop watches and track maps, satellite navigation, digital radio, Bluetooth, optional DVD player and ability to download data onto a PC using the Motech i2 software. The E Series 3 introduced (SBZA) Side Blind Zone Alert which uses ultrasonic sensors to alert drivers of traffic obstructions in blind spots. Using the HSV EDI the driver can customize operation of the car by for example turning off stability control and controlling the Bi-Modal Exhaust. The E Series 3 offered the option of HSV LPI (Liquid Propane Injection), an LPG Autogas system which allows the use of liquid propane as an alternative fuel. The LPI is controlled by the car's ECU and seamlessly changes from petrol to LPG when the engine has reached optimum temperature (when maximum engine power is required, the system automatically switches back to petrol).|$|E
25|$|Nitrous oxide {{is stored}} as a {{compressed}} liquid; the evaporation {{and expansion of}} liquid nitrous oxide in the <b>intake</b> <b>manifold</b> causes a large drop in intake charge temperature, resulting in a denser charge, further allowing more air/fuel mixture to enter the cylinder. Sometimes nitrous oxide is injected into (or prior to) the <b>intake</b> <b>manifold,</b> whereas other systems directly inject, right before the cylinder (direct port injection) to increase power.|$|E

25|$|Modern EMSs read in {{data from}} various sensors about the {{crankshaft}} position, <b>intake</b> <b>manifold</b> temperature, <b>intake</b> <b>manifold</b> pressure (or intake air volume), throttle position, fuel mixture via the oxygen sensor, detonation via a knock sensor, and {{exhaust gas temperature}} sensors. The EMS then uses the collected data to precisely determine how much fuel to deliver and when and how far to advance the ignition timing. With electronic ignition systems, individual cylinders can have their own individual timing so that timing can be as aggressive as possible per cylinder without fuel detonation. As a result, sophisticated electronic ignition systems can be both more fuel efficient, and produce better performance over their counterparts.|$|E
25|$|To {{prevent this}} from happening, a valve is fitted between the {{turbocharger}} and inlet, which vents off the excess air pressure. These {{are known as}} an anti-surge, diverter, bypass, turbo-relief valve, blow-off valve (BOV), or dump valve. It is a pressure relief valve, and is normally operated by the vacuum from the <b>intake</b> <b>manifold.</b>|$|E
25|$|In {{automotive}} applications, 'boost' {{refers to}} the amount by which <b>intake</b> <b>manifold</b> pressure exceeds atmospheric pressure. This {{is representative of the}} extra air pressure that is achieved over what would be achieved without the forced induction. The level of boost may be shown on a pressure gauge, usually in bar, psi or possibly kPa.|$|E
50|$|These {{featured}} variable <b>intake</b> <b>manifolds</b> {{and were}} able to meet Euro 3 emissions standards. A facelift was launched in February 2003.|$|R

25|$|When {{gas prices}} soared in the 1970s, Edelbrock {{produced}} its Streetmaster line of <b>intake</b> <b>manifolds</b> that featured improved mileage, {{as well as}} performance.|$|R
25|$|The turbocharger's {{compressor}} draws {{in ambient}} air and compresses {{it before it}} enters into the <b>intake</b> <b>manifold</b> at increased pressure. This results in a greater mass of air entering the cylinders on each intake stroke. The power needed to spin the centrifugal compressor {{is derived from the}} kinetic energy of the engine's exhaust gases.|$|E
25|$|In {{petrol engine}} {{turbocharger}} applications, boost pressure {{is limited to}} keep the entire engine system, including the turbocharger, inside its thermal and mechanical design operating range. Over-boosting an engine frequently causes damage to the engine {{in a variety of}} ways including pre-ignition, overheating, and over-stressing the engine's internal hardware. For example, to avoid engine knocking (also known as detonation) and the related physical damage to the engine, the <b>intake</b> <b>manifold</b> pressure must not get too high, thus the pressure at the <b>intake</b> <b>manifold</b> of the engine must be controlled by some means. Opening the wastegate allows the excess energy destined for the turbine to bypass it and pass directly to the exhaust pipe, thus reducing boost pressure. The wastegate can be either controlled manually (frequently seen in aircraft) or by an actuator (in automotive applications, it is often controlled by the engine control unit).|$|E
25|$|The Cultus GTi was {{now much}} more powerful, {{reaching}} 115PS JIS (85kW) with {{updated version of}} the previous GTi engine: the G13B engine that had higher compression pistons (11.5:1 compression ratio), tubular exhaust headers, a tubular <b>intake</b> <b>manifold,</b> larger camshafts and a reprogrammed ECU. Some models of the Cultus GTi were also available with all-wheel drive.|$|E

5000|$|Fuel is {{vaporised}} when it {{is injected}} into the transfer ports, and the turbulence in the <b>intake</b> <b>manifolds</b> and the piston shape above the rings stratifies the fuel air mixture into the combustion chamber.|$|R
25|$|The {{first patent}} {{for this type}} of molding process was taken out in 1968, however it was rarely used until the 1980s. That is when the {{automotive}} industry took interest in it to develop <b>intake</b> <b>manifolds.</b>|$|R
25|$|Vic Edelbrock {{founded the}} {{corporation}} in 1938. When {{his desire to}} increase the performance of his 1932 Ford Roadster led him to design a new <b>intake</b> <b>manifold,</b> friends and fellow drivers soon wanted one as well. This transformed his repair garage into a parts manufacturing enterprise, making one-of-a-kind equipment for automobiles. In many ways, Vic Edelbrock helped to invent the automotive aftermarket parts industry.|$|E
25|$|As of 2010, the Chevrolet Aveo is sold {{with either}} a 1,399cc or 1,598cc 16V DOHC E-TEC II engine with VGIS {{variable}} length <b>intake</b> <b>manifold.</b> The 1.4 grades are MT Manual transmission or AT Automatic transmission 'Base', MT/AT 'LS' and AT 'LSX'. The 1.6 grades are AT only 'LT', 'LSX', 'LUX' and 'SS'. All models except the 1.6 LT are configured to use E20 fuel.|$|E
25|$|The {{resulting}} engine weighs {{less than}} the O-235 and incorporates a throttle body injector system with a tuned <b>intake</b> <b>manifold</b> and dual electronic ignition, or optionally a carburetor {{in place of the}} throttle body injector to save further cost and weight. The engine has a 2400-hour time between overhauls. Additional features include a lightweight 14 volt alternator, an optimized oil sump, a streamlined accessory housing, a lightweight starter and roller tappets.|$|E
5000|$|Carburetion: free, however most used Weber 48 IDA or Solex 40P11 dual downdraft. Some use of Weber IDF and DCNF. (Note: two dual {{down draft}} carbs allowed, any {{manufacturer}} with dual port VW or aftermarket <b>intake</b> <b>manifolds).</b>|$|R
2500|$|American Motors {{supported}} the AMX and Javelin muscle-models {{with a range}} of factory-approved [...] "Group 19" [...] dealer-installed performance accessories. These included among others, dual four-barrel cross-ram <b>intake</b> <b>manifolds,</b> high-performance camshaft kits, needle-bearing roller rocker arms, and dual-point ignition.|$|R
50|$|A {{year later}} 1.8 and 2.0 Twin Spark engines {{received}} the updates first introduced on the Alfa Romeo 156; thanks to variable length <b>intake</b> <b>manifolds</b> the two powertrains gained 4-5 PS and reached peak torque at engine speeds some 500 rpm lower.|$|R
25|$|Another {{critical}} {{turning point}} in the company's history was the 1964 decision to build a small-block Chevy <b>intake</b> <b>manifold</b> for a 4-barrel carburetor. The C-4B manifold, developed with help from Bob Joehnck, opened the door to a new line of performance products. Although competing with the factory was a risky proposition, {{it turned out to be}} a beneficial one, as it allowed the company to expand into a new market.|$|E
25|$|The 351 Cleveland was {{no longer}} {{produced}} after 1974. The new 351M (Modified) joined the line-up, although the 351W continued to be used alongside when the 351-2V was specified. The 351M used the 400's tall deck block, and shared its connecting rods and <b>intake</b> <b>manifold,</b> so more parts were shared than between the 400 and 351C saving Ford production costs. The 351M and 351W had no appreciable power output difference; due to emissions standards, the 351M was not available in California.|$|E
25|$|Most modern road use {{diesel engines}} are {{provided}} with an FRP valve in the <b>intake</b> <b>manifold</b> (usually mistaken {{by some as a}} petrol engine throttle body). In most basic applications this valve will close a flow of air mixture to the engine when the vehicle is switched off, preventing diesel engine runaway by starving the engine of oxygen; this will also make standard shutdown much smoother by eliminating compression and decompression rattle by making the pistons effectively work in vacuum. In more advanced control systems this FRP valve can be shut by an electronic control unit when it senses runaway scenario.|$|E
50|$|In this {{original}} era, Stock Eliminator (established 1955) and Super Stock Eliminator (established 1957) {{race cars}} {{were limited to}} design specifications as factory produced, including maximum engine sizes and other restrictions on cylinder heads, <b>intake</b> <b>manifolds,</b> camshaft and valve train components and wheels/tires.|$|R

25|$|The 4.0-litre inline six-cylinder {{engine was}} {{upgraded}} to aid refinement and increase power to 157kilowatts (211hp) this included {{the removal of}} the distributor as it was replaced with a coil-pack ignition system which was a first for the Falcon. Also the <b>intake</b> <b>manifold</b> was changed to include a dual length system which involved intake runners of two different lengths and a valve to switch between the two. Changes were also made to the suspension with the aim of providing a more supple ride, but drew criticism for producing nervous handling and an unsettling feeling of roll oversteer (a problem not corrected until the EL facelift).|$|E
25|$|Vista V50 is {{significant}} because it's {{one of the first}} fruits of Toyota's company-wide platform renewal efforts known as the MC. Studies for new front-wheel drive (FWD) platform and packaging layout began in 1993 and appeared on market in February 1997 in the Toyota Prius, but the Vista is the first mass-production, FWD Toyota with a new platform. Toyota claims this is the first true redesign and re-think of its FWD platforms since the 1982 Camry/Vista. With this platform, Toyota trades rear MacPherson Struts for a torsion beam axle setup. A double-wishbone setup is available for all-wheel drive. Toyota also flipped the engine orientation so that the <b>intake</b> <b>manifold</b> is in front, improving space efficiency.|$|E
25|$|In 2008 Aston {{introduced}} an aftermarket dealer approved upgrade path {{for power and}} handling of the 4.3-litre variants that maintained the warranty with Aston. The power upgrade was The V8 Vantage Power Upgrade, creating a more potent version of the Aston Martin 4.3-litre engine {{with an increase in}} Peak power of 20bhp to 400bhp while peak torque is increased by 10Nm to 420Nm. This consists of the fitting of the following revised components; manifold assembly (painted Crackle Black), valved air box, right and left hand side vacuum hose assemblies, engine bay fuse box link lead (ECU to fuse box), throttle body to manifold gasket, <b>intake</b> <b>manifold</b> gasket, fuel injector to manifold seal, and a manifold badge.|$|E
