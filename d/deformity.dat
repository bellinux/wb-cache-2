5|$|During childhood, Goebbels {{suffered}} from ill health, {{which included a}} long bout of inflammation of the lungs. He had a deformed right foot that turned inwards, due to a congenital <b>deformity.</b> It was thicker and shorter than his left foot. He underwent a failed operation to correct it just prior to starting grammar school. Goebbels wore a metal brace and special shoe because of his shortened leg, and walked with a limp. He was rejected for military service in World War I due to his <b>deformity.</b>|$|E

In 2014, the osteoarchaeologist Dr Jo Appleby, of Leicester University's School of Archaeology and Ancient History, imaged {{the spinal}} column and reconstructed a model using 3D printing, {{and concluded that}} though the spinal scoliosis looked dramatic, it probably did not cause any major physical <b>deformity</b> {{that could not be}} disguised by clothing.|$|E
40|$|Congenital {{chest wall}} <b>deformities</b> are {{considered}} to be anomalies in chest wall growth. These can be categorized as either rib cage overgrowth or <b>deformities</b> related to inadequate growth (aplasia or dysplasia). Rib cage overgrowth leads to depression of the sternum (pectus excavatum) or protuberance of the sternum (pectus carinatum) and accounts for greater than 90 % of congenital chest wall <b>deformities.</b> The remaining <b>deformities</b> are a result of inadequate growth. Evolution in the management of congenital chest wall <b>deformities</b> has made significant progress over the past 25 years.

40|$|Ontogenesis, {{transfer}} and repair of larval chironomid <b>deformities</b> during moulting are described {{for the first}} time. Third instar Chironomus riparius larvae from a contaminated stream were individually reared to fourth instar in the laboratory. Mentum and mandible <b>deformities</b> present in the third instar exuvial head capsule were then compared with <b>deformities</b> in the fourth instar larva. Instar IV larvae displayed higher deformation frequencies than instar III larvae. The majority of the <b>deformities</b> in instar III were identically passed on during moulting. Partial and complete repair occurred to some extent, indicating that chironomid mouthpart deformation can be reversible. The frequency of deformed instar III larvae gaining additional <b>deformities</b> after moulting, was equal to the frequency of normal larvae with <b>deformities</b> after moulting. This shows {{that the presence of}} <b>deformities</b> does not increase the susceptibility for the formation of new <b>deformities.</b> The effects of physical tooth damage on the formation of mouthpart <b>deformities</b> was also investigated, but no relationship was found between tooth breakage/abrasion and deformation. The difference in deformation frequency between instar III and IV larvae once again stresses the importance of separate screening of different instars for biomonitoring and toxicity testing purposes. status: publishe...|$|R
5|$|Injuries to the {{external}} ear occur fairly frequently, and can leave minor to major <b>deformity.</b> Injuries include: laceration, avulsion injuries, burn and repeated twisting or pulling of an ear, for discipline or torture. Chronic damage to the ears can cause cauliflower ear, a common condition in boxers and wrestlers in which the cartilage around the ears becomes lumpy and distorted owing to persistence of a haematoma around the perichondrium, which can impair blood supply and healing. Owing to its exposed position, {{the external}} ear is susceptible to frostbite as well as skin cancers, including squamous-cell carcinoma and basal-cell carcinomas.|$|E
5|$|Without treatment, {{episodes of}} acute gout may develop into chronic gout with {{destruction}} of joint surfaces, joint <b>deformity</b> and painless tophi. These tophi occur in 30% {{of those who}} are untreated for five years, often in the helix of the ear, over the olecranon processes, or on the Achilles tendons. With aggressive treatment, they may dissolve. Kidney stones also frequently complicate gout, affecting between 10 and 40% of people and occur due to low urine pH promoting the precipitation of uric acid. Other forms of chronic kidney dysfunction may occur.|$|E
5|$|After the {{supporters}} of Henry III of England suppressed opposition from the English nobility in the Second Barons' War, Henry granted to his second son Edmund Crouchback the titles and possessions forfeited by attainder of the barons' leader, Simon de Montfort, 6th Earl of Leicester, including the Earldom of Leicester, on 26 October 1265. Later grants included the first Earldom of Lancaster on 30 June 1267 and that of Earl Ferrers in 1301. Edmund was also Count of Champagne and Brie from 1276 by right of his wife. Henry IV of England would later use his descent from Edmund to legitimise his claim to the throne, even making the spurious claim that Edmund was the elder son of Henry but had been passed over as king because of his <b>deformity.</b>|$|E

40|$|The aim of {{the present}} study was to improve the cause-effect {{relationship}} between toxicant exposure and chironomid mouthpart <b>deformities,</b> by linking induction of mouthpart <b>deformities</b> to contaminated field sediments, metal mixtures and a mutagenic polycyclic aromatic compound metabolite (acridone). Mouthpart <b>deformities</b> in Chironomus riparius larvae were induced by both the heavy metal mixture and by acridone. A clear correlation between metal concentrations in the sediment and <b>deformities</b> incidence was only observed when the contaminated field sediments were left out of the analysis, probably because these natural sediments contained other toxic compounds, which could be responsible for a higher incidence of <b>deformities</b> than predicted by the measured metal concentrations only. The present study clearly improved the cause-effect relationship between toxicant exposure and the induction of mouthpart <b>deformities.</b> It is concluded that the incidence of mouthpart <b>deformities</b> may better reflect the potential toxicity of contaminated sediments than chemical analysis...|$|R

5|$|Edmund Crouchback (1245–1296), who {{was granted}} the titles and estates of Simon de Montfort, 6th Earl of Leicester and the earldom of Leicester after Henry {{defeated}} Montfort in the Second Barons' War. Henry later granted Edmund the earldoms of Lancaster and Ferrers. From 1276, through his wife, Edmund was Count of Champagne and Brie. Later Lancastrians {{would attempt to}} use Henry IV's maternal descent from Edmund to legitimise his claim to the throne, spuriously claiming that Edmund was the eldest son of Henry III but had not become king due to <b>deformity.</b> Through his second marriage to Blanche, the widow of Henry I of Navarre, Edmund was at the centre of European aristocracy. Blanche's daughter, Joan, was queen regnant of Navarre and queen consort of France through her marriage to Philip IV. Edmund's son Thomas became the most powerful nobleman in England, adding to his inheritance the earldoms of Lincoln and Salisbury through his marriage to the heiress of Henry de Lacy, 3rd Earl of Lincoln.|$|E
5|$|Henry went to {{convoluted}} legal {{means to}} justify his succession. Many Lancastrians asserted {{that his mother had}} had legitimate rights through her descent from Edmund Crouchback, who it was claimed was the elder son of Henry III of England, set aside due to <b>deformity.</b> As the great-grandson of Lionel of Antwerp, 1st Duke of Clarence, Edmund Mortimer, Earl of March, was the heir presumptive to Richard II and Henry used multiple rationales stressing his Plantagenet descent, divine grace, powerful friends, and Richard's misgovernment. In fact Mortimer never showed interest in the throne. The later marriage of his sister Anne to Richard of Conisburgh, 3rd Earl of Cambridge consolidated this claim to the throne with that of the more junior House of York. Henry planned to resume war with France, but was plagued with financial problems, declining health and frequent rebellions. He defeated a Scottish invasion, a serious rebellion by Henry Percy, 1st Earl of Northumberland in the North and Owain Glyndŵr's rebellion in Wales. Many saw it as a punishment from God when Henry was later struck down with unknown but chronic illnesses.|$|E
40|$|Abstract: Tilapia (Oreochromis spp.) were {{collected}} seasonally from four contaminated rivers in southwestern Taiwan for studies of morphological <b>deformities</b> {{that could be}} used as biomarkers of contamination. Morphological <b>deformities</b> found in tilapia were separated into 15 categories. Overall, the prevalence of <b>deformities</b> such as split fins, lower lip extension and gill <b>deformities</b> were significantly related to various water quality parameters, including low DO and high ammonium, lead and zinc concentrations. The persistence of tilapia in polluted waters {{and the development of a}} suite of morphological <b>deformities</b> suggest that tilapia can be used as sentinels of non-point source pollution in rivers...|$|R

5|$|In {{addition}} to these literary sources, various film scholars have suggested that Méliès was heavily influenced by other works, especially Jacques Offenbach's operetta Le voyage dans la lune (an unauthorized parody of Verne's novels) and the A Trip to the Moon attraction at the 1901 Pan-American Exposition in Buffalo, New York. The French film historian Thierry Lefebvre hypothesizes that Méliès drew upon both of these works, but in different ways: {{he appears to have}} taken the structure of the film—"a trip to the moon, a moon landing, an encounter with extraterrestrials with a <b>deformity,</b> an underground trek, an interview with the Man in the Moon, and a brutal return to reality back on earth"—directly from the 1901 attraction, but also incorporated many plot elements (including the presence of six astronomers with pseudo-scientific names, telescopes that transform into stools, a moonshot cannon mounted above ground, a scene in which the moon appears to approach the viewer, a lunar snowstorm, an earthrise scene, and umbrella-wielding travelers), not to mention the parodic tone of the film, from the Offenbach operetta.|$|E
5|$|Some {{clinical}} {{symptoms and}} signs {{have been named}} after Hippocrates as he {{is believed to be}} the first person to describe those. Hippocratic face is the change produced in the countenance by death, or long sickness, excessive evacuations, excessive hunger, and the like. Clubbing, a <b>deformity</b> of the fingers and fingernails, is also known as Hippocratic fingers. Hippocratic succussion is the internal splashing noise of hydropneumothorax or pyopneumothorax. Hippocratic bench (a device which uses tension to aid in setting bones) and Hippocratic cap-shaped bandage are two devices named after Hippocrates. Hippocratic Corpus and Hippocratic Oath are also his namesakes. The drink hypocras is also believed to be invented by Hippocrates. Risus sardonicus, a sustained spasming of the face muscles may also be termed the Hippocratic Smile.|$|E
5|$|Ever since Joseph Merrick's days as {{a novelty}} exhibit on Whitechapel Road, his {{condition}} {{has been a source}} of curiosity for medical professionals. His appearance at the meeting of the Pathological Society of London in 1884 drew interest from the doctors present, but none of the answers nor the attention that Treves had hoped for. The case received only a brief mention in the British Medical Journal, and the Lancet declined to mention it at all. Four months later, in 1885, Treves brought the case before the meeting for a second time. By then, Tom Norman's shop on Whitechapel Road had been closed, and the Elephant Man had moved on. Without Merrick, Treves made do with the photographs he had taken during his examinations. One of the doctors present at the meeting was Henry Radcliffe Crocker, a dermatologist who was an authority on skin diseases. After hearing Treves's description of Merrick, and viewing the photographs, Crocker proposed that Merrick's condition might be a combination of dermatolysis, pachydermatocele and an unnamed bone <b>deformity,</b> all caused by changes in the nervous system. Crocker wrote about Merrick's case in his 1888 book Diseases of the Skin: their Description, Pathology, Diagnosis and Treatment.|$|E
40|$|This is a {{study of}} {{vertebral}} <b>deformities</b> in ornamental koi based on computed radiography and skeletons cleaned by dermestid beetles (Dermestes maculatus). All koi developed gradual onset of swimming abnormalities as adults. Extensive intervertebral osteophyte formation correlated with age of fish and was associated with hindquarter paresis in one koi. Vertebral compression and fusion were the most common spinal <b>deformities</b> occurring at multiple sites, similar to findings in other farmed fish. Site-specific spinal <b>deformities</b> were thought to develop {{due to differences in}} swimming behaviour and rates of vertebral growth. One koi had offspring with spinal <b>deformities.</b> Spinal <b>deformities</b> are significant problems in both European and Australian food fish hatcheries.
