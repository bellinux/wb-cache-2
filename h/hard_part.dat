The <b>hard</b> <b>part</b> is manipulating the story and accenting the characters. In the beginning, when Todd is laying down the rules, there's a certain repetitive thematic idea you hear. You hear the same music when Dussander is turning the tables on Todd, which makes you remember the first scene... You hope people are subliminally making the connection that the tables are turning back and forth.|$|E
5|$|In {{the case}} of '4 Minutes', Tim had a vision from the {{beginning}} of how things should go, especially sonically... When I opened up the session of '4 Minutes', there was so much going on that I knew right away that the <b>hard</b> <b>part</b> would be {{to make sure that the}} vocals would cut through and were right in the pocket. Beginning with working on the vocals was the only way to achieve this. After that I formed all the other parts around the vocals. The other challenge was to make sure that everything in the track sounded clear and that you could hear every instrument, every syllable, every breath. Also, I do almost always work linear in time on a track. It's easier, because when you're done, you're done. So I keep working on section after section, until I get to the end of the track and then I know the whole mix is pretty close.|$|E

In film terms, that means Berry performed for 21 minutes straight with no breaks, not an easy feat for any actor." [...] Though she enjoyed working with Chestnut, Berry told Grant that it was difficult being unable to see her co-stars for most of the film: [...] "That was my constant challenge; to stay on such an emotional level , so that I would be on the same level as they [...] were.

The hard X-ray data remain intriguing more than ten years later: the Cat's Eye was included in a 2012 Chandra survey of 21 central stars of planetary nebulae (CSPNe) in the solar neighborhood, which found: [...] "All but one of the X-ray point sources detected at CSPNe display X-ray spectra that are harder than expected from hot (~) central star photospheres, possibly indicating a high frequency of binary companions to CSPNe. Other potential explanations include self-shocking winds or PN mass fallback." ...|$|E
500|$|Upon release, Don was {{generally}} well received by critics. Mayank Shekhar from Mumbai Mirror gave the film {{a rating of}} 4 out of 5 and wrote, [...] "The former was a character-driven, intimate film, albeit a fairly slick thriller, mostly for its screenplay. The latter is a most updated Indian film of the action genre that always calculably concentrates on the new twists, and the turning points, both of which mostly seem cleverer than contrived; ably fitting pieces, the known characters, into a new domino." [...] Raja Sen of Rediff.com gave a mixed review, saying that the film was [...] "conventional and predictable", and complained that the director did not develop his characters. However, Sen was impressed by Chopra's performance, calling it [...] "film's biggest surprise", and wrote, [...] "Stepping into Zeenat Aman's shoes is a tough task, but she doesn't really waste time pretending to be the stunner's successor. Chopra handles her role with efficiency, looking every bit the competent woman of actionand a ravishing babe who fills out a skintight white jumpsuit deliciously. Roma is a <b>hard</b> <b>part</b> to play, but Priyanka has a no-nonsense air about her throughout the film. This is an actress willing to push herself, and has definite potential for screen magic.

2500|$|Couscous was {{traditionally}} {{made from}} the <b>hard</b> <b>part</b> of the durum, {{the part of the}} grain that resisted the grinding of the millstone. The semolina is sprinkled with water and rolled with the hands to form small pellets, sprinkled with dry flour to keep them separate, and then sieved. Any pellets that are too small to be finished granules of couscous fall through the sieve and are again rolled and sprinkled with dry semolina and rolled into pellets. This labor-intensive process continues until all the semolina has been formed into tiny granules of couscous. [...] In the traditional method of preparing couscous, groups of women came together to make large batches over several days, which were then dried in the sun and used for several months.
