This information was then analyzed and factored into giving the company an accurate valuation from the subjective and objective facts that were accumulated.

40|$|In {{this paper}} {{we will be}} {{studying}} and backtesting a particular investment strategy by buying and holding dividend stocks. We think <b>dividend</b> <b>stock</b> is an important type of investment to investors and portfolio managers because of its cash implications, especially in a high volatility equity market. Furthermore, we think that consistency in a company’s ability and willingness in distributing dividends to its shareholders is a strong indicator of its financial strength and operational success. How portfolio managers should pick the best performing dividend stocks would then become an important issue. In this paper, we will be testing the historical performance of a portfolio of dividend stocks that we construct and adjust based {{on a list of}} parameters associated with companies’ operational performance, cash position, and dividend yield. Hence, the main way we select stocks in the portfolio is based on fundamental analysis. Our research is conducted relying exclusively on the Wharton Research Data Services database (WRDS). In addition to evaluating the investment attractiveness of our portfolio, the strategy may also have implications regarding several other topics including the semi-strong form market efficiency and active portfolio management. Therefore, this paper covers also potential benefits to be gained from the strategy other than its investment payoff...|$|E
50|$|Cash {{dividends}} {{are good}} for {{people that want to}} liquidate their money from the market and not reinvest their dividends. However, cash dividends are not the only type of dividend. The main type of dividend referring to common stocks is called a <b>stock</b> <b>dividend.</b> Unlike cash <b>dividends,</b> <b>stock</b> <b>dividends</b> do not involve the distribution of cash to the common stock owners. Instead, a <b>stock</b> <b>dividend</b> distributes additional <b>stock</b> of the company to the owners of the company (people that own stocks of the company). <b>Stock</b> <b>dividends</b> have equity. They are even dispersed to the people who own stock depending on their portion of ownership in a corporation. If a corporation is declared a 20% <b>stock</b> <b>dividend</b> then this means the corporation will give out 2 shares for every 10 shares to the shareholders.

By sampling on the companies listed in Taiwan that grant dividends every year between 2005 and 2014, Event Study methodology is conducted to explore on how ex-right and ex-dividend dates correlate to abnormal stock return and risk. Abnormal stock return with ex-right and ex-dividend date factors is not significant in 10 years sampling period, however, there are six (6) years of annual returns with significantly positive abnormal returns. Abnormal risk is not significantly correlated to ex-right and ex-dividend date factors, however, most of the results shows negative correlation, which indicates that ex-dividend and ex-right stocks has less risk than stock market index. Abnormal return is significantly negative correlated to abnormal risk during ex-right and ex-dividend period.

40|$|The thesis {{examines}} the dividend puzzle {{in the context}} of the Chinese capital market and further investigates the factors that significantly affect dividend policy in Chinese listed firms. In Chapter two, we examine the announcement effects of dividends in the Chinese capital market, with an emphasis on <b>stock</b> <b>dividends.</b> We begin by separately investigating the cumulative abnormal returns around the announcements of cash, <b>stock</b> and combined <b>dividends.</b> Because earnings are announced concurrently with dividend decisions in China, and therefore the estimated abnormal returns could be confounded by the earnings effect, we attempt to examine the dividend announcement effect under different earnings signals. We find a strong announcement effect of <b>stock</b> <b>dividends</b> even after controlling for concurrent earnings surprises. In contrast, pure cash <b>dividend</b> <b>stocks</b> experience no significant price run-up around the announcements. In addition, we examine the difference in market reactions to a positive or negative earnings announcement as firms initiate, maintain or switch to different forms of payouts.

50|$|The {{ability for}} a {{corporation}} to offer or not offer common <b>stock</b> <b>dividends</b> is an indicator {{on whether or}} not a company is healthy. If a certain company is constantly paying out common <b>stock</b> <b>dividends</b> year after year and the dividends rise steadily, this means that the company is most likely doing very well and is profitable because they have the extra money to distribute to their shareholders every time it is time to pay the dividends they owe.

This is most likely an indicator that the company cannot afford to offer the common <b>stock</b> <b>dividend</b> to the <b>stock</b> holders anymore because the company would not be profitable if they do. Usually companies that are not making a profit, or are not making a profit, tend to cut their common <b>stock</b> <b>dividends</b> in order to save money for the company.
