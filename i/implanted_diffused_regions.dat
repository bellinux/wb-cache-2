40|$|Understanding {{the effects}} of dust {{extinction}} is important to properly interpret observations. The optical total-to-selective extinction ratio, Rv = Av/E(B-V), is widely used to describe extinction variations in ultraviolet and optical bands. Since the Rv= 3. 1 extinction curve adequately represents the average extinction law of <b>diffuse</b> <b>regions</b> in the Milky Way, {{it is commonly used}} to correct observational measurements along sightlines toward <b>diffuse</b> <b>regions</b> in the interstellar medium. However, the Rv value may vary even along different diffuse interstellar medium sightlines. In this paper, we investigate the optical [...] mid-infrared (mid-IR) extinction law toward a very <b>diffuse</b> <b>region</b> at l = 165 in the Galactic plane, which was selected based on a CO emission map. Adopting red clump stars as extinction tracers, we determine the optical-to-mid-IR extinction law for our <b>diffuse</b> <b>region</b> in the two APASS bands (B, V), the three XSTPS-GAC bands (g, r, i), the three 2 MASS bands (J, H, Ks, and the two WISE bands (W 1, W 2). Specifically, 18 red clump stars were selected from the APOGEE [...] RC catalog based on spectroscopic data in order to explore the diversity of the extinction law. We find that the optical extinction curves exhibit appreciable diversity. The corresponding Rv ranges from 1. 7 to 3. 8, while the mean Rv value of 2. 8 is consistent with the widely adopted average value of 3. 1 for Galactic diffuse clouds. There is no apparent correlation between Rv value and color excess E(B-V) in the range of interest, from 0. 2 to 0. 6 mag, or with specific visual extinction per kiloparsec, AV/d.

40|$|Abstractâ€”An enhanced, region-aided, {{geometric}} active contour that is {{more tolerant}} toward weak edges and noise in images is introduced. The proposed method integrates gradient flow forces with region constraints, composed of image region vector flow forces obtained through the diffusion of the region segmentation map. We refer to this as the Region-aided Geometric Snake or RAGS. The <b>diffused</b> <b>region</b> forces can be generated from any reliable region segmentation technique, greylevel or color. This extra region force gives the snake a global complementary view of the boundary information within the image which, along with the local gradient flow, helps detect fuzzy boundaries and overcome noisy regions. The partial differential equation (PDE) resulting from this integration of image gradient flow and <b>diffused</b> <b>region</b> flow is implemented using a level set approach. We present various examples and also evaluate and compare the performance of RAGS on weak boundaries and noisy images.

The thin films were deposited by radio frequency magnetron sputtering at 300 Â°C on gold-coated silicon substrates, which used a 15 nm titanium adhesion layer between the 150 nm thick gold film and (100) silicon. The TEM analysis was carried out {{using a combination of}} high-resolution imaging, energy filtered imaging, energy dispersive X-ray (EDX) analysis, and hollow cone illumination. At the interface between the PSZT films and gold, an amorphous silicon-rich layer (about 4 nm thick) was observed, with the film composition remaining uniform otherwise. The films were found to be polycrystalline with a columnar structure perpendicular to the substrate. Interdiffusion between the bottom metal layers and silicon was observed and was confirmed using secondary ion mass spectrometry.

The galaxy was detected by Arecibo Legacy Fast ALFA survey (ALFALFA), and its mass is dominated by neutral hydrogen (HI) gas. In contrast, both the stellar masses of the bright HII and <b>diffuse</b> stellar <b>regions</b> are small. In addition, the fit to the spectral energy distribution to each region shows the stellar populations of HII and <b>diffuse</b> <b>regions</b> are different. The bright HII region contains a large fraction of O-type stars, revealing the recent strong star formation, whereas the <b>diffuse</b> <b>region</b> is dominated by median age stars, which has a typical age of âˆ¼ 600 Myrs. Using the McGaugh's abundance model, {{we found that the}} average metallicity of KKR 17 is 12 + (O/H) = 8. 0 Â± 0. 1.

The emission spectrum measured by Planck and IRAS can be fitted pixel by pixel using a single modified blackbody. Some systematic residuals are detected at 353 GHz and 143 GHz, with amplitudes around - 7 % and + 13 %, respectively, indicating that the measured spectra are likely more complex than a simple modified blackbody. Significant positive residuals are also detected in the molecular regions and in the 217 GHz and 100 GHz bands, mainly caused by {{the contribution of the}} J = 2 -> 1 and J = 1 -> 0 (CO) -C- 12 and (CO) -C- 13 emission lines.
