40|$|<b>Environmental</b> {{management}} <b>officers</b> – {{leadership and}} employeeship in local environmental health authority The {{purpose of this}} study was to illustrate the working situation of municipal <b>environmental</b> health management <b>officers.</b> This is a qualitative study where I have interviewed ten <b>environmental</b> <b>officers</b> in ten municipalities in Sweden. The interviews were based on a half structured interview guide with questions. I have interpreted the interviews through different leadership theories. The role of the management officers is divided into many roles. The management officers have many possibilities to get more education in leadership for example they can join a network for <b>environmental</b> management <b>officers</b> or participate in different courses that employer pay. Ten different styles of leadership were found in this study: the manager with focus on administration systems, the Jack-of-all-trades-manager, the coach, the administrative official, the parent-manager, the working too much manager, the manager that get “helicoptered” by higher management, the pragmatic manager, the find out manager and the manager as manager. The employee situation is sometimes turbulent and employee turnover is extensive. The efficiency is low when a lot of time is necessary to continually educate new staff all time. The turnover and lack of development for an <b>environmental</b> health <b>officer</b> is costly because the resulting efficiency is lower than necessary. Working as an <b>environmental</b> health <b>officer</b> is an occupation with external and internal conflicts. More research is needed to develop the area of municipal environmental health in many ways...|$|R

40|$|There’s been {{a general}} ban {{on use of}} mercury in Sweden since 2009 but it’s still {{estimated}} that the Swedish population have between 40 – 60 tons of amalgam in their teeth. Dental amalgam contains about 50 % mercury and {{studies have shown that}} despite the installation of amalgam separators mercury emissions from dental clinics still occur. <b>Environmental</b> <b>officers</b> in Swedish municipalities are important in the work to reduce mercury emissions from dental clinics in Sweden. The purpose of this report was to investigate how Swedish municipalities carry out supervision of mercury management in dental clinics as well as to investigate the legislative demands on the mercury management in dental clinics. The purpose was also to investigate possible similarities and differences between municipalities with varying populations. <b>Environmental</b> <b>officers</b> in Swedish municipalities answered a web survey. The results show that the knowledge about mercury management in dental clinics is greater among <b>environmental</b> <b>officers</b> in larger municipalities compared to smaller municipalities. Some of the smaller municipalities don’t carry out any inspections of dental clinics whereas every larger municipality does. Larger municipalities have higher demands on mercury management in dental clinics than smaller municipalities. The legislations used are broadly the same among the municipalities but because the demands made by the municipalities differ, it indicates that the interpretation of the legislations vary between municipalities in Sweden. Collaborations between different municipalities, more distinct guidelines and guidance are probably necessary to achieve a consensus amongst the municipalities when it comes to mercury management in dental clinics...|$|R

40|$|This {{qualitative}} study aimed {{to describe how}} <b>environmental</b> health <b>officers</b> prioritized different components of food regulation enforcement {{within the context of}} their overall workload, to gather information about how to better prepare <b>environmental</b> health <b>officers</b> for the demands of their role. A significant change in the role of <b>environmental</b> health <b>officers</b> is occurring due to new legislative requirements related to food labelling. In 2003, the Australia and New Zealand Food Regulation Ministerial Council (the Ministerial Council) developed a Policy Guideline on Nutrition, Health and Related Claims (the Policy Guideline), providing a framework for the regulation of nutrition, health and related claims. <b>Environmental</b> health <b>officers</b> are likely to be responsible for the enforcement of these proposed new regulations. The proposed monitoring role is as yet untested and the factors influencing the environmental health officers’ decisions about prioritization of work load are unknown. The priority given to the enforcement of such regulations may impact on how effectively <b>environmental</b> health <b>officers</b> perform this aspect of their work load. The data used in this study were obtained through semi-structured interviews with 37 <b>environmental</b> health <b>officers</b> from three states, NSW, QLD and ACT. The sample included male and female officers at both field and senior level across local and state sites. The interview transcripts were analyzed by thematic coding {{with the aid of a}} qualitative software analysis package. The work and control scales survey data were analyzed using SPSS 15. Results showed that field officers considered themselves to be protectors of the community’s health, closely interacting with the community and responding to their demands and complaints. Field officers’ routine inspections and investigation of food poisoning and hygiene complaints were given highest priority, while monitoring health claims on food labels was given low priority. Conversely, senior officers reported being more involved with management, interacting with outside organizations and politics, and assigned higher priority to the monitoring of health claims on food labels. The analysis of environmental health officers’ work practices and attitudes using the framework of Lipsky’s (1980) theory of street-level-bureaucracy was used to enhance present understanding of the implications for policy implementation at the interface between the public and government. This study extends existing knowledge about the motivations behind the work practice of <b>environmental</b> health <b>officers,</b> a poorly researched group, and explores their roles within Lipsky’s framework of street-level bureaucrats. The study thus extends Lipsky’s model into a new area of work practice. Contrary to previous studies indicating street-level bureaucrats use coping mechanisms to decrease frustration caused by work conditions, this study’s results revealed that the desire to create positive outcomes for the community drove the behaviour of <b>environmental</b> health <b>officers.</b> Further results from this study indicate that <b>environmental</b> health <b>officers,</b> through their work practices and especially in their enforcement role, have the capacity to optimize or lessen the benefits to consumers of food regulations such as nutrition and health related claims on food labels. Three major recommendations arise out of this study to ensure that consumers benefit from the new legislation regarding nutrition and health related claims on food labels. There should be provision of sufficient resources and timely training in new responsibilities for <b>environmental</b> health <b>officers.</b> Communication between State and local government authorities must continue to be improved and maintained, so that adequate support and appropriate guidance from team leaders is consistently available. Lastly, increased public education regarding the importance of nutrition, health and related claims as a tool to make healthier food purchases is needed...|$|R
