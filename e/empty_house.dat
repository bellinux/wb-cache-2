Eventually, after he accidentally shreds George's memoirs, the former President spanks Bart. An outraged Homer confronts George and both men vow to make trouble for each other.|$|E

5|$|Pictures of {{shooting}} the music video in Lyngby, Denmark were released on Aqua's Facebook page on 14 September 2011. A take {{of the video}} was also uploaded on their YouTube channel. The video was officially uploaded on YouTube on 22 September. Directed by Michael Sauer Christensen, it is set in an eerie, <b>empty</b> <b>house</b> that is reminiscent of a horror film, where a black cloud wanders through {{the halls of the}} house. The members wear black and gray clothing in the video, with Nystrom's costume gradually changing throughout. The video ends by the members exiting the house through the roof and transforming into a beam of light shooting into the sky. The video uses a shortened radio edit of the original song, omitting the bridge.|$|E

To no one's surprise The Brothers Karamazov, with Dullin, who finally arrived in New York in March 1918, {{in the role}} of Smerdiakov and later in his well-received role as Harpagon, the miser, counted among the successes. Nuit des rois also burnished the company's reputation. But some plays such as Octave Mirbeau's Les Mauvais Bergers ("The Evil Shepherds") ended with an almost <b>empty</b> <b>house</b> as the audience stalked to the exits during the play before the final curtain.|$|E

25|$|After the {{confrontation}} in March, the squatters gained significant advances. They established many new squats {{in the spring}} and summer of 1982. The squats were mostly located in Nørrebro, and unlike before, the police did not move in and evict the squatters right away. This allowed the squatters to establish collectives. The houses included such now-infamous sites as Allotria, Bazooka, Den Lille Fjer ("The Little Feather"), Garternergade 14 ("Gardener Street 14"), Snehvide ("Snow White"), Safari, and many more. Allotria in particular became a popular place for alternative music. In Bazooka, the squatters even set up a housing service with records of empty houses and flats in the area. Those in need of a place to live could come to Bazooka. They were shown an <b>empty</b> <b>house</b> and offered a crowbar with which to break down the door.|$|E
25|$|In 1983, a {{group of}} squatters moved in and took control of an <b>empty</b> <b>house</b> in Ryesgade 58. The squatters, many of them very experienced, moved in slowly and in small groups to avoid detection. The plan succeeded, and {{after a couple of}} months, they had {{established}} a well-organized squat. It was designed so that every floor was an independent collective charged with maintaining its part of the house. They improved the living conditions in the house, and Ryesgade 58 soon became the unofficial headquarters of the squatters movement. It was the center for political activities and was usually the place where foreign squatters lived when visiting Copenhagen. Soon after the squatting of Ryesgade 58, other new squats were established around Copenhagen. These squats included Kapaw in Østerbro, Baldersgade 20 ("Baldurs Street 20"), Bauhaus, and the infamous Sorte Hest ("Black Horse").|$|E
25|$|Petipa {{spent almost}} six months staging La Bayadère. During rehearsals, Petipa {{clashed with the}} Prima {{ballerina}} Vazem over the matter of her entrance in the ballet's final Grand pas d'action, while also experiencing many problems with the set designers who constructed the ballet's elaborate stage effects. Petipa was also worried that his new work would play to an <b>empty</b> <b>house,</b> as the Imperial Theatre's Director Baron Karl Kister increased the ticket prices {{to be higher than}} that of the Italian Opera, which at that time were expensive. The most celebrated and enduring passage of La Bayadère was Petipa's grand vision scene known as The Kingdom of the Shades. Petipa staged this scene as a Grand pas classique, completely devoid of any dramatic action. His simple and academic choreography was to become one of his most celebrated compositions, with the Sortie des bayadères of the thirty-two member Corps de ballet of shades arguably becoming his most celebrated composition of all.|$|E

Don works with new hire Michael Ginsberg and Ken Cosgrove on the pitch to Butler Footwear. Ginsberg goes rogue during the presentation and ends up pitching a commercial based on Cinderella, which the group had earlier rejected as being too cliche - although {{that was what the}} executives were expecting, and they reject the pitch they had earlier approved in favor of a Cinderella campaign.

[...] "Songs For Women" [...] is a song where Ocean can't decide whether to rue or revel in his conflicted feelings about women. The song offers a self-effacing perspective, with a numbed, restrained delivery. Lyrically the track expresses a narrative where he tries to arrange an after-school meeting in his dad's <b>empty</b> <b>house</b> and brags about harmonizing to Otis, Isley and Marvin. He laments that his woman doesn't listen to him or his music: [...] "It's like she never heard of me." [...] In spite of the [...] "suave delivery and the song's inherent tunefulness", the object of Ocean's affection soon ditches his love songs in favor of those sung [...] "by real R big-shots (Drake included)".|$|E
