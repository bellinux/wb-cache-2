40|$|Flowery field {{margins and}} <b>intersowing</b> of crops with flowers {{are used as}} {{management}} practices to promote arthropod biodiversity as well as biocontrol agents. Positive effects of enhancement (in abundance and species richness) of hymenopteran parasitoids on control of Lepidoptera pests have previously been demonstrated. However, effects on predatory arthropods, which may also serve as pest control agents, remain unclear. In an experimental study in cabbage fields we tested how sown flower strips on field margins and <b>intersowing</b> with cornflower affected the species richness, abundance and community composition of ground beetles and spiders. Furthermore, we investigated whether effects of flower margins are dependent on {{the distance from the}} field margins. We found that field margins generally harboured higher species richness, whereas effects on abundance were weaker. Intersown cornflower had positive effects on spider and ground beetle abundance, but affected species richness only weakly. Our results do not provide evidence for effects of distance from the flowery field margins on predator richness or abundance. Species composition was strongly affected by the habitat management actions. We conclude that habitat management practices like flower strips on field margins and <b>intersowing</b> with flowers, which are primarily added to attract and enhance parasitoids for pest control, also benefit biodiversity conservation in spiders and ground beetles. They also positively affect the abundance of these primarily predatory taxa, which adds to the biocontrol potential of non-crop flowering plants...|$|E
40|$|The {{potential}} effect of two sowing dates of ryegrass, Lolium perenne L. var. Elka as an interplant in winter leek, Allium porrum L., on weed control, soil nitrogen allocation and crop yield was studied at two sites in Switzerland. In {{order to reduce}} potential competition with the ryegrass, row application of the herbicide methazol (as additional treatment) and increased fertiliser doses in spring (as split-plot treatment) were used, and compared with a weed-free control. Ryegrass was sown 4 weeks (early) and 6 weeks (late) after planting of the leek, allowing for one and two mechanical weed control treatments, respectively, prior to sowing. Under the experimental conditions, <b>intersowing</b> ryegrass 6 weeks after planting resulted in crop yield {{similar to that in}} the control plots. Crop quality variates were increased and the overall production system was environmentally more advantageous. The combination of two mechanical weed control treatments followed by ryegrass <b>intersowing</b> suppressed weeds sufficiently without herbicide applications. Approximately 20 kg N/ha could be retained from being washed out over the winter, and c. 50 kg N/ha was stored in the interplants up to harvest. The interplants were incorporated into the soil after the harvest to serve as N-source for the subsequent crop. Surplus fertiliser doses in spring increased N-allocation to leek in the control plots. However, when ryegrass was present, it mainly derived a benefit, resulting in only slightly increased N-allocation to leek, or even reduce...|$|E
40|$|Researchers {{worked with}} farmers in eastern Uganda to develop {{alternatives}} for soil management using crotalaria (Crotalaria ochroleuca), mucuna (Mucuna pruriens var. utilis), lablab (Dolichos lablab), and canavalia (Canavalia ensiformis) as green manures in short-term fallows. The participatory research {{was part of}} a community-based approach for systems improvement. Grain yields of maize (Zea mays) and bean (Phaseolus vulgaris) following one season of crotalaria fallow were 41 % and 43 %, respectively, more than following a two-season weedy fallow. Grain yields of maize following a one-season fallow with mucuna and lablab were 60 % and 50 % higher, respectively, as compared with maize following maize. Maize and bean yield were more, although effects were small, during the second and third subsequent seasons, indicating probable residual effects of the green manures. Mucuna and lablab were successfully produced by <b>intersowing</b> into maize at three weeks after sowing maize, although the yields of the associated maize crop were reduced by 24 % to 28 %. Farmers estimated the labor requirements for mucuna and lablab to be less than for crotalaria. Farmers independently experimented on how these species can be integrated into banana (Musa spp.), coffee (Coffea robusta), sweet potato (Ipomoea batatas), and cassava (Manihot esculenta) production systems. Farmers reported that the beneficial effects of the green manures included higher food-crop yields; weed suppression; improved soil fertility, soil moisture, and soil tilth; and erosion control. Mucuna and lablab were preferred because of reduced labor requirements and increased net benefits compared with continuous cropping. Farmer participation in the green manure research resulted in efficient generation and adaptation of green manure technology now being promoted in eastern and central Uganda. Peer-reviewe...|$|E
