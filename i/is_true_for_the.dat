5|$|The wine gallon was {{abolished}} in Britain in 1826, {{and this}} system {{was replaced by}} a new one based on the newly introduced imperial gallon. Since the imperial gallon is 20% more than the liquid gallon, the same <b>is</b> <b>true</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> imperial pint in relation to the liquid pint. This explains why the number of fluid ounces per gallon had to be adjusted in the new system so that the fluid ounce was not changed too much by the reform. Even so, the modern UK fluid ounce is 4% less than the US fluid ounce, and the same <b>is</b> <b>true</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> smaller units. For some years both systems were used concurrently in the UK.|$|E
5|$|Because Neptune {{is not a}} solid body, its {{atmosphere}} undergoes differential rotation. The wide {{equatorial zone}} rotates with {{a period of about}} 18hours, which is slower than the 16.1-hour rotation of the planet's magnetic field. By contrast, the reverse <b>is</b> <b>true</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> polar regions where the rotation period is 12hours. This differential rotation is the most pronounced of any planet in the Solar System, and it results in strong latitudinal wind shear.|$|E
5|$|In 2007, the United States Mint began {{releasing}} {{a set of}} half-ounce $10 gold coins under the First Spouse Program with engravings of portraits of the First Ladies on the obverse. When a President served without a spouse, a gold coin is issued that bears an obverse image emblematic of Liberty as depicted on a circulating coin of that era and a reverse image emblematic of themes of that President's life. This <b>is</b> <b>true</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> coins for Thomas Jefferson, Andrew Jackson, Martin Van Buren, and James Buchanan's First Ladies, but not the coin for Chester A. Arthur's First Lady, which will instead depict suffragette Alice Paul.|$|E

25|$|In Dutch, ezelsbruggetje ('little {{bridge of}} asses') {{is the word}} for a mnemonic. The same <b>is</b> <b>true</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> German Eselsbrücke.|$|E
25|$|Bakshi {{does not}} {{elaborate}} on {{different kinds of}} Orcs through dialogue (as <b>is</b> <b>true</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> whole film), though some Orcs are clearly visually different from others.|$|E
25|$|This <b>is</b> <b>true</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> Coptic Orthodox Church; use of {{the term}} and order of {{services}} are somewhat different in the Ethiopian, Syrian, and the other Oriental Orthodox Churches.|$|E
500|$|... the Zarankiewicz {{conjecture}} {{is known}} to <b>be</b> <b>true</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> complete bipartite graphs [...] with [...]|$|R
5|$|Cryptologist Tomi Melka deduced that Fischer's {{hypothesis}} cannot <b>be</b> <b>true</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> entire Staff, {{let alone}} other texts.|$|R

25|$|It {{follows from}} this formula that U and V jointly act irreducibly on the Schrödinger {{representation}} since this <b>is</b> <b>true</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> operators given by kernels that are Schwartz functions.|$|E
25|$|Pioneers of town planning, such as Thomas Coglan Horsfall and Patrick Geddes called Ruskin an {{inspiration}} and invoked his ideas in their writings. The same <b>is</b> <b>true</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> {{founders of the}} garden city movement, Ebenezer Howard and Raymond Unwin.|$|E
25|$|A {{more precise}} result <b>is</b> <b>true</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> C*-algebra of all bounded linear {{operators}} on a Hilbert space: If T {{is such an}} operator and ||T|| < 1nbsp&minus&nbsp&2/n for some integer n > 2, then T is the mean of n unitary operators.|$|E
50|$|It {{is often}} said that the {{hypothesis}} is the sufficient condition of the thesis, and thethesis the necessary condition of the hypothesis; that is to say, it is sufficient that <b>the</b> hypothesis <b>be</b> <b>true</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> thesis to <b>be</b> true; while {{it is necessary that}} <b>the</b> thesis <b>be</b> <b>true</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> hypothesis to <b>be</b> <b>true</b> also. When a theorem and its reciprocal <b>are</b> <b>true</b> we say that its hypothesis is the necessary and sufficient condition of the thesis; that is to say, that it {{is at the same time}} both cause and consequence.|$|R
50|$|The {{film was}} {{run in the}} time the Dutch gabber scene was on its highpoint. <b>The</b> same <b>was</b> <b>true</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> {{recreational}} use of XTC under Dutch youths.|$|R
50|$|In 1921, Randolph was <b>the</b> setting <b>for,</b> and {{provided}} {{some of the}} cast of, a silent movie called The Offenders. In 1922 <b>the</b> same <b>was</b> <b>true</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> film Insinuation.|$|R
25|$|The set of {{monomial}} symmetric functions parametrized by partitions form a {{basis of}} R as graded R-module, those parametrized by partitions of d being homogeneous of degree d; the same <b>is</b> <b>true</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> set of Schur functions (also parametrized by partitions).|$|E
25|$|The {{central zone}} of Lofn, its rim and {{the ring of}} bright ejecta are water rich as was {{determined}} by the infrared spectroscopic observations by Galileo. Opposite <b>is</b> <b>true</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> dark material of the outer impact deposits, which appears to be relatively ice poor, but contains increased amounts of carbon dioxide.|$|E
25|$|The ZIP Codes for the {{incorporated}} city of Laurel are 20707, 20708, 20709, 20725, and 20756. Additionally, Although {{served by}} the Laurel post office, Montpelier is not within the city limits; the same <b>is</b> <b>true</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> unincorporated communities of Scaggsville and Whiskey Bottom in Howard County, and Maryland City and Russett in Anne Arundel County.|$|E
50|$|Once UIL Class 5A is realigned in 2017, Reedy and Independence are {{expected}} to become Rivals. This is believed because it has <b>been</b> <b>true</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> past six high schools in Frisco ISD.|$|R
6000|$|This <b>was</b> <b>true,</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> post-office Andrea Ferrara has a {{stirring}} history, but <b>for</b> <b>the</b> present its price was the important thing. [...] "Dr. McQueen offered a pound note for it," [...] said Tommy.|$|R
60|$|This <b>was</b> <b>true,</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> train {{had stopped}} at a way station, having broken {{something}} on the engine, and the thief had left, to walk {{the remainder of the}} distance to Middletown on foot.|$|R
25|$|As {{can be seen}} in the 2D {{synchronous}} spectrum on the right, {{the intensity}} changes of the peaks at 10 and 30 are related and the intensity of the peak at 10 and 30 changes in the opposite direction (negative cross-peak at (10,30)). The same <b>is</b> <b>true</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> peaks at 20 and 40.|$|E
25|$|The 3G {{support is}} limited to few USB 3G modems {{as a result of}} the old kernel. The same <b>is</b> <b>true</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> Wi-Fi module. The Ath5k driver used in the device for the ZD1211B module had been {{replaced}} since 2.6.18 for providing an unstable connection. As it is running 2.4.20, the old driver is still in use.|$|E
25|$|As {{an example}} of the {{transfer}} principle, the statement that for any nonzero number x, 2xnbsp&≠nbsp&x, <b>is</b> <b>true</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> real numbers, and it is in the form required by the transfer principle, so it is also true for the hyperreal numbers. This shows that {{it is not possible to}} use a generic symbol such as ∞ for all the infinite quantities in the hyperreal system; infinite quantities differ in magnitude from other infinite quantities, and infinitesimals from other infinitesimals.|$|E
6000|$|... "Fear not," [...] {{answered}} the Dream. [...] "Look, {{there are more}} for Asti." [...] And it <b>was</b> <b>true,</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> silver cup brimmed once more with cold water, and on the golden platter were other cakes.|$|R
50|$|Germans {{were placed}} under a {{different}} law than Slavs. While those were unfree (except <b>for</b> <b>the</b> nobles), did not own the soil they cultivated, and were to serve the nobility, <b>the</b> opposite <b>was</b> <b>true</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> Germans.|$|R
5|$|Exit visas {{were issued}} by the federal MER, but also by its all-union foreign affairs {{ministries}} and by the Ministry of Internal Affairs. <b>The</b> same <b>was</b> <b>true</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> civilian external passports that were issued to Soviet citizens.|$|R
25|$|Electrochemical {{capacitors}} (supercapacitors) {{consist of}} two electrodes separated by an ion-permeable membrane (separator), and an electrolyte ionically connecting both electrodes. When the electrodes are polarized by an applied voltage, ions in the electrolyte form electric double layers of opposite polarity to the electrode's polarity. For example, positively polarized electrodes {{will have a}} layer of negative ions at the electrode/electrolyte interface along with a charge-balancing layer of positive ions adsorbing onto the negative layer. The opposite <b>is</b> <b>true</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> negatively polarized electrode.|$|E
25|$|Even {{more curious}} is the {{presence}} of patterns of glazed bricks and various plaques bearing initials and enigmatic symbols. As already mentioned, the porch gable contains glazed headers in a diamond shape (diapering) and a glazed header barge line (a diagonal line of bricks following the barge boards on the gable), but these embellishments are unevenly spaced so that the diamond is clearly off-center (see porch picture in gallery). This irregularity <b>is</b> <b>true</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> use of glazed headers throughout the structure.|$|E
25|$|For triads, major or minor always {{refer to}} the third interval, while {{augmented}} and diminished always {{refer to the}} fifth (an augmented fifth above the root and a diminished fifth above the root, respectively). The same <b>is</b> <b>true</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> corresponding symbols (e.g., Cm means Cm3, and C+ means C+5). Thus, the terms third and fifth and the corresponding symbols 3 and 5 are typically omitted. It is assumed that the chord-playing musician will play the 3rd and 5th above the root, {{so this is not}} explicitly stated.|$|E
