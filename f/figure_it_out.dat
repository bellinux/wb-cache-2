5|$|As Double Dare grew messier, a green slime {{substance}} {{became more}} commonly used in physical challenges and obstacles. Slime was originally introduced on another Nickelodeon program, You Can't Do That on Television. Double Dares high viewership led to greater visibility for Nickelodeon's association with slime, and saw it featured in promotions for the network in the late 1980s. The substance proliferated further, including annual slimings on the Kids' Choice Awards, a slime geyser at Nickelodeon Studios, and slime-based segments on other game shows including Wild & Crazy Kids and <b>Figure</b> <b>It</b> <b>Out.</b> The relationship of Nickelodeon and slime still lasts on the network.|$|E

The pilots were confused about their location and were trying to <b>figure</b> <b>it</b> <b>out</b> based on reports from ATC, the flight computer and a portable GPS device.

On Patton's acting, series co-creator Angela Santomero stated that Patton brought Joe, his character, closer to the preschool viewer, as Joe was more willing to [...] "jump into a problem rather than <b>figure</b> <b>it</b> <b>out</b> first like Steve".

He also argued that Phostle and Philippus represent two-halves of [...] "an ambivalent father figure" [...] within the story, with the former prefiguring Calculus [...] "more than any other previous character". He suggests that when hiding on the Aurora, Philippus can be compared to The Phantom of the Opera, as he steals a stick of dynamite and climbs up the ship's mast before threatening to detonate the weapon. Apostolidès believed that the shooting star itself is [...] "more a religious mystery than a scientific one" [...] and that Tintin is therefore [...] "the perfect one to <b>figure</b> <b>it</b> <b>out</b> in some religious way—that is, unrealistically". Apostolidès analysed the political component of the story in terms of [...] "the incarnation of unregulated capitalism against the spirit of European values", arguing that Hergé was adhering to [...] "a utopian vision that, in 1942, smacks of pro-German propaganda".|$|E

[...] Clinton, meanwhile, said as little as possible about the situation, preferring to let Giuliani's drama play out on its own; on May 17, as he huddled with his doctors over whether to choose surgery or radiation as his treatment while facing conflicting political advice from his aides, she won the unanimous approval of delegates to the Democratic Party state convention at the Pepsi Arena in Albany, giving a constrained acceptance speech because she did not know her general election opponent.|$|E

Phineas and Ferb are aware that something happens to get rid of their scheme for the day, but do not know that Perry is the cause behind it and are largely dismissive of it.

[...] "It's something that we're doing for people who care to <b>figure</b> <b>it</b> <b>out</b> and follow it, but it's not something that a viewer has to consider when they watch the show." [...] Abrams also revealed that the seemingly unrelated frogs which have the Greek letter Phi (Φ) imprinted on their back appeared in promos for the show have significance {{within the context of the}} series, saying [...] "it's part of the code of the show." [...] The glyph code was cracked by an editor at the technology site Ars Technica, who discovered it to be a simple substitution cipher used to spell out a single thematic word for each episode; for example, the pilot episode's eight glyphs spell out the word [...] "observer". Whether there is a further second-order code to be solved remains to be seen. Additionally, the glyphs are representative of some of the means by which Walter solves a case (such as the moth/butterfly from [...] "Johari Window", the seahorse strain of DNA from [...] "The Bishop Revival").
