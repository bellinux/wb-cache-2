50|$|Swirl <b>flap</b> <b>position</b> is {{adjusted}} by {{an electrical}} or vacuum-activated servo mechanism which {{is under the}} control of the engine management system. In a typical implementation the flaps will be closed at idle speed, creating additional turbulence in the intake. As engine speed increases, the flaps are gradually opened until, at around 2,000 rpm, they are parallel to the airflow and present virtually no resistance. Their purpose is to ensure that the air entering the cylinder is sufficiently turbulent for good fuel-air mixing even at low engine speeds. This aids in reducing certain toxic emissions and may also improve low-end power and torque.|$|E
50|$|The {{compressor}} redesign, {{as well as}} {{addressing the}} need for high temperature materials such as Waspaloy in the rear stages had to address the aerodynamic shortcomings inherent in any turbomachine compressor when ingesting very hot air (800 F at Mach 3.2). The route chosen to keep the J58 compressor pumping was to bleed air from the compressor 4th stage through 6 external tubes to the afterburner. In addition a 2-position trailing edge flap {{was added to the}} inlet guide vanes. The bleed and adjustable <b>flap</b> <b>position</b> kept the compressor working efficiently despite the high temperature air delivered to it by the intake.|$|E

50|$|The {{stall warning}} system {{utilizes}} a stall warning vane {{on each side}} of the nose. The vanes provide regulated voltage input to the angle-of-attack transducers, modified by a stall warning bias box to compensate for <b>flap</b> <b>position.</b> The angle-of-attack transducer supplies a proportional voltage to the angle-of-attack of the aircraft. When the aircraft speed is 7% above stall, the stall warning energizes a control column shaker that produces a low-frequency buffet signal through the control column to warn the crew. When both angle-of-attack transducer vanes increase to 5% above stall, the pitch servo commands an aircraft nose down attitude. The force applied in the nose down direction is 80 pounds at the control wheel. When the angle-of-attack transducer vanes decrease below the stall point, the nose down command is removed. An angle-of-attack indicator translates signals from the stall warning system into visual indications of the aircraft angle-of-attack and allows the crew to monitor the proximity of stall caution zone. The indicator face is divided into green (safe), yellow (caution) and red (danger) segments.|$|E
50|$|In a February 2, 2011 webinar, Monett {{discussed}} many {{of technical}} aspects of the Onex, {{as well as providing}} a description of the early flight tests. The Onex is constructed from 6061 aluminum and features a single 15-gallon molded plastic fuel tank mounted in the fuselage, situated so the pilot can see the level of the fuel remaining. Monett claims that this type of tank is the safest and placing it in the fuselage, as opposed to in the wing, will reduce the chances of a fire in case of an accident. A further advantage of this configuration is that the fuel system will be gravity-fed and therefore not require a fuel pump, as it would if the tank were in the wings. Monett discussed the aim of simplicity and that a major goal is to reduce the parts count and thereby cost and weight. He also indicated that on the first test flight the aircraft climbed at 1200 ft per minute and was very responsive to the controls. Monett stated also that he had done some cursory testing of the flaps and found the 45° <b>flap</b> <b>position</b> to be very effective.|$|E

50|$|The {{disadvantages}} of swirl flaps are mainly associated with fouling by exhaust gas recirculation, which leaves tarry deposits on the flaps {{and the inside}} of the intake manifold. Over time the flaps can begin to stick in one position and the engine management system may report an error code if the correct <b>flap</b> <b>position</b> cannot be achieved within a few percent of the design specification. More seriously, the flaps or their mountings can fracture under the strain and parts can enter the cylinder. This almost always causes major engine damage due to the very small clearances inside a diesel engine. The BMW M47TU 2-litre engine manufactured between 2001 and 2004, and the similar 3-litre engine, is notorious for swirl flap failure, as the small screws used to secure the flaps to their spindle will fall into the intake ports if the spindle fractures; in 2004 the intake manifold was redesigned to eliminate these. Some owners choose to have the flaps removed as a precaution, with blanking plates fitted to maintain manifold sealing. In many cases the impact on driveability and fuel economy is negligible.|$|E
50|$|The {{aircraft}} {{involved in}} the accident, a two engine turboprop, was known to have a right engine that ran hotter and used more fuel in flight than the left engine. In addition to the high fuel flow and oil temperature in the right engine, the aircraft had poor cockpit lighting at night. Observation flights by the National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) investigators found that errors in flap settings due to poor lighting were common on Twin Otters during night flights. The area around the flap control overhead was not illuminated; and the <b>flap</b> <b>position</b> indicator on the windscreen center post was poorly illuminated {{to the point of}} being barely visible. Some of the lights in the engine gauges had been incorrectly replaced with red, instead of white bulbs, making the gauges hard to see. Pilots had requested the maintenance crew standardize on one color of light bulb, but this had not been done at the time of the accident. Among Downeast pilots, there was discussion of the first officer's altimeter sticking and indicating as much as a 100 ft (30m) difference in altitude compared to the pilot's altimeter during descent and ascent. There was no formal record of the altimeter problem in the aircraft's logbooks, but investigators were told that it had been checked during an inspection in the past with no defects found.|$|E
50|$|Operational loads {{monitoring}} (OLM) {{is a term}} {{given to}} act of investigating {{the characteristics of a}} structure in its normal operating environment. This term is often used to describe programs involving aircraft to extending their in-service life in a manner that does not compromise flight safety. A typical program would involve the installation of strain gauges to measure loads, accelerometers to measure g-force and other parameters to support the program or to add value (such as <b>flap</b> <b>position,</b> aircraft altitude, environmental conditions etc.), data acquisition system to process this data and a recorder to save the data for later analysis. In this way it is very similar to structural health monitoring, a term that is sometimes also used to describe operational loads monitoring. Unlike Health and Usage Monitoring Systems, OLM programs are generally a short term project used to assess the remaining useful safe life of an airframe. This is especially important when an aircraft's role changes as the stresses and strains may now be significantly different from those initially anticipated. OLM program's benefits include a possible increased safe operating life figure and helping to prevent accidents such as the C-130 crash that occurred after the platform had been modified and flown for a different mission (fire fighting).There are several active OLM programs currently underway, including research initiatives to standardize approaches for civilian aircraft.|$|E
