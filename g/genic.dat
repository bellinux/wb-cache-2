25|$|A {{separate}} genetic {{study on}} <b>genic</b> admixture {{was conducted by}} Argentine and French scientists from multiple academic and scientific institutions (CONICET, UBA, Centres d'anthropologie de Toulouse). This study showed that the average contribution to Argentine ancestry was 79.9% European, 15.8% Amerindian and 4.3% African. Another similar {{study was conducted in}} 2006, and its results were also similar. A team led by Michael F. Seldin from the University of California, with members of scientific institutes from Argentina, the United States, Sweden and Guatemala, analyzed samples from 94 individuals and concluded that the average genetic structure of the Argentine population contains a 78.1% European contribution, 19.4% Amerindian contribution and 2.5% African contribution (using the Bayesian algorithm).|$|E
25|$|Though music critics noted Amuro's {{evolution}} from pop to R, the mid-2000s saw {{a decline in}} sales, both albums and singles. Play (2007), her eighth studio album, {{was a period of}} resurgence in Japanese music for her. Eventually, she moved onto electronic dance music and English language with follow-up records Uncontrolled (2012) and Feel (2013); her eleventh studio album, <b>Genic</b> (2015), is her last studio album, whereas Finally (2017) will be her final overall release of her career. While some parts of her career gained her credit as a songwriter and producer, Amuro has mainly been a studio and touring artist, with many of her releases reaching number-one in Japan. Aside from music, she has appeared on various advertisement campaigns in Japan and worked as a entrepreneur with her own management company, Stella88 and her own record label, Dimension Point.|$|E
25|$|The {{next stage}} took {{place after the}} {{development}} of genetics in the early 20th century, when it was appreciated that the set of chromosomes (the karyotype) was the carrier of the genes. Levitsky {{seems to have been}} the first to define the karyotype as the phenotypic appearance of the somatic chromosomes, in contrast to their <b>genic</b> contents. Investigation into the human karyotype took many years to settle the most basic question: how many chromosomes does a normal diploid human cell contain? In 1912, Hans von Winiwarter reported 47 chromosomes in spermatogonia and 48 in oogonia, concluding an XX/XO sex determination mechanism. Painter in 1922 was not certain whether the diploid number of man was 46 or 48, at first favoring 46. He revised his opinion later from 46 to 48, and he correctly insisted on man having an XX/XY system. Considering their techniques, these results were quite remarkable.|$|E
25|$|During {{the late}} 2000s, Amuro {{released}} Play, which was highlighted {{as one of}} her key re-inventions of her entire career. Sonically, the record relied on R and hip hop elements, but started to involve contemporary dance-pop music; to an extent, Tills from AllMusic compared the effort to the works of Jennifer Lopez and En Vogue. 2012's Uncontrolled saw yet another transition with her sound, leaving R and focusing on electronic dance music. Additionally, this saw her first experimentation with full-length English language tracks. Unlike her previous records, Uncontrolled ventured into Western and Korean practitioners to helm the collection, including the likes of The Nervo Twins, Henrik Nordenback, Christian Fast, and Peter Mansson. This trend also moved onto her follow-up album Feel, where she worked with artists such as Hook n Sling, Dsign Music and Zedd. Her final studio album, <b>Genic</b> (2015), was her first record to not be handled by Japanese producers, and her only record to induce all its tracks with English language.|$|E

2500|$|... "Birthday" [...] {{is a song}} {{recorded}} by Japanese recording artist Namie Amuro for her twelfth studio and third English album, <b>Genic</b> (2015). It was written by Emyli, composed by Andreas Carlsson, Gabrielle Symons, Michael Lerios, Demitri Lerios, Svante Halldin and Jakob Hazell, whilst production was handled by Halldin and Hazell. The promotional recording premiered on May 11, 2015, and served as the first promotional single from the album. Musically, [...] "Birthday" [...] is dance-pop song, influenced by pop and bubblegum pop. Lyrically, it celebrates Amuro's birthday.|$|E
2500|$|... "Heaven" [...] {{was written}} by Emyli, {{produced}} by German-Russian DJ Zedd and composed by Zedd, Emyli and Tommy Clint. After the breakthrough of Zedd's success with his singles [...] "Clarity", Amuro's label Dimension Point and Avex Trax contacted him to produce a song for Amuro's album Feel which he accepted. This was Amuro's first collaboration with Zedd, and they would later collaborate again on her 2015 studio album <b>Genic</b> despite none of his songs making the final cut. Emyli started collaborating with Amuro since her 2012 album Uncontrolled and sung background vocals for [...] "Heaven".|$|E
2500|$|... "Birthday" [...] was {{the only}} {{charting}} track from the <b>Genic</b> album, debuting at number 36 on Billboard's Japan Hot 100 chart.

2500|$|... "Birthday" [...] {{was written}} by Japanese {{recording}} artist Emyli, whilst production was handled by SeventyEight production member's Svante Halldin and Jakob Hazell. The song's composers: Andreas Carlsson, Gabrielle Symons, Michael Lerios, Demitri Lerios, and SeventyEight, composed the track by using a drum machine, electric guitar, synthesizers, keyboards, and a trombone. It was programmed and mixed by DJ Kensei, known by the alias D.O.I., at his recording studio Daimonion Recordings. Emyli was in control of vocal production, and hired Alisa, Gary Adkins, and Olivia Burrell to provide backing vocals during the chorus. It was finally mastered by American music engineer Tom Coyne at Sterling Sound Studios in New York City, New York. The promotional recording premiered through the <b>Genic</b> (2015) album sampled, released in April 2015. It was then released on Amuro's YouTube channel on May 11, alongside its accompanying music video.|$|E
2500|$|In early April, Amuro {{announced}} {{that she would be}} releasing her twelfth studio and third bilingual album <b>Genic</b> on June 10. It also marked her first record with her own management company Stella88, which she created after leaving Vision Factory. Despite there being five music videos from the record, the entire collection of tracks were newly-recorded and featured no singles. Despite this, it was commercially success, peaking atop of the Oricon Albums Chart and sold 250,000 copies in Japan alone. To promote the album, the singer conducted her Livegenic tour between September 2015, and February the following year. The live DVD and Blu-Ray formats were released on March 2, 2016. During the course of her December dates, Amuro released her second independent maxi-single [...] "Red Carpet" [...] on the 2nd, which included the B-side track [...] "Black-Up". Despite reaching number two on the Oricon Singles Chart, sales slumped and only shifted 36,000 units in Japan, making it one of Amuro's lowest-selling singles to date.|$|E
50|$|<b>Genic</b> capture was {{proposed}} as a simpler alternative to another theory explaining the lek paradox that proposed that sexual selection creates disruptive selection, i.e. positive selection for genetic variance. <b>Genic</b> capture {{does not require}} any particular fitness function.|$|E
5000|$|Previous {{sections}} {{found that}} the within line <b>genic</b> variance {{is based upon the}} substitution-derived <b>genic</b> variance ( [...] &sigma;2A [...] )—but the amongst line <b>genic</b> variance is based upon the gene model allelic variance ( [...] &sigma;2a [...] ). These two cannot simply be added to get total <b>genic</b> variance. One approach in avoiding this problem was to re-visit the derivation of the average allele substitution effect, and to construct a version, ( [...] &beta; f [...] ), that incorporates the effects of the dispersion. Crow and Kimura achieved this [...] using the re-centered allele effects (a&bull;, d&bull;, (-a)&bull; [...] ) discussed previously effects re-defined". However, this was found subsequently to under-estimate slightly the total <b>Genic</b> variance, and a new variance-based derivation led to a refined version. The refined version is: [...] &beta; f [...] = { a2 + [...] ) / (1 + f [...] ) 2(q − p [...] ) ad + [...] ) / (1 + f [...] ) (q − p [...] )2 d2 } (1/2) ...|$|E

5000|$|<b>Genic</b> capture is a {{hypothesis}} explaining {{the maintenance of}} genetic variance in traits under sexual selection. A classic problem in sexual selection is the fixation of alleles that are beneficial under strong selection, thereby eliminating the benefits of mate choice. <b>Genic</b> capture resolves this paradox by suggesting that additive genetic variance of sexually selected traits reflects the genetic variance in total condition. A deleterious mutation anywhere in the genome will adversely affect condition, and thereby adversely affect a condition-dependent sexually selected trait. <b>Genic</b> capture therefore resolves the lek paradox by proposing that recurrent deleterious mutation maintains additive genetic variance in fitness by incorporating the entire mutation load of an individual. Thus any condition-dependent trait [...] "captures" [...] the overall genetic variance in condition. Rowe and Houle argued that <b>genic</b> capture ensures that good genes will become a central feature {{of the evolution of}} any sexually selected trait.|$|E
50|$|<b>Genic</b> capture {{can also}} play a role in {{accelerating}} adaptation to new environments.|$|E

5000|$|Graphs to {{the left}} show these three <b>genic</b> variances, {{together}} with the three quasi-dominance variances, across all values of f, for p = 0.5 (at which the quasi-dominance variance is at a maximum). Graphs to the right show the Genotypic variance partitions (being the sums of the respective <b>genic</b> and quasi-dominance partitions) changing over ten generations with an example f = 0.10.|$|E
5000|$|Secondly, {{notice the}} other trends. It is {{probably}} intuitive that the within line variances decline to zero with continued inbreeding, {{and this is}} seen {{to be the case}} (both at the same linear rate (1-f) [...] ). The amongst line variances both increase with inbreeding up to f = 0.5, the <b>genic</b> variance at the rate of 2f, and the quasi-dominance variance at the rate of (f − f2). At f > 0.5, however, the trends change. The amongst line <b>genic</b> variance continues its linear increase until it equals the total <b>genic</b> variance. But, the amongst line quasi-dominance variance now declines towards zero, because (f − f2) also declines with f > 0.5.|$|E
