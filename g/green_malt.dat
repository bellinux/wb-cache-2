2500|$|Malting is {{the process}} of {{converting}} barley or other cereal grains into malt, for use in brewing, distilling, or in foods and takes place in a maltings, sometimes called a malthouse, or a malting floor. The cereal is spread out on the malting floor in a layer of 8 to 12cm (3 to 5 inch) depth. The malting process starts with drying the grains to a moisture content below 14%, and then storing for around six weeks to overcome seed dormancy. When ready, the grain is immersed or steeped in water two or three times over two or three days to allow the grain to absorb moisture and to start to sprout. When the grain has a moisture content of around 46%, it is transferred to the malting or germination floor, where it is constantly turned over for around five days while it is air-dried [...] The grain at this point is called [...] "green malt".

50|$|Barley is {{soaked in}} {{water from the}} source {{for two to three}} days then spread over the floor of the malting house. The <b>green</b> <b>malt</b> is then dried in a kiln over peat smoke. The malt is then milled into grist, which is like a coarse flour. Grist is then mixed with hot water in the mash tun at about 70 °C for about an hour. This is drained off and the second water, which is hotter, is added and allowed to run {{straight}} through. The third water is even hotter and is used as the first water for the next batch. The sugary wort is collected, cooled and then fermented in large pine vessels called wash backs. Yeast is added and after 48 hours of fermentation the wash is made. The wash is then pre-heated in a wash-charger and from there goes to the wash still. This is a traditional pot still made of copper and is of a shape unchanged in the history of Scotch whisky making. The wash is heated in the pot still so the alcohol vapour rises up and cools and condenses in the low wines receiver. The low wines then passes through to the spirit still where it is distilled again. The spirit running through the pot and spirit stills is subject to Her Majesty’s Customs and Excise Duty and so is kept under lock and key. It can be sampled and tested by the stillman via the spirit sample safe. The spirit from the spirit still is divided in three parts, but only the middle cut or “Heart of the Run” is suitable to be made into malt whisky. The other two parts are fed back into the low wines receiver to be re-distilled. The middle cut then goes to an oak spirit receiver and from there to the filling vats in the spirit store.|$|E

40|$|Abstract: <b>Green</b> <b>malt</b> is a semiindustrialized product {{obtained}} from barley and it represents a natural product, rich in enzymes and vitamins. In this paper were conducted laboratory researches to determine the optimum working regime for obtaining malt from barley. The research was conducted in the laboratory, which {{is equipped with a}} Jacobsen germination machine, which helped in projecting and realizing different work methods in obtaining <b>green</b> <b>malt.</b> In the experiments performed were considered different working conditions for germination of barley, such as measurement and monitoring of time, water level and water temperature in the tank for soaking and germination of barley. Thus, barley germination humidity ranged from 14 % to 52 % and temperature of 14 o C to 25 o C, which allowed the establishment of working diagram families, and under their influence were obtained different times for germination of barley. Barley varieties used in these experiments were Andreea and Mădălin which were grown on an agricultural land in the county of Iasi, area of Trifeşti and the Mădălin variety cultivated in the area of Peceneaga, Tulcea country. Following the experiences made with this machine was able to increase and to decrease willingly the speed of barley germination. By altering the speed of germination of barley were obtained several types of malt, which differ depending on the content of enzymes, fermentable sugar content, protein content and gums...|$|E
40|$|<b>Green</b> <b>malt</b> was kilned at 95 degrees C {{following}} two regimens: a standard regimen (SKR) and a rapid regimen (RKR). Both resulting malts were treated further in a tray dryer heated to 120 degrees C, as was <b>green</b> <b>malt</b> previously dried to 65 degrees C (TDR). Each regimen was monitored by determining the color, antioxidant activity (by both ABTS(center dot+) and FRAP methods), and polyphenolic profile. SKR and RKR malts exhibited decreased L* and increased b* values above approximately 80 degrees C. TDR malts changed significantly less, and color did not develop until 110 degrees C, implying that different chemical reactions lead to color in those malts. Antioxidant activity increased progressively with each regimen, although with TDR malts this became significant only at 110 - 120 degrees C. The RKR malt ABTS(center dot+) values {{were higher than}} those of the SKR malt. The main phenolics, that is, ferulic, p-coumaric, and vanillic acids, were monitored throughout heating. Ferulic acid levels increased upon heating to 80 degrees C for SKR and to 70 degrees C for RKR, with subsequent decreases. However, the levels for TDR malts did not increase significantly. The increase in free phenolics early in kilning could be due to enzymatic release of bound phenolics and/or easier extractability due to changes in the matrix. The differences between the kilning regimens used suggest that further modification of the regimens could lead to greater release of bound phenolics with consequent beneficial effects on flavor stability in beer and, more generally, on human health...|$|E

40|$|Low {{concentrations}} of (1, 3; 1, 4) -β-ᴅ-glucan are desired in malt/wort created from barley (Hordeum vulgare L.) to ensure efficiency during brewing. This goal {{can be achieved}} through low grain β-glucan content, high malt β-glucanase activity, or a combination thereof. Evaluation of these traits is time-consuming and expensive since malting must occur before analysis, thus they are ideal for the identification of associated markers to permit marker-assisted selection. Two genetic mapping approaches were taken to evaluate these traits. First, a bi-parental QTL mapping population was developed from the Western Canadian two-row, spring, hulled varieties CDC Meredith and CDC Kindersley. CDC Meredith has normal to higher grain β-glucan content and higher wort β-glucan content, while CDC Kindersley has normal to lower grain β-glucan content and very low wort β-glucan content. Secondly, a 92 member association mapping (AM) population was assembled consisting of two-row, spring, hulled elite malting breeding lines and varieties derived from eight different barley breeding programs focused on Western Canada. Both populations were grown over a two year period and assessed for kilned malt β-glucanase activity, grain, malt, and wort β-glucan content, plus <b>green</b> <b>malt</b> β-glucanase activity in the AM population. Both populations were genotyped using the Barley 9 K iSELECT Genotyping BeadChip and the QTL population was also genotyped with DArTseq markers. As expected, <b>green</b> <b>malt</b> β-glucanase activity typically had a stronger correlation to malt/wort β-glucan content than did either kilned malt β-glucanase activity or grain β-glucan content. Ten unique QTLs (four for grain β-glucan, two for malt β-glucan, and three for kilned malt β-glucanase) were identified in the QTL population and eight marker-trait associations were identified in the AM population for grain β-glucan, green/kilned malt β-glucanase, or a combination thereof. One common genomic region on chromosome 2 H was identified in both studies which was associated with grain β-glucan content. In the QTL and AM populations, six and five QTLs and marker-trait associations identified were novel, respectively, while the others overlay previously identified regions. In some cases, underlying genes were identified which may explain the observed associations. Lines with high β-glucanase activity and heat stability were identified in the AM population, thus through crossing, lines possessing both of these beneficial traits could be generated. Further trials {{to collect data on}} these traits would be desirable to validate the identified markers and confirm the β-glucanase heat stability data...|$|E
40|$|A proteinase was {{purified}} from germinated barley (<b>green</b> <b>malt</b> from Hordeum vulgare L. cv Morex) by acidic extraction, {{ammonium sulfate}} fractionation and successive chromatographies on CM-cellulose, hemoglobin sepharose, Sephadex G- 75 and organomercurial agarose columns. The overall purification and final recovery were 290 -fold and 7. 5 %, respectively. The purified enzyme was homogeneous on analytical gel electrophoresis, yielding a single protein associated with protease activity. An apparent molecular weight of about 20 kilodaltons was estimated for the native enzyme from gel filtration. SDS-gel electrophoresis revealed a single polypeptide of about 30 kilodaltons. The optimum pH for the hydrolysis of hemoglobin was around 3. 8. The enzyme was strongly inhibited by leupeptin but was insensitive to phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, indicating {{that it was}} a cysteine proteinase. It hydrolyzed several large proteins from various origins. The ability of the enzyme to digest barley storage proteins in vitro was examined using SDS-gel electrophoresis.

40|$|Graduation date: 1984 The malt {{alkaloids}} N-methyltyramine, N,N-dimethyltyramine (hordenine), N-methyl- 3 -aminomethylindole and N,N-dimethyl- 3 -aminomethylindole (gramine) {{are known}} precursors for N-nitrosamines. Analytical procedures were developed {{and applied to}} extract and quantify these alkaloids from malt, <b>green</b> <b>malt,</b> malt roots, and raw barley. A ground malt sample under nitrogen atmosphere was extracted with 5 percent concentrated ammonium hydroxide in methanol {{at room temperature for}} 24 hours. After purification, the extracted alkaloids were quantitated by reverse phase high performance liquid chromatography using both phosphate buffer and ion-pairing solvent systems. The recoveries obtained for the alkaloids listed were, respectively, 77. 4, 92. 0, 74. 0 and 80. 5 percent with detection limit of 0. 2, 0. 2, 0. 1 and 0. 1 μg/gm. Conformation of identity of each alkaloid was accomplished by TLC, UV, and MS. Twenty-three samples of kilned malts, five samples of green malts, ten samples of kilned malt roots, five samples of <b>green</b> <b>malt</b> roots, and ten raw barley samples, from a total of 11 varieties of Hordeum vulgare were analyzed for the alkaloids of interest. N-Methyltyramine was found in every sample from all sources with a mean and range, respectively, of 26. 8 (15. 7 - 48. 5), 21. 4 (11. 6 - 37. 5), 1959. 8 (1358. 4 - 2798. 4), 1532. 5 (962. 3 - 2091. 1) and 4. 7 μg/gm (0. 4 - 17. 9 μg/gm) on a dry weight basis. The means and ranges for hordenine were, respectively, 28. 1 (8. 9 - 42. 4), 21. 2 (9. 6 - 35. 5), 4066. 4 (2741. 2 - 5180. 1), 3363. 3 (1956. 2 - 4744. 3) and 0. 7 μg/gm (0. 5 - 1. 0 μg/gm). Gramine was found in only two barley malt varieties examined where kilned and green malts contained, respectively, mean values and ranges of 7. 4 (4. 9 - 10. 0) and 6. 0 μg/gm (4. 7 - 7. 3 μg/gm). N-Methyl- 3 -aminomethylindole was not detected in any of the samples examined. The results of this investigation indicated that the variety of barley affected alkaloid production during malting. The results also showed that the kilning step of the malting process increased the total amount of each alkaloid produced. Finally, room temperature nitrosation of five varieties of kilned and green malts, in which the contents of hordenine and gramine were known, was carried out with an excess of nitrite in acetic acid at pH 3. 2 for 18 hours. The amounts of N-nitrosodimethylamine (NDMA) obtained from this nitrosation were far greater than the expected yields for NDMA from the hordenine and gramine present in the malts. The results strongly suggest that the alkaloids hordenine and gramine were not the only precursors for NDMA and that there must be additional precursors; dimethylamine was suggested as a possibility...|$|E
40|$|In {{processes}} of barley plant development, various endo- and exopeptidases are involved. To determine {{the type and}} number of aminopeptidases that could participate in barley seed germination and tissue growth, their activities in extracts of non-germinated and germinated barley (Hordeum vulgare L. cv. Angora) grains and young tissues have been examined, {{and some of their}} properties determined. Aminopeptidases (AP) hydrolysing 2 -naphthylamides of various amino acids were present in dry and germinated grains, roots, seedlings and leaves, showing preferences for amino acids phenylalanine (Phe), arginine (Arg), leucine (Leu) and methionine (Met), and lower activity towards alanine (Ala), proline (Pro), glycine (Gly) and histidine (His). Levels and ratios of AP activities changed during germination and tissue development, indicating that APs of different specificities are required at different stages of germination and in young tissues. Thus, the increase of all aminopeptidase activities during the first 24 hours of germination and subsequent decrease show significant involvement in seed primary metabolism restoration. The activities of Arg- and HisAP are equally important in <b>green</b> <b>malt.</b> Seedlings and leaves have pronounced substrate specificity for Phe, Leu, Ala and Pro, while roots have the lowest AP specific activities. From the activities and determined properties, the presence of at least six aminopeptidases optimally active at pH= 7. 4 – 8. 2 could be discerned in dry and germinated grains, and young tissues of Angora barley.

40|$|AbstractThe {{manufacture}} of malt and beer requires large amounts of electrical and thermal energy which is nowadays mainly based on fossil fuels. In State of the Art breweries 7. 5 – 11. 5 kWhel [1] and 16. 7 – 33. 3 kWhth [1, 2] per hl of beer are needed (reference: final energy demand) and the annual output of medium to large sized breweries may easily exceed one million hl. The entire process heat demand of the thermally driven processes in breweries and malting plants can be met with heat at a temperature of between 25 and 105 °C on process level [3, 4]. This enables the integration of solar thermal energy supplied by conventional, non- concentrating solar thermal collector technologies such as flat-plate or evacuated tube collectors. In fact, providing thermal energy by means of solar thermal systems is mostly energy efficient if the energy from the sun is converted into heat and supplied to the process at minimum required temperature level (referred to as solar integration on process level). With this regard and {{in the framework of}} a European Union-funded demonstration project, three large-scale solar thermal systems (each with an installed thermal peak capacity ≥ 1 MWth) are being realized. The focus of the project is to demonstrate the integration of large scale solar thermal systems on process level for different applications (mashing, pasteurization of beer, drying of <b>green</b> <b>malt)</b> at process temperatures below 80 °C.

40|$|It {{is quite}} clear that in vitro {{experiments}} with pure substrates and highly purified enzyme preparations can {{do no more than}} indicate types of possible action. Therefore, already having a method of isolating a barley 	β -glucosan in a very high degree of purity, means for obtaining enzyme preparations of enhanced purity were sought, and it was hoped, by employing these preparations in the degradation of initially-water-soluble 	β -glucosan, to provide further evidence of the complex nature of the degradative scheme. Included in this approach are attempts to differentially inactivate endo- and exo-	β-glucosanases and cellobiase, and it will be seen that confirmation of an earlier assumption of the mechanism for the degradation of β -glucosan has arisen from this study. Furthermore, chromatographic and ionophoretic analyses of the degradation products of β -glucosan enzymolysis also offer the possibility of deteimining tne manner in which the β - 1, 3 - and (3 - 1, 4 - linkages are distributed within the β-glucosan molecule.

The wet malt was dried at 50 'C for 24 h. Total dry matter loss ranged from 8 - 19 %. Black Tx 430 had the highest losses. Density decreased for all the sorghums after malting; the extent of decrease was cultivar dependent. The (X- and P-amylase activity in sorghum malts produced (x- amylase levels ranging between 25 - 183 U/g. Black Tx 430 (183 U/g) and RTx 435 (178 U/g) had the highest values. Commercial barley malt had an (X-amylase activity of 189 U/g. P-Amylase activity was low for all cultivars, ranging from 11 to 41 U/g, with BTx 2752 and IS 9530 having the highest values. Decrease in RVA viscosity was significantly correlated with the (x-amylase calorimetric assay (r= 0. 97). The RVA is a promising method to measure (X-amylase activity; it is simple, fast, and requires minimum chemicals. Sorghum diastatic power (SDU) was not significantly correlated to (x-amylase activity at SDU values below 30. Above 30 SDU, (x- amylase activity was significantly correlated to diastatic power. Dry matter loss was significantly correlated to (Alpha-amylase activity and SDU. The <b>green</b> <b>malt</b> moisture was significantly positively correlated to dry matter loss. Malts produced from College Station cultivars gave higher (X-amylase levels than those from Lubbock. P-Amylase activities ranged from 28 - 33 U/g in the malts regardless of growth location. A second malting procedure using jars for steeping and germination was applied to 6 cultivars, and resulted in lower dry matter losses and 0 -amylase activity. Although (x-amylase levels were generally higher for the standard method, cultivars responded differently. Each cultivar may need optimum conditions to obtain the highest level of enzyme activity. Malting procedures require further control to obtain desired enzymatic levels with the least possible dry matter loss...|$|E
40|$|Common wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) is {{traditionally}} used in northern Europe {{as a source}} of fermentable extract to beer production. In Italy during the last ten years the number of brewery and micro-brewery has grown exponentially in parallel with the interest in malt and beer production whit local raw materials. Traditionally durum wheat varieties (Triticum turgidum subsp. durum) are used to pasta and bread production and few papers are present on durum wheat malting and brewing processes. This preliminary work is aimed to the development of durum wheat malt obtained from an ancient sicilian wheat variety and the study of some quality parameters for malt and wort production. The durum wheat variety “Simeto” was grown and harvested in 2015 in Sicily (Italy). The trials to produce a pale wheat malt were carried out on laboratory scale using 500 g of grains. Three consecutive cycles of steeping (16 hours) and air rest (8 hours) at 15 °C was used to obtain a 45 % of steeping degree. The grains were germinated for 5 days at 95 % of RH and 15 °C of temperature. The <b>green</b> <b>malt</b> was dried during kilning phase with initial temperature of 35 °C (8 hours) and gradually increased to 43 °C (16 hours). During the last 9. 5 hours of kilning the sample was divided in two parts to test two different final drying temperatures of 43 (SM 43) and 70 °C (SM 70). The rootlets were manually removed from the wheat malt and the samples were milled to make the chemical and physical analysis on wheat,wheat malt and congress wort derived from them. Humidity, betaglucan content betaglucanase activity, extract, colour, pH and apparent attenuation limit were determined according to Analytica EBC protocols. The main drawback during mashing with wheat malt are due to high-molecular-weight polymers (principally arabinoxylans and betaglucans). “Simeto” wheat show a betaglucan content of 0. 54 ± 0. 01 % w/w and after malting process be even lower, 0. 16 ± 0. 01 and 0. 13 ± 0. 04 % w/w, respectively for SM 43 and SM 70. The betaglucanase activity found on SM 43 was 165. 84 ± 4. 47 U/kg while for SM 70 was 142. 22 ± 5. 21 U/kg. These differences are probably due to the final drying temperature (70 °C) that partially inactivate betaglucanase enzymes. Extract (%) obtained from EBC congress wort show no significant difference between SM 43 and SM 70, respectively 81. 22 ± 1. 65 and 81. 68 ± 0. 87 % on d. b., in accordance with those reported in literature for typical pale wheat malt (81. 00 - 86. 00 % d. b.). The wort color found for both durum wheat malts was very pale, 3. 04 ± 0. 69 and 3. 28 ± 0. 15 EBC units, respectively for SM 43 and SM 70. The results show that “Simeto” wheat variety was suitable to pale malt production. The different temperatures used at the end of kilning phase do not significantly influence the qualitative parameters except for the betaglucanse activity. The malts production from ancient durum wheat varieties, could represent a new interesting way to further enrich the sources of fermentable products encouraging the maintenance of biodiversity. status: publishe...|$|E
40|$|Abstract Pilsner malt, one of {{the main}} {{ingredients}} for the production of beer, is made in a three-step production process which involves subsequent steeping, germination and kilning. Compared to pilsner malt, dark specialty malts are produced at higher temperatures. Depending on the applied drying procedure, dark specialty malts canbe further divided in colour, caramel and roasted malts. In that respect, colour malts are produced in a kiln at higher temperatures compared to pilsner malt, whereas caramel and roasted malts are manufactured in a roasting drum. The elevated temperatures applied during kilning and roasting intensify the non-enzymatic browning reactions, resulting in the formation of colour, flavour and antioxidant components. As the extent of these reactions is influenced by the reaction conditions, the presence and concentration of the previously mentioned compounds in dark specialtymalts depend on the applied processing parameters. When used for the production of beers, these malts can {{have a significant impact on}} the characteristics of the end product. In this research, the main objectives were to identify and characterise flavour components in different types of dark specialty malts and to elucidate the influence of the applied processing parameters on the development of flavour, colour and antioxidant power in caramel malts. Moreover, the evolution of dark specialtymalt flavour components during wort boiling and the influence of these malts on the flavour stability of beer was studied. First, headspace solid-phase microextraction coupled with gas chromatography and massspectrometry was used to characterise the volatile fraction of aqueous extracts and dry ground samples of different colour, caramel and roastedmalts. Following this procedure, more than 100 compounds could be identified including oxygen-, nitrogen- and sulphur containing heterocyclic components. Since caramel-like furanones and pyranones could only be extracted out of a dry matrix, an extraction technique was optimised to determine these components in dry ground malts. These results revealed that the malt type, and as a consequence the production process, had an important influence on the presence of components. In that respect, caramel-like flavour components such as maltol and furaneol proved to be present in the highest concentrations in caramel malts, whereas greatest amountsof the roasted-like pyrazines were found in roasted malts. In addition,no clear relationship between the malt colour and the concentration of flavour components could be established. Besides flavour components, malt characteristics such as moisture content, extract content and pH also mainly depended on the type of dark specialty malt. The influence of the time and temperature of the roasting process on the development of malt characteristics was studied during the production of caramel malt. This process comprises an initial saccharification step and a subsequent caramelisation step. During the first phase, the optimal formationof the reducing sugars, glucose and maltose, and free amino acids was closely related to the optimal temperatures of activity of the involved enzymes. As expected, it became clear that the time and temperature of the latter phase had an important influence on the evolution of several malt characteristics such as the moisture content, extract, pH, colour andreducing power. The development of important flavour components was highly influenced by the roasting temperature and the moisture content of the malt kernels. Moreover, the obtained results indicated that flavour development was not linked to the colour formation. The use of darkspecialty malts in the grist proved to have a significant impact on thecolour and the presence of flavour components in the sweet wort. Boiling, however, resulted in an increase of the wort colour and the TBA value, which depended on the used dark specialty malt type. Although a part of the flavour components present in the sweet wort evaporated during boiling, pyrazines proved to be present in a considerable amount in the boiled wort. Branched- 2 -alkenals, however, evaporated almost completely outof the wort, whereas β-damascenone accumulated. If unaltered during fermentation, these components can possibly contribute to the global beer flavour. In a last chapter, the influence of dark specialty malts on the beer flavour stability was studied. On the one hand, these results indicated no significant difference in global appreciation betweenboth fresh beers. On the other hand, a cocoa, caramel flavour was ascribed to the fresh caramel malt beer, whereas marzipan, bread-like flavours characterised the colour malt beer. After thermally forced ageing, caramel and fruity flavours decreased, whereas cardboard and ribes notes increased. The analytical results showed that the concentration of severalknown staling markers increased during ageing. However, few of these components were likely to contribute to the global flavour due to their high flavour thresholds. In conclusion, this work provides new insights in the presence of flavour components in different types of dark specialty malts and the development of these compounds together with some important malt characteristics during the production process of caramel malts. Finally, a light was shed on the behaviour of dark specialty malts during the brewing process and their influence on the flavour stability of beer.
