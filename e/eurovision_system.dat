Countries which have this status also pay an annual fee to maintain this status.

50|$|Every judge {{scales the}} {{competitors}} from 2 to 12 (excluding 11, so called <b>Eurovision</b> <b>System),</b> with each competitor {{in a different}} position of the scale. The competitor every judge considers as {{the best of the}} week will be in the position with 12 points, while the worst will be in the position with 2 points. Then, the contestants count with 5 points to give to their fellow competitor. The total score of each contestant is then counted by summing the points from judges and the others competitors' votes.|$|E

5000|$|The free-language rule {{applied in}} 1975, so prior to the contest the song was {{translated}} into English as [...] "Ding-A-Dong" [...] and performed in English at the final. On {{the night of the}} final Teach-In performed first in the running order, preceding Ireland. 1975 saw the introduction of the current <b>Eurovision</b> scoring <b>system,</b> and [...] "Ding-A-Dong" [...] received six maximum 12 points votes from Israel, Malta, Norway, Spain, Sweden and the United Kingdom. At the close of voting it had received 152 points in total (with points from every other participating country), winning the contest by a 14-point margin over runners-up the United Kingdom. This was the Netherlands' fourth (and to date last) Eurovision victory. The Dutch jury awarded its 12 points to Luxembourg.|$|R
40|$|In {{this study}} we are {{investigating}} if geographical and cultural neighborhood has {{a significant impact on}} success of a song in a well-known popular song contest, Eurovision Song Contest, held every year in European countries since 1956. It has been observed that tendency to logrolling between countries has increased especially after the changing of the voting <b>system</b> of the <b>Eurovision</b> from jury <b>system</b> to the tele-voting system, allowing the public to select their favorite candidates via the internet or telephone. According to our findings, both geographical and cultural neighborhoods are statistically significant determinants of success of a song in the ESC...|$|R

"Ding-a-dong" [...] was {{notable for}} {{being one of}} the Eurovision winners that had quirky or entirely {{nonsensical}} titles or lyrics, {{following in the footsteps of}} Massiel's [...] "La La La" [...] in 1968 and Lulu's [...] "Boom Bang-a-Bang" [...] in 1969, later followed by the Herreys' [...] "Diggi-Loo Diggi-Ley" [...] in 1984. [...] "Ding-a-dong" [...] was performed first on the performance night (preceding Ireland's The Swarbriggs with [...] "That's What Friends Are For"). The song was the first winner under the now-familiar <b>Eurovision</b> voting <b>system</b> whereby each country awards scores of 1-8, 10 and 12. At the close of voting, it had received 152 points, placing first in a field of nineteen. As the first song performed during the evening, the victory ran contrary to the fact that success usually went to songs performed later in the broadcast. According to author and historian John Kennedy O'Connor's The Eurovision Song Contest - The Official History, this was the first of three occasions when the first song would win the contest, the second coming the following year in 1976, and the third in 1984.|$|R

The system is {{evaluated}} by multilingual users for two search tasks {{with the system}} configured in English and five other languages. To our knowledge {{this is the first}} published set of user experiments for CL image retrieval. We show that: (1) it is possible to create a usable multilingual search engine using little knowledge of any language other than English, (2) categorizing images assists the user's search, and (3) there are differences in the way users search between the proposed search tasks. Based on the two search tasks and user feedback, we describe important aspects of any CL image retrieval system...|$|R

User Experiments with the Eurovision Cross-Language Image Retrieval System A great deal of research is currently being conducted in the field of Cross Language Information Retrieval (CLIR), where documents written in one language (referred to as the target language), are retrieved by a query written in another language (referred to as the source language). Most work up to now has concentrated on locating or creating translation resources and methods that automatically transform a user’s query into the language of the documents. Additiona...|$|R
50|$|Television was {{introduced}} in Western Europe in the early 1950s but came late to most Nordic countries. Denmark started regular broadcasts in 1954, Sweden in 1956, Finland in 1957, while Norway did not begin until 1960. Sweden, Finland and Norway have a large territory but a relatively small population, and {{one reason for the}} late introduction of television was related to the feasibility a transmitter system that would provide {{the majority of the population}} with access. Moreover, the government policy for example in Sweden concentrated efforts and financial resources on the construction of a network of stations rather than on increasing programming hours. Thus, a regional programme exchange was also seen as a solution to programme supply, particularly in categories with high productions costs, such as entertainment and drama. In this context, television was seen as having a potential to make a major contribution towards developing and fostering Nordic cooperation. Whilst the more extensive European exchange <b>system</b> <b>Eurovision</b> already existed since 1955, the programming it provided was focused on sports, news and cultural events, due to the technological constraints posed by live transmissions and language differences as it would not have been possible to provide subtitles. Mainly because of the late start of television in Norway, Nordvision began later than its wider European counterpart. Denmark and Sweden had begun cooperating in TV production as early as the summer of 1958, but the official start of the Nordic exchange did not take place until October 1959.|$|R
