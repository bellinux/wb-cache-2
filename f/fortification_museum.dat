5000|$|In {{the late}} 1960s, the {{construction}} of the war memorial complex [...] "Brest Hero Fortress" [...] was started. The complex was opened on September 25, 1971. The memorial complex is a national place of grief and pride, a popular tourist attraction. It comprises the barracks, gunpowder bunkers, forts and other <b>fortifications,</b> the <b>museum</b> of the defence, located {{on the site of the}} old fortress, along with the new monumental structures: the Main Entrance, the Obelisk, the Main Monument, the sculpture [...] "Thirst".|$|R
40|$|The {{objection}} of {{my study}} was to determine the amount of involvement of professional historians and amateurs in researching the Czechoslovakia pre-world war fortifications between 1948 and 1989 and afterwards. (the members of the Prague military history club) The conditions for research and publishing have been different through the years. For ideological reasons could professional historians not be interested in the fortifications before 1989. It would have been considered as reminding the public of the so - called First Republic (1918 - 1939) and glorifying its military. In 1970 's the fortifications became an object of interest for certain enthusiasts who then formed the Prague military history club (PMHC). This club was able to publish materials about the fortifications only after 1989. Research in the official military archives had been limited until then, but in 1980 's it was becoming easier. During the socialist era there have been certain individuals who became interested in the fortifications because of their profession and they were gathering information about them. Those individuals have had influence on the PMHC members. Even before 1989 there were <b>fortification</b> <b>museums</b> (for example in Dobrošov) and some fortifications had been declared cultural herritage sites. The PMHC role in [...] ...|$|R

50|$|Louis Zimmer (8 September 1888 - 12 December 1970) was an {{astronomer}} and clockmaker to the King of Belgium. Most notably in 1930 he built the Jubilee (or Centenary) Clock, which is {{displayed on the}} front of the Zimmer tower. The Zimmer tower (Zimmertoren) is a tower in Lier, Belgium, also known as the Cornelius tower, that was originally a keep of Lier's fourteenth century city <b>fortifications.</b> In the <b>museum</b> near the tower in addition to many of Zimmer's other clock is the huge clock he constructed for the 1935 Brussels International Exposition. This is the clock was sent to the United States for the 1939 New York World's Fair. In June 1970 he was proclaimed Honorary Citizen of Lier. The asteroid Zimmer (№ 3064)(1984 BB1), was named after him in 1984.|$|R
40|$|The {{facilitation}} of visitation to {{a pilgrimage}} site {{is essentially a}} marketing function. In this study the symbolic consumption of heritage tourism is considered from a marketing perspective. A pilot qualitative study was conducted by the authors of key memorial sites in the Normandy D-Day landing region of France. The area in question comprises cemeteries, <b>museums,</b> <b>fortifications,</b> plinths, memorials, landing beaches and battle areas of key historical significance. These key significant sites concentrate tourist visitation to the area. Using a seminal consumer behaviour model, namely Holt’s (1995) typology of consumption the experiences of visitors were compiled, compared and interpreted using ethnographic methods favoured by current notable consumer behaviour scholars (Belk, Hirschman, O’Guinn, Wallendorf, et al). The result confirms the a priori hypothesis that all four metaphors; Experience, Integration, Classification and Play are both relevant and useful in gaining a richer insight of the activity of pilgrimage tourism. This corollary outcome for those involved {{is the opportunity to}} satisfy more needs, more efficiently, and for ‘customers’ to appreciate a richer experience...|$|R
40|$|Recently, in the Cuban {{capital of}} Havana, {{a number of}} fortresses were given away by the Army for {{refurbishment}} and conversion to public functions. In the last two decades, there have been examples of refurbishment and conversions of <b>fortifications</b> in <b>museums,</b> some of them with dire consequences for the collections and the structures. In this type of structure every architectonical element has historic value and very few interventions are allowed. However, the accommodation of modern functions and {{the preservation of the}} structure heavily rely upon the balance between various environmental parameters of the interior spaces. This study explores the challenges and opportunities of an environmentally driven conservation approach to the refurbishment of one of Havana’s most iconic XVIII century’s defensive structures, Santo Domingo of Atares Castle. The paper illustrates the development of an architectural proposal for the conversion of the castle into a museum and associated energy and environmental strategies. The museum function is particularly demanding due to the rigorous standards for the preservation of the collections, generally accomplished by mechanical equipment. Recently, however, there has been a major concern in the conservation scene about energy consumption and sustainable practices in this type of buildings. Therefore, the work identifyies the characteristics of the existing climatic and environmental conditions affecting the interior spaces of the thermally heavyweight fortress. This has led to an analysis of the requirements of the collection in a hot-humid climate in conjunction with the parameters for human comfort, in order to identify to what extent the original conditions can be passively modified to adapt the building to the conversion. Finally, with the help of computational dynamic simulations, passive strategies and zoning options were tested for the achievement of suitable interior environmental conditions and subsequent energy savings...|$|R
500|$|As {{of early}} 2007, only the Ninth Fort had been partly renovated. It is now {{devoted to the}} Holocaust and Lithuania's occupations by the Nazis and the Soviets. The museum, which holds over 65,000 artefacts, is {{sponsored}} by the Lithuanian Ministry of Culture. [...] Since the early 2000s, it has received about 100,000 visitors per year and hosted Holocaust education seminars and workshops. In 2005, the international project [...] "Baltic Culture and Tourism Route Fortresses" [...] was launched, with support from the European Union. Its goal is the promotion of transnational scientific cooperation in monument protection, along with the creation of strategies to reconstruct and manage fortresses in the region. Kaunas Fortress is a part of this project. In 2007, Seventh fort was sold, new owners started the restoration process, since 2009 Seventh fort is open as a <b>fortification</b> and military <b>museum</b> and is the only brick fort in Kaunas suitable for safe visiting. [...] In the 2000s, a variety of entities owned parts of the complex: the Ministry of Culture, the Ministry of Defence, the State Property Fund, and the City of Kaunas. The site still contains unexploded ordnance, although a 1995 project removed about 1.9 tonnes of explosives. Other restoration issues include uncovered wells, poor drainage and ventilation, erosion, possible chemical contaminants, vegetative overgrowth, and the presence of a protected bat colony. Despite the damage that it has sustained, the Kaunas Fortress complex is the most complete of the surviving Russian Empire fortresses.|$|R
5000|$|In 1958, the Ninth Fort was {{dedicated}} as a museum. During 1959, its first exhibition was opened, memorializing the crimes {{that had taken}} place there. The museum later expanded its scope to cover the fortress' entire history. A 32 m tall memorial to the victims was constructed there in 1984. However, the Soviet military occupied most of the fortress until Lithuania re-established its independence. After the withdrawal of Soviet forces, completed in 1993, Lithuanian military bases were established at several forts. As of early 2007, only the Ninth Fort had been partly renovated.
