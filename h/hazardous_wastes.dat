BP paid the maximum $500,000 in criminal fines, $6.5million in civil penalties, and established a $15million environmental management system at all of BP facilities in the US and Gulf of Mexico that are engaged in oil exploration, drilling or production. The charges stemmed from the 1993 to 1995 dumping of <b>hazardous</b> <b>wastes</b> on Endicott Island, Alaska by BP's contractor Doyon Drilling. The firm illegally discharged waste oil, paint thinner and other toxic and hazardous substances by injecting them down the outer rim, or annuli, of the oil wells.

40|$|During {{past years}} a great {{attention}} is paid to the problem of <b>hazardous</b> <b>waste</b> management. “Prevention costs” of the activities concerned with <b>hazardous</b> <b>waste</b> are lower than “restoration costs” after damage is done. A proper management strategy for <b>hazardous</b> <b>waste</b> is one of key components for a sustainable development. The quantity of various flows for <b>hazardous</b> <b>waste</b> should be identified before a precise management strategy for <b>hazardous</b> <b>waste</b> can be developed. Until now there is not one unique way how countries within the European Union should report on the yearly amount of <b>hazardous</b> <b>waste.</b> Within the scope of the paper the methodology for quantification of <b>hazardous</b> <b>waste</b> flows was elaborated. The proposed methodology was applied for the case study of the Baltic States: Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania. Objectives for the paper included: analysis of statistical data on amount of <b>hazardous</b> <b>waste</b> in the Baltic States, identification of statistically significant independent variables, which describe the <b>hazardous</b> <b>waste</b> flows at 95 % confidence level, combination of statistical data analysis with evaluation of main indicators in order to propose the methodology for quantification of <b>hazardous</b> <b>waste</b> flows. The multiple regression analysis was carried out in order to identify the strength of correlation between amount of <b>hazardous</b> <b>waste</b> and defined independent variables. Based on the data analysis and literature reviews, the main indicators for the <b>hazardous</b> <b>waste</b> flows were identified. By combining findings of the multiple regression analysis of statistical data and stated indicators, the methodology for quantification of <b>hazardous</b> <b>waste</b> flows was elaborated. Amount of <b>hazardous</b> <b>waste</b> is slowly, but steadily growing in the Baltic States. Since there is not common methodology in the European Union for the quantification of <b>hazardous</b> <b>waste</b> flows, various data sources shown different amount of generated <b>hazardous</b> <b>waste</b> on the yearly basis in the Baltic States. The multiple regression equation, which describes statistical data at 95 % confidence level, was obtained. The equation includes 5 statistically significant independent variables. The equation can be used for the forecasts of amount of <b>hazardous</b> <b>waste</b> in the Baltic States. The proposed methodology for the quantification of <b>hazardous</b> <b>waste</b> flows is based on unique solution, which combines study of main indicators with the use of multiple regression equation...|$|R
