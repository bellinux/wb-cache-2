5000|$|Central {{government}} instructed {{local authorities}} {{to draw up}} plans to convert all schools to the comprehensive model {{in the form of}} two Circulars, 11/66 and 10/68. Some local authorities were determined to retain grammar schools. A handful of counties and local authorities in England have largely intact selective schools systems, including Kent, Medway, Buckinghamshire and Lincolnshire, while others such as Gloucestershire, Trafford and Slough have a mix. Kent simply planned to run a pilot scheme with four <b>full</b> <b>comprehensives</b> - and wait for the results. The circulars were withdrawn by another circular 4/79 issued by Education secretary Thatcher in 1979. Elsewhere few grammar schools survived in fully comprehensive areas, such as Birmingham and Bournemouth.|$|R

50|$|Much {{ingenuity}} {{had gone}} into extending and converting the building to provide the additional classrooms and specialist accommodation required by the post-war grammar school's large sixth form. However, the school's relatively small size meant {{that it was not}} capable of becoming either an independent, or a <b>full</b> <b>comprehensive</b> school, at the point when the state withdrew funding from direct grant grammar schools. An option of the school going independent was discussed. In March 1977, a group of parents tried to get a High Court injunction to stop the governors changing its grammar school status, organised by Dudley Stanley Fox.|$|E

On 2 April the talks ended and a joint press conference was held by Federica Mogherini (High Representative of the Union for Foreign Affairs) and Mohammad Javad Zarif (Minister of Foreign Affairs of Iran) to announce that the eight nations had reached an agreement on a framework deal for Iran nuclear activities.

5000|$|The total public cost of {{the plan}} would be $90 - $120 billion per year, paid for by {{eliminating}} the 2001 tax cuts for individuals earning more than $200,000 per year. [...] Employers {{would be required to}} either cover their employees or to pay a payroll tax that will be used to partially fund regional health insurance pools (called [...] "Health Markets") that are overseen by the federal government. Individuals who are not covered by their employers or by an expanded Medicaid program (covering individuals and families with incomes up to 250% of the poverty level) or Medicare will be required to purchase insurance from these Health Markets. Insurance companies must compete to win the right {{to be one of the}} providers in these Health Markets and must provide <b>full</b> <b>comprehensive</b> care (including mental health parity). In addition, one of the insurance plans will be directly provided by the federal government (similar to, but separate from Medicare). If a majority of individuals choose to purchase their insurance from the government plan, Edwards has stated that this could eventually lead to a single-payer health care system. In addition, there will also be a broad subsidy for those individuals who have to purchase insurance on their own. The subsidy is given on a sliding scale to individuals and families making up to roughly $100,000 per year (this is a significantly larger subsidy than is provided in the Massachusetts health care plan, another mandated insurance program).|$|E
