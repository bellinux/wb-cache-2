5|$|As the {{atmosphere}} is transparent for radio waves, radio telescopes in space are of most use <b>for</b> <b>Very</b> <b>Long</b> Baseline Interferometry; doing simultaneous observations of a source with both a satellite and a ground-based telescope and by correlating their signals to simulate a radio telescope {{the size of the}} separation between the two telescopes. Observations can be of supernova remnants, masers, gravitational lenses, starburst galaxies, and many other things.|$|E

Later, another Pokémon, Entei is able to break the bond between the two by removing the DNA in Blaine's arm, at which point Mewtwo leaves. It eventually helps the main character of the series, Red, fight against Team Rocket leader Giovanni and his Deoxys.|$|E

5|$|Everyone in {{the office}} grows anxious as the premiere of the PBS TV {{documentary}} The Office: An American Workplace draws near. Andy Bernard (Ed Helms) combines an unflattering appraisal of himself from an early newspaper {{of the program and}} his blunt self-assessment that he is unlikely to remain employed at Dunder Mifflin <b>for</b> <b>very</b> <b>long</b> after it airs, and decides it is time to pursue his dreams of stardom. After many fruitless calls to dismissive talent agencies, he finds himself at the dual talent agency/real estate office run by Carla Fern (Roseanne Barr). Carla agrees to represent Andy, who is thrilled that he only has to pay $5,000 for the privilege.|$|E
5|$|From a {{strategic}} point of view, by defending Thermopylae, the Greeks {{were making the}} best possible use of their forces. As {{long as they could}} prevent a further Persian advance into Greece, they had no need to seek a decisive battle and could, thus, remain on the defensive. Moreover, by defending two constricted passages (Thermopylae and Artemisium), the Greeks' inferior numbers became less of a factor. Conversely, for the Persians the problem of supplying such a large army meant they could not remain in the same place <b>for</b> <b>very</b> <b>long.</b> The Persians, therefore, had to retreat or advance, and advancing required forcing the pass of Thermopylae.|$|E

5|$|In prokaryotes, {{transcription}} {{occurs in}} the cytoplasm; <b>for</b> <b>very</b> <b>long</b> transcripts, translation may begin at the 5'end of the RNA while the 3'end is still being transcribed. In eukaryotes, transcription {{occurs in the}} nucleus, where the cell's DNA is stored. The RNA molecule produced by the polymerase {{is known as the}} primary transcript and undergoes post-transcriptional modifications before being exported to the cytoplasm for translation. One of the modifications performed is the splicing of introns which are sequences in the transcribed region that do not encode protein. Alternative splicing mechanisms can result in mature transcripts from the same gene having different sequences and thus coding for different proteins. This is a major form of regulation in eukaryotic cells and also occurs in some prokaryotes.|$|E
5|$|Two aircraft, each towing one glider, left Scotland on {{the night}} of 19 November 1942. All managed to reach the Norwegian coast, but none were able to reach their objective. The first pair {{suffered}} from navigational difficulties and severe weather, which resulted in the tow rope snapping and the first glider crash-landing, with its towing aircraft returning to base; eight airborne troops were killed outright, four were severely injured and five unhurt. The survivors were captured shortly after the crash. The second pair fared even worse, with both aircraft and glider crashing into a mountain for unknown reasons; the aircrew and several men were killed outright, and those who survived were taken prisoner. None of the prisoners survived <b>for</b> <b>very</b> <b>long,</b> being either poisoned or executed as a result of Adolf Hitler's Commando Order, which stated that all British Commandos personnel were to be killed immediately when captured.|$|E

5|$|Cleveland {{entered the}} White House as a bachelor, {{and his sister}} Rose Cleveland joined him, to act as hostess {{for the first two}} years of his administration. However, unlike the {{previous}} bachelor president James Buchanan, Cleveland did not remain a bachelor <b>for</b> <b>very</b> <b>long.</b> In 1885 the daughter of Cleveland's friend Oscar Folsom visited him in Washington. Frances Folsom was a student at Wells College. When she returned to school, President Cleveland received her mother's permission to correspond with her, and they were soon engaged to be married. On June 2, 1886, Cleveland married Frances Folsom in the Blue Room at the White House. He was the second President to wed while in office, and has been the only President married in the White House. This marriage was unusual, since Cleveland was the executor of Oscar Folsom's estate and had supervised Frances's upbringing after her father's death; nevertheless, the public took no exception to the match. At 21 years, Frances Folsom Cleveland was the youngest First Lady in history, and the public soon warmed to her beauty and warm personality.|$|E
5|$|Italy had {{declared}} neutrality {{at the start}} of World War I, but by July 1915, the Triple Entente had convinced the Italians to enter the war against the Central Powers. Admiral Paolo Thaon di Revel, the Italian naval chief of staff, believed that the threat from Austro-Hungarian submarines and naval mines in the narrow waters of the Adriatic was too serious for him to use the fleet in an active way. Instead, Revel decided to implement a blockade at the relatively safer southern end of the Adriatic with the main fleet, while smaller vessels, such as the MAS boats, conducted raids on Austro-Hungarian ships and installations. She continued to serve as a minelayer during the war in support of Revel's strategy. She was officially reclassified as a minelayer on 1 July 1921, though she did not remain in service <b>for</b> <b>very</b> <b>long,</b> being stricken from the naval register on 4 March 1923 and thereafter broken up for scrap. At the time of her disposal, Tripoli was the last torpedo cruiser still in the Italian fleet's inventory, surpassing even the , which had been built fifteen years after Tripoli entered service.|$|E
