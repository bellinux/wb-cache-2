5|$|Despite not {{charting}} in Billboard magazine, {{the video}} reached the Top 10 for four consecutive weeks on Terra Networks' Top Music Video countdown. In the music video for the song, Queen is video taped showing sensual scenes by several cameras from different angles. Scenes alternate between a dance <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>darkened</b> room and Queen {{is a record}} studio and the cameras. She is surrounded by multiple computers and flat screen television sets which display the feeds from the cameras.|$|E
5|$|The {{locations}} in the film are separated visually from the shots of Madonna, who is singing <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>darkened</b> studio. Unlike her previous videos, Madonna portrays a narrator, whose song comments on the story, appearing in shots completely different from the narrative action. She appears {{to speak for the}} character, addressing his problems directly, like the chorus of a classical tragedy.|$|E
5|$|Two one-sheet posters for {{the film}} were {{released}} in August 2007, one showing the three masked Strangers, and the other displaying a wounded Liv Tyler. In April 2008, roughly {{two months before the}} film's official theatrical debut, the final, official one-sheet {{for the film}} was released, featuring Liv Tyler standing <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>darkened</b> kitchen with a masked man looming behind her in the shadows.|$|E
5000|$|The {{plot was}} {{apparently}} {{inspired by the}} front page Examiner news story from November 14, 1888 which described [...] "an improbable duel with bowie knives <b>in</b> <b>a</b> suitably <b>darkened</b> room".|$|R
50|$|All {{types of}} {{polarization}} will result <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>darkening</b> of the displayed image and poorer contrast compared to non-3D images. Light from lamps is normally emitted as a random collection of polarizations, while a polarization filter only passes {{a fraction of}} the light. As a result, the screen image is darker. This darkening can be compensated by increasing the brightness of the projector light source. If the initial polarization filter is inserted between the lamp and the image generation element, the light intensity striking the image element is not any higher than normal without the polarizing filter, and overall image contrast transmitted to the screen is not affected.|$|R
40|$|Tanning is the skin’s {{response}} to ultraviolet * (UV) radiation, {{a type of}} light exposure. As skin cells are exposed to UV radiation, they produce brown pigment {{to protect themselves from}} further UV exposure. This results <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>darkening</b> of the skin (tanning), which is the body’s natural defense mechanism and attempt to prevent further damage from UV radiation. Sunlight and artificial tanning methods, such as tanning booths or salons, are sources of UV exposure. Sufficient amounts of UV exposure are known to cause adverse health effects in humans and are a public health concern. *Words in italics are defined in the Glossary on page 3...|$|R
5|$|Davis's renewed {{service in}} the Senate was {{interrupted}} in early 1858 by an illness that began as a severe cold and which threatened him {{with the loss of}} his left eye. He was forced to remain <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>darkened</b> room for four weeks. He spent the summer of 1858 in Portland, Maine. On the Fourth of July, Davis delivered an anti-secessionist speech on board a ship near Boston. He again urged the preservation of the Union on October 11 in Faneuil Hall, Boston, and returned to the Senate soon after.|$|E
5|$|The song's video {{features}} close-up {{shots of}} Beyoncé and incorporates psychedelic light effects and symmetrical filming photography. As the acoustic guitar begins playing, Beyoncé's face comes into view. She stands with {{her blond hair}} draped just below her exposed shoulders. As she intently stares into the camera, her skin glistens as though it has been coated with a honey-like and glittery substance. Turning her head from right to left, with her eyes fixed off-camera, Beyoncé starts belting out the first verse. As the chorus is reached, scenes of Beyoncé <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>darkened</b> room are shown. Additionally, she places her face delicately against dripping water, gently brushing it with her lips and palms. The scenery changes and Beyoncé {{is back in the}} darkened chamber, where she removes her dress.|$|E
5|$|The video {{consists}} of multiple scenes with Carey and (now husband) Cannon, who plays her love interest. This is shown along with various behind-the-scenes footage of Carey at various promotional {{events in the}} United Kingdom. The video begins with grainy footage of a plane landing in the Bahamas, with Carey and Cannon exiting the aircraft with her dog. Throughout the video, scenes of Carey laying on a sofa, writing lyrics and tearing, {{as well as the}} singer <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>darkened</b> stage are shown. Several behind-the-scenes clips of Carey promoting the album in the United Kingdom are shown, as she arrives at a CD signing, and connects with fans. Following the signing, Carey is shown at a fashion show, as well as modelling in several outfits. Other scenes that intermingle are of Carey looking out of her hotel suite window in London, as well as candles being put out. During the second verse, the couple is seen spending time together on the island, spending time with friends at a small gathering at the pool, as well as moments of Carey modeling for her bikini photo shoot for the June issue of Vibe. The video's final segment is of Carey performing the song at a concert in a large theatre, while several photos are sporadically shown. Photographs of several of Carey's deceased friends and family members are shown, including her dog, Jack, her father Alfred Roy, her grandmother, David Cole, Luciano Pavarotti, Ol' Dirty Bastard, and Luther Vandross, all of whom Carey had collaborated with during her career. Critics complimented the inclusion of the photos with both Pavarotti and Vandross, and considered it Carey's way of honoring them. The music video peaked at #4 on Billboard's Hot Videoclip Tracks chart.|$|E

60|$|On {{the second}} {{morning after the}} accident, Herbert, lying stiffly swathed in bandages, opened his eyes <b>in</b> <b>a</b> partly <b>darkened</b> room. <b>A</b> nurse was {{standing}} near a table, and when the injured man painfully turned his head, the doctor, who had been speaking to her, came toward him.|$|R
25|$|In his 1637 book Dioptrique French philosopher, {{mathematician}} and scientist René Descartes suggested placing an eye of {{a recently}} dead man (or if a dead man was unavailable, the {{eye of a}}n ox) into an opening <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>darkened</b> room and scraping away the flesh at the back until one could see the inverted image formed on the retina.|$|E
25|$|Research {{by several}} {{investigators}} {{around the world}} has uncovered how ancient peoples encountered and used the camera obscura principle {{for a variety of}} purposes. <b>In</b> <b>a</b> <b>darkened</b> chamber, light passing through a small opening can create haunting and ephemeral moving images, which could have triggered and reinforced ground breaking modes of thought, forms of representation, and belief in otherworldly realms.|$|E

Now, at 4 AM, Mickey is lying <b>in</b> <b>a</b> rainy, <b>darken</b> alley, having <b>a</b> severe heart attack.|$|R
50|$|Polarized light {{reflected}} from {{an ordinary}} motion picture screen typically loses {{most of its}} polarization. So an expensive silver screen or aluminized screen with negligible polarization loss has to be used. All types of polarization will result <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>darkening</b> of the displayed image and poorer contrast compared to non-3D images. Light from lamps is normally emitted as a random collection of polarizations, while a polarization filter only passes {{a fraction of the}} light. As a result, the screen image is darker. This darkening can be compensated by increasing the brightness of the projector light source.

25|$|While, as {{with any}} sort of folklore, the details may vary, this {{particular}} tale (Bloody Mary) encouraged young women to walk {{up a flight of}} stairs backwards, holding a candle and a hand mirror, <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>darkened</b> house. As they gazed into the mirror, {{they were supposed to be}} able to catch a view of their future husband's face. There was, however, a chance that they would see the skull-face of the Grim Reaper instead; this meant that they were destined to die before they married.|$|E
25|$|Perry {{remained}} {{outside the}} secure room lying in wait, knife in hand, {{for a visit}} from the pirates who were trying to locate the missing crew members in order to gain control of the ship and presumably sail it to Somalia. Perry tackled the ringleader of the pirates and took him prisoner after a cat-and-mouse chase <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>darkened</b> engine room. Pirate ringleader Abduwali Muse cut his hand trying to keep Perry's knife away from his neck. The pirate was then tied up and his wounds were treated by Second Mate Ken Quinn.|$|E
25|$|According to news {{accounts}} from around that time, the assassination {{was carried out}} in a backroom of the Yanceyville courthouse. Stephens was in attendance at a Democratic gathering, in an attempt to convince a prominent Democrat to run for Sheriff as a Republican. The man he was attempting to sway signaled to him from the floor of the hall, and Stephens followed him downstairs. Knowing Stephens' reputation for being quite well armed, his Klan assassins had assembled between eight and twelve men who lay in wait <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>darkened</b> room on the Caswell County Courthouse's first floor.|$|E
50|$|There was a {{fine arts}} hall which {{included}} canvas and glass paintings, sculpture and Irish antiquities. Work on display included items by sculptures Thomas Kirk, John Edward Jones, Patrick MacDowell, Joseph Robinson Kirk and John Henry Foley. John Hogan had works both in the main art section, but additionally his The Dead Christ was <b>in</b> <b>a</b> separate <b>darkened</b> room.|$|R
5000|$|<b>In</b> <b>a</b> {{foreword}} to {{the biography}} of Ahmed Timol, brutally murdered in police custody in October 1971, former president Thabo Mbeki describes the high water mark of the apartheid era, the lowest ebb in {{the fortunes of the}} oppressed and the turning tide against apartheid forces in the 1970s as follows:“He was himself the light <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>darkening</b> room… The apartheid regime had banned us earlier and had brutally set out to break and torture our scattered comrades. They believed that they had broken the back of the underground. And then they found Ahmed. Mayibuye! They performed upon his body… a danse macabre of exorcism through violence. It was their own neurosis that spoke through every blow, because in him our revolutionary spirit was made flesh and they simply could not believe it. He was and remained, even after his death, the spectre that was haunting South Africa.” ...|$|R

25|$|Visual {{feedback}} {{has also}} been studied in relation to visual extinction. Patients were asked to touch a known target <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>darkened</b> room. A light attached to the patient’s hand was sometimes briefly illuminated, {{to provide information about}} where the hand was in relation to the target. In some of these trials, a distracting light was also lit, which induced an extinction event in the patient. Although the patient reported in such cases that he had not seen the indicator light on his hand, their performance was correspondingly better, similar to the results when visual feedback had been available. Although the patient was not cognizant of having received the information, they were able to correctly act upon it, {{in a manner similar to}} blindsight.|$|E
25|$|Upton {{was born}} on a farm near Batavia, New York, the tenth child and sixth son of Daniel and Electra Randall Upton. He would become the {{brother-in-law}} of Andrew J. Alexander and of Frank P. Blair, Jr. He studied under famous evangelist Charles G. Finney at Oberlin College {{for two years before}} being admitted to the United States Military Academy at West Point in 1856. While at West Point Upton fought a duel with fellow Cadet Wade Hampton Gibbes of South Carolina over some offensive remarks about Upton's alleged relationships with African-American girls at Oberlin College. The two men fought with swords <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>darkened</b> room of the cadet barracks. Upton suffered a cut on his face. He graduated eighth in his class of 45 cadets on May 6, 1861, {{just in time for the}} outbreak of the Civil War.|$|E
25|$|In 1887, Heinrich Hertz {{observed}} the photoelectric effect {{and the production}} and reception of electromagnetic waves. He published these observations in the journal Annalen der Physik. His receiver consisted of a coil with a spark gap, where a spark would be seen upon detection of electromagnetic waves. He placed the apparatus <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>darkened</b> box to see the spark better. However, {{he noticed that the}} maximum spark length was reduced when in the box. A glass panel placed between the source of electromagnetic waves and the receiver absorbed ultraviolet radiation that assisted the electrons in jumping across the gap. When removed, the spark length would increase. He observed no decrease in spark length when he replaced glass with quartz, as quartz does not absorb UV radiation. Hertz concluded his months of investigation and reported the results obtained. He did not further pursue investigation of this effect.|$|E

40|$|In {{the phantom}} {{illumination}} illusion, luminance ramps ranging from black to white induce a brightness enhancement on an otherwise homogeneous dark background. The {{strength of the}} illusion was tested {{with regard to the}} extension of the brightness inducing perimeter, surrounding the target area by manip-ulating the number of inducers (exp. 1) {{and the size of the}} inducers (exp. 2). Participants’ task was to rate the difference in brightness between the target area and the background. Results show that the illusion occurs only when the target area is not completely segregated from the background by luminance ramps; vice versa, when the target area is delimited by a continuous gradient, it appears darker than the back- ground. These findings suggest a major role of figure-ground organization in the appearance of the illu- sion. This hypothesis was tested <b>in</b> <b>a</b> rating task experiment with three types of target area shapes circumscribed by four types of edges: luminance contours, illusory contours, no contours, and ambiguous contours. Illusory contours, just as luminance contours, hinder the illusion and produce <b>a</b> <b>darkening</b> of the target area. A control experiment measured the brightness of the previous stimuli without luminance ramps: all configurations resulted <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>darkening</b> of the target area. Results from all experiments suggest that figure-ground segmentation plays <b>a</b> major role <b>in</b> the determination of both illumination and light- ness in stimuli with luminance gradients...|$|R
