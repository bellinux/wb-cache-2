5|$|Cope's {{relations}} with Marsh {{turned into a}} competition for fossils between the two, known today as the Bone Wars. The conflict's seeds began upon the men's return to the United States in the 1860s. Cope introduced his colleague to the marl pit owner Albert Vorhees when the two visited the site. Marsh went behind Cope's back and made a private agreement with Vorhees: any fossils that Vorhees's men found were sent back to Marsh at New Haven. When Marsh was at Haddonfield examining one of Cope's fossil finds—a complete skeleton of a large aquatic plesiosaur, Elasmosaurus, that had four flippers and a long neck—he commented that the fossil's head was on the wrong end, evidently stating that Cope had put the skull {{at the end of}} the vertebrae of the tail. Cope was outraged and the two argued for some time until they agreed to have Leidy examine the bones and determine who was right. Leidy came, picked up the head of the fossil and put it on the other end. Cope was horrified since he had already published a paper on the fossil with the error at the American Philosophical Society. He immediately tried to buy back the copies, but some remained with their buyers (Marsh and Leidy kept theirs). The whole ordeal might have passed <b>easily</b> <b>enough</b> had Leidy not exposed the cover-up at the next society meeting, not to alienate Cope, but only in response to Cope's brief statement where he never admitted he was wrong. Cope and Marsh would never talk to each other amicably again, and by 1873, open hostility had broken out between them.|$|E

He reached his century (111) the next day and Tom Graveney made 59 not out before he declared on 360/8 after the Country XI used 9 bowlers. The locals had to bat 172 minutes for a draw and did this <b>easily</b> <b>enough</b> even after being 19/2 one F. Watts making 63 and the day ending with the 159/4.|$|E

Phipps, who gave the episode a C grade, said, [...] "This wasn’t a terrible half-hour of comedy by any stretch. It drifted by <b>easily</b> <b>enough.</b> But I’m already having to scour my notes to remind myself {{of the stuff that}} was funny." [...] "Canvassing" [...] was first broadcast in Australia on Channel Seven on December 8, 2009, and received a positive review from The Sydney Morning Herald writer Mark Ellis.

500|$|After a stage {{each for}} the {{breakaway}} and the sprinters, during {{which there were}} no major changes to the overall standings, the riders were faced with the very climbing-intensive final two road stages. The [...] team rode a very hard tempo in stage 19 over the Passo del Mortirolo, which eventually whittled that group down to just Basso, Nibali, and Scarponi. They crossed the Mortirolo more than two minutes ahead of Arroyo, which was nearly enough time to make Basso the virtual race leader. Arroyo, noted as a far better descender than Basso, took very aggressive lines coming down the Mortirolo and caught up with Vinokourov, Sastre, Evans, and John Gadret, who had been {{between him and the}} leading trio. Basso's group had only 30 seconds on Arroyo's {{at the start of the}} stage-concluding Aprica climb, but they took more and more time as the climb went on and finished three minutes ahead, giving Basso the pink jersey with two days left to race. Arroyo elected not to try to aggressively descend any of the four large climbs on course in the final road race stage, settling for second place by riding with Basso and the other top riders in the peloton most of the day. There were a few changes in time gaps, but the same riders remained in the top ten from the previous day, as Johan Tschopp won the stage from a breakaway. The individual time trial in Verona which closed out the Giro also provided for small changes to the overall, but Basso's 15th place on the stage was <b>easily</b> <b>enough</b> to make him Giro champion. Arroyo and Nibali rounded out the podium.|$|E
500|$|Evans {{took the}} team's first wins at Tirreno–Adriatico. Despite {{the fact that}} he had raced only two days prior to Tirreno–Adriatico on the 2011 season, as part of a planned light program meant to culminate in victory at the Tour de France, Evans showed fine form at the race of the two seas. He {{finished}} near the front of the race in the first two hilly stages, both of them [...] in length, and took the race lead after the second of them. The next day, he won the stage into Macerata, extending his race lead to nine seconds. With only a very short individual time trial remaining, and the riders directly behind Evans in the overall standings lesser than him in time trial skills, nine seconds was a significant advantage. Evans managed only 12th in the [...] race against the clock that closed out the race, but this was <b>easily</b> <b>enough</b> to preserve his overall victory. In April, Evans won the Tour de Romandie without winning any stage. His greatest time win came in the stage 4 individual time trial. Sitting third at that point, he finished eighth on the day and took sufficient time to overtake Pavel Brutt and Alexander Vinokourov to move into the race lead. The flat final stage provided for no meaningful changes to the overall standings, securing Evans' win. While he did not win anything at the Critérium du Dauphiné, Evans showed strongly at that race as well. While Bradley Wiggins proved by far the strongest of the overall classification ridrs in the stage 3 individual time trial, Evans' sixth place on the day moved him up to second overall. He finished sufficiently near the front of the race on all other days as well, assuring him second place overall in the event.|$|E
500|$|... 2009 saw Sheen portray another public figure; he {{starred in}} The Damned United as the outspoken {{football}} manager Brian Clough. The Tom Hooper-directed film focused on Clough's disastrous 44-day tenure {{as manager of}} Leeds United and marked Sheen's fifth collaboration with writer Peter Morgan. The actor has said Clough is the real-life character he enjoyed playing most. The Guardian, writing in 2009, declared it the [...] "best performance of his big-screen career" [...] while The Times found him [...] "magnificent". USA Today praised [...] "Sheen's masterful performance" [...] while the Los Angeles Times felt he played the role with [...] "a cheeky, dark panache" [...] and [...] "skillful verve". Entertainment Weekly asserted that, despite American audiences' unfamiliarity with Clough, [...] "what's lost in translation is recovered <b>easily</b> <b>enough</b> in Michael Sheen's astonishing performance". Variety noted that his [...] "typically scrupulous channeling of Clough gets the tics and mannerisms right, but also carves a moving portrait of a braggart suddenly out of his depth".

Of his decision to take part, Sheen has said: [...] "My rule of thumb is that I want to do things I'd like to go and see myself."

2500|$|The term crystal {{attached}} to the theory, explained in Grothendieck's letter to Tate (1966), was a metaphor inspired by certain properties of algebraic differential equations.

2500|$|Rawlinson {{argued that}} Christianity could {{not succeed in}} China if it was {{identified}} with either imperialist domination or capitalist exploitation.

The spread of Marxism raised serious questions, however. Rawlinson approved the egalitarian social aims which Chinese communists announced while condemning their violent methods. [...] In 1934, the Chinese Recorder ran a series of articles on [...] "The Challenge of Communism," [...] the title of a missionary conference.
