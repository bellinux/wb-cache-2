40|$|Within the literature, {{there are}} a number of studies {{investigating}} the benefits of <b>exhaust</b> <b>gas</b> <b>recirculation,</b> and as a result it has become established as a promising technology for combustion control to allow engine downsizing technology to be advanced. Aside from the dilution effect of <b>exhaust</b> <b>gas</b> <b>recirculation,</b> some of the components, such as NO, CO, and hydrocarbons, can have significant chemical effects. The literature shows that the component within <b>exhaust</b> <b>gas</b> <b>recirculation</b> which has the largest chemical effect on combustion is NO, which can promote or inhibit the onset of autoignition causing reactions within the end gas at high load. The reduction in NOx <b>gases</b> in catalysed <b>exhaust</b> <b>gas</b> <b>recirculation</b> can increase the knock limit at high load, with some authors reporting up to a 5 ∘ crank angle improvement in combustion phasing. There is conflicting evidence on whether this translates to an improvement in fuel consumption, with one study finding a decrease of up to 2 % comparing to another finding an increase of 1. 5 %- 3. 5 %. Crude calculations on the emissions of a 2. 0 -L direct injection spark ignition engine operating at high load show that in an extreme case the reduction in the calorific value of the inlet charge due to catalysis of the recirculated gases can be up to 4. 5 %. Despite the potential benefits, the literature on catalysed <b>exhaust</b> <b>gas</b> <b>recirculation</b> is fairly limited and the evidence seems so far inconclusive as to whether this technology may have the potential to further enhance the benefits of <b>exhaust</b> <b>gas</b> <b>recirculation.</b> This article uses current literature to ascertain the potential benefits of catalysed <b>exhaust</b> <b>gas</b> <b>recirculation,</b> compare to pre-catalyst <b>exhaust</b> <b>gas</b> <b>recirculation,</b> and investigates its individual components in more detail to explain how chemical interactions can either promote or inhibit ignition depending on their concentration and temperature...|$|R

Biodiesel has been known as an attractive alternative fuel although biodiesel produced from edible oil is very expensive than conventional diesel. Therefore, the uses of biodiesel produced from non-edible oils are much better option. Currently Jatropha biodiesel is receiving attention as an alternative fuel for diesel engine. Previous studies reported that Jatropha biodiesel was found to emit higher nitrogen oxides and lower smoke emissions compared to ordinary diesel. <b>Exhaust</b> <b>gas</b> <b>recirculation</b> is an effective technique to reduce nitrogen oxides emission from diesel engines; because it enables to lower both flame temperature and oxygen concentration in the combustion chamber.

Performance and emissions characteristics of a CI engine fuelled with DTBP blended LPG fuel were examined. Also, the effect of <b>EGR</b> (<b>exhaust</b> <b>gas</b> <b>recirculation)</b> on the combustion and emissions characteristics has been investigated.

Exhaust emissions measurements showed that hydrocarbon were decreased with the blended fuel at enhancing cetane number. Furthermore, the combustion stability of LPG with a cetane number improver was equivalent to that of commercial Diesel fuel. Increasing the EGR rate leads to deteriorate the IMEP (indicated mean effective pressure) and increase the ignition delay.
