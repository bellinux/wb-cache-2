To maintain the integrity of such equipment, the resulting seals have to be stable and hermetic during continuous and cyclic high temperature operation. As a solution for joining metal and ceramic materials, reactive air brazing has gained increasing interest in recent years. This paper compares joints brazed by different filler alloys: pure Ag, AgCu, and AgAl in three different aspects: contour accuracy, room temperature delamination resistance, and corresponding microstructures of the as-brazed and fractured brazed joints.

The system includes a hydrodesulfurizer which reduces the sulfur content {{of commercial and}} military grade diesel fuel to an acceptable level. Hydrogen which has been previously separated from the process stream is mixed with diesel fuel at low pressure. The diesel/hydrogen mixture is then pressurized and introduced into the hydrodesulfurizer. The hydrodesulfurizer comprises a metal oxide such as ZnO which reacts with hydrogen sulfide {{in the presence of}} a metal catalyst to form a metal sulfide and water. After desulfurization, the diesel fuel is reformed and delivered to a <b>hydrogen</b> <b>separator</b> which removes most of the hydrogen from the reformed fuel prior to introduction into a solid oxide fuel cell generator. The separated hydrogen is then selectively delivered to the diesel/hydrogen mixer or to a hydrogen storage unit.

Its task is to condition and monitor the quality of highly pure water which has been produced in two fuel-cell stacks by the oxidation of hydrogen. This water will be used for different cooling elements (e. g. water evaporator, water sublimator) and as potable water for drinking and food purposes. The assembly consists mainly of: - a <b>hydrogen</b> <b>separator,</b> providing for removal of dissolved and gaseous residual hydrogen from the fuel-cell water. The passive method of gettering the hydrogen (H 2) in a palladium (Pd) matrix at ambient temperature has been used. - a monitoring and measurement device, measuring the contaminants concentration of the water by means of an electrical conductivity meter joined with a temperature sensor, placed downstream of the H 2 -separator. - a water disinfection device using iodine. - a gas trap, based on diffusion through a filter, avoiding the blockage of the H 2 separator, and placed upstream of that device. This paper presents the selected design concepts of the main constituents. Based on these concepts breadboard models of the H 2 separator and of the water quality monitoring device are described. The results of several test series, namely for: - functional efficiency - hydraulics - matrix expansion - contamination by KOH - influence of temperature - relation between conductivity and pH value are presented. The conclusions and the analysis for further development work are then explained. Â© Copyright 1993 Society of Automotive Engineers, Inc. SCOPUS: cp. jinfo:eu-repo/semantics/publishe...|$|E
40|$|The overall {{objectives}} {{for this project}} were to: (1) confirm the high stability and resistance of a PdCu trimetallic alloy to carbon and carbide formation and, in addition, resistance to sulfur, halides, and ammonia; (2) develop a sulfur, halide, and ammonia resistant alloy membrane with a projected hydrogen permeance of 25 m{sup 3 }m{sup - 2 }atm{sup - 0. 5 }h{sup - 1 } at 400 C and capable of operating at pressures of 12. 1 MPa ({approx} 120 atm, 1750 psia); and (3) construct and experimentally validate the performance of 0. 1 kg/day H{sup 2 } PdCu trimetallic alloy membrane separators at feed pressures of 2 MPa (290 psia) {{in the presence of}} H{sub 2 }S, NH{sub 3 }, and HCl. This project successfully increased the technology readiness level of palladium-based metallic membranes for hydrogen separation from coal-biomass gasifier exhaust or similar hydrogen-containing gas streams. The reversible tolerance of palladium-copper (PdCu) alloys was demonstrated for H{sub 2 }S concentrations varying from 20 ppmv up to 487 ppmv and NH{sub 3 } concentrations up to 9 ppmv. In addition, atomistic modeling validated the resistance of PdCu alloys to carbon formation, irreversible sulfur corrosion, and chlorine attack. The experimental program highlighted two key issues which must be addressed as part of future experimental programs: (1) tube defects and (2) non-membrane materials of construction. Four out of five FCC PdCu separators developed leaks {{during the course of the}} experimental program because {approx} 10 % of the alloy tubes contained a single defect that resulted in a thin, weak point in the tube walls. These defects limited operation of the existing tubes to less than 220 psig. For commercial applications of a PdCu alloy <b>hydrogen</b> <b>separator</b> under high sulfur concentrations, it was determined that stainless steel 316 is not suitable for housing or supporting the device. Testing with sulfur concentrations of 487 {+-} 4 ppmv resulted in severe corrosion of the stainless steel components of the separators. The project identified an experimental methodology for quantifying the impact of gas contaminants on PdCu alloy membrane performance as well as an atomistic modeling approach to screen metal alloys for their resistance to irreversible sulfur corrosion. Initial mathematical descriptions of the effect of species such as CO and H{sub 2 }S were developed, but require further experimental work to refine. At the end of the project, an improvement to the experimental approach for acquiring the necessary data for the permeability model was demonstrated in preliminary tests on an enhanced PdCu separator. All of the key DOE 2010 technical targets were met or exceeded except for the hydrogen flux. The highest flux observed for the project, 125 ft{sup 3 }ft{sup - 2 }h{sup - 1 }, was obtained on a single tube separator with the aforementioned enhanced PdCu separator with a hydrogen feed pressure of 185 psig at 500 C...|$|E

A significant market potentially exists for PEFCs in certain stationary applications where PEFC technology is a more attractive alternative to other fuel cell technologies. A difficulty with the PEFC is its operation on reformed fuels containing CO, which poisons the anode catalyst. This difficulty can be alleviated in several ways.

40|$|A 50 cell bipolar nickel-hydrogen battery was {{assembled}} {{to demonstrate the}} feasibility of constructing a high voltage stack of cells.

40|$|The main {{objective}} of this project was to construct, test, and demonstrate a Pd-Cu metallic tubular membrane micro-channel separator capable of producing 2 lb day{sup - 1 } H{sub 2 } at Ã¢ÂÂ¥ 95 % recovery when operating downstream of an actual coal gasifier. A key milestone for the project was to complete a pilot-scale gasifier test by 1 September 2011 and demonstrate the separation of 2 lb day{sup - 1 } H{sub 2 } to verify progress toward the DOEÃ¢ÂÂs goals prior to down-selection for larger-scale (Ã¢ÂÂ 100 lb day{sup - 1 }) <b>hydrogen</b> <b>separator</b> development. Three different pilot-scale (Ã¢ÂÂ 1. 5 ft{sup 2 }) separators were evaluated downstream of coal gasifiers during four different tests and the key project milestone was achieved in August 2011, ahead of schedule. During three of those tests, all of the separators demonstrated or exceeded the targeted separation rate of 2 lb day{sup - 1 } H{sub 2 }. The separator design was proved to be leak tight and durable {{in the presence of}} gasifier exhaust contaminants at temperatures and pressures up to 500 ÃÂ°C and 500 psia. The contaminants in the coal gasifier syngas for the most part had negligible impact on separator performance, with H{sub 2 } partial pressure being the greatest determinant of membrane performance. Carbon monoxide and low levels of H{sub 2 }S (100 ppmv) were shown to significantly reduce H{sub 2 } separation performance. The presence of trace metals, including mercury and arsenic, appeared to have no effect based on the experimental data. Subscale Pd-Cu coupon tests further quantified the impact of H{sub 2 }S on irreversible sulfide formation in the UTRC separators. Conditions that have a thermodynamic driving force to form coke were found to reduce the performance of the separators, presumably by blockage of effective separation area with carbon deposits. However, it was demonstrated that both in situ and ex situ (laboratory) air regeneration at 450 ÃÂ°C could restore separator performance by burning out such deposits. Gasifier testing revealed that high molecular weight hydrocarbons have the potential to retard H 2 separation. Unconverted coal tars with carbon numbers greater than 14 have a boiling point such that they can act as a reversible poison to the Pd-Cu membranes even at temperatures above 500 ÃÂ°C. The use of real-time, physics-based, performance models revealed the effect of these coal tars. It is believed that this project provided the first evidence for the impact of coal tars on H{sub 2 } separator performance. Final down-selection of candidate alloys for non-membrane materials of construction proceeded by evaluating the alloys in both UTRC laboratory tests and testing downstream of an actual gasifier at the National Carbon Capture Center (NCCC). The overall alloy ratings were calculated by multiplying the projected cost of a 100 lb day{sup - 1 } H{sub 2 } separator outer shell by the projected oxide scale thickness for 5 years of operation. The alloy with the lowest resulting rating parameter was stainless steel 309 (SS- 309) followed by stainless steel 310 (SS- 310). However, it was noted that approximately half of the alloys showed susceptibility to pitting and localized corrosion. SS- 309 was one of the alloys that exhibited heavy localized attack after 2000 hours of laboratory testing. As this localized corrosion can potentially lead to accelerated end of life, it was determined that SS- 310 would be the best alloy selection for this application as it does not show signs of localized pitting corrosion...|$|E
40|$|Cet article fait le point sur l'Ã©tat de la {{recherche}} dans le domaine des rÃ©acteurs chimiques avec sÃ©paration par membrane intÃ©grÃ©e et de leur applications dans le domaine du raffinage et de la pÃ©trochimie. Trois applications potentiellement intÃ©ressantes sont identifiÃ©es et, pour chacune, les avantages de l'utilisation d'un rÃ©acteur Ã  membrane sont discutÃ©s. Ce sont : la dÃ©shydrogÃ©nation du propane en propylÃ¨ne, la dÃ©shydrogÃ©nation d'un naphtÃ¨ne cyclohexanique et le vaporÃ©formage du gaz naturel. Pour ces rÃ©actions, les membranes Ã  base de palladium apparaissent les plus performantes compte tenu de leur tenue en tempÃ©rature, de leur sÃ©lectivitÃ© et de leur permÃ©abilitÃ© Ã  l'hydrogÃ¨ne. Quelques Ã©lÃ©ments relatifs Ã  leur dÃ©veloppement sont prÃ©sentÃ©s en conclusion. Recently, {{the use of}} membrane {{in reaction}} engineering has been more and more advocated. The selective separation of the products from the reaction mixture allows to achieve higher conversion or better selectivity or to operate under less severe conditions or with smaller units. This paper presents {{an update on the}} recent advances in the field of chemical membrane reactors and on their applications in refining and petrochemistry. Previous work. Most of the possible applications of membrane reactors in petroleum and petrochemical industry concern gaseous catalytic reactions. For this reason, gas permeation membranes are the primary component of membrane reactors. Gas permeation membranes present different types of physical structure : dense, microporous or asymmetric which is a combination of the two. Separating properties of dense membranes are function of the solubility and diffusivity of each gaseous component in the membrane material. For microporous membranes, they follow four mechanisms : Knudsen diffusion, surface diffusion, capillary condensation or molecular sieving. Although organic polymers are the common constituent of gas permeation membrane, their use is very limited in membrane reactors as they cannot withstand temperatures higher than 150 Â°C. Metal, ceramic or glass membrane are preferred. Published work on membrane reactors is mainly concerned with dehydrogenation reactions and the in-situ separation of hydrogen. Dense palladium membranes or microporous inorganic membranes are used. A typical membrane reactor is presented in Fig. 1. The catalyst constitutes a fixed bed in the inside tube where dehydrogenation of cyclohexane into benzene takes place. Hydrogen produced by the reaction, permeates through the palladium wall. Carrier argon is used on the permeate side to lower the partial pressure of hydrogen and therefore increase the permeation rate. The main factors enhancing the equilibrium shift and therefore the conversion are presented in Table 1. Potential applications in the petroleum and petrochemical industry. Three potentially interesting applications are identified and the advantages of using a membrane reactor are discussed. They are : propane dehydrogenation into propylene, cyclohexanic naphthene dehydrogenation and natural gas steam reforming. For these chemical reactions, palladium based membranes show the best performance in terms of temperature resistance, hydrogen selectivity and permeability. The conversion of the dehydrogenation reaction of propane is increased by a higher temperature or a lower pressure as presented in Table 2. Selective draw-off of hydrogen from the reactor through a permeable wall increases the conversion from 48. 6 % to 75. 5 % (Table 3) or decreases the reaction temperature from 600 to 500 Â°C (Table 4). Table 5 presents the effect of the selective draw-off of hydrogen on the conversion or the operating temperature for conditions found in industrial propane dehydrogenation processes. For a specified conversion, the use of a membrane reactor results in a lower operating temperature which reduces considerably catalyst coking. It allows also the use of common materials for the reactor walls which otherwise would facilitate secondary unwanted reactions. The membrane area necessary for a typical propylene production of 100 000 t/year is reasonable (from 50 to 312 mÂ² as presented in Table 6) {{in the case of a}} dense palladium membrane but much too high in the case of a carbon molecular sieve. The discussion of the application of membrane reactors to the dehydrogenation of cyclohexane shows that the operating pressure in the reactor is critical. It should not be increased in order to build a high driving force across the membrane because it would then displace the reaction equilibrium towards the reactants, lowering therefore the equilibrium conversion. For this reason, palladium membranes are all the more attractive as the permeation driving force is proportional to the difference of the square roots of the partial pressures. Steam reforming of natural gas to produce hydrogen is a catalytic endothermic reaction of which conversion is increased by high temperature (Table 7). The traditional process includes the reformer itself, a second reactor to finish converting carbon monoxide and a pressure swing adsorption <b>hydrogen</b> <b>separator.</b> Fig. 2 presents the process if a membrane reactor is used. The effect of the in-situ membrane separation is quantified in Table 8 : for characteristic operating conditions, conversion increases from 0. 678 to 0. 916. In conclusion, some aspects of the development of membrane reactors are discussed. The necessity to develop resistant asymmetric composite membranes with a palladium deposit less than 1 Âµm is stressed out...|$|E

In this study, the hydrogen diffusivity (driven by concentration differences) and electrolyte permeability (driven by differential pressures) of the Zirfon PERL separator were characterized {{as a function of}} the temperature and molarity of the KOH filling. The diffusivity of <b>hydrogen</b> in the <b>separator</b> was found to be approximately 16 % of that of the electrolyte filling inside its pores. With respect to water electrolysis conditions, the extent of hydrogen cross-permeation caused by the convection of the cross-permeating electrolyte was estimated and compared to that caused by diffusion.

40|$|The {{development}} of high-temperature electrochemical {{devices such as}} oxygen and <b>hydrogen</b> <b>separators,</b> fuel gas reformers, solid oxide fuel cells, and chemical sensors {{is part of a}} rapidly expanding segment of the solid state technology market. These devices employ an ionic conducting ceramic as the active membrane that establishes the electrochemical potential of the device, either under voltage (i. e. to carry out gas separation) or under chemical gradient (to develop an electrical potential and thereby generate electrical power). Because the device operates under an ionic gradient that develops across the electrolyte, hermiticity across this layer is paramount. That is, not only must this thin ceramic membrane be dense with no interconnected porosity, but it must be connected {{to the rest of the}} device, typically constructed from a heat resistant alloy, with a high-temperature, gas-tight seal. A significant engineering challenge in fabricating these devices is how to effectively join the thin electrochemically active membrane to the metallic body of the device such that the resulting seal is hermetic, rugged, and stable during continuous high temperature operation. Active metal brazing is the typical method of joining ceramic and metal engineering components. It employs a braze alloy that contains one or more reactive elements, often titanium, which will chemically reduce the ceramic faying surface and greatly improve its wetting behavior and adherence with the braze. However, recent studies of these brazes for potential use in fabricating high-temperature electrochemical devices revealed problems with interfacial oxidation and subsequent joint failure [1, 2]. Specifically, it was found that the introduction of the ceramic electrolyte and/or heat resistant metal substrate dramatically affects the inherent oxidation behavior of the braze, often in a deleterious manner. These conclusions pointed to the need for an oxidation resistant, high-temperature ceramic-to-metal braze and consequently lead to the {{development of}} the novel reactive air brazing (RAB) concept. The goal in RAB is to reactively modify one or both oxide faying surfaces with an oxide compound dissolved in a molten noble metal alloy such that the newly formed surface is readily wetted by the remaining liquid filler material. In many respects, this concept is similar to active metal brazing, except that joining can be conducted in air and the final joint will be resistant to oxidation at high temperature. Potentially, there are a number of metal oxide-noble metal systems that can be considered for RAB, including Ag-CuO, Ag-V 2 O 5, and Pt-Nb 2 O 5. Our current interest is in determining whether the Ag-CuO system is suitable for air brazing functional ceramic-to-metal joints such as those needed in practical electrochemical devices. In a series of studies, the wetting behavior of the Ag-CuO braze was investigated with respect to a number of potential hydrogen separation, oxygen separation, and fuel cell electrolyte membrane materials and heat resistant metal systems, including: alumina, (La 0. 6 Sr 0. 4) (Co 0. 2 Fe 0. 8) O 3, (La 0. 8 Sr 0. 2) FeO 3, YSZ, fecralloy, and Crofer- 22 APU. Selected findings from these studies as well as from our work on joint strength and durability during high-temperature exposure testing will be discussed...|$|R

The reliability of these dense metallic permeators is strongly related to the design configuration of the membrane modules. In fact, {{as a consequence of}} hydrogenation and thermal cycles, the dense metallic tubes vary significantly in their length: in case of constraints between the membrane and the module, cyclic axial stresses are applied to the thin wall tube involving the rupture of the permeator. In our applications, a finger-like assembly of the permeator tube has been designed: it permits the free elongation and contraction of the palladium alloy tube avoiding any mechanical stress. In this work, different configurations of palladium membrane reactors used for separating ultra pure hydrogen are described and a study of a membrane process for producing ultra pure hydrogen from ethanol reforming is also presented.
