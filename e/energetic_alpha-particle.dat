40|$|Toroidal Alfvén Eigenmodes (TAEs) {{driven by}} <b>energetic</b> <b>alpha-particle</b> have been {{observed}} {{for the first time}} in TFTR DT plasmas. These modes occur 100 - 300 ms after DT neutral beam injection in plasmas with elevated central safety factor and reduced central magnetic shear. TAEs are observed for (0) 0. 01 % in q(0) > 2. 0 discharges, consistent with linear stability calculations [IAEA/CN/ 64 /D 2 - 6] for plasmas with elevated q(0) and low beam ion damping. Modes appear in the TAE range of frequencies, 150 - 250 kHz, with toroidal mode numbers n= 2, 3, 4. From core reflectometer measurements the dominant n= 3 mode is localized near r/a » 0. 3 - 0. 4 which coincides with the region of large Ñ. No enhanced alpha loss or significant alpha redistribution is measured during the TAE activity, consistent with nonlinear simulations for a single core localized mode with weak linear growth rate (/ < 0. 5 %) and low saturated amplitude ˜ B / B~ 10 - 5. 1...|$|E
40|$|Intensities and {{spectral}} {{shapes of}} the prompt gamma-ray lines of Li- 7 at 0. 431 MeV and Be- 7 at 0. 478 MeV and of the delayed 0. 478 -MeV line, all resulting from alpha-alpha reactions, are calculated using recent direct measurements of the cross sections for the alpha-alpha reactions. It is found that the intensities of these lines are {{comparable to that of}} the 4. 44 -MeV line of C- 12, so that the investigated lines should be observable in large solar flares, provided their Doppler widths are not excessively large. An evaluation of the {{shapes of the}} prompt lines indicates that for an isotropic distribution of <b>energetic</b> <b>alpha-particles,</b> the two lines merge into a broad feature which essentially cannot be distinguished from the continuum. A situation in which the delayed 0. 478 -MeV line could be very narrow is considered...|$|R
40|$|One of {{the more}} ambitious uses of intense {{microwaves}} in tokamaks or in other magnetic confinement deuterium-tritium (DT) fusion devices would be to divert power from <b>energetic</b> <b>alpha-particles</b> to waves. This so-called "alpha-channelling" would be a large step towards achieving economical fusion power. The intense waves, amplified by the substantial free energy in the alpha-particles, damp on fuel ions, resulting in a hot ion mode, doubling the fusion power of the reactor at the same confined pressure. If the waves damp preferentially on electrons or ions traveling in one direction, current can be driven. This tutorial explains the key concepts and recent advances that lead us {{to believe in the}} plausibility of such an effect, at the same time showing how experiments to date give us a measure of confidence in both the simulations themselves, the underlying physical assumptions, and ultimately the reasonableness of the application of these ideas to alpha-channelling in a tokamak reactor...|$|R
40|$|Progress in the {{performance}} of tokamak devices has enable not only the production of significant bursts of fusion energy from deuterium-tritium plasmas in the Tokamak Fusion Test Reactor (TFTR) and the Joint European Torus (JET) but, more importantly, the initial study of the physics of burning magnetically confined plasmas. As a result of the worldwide research on tokamaks, the scientific and technical issues for achieving an ignited plasma are better understood and the remaining questions more clearly defined. The principal research topics which have been studied on TFTR are transport, magnetohydrodynamic stability, and energetic particle confinement. The integration of separate solutions to problems in each of these research areas has also been of major interest. Although significant advances, such as the reduction of turbulent transport by means of internal transport barriers, identification of the theoretically predicted bootstrap current, and the study of the confinement of <b>energetic</b> fusion <b>alpha-particles</b> have been made, interesting and important scientific and technical issues remain. In this paper, the implications for the TFTR experiments for overcoming these remaining issues will be discussed...|$|R
