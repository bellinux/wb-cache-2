5|$|The player, who {{collected}} all the four Kings, {{is entitled to}} <b>declare</b> tute (all), which automatically ends the round with a collector's victory. Having both King and Knight of the trump suit, one can <b>declare</b> las cuarenta (forty), scoring additional 40-round points. The combination of King and Knight of any other suit can be declared as veinte (twenty); it adds 20 round points to the player's score. If possible, a player can <b>declare</b> several combination. In such cases the declarations with the higher round point value must be made first. For example, after declaring veinte the player loses right to <b>declare</b> las cuarenta, though declaring another veinte is still allowed. In Two-player games the declaration order rule only applies to declarations between each trick is played, so the player can <b>declare</b> las cuarenta after veinte if the combination is collected by picking the previously missing card from the stock.|$|E
