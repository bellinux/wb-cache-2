50|$|In {{the course}} of the Reformation, the Electors {{promoted}} schooling. As early as 1510, a schoolteacher is believed to have taught classes in Kübelberg, even though the village did not yet have any schoolhouse. In 1615, the Reformed pastor Nicolaus reported to the Oberamt of Kaiserslautern: “At Kübelberg is a schoolmaster, Petrus Matzenbach. Has a salary from the Collector of 30 Rhenish guilders … also seven malter of corn. … This schoolmaster is hardworking, good at his calling …”. During the Thirty Years' War (which began only three years after Pastor Nicolaus’s report), schooling fell by the wayside, and it only began again once many children began growing up in the families that came to settle the village after the war. In Schönenberg and Kübelberg, schooling took different directions in each village. Kübelberg, as a new Catholic parish, established in the early 18th century a Catholic school, though the schoolteacher had to wait a long time for his monetary and material emoluments, since according to the rules, there was still supposed to be a Protestant schoolteacher. The Catholic school also sought out Catholic children from the neighbouring villages, mainly from Schönenberg. The building of the Catholic schoolhouse in Kübelberg about 1705 was ﬁnanced by the pastor himself. Until then, school was taught at private houses or at the rectory. In 1754, the Schultheiß reported to the Oberamt that the Catholic schoolmaster in Kübelberg had to teach 60 children and received 10 Malter of corn and 25 guilders each year, lived in a small, not well-built house and had at his disposal a little garden. About the children’s behaviour there was no complaint. Given the steady population growth, the available schoolhouse soon was no longer big enough for the village. In 1797, the people of Kübelberg got a new schoolhouse for all the area’s Catholic children. In this building, which would later become the convent, school was taught until 1910. In 1848, the municipality bought up the inn to convert it into a school, too. The number of Catholic children rose more quickly than the number of Evangelical children, and thus Schönenberg soon found itself having to make an <b>equalization</b> <b>payment</b> to Kübelberg. The year 1965 marked the last time that a school for Kübelberg alone stood on Pestalozzistraße in Kübelberg. Since the establishment of the Schulzentrum Süd, this building has served as a primary school for the whole, merged municipality of Schönenberg-Kübelberg. The Protestant children, mainly those from Schönenberg, at ﬁrst attended school in neighbouring Miesau. Only about 1730 did the municipality of Schönenberg build a schoolhouse for the Reformed and Lutheran children. It was expanded in 1802. In 1821, a new Evangelical schoolhouse was built in Schönenberg, though after a few decades, it was no longer up to the task at hand. Thus, a new one was built in 1910, although great population growth also quickly made this one too small, particularly as Schönenberg introduced Christian community school. So, with the Second World War looming, Schönenberg began to build yet another schoolhouse, but this was left unﬁnished until after the war, whereupon it was built into a private house. For a while, the district maintained an agricultural vocational school near the Schönenberg schoolhouse in the time after the war. In 1972, there was a thorough reform of schooling. All schoolchildren from all four of Schönenberg-Kübelberg’s centres now attend a single primary school, which has no local peculiarities, nor denominational afﬁliations. From 1979 to 1982, the Schulzentrum Süd (“School Centre South”) was built for all the Hauptschule students of the Verbandsgemeinde (Erich-Kästner-Schule). Also housed at this complex is a Realschule. The primary school pupils from the whole municipality are now taught at the schoolhouse on Pestalozzistraße. The nearest Gymnasium is in Homburg (not even in the same state), while special schools can be found in Kusel and Brücken. Nearby universities are in Homburg (Saarland University, Faculty of Medicine), Kaiserslautern (Kaiserslautern University of Technology), Trier (University of Trier) and Saarbrücken (Saarland University).|$|E

40|$|We {{investigate}} {{the conditions under}} which an inequality averse and additively separable welfarist constitution maker would always choose to set up a progressive <b>equalization</b> <b>payment</b> scheme in a federation with local public goods. A progressive <b>equalization</b> <b>payment</b> scheme is defined as a list of per capita net (possibly negative) subsidies – one such net subsidy for every jurisdiction - that are decreasing with respect to jurisdictions per capita wealth. We examine the question in a setting in which the case for progressivity is a priori the strongest, namely, all citizens have the same utility function for the private good and the public good, inhabitants of a given jurisdiction are all identicals and are not able to move accross jurisdictions. We show that a necessary and sufficient condition that the objective function of the constitution maker must satisfy to favour a progressive <b>equalization</b> <b>payment</b> scheme for all distributions of wealth and all population sizes is to be additively separable between each jurisdiction’s per capita wealth and number of inhabitants. When interpreted for a mean of order social welfare function, this condition is shown to be equivalent to additive separability of the individual’s indirect utility function with respect to wealth and the price of the public good. Some implications of this restriction to the case where the citizen direct utility function is additively separable are also derived. ...|$|E

50|$|<b>Equalization</b> <b>payments</b> is {{the most}} {{commonly}} known system for the redistribution of revenue in Germany and is an important tool for the financing of regional development. Levels of awareness are raised thanks to public disagreements between the states; legal actions over the allocation of payments have been taken by various states in the Federal Constitutional Court on many occasions including 1952, 1986, 1992, 1999 and 2006. A legal action by the states of Bavaria and Baden Würtemberg is pending in 2016. For many years the <b>equalization</b> <b>payments</b> have accounted for 2% to 3% of state income; in 2015 <b>equalization</b> <b>payments</b> amounted to €9.6bn compared {{to state and local}} tax revenues of €306bn.

40|$|The work of Boadway and Hayashi (2001) and Smart (2007) {{tends to}} confirm the {{hypothesis}} that provinces who are the beneficiaries of <b>equalization</b> <b>payments</b> adopt strategic behaviours that reduce their tax capacity and thus increase these payments. In this study, we analyze the impact that a new hydroelectricity royalty paid by Hydro-Quebec to the Quebec Treasury has on total <b>equalization</b> <b>payments</b> received by the province; to do this, we consider the equalization formulas used before 2004 and after 2007. This royalty, which generates approximately $ 600 million each year, reduces Quebec's <b>equalization</b> <b>payments</b> by just over $ 100 million, using either formula.
