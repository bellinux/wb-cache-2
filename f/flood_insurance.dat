The village participates in the National <b>Flood</b> <b>Insurance</b> Program, a Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) project, to alleviate a portion of the costs of flood damage that may overtax affected village residents.

OTA's attorney stated that the requisite information had been provided to local officials, and it was not OTA's responsibility to ensure that they forwarded the information on to FEMA.|$|E
5|$|Shelters {{closed by}} September1 and {{residents}} {{returned to their}} homes, although Hatteras Island remained off-limits to everyone but emergency workers for several days. Unemployment across Hatteras rose {{in the wake of}} the damage to local businesses, and many restaurants lost product when their refrigerators failed during the power outages. Residents piled debris from their damaged homes on roads, primarily Highway 12, and workers responded by clearing the debris. The highway was speedily reopened and repaired at a cost of around $1million. Within two weeks of the storm, businesses resumed as cleaning work was under way, and the island was reopened to tourists. Clean-up operations in the region lasted weeks to months. In the three months after the storm, saltwater intrusion into the Cape Hatteras water supply boosted chlorine levels from 40milligrams (0.0014ounces) to 280milligrams (0.01ounces) per liter; it took another three months for the chlorine to decrease to normal concentrations. Around 50homeowners affected by Emily raised their houses to prevent a recurrence, partially funded by <b>flood</b> <b>insurance</b> payments.|$|E

5|$|The flood had {{a massive}} effect on Fairbanks. Four people were killed, {{and the damage}} ran into the {{hundreds}} of millions of dollars. It helped push the city's remaining farm, Creamer's Dairy, into bankruptcy, and it forced the closure of St. Joseph's Hospital. Fairbanks residents responded to the problems with aplomb. The annual Tanana Valley State Fair was postponed but not canceled. Seven thousand dollars were raised to buy Creamer's Dairy and turn it into a bird sanctuary. KTVF, one of the few town businesses to have <b>flood</b> <b>insurance,</b> rebuilt its studio and became the first Fairbanks TV station to broadcast in color, four months after the flood. When two bond measures to build a government-run hospital were turned down by Fairbanks voters, residents raised $2.6 million from private contributions and $6 million from the state and federal government to build Fairbanks Memorial Hospital.|$|E
5|$|Much of {{the eastern}} portion of West Virginia was {{declared}} a federal disaster area on November 7, 1985. Within {{two weeks of the}} declaration, the United States Army Corps of Engineers (USACE) began clearing debris across the state, which was completed by July 1986. Widespread areas were under a boil-water advisory due to damage to water facilities, prompting officials to deliver trucks with bottled water through disaster areas. The state's highway department worked with FEMA and the USACE to clear destroyed buildings. Workers also buried killed animals, cleared blocked streams, and helped farmers regrow lost crops. FEMA opened 20disaster centers across the state to coordinate residents' requests for federal aid, and used 290 full or part-time employees. Overall federal assistance totaled $285million, including $171million for debris removal and repairing infrastructure, $90million for loans and temporary housing, and $24million through payments from the National <b>Flood</b> <b>Insurance</b> Program. This followed a six-week period when applications for such assistance were processed. After receiving complaints about inadequate funding, FEMA increased payments to 869people. FEMA also built 647temporary mobile homes, only about half of which were utilized. Residents complained that the money spent on the homes was misdirected and instead should have been given directly to victims. Many residents in Albright moved away after the main industry - river rafting - was washed away. In the city of Parsons, most businesses relied on small business loans to continue operating, although 18stores never reopened following the floods. Officials held a telethon on state television and radio on December7, 1985, that ultimately raised $1.7million for storm victims in the state. In the years after the flood, residents rebuilt houses farther away from flood plains, while officials rebuilt roads, bridges, and public buildings.|$|E

40|$|Usually, an actuary {{would begin}} {{by trying to}} study a {{particular}} consumer insurance pool. In this work, I am working on Colombia and soon, I struggled in having complete and precise information. Indeed, it is a recurrent issue for actuaries studying most emerging countries.  The next step would be to estimate the risks an insurance company will have to face in order to create profitable products. I was interested in studying Climatic risks and, since Colombia's weather is interesting. I decided to study the floods in Colombia.  Colombian weather is ruled by still unpredictable and random events: El Niño and La Niña that bring droughts and floods. Once again, I quite struggled in having reliable insurance information about the floods since this risk has never been surveyed separately from the overall house damages before 2010. From 2010 to 2012, because of the frequency {{and the importance of}} the <b>floods,</b> <b>insurance</b> companies have been trying to study the cost of climatic catastrophes but it was not profitable enough for them to keep on. Indeed, there are not enough people subscribing to house insurances for it to be profitable. Hence, I did not work only on 2010 - 2012 data because it does not allow me to stand back enough. I worked with the overall house damages data.  Finally, from the two previous analysis, an actuary have to adapt his product to the consumer market.

Nevertheless, preparing for sea-level rise has been {{the exception rather than the}} rule. Most coastal institutions were based on the implicit assumption that sea level and shorelines are stable. Efforts to plan for sea-level rise can be thwarted by several institutional biases, including government policies that encourage coastal development, <b>flood</b> <b>insurance</b> maps that do not consider sea-level rise, federal policies that prefer shoreline armoring over soft shore protection, and lack of plans delineating which areas would be protected or not as sea level rises.|$|E

25|$|Physical process {{models of}} channel reaches are {{generally}} well understood and will calculate {{the depth and}} area of inundation for given channel conditions and a specified flow rate, such as for use in floodplain mapping and <b>flood</b> <b>insurance.</b> Conversely, given the observed inundation area of a recent flood and the channel conditions, a model can calculate the flow rate.

40|$|Insurance is a {{classical}} tool to hedge against risks. Thanks {{to the law}} of large numbers, it pools funds from a large number of similar exposures to pay for the losses incurred by somehow. The theory tells us that all risk-adverse people is willing to buy insurance if the premium is actuarially fair or even if the price of the coverage is greater than the expected loss. However, what happens in the insurance market of catastrophic risks is completely different: demands for cat covers, subscribed voluntarily, are rare. Paying a premium for a risk with low probability but high loss, even if it is fair, is considered an overprotection. This is probably due to incomplete information. This irrationality in the demand does not allow insurance firms to reach the critical mass, necessary to define the right capital allocation. This {{is one of the reasons}} why cat covers are not so widespread in the insurance market. In the present paper, we investigate the anomalous behaviour of demand and supply for cat policies and we study some possible solutions.
