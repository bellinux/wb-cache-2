40|$|How {{much can}} we turn the screw on counter-examples to the KK principle? The principle, also {{sometimes}} called “positive introspection”, says <b>that</b> if one <b>knows</b> <b>that</b> P, one <b>knows</b> <b>that</b> one <b>knows</b> <b>that</b> P. It is widely, although not universally, {{acknowledged that the}} KK principle is false, {{and not just for}} the boring reason <b>that</b> one can <b>know</b> <b>that</b> P without having formed the belief <b>that</b> one <b>knows</b> <b>that</b> P. One can <b>know</b> <b>that</b> P, and believe <b>that</b> one <b>knows</b> <b>that</b> P, without knowing <b>that</b> one <b>knows</b> <b>that</b> P, because one is not in a strong enough epistemic position to <b>know</b> <b>that</b> one <b>knows</b> <b>that</b> P (Williamson 2000 : 114 - 30). One’s epistemic position is weaker with respect to the fact <b>that</b> one <b>knows</b> <b>that</b> P than it is with respect to the fact that P itself. But how much weaker can one’s epistemic position be with respect to the fact <b>that</b> one <b>knows</b> <b>that</b> P than it is with respect to the fact that P? Of course, if one does <b>know</b> <b>that</b> P, one’s epistemic position with respect to the fact <b>that</b> one <b>knows</b> <b>that</b> P cannot be so bad <b>that</b> one positively <b>knows</b> <b>that</b> one does not <b>know</b> <b>that</b> P, as opposed to merely failing to <b>know</b> <b>that</b> one <b>knows</b> <b>that</b> P, for knowing is 1 factive: one can know only what is indeed the case.

40|$|In 1995, I {{wrote an}} essay 'Existence'.
