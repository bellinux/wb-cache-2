500|$|In July 2008, Neighbours was branded [...] "too white" [...] {{by black}} and Asian viewers in Britain. A {{report found that}} many ethnic viewers felt they were {{under-represented}} in some of Britain's most popular television shows. In Australia {{there was talk of}} a 'White Australia policy' when it came to casting actors for top-rated soaps. In response to the criticism, executive producer Susan Bower made the decision to add more ethnically diverse extras, small walk on roles and speaking parts. She also decided to introduce 15-year-old Korean actor Hany Lee into the cast as exchange student, Sunny Lee. Bower said [...] "I know we're going to get flak about this gorgeous little Korean girl who's <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>coming</b> in next year, because you're damned if you do and damned if you don't".|$|E

While interest from Hollywood was not forthcoming he attracted the attention of many independent filmmakers.

Zorn did attract the interest of filmmaker Walter Hill who contracted him to compose music for a film to be called Looters. The film was finally released in 1992 as Trespass (1992) featuring a score by Ry Cooder. Although Zorn's score was not used in the final release he used the commission he received for composing to establish his own record label, Tzadik, and released [...] in 1995.|$|E

60|$|The city looked doleful. Although it was {{not very}} early in the morning, there were very few people about. Some men could be seen on the decks of the vessels at the wharves, and a big steamer for one of the {{northern}} ports was getting up steam.

On a post, near these boys, a lounger sat fishing with a long pole,--actually fishing away as if there were no sorrows and deaths, or shipwrecked or broken-hearted people in the world.

Risky situations for manufacturing are considered in trying to individuate the optimal positioning of the order penetration point (OPP). It aims at defining the best level of information of the client’s order going back through the several supply chain (SC) phases, i. e. engineering, procurement, production and distribution. This work aims at defining a system dynamics model to assess competitiveness coming from the positioning of the order in different SC locations. A Taguchi analysis has <b>been</b> implemented <b>to</b> create a decision map for identifying possible strategic decisions under different scenarios and with alternatives for order location in the SC levels. Centralized and decentralized strategies for SC integration are discussed. In the model proposed, the location of OPP is influenced by the demand variation, production time, stock-outs and stock amount. Results of this research are as follows: (i) customer-oriented strategies are preferable under high volatility of demand, (ii) production-focused strategies are suggested when the probability of stock-outs is high, (iii) no specific location is preferable if a centralized control architecture is implemented, (iv) centralization requires cooperation among partners to achieve the SC optimum point, (v) the producer must not prefer the OPP location at the Retailer level when the general strategy is focused on a decentralized approach...|$|R
