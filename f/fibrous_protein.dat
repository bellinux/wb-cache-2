5|$|In soft corals, {{there is}} no stony {{skeleton}} but the tissues are often toughened {{by the presence of}} tiny skeletal elements known as sclerites, which are made from calcium carbonate. Soft corals are very variable in form and most are colonial. A few soft corals are stolonate, but the polyps of most are connected by sheets of coenosarc. In some species this is thick and the polyps are deeply embedded. Some soft corals are encrusting or form lobes. Others are tree-like or whip-like and have a central axial skeleton embedded in the tissue matrix. This is composed either of a <b>fibrous</b> <b>protein</b> called gorgonin or of a calcified material. In both stony and soft corals, the polyps can be retracted, with stony corals relying on their hard skeleton and cnidocytes for defence against predators, with soft corals generally relying on chemical defences in the form of toxic substances present in the tissues known as terpenoids.|$|E
500|$|Since protein {{structure}} was so poorly {{understood in the}} 1930s, the physical interactions responsible for stabilizing that structure were likewise unknown. [...] Astbury hypothesized that the structure of fibrous proteins was stabilized by hydrogen bonds in β-sheets. [...] The idea that globular proteins are also stabilized by hydrogen bonds was proposed by Dorothy Jordan Lloyd in 1932, and championed later by Alfred Mirsky and Linus Pauling. [...] At a 1933 lecture by Astbury to the Oxford Junior Scientific Society, physicist Frederick Frank suggested that the <b>fibrous</b> <b>protein</b> α-keratin might be stabilized by an alternative mechanism, namely, covalent crosslinking of the peptide bonds by the cyclol reaction above. [...] The cyclol crosslink draws the two peptide groups close together; the N and C atoms are separated by ~1.5Å, whereas they are separated by ~3Å in a typical hydrogen bond. [...] The idea intrigued J. D. Bernal, who suggested it to the mathematician Dorothy Wrinch as possibly useful in understanding {{protein structure}}.|$|E

50|$|Keratinases are {{produced}} {{only in the}} presence of keratin-containing substrate. They mainly attack the disulfide (-S-S-) bond of the keratin substrate (Bockel et al., 1995). Keratinase production in various microorganisms was reported on by a number of researchers. It was found that keratinase in fungi, Streptomyces and bacteria were produced in nearly at alkaline pH and almost thermophilic temperatures. These enzymes have a wide range of substrate specificity such as it can degrade other <b>fibrous</b> <b>protein</b> fibrin, elastin, collagen and other non <b>fibrous</b> <b>protein</b> like casein, bovine serum albumin gelatin etc. (Noval et al., 1959; Mukhapadhayay et al., 1989; Dozie et al., 1994; Lin et al., 1995; Letourneau et al., 1998; and Bressollier et al., 1999).|$|E

5|$|Proteins can be informally {{divided into}} three main classes, which {{correlate}} with typical tertiary structures: globular <b>proteins,</b> <b>fibrous</b> <b>proteins,</b> and membrane proteins. Almost all globular proteins are soluble and many are enzymes. <b>Fibrous</b> <b>proteins</b> are often structural, such as collagen, the major component of connective tissue, or keratin, the protein component of hair and nails. Membrane proteins often serve as receptors or provide channels for polar or charged molecules {{to pass through the}} cell membrane.|$|R
50|$|A pearl {{is formed}} when the mantle tissue is injured by a parasite, {{an attack of}} a fish or another event that damages the {{external}} fragile rim of the shell of a mollusk shell bivalve or gastropod. In response, the mantle tissue of the mollusk secretes nacre into the pearl sac, a cyst that forms during the healing process. Chemically speaking, this is calcium carbonate and a <b>fibrous</b> <b>protein</b> called conchiolin. As the nacre builds up in layers of minute aragonite tablets, it fills the growing pearl sac and eventually forms a pearl.|$|E
50|$|Collagen is the <b>fibrous</b> <b>protein</b> {{that gives}} the ECM its tensile strength, or rigidity. Elastin - as its name {{suggests}} - is a highly elastic protein with {{an important role in}} tissues that need to return to their original positions after deformation, such as skin, blood vessels, and lungs. The relative concentrations of these two main determinants, along with other less influential matrix components, determine the rigidity of the ECM. For example, collagen concentration has been reported to be correlated to matrix stiffness, both in vivo and in vitro (gels).|$|E
5000|$|Substitution of the poly-Pro II (φ,ψ) {{dihedral}} angles {{into this}} equation yields almost exactly Ω = -120°, i.e., the PPII helix is a left-handed helix (since Ω is negative) with three residues per turn (360°/120° = 3). The rise per residue is approximately 3.1 Å. This structure is somewhat {{similar to that}} adopted in the <b>fibrous</b> <b>protein</b> collagen, which is composed mainly of proline, hydroxyproline, and glycine. PPII helices are specifically bound by SH3 domains; this binding is important for many protein-protein interactions and even for interactions between the domains of a single protein.|$|E

The eggshell membrane was composed of many <b>fibrous</b> <b>proteins</b> on which lots of reductive groups like –OH, –NH 2, –SH, etc. were interspersed. An in situ redox reaction was triggered once the KMnO 4 was introduced. While MnO 2 was generated, it grew gradually around these active groups. As a consequence, it was dispersed uniformly {{on the surface of}} <b>fibrous</b> <b>proteins</b> to form ESM-templated MnO 2 NPs.|$|R
50|$|Silk {{is made up}} of {{two primary}} proteins; a <b>fibrous</b> <b>protein</b> known as fibroin, and a sticky protein known as sericin, with the two {{comprising}} 70-80% and 20-30% of silk, respectively. Both of these proteins provide the unique functionality of silk that makes silk clothes so unique and so popular, with the production of silk material dating back to as early as 3500 BC. What is not so well known though is that silk has been used in traditional medicine in both China and Korea for centuries. The source of these silk amino acids is typically the domesticated moth, silkworm (Latin name: Bombyx mori).|$|E

50|$|Holaxonia is a {{suborder}} of soft corals, {{a member}} of the phylum Cnidaria. Members of this suborder are sometimes known as gorgonians and include the sea blades, the sea fans, the sea rods and the sea whips. These soft corals are colonial, sessile organisms and are generally tree-like in structure. They do not have a hard skeleton composed of calcium carbonate but have a firm but pliable, central axial skeleton composed of a <b>fibrous</b> <b>protein</b> called gorgonin embedded in a tissue matrix, the coenenchyme. In some genera this is permeated with a calcareous substance in the form of fused spicules. Members of this suborder are characterized by having an unspiculated axis and often a soft, chambered central core. The polyps have eight-fold symmetry and in many species, especially in the families Gorgoniidae and Plexauridae, contain symbiotic photosynthetic algae called zooxanthellae. These soft corals are popular in salt water aquaria.|$|E

50|$|The {{upper shell}} of the turtle is called the {{carapace}}. The lower shell that encases the belly is called the plastron. The carapace and plastron are joined together on the turtle's sides by bony structures called bridges. The inner layer of a turtle's shell {{is made up of}} about 60 bones that include portions of the backbone and the ribs, meaning the turtle cannot crawl out of its shell. In most turtles, the outer layer of the shell is covered by horny scales called scutes that are part of its outer skin, or epidermis. Scutes are made up of the <b>fibrous</b> <b>protein</b> keratin that also makes up the scales of other reptiles. These scutes overlap the seams between the shell bones and add strength to the shell. Some turtles do not have horny scutes; for example, the leatherback sea turtle and the soft-shelled turtles have shells covered with leathery skin instead.|$|E

50|$|The regal sea fan is {{a colonial}} coral {{averaging}} about 6 in in height. It has a horny axial skeleton {{made of a}} <b>fibrous</b> <b>protein</b> called gorgonin covered with coenenchyme, {{a thin layer of}} living tissue from which the polyps protrude. Embedded in the coenenchyme are minute capstan-shaped and rod-shaped calcified sclerites. As well as strengthening the tissue, these are distasteful to most predators. The coral is densely branched but usually grows in a single plane. The colour varies and is usually some shade of red, orange or deep yellow but purple specimens occasionally occur. The skeleton is not rigid so the whole fan-like structure can sway with the movement of the surrounding water. The polyps are white and project in alternate rows from slit-shaped openings in hemispherical calyces on the branches. Each polyp can retract into its calyx and has eight pinnate tentacles and eight mesenteries dividing the body cavity. The whole colony has a single siphonoglyph, an opening through which water enters the structure.|$|E
