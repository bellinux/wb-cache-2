40|$|While the new European merger {{regulation}} makes explicit {{room for}} efficiencies, they almost never sway {{the decision in}} practice. To some extent, {{this is because the}} need to prove that the three cumulative conditions- verifiability, merger-specificity and benefit to consumers - are met is a tough requirement. But this difficulty is compounded by the prevalence of three views which reduce competition authorities' receptiveness to efficiency claims, and which we believe to be mistaken. These views are (i) the idea that efficiencies cannot benefit consumers in little competitive markets, (ii) the idea that savings on fixed costs never benefit consumers, and (iii) the idea that buyer-power <b>induced</b> <b>cost</b> reductions are irrelevant.

40|$|The {{main subject}} of this Bachelor thesis is the {{analysis}} of administrative and <b>induced</b> <b>costs</b> of agricultural subsidies. For {{the purpose of this}} thesis three basic subsidies were selected which agricultural entrepreneurs are allowed at present: Flat-rate payment per area (SAPS) paid by the National Agricultural Intervention Fund, Subsidy of a part of the credit interest and Support to the producer to cover the cost connected with crop insurance, both paid by the Agricultural and Forestry Relief and Guarantee Fund. The administrative and <b>induced</b> <b>costs</b> were determined by a questionnaire investigation. The results of the investigation allow us to state that the costs of the investigated organisations compared with the promised subsidies are not high [...] no more than 2, 31 %. For the quantification of the <b>induced</b> <b>costs</b> ten agricultural entrepreneurs were addressed. Neither in this case does the financial amount incurred compose a high percentage of the afforded subsidy [...] up to 0, 6 % on the average.

40|$|Marine Protected Areas are {{considered}} as a hedging tool {{against some of the}} uncertainties that trouble many fisheries today. Such tools are always connected with a cost; a premium. An optimal harvest rule is combined with a protected area to manage a fishery. The model ignores uncertainty, and is thus ideal to analyze the <b>induced</b> <b>cost</b> arising from protected areas. We address the premium by comparing settings where only an optimal harvesting policy is implemented and where the combined management tool is used. The premium is found to be increasing and convex {{as a function of the}} degree of protection. Concepts of relative growth efficiency, relative biological gain, and biological efficiency are all introduced to increase the understanding of the management tool and its effects on the bioeconomic system.

40|$|Graduation date: 1998 Increased {{competition}} {{brought about}} by trade liberalization has raised the stakes for improving productivity in U. S. and Canadian food processing.

40|$|One {{feature of}} the European patent system that is heavily criticized {{nowadays}} is related to its complex fragmentation and the <b>induced</b> <b>cost</b> burden for applicants. Once a patent is granted by the EPO, the assignee must validate (and often translate) it and pay the renewal fees {{to keep it in}} force in each country in which the applicant seeks protection. The objective {{of this paper is to}} assess to what extent validation and renewal fees as well as translation costs affect the validation behavior of applicants. We rely on a gravity model that aims at explaining patent flows between inventor and target countries within the European patent system. The results show that the size of countries, their wealth and the distance between their capital cities are significant determinants of patent flows. Validation fees and renewal fees further affect the validation behavior of applicants. Translation costs seem to have an impact as well. The important role played by fees suggests that the implementation of cost-reducing policy interventions like the London Protocol would induce a significant increase in the number of patents validated in each European country. ...|$|E

Probabilistic analysis, based on the variability of pavement material properties and layer thickness {{as well as on}} traffic variability is required and needed as a cost effective basis for the many possible design and maintenance strategies. The NOAH software was used to combine hundreds of possible design scenarios on a compressive basis for the decision making process towards a design criteria. The use of Rosenblueth transformations permitted the reduction of computational efforts and made possible the conclusion of this comprehensive design approach within the time frame of the tender. The bases for the data variability parameters were actual measurements made in the existing 83 km of freeway.

40|$|We {{study the}} case of {{scheduling}} a Contextual Information Process (CIP) over incomplete multivariate contextual data streams coming from sensing devices in Internet of Things (IoT) environments. CIPs like data fusion, concept drift detection, and predictive analytics adopt window-based methods for processing continuous stream queries. CIPs involve the continuous evaluation of functions over contextual attributes (e. g., air pollutants measurements from environmental sensors) possibly incomplete (i. e., containing missing values) thus degrading {{the quality of the}} CIP results. We introduce a mechanism, which monitors the quality of the contextual streaming values and then optimally determines the appropriate time to activate a CIP. CIP is optimally delayed in hopes of observing in the near future higher quality of contextual values in terms of validity, freshness and presence. Our time-optimized mechanism activates a CIP when the expected quality is maximized taking also into account the <b>induced</b> <b>cost</b> of delay and an aging framework of freshness over contextual values. We propose two analytical time-based stochastic optimization models and provide extensive sensitivity analysis. We provide a comparative assessment with sliding window-centric models found in the literature and showcase the efficiency of our mechanism on improving the quality of results of a CIP...|$|E

This integration allows the use of available resources in the cloud and therefore to have a scalable and interoperable VoIP service and allowing new opportunities for VoIP architectures expansion. However, these services are exposed to attacks inherited from the VoIP application layer and attacks caused by the openness of the cloud architecture. As the cloud is used to establish an flooding-based attack, we will use the resources proposed and the cloud architecture {{to provide a security}} solution.

This approach is based on the outsourcing of countermeasures to be used as an independent service.

We propose different strategies to implement countermeasures in the failure case which may affect the VoIP services.

40|$|The {{employment}} {{effects of}} environmental technologies {{are in the}} focus of politicians but there are only few studies analyzing these effects for different environmental innovation fields. We use the 2009 wave of the German part of the Community Innovation Panel (CIS) allowing for such an analysis at the firm level. The main focus of the paper lies on {{the analysis of the}} adaptation behavior of firms with respect to the relationship of employment and (environmental) innovation. We use an endogenous switching regression approach to take the simultaneous character of innovation activities and employment demand into consideration. Our econometric analysis shows that innovative firms in general are characterized by a significantly more dynamic employment development. Especially the realization of environmental process innovations leads to a higher employment within the firm. The theoretical background of this finding is that process innovation <b>induced</b> <b>cost</b> savings improve the competitiveness of firms. This has a positive effect on demand and thus also increases employment. A more detailed analysis by different environmental innovation fields shows that material and energy savings are positively correlated to employment because they especially help to increase the profitability and competitiveness of the firm. On the other side, air and water process innovations that are still dominated by end-of-pipe technologies {{have a negative impact on}} the employment development...|$|E
40|$|In {{the past}} decades, the {{development}} of housing estate and mobility behaviour in the Alpine space has been characterised by growing land use and landscape fragmentation on the one hand, as well as increasing commuting distances and motorised individual traffic on the other hand. Both processes mutually influence each other, since the location of housing is a central determinant for everyday mobility requirements. However, despite several interdependencies, housing decisions are generally made without comprehensive knowledge about their far-reaching implications. The work at hand presents the working steps to develop a calculator for private households {{in the province of}} Salzburg. The Web-based tool is meant to both indicate the impact of housing and mobility decisions on a household’s expenditure, and to illustrate the influence of housing locations on mobility opportunities. Therefore the transparency of <b>induced</b> <b>cost</b> structures shall be fostered, and the awareness of households on existing interdependencies shall be raised. In the end, this shall contribute to more long-sighted housing and mobility decisions, strengthening structurally integrated areas with less traffic and more environmentally sound modes of transport. As a result, the calculator was made available on-line and free of charge at www. moreco. at/haushaltsrechner. In conclusion, it can be found {{that in the long run}} the share of mobility costs in a household’s budget gains importance. Cheap land prices tend to face high mobility costs and hence overall costs may become more expensive in peripheral regions, compared to well integrated locations. The tool shall contribute to illustrate this finding, breaking the fixation on pure land prices in housing decisions...|$|E

In these conditions alleviating delays caused by airspace congestion is, {{and will continue to}} be, critical to the operation of the European air traffic control system. In the origin of delays are several factors, an important one being the congestions. We will focus on congestion in the airspace rather than at airports, both problems can be treated separately. Here we are interested in reducing the en-route congestion and the <b>induced</b> <b>cost,</b> and we study flight level optimization with respect to a given traffic demand and given routes. We typically consider here the total cost due to en-route conflict resolution. With respect to the FLA (Flight Level Assignment) problem, we restrict ourselves to only three possible levels for each flight, called preferred levels (the one in the middle being the most preferred). Despite this restriction, the problem remains highly combinatorial due to the large number of simultaneous flights. We prove formally that the flight level assignment problem is NP-complete in the strong sense even for an airspace with only three flight levels, which makes it hard to solve at optimum even for reduced size instances. The problem becomes rather more difficult when involving the uncertainties in ATM (Air Traffic Management). More precisely, an important question that we raise in this paper is how to include the potential en-route conflicts associated with each aircraft in the flight level assignment model and take into account the uncertainties related to it. All this leads to the robust flight level assignment problem and the associated mathematical model, which is the main focus of this work. </p...|$|E
40|$|Schumpeter {{argued that}} {{economic}} downturns had positive effects, in the incentives that it provided for firms {{to increase their}} efficiency. Part 1. provides a simple model confirming Schwnpeter's insight At thesame time, the model shows that there are real costs to economic fluctuations which extend well beyond the temporary losses in output and the economic waste resulting from unused resources: the future productivity {{of the economy is}} adversely affected, e. g, because of reduced expenditures on R&D. These long run losses are likely to be far more significant than any temporary gains from any <b>induced</b> <b>cost</b> cutting. While traditional Schumpeterian analyses have focused on the relationships between market structure and innovation, they have paid less attention to the relationship between innovation and capital market imperfections (resulting, in many cases, from problems of costly and imperfect information which are particularly important in the context of innovation). It is these capital market imperfections which give result in the deleterious effect of economic downturns on technological progress. Part II. of the paper shows that the nexus between fluctuations and innovation goes in both directions: fluctuations in economic activity not only cause fluctuations in innovation, fluctuations in innovation may give rise to fluctuations in economic activity. The positive feedback relationship between innovation and economic activity may, under a variety of conditions, give rise to multiple equilibria. There is no presumption that the free market, left to itself, will choose the best among them. Moreover, it is shown that under certain circumstances, the only market equilibrium entails economic fluctuations. It is the structure of the economy, not exogenous disturbances (as in real business cycle theory) which give rise to cyclical behavior. ...|$|E

The performance of these markets will influence everything from the prices faced by consumers to {{the reliability of the}} systems. The challenges of these changes present many important areas for research. For much of the northeastern United States, restructuring proposals include, at least for the short term, the formation of a single-sided auction mechanism for the wholesate market. This research uses experimental methods to analyze how these markets may function. In the experiments, the two basic uniform price auction rules are tested under three different market sizes. Early experimental results suggest the commonly proposed last-accepted-offer auction works well, but market power could be a real concern. Restructuring {{of electric}} power markets is proceed-ing across the United States and in many other nations around the world.

Especially the rise of abatement costs by subjects influenced by the deposit system and the influence on the system of separate collection.
