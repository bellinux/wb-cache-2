500|$|There {{were about}} an {{estimated}} 15–20,000 mature sarus cranes {{left in the}} wild in 2009. The Indian population is less than 10,000, but of the three subspecies, is the healthiest in terms of numbers. They are considered sacred and the birds are traditionally left unharmed, and in many areas they are unafraid of humans. They used to be found on occasion in Pakistan, but have not been seen there since the late 1980s. The population in India has however declined. Estimates of the global population suggest that the population in 2000 was at best about 10% and at the worst just 2.5% of the numbers that existed in 1850. Many farmers in India believe that these cranes damage standing crops, particularly rice, although studies show that <b>direct</b> <b>feeding</b> on rice grains resulted in losses amounting to {{less than one percent}} and trampling could account for grain loss of about [...] The attitude of farmers tends to be positive in spite of these damages, and this has helped in conserving the species within agricultural areas. The role of rice paddies may be particularly important for the birds' conservation, since natural wetlands are increasingly threatened by human activity. The conversion of wetlands to farmland, and farmland to more urban uses are major causes for habitat loss and long-term population decline. Compensating farmers for crop losses has been suggested as a measure that may help. The Australian population is greater than 5,000 birds and may be increasing, however, the Southeast Asian population has been decimated by war and habitat change (such as intensive agriculture, deforestation, and draining of wetlands) and by the mid-20th century had disappeared from large parts of its range which once stretched up to southern China; some 1500–2000 birds are left in several fragmented subpopulations. Payment to locals to guard nests and help increase breeding success has been attempted in northern Cambodia. Nest success of protected nests was significantly higher than that of unprotected nests, and positive population-level impacts were apparent. However, the program also caused local jealousies leading to deliberate disturbance of nests, and did nothing to alleviate larger-scale and more permanent threats due to habitat losses leading to the conclusion that such payment-for-conservation programs are at best a short-term complement, and not a substitute, to more permanent interventions that include habitat preservation. The little-known Philippine population became extinct in the late 1960s.|$|E

5000|$|There {{have also}} been studies based on the {{carcasses}} of other, non-mammalian marine vertebrates that have fallen to the deep sea. In particular, the chance discovery of a whale shark carcass and three mobulid ray carcasses led to observations on the communities that form surrounding large elasmobranch falls as opposed to whale falls. [...] Whale sharks inhabit waters of roughly 1,000 meters depth regularly, which suggests {{it could be a}} regular form of food fall in areas where it is abundant. [...] Many eelpouts (Zoarcidae) were found surrounding the whale shark with some evidence of <b>direct</b> <b>feeding</b> as boreholes were observed on the carcass. Another theory suggests that the eelpouts were waiting for their main prey, amphipods and other small benthic animals. The three rays found were at varying stages of decomposition, leading to varying assemblages found surrounding the individuals. A higher abundance of scavengers was found surrounding the more intact individuals, including scavengers typical of whale falls like hagfish. Around the least intact individual a bacterial mat was observed in the zone of enrichment, but no clams or mussels typical of this environment (i.e. whale falls) were seen.|$|E

40|$|Background: In {{spite of}} {{high rates of}} {{initiating}} breast milk feeding (BMF) among preterm infants, a significant rate of discontinuation occurs shortly after discharge. Aim: To investigate the effect of mode (<b>direct</b> <b>feeding</b> at the breast vs. expressing) and exclusivity (breast milk combined with formula vs. breast milk only) as well as maternal perceptions on the duration of BMF among preterm infants. Methods: The study included mothers whose infants were born before 32 weeks gestation, between January 2012 and August 2015 at Sheba Medical Center (SMC). Perinatal data were collected retrospectively from infants’ computerized charts. Mothers were approached > 12 months postpartum {{and were asked to}} complete a questionnaire. Those who agreed to participate were asked (during their visit to the follow-up clinic or by phone or mail) to complete a questionnaire regarding mode and duration of BMF as well as reasons for its discontinuation. Mothers were also asked about their pre-partum intentions to feed directly at the breast. Results: Out of 162 eligible mothers, 131 (80. 8 %) initiated BMF during their intensive care unit (ICU) hospitalization. Of these, 66 (50. 3 %) discontinued BMF earlier than six months postpartum. BMF ≥ 6 months was significantly associated with <b>direct</b> <b>feeding</b> at the breast, duration of exclusive BMF, and singleton birth. Regression analysis revealed that <b>direct</b> <b>feeding</b> at the breast (any or only) and duration of BMF exclusivity were the only significant variables associated with BMF duration (Odds ratio (OR) 5. 5 and 95 % confidence interval (CI) 2. 00 – 15. 37; OR 1. 5 and 95 % CI 1. 25 – 1. 88, respectively). Milk supply (inadequate or nonexistent) was the most commonly reported cause for BMF discontinuation < 6 months. <b>Direct</b> <b>feeding</b> at the breast was significantly associated with BMF duration and was more common among singletons. Conclusions: <b>Direct</b> <b>feeding</b> at the breast and duration of exclusive BMF are associated with duration of BMF among infants born < 32 weeks of gestational age (GA). These findings suggest that targeting these two factors may {{play a key role in}} prolonging BMF duration among preterm infants...|$|E
