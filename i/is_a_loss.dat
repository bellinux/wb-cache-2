25|$|PTSD {{descriptions}} fail {{to capture}} {{some of the}} core characteristics of C-PTSD. These elements include captivity, psychological fragmentation, {{the loss of a}} sense of safety, trust, and self-worth, as well as the tendency to be revictimized. Most importantly, there <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>loss</b> of a coherent sense of self: it is this loss, and the ensuing symptom profile, that most pointedly differentiates C-PTSD from PTSD.|$|E

50|$|Since a {{vulnerable}} small slam bid and made is worth between 1370 (6 of a minor) and 1440 (6 notrump), this change {{also means that}} for a non-vulnerable sacrifice, a result of down five (−1100) would show a profit, down six (−1400) might <b>be</b> <b>a</b> small <b>loss</b> or <b>a</b> small gain, and down seven (−1700) would <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>loss.</b> Under the old scoring rules, down seven (−1300) would have <b>been</b> <b>a</b> gain, down eight (−1500) would have <b>been</b> <b>a</b> <b>loss.</b>|$|R

25|$|The {{inclusion}} of the reproduction rights holders was unprecedented in United States copyright law. Almost thirty-nine percent of the royalties collected under the AHRA go not to songwriters and musicians, but to the record labels who own the right to copy and distribute their recordings. The justification for this cross subsidy is that the copying enabled by the digital technology <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>loss</b> of profits for the recording industry, {{and that they should}} be compensated for this loss.|$|E
25|$|If a piece which cannot retreat or move to {{the side}} {{advances}} to the far rank, {{so that it would}} otherwise have no further legal move, it is trapped. These pieces are the pawn, knight, iron general, and lance. In practice this would never occur for pawns or lances, which promote to pieces which keep their old moves, so that there is never any reason to defer their promotion, as stalemate <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>loss</b> for the stalemated player.|$|E
25|$|Prices are as {{a percent}} of the penal sum (the maximum that the surety is liable for) ranging from around one percent to five percent, with the most credit-worthy {{contracts}} paying the least. The bond typically includes an indemnity agreement whereby the principal contractor or others agree to indemnify the surety if there <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>loss.</b> In the United States, the Small Business Administration may guaranty surety bonds; in 2013 the eligible contract tripled to $6.5 million.|$|E

25|$|Flow cytometry {{has several}} {{advantages}} over IHC including: {{the ability to}} define distinct cell populations by their size and granularity; the capacity to gate out dead cells; improved sensitivity; and multi-colour analysis to measure several antigens simultaneously. However, flow cytometry can be less effective at detecting extremely rare cell populations, and there <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>loss</b> of architectural relationships {{in the absence of}} a tissue section. Flow cytometry also has a high capital cost associated with the purchase of a flow cytometer.|$|E
25|$|Brain imaging has {{documented}} cerebral atrophy, which <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>loss</b> of neurons {{in the brain}} and the connections between them. Also documented were problems with the ventricular system in the brain, such as ventricular asymmetry and ventricular enlargement. Hydrocephalus has also been noted in children with 1p36 deletion syndrome. This is basically too much fluid within the brain. Hyperreflexia, which is defined as overactive or overresponsive reflexes in the body, was also found to be common. Many children also have epilepsy which is a disorder of the brain that results in recurrent, unprovoked seizures.|$|E
25|$|Breath-hold {{blackout}} <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>loss</b> {{of consciousness}} caused by cerebral hypoxia {{towards the end}} of a breath-hold dive, when the swimmer does not necessarily experience an urgent need to breathe and has no other obvious medical condition that might have caused it. It can be provoked by hyperventilating just before a dive, or {{as a consequence of the}} pressure reduction on ascent, or a combination of these. Victims are often established practitioners of breath-hold diving, are fit, strong swimmers and have not experienced problems before.|$|E

25|$|After {{seven years}} of pain and hard {{struggle}} it was my hope that the court system would listen to my plea and act as an independent body from the executive branch. Unfortunately, this recent decision and decisions taken on other similar cases, prove that the court system in the United States has become {{more or less a}} tool that the executive branch can easily manipulate through unfounded allegations and fear mongering. If anything, this decision <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>loss</b> to all Americans and to the rule of law.|$|E
25|$|The {{spectrum}} of Lambda Tauri A shows an under abundance of carbon {{relative to the}} norm for this category of star. A possible explanation for this <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>loss</b> of mass by the star {{some time in the}} past. An inner region of the star became depleted by the conversion of carbon into nitrogen during the nuclear fusion process, and this region was later exposed when the outer envelope of the star was lost. Alternatively, the star may have undergone a period of convective mixing, bringing the carbon-depleted material to the surface. However, the cause of such a fully convective behavior in a main sequence star of this mass is unclear.|$|E
25|$|Gassing is {{the process}} of passing yarn, as {{distinct}} from fabric very rapidly through a series of Bunsen gas flames in a gassing frame, in order to burn off the projecting fibres and make the thread round and smooth and also brighter. Only the better qualities of yarn are gassed, such as that used for voiles, poplins, venetians, gabardines, many Egyptian qualities, etc. There <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>loss</b> of weight in gassing, which varies' about 5 to 8 per cent., so that if a 2/60's yarn is required 2/56's would be used. The gassed yarn is darker in shade afterwards, but should not be scorched.|$|E

25|$|Clouds {{initially}} form {{in clear}} air or become clouds when fog rises above surface level. The genus {{of a newly}} formed cloud is determined mainly by air mass characteristics such as stability and moisture content. If these characteristics change over time, the genus tends to change accordingly. When this happens, the original genus is called a mother cloud. If the mother cloud retains much of its original form after {{the appearance of the}} new genus, it is termed a genitus cloud. One example of this is stratocumulus cumulogenitus, a stratocumulus cloud formed by the partial spreading of a cumulus type when there <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>loss</b> of convective lift. If the mother cloud undergoes a complete change in genus, it {{is considered to be a}} mutatus cloud.|$|E
25|$|Anterograde amnesia <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>loss</b> of {{the ability}} to create new {{memories}} after the event that caused the amnesia, leading to a partial or complete inability to recall the recent past, while long-term memories from before the event remain intact. This is in contrast to retrograde amnesia, where memories created prior to the event are lost while new memories can still be created. Both can occur together in the same patient. To a large degree, anterograde amnesia remains a mysterious ailment because the precise mechanism of storing memories is not yet well understood, although it is known that the regions involved are certain sites in the temporal cortex, especially in the hippocampus and nearby subcortical regions.|$|E
25|$|The Mark-to-Market Margin (MTM margin) on {{the other}} hand is the margin {{collected}} to offset losses (if any) that have already been incurred on the positions held by a firm. This is computed as the difference between the cost of the position held and the current market value of that position. If the resulting amount <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>loss,</b> the amount is collected from the firm; else, the amount may be returned to the firm (the case with most clearing houses) or kept in reserve depending on local practice. In either case, the positions are 'marked-to-market' by setting their new cost to the market value used in computing this difference. The positions held by the clients of the exchange are marked-to-market daily and the MTM difference computation for the next day would use the new cost figure in its calculation.|$|E
