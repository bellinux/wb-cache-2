The field was once a massive Permian and Carboniferous reef complex covering an area [...] At its largest point the reservoir contains a gas column [...] deep with a [...] deep oil rim below it. It is estimated to contain [...] of gas and one billion tonnes of liquid condensate and crude oil. Discovered in 1979, it began production under Karachaganckgazprom, a subsidiary of Gazprom. Kazakhgas took over operatorship after the independence of Kazakhstan in 1992. In 1992, AGIP (now Eni) and the then British Gas (who became BG Group, and later acquired by Royal Dutch Shell) were awarded the sole negotiating rights, forming a partnership company. In 1997, Texaco (now Chevron Corporation) and Lukoil signed a production sharing agreement with the original two companies and the Kazakhstan Government. This is a 40-year agreement to develop the field to allow the production to reach world markets. This is done under a partnership company known as Karachaganak Petroleum Operating (KPO) where Royal Dutch Shell and ENI are joint operators with a 29.25% stake each in the company, with Chevron and Lukoil owning 18% and 13.5% respectively. In September 2009 the KPO filed an arbitration case against Kazakhstan.|$|E
