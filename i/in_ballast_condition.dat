40|$|This thesis {{represents}} {{an attempt to}} reveal and explain the mysterious excitation sources which cause global wave induced vibrations of ships. The wave induced vibrations of the hull girder {{are referred to as}} springing when they are associated with a resonance phenomenon, and whipping when they are caused by a transient impact loading. Both phenomena excite the governing vertical 2 -node mode and possibly higher order modes, and consequently increase the fatigue and extreme loading of the hull girder. These effects are currently disregarded in conventional ship design. The thesis focuses on the additional fatigue damage on large blunt ships. The study was initiated by conducting an extensive literature study and by organizing an international workshop. The literature indicated that wave induced vibrations should be expected on any ship type, but full scale documentation (and model tests) was mainly related to blunt ships. While the theoretical investigation of whipping mostly focused on slender vessels with pronounced bow flare, full scale measurements indicated that whipping could be just as important for blunt as for slender ships. Moreover, all estimates dealing with the fatigue damage due to wave induced vibration based on full scale measurements before the year of 2000 were nonconservative due to crude simplifications. The literature on the actual importance of the additional fatigue contribution is therefore scarce. The workshop was devoted to the wave induced vibrations measured onboard a 300 m iron ore carrier. Full scale measurements <b>in</b> <b>ballast</b> <b>condition</b> were compared with numerical predictions from four state-of-the-art hydroelastic programs. The predicted response was unreliable, and the programs in general underestimated the vibration level. The excitation source was either inaccurately described or lacking. The prediction of sea state parameters and high frequency tail behavior of the wave spectra based on wave radars without proper setting and calibration was also questioned. The measurements showed that vibrations <b>in</b> <b>ballast</b> <b>condition</b> were larger than in the cargo condition, the vibration was more correlated with wind speed than wave height, head seas caused higher vibration levels than following seas, the vibration level towards beam seas decayed only slightly, and the damping ratio was apparently linear and about 0. 5 %. The additional vibration damage constituted 44 % of the total measured fatigue loading in deck amidships in the North Atlantic iron ore trade, with prevailing head seas encountered <b>in</b> <b>ballast</b> <b>condition.</b> Four hypotheses, which may contribute to explain the high vibration levels, were formulated. They include the effect of the steady wave field and the interaction with the unsteady wave field, amplification of short incident waves due to bow reflection, bow impacts including the exit phase and sum frequency excitation due to the bow reflection. The first three features were included in a simplified program {{to get an idea of}} the relative importance. The estimates indicated that the stem flare whipping was insignificant <b>in</b> <b>ballast</b> <b>condition,</b> but contributed in cargo condition. The whipping was found to be sensitive to speed. Simplified theory was employed to predict the speed reduction, which was about 5 kn in 5 m significant wave height. The estimated speed reduction was in fair agreement with full scale measurements of the iron ore carrier. Extensive model tests of a large 4 -segmented model of an iron ore carrier were carried out. Two loading conditions with three bow shapes were considered in regular and irregular waves at different speeds. By increasing the forward trim, the increased stem flare whipping was again confirmed to be of less importance than the reduced bottom forces <b>in</b> <b>ballast</b> <b>condition.</b> The bow reflection, causing sum frequency excitation, was confirmed to be important both in ballast and cargo condition. It was less sensitive to speed than linear springing. The second order transfer function amplitude displayed a bichromatic sum frequency springing (at resonance), which was almost constant independent of the frequency difference. The nondimensional monochromatic sum frequency springing response was even higher. The sum frequency pressure was mainly confined to the bow area. Surprisingly, for the sharp triangular bow with vertical stem designed to remove the sum frequency effect, the effect was still pronounced, although smaller. The reflection of incident waves did still occur. In irregular head sea states <b>in</b> <b>ballast</b> <b>condition</b> whipping occurred often due to bottom bilge (flare) impacts, starting with the first vibration cycle in hogging. This was also observed in cargo condition, and evident in full scale. This confirmed that the exit phase, which was often inaccurately represented or lacking in numerical codes, was rather important. Flat bottom slamming was observed at realistic speeds, but the vibratory response was not significantly increased. Stern slamming did not give any significant vibration at realistic forward speeds. The fatigue assessment showed that the relative importance of the vibration damage was reduced for increasing peak period, and secondly that it increased for increasing wave heights due to nonlinearities. All three bows displayed a similar behavior. For the sharp bow, the additional fatigue damage was reduced significantly in steep and moderate to small sea states, but the long term vibration damage was less affected. The effect of the bulb appeared to be small. The contribution of the vibration damage was reduced significantly with speed. For a representative North Atlantic iron ore trade with head sea in ballast and following sea in cargo condition the vibration damage reduced from 51 % at full speed to 19 % at realistic speeds. This was less than measured in full scale, but the damping ratio of 1 - 3. 5 % in model tests was too high, and the wave damage in following seas in cargo condition was represented by head sea states (to high wave damage due to too high encounter frequency). Furthermore, the contribution from vibration damage was observed to increase in less harsh environment from 19 % in the North Atlantic to 26 % in similarWorld Wide trade. This may also be representative for the effect of routing. The dominating wave and vibration damage came from sea states with a significant wave height of 5 m. This was in agreement with full scale results. <b>In</b> <b>ballast</b> <b>condition,</b> the nonlinear sum frequency springing appeared to be more important than the linear springing, and the total springing seemed to be of equivalent importance as the whipping process, which was mainly caused by bottom bilge (flare) impacts. All three effects should be incorporated in numerical tools. In full scale, the vibration response reached an apparently constant level as a function of wave height in both ballast and cargo condition in head seas. This behaviour could be explained by the speed reduction in higher sea states. The vibration level in cargo condition was 60 - 70 % of the level <b>in</b> <b>ballast</b> <b>condition.</b> Although common knowledge implies that larger ships may experience higher springing levels due to a lower eigenfrequency, a slightly smaller ore carrier displayed a higher contribution from the vibration damage (57 %) in the same trade, explained by about 1 m smaller draft. Moreover, the strengthening of the larger ship resulted in a 10 % increase of the 2 -node eigenfrequency. The subsequent measurements confirmed that an increased hull girder stiffness was not an effective means to reduce the relative importance of the vibration damage. The relative importance of the excitation sources causing wave induced vibration may differ considerably for a slender compared to a blunt vessel. Therefore, full scale measurements on a 300 m container vessel were briefly evaluated. The damping ratio was almost twice as high as for several blunt ships, possibly due to significant contribution from the container stacks. The reduced relative importance of the vibration damage with increasing wave height for the iron ore carrier in full scale was opposite to the trend obtained for the container vessel. Less speed reduction in higher sea states was confirmed, and the whipping process was apparently relatively more important for the container vessel. Both for the blunt and slender ship of roughly 300 m length, the total fatigue damage due to vibration was of similar importance as the conventional wave frequency damage. The contribution to fatigue damage from wave induced vibrations should be accounted for, for ships operating in harsh environment with limited effect of routing, especially when they are optimized with respect to minium steel weight. The four hypotheses were all relevant in relation to wave induced vibrations on blunt ships. Further numerical investigation should focus on the sum frequency springing caused by bow reflection and the whipping impacts at the bow quarter. The wave amplification, steady wave elevation and the exit phase must be properly incorporated. When it comes to design by testing, an optimized model size must be selected (wall interaction versus short wave quality). The speed must be selected in combination with sea state. The wave quality must be monitored, and a realistic damping ratio should be confirmed prior to testing. For the purpose of investigating sum frequency excitation, a large restrained bow model tested in higher waves may be utilized to reduce uncertainties in the small measured pressures. dr. ing. dr. ing...|$|E

40|$|There {{has been}} a lot of {{interest}} in trim optimisation to reduce fuel consumption and emissions of ships. Many existing ships are designed for a single operational condition with the aim of producing low resistance at their design speed and draft with an even keel. Given that a ship will often sail outside this condition over its operational life and moreover some vessels such as LNG carriers return <b>in</b> <b>ballast</b> <b>condition</b> in one leg, the effect of trim on ships resistance will be significant. Ship trim optimization analysis has traditionally been done through towing tank testing. Computational techniques have become increasingly popular for design and optimization applications in all engineering disciplines. Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD), is the fastest developing area in marine fluid dynamics as an alternative to model tests. High fidelity CFD methods are capable of modelling breaking waves which is especially crucial for trim optimisation studies where the bulbous bow partially emerges or the transom stern partially immerses. This paper presents a trim optimization study on the Kriso Container Ship (KCS) using computational fluid dynamics (CFD) in conjunction with towing tank tests. A series of resistance tests for various trim angles and speeds were conducted at 1 : 75 scale at design draft. CFD computations were carried out for the same conditions with the hull both fixed and free to sink and trim. Dynamic sinkage and trim add to the computational cost and thus slow the optimisation process. The results obtained from CFD simulations were in good agreement with the experiments. After validating the applicability of the computational model, the same mesh, boundary conditions and solution techniques were used to obtain resistance values for different trim conditions at different Froude numbers. Both the fixed and free trim/sinkage models could predict the trend of resistance with variation of trim angles; however the fixed model failed to measure the absolute values as accurately as the free model. It was concluded that a fixed CFD model, although computationally faster and cheaper, can find the optimum trim angle but cannot predict the amount of savings with very high accuracy. Results concerning the performance of the vessel at different speeds and trim angles were analysed and optimum trim is suggested...|$|E
40|$|The Energy Efficiency Design Index (EEDI), {{quantifying}} {{the amount}} of carbon dioxide emitted per gram fuel consumed, is to be fully implemented in the coming years. Compliance with the EEDI requirements can be achieved in a number of ways. One is to reduce the vessel&# 146;s installed power and thus adopt a lower ship speed. This raises concerns as it might result in inability to control the ship in heavy weather. The International Maritime Organization (IMO) has recognized this, and has implemented an interim guideline for determining the minimum propulsion power required to maintain manoeuvrability in adverse conditions. Here a procedure is presented for calculation of the power required to maintain a speed of 4 knots in adverse conditions. The aim of this thesis has been to evaluate the IMO guideline and hence suggest a method for computing the required minimum propulsion power. The evaluation of the guideline indicates that a vessel&# 146;s ballast condition may be dimensioning for the requirement to installed power. An investigation of accidents that have occurred in adverse weather conditions confirms this. This is due to the increased likelihood of propeller ventilation causing thrust loss. A method considering the effect of ventilation has hence been developed. A hull resistance calculation is performed, in which calm water resistance and added resistance in wind and waves are considered. This gives the basis for calculation of required thrust. A mean thrust loss factor is calculated in the time domain by considering a realization of the relative motion between propeller and waves. The corresponding power required to maintain vessel speed is estimated in the frequency domain. If ventilation is occurring, the requirement to installed power will increase and become dimensioning. The results show that two of the vessels considered, the KVLCC 2 and a chemical tanker, both experience ventilation effects <b>in</b> <b>ballast</b> <b>condition.</b> A third vessel, Norlines, experiences ventilation effects in its design condition. However, according to the calculations, the vessels have sufficiently power installed to maintain a speed of 4 knots in adverse weather conditions. A comparison between experimental and calculated results for Norlines shows deviating results. Reasons may be the limited duration of the experiment and an inaccurate estimate of the thrust deduction factor. The results are questionable. The main reason is that increasing the power does not necessarily lead to increased thrust. This is because increased propeller loading may increase the effect of ventilation further. It is thus recommended to expand the model to include the effect of propeller loading. </p...|$|E
40|$|As {{a result}} of {{increased}} fuel oil prices the fuel cost accounts for an increasingly larger portion of the total operation costs for a vessel. Traditionally the fuel cost has been low compared to costs related to crewing and management, but today it accounts for over 50 % of the total operating cost in some cases. This puts fuel efficiency on the agenda for many ship owners and operators. The attention on fuel efficiency is also driven by the environmental challenges the shipping industry is faced with. To achieve the goal set at the COP 15 meeting about avoiding a 2 &# 176; C increase of the world&# 146;s average temperature, the emission of greenhouse gases has to be reduced by 50 - 85 % by the year 2050. Pollution from shipping is a significant contributor to global warming and the industry needs to become more environmentally friendly to take {{their share of the}} responsibility towards reducing emissions. The overall aim of this thesis has been to investigate if, and how, existing voyage data can be used to improve operational efficiency for a vessel. This has been done with the use of statistical analysis. Multiple regression analysis has been performed in the statistical software Minitab to evaluate which parameters listed in the post voyage data which is best for predicting fuel efficiency. When a good enough model is achieved this is used as a basis for suggesting fuel saving measures. Then the model is used to calculate the new improved fuel efficiency and the result is compared to the initial operational efficiency. This process is first done as an illustrative case with made up data and then performed on real data provided by Westfal-Larsen Management. With the real data it proved difficult to achieve good enough models for predicting fuel efficiency. There is some doubt related {{to the quality of the}} data as there was significant variation in the results. However for the group of voyages between Singapore and the Persian Gulf a model with high goodness-of-fit is achieved. On the basis of this model implementation of trim optimization is considered to be a feasible measure to assess further. All voyages used in this thesis has been done <b>in</b> <b>ballast</b> <b>condition,</b> this gives a better opportunity for trim adjustments. With the trim condition changed to the optimal observed value, the model can predict the new improved fuel efficiency for that particular route. The result is estimated to be around 4 % which does not seem unrealistic compared to other studies. It should however be noted that this estimate is the average value within a certain confidence interval, therefore the potential for fuel saving cannot be estimated with 100 % certainty. But the results still prove that by obtaining a model with high goodness-of-fit valuable information concerning operational efficiency can be extracted from the post voyage data. </p...|$|E

40|$|Master's thesis in Structural engineeringDuring {{the last}} decades {{there have been several}} major ship accidents, and it is {{believed}} that old ships are more unsafe than newer ships. To get a better understanding of this phenomenon the thesis is investigating different issues with ship ageing. This thesis consists of a general description of the most important ageing issues, and the condition of sea water ballast tanks is identified {{as one of the most}} critical issue regarded to ageing on LPG-tankers. This investigation consists of a theoretical description and evaluation of different corrosion mechanisms, fatigue, buckling and steel protection. The different rules and regulation for new build, maintenance and inspection of ballast tanks are discussed, and there have been physical inspections of some ballast tanks on some selected ships (25, 15 and 1 year old ships). A high number of ballast tanks inspection report are reviewed and used as a basis for the conclusions. To demonstrate the importance of proper steel protection, a life time evaluation of critical areas in ballast tanks are carried out. There are five different ageing issues concerning a gas-tanker, seen through a shipping company, as listed below 	Functional ageing 	Technological ageing 	Knowledge based ageing 	Organizational ageing 	Commercial ageing Market related Every one of the ageing mechanisms can affect the lifetime of the ship in different ways. Commercial ageing can be the most fixed ageing mechanism, where the charterer sets a maximum age on ships they will charter. The major oil and gas companies have a maximum age on gas-tankers to be 20 – 25 years old, regardless of the actual condition of the ship. Most of the oil and gas companies require the ships to be in better condition than minimum class requirement, and require ships older than 15 years old to have a Condition Assessment Program – CAP rating of 1 or 2, where CAP 1 is very good condition, CAP 3 is class limit, and CAP 4 is below class limit. Concerning functional ageing, the sea water ballast tanks are a weak link. The ballast tanks have a very corrosive environment with sea water when filled and a humid salty environment when empty. There are (from 2006) strict requirements for coating in ballast tanks called Performance Standard for Protective Coating – PSPC, in addition cathodic protection can be used. This study shows that the top of the wing ballast tanks are the most critical area concerning heavy corrosion in case of coating breakdown. This due to: 	Good supply of oxygen <b>in</b> <b>ballast</b> <b>condition</b> because the tank will in most cases not be filled to the top, and therefore no protection from the offer anodes. 	Moist and salty environment with good supply of oxygen in loaded condition (empty for water) I. e. the cathodic protection is not effective. Rules and regulations require the ship owner to have maintenance and inspection routines of all the important parts of the ship. In Solvang the chief officer inspects all the ballast tanks every 6 th months. The ballast tank inspections that are reviewed show a varying degree of corrosion on the different ships. The maintenance procedures have been updated lately due to problems with coating breakdown shortly after coating maintenance. From the review of the ballast tank condition it seems clear that often the identified corrosion was left unrepaired. The best practice would be to maintain the corrosion spot right away, and prevent the corrosion to expand. If not, the coating will demand more extensive maintenance later. The reasons for postponement of maintenance in ballast tanks can be many. With regard to all the ship accidents that have happened the last 50 years, very few of them are directly caused by ageing mechanisms such as corrosion and fatigue. After MV Flare, MV Erika and MV Prestige which sank in 1998, 1999 and 2002 respectively, there have not (known to the undersigned) been any major ship disasters caused by ageing mechanisms. There have been other accidents such as groundings, collisions and collapse of hull due to bad design, but that type of accidents is not of interest in this thesis. The few accidents in the later years indicates that the rules and requirement regulating the shipping industry (IMO, IACS, class societies, flag state, port control, vetting. etc.) are showing a real effect on the accident rate concerning ageing mechanisms. MV Flare was a bulk carrier, and MV Erika and MV Prestige were oil tankers which sank due to ageing mechanisms. No liquefied gas tankers are known (to undersigned) to sink due to ageing mechanisms. This means that the assumption that an older LPG-tanker may be more unsafe due to ageing not is the case. It is not the age, but the overall condition that decides if the ship is unsafe or not. To evaluate the effect of coating breakdown in ballast tanks some simplified evaluations for buckling capacity and fatigue life were carried out. With localized corrosion that often appears in ballast tanks, the results found showed that the local buckling capacity may be reduced severely in a relatively short period of time. (~ 5 years) Two different approaches for calculating the fatigue life have been used. The calculations show that the approach for offshore structures give approximately 50 % of the fatigue life compared to the ship rules, in corrosive environment. Both methods show that the fatigue life reduces drastically with coating breakdown...|$|E
