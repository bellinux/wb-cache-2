40|$|Abstract—Energy buffering, using {{energy storage}} devices (ESD), {{can help to}} smooth {{renewable}} and cut the electricity bill in Internet data centers. Recent works demonstrate the efficiency of this scheme which comes from matching the power demand of servers with low-cost and green power supply by leveraging the long-term variation of workload and renewable. However, given the variation in efficiencies of the ESDs, short term and long term variation in renewable energy, workload and energy pricing a multi-tier management is required to closely match the green and low-cost power availability with the demand. This paper proposes a multi-tier workload and <b>energy</b> <b>buffering</b> management technique that frames each tier as an optimization problem and solves them in an online and proactive way using Receding Horizon Control(RHC). The paper also conducts an analytical study to illustrate the benefits of multi-tier <b>energy</b> <b>buffering</b> management versus one tier <b>energy</b> <b>buffering</b> management in terms of increasing the renewable utilization. Analytical and simulation studies show that multitier <b>energy</b> <b>buffering</b> management can increase the utilization of the renewables {{as much as two}} times compared to one-tier management depending on the available renewable energy and power demand magnitude and variation.

40|$|The {{onset of}} {{respiration}} in the cyanobacteria Anacystis nidulans and Nostoc sp. strain Mac upon {{a shift from}} dark anaerobic to aerobic conditions was accompanied by rapid energization of the adenylate pool (owing to the combined action of ATP synthase and adenylate kinase) and also the guanylate, uridylate, and cytidylate pools (owing to nucleoside diphosphate and nucleoside monophosphate kinases). Rates of the various transphosphorylation reactions were comparable to the rate of oxidative phosphorylation, thus explaining, in part, low approximately P/O ratios which incorporate adenylates only. The increase of ATP, GTP, UTP, and CTP levels (nanomoles per minute per milligram [dry weight]) in oxygen-pulsed cells of A. nidulans and Nostoc species was calculated to be, on average, 2. 3, 1. 05, 0. 8, and 0. 57, respectively. Together with aerobic steady-state pool sizes of 1. 35, 0. 57, 0. 5, and 0. 4 nmol/mg (dry weight) for these nucleotides, a fairly uniform turnover of 1. 3 to 1. 5 min- 1 was derived. All types of nucleotides, therefore, may be conceived of as being in equilibrium with each other, reflecting the energetic homeostasis or <b>energy</b> <b>buffering</b> of the (respiring) cyanobacterial cell. For the calculation of net efficiencies of oxidative phosphorylation in terms of approximately P/O ratios, this <b>energy</b> <b>buffering</b> was taken into account. Moreover, in A. nidulans an additional 30 % of the energy initially conserved in ATP by oxidative phosphorylation was immediately used up by a plasma membrane-bound reversible H+-ATPase for H+ extrusion. Consequently, by allowing for <b>energy</b> <b>buffering</b> and ATPase-linked H+ extrusion, maximum P/O ratios of 2. 6 to 3. 3 were calculated. By contrast, in Nostoc sp. all the H+ extrusion, appeared {{to be linked to}} a plasma membrane-bound respiratory chain, thus bypassing any ATP formation and leading to P/O ratios of only 1. 3 to 1. 5 despite the correction for <b>energy</b> <b>buffering...</b>|$|E

In {{this study we}} show {{for the first time}} functional expression of two phosphagen kinase systems in Saccharomyces cerevisiae, which does not normally contain such systems. First, to establish the creatine kinase system, in addition to overexpressing creatine kinase isoenzymes, we had to install the biosynthesis pathway of creatine by co-overexpression of L-arginine:glycine amidinotransferase and guanidinoacetate methyltransferase. Although we could achieve considerable creatine kinase activity, together with more than 3 mM intracellular creatine, this was not sufficient to confer an obvious advantage to the yeast under the specific stress conditions examined here. Second, using arginine kinase, we successfully installed an intracellular phosphagen pool of about 5 mM phosphoarginine. Such arginine kinase-expressing yeast showed improved resistance under two stress challenges that drain cellular energy, which were transient pH reduction and starvation. Although transient starvation led to 50 % reduced intracellular ATP concentrations in wild-type yeast, arginine kinase overexpression stabilized the ATP pool at the pre-stress level. Thus, our results demonstrate that temporal <b>energy</b> <b>buffering</b> is an intrinsic property of phosphagen kinases that can be transferred to phylogenetically very distant organisms...|$|E

It was also noted that choosing small buffer stiffness of the buffer or self-stopping mechanism could slightly limit the peak displacements, at cost of a small increment of the deck accelerations and non-remarkable variations of internal forces.

40|$|Abstract—Micro-inverters {{operating}} {{into the}} single-phase grid from solar photovoltaic (PV) panels or other low-voltage sources must buffer the twice-line-frequency variations between the energy sourced by the PV panel and that {{required for the}} grid. Moreover, in addition to operating over wide average power ranges, they inherently operate {{over a wide range}} of voltage conversion ratios as the line voltage traverses a cycle. These factors make the design of micro-inverters challenging. This paper presents a Multilevel Energy Buffer and Voltage Modulator (MEB) that significantly reduces the range of voltage conversion ratios that the dc-ac converter portion of the micro-inverter must operate over by stepping its effective input voltage in pace with the line voltage. The MEB partially replaces the original bulk input capacitor, and functions as an active energy buffer to reduce the total size of the twice-line-frequency <b>energy</b> <b>buffering</b> capacitance. The small additional loss of the MEB can be compensated by the improved efficiency of the dc-ac converter stage, leading to a higher overall system efficiency. The MEB architecture can be implemented in a variety of manners, allowing different design tradeoffs to be made. A prototype micro-inverter incorporating an MEB, designed for 27 V to 38 V dc input voltage, 230 V rms ac output voltage, and rated for a line cycle average power of 70 W, has been built and tested in a grid-connected mode. It is shown that the MEB can successfully enhance the performance of a single-phase grid-interfaced micro-inverter by increasing its efficiency and reducing the total size of the twice-line-frequency <b>energy</b> <b>buffering</b> capacitance.

The efficient, regulated transport of mitochondria along axons to synapses is therefore crucial for maintaining function. The trafficking kinesin protein (TRAK) /Milton family of proteins comprises kinesin adaptors that have been implicated in the neuronal trafficking of mitochondria via their association with the mitochondrial protein Miro and kinesin motors. In this study, we used gene silencing by targeted shRNAi and dominant negative approaches in conjunction with live imaging to investigate the contribution of endogenous TRAKs, TRAK 1 and TRAK 2, to the transport of mitochondria in axons of hippocampal pyramidal neurons.

How these diverse functions are coordinated {{among the hundreds of}} mitochondria in a given cell is largely unknown, but is probably dependent on the dynamic nature of mitochondria. In this review, we explore the latest developments in mitochondrial dynamics in mammals. These studies indicate that mitofusins and OPA 1 are essential for mitochondrial fusion, whereas Fis 1 and Drp 1 are essential for mitochondrial fission. The overall morphology of the mitochondrial population depends on the relative activities of these two sets of proteins. In addition to the regulation of mitochondrial shape, these molecules also play important roles in cell and tissue physiology. Perturbation of mitochondrial fusion results in defects in mitochondrial membrane potential and respiration, poor cell growth and increased susceptibility to cell death. These cellular observations may explain why mitochondrial fusion is essential for embryonic development. Two inherited neuropathies, Charcot–Marie–Tooth type 2 A and autosomal dominant optic atrophy, are caused by mutations in mitofusin 2 and OPA 1, suggesting that proper regulation of mitochondrial dynamics is particularly vital to neurons. Mitochondrial fission accompanies several types of apoptotic cell death and appears important for progression of the apoptotic pathway.

Mice deficient in muscle- and mitochondrial-CK (M/Mt-CK(-/-)) have previously been described, but exhibit an unexpectedly mild phenotype of compensated left ventricular (LV) hypertrophy. We hypothesised that heart failure would develop with age and performed echocardiography and LV haemodynamics at 1  year. Since all previous studies have utilised mice with a mixed genetic background, we backcrossed for > 10 generations on to C 57 BL/ 6, and repeated the in vivo investigations. Male M/Mt-CK(-/-) mice on the mixed genetic background developed congestive heart failure as evidenced by significantly elevated end-diastolic pressure, impaired contractility, LV dilatation, hypertrophy and pulmonary congestion. Female mice were less severely affected, only showing trends for these parameters. After backcrossing, M/Mt-CK(-/-) mice had LV dysfunction consisting of impaired isovolumetric pressure changes and reduced contractile reserve, but did not develop congestive heart failure. Body weight was lower in knockout mice {{as a consequence of}} reduced total body fat. LV weight was not significantly elevated in relation to other internal organs and gene expression of LVH markers was normal, suggesting an absence of hypertrophy. In conclusion, the consequences of CK deficiency are highly dependent on genetic modifiers, gender and age.

40|$|Abstract—Electrolytic {{capacitors}} {{are often}} used for <b>energy</b> <b>buffering</b> applications, including buffering between single-phase ac and dc. While these capacitors have high energy density compared to film and ceramic capacitors, their life is limited. This paper presents a stacked switched capacitor (SSC) energy buffer architecture {{and some of its}} topological embodiments, which when used with longer life film capacitors overcome this limitation while achieving effective energy densities comparable to electrolytic capacitors.

40|$|Due {{to severe}} {{variation}} in load demand over time, utility companies generally raise electrical energy price during periods of high load demand. A grid-connected hybrid electrical energy storage (HEES) system can help residential users lower their electric bills by storing energy during low-price hours and releasing the stored energy during high-price hours. A HEES system consists {{of different types of}} electrical energy storage (EES) elements, utilizing the benefits of each type while hiding their weaknesses. This paper presents a residential energy management system to maximize the annual profits on residential electric bills, based on a HEES system comprised of a lead-acid battery bank as the main storage bank and a Li-ion battery bank as the energy buffer. We first derive the optimal daily energy management policy based on <b>energy</b> <b>buffering</b> to minimize the daily energy cost. Next, we find the near-optimal design specifications of the energy management system, aiming at maximizing the amortized annual profits under practical constraints. We show that this system achieves averagely 11. 10 % more profits compared to the none-buffering HEES system...|$|E
40|$|The aim of {{this review}} {{was to examine the}} {{mechanisms}} by which physical activity and inactivity modify muscle fatigue. It is well known that acute or chronic increases in physical activity result in structural, metabolic, hormonal, neural and molecular adaptations that increase the level of force or power that can be sustained by a muscle. These adaptations depend on the type, intensity and volume of the exercise stimulus, but recent studies have highlighted the role of high intensity, short duration exercise as a time-efficient method to achieve both anaerobic and aerobic/endurance type adaptations. The factors that determine the fatigue profile of a muscle during intense exercise include muscle fibre composition, neuromuscular characteristics high <b>energy</b> metabolite stores, <b>buffering</b> capacity, ionic regulation, capillarization and mitochondrial density. Muscle fiber type transformation during exercise training is usually towards the intermediate type IIA at the expense of both type I and type IIx myosin heavy chain isoforms. High intensity training results in increases of both glycolyic and oxidative enzymes, muscle capilarization, improved phosphocreatine resynthesis and regulation of K+, H+ and lactate ions. Decreases of the habitual activity level due to injury or sedentary lifestyle result in partial or even compete reversal of the adaptations due to previous training, manifested by reductions in fibre cross-sectional area, decreased oxidative capacity and capillarization. Complete immobilization due to injury results in markedly decreased force output and fatigue resistance. Muscle unloading reduces electromyographic activity and causes muscle atrophy and significant decreases in capillarization and oxidative enzymes activity. The last part of the review discusses the beneficial effects of intermittent high intensity exercise training in patients with different health conditions to demonstrate the powerful effect exercise on health and well being...|$|R
40|$|During the {{development}} of the cortex neurons must migrate from their sites of birth to their final destinations. There are two main types of migration in the developing cortex, the radial migration of pyramidal neurons and the non-radial migration of cortical interneurons. There are limited studies directly comparing these two migration processes, and thus our understanding for perturbations that are selective to either non-radial versus radial migration is limited. Understanding causes of disruption of interneuron migration specifically is clinically relevant due to several interneuron specific developmental diseases. There is a growing body of literature observing a link between interneuron disorders and mitochondrial dysfunction, and thus regulation of mitochondria and their functions are promising targets for identifying selective effects on interneuron development. Mitochondria are organelles serving multiple functions in cells, including <b>energy</b> production, calcium <b>buffering,</b> redox homeostasis, and regulation of cell death. Although mitochondria are known to play essential roles in maintaining neuronal health and function in the adult brain, the importance of mitochondria during neuronal development is poorly understood. ^ Using in vitro mouse brain explant and slice culture systems, we observed distinct localization patterns of mitochondria between interneurons and pyramidal neurons. Mitochondria in migrating interneurons move cyclically throughout the cell during the migration process while remaining in front of the nucleus in migrating radial neurons. Fluorescence immunohistochemistry confirmed these localization patterns in embryonic mouse brains in vivo. ^ We then applied pharmacologic tools to disrupt mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation and discovered that interneuron migration is profoundly sensitive to these disruptions compared to radially migrating pyramidal neurons. This was confirmed by examination of a genetic model of compromised oxidative phosphorylation (Ant 1). Interneurons with compromised mitochondrial function exhibit decreased migration, increased changes in direction, increased trailing process length, changes in branching behavior, and shifts in centrosome positioning. ^ We then utilized a dominant negative form of Miro 1, a protein involved in mitochondrial trafficking to alter mitochondrial trafficking behavior. We also observed increased direction changes and reduced ability of interneurons to invade the cortex. However, interneuron migration rate was unaffected. The changes in cell migration behavior suggest that mitochondria {{play a central role in}} maintaining interneuron cell polarity to allow for progressive interneuron migration during their long journey. ^ These data collectively support a model in which mitochondrial perturbations have a selective effect on interneuron migration. This work suggests that neuronal deficits occurring in mitochondrial disorders are not exclusively due to neuronal metabolic insufficiency in postnatal stages, but can also have developmental origins. ...|$|R
40|$|<b>Energy</b> <b>buffering</b> {{systems are}} key for {{homeostasis}} during variations in energy supply. Spiders {{are the most}} important predators for insects and therefore key in terrestrial ecosystems. From biomedical interest, spiders are important for their venoms and as a source of potent allergens, such as arginine kinase (AK, EC 2. 7. 3. 3). AK is an enzyme crucial for energy metabolism, keeping the pool of phosphagens in invertebrates, and also an allergen for humans. In this work, we studied AK from the Argentininan spider Polybetes pythagoricus (PpAK), from its complementary DNA to the crystal structure. The PpAK cDNA from muscle was cloned, and it is comprised of 1068 nucleotides that encode a 384 -amino acids protein, similar to other invertebrate AKs. The apparent Michaelis-Menten kinetic constant (Km) was 1. 7 mM with a kcat of 75 s− 1. Two crystal structures are presented, the apoPvAK and PpAK bound to arginine, both in the open conformation with the active site lid (residues 310 – 320) completely disordered. The guanidino group binding site in the apo structure appears to be organized to accept the arginine substrate. Finally, these results contribute to knowledge of mechanistic details of the function of arginine kinase...|$|E
