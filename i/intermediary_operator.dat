Motivated {{to remove the}} <b>intermediary</b> <b>operator,</b> he invented the first automatic telephone exchange in 1889 and received its patent in 1891. It is reported that he initially constructed a model of his invention from a round collar box and some straight pins.|$|E
40|$|Like all {{migration}}, {{skilled migration}} depends on <b>intermediary</b> <b>operators</b> providing services that assist the mobility, labour market entry {{and integration of}} migrant workers. However, within what is a relatively disparate body of literature on migrant work, there is often either a complete neglect, or only fragmented acknowledgement and analysis of how migration intermediaries influence migrantsâ€™ access to destination labour markets. By re-engaging with the literature on skilled migration, the authors highlight the importance of new theorizing and empirical investigations into the labour market implications of intermediary activities, which at present remain poorly understood. Most particularly, this article highlights how migration intermediaries shape recruitment, selection and placement, thereby in part determining labour market outcomes for particular groups of migrant workers. commercial intermediaries; labour market segmentation; skilled migratio...|$|R

Watson at 333 Grant Avenue in San Francisco. This process, nevertheless, involved five <b>intermediary</b> telephone <b>operators</b> and took 23 minutes to connect by manually patching in {{the route of the}} call.|$|R

40|$|Given {{that food}} prices {{have tended to}} {{increase}} {{over the past few}} years, the pur-pose of this chapter is to examine the employment and distributional impacts of this trend in developing countries. On the positive side, higher food prices could benefit many developing and emerging economies where a large propor-tion of the labour force is engaged in agriculture (the “agricultural-income effect”). On the negative side, higher food prices could aggravate the income inequalities identified in Chapter 1 and poverty within vulnerable groups, such as urban net buyers and rural smallholders (the “poverty effect”). •	 The chapter finds that the (positive) agricultural-income effect has been small. First, the gains from higher food prices have accrued disproportionately to <b>intermediaries</b> and <b>operators</b> in financial markets, rather than to small pro-ducers. Indeed, food commodities have become a major financial product. The amount invested in commodity funds has risen from US$ 13 billion in 2003 to US$ 352 billion in May 2011. The rates of return from commodity funds of seven major investors in 2011 range between 6 and 38 per cent. The total com-modity return for one of the big investors rose by 84 per cent between 2003 and 2008. In general, during the same period, the prices paid to food pro-ducers increased less. For example, producer prices for staple foods increased by between 10 and 20 per cent in Brazil, Cameroon and Mali; and by betwee...|$|R
40|$|The {{present study}} aims to analyse the Tourism Supply Chain Management {{based on the}} {{published}} articles, available statistical data and the conducted research among the par- ticipants of the Tourism Industry (service provider/tour <b>operator,</b> <b>intermediaries,</b> cus- tomers). The paper has a goal to present a deeper insight into the factors affecting {{the choice of the}} distribution channel proposing a model based on the accumulated informa- tion regarding the tourism services distribution. In the research we pay a special atten- tion to the analysis of the factors motivating customers to choose traditional intermedi- aries at the time when all the operations can be done through the Internet. This problem would be analysed from both service provider and customers personal approach. The model also includes the future perspective of the development in the field of e-Tourism. The major contribution of this paper is the confrontation of the customers real prefer- ences and company‟s strategies with published earlier empirical research...|$|R
40|$|Wine tourism has {{attracted}} the attention of scholars; however it seems that the topic has been primarily researched by adopting a demand-side perspective in order to study the profile of travellers. As a result, the supply-side perspective remains quite under-researched. From the literature that addressed this topic, some have studied the networks and the strategic alliances developed in different wine routes (Brás, Costa, & Buhalis, 2010; Telfer, 2001). Although these studies have focused on organisational structures that have received particular attention in the tourism management and marketing literature, they have only emphasised some of the stakeholders who are involved in a wine route (i. e. the businesses working in the wine industry) and there are many more (for example, local and regional authorities, wine industry marketers, channel <b>intermediaries,</b> agro-tourism <b>operators</b> etc). Thus all the actors from the tourism industry have not been taken into account. In addition, the aforementioned studies did not pay attention to the factors that can facilitate or hinder the development of an effective wine tourism destination. Network success can be seen to hinge not just on producers and (for example, regional) funding arrangements, but is also reliant on the interplay {{of a wide range of}} parties who can be seen to often take up the role of network ‘blockers’ and ‘facilitators’ of activities (Hingley, Lindgreen & Beverland, 2010); and as such, network success is reliant on combination of the roles of stakeholders and notably influenced by channel leads. As a result, this research aims at studying three different Italian wine routes in order to assess what are the factors that influence the successful development of a wine route and of collaboration among stakeholders. By so doing this research will fill the gap highlighted by Getz (2000) who suggested the need for research to focus...|$|R
40|$|In this paper, I analyse {{the conduct}} of {{business}} rules included in the Directive on Markets in Financial Instruments (MiFID) which has replaced the Investment Services Directive (ISD). These rules, in addition to being part of the regulation of investment intermediaries, operate as contractual standards in the relationships between intermediaries and their clients. While the need to harmonise similar rules is generally acknowledged, in the present paper I ask whether the Lamfalussy regulatory architecture, which governs securities lawmaking in the EU, has in some way improved regulation in this area. In section II, I examine the general aspects of the Lamfalussy process. In section III, I critically analyse the MiFID s provisions on conduct of business obligations, best execution of transactions and client order handling, taking into account the new regime of trade internalisation by investment intermediaries and the ensuing competition between these <b>intermediaries</b> and market <b>operators.</b> In sectionIV, I draw some general conclusions on the re-regulation made under the Lamfalussy regulatory structure and its limits. In this section, I make a few preliminary comments on the relevance of {{conduct of business rules}} to contract law, the ISD rules of conduct and the role of harmonisation. ...|$|R
40|$|This Chapter {{addresses}} the uncertainty and the still unclear judicial standards for assessing contributory trademark infringement in the United States. The Chapter proceeds as follows. Part II outlines the {{developments of the}} doctrine of contributory trademark infringement, first in the brick-and-mortar world and subsequently in the online context. Based upon this analysis, Part III criticizes the uncertainty that surrounds the application of the judicial standards to determine contributory infringement, particularly in the online market place. Part III also attempts to provide some explanations for the current judicial decisions and highlights that courts seem to apply a “we know it when we see it” standard to identify contributory trademark infringers. Notably, Part III states that courts seem to distinguish between intermediaries who acted in “good faith” and who are generally not held liable for contributory infringement, and intermediaries who acted in “bad faith” and profited from the infringement, and who are held liable for contributory infringement. Part III concludes that although this judicial line of reasoning may prevent broader liability for “good” intermediaries, all <b>intermediaries</b> and legal <b>operators</b> would benefit from a clearer interpretation of the current standards in this important area of trademark law...|$|R
40|$|International {{audience}} This {{article focuses}} on the possible implications of the McFadden decision by the Court of Justice of the European Union (CJEU) on the development and sustainability of community networks (CNs). CNs provide internet connectivity through open wi-fi, normally based on distributed infrastructure and wireless technologies, that enable users to create an open, community owned and run, network. CNs constitute a grassroots alternative to commercial internet service providers (ISPs) : as infrastructure commons, they {{have the potential to}} be participatory, democratic, and more respectful of communications privacy. The possibility of offering open wi-fi {{is one of the main}} issues at stake in the McFadden case. This article explains how the CJEU decision is likely to affect the fate and the design of CNs. Particular attention is paid to the effect of the decision on the organisational shaping of CNs in Europe and structural changes CNs may have to consider implementing: (a) the donation policy, the fee or absence thereof, as the decision refers to the commercial status of providers; (b) the legal status (network <b>operator,</b> <b>intermediary,</b> internet service provider) and the existence of a legal representative, or the absence thereof in the case of very decentralised CNs; (c) possible warranties and disclaimers contained in the service Terms of Use; (d) the technological decentralised architecture, impacting and impacted by possible password, data retention and registration obligations. After describing what are CNs and how they work (part 2), the article presents the liability challenges for CNs and in particular the hurdles to assign liability (part 3) and the specific situation of the ‘Störerhaftung’, the legal doctrine that provides that a wi-fi operator is responsible for users’ wrongdoings in Germany, the jurisdiction of origin of the McFadden case. The article then analyses in detail the McFadden decision (part 4) and its implications for the organisational shaping of CNs according to selected design features (part 5). It finally draws some conclusions on future scenarios (part 6) ...|$|R
