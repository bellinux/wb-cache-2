50|$|Rising {{groundwater}} {{levels may}} reduce the available hydraulic head (or vertical distance) causing <b>gravitational</b> <b>water</b> flow away from the disposal trench. Effluent initially flowing downward from the disposal trench ultimately encounters groundwater or impermeable rock or clay requiring a directional shift to horizontal movement away from the drain field. A certain vertical distance is required between the effluent level in the disposal trench and the water level where the effluent is leaving the drain field for gravitational force to overcome viscous frictional forces resisting flow through porous soil. Effluent levels {{in the vicinity of}} the drain field will appear to rise toward the ground surface to preserve that vertical distance difference if groundwater levels surrounding the drain field approach the level of effluent in the disposal trench.|$|E
50|$|A flooded {{field will}} drain the <b>gravitational</b> <b>water</b> under the {{influence}} of gravity until water's adhesive and cohesive forces resist further drainage at which point it is said to have reached field capacity. At that point, plants must apply suction to draw water from a soil. The water that plants may draw from the soil is called the available water. Once the available water is used up the remaining moisture is called unavailable water as the plant cannot produce sufficient suction to draw that water in. A plant must produce suction that increases from zero for a flooded field to 1/3 bar at field dry condition (one bar is a little less than one atmosphere pressure). At 15 bar suction, wilting percent, seeds will not germinate, plants begin to wilt and then die. Water moves in soil {{under the influence}} of gravity, osmosis and capillarity. When water enters the soil, it displaces air from some of the pores, since air content of a soil is inversely related to its water content.|$|E

High correlation of values of these differences with abnormal contents of elements in ores and water flows of dispersion shows, that source of these elements are enclosing rocks. Presence of granitization fields in structure of all investigated deposits shows, that extraction of elements from enclosing rocks {{occurs as a result}} of their granitization. It is supposed, that transfer of elements is carried out by pore solutions, and their deposition occurs as a result of nonequilibrium state between pore and <b>gravitational</b> <b>waters...</b>|$|R

50|$|The {{following}} description {{applies to}} a loam soil and agricultural crops. When a field is flooded, {{it is said}} to be saturated and all available air space is occupied by water. The suction required to draw water into a plant root is zero. As the field drains under the influence of gravity (drained water is called <b>gravitational</b> <b>water</b> or drain-able water), the suction a plant must produce to use such water increases to 1/3 bar. At that point, the soil is said to have reached field capacity, and plants that use the water must produce increasingly higher suction, finally up to 15 bar. At 15 bar suction, the soil water amount is called wilting percent. At that suction the plant cannot sustain its water needs as water is still being lost from the plant by transpiration; the plant's turgidity is lost, and it wilts. The next level, called air-dry, occurs at 1000 bar suction. Finally the oven dry condition is reached at 10,000 bar suction. All water below wilting percentage is called unavailable water.|$|E
50|$|Briggs was {{a modern}} {{practitioner}} with {{a flair for}} modern methods and modern ideas. He understood the correlation between life expectancy, {{public health and the}} living conditions of the people; he understood the relationship between dirt and infection. In his endeavour {{to improve the quality of}} life of the people he championed many social reforms. He was largely responsible for the introduction of the Overwater <b>Gravitational</b> <b>Water</b> Scheme, from which Aspatria and Silloth draw their drinking water. He also proposed the laying of sewers within Aspatria; thus eliminating a major source of the prevailing insanitary conditions that directly led to the epidemic killer diseases, Cholera and Typhoid. He also challenged the evils of acute household overcrowding. When the opportunity arose, he encouraged the Urban District Council to build two successful housing schemes in the district. On one occasion he had the satisfaction of reporting the lowest death rate of any other urban district in England and Wales, upon which he received many congratulations from the medical fraternity. Briggs practiced medicine at a time when the country doctor was expected to be a ‘master of all trades’; he was not a GP in the modern sense, hospitalisation in rural communities was rare, if not unheard of. He had to contend with a variety of epidemics in addition to the Coal mining and agricultural accidents, many of which required major surgery and amputations.|$|E

A Krupp ball mill reground the coarser parts of the battery pulp. All the pumps were replaced by new return pumps throughout the mill. The bases of the vanners were built in and the brickwork of the Merton furnace was repaired and relined. A slime buddle was also put in to deal more efficiently with the overflow slimes. The gravitation water supply was brought by wooden fluming about 2 km up the river, except at times of reduced flow, when a system of pumping from, and returning to a dam in the river was resorted to.

40|$|In this study, natural colloids {{circulating}} in <b>gravitational</b> <b>waters</b> {{were collected in}} situ with zero-tension lysimeters from different type of soils located {{in the same area}} contaminated by trace metals (Zn, Cd, and Pb). An agricultural soil (Luvisol), a forest soil (Podzol) and a soil under a metallophyte grassland (Luvisol) were chosen. Characterisation and localisation of trace metals on colloids were performed by transmission electron microscopy coupled with Energy Dispersive X-ray Analysis (AEM). Mobile colloids were found to be different according to soil type and land use. In the podzol, organic colloidal matter migrates in association with Fe and Al. In the luvisols the nature of colloids is closely linked to the leaching of clay and iron. Colloids containing Zn were organic (bacteria) or mineral (phyllosilicates, Fe-oxyhydroxydes and Ca- or Al-phosphates). 70 to 90 % of Pb was present in colloidal form except for the forest soil whereas Zn and Cd were mostly in dissolved form. The partitioning of metals in solutions in different fractions according to their metal form stability was done by an ion exchange method. Pb was in the form of stable or slowly labile complexes whereas Zn and Cd were essentially in the form of free ion or labile complexes. The stability of Pb-forms and the main presence of colloidal forms of Pb can be related in soil solutions. Consequently colloids seem to be implicated in the Pb transfer in soils whereas their role for Zn and Cd seem to be minor depending on soil type...|$|R

40|$|ABSTRACT: The {{objective}} {{of this research is}} to determine the heat, air, and moisture conditions of slab-on-ground of a heated building. Measurements show that the coarse-grained fill or drainage layers beneath heated slab-on-ground struc-tures are warm and moist throughout the year. Moisture migration: <b>gravitational</b> <b>water,</b> ground water table, capillary action and diffusion, keep these layer moist throughout the year. The water vapor content of the warm and moist fill layer is usually higher than the content of the indoor air. Thus, the diffusion flow is directed into the indoor air, despite the existing heat flow into the opposite direction, and the ground is a moisture source for the structures above. Therefore, thermal and moisture conditions of the fill layers have the major effect on the overall moisture behavior of ground slabs: on the drying times of the fresh in situ cast concrete slab, and on the thermal and moisture behavior of the structure in normal long-term conditions. These conditions are also favorable for microbe growth, which is very common in fill layers. Fungal or bacterial growth was detected in 98 % of the test specimens taken beneath the ground slabs of heated buildings. These conditions...|$|E

Studies were performed in southwestern Oregon under young stands of whiteleaf manzanita, ponderosa pine, Douglas-fir and Pacific madrone. RLD analysis shows that more then one quarter of the total root length of ericaceous plants is located in the rock layer. Stepwise procedures identified the best fitting multiple-regression model for relating RLD to depth, bulk density of rock and the space penetrable by roots (SPR). Linear expressions of SPR and depth were found to be significant explanatory variables. Roots of manzanita and madrone occupy rock fissures as small as 100 urn.

40|$|International audienceThe {{migration}} of particles smaller than 2 mm in soil pores {{is responsible for}} the preferential transfer of various contaminants and for soil textural differentiation in Luvisols. Aggregation vs. dispersion mechanisms of clay particles are suspected {{to play a major role}} in this migration process. However, these mechanisms have mostly been studied with respect to pure and well-crystallized clay minerals rather than pedogenetic particles and have often been performed under physicochemical conditions, which are poorly representative of soil conditions. We studied the respective impacts of pH and Ca concentration on aggregation and dispersion behavior of clay particles in a Luvisol under conditions encountered in the soil solution. Both static and dynamic approaches were followed in studying particle interactions and dynamics under transient phenomena. Based on these experiments, we have drawn a phase diagram for soil clays as a function of pH and Ca concentrations and have identified mechanisms associated with the formation of these different phases. We find that soil particle behavior in suspensions is similar to that recorded for model clays in that they are driven by both pH and Ca concentrations. These two parameters are interrelated and tend to favor aggregation at higher Ca concentrations and/or lower pH. These effects are reversible over the <b>gravitational</b> <b>water</b> time scale, with the exception of dilution-induced dispersion.
