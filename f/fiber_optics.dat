5|$|Early {{means of}} {{communicating}} over a distance included visual signals, such as beacons, smoke signals, semaphore telegraphs, signal flags, and optical heliographs. Other examples of pre-modern long-distance communication included audio messages such as coded drumbeats, lung-blown horns, and loud whistles. 20th and 21st century technologies for long-distance communication usually involve electrical and electromagnetic technologies, such as telegraph, telephone, and teleprinter, networks, radio, microwave transmission, <b>fiber</b> <b>optics,</b> and communications satellites.|$|E
5|$|Interferometry is {{a family}} of {{techniques}} in which waves, usually electromagnetic waves, are superimposed causing the phenomenon of interference in order to extract information. Interferometry is an important investigative technique {{in the fields of}} astronomy, <b>fiber</b> <b>optics,</b> engineering metrology, optical metrology, oceanography, seismology, spectroscopy (and its applications to chemistry), quantum mechanics, nuclear and particle physics, plasma physics, remote sensing, biomolecular interactions, surface profiling, microfluidics, mechanical stress/strain measurement, velocimetry, and optometry.|$|E
5|$|For {{the scene}} in which Ash is {{revealed}} to be an android, a puppet was created of the character's torso and upper body which was operated from underneath. During a preview screening of the film, this scene caused an usher to faint. In the following scene, Ash's head is placed on a table and re-activated; for portions of this scene, an animatronic head was made using a face cast of the actor, Ian Holm. However, the latex of the head shrank while curing {{and the result was}} not entirely convincing. For the bulk of the scene, Holm knelt under the table with his head coming up through a hole. Milk, caviar, pasta, <b>fiber</b> <b>optics,</b> and glass marbles were combined to form the android's innards.|$|E
40|$|We {{present an}} {{experiment}} {{based on a}} fibered Mach-Zehnder interferometer. The aim is to familiarize students with <b>fibered</b> <b>optics</b> and interferometry, and to improve their understanding of optical amplification. The laboratory project has two parts: in a first part, the students modulate the optical path of the interferometer to study the spectra of light sources via Fourier Transform Spectroscopy. In a second part, an optical amplifier is placed in one or both arms of the interferometer. The set-up uses monomode, polarization-maintaining fibers that propagate light of 1. 5 μm wavelength. In this article, we describe the set-up and {{the analysis of the}} measurements, and we present results from student reports. All components are part of standard optical catalogues. Even though the experiment is based on <b>fibered</b> <b>optics,</b> it is robust to manipulation (it is however relatively expensive ∼ 15 000) : We describe our efforts to protect the components from damage. This experiment is now offered as a 2 -week project for third-year Physics students. The experiment may likewise be of value in early graduate level laboratory courses.

50|$|Before {{doing some}} tests with the telescopes, {{scientists}} {{had to prove}} that the elements used with the <b>optics</b> <b>fiber</b> were reliable (for example, the off-axis parabola, used to inject the beams in the <b>optics</b> <b>fiber).</b> Those tests were partly carried out on the Infrared Optical Telescope Array Observatory.|$|R

5|$|The notable {{properties}} of germania (GeO2) are its high {{index of refraction}} and its low optical dispersion. These make it especially useful for wide-angle camera lenses, microscopy, and the core part of optical fibers. It has replaced titania as the dopant for silica fiber, eliminating the subsequent heat treatment that made the fibers brittle. At the end of 2002, the <b>fiber</b> <b>optics</b> industry consumed 60% of the annual germanium use in the United States, but this is less than 10% of worldwide consumption. GeSbTe is a phase change material used for its optic properties, such as that used in rewritable DVDs.|$|E
25|$|The {{field of}} applied science and {{engineering}} concerned with the design and application of optical fibers is known as <b>fiber</b> <b>optics.</b> The term was coined by Indian physicist Narinder Singh Kapany who is widely acknowledged {{as the father of}} <b>fiber</b> <b>optics.</b>|$|E

25|$|Attenuation in <b>fiber</b> <b>optics,</b> {{also known}} as {{transmission}} loss, is the reduction in intensity of the light beam (or signal) as it travels through the transmission medium. Attenuation coefficients in <b>fiber</b> <b>optics</b> usually use units of dB/km through the medium due to the relatively high quality of transparency of modern optical transmission media. The medium is usually a fiber of silica glass that confines the incident light beam to the inside. Attenuation {{is an important factor}} limiting the transmission of a digital signal across large distances. Thus, much research has gone into both limiting the attenuation and maximizing the amplification of the optical signal.|$|E

40|$|Abstract — We {{investigate}} {{the interaction of}} polarization-dependent loss (PDL) with Kerr nonlinearities by decoupling single- and cross-channel nonlinear distortions in a homogeneous 100 -G polarization division multiplexing {{quadrature phase shift keying}} (PDM-QPSK) and a hybrid 100 -G PDM-QPSK/ 10 -G on/off keying system. Because of the decoupling method, we provide reasons for the interaction, using basic comprehensive examples. Both average Q-factor and its distribution are inves-tigated in both dispersion-managed and dispersion-unmanaged links, showing that realistic PDL values affect outage probabilities notwithstanding a negligible average penalty.
