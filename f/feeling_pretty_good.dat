2500|$|The album Music from Big Pink, in particular, is {{credited}} with contributing to Clapton's decision to leave the supergroup Cream. In his introduction of The Band during the Bob Dylan 30th Anniversary Concert, Clapton announced that in 1968 {{he had heard the}} album, [...] "and it changed my life." [...] Nazareth took their name from [...] "The Weight" [...] - taken from the line [...] "I pulled into Nazareth, feeling half past dead" [...] Guitarist Richard Thompson has acknowledged the album's influence on Fairport Convention's Liege and Lief, and journalist John Harris has suggested that The Band's debut also influenced the spirit of The Beatles' back-to-basics album Let It Be as well as the Rolling Stones' string of roots-infused albums that began with Beggars Banquet. George Harrison said that his song [...] "All Things Must Pass" [...] was heavily influenced by the Band and that, while writing the song, he imagined Levon Helm singing it. Meanwhile, the Big Pink song [...] "The Weight" [...] has been covered numerous times, and in various musical styles. In a 1969 interview, Robbie Robertson remarked on the group's influence, [...] "We certainly didn't want everybody {{to go out and get}} a banjo and a fiddle player. We were trying to calm things down a bit though. What we're going to do now is go to Muscle Shoals, Alabama, and record four sides, four psychedelic songs. Total freak-me songs.

Jerry Muskrat had stopped to eat. Grandfather Frog had stopped for a sun-nap. But Spotty the Turtle had kept right on going, and now here he was, the first one to find the cause of the trouble in the Laughing Brook. Do you wonder that he felt proud and very happy? ...|$|E

40|$|Let G be a graph with {{adjacency}} matrix A. The transition matrix of G relative to A {{is defined by}} H(t) :=(-itA), t∈. The graph G is said to admit <b>pretty</b> <b>good</b> state transfer between a pair of vertices u and v if there exists a sequence of real numbers {t_k} and a complex number γ of unit modulus such that _k→∞ H(t_k) e_u=γ e_v. We find that <b>pretty</b> <b>good</b> state transfer occurs in a cycle on n vertices {{if and only if}} n is a power of two and it occurs between every pair of antipodal vertices. In addition, we look for <b>pretty</b> <b>good</b> state transfer in more general circulant graphs. We prove that union (edge disjoint) of an integral circulant graph with a cycle, each on 2 ^k (k≥ 3) vertices, admits <b>pretty</b> <b>good</b> state transfer. The complement of such union also admits <b>pretty</b> <b>good</b> state transfer. This enables us to find some non-circulant graphs admitting <b>pretty</b> <b>good</b> state transfer. Among the complement of cycles we also find a class of graphs not exhibiting <b>pretty</b> <b>good</b> state transfer...|$|R

In the first five minutes of the session, Kyle Busch's car got loose exiting turn 4, slid down through the grass and destroyed the splitter. This forced the No. 18 team to roll out his backup car.

5000|$|Prior to the game, the Bulldogs (8-4) had not {{scored in}} {{overtime}} in regular-season losses to Louisiana State and Arkansas. And things looked bleak for Mississippi State after Texas A&M's Ja'Mar Toombs rambled 25 {{yards for a}} touchdown on the first play of overtime. But defensive tackle Willie Blade blocked the extra point. Eugene Clinton grabbed the ball and lateraled to Julius Griffith, who went the distance to cut the deficit to 41-37. [...] "They were blocking down on me, but I kept fighting and fighting to get through and finish the play," [...] Blade said. On the Bulldogs' first play from scrimmage, Madkin turned a busted play into a 19-yard gain. After Dontae Walker lost a yard, Madkin went up the middle from the 7-yard line to give Mississippi State its second straight bowl win after four consecutive losses. [...] "All I know is that I broke containment and I was trying to stretch (the ball) out as far as I could," [...] Madkin said. [...] "I knew I had scored when my teammates started to jump on me." [...] Playing in a steady snow that obscured the yard markers and made footing treacherous, Madkin completed 9-of-19 passes for 71 yards and a pair of touchdowns. Walker carried 16 times for 143 yards and three scores. [...] "There might have been a different football game under normal conditions, but our team just never gave up," [...] said Mississippi State coach Jackie Sherrill, who held the same post at Texas A&M from 1982-88. [...] "I was surprised both teams scored as many points as we did in the snow." [...] Toombs set a Texas A&M bowl record with 35 carries for 193 yards and three TDs. The yardage was the second-highest total in Aggies' bowl history, trailing only the 276 Curtis Dickey rolled up in the 1978 Hall of Fame Bowl. [...] "I haven't given the records any thought," [...] Toombs said. [...] "I'm a team guy and my only concern is the team." [...] Trailing 21-20 after three quarters, Texas A&M grabbed the lead on a 35-yard touchdown pass from Mark Farris to Bethel Johnson. Richard Whitaker ran for the two-point conversion and Toombs scored on a 13-yard run to give the Aggies a 35-21 cushion. Just over a minute later, Walker broke off a 32-yard touchdown. With less than three minutes remaining, safety Marco Minor intercepted Farris at the Aggies' 4-yard line. Madkin threw a three-yard TD toss to Donald Lee to tie it with 90 seconds left. [...] "I saw our defensive line going in pretty hard and my guy stopped," [...] Minor said. [...] "So I just stepped in front of him as soon as possible to make a play. That's what I did." [...] Whitaker and Toombs ran for first-quarter touchdowns to stake Texas A&M to a 14-0 lead. The Bulldogs tied it in the second as Walker raced 40 yards for a score (video) and Madkin found Dicenzo Miller for a five-yard TD. The Aggies took a 20-14 lead into the locker room after Farris and Robert Ferguson hooked up for a 42-yard touchdown.Texas A&M has lost four straight and seven of its last eight bowl appearances. [...] "People talked all week about how evenly matched Texas A&M and Mississippi State were. At the end of 60 minutes of play, the score was tied, and when the game was over, only two points separated the teams so they were obviously right," [...] Aggies coach R.C. Slocum said. [...] "It's a bitter feeling for us and I'm sure Mississippi State is <b>feeling</b> <b>pretty</b> <b>good</b> on their side." ...|$|E
