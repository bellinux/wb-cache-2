The number of landings per hour for all four of the helicopters ranged from 1. 6 to 3. 3. The turbine-engine helicopter experienced more frequent normal-acceleration increments above a threshold of +/- 0. 4 g (where g is acceleration due to gravity) than the mountain-based helicopter, but the mountain-based helicopter experienced acceleration increments of greater magnitude.

40|$|The Helios Prototype was {{originally}} {{planned to be}} two separate vehicles, but because of resource limitations only one vehicle was developed to demonstrate two missions. The vehicle consisted of two configurations, one for each mission. One configuration, designated HP 01, was designed to operate at extremely high altitudes using batteries and high-efficiency solar cells spread across the upper surface of its 247 -foot wingspan. On August 13, 2001, the HP 01 configuration reached an altitude of 96, 863 feet, a world record for sustained horizontal flight by a winged aircraft. The other configuration, designated HP 03, was designed for long-duration flight. The plan was to use the solar cells to power the vehicle's electric motors and subsystems {{during the day and}} to use a modified commercial hydrogen-air fuel cell system for use during the night. The aircraft design used wing dihedral, engine power, elevator control surfaces, and a stability augmentation and control system to provide aerodynamic stability and control. At about 30 minutes into the second flight of HP 03, the aircraft encountered a disturbance in the way of turbulence and morphed into an unexpected, persistent, high dihedral configuration. As a result of the persistent high dihedral, the aircraft became unstable in a very divergent pitch mode in which the airspeed excursions from the nominal flight speed about doubled every cycle of the oscillation. The aircraft s <b>design</b> <b>airspeed</b> was subsequently exceeded and the resulting high dynamic pressures caused the wing leading edge secondary structure on the outer wing panels to fail and the solar cells and skin on the upper surface of the wing to rip away.

40|$|Aeroelasticity {{is a broad}} term {{describing}} the often complex interactions between structural mechanics and aerodynamics. Aeroelastic phenomena such as divergence and flutter are potentially destructive, and thus must be avoided. Passive methods to avoid undesirable aeroelastic phenomena often involve the addition of mass and/or limiting the achievable performance of the aircraft. However, active control methods allow both for the suppression of undesirable aeroelastic phenomena, and for utilisation of desirable aeroelastic phenomena using actuators, thus increasing performance without the associated weight penalty of passive systems. The work presented in this thesis involves the design, implementation and experimental validation of novel active controllers to suppress undesirable aeroelastic phenomena over a range of airspeeds. The controllers are constructed using a Linear Parameter Varying (LPV) framework, where the plant and controllers can be represented as linear systems which are functions of a parameter, in this case airspeed. The LPV controllers are constructed using Linear Matrix Inequalities (LMIs), which are convex optimisation problems {{that can be used}} to represent many linear control objectives. Using LMIs, these LPV controllers can be constructed such that they self-schedule with airspeed and provide upper performance bounds during the design process. The aeroelastic phenomena being suppressed by these controllers are Limit-Cycle Oscillations (LCOs), which are a form of flutter with the aeroelastic instability bounded by a structural nonlinearity in the aeroelastic system. In this work, the aeroelastic system used is the Nonlinear Aeroelastic Test Apparatus (NATA), an experimental aeroelastic test platform located at Texas A&M University. Three and four degree-of-freedom dynamic models were derived for the NATA, which include second-order servo motor dynamics. These servo motor dynamics are often neglected in literature but are sufficiently slow that their dynamics are significant to the controlled response of the NATA. The dynamic model also incorporates quasi-steady aerodynamics, which are accurate for low Strouhal numbers calculated from the oscillation frequency of the wing. Is it shown how the dynamics of the NATA can be represented in LPV form, with a quadratic dependence on airspeed and linear dependence on torsional stiffness. Using a variety of techniques the parameters of the NATA are identified, and shown through nonlinear simulation to provide excellent agreement with experimental results. It is also argued that structural nonlinearity, in the way of a nonlinear torsional spring connecting the wing section to the base, generally improves stability due to its largely quadratic stiffness function, and hence in many instances it is safe to linearise this nonlinearity when designing a controller. Using a H₂ generalised control problem representation of a Linear Quadratic Regulator (LQR) state-feedback controller, LPV synthesis LMIs are constructed using a standard transformation which render the LMIs affine in the transformed controller and Lyapunov matrices. These matrices have the same quadratic dependence on airspeed as the NATA model. To reduce conservatism the parameter space of airspeed versus airspeed squared is gridded into triangular convex hulls over the true parameter curve, and the LMIs are numerically optimised to give an upper bound on the H₂ norm across the <b>design</b> <b>airspeed.</b> The resulting state-feedback controller is constructed from the transformed controller and Lyapunov matrices, and can be solved symbolically as a function of airspeed, however it forms a high-order rational function of airspeed, hence it is quicker to solve for the controller gains numerically on-line. The controller is analysed for the classical measures of robustness, namely gain and phase margins, and maximum sensitivity. While not providing the guarantees of these measures that a conventional LQR controller provides, the controller is shown to be sufficiently robust across the airspeed design range. Experimental results for this controller were performed, and the results show excellent LCO suppression and disturbance rejection, the results from which are published in Prime et al. (2010). Following the above work based on a scalar performance index, the upper bound on the H₂ norm is allowed to vary with airspeed using the same quadratic dependence on airspeed as the NATA model, and the transformed controller and Lyapunov matrices. A simple method of solving the LMIs is shown such that the LPV H₂ upper bound is as close to optimal as possible, and using this method a new controller is synthesised. This new controller is compared against the LPV LQR controller with the scalar performance index, and is shown to be closer to optimal across the airspeed design range. Nonlinear simulations of the controlled NATA using this new controller are then presented. Based on Prime et al. (2008), a Linear Fractional Transformation (LFT) is applied to the NATA model to render the dynamics dependent upon the feedback of the linear value of airspeed. This allows the LMIs to be constructed at only two points, the extreme values of the linear <b>design</b> <b>airspeed,</b> rather than gridding over the parameter space as was performed above. An output-feedback controller that itself depends upon the feedback of a function that is linearly dependent upon airspeed is constructed using an induced L₂ loop-shaping framework. The induced L₂ performance objective is based upon a Glover-McFarlane H∞ loop-shaping process where the NATA singular values are shaped using pre- and post-filters, and minimising the induced L₂ norm from both the input and output to both the input and output. An LFT controller is synthesised, and simulations are performed showing the suppression of LCOs. Thesis (Ph. D.) [...] University of Adelaide, School of Mechanical Engineering, 201...|$|E

Combinations of engine RPM reduction and 2 -speed drive systems were evaluated. Three levels of engine and the drive system advanced technology were assessed; 2015, 2025 and 2035. Propulsion and drive system configurations that resulted in minimum vehicle gross weight were identified. Design variables included engine speed reduction, drive system speed reduction, technology, and rotor cruise propulsion efficiency. The NASA Large Civil Tiltrotor, LCTR, aircraft served as the base vehicle concept for this study and was resized for over thirty combinations of operating cruise RPM and technology level, quantifying LCTR 2 Gross Weight, size, and mission fuel. Additional studies show design sensitivity to other mission ranges and <b>design</b> <b>airspeeds,</b> with corresponding relative estimated operational cost. The lightest vehicle gross weight solution consistently came from rotor cruise tip speeds between 422 fps and 500 fps.

40|$|During {{the highly}} maneuverable {{aircraft}} technology (HiMAT) flight test program recently completed at NASA Ames Research Center's Dryden Flight Research Facility, numerous problems were experienced in airspeed calibration. This necessitated {{the use of}} state reconstruction techniques {{to arrive at a}} position-error calibration. For the HiMAT aircraft, most of the calibration effort was expended on flights in which the air data pressure transducers were not performing accurately. Following discovery of this problem, the air data transducers of both aircraft were wrapped in heater blankets to correct the problem. Additional calibration flights were performed, and from the resulting data a satisfactory position-error calibration was obtained. This calibration and data obtained before installation of the heater blankets were used to develop an alternate calibration method. The alternate approach took advantage of high-quality inertial data that was readily available. A linearized Kalman filter (LKF) was used to reconstruct the aircraft's wind-relative trajectory; the trajectory was then used to separate transducer measurement errors from the aircraft position error. This calibration method is accurate and inexpensive. The LKF technique has an inherent advantage of requiring that no flight maneuvers be specially <b>designed</b> for <b>airspeed</b> calibrations.

40|$|In this paper, we {{show that}} in mixed phase clouds FSSP- 100 {{measurements}} may be contaminated by ice crystals, inducing wrong interpretation of particle size and subsequent bulk parameters. This contamination is generally revealed by a bimodal feature of the particle size distribution; in other words, in mixed phase clouds bimodal features could be {{an indication of the}} presence of ice particles. The combined measurements of the FSSP- 100 and the Polar Nephelometer give a coherent description of the effect of the ice crystals on the FSSP- 100 response. The FSSP- 100 particle size distributions are characterized by a bimodal shape with a second mode peaked between 25 and 35 μm related to ice crystals. This feature is observed with the FSSP- 100 at airspeed up to 200 m s− 1 and with the FSSP- 300 series. In order to assess the size calibration for clouds of ice crystals the response of the FSSP- 100 probe has been numerically simulated using a light scattering model of randomly oriented hexagonal ice particles and assuming both smooth and rough crystal surfaces. The results suggest that the second mode measured between 25 μm and 35 μm, does not necessarily represent true size responses but likely corresponds to bigger aspherical ice particles. According to simulation results, the sizing understatement would be neglected in the rough case but would be major with the smooth case. Qualitatively, the Polar Nephelometer phase function suggests that the rough case is the more suitable to describe real crystals. Quantitatively, however, it is difficult to conclude. Previous cloud in situ measurements suggest that the FSSP- 100 secondary mode, peaked in the range 25 – 35 μm, is likely to be due to the shattering of large ice crystals on the probe tips. This finding is supported by the rather good relationship between the concentration of particles larger than 20 μm (hypothesized to be ice shattered-fragments measured by the FSSP) and the concentration of (natural) ice particles larger than 100 μm (CPI data). The shattering efficiency is defined as the ratio of the measured ice shattered-fragments to the number of natural ice particles (with d> 100 μm) impacting the probe leading edge. In the present study the shattering efficiency is evaluated to ~ 7 %. It is found that about 400 ice fragments may result from the shattering of one equivalent irregular shaped ice crystal with a mean volume diameter of 310 μm. Obviously, these values could be strongly dependent on the inlet <b>design,</b> the <b>airspeed</b> and the robustness of ice crystals via the impact kinetic energy to surface energy ratio providing the particle breakup...|$|R
