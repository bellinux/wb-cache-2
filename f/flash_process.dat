The Fe/SiO 2 {{ratio in}} slag {{is one of}} the {{important}} control parameters for copper <b>flash</b> smelting <b>process,</b> {{but it is difficult to}} describe the complex relationship between the technological parameters and the Fe/SiO 2 ratio in slag using accurate mathematic formulae, because the copper <b>flash</b> smelting <b>process</b> is a complicated nonlinear system. An neural network model for the Fe/SiO 2 ratio in copper flash smelting slag was developed, whose net structure is 8 - 15 - 12 - 1, and input nodes include the oxygen volume per ton concentrate, the oxygen grade, the flux rate, the quantity of Cu, S, Fe, SiO 2 and MgO in concentrate. In order to avoid local minimum terminations when the model is trained by back propagation (BP) algorithm, a new algorithm called GA-BP is presented by using genetic algorithm (GA) to determine the initial weights and threshold values. The results show that the model can avoid local minimum terminations and accelerate convergence, and has high prediction precision and good generalization performance.

The simulated {{results show}} that: methanol recovery and methanol purity in gas phase for one-stage <b>flash</b> <b>process</b> are almost same with two-stage <b>flash</b> <b>process</b> and one-stage <b>flash</b> <b>process</b> is more beneficial by thinking {{of equipment and}} operation cost. The experimental results show that flash pressure has a significant influence on methanol recovery and methanol purity in gas phase which can be effectively improved when flashing pressure is reduced. Meanwhile, reaction temperature and reaction pressure also have important effects on methanol recovery and methanol purity in gas phase. For continuous producing biodiesel in supercritical methanol, when the reaction temperature, the reaction pressure and the molar ratio of methanol/oil are kept at 300 ℃, 15 MPa and 25 : 1, respectively, methanol recovery and methanol purity in gas phase can reach 90 % and 98. 8 % respectively if the flashing pressure is kept at 0. 2 MPa. Therefore, the flash evaporation device coupled with tubular reactor for high purity separation of methanol is very effective which can realize comprehensive utilization of heat energy and separation and recycle of methanol...|$|E
40|$|San Diego Gas and Electric (SDG and E) {{believes}} that the binary-cycle offers an improved method of converting moderate temperature geothermal resources into electric power. The process, shown schematically in figure 1 - 1, has significant advantages over existing methods of geothermal power generation. The advantages of the binary process are that greater amounts of power can be generated from a given resource, fewer wells are needed to support a given power output, and the binary-cycle {{is expected to be}} more economical than the <b>flash</b> <b>process</b> for this type of resource. Another advantage is that the binary-cycle is a closed process and thus enhances environmental acceptability. In addition, this process is applicable to a larger range of the nations geothermal reservoirs. It is estimated that 80 % of the nation's hydrothermal resources can be classified as moderate temperature (300 to 410 F) resources. The <b>flash</b> <b>process,</b> commonly used to convert high temperature geothermal resources to electric power, is technically feasible for moderate temperature resources.

40|$|BLEVE {{is a type}} of {{explosion}} that constitutes a major hazard in (but not limited to) the process industries, and which may lead to catastrophic effects. It can happen in storage facility or in transport system (road and train tankers). The subsequent effects of BLEVEs such as blast overpressure, fireball, and so on are the main considerations for safety engineers to achieve an acceptable and required level of safety during operations. To {{have a better understanding of}} the consequences of a possible BLEVE accident, computer simulations may be required because of their ability to perform many calculations in a relatively short time. But, unlike the well-known expanding gas <b>process,</b> the <b>flashing</b> liquid <b>process</b> that occurs in a BLEVE accident involves more complex physics. The complexity necessitates simplification to be able to describe the <b>flashing</b> <b>process.</b> Interactions between the BLEVE itself and confinement and congestion have to be analysed when discussing possible BLEVEs inside a tunnel, such as may be possible during transport by train or truck. To establish a proper method to simulate a BLEVE, the simulation approach by Hansen and Kjellander (2016) is used as a starting point. To simplify the description of the <b>flashing</b> <b>process</b> Hansen and Kjellander (2016) used a pseudo-source. Several adaptations have been made regarding the pseudo-source region. In addition, some simulations required several trials to achieve a more consistent method. Regarding the blast overpressures and impulses, the simulation results are mostly above the actual experiment results. These may represent a more conservative value which is good from a safety point of view. This satisfactory level of results does not happen for fireball simulations. Fireball characteristics are below the values of actual experiments. Several changes on the simulation setups are necessary to reproduce fireball properties seen in actual experiments. A BLEVE inside a semiconfined area will have a lower decay rate of blast overpressure due to the confinement. Relatively high overpressures are observed at far distances from the centre of the explosion. Congestion will introduce turbulences and will disturb the blast wave, thus reducing the overpressures...|$|R

40|$|In {{the context}} of nuclear reactor safety, a pipe breach in the primary circuit is the {{initiator}} of a {{loss of coolant accident}} (LOCA). The calculation of leak rates involving the discharge of water and steam mixtures {{plays an important role in}} the modeling of LOCAs for both generation (GEN) II and GEN III reactors, and also for the supercritical water reactor of GEN IV.

CO 2 desorption experiments were performed using the three purchased microfiltration (MF) membranes with different pore sizes, 0. 2, 0. 5 and 1. 0 μm, and the two microporous hollow fiber membranes made from alumina particles with different thicknesses.

The MEA solution which absorbed CO 2 in advance was fed into the tube side of the hollow fiber and was forced to permeate through the membrane by reducing the pressure on the shell side to 40 – 1 kPa. The results indicated the CO 2 desorption rate increased with decreasing pore size. Also, the thicker membrane showed the greater CO 2 desorption rate. The results and observation implied that CO 2 desorption occurred not only {{on the surface of the}} rich solution falling down along the outer surface of the hollow fiber after permeating through the membrane but inside the pores of the membrane wall. Also, the experimental results supported that the contact of the rich solution with the membrane played an important role in CO 2 desorption...|$|E
40|$|The {{control of}} arsenic, a toxic and {{carcinogenic}} element, {{is an important}} issue for all copper smelters. In this work, the reaction mechanism and distribution behavior of arsenic in the bottom blown copper smelting process (SKS process) were investigated and compared to the flash smelting process. There are obvious differences of arsenic distribution in the SKS process and <b>flash</b> <b>process,</b> resulting from the differences of oxygen potentials, volatilizations, smelting temperatures, reaction intensities, and mass transfer processes. Under stable production conditions, the distributions of arsenic among matte, slag, and gas phases are 6 %, 12 %, and 82 %, respectively. Less arsenic is reported in the gas phase with the <b>flash</b> <b>process</b> than with the SKS process. The main arsenic species in gas phase are AsS (g), AsO (g), and As 2 (g). Arsenic exists in the slag predominantly as As 2 O 3 (l), and in matte as As (l). High matte grade is harmful to the elimination of arsenic to gas. The changing of Fe/SiO 2 has slight effects on the distributions of arsenic. In order to enhance the removal of arsenic from the SKS smelting system to the gas phase, low oxygen concentration, low ratios of oxygen/ore, and low matte grade should be chosen. In the SKS smelting process, no dust is recycled, and almost all dust is collected and further treated to eliminate arsenic and recover valuable metals by other process streams...|$|E

It was modeled after the <b>flashing</b> <b>process</b> encountered by the accumulator of air-source heat pump systems. Three small pyrex glass vessels were used to hold the refrigerant and allow for visualization studies of the <b>flashing</b> <b>process.</b> Baseline experiments were run varying initial pressure, initial refrigerant amount, orifice diameter, and vessel geometry. Three sets of experiments were run using two passive enhancement methods (the addition of steel balls {{and the addition of}} small amounts of oil) and one active enhancement method (the addition of an immersion heater). Furthermore, a lumped-parameter analytical model was developed from basic thermodynamic principles that predicted the rate of depressurization for the flashing refrigerant. The study showed that the initial refrigerant amount and the orifice size had the greatest influence on the mass flow and pressure characteristics during each sixty second test. The initial pressure and vessel volume had less of an impact under the conditions tested. Two of the enhancement methods consistently increased the amount of refrigerant flashed during the tests as compared to the baseline data for the same initial conditions.

The reactant rich stream (assumed to be the bottoms) from the separator isrecycled back to the reactor. Focus is on pure mass recycle, as the two units are decoupled energetically via heat exchangers. Two different modes of operation are considered. These are compared {{with each other and}} with the well known stand alone reactor with a first order exothermic reaction. For the first mode of operation, the feed rate is fixed and for the second the recycle rate is fixed. In practice, these different modes of operation can be achieved by a suitable control strategy. It is shown that the behavior crucially depends on the mode of operation. Fixing the feed rate can lead to severe operational problems including monotonic and oscillatory unstable steady statesover a wide range of operating conditions. Further, parameterregions are identified, where no steady state exists at all. On the other hand when the recycle rate is fixed the coupled system admits at least one stable steady state solution for a fixed set of operating conditions. © 2001 Elsevier Science Ltd.
