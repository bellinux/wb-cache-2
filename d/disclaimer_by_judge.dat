40|$|Do {{innocuous}} {{social environments}} influence the self? A hypothetical person (claimant) made an incidental claim about her/him {{that had no}} bearing on the participant (observer). This constituted the innocuous social environment. We asked whether such a claim influenced the observer’s self, eliciting corresponding reactions to the claim (hubris hypothesis). Specifically, observers read the following claims: self-superiority (“I’m better than others”), noncomparative positive (“I’m good”), self-equality (“I’m as good as others”), temporally comparative self-superiority (“I’m better than I used to be”), other-superiority (“S/he is better than others”), or self-superiority accompanied <b>by</b> <b>disclaimers.</b> Observers <b>judged</b> the claim/claimant and inferred the claimant’s self-view and view of others along with the claimant’s view of them. Self-superiority claims elicited the most unfavorable evaluations, which were {{accounted for by the}} perception that the claimant implied a negative view of others and particularly of the observer. Observers disliked self-superiority claims, because they were personally offended. status: publishe...|$|R
