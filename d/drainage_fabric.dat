40|$|Direct push {{groundwater}} circulation wells (DP-GCW) are {{a promising}} technology for remediation of groundwater contaminated with dissolved hydrocarbons and chlorinated solvents. In these wells, groundwater is {{withdrawn from the}} formation {{at the bottom of}} the well, aerated and vapor stripped and injected back into the formation at or above the water table. Previous field studies have shown that: (a) GCWs can circulate significant volumes of groundwater; and (b) GCWs can effectively remove volatile compounds and add oxygen. In this work, we describe the development and field-testing of a system of DP-GCWs for remediation of volatile organics such as benzene, toluene, ethylbenzene, and toluene (BTEX). The GCWs were constructed with No. 20 slotted well screen (2. 4 cm ID) and natural sand pack extending from 1. 5 to 8. 2 m below grade. Air is introduced {approximately} 7. 5 m below grade via 0. 6 cm tubing. Approximately 15 % of the vertical length of the air supply tubing is wrapped in tangled mesh polypropylene geonet <b>drainage</b> <b>fabric</b> to provide surface area for biological growth and precipitation of oxidized iron. These materials were selected to allow rapid installation of the GCWs using 3. 8 cm direct push Geoprobe{reg_sign} rods, greatly reducing well installation costs. Laboratory testing of these sparged wells and computational fluid dynamics (CFD) modeling showed that these wells, although they used only about 1 L/min of air, could circulate about 1 L/min of water through the surrounding aquifer. This flow was sufficient to capture all of a flowing contaminant if the wells are sufficiently closely together, about 1 meter on center depending on the air flow rate supplied, in a line across the plume. The CFD work showed the details of this ability to capture, and also showed that unforeseen heterogeneities in the aquifer such as a gradient of permeability or a thin impermeable layer (such as a clay layer) did not prevent the system from working largely as intended. The system was tested in a petroleum contaminated aquifer near Rocky Point, NC. The contaminant plume there is approximately 10 m deep, 50 m wide and contains up to 4 {micro}g/L total BTEX and 75 {micro}g/L dissolved iron. An extensive pilot test was first performed to estimate the zone of influence for a single well. At this site an air injection rate of 1. 2 L/min resulted in a water flow rate of 1 to 2 L/min based on bromide dilution tests in the GCW. The GCW increased the dissolved oxygen concentration in the discharge water to between 6 and 8 {micro}g/L and reduced contaminant concentrations to less than 20 {micro}g/L total BTEX. Monitoring results from a 73 day pilot test were then used to define the zone of influence for a single DP-GCW and to design a full scale barrier system...|$|E

Vegetated roofs in humid subtropical regions rely on the same core green roof terminologies that are used throughout the world and {{other parts of}} the United States. Extensive, intensive, soil media, ballast, filter <b>fabric,</b> <b>drainage</b> layer, waterproof membrane are some of the core green roof component terms associated with SCV roofs.|$|R

The fabrics in geo textiles are permeable fabrics and are used with soils having ability to separate, filter, protect or drain. The application areas include civil engineering, earth and road construction, dam engineering, soil sealing and in <b>drainage</b> systems. The <b>fabric</b> used in it must have good strength, durability, low moisture absorption and thickness. Mostly nonwoven and woven fabrics {{are used in}} it. Synthetic fibers like glass, polypropylene and acrylic fibers are used to prevent cracking of the concrete, plastic and other building materials. Polypropylene and polyester are used in geo textiles and dry/liquid filtration due to their compatibility.|$|R
40|$|Abstract. Hazardous {{landslides}} are ordinary {{phenomena in}} north of Iran. In this paper, mitigation of Flourd landslide in Savadkouh by using non-woven geosynthetic was investigated. Reinforced slope was designed using limit equilibrium analysis and numerical method {{such as those}} based on the Fed-eral Highway Administration of the USÃ€ (FHWA) guidelines and finite element method and with in-situ residual soil pa-rameters. The main goal of this paper in designing a reinforced slope instead of failed slope is finding number of reinforce-ment layers and vertical distance of reinforcement layers. Using the non-woven fabric to repair failed slope is a good option to prevent respective failures. When the non-woven fabric is used, it not only generates the tension forces to enhance the overall stability of slopes, but also prevents the devel-opment of pore water trapped in clayey soils by providing horizontal <b>drainage</b> through the <b>fabric.</b> Results of analysis showe...|$|R
