25|$|A fire {{occurred}} in a Tesla Model S charging at a Tesla Supercharger in Norway on January 1, 2016. The fire was slow, and the owner had time to unplug the car and retrieve possessions. An investigation by the Norwegian Accident Investigation Board (AIBN) indicated that the fire originated in the car, but was otherwise inconclusive. In March 2016, Tesla stated that their own investigation into the incident concluded that the fire {{was caused by a}} short circuit in the vehicle's <b>distribution</b> <b>box,</b> but that the amount of damage prevented them from determining the exact cause. Tesla stated that the Supercharger detected the short circuit and deactivated, and a future Model S software update would stop the vehicle from charging if a short circuit is detected.|$|E

500|$|The box set's {{release was}} {{confirmed}} on Wainwright's official site on March 21, 2011. Only 3,000 copies were produced for worldwide <b>distribution.</b> <b>Box</b> sets were sold for £150 in the United Kingdom, €170 throughout Europe, and were available as imports in the United States for $350. As {{part of the}} marketing strategy to promote the collection and concert series, Universal Music Catalogue developed a [...] "treasure hunt" [...] video for YouTube where visitors identified clues, and navigated links within a collage of Wainwright's music videos. According to Wainwright, the rarities box set was a [...] "little Rufus blast" [...] before he began work on his next pop album. Wainwright also said the following of the collection: [...] "There's my old demos, {{a lot of them}} were recorded in Montreal... when I had a very, very different voice, I kind of sounded like a little old man. There's that and there's a lot of fabulous collaborations with my mother, my father and some other great artists." [...] Wainwright had originally intended to call the box set The Rufus Cycle. After being told the title was [...] "too sophisticated", he went with House of Rufus, partly inspired by Lady Gaga's Haus of Gaga. Wainwright claimed the box set's release shortly after his father's (Loudon Wainwright III) box set 40 Odd Years was [...] "totally serendipitous".|$|E

50|$|The larger vessels, {{designated}} U.S. Army Mine Planter (USAMP), {{were supported}} {{by a variety of}} smaller craft comprising a submarine mine flotilla to plant and maintain the mine fields associated with harbor approaches and coastal fortifications of the United States.

5000|$|The mine {{planting}} process required assistance by other, smaller vessels. Some, {{almost as}} capable as the planters were termed Junior Mine Planter. The Junior Mine Planters were often commercial designs {{with a number}} being conversions or special built during the war. They occasionally show up as [...] "Mine Planter" [...] with the [...] "Junior" [...] dropped. One, the General Richard Arnold, a 1909 tug, sank {{in the process of}} rescuing another mine vessel. A specialized vessel, the <b>Distribution</b> <b>Box</b> Boat (DB Boat), was designed to install and maintain the distribution boxes from which individual cables branched to each mine in a mine group. A number of the later <b>Distribution</b> <b>Box</b> Boats ended up in the Navy, often becoming known simply as [...] "Box Boats" [...] or [...] "Box L" [...] boats working as small service vessels or still working in harbor defense. Mine Yawls and other small craft assisted in both mine work and all the other duties fitting small vessels within the fortifications in which individual forts or batteries were often separated by large bodies of water.|$|E

50|$|In the United States {{a type of}} vessel termed mine planter was developed, {{built and}} {{deployed}} in 1904. By 1909 more mine planters were under construction and deployment had reached the San Francisco fortifications. These were assisted by smaller vessels.

5000|$|Each mine casemate {{controlled}} about 150 to 300 mines (depending on {{the harbor}} defended), arranged {{in groups of}} 19. The mines in a group were generally laid about 100 ft apart, in lines running across the channel being protected, with 50 ft or less on {{either end of the}} line. This meant that one group of mines could protect a total distance of about 1900 ft. About [...] of cable were required to connect one group of 19 mines to its <b>distribution</b> <b>box,</b> with the connecting cables radiating out from the box in a hub-and-spoke fashion. Actually, the <b>distribution</b> <b>box</b> was usually located well behind the line of mines, so the pattern looked more like a 19-armed candelabrum with the box at its base. If more groups of mines were needed, multiple mine casemates were generally built and equipped. For example, Boston had three mine casemates, with two originally at Fort Dawes on Deer Island (northern channels) and Fort Strong on Long Island (southern channels). Later in World War II, Fort Strong's mine casemate was deactivated and control of the southern mines passed to Fort Warren on Georges Island.|$|E
