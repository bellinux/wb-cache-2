25|$|Bonin {{flying foxes}} are an animal species known to display {{homosexual}} behavior, with males observed performing fellatio on other males.

25|$|From the 52 deg. S. lat. up to Strait of Magellan, {{the western}} {{slope of the}} Cordillera does not, {{properly}} speaking, exist. Abrupt walls overlook the Pacific, and great longitudinal and transversal channels and fjords run right {{through the heart of}} the range, cutting it generally in a direction more or less oblique to its axis, the result of movements of the Earth's crust. This region is not fully explored, and all that is known of <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> is principally composed of the same rocks as the Fuegian Andes, and that the greater part of its upper valleys is occupied by glaciers that reach down to the sea amid dense forest.|$|E

25|$|Because the {{necropolis}} of Sekhemkhet {{was never}} finished, {{it is hard}} to say which planned cultic building had already existed. The pyramid courtyard was surrounded by a niched enclosure wall facing north-west. It was 1.850ft long, 607ft wide and 33ft high. The only archaeologically preserved cultic building is the Southern Tomb, its base measurement is estimated to be 105ft x 52ft. The subterranean structure included a tight corridor, beginning at the western site of the tomb and ending in a double chamber. In this chamber in 1963 Jean-Philippe Lauer excavated the burial of a 2-years-old toddler. The identity of this child remains a mystery, the only for sure known fact about <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> cannot be king Sekhemkhet himself, since the king was always depicted as a young man.|$|E
25|$|Jane was {{appointed}} as a {{lady of the}} Queen's bedchamber on 15 July 1851. Although hard-working, loyal and devoted, she lacked the knowledge and discretion required for the role. In 1855, Mary Bulteel, later {{the wife of the}} Queen's private secretary Sir Henry Ponsonby, disapproved of Jane's conduct, and commented that “Lady E. is more utterly the reverse from what she ought to be on this occasion than anybody can possibly conceive. I mean, I see she is preparing to be foolishly cringing to all the little miseries of etiquette...I quite long for somebody as the Queen's first lady with more natural dignity”. Despite her shortcomings, the Queen came to rely heavily on “Dearest Jane”, as she was referred to. The Queen required the utmost effort and devotion from her servants, and Jane followed this code of conduct with total deference to her royal mistress. However, her health suffered as a result, and it remained a constant burden throughout her waiting. In a letter from Henry Ponsonby to Sir Thomas Biddulph, another courtier, he reported that Jane “was principally taken up with her own health”. Jane was also concerned about her own health, and in 1876, she confided to Ponsonby that “she cannot go on as <b>it</b> <b>is,</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> is killing her”, and he advised her to write to the Queen threatening to resign if her position was not made easier. The Queen relented, but continued to impose restrictions on Jane's contact with the outside world. Jane's son, who became the 4th Marquess on {{the death of his father}} in 1857, was anxious to visit, but the Queen would not allow him to. Instead, he requested an interview with Ponsonby about his mother's arduous duties; Ponsonby accepted, but Jane said “oh no, perhaps the Queen would not like it”. Ponsonby referred to this fear of the Queen as absurd, knowing that the Queen would not be angry with him for paying a visit to Jane's son.|$|E

500|$|Philip Stead, {{writing in}} The Times Literary Supplement {{considered}} the novel to be [...] "a morbid {{version of that}} of Beauty and the Beast".

500|$|The {{case was}} {{appealed to the}} Court of Appeal, where it was heard by the Lord Chief Justice, Lord Woolf; the Master of the Rolls, Lord Phillips; and Lord Justice May in February 2005. In {{addition}} to acknowledging the limitations stated in the Parliament Act 1911, {{the court found that}} [...] "the greater the scale of the constitutional change proposed by any amendment, the more likely <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> will fall outside the powers contained in the 1911 Act." [...] Fundamental constitutional changes could therefore not be passed using the Parliament Acts, including extending the duration of Parliament and abolishing the House of Lords. However, the Parliament Act 1949, as a [...] "relatively modest and straightforward amendment" [...] to the 1911 Act that did not [...] "extend to making changes of a fundamentally different nature to the relationship between the House of Lords and the Commons", was found to be within the scope of the Parliament Act 1911. The 1949 Act and, consequently, the Hunting Act were therefore held to be valid legislation and the appeal was dismissed.|$|E

500|$|Under Section 30(2), {{fair dealing}} using any {{work for the}} purpose of {{reporting}} current events, with sufficient acknowledgement, is a valid exception to copyright. Photographs are excluded, however; Cornish, Llewelyn and Aplin write that this is [...] "in order to preserve the full value of holding a unique visual record of some person or event". A crucial element of the [...] "current events" [...] exception {{is whether or not the}} reporting covers [...] "current" [...] events. [...] "The older the issue, the less likely <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> will be treated as having any currency". Hyde Park confirmed that, where an event that took place some time ago is still being discussed, that can be treated as [...] "current". The nature of [...] "events" [...] must also be confirmed; while some things will be inherently considered events, such as matters of national importance, major sporting contests or important political occasions, others may not be. Matters that are [...] "trivial, ephemeral or immaterial" [...] may not be treated as events, although it has been confirmed that media attention can transform a trivial matter into an [...] "event", as in Pro Sieben. The copyrighted works must also directly deal with the current events; Associated Newspapers v News Group Newspapers, for example, concerned the republication of correspondence between Wallis Simpson and her husband on the occasion of Simpson's death. It was held that the correspondence did not relate closely enough to the death for the fair dealing exception to apply.|$|E

2500|$|Andersen devotes {{a chapter}} to this theory, {{entitled}} [...] "Pagan or Medieval."

The cocking handle can be switched from either end, folds in, and unfolds from a spring so the shooter need not unfold it by hand [...] before firing. Another feature of <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> doubles as the forward assist, which is used in the instance that the spent cartridge ejected but the next one did not properly extract and go into battery. In addition, the ejection port has a brass deflector to mitigate the amount of casings that may strike the face of left-handed operators. Instead of a dust cover which has the need to be flipped back up when the gun isn't in use, the bolt acts as the seal from dirt.|$|E
2500|$|Preliminary and Supplementary Sketches (Einzelskizzen) – before {{beginning}} the composition proper, Wagner usually made some preliminary sketches to work on. Needless to say, he added supplementary sketches to these throughout the compositional process. These sketches are sometimes {{little more than}} fragmentary phrases jotted down on scraps of paper; {{but they can also}} be quite lengthy and elaborate sections of music written on several staves. Sometimes they are labelled (e.g. [...] "Fafner", [...] "Waldvogel"). Unlike the preliminary sketches for his earlier operas, however, which were usually settings of lines of text, the sketches for the Ring operas were generally worked out independently of the text; vocal sketches do survive, {{but more often than not}} even these are without text. It is highly unlikely that all Wagner's sketches have come down to us, and of course not everything need have been sketched - some of the music for the preliminary drafts may have been composed from scratch as it was required - but the [...] "cleaner" [...] a passage in a draft is, the more likely <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> was preceded by a sketch.|$|E

Apart from that, everything he says is true."
