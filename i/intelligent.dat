5|$|Molecular {{biologist}} Robin Holliday {{has written}} {{that the absence of}} biological wheels argues against creationist or <b>intelligent</b> design accounts of the diversity of life, because an <b>intelligent</b> creator—free of the limitations imposed by evolution—would be expected to deploy wheels wherever they would be of use.|$|E
5|$|No argument, writes Paley, {{other than}} 'the {{necessity}} of an <b>intelligent</b> Creator', {{can explain the}} eye (or any other elaborate living structure).|$|E

5|$|The {{paradigm}} gave researchers {{license to}} study isolated problems and find solutions that were both verifiable and useful. It provided {{a common language}} to describe problems and share their solutions with each other, and with other fields that also used concepts of abstract agents, like economics and control theory. It was hoped that a complete agent architecture (like Newell's SOAR) would one day allow researchers to build more versatile and <b>intelligent</b> systems out of interacting <b>intelligent</b> agents.|$|E

5|$|During the 2004 trial {{regarding}} {{allegations of}} Rush Limbaugh's drug abuse, the ACLU argued that his privacy {{should not have}} been compromised by allowing law enforcement examination of his medical records. In June 2004, the school district in Dover, Pennsylvania, required that its high school biology students listen to a statement which asserted that the theory of evolution is not fact and mentioning <b>intelligent</b> design as an alternative theory. Several parents called the ACLU to complain, because they believed that the school was promoting a religious idea in the classroom and violating the Establishment Clause of the First Amendment. The ACLU, joined by Americans United for Separation of Church and State, represented the parents in a lawsuit against the school district. After a lengthy trial, Judge John E. Jones III ruled in favor of the parents in the Kitzmiller v. Dover Area School District decision, finding that <b>intelligent</b> design is not science and permanently forbidding the Dover school system from teaching <b>intelligent</b> design in science classes.|$|E

5|$|In <b>intelligent</b> mammals, such as primates, the {{cerebrum}} {{is larger}} {{relative to the}} rest of the brain. Intelligence itself is not easy to define, but indications of intelligence include the ability to learn, matched with behavioral flexibility. Rats, for example, are considered to be highly <b>intelligent,</b> as they can learn and perform new tasks, an ability that may be important when they first colonize a fresh habitat. In some mammals, food gathering appears to be related to intelligence: a deer feeding on plants has a brain smaller than a cat, which must think to outwit its prey.|$|E

Arrangements were handled by Morishita, Kanazaki, Kondoh and Kouda. Many of Tsujiyoko's tracks for earlier Fire Emblem titles were remixed for use in Fates.|$|E
5|$|The populations seen in Final Fantasy Tactics and Vagrant Story are {{essentially}} human. The other <b>intelligent</b> races who appear are hostile or monster-like, such as Goblins or Ogres. Friendly <b>intelligent</b> races appear in later games set in Ivalice, where {{the human race}} is called Humes. Monsters and the like are thought not to exist by the general populace in Vagrant Story, with the monsters in the isolated Leá Monde all stemming from the Dark.

25|$|The modern form of {{a design}} {{argument}} is put forth by <b>intelligent</b> design. Proponents of <b>intelligent</b> design often cite the fine-tuning observations that (in part) preceded the formulation of the anthropic principle by Carter as a proof of an <b>intelligent</b> designer. Opponents of <b>intelligent</b> design {{are not limited to}} those who hypothesize that other universes exist; they may also argue, anti-anthropically, that the universe is less fine-tuned than often claimed, or that accepting fine tuning as a brute fact is less astonishing than the idea of an <b>intelligent</b> creator. Furthermore, even accepting fine tuning, Sober (2005) and Ikeda and Jefferys, argue that the Anthropic Principle as conventionally stated actually undermines <b>intelligent</b> design; see fine-tuned universe.|$|E
25|$|A guide {{narrative}} intervenes, {{explaining that}} whilst humanity had always assumed {{that it was}} the most <b>intelligent</b> species on Earth, in fact the dolphins were more <b>intelligent,</b> and had left the planet some time before.
