500|$|The exact {{relationship}} between Fielding's The History of Tom Jones, a Foundling and Richardson's The History of Sir Charles Grandison cannot be known, but the character Charles Grandison {{was designed as}} a morally [...] "better" [...] hero than the character Tom Jones. In 1749, a friend asked Richardson [...] "to give the world his <b>idea</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>good</b> man and fine gentleman combined". Richardson hesitated to begin such a project, and he did not work on it until he was prompted the next year (June 1750) by Mrs. Donnelland and Miss Sutton, who were [...] "both very intimate with one Clarissa Harlowe: and both extremely earnest with him to give them a good man". [...] Near the end of 1751, Richardson sent a draft of the novel to Mrs. Donnellan, and the novel was being finalised in the middle of 1752.|$|E
500|$|The double album Sheik Yerbouti was {{the first}} release on Zappa Records, and {{contained}} the Grammy-nominated single [...] "Dancin' Fool", which reached No.45 on the Billboard charts, and [...] "Jewish Princess", which received attention when a Jewish group, the Anti-Defamation League (ADL), attempted to prevent the song from receiving radio airplay due to its alleged anti-Semitic lyrics. Zappa vehemently denied any anti-Semitic sentiments, and dismissed the ADL as a [...] "noisemaking organization that tries to apply pressure on people in order to manufacture a stereotype image of Jews that suits their <b>idea</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>good</b> time." [...] The album's commercial success was attributable in part to [...] "Bobby Brown". Due to its explicit lyrics about a young man's encounter with a [...] "dyke {{by the name of}} Freddie", the song did not get airplay in the U.S., but it topped the charts in several European countries where English is not the primary language. The triple LP Joe's Garage featured lead singer Ike Willis as the voice of the character [...] "Joe" [...] in a rock opera about the danger of political systems, the suppression of freedom of speech and music—inspired in part by the Islamic revolution that had made music illegal within its jurisdiction at the time—and about the [...] "strange relationship Americans have with sex and sexual frankness". The album contains rock songs like [...] "Catholic Girls" [...] (a riposte to the controversies of [...] "Jewish Princess"), [...] "Lucille Has Messed My Mind Up", and the title track, as well as extended live-recorded guitar improvisations combined with a studio backup band dominated by drummer Vinnie Colaiuta (with whom Zappa had a particularly good musical rapport) adopting the xenochrony process. The album contains one of Zappa's most famous guitar [...] "signature pieces", [...] "Watermelon in Easter Hay".|$|E

[...] "Neither did Duke [...] I didn't think a good town marshal was going to run around town like a chicken with his head cut off asking everyone to help. And who saves him? His Quaker wife.

These rituals and services had intermediaries for rites such as Nsengha or Kitobo (priests). In addition, for anxiety and ailments, a Nganga or Mfwintshi (healer) were in service who would perform Lubuko (divination). The religious thought did not limit itself to rituals, but included <b>ideas</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>good</b> personhood, good heart, dignity for others and self-respect. The religious code of civil life and goodness affected the Luba social life.|$|R

2500|$|In 1749, Richardson's female friends {{started asking}} him to create a male figure as virtuous as his heroines [...] "Pamela" [...] and [...] "Clarissa" [...] in order to [...] "give the world his <b>idea</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>good</b> man and fine gentleman combined". Although he did not at first agree, he {{eventually}} complied, starting work on a book in this vein in June 1750. Near the end of 1751, Richardson sent {{a draft of the}} novel The History of Sir Charles Grandison to Mrs. Donnellan, and the novel was being finalized in the middle of 1752. When the novel was being printed in 1753, Richardson discovered that Irish printers were trying to pirate the work. He immediately fired those he suspected of giving the printers advanced copies of Grandison and relied on multiple London printing firms to help him produce an authentic edition before the pirated version was sold. The first four volumes were published on 13 November 1753, and in December the next two would follow. The remaining volume was published in March to complete a seven volume series while a six volume set was simultaneously published, and these met success. In Grandison, Richardson was unwilling to risk having a negative response to any [...] "rakish" [...] characteristics that Lovelace embodied and denigrated the immoral characters [...] "to show those mischievous young admirers of Lovelace once and for all that the rake should be avoided".|$|E

In an election fought on tax, the Democrats publicly stated that they liked neither the Liberal (GST) tax package or the Labor package, but pledged to work with whichever party was elected to make their tax package better. They campaigned with the slogan [...] "No GST on food". <b>A</b> majority <b>of</b> the senators in the party room agreed to pass the bill if some amendments were made, mostly to exclude fresh food and essential items such as basic medicines.

60|$|The voyage was our <b>idea</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>good</b> time. I {{built the}} Snark {{and paid for}} it, and for all expenses.

Promptly the magazine advertised that it was sending me especially {{around the world for}} itself. It was a wealthy magazine. And every man who had business dealings with the Snark charged three prices because forsooth the magazine could afford it. Down in the uttermost South Sea isle this myth obtained, and I paid accordingly. To this day everybody believes that the magazine paid for everything and that I made a fortune out of the voyage. It is hard, after such advertising, to hammer it into the human understanding that the whole voyage was done for the fun of it.|$|E
40|$|This {{paper is}} {{concerned}} with what Rob Nixon identifies as the representational challenges and imaginative dilemmas posed by slow violence, violence enacted slowly, almost imperceptibly, over time. In Oceania, this includes the long lasting effects of prolonged industrial mining, nuclear testing, and lately the impacts of global warming. Noting that the confrontation of slow violence questions the foundations <b>of</b> widely held <b>ideas</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>good</b> life, the paper addresses two questions. The first concerns the ending <b>of</b> <b>an</b> active mindset, or attitude, that drives unsustainable and destructive development, and its reorientation toward a properly ecological attitude. The second concerns the political practice it might take to enact such an ecological reorientation at a scale that makes <b>a</b> difference. Both <b>of</b> these questions, I will argue, call for <b>a</b> reconceptualization <b>of</b> representation and both can find answers in Oceanian attitudes and responses to history. With reference to specific examples, I will try to show how representational actions led by artists, activists and educators from Oceania realize what Isabelle Stengers calls <b>an</b> ecology <b>of</b> practices, at once expanding the scope of presentist democracy and offering an answer to Judith Butler’s question: “Can one lead <b>a</b> <b>good</b> life in <b>a</b> bad life?...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{seeks to}} {{understand}} the importance <b>of</b> adopting <b>an</b> ethical framework based on values in the socio-ethical discussion on nanotechnology and generally on emerging technologies. In particular, within such framework it is introduced a distinction between two ideal types of science, defined {{on the basis of}} their different aims. Such distinction is considered to be a useful guide in the ethical debate on the technological development of our society, because it may help to understand what are the values of science and their relations with our values as members of the social community. My point is that a reflection on the values of science is needed to make scientists aware of their responsibilities as scientists in the society. Once scientists have understood their responsibilities as scientists they could be involved in a broader ethical reflection on their responsibilities as citizens. Technological development makes sense only if intended as <b>an</b> evolution <b>of</b> socio-technical systems and it is not possible to make <b>an</b> ethical evaluation <b>of</b> such evolution without having established what are our values and our <b>idea</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> common <b>good.</b> For these reasons nanotechnology should deal with our values, our <b>idea</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> common <b>good,</b> and our being responsible as citizens...|$|R

60|$|In {{spite of}} the {{surprising}} discovery in his office {{of a young woman}} of such a disquieting, galvanic quality, it must not be supposed that Mr. Claude Ditmar intended to infringe upon a fixed principle. He had principles. For him, as for the patriarchs and householders of Israel, the seventh commandment was only relative, yet hitherto he had held rigidly to that relativity, laying down the sound doctrine that women and business would not mix: or, as he put it to his intimates, no sensible man would fool with a girl in his office. Hence it may be implied that Mr. Ditmar's experiences with the opposite sex had been on a property basis. He was one of those busy and successful persons who had never appreciated or acquired the art of quasi-platonic amenities, whose <b>idea</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>good</b> time was limited to discreet excursions with cronies, likewise busy and successful persons who, by reason of having married early and unwisely, are strangers to the delights of that higher social intercourse chronicled in novels and the public prints. If one may conveniently overlook the joys of a companionship of the soul, it is quite as possible to have a taste in women as in champagne or cigars. Mr. Ditmar preferred blondes, and he liked them rather stout, a predilection that had led him into matrimony with a lady of this description: a somewhat sticky, candy-eating lady with a mania for card parties, who undoubtedly would have dyed her hair if she had lived. He was not inconsolable, but he had had enough of marriage to learn that it demands a somewhat exorbitant price for joys otherwise more reasonably to be obtained.|$|E
