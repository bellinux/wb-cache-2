40|$|To {{examine the}} effects of {{different}} types of fertilizers and application methods on dry matter production, yield, nitrogen accumulation and use efficiency in rice cultivars, we used two rice cultivars (Nipponbare and Takanari) and five fertilizer methods, i. e. Control (0 N), Conventional method, <b>Deep</b> <b>fertilizer</b> method, Standard fertilizer method and High fertilizer method in 2009. Dry matter production was more markedly increased with nitrogen fertilizer application than in control, and it was higher with <b>deep</b> <b>fertilizer</b> application in Takanari and standard fertilizer application in Nipponbare, respectively. The differences in dry matter production resulted from CGR and mean LAI in rice cultivars. Greater dry matter production was accompanied with the nitrogen accumulation at harvesting. Rice cultivars accumulated the largest amount of nitrogen at <b>deep</b> <b>fertilizer</b> application. Higher fertilizer application increased the number of panicle and total spikelets m– 2. The higher grain yield in Takanari resulted from the larger sink capacity. The grain yield of rice cultivars tended to be higher with <b>deep</b> <b>fertilizer</b> application due to the increase in sink capacity. Both <b>deep</b> <b>fertilizer</b> application and basal application of slow-release fertilizer increased the recovery efficiency and partial factor productivity of applied N, however, using slow-release fertilizer is recommended in terms of labor saving and lower cost. 　水稲の乾物生産，収量，窒素利用効率に及ぼす肥料と施肥法の影響を試験するため，水稲品種日本晴とタカナリを供試し，対照区（無施肥），慣行施肥区（分割追肥），深層追肥区，標準緩効性肥料基肥施肥区，倍量緩効性肥料基肥施肥区の５試験区を用いて栽培を行った．窒素施肥とともに，乾物生産が増大し，最終乾物重はタカナリでは深層追肥区，日本晴では標準緩効性肥料基肥施肥区で最も高くなった．乾物重の相違には個体群成長速度と葉面積指数が主として影響していた．収穫期の乾物重が大きいほど，窒素蓄積が多くなった．窒素蓄積量は両品種ともに深層追肥区で多くなった．施肥量の増加は穂数と㎡当たり穎花数を増加させた．タカナリの収量が高いことには，シンク容量が大きいことが関係した．両品種ともに慣行施肥区に比べ深層追肥区の収量が高くなったが，これにはシンク容量の拡大が関係していた．深層追肥区，標準緩効性肥料基肥施肥区ともに慣行施肥区に比べ窒素回収効率，部分要因生産性ともに向上したが，省力・低コストの観点からは施肥効率の高い緩効性肥料の利用が推奨された...|$|R

To determine the accident scenarios, causes, and technical solutions, a narrative analysis of 14 reports of accidents that led to moderate and serious injuries from 2008 to 2010 was done, eight victims interviewed, and seven accident machines and eight new ones, which were sold in 2013, evaluated according to applicable regulations. Mostly farm managers were involved in accidents with mineral <b>fertilizer</b> <b>distributors</b> during coupling and uncoupling and filling mainly on the farmyard. During coupling and uncoupling, farm managers collided with the machine itself, and during filling with the fertilizer chunks of the big bags.

I study the use of hybrid maize and fertilizer in Kenya, where there are persistent cross-sectional differences in aggregate adoption rates with a large fraction of households switching in and out of adoption. By allowing for selection of farmers into technology use via comparative advantage differences, I examine whether the yield returns to adopting hybrid maize vary across farmers. If so, high average returns can coexist with low returns for the marginal farmer. My findings indicate the existence of two interesting subgroups in the population. A small group of farmers has potentially high returns from adopting the technologies. Yet, they do not adopt. This lack of adoption appears to stem from supply and infrastructure constraints, such as the distance to <b>fertilizer</b> <b>distributors.</b> In addition, a larger group of farmers faces very low returns to adopting hybrid maize, but chooses to adopt.

Totally 3312 sown rows after each seed coulter with a length of 3 meters were individually harvested during 1979 - 1982. The uptake of nutrient was found to be extremely local but the indirect effect of the influence has a wider range. The interaction between plants gives the crop a ’strategy’ to best benefit from placed nutrient. This strategy, however, does not always seem to result in maximizing the quantity of the yield.

Conclusive results for benefits of deep banding of P fertilizers for plant yield in reduced tillage system are still lacking. Knowledge of the dominant solid P species present in soil following application of P fertilizers and linking that to potential P availability would help us to design better P management practices. The objectives of this research were to understand the influence of placement (broadcast- vs. deep band-P or <b>deep</b> placed-P), <b>fertilizer</b> source (granular- versus liquid-P), and time on reaction products of P. Greenhouse and field based experiments were conducted to study P behavior in soils. Soil pH, resin extractable P, total P, and speciation of P were determined at different distances from the point of fertilizer application at 5 weeks (greenhouse and field) and 6 months (field) after P application (at rate 75 kg/ha) to a soil system that was under long-term reduced tillage. X-ray absorption near edge structure spectroscopy technique was used to speciate reaction products of fertilizer P in the soil. The reaction products of P formed upon addition of P fertilizers to soils were found to be influenced by soil pH, P placement methods, and P sources. Acidic pH (below~ 5. 8) tended to favor formation of Fe-P and Al-P like forms whereas slightly acidic near neutral pH soils favored formation of Ca-P like forms.

40|$|This study {{assesses the}} economic, social, and {{environmental}} impacts of Large Field Models (LFMs) and their potential for promoting Climate-Smart Agriculture (CSA). In Vietnam, the government introduced the Large Field Model (LFM), a type of production organization, in which enterprises or cooperatives establish a cooperative relationship with farmers to apply a unification production procedure by providing production inputs (including material and technical support) and/or buying outputs from producers. These LFMs can be classified under three different forms based {{on the extent of}} those linkages: (1) farmers contribute land and/or labour to farmer cooperatives; (2) farmers sign contracts with cooperatives or enterprises and receive inputs; and (3) farmers lease out/sell their land to cooperatives or enterprises. Although the key objectives of constructing LFMs come from requirements in improving rice quality and rice production efficiency, these models also have potential for applying CSA to achieve three CSA pillars: productivity, resilience and mitigation. Productivity: the LFMs ensure integration between enterprises and farmers, wherein rice production is promoted, given that the output is sold at a more stable price. Therefore, farmers confidently manage their business to increase productivity. In addition, higher output price and lower production cost is observed from LFMs’ production. Better output price comes from the commitments of enterprises and higher rice quality produced from LFMs. The reduction in production costs is also achieved by taking advantage of economy of scale to apply modern agricultural machinery (such as tractors) and thus reduce labour costs. Resilience: this CSA pillar is created indirectly from LFMs. In general, as farmers use LFMs, they have a better chance to access certified seeds and follow the production procedures of enterprises under the direct support from technicians, and {{they are less likely to}} be exposed to disease epidemics than non-participant farmers. In addition, farmers who sign contracts with enterprises/cooperatives or work in LFMs tend to share their knowledge and discuss weather issues with technicians before deciding when to sow or harvest to reduce climate risks. Mitigation: the LFM production contributes to reduced GHG emissions. LFMs created a foundation to apply advanced cultivation methods and to follow strictly modern techniques such as: One Must Five Reductions (1 M 5 Rs), Three Reductions Three Gain (3 R 3 G), 4 Alternate Wetting and Drying (AWD), System of Rice Intensification (SRI), and <b>Deep</b> <b>Fertilizer</b> Placement (DPF). The synchronized irrigation timing or flattened surface field of LFMs also contributes more efficient water use. Moreover, this model changes farmer behaviours toward more efficient and environmentally friendly paddy straw treatment to mitigate environmental impacts. In sum, there are potentials for promoting CSA application in LFMs. The integration developed through LFMs will produce friendly and mutually beneficial networks of farmers to share knowledge and modern techniques. This also encourages farmers to improve cultivating skills and output quality to sustain their contracts with better enterprises in the long run. In addition, the pressure from climate risks will push farmers to act collectively to adapt and mitigate environmental impacts. These potentials should be accompanied by the strong support from the government through its response to climate changes in the Nationally Determined Contribution (NDCs). However, there are still many constraints for expanding CSA application into LFMs. First, traditional cultivation and small landholding habits make it difficult for enterprises to accumulate land to form LFMs. Even when farmers agree to contribute their land to cooperatives, this model is still struggling to establish the appropriate benefit-sharing method in order to keep it working smoothly in the long run, especially due to land price fluctuations. Second, there are infrastructure-related issues. Some types of CSA practices require infrastructure support, for example irrigation systems for applying Alternate Wetting and Drying (AWD). Finally, there is a need for a legal mechanism to bind contracts between enterprises and farmers, especially under high price volatility. Vietnam’s policy system to enhance CSA application and expand LFMs is still characterized by limitations related to effectiveness, validation and public-private participation. This requires a change to attract the participation of local government, enterprises, and farmers. For example, experience from other countries shows that in the case of small scale production, legal measures would not be feasible because of high transaction costs. Therefore, using community value to bind farmers to contracts is the most feasible measure that has been proven. In addition, support for developing agricultural insurance and infrastructure investment is important. However, before expanding CSA application into LFMs, detailed studies of LFMs in each region are required because each model might be more efficient for one specific region with a specific crop...|$|R

But getting it down to that depth is hard work, so the engineers compromised and aimed at a depth of 4 to 5 cm. Many machines were designed and tried but IRRI have selected two or three designs which are suited to different soil conditions. The applicator has a small auger that drills the fertilizer into the soil and then closes up the furrow as it moves forward. The auger itself moves up and down, taking its drive from the wheels. There are single, two and four-row machines that can be easily pushed through the paddy either just before or just after transplanting. Using the applicators it is possible {{to increase the amount of}} fertilizer that reaches the crop from 30 % to 50 %, and IRRI researchers expect rice farmers to use up to 50 % less fertilizer to get the same yields. There are now over 100 machines in operation, 50 in the Philippines and the remainder in other Asian countries. So far the machines have been well received by farmers. The next stage is to get local manufacturers to produce the applicators. For further information write to: International Rice Research Institute P.

To design management interventions aimed at increasing rainfed rice production, {{the magnitude of}} and variation in yield gaps associated with various constraining factors need to be assessed. This study aimed at improved understanding of spatial and temporal variations in water status and nutrient availabilities, and their effects on crop growth and yield for rainfed rice along toposequences in SE Asia, {{as a basis for}} the design of improved crop management strategies. To realize these objectives, statistical and systems analyses were used to quantify the effects of yield-determining, yield-limiting, and yield-reducing factors and to identify management options along toposequences in sloping rainfed rice areas in Indonesia and Thailand. Field experiments were conducted from 1995 – 2000 at Jakenan Experiment Station, Indonesia and from 2000 – 2002 in farmers’ fields in rainfed rice areas in Indonesia and Thailand. These areas have similar rainfall levels and represent the common single rainfed rice system (in Thailand) and the (one) more intensive double rainfed rice system (in Indonesia) The ORYZA 2000 crop growth simulation model adequately simulated rice yields at various levels of fertilizer N under irrigated and rainfed conditions in the study area in Indonesia. Simulated potential yields ranged from 3. 74 (for crops sown in October) to 5. 53 Mg ha − 1 (for crops sown in July). Groundwater depth {{had a significant impact on}} the effects of establishment date, <b>deep</b> tillage, <b>fertilizer</b> application, and supplementary irrigation performance of on rainfed rice sown towards the end of the wet season. In farmers’ fields in Indonesia and Thailand, substantial differences were recorded in field hydrology, exchangeable K, organic C and clay content among different toposequence positions. Differences were also observed in yield and in the magnitude of yield increase due to intensive weed control and/or application of recommended fertilizer doses, but these differences were not consistent across countries, seasons, and years. In Indonesia, the yield constraints of rainfed lowland rice in the research station and in farmers’ fields were identified based on analyses of yield gaps associated with the interactive effects of water and nutrient stress, taking into account the incidence of rice pests. There were consistently wide yield gaps due to water, N and K limitations, and pest infestations. These results indicate substantial scope for increasing rainfed rice yields through timely establishment, deep tillage, supplementary irrigation, application of N and K fertilizers and pest control. Combining various methodologies in estimating reference yields provided increased understanding of the constraints to rainfed lowland rice production and this set of tools could be applied to other locations to identify yield constraints and management options to increase production, provided that the necessary experimental data required for such a comprehensive analysis are available. ...|$|R
40|$|Dairy {{farms in}} the San Carlos region of Costa Rica {{commonly}} utilize stargrass (Cynodon nlemfuensis) with a stocking rate averaging 2. 6 animals/ha/year. The research site was located in Aguas Zarcas, Costa Rica, and received an average annual precipitation of 432 cm. This location is characterized as a humid tropical biome. Serious soil compaction due to cattle traffic was evident through redoximorphic features beginning at 7. 5 cm below the soil surface in the stargrass dairy pastures; therefore, we hypothesized that compaction may be impeding forage production by diminished root growth and nutrient uptake. The objectives of this one year study were to characterize existing pasture conditions with regard to soil physical properties, and {{to determine the effect}} of stocking density, <b>deep</b> tillage, and <b>fertilizer</b> rate on soil bulk density, forage yield, and forage quality. Nine stargrass pastures with three different stocking densities were studied to assess the effect of tillage and fertilizer rate on forage yield and quality. The experimental design was such that the whole plot treatments where high (385 head/ha), medium (192 head/ha), and low (128 head/ha) stocking density. Stocking density treatments were not randomized due to limitations of management practices; however for experimental design purposes we treated them as randomized. The sub plot treatment was tillage, where each pasture was divided in half with deep tillage (35 cm) applied to one subplot and no tillage treatment on the other subplots. The sub-sub plot treatments were three fertilizer treatments; no fertilizer, 50 % of the recommended fertilizer rate, and the recommended fertilizer rate. Soil bulk density was measured at three depths before tillage, one month after tillage, and one year after tillage. Bulk density samples were taken at the soil surface, 7. 5 cm, 18 cm, and measured 0. 8 Mg/m 3, 0. 9 Mg/m 3, and 0. 9 Mg/m 3 for the three depths respectively, before treatments were in place. There were no statistical differences between tillage treatments for soil bulk density. Bulk density was not consistently measured in the tillage furrow, and so it might not have accurately measured tillage results. There were no statistically significant differences between treatments for forage yield. Additionally, stocking density was the only treatment with statistically significant differences for forage quality. The highest stocking density plots had the best forage quality (p≤ 0. 05). Seasonal differences in forage production were consistent with weather patterns. Rainy season forage production yielded more, with poorer quality than the semi-dry season. Pasture yield averaged 4225 kg/ha for rainy months, 3582 kg/ha for semi-dry months, and ranged from 3056 to 5691 kg/ha each month. ...|$|R
40|$|The {{system of}} rice {{intensification}} (SRI) developed in Madagascar in the 1980 s {{has been promoted}} as an integrated crop and resource management approach to rice-cultivation, especially for resource-limited smallholder farms. While advocates have claimed that SRI could boost rice yields with less external input, many criticisms have challenged its effectiveness regarding yields and applicability to larger-scale rice farming systems. In this study, we conducted a field survey and on-farm experiments to assess rice yield performance and key management practices on {{a few of the}} early SRI-practicing smallholder farms in the central highland of Madagascar. Rice grain yields at the survey fields were 9. 9 Â tÂ ha- 1 maximum without using mineral <b>fertilizer.</b> <b>Deep</b> plowing to the depth of 25 - 30 Â cm as well as SRI practices have been conducted continuously since the early 1990 s. In addition, an effective drainage system facilitated intensive water management at these high-yielding fields. On-farm experiments demonstrated some yield increases with no interaction for the examined SRI practices, though the effects were not great enough to explain the high yields at these fields. The soils of these high-yielding fields contained relatively large amounts of soil organic carbon (SOC) from the surface to the deep soil layers, and the soil mineralizable nitrogen was closely correlated with rice grain yields. The results indicated that the high yields at the fields of those who were early to adopt SRI were mainly due to the soil fertility associated with great nitrogen-supplying ability, rather than 'synergetic effects' of the SRI components. This high N-supplying ability of the soil and accumulated SOC from surface to deep soil layers were attributable to the long-term combined practices of extensive organic applications and deep plowing. Soil hydrology could be another key factor stimulating high rates of soil N-mineralization. These management practices were, however, only applied to the limited numbers of fields within less than 1. 0 Â ha of total landholdings of these farmers due to the great demand in labor and organic resources and the difficulty in controlling irrigation water. Intensive weeding and widely spaced transplanting of young seedlings were also performed in the fields with irrigation and drainage systems sufficient to avoid yield losses from flooding and drought. Although extensive and long-term systematic research is further required to fully assess the benefits of this sort of intensive management as opposed to conventional methods, the preferential allocation of intensive management by the successful SRI-adopters might be the implication of its location-specificity and difficulty in scaling up even within the resource-limited smallholder farms.
