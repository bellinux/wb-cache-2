5|$|The first NY5A was a {{short-lived}} designation for {{the portion of}} modern NY5 east of Buffalo. When <b>it</b> <b>existed</b> from 1924 to the mid-1920s, NY5 was routed on what is now US20.|$|E
5|$|The season's {{activity}} was reflected with an accumulated cyclone energy (ACE) rating of 57. ACE is, broadly speaking, {{a measure of}} the power of the hurricane multiplied by the length of time <b>it</b> <b>existed,</b> so storms that last a long time, as well as particularly strong hurricanes, have high ACEs.|$|E
5|$|After the Second World War, Māori were {{discouraged}} from speaking {{their own language}} (te reo Māori) in schools and workplaces and <b>it</b> <b>existed</b> as a community language only in a few remote areas. It has recently undergone a process of revitalisation, being declared one of New Zealand's official languages in 1987, and is spoken by 3.7% of the population. There are now Māori language immersion schools and two television channels that broadcast predominantly in Māori. Many places have both their Māori and English names officially recognised.|$|E

5|$|As <b>it</b> <b>existed</b> at the time, M-144 {{started at}} the {{headquarters}} for the Michigan State Police next to the campus of Michigan State College, now Michigan State University. The highway ran north along Harrison Road next to campus and across the Red Cedar River. North of the river, the trunkline terminated at the junction with Michigan Avenue (then M-39, now the unsigned M-143).|$|E
5|$|Galaxies are {{categorized}} {{according to}} their visual morphology as elliptical, spiral, or irregular. Many galaxies {{are thought to have}} black holes at their active centers. The Milky Way's central black hole, known as Sagittarius A*, has a mass four million times greater than the Sun. As of March 2016, GN-z11 is the oldest and most distant observed galaxy with a comoving distance of 32 billion light-years from Earth, and observed as <b>it</b> <b>existed</b> just 400 million years after the Big Bang.|$|E
5|$|M-56 {{was a state}} {{trunkline}} {{highway in}} the southeastern part of the US state of Michigan. <b>It</b> <b>existed</b> from 1919 until 1957. The highway ran north from Monroe, where it connected with US Highway24 (US24, Telegraph Road), to Flat Rock where it terminated at an intersection with US24/US25. Before a series of truncations in the 1950s, the highway continued along the Huron River to New Boston and Belleville. The trunkline was progressively scaled back to Flat Rock before being decommissioned in 1957.|$|E

5|$|One of the adaptations made to Palladianism in America {{was that}} the piano nobile now tended {{to be placed on}} the ground floor, rather than above a service floor, as was the {{tradition}} in Europe. This service floor, if <b>it</b> <b>existed</b> at all, was now a discreet semi-basement. This negated the need for an ornate external staircase leading to the main entrance as in the more original Palladian designs. This would also be a feature of the neoclassical style that followed Palladianism.|$|E
5|$|Over {{the course}} of its existence, it {{followed}} a 7,165-mile (13,280-km) path from the eastern Pacific to the western Pacific {{and back to the}} central Pacific, lasting 31days in total. Because <b>it</b> <b>existed</b> in both the eastern and western Pacific, John was one of a small number of tropical cyclones to be designated as both a hurricane and a typhoon. Despite lasting for a full month, John barely affected land at all, bringing only minimal effects to the Hawaiian Islands and the United States military base on Johnston Atoll. Its remnants later affected Alaska.|$|E
5|$|The Diet of the Kingdom of Galicia and Lodomeria, {{and of the}} Grand Duchy of Cracow was the {{regional}} assembly of the Kingdom of Galicia and Lodomeria, a crown land of the Austrian Empire, and later Austria-Hungary. In {{the history of the}} Polish parliaments, it is considered the successor of the former sejm walny, or general sejm of the Kingdom of Poland and the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth, and also of the sejmik, or local councils, in the territories of the Austrian Partition. <b>It</b> <b>existed</b> from 1861 until the dissolution of Austria-Hungary in 1918.|$|E

5|$|The {{campaign}} {{period for}} parties and candidates began on 11 March and continued until 1 April. It was {{split into two}} phases by Nyepi, the Balinese day of silence. Parties delivered their national agendas indoors between 11 and 25 March. Although this was meant to encourage dialogue between parties and their constituents, these events were poorly attended. The International Foundation for Electoral Systems conducted a tracking survey that showed not all voters knew how to vote for candidates of the new DPD, or were even aware <b>it</b> <b>existed.</b>|$|E
5|$|The season's {{activity}} {{was reflected in}} a low cumulative accumulated cyclone energy (ACE) rating of 32. ACE is, broadly speaking, {{a measure of the}} power of the hurricane multiplied by the length of time <b>it</b> <b>existed,</b> so storms that last a long time, as well as particularly strong hurricanes, have high ACEs. ACE is only calculated for full advisories on tropical systems at or exceeding 34knots (39mph, 63km/h) or tropical storm strength.|$|E

ACE is only calculated for full advisories on tropical systems at or exceeding 34knots (39mph, 63km/h) or tropical storm strength. Although officially, subtropical cyclones are excluded from the total, the figure above includes periods when storms were in a subtropical phase.|$|E
