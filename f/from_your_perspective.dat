From a scientific perspective, the [...] "wind pushing {{on the side of}} the projectile" [...] is not what causes horizontal wind drift. What causes wind drift is drag. Drag makes the projectile turn into the wind, much like a weather vane, keeping the centre of air pressure on its nose. This causes the nose to be cocked (<b>from</b> <b>your</b> <b>perspective)</b> into the wind, the base is cocked (<b>from</b> <b>your</b> <b>perspective)</b> [...] "downwind." [...] So, (again <b>from</b> <b>your</b> <b>perspective),</b> the drag is pushing the projectile downwind in a nose to tail direction.|$|E

More generally, the available means of production we have learned to access and use in fulfilling an activity task are instrumental in forming our conceptions of the objects we produce and perceive (Baird, 2004; Chase & Abrahamson, 2015; Meira, 1998; Rosenbaum & Abrahamson, 2016).|$|R

50|$|These loans {{have been}} {{described}} as tax-disadvantaged, on the theory that the 401(k) contains before-tax dollars, but the loan is repaid with after-tax dollars. While this is precisely correct, the analysis is fundamentally flawed with regard to the loan principal amounts. <b>From</b> <b>your</b> <b>perspective</b> as the borrower, this is identical to a standard loan where you are not taxed when you get the loan, but you have to pay it back with taxed dollars. However, the interest portion of the loan repayments, which are essentially additional contributions to the 401(k), are made with after-tax funds but they do not increase the after-tax basis in the 401(k). Therefore, upon distribution/conversion of those funds the owner will have to pay taxes on those funds a second time.|$|E

40|$|According to Hector-Neri Castañeda, indexical {{reference}} is our most basic means of identifying the objects and events we experience and think about. Its tokens reveal our own {{part in the}} process by denoting what are "referred to as items present in experience" (Castañeda 1981, 285 - 6). If you hear me say, "Take that box over there and set it next to this box here, " you learn something about my orientation towards the referents {{in a way that}} is not conveyed by, "Take the red box and set it next to the blue box. " My indexical tokens express what they do not only because they issue from a unique spatio-temporal perspective that I happen to occupy, but also because they reflect my encounter with referents that are differently situated in that perspective. <b>From</b> <b>your</b> <b>perspective,</b> my here might be your there, my you your she, and within my own, a this differs from a that and one this diverges from another.

40|$|Why can't you {{get what}} you really want from IT? All you desire is a ready-and-willing partner to help you exploit IT to drive your business. Instead, you get endless rules and regulations, not to mention processes, projects, and {{technologies}} that deliver too little, too late, for too much. It's frustrating! How to build a relationship that puts you firmly in control and produces the business results you need? In The 8 Things We Hate About IT, Susan Cramm provides the answers. Start by understanding differences between operational and IT managers - in backgrounds, personality, pressures, and incentives. Cramm explains how differences prevent operational managers and IT from communicating what, why, and how they do what they do. Citing case studies and stories, the author then presents practical strategies for overcoming the difficulty. These include seeing things <b>from</b> <b>your</b> IT partners' <b>perspective,</b> developing a single version of 'truth,' and assuming accountability for IT just as you've done for management of your firm's financial and human resources. Brutally honest, provocative, and filled with sound advice, this book reveals that the key to solving the IT problem is decidedly un-IT: it's a deeper understanding of human behavior, including how to apply your leadership skills to the world of IT...|$|R
