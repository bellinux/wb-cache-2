500|$|With {{regards to}} {{presumptive}} 2016 GOP nominee Donald Trump, Cryer shared his feelings on the May 5, 2016, {{episode of the}} podcast Never Not Funny. Cryer stated, [...] "I have been pointing out, and I have been screaming to the rooftops, that Donald Trump is the Charlie Sheen of politics. [...] I have to tell you, I love Charlie Sheen, I loved working {{with him when he}} was sober, but he was, he's <b>full</b> <b>of</b> <b>shit.</b> He has been <b>full</b> <b>of</b> <b>shit,</b> you know, he has serious addiction. You know, his addiction is obviously serious, drugs, and, but, Trump is just addicted to feeling important. You know, and I think if anybody is under the delusion that he cares about, uh, uh, anybody in America besides himself, they are, they are stoned and need to rethink their priorities, 'cause he's, you know, 'cause it's just ridiculous that's he's gotten as far as he has." ...|$|E
500|$|A black marketeer {{who makes}} a living dealing Kaiju organs. Perlman stated, [...] "I {{actually}} think this character {{was designed to be}} played by another ethnicity other than myself. And somewhere along the way, [...] had the notion, 'Wouldn't it be interesting to turn this guy into more of an invention.' So, in other words, somebody takes on a persona that completely sounds like he's someone else and acts like he's someone else but he's really, you know, as you see me. That added a dimension to the larger-than-life aspect of the character… I'm playing somebody very close to my own origins. But a completely made-up persona… which makes him even more <b>full</b> <b>of</b> <b>shit.</b> And I think that's the charm of the guy—that he's kind of elusive, hard to pin down." [...] Pacific Rim marks Perlman's fifth appearance in a del Toro film. The director stated: [...] "I think the moment you have a guy that is called Hannibal Chau and Ron shows up, and he's from Brooklyn and he's been selling black market organs, you know the whole story… That's all I need to know. If it's any other actor, there's a lot more explaining to do. But when Ron comes in with that look, {{you can make your own}} story and it'll be as compelling as anything I can invent. You do a little weightlifting with the audience." [...] The bird tattoos on Chau's fingers indicate his past as a gangster. In the film, Chau states he took the name from his favorite historical figure and his second-favorite Szechuan restaurant in Brooklyn. Del Toro drew inspiration from Burt Lancaster's performance in Elmer Gantry when writing the character.|$|E
2500|$|Politically, Parker {{describes}} himself as libertarian, as does his partner Matt Stone. Parker summed up his views with the comment, [...] "What we're sick of—and it's getting even worse—is: you either like Michael Moore or you wanna fuckin' go overseas and shoot Iraqis. There can't be a middle ground. Basically, if you think Michael Moore's <b>full</b> <b>of</b> <b>shit,</b> then you are a super-Christian right-wing whatever. And we're both just pretty middle-ground guys. We find just as many things to rip on on the left as we do on the right. People {{on the far left}} and the far right are the same exact person to us." ...|$|E
2500|$|In 2008, {{speaking}} to Kerrang!, Max Cavalera remembered: [...] "This certainly {{got in touch}} with the dark side of Sepultura. [...] "Refuse/Resist" [...] is an anti-police song – a real piece of anarchy. You could call the album riot music. It was <b>full</b> <b>of</b> heavy <b>shit</b> and some <b>of</b> it was risky, but it was just where we were coming from at the time. [...] "Manifest" [...] is also very close to me. That's about a massacre of prisoners by police at a jail in São Paulo. One hundred and eleven prisoners were killed, and one of my friends was there and took pictures of it all, one of which we used in the artwork." ...|$|R
5000|$|Ellroy {{addresses}} the book's strong racial overtone {{in an interview}} with Rolling Stone.Oh yeah... You're supposed to be seduced and shocked by the casual racism in Blood's a Rover. This book is so <b>full</b> <b>of</b> race <b>shit,</b> it's fucking hilarious shit. There's a lot of scenes of black people and white people cracking jokes. And as much as the people grandstand about race in this book, they're driven by racial animus and the idea of racial reconciliation. Because of political correctness we are losing the outrageousness of humor. I always think of Frank O'Connor's line from a million years ago: [...] "a literature that cannot be vulgarized is not literature at all and will not last." ...|$|R

2500|$|... "Talking bollocks" [...] {{generally}} means talking nonsense or bullshit, for example: [...] "Don't {{listen to}} him, he's talking bollocks", or [...] "...talking absolute bollocks". Another example is [...] "I told Maurice {{that he was}} talking bollocks, that he was <b>full</b> <b>of</b> <b>shit</b> and that his opinions were a pile of piss. (Rhetoric was always my indulgence.)" [...] "Talking bollocks" [...] in a corporate context {{is referred to as}} bollockspeak. Bollockspeak tends to be buzzword-laden and largely content-free, like gobbledygook: [...] "Rupert, we'll have to leverage our synergies to facilitate a paradigm shift by Q4" [...] is an example of management bollockspeak. There is a whole parodic book entitled The Little Book of Management Bollocks. When a great deal of bollocks is being spoken, it may be said that the 'bollocks quotient' is high.|$|E
2500|$|Griffin is {{sometimes}} {{the object of}} her own humor, {{particularly with regard to}} her D-list status. While Griffin paints herself as a Hollywood outsider, she has a group of close celebrity friends such as Rosie O'Donnell, Joan Rivers, Jerry Seinfeld, Gloria Estefan, Whoopi Goldberg, Jennifer Coolidge, Rachel True, Larry David, Ricky Gervais, Anderson Cooper, Cher and Lance Bass. Griffin's longtime friendship with Bass was the catalyst for a feud between her and gossip blogger Perez Hilton, in which Griffin expressed anger over Hilton's [...] "outing" [...] of Bass on his website, calling Hilton's attacks on Bass [...] "mean" [...] and [...] "unfunny". Hilton responded by saying that Griffin's anger was hypocritical, considering all of the gay jokes she makes about Clay Aiken in her stand-up routines. In 2007, Griffin commented on her aversion to making fun of celebrity friends by saying, [...] "There's nothing I won't do, {{but on the other hand}} I'm <b>full</b> <b>of</b> <b>shit</b> because that changes. For example, you know Lance Bass from 'N Sync and how he's gay now? All those years that I knew he was gay, he and I were friends, I would never say, 'Hey, by the way, did you know that Lance Bass is gay?'" [...] Griffin and Hilton ended their feud after the death of Griffin's father, and Hilton appeared on an episode of her show in 2007. Yet in July 2008, he asserted that Griffin's assistant Jessica Zajicek had quit because she could not take Griffin's now hectic career. Griffin dismissed these statements as false as Zajicek is still working for Griffin. However, the season premiere of The D-List depicted that Zajicek was no longer working for Griffin; Griffin explained early in the episode that Zajicek [...] "has decided to move on".|$|E
5000|$|In {{this form}} the word {{can also be}} used in phrases such as don't give me that shit or you're <b>full</b> <b>of</b> <b>shit.</b> The term <b>full</b> <b>of</b> <b>shit</b> is often used as an exclamation to charge someone who is {{believed}} to be prone to dishonesty, exaggeration or is thought to be [...] "phoney" [...] with an accusation. For example: ...|$|E
5000|$|The term piece <b>of</b> <b>shit</b> is {{generally}} used to classify {{a product or}} service as being sufficiently below the writer's understanding of generally accepted quality standards to be of negligible and perhaps even negative value. The term piece <b>of</b> <b>shit</b> has greater precision than shit or shitty in that piece <b>of</b> <b>shit</b> identifies the low quality of a specific component or output of a process without applying a derogatory slant to the entire process. For example, if one said [...] "The inner city youth orchestra has been a remarkably successful initiative in that it has kept young people off the streets after school and exposed them to culture and discipline, thereby improving their self esteem and future prospects. The fact that the orchestra's recent rendition of Tchaikovsky's Manfred Symphony in B minor was pretty much a piece <b>of</b> <b>shit</b> should {{not in any way}} detract from this." [...] The substitution <b>of</b> <b>shit</b> or shitty for pretty much a piece <b>of</b> <b>shit</b> would imply irony and would therefore undermine the strength of the statement.|$|R
