40|$|International audiencePurpose. We {{evaluated}} how {{the performance}} of recognizing familiar face images depends on the internal (eyebrows, eyes, nose, mouth) and external face features (chin, outline of face, hairline) in individuals with central vision loss. Methods. In experiment 1, we measured eye movements for four observers with central vision loss {{to determine whether they}} fixated more often on the internal or the external features of face images while attempting to recognize the images. We then measured the accuracy for recognizing face images that contained only the internal, only the external, or both internal and external features (experiment 2) and for hybrid images where the internal and external features came from two different source images (experiment 3) for five observers with central vision loss and four age-matched <b>control</b> <b>observers.</b> Results. When recognizing familiar face images, approximately 40 % of the fixations of observers with central vision loss was centered on the external features of faces. The recognition accuracy was higher for images containing only external features (66. 8 +/- 3. 3 % correct) than for images containing only internal features (35. 8 +/- 15. 0 %), a finding contradicting that <b>of</b> <b>control</b> <b>observers.</b> For hybrid face images, observers with central vision loss responded more accurately to the external features (50. 4 +/- 17. 8 %) than to the internal features (9. 3 +/- 4. 9 %), whereas <b>control</b> <b>observers</b> did not show the same bias toward responding to the external features. Conclusions. Contrary to people with normal vision who rely more on the internal features of face images for recognizing familiar faces, individuals with central vision loss show a higher dependence on using external features of face images...|$|R

40|$|AbstractSpatial {{uncertainty}} and undersampling {{are two of}} the major hypotheses for the losses of amblyopic spatial vision. To test these two hypotheses, equivalent spatial {{uncertainty and}} spatial integration efficiency in spatial position judgments were quantified with a spatial perturbation paradigm. Specifically, three-line bisection thresholds were measured for the amblyopic eyes of two strabismic and two anisometropic amblyopes, and for normal controls. The horizontal stimulus lines comprised discrete dark dots distributed randomly around the mean line position according to a gaussian function. Line separation, the number of dots on each line (N), stimulus contrast (C), and the vertical standard deviation (σe) of the dot distribution were varied. An ideal observer analysis quantified the magnitude of equivalent spatial uncertainty (σs), the effective number of dots used (k), and spatial integration efficiency (kN). At the optimal separation, equivalent spatial uncertainty (σs) is approximately ten-fold higher in both types of amblyopic visual systems than in <b>control</b> <b>observers,</b> even when stimulus visibility is accounted for. This apparent increase in σs is largely due to a shift in spatial scale of analysis in the amblyopic eye. Integration efficiency (kN) increases in proportion to stimulus contrast or visibility (in units of detection threshold). Unlike σs, kN is different between the two types of amblyopia. For the anisometropic observers, kN is quantitatively similar to that <b>of</b> <b>control</b> <b>observers.</b> For the strabismic observers, on the other hand, kN is reduced even after taking stimulus visibility into account. The decreased spatial integration efficiency in the strabismic visual system suggests that spatial undersampling may occur at a secondary stage of visual processing, beyond the detection stage...|$|R
40|$|A formal {{model of}} the bank {{borrowing}} decision by the small firm is provided to explain why some entrepreneurs borrow and others do not, and why some businesses grow and others remain stationary over long periods. Loan capital is productive and increases the firm's revenue but brings the business under the <b>control</b> <b>of</b> the bank. Profits generated by borrowing are a 'good' increasing owner utility whereas control is a 'bad', reducing it. The consequent tradeoff between borrowing and control implies that the business' optimum will involve borrowing less than the amount tt;at maximises profits. If owner control-aversion is strong enough equilibrium may involve a corner solution with the business being entirely self-funding. The above result holds under conditions of symmetric information and zero credit rationing.

The efficacy of these processes may depend {{on the extent of}} overlap between neural circuitry mediating the different tasks; more effective task preparation (and by extension smaller switch costs) is achieved when this overlap is small. We investigated the performance costs associated with switching tasks and/or switching sensory modalities. Participants discriminated either the identity or spatial location of objects that were presented either visually or acoustically. Switch costs between tasks were significantly smaller when the sensory modality of the task switched versus when it repeated. This was the case irrespective of whether the pre-trial cue informed participants only of the upcoming task, but not sensory modality (Experiment 1) or whether the pre-trial cue was informative about both the upcoming task and sensory modality (Experiment 2). In addition, in both experiments switch costs between the senses were positively correlated when the sensory modality of the task repeated across trials and not when it switched. The collective evidence supports the <b>independence</b> <b>of</b> <b>control</b> processes mediating task switching and modality switching and also the hypothesis that switch costs reflect competitive interference between neural circuits...|$|R
