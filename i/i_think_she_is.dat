She explained that, [...] "My job is not to disappoint , not to cheat them. And I feel like the last little appearance on GH cheated them.

[...] Soap Opera Digest later confirmed the character's name to be Genevieve Atkinson.

500|$|In {{addition}} to gameplay, {{she was also}} one of the first characters to have her backstory fleshed out. In an interview with PC Gamer, the game's creative director, Chris Metzen stated, [...] "Tracer [...] one of the first characters we really got to know. And while she wasn't particularly created to be a starring role, if you will, we felt on the team, the more we got to know her and play her, she was kind of like this Spider-Man type character for us. She's so rad, and it feels good to leverage her in the front of story ideas." [...] Tracer has also been noted for being a peppy character, with Hardcore Gamers Kevin Dunsmore describing her as a [...] "spunky Brit [...] full of little quips as she zips around the battlefield". Kaplan described [...] "Tracer [...] cute and playful, and she's the type of person who does everything with a wink and a smile." [...] In an interview with PCGamesN, game designer Michael Chu stated that [...] "the thing about Tracer is that she has a personality which is out of the norm for most people. She is incredibly optimistic, she is incredibly bubbly - it's part of her hero persona. We love her, <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>she</b> <b>is</b> very much one of the main characters of the game [...] really carry the torch of what the game is all about: heroism." [...] To reflect her English origin, Tracer is voiced by English actress Cara Theobold.|$|E
2500|$|In May 2005, Tom Cruise, {{an actor}} and scientologist whose beliefs frown upon psychiatry, {{condemned}} Brooke, both personally and professionally, for both using and speaking {{in favor of the}} antidepressant drug Paxil. As Cruise said, [...] "Here is a woman and I care about Brooke Shields, because <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>she</b> <b>is</b> an incredibly talented woman, you look at , where has her career gone?" [...] Shields responded that Cruise's statements about anti-depressants were [...] "irresponsible" [...] and [...] "dangerous." [...] She said that he should [...] "stick to fighting aliens" [...] (a reference to Cruise's starring role in War of the Worlds {{as well as some of}} the more esoteric aspects of Scientology doctrine and teachings), [...] "and let mothers decide the best way to treat postpartum depression." [...] The actress responded to a further attack by Cruise in an essay [...] "War of Words" [...] published in The New York Times on July 1, 2005, in which she made an individual case for the medication and said, [...] "In a strange way, it was comforting to me when my obstetrician told me that my feelings of extreme despair and my suicidal thoughts were directly tied to a biochemical shift in my body. Once we admit that postpartum is a serious medical condition, then the treatment becomes more available and socially acceptable. With a doctor's care, I have since tapered off the medication but, without it, I wouldn't have become the loving parent I am today." [...] On August 31, 2006, according to USAToday.com, Cruise privately apologized to Shields for the incident. Shields accepted Cruise's apology, which she said was [...] "heartfelt." [...] Three months later in November 2006, she and her husband attended the wedding of Cruise and Katie Holmes.|$|E
