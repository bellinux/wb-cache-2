40|$|We {{calculate}} the conductance of a circular constriction of radius a in an <b>insulating</b> <b>diaphragm</b> which separates two conducting half-spaces {{characterized by the}} mean free path ℓ. Our exact result interpolates between the Maxwell conductance in diffusive (ℓ≪ a) and the Sharvin conductance in ballistic (ℓ≫ a) transport regime. Following the earlier approach of Wexler we find the explicit form of the Green's function for the linearized Boltzmann operator. The formula for the conductance deviates by less than 11...|$|E
40|$|International audienceMajor {{challenges}} of micro thermal machines are the thermal insulation and mechanical tolerance {{in the case}} of sliding piston. Replacing piston by membrane in microengines can alleviate the latter and lead to planar architectures. However, the thermal isolation would call for very thick structures which are associated to too high resonant frequencies which are detrimental to the engine performances. A thermal and mechanical compromise is to be made. On the contrary, based on fluid structure interaction, using an incompressible fluid contained in a cavity sealed by deformable diaphragm {{it would be possible to}} design a thick, low frequency <b>insulating</b> <b>diaphragm.</b> The design involves a simple planar geometry that is easy to manufacture with standard microelectronics methods. An analytical fluid-structure model is proposed and theoretically validated. Experimental structures are realized and tested. The model is in agreement with the experimental results. A dimensionless model is proposed to design hybrid fluid structures for micromachines...|$|E
40|$|An annular arc {{accelerator}} (ANAA) {{shock tube}} driver {{has been developed}} that deposits the energy of an arc discharge into a flowing gas, which then expands and cools without any delay {{for the opening of}} a diaphragm. A simplified one-dimensional flow analysis of the ANAA shock tube has been performed, which indicates that shock velocities greater than 40 km/sec may be obtained using a 300 -kJ capacitor bank. The ANAA driver consists of a high-pressure driver, an expansion section, and an electrode section. In operation, the cold gas driver is pressurized until the diaphragm bursts, sending a pressure front down the expansion tube to the arc section. When the accelerated flow arrives at the electrode section, a 100 -capacitor, 300 -kJ capacitor bank is discharged either by breaking an <b>insulating</b> <b>diaphragm</b> between the electrodes or by the triggering of a series of external switches. Shock velocities of 28 km/sec have been obtained, and modifications are described that are expected to improve performance...|$|E
40|$|Abstract: {{this paper}} {{focuses on a}} {{intelligent}} performance testing system for lithium battery casting. The testing system can automatically cast the lithium battery in order to change its performances when it drops {{to the ground and}} suffers a major collision, at the same time, the testing system can test the changing performances. What is more, the paper gives the design project of the automatic casting mechanism and its optimizing method, improving PID controller, and parameters experiment method. The experimental results show that the testing system can successfully and accurately cast the lithium, it meets the technology requirements, furthermore, it can obtain the accurate testing datas. Preface: In the structure of the battery, the positive and negative priming way, make the polar activated by <b>insulating</b> <b>diaphragm</b> paper make poles, by means of a test, determine the battery in a certain height and toss, whether to keep in good condition, is an important index for the safe use of the battery. At present, the domestic manufacturer of lithium electricity application drop testing technology mainly include visual positioning test and the simple manual stroke, including visual positioning due to the need for human subjective judgment, obvious defective; Simple manua...|$|E
