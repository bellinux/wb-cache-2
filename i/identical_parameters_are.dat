40|$|Sometimes in {{chemical}} calculations, one must convert concentration expressions to one another. For instance, {{it might be}} necessary to express the concentration given in parts per million as molar concentration. In this puzzle-like easy exercise, the analyst has to convert the concentration of a solute from mass/volume percentage to mole/liter concentration and the opposite. To do this, the draggable green pieces should be placed correctly in the conversion expression. These pieces contain different ratios of physicochemical parameters (such as mL, g, mole and so). Start dropping the piece containing the final concentration expression (mole/L or g/ 100 mL) on the left member frame. Then, the three remaining pieces {{should be placed on}} frames beyond equal sign in the expression. A correct conversion is obtained when <b>identical</b> <b>parameters</b> <b>are</b> cancelled in both numerator and denominator. In this case, both sides of the expression have the same parameter ratio (i. e. mole/L or g/ 100 mL) Each piece can be laid on P zone before being dragged to the expression...|$|E
40|$|We {{investigate}} {{the accuracy of}} the second-order time-convolutionless (TCL 2) quantum master equation for the calculation of linear and nonlinear spectroscopies of multichromophore systems. We show that, even for systems with non-adiabatic coupling, the TCL 2 master equation predicts linear absorption spectra that are accurate over an extremely broad range of parameters and well beyond what would be expected based on the perturbative nature of the approach; non-equilibrium population dynamics calculated with TCL 2 for <b>identical</b> <b>parameters</b> <b>are</b> significantly less accurate. For third-order (two-dimensional) spectroscopy, the importance of population dynamics and the violation of the so-called quantum regression theorem degrade the accuracy of TCL 2 dynamics. To correct these failures, we combine the TCL 2 approach with a classical ensemble sampling of slow microscopic bath degrees of freedom, leading to an efficient hybrid quantum-classical scheme that displays excellent accuracy over a wide range of parameters. In the spectroscopic setting, the success of such a hybrid scheme can be understood through its separate treatment of homogeneous and inhomogeneous broadening. Importantly, the presented approach has the computational scaling of TCL 2, with the modest addition of an embarrassingly parallel prefactor associated with ensemble sampling. The presented approach can be understood as a generalized inhomogeneous cumulant expansion technique, capable of treating multilevel systems with non-adiabatic dynamics.

40|$|The local failure {{strains of}} {{essential}} reactor vessel components are investigated. The size {{influence of the}} components is of special interest. Typical severe accident conditions including elevated temperatures and dynamic loads are considered. The main part of work consists of test families with specimens under uniaxial and biaxial static and dynamic loads. Within one test family the specimen geometries and the load conditions are similar, the temperature is the same; but the size is varied up to reactor dimensions. Special attention is given to geometries with a hole or a notch causing non-uniform stress and strain distributions typical for reactor components. There are indications that for such non-uniform distributions size effects may be stronger than for uniform distributions. Thus size effects on the failure strains and failure processes are determined under realistic conditions. Several tests with nominal <b>identical</b> <b>parameters</b> <b>are</b> performed for small size specimens. In this way some information is obtained about the scatter. A reduced number of tests is carried out for medium size specimens {{and only a few}} tests are carried out for large size specimens to reduce the costs to an acceptable level. To manufacture all specimens sufficient material was available from the unused reactor pressure vessel Biblis C consisting of the material 22 NiMoCr 37. Thus variations of the mechanical material properties, which could impair the interpretation of the test results, are quite small. This has been confirmed by an adequate number of additional quality assurance tests. A key problem was the definition of failure and the determination of the local strains at failure for very different specimens under varying load conditions. Here appropriate methods had to be developed including the so-called 'vanishing gap method' and the 'forging die method'. They are based on post test geometrical measurements of the fracture surfaces and reconstructions of the related strain fields using finite element calculations, for instance. To deepen the understanding of structural degradation and fracture and to allow extrapolations, advanced computational methods including damage models have been developed and validated. The problems to be treated here are quite difficult. Micro-structural effects, for instance, play an important role. Therefore several approaches were tried in parallel. In some cases so-called non-local concepts, in other cases the description of stochastic properties at the grain size level are considered. The experimental results indicate that stresses versus dimensionless deformations are approximately size independent up to failure for specimens of similar geometry under similar load conditions.

40|$|As modern {{industry}} is automated {{the need for}} robots performing complex tasks increases. To achieve fully automated production both making the product and inspecting it for quality assurance needs to be automated. Robotic manufacturing processes {{have been around for}} a long time and has greatly increased the efficiency of modern industry. In this thesis existing framework for automatic 3 D inspection is examined, and an attempt at making a working 3 D inspection implementation is made. The work is centered around offline inspection planning, using a model reference to generate a path for fully inspecting a 3 D object with a sensor attached to a robot arm. Continuing previous work, the inspection planning algorithm proposed by A. Bircher et. al. 2015 is adapted further in an attempt to make it optimal for planning inspection of small to medium sized objects with an industrial robot arm. The modification of the structural inspection planning algorithm is evaluated compared against the algorithm without modification by comparing resulting path length and algorithm convergence. The augmentations appear to increase the performance of the inspection planning algorithm when planning in 5 dimensions. To simulate inspection with a UR 5 robot, a camera mount for the Intel RealSense SR 300 sensor is 3 D printed and attached to the wrist link. Sensor position relative to the wrist joint is measured and used to make a custom URDF and SRDF for the UR 5 such that collision between the sensor and other joints can be prevented and sensor position can be controlled accurately. The resulting inspection paths are simulated in Gazebo with two different approaches to motion planning. To further test in detail how effective individual improvements to the algorithm have been with regards to inspection path quality the algorithm is separated into different iterative versions, where the path generated by each version with otherwise <b>identical</b> <b>parameters</b> <b>are</b> simulated, and the resulting motion of the robot is compared with the intended path. The augmentations of the inspection planner improve robot behavior. However, logging sensor state reveals the sensor has incorrect orientation when reaching the waypoints. The Cartesian motion planner fails to produce a full trajectory for most paths. The inverse kinematics based point to point planner leads to undesirable behavior such as arcing motions between waypoints and goal overshoot. To test basic functionality for point cloud acquisition some of the generated paths are run on the real robot, while both the robot state and 3 D sensor output is being logged. The SR 300 performed poorly, possibly due to poor lighting conditions. It is concluded that the inspection planner should be rewritten to incorporate trajectory planning in joint space. The inspection planner appears to perform well but needs additional measures for adapting the path for inspection with manipulators...|$|E

Segmenting a duration of captured speech into analysis frames of 20 msecs ensures the assumption of stationarity.

Secure mailboxes, with locking systems, are becoming more commonly used in recent years. These mailboxes are typically heavier and larger in size than standard mailboxes. These new mailboxes have not been tested and their safety performance when impacted with a vehicle has not been evaluated. In this study, Finite Element (FE) computer simulations coupled with experimental testing is used to investigate the safety of these mailboxes and establish some guidelines on their use and installation. The study is subdivided into three main parts. In the first part a detailed FE model of the mailbox is developed and validated against pendulum crash tests.

The results showed a change in the dimensional size and the microstructure of the surfaces treated by the two lasers despite using <b>identical</b> laser processing <b>parameters.</b> This <b>was</b> due to the difference between the laser-beam brightness of the two lasers as the fiber laser produced larger power per unit area in Steradians when compared to the Nd:YAG laser.

This shows that laser surface treatment using high brightness would be cost effective as the brighter laser utilises lower power for the same surface treatment in comparison with that of a low brightness laser. Therefore, processing ceramics and other materials by employing high brightness lasers could aid in gaining an economical benefit. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd...|$|R
