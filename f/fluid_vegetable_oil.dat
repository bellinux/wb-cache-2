40|$|International audienceSills are an {{integral}} part of the formation and development of larger plutons and magma reservoirs. Thus sills are essential for both the transport and the storage of magma in the Earth's crust. However, although cooling and solidification are central to magmatism, their effects on sills have been so far poorly studied. Here, the effects of solidification on sill propagation dynamics and morphology are studied by means of analogue laboratory experiments. Hot <b>fluid</b> <b>vegetable</b> <b>oil</b> (magma analogue), that solidifies during its propagation, is injected as a sill in a colder layered gelatine solid (elastic host rock analogue). The injection flux and temperature are maintained constant during an experiment and systematically varied between each experiment, in order to vary and quantify the amount of solidification between each experiments. The oil is injected directly at the interface between the two gelatine layers. When solidification effects are small (high injection temperatures and fluxes), the propagation is continuous and the sill has a regular and smooth surface. Inversely, when solidification effects are important (low injection temperatures and fluxes), sill propagation is discontinuous and occurs by steps of surface-area creation interspersed with periods of momentary arrest. The morphology of these sills displays folds, ropy structures on their surface, and lobes with imprints of the leading fronts that correspond to each step of area creation. These experiments show that for a given, constant injected volume, as solidification effects increase, the area of the sills decreases, their thickness increases, and the number of propagation steps increases. These results have various geological and geophysical implications. The morphology of sills, such as lobate structures (interpretation of 3 D seismic studies in sedimentary basin) and ropy flow structures (field observations) can be related to solidification during emplacement. Moreover, a non-continuous morphology as observed in the field does not necessarily involve multiple injections, but could instead reflect a continuous, yet complex morphology induced by solidification effects during emplacement. Also, a discontinuous sill propagation induced by solidification effects should be associated with bursts of seismic activity. Finally, our study shows that once a sill has initiated, the dimensionless flux influences the sill thermal state, and in turn its propagation, and final extent and thickness. In restricting the lateral extent of sills, magma cooling and solidification are likely to impact directly the size of plutons constructed by amalgamated sills...|$|E

A technique called minimal quantity lubrication (MQL), which sprays small amount of cutting fluid (in the range of approximately 10 – 100 ml/h) to the cutting zone area with the aid of compressed air, was developed to merge the advantages of both dry cutting and flood cooling. For the type of cutting <b>fluids,</b> <b>vegetable</b> <b>oils</b> are common cutting fluids used in MQL because of its superior lubrication and high-pressure performance. This study evaluates the performance of MQL using castor oil as cutting fluid. The workpiece is hardened stainless steel 48 HRC. Results are compared with dry cutting. It was found that using small amount of lubricant of 50 ml/h during the particular turning process produces better results compared to dry cutting, in terms of longer tool life.

However, when petroleum oils became available in the late 1800 s and early 1900 s, the use of these fluids as quenchants in addition to their use in other industrial oil applications quickly diminished. This was primarily, but not exclusively, due to their generally very poor thermal-oxidative instability and the difficulty for formulating fluid analogs with varying viscosity properties.

40|$|Machining is a {{controlled}} material removal process and finds its application {{in a variety}} of industrial sectors such as automobile, aerospace, and defense. Similar to many other manufacturing processes, machining bears significant environmental impacts in terms of energy/resource consumption, airborne emissions, wastewater discharge, and solid wastes along with occupational health risks. Most of these issues are due to the use of cutting fluids, which are traditionally formulated with petroleum-derived compounds with high ecotoxicity and low biodegradability. Exposure to these chemicals, along with growth of microorganisms and biocides used for microbial control, could lead to respiratory irritation, asthma, pneumonia, dermatitis, and even cancer. To address these concerns, extensive effort has been put forth to (1) extend the cutting fluid life span by removing particulates, free oils, and other contaminants via separation and filtration, (2) reformulate traditional petroleum-based <b>fluids</b> with <b>vegetable</b> <b>oils</b> and bio-based ingredients for lower toxicity and higher biodegradability, and (3) reduce or even eliminate the reliance on cutting fluids during machining through dry machining and minimum quantity lubrication (MQL) techniques. Apart from these technology developments, machining process parameters can be optimized for reduced environmental impacts, especially energy consumption and carbon footprint. Process optimization approaches require the development of models and equations to correlate process parameters with process inputs and outputs. Given the current status in the field, opportunities exist in designing new bio-based, microfiltration-compatible formulations using industrial by-products, optimizing minimum MQL system configuration, advancing cutting tool insert materials and lubricants for MQL, and developing high-energy efficiency machine tools...|$|R

40|$|BACKGROUND Various <b>vegetable</b> <b>oils</b> {{are used}} for cooking foods in India. Controversies have been created that {{consumption}} of certain <b>vegetable</b> <b>oils</b> cause atherogenesis. A {{little is known about}} the effect of <b>vegetable</b> <b>oils</b> in hypercholesterolaemic conditions. Hypercholesterolaemia, mainly the increased plasma Low-Density Lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol levels and Reactive Oxygen Species (ROS) has been implicated in the early development and progression of atherosclerosis and Coronary Heart Diseases (CHD). Current study is designed to assess the effect of various <b>vegetable</b> <b>oils</b> such as coconut, sunflower, palm, olive oil and vanaspati on lipid profile and oxidative stress parameters in rats fed on a high-cholesterol diet. MATERIALS AND METHODS Hypercholesterolaemia is induced by supplementing cholesterol with the basal diet. Reference dose of various <b>vegetable</b> <b>oils</b> were administered once daily for 90 days. After the treatment period of 90 days, triacylglycerol, total cholesterol, HDL cholesterol, LDL cholesterol, VLDL cholesterol and oxidative stress parameters are estimated and analysed. RESULTS In the present study, we observed the lipid-lowering effect of various <b>vegetable</b> <b>oils</b> in rats fed with high-cholesterol diet. Administration of cholesterol showed increased level of lipid profile. Concurrent administration of various <b>vegetable</b> <b>oils</b> with high-cholesterol diet caused a significant decrease in serum total cholesterol, LDL and VLDL cholesterol. This conclusion is made based on the observation that the <b>vegetable</b> <b>oils</b> were able to restore, at least partially, the lipid profile of hypercholesterolaemic rats. A decline of antioxidant status associated with an increase in lipid peroxidation was observed in all the <b>vegetable</b> <b>oil</b> treated groups.

Among the <b>vegetable</b> <b>oils,</b> coconut oil was found to be beneficial as it has more antioxidant property.
