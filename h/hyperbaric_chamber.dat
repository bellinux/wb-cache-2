5|$|Immediate {{treatment}} with 100% oxygen, followed by recompression in a <b>hyperbaric</b> <b>chamber,</b> will {{in most cases}} result in no long-term effects. However, permanent long-term injury from DCS is possible. Three-month follow-ups on diving accidents reported to DAN in 1987 showed 14.3% of the 268 divers surveyed had ongoing symptoms of Type II DCS, and 7% from Type I DCS. Long-term follow-ups showed similar results, with 16% having permanent neurological sequelae.|$|E
5|$|Diving {{medicine}} is the diagnosis, treatment {{and prevention of}} conditions caused by exposing divers to the underwater environment. It includes the effects {{on the body of}} pressure on gases, the diagnosis and treatment of conditions caused by marine hazards and how fitness to dive affects a diver's safety. Hyperbaric {{medicine is}} another field associated with diving, since recompression in a <b>hyperbaric</b> <b>chamber</b> with hyperbaric oxygen therapy is the definitive treatment for two of the most important diving-related illnesses, DCS and arterial gas embolism.|$|E
5|$|A mysterious {{recruiter}} approaches Wilson, {{offering an}} experimental cure for his cancer. He {{is taken to}} Ajax and Angel Dust, who inject him with a serum designed to awaken latent mutant genes. They then subject him to days of torture to induce stress to trigger any mutation Wade may have, but without success. Wilson discovers Ajax's real name, Francis, and mocks him for it. In response, Ajax leaves Wilson in a <b>hyperbaric</b> <b>chamber</b> that takes him to the verge of asphyxiation periodically over a weekend. It finally activates a superhuman healing ability that cures his cancer, but leaves him severely disfigured with burn-like scars over his entire body. He escapes from the chamber and attacks Ajax, but relents when told that his disfigurement can be cured. Ajax subdues Wilson and leaves him for dead in the burning laboratory.|$|E

25|$|Oxygen therapy, {{also known}} as {{supplemental}} oxygen, {{is the use of}} oxygen as a medical treatment.

Oxygen can be given {{in a number of ways}} including nasal cannula, face mask, and inside a <b>hyperbaric</b> <b>chamber.</b>|$|E
25|$|Recompression {{treatment}} in a <b>hyperbaric</b> <b>chamber</b> was initially {{used as a}} life-saving tool to treat decompression sickness in caisson workers and divers who stayed too long at depth and developed decompression sickness.

25|$|The cost of {{breathing}} gas containing a high fraction of helium {{is a significant}} part of the cost of deep diving operations, and can be reduced by recovering the breathing gas for recycling. A reclaim helmet is provided with a return line in the diver's umbilical, and exhaled gas is discharged to this hose through a reclaim regulator, which ensures that gas pressure in the helmet cannot fall below the ambient pressure. The gas is processed at the surface in the helium reclaim system by filtering, scrubbing and boosting into storage cylinders until needed. The oxygen content may be adjusted when appropriate. The same principle is used in built-in breathing systems used to vent oxygen-rich treatment gases from a <b>hyperbaric</b> <b>chamber,</b> though those gases are generally not reclaimed. A diverter valve is provided to allow the diver to manually switch to open circuit if the reclaim valve malfunctions, and an underpressure flood valve allows water to enter the helmet to avoid a squeeze if the reclaim valve fails suddenly, allowing the diver time to switch to open circuit without injury.|$|E
25|$|After {{spending}} time in a <b>hyperbaric</b> <b>chamber</b> {{to increase the speed}} of his recovery from the elbow injury, Ponting recovered sufficiently to play in the Boxing Day Test, the opening match of a three-Test series against Pakistan. Despite still being inconvenienced by the injury, he scored 57 at close to a run-a-ball, before being dismissed by another short pitched delivery for 12 in Australia's second innings. The home side {{went on to win the}} match comfortably, and Ponting overtook Shane Warne's record of 91 Test victories and surpassing Steve Waugh as crickets most successful Test captain. Ponting scored 853 runs at 38.77 in 13 Tests in 2009, and scored only one century and seven half-centuries. Nevertheless, his ODI form was more convincing, topping the run-scoring list with MS Dhoni. His 1,198 runs were scored at an average of 42.78, including two centuries and nine half-centuries in 29 matches. Ponting was criticised for choosing to bat on a green pitch for the Second Test. Australia were dismissed for 127, and Ponting was re-dismissed from a short ball, this time for a first-ball duck, and many sections of the media called for him to stop playing the hook and pull shots. He fell for only 11 in the second innings, and when Australia lost their eighth wicket, they were only just over 50 ahead. However, a 123-run ninth-wicket partnership between Michael Hussey and Peter Siddle rescued the home-side, helping them win by 36 runs. After being dropped on zero, Ponting scored his fifth double-century in the Third and final Test in Hobart. His innings helped Australia complete a 3–0 series victory.|$|E
