50|$|The {{earliest}} practical photographic process, the daguerreotype, {{introduced in}} 1839, {{did not use}} film. The light-sensitive chemicals were formed {{on the surface of}} a silver-plated copper sheet. The calotype process produced paper negatives. Beginning in the 1850s, thin glass <b>plates</b> coated with <b>photographic</b> emulsion became the standard material for use in the camera. Although fragile and relatively heavy, the <b>glass</b> used <b>for</b> <b>photographic</b> <b>plates</b> was of better optical quality than early transparent plastics and was, at first, less expensive. Glass plates continued to be used long after the introduction of film, and were used for astrophotography and electron micrography until the early 2000s, when they were supplanted by digital recording methods. Ilford continues to manufacture <b>glass</b> plates <b>for</b> special scientific applications.|$|R
50|$|The Joly Screen {{process had}} some problems. First and foremost, {{although}} the colored lines were reasonably fine (about 75 sets of three colored {{lines to the}} inch) they were still disturbingly visible at normal viewing distances and nearly intolerable when enlarged by projection. This problem was exacerbated {{by the fact that}} each screen was individually ruled on a machine which used three pens to apply the transparent colored inks, resulting in irregularities, high reject rates and high cost. The <b>glass</b> used <b>for</b> <b>photographic</b> <b>plates</b> at the time was not perfectly flat, and lack of uniform good contact between the screen and the image gave rise to areas of degraded color. Poor contact also caused false colors to appear if the sandwich was viewed at an angle. Although much simpler than the Kromskop system, the Joly system was not inexpensive. The starter kit of plate holder, compensating filter, one taking screen and one viewing screen cost $30 (the equivalent of at least $750 in 2010 dollars) and additional viewing screens were $1 each (the equivalent of at least $25 in 2010 dollars). This system, too, soon died of neglect, although in fact it pointed the way to the future.|$|R

5000|$|When Nordenskiöld {{arrived in}} Durango he made {{arrangements}} {{to stay with}} Cattle rancher Richard Wetherill at the Alamo Ranch in Mancos, CO.

(Letters Letter No. 15, The Letters of Gustaf Nordenskiöld Mesa Verde 1991.) He also says in the same letter that his father should answer by telegram whether he should remain where he is. He worked with Wetherill, discoverer of the Mesa Verde ruins in 1888, and Charles Mason. The Wetherill's led Nordenskiöld through the canyons and sandstone cliffs of the Mesa Verde ruins where he applied his European scientific training, conducting the first archaeological excavation of the cliff dwellings. Nordenskiöld employed Wetherill to supervise excavations at Mesa Verde and trained Wetherill {{in a number of}} techniques, such as how to use a trowel (he had been using a shovel).

40|$|We {{present an}} {{application}} of Mathematical Morphology (MM) for the classification of astronomical objects, both for star/galaxy differentiation and galaxy morphology classification. We demonstrate that, for CCD images, 99. 3 +/- 3. 8 % of galaxies can be separated from stars using MM, with 19. 4 +/- 7. 9 % of the stars being misclassified. We demonstrate that, <b>for</b> <b>photographic</b> <b>plate</b> images, the number of galaxies correctly separated from the stars can be increased using our MM diffraction spike tool, which allows 51. 0 +/- 6. 0 % of the high-brightness galaxies that are inseparable in current techniques to be correctly classified, with only 1. 4 +/- 0. 5 % of the high-brightness stars contaminating the population. We demonstrate that elliptical (E) and late-type spiral (Sc-Sd) galaxies can be classified using MM at an accuracy of 91. 4 +/- 7. 8 %. It is a method involving less `free parameters' than current techniques, especially automated machine learning algorithms. The limitation of MM galaxy morphology based on seeing and distance is also presented.

50|$|A {{panchromatic}} emulsion produces a realistic reproduction {{of a scene}} as it appears to the human eye. Almost all modern photographic film is panchromatic, but some types are orthochromatic and are not sensitive to certain wavelengths of light. As naturally prepared, silver halide emulsions are much more sensitive to blue and UV light than to green and red wavelengths. The German chemist Hermann W. Vogel found out how to extend the sensitivity into the green, and later the orange, by adding sensitising dyes to the emulsion. By the addition of erythrosine the emulsion could be made orthochromatic while some cyanine derivatives confer sensitivity to the whole visible spectrum making it panchromatic. However, his technique was not extended to achieve a fully panchromatic film until the early 1900s, shortly after his death. Panchromatic stock <b>for</b> still <b>photographic</b> <b>plates</b> became available commercially in 1906. The switch from orthochromatic film, however, was only gradual. Panchromatic plates cost {{two to three times}} as much, and had to be developed in darkness, unlike orthochromatic—which, being insensitive to red, could be developed under a red light in the darkroom. And the process that increased the film's sensitivity to yellow and red also made it oversensitive to blue and violet, requiring a yellow-red lens filter to correct it, which in turn reduced the total amount of light and increased the necessary exposure time.|$|R
50|$|The {{simpler and}} {{somewhat}} more economical alternative was the Joly Screen process. This required no special camera or viewer, just a special color-compensating filter {{for the camera}} lens and a special holder <b>for</b> the <b>photographic</b> <b>plates.</b> The holder contained {{the heart of the}} system: a clear glass plate on which very fine lines of three colors had been ruled in a regular repeating pattern, completely covering its surface. The idea was that instead of taking three separate complete photographs through three colored filters, the filters could be {{in the form of a}} large number of very narrow strips (the colored lines) allowing the necessary color information to be recorded in a single compound image. After the negative was developed, a positive transparency was printed from it and a viewing screen with red, green and blue lines in the same pattern as the lines of the taking screen was applied and carefully aligned. The colors then appeared as if by magic. The transparency and screen were very like the layer of monochrome liquid crystal elements and overlay of hair-thin red, green and blue color filter stripes which create the color image in a typical LCD display. This was the invention of Irish scientist John Joly, although he, like so many other inventors, eventually discovered that his basic concept had been anticipated in Louis Ducos du Hauron's long-since-expired 1868 patent.|$|R
50|$|Within {{a decade}} of being {{introduced}} in America, 3 general forms of camera were in popular use: the American- or chamfered-box camera, the Robert’s-type camera or “Boston box”, and the Lewis-type camera. The American-box camera had beveled edges at the front and rear, and {{an opening in the}} rear where the formed image could be viewed on ground glass. The top of the camera had hinged doors <b>for</b> placing <b>photographic</b> <b>plates.</b> Inside there was one available slot for distant objects, and another slot in the back for close-ups. The lens was focused either by sliding or with a rack and pinion mechanism. The Robert’s-type cameras were similar to the American-box, except for having a knob-fronted worm gear {{on the front of the}} camera, which moved the back box for focusing. Many Robert’s-type cameras allowed focusing directly on the lens mount. The third popular daguerreotype camera in America was the Lewis-type, introduced in 1851, which utilized a bellows for focusing. The main body of the Lewis-type camera was mounted on the front box, but the rear section was slotted into the bed for easy sliding. Once focused, a set screw was tightened to hold the rear section in place. Having the bellows in the middle of the body facilitated making a second, in-camera copy of the original image.|$|R
