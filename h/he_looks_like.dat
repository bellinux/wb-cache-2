25|$|Edmund – 23 years old, {{the younger}} and more intellectually and poetically {{inclined}} son. He is thin and wiry. <b>He</b> <b>looks</b> <b>like</b> both his parents but more like his mother. He has her big dark eyes and hypersensitive mouth in a long narrow Irish face with dark brown hair and red highlights from the sun. Like his mother, he is extremely nervous. He is in bad health and his cheeks are sunken. Later he is diagnosed with tuberculosis. He is politically inclined to have socialist leanings. He traveled the world by working in the merchant navy and caught tuberculosis while abroad.|$|E
25|$|Trigger (Roger Lloyd-Pack) — Trigger, {{apparently}} {{so called}} because <b>he</b> <b>looks</b> <b>like</b> a horse, {{was the principal}} supporting character earlier in the show's run, although his importance lessened as the series progressed. Lloyd Pack was cast by pure chance: Ray Butt, who hired him to portray Trigger after seeing him in a stage play, had only attended that play to observe potential Del Boy actor Billy Murray. A daft road sweeper most frequently seen in the Nag's Head, Trigger was initially portrayed as a small-time thief, supplying Del with dubious goods. In later episodes he came to adopt the 'village idiot' role, and believes that Rodney's real name is Dave.|$|E
25|$|One {{day after}} school, {{a young girl}} named Kilala Reno stumbles across a boy {{sleeping}} in her yard. After thinking to herself <b>he</b> <b>looks</b> <b>like</b> a Prince, she tries to kiss him, thinking it will wake him up, just like a kiss wakes up Sleeping Beauty. He does wake but only to fall back asleep again. Kilala then carries him inside her house and watches over him sleeping as she wonders {{who he is and}} where he came from. As she's folding his coat, a small tiara falls out, which she tries on. To her surprise, she feels just like one of the Disney Princesses. Then, Rei wakes up and accuses her of stealing the tiara. She calls him the Thief instead, questioning how she would know if he didn't steal it first. Rei's servant, Valdou, runs in and unintentionally breaks up the fight.|$|E

25|$|Bobby {{receives}} and rejects {{an unexpected}} job offer from a firm in Buenos Aires. Soon afterwards Bobby nearly dies after drinking from a poisoned bottle of beer. The local police do not pursue this. Frankie thinks Bobby is targeted for murder. Bobby agrees {{when he sees}} the issue of the local paper with the photograph used to find Pritchard's sister. Bobby sees that is not the one he found in the dead man's pocket. He and Frankie realise that Bassington-ffrench swapped the photographs and that Mrs Cayman is not related to the dead man at all. Bobby and Frankie search for Bassington-ffrench. They trace him to Merroway Court in Hampshire, owned by Roger's brother and sister-in-law, Henry and Sylvia. They stage a car accident outside the house {{with the help of a}} doctor friend so that Frankie, feigning injury, will be invited to stay to recover. Frankie produces a newspaper cutting about the mysterious dead man; Sylvia remarks that <b>he</b> <b>looks</b> <b>like</b> Alan Carstairs, a traveller and big-game hunter who was a friend of John Savage, a millionaire who had killed himself after learning he had terminal cancer.|$|E
25|$|Coppola's {{next project}} was Jack, which was {{released}} on August 9, 1996. It starred Robin Williams as Jack Powell, a ten-year-old boy whose cells are growing at four times the normal rate, so {{at the age of}} ten <b>he</b> <b>looks</b> <b>like</b> a 40-year-old man. With Diane Lane, Brian Kerwin and Bill Cosby, Jack also featured Jennifer Lopez, Fran Drescher and Michael McKean in supporting roles. Although a moderate box-office success, grossing $58 million domestically on an estimated $45 million budget, it was panned by critics, many of whom disliked the film's abrupt contrast between actual comedy and tragic melodrama. It was also unfavourably compared with the 1988 film Big, in which Tom Hanks also played a child in a grown man's body. Most critics felt that the screenplay was poorly written, not funny and the dramatic material was unconvincing and unbelievable. Other critics felt that Coppola was too talented to be making this type of film. Although ridiculed for making the film, Coppola has defended it, saying he is not ashamed of the final cut of the movie. He had been friends with Robin Williams for many years and had always wanted to work with him as an actor. When Williams was offered the screenplay for Jack, he said he would only agree to do it if Coppola agreed to sign on as director.|$|E

500|$|Kuhn was {{the only}} Vanderbilt {{baseball}} player named All-Southern by either Cliff Wheatley or Morgan Blake in 1922. Wheatley's choice read, [...] "Vanderbilt's sole representative is [...] "Doc" [...] Kuhn, who came in several lengths ahead of the other shortstops. Kuhn is a wonderful batter and fields well enough in comparison with other Dixie infielders". For Blake, [...] "the best shortstop in the S. I. A. A. was Doc Kuhn of Vanderbilt, a great all-around athlete... <b>He</b> <b>looks</b> <b>like</b> a big leaguer in action." ...|$|E
500|$|In {{the latter}} half of 1964 and 1965, Dylan moved from folk {{songwriter}} to folk-rock pop-music star. His jeans and work shirts were replaced by a Carnaby Street wardrobe, sunglasses day or night, and pointed [...] "Beatle boots". A London reporter wrote: [...] "Hair that would set the teeth of a comb on edge. A loud shirt that would dim the neon lights of Leicester Square. <b>He</b> <b>looks</b> <b>like</b> an undernourished cockatoo." [...] Dylan began to spar with interviewers. Appearing on the Les Crane television show and asked about a movie he planned, he told Crane it would be a cowboy horror movie. Asked if he played the cowboy, Dylan replied, [...] "No, I play my mother." ...|$|E

500|$|Taylor met DeBorah Sharpe in 1977 {{during the}} {{production}} of The Wiz where she was the understudy for Dorothy. They married in 1980 and had a son, Adamah. In his spare time, Taylor often helped teach vulnerable young people {{through a variety of}} projects, including at the George Street Playhouse in New Jersey. He noted [...] "things have come out of the air for me...I'm grateful; that's why I work with kids. I've had a blessing in my career, to have gone as far as I've gone." [...] A 1995 piece in The Plain Dealer described Taylor as [...] "A jolly giant of a man, <b>he</b> <b>looks</b> <b>like</b> a natural force – a mountain, perhaps, who can tell great stories."

500|$|On {{the eve of}} {{the season}} 6 premiere, NYPD Blue {{executives}} assured the public that Smits' storyline would not be irreversible. However, this led to doubt among critics who did not feel it was possible to have a sensible storyline that retained the services of Kim Delaney in the role of Simone's wife Detective Diane Russell. A humorous piece in Newsweek described the general consensus as [...] "He's gonna die. <b>He</b> <b>looks</b> <b>like</b> he's dying...If he dies, it's easy to keep his wife (played by Kim Delaney) on the show." [...] In addition, his castmates noted that their characters would grieve. However, some sources, such as National Public Radio's Noah Adams and Robert Siegel, read into the fact that [...] "Network publicity speaks of Simone's departure, not his demise..." ...|$|E
500|$|Author and {{journalist}} Heidi Stringell finds Flagg [...] "an embodiment of pure evil", contending that King sees {{good and evil}} as “real forces”; Flagg’s embodiment of evil is confirmed {{by the fact that}} [...] "he is a killer, a maker of mischief, a liar, and a tempter". To Stringell, Flagg’s disappearance at the end of The Stand shows that “evil ultimately leads nowhere”. The author calls Flagg a [...] "generic hybrid" [...] of the archetypical [...] "Dark Man and the Trickster". To her, the combination of these two characteristics found in different cultural realms forces people to face their [...] "flawed humanity" [...] with the [...] "amorality” Flagg represents. Jenifer Paquette, author of Respecting The Stand: A Critical Analysis of Stephen King's Apocalyptic Novel, writes that [...] "Flagg's horror is that <b>he</b> <b>looks</b> <b>like</b> an ordinary man, and his behavior is a mockery of humanity—a terrible insight into the human psyche. King suggests that the thing to fear the most is inside ourselves." ...|$|E

500|$|McDiarmid's {{performance}} as Palpatine was generally well received by critics. Todd McCarthy of Variety commented, [...] "Entertaining {{from start to}} finish and even enthralling at times, 'Sith' has some acting worth writing home about, specifically McDiarmid's dominant turn as the mastermind of the evil empire." [...] A reviewer for The Village Voice wrote that [...] "Ian McDiarmid's unctuous Emperor turns appropriately vampiric as he attempts to draw Anakin into the Sith fold with promises of eternal life." [...] Still, his performance was not without detractors; David Edelstein of Slate critiqued, [...] "McDiarmid isn't the subtlest of satanic tempters. With his lisp and his clammy little leer, <b>he</b> <b>looks</b> <b>like</b> an old queen keen on trading an aging butt-boy (Count Dooku) for fresh meat [...] which leaves Anakin looking more and more like a 15-watt bulb." [...] McDiarmid had expressed interest in reprising the role of Palpatine in the planned [...] TV series, which remains unproduced.|$|E

During one scene, Andy is impressed with Tom's Canadian DVD version of the 1999 thriller, Deep Blue Sea. Tom says the disc includes 22 extra minutes and a commentary track in which actor LL Cool J, who appears in the film, raps all his dialogue. Leslie tells Ron she had already written a eulogy for him and it starts, [...] "Oh captain, my captain! Ron Swanson: a swan song", {{a reference to the}} Walt Whitman poem [...] "O Captain!

He also {{spent time with}} the Stars' International Hockey League (IHL) affiliate Michigan K-Wings, notching five points in nine games. During his rookie season in the NHL, Lyashenko played center on the Stars second line, earning praise from coach Ken Hitchcock, [...] "His game has risen beyond his years. He's 20 years old in age only. <b>He</b> <b>looks</b> <b>like</b> a real good fit for us." [...] The Stars went to the Stanley Cup Finals that season, but lost to the New Jersey Devils. In the Stars' first round playoff series against the Edmonton Oilers, Lyashenko scored the winning goal {{in the first game}} of the series. During the 2000 Western Conference final against the Colorado Avalanche, Lyashenko scored the series clinching goal in game seven. Lyashenko played in 16 playoff games for the Stars. During the playoffs in his rookie season, Hitchcock was happy with Lyashenko's play, saying, [...] "He's an exceptional defensive player -- his offensive skills have improved as the season's gone on." ...|$|E

500|$|Raymund Flandez of The Wall Street Journal criticized most of {{the musical}} {{performances}} in the episode, calling [...] "Run Joey Run" [...] the highlight of an otherwise [...] "slow, forced show". Flandez opined of [...] "Ice Ice Baby": [...] "Will, kicking it old school, doesn't cut it with his '80s-flashback moves because a.) he takes himself too seriously and b.) <b>he</b> <b>looks</b> <b>like</b> he's in a J.Crew mag, not part of 2 Live Crew." [...] Gerrick D. Kennedy of the Los Angeles Times wrote that he hated the episode, similarly calling [...] "Run Joey Run" [...] his favorite song, but noting that that was [...] "not hard considering the songbook that was offered". Kennedy deemed the [...] "Ice Ice Baby" [...] performance his least favourite moment of the entire series thus far. He concluded: [...] "Each of the musical numbers felt about two minutes longer than they should have been. I love Newton-John’s walk-on cameo, but I don’t want them {{to fall into the}} habit of re-creating music videos frame by frame: It was cute - once. It sounds harsh, but I could have completely done without the episode. It was almost as if they needed filler just to showcase the [...] "Physical" [...] video." [...] In December 2012, TV Guide named their rendition one of Glee worst performances.|$|E
500|$|Saadiq titled The Way I See It as a {{declaration}} to music listeners {{about how his}} perspective was more informed by classic soul than before in his career: [...] "This is what I really love, and everything you’ve heard from me before {{has been based on}} the roots of this music." [...] The cover photo was taken at a show in 2006 at Sweet's Ballroom in Oakland, in which Saadiq performed Marvin Gaye's 1965 song [...] "Ain't That Peculiar". It showed Saadiq singing into a microphone with his arms raised and wearing a suit, tie, and thick-rimmed glasses: a look similar to that of Temptations singer David Ruffin. According to Saadiq, the photo [...] "set the tone for the whole album ... me singing that song, me wearing that suit, it said everything that this album should be." [...] Music journalist Greg Kot believed the cover [...] "evokes the dramatic portraits and color schemes of old-school jazz and soul albums. Think Ray Charles on Atlantic, Sonny Rollins on Blue Note, Sam and Dave on Stax ... With arms raised, <b>he</b> <b>looks</b> <b>like</b> he's testifying as much as singing." [...] The rest of the album's packaging also adheres to a retro aesthetic with its crimson-tinted cover's font and 1960s Columbia Records logo. The packaging's photography was taken by Norman Seeff.|$|E
500|$|Seth navigates {{the city}} on foot—cars, bicycles, and public {{transportation}} rarely even appear–as he talks with friends or rifles through used book shops. [...] For literary theorist Barbara Postema, the character fits the archetype of Walter Benjamin's flâneur—the wandering urban pedestrian {{out of touch with}} his own time and obsessed with the past. [...] Seth pines for a past not his own and obsessively collects consumer items from earlier in the 20th century. [...] His focus is primarily on the period from the 1930s to the 1950s, a time he feels particularly [...] "Canadian". [...] He goes as far as to wear an old-fashioned overcoat and broad-rimmed hat, for which passing teenagers taunt him, saying <b>he</b> <b>looks</b> <b>like</b> Clark Kent or Dick Tracy. [...] He declares to Chester: [...] "I do think life was simpler then... easier for people to find personal happiness." [...] Brown disagrees, saying, [...] "I think it's always been difficult for people to be happy." [...] Seth dreads the future and allows his memories of childhood to dominate his thoughts, but recognizes and criticizes his own obsessions: [...] "There's something in the decay of old things that provokes an evocative sadness for the vanished past. [...] If those buildings were perfectly preserved it wouldn't be the same." [...] Despite this consciousness, he continues to pursue his collecting.|$|E
