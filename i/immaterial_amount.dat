5000|$|A plug, {{also known}} as {{reconciling}} amount, is an unsupported adjustment to an accounting record or general ledger. [...] Ideally, bookkeeping should account for all numbers during reconciliation, i.e. when comparing two sets of accounting records {{to make sure they}} are in agreement. However, discrepancies, i.e. unintentional accounting errors can occur, for example due to data entry, or an adding or a rounding error. An organization may use a plug for an <b>immaterial</b> <b>amount,</b> because it may not be cost effective to search through numerous pages of transactions to find the error. The acceptability of a plug depends upon the amount: a plug must be immaterial in order to be justified.|$|E
5000|$|In 2010, GPHI {{announced}} it {{had won a}} significant favorable ruling in its litigation with ATI Technologies and AMD in June 2010, following the patent lawsuit originally filed during the Silicon Graphics, Inc. era. Following the 2008 appeal by ATI over the validity of [...] ('327) and Silicon Graphics Inc's voluntary dismissal of the [...] ('376) patent from the lawsuit, the Federal Circuit upheld the jury verdict on the validity of GPHI's U.S. Patent No. 6,650,327, and furthermore found that AMD had lost its right to challenge patent validity in future proceedings. On January 31, 2011, the District Court entered an order that permits AMD to pursue its invalidity affirmative defense at trial and does not permit SGI to accuse AMD's Radeon R700 series of graphics products of infringement in this case. On April 18, 2011, GPHI and AMD had entered into a confidential Settlement and License Agreement that resolved this litigation matter for an <b>immaterial</b> <b>amount</b> and that provides immunity under all GPHI patents for alleged infringement by AMD products, including components, software and designs. On April 26, 2011, the Court entered an order granting the parties' agreed motion for dismissal and final judgment.|$|E
40|$|Life {{and health}} {{represent}} {{the most precious}} values of each human being. Unlawful encroachment upon these values, which can occur {{in the health care}} service, is connected with civil liability. Monetary compensation for immaterial damage has been a neglected legal institute for a long time under Czech law. It is divided into two systems now, a protection of personal rights and reimbursement of the damage. This legal area is not easily understandable to legal professionals, let alone to lay men. The purpose of this thesis is to analyze the up to date state of assessment of immaterial damage and to evaluate its pros and cons. It deals with the types of infridgement of personal rights which can occur in the health care service, and subsequently, it describes the systems under which the immaterial damage is reimbursed. Concurrently, I focus on the way of determination of the monetary compensation of the <b>immaterial</b> damage, the <b>amount</b> of monetary compensation actually awarded under Czech law and I evaluate adequacy of such compensation. This thesis is divided into four chapters. Chapter One provides theoretical grounds {{for the rest of the}} text, a specification of essential terms and definitions which shall be used in the text later. Chapter Two deals with one of the systems of compensation for immaterial [...] ...|$|R
