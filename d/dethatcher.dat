50|$|A <b>dethatcher,</b> or lawn {{scarifier}} is {{a device}} that removes thatch from lawns. Types of dethatchers include motorized dethatchers or those that can be pulled behind a garden tractor.|$|E
50|$|A {{small amount}} of thatch may provide a {{beneficial}} insulating effect against fluctuations in temperature and moisture. However, excessive thatch can cause root problems and lawn mower difficulties. A <b>dethatcher</b> {{may be used to}} remove thatch from a lawn.|$|E
50|$|Adding a hitch to {{the back}} of a zero turn mower allows use of a variety of {{different}} attachments, including a dump cart, spreader, plug aerator, lawn <b>dethatcher,</b> roller or sprayer. Some zero turn mowers also accommodate front-mounted attachments such as a snow blade, snow blower or brush for clearing snow or debris.|$|E
50|$|Its line of groomers {{consists}} of spike aerators, plug aerators, and <b>dethatchers.</b> Aerators {{are used to}} loosen compacted soil and allow nutrients to be better absorbed into the soil. They also help the roots of grass to grow deeper and turf to become thicker. As far as <b>dethatchers</b> goes, Agri-Fab produces a variety including one that attaches to most lawn sweepers. <b>Dethatchers</b> are used to remove thatch, which is a layer of accumulating/slowly decomposing grass clippings, roots, grass stems, and debris that settle on the ground over time.|$|R

40|$|Competition {{for water}} is {{becoming}} more intense {{in many parts of}} the USA, including west-central Nebraska. It is believed that reduced tillage with increased crop residue conserves water, but the magnitude of water savings is not clear. In 2007, a study was initiated on the effect of residue on soil water content and crop yield at North Platte, Nebraska. The experiment was conducted on a set of plots planted to field corn (Zea mays). There were two treatments: residue-covered soil and bare soil. Bare-soil plots were created by using a <b>dethatcher</b> and subsequent hand-raking, removing most of the residue. The residue plots were left untreated. The residue was mostly from previous no-till soybean crops. Residue mass and cover were measured twice: at the beginning (June) and at the end (October) of the growing season. The experiment consisted of eight plots (two treatments times four replications). Each plot was 12. 2 m (40 ft) by 12. 2 m. During the growing season, soil water content was measured seven times in each of the plots at six depths using a neutron probe (CPN Hydroprobe) ...|$|E
40|$|It is {{believed}} that reduced tillage, with more crop residue on the soil surface, conserves water, especially in arid and semi-arid climates. However, the magnitude of water conservation is not clear. In 2007, a study was initiated {{on the effect of}} residue on soil water content and crop yield at North Platte, Nebraska. The experiment was conducted on plots planted to field corn (Zea mays L.) in 2007 and 2008, and soybean (Glycine max) in 2009. There were two treatments: residue-covered soil and bare soil. Bare-soil plots were created in April 2007 by using a <b>dethatcher</b> and subsequent hand-raking. In April 2008 and 2009, bare-soil plots were recreated on the same plots as in 2007. The experiment consisted of eight plots (two treatments with four replications each). Each plot was 12. 2 m by 12. 2 m. The crop was sprinkler-irrigated, but purposely water-stressed, so that any water conservation in the residue-covered plots might translate into higher yields. In 2007, mean corn yield was 12. 4 Mg ha- 1 in the residue-covered plots and 10. 8 Mg ha- 1 in the baresoil plots. Other research has shown that it takes 65 - 100 mm of irrigation water to produce this extra 1. 6 Mg ha- 1, which may be considered water conservation due to the residue. In 2008, the residue covered soil held approximately 60 mm more water in the top 1. 83 m compared to the bare soil {{towards the end of the}} growing season. In addition, mean corn yield was 11. 7 Mg ha- 1 in the residue covered plots and 10. 6 Mg ha- 1 in the bare-soil plots. It would take 30 - 65 mm of irrigation water to produce the difference. Thus, the total amount of water conservation due to the residue was 90 - 125 mm in 2008. In 2009, the residue-covered soil held approximately 90 mm more water in the top 1. 83 m compared to the bare soil towards the end of the growing season. Also, mean soybean yield was 4. 5 Mg ha- 1 in the residue-covered plots and 3. 9 Mg ha- 1 in the bare-soil plots. Between 70 - 90 mm of irrigation water would be required to produce the difference...|$|E
40|$|Graduation date: 2013 Geohumus is a new, unique hybrid soil {{amendment}} made of polyacrylic acid, igneous rock flour, and quartz sand. It is biodegradable and is marketed to increase soil porosity, increase plant yield, and increase plant available water {{by up to}} 30 %, all while using a low inclusion rate of only 1 - 2 % volume/volume (v/v). The objective {{of this research was}} to evaluate uses of Geohumus in a turfgrass setting. Two field trials and one greenhouse trial were conducted between the summers of 2010, 2011, and 2012. For the field incorporation study, Geohumus was mixed with USGA (United States Golf Association) specified sand and incorporated at a 1 % v/v ratio into an existing perennial ryegrass stand maintained at two heights of cut using various incorporation machinery. Treatments included incorporation of Geohumus via an aerator, <b>dethatcher,</b> Graden, or simulated drill-and-fill. Daily light box pictures were analyzed using SigmaScan Pro software to compare percent green cover among treatments and to establish which plots were to receive irrigation. The readings showed significant differences among treatments in irrigation applications required to keep the turf green. The aeration treatment by itself was as effective as any treatment with Geohumus incorporation. Aeration provided a 35 % reduction in irrigation applications on the 61 mm height of cut in 2011 and a 24 % reduction in irrigation applications on the same height in 2012. The second field trial evaluated various {{soil amendment}}s for use in divot repair mixes under full sun and partial shade conditions. In addition to differing microclimates, divots were further evaluated by receiving either one or two irrigation applications per day. Uniform divots with dimensions of 10. 16 x 7. 62 cm were created using a spring-loaded catapult with a hula-hoe attachment. Treatments applied consisted of combinations of United States Golf Association (USGA) specified sand and perennial ryegrass seed but differed according to soil amendments which were incorporated into the divot mixes based on volume (v/v). Soil amendments tested included Geohumus (1 % v/v), Zeba (1 % v/v), Axis (10 % v/v), Lassenite ATS (10 % v/v), Dakota Peat (10 % v/v), Scotts EZ Seed (10 % v/v), and Wondersoil (10 % v/v). Weekly ratings were taken using light box pictures in conjunction with digital analysis software to measure percent green cover. Results indicated that microclimate and irrigation frequency affected the establishment of divot repair mixes more than the presence of soil amendments. A third trial comparing perennial ryegrass root masses grown in rooting boxes in a greenhouse showed major differences as influenced by placement of Geohumus within the soil profile. Geohumus influenced root mass in the upper 7. 6 cm of the soil profile but {{no significant differences were found}} at lower depths. Geohumus incorporated at a 7. 6 - 12. 7 cm depth appeared to be the most influential depth for increasing root mass in the upper 7. 6 cm of the profile...|$|E
40|$|The crop to be {{incorporated}} was a frost susceptible green manure that spontaneously grassed {{and looked like}} an old ley. The ground was very dry. The film shows the following plow <b>dethatchers</b> at work: • Bugnot 52 Rapidlab • Mini- 8 OVLAC • Escudero Adero • Kverneland Ecomat • Traditional Operating plow Under wet conditions, the shallow tillage without soil-turning (= with crow's feet <b>dethatchers</b> for example) does not provide an absolutely clean soil. It’s the same with a superficial and complete reversal of a ley. One strategy would be to till soil superficially (= 3 - 4 cm for example) with crow's feet or cultivator blades to dry vegetation, then moving a disc harrow plow, which, even without causing complete reversal would leave behind a "clean" field. But this strategy {{has yet to be}} tested and demonstrated...|$|R
